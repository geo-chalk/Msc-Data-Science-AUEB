147,1160,cjgiant,4.31,"A jet black pour produces a deep tan, creamy head. Lacing is streams and spots with varying stickiness. Feel is pretty aggressively bitter, fitting in with Stone's reputation but it has the effect of roughing up the nearly full body of the beer for me. Aromas open with chocolate and coffee emphasized in the dark malts, with the piney hops starting to play in as the beer warms up. Bitterness is up front in the taste, seeming at first coming from the hops, but the roasted notes of coffee, hiagh-cacao dark choclate, and even a little campfire ember combine and take over by mid-taste. Carbonation level is nice, keeping the dark malt richness from weighing down each sip too much.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,96
147,1160,puck1225,4.32,Haven’t had this in a very long time. Found it on draft in Dallas.  Poured into a snifter. Absolutely beautiful beer. Dark brown color with a gorgeous brown head and excellent curtain lacing. Smell and taste of dark chocolate and burnt rye toast. Licorice and dark berries. Bold bitter finish. Dry and old school. Very nice!,Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,96
147,1160,cmb,3.53,"Can. Certainly fits promotional description and some of the recent reviews. Very dark, black, lots of head, dry bitter chocolate and coffee taste. One reviewer compared it to soy sauce which I can see. Apparently a top selection of this style which I don’t seem to resonate to. My ratings reflect my preferences, would omit if I could. I think I like sweeter stouts like Oatmeal Stout better, and those with caramel notes or less bitterness.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,96
147,1160,highdesertdrinker,3.81,"Pours black with a little head. The aroma is dark malts, maybe some vanilla and hops. The taste is citrus hops, dark malts, licorice, some bitterness with a little bit of vanilla and a tad bit like soy sauce. This is an OK stout but drinks somewhat like a strong black ipa and I’d just prefer having one of those over this. Now the Espresso IRS was something special but this is a one and doner and I did have a higher opinion when I had it a few years back but many good stouts later my palette has probably shifted as it has with other beers as well, cheers!",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,96
147,1160,defunksta,4.17,"Canned 10/2022 (4 months ago)  Appearance: Pours a completely dark, black color with a massive dark tan head. SRM of 23-24. (4.25)  Aroma: Strong aromas of dark chocolate, cocoa, some bitter coffee roast underneath. Somewhat dry.  Flavor: Strong and rich flavors of dark chocolate, cocoa, some vanilla, dark fruit, light espresso roast. Yeasty in the middle and ultimately finishes with lingering dark chocolate notes.  Feel: Medium-bodied, strong carbonation. Somewhat clean on the palate. Surprisingly dry.  Compared to Sierra Nevada Narwal 2/2023: Pours similar with a larger head. Milder aromas. More dark chocolate and roast. Less pine. More of a roasty bitterness with less pine.  Compared to North Coast Old Rasputin 3/2023: Pours similar, darker head. Stronger aromas. More Dark chocolate, and bitter pine. Less bittersweet chocolate, English black malt and cream. Darker, heavier, and more bitter pine.  Overall: A very-well made Russian Imperial Stout. Dark chocolate, coffee roast, yeasty, yet incredibly dry and drinkable. The drinkability and dryness is the key here and how it hides the alcohol. Only this one and Old Raspy are the two that I've had that can do this. This may be a close second to Old Raspy. (Rating: 4.17+)",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,96
147,1160,RacerX5k,3.93,"Never rated the original legend, and I will not bore everyone with my history. Looks like stout, aroma (this is canned, which kills aroma, and I hate, 99% of the time, cans). Taste, bitter chocolate, black currant (I'll buy that, If I knew what it was), molasses (slightly, I've had better), no coffee whatsoever. Hugely malted, smooth, satisfying, but thin. Massive beer, but I much prefer the old days $6 an bomber for this, and at $19 a six pack, no need to have again.

147,1160,KT3418,4,"I do really enjoy this one. It's just plain good, not really mind-blowing but satisfying enough and good for the style. Idk why they removed the word ""Russian"" from the name for this re-release, I mean I can assume why but it's silly when you know the history of the style. Anyways I agree they shouldn't have taken this away. I know they're known as an ipa brewery but I've genuinely enjoyed their other beers as well",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,96
147,1160,MrOH,4.69,"I'm guessing that they removed the ""Russian"" part of the name due to the war in Ukraine.

147,1160,MichaelBeerington,4.89,"I love a stout that doesn't taste like dessert. On draft at Orange City Brewing in Lake Mary FL in a tulip glass. Bittersweet, but a bit more bitter than sweet. Dark chocolate covered cherries with a heavy, cognac-like punch behind it. Very nice. Smooth for 10.5 ABV. This is may be a one and done.

147,1160,MonDak_Joe1953,4.43,"This is a 22oz bottle of the '2014 RELEASE'. Label displays 11%ABV. Nearly opaque black colored body, with the thinnest of bottom edge showing dark brown back lit highlights. Two finger tan creamy head, which recedes to thin cap and ring. Leaves behind some rings of lacing. Aroma of dark roasted malts, coffee, chocolate, black licorice, and dark fruits. Taste is dark roasted malts, which express dark chocolate and dark roast coffee. The dark fruit shows up close to the end. The black licorice is a minor note throughout. Full mouth feel, super creamy. Good carbonation. The alcohol is there but not super strong. This beer is good for sipping but is really quaffable for such a higher ABV%. Excellent overall and great that it needs no adjuncts to bring forth complex smells and flavors. It's a loss that this is no longer brewed.  Bottle Notes: Brewed in the authentic, historical style of an imperial Russian stout, this beer is massive. Intensely aromatic (notes of anise, black currants, coffee, roastiness and alcohol) and heavy on the palate, this brew goes where few can - and fewer dare even try. The style originated from Czarist Russia's demand for ever-thicker English stouts. Expect our version of this mysterious brew to pour like Siberian crude and taste even heavier!  _________________________________________________ 2/14/23 dated review of 'STONE Imperial Stout'  12oz can dated '10/19/22'. Label has ABV% as 10.5%. Black colored body, with very thin red mahogany back lit edge. Quite foamy upon initial pour, but this tan head drops back to mild surface storm and a ring. Aroma of dark roasted malts, molasses, pine tar, and creosote. Taste is dark roasted malts with flavors of cacao and vanilla. Once the initial sweetness sinks, the bitter and piney hops stand tall. Great caramel flavor in the aftertaste. Thick, oily mouth feel. Quiet carbonation. Intense, well accomplished imperial stout (missing the original label that included ""Russian""). With this can, the score for Look goes to 4.0, for Smell goes to 4.5, and for Taste, Feel, and Overall remain at 4.5.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,96

147,1160,Sabtos,4.18,"Stark, syrupy black, this has a deep mocha foam that is still able to persist in a thick creamy collar after three years in a keg.  Chocolatey and rich, this is also woody and slightly bitter with notes of licorice and nutty molasses through a medium-thick body with a semi-dry, sticky finish.  2015 IRS on draft.  ---  In June 2021 I tested the aging challenge on the back of my 2008 bottle, and the results were mind-blowing.  It's chocolate syrup up front, cigar skins in the middle with a little cedary hop and malt acidity, and nutty wafer in the exhale. Its overall bitterness is as pleasantly tempered as it can possibly get at this point, combined with a warming sting on tip of tongue. As it warms, a hint of mocha develops, but so too do notes of Jack & Coke.  The slick but medium body still has a crackly but fine carbonation coming into a powder dry finish.  Other than being nearly still in appearance, I don't know how any signs of oxidation hardly seem to be present here.  ---  Having a 2009 bottle in July 2021, to my surprise I find it a touch more oxidized than the 2008, primarily developing notes of prune and tobacco, while still exhaling wonderful cacao and peanut brittle. It's a dichotomy but it's still overall pleasant, and bitter of mocha liqueur with a finely crisp carbonation.  ---  In late March of 2022, I killed of my last vintage RIS, a 2010--back when bombers of quality RIS were $6.99! While this 12yo does exhibit mild oxidation with some dark fruit and musty cardboard, it is still rather nutty and cedary with touches of cocoa powder and heat. Rating remains unchanged.

147,1160,GarrettB,4.23,"April 9th, 2015 - This is a well aged (7 years) version of the Imperial Russian Stout - a legendary brew by itself. Seven years of meditation have mellowed out the scent, polishing away any malt bitterness or alcohol, leaving only the gentle smell of the woods. The flavor is lusciously smooth, with the lightest glaze of vanilla skating on a sheen of smooth restraint. It's boozy, yet it doesn't taste like it is. There's also a glimmer of steak sauce and soy sauce to plumb into the depths and retrieve some flavor, but the dark magic here is all in the way this beer expresses a great deal of flavor in the most restrained fashion.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,96

It is made up of rich roasted malts, milk chocolate, caramel, bitter black coffee, dark fruits and black licorice  Taste is very similar, but with the addition of a big dose of smokey char that adds a bit more depth.  Feel is full bodied and viscous bordering on chewy. Light carbonation.  Overall this is a great beer. I was not sold on the smell, but as soon as that char hit my palate I changed my tune.

147,1160,Vidblain,4.09,"I've had several bottles of Stone's Imperial Russian Stout over the years, but those generally pre-date my ""serious"" days of beer criticism and enjoyment. So I opened a 2015 to see how my impressions were holding up.  Imperial Russian Stout has been widely venerated for quite some time now - with good reason. It ages well. It has a recipe that has been consistent and well balanced for quite some time. Like many other Russian Imperial Stouts, it is quite heavily hopped - so it has potential to mature over long periods of time, only gaining complexity as the hops become more subdued.  I wish that I had had the forethought to open a comparable Russian Imp alongside Stone's, but here were my impressions: the beer pours quite dark, with a nice head of very light brown foam. It smells quite hoppy still, but also warm and chocolatey. The taste is quite accurate to the smell - the hops are pungent and hit the back of my tongue quite powerfully. Much like Surly Darkness, I found myself wishing that I had aged this for much longer. Those hops hang on forever! Still, the beer has admirable complexity and flavor. The hops are strong and pronounced, but there is still a very pleasant sweetness to it.  I like this beer a lot. I have a 2011 and a 2013 that I have yet to open. My follow-up on those in the future.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,96
147,1160,briandschorr,4.68,"Amazing. I am a big fan of Stouts and Porters and this is one of the best Stouts out there. Moderate dark fruit ester and a wonderful opaque color. I agree with the comments about a significant herbal hop character. The nose is a complex blend of chocolate and caramel with coffee coming through in a subtle way. A wonderful thick foam that breaks down at just the right speed and leaves not much lacing. This is a beer to be enjoyed slowly. For me, it's a step away from a masterpiece.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,96

The lacing was there as it speckled the glass adequately. The smell had a super nice blend of roasted chocolate tones to a slight coffee beans with light vanilla and anise. The taste was very nice as it allowed a super nice sweet and roastiness to invade the tastebuds in a slight boozy pummeling of sorts.

It pours an opaque black with red highlights along with two fingers of dense, mocha head that settles to a cap within two minutes. Poor lacing.  Smell: Strong roasted malts and dark fruit esters right off the bat. Additional malty notes of coffee, black licorice, dark chocolate, and bonfire smokiness. Faint caramel. Hop-wise there's a strong herbal presence. Some mineral and metallic notes have increased during the aging process. I'm also noticing a tiny note of wet cardboard which I attribute to the bottle not always being at the right temperature during the cellaring.  Taste: Strong, rich, and bitter. Roasty-burnt dark malts with notes of coffee, dark chocolate, and licorice. Moderate dark fruit esters. Just like in the nose, there is a significant herbal hop character that shoots through the malts. The finish is long, strong, and warming.  Feel: Full body with medium-light carbonation.

Smell - Sweet chocolate malts comes through in the nose.  Taste - The sample was a 2010 vintage. It was like a riverbof smooth chocolate. Any bitterness seems to have gone away with age.  Mouthfeel - The carbonation was very modest which allowed the sweetness to shine.  Overall- If this beer were released differently, it would be a whale.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,96

Aroma is huge, dark, and complex, with notes of caramel, earthy barley, and bread malts. Flavor profile is dark and complex. Notes of caramel, peat moss, earthy barley, and bready malts form a filling, huge, experience of a stout. Mouth feel is filling, thick, with a consistent graininess to it. Overall, this beer packs a presence. It's huge and dark all the way around. A very earthy, and simple, but tasty flavor profile combined with a huge, but not over compensating, presence relegates this beer to an excellent sipper.

Smell: Heavy aroma of dark fruits on the nose along with some chocolate, coffee, and roasted malts.  Taste: Notes of licorice, dark fruits, chocolate, coffee, and maybe a hint of alcohol burn but this is smooth for the ABV.  Feel: Medium to heavy bodied.  Overall: This is one of the best Russian Imperial Stouts that I have had. Disappointed this beer is not being brewed for a 2017 release as I would have definitely picked up a case again.

T: Coffee again, chocolate, licorice, fruity esters, smoke. Wonderfully complex, you go through a train ride of flavors where the alcohol isn't too overpowering even at 10.6% which is insane.

147,1160,Everydayoff,4.46,"650ml bottle poured into a sniffer. This one is 2016 release.  Very deep brown to almost black with some reddish tinge as a showcase, the pour forms up thick creamy tan head that stands proud against the time with good retention before slowly subsiding to some long-lasting bubble sheet on the surface. It doesn’t go anywhere until the last sip. There are plenty of sticky lacing patches and spots left on the glass-side.  Wide varieties in a nose comprising of dark chocolate, crème brûlée, espresso coffee, cocoa, caramel, dark bread, molasses, vanilla, some oaky bourbon, a little bit smoky, and deep roasted with some astringency. There is also subtle ester reminding of black currant and a bit berries tart as a compliment to add some complexity. The aroma is very aromatic especially when it started to warm and opened.  Bittersweet dark chocolate is the most prominent and conquered the taste buds at first, then followed and mingled by crème brûlée, espresso coffee, cocoa, caramel, dark bread, molasses, vanilla, some oaky bourbon, a little bit smoky, and strong roasted with much astringency comparing to the aroma. Hop tries to intervene in the middle with some fruity notes of sour berries and slight black currant. Alcohol heat is there a bit subtlety at the almost end while the end is mixed up by its big sweetness, roasted bitterness and astringency that also leave a long tail in the aftertaste.  The body is full yet rather syrupy with medium carbonation that is considered as crisp enough and suitable to carry all the things well under the smooth palate, very dry finish.  This one is very direct and solid without doubt. Do not underestimate its strength even the booziness is not fully pronounced being tastefully balanced by its rich roasted malty goodness, great sipping brew and perfect to enjoy as the last glass or as the dessert of the session.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,96

Pours thick and opaque with just under an inche of khaki colored head, tight and small bubbles and some lacing. Looks exactly how you'd expect a good Russian Imperial Stout to look in the glass. Smell is huge on roasted character, dark chocolate, coffee, and caramel and brown sugar. Knocked it out of the park on that! Taste follows suit, with bold, aggressive, yet loving layers of burnt sugars, dark, dark malts, some toffee, a very slight hop bite, and the tiniest touch of booze in the finish. Fantastic, and once again, exactly what you'd expect from an awesome Russian Imperial Stout. Feel is full bodied, chewy AF, smooth and luxurious, coating the palate in all of the many layers of flavors this baby brings to the party. Overall, I'm impressed all around. Not just with the beer itself, but also with the fact that it was affordable, found at a place that does not usually stock stuff this good, and that Stone, a brewery I know mostly for their hop-forward IPAs, could nail the style so well. Layers and layers of flavor, found at a pretty basic grocery store and for a good price? Sign me the hell up! A rare 5/5, for me!",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,96

Drink heavy while coating the palate. Moderately bitter. Alcohol is warming not harsh.  Overall: A solid Russian Imperial Stout. It's big, heavy, and complex.

The aroma is rich and melded together into a single roasty aroma. Lots of coffee and bitter chocolate. The first drink surprises me at how smooth and soft and incredibly rich it can be. Layers of caramelized roast, brown sugar, cocoa powder, coffee grounds. It is almost fluffy in the mouth with medium carbonation. Verges on sticky-sweet but never crosses the line on either account.

Aroma of roast, slight coffee, tiny amounts of anise spice, slight hoppiness, and plenty of dark chocolate. Taste reflects the smell. Initial sips reveal coffee and malt roastiness, dark chocolate, and a not over the top hoppiness. Retro-nasal reveals more of the anise and dark fruit (plum) characteristics of the beer. Feel is thick, with moderate carbonation as to not be flat, which fits the heavier notes on this beer. Overall, this is an amazing beer.

Aroma hits hard in the alcohol, roast and chocolate malt category.  Taste makes me think it is more on par with an American Imperial Stout moreso than Russian, the dark fruit notes just aren't there, the hopping is pretty damn big, so you get more of a hop based bitterness opposed to the yeast in a Russian version. This stuff is so chewy and covers the alcohol so nicely.  I realize that adjuncts and barrels are all the rage these days, but this is a remarkably consistent old school straight up no frills stout that is affordable and widely distributed.

I was soooo glad a cold front blew through because I didn't want to experience this while sweating like a hooker waiting for a blood test. Granted this should be imbibed in the dead of winter while reading Tolstoy and listening to Shostakovich but allowances have been made.  The color is as dark as Rasputin's soul with very little head. The smell was oddly muted with no hint of the licorice and molasses taste, along with other tastes, which struggle heroically to hide the alc. It felt great too. Honestly I can't think of a thing Stone should do differently.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,96

Smell is initially boozy, but notes of unroasted coffee beans, roasted malts, dates and prunes come through. Unique smell for a Imperial Russian stout.  Taste is roasted malts with notes of dates, prunes, giving way to a bitter finish that has some notes of what I can only describe as black licorice. Not a ton of sweetness in this, and its pretty dry. Bit of a boozy flavor coming through on the back end. Nice balance between the flavors and bitterness even if it comes across as a bit hoppy for a Russian Imperial stout.  Feel is very hefty but smooth. Mild carbonation, but the boozy finish keeps a nice tingle on the tongue.  Overall a very good beer from Stone, but not the best example of the Russian Imperial Stout. Still a very good beer in its own right.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,96
147,1160,Gajo74,4.59,"Had it on tap at Beer Shop and Tasting Table NYC. It poured a dark and thick black with a nice tan and mocha colored head. The aroma is comprised of mostly of roasted malts, chocolate, coffee and alcohol. The taste aligns with the aroma. Overall, a chocolate sweetness coats the tongue. This is balanced by a slightly bitter roasted malt and coffee, as well as an alcohol finish that also has a bit of licorice. This beer truly has great balance; sweet but not cloying, bitter but not astringent, alcoholic but not boozy. My favorite thing about it is the feel. It is full bodied but bordering on medium, thus, making it extremely drinkable. I had the pleasure of drinking KBS the night before and it was interesting to compare these two. I put this one right up there with the great stouts, and unlike the KBS which almost defies category, this one feels beer like and is more accessible.

All I really get are normal, actually average stouts smells of grains, beer smells. I don't get any chocolate, coffee, or anything interesting. Look: oilly black, hardly any carbonation except for directly after it was poured and there was a 2 inch head. The head is the most dark brown I have ever seen on a stout. taste: it is honestly just like a regular stout taste of malted barley, then a bitter finish with lots of boozeyness to it. I thought the aftertaste was actually pretty bad. It's like a dry finish with a ton of booze burn. I hate the bitterness. It's not a good bitterness that I typically find in stouts that I like. The burn on it is almost like the burn from a glass of vodka. Not smooth at all. In fact the buzz is going right to my head, past the midway point of the bottle. It is weird because there are so many good reviews of this stout. They always say that you can't taste the alcohol, but I really tasted it right on the finish. That is the worst part of it is that nasty alcohol burn that lies on the back end. It's like having an o.k. stout that kicks you in the ass at the end like you just drank grain alcohol. I need a freaking chaser, or something! I hate to say this about a Stone beer, but that is just how it is. I usually love Stone stuff, not this right now.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,96
147,1160,BB1313,3.96,"32oz growler filled at Heinen's in Shaker Hts., Ohio  2016 vintage. Growler poured into a snifter. Pours black with a mocha head that fades leaving solid retention and little lacing. The aromas are full of chocolate and cocoa malts. It smells like a chocolate chip cookie. Subtle hints of anise in the mix along with some dark fruits. The aromas might not be overwhelming, but they're not bad at all. The flavors are very bold. Lots of chocolate. Lots of dark fruits, especially raisins. Hints of vanilla and caramel. More subtle hints of anise. This isn't really a bitter or hoppy stout, which is just fine by me. Very robust. It's slightly warm, but it's absolutely not hot or boozy. Alcohol is well hidden. Mouthfeel is full-bodied, but isn't heavy at all. Carbonation is active. It's not thick like a milkshake or anything, but still has a nice body to it. It's very smooth and dangerously drinkable.  This is a really nice Imperial Stout. It's not flashy, but just bold and traditional to the style. The craftsmanship is very impressive. Well done. Very enjoyable.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,96
147,1160,BrokenEdge,4.41,"This particular bottle was just barely a month old when I drank it so I'm eager to try one with some more age on it and see how it develops. Appearance is damn near perfect for a RIS, nearly black in body with a thick tan head. Pours thick, not the thickest stout I've seen but close. Smells kind of like toasted nuts, dark chocolate, and a little coffee. Flavor is awesome. In addition to dark chocolate and dark roasted coffee: licorice, raisins, vanilla, smoke, leather, whiskey, etc. Alcohol is just slightly detectable especially as it warms, but it isn't unpleasant or harsh. Feel is a tad on the thin side, but not awfully so. Still feels full and smooth as it goes down, with a lingering finish with flavors that continue to develop on the palate. The reputation of this beer is well deserved and I'll be buying more while it's in season!",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,96
147,1160,dcscientist,4.23,"Once again Stone shows that they know what they're doing. This is an excellent beer, just as heavy and intense as advertised. Got pretty much every flavor and aroma that was mentioned in the description, then decided to stop worrying about that and just enjoy it. Great on a wintry weekend when you're staying home. Would definitely like to buy another and age it for a while, but that means I'd have to wait to drink it.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,96
147,1160,jaypaul522,4.12,"Poured very dark with a big head. Aroma was chocolate, malts, and some fruit - maybe raisins or plums. The taste is complex, and very strong with a finish where the alcohol shows through but not unpleasantly. Overall, a very good stout.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,96
147,1160,DylCarta,4.25,It's boozy and it's thick but it's an imperial stout so what do you expect. I poured it cold and let it sit a few minutes then drank it and let the buzz creep in. Definitely worth the try if you like stouts or anything by Stone Brewing.,Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,96
147,1160,kalosjakar,4.25,"Pours pitch black with a slightly darker than tan head. Big and foamy.  A big aroma of chocolate, roasted malts, and maybe figs or raisins. A belgian-esque aroma to this.  A fairly thick mouthfeel but not huge.  Good roast character up front in the flavor. Slight chocolate flavor comes through as the roasted notes fade. A faint nuttiness in the finish.  The roasted malts arent overpowering, allowing this stout to have a moderate sweetness, almost milk chocolate-like.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,96

147,1160,Brolo75,4.35,"22 ounce bomber poured into a snifter. This is a review of 2015 Stone RIS  A: Pours black with a mocha colored head, no head retention, some slight lacing, nice creamy collar after the head died down, low carbonation, no light comes through.  A: Dark coffee, dark fruits like plums and figs, roasted malts, slight aroma of alcohol coming through, pretty solid aroma.  T: Has aged well, touch of espresso up front, moderate coffee like bitterness in the middle, finishes with dark fruits that linger in the aftertaste, well balanced and the ABV is well-hidden.  M: Oil like mouthfeel, while heavy, not as heavy as other RIS, dry coffee like finish with a good amount of carbonation to add some mouthfeel, solid.  O: Not mind blowing, but very good, outstanding, good balance of espresso and dark fruits, oil like mouthfeel, definitely going to pick up another bottle or two for the cellar.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,96
147,1160,tekstr1der,4.67,"Pours inky black with half-finger of brown foam, almost as viscous as Ten Fidy. Promising start! Aroma is surprisingly mellow - just mild toasted malt and a faint nutty-sweet. Taste is amazing, beginning with a blast of roast, semisweet in the middle, never harsh or over-bitter. Mouthfeel is medium, much lighter than expected. Finishes a slight bitter begging for another sip. This stuff has danger written all over it. 2nd favorite by only a slight margin.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,96

147,1160,zshaft,4.29,pour from bomber into flute glass. freaking black as night. almost like looking into a black mirror. head dissipates quickly. nose is dark roasty malts with licorace. taste is lucky booze up front with lithinner mouthfeel than expected. burnt toast with some candy sweetness mid palate. sight wiskey taste in the end palate but masked by some coco and vanilla flavors. nice warming sensation as it goes down. ive had this beer before and prefer the espresso version. but this is a great russian stout with tons ofcomplex layers to it. mouthfeel to me is a little thin but great beer.,Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,96
147,1160,claminat420,4.47,2011 bomber into my imperial stout glass.  Appearance- from a hardy pour it's the typical stout black with a frothy beige head that leaves some heavy lacing. poster child of stouts.  Aroma- a weird dark malt with a wiff of some hops. different and good. not boozy.  Taste- get some dark malts but balanced by hops. It feels like both sides battled and just left a taste of impartial stout goodness. alcohol is not detected. has a smoothness like a milk stout. slight chocolate with a slight dark fruit/ raisiny taste. has a bitterness that balances shit out. alcohol is well hidden which is great for 10+ abv. detecting a slight hint of vanilla.  Mouthfeel- very slick. medium to heavy bodied. just awesome.  Drinkability- it would be wise to buy a case of this and occasionally drink them here and there. keep a few for down the road.  Overall- I don't know if it's just because it's aged for awhile but it's sooo slick. the slickness almost tricks you thinking it's light bodied. you do get the chocolate/dark fruit/ raisiny taste. has a smoothness like a milk stout. to be fair i'm no way a stout fan. 10 out of 10 times i'm going with an ipa but for some whacky chance I feel stout(or imperial) this one would be a great choice.,Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,96
147,1160,mwilbur,4.47,"Poured on-tap at the Escondido brewery into tulip. A: Pours extremely dark brown-black with 1/4 inch dark mocha head with good retention. S: Dry dark chocolate, cacao nibs, vanilla, whiskey, and a hint of molasses. T: Dark bittersweet chocolate, cacao nibs, whiskey, leather, molasses,vanilla, and a hint of dark honey. M: Heavy body, yet delicately sweet. Drinks a bit lighter than ABV. Decadent and deep. Lingers and matures nicely on the palate. D: An outstanding brew! Hits all the right notes and is ten times more drinkable than most RISs. Well done, Stone!",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,96
147,1160,ebin6,4.54,"I feel I must demarcate this beer:  Fresh: Kinda hot, but there's an underlying smoothness. The chocolaty flavors that shine with some age don't yet dominate. Fairly hoppy for an IRS/RIS.  Aged (~3 years): The bite smooths out, the chocolate notes shine through, and a sublime beer for aging commences. While I consider Bell's Expedition the premier RIS for aging, Stone's in only a hair behind.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,96

Tons of cling to the side of the glass.  Nose: this thing is just pouring off dark fruit notes from the moment I opened the bottle. Raising, prunes, figs, cocoa, fruitcake, massive dried fruit, cherry  Taste: hit of bitterness in the front leads to all of those dried fruits, cherry, raisins, prunes, figs, plums, spice cake, fruitcake, middle is chewy with more fruit, finish is a bit boozy with a lingering roasty and bakers chocolate bit. Very nice.  Overall: fruit bomb here. I can't believe all of the dried dark fruits in there. It reminds me of an aged Samuel Smith Imperial Stout with all the fruit but more intensified. That is high praise. I do feel like Samuel Smith's is more balanced but this is still an excellent beer.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,96
147,1160,FFreak,4.66,"Purchased at the Bevie several months ago, can't remember the price. Bottling date is 2/2015. Pours the typical high ABV stout black, dark as night, with a nice coffee-with-cream colored head, about an inch high, that hangs on for a good while. The smell that first hit me was licorice, followed by dark chocolate, molasses, and dark roast malt. Taste drops the licorice, but is heavy with dark chocolate and sweet dark sugar. Not a lot of bitterness here, but still doesn't come off as cloying at all. Mouth is about perfect for a big ol' stout, viscous, silky, medium-full bodied, but goes down pretty easy. Overall, a great RIS (IRS?). Way to go Stone!",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,96
147,1160,Trevor11,4.75,"Like a fine dessert. Stone's Imperial Russian Stout stands up among the best of them.

Taste is dark chocolate, boozy candied dark fruits, caramel, mild smoke and roasted coffee notes, anise, toasted graham crackery malt, molasses, brown sugar, some vanilla, with woody earthy herbal grassy pine.

147,1160,SitkaSteve,4.22,"This was poured into a nonic pint glass. The appearance was a black color with a thick dark tan colored head. Dissipated slowly and evenly. A nice amount of lacing roamed the glass. The smell had a faint coffee/chocolate over some black licorice. The taste was sweet and roasty with nice bitter coffee beans delicately weaving into the aftertaste and coming across with a dry finish. The mouthfeel was about medium bodied with a good sipping quality and a low carbonation subjugating my tongue with roasty and bitter feels. Overall, glad I have another in my cellar and am looking forward to next Spring's coming out.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,96
147,1160,Wiffler27,4.44,"pours black with a thick dark-cream colored head. nice looking in the glass!  smell is faint but still exists. smells of coffee/chocolate. not a bad smell just not a strong scent.  tastes like coffee. nice roast to it. very smooth.  this goes down very easy and smooth which makes this dangerous at 10.6%!  overall this is a really good beer. one of my favorite RIS' instantly! Ten Fidy has more character and is better, IMO, this is a close 2nd. very smooth and easy to drink, i have one aging in my cellar as well. excited to see how easy that will be to drink.  --------------------------------------------------------------  a 2015 bottle that's been in my cellar for a good long while.  still pours jet black with a solid head, looks damn nice.  smell is very sweet, lots of vanilla with slight coffee  taste is fantastic, very creamy and sweet. tons of vanilla and easy to drink. not sure if i notice (or remember) a huge difference in the aged bottles. this was always an easy drinker but the aged version is much more mellow and creamy",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,96
147,1160,HopHunter19,4,"Beer pours dark brown-black with a nice mocha head that dissipates pretty quickly. Smell is a nice coffee, chocolate, dark roasty malts but also a little hop character in there - pine/grapefruit. Taste follows the nose, with coffee, chocolate, dark roasty bitterness, but then also a bitter hop character in addition. Mouthfeel is medium-heavy, alc is covered, aftertaste is roasty coffee, dark malts. Overall I think the extra hop character is detracting a little bit from this beer, if you put it next to other RIS's it almost tastes like a black IPA. Especially when this bottle has been sitting for 7 months - bottled 3/7/2015 drank 10/11/2015.  Update: now drinking a bottle bottled 3/7/2015 on 4/3/2016, and an extra 6 months makes this much smoother, the hop character is less present and the roastiness has smoothed out",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,96

Booze is fairly strong.  Taste is heavenly. Deep, dark chocolate malts, heavily roasted, with a gob of molasses on the finish.  Very easy drinking for a RIS. Could easily drink a few of these.  Overall, definitely worth the hype.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,96
147,1160,Viaduck,4.09,"Pours almost black with a short lived brown head. Smells like yeast, bread, a little malt & chocolate. Tastes like a Starbucks mocha Java, a bit sweet, with a slight alcohol aftertaste. I like it. Very good.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,96

Nutmeg  T- A touch light on the coffee and chocolate. It's there but mild compared to you big ones like Ten Fidy. Don't get me wrong this one is nice but not stellar. A bit spicier than most RIS's which I like.  M- A touch thin for an RIS. Would like to see some thickening up to get this rating up a bit  O- Very good RIS. I like it but when I go 4-5hrs to a different country to get only 24 beer I got to make them good selections and this one falls outside that level. It's good and if available in Canada for under $9.00 I would by it again.  Food Pairing  This nice brew went very well with....... A nice selection of cheese I found at the grocery store. Some Havarti for a creamy one, blue with a TON of blue in it as another, oka with mushrooms as a third and emmenthal from over the pond as a forth. This RIS pounded through all of these cheeses and the crackers and honey cleansed the pallet well.  Enjoy",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,96

S: I was surprised at the lack of initial smell. Once I got down into the beer, I got stronger notes of toffee and chocolate with only slight hints of toast.  T: Drinks easily for an RIS, a mouthful of well-balanced flavors try to cover the huge alcohol presence in this beer and almost pull it off.  M: Full, rich and velvety but lacking the weight that screams ""big beer"", this is an easy-drinking Imperial Stout.  O: This beer is wonderfully dangerous. At 10.6% but lacking the big alcohol flavor, I can see myself cruising on the great flavor and not worry about the consequences.

Bottle mentions notes of roast, dark fruit, chocolate, coffee reminiscent of the style, however the 2 years age on this vintage has made that very hard to detect on the nose. Taste is definitely there, but lacking in the coffee entirely by this point.

147,1160,Colorado_Stout,4.66,"I will admit to having gone to the ""packy"" to get a few bombers of this nasty brew. But, the best, the VERY best way to experience this brew, is to brew it yourself. Get one of those ""Clone Brew"" magazines and brew this up yourself. The difference is amazing. It is SO FRESH that this will not only be the best brew you ever made, it will be the Best Brew you EVER TASTED. Try it. And, the 10% ABV will only add to the mysterious, coffee, chocolate, currant deep rich taste on your palate. This is what God thought of when he thought up beer.

Sweet, bitter chocolate, roasted malt, and strong coffee-bean flavors on the nose. Light notes of vanilla and toffee accompany. Medium-heavy weight, and very dense and creamy. Loads of bitter chocolate and expresso up front with a mild sweetness setting in middleways. An awesome blance of roasted malt sees this one through to the end. The aftertaste is composed of strong, toasty malt, bittered chocolate, and intense coffee.  Overall, an excellent example of the style with a little added sweetness.

147,1160,1000lbgrizzly,4.13,"A: Looks like a good RIS.  S: Mostly heavily roasted malt with a tiny touch of hops in the background.  T: I'm surprised this doesn't have any mentioned additives besides necessary been ingredients; the flavors are very pronounced and realistic. Coffee is primary with mild acidity and all, with chocolatey roasted malt right behind it, and some lactose-like sweetness to finish it off. Some alcohol comes through late-palate.  F: Not as thick as was promised on the bottle, but full bodied. Thick and a little fatty, like a heavy cream. I still want thicker ( ;) ), but nice job.  O: I'm surprised Stone, for all their independence and devil-may-care attitude and adrenaline-seeking extremism, would make their representation of a Russian Imperial Stout, the heaviest, manliest, most goddamn off-putting black sludge a brewmaster could summon from the bowels of Satan Himself (All Praise and Worship to He the Unholy), kinda sweet, but I jived with it, yo.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,96

147,1160,DaverCS,4.69,"Pours motor oil black with 1 fingers of carmel colored head.  Aroma yields coffee, burnt toffee, toasty malt, tobacco, and a slight citrus note.  Taste follows the nose. Big roasty notes from start to finish. Big burnt coffee and sugar. I get a mild kick of hop bitterness at the end, which makes the beer incredibly drinkable. No alcohol detected!  Overall, this is a fantastic RIS. It lives up to its name. I would see this pairing well with some s'mores by a campfire on a cold winter evening. It gets a 94/100.     ***update and aged review*** Stone RIS 2012 on tap at SD toronado. 6 years old!  Pitch black with almost no head  Aroma is of sweet molasses, charred oak, burnt coffee  Subtle taste but still a moderate-aggressive bitter roast character. More coffee and bitter cocoa.

Carbonation is minimal. Alcohol warmth is high but not sharp or solventy. Finish: Roasted chocolate and alcohol linger long past the swallow. Overall: Fine imperial stout. Rich chocolate and roast backbone, with layers of complexity. This is a freshly bottled version.

For 10.6% ABV, you do not notice much of the alcohol, which is pleasant. This is a great nightcap beer, good for a lazy night in.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,96

Stone has created another massive brew with highlight s of anise,currant,coffee, roasted malt with just enough bottle conditioning carefully hidden in one heavy weight contender coming in on the scales at just under 11 percent %.  Bargain to find at the grocery outlet store for $7.50+ tax for a 22 oz bomber.  Huge booming rich and so satisfying did not need or even think about opening a second bottle. Classic warming shared with chocolate lava cake for dessert.  I have tasted a few better but also paid steeply for the privelege such as Ale Smith speedway stout coming in at $75.00 and all the sub varieties of the coffees and bourbon barrel aging etc did not impress me to the point Ale smith was worth the &5 bucks +.  Stone another San Diego brewer should be proud of their hard work following old school authentic methods to create this heavenly brew .

Minimal carbonation and smooth.  O: I wanted to like this beer more, as I'm a big fan of the Gargoyle and their arrogant brews. Big time roasted malts and coffee flavors, but the spiciness put me off a bit. This may be on account of the tap not having been properly cleaned. I'll be picking up a bomber and doing a re-sample at the earliest opportunity.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,96
147,1160,dmgeng,4.69,"I've had this in 2013 but didn't get a bottle last year and with so many beer since then I knew this was good but could exactly pin down where this ranked until I'm reviewing and drinking a 2015 (2 months in bottle.)  A - Deep dark brown that settles into a dark black. It pours thick with a medium brown rocky head and good lacing.  S - Tons of of sweet malt smell with roast, chocolate, caramel, some smoke, and some coffee notes radiating out. There is not a single aroma that is overpowering but blends nicely. Not the strongest smelling RIS but has everything it should.  T - This beer evolves in the mouth with a rich malt character that is sweet and chocolaty on the front then quickly goes into more caramel, coffee, and light smoke. Towards the end there is the bitterness you would expect and desire with roast, bitter coffee, bitter chocolate, and some herbal bitterness. Again nothing is over the top and is quite balanced for the depth of flavor. This beer rolls across the palate and you can discern it all, which to me is the hallmark of a great beer.  M - High mouth-feel with perfect carbonation. Good balance between sweet and bitter and overall mouth-feel which again makes this beer a terrific representation of the style.  Overall, this is one of the best examples of a Russian Imperial Stout you can find. Great breadth of flavor, great balance, and low cost make this one a seasonal that you should get at least once a year. I know that there are more unique, richer, and overall tastier version of the style but yet again Stone was one of the forefathers of the craft beer movement and for years this was the best representation of great beer that could be found coast-to-coast.

147,1160,porter_collie,4.49,"Poured 22 oz. bottle of 2014 vintage into brandy snifter  A - Pours viscous and oily. The body is a virtually opaque dark, dark brown. The only real head to speak of is a thin rim of frothy cappuccino-colored foam along the sides of the glass. Tiny bubbles form an oil slick across the top of the beer. Scattered speckles of lacing with accompanying legs.  S - The odor is strongly reminiscent of dark dried fruits - a menagerie of figs, prunes, and raisins. These fruity esters are supplemented with a hearty dose of caramel and cold-brew coffee. A touch of grain alcohol sweetness, too.  A - A specter of smokey coffee teases the tongue before dissolving into a full blown manifestation of caramel and fig sweetness. The sweetness borders on cloying, but is delightfully balanced by tobacco, dark chocolate, and vanilla notes. The sweetness slow burns to the finish along with a mild burn from the alcohol.  M - Sticky, chewy, and oily with minimal carbonation. Nearly perfect.  O - A great Russian Imperial Stout. I honestly think I preferred it without a year of aging - the raw intensity of the sweetness is offset by more coffee and chocolate notes in a fresh version of this beer. Nonetheless, a real treat!",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,96

As it warms up a citrus hop flavor is noticeable in the middle.  Feel- Full bodied, low carbonation, and a creamy texture.  Overall- Pretty straightforward beer with roasted malt and dark chocolate dominating the flavor. Overall, its a solid IRS but nothing spectacular.

147,1160,teromous,3.78,"Appearance: Oil black body with a thin khaki head that fades quickly to a ring and a few rafts of bubbles. Some minor spots but no real lacing.  Aroma: There isn't much aroma here. I am picking up a light charred scent like the inside of a coffee pot that has been left on the burner. I also pick up a strong alcohol aroma, which isn't a surprise given the 10.6% ABV.  Taste: I want to point out first that this beer doesn't have any overwhelmingly strong flavors, which really is its strong point. It is very enjoyable to drink because of this. I pick up some faint sweet caramel and roasted coffee, then there is a bit of pine and a woody character like a strong tea. I do get an alcohol flavor in this beer but it marries well with the flavor. Everything is mellowed out without feeling washed out.  Mouthfeel: It has a really good mouthfeel. It's thick when I start drinking the beer, but it doesn't feel sticky or linger on the palate too long. It does a good job of delivering flavor on a nice thick tide that ebbs away leaving pure aftertaste.  Overall: It is a very good Russian Imperial Stout, especially if you're not looking for something over the top. It delivers a wealth of flavors without crushing your palate to the point that you get tired of the beer. It is definitely a beer that you can sit back and enjoy an entire bomber of. I do wish it had more aroma, but there's no doubt that I enjoyed this beer.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,96

Smell is the best part of this beer in my opinion. Initial aroma is dark roast coffee and hazelnut. Also coco and toasted malts to give some grain aroma to the scent.  Taste is very rich coffee and dark chocolate. Really no bitterness at all with this beer. Malts add a nice grain flavor. I'm also getting a nice sweetness like raspberry and mango. The sweetness gives it really good balance.  Feel is string as well. Flavors coat the mouth and stick to the palate for several min. Each sip is smooth and full flavor.

Went home chilled two bottles and put one in the cellar. I get a lot of chocolate its kind of nice. Sipping on a glass of it right now, well watching March Madness, what could be better?",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,96
147,1160,Beer-Revelry,4.78,"Poured into a Duvel snifter glass.  A - 4.75 - Poured jet black in color. Formed about a finger of medium/dark tan colored head. Head subsides down to a film. Impressive head potential and retention for the ABV and the viscosity. Spotty, almost nonexistent lacing. S - 4.75 - Bitter chocolate, sweet chocolate, light touches of vanilla and coffee. The nose to me is dominated by licorice, anise and a medicinal, herbal aroma. This is what I've found to be traditional of the style and as such, it smells amazing. T - 5 - I can't believe how well balanced this is for how potent it is. The malty sweetness, and the bitterness at the end are balanced perfectly. Has lots of malt, chocolate, some raisin, licorice and that slight medicinal herbal twang all good Russian's have. Surprisingly, the alcohol in this is WELL hidden. F - 4.25 - Definitely a decent, thicker creamy mouthfeel, but not the viscosity of crude oil that was promised on the bottle. Have definitely had thicker before. O - 4.75 - This is a damned fine imperial Russian stout. Probably the most balanced I've ever had and one of the best in general. Reminds me A LOT of Oskar Blue's Ten Fidy. Is it the best ever? No. Is it worth buying, stocking up on and cellaring? Hell yes. This is a stout lover's dream beer and I HIGHLY recommend it to fans of the style.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,96

147,1160,infinitebruner,3.83,"March 5, 2015  22 oz bomber, snifter  A – Jet black and fairly viscous/oily, very dark brown lacing on top, just a thin layer that disappears quickly.  S – Very high roasted component with some vanilla and alcohol warmth on the nose. Hops seem to be earthy, and somewhat piney. A good dose of bitterness at the end.  T – High vanilla component, with only moderate roast flavors, and some bittersweet chocolate. Hops provide bitterness mostly, with a piney, woodsy flavor underneath.  M – Moderately low carbonation and medium-bodied, a moderate amount of residual sweetness but balanced hard towards bitterness, both from roasted malt and from hops. Mild alcohol warmth, very subdued.  O – Not as heavy as I expected, and a nice combination of roasty and sweet components. Solid.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,96
147,1160,marieli,4.27,"Draft. A very pretty beer, close to black with a nice tan head. Dark chocolate ruled smell and taste with underlying coffee and roasted malts. Not much fruit. Slight bitterness. At 11% the alcohol makes itself known, but okay. Not as thick or creamy as expected or hoping. A good beer but some creaminess and smoothing out would definitely kick it up a notch for my taste.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,96
147,1160,WoostaBia,4.5,"Awesome beer. Has a thinner body than I expected for an imperial stout. Smells of molasses, balsamic vinegar, caramel, coffee and dark chocolate.

Very drinkable.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,96

Easy drinking IRS and a big winner from Stone!",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,96
147,1160,ptykozoon,3.51,"2009 Pours pretty close to jet black, no head left and the thinnest frothy circle around the glass.  A lot of dark fruit - raisins, plum. Cinnamon, dark chocolate, brown sugar.  Taste is bitter coffee and dark chocolate. Smoky cinnamon. Abrasive.  Mouthfeel is crisper than I'd prefer for a beer of this type, very light and airy. ABV tastes around 10%.  I am not sure if the years have really added to the taste. Still a good beer but a bit rough around the edges. It could use more fruit or delicacy to balance out the heat and harshness.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,96
147,1160,NateF90,4.11,"2014 release poured into a Samuel Smith pint glass. Espresso crema-colored head suck around for the entire session. Alcohol and malt on the nose. Taste again is booze forward, but quickly yields to macerated fruits, mild tobacco, and chocolate chip cookie. Mouthfeel wasn't as heavy or viscous as expected... Undecided as to whether that's a good thing or not. Excellent stout but not as 'turned up' as I had hoped. Maybe some extended aging would change the profile? Will try again.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,96

After 3-4 sips the palate is coated with fuzz, tends to hide the first taste flavors. All in all a good brew. Sweet tasting after the first sips and the alcohol burn isn't there. Great stout by a great brewery. Stone should do a collaboration with valiant or black market. Or do a triple collaboration with those two. Amazing what collaborations do to an already fantastic stout. Two thumbs up.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,96

147,1160,polloenfuego,4.21,"Pours a deep mahogany/black with a good thumb of head. The head breaks fairly slowly and there is decent lacing apparent as the beer goes down. The smell is a nice medley of roasts and cocoa along with some vanilla and a nice light leather. The taste carries through the nose, with the roasts dominating and the cocoa bitterness coming in. Again there is a taste of leather present and it really goes well with the other flavors. Feel is nice, full and a bit thick, but also a little creamy. Carbonation is medium.  A nice beer, sometimes I find Stone beers a little too forceful with the hops, but this is a nice RIS that is easy to enjoy over a while while watching the snow fall.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,96

147,1160,CraftBeerApprentice,4.9,"I've had this beer twice: once fresh, and a second time aged 7 months. Pours like tar from the bottle, so you get this ridiculously thick, BLACK liqiuid with a brown head stubborn to form due to the thickness and low carbonation. Smells of dark fruit, burnt coffee, chocolate, and, to my nose, a subtle peanut butter note. The fresh beer had this prominent black coffee taste with a licorice note elevated by a pleasantly hearty booze note. Aged seven months, there's a little more malt and the booze calms down a bit. The mouthfeel is fat and full, as should be expected from this style since it flows like syrup (or beerup as my friend jokingly calls it). Overall, I'm really enjoy this beer. I rated it strongly because I generally don't like hot beer but the warmth of this ale just helps it taste better.

T - Follows the nose with the addition of black licorice/anise, some char, dark chocolate, dark fruit (but buried), and alcohol effervescence.  M - Full medium body, slippery, moderate warming on the way down, lip smacking sticky, lingering dark chocolate bitterness.  O - Very solid.

147,1160,archyquaffer,4.49,"This is a 2014 offering. A moderate pour from a bomber into a schooner glass produces a subdued pale tan head of less than a half inch. The beer appears very viscous during the pour, and appears very nearly black- the light from a mini Maglite doesn't even penetrate.  The aroma-flavor is very malty and estery, with a plethora of dark fruit, molasses, port wine and dark bread notes. There's also a touch of chocolate in there, but not a lot of roasted grain bitterness. A base of earthy hops provides balance and some citrus notes along the edges, but it's not ridiculously hopped. Some alcohol warming is apparent but no bite. In general, its rich and flavorful, with a full-throated flavor and mouthfeel.  This is a world-class beer and definitely better than another domestic offering that I tried recently, which was soooooo bitter and practically undrinkable. This beer restores my faith in the style.

T: The alcohol burn was there, it was pleasant. Also sweet undertones, again raisins, blackberries maybe.  M: Very smooth and (just barely) a full body beer.

Probably overpriced and definitely well-traveled, I picked up a few to take with me, a bit of Southern California by way of Vladivostok to Ethiopia.  I read the label's warnings reminding me that this was gonna pout like black strap molasses, which it did, into probably the most non-Stout-friendly glass there ever was. Not to worry. With the 22 ounces divided over about three 7-ounce pours, it was a blessing in disguise, allowing me to collect my thoughts before the next round of self-annihilation.  It poured Black with a minimal brownish head allowing for a Chocolate aroma to whiff out into the still Ethiopian air. At 6%, there is a surprisingly strong taste of alcohol, and at an elevation of over 2,000 meters in the world's third highest capital, it hits you like a Czar on an African land grab.  The taste is complex, to say the least, and although not a beer that pairs well with particularly anything in East Africa, it fit the bill on its own accord, drank with nothing but the accompanying of music on a Wednesday afternoon. The mouthfeel is not as bitter as I was expecting, a rather smoove ride from lip to belly and back up to the Temple.  Overall an absolutely amazing treat to behold in Ethiopia, and I imagine as good as its gonna get over the course of the next nine months here.

Flavors are heavily roasted grains, dark bakers chocolate, dark rich coffee, to the front and sides, with vanilla and coffee on the aftertaste and fantastic warmth from the alcohol rounding it out.

147,1160,humuloner22,4.57,"I don't know why but for some reason after all the stouts, imperial stouts, etc., that I have drank this one had escaped me. I found this one in a hell of a deal a while back in the four pack of bombers. I have heard this one aged out well and considering its getting into stout season for me, I thought I would crack this one open.  Color: Like black as night, you cant get any darker than this one. Poured fairly aggressively and it maintained a large head but settled fairly quickly.  Aroma: Roasted malts and booze, maybe a bit of dark chocolate, but no coffee or hops.  Taste: Well balanced. Good amount of carbonation to make the mouthfeel more robust, but it isn't super thick either, just about right, great for a sipper. It is a bit boozy in the taste, but not overly so considering the amount of alcohol that is in it. Malts, dark chocolate, some bitterness, but its also balanced by some sweetness, some say coffee, I detect some but this is nowhere in the same league as other stouts in regard to coffee, which is not a bad thing, I am just saying. It does have a lingering bitterness on the back of the tongue, nice finish. This is why I love stouts!  Overall: Well made and considering the deal I got, with this, it makes it even better.

Nose reveals scents of toasted caramel and dark fruit. This is a wonderful RIS that hits all the right buttons. Black cherry quickly sliding to a slightly overdone Colombian roast coffee. The maltiness isn't as complex as other RIS offerings, thus I've subtracted a touch off the total score, but as you'd expect, being a Stone brew, it finishes with an herbal and earthy hop finish. Even considering this is 7 months old. Perhaps, in another few months the hops might fade a bit more to allow the malt to come through.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,96

Still, a solid interpretation of a challenging style that is getting reduced too much in the U.S. right now to obviously big flavors and alcoholic contents which do not always behoove the style.

Smell: Sweet with strong coffee aromas, with some toasted/burnt hints.  Taste: Full-bodied with great balance of malt and hops. Dominated by toasted coffee, but with some chocolate flavor as well. Taste starts sweet with malts, then comes the roasted coffee flavors, and then a little bitterness from the hops. Overall a great combination.  Mouthfeel: Full-bodied, but smooth.

At 6 months the coffee, vanilla, and other flavors start to emerge and the texture is creamier.  O - As with most beers of this style, it gets better with age.

Aroma held vanilla and alcohol notes with some roasted malts trying to peek out...they remained covered until the first taste. The taste is bitter/roasted coffee and malts with the alcohol present but not over powering, deep roasted flavors and some wood hints show up as the tasting goes on. The mouthfeel is so dead on for the style, thick/heavy on the tongue while leaving a nice roasted mild coffee/roasted flavor at the end. Overall I'm very impressed with this offering, I love RIS as a whole and I've had a lot of Stones products...this is a winner and I will pick it up when I can.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,96
147,1160,MOVERTON1284,4,"2014 Vintage consumed fresh, with less than a month on it. Pours like motor oil with very little head. Overall very smooth for almost 11%. A classic RIS that ages well",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,96
147,1160,mac31,4.52,"Bomber to tulip.  Nose: Surprisingly fruity on the nose. Dark fruits, chocolate, earthy/dirt(y).  Flavor: Sweet malty, fruity entry. Oaky sweetness and warmth, dark fruits-prunes, dark chocolate, dark roasty malts, hints of coffee, slight ashy/acrid (near finish), comes to drying finish. Minimal alcohol detected on the finish, spiciness on finish as well. Finishing bitterness (and earthiness) of hops and chocolate intertwined. High drinkability. Nice grainy, cereal finish as the beer warms. All of this is in a nice harmonious balance. You have to try this vintage (2014), a great beer!",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,96
147,1160,spacebear09,4.04,"Appearance- Brew looks extremely thick, no light escaping here! Dark tan head with good retention.  Smell- Prunes, raisins, coffee, soy sauce.  Taste- Chocolate, dates, coffee, vanilla, tobacco. Boozy finish.  Mouthfeel- Thick like a milkshake, very oily.  Overall- Very good, but not enough to challenge the undisputed king (IMO) Old Rasputin. Still a good deal on bombers and a nice change of pace beer. It's really a shame that it gets release in April and not sometime during the fall.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,96
147,1160,artdob,3.62,"This review is for the 2014 release. Dark black pour. I chilled this one a bit (though I usually don't do this with Imperial Stouts), and got almost no head. Very light tan remnants floating on top of the glass.  On the nose, fudge chocolate dominates. This is mixed with an underlying herbal aroma, almost like basil. Also getting some root vegetable tones - carrots - demonstrating complexity.  Palate reveals complexity as well. Light roastiness. Light chocolate. Cherry. Blueberry jam. French roasted coffee.  Mouthfeel has decent carbonation, acceptable amount for the style.  Finish is medium light.  I had Stone's Woot stout earlier this week which in comparison is an outstanding brew.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,96
147,1160,KFBR392,4.22,"Appearance: pours with half a finger of khaki head which settled in to the edges of the glass. Above average active carbonation for the style. Rings of sticky lacing left behind at each level.  Smell: Dark fruit, bitter chocolate, plenty of hops, and sweet malts jump out right away. Each time you take a pull, a different aroma seems to stand out. Caramel and molasses sweetness carries into the body and is the biggest player throughout drinking. Lightly roasted malts with some dry coffee grounds picked up on the back end.  Taste: The front is waves of velvety smooth malts washing over the palate. Body opens up with bitter chocolates and and bright hops. Espresso and coffee grounds provide some earthy flavors on the back end. A malt sweetness runs throughout which clashes a touch with the hops and chocolate but goes so well with everything else. The finish is that easy sweetness with some light roasted malts.  Mouthfeel: Transitions of sweetness, roasted coffee and malts, and creamy textures are great. Carbonation is spot on.  Overall: For me, Stone is one of the truly great breweries I have access to. Their lineup is complex and affordable, yet all their beers have their signature hop profile that says ""this is american hoppy beer"". This is a great RIS that I look forward to every year. In the end, they make great beer so they get my money.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,96

147,1160,mabermud,4.32,"I grew up in Escondido and this my first time having this IRS.  The body is pitch black. When held up to the sun there is burgundy around the edges. The head is mocha colored, fine, patchy, and persistent. The silky smooth head easily moves along the glass creating a patchwork of legs and lacing.  The beer smells decadent and rich. Sweetness, roasted malts, coffee, and then chocolate.  The taste is outstanding. Roasted malts/barley, dark bitter chocolate, and a background taste of coffee. The bitterness near the backend stands out.  The mouthfeel is smooth and the carbonation is spot on. The slick, dense carbonation is world-class.  This is an outstanding IRS that stands out amongst all IRSs. For me, the bitterness at the backend of the taste doesn't do it any favors. Overall, this is an extremely competitive non-BA stout that I would have again in the future.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,96
147,1160,leantom,4.23,"This is the third time I've had this beer. However, I only gave it a month to condition before I drank it so the taste was less mellow than usual. However, it's still worthy of a review in my opinion. Here goes:  A: Deep, dark black. Completely opaque. Appears very thick, too. This beer, unfortunately, has no head and very little lacing (I guess it's because of the density). Also very little carbonation. Kind of disappointing.  S: Not disappointing at all. Very robust chocolate imparted from the heavily-kilned malts. Some dark fruit and licorice, but these smells are rather muted. No detectable hops or yeast. I love chocolatey RIS beers, so the smell made me smile.  T: Very good, but not perfect. Again, maybe it's because I didn't wait long enough for it to condition. Initial taste is one of dark chocolate followed by plum, raisins, dates, licorice and jam. The latter tastes linger on the palate a little too long after consumption, but maybe this is owing to the beer's thickness. Very complex flavor profile that combines chocolate with dark fruit. Good.  M: Excellent. Thick and creamy. The only thing keeping it from being perfect is the lack of carbonation.  O: A very good beer from Stone. While not perfect, it's most certainly a beer that I will be getting again and again.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,96
147,1160,threeviews,4.64,"2014 version (Bottled on 02/21/14) into a Belgian balloon/snifter glass  A- Pours an absolutely viscous motor-oil black with a 1-finger creamy, khaki colored head. Considering the ABV, the head retention is strong. Perfectly executed for the style. (5.0)  S- Upon the initial pour, I find Stone's IRS a bit conservative. Only after repeated pulls, I can pick out coffee, chocolate and some berry-like esters (strawberry jam?). As it warms (to basically room temperature), however, the complexity grows to include notes of nuts, vanilla and a hint of grapefruit citrus...pretty intense. (4.75)  T- Chocolate strikes first followed by that berry jam quality I find in the nose. The roastiness hits next and then a mild pop of licorice/anise. Its finish is a long, lingering bitterness which possesses that hint of grapefruit rind citrus. The complex flavor profile more than makes up for the muted aromatics. The 11% ABV is completely masked (4.75)  M- Although far from being cloying, this is a wonderfully decadent beer. The rather conservative carbonation gives Stone's IRS a creamy and velvety texture that coats the palate. Despite being full bodied and 11% ABV, this beer drinks very easily. (4.5)  O- A simple, yet well stated beer, I am confident the czar's from Russia would most have certainly approved of Stone's efforts. It is always nice to see Stone's IRS hit the shelves, yet the (odd year) varieties and W00tstout seem to eclipse the standard version. I've had this beer both fresh and aged (~2 years) and prefer it fresh since the fruity aromatics, subdued licorice/anise flavor and well-defined bitterness are more apparent when young.

Taste is deep and dark, mysterious, loads of roasted flavors. Chocolate, coffee, a nice yeasty note, and bitterness from the hops. Sweet and bitter at the same time. Alc. note is kept to a minimum. One of my favorite Impy stouts ever.  Feel is well carbed, and a viscous to the taste buds. Thick enough to be an imperial beer without making it a total sludge bomb.

147,1160,Son_of_Patrick,4.22,"The 2014 release.  Appearance was pitch black; no ruby notes when held up to the light. I didn't get a ton of smell from this brew, perhaps partially to do with the fact that it was served a bit too cold (Barley's Taproom in Maryville, TN insists on serving everything in a frosted glass).  Taste was what I expect from a RIS: rich and full with notes of chocolate. I was surprised at the lack of roastiness, and this beer had a strong sweetness to my taste which I'm not sure I liked.  Mouthfeel wasn't über thick for an RIS, but still substantial. Moderate carbonation, which I was pleased with.  Overall the beer was surprisingly wine-like due to the aforementioned sweetness and the high abv. I must note that I had this after drinking a pint of Red Brick Hoplanta, so that may have affected my taste buds. Ultimately a brew worth seeking out and one I would definitely like to try again.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,96

For once, they did not let me down. Outstanding look and appearance, tasty and enjoyable and not to much punch despite the ABV. I enjoyed this one very much, while there are other Imperial Stouts I prefer, this one gets great grades due to cost and ability to deliver the ABV.

It's got a nice full body, easy to roll around in the mouth and enjoy in a voluptuous sort of way :). An enjoyable stout.

147,1160,damndirtyape,4.39,"22oz bomber poured into a snifter (over 2 pours). Bottled on 02/21/14.  Appearance: Pitch black, even when held up to the light - nothing is getting through even at the edges. Dark tan head, died back from a 1/4"" initial head during the pour to a ring and thin skin across the top. Persistent strands and islands of lacing.  Smell: Coffee, bittersweet chocolate, hint of alcohol, and something else on the swirl. I could smell a hint of anise when it was cold and first poured, but as the beer warms up it takes on something I can't quite place. Sweet, maybe burnt/caramelized sugar?  Taste: Rich with lots of flavors. Mostly chocolate and coffee with roasted malts and some mild bitterness to balance the other flavors. Little bit boozy but this goes away as the beer warms up. Some anise at the finish, but this goes away as the beer warms up as well.  Mouthfeel: Smooth, creamy, just right carbonation.  Overall / Drinkability: Dangerously drinkable. I finished the whole bottle myself over an hour and it sneaks up on you, taps you on the shoulder, and then introduces you to a whole Soviet armored division, Baba Yaga, and a bunch of other Russian traditions. Definitely a beer for a weekend or an evening when you have no other responsibilities. Alcohol is very well hidden but I definitely could notice it by the end of the first glass. That being said, this beer pairs very well with food. It has a stand-alone flavor that isn't overpowering, and doesn't linger forever on the palate. It went very well with salad, mashed potatoes, and sausage. I think it would pair well with a wide range of meats and a wide range of other foods as well. Overall an amazing beer, and I may have to start picking this one up every year when it comes out. I've had several people tell me to cellar a bottle or two so I may have to start doing that as well.

Gives way to nice spiderweb like lacing all over the bulb of the glass.  The aroma is sweet toasted malts, nice carmels, a bitter-sweet coffee chocolate note.

Sweet at the start with a bitter bite on the finish.  Overall i was expecting more from this brew. All of stones brews are top notch, and so is this one. But i feel at $8.99 a 22oz it's just not worth it. I would rather have a 4 pk of founders imperial stout at $11.99.

147,1160,SerialTicker,4.18,"22oz bottle for $8.99. Poured into a Sam Adams Perfect Pint. Bottled on 2-21-14, I think -- the month is a bit scratched.  Let me say right away, I backspaced a HUGELY long review of this beer because I started sipping it straight out of the fridge. Unlike most people, I actually tend to like my imperial stouts a little colder than warmer. For this beer, I was pretty unimpressed at first. As I made my way through the bomber, I felt it necessary to re-review the whole beer. Maybe part of the rewrite is due to drunkenness... but either way, drinking this beer at its recommended temperature (55 degrees) is definitely something you should abide by.  Appearance: Pitch black. Used motor oil. No light getting through. A finger of creamy head on the initial pour that dies down to a thin layer of bubbles and a ring. A little bit of lacing on the glass, but not much.  Smell: Warm. You definitely get a bit of alcohol along with roastiness, dark fruits, dark chocolate, and caramel-like aromas. When this beer was straight out of the fridge, I didn't get much at all. It was a mild dark chocolate and caramel aroma, but it wasn't as potent as it is when it's a little warmer.  Taste/feel: The feel, strangely, seems to change more than anything the warmer this beer gets... then again, maybe there was some sort of sediment on the bottom of the bottle. This is a nice and creamy feeling beer with a moderate-at-best carbonation. The taste is *much* better as it warms up. Right out of the refrigerator, this beer has an intense hop bitterness that's actually a bit off-putting. As this warms, it all comes together and makes me fully understand the bold ""55 degrees"" text on the bottle. The strange hop bitterness mellows out and pushes out nondescript hop fruitiness with the dark fruit characteristics from the currants. That blended with the dark chocolate and roasted coffee make for a very nice blend of complex flavors. Tart dark fruits, a hop bitterness, the roast bitterness (yes, there's a difference between the two), the drying alcohol, the dark coffee and chocolates, and a slight bit of caramel sweetness as well.  I'm shocked. Fridge temperature, this beer was a let down. Still good, but more hop bitterness than anything else. After about 45 minutes out of the fridge, there's a lot of complexity coming through with rich roasted malts, coffee, dark chocolate, caramel, warming alcohol, a bit of dark fruits... when it was colder, I couldn't help but focus on the hop bitterness.  This is an excellent imperial stout. It's not quite on-par with some others out there, but this one is also a little bit lower in price as well. Most definitely buy this beer if you're a fan of the style, but certainly drink it at its recommended temperature of about 55 degrees.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,96
147,1160,superspak,4.35,"22 ounce bottle into snifter; 2011 vintage, bottled in Spring 2011. Pours Dense pitch black color with a 2 finger dense tan head with great retention, that reduces to a small cap that lingers. Light spotty soapy lacing clings on the glass. Aromas of big dark chocolate, cocoa, coffee, roasted malt, toast, dark bread, light char, molasses, raisin, light licorice, herbal, and roasted earthiness. Damn nice aromas with good balance and complexity of dark/roasted malts with moderate earthy yeast ester notes; with good strength and some slight booziness. Taste of big dark chocolate, cocoa, roasted malt, coffee, toast, dark bread, light char, molasses, raisin, light licorice, herbal, and roasted earthiness. Slight earthy herbal/roasted bitterness after the finish; with lingering notes of dark chocolate, cocoa, coffee, roast, toast, dark bread, light char, molasses, light raisin, and roasted earthiness on the finish for a while. Incredible complexity and balance of dark/bready/roasted malt flavors with light-moderate earthy yeast flavors; with a great roasted bitterness/sweetness balance and zero cloying flavors after the finish. Medium carbonation and fairly full bodied; with a very creamy, slick, and lightly chalky mouthfeel that is great. Alcohol is very well hidden with only a slight warming present after the finish, Overall this is outstanding imperial stout. All around awesome complexity and balance of dark/roasted malt and light-moderate earthy yeast ester flavors; and very smooth to sip on for the big ABV. A highly enjoyable offering.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,96

147,1160,kevanb,4.36,"650ml bottle, 2012 vintage, poured into a Stone IRS snifter.  The beer pours an intensely deep jet black color, oily and slick. A thick, caramel colored head rises from the beer, about 2 fingers high that has moderate retention and yields a soapy network of lace. The aroma is strong, lots of rich malted grain, assertive roast, bitter dark chocolate, plenty of stone fruit, a bit of tobacco and leather, super earthy with some licorice at the end. The flavors are wonderfully complex, bitter chocolate, subtle roast, cherry and plum, licorice, raisin before the earthy qualities come in, leather, tobacco with a heaping of malted grain that bridges the sweet and earthy flavors. The body is nice, silky, smooth, coats the mouth well, perhaps a bit lively, with a bit of a crisp zip at the back.  Verdict: A real winner from Stone, for all their hoppy fame, this beer definitely holds its own. The 2 years of aging has definitely helped this one tremendously, the roast is subtle and layered that brings out so many interesting flavors, licorice and tobacco as well as stone fruit. I'm glad I've got another 2012 vintage to open in another year or two.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,96

S - Strong smell of alcohol. Sweet, sour, and malty notes. A hint of coffee. Smell is not that strong at first.  T - Sweet chocolaty taste at the front. A strong coffee taste, and the alcohol definitely makes its presence felt, but that is to be expected with 11%. Mild bitter aftertaste. The taste got better as the beer warmed up.  M - Silky silky smooth. May be the smoothest mouth feel i have gotten from a beer. Also very heavy with a strong alcohol burn.  O - Very nice and very very smooth beer.

147,1160,beergoot,4.12,"2014 release with an 11.0% ABV.  Pitch black body with a thick, creamy, tan head. Rather sweet smell; vanilla; anise; cocoa; cherries. Chocolate-mint flavor with a nice undertone of booze and mellow hop bitterness; brownies. Heavy body; some velvety smoothness; semi-dry finish with a noticeable boozy bite.  A very good RIS full of flavor and depth. The smell was complex yet rather subdued and was the only weakness overall. Hop bitterness builds up nicely and lingers through the end. But it's the bold roasted grain flavors that tell the real story: big toasted malt flavors with a mild sugary sweetness and bitter chocolate tones. The ABV makes its presence known, too, but is well-blended with the malt and hop elements to make an overall harmonious marriage of taste and feel. Complexity and depth with a fairly easy drinking quality for such a heavy and high ABV ale make this stout a winner.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,96
147,1160,Roguer,4.17,"Big, dark brown head with excellent retention and quickly-sliding lacing. Brew is very dark.  Massive roasted barley aroma, with some chocolate malt, cream, and a little booze. Intended direction for this imperial stout is immediately evident.  Flavor follows the nose strongly. Tons and tons of roasted barley, with just a hint of very dark cacao. Cream and wheat, and a tiny bit of banana (likely from yeast). There is a slightly metallic off-taste, but I think it's likely from the barley. Extremely strong and assertive.  Remarkably balanced mouthfeel, given the strength and aroma. Thick, creamy, and smooth, a hair lighter than chewy. Some noticeable heat at the end.  Excellent, but mostly one-dimensional, imperial stout. It smacks you in the face with gobs of roasted barley, never hides its allegiance, and pulls it off in a very tasty package.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,96
147,1160,ChugMan,4.18,"Food Pairing - Ripe banana: Interesting, metal flavor is highlighted but the sweeter fruit qualities are elevated as well. 90% Dark Chocolate: A terrific match of richness and bitterness without muddling the more enjoyable flavors.  A - Opaque black, deep red at the thinnest edge. Foamy head which left nice lacing. S - Soft. Cocoa, cream, faint anise. Bread, some nuttyness. Very inviting. T - At 11%, the alcohol hits fast and hard, with a surge of hops behind it- its name is deserved! Dark bitter chocolate cut with some vanilla, cola, anise, black cherry and lime rind bite that lasts, becoming slightly metallic, and a slightly unpleasant cough-medicine astringency. M - Quite smooth. Chewy, not quite syrupy, dry finish O - In case the brand and the name weren't warning enough, this stout isn't one to be taken lightly. Best used as a dessert compliment rather than solo.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,96

The taste is outstanding, with a blend of coffee, a bit of chocolate and a lot of roastiness, maybe just a bit too much roastiness for me. I've been on an RIS kick lately and this is at the top of the heap, but not quite up to Plead the Fifth or Expedition.

Very light alcohol present by smell T-First sip was everything I expected. Rich, deep roasty and sweet malt with a very pleasant bitterness that fills in after the swallow. For 11% abv the alcohol presence is enough to let you know it's there, without being overbearing. M-smooth as silk, almost too smooth with a lingering hop bitterness and rich coating.  Glad I was able to find one at the local craft beer store. 1 of 3 left! And damn good, for a Russian stout it was everything I hoped it would be.

147,1160,Mongrel,3.96,"A - pours very dark brown with a great frothy, mocha colored, tight-packed head that sticks around for quite a while.  S - smells strangely like BBQ, so I guess it's got a smokey element. That little oddity subsides to reveal some sweet molasses, caramel, vanilla and a tiny bit of pine.  T - there's that odd bit of BBQ again, but only at first, and it's chalky dry. It's a bit disappointing, but only at first. But a sweet, syrupy flavor profile opens up with blackstrap molasses, caramel and vanilla, much like the nose. There's some bitter, roasted barley, but not as much as a lot of bigger stouts. It's on the sweeter side instead. Gets nicer and nicer as it warms, with some raisin, prune, tobacco and dark chocolate emerging. Also a nice earthy hop profile that lends a bit of pine. Very little evidence of the big 11% ABV, which is nice.  M - nice and frothy up front with a syrupy sweet middle and a chalk dry finish. Nicely structured, but the middle could be a little deeper and more refined.  Overall, this one's a bit rough around the edges but give it some time to open up and warm and you'll be rewarded with quite a variety of rich flavors and a healthy buzz.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,96

Rich roasted malts and a pleasant smokey flavor that lingers on the tongue.  M - Wonderful, rich mouthfeel. Low carbonation.  O - Delicious. Packs a punch but you wouldn't know it. Well balanced and enjoyable.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,96

Taste: Fresh, thick, hints of chocolate and coffee, very nice, very drinkable, didn't start out bitter but the longer in the mouth the bitterness came to the top but not overpowering.  Mouth feel: Again thick and you feel like you are drinking something memorable.  Overall: I highly recommend this as a class A stout, this is one to enjoy and I will again.

147,1160,Aristeia_88,3.33,"I've heard lots of good things about Stone over the years, though the one experience I had with them wasn't that impressive... Hopefully their version of one of my favorite styles will give me a new, more favorable opinion of them... This is for the 2014 release @ 11% ABV. Poured from a 22 oz. bomber into my over-sized stein.  Look: Pours jet black with a thick, tan head of about 3 fingers... Bubbles started out very fine, but are growing as the head fades. Looks like it's leaving some pretty nice lacing. Off to a good start...  Smell: Mostly burnt coffee, you can smell the bitterness to it. Something in here reminds me of a bready almost Champagne-like yeast character. Not much going on here as far as malt goes...  Taste: I understand that this is a fairly young beer, so maybe that's a factor here, but this is probably one of the most flavorless IRs I've had... A little bit of dry smokiness to it, and a bit of malt. The dominant flavor here is alcohol... Which is odd- I'm used to big beers around this percentage, but alcohol usually isn't this noticeable.  Mouthfeel: Surprisingly viscous... Good carbonation- Thick, but not syrupy. I think that judging by the feel of this, it could be a great beer in 6 months or so, but right now the rest of the beer hasn't caught up with this part. I think the flavors just need more time to blend and mellow out.  Overall: Somewhat of a disappointment...

147,1160,datalager,4.58,"Okay...go big or go home.  Meet Stone's Imperial Russian Stout.  Image  Yes, the name alone gives me the sense of something with a calculated purpose...and possibly intimidating. No, this is not the only Russian Stout out there. Nor is my palate the novice to such an ale. I am obviously in considerable support of any beer that is black, or Russian, or Stone for that matter.  The bottle is presented with simplicity,  Image  adorning some key hints to what lies within.  Image  Image  This particular bottle was born on March 22, 2013. I was not fortunate enough to find a full case. Instead, this single bomber has awaited salvation from it's cocoon in the dark corner of my basement, for more than half of a year.  As I firmly open the room temperature bottle I feel a sense of something intense...a tinge of excitement...maybe even fear, as if I was releasing the Kraken from the depths of the Black Sea.  During the pour I witness, perhaps, the most agressive flow of smoke I've ever seen from a bottle of ale. Once in the glass the colors are typical of a nicely finished Imperial Stout, and a backlit study reveals the pure opacity of this brew. Black as pitch.  Opening the nares I pull in butterscotch, chocolate covered raisins, roasted malt and the teasing presence of esters. This is full bodied aroma! I could just sit here and smell this beer all day! WOW! This is going to be a good brew...my bat sense in tingling.  Flavor is...WOW...holy...WOW!!! Best first sip of any stout I have ever had! Mouth feel is insanely viscous, like chilled olive oil. Some mild carbonation passes mid stream, offering just a hint of bite. Flavors are sweet right off the mark, following the scents of the nose nicely. And then, nearly ten seconds later...hops, American style! Tons of them!!! I did not see that coming! Notice my liberal use of exclamation points here! There is good reason, because this is an altogether exceptional beer. Another swallow, and I am immediately swooned my the superlative undulation of sweet, smoky malts with intense, bitter hops. However, unlike Stone IPA's, where they notoriously utilize hop bitterness as a means to an artifice, the bitter finish here is actually a necessary balance to the syrupy inauguration. This dried ending just moments after your swallow beckons you to return for more. An more I did! Wow!  This is not the most ""authentic"" variation of an RIS that I've had, given the presence of unique hops. For that reason alone I could not give 5's straight across the ratings. However, I will dare to say that this specific mix of hops might just be the last ingredient that such an ale has missed in other brews, for me. It makes for a powerhouse ale, which is dynamic and full bodied. So what we have here is an Americanized RIS. I have probably enjoyed no less than 20 or 30 Imperial Stouts, and I have to say that this is, despite the unique variation, the best I have had.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,96

Smell - Malts, chocolate, grains, coffee, anise  Taste & Mouth - There is an above average amount of carbonation and I can taste malts, chocolate, and faint coffee. There is also a burnt flavour and some anise.  Overall - A good beer but I was expecting more based on the high overall score.

No alcohol bite, no bitter aftertaste; the components are all flavorful yet, subdued and very effective. ABV is undetectable.  Updated 03/17/14: I just opened a 2010 vintage and I must confirm that the years have been kind to this beauty. It is every bit as smooth as the later version. Like liquid velvet.

Little hop character, some alcohol bitterness in the finish. (4)  M: Very smooth and unctuous in the mouth. However, it leaves an unpleasant grainy sensation that lingers for quite a while and really detracts from the beer. (2)  O: This beer is a miniature tragedy. So good, up to the finish which is really unpleasant. I could just drink faster, so as to experience more taste and less aftertaste, but that's probably a poor choice with a 10.5% beer. So, I'm torn.

It's been in my fridge for about a year, decided to finally sit down and review a bottle.. have had this on two different occasions, but apparently just never got around to writing a review on it.  App- Dark black body, opaque with a nice one finger mocha head that retains fairly well, really nice thin lacing that sinks into the beer. Nice mocha collar and thin film. Looks the part.  Smell- Even at room temp, all I get is a bit of dark fruit and chocolate. No coffee, no roast, no brown sugar, nothing else to tell me this is a true RIS. I would like a lot more that I get here.  Flavour- What it doesn't deliver in the nose, it does deliver on the palate. Charred malts, dark fruit, dark chocolate, a bit of espresso and a slick syrupy sweet molasses finish. Robust, complex with a lot going on.  Mouthfeel- Full bodied, perfectly carbonated. Slick, coating my mouth in bitter chocolate with sweet molasses; it's definitely a sipper due to the intensity of the flavour and its slick nature; there isn't a ton of heat or anything like that.  Overall- Probably one of the best deals out there in terms of Russian Imperial Stouts in bombers at $6.99.

147,1160,RonaldTheriot,4.5,"Stone Imperial Russian Stout has a thin, beige head, a very dark brown appearance (with reddish-brown highlights in direct sunlight), and decent, but not heavy, lacing left on the glass. The aroma is rich and pronounced- rich, sharp, brown bread crust, sweetness, coffee, cream, chocolate powder, and maybe even dark cherries. Taste is of those elements, with a fairly strong hop bitterness rounding it out. Mouthfeel is velvety and pretty heavy, and Stone Imperial Russian Stout finishes mostly dry, rich, dessert-like, and sip-able. Overall, this is wonderful, and I think everyone should try it!

Lots of dark charred notes, coffee, and licorice. Full body with a hint of carbonation to liven the feel. Creamy with a chalky finish. Overall this is a solid RIS. One of the first of the style I ever got to try. I had a 2009 a few nights ago and I have to say it was perfect. This is the 2012 and feels like it still needs some more time.

T: Lots of dark fruit in the onset; cassis, dark berry, etc. The mid palate opens up to a sort of oaky/leathery taste. Also are big roasted qualities, along with lots of burnt sugar. Aftertaste is caramelized sugar, more dark fruit. Traces of herbal quality.  M: Perfect. Big, thick and chewy without being over the top or flabby. Carbonation is enough to support the massive malt bill and hide the alcohol. Great stuff.  O: Pure RIS goodness here. No barrels, no flavor infusions, and yet still a ton of flavor.

Lots of roasted flavors going on. It finishes with a very slight alcohol burn that lingers for quite some time. Not in a bad way. It's amazing how smooth it finishes for what it is.

147,1160,rangerred,4.17,"Poured into a snifter out of a 22oz bomber.  Pours pitch black with the consistency of motor oil with a smallish half finger dark tan head. I was surprised at the lacing which is pretty thick.  The aroma is a little weaker than I was expecxting but has notes of licorice and dark fruits with hints of smoke and coffee.  The flavor has strong notes of coffee and roast with a hefty dose of dark chocolate thrown in for good measure. The dark fruit is much more restrained allowing the coffee and roast to take center stage. Bitterness is on the higher side but it helps to balance out the sweetness. Thick, silky mouthfeel with just a whiff of alcohol to go along with the slightly sticky, warming finish.  Overall, an above-average RIS.

It pours a creamy lush head and a beautiful black. The aroma is sweet and sticky, just like when you get it on your lips. The taste is mild - nothing harsh. A perfect balance of sweetness and hops. And the aftertaste is totally mellow, and it lingers a nice bitter.  This brew makes you think that you could have 10 pints of it when in fact three will get you wasted and more will do you in.

Dry finish for an Imperial stout, with slight alcohol throat burn, bitterness builds at the sides of the tongue.  m: Medium and smooth.  o: An excellent imperial stout! Remarkably easy drinking for this high ABV, certainly easier than the Oak Aged Yeti I had last night. Even difficult to say it is not as good as FIS or Rasputin, my favorites to now.

147,1160,shacawgo24,4.06,"A-Eyes closed shut black. Dirty khaki head that is few finger thick and fades at a nice rate. Not too fast. Creamy foam. Meets the standard for stout looks.  S-Roasted malt. Burnt chocolate. Prunes. Dark nuts like walnut. Astringency. Later warmed I smelled cinnamon. Chocolate baked bread as well, say brownie.  T-Bitter dark chocolate. Fig. Warming as all stouts should get to be, more dark fruits jump up. Prune, raisin. Iced dark coffee with little cream refreshes the palate as well. As it warmed I detected honey-bread tastes. Reminiscent of graham cracker. I implore you to explore your own taste world with this quality brew.  M-Good medium carbonation. Doesn't go down like thick sludge. Fluid. WHEN WARMED. This will become black syrupy-cream. Surprised me. Thought the feel would remain a watery-to-light-thick beer. You can slow-sip this like a fine spirit.  O-One is not a beer drinker until they hit Stone's Imperial Stout. A great gateway for novices in the style. A nice throwback/personal favorite for seasoned vets. The ABV is well concealed. You get buzzed without tasting the booze. This didn't blow me away, but didn't disappoint. I would rather drink North Coast-Old Rasputin. Shameless plug but still. This is a great beer!

S - Smell is irresistible, with roasted black malt, dark chocolate, dark fruit, roasted bitterness, coffee, fudge, and even hints of molasses. Why is this beer not rarer than it is? Has to be the best smelling readily available RIS.  T - Going to wait a few while this warms. Would rather drink it at 55 than 48-50 degrees. Wow as it warm what delicious flavors that emerge, dark chocolate, roasted coffee malt, plum is prevelant in the taste as well as licorice while the booze remains well hidden. There is a slight amount of hops but not over powering in any way. Wish I tackled this beer sooner.  M - massive body with a syrupy texture. nearly perfect for an imperial stout.

147,1160,lordofstarside,4.43,"Bomber of the 2013 vintage, roughly 8 months old. Given a few minutes in the fridge out of the cellar 10.6% abv  Pours jet black with two and a half finger of khaki tinged foam (I was a little aggressive with the pour.) Retention has died down to a half finger then to a frothy ring, pretty good lacing on the sides  Edit- second pour was much more amiable. A finger and a half of head with an improved retention rate  Smell is nice and strong, I catch notes just moving around the glass. Putting my nose in it- rich roasted dark chocolate, vanilla, coffee, figs, cherry, and a little bit of alcohol. Everything comes together well  Taste is with the nose, strength is in a different order though- toasted dark chocolate, dark fruits, coffee, vanilla, a little hoppiness, and some alcohol on the end. Like the aroma, everything comes together really well, delicious beer  Feel is thick and creamy, heavy and sticky. Alcohol is concealed well, should disappeared all together pretty soon. Dangerously drinkable  Overall one of the better RIS available on a wide scale. These always give me a reason to look forward to spring",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,96
147,1160,AlCaponeJunior,4.05,"Quite typical of the style, this brew is jet black, black as the ace of spades. A small tan head tops it off, leaving nice sheets of lacing.  Smell is of rich dark roasted malts, along with some raisins and figs and dark fruits. Cocoa and coffee make their obligatory appearances too.  Taste is bold, rich, and wonderful. Heavily malted with roasty character, this beer incorporates the chocolate and coffee in the usual manner for the style. Easy going prunes and a nice caramel flavor round out the bold flavor of this brew.  Feel starts off medium and becomes heavier as the beer breathes and warms. It's great for the style and all-around a nice beer to drink.  Overall this RIS meets the standard, and then goes typically higher, as per the name Stone.

Anise is present but not as heavy as I've seen it described before. Bitter throughout with an aftertaste lingering. Not overly sweet. No alcohol presence.  Mouthfeel is smooth, creamy, rich, mild-moderate carbonation, sticky dry, very nice.  Overall, well-deserving of the praise it receives.

S - Roasted malts produce big dark fruit smells, prunes and raisins, with molasses and a solid alcohol burn.  T - The nose comes through, with dried dark fruits being a central element, and a fat coffee and dark, bittersweet chocolate line is joined in the close by a slight hop bite. There is a subtle soy sauce - savory element, and a light minerality. Excellent.  M - Mild carbonation, slick and full, with some drying in the close that keeps things from getting too heavy.

Viscous, dark, and still. This thing looks pure evil.  S- Aroma of raw chocolate, coffee, and dark fruits. True to the style as it is as roasty as can be. Balanced with hop oils and light booze. Inviting is quite an understatement.  T- Are you kidding me with this complexity and depth? Currant, esters, dates, chocolate, roasted nuts, tobacco, charred malts and marshmellows. A scary clash of bitter and sweet flavors taking place here. Not picking up the licorice others have described, but that is preferred for me. How this thing remains smooth with everything going on here is beyond me.  M- Creamy, thick, dense, full body, impeccable.

147,1160,BrownNut,4.02,"I'm appending a second review of this beer after aging it for a little over a year since I had the other one of these I bought at the same time. Interestingly, some of my scoring is different than before but the descriptions aren't very different. So I suppose it's evidence of the greater amount of comparative context I've cultivated over the past year, having tried many others in that time and having gotten a better idea of what's at the very top of the scale and reckoning the others against that.  Overall, I don't know that this one changed much over the course of a year. In retrospect, I should have scored it a bit better last time. But here are both reviews, the newer not influenced by the older, which I didn't look at again until pasting this new one. I'd say there's no problem with aging this one, but there really isn't a need. Not for 1 year anyway.  I've left the original scores as the official ones. If I used the more recent ones it would be a 4.28 instead of a 4.01  OCT 30 2013 REVIEW  18.5 months old, 13 months since the original review below. Bottle to tulip, served a bit cooler than room temp and warming to room temp over the course of a long sampling.  A - 4.25 - Black with a nice thick, creamy, fluffy, tan head that makes for a quick few fingers with a moderately aggressive pour and settles down to a film within two to three minutes. Lacing that sticks right where it is.  S - 4.5 - While the head is fresh it puts off the loveliest mix of malty (think Whoppers) and chocolatey smells. As the head fades, the malty smell fades with it. Once it settles, the chocolate is almost a chocolate liqueur smell. There's a note of booze, but not in a bad way - in a slightly fruity, slightly floral way that works with the rest of it, overlapping and blending into the sweetness of the chocolate. It really is a lovely aroma overall. Not intense, but very nice.  T - 4.25 - Cocoa initially, and later in the glass more like a nice bittersweet dark chocolate, something north of milk chocolate but south of 70% cacao. Mild black malt char. The two of those are nicely balanced against each other. Milder than some imperial stouts. Pleasant booze warmth wafting up the throat on the exhale. The booze elevates it if you're me and your reviews never talk about a beer being ""too hot"". Warms the belly a bit after a while. Somehow gives me coffee breath without a noticeable coffee flavor note.  M - 4.0 - Medium-heavy body, somewhat viscous, and tongue-coating. The alcohol wreaks a mild sensation on the tongue. Despite the tongue coating, there is also the barest bit of dry underneath that, like the very beginnings of hop abrasion.  O - 4.25 - This is a top quality imperial stout. Very well done. There are others that are more complex, but this is still very well composed and executed overall. This one is friendly. If you wanted to introduce somebody to imperial stouts without scaring them off, this would be a good one to choose.   OCT 2, 2012 REVIEW  Bottle to tulip. 5.5 months old. Served cellar temp and got to room temp by halfway.  A - 4.25 - Inky black and viscous looking. Somewhat fizzy dark khaki head that settles down to a cap within a couple minutes. Second pour produces a head more like I like them, thick and textured like a landscape, with peaks and valleys. Settles down to a film.  S - 4.0 - Can't put my finger on this smell, though I know it. Something fruity? It reminds me of something in the bouquet of a Borderies cognac, almost a pastry note, maybe with marzipan, maybe with fruit. Aside from that, a bit of that Sugar Smacks malty-grainy-sweet-honey-molasses smell, bleeding over into chocolate, bleeding over into a bit of coffee.  T - 4.0 -While there's chocolate, cocoa-esque, it's dialed back. There's mild char and coffee but not until the exhale, which comes with some warm booze fumes, all three appreciated. I'd welcome the char and coffee up front. Hint of chocolate in the burp. Definitely gained character as it warmed.  M - 4.0 - Very smooth and soft. Barely medium bodied. Looked thicker when pouring.  O - 4.0 - After a previous really big stout, I was expecting the same from this based on what I'd heard, but this one is milder. Still it's really good. The balance is such that nothing sticks out. That makes it more subtle than blasty. Often I want something more robust, something harsher, but it's good to know this milder one is there too.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,96
147,1160,Nicholas_Vronksy,5,"I love this beer!  I generally enjoy stouts, but this one is a cut above. The color is jet black with a frothy chocolate head. The feel is thick and smooth though not overly heavy. There is significant presence of espresso, cacao beans, and roasted malts in both the aroma and flavor; this rich malty flavor balances perfectly with the hint of bitterness on the back end (and unlike with many other bitter beers I really do mean well balanced).  If this beer has a drawback it's only that it's seasonal and when I do see it sold it's mostly in giant 22oz bottles. Honestly sometimes I just don't fee like drinking 22oz. of 10% alcohol beer in one sitting.  Nice job Stone!",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,96

No lacing around edges of glass.  S - Very fragrant. Dark chocolate, amaretto, Irish cream, roasted coffee, and dried fig.  T - Bitter chocolate, roasted coffee, anise, some coffee acids, espresso, and dark fruit (sour cherry and dried fig. Dark fruit adds some sweetness.

So many aromas waft from the tulip - dark roast coffee, caramel, dried fruit, anise, soy sauce, and so much more. Extremely complex. Nice sweetness hits the palate first - molasses, fig, vanilla, chocolate. Bitterness on the back end with lots of coffee, bitter chocolate and toasted coconut. Full bodied with good carbonation.

147,1160,TBoneJones,4.28,"Stone Russian Imperial Stout 2013 Pours virtual black, with 2 very fat fingers of caramel frapaccino head. Long to settle, and thick lacing. Smells of chocolate, a nutty aroma, some licorice. Nothing strong, but very pleasant what is there. Tastes follows the smell, but now I get the roasted notes, some bitterness, but the chocolate presence i recall upon prior annual releases of this seemed to involve more chocolate, where here there seems a focus on a sour-dark fruit/ coffee basis. Malty. A thick, sticky yet smooth-sipping beast of an RIS. Burn. Feels good like that. Maybe my prior sampling had more age. Maybe this beer is even greater with a year or several on it. I know I've had it in the past and it blew me away. Oh well.

Smell: Some light alcohol fumes as well as deeply roasted malts and dark chocolate. Additionally, there are also strong hints of vanilla that appear to dominate the malts and mix well with the dark chocolate.  Taste: Dark chocolate with vanilla and deep roasted malts as well as a slight taste of alcohol.  Mouthfeel: Biting carbonation and heavy bodied.

S: Rich milk chocolate, dates, spices, anise, vanilla. Very pleasing to the senses, you can detect the individual nuances of each component.  T: A true symphony of cohesive stoutness. Thick and creamy sweetened and condensed milk intertwines with bits of toffee, espresso beans, dried raisons, anise, black cherries, malt, and burnt sugar.The alcohol burn has subdued quite nicely and really allows for the core body of flavors to shine through, and that is a good, good thing.  M: Velvet. Coats the mouth with 10W30 of stout oil we have all come to love and appreciate. Carbonation is near perfect. The balance of power on the palate is really amazing, not too thick and heavy, but not watery and thin either. The ABV adds just a warming sensation to the river coursing down your throat.  O: Insanely drinkable and just downright a pleasure enjoy. The price per pleasure ratio just can't be beat. Seek this one out..and LIVE!",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,96
147,1160,mfnmbvp,4.03,"22 oz. bottle, with bottled on date 03/15/2013, ""2013 classic release"". My bottle lists a 10.60% abv. I'm finally getting around to trying this beer. Expectations are decent enough, and I enjoyed the Stone Espresso Imperial Russian Stout.  Poured into a clear balloon snifter glass.  A - Pours a solid opaque black; no light shines through. Nice creamy finger and a half of soft mocha head with some nice staying power for such a high alcohol content. Nice streaks of lace.  S - Smells pretty intriguing. The alcohol fumes have faded noticeably, but are still present. Dark fruit like raisins and black currants, chocolate, cold coffee, some vanilla. The bottle lists anise in the nose, and when I look for it, I can definitely smell it.  T - Taste kicks the booze heat up a few notches. Bitter dark chocolate / coffee bean roast, some vanilla, some cream, & lots of alcohol heat.  M - Feel is thick and heavy. Smooth and creamy. Full bodied with good carbonation. A nice dessert beer.  Overall, a well executed example of the style from Stone. This beer doesn't push the envelope or dive head first in new unfounded territory, and that's fine with me. A little bit boozy; some age might do this beer well.  Stone Imperial Russian Stout ---4/5.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,96

Bottled March 13.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,96
147,1160,MotorboatMofo,4.09,"A- Dark black and tan/brown head about a finger.  S- toasty and nutty smell.  T- Smooth well balanced taste, with a little barley taste, and a hint of booze.  M- Smooth beer. Tastes better after a couple sips.  O- Very smooth beer. It hides the alcohol very well for a 10.6. I love Stone Brewery. This is a very good stout. The label says bottled on 3/15/2013, so I was surprised to see this at a liquor store. I don't know if that would make a difference but I thought I would mention the date. I don't think I would buy this again though. But worth the try!",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,96
147,1160,Ivanhoes_Backpack,4.47,"Cracked this open a few days ago for #500 on untappd.  Vintage Spring 2010 bottle poured into a tulip.  A - dark, opaque with half a finger head that stays around a long time. S - sweet, dark choc, raisins, dates. T - taste a lot of dark fruits, dates especially. Yum. Some chocolate and very little booze, I think 2.5 years smoothed it out a bit. M - again, the age really helped smooth this beer out, like drinking silk. O - I had a great experience with this beer. Cost me $14 and had to get it out of the locked display case, but it was all worth it in the end. Not sure how many of these are still kickin around, but if you see one you better grab it.

147,1160,jwhancher,4.54,"Bottled on date of 3/27/13. Pours black with mocha head. Smells of anise, rum raisin, carmelized sugar, dark fruit like plum & prune, and espresso. Lacing clings to the glass. Alcohol held in check yet it's there. Taste: Upfront sugary sweetness with notes of molasses, fig, vanilla, chocolate, and a stinging bitterness at the back end. Full mouthfeel as it's chewy. Alcohol gives a burn in the throat. Hops seem to be masked by dark notes - that's okay, they're definitely there balancing out any sweetness from becoming cloying.  Reminds me of eating pecan pie. Dark & rich. A great after dinner drink. Extremely solid beer. Complex yet so simple and delicious. Glad to have finally tried. Would likely age well.  22-oz bottle poured into snifter for review.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,96

S- notes of chocolate and sweet alcohol on first pour. As the glass warmed, smelled like burnt sugar (not caramel) or molasses.  T- big bitter flavor from deep roast malt, chocolate and alcohol. Again, as the glass warmed, the flavor transitioned into the burnt sugar/molasses.  M- thicker, a little oily and a little tingling on the tongue from the alcohol.  O- a great big bodied imperial stout. Not overly complex, but great flavors.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,96

147,1160,Immortale25,4.31,"Had on-tap at Appalachian Vintner Asheville. Served in a tapered glass. 2013 vintage.  A- Pours a 99% opaque black color with a 1/8 inch light brown head that soon vanishes to a thin ring around the edge of the glass and minimal surface foam.  S- Dark roasted malt brings about some char plus there's a considerable fume.  T- More char plus a slight vanilla sweetness and of course some dark chocolate. Alcohol is more toned down than in the nose allowing the bitterness of the roasty malt to shine. Speaking of bitterness, the hops seem to have mostly faded in the year since this has been sitting.  M- Not as creamy as I remember other batches being. Slight booze burn too. Medium-low carbonation and full body are spot on though.  O- The smoothness factor on this one is just through the roof. Goes down so easy for the ABV while still hitting all the flavor notes you would expect out of an RIS.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,96

147,1160,auroracrisis,4.35,"Remnants of a bomber into a snifter. This is a 2013.  Pitch black with a mocha colored head that dissipates into a ring around the edges. Plenty of foam and tiny residual bubbles on the top of the beer. Foamy lacing as it is drank down.  Rich bakers chocolate and earthy hops hit your nose first. The aroma evolves into heavily roasted espresso, softer chocolate notes, and burnt sugars. Booze becomes pretty apparent once the beer warms.  Opens up with that same baker's chocolate and rich burnt sugar flavor but quickly moves into a huge amount of bitterness. Roast and earthy hops dominate after the first initial bit of taste but as the beverage moves along your tongue you begin to pick up the more subtle sweetness. Almost like a boozy dark chocolate frosting. Leaves your palate with plenty of bitterness.  Heavy on the tongue with a tiny bit of carbonation. Sticky on the lips and a tad drying on the palate.  Big baker's chocolate, roast, and earthy bitterness mellowed out with some subtle burnt sugars. A very good imperial stout. Something I am currently building a vertical of since I imagine this ages very well.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,96
147,1160,utopiajane,4.04,"This pours black a little bit thick. It's got no light even on the edges and the head is a cocoa brown. It's thin but lasts well. Wet shimmering lace and alcohol legs. Head refreshes on each tip of the glass.  Nose is dark, roasted malt that's slightly burnt. Dark roasted coffee that is very intense, espresso, bittersweet chocolate and a brief flash of a bright fruit that was cherry until it faded to a dark fruity quality overall. As it warmsit becomes a bit earthy and woody and you begin to notice a hop presence. A little toffee and a nice sugary scent. Tiny bit of char and the toasted malt together with the cherry and currant fruit is quite the start of the nose. The chocolate takes a back seat for now. There's some alcohol on the nose that creeps in intermittently. It's not always there.  Taste follows the nose. It's dark and full with malt. The malt is bitter and there's a hop bitter too. Not too much and it leaves for a dry and warming finish. The chocolate sweetens deeply as this warms and the sugar remains pretty light. The coffee helps to smooth it out. Light molasses and a slight nutty flavor. There is a bit of alcohol on the palate intermittently as well but it remains in check.  When I rated this the first time I didn't like it as much so I I got myself another bottle. I have to say that this one is fresher than the last and I like it much more. The mouthfeel is creamy and not too oily this time. The fruit stays up and bright this time to lend an all around sweetness and bright flavor to the darker heavier aspects. The nutty flavor intensifies as it warms and suddenly I am begining to change my mind. What kept it from a higher score in taste and smell is that pesky alcohol. Glad I tried it again.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,96

T: Taste follows the nose wonderfully. Dark roast and chocolate flavors with some coffee in there. Light dark fruitiness shows up in there as well. A fair alcohol presence lies in the finish.  M: Creamy and full-bodied. Super smooth feeling with a perfectly light carbonation.  O: This is an excellent stout. I was worried about it living up to expectation, but Stone has delivered here.

T - Chocolatey and malty upfront, molasses, finishes with some light bitterness. A little bit of alcohol burn.  M - Medium to heavy mouthfeel, light carbonation. Surprisingly smooth and drinkable for a big RIS. Thick and oily.  O - Very good. One of the better straight RIS that I've had. Aged about a year, not sure how much that changed the flavor.

Head left a fair amount of lacing.  S- Huge hints of dark chocolate and expresso the minute you pour it. Sink your nose in the glass and you might get some plenty of roasted malts and a hint of coffee.  T- Roasted malts, dark, dark chocolate, and surprisingly an almost vanilla-like sweetness that creeps up of you but finishes bitter. Nicely balanced indeed.  M- Thick mouthfeel which is what you would expect from a powerhouse stout like this. Leaves and oily presence in the palate and on the lower side of carbonation.

Looking at it should excite beer fans.  S: Roasted Malts, chocolate, coffee and currants. Bit of a sweetness like brown sugar.  T: Big big flavor. The components of the smell come through strong, with a bit of a lingering malt flavor. Warms the body as it goes down. Wonderful. You know are getting alot of alcohol, but I would not say it is overwhelming.  F: Thick and smooth. Almost syrup like.  O: Worth the hype. Great beer.

147,1160,RichD,4.35,"2012 bottle, poured into a pint glass.  A: Pours a black that is deeper than the darkest depths of the ocean. There's a finger of khaki colored foam that dissipates into a layer of khaki film floating along the top of the liquid.  S: A coffee and chocolate bomb this is. There's some roasted malts and maybe a faint, faint scent of hops but nothing too crazy.  T: I initially drank this cold, at about 40 degrees or so. At that temp there was quite a bit of alcohol in the taste. As I let this warm up as I'm supposed to, it turned into an awesome taster. It follows the nose as well as it can. Coffee and chocolate flavors are what overwhelm my pallet. The roasty malts stick around for what seems to be days. This brew definitely improves with the warming of the temperature. This is a real pleasant tasting brew.  M: Thick mouthfeel here. I initially picked up on some strong alcohol flavors, but as this warmed up the alcohol went away and this just became a real decadent tasting imperial stout.  Overall: Stone really comes through with their trademark ""In your face"" brews. A roasted malt bomb is what this is. I don't really remember the last time I had a straight forward RIS, but Stone really does a great job here. I actually prefer the Espresso RIS to the original, but this beer is special for what it is. I am thoroughly impressed and I'm glad I pick this bomber up for 7 bucks. Great deal.  P.S. I will say that I made the mistake of trying the Espresso version first and that may have influenced me to rate this a tad bit lower than I originally would have if I didn't try that version first.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,96

On first pour: This brew is darker then the dang bottle it came in...awesome! It pours out like dark, rich, thick and robust...This brews head appears; is a carmel color sticky foam; hangs on to the side of the glass for dear life until the dark roasted brew consumes it again.  On first taste: WOW.... a stout for sure, it is...deep, complex, roasted, malty, and a bite of hops on the pre-end..then the abv washes over you. Imperial for sure...this brew is not for the everyone.

S: Sweet dark chocolate aroma with a strong roast backbone, as it warmed up the chocolate became more pronounced and a slightly alcoholic aroma was noticable. A Cinnamon, anise also as it warmed up. Noble type hop aroma but over powered by the complex malt scents.  T: Dark chocolate, cocoa nibs, molassis, and pruney raisin malt flavors all distinctly right on the first sip. wow. Sweetness is kept in check with the strong upfront dank hop bitterness. The chocolatey to roasty flavor is on the chocolate side which i'm a fan of. As it warms up the bitterness almost seems to become more assertive. The aftertaste finishes with a chocolate piney thing.  M: A warming alcohol is there but not as strong as most RIS, low carbonation and a large chewy full body. Surprisingly no harshness from the roasted / dark malts, very nice.

Mug fills pitch black, dark chocolate brown head of maybe 1/4 inch pops up & vanishes just as quick to mere edge fizz. Smell is dark cocoa, something bread-like, bit in the background like cinnamon.  Taste heads the direction of high grade coffee, though the chocolate is still there. Wow is it there! Anonymous bitterness peaks through to cut the sweetness, which must've taken a crapton of hops to accomplish considering how much of a malt bomb this is. Goes down rich, creamy, barely carbonated to a tickle, and the double digit alcohol warms without really sticking up otherwise.  This imperial ticks the expected boxes, but overachieves at most.

147,1160,StoutHunter,4.28,"I picked up a bottle of Stone's Imperial Russian Stout a couple weeks ago for $6.99 at The Lager Mill. I've been wanting to try this beer for awhile so when I saw it on the shelf I quickly grabbed a couple bottles so I could finally give this beer a try, lets see how it goes. 2013 Vintage. Poured from a brown 22oz bottle into a snifter.  A- The bottle looks nice, it got a nice clean and classy look to it, but it isn't that eye catching. It poured a dark black color that didn't let any light come through with three fingers worth of dark tan head that was on the border of being brown and it left lots of nice lacing behind. This is a very good looking RIS, the color, head, and lacing were all spot on for the style.  S- The aroma starts off with a medium amount of sweetness followed by loads of dark roasted malts that imparted to great roasted, chocolate/cocoa and coffee like aromas. Up next comes a medium amount of dark fruits with plums seeming to stick out the most and there's a lighter alcohol aroma lingering in the background. The aroma was pretty good, it was just what I look for in the aroma of an RIS.  T- The taste seems to be very similar to the aroma and it starts off with a slightly higher amount of medium sweetness followed by a good amount of roasted malts with all the aspects that I picked up in the aroma showing up with cocoa showing up the most with the coffee staying in the background. Up next comes a lighter amount of medium dark fruits with plums still sticking out the most and adding a little bit of complexity to this beer. On the finish there's a medium amount of warming alcohol that wasn't that boozy tasting and a slightly lighter amount of medium bitterness with a very roasty aftertaste. This was pretty good tasting beer, it had all the aspects I look for in the style with a little bit of complexity.  M- Fairly smooth, fairly warming, creamy, slightly sticky, on the lighter side of being full bodied with a slightly lower amount of medium carbonation. The mouthfeel was pretty good and it worked very well with this beer.  Overall I thought this was a pretty damn good beer and a very good example of the style, Founders Imperial Stout it still my favorite, but this beer isn't too far behind it and had all the aspects that I look for in the style. This beer had pretty good drinkability, it was fairly smooth, medium warming and the flavors did a good job at holding my attention, this isn't the kind of beer that I would drink multiple bottles of but I wouldn't mind having a bomber to myself and I think it's pretty drinkable for the style. What I liked the most about this beer was how true to style it was, this is a textbook RIS and nothing about it is out of place for the style. What I like the least about this beer was how warming the alcohol was, it wasn't overwhelming but I wish it was toned down just a little. I would buy this beer again, I think it's priced nicely and it's dead on for the style, i'm glad I bought a couple bottles to cellar, I might have to grab a couple more and I will for sure be buying some when it's released next year, I think this also has the potential to age well. All in all i was pretty happy with this beer, I had heard it was good and it didn't disappoint, it was a great straight forward RIS that I really enjoyed drinking and while it's not my favorite it is up there as one of the better RIS I have had. Good job guys, this is one great stout.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,96
147,1160,suspect,4.42,"2013 Vintage.  Poured from a 22oz bottle into a Real Ale snifter.  A: Pours like new motor oil out of it's plastic container. Creamy thick light brown head rises up from the depths of the black hell that is this beer and slowly grows thicker and higher until it reaches its pinnacle. Only to grasp and miss at the freedom it seeks outside the glass before it fades slow down the sides clinging to every inch of the sides of the glass on the way down. Lacing is incredibly thick and plentiful  S: Usual suspects for Russian Imperial Stouts - cocoa, roasted dark malts, slight coffee, dark fruits. ABV is present but blended in nicely with the rest of the ingredients. This is a perfect meld of aromas.  T: Cocoa hits first...fine dark imported swiss cocoa. Followed quickly by hop bitterness that does just enough to take over for the natural bitterness brought on by the pure cocoa. Next comes the sweetness brought on by some excellent dark roasted malts that really make this beer shine. ABV is hiding like a shadow in the dark...not to be seen but most certainly to be felt if crossed. Really leaves a wonderful lingering aftertaste that pulls me back in for sip after sip after sip. She's a relentless, yet satisfying beast.  M: Damn perfect mouthfeel. Creamy, big finish but quick and smooth. Carbonation is like the perfect professional sports referee - never noticed but absolutely effective. Mouth coating is superb and leaves me continuously grasping for more.  O: A complete homerun of a stout. I don't think there is a better staple beer than this one. God damn Stone is good at making beautiful exquisite go-to beers that are just always there when you need them. Like the perfect marriage.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,96
147,1160,ISmith87,4.56,"Poured from a 22 oz bomber. Just had the Espresso Imperial Russian Stout yesterday and it made me want to review the original all over again to compare! So I'll review this beer independently and then look at my review of the Espresso version from yesterday and see what I think...  Appearance - the beer is really dark brown, basically black with about 2 fingers of dark tan head that sticks around for a while and then settles down to a thin film on top of the beer. Surprisingly it's not lacing the glass at all today.  Smell - Big chocolate and coffee notes, dark fruits (Figs, plums), caramel, chocolate malt  Taste - A lot of coffee/chocolate flavor with a nice coffee taste as it settles out, some dark fruits in there, a big nice roasted flavor. The alcohol is present but is nicely warming, and completely appropriate for the style.  Mouthfeel - Thick, nice and creamy, leaves a roasted coffee aftertaste. The alcohol is present but blends with everything else.  Overall - Great beer! It's definitely one of the best IRS's that I've had, and would be amazing on a cold winter day. Everything blends and the coffee aftertaste is awesome.  SO HOW DO STONE IRS AND STONE ESPRESSO IRS COMPARE?  Stone Espresso IRS was significantly better, probably the best IRS I've had. The head sticks around for longer and leaves a nicer lacing on the glass, while basically the same color, and it looks creamier. The smell is creamier and hides the alcohol better. The taste has vanilla and creamy milk flavors in it that I just don't taste as much with the original. I said yesterday that the Stone Espresso IRS drinks like a chocolate milkshake in beer form, and the original is a little less thick. Overall, for 50 cents more a bomber I'd go with the Stone Espresso IRS, it's just better.

S - Dark fruits, alcohol, cocoa, and maybe some coffee T - Dark fruits, the coffee, hops, cocoa, and then at last a nice touch of alcohol which I enjoy M - Starts out as I'd expect with a thick body and then it lingers around a while leaving my mouth a sticky mess and I deserve it and I like that. O - This beer is better than it needs to be for 8.50 a bomber. It is a treat that is luckily easy to find in my area. I live in a small town and I find bottles two years old sometimes tucked away in the back of poorly operated stores. I have a few tucked away.

S - Deep roasted malts, chocolate, coffee, dark fruits(raisins and plums). This is the definition of what a RIS should smell like in my book.  T - First you are hit with sweet chocolate malts at the front followed by the dark fruits with a slight deep cherry bitter sweetness. In the finish you get some nice bitter coffee notes and a mild bitter chocolate note. Amazingly complex!  M - Very heavy and thick, almost a sticky syrupy texture however extremely smooth and very drinkable.  O - This is probably one of the best beers I have ever had. It is so complex however extremely smooth and drinkable. Almost no alcohol is present and this is a fresh bottle. Awesome job Stone!",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,96
147,1160,WildMaverick1200,4.49,"After wanting to try this for a long time, I finally found it at the store.  Pouring the beer feels a lot like pouring oil - heavy, thick and dark. The color is a dark brown/black which seems impenetrable by light. A nice yellow and slow-bubbling head develops to reveal a surprisingly sweet aroma of malts, alcohol and some coffee.  The taste is like a fine morning espresso, powerful, complex, bitter and yet, not too strong or senseless. It is very thick and the alcohol is very evident in the aftertaste. It's like a dark, evil syrup. I am surprised though, that the beer is incredibly soft and palatable for an imperial stout. Drinking this kind of beer usually means getting ready to be kicked in the face by a horse, and yet, the Stone Imperial is surprisingly smoother and softer than many other stouts with less alcohol, including guinness foreign extra.  If Duvel had a stout sister, Stone Imperial would definitely be that sister. It's surprisingly smooth, but Hulk-strong. Bitter, yet not enough to prevent you from enjoying it. What a wonderful brew. Certainly something you might want to consider sharing with your friends over some sweet chocolate dessert. Fantastic.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,96
147,1160,Kuaff,4.55,"From bomber to snifter at cellar temperature, duh.  'Tis a black beer. After the one-finger, chocolaty mocha-brown head dies down, I peer into the glass and see a perfect reflection of myself in the shiny, black surface. Like an obsidian mirror, it is.  The smell is a REALLY rich one of coffee and dark chocolate, but also with a sweet maltiness that keeps these traits from being harsh. There's also an intoxicating scent of fruity cherries and raisins.  Flavor-wise, this stout is astonishingly well-rounded and has refined intesity, drawing me in with seductive subtlety at first. It utilizes three well-honed weapons: sweet chocolate, bitter coffee, and tart dark fruitiness, all of which work together in a perfected, sublime harmony. Beneath it all there is also a mysterious roasted earthiness. By the way, where's the alcohol? There's hardly a trace in the taste.  It has a thick feel with moderate carbonation. Like with everything else, all is in balance.  This imperial stout's characteristics are in total harmony. It has achieved zen enlightenment.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,96
147,1160,falloutsnow,3.43,"2012 Stone RIS Pours a 2cm head of dark tan to brown foam, densely packed, small bubbles on bottom with medium-sized ones persisting on the top. Head has above-average retention, lasting a few minutes and leaving some substantial spiderwebs of lace on the glass as it descends to a thick ring around the glass and a thin island of foam atop the body. Body is an opaque dark brown to black color, carbonation is not visible either in the center or through the sides of the glass.  Aroma primarily of roasted malt (charred toast) and ethanol, with notes of chocolate, anise, and sweet, dried fruit (prune) esters.  There is no clearly discernible flavor of chocolate, roasted coffee, charred grains, vanilla, ethanol, or anise, but these all exist within the beer, blended with precision and efficiency. Ethanol flavor noticed starting at the back of the palate, becoming increasingly strong as the beer warms. Lingering aftertaste of pure dark chocolate, burnt grains, and ethanol.  Beer's body is heavy, with mid-level carbonation that creates a thick and slightly foamy mouthfeel. Alcohol burn noticeable from mid-palate onwards, particularly in nostrils and throat. Finish is dry, with slight stickiness around the palate.  Not sure why this is such a highly rated imperial stout, as the ethanol isn't well-contained, and the flavors are rather muddied and obtuse.  2013 Stone RIS This is my second year trying Stone's RIS, and my impressions the first year do not seem to be incorrect: the ethanol isn't well-contained, the flavors are largely an undecipherable merger of roasted malt and booze, the aroma isn't particularly noteworthy, and this feels warmer on the palate than an alcohol-heavy mouthwash. Definitely a very average beer that's overrated, one I won't seek out again.

Body is an opaque dark brown to black color, opaque, carbonation is not visible either in the center or through the sides of the glass.  Aroma of moderately dense milk milk chocolate, toasted marhmallow and bread, and vanilla extract in ethanol. Considering the brewery, I'm surprised at how this is not an over the top roasted malt, hop, or ethanol bomb.  Major flavors are of mild milk chocolate with fairly potent ethanol and more modest burnt bread, anise, and marshmallow flavors. Front of palate picks up roasted malt, burnt toast and marshmallow, anise, and slight ethanol. Mid palate experiences milk chocolate, burnt toast and marshmallow, and ethanol. Back of palate notes ethanol, prune ester, anise, milk chocolate, burnt bread. Aftertaste of bittersweet chocolate, charred toast, mild bitterness, and faint ethanol.

Taste was much the same, very rich and full bodied, complex and luxurious.  I had tried this early on in my craft beer adventure. It was a current vintage, and I remember it being bold, rich, and super thick.

Moderate lacing  Aroma: Very roasty. Lots of coffee/espresso. Big dark chocolate notes. Faintly nutty. Brown sugar throughout. Very sweet  Taste: Sweet chocolate and creamy coffee upfront. Surprisingly pleasant earthy hop profile in the mid-palate. Fruity citrus notes before chocolate takes over. The finish is bittersweet roasty again leaning more to the sweet side. Rich and decadent  Mouthfeel: Full-bodied and coating. There is a slight warming feeling from the alcohol but its well-hidden otherwise  Overall: Well-balanced. Bittering just before it gets too sweet and then finishing sweetly before it gets too bitter. A great example of the style but not my favorite. Absolutely worth getting nonetheless.

Picked up a bomber of this fine brew, served in a goblet.  Seriously dark brown, basically near-black and opaque, with a firm, tight and persistent mocha-tan head.  Nose is toasted malt and dark chocolate, a bit of coffee.  Lots of roasted malts up front with unmistakable chocolate overtones, drying to a very nice espresso bitterness on the finish.  Full bodied with a nice creaminess to the texture.  Overall, an excellent representative of the imperial stout style, very rich and flavorful, perfect to warm you up on a cold summer evening.

S- Strong caramel mingles with milk chocolate, cream, molasses, bread, cereal, dark fruit, and notes of coffee. Stone IRS taxes the nose with a rich, complex bouquet that is just downright titillating.  T- The gargoyle does not disappoint! Roasted malts, caramel, toffee, and brown sugar give way to a slightly hoppy, bitter and roasty malt finish that's smoothed out with cream. Dark roasted malts and- maybe even a little smoke- linger long on the palate. The delightfully bitter finish demands that sweet, creamy front. You will find it hard to put this stout down. Alcohol is imperceptible due to the immense flavor until it warms the throat.  M- This Imperial is a heavy weight. It is thick with moderate carbonation to cleanse your tongue.

Appearance: Pours a dark thick opaque midnight brown, the head a slight dark tan rising to at least a finger's length. Looks absolutely fabulous.  Smell: Weakest property of the beer, still me rating it at a four should tell you something. Strong roasted chocolate that goes in and out  Taste: A dark chocolate, light coffee bean feel. The flavors are complex you feel a sweetness to it which is ridiculously easy to love. Unique bitterness makes this brew a classic.

It pours thick and syrupy and creates a frothy beige head that retains well and leaves tan lacing all over the glass.  S: Roasted, slightly burnt black coffee. Strong roasted grain aroma as well. Everyone seems to agree that the chocolate notes are the strongest, but I was only picking up subtle traces of chocolate in the nose. Hints of alcohol seep through.  T: A very rich and complex combination of dark chocolate, caramelized brown sugar and some roasted black coffee. The chocolate seems to be the lingering flavor, with a quick twang of warm alcohol and caramel in the finish. Strong roasted grain flavors remain after the beer has gone down.  M: Nearly syrupy. Very thick. Very full-bodied. Very mild, but still evident, carbonation makes this one go down smooth. 10.6% ABV, you say? Funny... Doesn't feel like it...  O: This is an extremely deceiving brew.

Made the mistake of pouring a little too fast as I wasn't seeing much of a head. Mistake! Head then blew up into a gorgeous, thick, brown colored, creamy looking froth. Beer is pitch black, even in the light. A small area just underneath the head was a dark red-brown when shined into light.  S - Lot's of sweet malt, some toffee/caramel, and coffee. A very slight alcohol smell noticed when warmed. Even a touch fruity when warmed, which I thought was interesting.  T - A wonderful tasting beer. Sweet malts, coffee, a dairy-type creaminess. The coffee was especially noticeable in the aftertaste. Can only imagine how intense their Espresso IRS is. When warmed, a bit of booze could be tasted, as could some warmth. Also noticed a peppery taste when warmed a bit. Interesting and delicious.  F - It's a stout, so of course it's thick. Felt a little sticky when warmed. Call me a novice or whatever, but although the taste was just as good when the beer warmed a tad, I preferred the feeling when it was colder. Just a little less sticky.  O - A delicious IRS, and it certainly deserves the acclaim it gets. Lot's of stuff going on in this one, all the normal stout flavors, with my palete noticing some fruit and pepper. Interesting and unexpected. But in a good way. Certainly a sipping beer not for the faint of heart. Thick as heck, and won't be liked by most.

Dark chocolate and coffee up front with a nice roasted malt middle and finished off with a nice malty coffee like acidity that finishes dryer than ou would expect. Nothing crazy but executed better than almost any other brewery  Mouthfeel - A very thick stout that works perfectly for the beer and really coats the mouth at all the right times and places  Overall - This is one of the best standard Russian Imperial Stouts out there.

Overall, this is a great russian Imperial stouts. I would have to say that it tastes very similar to the Espresso Imperial Russian Stout, except this one doesn't include the espresso bomb flavor that the other has.

Smells of dark roasted oats and cocoa with a hint of coffee and dark fruits. Tons of roasted notes.  Taste hits right off the bat with the roasted cocoa and subtle coffee notes. There's a slight hop feel in there that I'm surprised isn't getting completely covered up by the dark roasted character. A portion of the taste reminds me of the dark fruity notes that quads might have. Definitely a flavorful offering that doesn't disappoint. A hint of it's abv does come through but what's nice about it is the subtle hops and roasted malts help cover this up.  Mouthfeel is actually quite moderately carbonated. It is viscus but the carbonation helps it feel a touch lighter than it is.  Overall, this is a fantastic example of a Russian Imperial Stout. It's so flavorful and balanced yet offers something you can't really find in other RIS's. It's hard to explain but this is that one beer you need to try if you like the style.

S: Smell is strongly of milk chocolate and caramel, neither of which the bottle warns me of. Upon warming, dark fruit and coffee become evident, as does the alcohol. Despite its best warnings, I cannot detect anise in the nose. Not an unpleasant smell, but almost a little cloying. I am glad the beer tastes a little less sweet than it smells.

For its price, it's definitely very good in its style. Not sure if I could recommend it over Old Rasputin, which is comparably affordable (even cheaper) and has the advantage of coming in 12oz bottles.

Fans of chocolaty stouts have to love this one. Sweet, but really dry on the finish surprisingly. The roast is kept pretty low and the fruit is maybe a tic below medium. Enough hops on the finish to barely be noticeable, and the mouthfeel is rich without being chewy.

147,1160,BigBarley,3.97,"Pours like motor oil, jet black, with a respectable khaki-brown head that recedes quickly to a light ring. Looks like an RIS if I've ever seen one..  Aroma is almost 100% licorice, behind it are very faint notes of chocolate and roasty malt goodness. If the nose is any indicator, this will be a stout for lovers of Anise.  Hmmm. Up front there's an extreme anise attack, with underlying notes of roasted malt. It's almost 2-dimensional, but still pleasing and fitting of the style. If you aren't a fan of licorice dominating your RIS, you need to try this beer's Espresso counterpart, but this one is definitely an anise-bomb. Hints of dark fruit are noticeable, and there's a bit of alcohol warmth, but it adds to the flavor instead of being off-putting. Without the alcohol notes, there'd be just licorice. This has enough thrown in to keep it interesting.  Thick, though not the muddiest of the muddy. Enough carbonation to drink well, enough body to keep you satisfied. Filling, and holding on to a nice bite from the carbonation. Enjoyable drinker for sure.  All in all, I'd prefer to have discovered a little more complexity in this beer, but even so, the anise is not as off-putting as some reviews lead me to believe.

A: Beautiful thick, dark black/brown body with a light brown head. Sticks slightly to the glass as it falls. Dark enough as to not let any light in.  S: Smells of dark coffee and chocolate. Interestingly, there is also a bit of spice in there. This helps keep it light and not overwhelm the palate.  T: Dark and roasted, as to be expected. Aftertaste is heavily of coffee notes that sit on your tongue. At the end, as with the smell, there is a bit of spice and citrus.  M: A bit thin at this point in it's aging.

Appearance: Dark and thick during the pour, but it's a little hard to see through a ceramic mug. A tiny head appeared and faded within about a minute. Looks like a RIS should.  Smell: Less burnt and bitter characteristics than some RIS's. Predominantly getting the smell of milk chocolate ... like those found from melting chocolate in a chocolate shop. Additionally, I get a little bit of vanilla if I inhale long enough. Maybe a little coconut? It smells absolutely delicious.  Taste: Very tasty! Initial flavor comprised of malt grain, with a surprising bitterness that almost tastes like baking chocolate. After bitterness fades, the real beauty begins. The chocolate comes through again, but in more of a sweet milk chocolate variety.  Mouthfeel: Heavy body with low carbonation. A little sticky, but not in a gross way.  Overall: I am enjoying this beer ... a lot! The Espresso version of this beer is a little better, to me, as it adds the coffee in a subtle manner without going over the top. However, if you don't want any coffee flavor this beer is so subtle, balanced, and tasty, with the perfect mouthfeel for the style.

Almost has a consistency of a creamy & thickened iced latte (which isn't a bad thing IMO). I love it.  O: What can I say, Stone's IRS has always been one of my favorite imperial stouts, and will continue to be.

Aroma is dark, rich and robust. Full of coffee, tobacco, pine needles, oatmeal, oak chips, maple and gingerbread. Highly complex and well rounded. The bitter, sweet and spicy notes all seem to compliment eachother as I inhale the delicate aroma.  Tons of roastiness in the flavor which is hard to pinpoint due to the overwhelming complexity. Baking chocolate is probably the most prominent along with dark roast coffee, tobacco, smoked woods and charcoal-blackened chicken. Dry malt character overall. Hop notes are subtle at first teasing the tongue with earthy, pine-like qualities. Just a touch of licorice spice. Not a whole lot of sweetness to balance this one. Finishes with a tart and bitter hop character that combats the roasty baking chocolate flavor. Descent, not great, balance in this one. Almost acidic in the finish.  Full bodied and well textured. Loads of carbonation for such a strong beer.  Overall: very well done with a few minor complaints. Love the complexity in both aroma and flavor but could use some more balance. Also, seems to get more hoppy and bitter as it warms which opposed the expectation for the style.

Looks good enough, pretty standard really.  Not a big nose on this one either. The usual sweet dark malts. Just slightly alcoholic, not near as much alcohol as the 2011 which was drank fairly fresh.  Tast is quite good. Toffee, caramel, dark chocolate and a slight tinge of alcohol. The alcohol is very well hidden and probably tamed down with 3+ years in the cellar. Not a single note of oxidation, no dark fruit, cobwebs or cardboard. I believe this beer to age like a Boss!!!  Nice thick mouthfeel.  Overall this is a great RIS! It's a cellar champ.

A decent amount of lacing is left on the glass.  The nose is cold black coffee, burnt notes from the malted barley and a slight smell of alcohol. The nose is fairly subdued.  The taste is of black coffee, dark chocolate, a high level of bitterness most likely from the malt and a slight taste of alcohol. A good thick mouthfeel.  This is a fairly classic Russian Imperial Stout, not overly complex and definetly not lacking.

147,1160,ThisWangsChung,2.95,"2012 scores (4.5/3.5/4/4/4.5)  After having the 2013 vintage (and the Espresso version), I can now safely say this isn't quite for me. While it looks good and has a big feel, I just don't care for all the licorice in the flavor profile. And that's the problem here - it's too licorice dominant with no real complexity, depth, or even bold flavor. The thick, viscous mouthfeel means little if it doesn't have a great taste to prop it up.  I've got another bottle, and that one won't be cracked open until after tax season...in 2014. Right now, I can think of quite a few readily available imperial stouts that wipe the floor with this one.  ---  Poured into a Williamsburg Winery wine glass.  A: Pours a damn near pitch black body with good thickness and viscosity. The head is a two finger light tan color with excellent texture, decent retention, and solid lacing.  S: All the usual RIS notes are here; slight soy, dry baker's chocolate, roasted malt, coffee, leather, and tobacco nicely mingle on the nose. While it's a nice melange, it's too subdued, much to its detriment.  T: The flavor starts off with some dark fruit notes (raisins, currants, plums) along side some leather and licorice. Afterward, it progresses toward dark chocolate and roast notes, and it finishes salty and slightly boozy. There are hints of tobacco and piny hops throughout the flavor progression. Balance is decent, but not impeccable, as it slightly leans towards fruitiness. On the plus side, it featured the kind of complexity I was expecting from a beer of this caliber.  M: Decently heavy with good viscosity and low carbonation, with a dry finish, almost to the point of causing the mouth to water. The aftertaste lingers nicely with dried dark fruits. Touches of alcohol can be felt on the tongue, throat, and stomach.  O: A tough beer to digest at first - but one that rewards its drinker with good complexity and a breadth of flavor storytelling. It isn't immensely drinkable, but then again, something like this should be savored slowly. Given its price point, it's one I can heartily recommend.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,96

S-An intense, but balanced, mixture of rich, dark roasted coffee, dark chocolate, and a hint of char. As the beer warms up, I detect more dark, dried fruits like raisins and prunes. Alcohol is pretty well integrated for 10.5%.  T-The taste follows the smell pretty closely in both intensity and profile. I get roasted coffee, chocolate, and sweet, dark, dried fruits. Malts certainly dominate, but this fresh bottle still had traces of hops, as well. The alcohol is well concealed at 50 degrees, but as the brew warms, you get some pretty serious fruity, sweet, heat. The heat, however, fits nicely with brew. The finish is long and satisfying.  M-The feel is medium body with a bit more carbonation that some other examples of the style. The carbonation is mild and creamy, and actually diffuses the alcohol heat, I think.  O-This is a great and classic-tasting RIS. The flavors are intense, but well-balanced, and everything seems to work well together. There is no standout characteristic to throw the equilibrium of this beer out of whack.

SMELL: Roasty notes of coffee through first in the IRS's nose with a twinge of bitter dark chocolate underneath.  TASTE: The coffee is still the star of the show here, but the chocolate notes come through a lot stronger and they're accented by a pleasant hop bitterness.  MOUTHFEEL: For such an oily looking pour, the body is much lighter than expected. A light carbonation tickles the back of the mouth as it goes down smooth.

While the anise/licorice is powerful, it is not overwhelming. There is always enough rich malt backbone to balance it out. Alcohol is assertive throughout. Finish leaves something to be desired, a bit bland.  Mouthfeel is fantastic. Very creamy and smooth. Makes me want to go back for another sip. Exactly what I want from and RIS.  Glad I finally tried this one. Would definitely buy again when I am looking for a change of pace. An interesting take on the style. It does not have the complexity of others, such as Founders Imperial Stout, but still very enjoyable. I like what Stone has done here.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,96
147,1160,trxxpaxxs,4.39,"Thanks to sliverx for this one... 2007 vintage...  A: Pours black with almost no head whatsoever. All that shows is tiny ring of exceptionally small bubbles around the edges of the glass. There is no lacing to speak of.  S: The nose is raisins, dates, chocolate, and malt.  T: The taste follows the nose. At first I am hit with raisins and dates and other fruity sweetness. The chocolate notes begin to shine as it reaches the middle of the palate. The finish is chocolaty and malty.  M: Full bodied beer. It's incredibly smooth and silky. It hits the palate hard, but slides off nicely.  O: This is a very good imperial stout, and it has held up excellently since 2007. The flavors are still vibrant, and I don't detect much oxidation in the beer.

Majority of the flavor is like the scent. Chocolate, coffee, and a hint of vanilla.  M.Full body. Not too thick, goes down real smooth.  Overall this is a good Russian Imperial Stout.

147,1160,kagent777,4.11,"22 oz bottle purchased in Las Vegas from the 2011 release. This one is poured into my CCB snifter.  Appearance: Pours thick with a nice deep tan head about one finger thick. Leaves nice lacing on the glass.  Smell: Cocoa, roast, coffee, spice and dried dark fruit (black cherries).  Taste: Semisweet bakers chocolate, roast with a bit of char, subtle dark fruits. This one is nice and complex. No American hops flavors, but a general bitterness on the back end from the generous hopping.  Mouthfeel: Thick and almost syrupy with a huge body. Almost too many residuals here. The carbonation is low and soft, great for the style.  Overall: A very tasty IRS, a little on the sweet side for me.

147,1160,CurtFromHershey,4.46,"2011 bottle, poured into a spiegelau tulip. Rich, almost black color. Huge dense beige head which would probably still linger if you left it sit out for a year. Ridiculous lacing. Sexy,sexy beer.  Smell is somewhat boozy, but like a fine liquor. Subtle aromas of vanilla bean and cappuccino.  Taste is much more chocolate malt forward than I anticipated given the nose, a welcome surprise. Strong roasty finish. No alcohol detected at all.  Mouthfeel is thick and creamy. Beer has certainly he'd its carbonation since '11.  Overall a great beer that probably deserves more credit. Somewhat overshadowed by the bastards I think. Will buy in the future. Thanks to danwho for this extra.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,96
147,1160,Neorebel,4.76,"Fantastic thick oily black look to this one, topped with a nice fluffy tan head. There is proper lacing going on later as I drink the beer down. As for the aroma, I am primarily enjoying dark fruit esters such as raisin & fig. The taste is smooth and sublime... very balanced between the dominant aforementioned dark fruits, molasses, toasted malt, and even a faint hopped flavor that edges its way in. The mouth feel and alcohol heat are just right, not too heavy like you may assume. Pleasantly dry finish that leaves you thirsting for more... Overall a practically perfect RIS!",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,96
147,1160,barczar,4.22,"2012 vintage.  Pours an opaque onyx with a foamy half inch chocolate head that dissipates slowly, leaving light lacing.  Nutty, toasted malt, dark berries, and light notes of chocolate and roast malt form the initial aroma. A bit more subtle than expected. Raisins emerge as it warms.  Deeply caramelized malt, toffee, burnt breadcrust, brown sugar, coffee, and chocolate are evident in the initial sip. Dark berries, raisins, and a bit of sherry underlie the flavor profile. The finish is fairly roasty and a touch dry.  Body is fairly thick, with carbonation on the low side, and significant alcohol warmth.  Excellent combination of roast character and fruity esters. Just enough sweetness to counter the roast dryness. A bit alcoholic, but delicious.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,96

The pour is black with a modest, silky brown head that settles down after a moment to a ring around the glass.  Loads of interesting aroma including dark roasted malts, currants or other dark fruits, coffee, and a mellow hop note that some might think is alcohol.  The body is bold and smooth.  The taste is vibrant with mouth coating dark malts, sweetness, and a mild lingering hop bitterness. But smooth. The 10%+ alcohol is well-integrated into this beer yet it brings on a definite light-headedness if drunk too quickly.

147,1160,RyanGoodman,4.83,"This is my celebration beer for receiving residency status here in Bolivia. One of the 5 beers I brought with me in my luggage. This is the 2012 iteration of Stone's IRS.  The head on this beer commands attention. Billowy, creamy head, at least half an inch. It climbs up the glass, as if yearning to be drank, savored, enjoyed.  I have to say the smell is slightly off the norm for my opinion of RIS's. I'm not saying that it's not good. But, it's definitely hop forward in the nose. This is no surprise coming from Stone. That being said, you can detect the firm malt base. Roasty, burnt nuts...which compliments the intensely hopped nature of the beer.  First sip verifies what the nose suggests. Hops wash across the palate, followed by deeply, well roasted malts. A kick of bakers chocolate, strongly bitter....also complimenting the hop additions. There is something deeper, more complex in this beer. I believe it is the yeast strain, manifesting itself together with the alcohol presence. The alcohol is not overpowering, as many RIS's are more than 10.5% these days. The lingering finish is...bitter, as expected. But a welcoming bitterness, craving another sip. I think I will. Ahh yes, as room temperature finds this brew, it exhibits a finely tuned coffee flavor. And it doesn't just suggest coffee, but makes it's presence known with spikes of espresso/whole bean chewiness. Very nice indeed.  The mouthfeel is hansomely creamy. Not overly heavy nor weak and thin. A perfect balance.  Overall, a very worthy beer for a celebration. The question is, am I worthy enough to fully appreciate how well crafted this beer is? Stone, thank you. Thank you for providing me with 2 of the 5 beers that I brought with me to live in the southern continent! Thankfully I have 5 more waiting for me when I return, patiently waiting to be savored over the next few years. I'm anxious to see how the hops hold up with age, and to see how the darker flavors come to the fore. As close to perfect as can be at the age of just under one year.

Grain is borderline burnt, bittering. Some brown sugar sweetness comes in around the middle but cannot compete with the bitter black coffee finish.  M: Full bodied. Medium carbonation. Slightly wet.

147,1160,gr0g,4.3,"2012 Release, consumed on 1/25/2013. Having tried several other elite Imperial Stouts, Stone's loses a bit of lustre in comparison. Same aromatic profile as last year, but a noticeable fuel note even though this has sat for almost a year. Flavor is immensely malty, though still balanced. Bitter finish with hops shining through. Mouthfeel is good, but there's still room for improvement - could be chewier, smoother. This is a beast of stout that seems like it'll drink better with age. Let this one sit for a year or two for optimal enjoyment.  2011 Release. Intensely black, a taller than expected head, maybe two fingers or so, rises up. It fades to a ring of chocolate mousse colored foam clinging to the snifter. Huge aroma emanating from the glass: a spicy, tobacco-like note upfront, leading to a lots of cocoa powder amidst a background of coffee grinds.  Flavor is huge too - massive dark chocolate flavor, roasted, even charred malt sweetness equally met by bitterness from the roast and the hops. Alcohol warmth is felt but only barely detectable on the palate (in the aftertaste, along with a bit of lingering bitterness). Never have I had such a massively flavorful beer before; my only knock on this is that it feels a bit too carbonated.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,96

147,1160,jegross2,3.42,"Reviewing the Imperial Russian Stout (2012 vintage) from Stone Brewing Company out of Escondido, California. Score: 82  2012 vintage bottle purchased from a new bar in the Northwest Chicago Suburbs called ""The Beer Market."" Served in a snifter glass and enjoyed on 06/29/12. Review is from iPhone notes.  Appearance: Color is jet black with a thin strip of caramel of highlight atop the glass. Creamy mocha-colored head off the pour settles to a ring around glass. Average lacing, average lacing. 3.5/5  Smell: Milk chocolate, light roast and anise/black licorice. Hint of fig. Touch of dark chocolate too. 4/5  Taste: A lot more anise flavor on palate than nose. The bitter, acidic black licorice flavor is prevalent throughout. Chocolate and cocoa too. A little unsweetened dark fruit, and a straight alcoholic booziness towards finish that is ""metallic"" in flavor when the beer is on the colder side. A hint of roasted chocolate comes out as the beer warms up. 3/5  Mouthfeel: Medium bodied, low carbonation. Oily mouthfeel. Acidic, mildly bitter and surprisingly ""boozy."" 3.5/5  Overall: This is the first time that I have ever had this beer, and given its reputation, I must say that I was thoroughly disappointed. I found it to be nothing special, and way too boozy and licorice-forward. Given how much licorice flavor I got from this brew, I can only imagine how much is present in the Belgo-Anise variation from 2011. Still, you can't beat the price point...  Pairing: Stilton cheese.

No bitter aftertaste, which is great! Slightly hoppy. Tasted the dark chocolate in the end.  Very thick mouthfeel. Was pretty smooth.  I think this is the most balanced beer I have tasted to date.

No lacing and carbonation is unk. This is juggernaut of a stout. It drinks thick of roasted and burnt malts and it's flavor depth is almost endless. I can definitly pull out molasses and coffee, bittersweet chocolate, licorise or ouzo from Crete when we came home from the desert. Drinks smooth and heavy on the palette with a long lasting flavorful after taste. Oh, there is also sutle alcohol warming to finish it off.

This is probably not for everyone, but for stout lovers, this is definitely one to try. This one surprised me.

The color is so dark in the glass that the word ""black"" is all that comes to mind.  If the nose can be described as creamy than creamy it is. A smooth blend of milk chocolate, espresso more than coffee, and I sense vanilla or whipped cream on the back.  The mouthfeel is thick but smooth yet finishes a bit tinny  Roasted malt is at the front, no espresso but coffee on the tongue it finishes with a little alcohol. As the glass warms, the roasted malt comes out much better. I love the initial flavor, strong chocolate, strong malt.

147,1160,Converge,4.6,"2012 bomber into a tulip. Huge thanks to Matt for this bottle.  A - Pours black and viscous as hell, with a dense foamy cap of dark tan suds. A mean looking stout, with a nice bottle as well. Always a fan of printing on the bottle as opposed to putting a label on. Sticky webs of lace come and go as the brew sinks down the glass.  S - Aroma permeates the air the second the cap is popped. Burnt malt, coffee roast, cocoa nibs, a touch of anise and peppery spice. Earthy hops are subdued but loom in the background. Smells like a big stout should, roasty, dark, and with understated complexity. At 10.50% ABV I get no booze on the nose.  T - The first sip is an immediate blast of deliciousness. Malts charred black and burnt, with big coffee roast adding to the cacophony of dark abrasive flavors. Earthy hops linger throughout the finish, dank and resinous, but subtle. Cocoa, molasses, and anise all add to the complexity, creating a delicious profile that rivals any stout I've tried before. A touch of spice, and bits of dark fruit round out an already superb profile. There's a smokey/woodsy aspect here I'm really enjoying as well. As it warms I get some sweet residual sweetness, caramelized sugars, and bourbon vanilla. Near flawless.  M - Thick and viscous, with low carbonation and a body that couldn't get any more full and chewy. Maybe not the smoothest, creamiest stout I've tried, but it's up there. Finishes dry and slightly bittering, with a sticky feel after a while.  D - A benchmark for the style to be certain. Everything about this brew is dead on, from the dark roasty profile, to the pungent bouquet, to the massive mouthfeel it packs. Well rounded, but assertive and even abrasive. This is exactly what an RIS should be. Interested to see what happens with my other bottle after some aging. If I had just one complaint, it would be that for 10.50% ABV, I expected a bit more flavor; I've had 9.00% stouts that pack just as much as this one does, and I was hoping the slight increase in ABV over some other stouts would provide even more flavor than a traditional RIS.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,96
147,1160,BeerDocT,3.83,"2012 vintage.  -Appearance 4.0: Poured out a thick, jet-black stream. Very small head and I really cranked the pour. Completely black and opaque in the glass. Like a tiny black hole in my glass sucking up all light anywhere around it.  -Smell 3.5: Nice bouquet, but very subdued. I smell the typical toasted grains and hops, but also notes of dark chocolate and coffee. The bouquet seems flat in the middle somehow.  -Taste 4.0: Front is a little on the sweet side and quickly fades into a very smooth middle that is more sweet than malty with lots of gently blended hops jumping around from foreground to background. The sometimes unpleasant ""bleu chesse"" hop is not present in this beer, which is good. Finish is very nice: cocoa powder accentuated with alkaline hoppiness. Aftertaste is not very long, is smooth and somewhat raisiny.  -Mouthfeel 3.5: Very smooth mouthfeel; good blending of carbonation.  -Overall 4.0: Good, not great, Imperial Stout. Don't get me wrong, this is a good beer, but it is missing a depth of flavor, particularly in the fore-palate, that I have found so pleasant and satisfying in other Imperial Stouts. This baby is over 10% ABV and it is completely unnoticeable. Great ""starter"" Imperial before moving on to more nuanced versions.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,96

The body is ink-black, and there's lots of alcohol legs on the glass (not much in the way of lacing).  Nothing about this bottle blew me away. I probably aged it a year longer than it needed to be. But what's here is remarkably smooth and well-integrated. The hops stick around just a bit to lend the nose an attractive minty note. Otherwise, the aroma is all deep roast, coffee, and prune.  Any complexity this beer once had has smoothed away into what is a pretty much a cohesive flavor. It's chocolate meets purple fruit. Not much roast. Just dark malts. A touch of malted milk as the bottle gets to room temperature. Very nice, but not amazing. A bit of cardboardy oxidation.  Overall, I'd say drink yer 2008 bottles if you have any.

147,1160,tobelerone,4.3,"2011 vintage. A surprisingly top-notch Imperial Stout; despite its lofty spot on the BA rankings it’s always a pleasure to find a beer of this quality just sitting on shelves at a perfectly reasonable price.  Pours jet black, tight, creamy brown head; strong retention and lace; chocolate forward aroma with moderate roastiness; hints of anise; faded but lingering hops; very faint booze. The flavor is really nice and well-rounded, balancing some roasted, hoppy bitterness with a bit of sugary sweetness that’s very much in check and is never cloying. Both bitter and milk chocolate flavors emerge, although not quite as prominently as in the aroma. Again there is a light hit of anise and restrained booze; molasses, and faint coffee notes although that is clearly a tertiary flavor component.  Full bodied but not massive; medium to slightly low in carbonation, so it’s very much alive but not fizzy at all; quite smooth and creamy with just a touch of chewy stickiness. Really a pleasure to drink; I’ll grab this anytime I see it from now on and stash them in the cellar. Again it’s a phenomenal buy at 5 or 6 bucks a bomber.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,96

147,1160,BradtheGreat7,4.5,"Review taken from notes- may 2012 **2012 IRS**  1 pint 6 oz brown bomber style bottle with awesome stone artwork with the usual gargoyle sitting upon the front of the bottle. Poured into an authentic Stone Imperial Russian Stout glass.  A - about as black as you'll find in a brew. I mean this is the blackest of black with touches of so dark brown it's ridiculous cutting through the edges in the light. Hell, it may even be black as well. A mean brown head sits on top with some good stick to the walls of the glass that bears it's name.  S - Roasted chocolate and black roasted malt up front. Some molasses and hints of sticky caramel down within the depths of this black pit of a liquid. Dark fruits with some tight spice of alcohol finish out a brilliant aroma.  T - A complexity of malt character. Black and chocolate Malts with roasted black coffee. Sweet molasses and caramel stay true to the style it represents. Roasted barley and a slight smokey character. Good portion of dark fruit. Bitter hops and alcohol spice round out the flavor very nicely.  M - Thick and chewy bottle completely coats the mouth leaving a massive stout that's hearty and very enjoyable. Thickness allows for a smooth experience. Some brewers miss the mark with the RIS simply because they make it too thin. Stone nails the thickness with this and allows us to enjoy this super stout.  O - This massive stout is top shelf. The class Stone puts in this bottle is 2nd to none and can be enjoyed when first released or after it sits in your personal cellar awhile. Most Russian Imperial Stouts call for some sitting to get the smooth easy drinking brew, but not this one. It's ready to go from its release. Sure it would sit well and age nicely, but the sheer complexity and masterly crafted balance allow we snobs to bust one open right away. This is an expertly crafted imperial stout from one of the best breweries in the world. A yearly favorite of mine and IMO you can't find many better stouts than this. A top 5 for me any day. Absolutely flawless.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,96
147,1160,Nutwood,2.5,"Had this on tap in a shaker pint after work.  The appearance is striking and maybe a bit strange. Pours a drk, seemingly purplish black. The head came to one finger and was dense, with a bit of an odd buised purplish dark brown hue.  Aroma was agressively boozey, to the point of overpowering the faint roasted malt and a bit of vinous fruit note. I did not get much in the way of chocolate or coffee. There was a hint of hops present.  Flavor here was a bit off for me, more like a burnt barleywine with some molasses and caramel. I found the alcohol to be pushy and distracting, and I was put off by a presence of what seemed to be some fusel heat in there.  The mouthfeel was again all alcohol, along with some decent body and moderately low carbonation.  Overall I would not cite this as a good example of Russian Imperial Stout style. I get the impression that Stone was trying to push the envelope and sacrificed flavor for alcohol content. It's missing the roasty malt goodness and full flavor, balance, and body that smooths out the alcohol. If you want to try this beer, do it early in your session and consider making it a one beer session.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,96

Licorice flavor comes out with warming. Some comforting alcohol warmth on the way down. Sticky mouthfeel with the right carbonation.

T: first sip I get a load of anise and chocolate. as it warms the coffee and chocolate dominate. get alot more of the abv when warm as well  M: Very creamy, decadent mouthfeel on this one, good carbonation, about as perfect as it gets for a RIS  O: I would have to give this one a A. I have had this aged 4 years and thought it lost alot of its prominate flavors which kinda bumbed me out. I would like to try this aged a year or 2 to see what happens.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,96
147,1160,MarioM,4.68,"22 oz 2012 Release poured into Stone RIS Snifter served at 55 deg f.  A: Dark black, completely opaque to light, nice brown head, good carbonation with a nice creamy head composed of small small bubbles on top floating over larger to medium sized bubbles beneath. Very nice lacing is left behind as the head dissipates slowly.  S: Dark sugars, molasses, figs, licorice and a bit of coffee but mostly just fruity and not as much roastiness as I would expect.  T: Sweet, fruity, dark fruits like figs, dark sugars at the beginning. A tad bit of licorice with some good bitterness in the middle and finishes with a good alcohol taste which reminds you its a RIS and not your everyday stout. Flavors are surprisingly mellow and not as roasty as I would expect or compared to others of this style. Still an amazing brew, but this mellow character does not take away anything from its awesomeness but simply makes it quite drinkable and pleasant.  M: Bitterness lingers along with the boozyness and roastiness, which is where most of it come forth. Damn, the mouth feel and overall aftertaste is amazing. The complexity of this beer comes out of the closet best after sipping and letting it do its thing. Coffee notes and great roastness and sweetness is balanced beautifully and makes for a great beer to enjoy on a late night.  O: This RIS is unique compared to others but still a great beer. Surprisingly easy to drink and gains in complexity as it warms and lingers on the palate. Flavors aren't too overwhelming but enough that its a satisfying flavor bomb, again, especially in the aftertaste. Damn, just took another sip and this brew never gets old and keeps getting better with temperature. Definitely a must have from Stone.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,96
147,1160,Jamesthebrit,3.6,"A: Decently thick. Something of a brown head that quickly dissipates and leaves a nice lacing.  S: Big alcohol with this one. Vanilla. Smoky roasty. Nice but not mind blowing.  T: Theres a sourness hidden in there that is a little off... Otherwise oaky, alcoholy, vanilla, smoky. To be honest the alcohol very much overpowers and leaves a dry sourness in the finish.  M: Sits with a medium body. Alcohol really cuts through and theres a lingering sour bitterness that is rather out of place.  Overall this is IMO a pretty poor showing from Stone. The thin body really allows a bitterenss to cut through that lingers and is super gross. Great vanilla and smoke notes but not as great as I've known stone to be.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,96

S: roasty grain and light coffee aroma, dark chocolate, mild hints I'd dark fruit and alcohol.  T: much like the nose, I get notes of coffe, toasted grain, dark chocolate, along with a light hint of smoke, darkfruit and licorice, everything is very well balanced and very delicious.... Oh yah there is a touch if bitter hops in there as well to help balance out the touch of sweetness this brew has.  M: heavy bodied with a velvety creamyness, just enough carbonation to keep this brew from being too syrupy, while low enough it is still pleanty viscous.  O: this is a great IRS, one of my favorites, look forward to it every year.... A must try for serious stout fans....

147,1160,gshak,4.75,"Having a 2011 bottle, now in Oct 2014. I think this beer is pretty darn near perfection for what an IRS could be. A - Pitch black with mocha-colored head that fades into a thin ring. S - Coffee, roast, dark bitter chocolate, dark fruits, raisins/prunes, anise. This beer does indeed get better with age! Taste - More of the same, with a hint of toffee and very slight alcohol. There is a good amount of roast as the liquid goes gently down the throat.There is a drying aftertaste, with roasty bitterness. M - Full. Not overly viscous, or gooey or sticky, but just enough to let you know it's no lightweight.  O - Fresh, this beer was a 4.25, but at 3.5 years of age, this goes 4.75. Of the 16 I picked up in 2011, only 2 remain. And given how this beer matures, I think those bottles will see a couple more years in the cellar. One of the very best impressions of an IRS.

S: Dark milk chocolate. Faint hops? Sweet and dry, smells like oak aging.  T/M: Like the smell -- sweet and dark. A round and malty imperial stout with fewer hops than anticipated. Noticeably strong. Significant carbonation precludes stickiness.  O: A solid imperial stout, but not overwhelming.

A: When the waitress brought my tulip-ware with a finger's worth of thick head, I could already see the thick lacing and creaminess. The trail left on the glass was gooey and inviting.  S: Malt and roasted toffee dominate here; however, there's also a nice hint of alcohol wafting beneath the surface. What an incredibly nice beginning.  T: Roasted pine, malts, and some of the darkest cocoa imaginable forward the awesome assault on your taste buds before it finishes with a thick aftertaste of oven-roasted grain and spent malt. Just lovely.  M: With a viscous mouthfeel you expect from any competent stout, the play on the tongue here was creamy and excellent.  O: Overall, I found this quite similar to another favorite stout of mine, Old Rasputin. Still, this was a great try and one I'll certainly seek out again.

147,1160,tectactoe,4.09,"Pours a dark and dense black, essentially no color coming through this beer at all, with a thick, creamy, deep-tan head that has great staying power. Nice lacing left on the glass, especially for a RIS. The nose hits with some bittersweet chocolate and dense, dark fruit sweetness (think raisins and prunes). The initial taste is very sweet to the tongue, following heavy with that raisin-prune flavor, along with bits of anise. Roasted malts are plentiful as well as the bittersweet chocolate flavor that sits heavy on the back of the tongue. Halfway through the sip, the oats, grains, woody, and burnt oak flavors come alive followed by a final bite of bitterness that resonates in the mouth upon swallowing. Coffee is heavy and noticeable as the main aftertaste in this one. Very nice. Very heavy and creamy with medium-low carbonation.  Good RIS here. In the beginning, a bit too sweet for my tastes, however, as it warms up, it becomes more balanced with the deep oats, grains, oak, and coffee flavors. This beer definitely gets better as the glass gets warmer and the sweetness starts to mellow out a bit.  EDIT: 4/5/2013  2007 vintage, thanks Chris. Either this beer transforms amazingly with age, or my palate has been refined over the last half year, but this was much better than I remember it from the first time (and I still thought it was pretty good). Less of the nearly-cloying anise and licorice (much less, actually) and quite a bit more cocoa powder and even a hefty dose of coffee beans in the aftertaste. Decent roast from the malts and still a solid alcohol warmth after all these years. Mouth feel wasn't as amazing as I remembered it, though. No oxidation - wow.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,96

147,1160,Morey,4.23,"2012 bottle into a snifter.  Appearance: Pours pitch black with over 2 fingers of medium-brown head. I'm getting absolutely no light through this bad boy. The foam reduced to a thin layer after about 5 minutes or so, but there's plenty of lacing on the glass (especially for a beer that weighs in at 10.5%).  Aroma: Probably the tamest feature of this beer. Chocolate & molasses are most notable, but there are subtle hints of dark fruits as well as a faint roasted smell. Surprisingly clean nose overall though!  Taste: Hello! The taste comes at you with the force of a haymaker. I'm getting a really nice creamy sweetness up front, followed by a nice roasted bitterness which is accompanied by a thick creamy texture on the palate. You can taste the hops ever-so-slightly towards the middle. The finish is creamy, sweet, and bitter all at the same time.  Mouthfeel: Full creamy bodied Imperial Stout with a low carbonation level. Spot-on.  Morey's Bottom Line: This is actually my 1st time having this beer, and it more than lives up to the things that I've heard about it. One of the BEST non-barrel aged stouts that I've ever had. Top notch! I need to grab a bottle to age. Also, I forgot to mention that at $7.99 a bomber, this beer is incredibly fair priced as well.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,96

This beer pours a very very dark brown color with a nice amount of creamy tan head that leaves big lacing chunks on the glass.  Smell wise its got a really nice dark fruit/licorice smell going on, definitely has a boozy twist to it though.  Flavor wise the dark fruits are more subdued and you get a boozy roasted malt base with a tiny bit of licorice, something syrupy plus whatever hops stone uses that seem to always stand out to me.  It has a decent viscosity but it just doesn't have one of those finishes that is characteristic of a stone brew that I'm just not a fan of.

Good retention, gobs of foam stuck to the glass. Quite nice.  Smells of chocolate and herbs. The chocolate is light and delicate, and complemented well by the herbal essence. Not really hoppy, more like mild fresh herbs. Interesting.  Taste is solid and robust, and dominated by chocolate malts. Rich, kinda like milk chocolate, but without the depth that some big stouts have. It's filling at the high end, but doesn't have those deep roasty flavors I want from it.  Mouthfeel falls a bit flat. Smooth and chewy, but too low on the carbonation.  A good imperial stout, definitely worth drinking, but not the best. Taste is a bit shallow, lacking some of the richer, darker notes of big stouts.

Sweet chocolate starts things off, and carries well into the finish. Bitter chocolate and roasted graininess follow as the sweetness morphs into more of a juicy dark fruit character in the mid-palate (cherry, date, prune) Some black coffee bitterness in the finish brings balance. Unbelieveably smooth and well balanced. ABV is ridiculously hidden for almost 11%.  M - Smooth and silky. Very full bodied, but the silky feel makes it easy to take sips bordering on gulps. Perfect.

147,1160,EnemyWithin,4.18,"2012 Stone Russian Imperial Stout  Bottled in 2012 . Poured into tulip glass on June 22, 2012.  Appearance 4.5 Pours like an opaque black with a half inch light brown head.  Aroma 4 Nice roasted notes, with milk and dark chocolate. Hint of espresso. Smells sweet on the nose. Fainter biscuits in the malt and a very light waxing and waning citrus presence to the hops. A very typical, but enjoyable aroma. I particularly like the roasty chocolate nose.  Taste 4 Initially get semi-sweet and dark chocolate notes, with a little more subdues roastiness, in comparison to the aroma. An initial touch of moderate bitterness that comes across the palate quickly, which gives the beer a drier sense that anticipated from the aroma. Also, an overall slight sweetness from the malt. Midway through the more astringent bitterness of the hops peaks and then fades into background as the roasted flavors return to the forefront. Ends with a mild dry bitterness and a semi-sweet lasting finish, again with notes of chocolate and coffee. Initerimently I pick up faint soy sauce notes too.  Mouthfeel 4.5 Smooth and creamy with a moderate thickness. In contrast, the beer offers a clean astringency. Overall enjoyable full body, but with elements that leave the palate refreshed. A more enjoyable mouthfeel than I’ve had in a while, at least in this sitting.  Overall 4.5 A good solid offering and that is in fact an understatement. It has all the characteristics of a stout – nice roastiness, good depth of flavours, and an enjoyable thicker body. As per typical from Stone and west coast brewing, the beer offers a moderate amount of bitterness, and it’s easy to know where it comes from. I find this works well in contrast to the sweeter elements. Overall, the beer is a very easily drinkable package. Furthermore, these bombers are reasonably priced with good accessibility. All this combined make it a regular go-to stout. May not be as bold or rare as others, but it doesn’t let you down.

147,1160,Eddxii,4.42,"Stone’s Imperial Russian Stout pours thick and oily, or as the bottle claims, “like Siberian crude.” Once the carbonation fights its way through the dense brew it forms a hefty brown head, which sits upon a beer so black that suggesting it might have brownish hints would be shameful.  The aroma is strong in all senses. Immediately I get some anise, the darkly roasted malt, the port-esque alcohol sweetness. The first taste is a bear-like punch in the palate. It’s extremely full-bodied, coating the whole mouth with the darkest cocoa. Roastiness pervades everywhere. The lingering flavors are heavy, solid, and only darkly sweet. After the robust experience of a single sip, you feel accomplished. But your deed carries with it the impish sense that you’ve done something delightfully wrong.  Imperial Russian Stout is not for the weak of spirit. It is a beer for cold, not cool weather. It is a sipping beer, both because of its complexity and because if you were to chug this you would cross the great divide. It certainly puts hair in a hopeless place.  Stone’s imperial ale has long been a favorite among the American beer aficionados, and it’s easy to see why. This is a great representation of the style and a worthy opponent for your darkest of nights.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,96

The flavor matches the nose and really has a nice big bitterness to help keep the beer drinkable. There an alcohol presence but it isn't too much and the beer is about as drinkable as it needs to be.

No noticeable head with the exception of a trace on the side of the glass.  S: Almost smells like tawny port wine.  T: This is a strong beer and you can feel it from the first sip. Very chocolaty flavour, a bit bitter but not too much.  M: Leaves a strong aftertaste in the mouth. Feels full however and pleasant.  O: Compares very favorably to the Samuel Smith Imperial Stout as well as the Old Rasputin that is my current favority.

147,1160,ChrisPratz,3.94,"A: Pours a pitch black espresso color with a finger and a half worth of milk chocolate head that dissipates quickly to a blotchy head of lace.   S: Dark roasted malt tones with coffee and burnt sugar coming thru with dark coffee aromas mixed with a very light dark chocolate scent.   T: Roasted malt and toffee come thru on the palette first making way to the dark chocolaty flavored to follow. Ever so slight hint of caramel on the aftertaste works very well and theres a hint of alcohol. Lacks the smokey or chat flavoring some RIS have but I don't miss it. Nothing masks or overpowers the flavors here. Done very well.   M: mild carbonation leaves a lightly creamy feeling on the tongue. Slight dry feeling towards the end but it's very light especially for the higher ABV.   O: Very good RIS, not nearly as bold as some I've had. Lots of flavor and everything balances quick nicely.

Roasty & boozy nose, plus caramel and toffee. Taste follows suit: skillful mix of roasted malts and dark coffee meets aged booze. Deserves a 4.25; rounding down here and up on the Overall score.  Alcoholic character is strong and prominent, which is surprising for an imperial stout that's ""only"" 10.5%. Granted, it's integrated reasonably well but still hinders drinkability.  Been at least a year since my last Stone IRS, and this was better than I remembered. Maybe it's the time on this bottle, maybe I just don't give Stone enough credit these days.

Boozy raisons and figs with a hefty amount of roasted malts finish.  Mouthfeel: Still a little boozy but just barely. So much smooth. Consistency of motor oil and is slick through the sip.

Just a hint of burnt rubber off a freshly used pencil eraser... takes me back to high school. Now I'm thinking about high school. Now I need a drink... let's continue.  T- At first bold, balanced and bready. There is a taste of charred bbq, chocolate nibs, just a bit of honey, and dark rye bread. This palate retreats overtime to a subtle but poignant bitterness in the center/back of the tongue.  M- Very smooth and full-bodied. Has a creamy velvety texture.  I have a theory that the most satisfying characteristic a beer can have is being temporally dynamic in its feel and flavor. That is, the tastes change drastically from the moment you sip the beer through to a prolonged aftertaste. This stout achieves that quite well, at least for flavor, less for mouthfeel. I think a bit more carbonation would make it more visually attractive, and would help pronounce its feel and presence.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,96

It dissipates slowly and leaves thick lacing on the glass. The nose is a lot of hops, the sort characteristic of a Stone beer. It is dominated by a pine forest smell with some citrus grapefruit notes. There is roasted coffee and bittersweet chocolate in the backbone. The taste is again pretty hop forward, more of the pine resin and even more of the citrusy grapefruit oil. It masks the alcohol well, but there is definitely that warming sensation that lets you know it's there. The malt comes forward as caramelized sugar and very roasty. Overall, I think dialing back the hops just a hair might improve this beer. nevertheless, it is a very excellent beer, and I plan to begin working on a verticle to see how it ages.  Update: Had a 2011 and a 2012 in the past month of this gem and it absolutely becomes a gorgeous beer, even after one year of age. The hops settle out to this orange and grape-like smoothness that just tastes fantastic. It also starts to pick up some flavors like a nice Port.

The finish is long with a mix of lightly bitter leafy, woody hops, peppery alcohol, dry caramel, and chocolate malt.  M- Thick, chewy body with moderate carbonation and a dry finish.  O- Really a well-balanced beer. The malt has a full chocolatey flavor with notes of caramel without being sweet. The woodsy hops add multiple layers of complexity without being too bitter.

Thin, light brown head on top that dissipated quickly, and only a thin lining rimmed the glass within a minute.  S: Roastiness. Black licorice. A touch of something that reminds me of seared, charred meat. A whiff of coffee as well.  T: The black licorice is definitely there. Big and bold, arriving early. And I'm standing behind my assertion that something here tastes like that delicious ""crust"" you find on the edge of a good seared steak. A little oak barrel as well. I'm not sure if this is barrel-aged or not, but I'm tasting a little charred wood.  Piney hop bitterness on the back end, and maybe a touch of grapefruit as well. No alcohol ""burn"" the way some Imperial Russian Stouts do, but it's certainly not ""hidden"" either.  M: Thick. Hefty. The carbonation level is low but appropriate for this style. The finish is dry, with big roasty charred notes and a touch of pine bitterness left behind at the finish.  D/O: I enjoyed my first 14-ounce-pour of this beer. It's big, bold, and flavorful. But, ultimately, I'm just not sure that ""Russian Imperial Stout"" is a style I really enjoy.

Runs some molasses and dark overcooked sugars. Great depth of flavor with enough complexity to carry it through.  Mouthfeel: Just crosses in to full body. Carbonation is minimal. Smooth with a slightly dry edge.  Overall: This is the baseline by which all other Imprrial Stouts are judged. It's got great flavor and ease of access makes it even better.

S: Roast, milk chocolate, some dark chocolate, light nuttiness, and even lighter toffee. Mild and fairly straightforward, but pleasant.  T: Dark chocolate, burnt malts, and black licorice. Solid, but I want a bit more. More roast, more sweetness, more complexity. As the beer sits, it gets better and better though. I get a toffee sweetness and nuttiness that comes through.  M: On the thick side with very creamy carbonation. Near perfect.  O: A bit straightforward, but as the beer opens up I enjoy it more and more.

S: Roasty chocolate malts. Overall more of a sweet aroma than I expected.  T: Follows the nose, especially the chocolate. There is a bit of spiciness, and maybe some burnt molasses.  M: Nice and velvety, although maybe a smidge thinner than I want. Alcohol is definitely present but doesn't overwhelm.  O: Overall good, solid and reasonably priced big beer.

147,1160,boilermakerbrew,4.88,"From the 2012 release.  A- Poured a beautiful inky black into my brand new snifter. Dense, chocolate colored head with awesome retention and lacing.  S- Almost all coffee and chocolate on the nose. More chocolate tones than I was suspecting. Heavy grain tones come through a little bit, that's the barley flexing its muscle. Slightly sweet smelling.  T- Incredibly well balanced for such a young RIS. Coffee malts hit first, then meld smoothly into chocolate flavors. Just like the scent, the barley base provides a sturdy backbone of flavor, and provides the base for the slightest hop bite. Leaves you begging for more with a slight sweet, yet also surprisingly bitter coffee finish.  M- There are simply not words for how smooth this beer is. No alcohol detectable on the palate, and drinks more smoothly than an oatmeal stout. It's a 95 degree day, and this hits the spot like a DIPA or a pils.  O- This is a terrific brew. Incredibly smooth and satisfying. Drinks so easily, that I feel like cracking open my aging bottle. I will definitely get another bottle if I can.

This is very flavorful and I am savoring every last drop. It is smooth and mouth coating and I'm getting a touch of alcohol heat. I am really enjoying this as it goes down. This stout looks fantastic, tastes fantastic and feels so smooth going down. I've heard and read how good it is and it's taken me this long to find out for myself.

Sweet malt, molasses, dark fruits, moving into slight smoke, slight alcohol, with roasted flavors.

Some burnt malts balanced with choclatey sweetness. Has a backbone of dark fruits with a hint of tree bark. Fantastic.  T - Very malty up front with a combination of sweet bread, chocolate, and toasted malt. There is some rich blackcurrant and plum as well, giving this a bit of a fruit character. Coffee on the back end with a slightly smokey booze finish.  M - Creamy feel with light carbonation. Leaves my tastebuds coated and tingling. Suits the depth of flavors in this beer nicely.  O - I have been keeping an eye out for this since late April and it just came in to my local Total Wine today. Not sure what the holdup was, but I'm happy to have it now. The nose was very impressive, probably one of the best smelling RIS (or IRS?) I have tried. The flavor is delicious and complex with notes of coffee, chocolate, fruit, oak, and toastiness. The high alcohol doesn't really show itself (although I find myself saying that more and more so it may just be my palate becoming accustomed to these double digit ABV'ers). Overall a great stout and at $5.99 a bomber, a great value. I will put one away to see how it ages.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,96

Dark roast coffee, dark chocolate, molasses, a bit of dark fruits, with a touch of earthy hops in there as well  T- Delicious. A dark chocolate (think 80% cacao) hits up front with a nice coffee as well. There is a hint of the dark fruits I smelled, and just a touch of the earthy hop base as well. Just a tad sweet, and the bitterness from the chocolate and coffee notes balance perfectly.  M- Coats the mouth, viscous, and full on the palette. A hint of carbonation is spot on.

147,1160,blackcompg,4.32,"Poured from their 22oz bomber...  Appearance - Pours about a finger of medium cocoa brown head, color is a deep brown black, transparent mahogany edges, but light does not pass throu the center of the glass. Leaves nice foamy rings of lacing on the glass.  Smell - Wow, rich roast, molasses, soy sauce, dark chocolate, plum peel, and some fresh brewed french roast coffee in the background.  Taste - OMG, this is so complex and nicely balanced - this is a symphony of: roasted dark fruits, dark chocolate, rich full bodied coffee, plum and cherry skins, rum/fruitcake crusts, there is a touch of alcohol that tastes like amaretto - complimentary, not hot at all. There is just enough sweetness to balance, but is a natural dark fruit sweetness - and just the slightest soy sauce saltiness - the perfect combination of sweet, savory, char and salt.  Mouthfeel - Medium for sure, just mouthcoating, very silky and smooth, but not sticky or syrupy at all. Carb is on the lower side and is soft and foamy - accentuates the smoothness and allows the flavors to build, doesn't scrub the palate at all. Finishes with just a slight combo of tart, dry and char. Sets the stage for the next sip...  Overall - What a wonderful and flavorful stout. It's almost hard to believe this is 10.5%, alcohol is very well hidden. Warming comes from deep within, not in the mouth or the throat. Allowing this one to warm up will accentuate the sweetness of the dark fruits and the tartness of their skins, along with the amaretto-like flavors in this RIS. I feel that the roasty characteristics are actually more present at cooler temps - I would recommend enjoying this one at about 45 degrees. They diminish beyond 50.

This is an AWESOME brew. Roasted malts, dark chocolate, espresso and some dark pepper in the background. Stone hit the mark.  M - full bodied and coats the mouth in an insanely thick RIS. The only downside? A bit boozy tasting for me. 10.5% but it is as prevelent as beers that are upwards of 15%. A small gripe for a great brew  O - Gotta buy this stuff if you see it on shelves.

The brew has a slight crimsoned brown edge but is otherwise void of light. Some thin whisps of lace down the glass.  S: Smell is redolent with sweet chocolaty roasted malts. Some earthy hops. Overall a very clean profile with a nice roasted barley note that suggests some dry coffee character.  T: Tastes opens with a rich chocolate decadence. Roasty with notes of coffee, burnt molasses, and licorice. Big bitterness of earth and spice. More chocolate. A significant roast barley influence. Bit of present and warming alcohol. Slightly sweet, bold, and complex. Really fantastic stuff for the price.  M: Moderately heavy body yet with a nice bit of balance between thin and syrupy. Makes for a much more approachable Impy stout. Rather smooth and creamy consistency with a good amount of drying crisp in the finish.  D: Big and bold with chocolate, roast, and hops at the forefront. Balanced with harmonious flavors and texture. Again, a great purchase for the price. You can’t really go wrong with this one.

As discribed it does pour like and looks ""like Siberian crude"" Perfect pour with a 1 finger head that is foamy like a memory foam mattress.

It tastes sweet at first but here comes the bitter finish, and you can taste all the complex roasted malts, coffie and dark fruits in between.  The mouthfeal can be discgrbed as thick chocolate milk and it is a smooth drink, you want to drink it slow to enjoy all the flavors involved.

About 1/2"" of light brown/tan head that goes away very quickly and doesn't leave any lacing to speak of.  Smells of roastiness, some dark chocolate, black licorice, vanilla, tobacco, brown sugar, molasses and maybe a bit of dark fruit. Some alcohol is also present in the smell, not surprising for a beer at 10.5%ABV.  Somewhat sweet on the front of the tongue, but that gives way to a burnt, roasted bitterness. Dark chocolate. Burnt toast. Coffee. The alcohol makes it self known as well. Just enough sweetness to balance out the bitterness.  Mouthfeel somewhat thinner than I anticipated, but not thin by any means. Has a warming quality from the alcohol presence.  Overall a fine Imperial Russian Stout. Stone is pretty consistent in making great beers, this is no exception.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,96
147,1160,jondeelee,4.08,"Imperial Russian Stout opens with a lovely cream-and-malt aroma that bears, on the one hand, notes of heavy cream, brown sugar, vanilla, and caramel, and on the other, a far darker set of aromas including ash, tobacco, and chocolate and black malt. A good set of fruit esters, including fig, date, and plum, bring out more variety, as does a good undertone of milk chocolate. The nose does bear a strong touch of alcohol, but this blends nicely with the aromas, and in fact gives the beer a slight oak/carbon scent (though it has not been barrel aged). As a whole, the nose is quite nice, the aromas exactly what are to be expected of a beer of this style, being a good mélange of cream and ash. I can’t say there’s anything necessarily revelatory about the aromas, but they are still very enticing.  On the tongue, the beer opens up with a huge smack of ash, tobacco, and espresso that is far darker and stronger than the nose let on. These dark notes are quickly joined by dark sugars--molasses, brown sugar, and fig, date, and plum fruit esters--as well as touches of heavy cream, vanilla, and anise. But the ashy notes nicely dominate the brew, giving it a solid earthy feel. There is a strong alcohol presence (10.5% ABV) throughout the mouthful, adding a vodka-like tinge to the edges, as well as touches of carbon, marking one of the beer’s few weaknesses. The aftertaste is mainly ash and tobacco, with remnants of cream and sugar, and lasts for a decent time. Mouthfeel is medium to medium-heavy, and carbonation is medium.  Overall, this is good fare, though I did find myself somehow wanting a bit more. Not from the ashy notes, but perhaps a few more sugars, or an additional layer of flavor to help bring out what is already there. This beer seems, in other words, to cry out for a bit of barrel aging, as a bourbon undertone would nicely complement the alcoholic, ashy tones. Still, even without this, it’s still a very nice stout, and worth trying.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,96
147,1160,Jugs_McGhee,3.35,"Served on-draught into a stem-goblet at Beachwood BBQ in Seal Beach, California. Reviewed from notes. Expectations were above average; Stone is direly overrated but I heard good things about this brew in particular, and I like the style.  Paired with sweet potato fries.  A: Pours a half finger head of khaki colour, nice cream, okay thickness, and bad retention. Colour of the body is a nontransparent solid opaque black. I prefer the head colour of beers in this style to be more of a tan - the darker the better - but khaki does alright. I'm not anticipating a great beer, though. Due to the nontransparency, no yeast particles are visible (if they're there).  Sm: Vanilla, cream, chocolate, caramel, and hints of roast. A mild strength aroma. Roast should be more present given the style. I'm alerted.  T: Generic chocolate and tame cream over a dark malt (chocolate malt inclusive) foundation with underlying caramel. Some vanilla hints that don't amount to much. No real layering here. Not at all complex for the style. Stone played this beer surprisingly safe. Why is it they pick this style to do that on? They seem to force unwelcome flavours into most otherwise simple styles. Decently balanced but built without boldness, experimentation, or inspiration. As Imperial Stouts come, this is pretty generic.  Mf: Silky smooth and wet. Completely wrong for the style; a stout demands dryness and coarseness (from roast) overcome masterfully by cream. That isn't the case here. Too thin. Adequate carbonation.  Dr: Drinkable but unremarkable. Russian Imperial stouts like this one are a dime a dozen nowadays. There are far better beers in the style, even at the same or lesser price. It's decent, and I might pick it up in bottled form at a good price, but don't expect masterful brewing. I wouldn't recommend it to friends. In fairness, it'd be a pretty good beginner's Russian Imperial Stout. My main problem with it surrounds its lack of inspiration or specialization; as a generic example of the style it'd be a good introduction for people new to the style.  A decent candidate for aging, but I wouldn't do it meself.  Would pair okay with chocolate. Not real suitable to barbecue.  B-",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,96

A great tasting beer, ranked in my favorite stouts. Try it...RIS category, just a very solid beer from a NW brewery A-",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,96
147,1160,Darkmagus82,4.54,"Poured from bottle into snifter  Appearance – Pours a pitch black color with a two finger brown head. The head has great persistence and eventually fades to give some decent lacing.  Smell – A heavy sweet chocolate aroma and malty brown bread mixed with good hints of vanilla, coffee and caramel are mixed within. There is a very light boozy aroma that rounds out the sweeter and maltier aromas well, creating an overall great smell experience.  Taste – The taste begins with a huge sweeter cocoa/ semi-sweet chocolate flavor with a nice strong dark breadiness. The sweetness given to the cocoa is of vanilla and the light caramel that was in the nose. As the taste moves on, the dark breadiness remains as a base for the beer along with the cocoa flavor. While the cocoa is ever present, its sweetness profile changes throughout. It begins sweet and then bitters more in the middle as some roasty flavors enter the taste. As the cocoa bitters in the middle, it is joined with a coffee flavor accentuating/enhancing the bitterness. This bitter however is soon again lessened as sweetness comes back to the tongue. At the very end, the alcohol that was detected in the nose comes to fruition and takes the taste to the end. While the taste in the mouth finishes leaves sweeter, the aftertaste turns more bitter. Overall it’s fantastic.  Mouthfeel –Thick, chewy and creamy. The body is absolutely awesome. The carbonation level however is a bit too high and pulls away from the wonderful creaminess and prevents the tastes from soaking into the tongue. While the carbonation isn’t superb, overall the amazing body makes for a great mouthfeel.  Overall – A very tasty and slow drinking stout. It has a wonderful flavor profile, aroma, appearance and a fantastic body. Very enjoyable.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,96
147,1160,sevenarts,4.52,"A: Pitch-black with a small skim of brown head.  S: Smells great: rich chocolate, a little coffee, sweet malts, dark fruits, and some boozy alcohol.  T/M: Amazing sweet, rich malty goodness. Lots of chocolate and roasted malts, sweet fruit, a little bitter bite at the end, and just a touch of boozy followthrough, but surprisingly subtle considering the ABV. Really smooth and creamy too.  O: An absolutely fantastic RIS, deceptively easy-drinking.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,96
147,1160,Hopstamon,4.53,"A - Jet black with a fair sized bronze/tan head; beautiful.  S - Rich chocolate, subtle coffee and tied together by roasted malts.  T - Lots of dark roasted malts up front with a chocolate inspired sweetness throughout. At this high ABV, the boozyness is subtle--but detectable. Beyond all of these tastes, I get some dark fruits in the background, which add a bit more and make this stout truly fantastic.  M - Bold, big body while remaining creamy and smooth.  O- I enjoy this version each year that it comes out. I drink some immediately, and cellar a few bottles for 1-2 yrs... wonderful when fresh & exceptional when aged.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,96

S - Roasted malt with coffee and dark chocolate aromas along with other scents of dark fruits and vanilla. Definitely a strong earthy and floral hop presence. Smells pretty good with none of the aromas really taking center stage. All of the different scents are definitely layered, and you have to take your time to pick all of them out.  T - Starts of sweet with raisin, vanilla, and chocolate flavors, building to a roasted malt and coffee bitterness, and finally finishing with a floral hop bitterness. The taste of alcohol is slightly apparent. Very tasty and well-balanced.  F - Medium-to-full bodied, nice carbonation, velvety smooth and sticky mouthfeel, and a nice bitter and dry finish. Bitterness lingers for a nice amount of time but fruity sweetness lingers longer. Smooth throat-warming sensation from the alcohol.  O - This was a very nice RIS. A larger hop presence than I was expecting (although I should’ve known better with Stone), but it was balanced well with the other flavors and really added to the overall taste and mouthfeel. I usually like my stouts with more roasted coffee and chocolate flavors but I enjoyed this beer very much.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,96

The head sticks around for awhile and forms some nice lacing along the sides of the glass.  S- Lots of hints of coffee, chocolate, dark fruits. The alcohol is also slightly noticeable in the smell.  T- This RIS actually has quite the hop bite. Up front I get coffee notes more than anything. It finishes off rather hoppy. An interesting take on the RIS.  M- Heavy, thick, a definite sipper. The alcohol is there but not overly hot.  Stone is one of my favorite craft brewery's and they certainly don't disappoint. Awesome stuff and priced very reasonably.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,96

147,1160,TheCondor,3.91,"Poured from a bottle into a pint glass  Appearance – Poured a dark black color, next to no transparency to this beer. It is uber-dark for sure. Nice big tan head, about two fingers, which sticks around for about a fourth of the brew before dissipation. Superb lacing where the head had been.  Smell – Dark chocolates, mocha, malts, and a bit of charred or burnt residue in the nose of this brew lends to its complexity.  Taste – Following the nose closely, it is a smooth and creamy front and middle with a nice chocolate, cocoa, malty flavors at the back end of the sip. As the brew warms it gets more boozy, and the alcohol becomes more of a factor in the taste, but the aforementioned flavors are also enhanced.  Mouthfeel – Smooth and creamy, with a nice bitter edge to finish things out, especially as the beer warmed. Average carbonation, not too heavy but thick enough to know it’s a stout at least.  Overall – This is a pretty good brew, one I would likely drink again and certainly if it was free. I have not bought into Stone Brewing like some I have seen, but they produce good beers no doubt. I just prefer a different style than theirs, that’s all. If you are a RIS fan, this is a must-try, for it is a solid example of the style.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,96

Bomber, 2012 Edition  A- Pours a dark black opaque black, average to slightly above average carbonation for a RIS, can see tiny fast rising carbonation bubbles rising to the top of the glass, thin layer of light mocha brown head.  S- Dark chocolate, mocha, milk chocolate, a little bit of licorice, malts, can smell a little bit of the alcohol, fairly sweet but not overly aromatic.  T- A nice light sweet creamy dark chocolate, a little bit of licorice, mocha, malty background with a slight bitterness, sweet creamy slightly bitter aftertaste.  M- Creamy, medium bodied to a little bit on the heavier side, a tiny bit lighter then I was expecting, well balanced, average carbonation, goes down smoothly. ABV very well hidden, very slight burn to let you know it's there but nothing overly noticeable. Exactly how I like a RIS- not too syrupy and not too much alcoholic burn, goes down very easy  O- This was a great Russian Imperial Stout from Stone. Most of the Stone beers I've had have been great, but nothing remarkable. This beer definitely fits that mold. This is one of the better RIS I've had, but definitely not the best one. I liked the nice creamy chocolate taste that hid the abv very well. It could have been a little bit sweeter to cancel out some of the bitterness, but overall it was a quality beer. For $8.95 per bomber you can't go wrong. I definitely recommend picking up a few.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,96

T - Thick and delicious malt, coffee, dark chocolate flavors. It was a little bit cold coming out of the fridge at first, but as the temperature of the beer started to warm up, a lot of subtle qualities started popping out.  M - Thick, creamy goodness. It seems to coat my tongue and the inside of my mouth with every sip.  O - This is an amazing beer. Hype fully justified.

147,1160,Chaney,4.05,"2012 Vintage serve in a Cigar City snifter. Sorry.... no Stone one available.  A: Poured black as night, with about a 1/2 finger bronze colored head that looked like metal shavings.  S: Lots of char that was very porter-like indeed. Also, I got sort of a breakfast cereal quality that reminded me of ""Cocoa Puffs."" Also, a tinge of Teriyaki sauce.  T: Deep, dark, strong, soy sauce-like flavor, with about of ton of molasses to boot. Strong cocoa notes and a bit of dark fruit on the finish. However, this sucker needs to seriously settle down for awhile.  M: Thick and snot-like, with a ridiculous amount of lacing and bitterness. Rough and boozy, but my experience with this beer is that that will work itself out in a couple years or so.  O: It's been a long time since I tried this one and all the memories came flooding back after my first sip.

147,1160,sleuthdog,4,"2012 Release poured into tulip glass  A: This Stone offering pours like a typical Russian imperial stout. Black, rather thick and not much carbonation to speak of. It produced a real nice one and a half size chocolate milk colored head that dissipates quickly and leaves some nice lacing behind.  S: First off roasted chocolate with some smoke or charred scents followed by Roasted malts and some caramel sweetness and coffee. I also do pick up on the alcohol on this one.  T: I don't know what I was expecting but wow is this one complex in the taste. I get tons of chocolate, coffee, caramel and a toasted/roasted malt. This is a sweet, decadent chocolate covered espresso bean tasting stout. On the tail end the hop bite takes hold to balance out the sweetness just right. Well balanced between sweet and the bitterness from the hops.  M: I thought after pouring this bad boy it was going to be on the thin side but I'd say it is instead moderate. Not chewy but this does coat my mouth with a slickness that is rather enjoyable. The taste sticks around for a long, long time and is still evident as I reach for the next sip. Not much carbonation but rather just enough as the balance creates a wonderful silky mouthfeel.  O: I heard mostly good things about this offering but also some mediocre thoughts as well. I agree with the good things on this one. It was a pleasant surprise and I am really enjoying this. I love bourbon barell aged stouts but this too has its place. So glad I was able to pick up a few of these as I am eager to see how this matures. Good thing I have other beers in my cellar to grab because I would be tempted to drink all of these before the maturation process even started!

Not guaranteed, but in this case Stone comes through with flying colors. Pitch black with a thin tan head. Big aroma lets you know there is a serious stout sitting in the glass. Surprisingly drinkable, with lots of complexity. Flavors range from chocolate to vanilla, molasses to coffee to ginger spice. Flavors keep changing as you make your way through the bottle and as the stout warms.

Big chewy and viscous! Sweet cocoa, vanilla bean and caramel up front. Extremely clean and well blended flavors. Coffee and earthy bitterness creates impeccable balance.

Typical coffee and chocolate mixed with roasted malts. Smells a little boozy, but there seems to be something unexplainably fruity in this.  Taste is...amazing. One sip and I'm smiling at how I feel that I'm robbing Stone Brewing company. How can they sell this beer at $6.99 per 22oz? This beer is sweeter than most I've tried, and it's out of this world. The creamy molasses and coffee flavors hit and linger. Caramel and malt come though as this warms, and finishes with a slight boozy character. I've read about how well this ages and I can only imagine that the flavor deepens as the alcohol taste disappears. I'm putting one in my cellar.  Stone IRS might have the most amazing mouthfeel of any beer I've tried. It is lusciously creamy with flavors that coat the tongue and don't leave until you are ready for you next sip.

S - Got a good whiff before the cap was completely off. Lots of chocolate coming through. Toasted malts with some caramel hanging around.  T/M - Again, chocolate really comes through in the taste. Layers of it as well. I get a hint of milk chocolate before it turns a more bitter dark chocolate. Really nice roastiness with a little bit of burnt toffee. Creamy, full-bodied, with low carbonation.  O - Awesome!

147,1160,TheSixthRing,3.69,"Appearance - Pours a midnight black with light penetrating only the thinnest of edges. Head is a cocoa powder color and 2 fingers thick, good retention, and leaves behind a spotty lacing.  Smell - Aromas are fairly light. Chocolate and roasted malt notes. Even at warmer temps, not getting much from the aroma.  Taste - Darkly roasted malts. Sweet. Chocolate notes. Flavors feel held back; subdued.  Mouthfeel - Full body. Almost syrupy. Decent carbonation. Smooth.  Overall - Stone is known to brew some aggressive brews, so I'm a little befuddled by this RIS. While all the typical characteristics are there, they seem fairly muted and, dare I say, safe. It's a good RIS, but I can't say it's in my top 10.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,96

It's such a great RIS, yet it isn't impossible to find. In fact, it's easy to find, and it's reasonably priced.

147,1160,BoatsSinkBro,4.27,"Pitch black with light chocolate milk colored head.  Smell is akin to coffee with heavy cream but with notes of alcohol and hops throughout. You can probably guess this will be on the sweeter/creamier side.  Taste is almost chocolate milk, but it's offset by roasted coffee bitterness and alcohol. Dry dark chocolate + coffee finish.  The carbonation lifts the heaviness of this beer, otherwise, it'd feel like you're drinking syrup. It also works well to usher in the coffee bitterness.  This beer is pretty damn full bodied. I'd even wager it being on the consistency of a lighter, fizzy chocolate milk. Damn good stout, very filling.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,96

Head is thick and sticky, leaving all kinds of nice lacing and very good retention.  S: Big nose of roasted barley, chocolate, sweet milky coffee, soapy yeast. Very slight solvent alcohol behind.  T: Big quaff of sweet, alcohol-laced chocolate with a bit of roastiness. Alcohol brings in some subtle dark fruits (raisins, prune). A bit of a metallic note and hop bitterness in the finish.

147,1160,mschind,4.48,"22oz bottle from the 2012 batch  A- Gave it a vigorous pour into a chalice yielding a huge rocky looking mocha colored head that dissipated quickly and coated the glass nicely with good lacing. It’s dark brown bordering on black, almost opaque. Lots of carbonation strings are visible along the sides of the glass.  S- Nose is mild spice, roasted malt and alcohol sweetness. I’m looking for the chocolate and coffee but I’m just not getting it.  T- The nose let me down but the taste is huge. Sweet licorice up front with mild roasted bitterness in the middle, some dark chocolate and a slightly dry finish. Nice complexity across the entire palate. The alcohol warmth comes through later.  M- This is full bodied brew, maybe even a bit syrupy which is a good thing here. Silky smooth with subtle carbonation.  O- This is my new favorite stout and a fantastic value at $5.99. Don’t serve this too cold. I had to let the second pour warm up a bit to get the best head and flavor profile. Definitely one to savor and pair with food.

147,1160,flayedandskinned,4.41,"Bottled on 3/15/2013 Poured in a Duvel tulip glass  Appearance: Pours an impenetrable obsidian with a menacing 3 finger tall light cocoa head that sticks around for quite some time and leaves a nice, thick coat of sticky lacing on the glass. Gorgeous Imperial stout.  Aroma: Roasted malts just leap out of the glass with underlaying notes of dark chocolate, vanilla and coffee. There is a mild alcohol presence that blends well with the light herbal hops.  Taste: A subtle herbal hoppiness greats your palate right away before you're pummeled by heavy notes of roasted malt, creamy baker's chocolate, vanilla and a mocha esque coffee presence. Finishes dry, smooth, and a tad warming with a slightly spicy hop bitterness. The alcohol is extremely well hidden. The finish leaves lingering notes of even more chocolate, coffee and a distinct nuttiness.  Mouthfeel: Very silky and very full bodied with low to moderate carbonation.  Overall: Wow, this stout is incredible. I haven't had this beer for about 2-3 years and this beer is absolutely great for a non barrel aged Russian Imperial Stout. Extremely smooth, and rich with layered depth that is almost perfectly balanced. Stone needs to start releasing this year round. It is amazing.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,96

It appears jet black and oily with tight tan bubbles that hold the glass tightly. The taste is a bold rich coffee roastiness and chocolate sweetness. It's definitely a potent stout with an extra chewy mouthfeel.

147,1160,mscudder,4.5,"I reviewed the bottle a few days back and now I am back with a growler fill from HopCity in Atlanta.  A - Same as from a bottle: jet black with a nice thick tan head. Quality lacing.  S - Again very similar to the bottled version. Perhaps a tad less dense aroma. chocolates, coffee and roasted malts.  T - Absolutely fantastic. Deep flavors which begin with roasted malts, and follow with a creamy smooth chocolate infused sweetness. ABV is just as well masked as in a bottle. Beautiful RIS.  M - I have to say I find the beer superior in this catagory relative to its bottled counterpart. The carbonation is optimal and is truly everything I want in a big stout. Silky smooth, creamy and irresistible.  O - Overall this is the same top tier stout I have grown to love in a bottle. A bit better overall on draft, but nothing too substantial.

147,1160,StonedTrippin,4.33,"this one is a keeper for sure, especially at less than 8 bucks a bomber. pours a gorgeous and enticing coffee black color, heavy and rich, with a 1 inch light brown head that has the consistency of cool whip, thick and light. it just floats on top of the beer without ever getting smaller. smells quite spicy for the style, espresso beans radiate as well. there are also notes of milk chocolate, vanilla beans, and charred english malts. flavor is similarly complex, with the roasty coffee and chocolate flavors being most prominent. there is that spice character again, maybe peppercorns or anise or clove... great alcoholic sweetness in the finish. the feel is quite thick, almost motor oil thick. mellow carbonation lets the complexities linger, and the aftertaste is awesome. this is a bigtime beer, a good one to share with a lover. well worth its excellent reviews.

Wet finish with lingering chocolate covered espresso beans and tannic leather.  Mouthfeel is superb. Slick and full bodied with just enough carbonation to balance it out.

M: Relatively higher carbonation, Medium to thick body,  For some reason, I thought this beer was a lot better than what I just had.

To be reminded of what less-than-perfect tastes like? Also, what is the perfect RIS? It's subjective, right? This was as close to perfection as they come in a RIS.

147,1160,SgunnarW,4.58,"Poured from a 22oz bomber into a Deschutes snifter  A: Pours a thick, deep black with a 2 finger mocha colored head. Nice retention that dissipates slowly, leaving a good amount of carbonation bubbles around the side of the glass. Alcohol legs are definitely present.  Sm: Huge amounts of roasted malt on the front. Coffee, and chocolate dominate, followed by fruity esters. A hint of caramel and vanilla. Alcohol is subtly present.  T: Almost spot on to the smell. Roasted malts are the key player here. It's so much like sipping on a freshly brewed cup of dark coffee that you could crack this thing open in the morning to have with breakfast. The finish is smooooth, and the bitterness is well balanced by the sweetness of the malts. The 10.5% ABV is well hidden and only briefly noticeable as it warms on the way down.  Mf: Full bodied all the way. Deliciously thick and creamy with just the right amount of carbonation to keep you interested.  O: Another gorgeous beer from Stone and an RIS at its best. I'm excited to try this with a little age on it.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,96
147,1160,DM1293,5,"This is an ironic beer to me. I'll explain why in a bit.  Appearance - The darkest stout I've ever seen. A moderate head, endures a fair bit of time.  Smell - All the notes I would expect from a stout as well; really good coffee, chocolate and roasted malt. Not too powerful, but not faint.  Taste - All those notes I mentioned? Imagine them well balanced. This beer is incredible. You could almost call it an oatmeal stout for how smooth it is. It does everything I like about stouts (good coffee, toasty malt, chocolate notes to round it out) and keeps it just at that. No bitterness, not overtly sweet. And that just freaks me out. I was expecting some real good robust roasty-toasty bite to this, but this is Stone at its smoothest ride.  Mouthfeel - Its also creamy. REALLY creamy. It lingers on the finish as well, pleasantly so. And the carbonation is spot-on.  Overall - Now let me explain something. This beer does everything right. I've given another perfect score. But that doesn't mean this would be my go-to stout still. That...bothers me. Its an excellent beer no doubt, I've bought two bottles, one to age out and see how it changes. But at the same time, I can't think of times when I'd really crack this one out to drink casually. Another thing thats holding it back in my mind is that it might be a touch too rich. I know stouts tend to be, but this is pretty heavy.  Its kind of hard to explain. Not to mention this seems to be brewed only during certain times and is a little on the hard side to get at times (the man who was from Stone that I talked to mentioned this being distributed during a couple months every year).  But these are minor gripes. Get it while you can if you love a good stout. As for me? This thing is like fine wine at cheap wine's price (Six bucks? Oh you better believe its worth it). A perfect brew that I'll enjoy sampling again come the end of this year, and once more before then as I crack the other bottle open among friends.  EDIT: Do not try this beer very warm! Make sure its either chilled or semi-cooled (less than room temp). I feel it becomes a lot stronger in the bitterness and the chocolate notes are overpowered by the coffee roastiness. It becomes an entirely different beast depending on the temperature. I prefer it cold and my scores are based on that.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,96
147,1160,Dope,4.65,"A: Pours jet black with a large and dense medium brown head. Fades very, very slowly, leaving thick sheets of lacing on the glass.  S: Wow, stunning roasted malt character. Char with some wonderful cocoa and bitter coffee. Has a creamy sort of character to it, almost like a touch of lactose. Hints of dark fruit that I cannot yet identify, cherries or currants maybe? Touch of anise.  T: Very creamy roasted malt up front. Very nice bitter chocolate follows along with some dark fruit. Currants, cherries with maybe just a hint of fig? Roasty bitter coffee kicks in afterwards and finishes off the flavor with a touch of earthy hops. As it fully warms I get hints of anise here and there.  M: Incredibly smooth, creamy and thick. Amazing.  O: This is one of the best non-barrel aged RISes of all time in my opinion. You almost have to give it extra credit for being so widely available and easily attained. Not to mention quite cheap! The mouthfeel is honestly the best part. It's a great combination of heft, creaminess and smoothness without being too cloying or too syrupy. Otherwise, surprisingly fruity RIS, making it more balanced than most which are usually just hardcore roasted malt and nothing else.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,96
147,1160,yamar68,4,"Pours an expected black/mahogany with a brief finger of brown froth. Good lacing and consistent beading.  The nose features dark, sweet malts. Some espresso, caramel, plenty of intrigue without the booze.  Tastes super smokey, borderline rauchbier in a good way. Lots of toasted grains beneath the smoke, caramel and toffee. No discernible booze.  The feel is spot on. No lingering harshness, but a bit of smoke that keeps things interesting. Well done.  Overall, I can see why this beer is a standard in the cellar.

Also, as usual with Stone's beers, the message etched on the bottle is entertaining to read.  S: HUGE roasted aromas of chocolate, espresso, slight fruitiness, light hops and alcohol.  T: Like heaven. Molasses, chocolate and espresso dominate the foretaste, with licorice (from the hops?) and burnt raisin flavors following with more roasted flavor. A bit of alcohol adds to the complexity in the long, bittersweet finish. Dry. Charcoal in the finish. Wow.  M: Full body does not do it justice, and the carbonation is low. Heavy on the pallet.

I was browsing Bevmo and noticed that this beautiful brew was out again. I've come across this stout before, but haven't had the chance to officially review. I'm pretty confident this new release won't disappoint.  B: [10.5% ABV. 1 Pt. 6 Fl. OZ. 2012 Release] Bottle contains a good amount of info (as Stone bottles normally do). ABV, ingredients, back story, and even a recommendation. Label is nice and simple, and worthy of my mantle.  A: A dark black body/no transparency whatsoever with a fluffy mocha head (moderate dissipation), and decent lacing.  S: Very aroma heavy. Chocolate, toffee, roasted malt, and a boozy alcohol presence.  T: Chocolate, sweet roasted malt, coffee, toffee, caramel, and a bourbon presence throughout. There's no long lasting aftertaste, and bitterness is mild for this hop head.  M: Thick silky smooth finish, Full bodied, moderate/low carbonation, and very apparent alcohol presence (maybe overbearing for some).  O: Very pleasing... bold, but a smooth stout for men. I suggest drinking at room temperature, letting it sit in your mouth for a little, and swallowing slow. Hopefully I can grab another bottle for aging, but even this fresh release taste great. The texture in the mouth is some damn pleasing, it dares you to take just one sip. If it's one gripe I can find with this brew, it would be the head and the lacing, but that isn't a big deal. This is one of the best Imperial Russian Stouts you can find out there. I highly recommend and would suggest to experienced beer drinkers.

147,1160,bambam2517,4.67,"Appearance and pour - Bought a newly released 2012 vintage in the 22oz bomber. Chilled down to 40f and poured into an Imperial pint glass. Comes out slick and black with little carbonation, just a nice bubble ring that quickly dissipates.  Nose - Powerful sweet alcohol is the primary scent I pick up, almost like a red wine or currant. Getting past that I pick up toasted grain and a hint of coffee. Picked up more complexity as it warmed, adding chocolate and a rich fruit tang.  Taste - Really well done, complex and carefully balanced. Initially I really pick up the bittersweet currant, and the coffee doesnt pick up until well after the first swallow. The next taste folds in some chocolate, and its all on a nice base of toasty maltiness that doesnt interfere in the other flavors.  Mouthfeel - Very warming, picking up just enough of the alcohol. Finishes dry and lets the flavors linger after it goes down.  Overall - One of the most interesting brews I've had in a long time, I'm going to go back and get a case of them to see how it ages.

147,1160,badbilly30,4.2,"Enjoyed many vintages many times. This particular bottle is an ’09 that went straight from the brewery to my fridge. Vigorous pour produces a huge, burnt coffee/brown head. Aroma is roasted (almost oat-like) malt, chocolate, and coffee. As the beer warms, I smell some dark fruity notes. Smells great. Taste is huge thick chocolate malt, coffee, some dark trailing dried fruit, and the slightest whisper of alcohol.

147,1160,deadonhisfeet,4.36,"2011 vintage. I have been sitting on 4 bottles of this for 9-10 months and finally decided to crack one open. Poured from a 22oz bomber into a Brooklyn tulip. Pours nearly black with a nice, tight 2-finger tan head. Nose is subdued with earthy, roasty notes, chocolate, and molasses.  Bittersweet roasted malt flavor up front along with some char notes characteristic of the style. Everything is very smooth and well-tempered (not sure if it's like that fresh or if the cellar time has smoothed it out). Right on the finish, I get a hit of rummy, figgy flavor and a slight warming alcohol taste (nice!). Mouthfeel is firm and tends toward slightly creamy as the beer warms a bit past 50 degrees.  Overall, this is an excellent beer. It's not my all-time favorite RIS, but it is definitely world class. I try to buy this every year.  2 years later...  5/9/13 update - The char notes have toned down, as has the booziness.

147,1160,neckbracesub,3.98,"Poured from a bottle into a pint glass.  You can hardly ever go wrong with a Russian Imperial Stout, in my opinion, and Stone does a good job with their take on the classic brew.  A superbly dark pour and lively licorice aroma give an outline for what's expected from this beer, and the potency of its following taste confirm that it continues the reliable quality of the Stone name. The double-digit alcohol volume % is certainly apparent in the boozy finish, but it is the offsetting mouthfeel that keeps this RSI from entering the ranks of some of the finest.  Still, overall this is a solid beer and at an extremely good price for a bomber.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,96
147,1160,Drinkerofales,4.25,"Pours black with brown and red on the edges and the pour. A large deep mocha head forms and leaves some nice lacing.  Smell is bitter chocolate, coffee, roasted malt and booze. About what it should be, with plenty of strength.  Taste is of a classic RIS. Chocolate, coffee, dark roasted malt, very close to the aroma. Only difference is a hop tang.  Texture is nice and thick. Only the ample carbonation makes this feel thinner.  While this is pretty spot on for a RIS, it's not outstanding. And though I find it far better than the anise version, I have had better RIS's recently. The thing that makes this so good is the relatively cheep price. For that, I almost gave it a 5 overall.

147,1160,Crispy34,3.6,"I bought a ""2011 classic release"" bomber bottle out of the cooler at da local Spec's. I poured it into a Victory pint glass.  A: Of course the bottle is Stone's awesome gargoyle theme. The beer looks very dark, of course, but when held up to the light, you can see light through the edges. The head is a lighter brown more than a tan. Very appealing appearance wise.  S: The aroma is very complex. Roasty as well as bready. A very nice smelling stout.  T: The taste is complex like the smell, but for me it is too much. It seems too much is going on. A very roasted flavor comes out, but it almost seems like my tongue can't keep up with all the flavor. Not much booze for the ten point five. A lingering after taste is kind of a put off as it is dry, but lasts way to long.  M: The feel is fine until you get to the after taste. It is so dry it is almost sour.  O: This is a obviously a very complex stout, but almost too complex. I can think of a couple Stouts I would go for before this one. It is not bad, but just not a real stand out as far as imperial stouts go. That being said, I do think you should give a try for yourself. I bet this beer ages interestingly, though, with how complex the aroma/flavors are.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,96
147,1160,Jerone,3.57,"A- Very dark brown, can see a tiny bit through the edges, chocolate colored one finger head that fades quickly, can't get much head out of this one, no lacing.  S - Dark roasted malts, some chocolate and liqorice and quite a bit of tobacco that I don't enjoy but that many may love.  T - Lots of very dark roasted malt, chocolate/coffee and liqorice, all very nice flavor... but then I get some of that tobacco again and just don't enjoy it.  M - Great mouthfeel, full bodied and completely coats the mouth low to medium carbonation.  O - I will try this beer again but for me I just don't like the tobacco flavor, it doesn't ruin it for me but doesn't allow me to enjoy it as much.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,96
147,1160,RBassSFHOPit2ME,4.57,"2007 Vintage on tap last night at City Beer SF  I'll note, I'm not at all a fan of this beer fresh, however 5 years has turned this beer into something truly beautiful.  The nose is straight port wine and dark fruits with a tiny hint of vanilla. Although there is no bourbon component to this beer, you'd swear in the nose that there is a mild bourbon barrel hint going on in there as well. The smell was absolutely sublime. I've never come across a better nose on a standard RIS.  The taste was much of the same minus the bourbon. Just shy of what the nose gave off. Not too heavy and not at all light. The mouthfeel was nice, however I prefer my stouts creamier, similair to The Abyss after a year of age or Velvetier, similair to a Parabola. That's just getting knit-picky though.  I feel very fortunate to have randomly stumbled across this vintage. Get it if you can!",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,96

The head receded very quickly, with little lacing.  S - The smell is not overly strong. Lots of roasty aromas, malty, coffee, and maybe a little chocolate.  T - Strong roasty flavors at the start of the sip, the coffee flavors are very prevalent and results in a very nice dry bitterness. As the sip finishes, the taste is on the spicy side, both from the hops and from the alcohol content. Speaking of the 10.5% abv, while it is noticeable, it is not too much, as there really is not any heat from it. There is also a very good aftertaste that lingers in the back of the mouth for quite some time. I really love this taste of this stout.  M - The mouthfeel of this brew is awesome. Not too thick, definately not thin. Just the right amount of carbonation.  O - This is a great RIS. I really wish this was available year round. I also wish I picked up a few bottles to age (that is, if I could keep my hands off of it).",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,96

147,1160,shangwang,4.59,"2011 vintage - poured into a Guinness glass  I've been saving this for a blustery cold night, and it finally has arrived. Poured viscous and black, like crude oil. A finger of mocha head quickly reduced to a thin layer with almost no lacing on the glass. Smelled of sweet roasted malt like breakfast cereal, with some coffee bean and chocolate notes - unbelievably appealing. This may about as perfect a smell as I can imagine for this style. Decadent and rich are two words that came to mind with the first taste of this brew. There was a strong roasted character throughout the taste with a slight lingering sweetness of dark fruit. Definitely a booziness about it as well, and lots of baker's chocolate bitterness. It was a very complex taste - lots of delicious flavors. Mouthfeel was heavy - a little bit of carbonation and lots of creaminess. The mouthfeel very nicely complimented the flavor.  Overall, this was a fantastic beer. I'm a big fan of this style, and this is as good a take on it as anything I've tried before. Draining a bomber on my own was far too easy, and I'll be looking for this one annually. I'm curious to compare it to the Belgo version, but that's for another review!",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,96
147,1160,DevilsCups,4.37,"2011 Vintage, with about 8 months on it, poured from the bottle into my DFH Chalice.  A - Almost pitch black in pour with a head just dark enough. Think light-and-sweet coffee. Lacing is great, and the head lasts for a bit.  S - Very unique. It has that standard RIS aroma with a scarcity of roasted malt. Very unique malt profile. Caramel and toffee is very pronounced.  T - This is where this brew shines. Very caramel/toffee forward. With around 8 months on the bottle I'm surprised at how much hop bitterness and flavor it retained. The caramel notes are what set this apart from other Russian Imperials. It's up front and it follows through all the way into the aftertaste. Awesome.  M - At 8 months, this brew is on the way to being perfect as far as mouthfeel goes. It has enough carbonation, maybe even a tad too much. A bit thin in body, and could probably use a thicker mouthfeel and creamier carbonation. Time will do this beer well.  O - Absolutely a must buy every year. This is one of the standards of the RIS style. If you happen to see any vintage bottle at the store, buy it. You won't be disappointed. I have one sitting for a bit longer, maybe I'll go 12-18 months and revisit. It can only get better.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,96
147,1160,legalpete19340,4.38,"A: Poured near black with a big chocolate milkshake colored head. Head fell quickly but laced like a monster.  S: Bits of smoke and leather bounce out of a strong chocolate cake nose. Subtle grain in the background. There is a bright sweetness too, seems like cherries or maybe raspberries.  T: Starts off rich and chocolatey with a bit of coffee then blends seamlessly into chocolate covered cherries. The sweetness grows until its just about too much then a very earthy and grassy hop note wipes out the sweetness. The finish is a long awaited roasted malt note that smacks of burnt toast. The alcohol is hidden until you sit for a minute and the warmth creeps up.  M: Thick and creamy like chocolate milk.  O: Great RIS. The only thing holding it back for me is the lack of dark roasted malt flavor. Felt it was a bit sweet. Truly a great beer and a must have. If I see it I will drink it. Had the opportunity to try a 2010 and 2011. The 2010 lost some of the sweetness, and picked up a salty, soy sauce character. This beer cannot go wrong. Too drinkable.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,96

S - Very aromatic. Roasted coffee, molasses, charcoal, roasted barley, a little fruity. The alcohol is present but the head isn't a deterrent and seems to blend nicely among the other characteristics.  T/M - Full bodied with an almost syrup viscosity. The beer starts sweet with the malty and fruit character found in the nose (currants?). The malty backbone of the beer provides a nice foundation from which the mild bitterness builds. A lot of coffee and chocolate flavors. Very good. The alcohol again is noticeable but not overpowering or overly hot. The beer finishes surprisingly smooth.  O - Excellent beer.

The beer is to the side of my laptop, each sitting on my laptop desk and I can offer a review of what it smells like from here. Thick roasted grains, like cocoa, dark coffee and even a hint of licorice.  Enjoyable burnt flavors are highly prominent - one of the bigger stouts out there. There's a significant depth to that roastiness, but other than some woodiness, jam and dark fruits, I'm not getting much else for layers of flavor. Floralish hops hide way in the background. But what's here is exceptional.  Low carbonation, with just a mild burn and dryness to close.  Good beer - just wish I could pick up a broader array of flavors here.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,96
147,1160,SSJeep,4.38,Wow. First thought about this beer from the second I poured this.  A - Very dark brown almost black. slight bit of red. Head was half a thumb. It was a mocha in color. Very little to no lacing and disappears very quickly.  S - Chocolaty and mocha seems very sweet. A bit of alcohol too.  T - A bit of roastly. Chocolate and sweet. A little fruity undertones.  M - Very smooth and a bit chewy. Nice carbonation.  D - Dangerously drinkable. Very sold beer all the way around.

Smells: a sweet roasted malt and slight caramel like note with a pleasant hop character.  Tastes: as the nose insisted. there is a vanilla oak sweetness with a well balanced roasted malt and floral hop background.  Mouthfeel: for an Imperial at ten and a half% this is a super smooth and well balanced brew. The aftertaste leaves a roasted malt with the earthy wood flavor that is sweeter in the taste, but beautiful bitter hops in the aftertaste. mildly carbonated.  Overall: this was a tasty brew that is at a great price when you can find it around.

Was intending to keep this a little longer but became one of those 'special occasions because I opened the beer' moments you hear about in movies like Sideways.  Typical stout appearance. One quarter inch darkisg magnolia head which thins over the course of the drink but never fully disappears. Opaque glossy black. Dark earthy tar-ish nose but sort of subtle about it.  Very very very long on the palate, so intense and so long (yeah, I mentioned that) but just not overly heavy but intense, dense, eartry and complex too.. Love the 100% like black chocolate quality too. There's a tannic vinous quality about it as well. The booze slowly creeps up on you.  Truly great. A true Imperial Russian Stout but not stupidly huge and roidish either. Just right.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,96
147,1160,jvillefan,4.33,A: A dark almost black brown with a two and a half finger head that dissipates relatively quickly.  S: If you let the beer sit in the glass for a decent amount time the smell is chocolatey. But the smell is surprisingly muted for a Stone beer.  T: Awesome. The best finish of any beer I've had. It has a very bitter (not from hops) start with a malty chocolatey finish.  M: A little heavy with light carbonation.  O: Great beer. Well worth the price.,Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,96
147,1160,TheBrewo,4.21,"We pour a beautiful and richly colored beer of deep blacks and browns. It holds a one and a half finger head of dark brown bubbles that is creamy and soft. This shows phenomenal retention, leaving sticky and thick lacing caked around the glass. No sediment is noted, and carbonation actively rises to the top in little streams of bubbles. The aroma showcases big and roasty malts, with all of the coffee, chocolate, and molasses one could hope for. There are hints of medicinal phenols, and a woody dryness. The roast is cut by pineapple and a syrupy sweetness. With warmth there is a hotness of chilies, and hop oils sit on the far back of the nose. As we sip, robust malts and a peppery booze hit first. Surprisingly, some pineapple sugars and light hops venture in to cut the bitterness. At the top of the swallow, a sharp profile of chocolate begins, holds, and retains to fortify the transition to and earthy and hoppy finish. At the end there are big grassy and earthy hop oils, mixing with a deeper char to the alts. There is dark spice and light booze, with cutting berry sweetness. All in all it is very smooth. The aftertaste breathes of that roasty malt profile, with a little more char and a little more booze. The body is full and the carbonation is medium. There is a slickness and oiliness to the mouth, but the liquid is sticky and partially drying. There is delicious froth, slurp, and smack to each sip, and the beer warms the drinker nicely. The abv is appropriate and the beer serves as a sipper.  Overall, what we liked best about the beer was the extensive flavor profile. This beer really reminds us of why we like Russian Imperials so much. The balance is amazing, especially with such strong flavors all around. Notably, the pineapple inclusions took us by surprise, but it made for a unique flare to a great representation of the style.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,96

Nice head retention for a beer this strong, really. Minimal lacing, but nice alcohol feet.  Smell. Dark fruit, specifically currant, dominates the smell. There is also a good dose of dark roasty malts and definitely creamy chocolate. Some alcohol is present as well.  Taste. Slightly bitter roasty malt to start. Quickly turns sweet, with a weird, but excellent, combination of chocolate dark grape and raisin. Some bitterness returns, but the raisin flavor persists also joined by some more roasted malts. The finish is dry and slightly bitter with lingering raisin.  Mouthfeel. Thick body, moderate to low carbonation.  What an amazing stout. Its even nicer that it is both cheap and available.

147,1160,BBP,4.3,"2009/2010/2011 vintage multi-review  Pours molasses black with adequate head. Light on lacing but good retention. Very similar appearance in each year with perhaps the 2009 looks best.  The aroma is a mixture of molasses and roastiness for the most part. Roastiness is heavier in fresher vintages while molasses comes out mostly in the 2009.  The taste is always great but I preferred the 2009 and the 2011. They were both great in different ways. The 2010 seemed to be in a transition and not as smooth. They all have a roasty, molasses focus. The 2009 had more of a coffee flavor and the 2010 had the most chocolate with the 2010 in the middle.  The body is thinner in the 2009 and 2010 vintages which is to be expected but the difference between the 2009 and 2011 was negligible. The finish is always slightly dry.  Overall, it's a solid stout at any age, but I think it improves with age. It's one of the best values out there for a RIS. I may grab a few and hopefully put away until they've hit their prime.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,96

A - looks like a good RIS should, inpenetrable black with a mocha head that sticks around S - sweet dark fruits and chocolate malt, a bit of booze. No hops at all. The aroma is a bit worrisome because it's so sweet. T - luckily a nice bitter roastiness balances the sweetness very well. Very complex flavor that is a bit hard to pick apart, some dark rummy fruits and burnt caramel meld into bitter roasty chocolate. That's the best I can do. M - oily, slick, and a heavy body.

147,1160,KajII,3.98,"[Best served in a Snifter]  The pour was a thick rich black with a large (2-3 finger) dense medium brown creamy head that lasted a good while, reducing slowly to just a little residue that was left clinging to the glass rather nicely.  The aroma was of a burnt chocolate malt and an earthy leathery yeast with notes of dark chocolate, molasses, roasted coffee, some dark fruit and a very mild alcohol presence.  The taste was malty and sweetly bitter with notes of chocolate and molasses early on, and then became a tad bitterer with a nice dose of coffee and dark fruit with a strong alcohol finish. The flavor lasted a really long time with the coffee, chocolate and dark fruit being present for a while before the alcohol presence became dominant.  Mouthfeel was thick, chewy and full in body with a dry, creamy texture and a nice soft carbonation.

A - Pitch black with 2 fingers of brown foam that slowly dissipates to a lace that leaves traces along the sides of the glass.  S - Coffee, smokiness and toasted notes along with alcohol.  T - Hot DAMN! This is strong! Heavy on the toasted malts, smokiness, dark fruits and coffee. There's a sweet taste I can't really recognize (bourbon, perhaps?), but then it's followed by dark chocolate and alcohol. This is really a complex brew! What I'm writing is not even close to what it really tastes like!  M - So syrupy and smooth is nearly syrup! It goes down smoothly, yet you can feel how it warms your tongue and throat as you drink it. You can barely feel the carbonation, but the alcohol is definitely there (along with so many other flavors).  Overall, it is the strongest stout (isn't that redundant?) I've ever tasted and my first IRS. The moment I took the first sip I regretted instantly I poured almost the entire bottle in the glass; it almost knock me on my back over how strong it is. This ""viscous beauty"" as it's written in the side of the bottle is a dangerous and sinful stout (although Stone claims no sin was committed in the production of this brew) is worth to seek and drink.

Aromas are rich, with blackstrap molasses, dark roasted coffee, and old world fruit sweetness. The beer has a full, round body, and delivers an initial blast of dark roast coffee initially. Forward flavors are immediately followed up by a strong molasses and chocolate palate, with a deep, dark sweetness overall, and a slight hopping at the end of the flavor profiles.

Lots of little bubble islands coat the surface of the beer and the lacing wants to crawl up the sides of the glass. No carbonation visible due to the deep black opaqueness. Quite a menacingly bold appearance.  Smell: Lots of big bold chocolate, coffee, and roasted malt. Some molasses, and maple in there as well. Good balance between the bitter roasty notes and the malty sweetness. Quite a treat for the nose to behold.  Taste: Very smooth blend of the bitter and sweet. Dark chocolate, molasses, coffee, some hops, and a nice bite from the alcohol at the end. Lots of things going on in this one; you could sit and ponder for some time on its complexity.  Mouthfeel: Fairly full-bodied, with a good blend of bitter notes and malt sweetness. Alcohol has a good punch at the end and kind of crawls back up your throat after drinking. Could have been a touch bigger on the front-end, but very delicious nonetheless.  Overall: A very tasty beer that I will seek out again.

Alcohol is present, but stays out of the way.  M - Full-bodied, rich, and velvety with a warm finish from the alcohol. Carbonation seems low, but there's enough to keep this huge beer from being too overbearing.  O - A classic RIS, and one of the best on the market.

Easily revived with a swirl of the glass. A live ale. Pitch black color with a tan colored head.  Very rich malty aroma emerges when this ale begins to warm, some hints of dark unsweetened chocolate and coffee, black bread, light hops. Complex, but could use a little more intensity.

Huge, full mouth feel. Complex. Perfectly balanced carbonation and crisp acidity. Delicious! World Class.  Extremely long finish of exceptionally rich, thick, viscous, roasted malt and some lingering bitterness. It clings to your mouth like glue! Wow!  Well it’s not totally perfect as the aroma could be a little more distinct, but everything else is huge. Extraordinary richness and power on the palate. One of the most viscous RIS I have ever drunk. The 10.5 % ABV is not even remotely noticeable. The flavor and finish are near perfection. What a pleasure to drink. This is why we put so much effort into acquiring and drinking fine craft brews. Thank you beer gods.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,96
147,1160,Vdubb86,3.98,"Served in a snifter  2011 version  This pours a sultry black body with a nice rich caramel foam. The nose brings molasses and a rich cocoa. There is still some booze hanging around in the background which I imagine creates some of the heat that appears in the taste. Other aspects of the taste include dark caramels, slight molasses, and rich dark cocoa powder. This has velvety smooth flow, but there is a harshness that if removed would make this amazing. Overall this is a very good beer but it needs more time. I must say I enjoy it.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,96
147,1160,zachary80,4.42,"Finally got around to formally reviewing this beer. Poured into a pint for lack of better glassware. 2011 Classic Release.  Pours totally black with a good tan head which fades over time. Not getting enough lacing on this one which is surprising  Smell is delicious. Sweet chocolate, a hint of cinnamon, balanced by roasty bitterness.  Flavor is great. Complex bitterness throughout, sweetness and roastiness both upfront. Espresso. Lots of complexity, each sip is a little different.  Mouthfeel isn't light but I expect a little more smoothness and fullness. I think the 10.5% abv is in a a sweetspot for the style.  Overall Stone IRS is one of my favorite beers year after year. If I could buy it in better packaging than a bomber I'd be drinking it quite frequently.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,96
147,1160,CaptDavyJones,4.7,"Poured from a vintage 2008 bottle into a DT tulip glass. Dark brown color as it pours, but absolutely pitch black once it is in the glass. Zero light penetration. One finger tan colored head that dissipates fairly quickly. Aroma is all chocolate and dark fruits. Feels like chocolate covered raisins, chocolate malt balls, faint notes of what comes across as ripe flesh of sugar apple fruit, and then some more raisins, some licorice. There is a lot going on in the aroma, it's an all out assault on the nares. Wow, one word to describe the effect of age on this stout is ""fantastic"". It is so damn smooth...WOW. Bitterness upfront on the tongue, before the smooth bittersweet maltiness coats the palate beautifully. There is definitely a hint of alcohol burn in the finish, but at no time does it feel like this stout stands at 10.8% alcohol. The alcohol on the tongue is masked really well. The aroma and flavors just get so much more complex as the beer warms up and breathes. Very good mouthfeel and drinkability. I can't think of anymore words that can do justice to this stout. The only think I can say is go and get one, especially if you see a vintage bottle. One of the best interpretations of a Russian Imperial Stout. A 'must-have' for every beer lover and every stout lover. Highly, highly recommended.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,96
147,1160,jethrodium,4.25,"650 ml bottle. 2011 release. Pours a dark black with a small tan chocolate head that has decent retention and leaves some light lacing on the glass. The aroma is roasty with dark, bitter chocolate. It has a bit of a floral hop presence as well. A bit of alcohol as well. The initial taste has some bitter chocolate, then comes a bit of coffee roastiness and a bit of hops. There is also some dark fruits, plum, and a hint of cherry. The finish has a decent bitterness to it and a hint of alcohol, but not nearly as much as in the nose. Medium bodied with a bit of creaminess. Low-medium carbonation. Great beer, especially when you consider the price.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,96
147,1160,tjkinate,4.33,"Took me forever, but finally I got around to this brew.  A: The hard pour into a snifter created a 2 fingered, cocoa brown frothy head that exhibited darn good retention and lacing. Body, to be expected, was dark as night.  S: Potent, dark chocolate malts backed with coffee notes and molasses.  T: Such a well balanced brew. The bitter, semi-sweet dark chocolate flavors are accompanied so well with vanilla, coffee and earthy notes. Of course Stone upped the hop profile, which made this RIS truly unique and exceptionally enjoyable.  M: Medium bodied for the variety, slightly dry, silky smooth coating the mouth completely.  O: Glad I finally was able to enjoy this wonderful, well distributed brew.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,96
147,1160,Mahgeetah527,4.05,"2009 Vintage poured into a Duvel tulip.  Pours an opaque black with one finger dark mocha head. Head disappears but leaves a slight ring. No lacing.  Smells of black strap molasses, rich coffee, dark chocolate and toffee. Strong roasted malts are also present.  Very rich flavor - tastes of strong coffee, licorice, and chocolate. Not too boozy considering the 10.5% abv and becomes smoother as it warms up.  The mouthfeel is thick & cream; full bodied with not much carbonation.  Overall this is a great example of the style. Big aromas and flavors without being too boozy. This beer is a winner.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,96

Smell: chocolate with anise. Coffee also enters the picture.  Taste: Wow! Rich. Expresso and chocolate rock the palate. Licorice slides in. Smooth finish. This is what IRS's are all about.  Mouthfeel: medium, almost chewy. Carbonation really lingers on the tongue.  Overall: A royal, omnipotent sipping stout. Even better as it warms. Would happily buy again.

147,1160,eslemarc,3.85,"2011 classic release, bomber poured into a snifter.  Pours black, looked like coffee as it swirled around the glass. There's a dark cappuccino colored head that stand 1-2mm tall, looks very thick and tightly packed. There's no light getting through this dark bastard. The head very quickly dissipated to a very splotchy coating on top of the beer, no apparent lacing.  This beer smells very toasty, almost pushing burnt. There's a little bit of booze on the nose, notes of anise and even a little hop character. (the smell makes me think 'burnt marshmallows and campfire', though it's not campfirey)  Very powerful carbonation dancing along the tongue and palate all the way through the finish. There's a lot of alcohol coming through the oddly placed malt sweetness. It's very drinkable considering it's 10.5abv, it just goes down rather smoothly.  As the bottle recommended, I have a few in store for a cold winter night a year or two from now. The beer is good now, but I'd imagine it'll even better later.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,96
147,1160,rel,4.2,"Was this brewed or extracted from beneath the ground in the middle east? Engine oil with a thick finger head that dissipates slowly and leaves a decent lace.  Was this brewed or... Smell is deep deep roasted malts with a nice dark chocolate fudge note, some mocha and more roasted malts.  A lot more coffee in the taste than expected, but the roasted malts are delicious. Ends with some chocolate, and a warming burn from the alcohol.  An amazing, shot down the middle, imperial stout.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,96
147,1160,mdvatab,4.2,"2008 Vintage Poured from 22oz bottle into Bordeaux glass  Aroma: Milk chocolate, blueberry, hazelnut, vanilla, graham cracker, hot cocoa, and an earthy note at the end. A wonderfully complex aroma.  Appearance: Dark espresso black body (some ruby is visible around the edges as I get to the bottom of the glass). Tan 1/2 finger head all but disappears. A minimal, thin layer of foam washes onto the side of the glass.  Flavor: Molasses first, then a mineral note, roasty chocolate, some dark cherry, a flash of booze, and a relatively quick bitter finish (thanks to the age).  Mouthfeel: Medium-full body with medium carbonation. Some nice warmth from the alcohol.  Overall: A great one for the price, compared to the other large-format imperial stouts currently available. I could see where this one might have been a bit short on complexity fresh, but that it likely has developed over time. Looking forward to trying the '09, '10, and '11!",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,96

S: Lots of chocolate, some coffee notes as well as a slight licorice note  T: So much chocolate and coffee, this is what I always look for in a RIS. Wonderfully flavorful with great mouthfeel and taste. I could drink two of these!  M: Smooth and dark with some medium carbonation to back it up. Not too much carbonation so as to ruin the beer but just enough to enhance it.  O: Will lovingly enjoy this beer now and in the future. Some stone releases I am iffy on but this is not one of them. A permanent favorite...",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,96
147,1160,bfirkin45,3.46,"Appearance: Very dark black. Tan, brown head lingers shortly and then dissipates. Wish it lingered longer.  Smell: Roasted malt, caramel, toffee, licorice, and chocolate aromas.  Taste: I get a smooth caramel taste with licorice and fruit undertone. Even and mellow complex flavors.  Mouthfeel: Alcohol comes out as it warms. Carbonation is light, and over smoothness of lingering and after taste.  Overall: Not one of my favorites. I have aged it over 6 months so far and the flavors have changed... just not for the better in my opinion. Heavy licorice flavor almost. More of an English RIS with low hop profiles. Good but not great.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,96

Smells of dark cherries, roasted espresso, some vanilla sweetness. The taste is all roasted malt and chocolate. There is some anise and hop bitterness on the finish. Alcohol has already dropped since I first had this about six months ago but it's still a little hot. It is totally thick and viscous with fairly light carbonation. Really smooth going down.

147,1160,danieelol,3.7,"Thanks to Adam @ Platinum  Pours dark black with a slightly tanned head  Smell is marshmallows- Belgian, yeasty. Berries and dark fruits. Cinnamon. Bit of alcohol. A hint of CCC hops at times. Of course there’s chocolate, coffee and aniseed over all this. Smell and taste are initially metallic but that disappears as it warms. Roast and sweet Belgian yeast. There is a definite porty and vinuous character.  Taste is quite sweet and bitter with lots of marshmallows. Honestly, this tastes like it has some quaddy influences. It’s definitely complex but I prefer the more brash American takes on imperial stouts, hopped up, even roastier and potentially BA-ed. Seems English-style. Just a bit _too_ much, but not in the ways I like.  Mouthfeel is moderate with tickly carbonation and a sweet/bitter dichotomy. Taste sensation is a lot like molasses.  Tastes like a massive version of an Export stout. Ageing it could work well- really want to tone down the sweetness, the roast bitterness and perhaps even the alcohol. There is a huge deal of complexity in this beer and I think it can be drawn out more with a few years in the cellar.

147,1160,Tucquan,4.04,"Had this on 2012-05-13 and again on 2016-04-19 in Columbia, PA from the 2012 batch. The numeric ratings reflect the latest 2016 review from of the 2012 batch. See below for a review of the 2011 batch.  A - Opaque deep, dark brown with a 1-finger tan head and moderate lacing.  S - Plenty of milk and dark chocolate. Some dark fruit. Maybe a hint of coffee. Nice but not overly complex or overpowering.  T - Roasted chocolate, caramel sweetness on top of an almost-charred grain, some coffee, touch of black currant (wish there was more currant flavor) and lingering roasted and hop bitterness. Alcohol noticeable on the out breath. Doesn't seem particularly balanced.  M - Medium-heavy body and light carbonation. Smooth, creamy and fairly thick.  O - Not my favorite RIS but I enjoyed this last tasting of the 2012 batch. When I had this batch a year ago, there was a metallic flavor that was too prominent. I still taste this but it is greatly diminished and I've raised my ratings accordingly. I've not had a fresh batch since 2011 so I'm curious to give the 2016 a whirl.  Had this initially on 2011-10-28 in Columbia, PA from the 2011 batch.  A - Black with a 1-finger tan head and mild lacing. 4.0  S - Strong roasted grain, dark roast coffee and black licorice. 3.5  T - Echoes the smell with even more coffee, molasses, chocolate, dried currants, light smoke and some hop bitterness. Since black licorice isn't a flavor I care for, I was pleased it wasn't as present in the taste as in the smell. The alcohol is apparent. 4.5  M - Medium-heavy body and light carbonation.

Noticeably sticky with patches of lacing stuck to the side. A creamy film sits on top with a ring of foam outlining the glass.  Ahh, the aroma here is a dead ringer for the style. Rich in chocolate, roasted malt, coffee, cherries and raisins. The nose is strong and long lasting to the finish. Quite pleasent.  Coffee hits the taste buds first followed by chocolate, mollasses, dark fruit, black licorice and alcohol. Again roasted malt is evident. Overall a nice bitter sweet flavor keeps things balanced.  The mouthfeel starts out smooth with a thick almost syrupy body. Carbonation is moderate to thin which works well. The presence of hops adds a semi dry finish.

I'm just about ready to make s'mores after drinking this one.  Overall it is a good brew and a decent Russian Imperial Stout. I wish it had a little more complexity. The start definitely differs from the finish (finish is more bitter roasty taste while start is more bitter chocolatey taste) but overall I only got hints of three of four different flavors while it would have benefited from more!

Like the reviewer below me, I also picked up a growler of this from Whole Foods - Bowery. Poured into a snifter.  A: Pours a deep near-black with a slowly dropping latte-coloured head.  S: Dark chocolate notes are strongest with a generous helping of roast and bitter-bones hops.  T: It melts in the mouth like a luxurious 80% cacoa chocolate bar. Hop balance is keen and slightly piney. Roast notes are more subdued than I remember and the finish is clean and crisp, like a Black DIPA.  D: Just nails drinkability. I remember drinking this long before my palate had adjusted for higher ABV brews. Even back then I marveled at how well it hid the alcohol. Mouthfeel is nice and heavy, but honestly, could be a bit thicker. It doesn't have that ""coat your mouth"" thickness of some stouts.  Overall: After all the RIS that I've tried, this is still a top-notch brew. It is one of the benchmarks for the ""American-Russian Imperial Stout"" category and combined with its availability, affordability and reliability, it is a true classic.

Alright but quite one-dimensional.  Taste: Again the smoke is the biggest presence, followed by some run-of-the-mill dark chocolate, a coffee bite and sugar. Liquorice, dirty chimney and hops at the end of the sip.  Mouthfeel: Medium body, medium-to-full flavor, carbonation on the low side. Creamy and rich, with a very dry finish that had me begging for water. It started out real good, but the growler soon lost carbonation and became rather flat (in only two hours!)  Overall: It scores a little better because it is quite drinkable, and the hefty ABV is not detectable. But this is not the best version of Stone IRS/RIS I remember. Too much smoke, not enough excitement... it didn't wow me.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,96
147,1160,zhanson88,4,"This vintage 2008 bottle was generously included as an extra in a trade with thewimperoo. Much appreciated! Really looking forward to trying one of these with some age on it.  Appearance: Pours out very dark brown and appears pitch black in the glass. About 3/4"" of dark mocha head forms, that has some retention and limited lacing. Just a ring around the edges of the glass remains after the head reduces.  Smell: Roasted malts in abundance here, with some coffee and bitter dark chocolate as well. After 3 years the hops have most certainly faded on this one. Some coconut comes out too. Pretty much your standard RIS smell....solid, but not spectacular.  Taste: Roasted malts, coconut, some coffee character as well as bitter chocolate. Again a very solid RIS with all the requisite flavors. Something that I could drink pretty regularly.  Mouthfeel/Overall: Full bodied with fairly low carbonation. Pretty slick; good in this category. I would call this a very solid imperial stout. I've had this once before (2010 version) that I remember enjoying more....seemed more balanced overall. Seems like fresher could be the way to go with this brew. But I definitely still enjoyed it and would have it again.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,96

S-- Big, thick baking chocolate, roasted malts, and coffee. Really took on a nose that seemed to me of oak. Really blended together well and had the nose of a beer than had been on wood.  T-- Dark chocolate, baking chocolate and coffee. Big in your face taste. Hops had dropped off and the malts had really taken over.  M-- Big, rich and dry. Very dry baking chocolate and coco powder finish. Had enough carbonation up front to smooth out the chocolate up front. No trace of alcohol at all in the mouth. Just chocolate. Big body and low carbonation  O-- Not as cake like big as say Marshall Z is but this was big in feel. Big chocolate bomb in this. Glad I cellared this for a year.

Figured I'd open up something good and see If I'm okay or not.  52 Degrees straight from fridge. Poured into my wife's Red Wine Glass.  Appearance-Black as shit. Head is a frothy tan head, about 1 finger. Dissipates quickly as expected leaving some minimal lacing.  Smell-Very roasty with some light booze. Some coffee and dark chocolate bitterness, as long as some smooth milky chocolate. A little bit subtle.  Taste-Upfront sweet malts and chocolate. Molasses, Syrup, and some Dark Fruits. Clean, smooth finish. Just a perfectly balanced beers on so many levels and the beer is 10.5%!  Mouthfeel-Medium to High body, smooth, creamy, vevelty. Carbonation is on the lower end, but it let the flavors shine.  Overall-So this beer isn't too hard to get when it comes out, it's a super RARE beer.

Retention is great and the lacing down the side of my Stone IRS glasses is very nice. 4  S: A ton of malts on both versions, but the 2010 has a stronger malt nutiness. The 2011 is full of chocolate instead. A very light hoppiness coming through on both. The 2011 has a bit more of a balanced smell. Although neither are mind boggling. 3.5  T: The taste of the 2011 is much more robust than the 2010, which seems to have thinned out a bit. Tons of chocolate, subtle maltiness, some roasty flavors and a dry finish. 4  MF: Full and heavy body. Like I said before the 2010 is a bit more thin. They are both carbonated very well. 4.5  O: I thought this was going to be better. The 2011 is clearly the better of the two, but neither are over the top delicious. They are both solid, and I would recommend them to anyone, but top notch? No. 4  2011 IRS and Belgo Anise IRS side by side on 9/29/12, roughly one year later.  A: Black pour, about as black as it gets with a really large dark brown head. Billowing up, the head sticks around forever and laces really nicely. 4.5  S: The roast of the aroma is wonderful and really surprising considering the age. Deep chocolate underneath with molasses and perhaps some licorice (or maybe dark fruits). Either way, it's impressive and I can't stop taking whiffs as I drink. 4.5  T: The taste is really mellowed, and at points I'd say it's a bit watery. Smooth, rich chocolate and molasses that's followed by some roasted malts and finished by a very slight amount of booze. Really not a lot at all, just enough to know it's there. Really well balanced, but not as impressive as I was hoping for. Solid overall, I'd recommend you age this and see what you think! 4  MF: Thick, velvety smooth on the palate. The booze is cut really well both by the mellow beer and roast. The dry finish keeps me coming back for more. Pretty drinkable for a 10% Russian Imperial Stout. 4  O: This was great, reminded me how good of a beer this is. This was clearly better than the Belgo Anise, which I just don't really like at all.

147,1160,StarshipPoopers,4.46,"2011 Release  A - Opaque black with a foamy mocha head. About a finger's worth of head with great retention. Great lacing, lines the glass in chunks. Appealing looking stout.  S - The nose on this release doesn't seem as pronounced as the older years that I had. Faint traces of coffee and roasted malts, with just a touch of chocolate sweetness.  T - Dark fruits (figs, blackcurrant) come through first, with a slightly muted sweetness. This quickly leads into roasted malts and bittersweet dark chocolate with a very faint touch of dark roasted coffee. There is also a backbone of hops that peek through in the finish when the sweetness subsides. Quite a bit of booziness, even when it's still slightly cool.  M - Medium carbonation. Not too heavy or light, just a nice balance in the middle. Drinks quite nicely.  O - I've had a few of the past releases and remember the anise being much more pronounced. This release seems to have toned it down a lot, since I didn't even taste it. Anyways, the differences between the releases are nice, and this is definitely a repeat purchase. I always pick up a bottle whenever I see it.  A+",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,96
147,1160,CheezyBlaster,4.5,"This is now my favorite stout and one of my all-time favorite beers!  Solid black/brown deeply opaque with an attractive and abundant choco-highlighted tan head.  Here we go: Smells like . . . coffee syrup, malt candy (whoppers), licorice/fennel root, and slightly of dried dark fruits (figs). Probably the most complex nose of the beers I've tried. Sooo much going on. Could spend a while sniffing.  Alcohol is clearly present, let's get that straight, but at 10.5% it's hard not to feel it. Malt comes through absolutely beautifully with some warm and molasses-sweetened shortbread. Excellent acidity and mild carbonation bite. Dark, semi-sweet chocolates come through especially as it warms. Tiny hops bitter the fringe, but could be forgotten with everything going on.  What can I say? Best feel ever. A creamy, smooth, consistent, full, and warm body overtakes your senses competing with the actual taste for your attention/affection.  One tiny drawback keeps it from being my first A+; it has that sort of mild copper/dirty penny tinge on some swigs, which detracts only incidentally from the experience. That sort of alkaline/acidic stinger. Also, the sheer robustness of character coupled with the ABV precludes me from drinking more than a bomber's worth of this beast.

Smell: Rich dark toasted caramel malts, dark chocolate, and coffee with some strong hints of dark fruits and molasses. Also some hints of anise, vanilla, and brown sugar. Aroma is fairly strong on the fruit and anise.  Taste: Starts with the dark roasted caramel and toffee malts along with dark chocolate, molasses, and a strong presence of dark fruit that includes some figs and plums. The notes of coffee come in midway adding some light bitterness. A decent presence of anise lingers throughout. Light hint of earthy hops in the finish. Sweet for a RIS but pretty well balanced.  Mouthfeel: Medium body with a light to medium amount of carbonation. Very creamy and smooth with no alcohol heat detected.  Overall: A very good take on a Russian Imperial Stout.

I love this brew. So much so that I brewed a clone of it that’s conditioning now. Can’t wait to try it!

147,1160,thatruth,3.95,"my first review, hello all! wish me luck!  grabbed a 22oz of this on a recent trip down the street to the Beer Junction in West Seattle. poured from 2011 Classic Release bottle into pint glass.  Appearance: pours like a nice black, roast coffee. foamy, light brown lacing. looks opaque inside glass. absolutely no light penetrates this beer.  Smell: smoky, bbq, oak, dark chocolate, almost a hazelnut cappuccino vibe in there as well. like walking through a burning forest. a roasting, chocolaty forest.  Taste: pretty alchi-tasting, surprisingly. at 10.5% alcohol this may come as a surprise to few, but with most of Stone's creations I've had the taste hits you before the alcohol, not here. aside from that, very much like the smell. oak, coffee, lacquer, hint of dark chocolate. for some VERY strange reason this beer consistently reminds me of Rogue's Juniper Pale Ale, must be the slightest hint of an herb akin to juniper somewhere.  Mouthfeel: pleasant enough for it's high alco content foundation, doesn't hover long after it goes down, ""burnt cigar"" aftertaste as a friend of mind so wittingly put it once, as with most Imperial Russian Stouts.  Overall: surprised. Stone has always been held high, if not the highest in my brewer's book. although I haven't had the entire catalog or anything, Arrogant Bastard has long been my favorite beer, Ruination and IPA are great, and having the Sublimely Self-Righteous for the first time the other day, I can definitely say this one just falls short of the others. perhaps it was the barrel or bottle, I won't hesitate to give it another try one day.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,96

Roasty chocolate coffee that is blended together pretty well. Alcohol is there, but much more mellowed out. Right on par as far as sweetness goes. No hops detected as I would expect from a 6 year old beer. You can tell this beer has sat for awhile. Pretty complex. As I said before wish I could pick out more flavors, but they are all intertwined at this point.  Mouthfeel is good. Lower carbonation, malts really stick to the sides of the mouth.  Overall this is a great beer. Never had such an old beer before so I didn't know what to expect besides what I've read. Pleasantly surprised.

'Expect our version of this mysterious brew to pour like Siberian crude and taste even heavier!' Ha ha, nice and fitting for this wonderful beer.  I poured this aggressively to first taste, which resulted in a black, thick liquid with a nice 3 finger creamy froth that dissipate to almost nothing. A nice lacing is left behind through the brew. I poured the second taste much more carefully and the 2 finger lingered for a minute or so, but not long.  This beer exhibits roasted coffee aromas and a spicy blackcurrant and dark cherry. I get a slight hint of alcohol as well.  This is a full bodied stout that starts with roasted coffee and mocha flavors with a slight hoppiness that leads into a fruitiness of cherry, raisen, and some spice and oak. Halfway through I get some caramel and alcohol almost bourbon flavored. Everything is well blended and remarkably drinkable for this whopping 10.5%abv. I must note the bottle states its a 2011 classic release. Slightly higher than the usual IRS. I get a fruity creamy roasted coffee and cherry aftertaste that has a nice lasting effect. Well done Stone for blending everything exceptionally well together.  This is a wonderful drink and take on IRS style. In Stone's traditional bold style, not for the feint of heart!",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,96
147,1160,Dreadnaught33,4.6,"This is a beer (that I'm finally rating) that was for me as I imagine it might be for many a gateway beer into the craft realm back in college maybe around 2004. This is beer that even if you have had crazy awesome rare beers in the RIS category or whatever category, you still can come back to this beer and be very pleased. There was a thread about beers that the BA community should 'respect' even if they are not the 'best' or 'rarest', and for me this is definitely one of those beers.  A: deep dark black hue with a nice tan head and some nice lacing as well. A great start.  S: Charred alcohol infused malts with an over-riding coffee and roast. Some other notes of cocoa nib, dark berries maybe blackberry.cherry, vanilla, maybe port-like notes, and some more, really nice RIS aroma.  T: The smell with an abundance of layers in flavor. Chocolate soaked malt and espresso roast. A nice hop ester bitter finish with overall charred malts lingering. The middle of the beer is reminiscent of pastry, to me a fillo dough chocolate croissant. Some licorice/anise notes too. What a great tasting beer. For me, amazingly the flavor is up there with Kate, Dark Lord and all those other crazy RIS.  M: Smooth and semi thick, not as palate coating and thick as I normally like but still nice.  Overall, a splendid. An amazing example of the style and aggressive! Excellent.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,96
147,1160,lazjuarez,4.03,"Poured from a 750ml bottle into a goblet. Vintage: 2011 Classic Release  A: Pours a dark, almost like motor oil black in color. About 1 finger worth of mocha colored head that dissipates to a nice cap, leaving behind a good amount of lacing along with some alcohol legs.  S: Nose is full of roasted malts, sweet espresso notes, milk chocolate, and a light alcohol note that really brings everything together nicely.  T: Big coffee flavor, not as sweet as the nose. Has a good note of alcohol that helps balance the sweetness.  M: Medium bodied, coats the mouth well. For a 10.5% ABV, I can barely notice, although it does has have a slight warming effect. Overall a very well put together stout from beginning to end.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,96
147,1160,bsp77,4.49,"Serving glass: Poured from bottle into Snifter. 2011 vintage.  Appearance: Near black with initial thick brown head, leaving some light lacing behind.  Smell: Lots of molasses along with some anise, soy sauce, chocolate and coffee. Seems to be a decent amount of spicy hops as well.  Taste: Close to equal measures of molasses, dark chocolate, coffee and anise. The finish has a strong roasted bite, and is also spicy, bitter and a little bit salty.  Feel: Massive, thick (but extremely smooth and creamy) body. Moderately low carbonation, fairly dry finish and very warming.  Overall: This is surprisingly a very straightforward RIS. While I might have expected something a little more out of left field from Stone, I am impressed by how well they made a traditional Imperial Stout. Fantastic stuff!",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,96
147,1160,Briken,4.05,"Nearly black with a moderate tight brown head with good retention and nice lacing. Espresso, chocolate and light licorice aroma. Rich roasted coffee and alcohol with a chocolate end finishing with a biting hops and roasted bitterness. Thick, frothy and very smooth.  ’09- alcohol is stronger but melds well with blended, mellower flavors and a bit more sweetened chocolate.  Another beer I enjoyed pre-BA shattered…sigh. I held this beer in such high esteem I held on to my ’09 to sample against the newer version. It’s not as complex as I remember as I see it now a bit high on the roasted side. Certainly a great beer but it just can’t live up to the pedestal and expectations I had previously had for it. Oh I was so naïve… blessed ignorance. Damn my developing palate and BA for introducing me to a wonderful world of beer!",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,96
147,1160,plfahey,4.57,"22 oz. bottle (2011 vintage) poured into a tulip glass. (8/11/11)  Appearance-Midnight black and totally opaque-sucks in light like a black hole. Impossible to discern clarity. Moderate sized light brown head with decent retention.  Aroma-Wow-Chocolate, cinnamon, cherries, plums, prunes, coffee, roasted malt, touch of caramel, some alcohol notes, and some green, citrusy hops. The amount of chocolate in the aroma is impressive, and manifests as brownies, malted milk balls, and german chocolate cake. Smells delicious.  Flavor-Chocolate cake up front before fading into roasted espresso flavors. Roast comes through strong, but doesn't quite become burnt. Some citrus and floral hop flavors show through, along with moderate hop bitterness. Some fruit comes through in the finish (cherry and prune). Aftertaste is fruity with roast bitterness and drying alcohol.  Mouthfeel-Medium full and slightly chewy. Moderate carbonation. Definite alcohol warmth.  A pretty kick-ass RIS, though I think it could improve even a bit more with a little age. Sufficient roast, but not much in the way of burnt flavors, which is okay with me. Moderate amount of fruity esters and tons of chocolate make for a very pleasant beer, and definitely a go-to for dessert pairing.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,96
147,1160,pmarlowe,4.42,"2011 vintage. 22oz bottle. Tulip glass.  A: Pours black, a thin cap of medium khaki head which disappears quickly to a ring which sticks around for awhile. Almost no lacing.  S: Roasted malt melds nicely with coffee, milk chocolate, vanilla, and cream. Very well balanced.  T: Roasted malt and coffee. Alcohol is a tad noticeable at the end, but that's my only complaint.  M: On the lighter end of carbonation, which supports the beer nicely. Full bodied.  O: Exceptional, well-made stout, well balanced and easy to drink. This is so easily available and reasonably priced that this should be a staple.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,96
147,1160,amphion1065,4.38,"On-tap at Lord Hobo. An indulgent $6.50 12 oz. pour.  Lord Hobo's uncharacteristically excellent lighting allowed me to really appreciate the appearance of this beer. It's very dark, not quite black but certainly eggplant purple. A light tan one-finger head really sticks around. I couldn't stop swirling this one - great lacing around my glass. Just a few legs running down the sides. Very nice.  Quite a lot of chocolate and coffee in the smell. As it warmed, I could detect just a hint of an alcohol burn, but it was accompanied by a touch of vanilla as well. Strangely enough, not many dark fruits in the nose, which jives with my past experiences with this beer.  The taste is a coffee explosion, reminiscent of very fresh Speedway Stout. Deep dark chocolate flavors alongside the coffee, with a really enticing bitter/sweet balance at work. There's a robust hop profile that lends another bittering element to temper what would otherwise be an overly sweet RIS. The alcohol is hidden remarkably well.  Mouthfeel is velvety smooth, thick and lush without feeling syrupy. This just goes down so easily.  A modicum of the style and a superb beer. This year's batch is a winner.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,96
147,1160,DrewV,4.08,"Poured from a 22 oz. bomber (2011 Classic release at 10.5% ABV) into a snifter.  A: A pitch black liquid emerges from the bottle and resides equally dark in the glass. A darkish mocha colored 1-finger head leaves some spotty lacing on the glass. Alcohol ""legs"" stream down the glass, showing a heavy ABV.  S: Dark roast, a bit of dark fruit hiding in the aroma, moderate coffee, well-balanced overall. Alcohol is present, but not overwhelming.  T: Syrupy sweet malt initially latches onto your taste buds and doesn't let go. Thick, hearty roast with some faint coffee. Some bitterness from the balancing hops comes into play towards the end. The booze breaks through the flavor profile and kicks you in the throat midway through the sip. Although this is a well-crafted brew, it loses a few points due to the booze.  M: Wow, this is a thick brew. Extremely hearty, almost syrupy in its body. A well-balanced malt and hop bomb all rolled into one. Adequately carbonated, but definitely on the lighter side, which suits the style well. An oily finish brings up the rear while the aftertaste trails off on the chocolate-coffee side with added bitterness.  O: This ain't no amateur's beer! A thick, hearty, boozy brew that takes a developed palate to appreciate. A bit too heavy on the solventy alcohol for my taste; this brew would certainly benefit from a year or two in the cellar to calm down the bitterness and booze.  NOTE: To be fair, the bottle DOES warn of this beer's hearty and boozy nature. In that regard, it certainly lives up to its promise. Be warned!",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,96
147,1160,LaneMeyer,4.03,"Poured from a bottle into a tulip  A- Black, with beautiful one/two finger, tan/light tan head.  S- Roasted malts, maple syrup, brown sugar, some hints of dark fruits.  T- Big roasted malts, slightly bitter  M- Thick, rich, nicely carbonated, very smooth.  O- This is a great example of a RIS. It's nothing overly exciting but for the price it really hits the spot.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,96
147,1160,MadCat,4.8,"2011 release, 10.5% abv.  Appearance: Black as night, with a big muddy brown head that leaves considerable lacing  Smell: Smells of rich dark chocolate, coffee, roasted malts, black currant  Taste: Rich and decadent, intense dark chocolate, dark roast coffee, roasted malts, black currant, plums, caramel, and some bit of hops in there. It has a good balance between sweet and bitter, with sweet winning out. No booziness or alcohol taste.  Mouthfeel: Full body, medium carbonation, rich, thick and velvety smooth  Overall: This is a top brew for me, and my favorite from Stone by far. I'm glad I grabbed a few bottles this year, it will be tough for it to last me until next release. Probably one of the best, if not the best, Russian Imperial Stouts out there.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,96
147,1160,BelgiumBill,4.47,"Paid $6.99 for a 22 oz bottle at Total Wine.  This is the 2011 release. I served it in a Guinness pint glass at 49 degrees.  It was a jet black color with no signs of light even at the rim. A medium beige 1.5 inch foamy head with bubbles held up for several minutes gently clinging to the side of the glass.  A swirl and a sniff revealed roasted malts, molasses, sambuca, and dark roast coffee.  My first thoughts entering the mouth is thick, full outhfeel and balance. The 2nd sip revealed a complex roasted flavor profile along with ample hop bite that you would expect from Stone. Cuban coffee and licorice lead the flavor bill.  I was surprised that the flavors were no more intense given the color and forthright nose. Don't be mistaken, while not as intense or in your face as other imperials, this was a masterpiece of complexity, balance, and mouthfeel exceeding what one would normally find in an imperial.  The alcohol was present but well integrated into the structure and not at all boozy aside from the licorice reminiscent of sambuca.  The bottle suggests you buy a case and drink one every 3-6 months to see how it develops. I may actually do that. It was excellent.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,96
147,1160,woosterbill,4.19,"2011 bottle into a Duvel tulip; I can't believe I haven't gotten around to reviewing this one yet.  A: No surprises here: it's thick, black, and opaque with two fingers of solid, frothy brown head that sticks around admirably and leaves some nice lace. You can't ask for anything more from an RIS.  S: Rich, robust aroma of dark chocolate, roasted coffee, and some prominently piney + citrusy hops. I really like the aggressive hoppiness as a compliment to the big time roast, but there's something about the aroma that keeps reminding me of bug spray - it's a kind of sharp, herbal bitterness that (positively) reminds me of being at my cabin in Wisconsin, but also (negatively) the distasteful odor of Off. Is this what you get when you mix high-alpha hops, roasted barley, and noticeable alcohol? Oh, well, at least it's a minor component of the predominantly enjoyable nose.  T: Bittersweet roasted malts start things off, with some lovely dark chocolate and dark fruits; coffee and char show the depth of the roast midway through, and alcohol combines with huge grapefruit hop bitterness on the long, hot, vicious finish. I love how huge the flavors are, but there's no denying that the finish is beyond rough. As it approaches room temperature, though, it finally gets sweet enough to handle the bitterness, and even adds a nice bit of spiciness. I think this is one that will benefit from some age, but it's damn tasty right now.  M: Thick, viscous, and nicely carbonated. Luscious.  O: This is a deservedly well-regarded beer (and especially impressive given the relatively reasonable price tag), but it's desperately in need of some charm school - as of right now its booziness and bitterness are just too unmannered for polite company. I've been drinking so many light summer beers lately, though, that this is the perfect complement to a rainy August evening. I'll have to open up a 2010 bottle soon to see how it compares, but sadly bombers aren't conducive to solo verticals so that won't be tonight.  Cheers!  Edit: I'm drinking one of my 2010s right now, and it's even more delicious. Still gorgeous, devoid of bugspray aromas, and packed with the same flavors - minus the burn. A year and a half of age has really tamed the beast, and right now its balanced mix of dark chocolate brownie batter sweetness and fruity hop bitterness is working beautifully. I'd probably give it a set of scores along the lines of 5/4.5/4.5/4.5/4.5. Terrific beer, and only $8. I just saw 5 more 2010s on the shelf last night, so now that I've confirmed my suspicion that the beer ages well I'll be cleaning them out.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,96
147,1160,fsvan,4.25,"Bottle poured into New Belgium globe. 2011 vintage.  A- Extremely dark. Maybe not quite black, but not far from it. 2 fingers of frothy dark head.  S- Roasted malts, coffee, some bitterness. The 10.5% is hidden incredibly well. The coffee notes dominate.  T- Tons of bitterness. Roasted malts. The coffee in the nose is not nearly as apparent on the tongue. Alcohol is hidden very well again.  M- Smooth, well carbonated, but could be a little heavier for such a big RIS.  O- Stone IRS is a damn good beer. It isn't a top 100 beer in the world, in my opinion, but it is very good.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,96
147,1160,kylehay2004,4.45,"A: Excellent 3 finger, brown head which left lots of lace. This beer poured thick from the bottle. This is as dark as it gets with no real light getting through.  S: I caught the aroma of this beer as it poured a good foot from my nose. Roasty and a decent amount of coffee, caramel and chocolate and notes. Cocoa is apparent as well.  T: Initial coffee fades to a semi-sweet roasted flavor. Bit of a crisp alcohol character.  M: Oily, thick beer. Full bodied and moderate carbonation.  Overall: Well, this is a very nice beer. I definitely am not going to be drinking these often just because of the alcohol content but the beer is very complete and an all around top in its genre.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,96
147,1160,lnashsig,4.45,"2011 Stone RIS poured into my Brooklyn tulip. Pours a pitch black, syrupy texture. Awesome brown/tan head, about 3 fingers. No light gets through this at all. Just black as motor oil. Smell- roasty, mocha, dark chocolate. Dark fruits, maybe some coffee bitterness. Taste- bitterness, roasty notes, dark chocolate, the alcohol is definitely here- not very well hidden, but I think I actually like my RIS to burn me every now and then. Something to hit you in the face and say ""I'm a badass and you are a weakling"". Back to the review...definite dark fruits and a warming alcohol presence. At the end, there is a bitterness from the hops. Mouthfeel- this is slick, and although is a definite sipper, is nice and velvety. Drinkability- this beer is menacing, evil, and wants to impose its dark will upon you. I bought 3 bottles of this, and can't wait to see what it does after a couple years on it. Some of the alcohol heat will die, and it will be super super smooth.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,96

S - ROASTED roasting malty goodness! A dry, coffee scent with some hints of dark chocolate. Also had a smores like smell just without the marshmallow. Next time, I'll dip a marshmallow in this one.  T - Much like the smell. Coffee and malts with some oatmeal character. Not as much chocolate as I expected.  M - Very dry character with some good carbonation.

147,1160,angrygrimace,4.62,"22 ounce bomber poured into a tulip; this is the 2011 classic release.  Pours a pitch black with a slight beige head with little retention. Little visible carbonation. Nose is mostly roasted coffees and a bit of chocolate and slight notes of vanilla and alcohol. Does not appear nearly as motor-oil thick as Yeti or Speedway Stout.  Taste is actually somewhat surprising; you definitely have your big coffees up front, but it's quite balanced. Big, rich and malty. Other reviewers seem to have found noticeable alcohol in the taste, but I didn't find that the case with this batch; very smooth.  Doesn't feel super thick in the mouth, but there is a bit of that viscous quality you expect out of an IRS.  Overall it's one of the best IRS's I've tried. I'm used to a much thicker and harsher drink with an IRS; this one's a bit uncharacteristic of what I'm used to with the style but makes for an excellent sipping beer.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,96

S - A lot of coffee in the nose along with the usual roasted malt. A good amount of alcohol definitely comes forward with this.  T - This is an extremely smooth imperial stout. There is a lot of coffee up front followed by a touch of bittersweet chocolate and then definite roasted malt. [Edit]: Dark fruit becomes noticeable just before the finish. Coffee and roasted malt is apparent in the finish along with some booziness. The roasty flavors mask the alcohol content extremely well.  M - Thick and creamy with moderate carbonation. Exceptionally smooth for the style.  O - Stone offers a great example of an RIS with this brew. I would highly recommend it to anyone that is a fan of the style. The smoothness can't be overstated, and the balance of flavors along with that make for a wonderfully drinkable imperial stout.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,96
147,1160,ShogoKawada,4.27,"I never bought this one- always a beer I skipped. Now imperial stouts aren't my bread and butter, but I do enjoy them from time to time. Figured I'd give this a go, and I'm glad I did. 2011 Vintage into pint glass.  Pours more dark brown than black although it walks the line. Spotty but nice lacing, head settles quickly.  Nose brings on some dried fruit, dates, figs? And some coffee. Bit of hot cocoa there too. Odd, but intriguing.  This one really shines when you take a sip, though. Flavors are bold, pretty hoppy and lots of dark malt goodness. Coffee is bitter like espresso, chocolate has some sweet cream to it. Fruit that was strong in the nose is all-but-gone, not that I'm complaining.  The beer is a bit much this fresh, but I can dig it. Alcohol heat is there, so letting this one sit and mellow a bit might prove successful. I'm enjoying this one as-is, though.  Overall, this is one of the better imperial stouts I've had in a while. It's one I def. can see myself buying again. Well done, Stone.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,96
147,1160,claspada,4.27,"2007 vintage courtesy of my favorite beer pal HimerMan. Pours as dark as freakin' night; small brown leathery looking (is that possible) one finger head of foam. Crazy nice lacing as well. Aromas begin with dark roasted malts (expected), comprised of dark chocolate, roasted espresso beans, and a light milk/sweet chocolate note. As it warms you get great dark fruitiness (black cherries all over the place). The tastes begin with waves and waves of various chocolate flavors. I get dark chocolate and milk chocolate and bakers chocolate and Hershey's cocoa powder, wow! As it warms I get the dark cherries again which is a glorious quality that develops from these Russian Imp Stouts when they are aged properly. Finish is dry due to either the initial hop bill or the abundance of dark roasted malts in the grain bill. The mouthfeel is fantastic; coats your entire mouth with the dark bitter chocolate flavors and lingers on your tongue for a decent amount of time after you sip. Plenty of carbonation which I always appreciate and it drinks medium to full bodied overall I have to say. Overall, d@mn girl sh#t; this beer is meant for aging. Some like it young when it's more hoppy and bitter and acrid, but I cannot highly recommend more that you should age this for at least 2 years (preferably up to 4 or more apparently) to enjoy the great complexity that this beer can offer.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,96

Initial smell was dark roasted malt...a bit of chocolate mixed in, followed by some spices...pepper? cinammon? Very lovely...complex as hell.  Holy Moly! The first sip was smooth as hell! Taste followed scent...a creamy, chocolate latte, some sweet dark fruits, and then a slap of hoppy bitterness at the end. As with a lot of good strong stouts, the taste evolves as it warms...almost getting smoother, tastier...if that's even possible.

Scent is a massive amount of chocolate malt, a bit of roast, a bit of dark fruit and a bit of hop. The taste is thick and bold. Very large does of chocolate malt, spicy alcohol, spice, dark fruits, not as much roast as the scent suggested, which wasnt much. Its prety smooth. A touch of coffee, some nuts, candy sweetness.

Taste is thick and malty, with coffee and the anise finally coming through. There is heat from the alcohol, but it's gentle. Really, a stellar tasting beer.  It's big and thick on the palate, absolutely nothing like the watered down porter I had last night. It's only slightly sweet initially before the heat and bitter coffee take over. Despite the big flavors, there's a smooth creaminess to it.  This is a big beer that means business. However, despite some of its bigness, it's easy to drink and very smooth. One of Stone's better selections. Very glad I bought two of these.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,96
147,1160,seand,4.1,"2011 and 2006 bombers tasted side by side. Scores are for the fresh bottle, with differences described in each section.  A: 2011 pours deep black with a thick dark tan head. Just a patchy bubbly layer retains, but it's enough to leave nice spot lacing. The 2006 is the same color for both the beer and the head, but has very little head even with an aggressive pour. Just a thin rim around the glass and a few small thin patches of head retain.  S: Sweet molasses and roasted malts, with a touch of some kind of fruit liqueur. The 2006 is much more developed. Some of the high end burnt notes have faded, but the middle has filled out with a somewhat licorice-like note.  T: Like the aroma, sweet with roasted malts, but with a somewhat hoppy finish. The 2006, on the other hand, is extremely deep and thick. It retains the sweetness, but with next to no hop notes. The finish is kind of like a good espresso; not bitter, but strong, and with a very nice top end sweetness that's only detectable if you're paying attention. If I were rating the 2006, it would easily be a 5.0.  M: Full body, with carbonation on the high side of medium. 2006 is a bit lower carbonation, and the carbonation that's there is a bit smoother.  Overall, the 2011 is a very good beer, but the 2006 is an incredible one. An excellent example of the specific type of depth and complexity that only seems to show up in aged beers.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,96

But what can you expect. Not much lacing to speak of.  S: Rather light. I'm kinda disappointed. Mainly chocolate. Light roasted coffee notes. Some dark fruits, raisins, figs, and cherries. Light boosiness.  T: Very boosy. Needs some age. Dark fruits, chocolate, coffee. Everything the nose has.  M: Full bodied. Creamy.  O: Didn't live up to the hype for me. Definitely a good.

147,1160,Alieniloquium,4.54,"22 oz. bottle poured into a tulip.  Appearance - Pitch black body. No transparency at all. Not too viscous looking as it pours, but it stains the glass as I swirl it. Nice tan head, but it doesn't leave a tremendous amount of lace.  Smell - Wow, chocolate and coffee. And none added? That's amazing. I've tasted coffee stouts with less coffee aroma than this. Great roasted malt character. Maybe a bit of hops coming through at the end.  Taste - Again, a strong chocolate and coffee flavor. An interesting sweetness persists through the drink, but gives way to a nice hop back. Not overly hopped, like Old Rasputin, but just a nice bitter finish. Very nice.  Mouthfeel - Not quite as viscous as I thought it would be. I like my giant stouts to be a bit chewy. This one goes down VERY smooth, with just a hint of alcohol burn.  Overall - Just outstanding. I bought 6 bottles and I think I need to go back and buy more.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,96

Subtle notes of coffee and espresso. On the tongue, coffee is more pronounced, cocoa hits you in the back and in the after taste. Overall, well balanced, good year for the RIS.

S - Strong aroma of chocolate, cocoa and dark fruits. Also some hints of vanilla. Alcohol is fairly subdued. A cornucopia of complex aromas.  T - Unlike the nose the alcohol definitely comes thru but not in a bad way. I get strong chocolate and coffee flavors. There is also some pleasant burnt and smokey flavors as well. Extremely well balanced. The flavors found within this beer are extremely rich and complex.  M - Pleasantly thick body with a good amount of carbonation.  Overall a great representation of an Imperial Russian Stout. I would drink this beer 100 times over. I recommend putting a few in the cellar to let the alcohol mellow out. Search this RIS out. It is worth it.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,96

T: sweet, lightly roasted malt flavor. definitely more on the sweet chocolate side than the astrigent roast side. super rich.

D: purchased the bottle this week and was labeled as a 2010 release. definitely excited to get a little age on this one. glues to the palate. gonna finish the rest of this bomber with a cigar. should be the perfect after dinner match.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,96

Has a great aroma of dark malts and fruits, cocoa, chocolate and some dark coffee. Only a tad of hops on the nose. Has a full-bodied taste to it with all those great rich, malty, dark chocolate flavors to it. Also has some dark roastiness and some sweet bitterness in the after taste.  Quite a good Imperial Russian Stout with a good bit of complexity of flavors. Well worth a taste.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,96
147,1160,Thickfreakness,4.18,"2011 bottle poured into my DFH signature glass that just came in the mail today! A wonderful gift from my wonderful wife!  A- Pours jet black and has the most beautiful kahki, creamy tan head floating upon it. Little bits of lacing and a decent amount of carbonation.  S- Dark roasted coffee, licorice, chocolate, Burnt malts, dried fruits (cherries, prunes, figs). A hint of hoppiness floats in and out.  T- Deep espresso flavors, bitter dark chocolate, licorice candy, pipe tabacco, and roasted/burnt malts and smoke. Dark fruit flavors settle on the tongue at first, giving way to delicious coffee and cocoa bitterness and warming booze.  M- Bitter, creamy and thick! Really coats your tongue in cappuccino, licorice, and alcohol.  O- Just a touch alcohol hot right now, but I'm gonna age a few of these. Really nice roasty coffee, chocolate and licorice flavors.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,96
147,1160,bishopdc0,3.9,"Shared a this beer with my wife. It poured black and a tan head forms. As it settles a thick head forms and floats on top.  The aroma is wonderful, fresh cocoa with almost creamy sweetness like melted chocolate icecream. Very nice. In the end is a hint of spice likly some hops.  The taste is almost like an imperial black ale it starts with a mouthfull of soft carbonation, as the carbonation dissipates the chocolate taste presents with hints of a roasted barley. The roasts mixes with a hop flavor slight spicy and a mix of alcohol the back.  I will have to age as the alcohol was a bit much.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,96
147,1160,mattmuck11,4.92,"Appearance: Pours a thick, rich brown-black with two fingers of mocha-brown head. Slight carbonation is visible rising from the bottom of pint glass to the middle before dying. Head is resilient and rocky developing slight lace that sticks around after head dissipates.  Smell: Chocolate and coffee are the main actors in this drama of complexity. Heavy alcohol tones with some spice (currant, pepper?) Just a hint of hops present foreshadowing the slightest bitterness. Caramel finishes off the syrupy feel.  Taste: Roastiness and coffee come to mind immediately before giving way to a chocolaty smooth, syrupy slide down the back of the palate and down the throat. The spice is there too, hinting of black pepper. Again, just the right amount of hoppy bitterness present in the taste as it was present in the nose. The flavor is dynamic and remains with you all the way through the palate, finishing with a perfect bitterness for a stout, giving a long aftertaste sweet and malty yet well-balanced.  Overall: For one of my first intrusions into the world of stout brews, this one is delightfully complex, bold and infinitely better than the common Stout. The flavor is complex and dynamic and left me wanting more. Well carbonated and easy-drinking for a stout, despite the presence of alcohol in the nose and taste. Pleasant to the finish. I would definitely recommend this to someone interested in knowing what an American-style stout can taste like.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,96
147,1160,angelogarcia3,4.58,"This excellent stout has a great rich looking blackness with a dark rich head that slowly dissipates. The aromas of bittersweet chocolate hit you as you take your first sip. The mouthfeel is thick though not strongly overpowering. The taste is a full bodied dark chocolate with hints of cocoa, with a slight bitterness on the finish that works well with the loaded fries at Sapsuckers in Huntington, NY.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,96
147,1160,obywan59,4.35,"The brew pours black as night into my pint glass with an initial 4 finger head that needs time to settle before I can get half of the bottle into my glass. The second pour, of the now much warmer beer yielded nearly a 5 finger head with 3 fingers of beer left in the bottle.  The aroma is rich with coffee and a bit of near metallic funkiness at first that may contain a bit of anise. As the beer warms, the funkiness disappears and the coffee aroma diminishes a bit, and I get more dark chocolate instead. The aroma mellows into more like milk chocolate or a hoppy ripe-citrus as the beer warms even further.  This beer is very sweet for the style with some anise-like flavor followed up by some light bitterness and a taste of alcohol in the end which gives a sense of fortified dark chocolate.  Full bodied. Very creamy and smooth. Light to moderate carbonation. Substantial alcohol burn early on, but it mellows out. Nicely warming.  A great beer! Stone is famous for it's hop heavy brews, but this one showcases the malt. The thickness and the ABV slow you down a bit, but this is not a hard drinker in the least! It's a sipper that demands respect.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,96
147,1160,Gmann,4.3,"Pours a midnight black color with a short dense light brown head that settled into a light ring.  The aroma is of a milk chocolate, toasted pumpernickle, and caramel. Sweet for the style not much of a roasted malt pick up.  The taste is smooth and chocolatey. A mixture of milk and dark chocolate. More toasted pumpernickle in the flavor with heavy caramel. There is a solid roast bitterness in the finish. Some anise spice is detected as well. Quite smooth, glad it is not a roasted malt bomb that RIS can be.  Moderate to full feel with soft carbonation that leads to a silky feel. Nice balance but does finish with a roasted bitterness. Definitely a bit sticky. ABV well hidden.  Very good stout, very smooth and drinkable. Not sure why it took me so long to try this.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,96

Taste is quite bitter (but it's a Stone); sharp and clean finishing, but if you're not a fan of hoppy Russian Imperial Stouts.  Mouthfeel is standard for the style.  For a Russian imperial stout, it's hoppy and bitter, but good.  EDIT: Tasted a 2008 vintage. Nose is mellowed as has its taste-- really balanced, sublime. Slightly spicy, malty, the hops are tempered but not absent. Some burnt caramel.

I poured from a 22oz bomber into a goblet, 2011 vintage.  This pours a used motor oil dark black, no light penetrates any where. This has a large mocha head which has dissipated to a 1/2 finger size which still remains. Smells of coffee, roasted malts, licorice, vanilla bean, dark chocolate. The mouth feel is thick and creamy, nice carbonation. The taste is a good as it looks, dark chocolate and coffee, dark roasted malts, a hint of licorice (way better than the belgo), some hops and alcohol burn on the way down with a bitter dark chocolate after flavor.  Overall, wow, this beer actually lived up to the hype, its miles better than the odd year belgo version. I'm going to go back and buy a case of this. Amazing beer.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,96
147,1160,CaptainTripps,4.03,"2011 vintage  22oz bottle poured into a Duvel Tulip, served at cellar temp.  A: Pours a deep dark black with about a half a fingers worth of dark mocha head. Little lacing left on the side of the glass.  S: Dark fruits really come to mind with the first sniff, black currents to be specific. There is a big coffee character with this beer as well followed by nice chocolate notes. Small traces of vanilla and alcohol. Some roastyness.  T: Again, black current is really dominating with this beer. There is coffee and chocolate, but not as strong as the dark fruits. There is some oakyness in the taste as well as some vanilla (small) and alcohol (not over the top).  M: Medium to full bodied beer. It has some carbonation in the beer, but not a whole lot. Not a big deal being a RIS. Alcohol is there but not over the top. The beer is very smooth and silky.  O: This is a great RIS in its simplest form. Not to over the top but just solid.

S- tons of roasted French pressed coffee at first that blends into some dark chocolate. Solvent alcohol hits you like a punch in the nose put it works in a good way. A hint of hoppiness on the finishs with gigantic roasted malt aroma.  T- dark chocolate and coffee at first that blends with a note of minty hop notes. One of the hoppiest stouts I've ever had. Black current and molasses are nice additions to the normal coffee/chocolate. Warming alchohol on the finish with a solvent character. Finishs with roasted malt complexity and a dark chocolate aftertaste.  MF- thick and smooth. The hoppiness seems to thin out the body however. I've had this with some age on it and let me say that is the way to drink it. Chewy full body with an average carbonation.  D- you feel and taste the booze in this baby. Sip one and done the flavors are well integrated and there is a smoothness that bolsters the drinkability.

147,1160,Knapp85,4.38,"One of Stone's best, The Russian Imperial Stout poured out as a deep thick black liquid with a brown foamy head on top. The lacing was very impressive here. The smell of the beer gives of plenty of roasted malts and chocolate, some hops, and even some sweeter notes from some dark fruits. The taste of the beer is packed with a heavy amount of malts and hops. The flavors evolve into a rich piney chocolatey combo with some fermented fruit in the far distance. The mouthfeel has a great thickness to it and coats the glass and mouth really well. Overall It's a damn good beer and I enjoy it every time I have it.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,96
147,1160,TheWhiskerReview,4.7,"Pours that wonderful soul-crushing black with 2 fingers of dense mahogany colored head. Retention is moderate and the lacing is incredibly sticky.  Lemme just get this outta the way: WOAH!  The nose is akin to going up to your favorite barista and ordering a latte with a suicide shot of all the standard coffeeshop flavors: coffee, chocolate, vanilla, caramel, cinnamon, hazelnut, it goes on... There's fruity touches of prunes and black cherries, while the heavily roasted malt adds more aromas of chocolate wafer. The roast is about one-step shy of having that roasted meat character.  The palate is full-bodied and rich, but definitely not too thick, with a huge bitterness that's nicely tuned-in to the intense roastiness of the malt- flavors of prunes, espresso, black licorice and a cozy blanket of spices. There's a serious underlying fusel alcohol character that, combined with the bottle's mention of Siberian crude, is the unmistakable 'stamp' Stone is leaving on our palates. Despite the big, roasty sweetness, the finish ends on a dryer note with a still-lingering spice and flavors of bitter cacao.  It's always awesome to be able say a beer tastes like something completely unpalatable, but mean it in a good way. Stone fans have my back when I say that this tastes like pure motor oil, and therefore is one of the best stouts I've ever tasted. This not only succeeds to be a great Russian Imp. Stout, but it also is a beer that could only come from one place: Stone. Quite an achievement.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,96

Appears a dark brown, almost black color with a beautiful brown head that leaves some decent lacing and has a constant ring around the edge of the glass.  The nose is full of alcohol, molasses, coffee and even some nice chocolate. The nose isn't overwhelming, but still has nice aromas. The taste is much more complex than the nose, and hides the alcohol very, very well. Starts off pretty sweet with the chocolate and molasses, then moves slightly more bitter with the coffee notes and the hops. The aftertaste is fairly sweet, after the coffee notes are gone, with the chocolate some roasted malts sticking around.  The mouthfeel is pretty smooth.

This thick, foamy head was a dark khaki color, and left lacing everywhere.  S - Coffee and chocolate hit the nose up front, similar to your typical RIS. However, there is added complexity. Oakiness, dark fruit, and lastly, a feint alcohol is present. The alcohol is very well hidden for an 11% brew.  T - Starts off very sweet, with the malt being the in forefront. Chocolate, molasses, and espresso. Then comes a short taste of dark fruit. I can't make out exactly what. Lastly, hops leave a nice kick at the end, combined with the warming effect of the alcohol.  M - This is one of the thicker RIS I've had. It is thick and creamy, without being overly sticky.  Overall, I really enjoyed this beer. I was shocked at how well hidden the alcohol was.

All good here.  Smell: Chocolate, and coffee notes from the roast malts. A trace of alcohol makes it's way known in the nose.  Taste: Follows the nose,chocolate and coffee notes with maybe a hint of brown sugar. Hops in this version and the Belgo appear to be toned down compared to the previous years.  Mouth-feel: On the heavy side of medium-bodied with modest carbonation. A satisfying body.  Overall: A good beer that has been one of my go to RISs for a long time. The fact that it's priced very well and just kicks up a notch or two after a couple of years of aging makes it a steal.

A - Have you ever descended deep bellow the Earth's surface, into some remote caverns where once the feeble glow of your lantern burns out you are left in complete and utter pitch black? Don't waste your time, just pour a glass of this brew, it's the same sensation. Deep Mokah head that rolls back very seductivley as the beer sits: lacing everywhere.  S - A very unique and complex aroma lingers in the mouth of my snifter. Startig with bittersweet chocolate, burnt coffee, and vast roasted malt character, giving way to a plethora of dark fruits, followed appropriately by not so sublte hints of alcohol.  T - Almost perfectly parrallels the smell in every complexity. The only exception being that of of strong anise flavors arising right after the start, after leading with roasted chocolate malt, deliciously bitter coffee and more mellow dark fruits. The finish follows quickly with more anise and coffee as well as a resounding crescendo of alcohol that lingers, tantalizingly, letting you feel that you are alive.  M - The mouthfeel is perfect. Robust and complex, never weak. Hearty enough to brave Siberian nights unscathed.

Rich great nose deep notes of oak, bourbon, chocolate, coffee.  Amazing full flavor. Its along thr lines if the nose yet intensified Strong coffee and chocolate, smoky oak. Great balance, variation and deep rich flavor.  Mouthfeel is slightly dry and full bodied with medium carbonation  Overall this is just an outstanding Russian Imperial.

147,1160,begforme4484,4.25,"There's not much can be said that countless other have said about this beer. It has a great stout appearance with a very nice caramel toffee head. The smell, the taste.. I can't find anything wrong with this beer.  I've had this beer every year that it has been released, and to me, this 2011 batch was much sweeter as it warmed to almost room temp than any previous year before.  I recommend getting a few bottles and finding it on tap.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,96

Behind that there are notes of roasted coffee.  Taste: Mmmm. Roasty with a fair amount of sweetness. Coffee and dark chocolate flavors. Alcohol is noticeable, but doesn't burn at all.  Mouthfeel: Thick, slightly syrupy. Very drinkable, perhaps deceptively so.  Overall: I love it. An excellent Imperial Stout. At 10.5% alcohol, a 22 oz bottle is more than enough, but this is a great beer to spend an evening with.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,96
147,1160,CHickman,4.57,"2011 Classic Release (10.5% ABV)-Pours as dark as a black hole with zero light penetrating the beer, a very nice 2 finger frothy tan/brown head with tons of bubbles that faded very slowly, leaving very good sticky foamy lacing. The head bubbled up like a tar pit and made me want to sip it right away.  Smells of coffee grinds, cocoa powder, chocolate, molasses, roasted grains, burnt wood, dark fruit and light vanilla; there is a whiff of alcohol like rum mixed with toffee and coffee beans. This nose is rich, roasted and like a burnt coffee spiked with some rum or bourbon, which hides the ABV well and is sweet and inviting considering the menacing kick I’m expecting after the first half of this bomber.  Tastes pretty much like it smells, but with even more complexities and flavors as the it begins to warm; starts off with cocoa powder, chocolate, molasses, followed by the bitterness of coffee grinds, coffee, roasted grains, burnt wood, and perhaps some hops, which add a peppery zing; then the sweetness trails, leading with dark fruit like date and plum, light vanilla, caramel or syrup, licorice, brown sugar and then the alcohol heat. The heat is evident, but minor and seems like a shot of rum or bourbon in the mix. There is a malty sweetness and a grainy feel after each swallow, but man I must say that I was pleasantly surprised by how easy this went down. Compared to Avery Mephistopheles, this slid down with very little resistance while remaining extremely flavorful. Each sip leaves a coffee residue, with caramel and/or syrup sticking to the tongue.  Mouthfeel is creamy and slick, with average to light carbonation, as expected a heavy body, and a weighty feel like each sip was meant to pause and enjoy the sensation. Any fan of hard alcohol, stouts and coffee will love this beer; it’s like some chocolate cake was mashed into a stout, and then topped off with a little booze, and somehow it all comes together and works perfectly.  Overall this is a very impressive beer, and one I highly recommend. It’s a shame I had to finish it all as I really enjoyed this and it got better and tastier as it warmed. Factor in the 10.5% ABV, and this is a highly drinkable beer that any stout and imperial stout fan should seek out and drink…immediately.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,96

Fairly sweet smell  T - Like the smell, sweet molasses up front, roasted malts in the middle, and an alcohol kick at the end. So damn smooth! Wow!

Taste is more of the same but the chocolate is more on the milk chocolate side and there's also a sour rye bread component. Long satisfying finish.

147,1160,Gehrig,5,"The wonderful manager of the sterling Sun Singer in Champaign, IL flagged me as I was searching for some beer, alerting me to Stone's Russian Imperial Stout's presence. What a magnificent call, and very much appreciated. Two lush mocha fingers of froth top a deep, black body. Ample duration and lacing on the trusty Duvel tulip leave me very impressed.  Big, burly aromas greet the nose with this magnificent RIS--vanilla bean, espresso, dark chocolate, and plenty of anise and molasses. A true olfactory masterpiece. The taste does not let up in the slightest from the nose. Lots of licorice, coffee bean, chocolate and caramel malt leave me most impressed with the sturdy malt backbone. Rich effervescence mingles the melange of flavors adroitly. The heat from the alcohol emerges a bit late in the second half of this beast, but is not overbearing at all despite the very high ABV (10.5%).  Magnificent beer and RIS, truly one of the very best I've enjoyed. A great, complex RIS, Stone has created one of the all-time great beers, and one of the 2 or 3 best stouts on my radar. A superlative achievement.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,96
147,1160,ChugginOil,4.45,"Doing a mini-vertical with a 2010 and 2011 vintage.  2011 Vintage is up first  Pours a dark hazelnut brown color and finishes solid black. There is an ample amount of tan colored head that retains for quite some time. Oily legs leave some spotty lacing. The nose coffee, currants, some chocolate and caramel are present as well but coffee is prominent. The taste is coffee flavored big time up front with hint cocoa. Molasses rings throughout the taste and creates a very sweet flavor. The 10.5% alcohol is pretty well hidden but shows its face as it warms up. The mouthfeel is thick and viscous but still quite drinkable. Sticky with a slight dry finish. Delightful. Overall, this is a super tasty, well crafted Russian Imperial Stout that displays everything I want in a stout. Yum  2010 Vintage  Pours a very dark (almost black) brown color. A fluffy 3 inches of light tan head sits briefly. The slick, oily lacing leaves sporadic spots of lacing. The nose is much more butterscotch infused and smells much more sweeter than the fresh bottle. A sweet caramel malt dominates with a bit of cocoa and booze heat. The taste is sweet with some dark fig like fruits, chocolate, anise and roasted/burnt malt. The mouthfeel is just as pleasing as the rest of this brew. Smooth, full-bodied, and sticky. A damn dessert to be slowly sipped and thoroughly enjoyed.  Between the two brews, I prefer this one fresh. Don't get me wrong, both are amazing and a year adds some pleasant changes to the brew but the coffee has faded since the early spring '10 release. Both acquire the features that i seek out when looking for an Imperial Stout. BOOM!",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,96

On the nose there are notes of dark chocolate fudge, freshly roasted coffee beans, deep piney hops, with a slightly warming sensation. In the mouth the dark roast coffee is in the forefront along with the hops, so there are two layers of bitterness. There is a bittersweet dark chocolate behind the bitterness and maybe some molasses to bring a little levity to a bitter party. The body is full and has an alcoholic drying quality. Not that it tastes boozy, but its presence is known. The finish is long with the bitterness and roasted malt outlasting all the other components.  Overall, this is a fine big stout, a steal at $6.99 a bomber, with no chinks in its armor.

This looks like the standard of an RIS, or in this case a IRS.  S- Very nice. Big time malt, chocolate, coffee, and some hops in the nose of this beer. Very well balanced and put together, nothing is out of whack here. Exactly what I'd want from this style. If the nose was slightly more pungent, I'd give it a 5 for sure.  T- Holy Crap! This is definitely one of the best RIS's I've had, if not THE best. I know it's young, and I haven't aged it at all- but this beer rocks my world... Wow. Everything is so well put together, I can't imagine improving anything- thus the rare 5 on taste. Bravo.

Very sweet, but nicely balanced by spicy hops.  Tastes of delectable roasted malts and dark chocolate. A mingle of coffee and anise to back it all up. The roastiness is unmatched as it lingers between each and every sip. Balanced out by a light bitterness that is not too overpowering or astringent.  Creamy and smooth mouthfeel with just enough viscosity. Not quite chewy, but it has appropriate thickness for the style. Good drinkability for such a rich beer. Slight alcohol burn at the end of each sip, but it's nowhere near astringent.  Overall this is a pretty much as good as it gets for an IRS.

Tastes of dark fruit, dark chocolate, earthy bitter hopps. Some alcohol comes through but not too much. A firm lingering hop bitterness on the finish. This is fairly balanced.  Mouthfeel is medium thin, kind of disappointing. Low carbonation as well. I'd like to have more body and less alcohol in this years batch of 2011.

I reviewed this year's bottle release last week and was happy to get to try it on tap so soon after. There were clearly noticeable differences. For one thing the taste was more grainy/malty and nutty. The mouthfeel was lighter, more dry, and rather moussey--less syrupy than the bottled version. The lovely stout roastiness was dominant, of course; but overall, I'd say the taste was slightly weaker.

147,1160,Smakawhat,3.46,"Poured from the bottle into a large snifter, 2011 Classic Release.  A very large head and classic cocoa like light brown head is formed. Head has got some staying power. Body is a good dark nearly black super dark brown appearance of classic walnut. Very nice sheeny lacing that is spotty with a hint of legs. Very nice looking beer here.  First whiff and bouquet is a shock. That smell first is manure, earthy, and not in a pleasant this is great terroir way. This smells like (you know). Afterwards is a whisp of airy malt and roast but some dry spices. Earthy feeling subsides a bit, but the first whiff was not pleasant but seems to disappear in the background. Pouring more and opening it up brings back what I call ""the stench"".  Taste is odd. Salty. In fact it is EXTREMELY salty, with hints of roast and malt burnt character. Burnt char on the swallow and much taste of carbon as well. Body is a little wet which is surprising for the high ABV. More sips lets the salty jerky meat quality subside, bringing out this bigger carbon like palate.  This is quite a disappointment but it's so far the biggest char tasting Russian Imperial I've had to date. However, it seems like I've had so many better ones before I just can't see what the big deal is. Where's the variety? Where's the punch? Where's the body? Where is that so called angry Stone kick?

S: Huge dark chocolate, espresso, caramel (almost like licorice, almost), a sort of vinous or dark fruit like aroma in the background, some of which is likely from the remaining hop presence.  T: Follows the nose with an absolute ton of roasted malt. Dark chocolate and a combination of roasted and hop bitterness on the front of the tongue, lots of caramel (that licorice-like sweetness too) and malt depth in them middle of tongue. There's a tiny touch of dark fruits (dark oak cherry mostly) with a little alcohol presence at the back of the mouth in the finish. There is still a good bit of hop bitterness on the finish with lingering heavy roasted quality (borderline char).  M: Thick and chewy, though not quite BCBS thick. Smooth and creamy. Carbonation is a little bit on the high side for the style with more tingling through to the finish than I'd normally expect.  O: I had fairly lofty expectations going into this, but also realized that I shouldn't put it up against the BCBS of the world. I got what I expected, a very well crafted RIS with a lot of similarities to the Yeti. Huge chocolate, good amount of sweetness, a little alcohol warmth in the back of mouth, well balanced, no off flavors, and the hop presence is at a minimum at this point.

147,1160,zac16125,3.95,"2011 Classic Release 22 oz bomber poured into a pint glass  A: Pours an opaque, pitch-black with 2 and a half fingers width of dense khaki colored head. The head dissipated slowly to a thick film, which is present for most of the drink, but only leaves a small amount of lacing.  S: Strong aromas of espresso, and a campfire-esque smokiness. Roasted malts, and hints of vanilla and chocolate. Excellent aroma.  T: The first sip is packed with the smoky flavor that was present in the smell, as well as a strong spicy character, which I can’t identify and definitely didn’t expect. Roasted malts are certainly present, which is typical, however, the standard burnt and earthy malt flavors that dominate so many stouts aren’t as prevalent , so that, along with the aroma, make this beer unique. Espresso flavors are present, but not nearly as strong as the aroma, which is disappointing, and there are some mild hints of chocolate. This beer has the potential to be fantastic, however, the main problem was its inability to hide the high alcohol content. The alcohol was not necessarily overwhelming, but close to it, and although the roasted malt flavors came though, it seems like a lot of the subtle flavors and complexities couldn’t really be appreciated and were masked by the heavy, dominating alcohol characters.  M/D: Thick, almost chewy in the mouth. Pretty heavily carbonated for a RIS. Certainly a beer that has to be drank slowly, the main reason being the faster you drink it the more the alcohol characters dominate the flavor.  O: Overall, I’m not really sure how I feel about this beer. It looks good, smells great, and has very good flavors in the early initial and on the finish of the beer. Unfortunately, the majority of the drink is held hostage by the inability to hide the high ABV. It certainly doesn’t ruin the beer, but it does make a potentially excellent beer, simple good.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,96

147,1160,dantheman13,4.24,"2011 vintage.  A: Pours a black motor oil, very thick and black with zero light coming through. The head that forms from a decent pour is quite impressive. Its a good three fingers in my tulip glass. The color of the head is a deep, rich khaki color. Quite beautiful really. The head dissipated quickly down to about a half finger, which lingered throughout my sipping session.  S: Wow, what a beautiful smell on this beer. It smells like a cafe mocha, or a coffee house that has been grinding coffee along with chocolate. This aroma is rich straight off of the pour, and then the roasted aromas start to sneak up. I really dig the aroma on this IRS.  T: For a non-barrel aged IRS, this has a pleasant flavor. Lots of roasted and coffee notes when served chilled. As the beer warms, a well crafted roasted flavor appears. There is a little bit of a hop bite to this stout, perhaps more than other IRS's I have had. The roasted notes and the slight bitterness linger in the mouth after drinking. There is a slight bit of sweetness at the front, but really this is a very dry IRS compared to some others. Still, there is little to no detection of alcohol until the beer warms up to room temperature.  M: Mouthfeel is good, but not as rich and creamy as I have had in other IRS's, particularly barrel aged ones. Perhaps some aging (in the bottle) would improve this. Still, the beer coats the tongue nicely, just not as well as other beers that I have had. Perhaps the dryness of this beer should be appreciated for its own merit though.  O: This is an excellent IRS, and perhaps the best I have had that isn't barrel aged. The aroma is really something to experience, and really impressed me.

Everything was perfect until the taste. While it was quite enjoyable , it was a bit over the top, almost too much in the taste, too much of almost everything. That sort of deterred my overall rating of this beer. While it was so very good, it was somewhat less than I anticipated",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,96
147,1160,deleted_user_574223,4.15,This review is of the 2011 Stone I.R.S. I finally found the classic release here on Long Island after enduring the Belgo Anise onslaught.  This brew poured a rich dark brown/black with a thin caramel head that receded but never left.  The nose is rich in maltiness and has strong notes of espresso and cocoa.  The taste is nice and bold. The way a Russian imperial stout should be. This is what I was hoping for and didn't get out of the Belgo Anise. The roastiness slowly subsides to a nice subtle bitter finish.  The mouthfeel is nice and chewy and has good carbonation for an imperial stout.  Overall this is a delightful example of an imperial stout and I can only hope that I can find more then the three bottles I was able to find. Enjoy!!!,Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,96
147,1160,d4114,4.46,"IRS 2011 6-12-11  A- Pours very thick; Pitch black with a thick light brown head  S- Coffee, dark fruits, chocolate and alcohol; Very complex but very pungent  T- Really smooth; big coffee notes, chocolate, some vanilla and a pretty big sweetness in the back that you are left with. Good amount of bitterness in there to balance it out.  M- Full bodied but super smooth and creamy without being too heavy.  O- Smooth almost on a whiskey level ; Huge complex flavors, can't go wrong here.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,96
147,1160,mrkun,4.03,"A: Expected black with tan head.  S: Strong roasted malt character and coffee are present.  T: The taste follows the nose being dominated by roasted malts, also some coffee and chocolate. Coffee especially present in the finish.  M: Light carbonation with a medium body, fairly smooth, and minimal heat.  O: Another solid imperial stout from stone at a very attractive price point.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,96
147,1160,SundaySour,4.08,"A: Rich and dark with only a tiny, tiny rim of foam on the edge. It grapes could be dark brown, this would be the color of a brown grape wine.  S: Smell is initially a little off-putting, sort of like that rare coffee made from pre-digested coffee beans in that ""cat"" animal poop (yes, I've had that). So coffee and a little..earthy. Maybe like an espresso and some damp wood mixed together.  T: The taste is like peppered jerky; sweet and tangy with a smoky smell in the nose. There is no bitterness at all, just a nice meaty flavor. The finish reminds me a little bit of hot dogs cooked over a campfire. With the initial coffee smell, this is a ""cowboy"" campfire kind of beer. Me and my hoss Silver just had a three-course meal on the lone range, fo sho.  M: Nice and thick in the mouth, almost creamy. Not fizzy at all, but not the thickest or oiliest beer I've ever had.  O: This is a yummy beer. I thought it would be stronger because of the initial ""earthy"" smell, but the whole experience was like that magical gum in Willy Wonka that made Violet turn into a giant blueberry...What I'm trying to say was, this beer tastes like a series of good foods. Highly recommend.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,96
147,1160,beagle75,3.72,"Poured from a bomber into a tulip glass. 2010 vintage  A: Opaque black, with less than one finger of diminishing beige foam head. Scant lacing remains on the glass.  S: Roasted malt is aggressively positioned in the center of the smell, with hints of chocolate, wood smoke, and fruity pipe tobacco. No alcohol is detected.  T: Begins off-dry, with dynamic roast that shows off balanced coffee, wood smoke, anise, and dark fruit. Acidity peaks early, but then behaves. Earthiness persists through the middle as aromatic flavors lose a little traction, but a slight sweetness persists. The finish sees a drying trend, with some fairly intense herbaceous bitterness developing. No alcohol is detected.  M: Medium viscosity, acidic and warming on the palate, with moderate carbonation.  D/O: After North Coast's Old Rasputin, Stone's Spring seasonal imperial stout is one of the more common, approachable, and affordable renditions of the style available in the bottle. It offers the hallmark qualities of an imperial stout, but is doubly harsh on the palate due to acidity and booziness. At one year old this beer doesn't have the freshly-hopped qualities of a new bottle, but smoke and dark fruit are more pronounced.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,96
147,1160,Stretch270,4.2,"Served in a stone tulip glass from a 1pt 6fl oz bottle.  Appearance - coffee brown in as light as you could call the appearance of the beer. It has foamy colored head like the laatte you get at Starbucks  Smell - from the strength of the appearance I actually expected a stronger smell especially coming from Stone. the overall smell is alcoholic with some chocolate and coffee. You also get a strong sense of anise, even though this wasn't the anise version of their IRS.  Taste - the flavor is anything but light in the 2011 version. As with the smell, the anise, coffee and chocolate that is not out of the ordinary when it comes to IRS, certainly is not what stands out, but the strength of the flavors certainly does. It is strong and if that is not your style when it comes to stouts this one might not be for you. But if you are looking for a light stout then you might be looking for the wrong thing anyway,  Mouthfeel - heavy heavy heavy certainly would be the word i would use to describe to describe the mouthfeel. My tongue got q serious workout trying to hole the beer up in my mouth. That said, it is exactly what stone advertises.  Overall - I think this is a great example of what an IRS is supposed to be. It is dark, full of flavor especially from some serious malt, with a nice hint of anise tossed in for good measure. I am sure there are better IRS out there, but I haven't had them.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,96
147,1160,Franch,4.5,"well it's a big stout. shockingly drinkable for how big the stout is - clearing 10.5% ABV without a hint of being hot until it warms up a bit. it's lighter than a lot of russian imperial stouts i have had, but not too light as to be problematic. i have heard this stout be considered the ""benchmark"" for russian imperial stouts (in the same way samuel smith's oatmeal stout is for that kind of beer) and i can definitely see why.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,96

Truly amazing. Alcohol becomes more apparent as the beer warms up.

Nose has some sweet vanilla chocolate, dark roasted coffee, baking spices and roasted malt. Taste brings molasses, bitter coffee, dark roasted malt, bittersweet chocolate and almost a ytannic quality. Nice carbonation and the abv is not very noticeable but i do find this to be almost astrigent slightly hurting its performance at the finish.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,96
147,1160,slaphappysnark,3.76,"Opaque, black, with a short-lived golden-tan head. Not a ton of aroma, but I like what I get. Flavor is nice and roasty, with a dry and boozy, slightly bitter, finish. Light carbonation is just right.  Poured out of a bottle on a hot day, so not ideal glassware and pretty much went from too cold to too warm for me pretty quickly. Still definitely enjoyed and will track down again.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,96
147,1160,Klym,4.42,"Poured from a 750ml bottle into an oversized wine glass.  A: Pours a deep black with a darkest-of-purples shine that transitions into a medium, quickly fading, brown head. Definitely an enticing appearance for any lover of RIS.  S: Bitter dark chocolate, wet wood, black pepper, a hint of black licorice a slight tang haunting the overall character. Wonderfully aromatic and not a smell in it that doesn't remind me of something I love.  T: Distinct from the nose but equally pleasing. Touches of dark chocolate, barbecue sauce and black licorice all come forth from a background that I can only describe as a char more similar to the golden-browned underside of a delicious piece of pizza than a burnt piece of wood. Aftertaste is sweet and savory, fading gradually enough to give my mouth plenty of time to say a sad goodbye.  M: Truly excellent viscocity, making it feel like you're drinking silk. Carbonation may be a little lower than what would be optimal, but any deficiency in that department is overpowered by the awesomeness of the rest of the mouth feel.  O: Every time I have this beer it seems a little more special to me. So distinctly an RIS but also terribly unique and without any of the typical pitfalls of RIS. A drink I hope to revisit multiple times over years to come. Easily one of Stone's best contributions to any style.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,96
147,1160,Sensaray,4.59,"Pours full bubbly tan head with deep dark brown body. Head dissipates steadily and fairly quickly.  Coffee, chocolate and the anise aromas all come through clearly. Its sweet and somewhat bready kinda like sugar cookies at times. Good smell here. Hops a little.  Wow deliciously complex. Spiciness hits first, then the coffee appears, finishing well into a very tasty darker chocolate flavor that all mixes harmoniously into the finish. Some resiny fruit is here too, like light raisinets with coffee. The finish has some hoppiness to it. Good spiciness throughout. Chocolate&gt;coffee  Smooth heavy bodied feel. Alcohol never bothersome. Spicy yet sweet but balanced.  Excellent beer. Just like most other Stone brews.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,96
147,1160,Cavery,4.3,"2011 750ml bottle into an Oversized Wine Glass.  A: dark bubbles rest soundly on the plateau of black ink. Rick James would concur with calling this beer the darkness. Makes me want to grab my quill pen and write on parchment. Always a good sign with an IRS.  S: droplets of vanilla extract on salted meats, prepared with a crust of some decent ground coffee. The alcohol makes you think you're smelling too much vanilla, but then the bitter coco powder reminds you that this is a brewski. A chain reaction occurs: Nose tells brain to sip.  T: The first sip of toffee eventually coats the mouth in compounding layers of chocolate melting over an open fire. your brain decides that this chocolate needs a pairing: the beer replies with creamy coffee. Chocolate is the star here though, and the coffee accepts its role as sidekick. Chocolate Batman, Coffee Robin. They battle to hold down the salty Carmel vanillain. Much goes on in this glass of Gotham.  M: Carbonation is low, but it's there. It feels very light in the mouth, and it's unexpected considering the amount of flavor. It's a deceptive mouthfeel (the work of the vanillain, no doubt). The beer looks so dark and tastes so big, you expect it to be like motor oil in your mouth. However, it is silky and delicate. It begs to be swallowed on contact, and leaves specter of carbonation.  O: Stone Brewing does impress me here, the thought that this was going to disappear in the ""odd"" year release of the belgo version makes me teary eyed. This is way too good to be gone for extended period of time. I would say of their many offerings, this has got to be one of the biggest ships in their fleet. Barrel aged variations of this boat could yield a whale for many years to come. Highly enjoyable IRS with a drinkability that is taste driven. Impressive and worthy of revisits. be sure to check the bottle to remind yourself this is a 10.5% ABV beverage. it's there, don't deny it.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,96

147,1160,stupac2,4.18,"This year's brew, poured into a snifter. Pours an oily black with 3 fingers of chocolate brown head. Smells like an RIS, I don't really pick up anything novel, but that might be my weak sense of smell. The taste is solid, dark and malty, with hints of chocolate and coffee. Though the high ABV doesn't initially present itself, it makes itself known on the finish, leaving a tingling warmness in my mouth and throat. All in all a solid RIS.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,96
147,1160,Ryan011235,4.42,"Poured into an E&J Cask & Cream glass on 6/12/11  2009 vintage  Pours brown, quickly arriving at a not-quite-black hue once in the glass (a faint swath of light is able to pass through around the stem). 1/2 inch hot chocolate colored foam. The head thins to a skim but bunches up, leaving a decent ring and some lace.  The nose is loaded with chocolate tidings: dark chocolate fudge, brownie batter, powdery cocoa. My first impression was that it smelled really sweet; however, it opens up quick enough that further layers become more distinct. Molasses and coffee beans. A mild roastiness drifts about. Does not at all smell boozy.  The flavors progress differently. Molasses and hints of earth give way to a decent amount of roast. Dark chocolate goes back and forth between sweet and bitter, occasionally finding a perfect medium along the way. Nevertheless, the beer flies in the face of the sweetness I initially assumed from the aroma. Indeed, it gets a bit roastier (and a tad burnt - even more to my liking) as it warms. Dry, roasted coffee notes carry the finish.  Full bodied, boasting an appropriate viscosity without going overboard. Carbonation is a bit higher than I prefer but it's the fluffy sort and stacks up pretty well with the overall feel of the beer so I oughtn't complain too much. Alcohol is well-hidden; not hot though a warming sensation lingers.  Stone IRS succeeds as a bold, assertive example of the style, all the while exhibiting class. It's excellently constructed and maintains composure throughout. Ages well, too; righteous.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,96
147,1160,matttttYCE,4.12,"2011 vintage 22oz bottle poured into my wonderful Stone IRS specialty tulip glass that I waited to use until I got IRS this year.  Appearance - Pours a nice motor oil black with almost two fingers of medium brown head where the bubbles are pretty creamy, diminishing but not completely, and they leave a little lace. After thinking it over, I can't recall the last time I had a wonderful RIS with such a large, beautiful, appealing head. For that, I have to edit and give it a 4.0. Very nice!  Smell - Smells like Czarist Russia! No but really, it smells of wonderful, dark, roasted malt, dark, bitter chocolate and coffee (actually a very good amount of coffee in the there), some vanilla, some fig or other dark fruit smell, notes of black star anise, and a bit of hops bringing up the rear. Not quite perfect 5.0, but damn close. 4.5! Probably only thing that could've made this smell better for me would have been if it were aged in Bourbon barrels! No hint of booze in the nose whatsoever!  Taste - Sweet, slightly boozy RIS bliss. At first it's sweet dark malts and roasted qualities, with the same dark chocolate and coffee (less so in the taste than the nose suggested to me), then you get some of the wonderful nuances like vanilla, molasses, toffee, and some burnt brown sugar and hops. I have to note, I burped and the hop taste that came up was almost like a mix between what I'd expect from their IPA mixed with their Smoked Porter or from a fresh Sublimely Self Righteous. All in all, a very good RIS! I can't quite say it's the best I've had or that it's as good as the 09 version I had (multiple times) a Beer Fest here, but it is very good. Definitely going to get a number of these to see how they age over the years.  Mouthfeel - Like a thinner motor oil. Really just thinly viscous with light-medium carbonation and a light-medium body. Actually felt like the mouthfeel overall was too thin for an RIS. So a little bit of a downgrade there. Finish is actually pretty quick and leaves the mouth just about as wet as it 'normally' is. Leaves just a hint of flavors coated around the mouth to make you want another sip of the goodness. After thinking it over, this really is more of a 4.0 in the mouthfeel. It could be a little bit thicker for an RIS, but other than that it really does deserve a 4.0.  Overall - The back of the bottle notes that there was no sin in making this brew. If that's true, I'll eat the gargoyles old little star hat and you can call me an angel for enjoying this one! Frankly, I'd love to get my hands on some older vintages to see how they are holding up. With that said, I have no problem enjoying this brew in early June here, where it's in the low 100s pretty much every day now. Wonderful. I'm absolutely kicking myself for not buying any of the 2010 last year shortly after I turned 21. I thought ""Oh it should be there for a while"" as I tried many other beers and made mix 6 packs of stuff. Went to the stores I frequent not a couple weeks later when I started my 'cellar' and thought I could handle a big RIS, and it was alll gone to my dissapointment. Bottom line, TRY THIS BREW, CELLAR AT LEAST 2!",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,96
147,1160,BigB415,4.46,"Finally my local Bevmo got the regular RIS and belgo RIS and I was able to pick up 2 of each. I've been waiting for this since having last years and falling in love with it and now I'm really into stouts and it's even better.  A: Pours pitch black into my Stone RIS tulip with brown head. No light shines through. Heavy lacing but it dissipates quickly.  S: Coffee, alcohol, chocolate. The alcohol smell actually burns my nostrils but it's ok, I forgive it since the beer is so great.  T: Cocoa, alcohol burn. More coffee.  MF: After the alcohol burn wears off I get cocoa that stuck around after taking a sip.  O: I think this is definitely worth the wait from the last years batch. I've been suggesting this to customers at my job and they've been buying it. It's a great stout for $5.99 so thank you Stone for not price gouging. I just threw another one into the cellar so I can't wait to see how it improves down the line.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,96
147,1160,ChaseT,4.03,Poured into a Spiegelau Stemmed Pilsner glass.  Appearance: Excellent. Black with a brown head that stays around and coats the glass.  Smell: Huge amount of roastiness with hops hiding in the background.  Taste: The hops and roasted malts hit you with a one-two punch.  Mouthfeel: Syrupy goodness.  Overall: Quite an interesting take on the RIS style. Roasted malts backed with a huge amount of hops.,Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,96
147,1160,mavbrew,4.2,"A: Color is a deep, dark brown with a finger thick, light tan head that slowly dissipates and leaves slight lacing.  S: There is a strong coffee scent with roasted notes following. Slight bits of caramel are present as well, but barely noticeable with the coffee and roasted notes. There is also a booze smell present, but very faint.  T: The taste is much like the smell. There is a strong presence of coffee upfront followed with strong roasted characteristics that leave a charred flavor throughout. The finish is dry and has a sweetness to it.  M: Medium to full bodied with slightly tingly carbonation. Feel is roasted and coffee-like.  D: This is a solid overall beer, a lot of hype surrounding it but it lives up to it for the most part. It's different from the ordinary RIS but I wouldn't expect anything less from Stone.

S: Starts off somewhat muted, improves greatly upon warming. Roasted malts, dark fruits (fig mostly), vanilla, dark/baker's chocolate, molasses, maybe a hint of coffee.  T: Nice bitterness upfront, more roasted malts with some vanilla & dark, bitter chocolate on the finish. Alcohol is very well masked.  M: Medium-heavy, good carbonation. Finish is a little dry/chalky for my liking. Quite possibly this is typical for the style, my experience with RIS's is pretty limited.  Overall, another solid offering from Stone.

T - Totally matches the smell. Coffee and chocolate malts, Almost has a woodsey aftertaste. No hint of alcohol, which is suprising for 10.5%  M - Actually has a medium heavy mouthfeel.

147,1160,cb462,3.63,"2011 bottle poured into a Spiegelau snifter, to be shared with myself. I drink by myself on Wednesday nights. Whatever. I am a little stuffed up from allergies, so I will most likely come back to re-review this in the future, but for now...  A: Pours dark as night with a full 1"" fluffy caramel head, which dissipates to a nice thin layer. Decent lacing.  S: Roasted malt dominant, booze soaked dark fruit, just a tad of dark bakers chocolate. Again, my nose is pretty stuffed, but this is fairly alcohol dominant.  T: Booze soaked figs (dark fruits in general) are the key player, roasted malt, light bitter (dark) chocolate notes. A bit subdued (again with the stuffed nose), but overall enjoyable.  M: A bit thin for my liking, especially with how hot it is. Carbonation is fine.  O: Overall, enjoyable. I consider it to be a slightly above average IRS, but considering the price point and availability, it is worth grabbing several of these and revisiting every 6 months to a year to see how they develop. There have been far better batches of this in the past, but with Stone's rapid expansion, it only makes sense that the quality of there beer suffers a little.

147,1160,UnknownKoger,4.33,"Been waiting for this release. 2011 regular version poured into my Celebrator Doppelbock glass. The smell is actually not as chocolately, roasty, coffee-y as I thought it would be. It's actually slightly subdued  Pour is black, as would be expected, with a thin brown head. The head quickly dies to a thin ring. And the taste? Delicious. It's not nearly as boozy as I thought it would be, considering it's 10.5%. Taste is very subtle; slight chocolate notes but no overwhelming coffee or roasted barley notes. Maybe I need to let this warm up more. Regardless, it is very drinkable and delicious.  Considering how big this beer is, it has a very nice mouthfeel with a nice aftertaste. Delicious. Overall, this is still one of my favorite beers, though I think it had a stronger taste in previous years. Can't wait to see how this ages and develops.

147,1160,The3rdbeer,4.23,"2011 bottle: Poured as usual in my Bruery Tulip 2 and a half fingers of dark moca head, the darkest I've seen on a beer yet!  A- Dark as ever, with a beautiful head that lasts for a less than a minute to leave with a foamy lacing that layers on the glass after each sip.  S- Roasted Malt! once swirled you get some hops, some smoke maybe a little bacon, some dark chocolate almost coffee notes, just burnt dark resin.  T- The taste starts with a hint of hoppy bitterness and a fore ground of roasted malt, it rolls down the tongue to splash at the throat to reveal booze and that malty coating, leaving a after taste of burnt brown sugar, dark chocolate, maybe some coffee, no smoke in the flavor unfortunately.  M- Not the mouth feel I would like, I want it thicker, but its not bad just lacking in my opinion, medium mouth feel that coats the mouth, it has a lite carbonation but its fitting.  O- Amazing beer, I'm tasting the Anise Belgo RIS tomorrow and I'm thrilled with the new bottle design on the 2011 and on the flavor as usual, exciting to compair the two, want to blend with a Mikkeller Beer Geek Breakfast. Gonna buy much more of this to store!  Cheers",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,96
147,1160,SkunkWorks,4.42,"22 oz bottle from the 2011 vintage, poured into a snifter.  Look: black body with a thin, light tan head that doesn't retain for very long and doesn't leave much lacing. When its closer to a light, it looks closer to brown than black. Some brownish, reddish highlights at the edges. Looks good.  Smell: heavy in roasted malt aromas, chocolate, fudge, a little coffee and some alcohol soaked currants. Smells quite good and inviting.  Taste: chocolate stands out, with some espresso, a bit of currant and anise, with a bit of bitterness that seems to come more from the roasted malt than the hops. My mouth tastes like I've been eating chocolate cake after drinking this beer. The alcohol is there but oddly subtle, especially considering how fresh this beer is.  Feel: full bodied, a little chewy but thinner than I remember this beer being, not much carbonation, which is fine for the style. Its a sipper, more because you want to savor it than because its hard to drink.  Overall: I haven't had this beer for a few years and my palate has developed quite a bit since I last drank it, but I am glad to see I still think it is delicious. I am looking forward to the two bottles of this vintage I am cellaring. Delicious beer and another hit by Stone. I should also note that the price only adds to how great this beer is. At 7.99 for a bomber in a market where you should expect to spend over 10 for a bomber of anything and much more for an imperial stout, this is an amazing deal.

147,1160,andrewinski1,3.68,Poured into a tulip. Nice pitch black color. The head is light tan and leaves a good amount of lacing that's moderately sticky.  The aroma has nice chocolatey notes with a bit of molasses and vanilla. There isn't much coffee in the aroma; mostly sweet malt in the smell.  The taste starts out with mild bitterness from the roasted malts. The creaminess of the carbonation. Chocolate and licorice are prominent flavors. Nice slightly bitter finish. The body is nice and medium to full.  The creaminess in the mouthfeel makes this a winner. Good flavors all around though. I will definitely get this again.,Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,96
147,1160,nataku00,4.18,"A 2011 bomber poured into a tulip. Pitch black, with no light getting through the beer even at the edges, with a half a finger of frothy light brown colored head. Many small bubbles in the head, and is all that is left along the collar when the head dissipates quickly. Light lacing on the glass that slides right back into the beer after a few seconds. From swirling lightly, there's a cascade of carbonation near the surface as the beer swooshes around.  Nose is heavy roasted malt, milk chocolate, espresso, and a little lactic acid tang. The roasted malt really jumps out of the glass though, especially as it warms to room temperature.  Taste is malt driven, dark roasted and charred malt bitterness, chocolate malts, and a dark roast that has espresso qualities. The charred quality does have a bit of lactic sourness as it warms in your mouth. For such a big stout, the alcohol is very well hidden while it is fresh. The dark roasted malt and espresso lingers lightly on the tongue after swallowing, though not as bracingly charred as initial taste.  Full body, slick and oily with a bit too much prickly carbonation on the tongue. Drinks pretty good right now and is a great value for such a big beer at less than six bucks for a bomber. I think some of the burnt and char notes should smooth out with some age.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,96
147,1160,ExplosivoSR,4.77,"2010 poured into snifter  A – Midnight black. Held up to light it shows just the slightest bit of light penetration. 1 finger of tan head dissipates rather quickly into a thin layer. No lacing  S – Chocolate, roasted malts, espresso, slight bourbon as well.  T – A ton of espresso up front, with the chocolate on the back end. Slight booze finish, with the malts and chocolate showing up again. Flavor lasts forever.  M – Chewy, but a bit thinner than expected. Not too much carbonation.  O – Very well balanced, with great flavors. A real gem.

Disappears to form just a ghostly shadow of foam on the top. Really ominous.  S rich chocolate and espresso with a hint of spice....nutmeg?  T dark chocolate with a drying finish. This might be my favorite vintage of IRS  M thick, chewy, espresso  O one of the best IRS ever. Couldn't have more than a couple.  Must have top 10 beer of all time. Awesome.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,96
147,1160,Scotchboy,4.18,"2011 version w/ new label. 22oz poured into a snifter.  A: Black as all get out, good alcohol feet, mocha colored head and lacing is pretty good. Textbook stout.  S: More muted than I would have liked, but there is still a good amount of roasted malt presence and maybe a bit of smoky wood. Behind that is some malt sweetness and a bit of earthy hop presence.  T: Dark malts, dark bitter chocolate mixed with coffee, woodiness, some sweetness and bitter hops. A good balance in my opinion, and spot on for a RIS; too many offerings sway too far to one side or the other.  MF: Very good, medium to full with a slick/oily feel. Nice carbonation and slight lingering bitterness followed by dryness. Makes you thirsty for more.  O: Good offering, Stone's dialed this one in. I could drink this a couple times a week, even here in summer.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,96
147,1160,azdback,4.73,"Stopped by the bottle shop on the way home from work today and low and behold we finally got the 2011, newly labeled, IRS. I wasn't expecting this for another week or two. I will buy many of these and cellar most of them, but I really wanted my review of IRS to be a fresh bottle.  Poured into my Stone Imperial glass. This is so thick there is no ""glup, glup"" in the pour. I don't mean to sound cliche but... really. Black color with black highlight and I think the black highlights, have black highlights. Head is a grand three fingers of super soft, root beer float looking, dark brown colored delight. The head subsided after quite a few minutes and leaves a beautiful sticky lace.  Smell is so roasted!! Burnt coffee, bitter dark chocolate, even some charred wood smells. I also easily pick out boozy smells.  Taste is so goddamn fantastic. This is pretty complex and must be broken down by regions of the tongue. The first taste that my (poor over worked) tongue tastes is the sweet of chocolate, but that is quickly overcome by dark roasted coffee and then some bitterness from the freshness of the hops, now after that I get just a bit of tartness, that is still sweet, like maybe a maraschino cherry. The throat at the end of this gets an alcohol fireball.  The mouth is simply fantastic. This is an Imperial Russian that has been in the bottle for maybe a month and is as smooth and rich as anyone in the style. Chewy is definitely an adjective that comes to mind when I swallow this fantastic rendition of the style.  Overall I must say that I feel very lucky to live on the West side of the country and have pretty easy access to this. I have '10 in my fridge and will cellar quite a few of these so maybe I can have some friends over and do some type of a vertical some day. I like this one as it is, but I'm sure it will change for the better, with age, like the rest of the vintages.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,96

S - Tons of espresso and chocolate in this one. A bit of that oaky-burn that comes with a good imperial. Also reveals notes of dark raisin.  T - A great espresso taste--not burnt coffee but as if you're taking a fresh shot of espresso. Notes of bourbon, oak, with some bitter baker's chocolate. Delicious, full taste.  M - Very thick and viscous, mouthfeel has a decent amount of burn from the alcohol, leaves a lot of stickiness.  Overall - Simply delicious. A beacon of RIS.

147,1160,jazzmanblue,4.53,"I purchased six 22oz bottles at a local distributor. I am sipping on the last of the six as I write.  Poured from a 22oz bottle into my Stone Imperial Russian Stout goblet.  The brew pours dark and heavy, giving off a firm tan head about and inch high, which lingers on the edges very well. Held to the light, it is dark as night. Exceptionally pleasing to the eye.  The smell is rich and unique. The pleasingly bitter edge come right to the nose, and carries subtle chocolate notes along for the ride.  The flavor comes in layers, all very deep and leaving a mild, satisfying bitter on the tongue to let you know it was there.  Carbonation is just right, light enough to enhance the flavor and not be in the way. Just what it needs to be.  I am not given to drinking stouts, but this is exceptional. The new batch for 2011 has just been released, and I'm looking forward to purchasing another half dozen for the appropriate moments.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,96
147,1160,DrDemento456,4.7,"Vintage 2008 ABV 10.8% A - Looks very impressive. The Dark viscous liquid pours where no light can escape. A nice half inch of dark mocha head. Held up very well this one.  S - Smell that caught my nose first was chocolate which I love on the back end some roasty smells and dark candy plums. Maybe a slight touch on anise as well.  T - Definitely hit it's peak since the body is creamy and the ABV is so balanced. Flavors of bitter sweet bakers chocolate collide with roasted malts and fruits ever so sweet. The finish was subdued hops but balances all above flavors to cover the ABV. A fantastic experience.  M - Thick with a nice medium body for sure but I could see this being kind of heavy and hop forward new.  Overall to experience this again I would have to age another bottle but I kinda want to try this new so hopefully some local place has gotten a few bottle by now. A great beer on the top 100.  Vintage 2011 ABV 10.5% Poured about Cellar Temp  A - The carbonation is strong with this one! About two inches of tan frothy head that has a nice bit of lacing. Still is as black and as dark as ever.  S - Doesn't smell too ""in your face"" like the 2008 vintage but does have a sense of solid roast and chocolate. No detectable hop bitterness on the nose.  T - Wow this is a hoppy one. Very bitter hops kind of playing against the chocolate aspect (as expected for a beer this young) but it still pretty tasty. The roasty factor is there in the finish. Little to no dark fruit is apparent with the fresh batch.  M - Surprisingly it's still as smooth as ever as smooth as velvet cake.  Overall I will hold onto the other bottle I have for a bit since I know it drinks awesome after a few years. Will try my best to keep it in the fridge till then, but for a hop forward RIS this is still one of the better ones I have had.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,96

A - roasted malt, big chocolate flavors that are very rich and dark. very aromatic and teasing in a good way.  T - Chocolatey and dark, maybe some very dark fruits or chocolate covered fruit, very rich and smooth but not as smooth as it can be. roasted malts again, decent hops...again comes back to the robust chocolate flavors that are very abundant. minimal heat if any.  M - alright we've got a full bodied beer that is a year away from its peak i think, pretty smooth, not quite the creaminess i feel it can put together, slight stabbing on the tongue in the back with a lingering finish. light to medium carbonation  O - this is a very good RI stout, i can't wait to have the 2011 version to compare it to,(editing had the fresh version 7/6/11 and the one year old makes it a stand out of the style 2years??) i feel like ill being getting a few of those to put away, getting back to the 2010, i feel like next year it will be amazing, and also with most stouts i enjoy vanilla hints that i wouldn't mind with this one, just sayin...other than that this one was awesome and i could of had the entire bottle no doubt.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,96

Great retention. This beer looks mean and inviting all at the same time.  This beer smells great. Roasted/burnt malt and dark chocolate dominate the nose along with fudge brownies and robust coffee.  The taste follows the nose to the T with a very welcomed addition of hoppiness in every sip. RICH dark chocolate, robust coffee, roasted malt and HOPS SON!! Not that I expect anything less from Stone. They really used their hop expertise to the fullest on this one.  Medium full body, would have liked to have a little bit more body on this one. Extremely bitter hop/coffee drying aftertaste. Slaps the shit out of your taste buds with every sip.  This beer was great. Smooth, creamy, very chocolatey with good heat and bitter bitter hops and coffee. Be sure to have some mints handy after drinking this one.

147,1160,axeman9182,4.02,"2007 vintage, on tap at the Rattle n Hum and served in a tall, thin glass.  Stone IRS pours a solid and complete black, with a small bit of tan foam serving as a cap on the beer. There's also a bit of lacing down the sides of the glass. The nose is incredible, a near perfect blend of rich chocolate, sweet, dark fruits, and a touch of tobacco. That great balance is lost in the flavor thought as the herbal taste of tobacco, and a bit of wet cardboard oxidation become a bit too prominent in the flavor blend. Milk chocolate as well as plums and figs and the like are still present, but a bit more subdued. There's also an unexpected but welcome espresso flourish to close things out. The mouthfeel is porbably the low point of this beer, as the body is too thin, and crosses the line into watery. At the same time, the beer is a bit undercarbonated. I've had experiences with less aged versions of Stone IRS in the past that I enjoyed a little bit more than this one, 2007's batch may have already peaked.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,96
147,1160,CFHMagnet,4.32,"A. Poured a nice black glass of beer. Pour was a little aggressive, resulting in 2 and 1/2 fingers of frothy head which took it's time dissipating.  S. The smell was absolutely great, I got coffee and chocolate, followed by pleasant dark fruits and a roasted malt.  T. The taste is almost reverse of the order of what I smell. I got a sweet dark fruit flavor that was quickly overtaken by a caramel malt. The coffee says hello quickly than turns over to a subdued chocolate flavor. Finhishes out with a pleasant bitter and a bit of alcohol.  M. This is a full bodied beer with decent carbonation. It definitely leaves my tongue coated and slightly sticky. There is a faint alcohol burn on the tail end.  O. The high ABV only hints its presence at the end of the tasting. It is not so pervasive that it turns you off to this nice beer. The flavors work very well with each other and create a beer that will keep the fan of this style happy.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,96

S - Coffee, chocolate, loads of roasted notes, some char, and some resiny, piny hops.  T - Chocolate, dark chocolate, bittersweet, roasted, toasted, burnt, sweetness, some anise, and only a hint of hops.  M - Thick and chewy, as usually.

Pours black as night with a medium tan head that left no lacing on my pint glass.  The aroma is dominated by the coffee, malts and chocolate with hints of sweetness.  The taste was exceptional, nearly exactly what I expected. Great balance of the flavors from the aroma that leave you wanting more.  The mouthfeel was exceptional as well. Its just an enjoyable beer to drink, completely coats your pallet but not super thick. Great balance of carbonation and alcohol, its very smooth. I would love to sit back and put down two bombers.

Aroma is absolutely loaded with dark fruits and roasted malts, with some sweet chocolate. The taste is very complex, with dark fruits interacting with roasted malts and chocolate in a big way. There's a susceptible hop character in the middle, with a very roasty and dry finish. Alcohol is apparent on a big gulp, but sips keep the alcohol hidden.  The mouthfeel is smooth at first, but the drying character at the end reveals a surprisingly high level of carbonation. It's also a bit thin for the taste and alcohol content. The drinkability is fairly good. Overall, this is a solid imperial stout.

147,1160,output01x,4.2,"Poured from a 22 oz. bottle (no date) into a snifter glass.  A vigorous pour yields a 1 1/2-finger tan-colored head that rests atop a pure black body with no traces of color when held to light. The head slowly recedes to a thin dusting and thick foam ring. Thick lacing coats the sides of the glass throughout consumption.  Mocha, caramel, dark chocolate, and roasted coffee beans aromas shoot out of the head. Silky and sexy, this beer is as straight-forward as it is delicious.  Dark chocolate and coffee beans flavors mix with notes of brown sugar and plums. The sweet flavors not only help to balance the dry chocolate and coffee flavors, but they add a layer of complexity many beers in this style lack.  Full bodied with decent carbonation, this beer coats your mouth well without being overly sticky. The great carbonation lends itself to an almost creaminess that allows for great drinkability without interfering with the flavors.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,96

Nose has some roasted malt qualities, dark chocolate, dark fruits (black currant, as the bottle suggests?), brown sugar and some vanilla sweetness. Taste has the sweet dark fruit initially, before the brown sugar and bitter chocolate come through along with some alcohol warmth. Slight burn in the throat comes with this. Great complexity within this, and balance between the components. Bitter roast in the finish which lingers immensely. Mouthfeel is ideal, as is the carbonation at a medium low level.

More or less this has everything you'd want in a benchmark RIS.  M - Full and creamy. If I were to have a taste now, I could still pull from the flavors 5 minutes later. This one lingers on the tongue in a very satisfiable way.  O - There is a reason that this is considered one of the best and most balanced RIS.

Retention is really good and lacing is good. Sexy looking beer.  S: Powdery cocoa is dominant in this brew. Lots of coconut. Not much of coffee TBH. Some dark fruits in this too with dried figs and dates, over ripe cherries and maybe a little bit of raspberries. One of the best smelling imperial stout I had, the smell just isn't really strong sadly.  T: Powdery cocoa and coconut. I have trouble explaining it otherwise. Really strong with these two. Real dark chocolate with a little bit of coffee (that wasn't in the smell). Strong with the dried figs and dates. A tiny bit of over ripe cherries and raspberries. Not super complex, but one of the best imperial stout in the world.  M: Heavy body but still very creamy and very smooth. Carbonation is medium to low.  O: What is there else to say? This is one of the best, if not the very best imperial stout I've ever had (tied with 6 month old Péché Mortel). Superbly drinkable.

147,1160,Shrews629,4.08,"Appearance - This beer is BLACK. Looks like motor oil. No light showing through even when held toward a light source. Tan colored creamy, smooth head with very nice size and real nice retention. Some good lacing too!!! Settles to a small bubbled film.  Smell - Medium robustness of coffee and dark chocolate. Roasty and toasty. Not burnt I didn't think. Some dark fruit. Raisin, but not real strong. A bit of smoke. Chocolate comes through more as it warms. Pretty well balanced.  Taste - Very rich dark chocolate. Bittersweet. A forceful tone of alcohol that is surprisingly not distracting, but rather invited. Roasted to almost burnt coffee grounds. A bit of licorice. A touch of warmth. Dark chocolate covered raisins. Nice medium bitterness. More rich and robust than the smell.  Mouthfeel - Thick, full mouthfeel. Smooth, slick, oily and dry. Covers the palate very well. Chewy. A bit of warmth is left on the palate. A slight ""bite"" of alcohol. Actually a little bit of a burn.  Another great brew from Stone. It's extremely thick, so this may not be the best choice for hot weather. Personally, I like it. Very good in all categories. Beautiful appearance and mouthfeel. Very solid with the aroam and flavor. Flavors and aroamas settled a bit after it warmed. Still well balanced and more than adequate for the style.

Taste is very complex and wonderful. There are flavors of coffee, chocolate, toffee, molasses, cranberries, licorice, prune, and a slight dash of citrus. Mouthfeel is thick like heavy cream, slightly drying feel in the back of my upper palate. This beer sneaks up on you like a tiger, and the alcohol kicks your butt.

The mouthfeel is very smooth and velvety; the alcohol presents a slight burn but nothing to scream about. I would compare this beverage to a tasty alcohol-tinged chocolate cake.

Nearly no lacing left behind on the glass.  S – Overwhelming level of roasted malts and caramel. A hint of coffee and alcohol are apparent.  T – The complexity of malts is interesting. First sweet roasted malts that are a bit nutty come through. This gives way to a nice bitterness similar to drinking espresso or eating dark chocolate that lingers on your palate. Some hops can be noted in the finish.  M – Heavy on the palate. Medium level of carbonation. There is also a fair amount of burn from the 10.5% alcohol.

T: Smoky dark chocolate notes are prevalent up front along with a roasted caramel malt flavour. A more subdued dark coffee taste in the background, with hints of licorice and vanilla. Warming alcohol is certainly there, but not the focal point. Lingering yet pleasant cocoa bitterness at the end. Overall beautifully balanced.  M: Perfect. Thick and creamy motor-oil, with slight carbonation.  D: This is one heck of a great beverage, from a brewery that certainly knows whats going on.

A nice mocha tan brown head bubbles up and sticks around for a little providing creamy rings of lacing.  Aroma: Something sour like a grape plays in the background along with dominant coffee/dark chocolate flavors. Also reeks of raisans and molasses. A rich brew egging you on to dive into the darkness.  Taste: Hop biterness hits the front of the tongue provided with a little smoke from the roasted malt. The biterness gets steam rolled by the smooth dark chocolate. Hints of coffee linger behind. The hotness from the booze is felt rolling down the back of the throat. Very well balanced brew. Also has hints of licorice too.  Mouthfeel: Creamy rich feel with good amount of biterness. Lower carbonation but the right amount for a RIS.  Overall: A perfect brew for a cold night or around the campfire. The alcohol sweeteness becomes dominating towards the end of the bomber but besides that its a well balanced, exceptional example of the style.

Pours a beautiful black, thick viscous liquid that leaves very pretty lacing on the glass due to the high alcohol content.  You really have to dive right in close with your nose to get any aromas but when you do its very sweet and satisfying.  When you sip it your are met with a complex range of roasted malts giving it a very subtle smokey/coffee flavour and then you are hit with an exceptional taste of sweet caramel and vanilla. This is a very well balanced brew and very well made.  I absolutely love this stout, and the next time i see it avaliable i will be stocking up on atleast a case.

147,1160,Auracom,4.2,"5-6 oz. tasting sample at Kelleher's in Peoria in a mini-pint glass. One of the on-tap offerings from the Stone release party on April 5th, 2011. Got a full serving of it in a goblet shortly after the flight tasting.  Ah, yes. Been looking forward to this one since I began my adventure here on BA.  Pours midnight black, completely opaque. Refuses to let any light get through to the other side. Doesn't appear oily or obnoxiously-thick. Minimal, mocha-colored head that was barely a half finger to start with and reduces down to a bare coating over the rest of the drink thereafter. Nice alcohol feet around the sides. Hardly any lacing to speak of.  The aroma is good. Not great, but good. Lots of dark chocolate and roasted notes... probably the most dark chocolate I've yet to pull out of any beer in this style. No hops or citrus detection, which I like. Maybe a little coffee, no real dark fruit. Just predominantly that awesome roasted chocolate character with good balance that isn't a complete aroma bomb.  This is fantastic beer to drink. The taste exemplifies that dark chocolate character to it's fullest throughout the entire length of the drink. Smooth, creamy sweetness at the front transitions beautifully to bitter cocoa beans at the back. Again, more roasted notes to complement the chocolate. Coffee undertone might contribute a bit towards the backend bitterness. Great aftertaste, long and quite dry finish.  It feel a bit chewy with a heavy body. Not milkshake heavy, but enough so to support the flavors. Extremely smooth. Appropriate carbonation.  Well done Stone. This is easily my favorite beer from this brewer so far. Zero alcohol detection in both aroma and taste. Balanced yet powerfully-flavorful. Not overbearing on the palate. Just a well-executed beer in every aspect.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,96

The head recedes *very* slowly, leaving a very thick lacing on the sides of the glass. After five minutes, I've only lost about 1/2 finger of head. Amazing retention.  Smell: Heavily roasted caramel-type malt dominates the nose in this particular batch. Medium-sweet chocolate and gentle coffee bean tones are also present, with just a touch of licorice and/or anise thrown in for good measure. A slight suggestion of purple fruit (raisins, plums, etc.). Just a touch pungent in the fruit area, but otherwise spot-on.  Taste: So much to taste here! A really intriguing combination. Bitterness hits first (hops/coffee). As the beer foams a bit, the sweetness is revealed (chocolate/cola/caramel). The alcohol is only mildly offensive, quite a feat for a beer boasting a 10.50% ABV. Aftertaste is a smooth bitterness akin to dark chocolate, with some alcohol flavor.  Mouthfeel: Beer enters smoothly, endures only a mild carbonation, and leaves just a slight, oily residue upon imbibing.  Overall: Nearly perfect...the last time I had this, I don't remember it being so pungent...perhaps I had better let the beer warm up a touch next time (it came out of the fridge...I usually cellar it for a while)...there may be another review of this soon.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,96
147,1160,ExtraStout,4.55,"This poured like used motor oil. It's just plain black, without an ounce of head aside from the small ring around the inside of the glass. It leaves a delicate and small lace as it goes down.  The taste is outright powerful, with a hint of licorice. The alcoholic content is certainly present, although not overwhelmingly so. All things considered, it's a well-balanced beer. I've had some imperial stouts lately that didn't quite live up to the name, but this one definitely does not come up short. In fact, it could almost be toned down a bit.  This is one big stout.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,96
147,1160,BobZ,3.95,"22 oz. Bottle poured into my Duvel Tulip. This is the 2010 release aged for one year.  Appearance: Very dark brown almost black. Little to no head both initially and throughout, mostly just a dark tan ring with minimal lacing.  Smell: Depth jumps out, again big chocolate first then big coffee.  Taste: Just like the nose with bitter dark chocolate is up front on this aged bottle, coffee mixes in nicely throughout the beer; and both flavors dominate. I find the dark chocolate flavor lingers pleasantly in the finish.  Mouth feel: Again very smooth but somewhat thin feeling on the palate, definitely thinner than other RIS's.  Overall: A very rich beer and I was glad to have the bomber but like Founder's breakfast stout it is nowhere near as delicious as the Belgian De Struise stouts.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,96
147,1160,BarryMFBurton,4.61,"First review, so bear with me. This is the first beer I've had that has literally compelled me to write something about it - it's that good.  A - Deep, dark, brown; almost opaque. Not a whole lot of head, but what's there is nice and creamy; some delicate lacing here and there.  S - Not really what I was expecting for a Stone brew. I had a feeling there would much more kick in this area, especially after sampling their Arrogant Bastard. Still, a couple of quick sniffs give a very mild offering of coffee and malted hops. Not bad at all.  T - Exquisite. First thing that hits you is the sweet: chocolate, malt. It instantly draws you in. Then it pummels you with the perfect blend of hops and alcohol; just bitter enough to leave you wanting more. This is an extremely well-crafted beer.  M - Not as creamy as most RIS's, or most stouts for that matter. While it's pretty different, the carbonation does add to the drinkability.  O - A phenomenal work of craftsmanship. I can honestly say that this is quickly becoming one of my absolute favorites. And for about $7 a pint, what's more to love?",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,96
147,1160,dragonWhale,4.36,"07 on tap at The Gate for the Stone event. Delicious and only $7/pint..Hells yes please. Angry and black it pours with a dark brown head, roast and alcohol dominate with some hop aroma, very faded, a little smoke, a little coffee. Very tasty, aromas a little faded, and a little surprising how dominant the alcohol still was in this one 3 years later. Damn good, and another reminder of the continued excellence of these SoCal cats.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,96
147,1160,JLeege,4.46,"2010 Vintage - Poured into a snifter  Appearance- Pours black with a dense two finger, tan head. Good retention, lots of lace left behind.  Smell- Dark chocolate, cocoa, light roasted coffee, a hint of maple syrup, dark fruit.  Taste- Sweet milky chocolate starts things off, with a bit of dried cocoa. Giving this almost a chocolate cake taste at the start. That leads into subtle hints of caramel and maple, and dark fruits, prune and currants mostly. There is a subtle spice in here too, the bottle says anise, so I will go with that. A little roast on the finish, light coffee and piney sided hops. Flavor lingers for just the right amount of time.  Mouthfeel- Velvety smooth. Perfect amount of carbonation, the ABV's go virtually unnoticed.  Overall- Great RIS, or should I say IRS. The nose is a bit muted but besides for that it is right on par with some of the best in the world. The cheaper price point for these bombers makes it a very attractive option.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,96

S - smelled of chocolate, burnt coffee, and some alcohol  T - first thought was very bitter coffee taste that gave way to an acidic taste. very warm feeling from the alcohol. got a little better as it came to room temp.  M - decent carbonation that gave a nice mouth feel  D - good for a stout, but seemed like it would benefit from a bit of aging. definitely a sipper in its current state. i couldn't finish this by myself. i will try an 09 bottle soon to see if aging will make a difference.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,96
147,1160,tewaris,4.07,"10.8% ABV; 90 IBU's Served in a 10 oz. tulip.  Signature RIS, this beer looks black, opaque, and shiny; boasting a one finger creamy dark tan head. The head retention is good and some lacing is seen on the glass as it gets empty. When the head subsides completely, very dark brown highlights reveal its true color.  I still have to have an RIS whose aroma will wow me, and Stone IRS is not that beer. Generic roast and sweet malts, pretty much. But the taste is a lot to my liking -- coffee, roast and acidity are alive here unlike the -bal version. A big beer that has notes of dark fruit and charred beans and a roasty, bittering and warming finish.  Great mouthfeel on this one, with very present but not overwhelming carbonation and good body. Just as good as any other RIS that I have had, and one of the most balanced ones: not too roasty, not too acidic, not too sweet, just right!

147,1160,beerandcycling88,4.8,"Had a 2010 vintage a few months ago so this is from my notes. poured from a 22 oz bomber into a snifter.  A This beer pours a very nice black color looks almost like motor oil with a nice brownish head.  S The nose of the beer is very rich with smells of coffee and chocolate being dominant, and with a hint of sweetness coming through.  T The best part of this beer. Upon drinking you are bombarded with chocolate and coffee with notes of caramel roastiness and alcohol. The chocolate is by far the dominant flavor though.  M This beer is so smooth and velvety it just goes right down but it still has a pleasing thickness that you want from a russian imperial stout.  Overall this is an amazing beer and a very good representative of the style, in addition to being one of my favorite beers of all time. Well worth having as this is truly a great beer.  A 2011 vintage poured from a bomber into a snifter  A This beer pours a very nice black color looks almost like motor oil with a nice tan head.  S The nose is rich with bitter dark chocolate, a hint of coffee, and some alcohol.  T When you drink this one you get notes of coco, caramel, coffee, and booze. Along with a roasted flavor.  M Goes down far to easily for being 10.5%. If it wasn't for an alcoholic warmth I wouldn't have any idea of the high abv.  Overall the 2011 is still just as good as the 2010, and it is still one of the best Russian Imperial Stouts you can find.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,96
147,1160,doopiedoopiedoo,4.45,"Got this bottle through my first trade with johnbjaeger. I was so very happy to get this. Thanks, John!  Spring 2010 release.  22oz bottle all to myself poured into a snifter.  It poured pitch black with a nice two finger light tan head. The head settles rather quickly leaving a nice coating on my glass.  Big nose. Wonderful smells. A light hint of wood smokes opens it all up. After that all the usual suspect in a RIS. Coffee, dark roasted malts and chocolate.  Bold flavors the nose hinted at are all present. Dark malts, coffee and chocolate and again that subtle hint of smoke. It all finishes with a fantastic aftertaste.  Creamy mouthfeel on a medium to full body and a good amount of carbonation. A wee bit of heat on the finsish. Flavors linger nicely.  One of the better ones in the style. It's good and almost great. The only things that comes to mind is that this beer is missing something that makes it stand out.

147,1160,FanofHefe,4.58,"Been wanting to try this for a while so was glad to find it on tap tonight. Served in a New Belgium chalice. Deep, dark, black body that lets no light through. Good one finger mocha head that actually sticks around for a while and leaves some lacing down the glass.  The aroma is a little less prominent than I had expected, but is solid nonetheless. I primarily note roasted malt followed with a little chocolate and coffee.  BUT, these flavors make up the difference. Near perfect combination of roasted malt, chocolate, coffee, and a sweet mix of molasses and toffee. Not too sweet, not too bitter, and nearly no notice of alcohol.  The mouthfeel is medium and silky smooth. Overall, a superior RIS.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,96

Taste - at first sip I get tons of semi-sweet chocolate. After a few sips it settles in to bitter chocolate up front with a semi- chocolate finish. A little more carbonation than I prefer but over all really well done.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,96
147,1160,Nesued,4.42,"Appearance - ""...to pour like Siberian crude"" is what Stone's website says about this beer. Well, now I know what to look for if I ever find myself ""crossing the snowfields"" in Siberia. Yes, pours a dark black, somewhat thick. A nice two-finger tan head formed that provided nice lacing on the pint glass as it faded.  Smell - The nose is fantastic. Big malty/roasty nose and some fruit qualities add to a lush bouquet. Some sweetness as well, but it takes a minor role.  Taste - This had four years on it in my cellar (ok...beer closet) to age. I will say it has matured nicely. Rich malty body, some vanilla notes. Mostly caramel, toffee bringing the depth of flavors to this party. Well done.  Mouthfeel - The carbonation is light to moderate. Nice finish with a ever so slight cleansing bite at the end. Not off-putting at all.  Drinkability - I have a newfound respect for Stone. This is a well-done beer. The density and complexity is worthy of it's ranking in the pantheon of ""Beers of Fame"".",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,96

S: Baked bread malt, roasted coffee, dark chocolate, molasses, black licorice, and a little nutmeg.  T: Pungent malty flavor with licorice, unsweetened chocolate, and a little spice.  M: Thick and syrupy. Robust body. High alcohol profile. Bittersweet in the front, and a pungent aftertaste that lingers.  D: Drink slowly and savor the greatness.  Atmosphere is really good.

147,1160,nhindian,3.86,"22oz bottle poured into a Stone Russian Imperial Stout tulip.  Spring 2010 release.  A - Pours a midnight black, a seriously foreboding beer, with a huge, foamy, 2.5-fingered head. A mixture of thin and thick bubbles reside at the edge of the glass after it dissipates. The lacing is fantastic as well with a nice, scattered coating sticking to the glass.  S - The aroma in this beer is as deep and complex as it looks. Roasted malts make up a bulk of the front of the nose, almost on the brink of being smokey. It even has a bit of fruits in it as well, slight raisins or currants. Besides the roast it is overall pretty sweet, which comes as a bit of a surprise.  T - Again, I'm getting quite a bit of sweetness from this beer in the taste. A strong roast starts the flavors off nicely, paving the way for some fruit and chocolate, which was absent from the nose. Overall it gives a bitter impression, perhaps slightly metallic. Alcohol is well-masked, only giving way to a slight warmth in the finish.  M - Mouthfeel is surprisingly light-bodied with moderate carbonation. It leaves a somewhat fruity and tannic residue on the palate.  D - Drinkability is moderately high. A solid RIS but nothing revolutionary. A bit on the thinner side of the style with a noticeable emphasis on the more fruity side of the taste. An interesting take, for sure, and a great beer for its availability and price.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,96

S - Lots of dark roast, bittersweet chocolate, dark roasted coffee, and some vanilla sweetness. Not as sweet and roasty as some of the others, more of a balanced nose.  T - Rich coffee, chocolate, and lots of dark roast mix well to form a well rounded stout. Finish is roasty, but not to the point of being overpowering, and it lingers for a good amount of time.

Nose is mainly roasted coffee and brown sugar malt with nice cocoa and dark chocolate notes. A hint of alcohol can be detected as well. Very rich and full bodied mouthfeel but not too heavy or syrupy. Carbonation is right where it needs to be for the style. Malty sweet on the palate with a slight hint of alcohol. Bittersweet chocolate throughout, with a coffee and cream finish. The hops aren't quite gone either, keeping it from being too sweet and malty. Very drinkable for such a big beer.

Some roasty bitterness. Finish is medium, boozy, alcohol burn with some roasted malt character.  Mouthfeel is a drying bitterness from grains, not hops, big chewy roasted malt character.

Escondido, CA 02-27-2011 Sunday Funday Growler Fills  (Aged 6 years at the brewery)  2005 Stone Imperial Russian Stout  A midnight black pour with a medium sized head of brown and frothy bubbles. The head is the darkest I've ever seen. A devilishly beautiful beer! Some sticking bubbles and dots of unmoving lace appear down the glass. If the devil brewed a beer, I'm sure this is what he'd have it look like: complete sin and decadence.  The aroma is pure malty goodness. I don't detect any hops but they would only get in the way of this sweet and rich treat. I smell chocolate, and coffee, and something I really want to describe as ""Red Vines Licorice."" The nose evolves as the beer warms, much like my experience with extraordinary quads and complex Belgian strong dark ales. I can now smell some charred fruits, namely figs, caramel, and wood. I keep returning to the pleasant licorice scent as it seems to become more and more apparent. Fantastic!  The taste is as interesting and varied as the nose. A smooth combination of roasted sweet malts, chocolate, a touch of coffee, and then an unusual and unexpected mix of charred dark fruits and an earthy woodiness I'm not oft to find in Russian Imperial Stouts. A bit of licorice but not nearly as much as I find in the nose. This beer seems to push the boundaries of what a RIS is and can be. With basically zero hop bitterness, all the complex flavors from the malts can shine through. I don't see how it could get better than this!  A medium to full bodied RIS with a moderate level of carbonation. I'm sure some has been lost over the 6 years of aging. I wish it was just a tad more luscious, creamy, and velvety. Although the mouthfeel certainly hasn't deterred me from putting this beer on a very, very high pedestal.  A remarkably drinkable and complex RIS. This beer does so many things so perfectly. A true marvel. Bravo!",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,96

147,1160,RossCain,3.44,"Poured from a 22oz bottle dated Spring 2010 into a snifter  A: Pours a deep, thick and viscous black with a small cocoa colored head. You can just tell from swirling the glass that this is a full bodied beer.  S: Deep roasted malts upfront mixed with notes of raisin and prunes. Unfortunately, there is an off-putting waft of soy in the back of the aroma which I just cannot wrap my head around.  T: Big, bold and robust notes of dark chocolate upfront with a big roasty malt profile. The flavor really punches you in the mouth in a thick and coating manner but it surprisingly finishes with a certain sweetness that slowly fades from the palate.  M: Thick, viscous, full bodied with the right amount of carbonation. A tad bit stressing on the palate after sipping for a while by the surprisingly smooth/sweet finish helps to balances things out. There is a certain warming character of the alcohol in the stomach but what else would you expect from a 10.5% brew?  D: Big and flavorful, this is certainly a tasty and well crafted brew. I couldn't imagine finishing more than a bottle and again that would likely be the only beer of the night. I was a tad disappointed by the character of soy that kept popping up in the aroma which put a damper of a sorts on the experience.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,96

I got a nice thick frothy head that was cappuccino colored. It was a bit slow forming too and I like beers that have that character. Color of the beer itself was like coffee or the darkest of chocolate. I only got a bit of color lightening around the edges when put up to a light.  This Stone was very aromatic that delighted my senses, having the aromas of cocoa, roasted malts, roasted coffee, and it also had a chocolate sweetness too.  Upon my first sip I immediately noticed that 10.5% ABV the beer has. Let me tell you after drinking it all I was ready for some sleep! After the initial alcohol taste came the coffee, malty sweetness and smoothness, and dark cocoa. I thought it would have a bit more flavor to it because of the impressive aroma but in all this was a good imperial Russian stout, being in-your-face.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,96

This comes with a two finger mocha colored head that does not last long. The lacing left behind is respectable.  Smell: The first whiff of this beer gives off a heavy scent of coffee, There are some hops as well but not much else.  Mouthfeel, the mouthfeel is medium bodied at first. As the beer warms up the mouthfeel becomes heavier much more pleasant! Also, as the beer warms up I feel a bit of tanance in the mouth.  Taste: This beer is sweet, At around 55degrees farenheit I notice a presence of caramel, hops, coffe and bitter chocolate. As the beer warms up I can also taste more malt and a pleasant breadiness.  Final thoughts: This is a great example of what an imperial stout can be. At under 8 dollars for a22 OZ bottle this beer is a steal. Imperial stout bombers are usually well over ten dollars. If SRIS was over ten dollars I would have to reconsider how much of it to consume, but at this price it is a joy to have this beer and feel like I have made a great purchase every time!!!",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,96

S - This beer smells amazingly well balanced if that makes sense. I am expecting this to be a very well done beer based on the aroma. Mostly dark chocolate and coffee. Some brown sugar and a bit of oatiness is present. An ever so slight alcohol aroma is also there.  T - Awesome!!! Very smooth and creamywith bittersweet chocolate and some high quality coffee flavors present, but its not like other RIS's that are mostly coffee forward. Some dark fruits, raisins and plums and an earthy flavor that reminds me of some oaked beers.  M: Smooth and creamy with perfect carbonation. There a very slight alcohol burn on the finish, but otherwise this one is perfect in this area.  D: The drinkability is quite amazing with this one. The 10.5% abv is not as well masked as some other RIS's but is very drinkable nonetheless.  I can only imagine what this could do with some age. I will definitely pick up a few of these to age and do a vertical. Easily one of the best RIS that I have had.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,96
147,1160,hosehead83,4.35,"Poured from a ""bomber"" bottle into a wine goblet. ""Limited Spring 2010 Release"" printed on bottle. Inky black, almost purple in color, with a short,stout head of tan foam. Aroma-A witches' brew of alcohol-soaked plums and cherries,dark roasted malt, and burnt coffee grounds. Taste-Thick, creamy melange of charred plums and dark fruit,dark roasted coffee grounds, black burnt toast, bakers' chocolate, and strong black coffee all swimming in a vodka-like, warming mouth-feel. This beer is not for a beginner. Sip slowly as you stare out at a bleak winter landscape...with hope that Spring is coming. Overall Stone RIS is thick and rich, with tons of character and flavor. It can be quite boozy if fresh, so ""hibernate"" one for a year or two and it should mellow out nicely. Best shared with a friend or family member in a sippin' glass or, for a ""knock-out"" treat, pour some over vanilla ice cream to cap off a nice meal. Yum!",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,96
147,1160,generallee,4.73,"Presentation: It was poured from a brown 1pt. 6oz bottle into a tulip glass. The label lists the abv at 10.5% and is dated as ""Limited Spring 2009 Release"".  Appearance: This is exactly what you want to see in an Imperial Stout. It has a very dark black body that blocks out all light. Floating on top is two fingers of thick tan head. This head has good retention and makes lots of lacing on the glass.  Smell: The aroma is boozy with a strong malt presence with notes of burnt toast, roasted grain, coffee and dark chocolate.  Taste/Palate: This full bodied beer has a big roasted toasted malty character with the mellow warmth of the alcohol reminding you to sip slowly and just enjoy. Foremost on the tongue are the bitter black chocolate, dark roasted grains and burnt coffee notes with some dark caramel and light molasses sweetness underneath. The mellow boozy abv creeps in and warms all the way to the finish. Its palate is heavy and viscose with just enough carbonation to keep things from getting sticky.  Notes: It's wonderfully complex and well rounded. Overall outstanding!!!",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,96

Nice and sticky lace clings to glass.  S - Nice flavorful aroma. Chocolate comes through the most. A little bitter chocolate. Sweet vanilla notes peek through. Roasted malts give nice end to the nose.  T - Like the nose flavors follow nicely. Bitter chocolate at first. Dark fruits and vanilla mixed in at the middle of the drink. Ends good with roasted malt, slight burnt coffee flavor. Everything balances well and gives good flavors all the way through.  M - Medium body with light carbonation.  D- Very drinkable RIS.

T: As with the nose, cocoa liqueur opens up with some dark berry sweetness differing slightly from other assorted dark fruits. The roast is not too heavy and works itself in more on the finish than blasting away with heavy char (I find that sometimes abrasive). Fading hop bitterness that is a bit on the earthy side but some piny residue as well.  M: Not as creamy as some RISs, but a velvety cushion intercedes between my tongue and where I believe the beer to lie. It floats heavily. Little perceived alcohol burn, but pleasantly so. It's good to know I""m drinking a big stout without being burned by the heat.  D: This is a wonderful anytime beer (assuming you like stouts at anytime as I do).

S: The aroma is still hoppy after just about a year. A tasty tinge of Anise. That and rich black strap molasses and dark chocolate covered caramel round off the aroma. Classic RIS and right on for the style.  T: The flavor leans towards the dark chocolate covered caramel, with a molasses backbone. Hops are evident, but no prevalent. Notes of anise mix with small notes of alcohol on the pallet, and on the finish. Again, a classic staple of an RIS.  MF: Mouthfeel....thick, full, and creamy.  D: Drinkability is great at 10.5%  Overall, Stone IRS is a staple that every brewer should base their RIS' off of. True to the style, and the American twist with the hops that every brewery is copying today.

Keeping in mind that I loved '09 I just don't think this one has it as much. It was rather sweet and boozy, again lacking the roasty flavours I love in IRS.  M - Was thinner then usual, still felt thick upon quaffing but faded to thin as it went down. Didn't have the slight creaminess I've had in the past.  D - I know there was controversy over the change this year to belgian yeast. Clearly they also changed the base recipe as well.

The head eventually dwindles down to about a one finger tan head. Great lacing that leaves huge gobs of foam stuck to the glass.  Strong roasted aroma up front. Dark roasted malts and some chocolate are prominent. Some coffee aromas as well as a slight hint of black licorice make their way through, along with a bit of alcohol. Aromas blend together very well and give it a very strong nose.  Very strong roasted, almost burnt flavor hit the tongue first. There are also slight coffee notes and a bit of the black licorice, but not a ton of either. The two flavors that really dominate are the roasted malt up front and a great dose of bitter chocolate at the finish. Maybe a hint of alcohol at the end as well, but not much.  Thicker body and lighter carbonation give the beer a very rich and creamy mouthfeel. A bit of bitterness from the strong chocolate flavor at the finish, but it's pleasant.  Dangerously drinkable beer for a stout of it's size. Obviously not a beer that is anything you would want to have multiple of but taking a couple hours to enjoy a bomber is very enjoyable.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,96

147,1160,glazeman,4.52,"A: This beer pours a dark, dark brown, though not quite black. It has a 1 finger cappuccino colored head that has moderate retention and moderate lacing.  S: Brown sugar, milk chocolate, a tad of coffee, and a tad of raisins make up the nose. The brown sugar and milk chocolate are the dominate players though with the coffee and raisins only adding a nuanced augmentation to the overall smell.  T: I can see why this is one of the most widely reviewed, widely respected RISs. The taste is well balanced, interesting, and overall excellent. There's some roastiness up front followed by a nicely balanced bittersweet chocolate taste mixed with some dark fruits. The aftertaste is of light coffee notes with a very faint alcohol burn. Perfect for a winter night.  M: The mouthfeel is quite good. This beer is not quite as thick as something like darklord, but it is by no means thin either. There is an appropriate level of carbonation and a great aftertaste.  D: This beer tastes great, is complex and interesting, and is wonderfully balanced.

A light vanilla note is there but takes a back seat to the dark fruits. 4  T- Nice mixture of flavors makes this delicious and complex. Up front i get a nice roasty malt with a dull fig sweetness. A nice warming alcohol taste makes its presence felt toward the middle along with slight bitterness. The back half of the taste is all darker fruits 4.5  M- Medium to heavy mouthfeel feels pretty on par for this style while it has a more than desired ammount of carbonation that i'd say is medium.

Just wish the alcohol wasn't so in your face. Finishes with a lot of chocolate  Mouthfeel is medium and oily. Wish it was a bit thicker and not as carbonated.

Hop bitterness definitely comes out more here than in the nose and nicely complements the rich malt backbone. Alcohol is barely evident, which greatly adds to the drinkability.

Initially, it's like sticking your nose in a fresh chunk of dark chocolate, then into a bag of roasted vanilla beans. A slight maltiness comes through as well.  Upon sipping, lots of spongy mouthfeel with lovely chocolate, dark sugar, roasty malts and a nice dry finish. Hops are almost undetectable, but the beer remains nicely balanced and never gets too sweet despite its flavors. Some very fleeting coffee notes dance around for a bit after the sip.

A slow pour reveals only an oily body at first, but a tan skim slowly emerges and eventualy becomes a dense 2-finger cap. Great retention with plentiful streaks of lacing that are alternately creamy and sticky.  Nose is chock full of cocoa and roasted malts. Vanilla and dark fruits are definitely background players. A little boozy.  Taste is intense. A hoppiness that went largely undetected in the nose snowballs throughout the swallow, ending up with a pungent piney bitterness that stops just short of scorching. Similarly, the mild chocolate aromas suddenly are blooming into a flavor reminiscent of fresh chocolate muffins. Burnt and roasted malts aplenty. The body is thick and smooth, yet does little to tame this beast. The warming booze is not at all out of place. Hints of vanilla weave in and out.

147,1160,sisuspeed,4.38,"2008 Vintage 10.8% ABV  Poured into a Foothills tasting glass. Starts out with about two fingers of foamy tan head and eventually reduces to just under a fingers-worth. Leaves a nice web of lacing down the glass. Body is black as night.  Chocolate, molasses, and light anise on the nose. Dark, roasty malts and a bit of vinous character lurk in the background. Seems a little more fruity, with less anise, than it does fresh. Alcohol is almost non-existent at this age.  The taste is great, like usual. Dark, somewhat bitter malts, with black currants and red grapes. A hint of faded coffee, but lots of smooth dark chocolate. A pinch of hop juice leaves just a bit of grassy bitterness on the finish, but for the most part, the hops have fallen out of the flavor. Almost starting to taste milkshake-like, and the alcohol has mellowed nicely. A touch of licorice, but not too much.  Mouthfeel is smooth and creamy. Low carbonation, but spot on for the style. Some warming alcohol, but much less than you would think. Almost perfect.  Drinkability is very good. This is a classic RIS along with Old Rasputin and a few others that are reasonably priced, easy to get and always tasty. With almost 3 years on this beer the heat has dropped out and the overall feel is super smooth. The flavors have melded together nicely, but may be slightly muted. I've still got another '08, and based on this one, I think this beer can still go a few more years. That being said, I'm not sure if I like an aged version of this beer anymore than I do fresh, but if you're looking for something that drinks a little more easily and isn't in your face with intense flavors, then definitely lay a few down for 2-3 years, or more.

Nice smells though, just not a shocker  Taste- A very good stout. The roast is there with a little faint coffee. Some decent booze flavor and the dryness leads to a nice finish  Mouth- A full bodied stout. Really well done with the low carb to match the body and give it the perfect balance.

147,1160,mwrecording,4.2,"Poured a typical black with a little bit more head than I've come to expected from bigger stouts. Smells like roasted chocolate/malt, smells great! I've gotten a different taste from this with almost every sip. Its some sort of combination of what you love in an RIS(or IRS?!)...bittersweet soft chocolate notes, roasted malty notes and a little bit of a boozy kick to it.  Mouthfeel - this is something that does make me say ""OH, this is why I'm not drinking an Old Raspy or Brooklyn BCS""...the mouthfeel here is thick and maybe slightly chewy. It adds to the beer, not detracts.  Drinkability - I guess if I really wanted to do I'd have more than one of these a night but it being a powerful bomber(and you can slightly taste the booze)...I don't know why I would.  Good beer and its the first Stone beer I've been impressed by.  Now that I've had 6-8 sips since typing this review...it has just gotten better and better.

The initial taste of the beer was that of dark chocolate, roasted caramel, roasted barley, lightly roasted coffee and a (go figure) roasty aftertaste with alcohol on the nose. This brew had a full body with light carbonation.  I have waited one year to try this beer. So upon finding this beer I was excited and boy did this beer not let me down. Fantastic!

A foamy, very dark brown head exists at first, slowly and menacingly fading to a thin ring. Spotty lace exists on the glass.  Smell: Burnt roasted malts, roast coffee, dark chocolate, molasses, and vanilla. A faint hint of alcohol in the background.  Taste: The best part about this beer is how well the flavors blend together. Heavily roasted malt and coffee blend together well to start. This is everything I want in a dark RIS and it is delicious. A touch of dark chocolate and vanilla, followed by a warming alcohol presence before some light earthy hops carry it home. A lingering coffee bitterness is the only thing I would like cleaned up a bit.  Mouthfeel: Not syrupy, a tough feat for a viscious stout. There is enough carbonation to keep it out of that range. Obviously full bodied, with medium carbonation. A bit sticky, and alcohol warms the stomach.  Drinkability: Ultimately smooth, and the flavors blend really well together. The only issue is really the strong coffee aftertaste. I will definitely look out for this every Spring.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,96

147,1160,birderbeerer,4.35,Pours near black with a tan head. No lace. The head retreats to the rim fairly quickly.  Smells of a rich roast with some malt sweetness. The alcohol comes through in the aroma as well.  Very evenly balanced. Strong roast with flavors of coffee and toffee and caramel. Drinks exceptionally smooth. Mellow but strong flavors. The carbonation and alcohol give it a slight bite.  Creamy. No one aspect of stouts (roast/richness/sweetness) overwhelms the others. Medium body.  Excellent beer.,Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,96

S: Decent, but I knew I wouldn't rate this as high as others as it hinted at that gagging molasses smell  T: Sure enough, a good solid brew, but like some others it has that molassses sickening sweetness to it..along with other flavors of course. Not as sickening as some of the Bell's stouts or S.A. I.R.S., but its still there.  M: Huge, deluxe, definite quality brew here D: Not very drinkable for me, I'm afraid  Overall, a high quality sipping brew. Just a tad too much of that molasses sweetness.

147,1160,oreo,4,"2004 Vintage poured on tap at Finnegan's Irish Pub in Plainfield IL  Poured a deep black with very little head.  Aroma was heavy on the dark fruit and booze.  This went down very smooth. I am not much a fan of dark fruit stouts, but this one was very good. Almost a syrup like texture with lots of roasty malt flavors with a lot of dark fruit. Some booze on the finish.  Easy drinking, but a sipper.  2005 Vintage poured on tap at Finnegan's Irish Pub in Plainfield IL  Pours a deep black with a half finger tan head.  Smells like dark fruits but with more booze than the 2004.  Deep roasty malts with a lot of dark fruit in the taste. A more harsh boozey flavor comes through on this one.  A better mouthfeel than the 04, syrupy but lighter.  Drinkable. Most certainly a sipper.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,96

Thin dark beige head fizzles to a few bubbles around the edges. Some stick  S - Big roasted malt, not doffee, then fig and leather. Faint hints of smoke.  T - Roast again, but not coffee, dark malts, some bitterness in the back, lots more dark fruits and a lingering dtyness. Very nice! Almost no sweetness just dry roast with touches of bitterness and alcohol  M - Much more full than the appearance would have you think. Low carb, perfect.  D - This is a great beer. Very complex but very easy to drink. You only get a hint of alcohol but it blends so well with the bitterness.  This lives up to the ratings its been getting for years. Very approachable yet complex.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,96
147,1160,zoso1967,4.57,"For all intents and purposes, this stout pours completely black and is opaque. It is capped off with a beautiful mocha head that has superb retention and slightly above average lace. If the artwork and marketing on the bottle were not enough, after pouring one of these bad boys you can tell it means business.  The aroma is wonderfully rich and complex with a solid molasses like sweet malt backbone that holds up a cornucopia of roasty and toasty treasures. Coffee, charred wood, smoke, burnt sugar, leather and a touch of anise all come out of this beer. One can also detect a bit of a sharpness that is probably a cross between roasty astringency, alcohol and some piney hops. This is one of those beers that every time you smell it you get something different.  The flavor is much like the aroma and possesses the same chameleon like tendency to change as you make your way through the glass. Coffee, smoke, leather, rich dark chocolate, soot and a punch of hoppy bitterness all make their way to my taste buds.  I would say that the body on this is not quite full, but it does have a very smooth and coating sort of texture. The finish can be a bit harsh as this beer warms, but given the crazy amount of roasted and bitter stuff going on in this brew, it is not bad at all.  This is a pretty darn drinkable American RIS, and it is no wonder it is so popular. While it is a big beer and I often end up drinking it quite slowly, I feel like I need to bump up the drinkability a bit because this is a beer that I seem to end up picking up from time to time because I know it will be an enjoyable drinking experience. This is a classic beer and highly recommended.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,96
147,1160,jds1469,4.56,"Not a perfect beer, but pretty good.  Purchased a 2009 bottle today and popped it open once I got home. The appearance was some of the best looking beer I have seen recently. HEAVY black color with a dark brown head. The beer sticks to the glass as you drink it very well and creates a nice lacing down the glass.  The taste is very bold, but not overpowering, sweet but not overly sweet. The flavors mesh together to well it is hard to pick out individual ingredients.  Mouthfeel is perfect. Has the feel of heavy cream almost but go away pretty quickly after a few seconds.  Of course the drinkability is a 4.9, but this is not an option so it deserves a 5.0.

A: Dark black with a creamy tan head that slides down the glass and leaves a beautiful lacing  S: Dark chocolate and coffee. a bit of alcohol scent.  A: bittersweet chocolate, coffee isn't as strong a flavor as it is on the nose. Dark fruits, raisings and plums maybe. A bit of earthy oak flavor. Very good balance but not perfec, a bit too sweet and not enough hops to get a 5 from me.  M: heavy, creamy, perfect carbonation slight alcohol warmth on the finish. honestly could not be any more perfect.  D: Quite good. 10.5%abv does not try to hide itself though.

147,1160,trecker,4.27,"Poured into a Stone IRS tulip.  Looked good. Dark black. Call me a rookie, but aren't most Russian Imperial Stouts basically the same black? Small amount of whitish tan head that fades to lacing.  Smells of a sweet chocolate but not overpowering.  Has a chocolate taste possibly with a little warmth.  Drinks very well for the 10.5%. I've had quite a few RIS's lately and this is definitely one of my favorites.

147,1160,BlackBearForge,4.35,"This RIS from Stone pours deep and dark with a creamy chocolate brown head that falls pretty quickly leaving leaving moderate amounts of thick oily lacing which slides down the glass.  The aroma smells frankly delicious, with deep dark roasted malts that bring to mind dark rich chocolate, bitter and sweet with coffee overtones and whiffs of alcohol.  Let this baby warm up before drinking! With warming the mouthfeel improves and the flavors of rich dark chocolate, roasted grains and nice hoppiness really pop out. There are flavors of dark orchard fruits like ripe plums, prunes and raisins but the main flavor to me is the bittersweet chocolate backed with roasted green coffee beans. The alcohol whiffs from the aroma are totally hidden in the flavor but for a pleasant warming on the palate.  Mouthfeel is full and creamy and silky smooth on the finish.  Drinkability, oh I could drink some more of these! An excellent RIS, a style I haven't been drinking lately but I think that's about to change for the rest of the season!",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,96

Well rounded. Nice a sweet but not overly so. Notes of chocolate syrup, roasted chocolate malts and coffee. Alcohol is noticible but not unpleasant. Extremely warming in the 28 degree chill.

147,1160,BarrytheBear,4.05,"2008 vintage poured multiple times into a small wine glass while watching Step Brothers at the cabin in the woods. There are few things better than spending consecutive contemplative winter evening next to a fire, drinking aged stouts, and watching movies. ""I tea bagged your drum set.""  Black with a crimson hell-fire edges and a reverse cascade of creamed coffee colored head that emerges from the center of the glass and then dives back below the murky surface.  Smells of berries and cream, or more specifically blackberries. Medium roast coffee joins midway through and leaves with a long dark chocolate bar finish. Very smooth and well integrated and much less hoppy than when fresh. Dark fruits wrap the chocolate finish.  Coats the mouth nicely and finishes prickly on the back of the tongue with a lingering bitterness. Booziness is kept mostly in check, especially considering I recall fresh bottles being quite hot. There is, however, a mild burn that reminds you of the abv. While time has mellowed this out substantially, I feel like some of the real pop of this stout has been lost. Enjoyable, but not quite what this was or could be.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,96

S: Plum, black currant, raisin, juicy black raspberries. Faint earthy and herbal hops with hints of pine and citrus. Subtle charcoal, baker's chocolate, and coffee beans. Spicy alcohol. A rather delicate, but highly complex nose.  T: An aggressive bite of bitter, earthy, resinous hops assaults the palate first, but quickly subsides and is pushed aside by the fruity esters. These esters boast a lot of depth, divulging tastes of plum, black currants, raspberries, figs, dates, and some vinous flavors. A strong spicy alcohol character rears its head, but is far from overpowering. Molasses and a nice charcoal impression ride alongside the esters and linger on into the finish. Dark chocolate and sweeter cocoa tastes come out intermittently. Finishes with coffee, hints of smoke, resinous hops, and vinous tastes.  M: Thick, syrupy, mouth coating, and silky smooth. Slight astringency. Alcohol warms the whole body.  D: Good, but definitely a sipper.  Notes: Excellent. Very true to style. Somewhat delicate in taste, but very complex.

147,1160,pburland23,4.08,"Poured from a 22 ounce bomber dated ""Limited Spring 2009 Release"" into my Great Divide Brussels glass.  Pours a beautiful deep, dark black. When held up to the light, the beer proves to be almost totally opaque. I see some tinges of dark brown. Pours about a finger of light brown head that quickly receded and did not leave any lacing. It's a beautiful pour.  Nose is strong on roasted malts, alcohol, dark coffee, and a touch of fruitiness that I'm having trouble placing...blackberries, perhaps?  This beer is intense in flavor. It hits you hard with roasted malts, a black currant flavor and an undeniable booziness. I find that the fruitiness and the alcohol overpower the malts and make for an uneven drinking experience.  This is a thick, viscous, full-bodied beer that's a definite sipper at 10.5%. Truth to be told, I was expecting a little more from Stone on this one. Russian Imperial Stout just seems a little misaligned and as I mentioned, it makes for an uneven drink.

The alcohol content is stronger then previous years so that might have something to do with it. Smells like chocolate (bittersweet), expresso, cherries, plums, lemon and booze. Very appealing. The taste matches the smeLl but is a bit heavy on the alcohol. It really overwhelms the palate. Naybe aging would do this years release some good. It would make sense too being that they are changing it up with Belgian Yeast next year. It's thick and heavy as always. I'll grab a few to cellar for sure.

147,1160,bucklemyshoe,4.28,"Notes from 12/09/2010:  22 oz. bottle at 48* into a Stone Imperial Russian Stout tulip/snifter.  A: This pours pitch black with a fingerful of very dark khaki head that leaves thick walls of clingy lace.  S: The nose shows more dark fruit aromas than most Imperial Stouts; it also shows notes of mild roastiness, dark chocolate, and some phenol esters.  T: Currants, figs, plums, and anise dominate the palate with lesser notes of roasty coffee, chocolate, and some bourbon.  M: It is creamy and mouth-watering but the body is much thinner than I had hoped.  D: This is a good Imperial Stout but I remember the '09 being better.  Edit -  2011 Version. 22 oz bottle into a Stone Imperial Russian Stout tulip/snifter.  A: Black as night with two fingers of very dark head.  S: Cocoa, anise, mild espresso, and toasty malts.  T: Very balanced: chcolate, espresso, tasty dark fruitiness, lactic cream, and a little char.  M: Medium-thick, a little creamy, and features some heat at the back end.

As it warms a mildly smokey, and more coffee aromas become apparent.  T - follows the nose. Tons of sweet chocolate balance the intensely bitter roasted malts and soft herbal hops. Lingering bitterness and some alcohol heat on the finish.  M - thick and viscous. But smooth almost slick. Decent level of carb.  D - nice RIS.

147,1160,haazer,4.66,"Poured into my oversized pint glass(22oz), perfect for bombers. Had it in the fridge for a while, and let sit for about 40 mins to warm.  A- Complete, utter darkness pours out from behind the gun smoke from the bottleneck of this beer. No other colors present. A thick billowing brown head develops at the top of the glass and refuses to move, until the carbonation underneath forces the darkness to rise. Leaves about one finger head retention, and lacing on the glass. Can't get much better.  S- A very good smelling RIS. Most of the aroma's have a roasty scent to them. Those aromas including, chocolate, coffee, caramel, peanut butter, and a fruity flavor which I can't identify, which I'll assume is the black currant.  T- I sat and sipped this for a good ten minutes swirling the brew around before making my notes. This takes you on a flavor journey. Flavors hit you in three waves. In the beginning is a delicious milk chocolate/caramel similar to that of a milky way. Next is a natural sugar fruit like sweetness, almost cherry in flavor from what I'm used to, but again must to the black currant making its presence known. At the end of this flavor pendulum is the usual guilty party of dry roasted malts. Then trailing that is the warm tingling sensation of the 10.5% abv, which is tiniest reminder of how big the beer your drinking is.  M- This beer to me can be drunk even with dry mouth. Such a smooth, rich and full bodied experience this is! Halfway through the bomber and the alcohol has not dried my palatte at all. This is what a stout should feel like. Creamy, chewy, and bready. Check, check, check.  D- My first offering from Stone, certainly not my last. Possibly the best stout I've ever had. I have been looking forward to trying this for awhile now and was not let down at all. I deffinitely would like to get a case of this in the future, and open one every 3-6 months like it suggests. Dont believe the line on the bottle ""we guarantee that no sin was committed in the production of this seemingly pernicious brew"", Stone deffinitely struck a deal with the devil on this one.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,96
147,1160,JamesMcPolin,4.48,"Poured from a bomber, that has been properly cellared for over two years, into a snifter. Anticipation building, as this is one of the oldest I haven't drunk already in the cellar.  Appearance: pours with a nice looking head, tan in color, a little lighter than one might expect. Dissipates fairly quickly but retains a darker colored ring around the glass with decent lace.  Smell: Interestingly, you'd get more aroma from a brand new 2010 release than what I'm getting right now, not sure if that's typical of aging but had a similar experience recently with a serpent stout from lost abbey I aged. Definitely good though, classic roasted malt aroma and more chocolaty than coffee.  Taste: First sip, freshly cracked, palate gets bathed in artisanal chocolate. When it comes to the 10.8% alcohol, forget well-hidden, it's gone. I'm talking practically undetectable in the first glass. Even as it warms, if I didn't already know the abv and someone told me it was 7.5 or 8% I'd believe it. Coffee notes seemed more muted at first but became more and more delicious as it approached room temp. Trust me; it's hard not to drink it all before reaching that point. I'm nursing the last few sips left as I type this. Wish I had aged two so I could have another to drink at this temp from the start.  Mouth feel: excellent. It must be said first that imperial stouts and imperial porters are my favorite styles so my idea of body is slanted toward loving massive brews. That being said, in very relative terms, the aging seems to have really lightened the mouthfeel. But again, I could always go for thicker.  Drinkability: Not hard to drink at all. In fact, hard to not drink it all too fast before it warmed and got complex. Little bummed I drank it too fast, two years to age, 15mins to go down the hatch even while typing, LOL. But an all around excellent brew. I think '08 was a great year for Stone's Russian Imperial, right in there behind '05 and '02.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,96

The backend is dominated by the chocolate that lingers around on the palate. I seem to have a hard time not keep taking sip after sip.

Alcohol is somehow missing. Very impressive given the 10.5%  M: Heavy with moderate carbonation. Very slick compared to some other RIS's. Isn't clingy at all, which is a very nice surprise as well  O: This is still definitely one of my favorite beers. Just so amazingly complex and somehow too easy to finish. Now, I need to try the anise odd year version and see how it stacks up",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,96

Smell is huge milk chocolate, some roasted malt, a hint of fresh light roast coffee and hops. Taste is a mix between sweet milk chocolate and slightly bitter hops, followed by some roasted malt and some bitter bakers chocolate in the finish. Mouthfeel is heavy with a medium light carbonation.

147,1160,TCHopCraver,4.87,"Review #100 (!) from notes tidily scrawled on 11/10/10. 2010 vintage.  I poured about half a bomber into a large snifter, leading to a one-finger mocha head atop an awfully black body. The head fades swiftly and leaves behind a hazy, swirling cauldron-look of film. This looks like a RIS should look.  Gigantic, bold aromas blossom out of the glass. Dark chocolate, brown sugar, caramel, anise, roasted malt, graham crackers, maple syrup, and a slightly nostril-stinging alcoholic heat all synthesize to result in an olfactory-filling treat of a smell. Big and bad would be an appropriate way to describe this scent.  As I sip away, flavors of roasted malt, booze, coffee-like acidity, and maybe a bit of hop bitterness grip the edges of my palate, while the expansive, sweet flavors of dark chocolate, brown sugar, and caramel disperse all over the flat of my tongue. All the while, the substantial alcohol content is present in a taste reminiscent of fine single malt Scotch. The finish is heavy on acidic coffee flavors. When first I tried this beer, I marveled at how it affected my palate in ""waves,"" for lack of a better way to describe it. I still feel that it does this, but I am happy that I can now think more critically about how the beer tastes, and likewise describe it critically. Knowledge and cognitive exercise are wonderful - especially when one can get a warm buzz while gaining and performing them.  The mouthfeel has got it all: a full, creamy feel on the middle of my palate, along with a biting acidity on the periphery. A fairly clean, dry finish tops it all off. Mouthfeel-alicious.  This is oh-so-drinkable for how huge the flavor is and how high the alcohol content is. Simply put, I love this RIS. It was perhaps the first truly great beer that I tried, and I hold it in just as high esteem now as that first time I had it. It is a truly delicious and satisfying beer and I look forward to its release every year.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,96
147,1160,zoolzoo,4.08,"2009 vintage, consumed on 11/30/2010 - aged for a little over a year.  A: ""Stout black"", coffee bean head quickly dissipating into a cap.  S: Milk chocolate, sharp tinge of alcohol. Roasted malt, subtle dark fruit.  T: Much more mellow with just a year on this. I recall the fresh 2009 to be quite rough around the edges, almost whiskey like in it's overall delivery. The chocolate is so much more expressive now. Still a little hop presence, actually. I'm pleased with the balance between chocolate sweetness and roast. A cellar success.  M: Smooth, although the carbonation is quite prickly. A good vessel for all of this flavor, I like it.  D: Much improved over fresh, maybe too drinkable for ABV.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,96

T: Bitter chocolate and roasty malt gives way to a slightly chocolate sweetness with fruity subtleness. Medium high earthy bitterness leads to some rich toffee and oak notes. Roasty dryness, very dry finish.  M: Creamy medium-full body with medium carbonation. Alcohol fairly well hidden.  A fairly dry RIS that is better as it warms. But all in all, just amazing. I loved how bold all the components were and how well they melded together like a symphony.

Paired with North Park's Eclipse Chocolat - Pomegranate Sage Truffle.  A: Pours a midnight black hue that looks like engine oil with not much in the way of a head or lace - sludgy and dark.  S: Roasted malt, soy sauce and smoky earthy notes that are unique and interesting.  T: Right on with the nose, with a bit more smoke and sweet roasted malt.  M: Full-bodied, creamy with a slick velocity and very little carbonation.  D: Very drinkable for how thick, dark and robust of an ale this is.

147,1160,afksports,4.57,"Early on in my life I saw a bottle of Stone Arrogant Bastard, while purchasing some Yuengling probably, and thought to myself ""Damn, that brewery is so full of itself. I'll never drink that."" And then I matured, had their RIS, and my mind was blown. This review is from notes.  It's another one that's pitch black. Tan head. Stout. There's a tinge of fruit in the smell, but it's mostly coffee and chocolate maltiness. It swallows the same, but the bitter of the chocolate comes out along with the alcohol. Every element of the taste is in great balance. It's thick and full-bodied, and that - along with the alcohol - lowers its drinkability.  But who am I kidding? This is great. Plus Stone makes it affordably, which should be its own rating when it comes to lots of RIS's on here. It's just as good as these other hard to find ones. Does it blow my mind? No. But they damn well have a right to be arrogant.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,96

Smells of milk chocolate anc cocoa powder. Right behind it are roasted malts and some vanilla. There are also some hints of coffee as well. GREAT aroma.  T - Awesome chocolate flavors all over the palate; dark and milk. Some slightly burnt, bitter flavors come through as well which really adds a nice surprise to the palate. Roasted malts and nice vanilla flavors are there as well.  M - Incredibly creamy mouthfeel. Full bodied with little carbination. Very creamy and thick. Really coats the palate well. What a RIS should be.  D - Deservingly in the top 10. A really great RIS with a ton of great flavor.

Holding it up to the light doesn't reveal much more than black. The thin head is a beautiful tan and leaves a nice layer across the top of the glass. It's not the best stout I've ever seen (Ten FIDY?), but it's close.  The smell is dominated by dark fruits. Almost like a dopplebock. Definitely some roast and booze there, too. Yum.  The taste is right along the lines of the nose. Dark fruits. Dark roast. Some booze. All wonderfully blending together. The carbonation is right in line. Not under carbonated like some stouts. Keeps the mouthfeel from being exceedingly heavy. Very well balanced for how big it is. This beer is very drinkable and I'll love drinking the rest. I'm so happy that this is distributed in Texas and it's one of the best beers we can consistently get down here.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,96
147,1160,BuckeyeOne,4.45,"Poured from a 22 oz. bottle into a nonic pint glass dark with a puffy mocha-colored head that left plenty of lace down the glass.  The initial smell is of dark chocolate and coffee with a hint of ripe plums. After a few swirls, the sweet malt and caramel rises.  The initial flavor follow the nose --- dark bittersweet chocolate and coffee followed by ripe fruits. What differentiates this RIS/IRS from others is the distinctive Stone hop bite. I must say this was a welcome addition.  The mouthfeel is good, a bit more carbonated than I want in a RIS/IRS.

147,1160,bsuedekum,4.35,"A - Pitch black which I like and a good lacing and head. The head fades quickly (would like it to linger a little longer) and leaves a thin lacing.  S - Alcohol is present, roasted & sugar smell there as well. It is a good smell but doesn't come through as strong as I'd like.  T - Roasted malt that finishes with a coffee aftertaste. A boozy taste mixes in but doesn't overpower it which give the overall flavor a great balance.  M - Low carbonation, very smooth for 10.5 %.  D - It has a slight ""hot"" or boozy bite to it when swallowing but not significant. It will leave a buzz after having a bottle and overall it is a pleasant drink for each swallow throughout.

The 10.5% abv is not as harsh as other 10%'s i've had, especially because of the heavy emphasis on the smooth malty flavor in the beer. Exceptionally well balanced.

147,1160,billab914,4.37,"2009 vintage poured from a 22oz bottle into my very appropriate Stone RIS glass. It poured pitch black with a modest tan head filling the rest of the glass. The head faded to a thin ring around the edge of the glass where it left some moderate lacing.  The aroma is full of chocolate and roasted malts. The roasted malts bring a bitter, slightly burnt flavor along with some coffee and the chocolate really smooths it out. A bit of vanilla is present in it as well. Very flavorful aroma to it overall.  The taste shows a pretty big dark chocolate flavor to it. It's bitter-sweet at first but more of the dark and roasted malts come through towards the finish. Some coffee and burnt flavors come through as well. it has a great mix of the sweeter chocolate and malty flavors and the bitter and roasted flavors. Great beer overall for the style.  The mouthfeel is thick and creamy with carbonation being on the lower side. Very nice for the style and just how I like my big stouts.

147,1160,BeerNinja007,4.35,"Got this bomber at Beverage Warehouse in Winooski VT for $6.99. Limited Spring 2010 Release. Served cold in a chilled tulip. I've been looking forward to this one for a while.  Pitch black brew lets zero light through and throws up a thick 1"" of deep brown foam from its murky depths. Aroma has the requisite smoky roasted barley and chocolate, but it isn't dry or bitter because warm sweet vanilla melds in beautifully to round it out. In the taste the vanilla sweetness is much less prominent and the brew exhibits a moderately strong astringent edge. Feel is thick and hearty, a seriously dense beer, creamy and smooth, with a mild but surprisingly sharp carbonation that prickles a little as it pokes through. There's a strong but mostly hidden alcohol bite that I perhaps lends some assertiveness to the carbo. Back to the taste... huge dense flavors of semi-sweet chocolate, vanillin, a great balance between dry roasted barley and sweet caramel, some spicy alcohol gives it a bite but is kept mostly to the sidelines, thick bready backbone. Moderate amount of lace throughout the session. Very filling brew.  Dense, huge, massive brew. It is this years' vintage and it's already very smooth... can't imagine how luscious it might be after cellaring for a year or two. I might have to find out.

D - Drinks great, very balanced and complex, I can have a few but its expensive usually $7-$8 bucks a bottle. Great beer with meat or dinner, or whenever.

M: It feels medium- to full-bodied and rather smooth on the palate. Some warming sensations from the alcohol are present. D: This beer is definitely one that needs to be slowly sipped given its alcohol content; it would take me a long time to finish a 750mL bottle by myself.

It seemed like a good match there. 7.99 for the bottle seemed like a good investment.  Pours a jet black, with no hint of clear or red or anything. Thin wispy head, dark tan, hangs on top. Not a ton of head with this beer. But thats ok.  Nice nose of burnt malts, much like coffee, and some nice fruity esters. Also some hints of chocolate. The nose is quite forward, and it doesn't take much to pick it up. I like that, some stouts seem really light on the nose. This one is right there in your face.  Taste is huge on the coffee and chocolate mix. The esters take a backseat in the taste, just giving a little fruity mix to the beer.  Mouthfeel coats your tongue sweet syrupy goodness. it is a bit heavier than it could be, but it is within acceptable range of an Impy Stout.  Drinkable, well, it's nothing to guzzle down, thats for sure, and the booze can start to get you a bit loopy by the end.  The taste gets even better as it warms.

Caramel. Raisins. So many beautiful things going on in this nose. I LOVE it.  Taste- Wow. Dark chocolate everywhere. Lots of coffee. Slight raisin finish. Tons of roasted flavors.

My mouth was not prepared for the focused assault of rich strong stout, with it's more focused maltiness. Tasted smokey, a bit chocolaty with fleeting tastes of dates or raisins.

Very sweet and heavily malty on the front...certainly high on the sugars, with a molasses thickness. Fades into a finish that has bitter dark chocolate, a definite coffee presence, thick molasses, along with a small hoppiness that isn't too strong at the swallow, but has a aspirin-like tendency to stick around on the sides of the tongue for a while into the aftertaste. However, after a few swallows this bitterness becomes a lot less pronounced.  Definitely one of the sweeter RIS's that I have had.. It's also one of the thickest I've ever had.

At this point my mind is completely changed, and i'm enormously impressed with this beer, as well as the last two i reviewed, Ruination IPA and Juxtaposition Black Pilsner. Russian Imperial is very fluid and light bodied with little carbonation and a strongly structured long lasting head. I poured this out into a pint glass and watched the head die down slowly over the black, chocolaty body. The taste was by far the beast part of the beer, rich chocolate, faint coffee, raisins and molasses.

Pours nearly black, very slight brownish ruby hints when held up to a light, supple beige foam, nice life. Deep aromas of charred wood, leather, fig, and a boatload of roasted malt flavors. Not overly on the chocolate or coffee, which I tend to think let's the more exotic flavors shine. First gulp is full and intense, very warming. Loads of ripeness, rich, earthy, soaked currant raisin fig fruity, nice mellow roastyness and the slightest bitter edge cutting through. Images of smoke, leather, tobacco. Milky and voluptuous the palate with a slight chewyness and surrounded by a definite heft and warmth. Perfect for ushering in the colder weather on a rainy fall night, while I wait for my landlord to turn on the damn heat. Only gets better with age for at least 2 years that I can vouch for. Don't overlook this beast due to it's lack of non-availability.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,96
147,1160,wahhmaster,4.52,"Poured from a 1 pt. 6 oz. bottle into a Sam Adams Boston Lager glass. 2008 vintage.  Appearance: Pours a very dark black color. Has a tight, brown head that dissipates quickly down to a frothy ring on top of the beer. Leaves behind some creamy, oily lacing.  Smell: Smells VERY strongly of coffee, chocolate, dark fruits, roasted malts, and a hint of alcohol. Chocolate and coffee seem to dominate.  Taste: Not as aggressively bitter as I was expecting. I suppose the two years that have been put on it have mellowed it out. Still, it is aggressively malty with chocolate, coffee, caramel, dark fruits, and a bit of nuttiness. The alcohol is also very present here and gives this baby a bit of a kick going down as well as a nice warmth.  Mouthfeel: Creamy, chewy, perfect.  Drinkability: An excellent stout. I'd have to try a more recent vintage to really see the effect of aging on this beer but I am glad to have tried this aged one. This is certainly something I'd recommend for aging but the temptation to drink it would certainly be great!",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,96
147,1160,Keffa,4.23,"Poured from 22oz bomber into my Unibroue tulip.  A: Pitch black, rushing 1 1/2"" head of tan bubbles, with the carbonation coming after I finished the pour. Settles to a small cap/ring that is made up of tiny bubbles. Leaves a little oily lace on the glass. Nice.  S: Burnt/heavily roasted coffee beans, dark brown sugar, raisins, some solid chocolate notes. I get a very, very faint hop, like a slightly herbal/piney hop, but it is extremely faint. Not too shabby.  T: Very nice dark fruit and slight coffee on the start, plum/raisin and a nice cup of joe. Chocolate comes in, and an almost smokey note takes over towards the finish. Nice.  M: Nice body, decent carbonation for the style, and almost creamy finish. Nice.  D: Not bad. This is more a sipping beer, but it's still easy to drink.  Overall, this is quite good. The only thing I would say I don't like is the smokey quality, as it gets in the way a little. Otherwise, this is a good RIS, and one I'd buy again.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,96

S: A delicious strong smell of roasted malts with a sweet chocolate hint as the smell lingers. No real hint of alcohol given the alcohol content.  T: Almost the same as the smell. Hint of chocolate with roasted malts. It ends with some bitterness and a very small taste of alcohol mixed in. This beer got better as I moved my way through the bottle.  M: Very light bodied with little carbonation.  D: Very very drinkable, it is very tasty and given that it is 10.50% ABV you really do not taste the alcohol which I like a lot. This is one of my favorite beers. Very easy to drink. I have no problems recommending this beer. Love the taste!

Very little lacing on the snifter. Looked watery upon the pour.  S: A delicious strong smell of roasted malts with a sweet chocolate back hint. Made my stomach grumble from being hungry. No smell of alcohol here as well.  T: Almost the same as the smell. Chocolate with bready roasted malts on the back taste. It ends with some bitterness and a small taste of alcohol mixed in.  M: Very light bodied with little carbonation. A little bit too light bodied for my own liking in a RIS but that should detract nothing much from it.  D: Very drinkable, its tastiness was hid the 10.50% ABV well and I could drink this very fast. Would recommend it to others.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,96
147,1160,infi,4.42,"2008 22 oz. bomber, shared with BAs brun and NYManc.  Poured into a Duvel tulip.  Completely dark black and opaque with a sizable half-inch tan head of thin bubbles, which left copious amounts of lacing on the glass. Smell was thoroughly full of roasted malt and grain, with some glimmers of chocolate. Most of the coffee seemed to have gone along with the time, as there were no traces of it at all. Considering a two-year old bottle, there were still some scents of alcohol towards the end.  Taste is incredibly smooth and delectable. Serious roasted malt sweetness throughout on the palate with an ending of bittersweet dark chocolate and a minute flavor of musky fruitiness. As the stout warms, the sweet characteristics open up particularly well, as well as the high ABV warmth.  A bit light on the liquid body compared to other RIS I've had, but still a beauty. Very low the carbonation feel with a relatively moderate viscosity feel on the tongue. A definite plus is how fast I was drinking this beer - nothing was holding me back. Quite delicious. I've held onto this beer for a long time and very glad to have opened it to finally experience one of my most anticipated beers.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,96

Tastes like a stout should: roasty malts, bitter coffee notes, just a hint of sweetness, and it hides the alcohol well.

Nice and strong roasted coffee notes along with malt and some dark fruit. Medium mouthfeel. Big and chewy but still not as heavy as I would like for a 10.5% abv RIS. Big roasted coffee notes in the taste. Lingering bitterness similiar to a dark coffee. Some dark fruit type tastes as well. No real evidence of the alcohol. Overall, I am pretty happy with this beer. Not overly roasty or boozy but a nice balance and a RIS that I'm sure a lot of people cold enjoy.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,96

Taste: Smokey, slight peat, slight coffee, malts, subtle hops, and a slight cocoa.  Mouthfeel: Heavy.  Overall: A STOUT stout. Wow. This is very strong and drinkable. This is also the first Stone Brewing beer I've tried that did not have strong hops. It is fairly smooth and very strong.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,96
147,1160,pmlondrigan,4.05,"I am trying to get into the RIS style. Poured into a small tasting chalice. Black, opaque, thick. Without a super heavy pour a head is not really produced. Really thing milk infused coffee color head. Aroma of coffee, bitter chocolate, vanilla, roasted barley, and finishes with grassy earthy hop notes. Maybe a little weak. Your palate is met with rich heavy cappuccino flavors, chocolate, vanilla, coffee, and hops manage to cut through leaving a lingering bitterness on the tongue. This big beer manages to be dry, with just a mild bitter aftertaste. Really good body without being syrupy as I find many RIS beers to be. I sought this out and I will again. Good beer.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,96
147,1160,cigarchitect,4.97,"Poured from 22oz into a snifter. Opaque black with a generous beach mud colored head that retreats rather quickly leaving little lace. The nose is roasted malts, coffee, and a bit of booziness. Some caramel comes through with the booze. Quite lovely to sniff. The first sip is a bit dry with a wonderful malty-coffee flavour. Dark chocolate and caramel on the finish Mouthfeel is almost perfect for the style. Could be stickier, but it coats the palate generously and the flavors thank the viscosity for allowing them to do their thing. This monster is dangerously drinkable for the ABV. It might be a bottle best enjoyed with company, but I am happy to say that this one is all mine!",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,96
147,1160,stimulus,4.12,"Reviewing from my notes from midsummer.  Poured from a 22 oz bottle into a snifter.  A: Pours a jet black with a beige head that retains throughout. S: Powerful roasted coffee beans and bittersweet Belgian dark chocolate are strongly present. T: Roasted malt, dark chocolate, and a hint of coffee are present until the finish, where only the bitterness of the chocolate lingers. M: Well carbonated yet quite heavy on the body. D: A pretty good Imperial Stout, and I'm surprised the bitterness doesn't come from the hops knowing Stone beers, but I know this beer is heavily hopped and the bitterness from the dark chocolate still overshadows the hops here.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,96

T: again dark fruits upfront, heavy roasty malts, dark coffee notes come in. Dark chocolate. Finishes with alcoholic fumes in the mouth & dark chocolate/coffee roast bitterness. Finishing tastes linger... Pretty dry finish.. Slight burning down the chest from alcohol.  MF: thick, rich, yet creamy & smooth. Carbonation is spot on for this brew.

Nice dark tan head... Retention and lacing don't blow my mind.  Smell is odd in a sense... There appears to be a hint of soy sauce... Cocoa... Dark fruits? Hmmm. Out of those, only bitter cocoa appears in the flavor profile. There is also very little sweetness-- more of a dry, roasted barley and malt bite. Not bad, but not mind-blowing to me. The finish is sweeter than the profile... Very little booziness... No real flaws aside from the slight soy sauce hint.  Body is respectfully full, but a great creamy feel is present from the carbonation level. The beer drinks pretty easily, with a good enough balance and flavor to hide the alcohol.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,96
147,1160,Bonis,4.5,"A - As black a beer as I've seen, no light peaks through anywhere. Huge light tan pillowy head with large air pockets. This hangs around for several minutes and leaves behind a beautiful lacing.  S - Huge dark roast malts, cacao beans, dark chocolate. Hints of espresso and licorice come through. A somewhat intense sweetness lingers, and no alcohol can be traced.  T - Pretty much along the lines of the smell, this malt bomb offers a robust combination of dark chocolate, espresso, cacao beans, and a touch of licorice. The sweetness comes in a fruit-like form, cherries and raisins come to mind. The finish is of sweet milk chocolate and chocolate fudge. I don't get any of the bitterness that comes with some imperial stouts... And again, little to no alcohol presence. This one definitely lived up to my expectations.  M - Smooth and creamy, big bodied but not as big and chewy as I anticipated (perfectly fine by me). I didn't notice much carbonation (again, fine by me).  D - Well, for being a strong RIS, it doesn't get too much better here. Definitely not one to drink all night, but I think I could easily handle a bomber to myself. Split this one tonight, and had a decent buzz going after finishing my portion (which didn't take too long...). To those who haven't tried this one: Buy It! It's definitely worth the somewhat small price tag.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,96

No alcohol in the smell, very balanced and smells great.  t - Tastes of bitter chocolate, coffee, roasted malts, vanilla, and hint of alcohol.  m - Medium to full body and low carbonation. Very easy to drink for 10.5% ABV.  d - This is a great RIS. I've had it several times and a few different vintages and have always enjoyed it. This one being a 2004 vintage, I didn't think the extra time did too much to improve the beer, but regardless, it is one of the best easily available RIS's out there.

Pours a near black color, that only shows some reddish tints around the edge of the glass when held up to the light. Nice two finger deep tan head that doesn't fully dissipate at all. Leaves ok lacing on the glass. Smell is amazing. The chocolate is faded in comparison to the fresh version, with some deeper layers of dark fruit taking its place. Still some bittersweet and milk chocolate, though, along with some coffee. Such a complex aroma.  Taste is along the same lines as the aroma. Starts with a bit of coffee, then you get punched in the face with dark fruits, and it finishes with a bit of bittersweet chocolate. Hops are not noticeable whatsoever, as they shouldn't be in a 2004 vintage. Seems to have thinned out a bit in comparison to the fresh version.

Opaque and black with dark brown hues refracting the light that was lucky enough to slide by the side of the glass.  S - Coffee, toffee and a touch of alcohol in the smell. Nice to draw a nose full of this right before taking a sip. There may have been more chocolate in the smell than what I recognized, but it was well buried in the other smells  T - Great! There's the coffee again, but this is where I could detect a chocolaty presence as well. Alcohol was hid a bit better in teh taste than in the nose, but it was still there.

S- Strong alcohol and bitter chocolate, some underlying notes of toffee and treacle.  T- A true imperial stout, this beer has a punch and the flavor to go with it. Chocolate, espresso, rich dark fruits and malts. Slightly hot but that blends well with the sweetness.  M- Full bodied and creamy with a smooth finish, not as dry as one would expect for a 10.5% beer.  D- This is a great RIS and should cellar very well. Definitely a good beer for a cold winters evening.  *** Blind Bomber #7 thanks to Nate (nlmartin) in Round #2 of the Blind Beer BIF.  2005 Vintage  22 oz bottle poured into a Ommegang glass. Dark black in color and head is an 1/8th inch of dark brown that disappears into a small oil slick. Aroma is bitter chocolate, cocoa, and a touch of fusel alcohol. Flavor is very much a stout but I'm struggling to pull out too many unique flavors. Chocolate and black bittering malt abound and not much hop flavor from what I can tell. Mouthfeel is dry and chewy, I'm left with cottonmouth after almost each sip. The beer is mellow and very tasty, something I could and am sipping on all night. Fits very nicely on this rainy evening.  Going over my previous review, this beer has dried out nicely and still holds a good heat. Most of the dark fruit is gone, as are any trace of hops.

Great malt aroma, bittersweet chocolate, roasted malts, toffee, some prune/grape aroma from dark caramel malts and three years of aging.  Full bodied, creamy fluffy texture, leaves a slick syrupy texture on the palate. The abv numbs the palate a bit and warms the belly. Mmmm.  Lots of malty sweetness, prune super dark chocolate and molasses. Huge roasted character really balances the sweetness well. Bitter espresso aftertaste. Really very good, very strong, almost a dessert.  Aged this beer is much more approachable and enjoyable than it is super fresh, the hops mellow a bit giving way to lots of chocolate and roasted flavors.  Perfect RIS!

147,1160,Chizoad,4.43,"An absolute knockout. Spring 2010 release, $6, and one of the best beers around for the price.  Killer appearance in the glass. Brown ink supporting a tan head with evident carbonation. Only taking 1/2 a point off because of the color of the head being too gray for my liking.  Coffee, malt aromas, but a little quiet compared to what happens when you taste it.  Big malty goodness, with coffee bitterness backing up some sugar and licorice. Not huge complexity but great flavor. Compares favorably with Oskar Blues' Ten Fidy and The Abyss from Deschutes. Perhaps in a few years the flavors would deepen.  Really loved the carbonation of this beer. Of course it's heavy, but the bright carbonation really makes it far more drinkable than the usual.

Of course, it would be difficult to drink too much of this with its high ABV.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,96
147,1160,BMan1113VR,4.01,"Have had this many times in bottles of different vintages, casks, and taps of different vintages. This rating is from a bottle of 2007 (from notes). Pours with a finger width, creamy brown head with a black body. Nice coffee aroma with a dash of nail polish/fusel alcohol. Taste is coffee and a lot of barely. Extremely nice creamy body, bitter hop finish. This is a great roasty, and slightly hoppy stout, with a few dark fruit esters. Alcohol is high, but I feel that it is over rated...Solid beer but not one of the best imperial stouts. I am aging a bottle for 4 years to see if it improves...I have high hopes...Right now the beer has a bit too much bitterness from the roast.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,96
147,1160,Jeffo,3.53,"Bottles courtesy of thetomG and akbeerfiend. Thanks guys!  From a bomber into a snifter  APPEARANCE: A black pour creates a two finger, thicker looking tan head with good retention. Jet black body with zero carbonation evident. Head slowly fades to a good wisp with a bit of lacing clinging to the sides .A ring remains and leaves some dots of lacing after every sip. Good looking brew.  SMELL: Roasted malt, caramel malt, and some pure chocolate. Touches of licorice and dark malts as well. Medium strength.  TAST: Big roasted flavor, caramel and dark malts, with hints of black licorice and dark chocolate. Aftertaste is bold but quick, with lots of roasted flavors in there, some dark malts and coffee notes. Bitter-sweet finish and the alcohol is well hidden. Decently bold enough flavors. Good, but not great.  PALATE: Medium-full body with medium carbonation. Semi-creamy on the palate, goes down fine with a bit of a prickle after the swallow. Finishes rather dry on the palate.  OVERALL: I can definitely see why this is considered a classic, but don't think it measures up to some of the stouts that have followed it. A good aroma and taste profile, but certainly doesn't stand out next to some of the others on the market. A brew I'll have again if I find it, but I don't need to seek it out again. Interested to see how the other bottle ages though. Will update this review in a couple years. Thanks for this one boys.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,96

147,1160,ElGallo,4.45,"I had never seen this one in my area, but found a random lonely bottle at Carl's in Kittery, Maine to take home. I'll put it right out there: this beer is worth the hype. I haven't had many west coast stouts. Actually only Old Rasputin comes to mind, and that's a damn good stout, but this gargoyle kicks its ass, handily.  Fantastic nose, good solid finger and a half of foamy beige head with sturdy lacing. First sip was silky smooth with chocolate, burnt coffee, and lots of other tasty morsels I won't bother mentioning because you should stop reading this and simply seek out your own bottle.  Being from NH I am an unflinching Kate the Great fan, but this bad boy is her equal (IMO) in the land of Ruskie Impy Stouties.

147,1160,jlindros,4.28,"Can't believe I haven't reviewed this yet. Great time to review it, sitting through Hurricane Earl. Spring 2010 release.  A nice creamy rich dark head rises up to 1 finger but fades semi quickly over super dark almost pitch black colored beer. It has nice legs running down the sides of the glass too indicating it's thickness.  The nose has plenty of dark roasty malts, lots of coffee and toffee, roasted barley, some oatmeal, creamy chocolate milk, some bakers chocolate, a slight caramel, chewy malt aroma, some sweetness but no real booze. THe nose is a little harder to get out than I expected, lighter.  The taste comes on really rich, velvety, thick, and tasty. It is a little boozy, with some warmth and very light tingle. There is some nice dark malts, some roast, light coffee, toffee, caramel, and somewhat sweet. Lots more creamy chocolate milk and oatmeal, but not too heavy on the oatmeal. Some bakers chocolate as well. A light vanilla flavor as well. A slight bitterness, a little from the roast and some soft earthy hops.  The mouth is heavier but not overwhelming, with good carbonation and a light warming booze.  It finishes slightly dry with some more sticky sweetness, lingering toffee, some coffee and roast, lots of chocolate, creamy milk and bakers, and even a little vanilla still. Some light warming and tingly booze late, but not as much as I expected. A little bitterness It coats the mouth pretty well too and just lingers and lingers. A little bitterness starts to build too and get a little more bitter as it goes, some light spicy hops and somewhat from the earthy roast. With all the dark malts in this I'm surprised there aren't any off flavor minerals and briney flavors, they did a good job with this.  Overall I'm a little disappointed by the nose being too light, but the taste was great, and the whole experience of the beer was pretty nice. I need to crack my aged bottle sometime, although I think I want to keep aging it.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,96

A slight brown head sits atop and quickly falls leaving a good amount of brown streaks down the glass.  S - Tons of chocolate, dark roasted coffee, smoaked and roasted malt, burnt toast. I probably would pay someone to just smell this beer.  T - Loads of flavor. So much that it's difficult to separate. First and foremost, lots of dark chocolate. Then there's the roasted coffee, coccoa, licorice, vanilla, molasses, dark fruits/prunes. Alcohol doesn't so much as come through in taste as it provides a nice warmth.  M - Full bodied and smooth. Very little carbonation and very little bitterness/hop presence.  D - For the alcohol content and overall thickness of this brew, it is highly drinkable.

Espresso coffee. Roasted malt. Roasted nuts. Dark fruit. Anise. Burnt toast. Caramel. Hop bitterness.  Mouthfeel: Full bodied, thick and viscous.

147,1160,Misfit025,4.25,"This is my first review so take it easy on me...  I bought myself some of this imperial stout over the weekend and this one in particular was from spring 2008 so it has been aged for 2+ years. Appearance-wise this beer is very dark black and coffee-like. There is no lacing and almost no head.  It had a very apparent licorice smell to it with hints of coffee and dried fruit.  It tasted of toasty, almost burnt malt with a bitter finish on the back of the tongue. Bold coffee flavor with dark chocolate undertones.  There did not seem to be much carbonation left and this caused it to have a thin mouthfeel but this could have been caused by the aging process.  Because it wasn't as thick as a normal stout it was a little more drinkable and less filling. Also because of the aging there was less of an alcohol burn (this batch was 10.8% ABV).  Overall, a very tasty beer. Being 2+years old, lost viscosity and some bitterness. Also lost some carbonation and heat yet gained a more upfront roasted malt flavor.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,96
147,1160,sellmeagod,4.18,"Oh indeed, this is a mighty brew that will have orcs cascading across your palate and conjure up images of mages brewing crazy potions, only a few sips in.  Opaque. Mysterious. Insane pour.  Smells like a bunch of sweets, a bunch of bitters, a bunch of fruits.  Each sip is bizarrely different from the last, depending on what you want to notice. Each is delicious. Easily the most tastes in a single sip of any brew I have ever had.  It's thick and it's 10.5, so you aren't drinking these all night.

147,1160,MysticRuler,4.18,"Excellent example of a heavy stout. Sweet malt, coffee and chocolate predominate with high alcohol level kept in check by a nice measure of hops. If I had to criticize I would say that the sweetness could be dialed back a bit, which would allow some of the more bitter flavors to come through. I've rated drinkability at a lower level because it's not one you are likely to pound back at a session, but as a single (very hard to find 12 oz but nice to split) its a sweetheart.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,96

Looks like an eight-ball in my tulip but upon closer inspection you can notice tiny brown yeast particles floating everywhere. Lacing pattern reminds me of dulse seaweed.  S-Vanilla essence, alcohol and all. Marzipan. Chocolate ice cream with the cone. Just enough cocoa bitterness to keep it all balanced and interesting.  T- Intense but not so complex. Like an alcoholic chocolate ice cream. Not getting much dark fruit which is nice for a change. Really delicious.  M-Silky, denser than average, body (add some milk to the chocolate ice cream). Low carbonation. Sticky. Appart fro how silky and relatively thick it is, nothing really special about the feel but it is enjoyable.  D- So tasty, making it too easy to drink. Very fun to drink. It also feels light for some reason making it easier to drink even though it really isn't. Had this after eating and could already feel the alcohol after half a bottle so watch out.

147,1160,RaulMatisse,4.13,"Sometimes you want your beer to kick you around a little bit. In the case of Stone Imperial Russian Stout, you'd better like your beer to kick you square in the face. This goliath threatens to crush you with all the Red Army's might, bodes ominously with the risk of a nuclear winter, and promises a perestroika of your palette in declaring a Cold War against any and all sissy, thin, flat, pseudo-stouts.  If enriched uranium is jet black and nuclear bombshells have a stocky, glass body with a longneck, then Stone IRS should be protected under international treaties as a WMD. The only difference between this ballistic missile and those lost in the sands of the Middle East is that I actually stumbled upon this bomber in plain view for a fraction of the $10 trillion required to find a warhead of similar magnitude.  Stone IRS oozes a deep, rich black, forming looming islands of large, glossy bubbles that accumulate on the perimeters of my cognac glass. Spanning between the ethereal islands is an abysmally black lake weighted by ominous swirls of charred bone-colored streaks. Islands decay and erode sending midnight waves that threaten the seemingly impenetrable surface tension of the obsidian brew.  A beer of this complexity requires several whiffs at regular intervals to truly appreciate the depth of aroma--mere comparisons to coffee or chocolate will not suffice. Such is to equate the subtle aroma of cave-aged Gruyere to a block of Velveeta. Shallow sniffs yield the ubiquitous roasted malt, with progressively deeper inhalations producing increasingly intense aromas of dark chocolate raspberry, black fruits, wet earth, and an ever-escalating alcohol burn. Think splashing a cup of vodka into a scalding-hot pan and breathing the distillates. The amalgamation of these rich scents prepares the palette for what lies ahead...  ...Utter destruction. Total annihilation. A blitzkrieg of the most cunningly vicious infantrymen could not keep a foothold when faced with the slash and burn that is Stone IRS. Opponents beware: this menace lives up to its namesake--imperializing your virgin palate is all in a day's work. Hide your women and children--the opposition has arrived, and it's shrouded in black and will strike without notice.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,96

A - Black as night and viscous with a frothy coffee brown head, bubbling up and unleashing a thick head with substantial retention and some stick lacing.  S - Thick roasted malts, caramel, coffee, chocolate, and a hint of booze.  T - This beer is massive. Beginning with heavy malts mixed with grain, some rich sweetness kicks in with molasses and roasted qualities. The 10.5% alcohol is present but definitely not overbearing, as dark fruit and chocolate flavors wrap around the palate along with a dash of heat from the booze and hops. It finishes clear and dry along with some tingly warmth and stickiness.  M/D - An overall mix of creaminess, smoothness, warmth, and crispiness. This is a true slow sipper, but it's so delicious that you might find it difficult not to drink it too fast.  Stone Brewing Company is on point as always.

Swirling the beer around left a filmy coat on the sides of the glass. I can smell roasted malts, coffee and dark chocolate wafting off of the beer. It's a good mixture of sweet and bitter. The taste is of slightly creamy chocolate up front. In the finish is coffee bitterness and some effervescent alcohol. The flavor lets you know this is a strong beer. It has a creamy body. It isn't as full-bodied as some other stouts. There is a medium level of carbonation. There is a bit of coating, but not too much. Nor is it very sticky, which is nice.

Chocoalates for the sweetness, and roasted malts and coffee for the bitters. A very faint booziness chimes through.  Flavor is very much like I though it would be...which means it isn't disappointing in the least. Lots of coffee notes, a heavy deep roast...along with the bitter/sweet coffee flavor throughout.

147,1160,silentjay,4.05,"a 2008 vintage found left over in a local store. Has been left on the shelf for the past couple of years, not ideal aging conditions, but it should hold up ok.  an extremely viscous pour of an opaque black liquid with brown highlights. a small tan head is produced, but quickly recedes to a spattering of film, but leaves a good amount of lacing behind.  most dominant aroma is licorice, with molasses, burnt bitter coffee, roasted malts, some dark chocolate. also some fruitiness.  taste is similar to the aroma, but has even more charred roastiness. still there is molasses, coffee, and dark baker's chocolate. some raisins, dates, prunes and a bit of earthiness. a bit of harsh booze, but nowhere near as much as in a fresh bottle.  thick body with just enough carbonation to make an appearance, but not so much that it takes away from the creaminess. finishes a tad dry and roasty and with some discernible bitterness and a slight warming from the alcohol after the swallow.  drinkability is pretty decent, no doubt improved by the aging. alcohol is there, and it detracts a bit, but it is not insurmountable. quite a tasty brew, but may be a bit much for some.  update: 2011 version, fresh: flavor has a lot less licorice with a lot of woodiness and a significant hoppiness. slightly lower in abv (10.8 vs 10.5) but its still a bit boozy. I like this a bit more.

Also some bittersweet chocolate and a nice alcohol fullness and sting that could use some maturing.  M- Full bodied with moderate carbonation and a nice bitter dry finish.,Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,96
147,1160,thagr81us,4.2,"From 2010 Vintage. Served from bottle into a Stone nonic. Pours black with a two finger tan head that lingers for quite awhile and subsides to a minimal amount after awhile. Maintains excellent lacing throughout. The aroma was comprised of malt, coffee, chocolate, and bread. The flavor was of cream, malt, espresso, with a coffee followthrough. Upon warming up to just below room temperature there was a very strong aftertaste of bourbon associated with it. It was heavy, almost sticky, on the palate with mild carbonation. Overall this was a very nice brew from Stone. This was the first time I've gotten a chance to drink this one so it was a whole new experience for my palate. That being said, it was quite good but not what I was expecting to be #30 in the World at the time... One of my only gripes was that the followthrough of coffee was a bit harsh for my palate as I do not drink coffee, but it still didn't deter me from finishing off a bomber.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,96
147,1160,bogus564,4.33,"This baby from Stone is definitely a stout. It's extremely dark brown in color, with a big caramel-colored head that bubbles nicely for three minutes before forming a lace that stays on the glass all the way through.  The smell is very nice; there's coffee, chocolate, cream and burnt malt, with some citrus (lemon, I believe) way back there. Makes you want to dive right in.  The first and subsequent sips confirm all that you smelled; you've got your coffee, you've got your chocolate, your cream, your burnt malt and your lemon. Oh, and to add to it, you've got a hoppy, piny finish, just what you'd expect from a beer from Stone Brewery.  The mouthfeel is okay - it's medium-bodied, with good carbonation and a piny aftertaste. I really wanted a malty aftertaste, but it is what it is.  This is a good drinking beer, which I believe would go very well with a well-prepared steak. Steak and stout - I wonder if there's a better combination.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,96
147,1160,yeahnatenelson,4.15,"Anno 2010  Appearance -- Pours a very deep brown, black in the glass with mahogany highlights when the glass is swirled. One finger of khaki head that slowly dissipates.  Smell -- Very aromatic. Big roast malt notes, chocolate, dark fruit, coffee, dark fruit, earthy hops.  Taste -- Follows the nose: Char, dark chocolate, raisin, prune, and coffee. Moderate earthy hop character in the finish brings about a minty flavor. Alcohol presence certainly, but adds character rather than detracts.  Mouthfeel -- Medium to full in body with mild prickly carbonation. Mild alcohol bite, faint warming in the throat.  Drinkability -- Quite good. Great roast flavors, sweetness in moderation, and a little bit of hops in the back make for this to be a very satisfying brew. My expectations were exceeded.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,96
147,1160,RunForYourBeer,4.23,First review: Served from a bottle into a New Belgium snifter. Spring 2010 release  A: Black. No light comes through with a small tan head.  S: Some dark chocolate along with dark fruits.  T: More dark chocolate with dark fruits (raisin?). Finishes with some light bitterness and coffee flavors with some alcohol warming.  M: Thick with medium carbonation. Very good.  Very good beer overall. Only problem is drinkability due to alcohol content (10.5%) and bottle size available in my area.,Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,96

T - Tons of dark chocolate malts, bitter expresso coffee and vanilla with a slight hoppiness. Deep, rich, and delicious!  M - Nice full and creamy mouthfeel with a bit of alcohol warming towards the finish. Chewy.  D - This is an amazing RIS, and, given the availability and price, one of the best bargains around.

147,1160,JohnnyBarman,4.42,"Tall bottle picked up at Knightly Spirits in Orlando. Love the Soviet gargoyle on the label... Limited Spring 2010 release.  Poured into a Duvel goblet. An inky black hue, hard to detect any other colour but black here. Leaves an inch-high mocha head, leaving some flecks of lacing. Survives well as a ring, with a few islands drifting about.  Nose is roasted dark coffee, cream, dark chocolate (75% cocoa at least!), dark fruit. Rich and inviting.  A terrific stout, wonderful to sip. Brought to a proper temperature, this RIS achieves a wonderful balance of chocolate, toasted malt and caramel, while finishing with a slightly bitter taste accentuated with warming alcohol. First rate.  Almost syrupy, the mouthfeel of this viscous brew is greatly aided by its light, but everpresent carbonation. Oily and velvety, with a slight warming alcohol burn that affects the back of the tongue.  A terrific RIS, one of the best I've had the pleasure to enjoy. Surprisingly drinkable - the ABV is high, yes, but such a meaty stout is worthy of slow savouring.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,96
147,1160,VTaler,4.6,A - Very very dark. Head is very small though S - Smells like a chocolate cake. T - A dive into this dark retched beast I I'm surround by chocolate malts. A little bit of spiciness hits the tongue. The alcohol monster is present and it just is hiding in a deep dark cave of chocolate. It does not leave a bad taste in your mouth. It taste like creamy chocolate milk but with much more kick. M - Thick D- I could have alot,Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,96
147,1160,thetomG,3.9,2010 vintage...  Typical deep brown pour. Decent amount of dark brown head leaving minimal lacing behind. Aroma is primarily roasted malts and some slight chocolate. Flavor is very similar but the alcohol comes through a bit to liven things up. Seems just about perfectly carbonated with just the right balance between silky smooth and syrupy mouthfeel. Considering the relatively low cost and wide availability I don't know if there's a better RIS out there... Will definitely be drinking more of this.... Yum!,Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,96
147,1160,Jips,4.52,"2010 poured into an 8 oz plastic tumbler, cuz that's better than a hotel plastic cup (though GREAT straight out of the bottle too).  Poured inky black with a thin bubbly light tan head. Smells like raisins, roasted malt, a little molasses and alchy. Mouthfeel is smooth, barely a hair watery and just a little carbonation. Initial taste is heavy on the roasted malt, some coffee and chocolate, a little molasses. Aftertaste is molasses and a pleasant slight alcohol burn.  Great beer, an exemplar of the style. Buzzed after half a bomber!",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,96
147,1160,Mosstrooper,4.92,"22oz Spring 2008 vintage poured into 300ml Krusovice goblet.  Appearance: Jet-black with a medium brown head that dissipates slowly and leaves a somewhat thick ring of lace behind.  Smell: Very, very rich chocolately smell with some notes of caramel and a sligtly harsh touch from the alcohol. This smells very rich and inviting.  Taste: Very nice roasty beginning, finishing with sweet chocolate and bitter coffee notes. Also has a hint of sour alcohol. The hops from this one have probably aged away, but there is a slight hint of grassiness after the finish. Every time I burp or cough hard, it tastes like chocolate.  Mouthfeel: Thick, chewy, and creamy body with balanced carbonation and a dry finish with a bit of a warmth from the alcohol at the end. Very heavy.  Drinkability: This beer is outstanding. Easily the best stout I've had- I haven't tried this one without age, but I can imagine that the vintage brings out the rich chocolately flavor of this which is extremely enjoyable. This beer needs to be sipped and savored and probably cellared before that.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,96
147,1160,Pittsburgh,4.16,"It's funny, you drink Guinness as a young buck growing up, and you think this beer is thick, frothy, like a dinner, and awesome. Nothing could be better.  Then you roll into the world of craft beer, specifically stone craft beer, and then you realize what a real stout should be.  This is a great beer, strong as all hell, but very very good. Flavorful, so thick, so rich, its almost like motor oil.  The taste is strong, toffee and coffee flavor dominate the palate after it is taken down, very nutty. You can catch the alcohol burn in the back of the mouth, but the beer is so thick and intense, it adds to the experience. The alcohol taste is probably the biggest downfall....maybe it needed to be aged longer. I don't think it had been a year.  Drinkability, you take down a bomber of this and you are feeling it, but it is good in the sense that one pint will do you right.

A- An opaque black color with an extremely thin layer of brown head that disappears quite entirely except for a small ring around the glass. Not much lacing either.  S- Roasted malt and dark chocolate come off strong as hints of burnt coffee play an enjoyable secondary role. Towards the middle of the beer the alcohol is kicked up a notch as it finishes into a slightly weird musty smell. Not sure if this is due to oxidation, but it is slightly off putting.  T- Malty undertone along with some dark fruits start the beer for mere moments. Quite quickly the notes of dark chocolate and coffee dominate as roasted grains and the continuation of the dark fruits compliment the wallop of flavor going on. Towards the end of the beer you get a kick of alcohol, a little off putting but certainly not bad as it lingers with roasted grain, a slight bitterness, and notes of prunes.  M- A syrupy mouthfeel with little carbonation, but with the sipper this one is that's not too bad of a characteristic.  D- The alcohol in this one brings the drinkability down, but surely good for such a big beer.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,96

But then I drink it and am amazed again! For 5 years now this has been going on and everytime I drink the Stone IRS I'm in awe. This might be my all-time RIS. It has every quality I'm looking for in the style: roasted coffee, bitter chocolate, molasses, vanilla, and overall great malt sweetness.

147,1160,FeDUBBELFIST,4.07,"Stone Imperial Russian Stout, the lone IRS in a field of RIS's. Draft pour served in a 9 oz snifter for $5.50.  A: A one finger medium dark brown head becomes a thin film and chunky collar after short retention. The body is pitch black with no passage of light, even when held in front of a bright window.  S: The nose is chock full of heavily roasted chocolate and espresso malts plus some slightly meaty yeast. Additional aromas of ash and smoke, vaguely reminiscent of a campfire built of waterlogged lumber. Piney hops. A vigorous swirl brings about a nose deserving of my 4.5 rating.  T: In addition to what the nose imparts, a touch of well-conditioned leather is noticeable on the palate. Long lasting flavor. Good, but 'impressive' doesn't come to mind. The alcohol is incredibly well-hidden.  M: Full body mouthfeel with a gritty texture and prickling carbonation. The effervescence is more aggressive than most RIS's, but I view this as a positive with this particular brew since the flavors are merely baseline for the style.  D: Drinks closer to an 8.5% ABV instead of the 10.5% advertised. Pretty solid all around but I'm satisfied with one glass. I would have no problem recommending this brew to an average stout drinker.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,96

There's also a bit of chocolate, and some fruit, mainly raisins.  Tastes very much like it smells, coffee and chocolate. There is sweetness there, and a bitter hops finish. Part of the taste reminds me a bit of a rich chocolate cake. There is a lot going on here, fruit, coffee, chocolate, and flavors I can't readily identify. Been a but since I've had a beer this complex.  This is one very solid beer. It grabs your attention and won't let go.  Surprisingly drinkable considering the ABV. A very strong, solid, serious beer, yet goes down easier than others I have tried. As rich as this is, would be hard to drink a lot, but that is not a bad thing.

S - Bitter dark chocolate, cinnamon, vegetables (broccoli, in a good way?), slightly smoky, woody, earthy, everything a IMP Ruski should smell like. T - Most of the nose comes through on the tongue. Delicious, ultra-dark chocolate bitterness. A decent, almost umami undertone of dirt/shrooms. A little smoke/smoked meat as well. There is a slightly sweet malt in the background, but very subdued. Very true to the style, pleasingly not sweet stout. Very bold. M - Thick and creamy, yet a fair amount of bubbles, helping the bitterness play on the tongue. Not gummy at all.

Everything is nice, but the aroma, though complex, isn't strong out of the glass.  Flavor of this imperial stout is wonderful, a perfect blend of coffee, dark chocolate, bakers chocolate, and in the background some very slight dark fruits, with just the slightest hint of alcohol in the finish. An outstanding beer. The mouthfeel is just full enough to satisfy for the style, but not full enough that after half a glass you feel like you've eaten a full meal. Very drinkable.

Moderate carbonation and mild mocha colored head. Appearance is a deep black with some reddish hues. Not much lacing. Aroma is pretty subtle but it's very nice -- a roasted malty nut predominates along with some crisp hop and a slight estery plum. A hint of molasses and grape, it's got a light fruity thing going on in the background.  Body is wonderful, it's light and effervescent in the mouth. Extremely drinkable for such an alcoholic brew. Taste is rich, it really explodes in the mouth, and seems to have distinct waves of various flavors coming through. Initially it's a little bitter, just light and frothy and a tad phenolic. It then quickly rounds out into a rich combination of chocolates, caramels, and roasted nuts, with some apple and orange peel. Maybe a touch of black tea. It leaves the mouth with a buttery malt, more of the phenols, and a touch of that acidic orange peel. It's literally mouth watering, and my glass is getting empty quickly.

But it also has an odd, but pleasant very light note of dark fruit and almost a citric hop splash towards the finish after it warms a bit. It has a nice smooth, full body with decent carbonation, though it could be a bit more active.

Pours a very dark cola color, but is very, very black once in the glass. This beer goes down rather easy, but at 10.5 abv, i could drink one and be done. There is a chocolate milk flavor I think.

Zero light gets through this one. Gorgeous!  S: A bit of alcohol comes through on the nose, but it is balanced well with the smell of bitter chocolate and espresso. There is a very nice caramel maltiness to the aroma as well. Fantastic.  T: WOW, this is phenomenal. Dark, slightly bitter chocolate comes through and melds perfectly with the mild coffee and roasted malt flavor.  M: Interesting, the mouthfeel does not match the appearance of the beer.

147,1160,Phillyphilms,4.48,"Poured from 22 oz bottle into Chimay challice ;)  AMAZING! HOME RUN FOR STONE, AGAIN!  Different in many ways that a traditional Russian Stout but then again, Stone is much less than a traditional brewery so go figure. They jam their ""stone hops"" into this which although much less common (traditional) for a beer of this style, it works amazingly well.  Nice think black pour, amazing head for a stout of such high alcohol that hold a few fingers firm and eventually reduces into a thin layer with incredible lacing like oatmeal.  The nose is big, strong and DARK! Coffee up front with espresso and more coffee. Chocolate nibs and some nutty malt.  Taste is my favorite part of this beer however as the strong 10.5% abv is present as it envelopes your tongue in a silky coffee liner. I have heard some say it is less desirable than other RIS but I think the oddity of the hop addition and bite add to it's desirability. At least for me.  Big Heavy Body on this with enough alcohol to trick you into believing it's all carbonation. Not a party beer by any means, but a great beer with a nice piece of meat or even better the desert after that steak. I'll find this again and again and will probably rate this higher than it deserves.. but EFF IT, I LOVE IT!  RESPECT.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,96
147,1160,itfitz,4.9,"Wow -- this is one of the best-assembled Imperial Russian Stouts I've ever had.  Stone throws their signature hops into this -- at first, the idea sounds dubious, but the result is more than pleasant.  Make sure you read the back label. It's hilarious and reflects the great sense of humor that the Stone guys have. But it also gives some insight as to how and why they did what they did to this stout.  This stout is all about coffee. It pours looking like a faintly-ruby red motor oil, with a nice tan cafe-au-lait head.  The aroma is again coffee, with a bit of dark chocolate, floral hops and citrusy fruit. It's a quite-pleasing smell.  Once it hits your tastebuds, the real fun begins. Not surprisingly, coffee jumps at you, but the chocolate and roasted malt follow on quickly. It is mildly-heavy, but less so than other Russian Stouts. You won't want to drink more than 2 or 3 of these.  It finishes well, the carbonation being replaced by a velvety smoothness, and leaving a great aftertaste.  Stone has hit another home run with their version of an Imperial Russian Stout.

147,1160,wcintula,4.52,"Poured from a big ole' bomber labeled 2009 spring into a snifter.  A- Black chocolate body with very difficult to find red highlights when held to a lamp. Nice soft fluffy light chocolate brown head with good retention.  S- Predominant smells are of chocolate, roasted coffee and big malts, all around very sweet and inviting. The chocolate reminds me of a milk chocolate and I wouldn't be surprised if there's lactose in here.  T- I get all of those mentioned above and as the brew warmed up, the fruit started coming through. Black currant is mentioned on the bottle and I'm getting the taste of this bitter fruit, somewhat of a wine flavoring getting thrown into the mix.  M- Very thick, nice low carbonation. The keyword here is THICK.  D- Hell yeah baby. A very complexly flavored beer with layers upon layers. Nice stuff. enjoyed the bottle.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,96
147,1160,brewerburgundy,4,"2010 vintage, Sam Adams glass, 22oz bottle.  This is a hell of a dark Stout with the style's trademark fingernail of ruby as the only translucence. The head isn't abundant but seems to be persistent in a color close to coffee froth.  The aroma is chock full of coffee, so much so that it smells much like Founders Breakfast Stout. Dark chocolate is mingled and there are twinges of peppery hop, charcoal, and solvent.  There is a lot of coffee here too and more dark chocolate. Anise, dried cranberries, black pepper, orange oil, and alcohol fill up much of the remaining flavor. The hopping is high and great in its herbal pungency. As I said in my review of Double Bastard; I see a lot of potential here.  The carbonation just seems to emphasize the spicy hops, which I like. Slippery is the texture.  Again, like a 10.5% ABV beer can truly be drinkable? This is tasty but a decadent treat.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,96
147,1160,simpliciter,3.72,"A - dark with a tan head, looks lovely in a brandy snifter S - burnt chocolate with coffee, perfect w/ dessert T - nothing but chocolate here M - big, but light --- with wonderful bubbles D - dessert only. very hot and sweet, only ~6oz per person please",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,96
147,1160,Bendurgin,4.52,"This is from some notes during last nights abomination of a basketball game. This pours black, and gives about an inch of beautiful tan head. Good lacing. I smell fresh espresso, bittersweet chocolate and a bit of toffee. Pretty much smells like a candy shop with roasted malts kicking around. The first thing that hits my tongue is espresso and then some cocoa. It has a richness that I would think to find in maple syrup. Espresso flavors linger in the middle of the tongue. A little bit of alcohol but at 10.5, you gotta expect a little bit. Feels silky and rich in the mouth. A bit syrupy, but overall pretty amazing. Easy to drink with the 10.5 abv. A little bit of warmth from the alcohol, but it's really just enough to you let you know it's there.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,96
147,1160,sfprint,1.79,"Bought from Ledgers in Berkeley, CA.  A: It looks quite frightening actually. It poured more like tar or molasses than a beer. Little carbonation. Looks like a super dark, dense, flat cola, tar pit.  S: Unique smell, having problems identifying it exactly. Very strange. Although the bottle cap states that its 100% natural,part of the smell it has i would associate with chemicals, the other part with rubber, or rubber cement.  T: Wow, quite different from other Russian Imperial Stouts I've had. The alcohol is very strong in the taste, and it unfortunately doesn't taste very natural to me. The aftertaste is unpleasant, very bitter, like a some kind of garden weed. In the body, I do taste coffee, but it's not good coffee. Somewhat sweet.  M: Initially it goes down very smooth, but then the aftertaste creates this bizarre, mouth puckering sensation like you've consumed something potentially poisonous.  O: Bleh. Maybe I've drank this beer too soon. On the back it recommends trying it every 5-6 months, and since it was ""released"" this spring, and it's only June, maybe it wasn't the right time to drink? I will go read the other reviews now and try to see what everyone else see's in it. It's definitely disconcerting that my experience is so far different from the other reviewers here.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,96
147,1160,chalsk,4.15,"Pours a dark black color with thin off-white head and some life. Has an aroma of chocolate, caramel, and grapefruit, with hints of coffee. Sweet up front. Then a malty, velvety finish with some nice bitters on the back end. The carbonation is muted a bit, keeps it from being too syrupy though. Very good.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,96
147,1160,srvisgod88,4.09,"Appearance: The beer is just beautiful. A nice dark tone that doesn't look sloppy. You can see that it is a nice thick, heavy beer.  Smell: A little lighter than a hoped but in no way unpleasant. I found myself really needing to swirl it and sniff it several times to really pick out distinct aromas. Probably because of the higher alcohol content. Even though I had trouble picking out anything distinct, what I did smell was very pleasing.  Taste: Very good taste. The initial attack was a little sloppy but the mid palate was a beautiful caramel that finished with a mocha-coffee that was noticeable without being overwhelming and off-putting. The heat in the finish is also there but is surprisingly well hidden until you reach the bottom of the glass.  Mouthfeel: Thick and creamy. Like any good Imperial Stout should be.  Drinkability: This is not something I can have more than two or three glasses of but if I were to drink this with food I would enjoy it very much. For what it is it has all the drinkability you could realistically ask for.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,96
147,1160,Gobzilla,4.25,"A: poured a dark brown like oil with a brown finger worth of head that left good sticky lacing on the glass.  S: nice roasted malt aromas with chocolate and slight coffee accents that definitely has booziness in the mixture. I also got some creamy notes followed by some oaky vanilla.  T: oak vanilla and slight greet the palate first with chocolate, and a mild hop bite as well. The beer also has some nice roasted malts that really adds balance to the overall flavor.  M: medium body with a good amount of carbonation that is sweet and silky with a mild bitter finish.  D: pretty damn good RIS from stone considering they stick to the hop bombs. This is definitely a treat after dinner. The beer drank good and could have another bomber.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,96
147,1160,Dlish,3.88,"A- Deep oil black, pours thick, little to no head. The foam that does form is chocolate brown, looks taste.  S- heavy malts, chocolate, bit of vanilla and bourbon.  T- Taste similar to the smell but backwards. A sweet bourbon, flooding of gritty chocolate and earth-tones, there is a struggle of hop bitterness that tries to build, but is quickly taken over malts. aftertaste is mostly roasted malts. I can't tell whether there is to little or way to much going on this beer.  M- Thick, chewiness when it hits the tongue and spreads over it quickly. long last flavor in the mouth. slight burning taste from the alcohol  D- Despite its high alcohol content, its not bad for a imperial stout.  Overall i was a bit disappointed with this imperial stout, I was expecting a bit more from stone. Its not a bad Imperial stout, i just wanted more flavor.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,96

S: strong roasted malt and chocolate come to mind right of the bat, but i do detect some coffee in there. molasses maybe?  T: taste follows the smell closely. complex and well balanced.  M: as with most imperial stouts it's definitely full bodied. average carbonation.  D: again, following the repuation of an imperial stout, this is a sipper. wouldn't stray beyond the one bomber.  overall, very good but IMHO not world class. maybe my expectations were too high going in; i was expecting to LOVE it... def not on the level of a kbs or even bourbon county, in my opinion. guess i'm a sucker for the bourbon. :)",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,96
147,1160,TK5150,4,"After having the past couple vintages of this beer, I am finally deciding to rate it...2010 bottle.  A- Pours very dark brown/black with a large light brown head. Nice lacing. Looks like a pretty typical imperial stout.  S- Nice chocolate aromas with additional roasted malt, and a hint of coffee.  T- Roasted malts. A hint of coffee is there, just as in the nose. Caramel makes an appearance at the finish... a little licorice as well, hints of chocolate. Pretty tasty beer...much more balanced than the Southern Tier Mokah I had before this.  M- Fuller bodied, but more carbonation than I like to see in my Imperial Stouts. Still, this coats the mouth nicely.  D- The drinkability is good here, even with the high alcohol. One bomber would be my limit though.  Overall, it is hard to come by a widely distributed Imperial Stout that is worth picking up. A nice beer to look forward to each year. I liked 2008 a lot, hated 2009 ( I dislike a lot of 2009 versions of beers for some reason), but enjoy this years. I will probably pick up a couple of these for aging.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,96
147,1160,Echosolace,3.71,"A - I was impressed when I held this up to my monitor's light and not a single ray was shining through. Whoa. Reminds me of the World Wide Stout.  S - It's hard to catch a smell of it. It doesn't seem to throw it's sent around so much. I'd probably call it chalky actually. Maybe a little bit like dry soil. Earthy tones is an understatement.  T - A lot of toasted something. Pretty thick, and the malts are to blame. But the malt taste isn't so strong. This thing is a kicker though, plenty of alcohol. Great if you're alone... *sniff* *sniff*  M - It seems to bubble up in itself. I'm not sure whether it's because of the sugar content, but it's not so effervescent, because it just foams up and stays foamy. It's pleasant actually. I like it about this beer.  D - It'll put a bit of hair on your chest. It's definitely for a person who can enjoy a ton of character in a beer. This isn't for the normal fragile American tongue. This is the real stuff. That said, it's a bit much for a daily brew. Personally, I enjoy something a bit lighter day to day, but it's a refreshing change I'm sure a stout fan would love.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,96
147,1160,sidetracked,3.88,"Pours black with lots of light brown head. No lacing.  Smells of roasted malts, coffee, brown sugar and bitter chocolate. The roasted malts and coffee seem somewhat watered down. The aroma is a bit nutty as well.  Tastes upfront of slightly bitter roasted malts with a nutty, earthy quality. Finish is bitter coffee, unsweetened chocolate, light brown sugar. Lingering bitter and roasted coffee flavor.  Full bodied with low carbonation, but no chewiness. Slightly syrupy.  A solid example of the style, but nothing great and kind of boring.  6/6/2010",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,96

Aroma smells very roasty and inviting. Also some raisin, carmelized sugar, and chocolate notes going on.  Taste is very complex and delicious. Bitter coffee and chocolate upfront. In the middle I am getting the dark fruit taste and a hint of licorice. Also a nice amount of hop bitterness in the finish.  Mouthfeel is absolutely perfect. Silky texture that just dances on the palate. Drinkability is good for a big beer, but definately not a chugger.

S - Lots and lots of bitter dark chocolate and roasted malts. The roasted smell is quite dominant.  T - Much like the smell, there is strong hop bitterness to it which works so well with the bitter chocolate and roasted malt.  M - A full bodied beer that sticks with you. It's very creamy and goes very well with desserts.  D - I wouldn't recommend it on a hot day after work or from mowing the lawn. As a beer you relax and sip on, it's a fine wine in beer form.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,96
147,1160,Chico1985,4.72,"One of my top RIS's for sure. I had this fresh twice last year but for this review I am reviewing a 2008 bomber, so this is aged 2 years.  Pours black with a modest 1-finger tan head even on an aggressive pour. Carbonation has probably been knocked down a bit due to the age. Turns to a ring and leaves some lacing.  Lots of malt, coffee and dark fruits from the nose. Alluring to say the least.  Taste is of the pure RIS variety I have come to know and love. I can taste the decadence! Lots of flavors - roasted malt, black coffee, licorice, flashes of plum and raisin. Booze is a highlight here rather than a bother, well-hidden for 10.8%. Definitely less hot than when fresh. A surprising amount of sweetness for a stout so evil and robust. The dark fruit comes out more as it warms, along with dark chocolate and vanilla. Amazing.  Mouthfeel is excellent, thickness, carbonation, and alcohol taste are at a great level. Balance is awesome.  Very drinkable and enjoyable, bomber is not a problem. Pretty good price for the quality too. Stouts don't need to be barrel-aged to be great, this is undeniable proof.  **4/13/11 - more notes**  Thoroughly enjoying a 2008 (3 years old) 12 oz right now. This beer is only improving with age...basically a dark chocolate/dark fruit/licorice bomb of awesomeness with really no alcohol bite. Drinking super great right now, happy to have alot of this vintage especially.  **4/27/13 - more notes**  2008 bomber, 5+ years old! This beer rules, period. Awesome vintage. Carbonation is definitely sinking but such a good, deep beer, lots of character. Lots of dark fruit chocolatey-ness. Easy drinking, unique. Had this next to fresh 2013+2013 Espresso versions - all great but this blew em away.  **3/17/15 -- even more notes**  Happy St. Patrick's Day, still going on these '08s, 7 years old now. Ridiculously easy-drinking and subdued (in a good way). Kinda just like viscous chocolate cigar box licorice substance with really no alcohol. Still some light carbonation.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,96

Maybe a little bit of dark fruit, but other than that, not much else.  T: Again, big coffee and chocolate presences abound. Dark fruits as well. Yeasty bread makes its way to the surface, too.

A- big roasted malts and coffee. Some booze are present and a hint of black licorice.  T- roasted malts and coffee are in charge. The malts have a touch of char to them. The licorice I got in the nose, is more prevelant here. The booze are a little hot and there is a bit of hops present in the finish. As it warms there is a fig or raisin that really comes out. The flavors really become more complex at room temperature.  M- on the fuller side of medium. Not as thick as I was expecting but in no way is it light. The carbonation is on the lower side which I prefer in stouts.  D- I enjoyed sipping on this one. I took my time with it. I drank the whole bomber solo over an hour.

The appearance was deep black with a really foamed up brown head. As the glass settled they maintained some patches of bubbles. Nose was roasted malts, coffee, bakers chocolate, and a twinge of hops. Taste was more of the same with the hops and currant being more prominent than in the bottle, and in a way that was less pleasant for me.

147,1160,klikger,4.32,"2008 through 2010 vertical courtesy of BenC, an BA, hot sauce aficionado, and generally good bloke.  A - Each year's pour is dark brown, with a small bit of brown head and not much lacing.  S 2008 - Tobacco, raisin, and vanilla 2009 - Booze, vanilla, and dark fruits 2010 - Coffee, roasted malts  T 1st impressions: 2008 - Chocolate malt balls, molasses, and toffee 2009 - Vanilla, bourbon, milk chocolate 2010 - Roasted coffee, molasses, dark chocolate, and a slightly piny, bitter finish  Overall, the 2008 stole the show for me. It wasn't nearly as sweet as the 2009 (the only chink in the latter's armor...great beeer), and the scents and flavors invoked elements of my favorite old ales. The 2009 was the most distinctive, with a lot of bourbon flavor mixed with the other sweet flavors noted above. The 2010 tasted strongly of dark-roast coffee and had more hops, as expected, but it wasn't as complex as the earlier years. I have some in the basement and will look forward to trying it again in three to six month intervals.  M 2008 - Not much carb, a bit syrupy 2009 - Standing next to the other two, the sugars in this are prominent and impact the mouthfeel. Boozy. 2010 - Lighter than the former years' offerings. A fair amount of carbonation.  D 2008 and 2010 are very drinkable, with the 2009 lagging slightly behind.  I was impressed with the differentiation here. The 2008 &gt; 2009 &gt; 2010, but they're all good. This is an awesome RIS, and, for the price, it's second to none.

One finger head burns away to not much of anything. No lacing to speak of.  S - Dark chocolate, coffee, and alcohol. The coffee comes through more at room temperature.  T - Tons of dark chocolate as the nose implies, not as much coffee as I would've thought. The alcohol is not as strong as I thought it would be, and hints of vanilla and black cherry in the finish. Delicious. This is what I keep coming back for.  M - Thick, velvety, and oily. Chewy in the way that I would hope most stouts would be.  D - Surprisingly high. I've had three bombers in a night before and not had a problem. The flavor keeps me wanting to have another sip and doesn't wear on me.

The cloudless sky illuminated a finger of light mocha head (I seem to remember the bottle having a darker head? No?). Just the hint of a breeze ruffled the cap until it receded into a thin collar around the edges. No lace.  S: As I listened to the chirping birds and the chatter of tanned, beautiful people, I enjoyed the wafting aromas of roast, coffee, chocolate, anise, nuts, and just a touch of dark fruit. Luckily, the aroma wasn't overwhelmed by the beautiful foliage of the beer garden.  T: Roast- and coffee-forward. I prefer more chocolatey stouts, but this isn't exactly lacking in that department. Dark chocolate accentuated by a touch of plum. I pick up anise and a nutty character in the finish. The aftertaste brings out roast again. As I sipped on this, I reflected on how wonderful it is to live in California's perennial springtime.  M: My face baked to a light honey color and my serotonins stimulated by the tanning, I swirled this in my mouth and reflected on what a pleasure it is to drink. Thick, chewy, flavorful. Carbonation is appropriately low, though it does result in a coating feel (something that hampers drinking a full glass, I feel).  D: I'm glad it's easily available at a reasonable price. I usually buy several bottles of each year.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,96
147,1160,Naugros,4.23,"This stout is jet black with a brown head that leaves lace behind in bands as you drink. The head eventually settles to a thin layer of foam. At this point it could pass visually as espresso.  Roasted malts, coffee and smoke in the nose. I expected some alcohol smell at 10.5% but it isn't here, so I'll look for it in the taste.  Wrong again! The alcohol is very well masked. There is only a slight burn on the palate, barely detectable. The roast and coffee continue on in the taste as smoky elements attack the sides of your tongue. There is also a slight hint of toffee on the tongue. I detect very little by the way of hops. There is some bitterness but it's hard to discern if that's from the roasted malt or from the hops making their presence known. Knowing Stone, it's the hops.  A medium body with the appropriate amount of carbonation. I'd prefer a cleaner wash, but this is a stout after all.  Very drinkable for an Imperial Russian Stout, but without losing any boldness. These could be dangerous on cool autumn evenings. Luckily it's nearly summer and I'll want something lighter next.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,96

The aroma is complex but light with hints of licorice, horehound, caramelized pecans, grape jelly and toast, and an earthy/woodsy/musty scent.  The flavors match the nose, with the caramelized pecans and licorice leading the way, it has dark red wine undertones.  Everything is right on with the mouthfeel. Medium to heavy body, thick, warm, and coating. It has a deep dry finish.  One fine sipper! Bang for the buck this blows most beers in this class away!

A full bodied nicely carbonated brew with a warm finish. Yeah this brew drinks like it belongs in the top 100.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,96
147,1160,DovaliHops,4.58,"Poured this into a tulip glass about a month after its 2010 release. Big, frothy, silky tan head on this one. Black as night. Smells very roast with a pleasant chocolate scent. Tastes like dark chocolate with toasty dark fruits as well. This one is a little boozy, but I expected that. I have 4 others that I'm gonna age to allow to mellow out. The mouthfeel is amazing on this, and drinkability isn't too bad considering such high ABV. The drinkability will only get better as this one gets older. Very good imperial stout.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,96
147,1160,spoons,4.08,"From a bomber to a tulip. just below room temp.  Color is very dark black. Can't see through it at all. A good coffee colored head that fades to a ring pretty quickly.  Smells gently roasted. A mild soy sauce smell as well. A mild coffee note.  Tastes is sweet and gently bitter, not that harsh roasted barley bitterness. Super smooth and has a nice coffee like flavor. Great aftertaste.  I'll drink this again. I would definitely like to see a nice bourbon barrel aged version made with such a fine imperial stout as its base. Delicious",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,96
147,1160,mstyne,4.25,"Bomber from Beverage Mart on NY 66. ""Limited Spring 2010 Release""  Pours ink black and thick, with a thin tan head. Aroma is amazing; chocolate, coffe, malt, everything you could hope for in a stout.  It's hard for me to pinpoint individual flavors; this is a fairly complex brew -- at least to me. Very similar to the scent, coffee, chocolate, and a bit of bitterness. A great beer from one the US's premier breweries.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,96
147,1160,bigfnjoe,4.35,"Poured from a 1L growler into a pint glass. Growler was filled off a nitro tap.  A- Pours black with a very creamy looking, 3 finger brown head. Head fades rather quickly but leaves some very nice lacing.  S- Roasted malts, a hint of chocolate, and a whole lot of coffee...it smells amazing. Heaven on earth.  T- I'm mostly getting coffee, with faint undertones of chocolate. There is a slight alcohol taste to it as well...quite lovely.  M- This is heavy. A little syrupy. The nitro gives it a creaminess though...theres a smoothness there that helps balance everything out.  D- Everything but the alcohol makes this super drinkable...if it wasn't so strong, you could easily pound back a few of these. But because of that underlying alcohol flavor...eh, gotta hold back a little bit",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,96
147,1160,jdense,4.42,"22 oz. bottle from John's Marketplace PDX shared with beer buddy poured into Chimay chalices.  Black opaque body, no visible carbonation due to dark color, brownish tan head, quick dissipation, with good layer of lacing running down the glass. Nose is big coffee hit with C hop finish with good caramel malt presence. Taste is more coffee than chocolate, good noble hoppy presence, not picking up the anise and black current notes mentioned on bottle description, though I picked up hints once the bottle warmed up a bit. Mouthfeel fairly full good effervescence. While this is a tasty beer, there was very noticeable alcohol heat, so I'm sure the drinkability will go up after several months of cellaring this 2010 vintage.  Edit- ""Had"" to pop the early Spring 2010 vintage from cellar, poured into HOTD tulip. Nice and chocolatey,coffee notes are now fairly subtle, hops have mellowed a bit and the alcohol is well hidden. Not sure this will drink much better in the future, it's really good right now.

147,1160,bump8628,3.78,"Pitch black with a mocha colored head.  I'm immediately greeted with some hot alcohol esters and some milder fruity esters. As I continue to delve into the beer a whole spectrum of roasted malt flavors reveals themselves. Lots of dark cocoa, hints of high-quality coffee, and even a little smoke. Hops are there, but aren't in the forefront. What they contribute is an earthy, balancing bitterness.  A nice Imperial Stout. Next time I'll go with a bottle and hold onto it for few years to mellow the heat.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,96
147,1160,pastradul,4.55,"Had this on tap at K&B wine cellar.  I haven't had this beer on draft or in a bottle for a while now. It was great to revisit an old favorite.  Poured into a snifter. Has a nice .5"" head on it that is a creamy coffee brown.  The aroma is just amazing. (I can defenitly tell my palat has evolved a bit since the last time I have had this beer) So much coffee present in the nose with a slight malt back bown.  The mouthfeel is not to heavy and syrupy but just enough carb to help cut it a bit.  The taste is so great. Lots of strong coffee notes going around the mouth in the front of the mouth and followed with the malt starting to take over. a nice heavy malt follows then the alcohol warmth finishes the beer! A very drinkable IRS!

147,1160,silver0rlead,4.3,"Pours an impenetrable black with a thick cola colored head that retains surprisingly well, this one is a real looker. The aroma is also impressive, with notes of dark chocolate, espresso, dark fruits, dirt, burnt bread, citrusy hops, molasses and a hint of alcohol. The flavor has some roastiness upfront, along with gourmet dark chocolate, black coffee, dark fruits (plum and date), burnt bread, piney hops, and a touch of alcohol. The mouthfeel is rich without being overbearing, and drinkability is excellent for the style. Overall an extremely good interpretation of the style, without going overboard on the hops or the roastiness.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,96

Takes a bit to calm down for drinking.  Mouth feel is great. Its rich and silky and syrupy.  Roasted dark chocolate malts work well with the mouth feel. Bitter hops at the front, with nutty coffee hint with smokey vanilla, chicory, and a smoothly and ultimately dry finish.  I could only taste a little bit of the 10.5% alcohol but after finishing the bottle, I am positive it was in there.  Awesome RIS. Stone is still spot on.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,96
147,1160,voteforgoat,4.35,"2008 IRS drinking it in 2010, split.  A- dark dark, small tan head. mild carbonation  S - hops, malt, roast, coffeeish, some other stuff too!  T - oooh yeah! very nice. roast and coffee taste upfront. very hoppy. Smoother, less hot than the 2010 I recently had, and with a fuller body. Great sipping beer. Seems to reveal other dimensions as you imbibe the drink over time. As it warms up, it sweetens. Cannot taste the alcohol - it's very, very well hidden. Beware!  M- good, enjoyable, feels thicker than other stouts I've had.  D - very big, bold flavor. would not want to drink this all night. One or two small glasses would be fine. This also packs a wallop in terms of alcohol. Wow, after 8 oz of this beer, I'm feeling the buzz and have not detected any alcohol.  Stouts ( and their bigger imperial cousins) is one the styles I rarely pick up, but I might be more inclined now. Imperial russian stouts and american barley wines seem to share some attributes: bold, strong hop flavors , big malts ( more so with stouts) and thick mouthfeel . this is from my overall still limited experience with stouts. Quite enjoyable, but the strong, roasty flavors probably hold me back from enjoying stouts as often as barley wines. I don't seek it out roasty flavors..but again, I think this might require some ""studying"".  I feel there's a difference between the 2010 and 2008 ( the older beer clearly winning out) though I am not drinking both side to side. Again, study is required.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,96

Probably ranks in my top 5 beers at this point.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,96
147,1160,weatherdog,3.65,"On tap at Brixies in Brookfield Il, served in a 12oz. snifter  It pours a pitch black with a dense light mocha head that lingered for a minute or two before disappearing. As the liquid level lowers medium lacing is stuck to the sides of the glass.  The nose is exploding with deep roasted coffee with a compliment of chocolate. It just borders between a deep roast and burnt for my taste. I'm also picking up a little pine type hop aroma at the end.  Coffee flavors dominate the flavor much like the nose. The flavor is just over the line in terms of having a distinct roasted grain flavor but isn't so burnt that it makes the beer unpalatable. Not much chocolate in the flavor but alcohol in the backend is a large component. This is my first time having this beer and I can see why people rave about aged versions.  The carbonation is much too high and distracting from a smooth mouthfeel. It finishes pretty dry which I much prefer over a sweet finish in RIS' Drinkability is ok but not great mostly due to the high carbonation. If I let this one sit for 30 minutes to an hour I bet it would improve.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,96
147,1160,stakem,4.5,"Vintage 2007 presented in the form of a brown swing top 2 liter growler that was filled at the Warwick hotel during the Stone takes over the Warwick event. The event took place on 4/9 and this review is from notes taken the following weekend of 4/16 when the growler was shared with those who could not make the event.  The growler surprisingly enough opened with a very resouding thud. I was worried that the growler fill might have left this brew a little flat when compared to the draft version but to much excitement that wasn't the case.  Poured into a Stone pint glass, it appears a very dark brown to black color with a darkly tanned head that doesn't retain all too well. Nose is bitter smelling roasted malts with chocolate sweetness and a slight touch of soy sauce blended with coffee. Rounding out the aroma is some citrus hops and alcohol. Taste is a big malty sweet monster of a brew laden with alcohol and notes of bitterness from both hops and burnt grains (that also exhibit the flavors of coffee and bitter dark chocolate.) There is a residual sweetness that lingers tasting almost like dark fruits that blends with the alcohol laden dark chocolate and coffee that makes this dangerously drinkable and quite smooth. Medium bodied and lightly carbonated this vintage was a real sweet and alcohol burning treat. As it warms, there are notes of licorice coming through with the ever increasing alcohol presence that was previously hidden by the malt sweetness.  I've had this brew a number of times in varying years and serving types. They have always been an enjoyable experience with their own unique characteristics. While fresh this brew is quite bitter but time let's it smooth out and become a little more sweet (like this example.)",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,96

Although I have had this beer a number of times fresh, in the past, I have heard it is supposed to be even better with age, so I'm giving it a try. Pours a deep, impenetrable black, topped off with a thick dark brown head which quickly recedes. Aromas of roasted malt, strong, bitter coffee and dark chocolate. Flavors of black licorice, roasted malt, dark chocolate and smoke. Silky smooth and very good.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,96

A - Black as black can be with a small tan head resting on top. The head isn't all that big but what little is there won't go away.  S - Chocolate, vanilla, caramel with a hint of booze. Pretty standard aroma for a RIS.  T - Really smooth. The flavors follow the nose with a little bit more of a dark chocolate/vanilla flavor at the end. I wish it had a little bit more roastiness but this has a solid flavor profile.  M - Pretty thick body but not quite as thick as some other RIS's. Very little carbonation.  D - Really easy to drink especially for a 10.5% beer.

Lush and round Mexican chocolate on the palette with apparent but not overwhelming alcohol and a lingering but not cloying finish. To be honest, that may be among the most appealing qualities of this beer, the degree to which the alcohol is integrated. Having tried a number of other recently released high-octane stouts (KBS, Rasputin Oak aged) this one is showing much better right now.  Really a remarkable beer. I only even gave it less than perfect marks on appearance because this was my first review and I wasn't exactly sure what made up an ""exceptional appearance""",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,96

No light thru the glass, very black in color. First inhale off the head was of sweet mocha coffee. Taste was exactly what I smelled finishing with a light alcohol taste just enough to remind me that it's a beer and not a coffee drink. Mouthfeel was very full not as heavy as expected by looking at it.

147,1160,augustgarage,4.47,"2010 Vintage. Poured from a 22oz bomber into my Bruery tulip.  Inky cavernous wall of liquid topped with a light frosting and slightly thicker collar of desert sand foam. Light lacing and thin oily legs.  Big aggressive aromatics - chicory, roast coffee, fennel, licorice or maybe light molasses, brown butter or possibly toasted brazil nuts, and a hint of dark fruit (figs, prunes?).  Quite roasty, and full of esters suggesting cocoa-dusted raisins. Lots of flavor, but primarily bready; I keep waiting for the other shoe to drop mid-palate, i.e. a heady dose of hops, but it never comes. Stone has stuck with a classic recipe here and resisted stamping it with their signature muscular over-dose of ingredients. Well done. There is a lingering sweetness, but the roast helps slowly dry out the finish. No diacetyl, and clean despite a hint of char.  Lush, rich, chewy, and full-bodied without being overly thick. Moderate carbonation with perhaps the faintest astringency. Alcohol is rather well concealed.  Powerful, yet compared to all the massive RIS out there, this is almost delicate.  While excellent on its own, this would be a superior addition to a BBQ marinade as well.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,96
147,1160,TheJollyHop,4.45,"2008 Vintage 8oz pour at Stone's Vertical Tasting  On draft with no head. Deeply black with no noticeable hues, leaving me curious as to what flavors may be lurking in the viscous depths of the tulip glass.  Smoke on the first whiff couple with alcohol; oh yeah this is a monster. Dark chocolate and coffee follow up and some sweetness; possible molasses. Definitely one of the best noses on an IRS I have had the pleasure of smelling.  Chewy and completely palate enveloping. The syrupy goodness just grips your mouth and doesn't have any intention of letting go. My taste buds pick up some dried plums and cherries, and the alcohol warming is noticeable but the smokiness does a decent job of covering some of it up. Bitterness bursts early but is quickly replaced by a sweet malt backbone. Very well balanced with some age.  The balance and interplay of flavors; smoke, roasted barley, sweet dried fruit and pleasant bitterness make for a great drinking experience. A pleasure to the last drop.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,96
147,1160,AndyAvalanche,5,"This beer is crazy excellent. Poured a 12oz. (2008 spring release) bottle into a Sam Adams Perfect Pint Glass. Completely opaque, black the whole way through. Has a dark foamy head, close to a coffee or chocolate milk color. The head actually has a couple levels of darkness to it. It's darker the closer it is to the liquid. Not quite, but almost has the nitro looking effect to it. The head sticks around for a little while than provides some lacing to it. It's truly a great looking beer.  The smell is equally excellent, it has a great aroma to it. Bittersweet chocolate and darker roasted coffees. I would say a bit more chocolate than coffee, but they complement each other extremely well. It's very malty and the hops are noticeable, but not overbearing by any means. I've found some RIS's to have just a burned malt smell and taste, but this almost has a toasted aroma and taste to it. If you're really looking for it you can smell a hint of alcohol, but it's gotta be at room temperature, can't really notice it otherwise. No complaints about the smell at all.  Wow does this beer taste great, completely on par with the smell. The sweet and bitter flavors complement each other absolutely perfectly. Starts off sweet and has a clean, smooth, slightly bitter finish. For such a high ABV, you don't really taste the alcohol, which seems like it could be a little dangerous. As mentioned with the smell, it has more of a toasted flavor from the malts than a burned taste. Light hop flavor at the end, burps up nice too. This beer is perfectly balanced with all flavors, as close to flawless as I've ever had.  It's full bodied but for the amount of flavors its not as thick as one would expect. Silky, smooth, with a clean bitter finish. By far the most drinkable RIS I've ever tasted.  Have two more 2008s about five 2009s and a 2010, so don't be surprised if I make some edits to this one. But just go out and get this beer, it's been a personal favorite for several years, I'm glad I finally took the time to review it!",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,96
147,1160,EnVinoVeritas,4.4,"Russian Imperial Stout - 2010 Spring - served from 22 oz. bottle into snifter.  A - Black as night, jet black, with half finger brown head and good lacing. Light-medium carbonation.  S - Heavy toasted malts and chocolate with definitive coffe/espresso notes.  T - Like 90% cacao dark chocolate. Bold toasted malt flavor with some light hoppiness on the initial taste. Malty sweetness holds throughout but finishes nice and dry. Lingering chocolatey aftertaste and slight alcoholic warmth. Well balanced, not cloying.  M - Amazingly smooth for a high gravity IRS. Definitely not a session beer, but highly viscous on the tongue but not syrupy.  D - Fits the style well - this would be a great after dinner/dessert brew that will function as coffee and rich chocolate all rolled into one. I haven't tasted any of the earlier vintages, but this is one I would be happy to revisit again given the opportunity.

Smell: Got a huge whiff of this as I was pouring about two feet away from my nose. Bold coffee, dark chocolate, roasted malts, and a faint sting of alcohol.  Taste: Espresso, burnt malt, dark chocolate, slight alcohol burn on the swallow.  Mouthfeel: More medium bodied than heavy, very smooth.  Drinkability: Such a great beer that I've routinely overlooked year over year.

147,1160,SanAnMan,4.73,"2010 edition, on tap at the local Flying Saucer, served in a standard snifter glass.  A - can complete lack of color be described as a color? Pure jet black ebony, no light at all anywhere. Not even a laser pen could cut through this sucker. Exquisite onyx goodness.  S - burnt cocoa, wood, and deep malt notes combine for a sugary yet bitter nose. Reminds me of smelling the embers of a fireplace combined with carmelized candy sugar.  T - like a fine Swiss dark chocolate, mellow yet bold at the same time. Sweetness from the malts on the back of the tongue balances out an undertoned hoppiness up front. A bit dry, but makes you want to come back for more.  M - slick and smooth, the heat of the 10.5 ABV speaks volumes here. Meant to be slowly sipped and savored. The chocolate notes make this to be a great close to a session.  D - I'll admit to being a bit predisposed to Stone's IRS, as I still have two bottles of the 09 version cellaring in the fridge. But for fans of a great IRS, Stone really sets the bar high with their offering. This is an annual selection I really look forward to trying. Great beer from a fantastic brewer.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,96
147,1160,phiberoptik,4.28,"Thanks to billinlafayette for this one as a bonus in a trade. Bottled in mid-2008 so it had a bit of age to it.  It pours night black with no light translucence. The head is a cocoa brown and maybe 1/2"" thick in a pint glass. I purposely spread this tasting out over 2 hours to see how it developed as it warmed. Thank goodness because by room temp it was perfect!  I didnt catch much of an aroma from this beer from the pour other than some heavily roasted malts. Maybe because it has a couple years of age to it and was fridge cold, but nothing hit me in the nose like a fresh beer usually will. As it warmed I caught a lot of bitter chocolate, anise, and alcohol in the nose and it really started to open up.  Lots of dark chocolate and anise in the taste. Roasted malts of course and ALCOHOL. There is no hiding the 10.5 ABV in this one. It lets your throat in on the secret almost instantly. This beer is for sipping and enjoying. Its like a fine brandy or cognac... I had no issues taking 2 hours to drink it.  Mouthfeel is smooth, silky, with a hint of sting from the ABV. A little bitterness at the end with the anise.  Highly drinkable, but only one per sitting. I couldnt drink multiples but maybe others could.

147,1160,therica,4.47,"The 2010 offering (also their 10th Anniversary of brewing this beer, says the bottle). Another fantastic offering from the always great Stone.  A= almost black with a slight reddish hue when held to the light; modest tan head dissipates quickly to modest rimming then little lacing.  S= hefty nose of smoke, well-toasted dark malts, some prune, lots of complexity, hops florals evident. Some dark dry chocolate evident after it warms a little.  T= very hefty stuff, toasted dark malts, slight sweetness but also dry from the malts, enough hops to carry it, hardly a trace of the 10.5% ABV which is great (tired of feeling like I'm drinking a high ABV beer that tastes like it was dosed with a shot). Some nice burnt chocolate which is more evident as the carbonation dissipates. Light green hops evident after it sets for a short while.  M= very nice mix of dry bitterness and light sweetness, hops, plentiful flavors to savor.  D= as much as one can tolerate until the ABV% catches up. And it's not cheap, about triple the price of a good craft per ounce. But well worth a few bottles!  Would make a great dessert beer, especially with chocolate mousse or Bavarian Chocolate cake.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,96
147,1160,iD9,4.35,"Served in my awesome Cal Poly glass stein.  Appearance: Medium-dark tan head. From the appearance I would have thought it would diminish quickly but its sticking around incredibly well. Completely opaque in every dimension. Just the slightest sliver of reddish, chestnut brown dances around the bottom edge of the glass. Good stuff.  Smell: Deep roasted malts, dark coffees, chocolatey goodness (and maybe just a hint of boozey bourbon?). Although not unique from other RIS I've had it is exceptionally well balanced and smells excellent. Can't wait to get started.  Taste: ""Yum"" is really the only word I have for this brew. Very good in all measures and expertly balanced. My only qualm with this beer (and its almost not worth mentioning) is that it is nothing terribly unique. This beer is, in every way, a paragon of the RIS style. Delicious.  Mouthfeel: Deep, smooth and creamy yet not overly heavy. The only way I can describe this beer is that it is a textual pleasure to drink as well as a tasty one.  Drinkablity: In situations like this, I can only assume that (should the beer gods ever grace us with their penultimate brew) there is or will be a beer with better drinkability at some undetermined moment in the future. As such I would like to give this beer a 4.895 but I'll settle for the 4.5 since giving out 5.0s frightens me.  Overall, an exceptional brew. I have never been a big fan of Stone brewery.

I had both on tap and out of the bottle, and I was a little more impressed when sipping it out of the bottle.  The appearance is black as can be as you would expect with a deep colored brown head. The smell is sweet and full of alcohol. The drinkability of this one is out of this world, and the full body of the beer blends so well with the deep tastes of chocolate, molasses, and roasted barley. For 10.5% this one goes down smooth.

147,1160,Foxtrot,4.87,"5/11/2010  Alright. Its been more than 1 year since I've enjoyed Stone's IRS, and wanted to re-review it. My palate has changed a lot, and was just curious to see if the score change.  Bomber to snifter. Pours blackest obsidian with no brown/amber hues around the edges. Head was of dark brown sugar, with decent retention. The legs of this beer are also pretty wild to look at. Thick and viscous like a fine scotch or bourbon.  Now onto the aroma, and what a pleasant aroma at that. The aroma is incredibly multi-faceted with chocolate, caramel, and molasses being the most notable components while vanilla and espresso heightens the olfactory experience. Also detected a touch of alcohol, but its a 2010 bottle.  The ultimate test; taste. I hardly use any harsh language but F&*@! this beer is unbelievable! Flavors to note first off are chocolate, rich and dark, molasses, toffee, raisins, ripest cherries, and brown sugar. Mid palate is a real treat; currants, licorice, and some roasted char really linger and add to the sweetness at the front end. The contrast from sweetness to bitterness is phenomenal, and subtle. Finish is nice and long as to be expected of the style, but the aftertaste really makes it a pleasure to enjoy in between sips.  Mouthfeel is just about the silkiest and smoothest I've come across in my beer career. The carbonation levels are spot on for the style. Just enough to lift the flavors off your tongue, but not too much to hide it's subtleties. Big and bold and smooth are the three words that come to mind.  This is a hot beer, but being a 2010 bottle, it is still immensely drinkable. This beer is a sipper of the highest echelon, and should be enjoyed with a good snifter and chocolate to really make this beer pop.  P.S. I loved this beer the first time I reviewed it, but having it now feels like I'm doing this beer more justice. I thoroughly enjoyed this beer and will absolutely buy a case to cellar. Stone, this is a mighty good RIS.  --- 2/14/2009  4.5/4.5/5/5/4.5  Breaking in the new snifter with this beer  Poured a absolutely jet black with no light discoloration around the edges. Nice foamy tan head dissipated after a few minutes from pour.  Lots of notes of chocolate and dark malts with some very very ripe cherry scents and of brown sugar.  Tastes of bitter chocolate are every present, with dark fruits taking a back seat. Mellows out with double doses of molasses and caramel to make this Russian Imperial Stout absolutely fantastic. Finishes very smooth with good carbonation throughout.  Mouthfeel was near syrup. Coats the entire mouth with a slick and smooth goodness that is very typical of the style.  A good drinkability factor, besides the liver loving 10.8% ABV it is one beer that I will be sure to keep an eye on.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,96
147,1160,Huhzubendah,4.1,"Nearly opaque. Deep and ominous black. Nice tan head that sticks around for a few minutes and leaves a decent coating in it wake.  Toffee, cocoa, roasted malt, rich dark chocolate, alcohol.  Extremely rich. There are a lot of great complexities in this brew, as noted in the aroma. It's very rich and delicious, however it's also a bit hot. The alcohol, particularly in the finish, is a bit forward. This is a fresh bottle, brewed Spring 2010. I can definitely see how this beer would greatly benefit from a few years of proper cellaring.  Shockingly smooth (at first). Leaves a nice coating around the palate. Warming alcohol finish, which gets harsher as you progress through the bottle.  Alcohol becomes more and more evident as I continue to sip. This would be a good beer to split, perhaps several ways. I had trouble making it through the bomber by myself.  Notes: I understand that this beer improves with age, but so do a lot of beers. I just don't understand why this beer has such a high rating.

Smells or rich, roasted malts along with some chocolate and espresso. As expected taste is roasty and chocolaty with some hints of espresso. Taste is surprisingly bitter, a little too bitter. As it warms things get a little smoother. Drinkability is surprisingly high with this one. I can't think of another stout this robust I could drink all day were it not for the 10.5% abv.

147,1160,ChadQuest,4.05,"Roasty and thick, just the way i like em about sums up this Imperial Russian Stout for me, it has alot of roasted malt that verge but don't quite get into coffee territory, although the aroma does have quite the coffee smell to it. there is alot of bittersweet cocao that compliments the roasty notes wonderfully, and a very light alcohol on the finish that is enjoyable. There is a subtle sweet side tucked inside of this beer, caramel is dominate on the sweet side with a touch of vanilla powder. I love how thick this is, this is how a RIS should be, viscous and almost sludgy, and yet there is still a decent amount of carbination spreading the flavors around the pallete. great RIS.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,96
147,1160,homebrew311,4,"Glad to see this one in Chicago, been wanting to try this brew for a long time now. Poured in to my Stone Levitation tulip.  A: pours inky black, zero light passage, 1 finger dark brown head on pour, dissipates to a thin film of bubbles that linger on the surface of the beer  S: huge roasted barley character along with some licorice, molasses, nuttiness, and some noticeable alcohol. There is also a decent hop bite on the tail end of the aroma  T: the front features dark chocolate and molasses which is then followed by a sizable earthy hop character. The roasted barley comes through on the finish along with some booziness. The taste doesn't have quite as much roasted character as the smell would suggest. This is well balanced nonetheless and would probably benefit from a year or two of age  MF: very thick, almost chewy texture, medium carbonation- seems a tad higher than necessary  D: another solid brew from Stone- really liking the fact that they began distributing to Chicago. Looking forward to trying this after some time in the cellar.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,96

Decision made in a heartbeat, and that bottle went home with me.  Upon opening the brew, the air was filled with cocoa and coffee waves of aroma. As I poured it, the anticipation was overwhelming.  Appearance: Rich dark, black coffee color with a one finger dark tan head.  Aroma: Incredible mocha-like tones. Almost felt like I holding a hot chocolate.  Mouthfeel: Exquisitely silky, or maybe more like drinking velvet.  Taste: Chocolate and coffee with a right hop bitterness. The high alcohol (10.5%) was almost entirely hidden except for comfortable warm on the back palette.

The qualities in this beer really balance and enhance over time, but for the sake of simplicity I will review the current year version. I have also found that the last three years of this beer have been very similar so it's pretty consistant for each current year's version. Pours a deep, thick black body with kakhi head that's about half a finger thick. Smells of coffee, roasted malt, chocolate malt and bitter dark malt flavors. Some subtle hops and some cocoa ring out as well. Taste deep dark chocolates and roasted barley. Coffee bitterness builds as you sip it and the warm roasted caramel notes ring out as the temperature builds. A smooth but powerfull finish that's heavy on dark malts and mocha. A thick mouthfeel that isn't over powering.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,96

Very complex and blended, cocoa, roasted malts, coffee, earthy hops, and toffee.  Mouthfeel is smooth, thick and creamy. Medium to high level of carbonation, higher than a lot of RISs.

Aroma-Roasted black and chocolate malts with some dark roasted coffee beans and a touch of solvent alcohol.  Taste-A dark malty molasses-like sweetness upfront followed by some dark fruity flavors reminiscent of prunes or plums, a taste of char and black licorice follows rounding out the sweetness with some bitterness. A bitter-sweet chocolaty flavor mingles in and out providing a base for the other flavors to rest on.  Mouthfeel-Thick, syrupy, rich; a classic well-crafted RIS consistency.

S: Very complex scent including mocha, licorice, and a little smoke.  T: Very complex. The smoke and mocha are both present, also a little hoppy. mmm!  M: Full bodied. More carbonation than I expected, but not in a bad way.  D: No beer of this style and ABV comes to mind as more drinkable.  All-in-all, a top-notch beer, worthy of its ranking.

S: The nose is excellent! Milk chocolate and cocoa with dark fruit and brewers licorice aromas in there as well. Maybe a bit of citrus from the hops.  T: The taste is full of dark fruit, cocoa, and licorice. The beer gets sweeter as it warms and has a molasses taste to it. It has a lot of roasty bitterness on the finish and a slight hop flavor in there as well.  M: The feel is creamy but on the medium side of full bodied. This could be a bit thicker but it's definitely not thin.  D: Great flavors make me wish I would have put away a few more. The ABV is high enough to kill the drinkability though. Still this should be in your fridge when it's released every year.  I tried this last year and thought it was a bit too hoppy/bitter...the age has done this beer very well.

147,1160,AJacob81,4.5,"Had this as the tail end of a semi-epic tasting with my brother-in-law including Bourbon County Coffee and 2010 Dark Lord. This more than held its own, which is a high compliment. My BCCS review is already up, look for the DL review sometime later. Anyway, back to Stone's wonderful IRS...  Poured into an oversized wine glass.  A - Dark, deep brown-black, a small amount of light penetrates, but not enough to significantly downgrade. A very attractive dark tan head of about a finger forms, and sticks around as burnt creme brulee floating on the surface.  S - The nose is of roasted malt, some dark chocolate, licorice, and... bacon? This is similar to the Smoked Porter, but this smoked meat scent actually fits the olfactory profile nicely.  T - The roasted malt and coffee predominate, with syrupy molasses, woodsmoke, and figs supporting. As the beer warms, the chocolate and a hint of brown sugar emerge and sweeten this beer as it develops in the glass. A delightfully hoppy finish balances the flavor nicely throughout.  M - Moderately thick, very smooth full body. The finish is dry, which fits remarkably well.  D - More than merely sippable, this is a compelling, but challenging drink. The ABV is hidden very well.  I feel like this is one of the craft beer world's better kept secrets. Very happy that this is readily available in Chicagoland now, and at a very reasonable price point to boot.

Smell is reminiscent of the smoothness of a Belgian Dubbel.  T: Incredible. This beer is complex and hits your tongue in stages. Syrup malt sweetness gives way to coffee and chocolate that fades into a delicate hop balance that finishes subtle with a hint of hop bitter.  M: Wraps around the tongue on both sides.

A-pours a beautiful dark brown, nearly black hue with a two finger tan head with strong retention. Lacing is even all the way down the glass. This is a beauty.  S-The aroma is resplendent. Deep, dark roasted chocolate malts with a vague hint of coffee. Prominent dark dried fruits and sugars, like figs, Turkish apricots, brown sugar and molasses. Amazing.  T-A delicious, nuclear malt bomb. It is adequately hoppy, but is balanced by deep, rich malt flavors reminiscent of figs, brown sugar, and chocolate fudge. This is truly imperial, and fitting for more than a Russian Czar. God, this is great.  M-Substantial yet smooth. The mouthfeel is delectable. If I could have only one beer, it just might be this. Although, a definite sipping beer, because you don't want to rush past any of its nuances, this can be enjoyed in large gulps. I love this beer.  D-This very drinkable. It must be, since I want more and don't have any. At 10.5% ABV the alcohol is not noticeable in the taste, but it definitely contributes to the overall character of this great beer. Extremely well done, Stone.  A note about value. I paid $6.49 for this bomber, which is almost half the price of The Abyss. When I am pinching pennies, I always choose this over The Abyss.

It's the main component in this beer. Caramel and dark chocolate are also detected to a degree in the finish.  M: Very thick, smooth, and creamy. Lingers on the tongue for quite sometime. Coats the palate. Near perfect balance with moderate carbonation.  D: A thick, amazing stout that even though it is thick and creamy, it's easy to drink.

147,1160,Pahn,4.37,"22oz bottle into a tulip. Bottled Spring 2009.  Appearance: Moderate pour down the side then middle of the glass yields a one and a half inch light tan head that dissipates slowly, leaving swatches of lacing. Color is dark brown / black, ruby red at the edges. Beer leaves minimal lacing.  Smell: The robust aromas you expect from a RIS: chocolate, coffee, roasted malt. Not a lot of dark fruit or hops influence. The main chocolate/roasted malt notes are deep and intriguing though; sweet, creamy, and developing further as the beer warms. Not much alcohol in the nose as well.  Taste: The smell tricked me; this is still a hoppy, alcohol-hot RIS after a year of aging. Neither aspect is abrasive or overpowering though, just strong and present along with the creamy coffee/chocolate/roasted flavors. The piny hops and alcohol really help to keep the almost too-sweet flavors in check. Some flavor very reminiscent of cookie dough emerges about halfway through, which is very nice. Despite a good amount of bitterness coming from the hops and the roasted malt, the balance stays strong throughout. The noticeable alcohol is a boon to the flavor rather than a distraction from it.  Mouthfeel: Full-bodied and creamy, with a hot finish.  Drinkability: A sipper that tastes so good you want to drink it fast anyway.  Like many Stone beers, Stone IRS is bold while still being balanced, and is a solid example of its style. If you're on a stout kick, or liable to be on one in the future, you'll want to keep a bottle of this on hand at all times. Also notable for the excellent value, $5-$7 a bottle or so, depending on where you are (I paid $6 in NYC).",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,96

It tastes just as it smells; Chocolate-Coffee malts at the front, joined by subtle hints of maple and caramel. The texture is almost milky, silky and very smooth.

Props to Winking Lizard, I hope this is a prelude of more to come in the following years.  Poured a black coffee color, no light gets through. Has the appearance of syrup on the pour but is actually fairly thin and watery in consistency.  Smelled of rich coffee beans and heavy roasted malt. Alcohol is also is in the nose, but then again, at 10.5% it's not surprising.  The taste was very pleasing. Rich, full of flavor: coffee, thick and chewy malt, muddled hops, and brown sugar. Very tastey and mellow.  I found the beer very drinkable. It was my second beer of the night but I felt pretty tipsy afterward, so the alcohol does a number on you yet I found it not as noticable as one would expect from such a high abv.

In comes a pleasant blend of chocolate, roasty coffee, anise, molasses, and tongue numbing alcohol.  I'm very much intrigued by the complexity of this brew. Each sip seems to conjure a different flavor. It is a mouthful, I can tell you that with a very creamy texture and sticky dry aftertaste.

What little dark brown head there is all but disappears, forming a thin ring.  Aroma is roasted malt, coffee and savory black licorice there is a faint sweetness in the background. Flavor continues the aroma. It is big and bold and the sweetness asserts itself a little more, but is still overshadowed by the bitterness of the roasted malts. There is some carbonation in the mouthfeel, and it dries up nicely and doesn't leave a syrupy feeling. But the bitterness lingers a little long.  I'll easy drink the bomber. I expected to really love it, but there's something about his beer that is missing. Can't quite put my finger on it.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,96

Nice dense mouth with lots of roasted malt, coffee, earth flavor, some faint tobacco, a lasting bitter hop on the finish. Malt is a bit sweet up front, then the carbonation and bitterness wash it out.  Nice full body with a touch of hop oil on the finish.  Its good, but in all honesty there are many stouts which are better (rasputin, nogne 0, yeti). I'd get it again, but only to try the next release.  **A warming alcohol burn as it warms. Mouthfeel gets a bit more creamy as well, and the flavors gain intensity. A good stout, but still not on par with the others.  **Resampled again at 6 months, 8 months, and 1.5 years.

Good carbonation, which makes this beer feel lighter than it actually is. Lots of coffee and roasted malt flavors and a bit of chocolate. Still a bit rough around the edges, though... it needs a year or so more aging to round out completely.  I don't care for the 2009 vintage as much as previous vintages, but it's still good.

T - Roasted coffee, hint of carmel malts and touch of cocoa been. Hint of bitter gives way to deep roast and finishes up with a tiny bit of creamyness and then a nip of alcohol.  M - Solid, not quite full bodied, but close enough, could stand to be a little thicker. Nice carbonation.  D - Hard to pick out the alcohol in this one, impressive given the ABV.

147,1160,BigMike,4.25,"This is a bottle from 2009 that i've been sitting on. That makes right about a year old.  Poured into a tulips glass. Black as night. Used motor oil. Theres absolutely no light coming through this bad boy. Head is gorgeous. Just a bit more then 1 finger after an aggressive swirl in the glass. It looks thick and rich and is a roasted hazelnut color. Very viscous. This one really hugs the sides of the glass nicely.  Tons going on in the nose. I'm getting a ton of bittersweet chocolate. Some dark roasted coffee bean. Dark dried sticky fruit like raisins and prunes. Also a touch of plum and molasses. A bit of heat from the alcohol top.  Initially i'm getting chocolate followed by a lot of raisin flavor. Some molasses. The coffee kicks in on the finish and is really the last flavor that lingers after the swallow. A good amount of heat still present even after 12 months in the cellar. I imagine a really fresh bottle would be one hell of a bruiser. Still some hops left that haven't faded yet. And they provide a small touch of floral to the beer. As its warming, a touch of Fennel and black licorice.  Big mouthfeel on this one. Pretty thick and chewy. Lot's of alcohol presence.  Drinkability is a good as you can get for a huge 10.5% Imperial Russian Stout. I mean you can't drink a ton of these but thats just the way it is. It's a fantastic beer regardless.

A bit of roasty malt in the background, any booze/hops are long gone on the palate. Thick, full, rich, sticky. Quintessential aged RIS? I guess so...

147,1160,jwillcourt,3.7,"Served from a bomber into a wine glass. Bottle says limited release Spring 2008, so this is nearly 2 years old. It was kept in my wine cellar at the correct temperature. I look forward to trying a fresher version some day and possibly revising these notes.  A - Very dark brown, almost black, and opaque even when held to the light. Finger of pinkish-tan head disappears within a couple minutes to a ring of foam. The head cannot be restored, even with vigorous swirling, and it leaves little to no lacing.  S - First thing I notice is quite a bit of earthy hops buzzing around. They are assertive, and I was expecting malt up front. Next, comes a fruity plum smell, followed by alcohol fumes, and finally a hint of roasted malt.  T - The malt is stronger in the flavor. Initially, I taste strong roasted malt and slight roast coffee. This is followed by cocoa, plum, licorice and alcohol. The aftertaste lingers for 10-15 seconds and includes more alcohol and bitter hops. It is pretty dry all the way through, although some sips are fruitier than others.  M - Medium to full-bodied. Carbonation is light, but also a little more aggressive than usual for the style. It feels a little sticky on the lips, but leaves very little residual feel in the mouth. It gets more creamy over time. A few sips yield a little sediment.  D - No problem finishing a bomber. The alcohol is present but not tiring. I am not as anxious to open another bottle as I have been with others in this style.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,96
147,1160,Beerandraiderfan,4.31,"I think Stone might have been the first to coin the term ""used motor oil"" in an RIS. This one certainly looks the part. Aroma is deep and heavy on the chocolate and alcohol.  Taste, is exquisite. Chewy, almost to the point its oatmeal stout, covers the alcohol unlike the aroma. Throw in some coffee. Gargantuan. And of course, the Stone trademark of hops and bitterness. So enjoyable.  Mouthfeel, fades when you swish it around a little, which might be good, this is a big beer.

There is a lot more hops then I wanted ... floral hops with dark fruits and roastd malts. Harsh around the edges with the alcohol burn and hop bitterness.  M: Slick and harsh.

The aroma makes ne think about stone brewery itself. It's pretty unique. Very roasty and sweet. Dark caramels and burnt sugars. Smells great.  Flavor is just how it smells. The roast is so well balanced with the caramel and sweet maltiness. I have had this aged with about 6 years on it too and it smooths out so well. It's pretty smooth at this age too but it gets even better. A little alcohol burn but again with age it goes away.  Mouthfeel is great. Good and thick like an RIS ahould be but not too viscous. Just right on the carb as well.  Overall I could drink a couple in one sitting but not too much.

147,1160,tjinohio,4.13,"This was a one year old bottle that had been refrigerated at 54 degrees. My tasting requires a little bit of a story.  The first night I opened the bottle, I poured a healthy portion into an oversized wine glass. Carbonation was low, but appropriate, I think, to the style. The head was, consequently, small and dissipated pretty quickly. The overall appearance was that of espresso, even down to the head. It was very similar to the froth on the top of a fresh cup of espresso.  As for the aroma, it was reminiscent of when my father would put a little Sambucca in his coffee. There was a good coffee aroma with a surprisingly strong alcoholic overtone. I just anticipated the alcohol to be more mellowed after a year. There is, also, a healthy smell of bitter chocolate.  The taste was ""bam!"", heavy alcohol. The coffee, chocolate and malt flavors were there, but overwhelmed by the alcohol. A let it sit. It got better. I let it sit a little more. It got even better. I was done the glass and decided to sit it aside for the next night. This is where the story comes in.  So, I'm fairly new at this and I chalk this up to a learning experience. I decided to cap the bottle with a reusable cork seal that I use with wine. I then put it on its side in my wine fridge. Big mistake. The next day when I returned from a day of work, the inside of the fridge and our kitchen counter and floor were covered with Imperial Russian Stout. By the spray inside the fridge it was clear the cork hadn't just leaked. It exploded!  Disappointed, I poured the remaining stout into a glass and ""Wow!"" The flavor was awesome. I can only speculate that the beer sitting in the open bottle in the fridge really allowed it to air. The alcohol had mellowed considerably, though still present, and the flavors soared. Wonderful coffee and rich chocolate with a warm to hot feel.  The mouthfeel was fantastic. The carbonation, obviously, had dissipated, but was replaced by a creaminess on the pallet.  Overall, this is a wonderful IRS. But my recommendation would be to cork it, put it in a fridge, let it explode and sit over night. Then enjoy!",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,96

A strong dark backbone and a hint of coffee and chocolate as well.  T - Really interesting in that the taste profile has really settled down compared to fresh bottles of this. No real strong alcohol and the slight ashy taste is gone as well. What you taste are dark fruits, chocolate, some coffee, and a dark full roast.  M - Nice, maybe not as full as the fresh bottles because there was little head to this one. Still very nice.  D - The fresh bottles are a little bit too boozy forward for my liking. This one was great.  I might have picked up the slightest tinge of oxidation in this one. It drinks well, just wondering if this is the outer limit for this one.

Very nice stout appearance.  Nose is fairly burnt, but yeah, very sweet, almost too sweet. Lots of nuts - almonds and hazelnuts - with a fair cocoa character and a bit of milk. A bit lacking in the burnt aromas I would expect from an RIS. Has a kind of milk coffee aroma. Doesn't smell bad, but I want more roastiness from it, it actually smells a bit weak.  Taste is a lot stronger, but still very sweet indeed. Lacks the roastiness again. Has some roasty ashy hints, but there is more prominence given to some strong alcohol hits on the mid and back. Some hints of roasted espresso, cocoa, oak and some coppery metallic character on there as well. But yeah, a really strong alcohol kick to it and comes across more as a dessert wine than a beer, with the sweetness and noticeable booziness. Definitely could use more roasty bitterness, just lacks potency in flavour. I like strong flavour, not just strong beer.  Mouthfeel is very full, quite stinging though when alcohol comes through. A bit grainy, not bad but could be smoother.  A pleasant drinking beer, but I just would prefer less sweetness.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,96

Since then, each time I come back around to it, it seems better than before. I had '08's that were tremendous, but then most recently I was amazed that the '09 was essentially equal. I think if I had to pick its number one asset, it's the balance. It has a spicy warmth like a Three Philosophers, but this is subdued so masterfully with the delicious malty chocolate and coffee tones. The roundness in the mouth is unprecedented. The alc isn't evident, at least not in a way even close to the number on the bottle. I have some Founders Breakfast Stout in the fridge, which I eagerly await to compare to the Stone, but I don't see how it will dethrone my beloved IRS. Drinkability: Too good. I've had two back to back, and it's so good that I wanted a third. When I went to go look for a third, I had to stand up... I like it seved nice and chilled.. I've had it warm and it is quite a different, far more pungent flavor profile, but still it's pretty enjoyable.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,96
147,1160,DNICE555,4.68,"Glad this beer is readily available all the way over in my neck of the woods now.  A - Black as a Halloween night. Foamy Tan head like a rabid black cat.  S - Chocolate, roasted coffee, grains, alcohol, some fruit and bitter hops. Smells like my kind of stout.  T - Very rich chocolate malt coffee fruit with a hoppy finish to balance it out perfectly. I love this stout.  M - Rich and creamy. The most balanced stout that I have had to date.  D - Smooth, balanced, could drink a couple hundred of these... too bad its such a high abv so one will have to do.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,96
147,1160,biglite351,2.99,"I wanted to like this beer more. I really did. All the talk about Stone Brewing and how good everything is...  My issue... hops and bitterness.  I like Stouts because of their typical lack of hops and bitterness. This brew is certainly Stone Brewing. Stone loves their hops and bitterness and they managed to get some into their Imperial Stout as well.  I did not care for the smell and the taste put me off as it is mildly hoppy and bitter. Midly for beers on average, very hoppy and bitter for a stout.  If you like other Stone Brewing brews then you should like this one as well.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,96
147,1160,ericj551,4.78,"Poured from a 2009 bottle. Stone IRS pours an inky black with a thick brown head. Not a bit of light shines through when held up to the bulb. The aroma is sweet and chocolatey with hints of caramel and toffee. The flavor is rich chocolate, with tons of sweet crystal malt flavor balancing out a slight astringency of the roasted malt. The finish is dark with hints of coffee and earthy bitterness. Some alcohol burn comes through in the end, but at 10.5% I wouldn't expect otherwise. This is definitely towards the sweet chocolatey end of imperial stouts, and I don't know how they could do it better.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,96
147,1160,biboergosum,4.18,"22oz bottle, the 2008 version at the Stone event at Bar Volo in Toronto. I like the Cossack hat on the gargoyle on the label - awkward, but funny.  This beer pours a complete black abyss, save a teensy basal red cola edge, with two fat fingers of puffy, densely foamy, and a little soapy brown head, which lazily dissipates, leaving some attractive painted tree branch lace around the glass.  It smells of lightly roasted caramel malt, dry chocolate wafers, wet ash, pithy licorice, a further oaten graininess, warming alcohol, and mild earthy, citrusy, and piney hops. The taste is sweet, lightly-toasted caramel/toffee malt, bittersweet cocoa, dry coffee grounds, a hint of star anise, treacle, an underlying citrus/pine hoppiness, and a tame, but slowly enveloping, warm 'n cozy booziness.  The carbonation is practically non-existent, barely a tremor of frothiness to be found, the body thick, unctuous, and velvety smooth, like buttah, with the attendant oily creaminess. It finishes still sweet, sure, but with a slightly vodka-tinted citrus hop edge over top of all that solid-ass malt.  Hooo-weeee, is this a dangerously drinkable and enjoyable RIS, way too clean and approachable for its purported strength. I wanted to make nice and share this monster of a brew, but since all my new friends around me are drinking the same thing, methinks that tonight's Supa Bowl viewing is gonna be a fuzzy one.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,96
147,1160,PorterLambic,4.42,"Pours pitch black with a cocoa powder colored head. Good sized pile of foam but it drops quickly leaving little lace. Smell is malty, vanilla, hint of hops, dark fruit, alcohol and molasses. Taste is everything offered to the olfactory sense with coffee and smoke added in. Great balance. Medium-full bodied with a medium effervescence. Fairly smooth with a slightly dry finish. Oh, yeah, this is some seriously good stuff.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,96
147,1160,garbercury,4.2,"Thanks to Reed415 for the generous Xmas gift!  2007 vintage, poured into snifter.  A--Not much carbonation or head...  S--Chocolate and malts stand out in this brew.  T--Really excellent flavor, the chocolate stands out which works well for me.  M--Good silky moutfeel  D--This is an awesome beer. Not sure how long this beer can age before it ""turns"", but a nice choice for my first Super Bowl sunday beer day.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,96
147,1160,RppIII,4.3,"Poured from a bomber into a snifter  Appearance: Black viscous and impenetrable this liquid slowly releases bubbles of carbonation that make their journey up through the oil like substance to eventually reach the top to create a buttery tan head. The head retreats slowly to reveal a lackluster black abyss. Rings of chocolate brown coat the sides of the glass and ever so slowly lacing settles back down the sides of the glass to rejoin the delicious black liquid waiting for me.  Smell: Becoming more aromatic as this brew warms up I detect large amounts of roast barley, dark malts, butter cream, a hint of vanilla, and hops come through on the end. Surprisingly for a 10%+ abv there is very little alcohol presence in the nose.  Taste: Dark and viscous this beer is packed with flavour from start to finish. Malt, roasted thick viscous malt filled with tons of chocolate, anise, and a bitter hop presence that gives you a kick in the mouth for a finish. Not as sweet as the nose would have let me to believe but a hint of vanilla and bitter sweet butter cream make an appearance giving nice contrast to the immense malt and bitter hop flavours. The alcohol of this beer is subtle and after half of the bottle you are reminded of its presence. All elements of this beer work together in wonderful harmony and contrast to bring out every flavour in this rich and incredibly ""stout"" beer.  Mouthful: The mouth is fantastic, creamy and smooth; I especially love the silky feel of this brew is it comes closer to room temperature and more poignant. The sheer viscosity of this beer would lead me to believe I was drinking pure maple syrup.  Drinkability: I would like to thank Stone for creating such a magnificent full-bodied brew in the style of an Russian Imperial Stout, Stone is known for making first-rate products and this is no exception. This afternoon I ventured into the almost three feet of snow outside to build an igloo and this is the perfect beer to come in and warm up to. In fact once I finish this review I am going to give this beer a field test by taking it into the igloo to finish what I have left.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,96
147,1160,pd360,4.4,"What a delight, enjoyed on tap as part of the Novare Res 12 Stouts After Christmas. Dark, rich, thick and complex this was a very enjoyable beer. The alcohol warmed me right up and it felt like dark chocolate hot cocoa. My wife ordered a Young Chocolate Stout (also on tap) and trying a sip of it after the Stone made it taste like Yoo-Hoo. This was the closest beer I have tasted to the elusive Kate the Great.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,96
147,1160,melloashello,5,"Flying Saucer had 2007 Stone IRS on tap. I knew it was going to be a long night immediately. There was no way I could pass up on this beer. I ordered myself one and sat there for a moment, just staring at the black, beautiful color of the beer. The aroma reached my nose from a distance. I sat there for a few good minutes, just smelling the beer. I'm sure the people around me thought I was crazy, but the beertenders knew what I was up to. One of them came up to me and said, ""enjoy it while you can, cause it will be gone soon."" Hesitantly, I took the first sip and sank into catatonia.

147,1160,BlackHaddock,4.15,"Brown botle containing 1 pint and 6 fl oz. Spring 2009 release, drank Jan 2010. Poured into a Westmalle chalice and my huge 'Judas' tulip.  Looked very impressive, dark, black in fact jet black. The head was a full tan coloured head covering on both glasses.  The aroma was all darkness, roasted coffee, toasted malts and dark chocolate.  The taste followed the smell to the letter. The ground coffee was the most forward of the flavours, it also stayed the longest in the aftertaste. The alcohol content began to arrive towards the end of the moutfeel and was more prominent as the beer warmed.  Really enjoyed this beer, most likely the best beer from the USA I've had so far. Can't remember what score I gave Ten FIDY, but this is better in my opinion.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,96
147,1160,Moonraker7,4.45,"A: Pours dark black, head is a brownish tan color. Doesn't get much darker than this.  S: Burnt, roasted malts, chocolate, some sweetness and dark fruit, coffee. Alcohol seems dominant.  T: Very intense roasted coffee flavors and chocolate. Very sweet and malty as well, finishing off with some fairly bitter hops. Alcohol is hidden quite well once this beer warms up a bit.  M: Syrupy and creamy. Light carbonation.  D: The alcohol is hidden well and its very drinkable for a RIS. The sweetness is alittle much for my personal tastes, but that doesn't stop it from being a really solid beer. For the price, this may be one of the better RIS I've had.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,96
147,1160,OneDropSoup,4.08,"From a bomber marked Spring 2009, to a snifter.  Pours an opaque black with a collar of loose mocha head, a few tiny bubbles. No lacing but leaves nice sudsy snail trails that slowly sink back into the body. Swirl it & see some sparkling gold.  Smells of dark fruit (dried cherries, prunes, cranberry), on the tart side, some roasty cocoa. Woody?  Taste is a sharp dark chocolate, tartness like dark fruit skins. Sharp alcohol, a tannic feel like dry red wine. Bitterness like coffee grounds.  Mouthfeel is full-bodied, at first velvety smooth & then sharply alcoholic & bitter, nice aftertaste. Both comforting & a little confrontation, in turns. Heat waits & then comes hard.  Very enjoyable, big & tasty -- one is enough, but I ended up happily finishing the bomber. This was relatively young, & while it had some great things going for it, I'd love to have it aged to smooth out some of the rough edges. I'm sure the result would be fantastic.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,96
147,1160,oceanman,4.37,"2008 vintage.  Pours near black all the way through with a thin head of deep reddish brown.  Rich cocoa aromas, leather, berries/plum, toasted marshmallows.  Prevailing roasted flavor, yet very smooth. Chocolate, coffee, faint soy sauce. Pleasant warming alcohol, has a bit of heat, but nicely creamy, especially as beer warms, gains complexity. Feels great - so smooth, yet lively.  A good model for imperial stouts to follow. Improves and comes into its own as it warms.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,96
147,1160,JohnL9013,4.56,"This is a Stout to be reckoned with!  A: This stuff pours black and is literally viscous, like half-and-half. The head develops slowly since it's so viscous, and when it does form, it's the darkest brown I've seen. Oh, and the beer itself is jet black with zero transparency.  S: A complex nose dominated by coffee, molasses, and caramel. There's bittering hops in the background as well.  T: This is the best stout I've ever tasted. I remember trying Guinness Extra Stout last year and thinking what a nice, bitter stout it was, but that stuff is water compared to this. This fills in all the gaps Guinness is missing. There's a huge body to this beer, there's no other way to describe it. Big coffee flavor, very sweet, molasses, chocolate, and perfect bittering hops to balance...delicious! And really, really intense. Certainly, I had never had any beer like this before trying this stuff.  M: Ridiculously smooth. Surprisingly not dry for a stout, but very sweet and silky, creamily smooth. Ultra-low carbonation... just like drinking a good coffee or hot chocolate or something heavenly, but in beer form.  D: 10.5%? You can't even tell. Still very sweet and not the kind of thing you have more than one of.  My bottle was dated spring 2009 of this year. It mentions on the bottle that it's best left to ""cellar"" for a while. Well, I just drank this in November here and I'd say it was perfect.  EDIT: I am re-reviewing a second bottle of this beer. It's been almost three months since I reviewed the last one. Cellaring has changed this beer, believe it or not, and the most noticeable change was in its alcohol content, which seems to be quite high now.  A: Just as last time, this beer has the most epic appearance of any stout I've ever seen. Extremely viscous with a tall, thick head. The way this beer develops is amazing.  S: The smell is definitely better this time around...the beer is physically putting out more aromas than last time. There's a heavy roasted malt and chocolate nose.  T: The taste is in some ways an improvement but the alcohol content of this bottle seems to be higher than my last, whether due to the cellaring process or variations in the bottles. The flavors have smoothed out as I expected but the higher alcohol content almost masks some of the subtleties. Make no mistake, this is still phenomenal, and you can expect tons of roasted malt, coffee, and chocolate, all of the highest caliber.  M: The mouthfeel has decreased in quality due to the increased alcohol content (this one burns going down, folks) but this is still one heck of a smooth stout, especially considering the ridiculously strong flavor profile.  D: This beer's drinkability is limited by its alcohol content. I love the taste of beer but I don't particularly like the feeling of getting drunk and make no mistake, after only a single bottle of this definitely-more-than-10.5%-beer, I was basking almost a little too much in beer nirvana. It goes down smooth but after you finish your bottle, I seriously doubt you will want anything else the rest of the night.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,96
147,1160,boatshoes,4.32,"Received this in my first BIF from Brewfan. The 2007 vintage and my first experience with this beer. Thanks!  Appearance- Pours the usual opaque black with a half finger or so of dark brown, bubbly head that dies back immediately to a ring. Minimal lacing left as I drink and no noticeable beading.  Smell- Dominated by rich bitter chocolate and roasted malt. Just a hint of burnt coffee in the background. Smells quite rich and delicious.  Taste- Again, I find bitter chocolate to be in the forefront of the palate. Lots of rich roasted malt, coffee, and even a little bit of what I would call charcoal to round this one out in complexity as well. A whole lot of flavor swirling around but remarkably smooth after two years in the bottle.  Mouthfeel/Drinkability- Slick and heavy mouthfeel with just the right amount of minimal carbonation. Drinkability is very good for the style and the alcohol has smoothed out very well despite the high percentage.  Overall, a first rate RIS. Hope to try other vintages of this beer so I can see what it tastes like fresh and with more time on it.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,96
147,1160,pdoran10,3.43,"Shared with my sister from a 22oz. bomber a few months ago, 2009 vintage. I think I've finally found my first beer in BA's top 100 that I don't like nearly as much as others.  The pour into a standard pint glass was exciting. Good carbonation produced about a half inch of rich head. The smell was complex, of roasted malt with a definite hop presence. This is one thing I love about Stone's beers, their aggressive hops! I am left disappointed by the taste. I get roasted malt right away, but then I am hit by a pretty biting alcohol taste. Surprised that this bothers me. I've enjoyed many bigger beers than this. Not impressed with the taste. Maybe with some aging and mellowing...  Anyways, mouthfeel was solid. Good consistency for a imperial stout. Feels solid and not sticky in your mouth. Drinability was not good.

Looks thick and appetizing just out of the bottle and into the glass, with typical stout opacity that's just completely inky black. Not too much of a head, just a few centimeters high and colored a light creamy caramel. Leaves a fair amount of lacing. Smell is a smoky mix of coffee and dark chocolate with subtle hints of fruitiness.  The initial sip has a bit of maltiness to it, followed by the coffee flavorings evident in the smell. There's an interesting mix of bitterness, combining the coffee and dark chocolate twang with some hoppy character towards the middle. Finish has a very slight alcoholic twinge, which surprised me given the 10.50% ABV of this stout. The aftertaste is lightly bitter, quite pleasant. Mouthfeel is nice and full-bodied, not too much carbonation. Went down smooth and easy.  Drinkability is quite good for a stout of this caliber.

Earthy hops following the English line. This is a great tasting beer. No tricks, no gimmicks, just good solid brewing in the vein of Brooklyn BCS. An excellent balance of bread, roasted grains, and sweetness. Brown bread, molasses, and toffee. Mocha and light chocolate with coffee in the finish. An earthy hops blending into the coffee to give a lingering dry finish with faint alcohol heretofore invisible superbly integrated. Feel is silky and mildly carbonated. A pleasing fullness with a slightly chewy texture. Quite easy to drink in spite of the abv. I have to force myself to behave.

Awesome this one was a bottle I had back for 2 years and wow all I can say is lay these bad boys down to age and you will be VERY pleased. Not overly heavy on the mouth feel but just right. All the flavors seem to jump out especially as the brew warms. I had this one at just over celler temp. Dont drink these cold as it does not truly let the flavors come out like they are capable of . Nice roasted malts and chocolate a small touch of coffee not overly done in anything and all the flavors blend to form and intense drinkable experience you and expect going into a beer like this.Awesome,Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,96

147,1160,Beergeeknut,4.28,Appearance: A dark abyssl fluid of darkness and evil that is topped with a mocha colored head that is about two fingers thick. Simply looking at this beast of a beer convinces me that it does not let light pass through it absorbs light like a black hole in outer space.  Aroma: Waves upon waves of dark roasted coffee. Dark roasted chocolate malts with light burnt hoppiness. It's all blended so remarkably.  Taste: A silky smooth mouthfeel like a melted chocolate ganache. Burnt hops tons of sweetness from the dark roasted malts. With bitterness coming from the roasted malts and coffee beans. A great malty backbone.  Notes: Wow this is a great brew perfect for any cold night. Cheers.,Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,96
147,1160,dasenebler,4.62,"Bomber, 2009 release.  This one's been cellared for about six months, so I thought I'd give it a try. Temperature is around 60 degrees.  Onyx pour. When given some air, this stout pours with a great head, which is relatively light in color for an imperial. Okay lace.  Aroma is nice, with some alcohol and fat notes of roast and tobacco.  Flavor is excellent. It has mellowed and rounded significantly over the past several of months alone. Heaps of chocolate, both dark and sweet. Significant roast, but not nearly as much hopiness as expected. Coffee. Definitely bitter, but well- balanced. Anise and tobacco, like the aroma. The mouthfeel is obviously full and rich, but I can't judge this terribly well right now. I'd like to have this beer as my first of the night in the future... and then call it a night given the ABV. However, this is a very drinkable stout when allowed to age.  I don't know how much I'm adding with my review to this already well-recognized brew (1,600+ opinions on BA!). This is merely an affirmation of its greatness. It's like Old Rasputin taken to a whole other level: refined and smooth.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,96

Slowly dies to a collar.  This is a ridiculously drinkable RIS at this point. Beautiful roasting malt, dark chocolate, hints of anise, caramel, toffee, milk chocolate, hints of espresso. Creamy mouthfeel, not a hint of the alcohol at this point aside from a slight warming as it descends. Coats the mouth.  Oh so balanced, oh so roasty with just enough sweet to balance. Dangerously drinkable at this point, must find more to age. Superb.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,96
147,1160,BeerFMAndy,5,"22 oz bottle poured into an Imperial Pint. 10.5% ABV, ""Age at Cellar temp 55 degrees or below"", ""Ages especially well."", ""Limited Spring 2009 Release.""  A - The pour is clear and quiet. In the glass it's almost pitch black with scant hints of color at the very bottom. The head is a dark mocha tan and packed with big bubbles. Despite it's small stature, it was retained very well. Thin lace covered the glass when the foam dropped to a creamy layer.  S - The nose bursts with potent, intricate roasted malts. Light coffee weaves in and out of dark chocolate that's drizzled with molasses. Black cherries and raisins add a low and dark fruity nature to this imperial stout. A rich caramel malt sweetness gives a good balance to the exceptional nose. Some toffee, mocha, and vanilla notes also aid in the massive complexity of this amazing nose.  T - Thick, robust roasted malts coat the tongue in a beautiful malty glory. Like the aroma, the flavor is vastly complex. Molasses, chocolate chunks, coffee bean, caramel cube, and a toasted bread malt flavor make up much of what I get. Then toffee, mocha, and vanilla bean all wander in like a dribble of coffee creamer. The potent alcohol that's noticeable instantly on the first sip, just seems to fade away. This is one of the most exceptional flavors I've had the pleasure of tasting.  M - Rich and chewy, it's a beyond-full-bodied brew that coats the throat all the way down like syrup. The carbonation is perfectly balanced to deliver a smooth drinking experience. With it being low, it also explains the lack of a larger head.  D - Between the flavor and mouthfeel...well, hell...every aspect of this beer, it's probably one of, if not THE, best beers I've ever had in my life. And for the price, it's damn near impossible to beat. I want to buy a case and I want to buy it now.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,96

Looked great in the glass.  I'm putting exceptional as the smell because I was in a smokey bar and I could actually smell something. Which I usually never can do because I'm actually allergic to cigerette smoke. I could definatly smell the malted carmel and spices.  The taste was amazingly smooth. It really does mellow out with age. There really wasn't an overly sweet taste to it, and the spices worked very well.  The mouthfeel was perfect, no alcohol burn what so ever. However it was very filling, which is why I am marking down the drinkability. Probably more my stomachs fault that the beer.

147,1160,sprucetip,4.23,"My second full review of this one, and it is from notes. My original review was one of my very first reviews, and not very descriptive. Also scored it higher than I ever score anything these days. But it was also sort of an accident that I will be reviewing it twice, as I'd forgotten I'd reviewed it and taken notes the last time I had it. Here goes. This bottle had at least 1.5 years on it at the time of the sample.  Pours thick, dark black with creamy head that gradually fades to film and ring. Glass has some lacing, but not much.  SMELL Initially I get some licorice (star anise?), molasses, roasted barley, and a more general malty sweetness. Emerging later are coffee, smoky and strong boozy elements. Complex, smooth and inviting.  TASTE is much like the nose. Strong licorice, molasses, and roasted barley with some coffee and black patent. Boozy with a fairly sharp but restrained hoppy/roasted bitterness coming on late. Malty sweetness balances well until the finish. Mellower than I recalled, but perhaps smoother and more complex? Those final observations would make sense given the time in the cellar.  FEEL Medium carbonation, rich full body, thick and chewy, moderate alcoholic warming, and some bitterness in the semi-dry finish.  OVERALL Seems to have mellowed with age, and surprisingly easy to drink. Pretty smooth for all that is going on in it.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,96

147,1160,brow1901,4.05,"Poured into a snifter  A- Jet black with a thin light brown head. Retention is fair with excellent lacing. No light gettin through this glass.  S- Kinda a spicy fruit smell to it, with a hint of alcohol. It isn't the sometimes prevalant dark fruit smell that is associated with really sweet stouts, but rather it is a smell I associate with a normal pale ale. There still is the hint of raisins in it though.  T- Pretty bitter, not really what I would have guessed based on the smell but the hops shine in the taste department. Beyond that is more great flavor, tons of toasted and burnt malt.  M- Thick and viscious, really slick in the mouth. Nice alcohol warming to go along with it though.  D- I can never seem to give RIS anything more than a 4.5 for drinkability, I find it kinda rediculous to try and drink 22oz of this stuff. Its not that its bad but it is heavy and high abv.

147,1160,alkemy,3.88,"Limited Spring 2009 Release. This stuff is black. The fluffy dark tan head is the only thing that gives it away as to not actually being black. The head does dissipate rather quickly. I can't even discern color when held directly to my desk light. Lots of chocolate along with some strong coffee notes and hints of molasses. Only a hint of alcohol in the nose. There are also traces of dark dried fruits. Tastes of a smoky chocolate coffee. Alcohol is masked fairly well, but it is noticeable. Pretty good for a 10.5% RIS. That's what has kept me away from other RIS's such as Siberian Night, which I felt to be too alcohol forward. Oddly enough, I tend not to notice alcohol in high ABV strong ales or DIPA's. I'm also noticing a black licorice component as I get further into this. Creamy viscous feel with a fair amount of carbonation. Not typically a fan of this style, but I'm glad I tried this one. Nice sipper, but I could only drink it sparingly. The only knock that I have is that there is a building sweetness/richness that knocks down the drinkablity a touch for me.

I am not getting a commanding smell, everything seems to work well to give you a very nice smelling beer.  T- I am picking up some of the same tastes that I found in the nose as well. Coffee, chocolate, along with roasted malt. Everything seeems to finsh in a mellow alcohol finish. Good tasting beer that for its strength is going down well.  I have a 2007 bottle but decided that I would give this one a shot first. This is a good RIS but I probably would not get this again. I have had other offerings from Stone that I would get before buying this again. Plus I have found other RIS's that suit me more. Overall a nice beer but a one time thing.

After a year's aging, this is presenting as an amazing beer. My notes are for the 2008 vintage, now a year old.

T - Starts off roasty, then hits the sweetness, and begins staying a little too overly sweet. Doesn't keep much of that stout taste going down, and has a soy sweetness that isnt too pleasant. Wish there was more roast in this one. Perhaps with more age, the sweetness will mellow out. Not Alcohol flavor, so this was well aged for a year and a half.  M - Not too bubbly, smooth, and creamy. Wish there was a slight more carbonation, and less soy sauce like characteristics, but overall good.  D - I could have a few of these. The flavor and mouthfeel go well, not perfect, but they work.

(S)- Roasted coffee with lots of brown sugar & toffee sweetness. Some burnt molasses & raisin nuances.  (T)- Wow, great depth of flavor. A dense breadiness with black coffee, molasses and a silky brown sugar & caramel sweetness that is delicate but pronounced.

The head is light brown/dark tan - about an inch to start and average retention for a beer this strong (10.8% abv on the bottle). Ladder like lacing all around the glass.  Smell is strong and very pleasant. Malty, slightly sweet and a little chocolate.  Taste is excellent. Malty, caramel, milk chocolate and a hint of vanilla with exactly the right amount of alcohol to warm you up and cut any sweetness. None of the flavors are out of balance.  Mouthfeel is one of the best parts. All these flavors blend into an incredibly smooth mouthfeel. The vanilla and alcohol give it a little bite and the alcohol contributes to a warming effect. The first sip seemed a hair thin but that work out after a few sips.  Drinkability is very good. I am just finishing up the bomber and could probably enjoy another 12 oz. before oblivion starts to kick in.

The milk chocolate still dominates, but the dark chocolates are definitely here, also. Good toasted nut flavor. Mild dark fruit sweetness combines with roasted malt notes. A touch of brown sugars, both dark and golden. The back-end gets a mild touch of espresso roast, almost bitter, but it is balanced by light notes of vanilla and caramel. There is a very mild smokiness, laying over the whole thing.  This is full-bodied with a mild level of carbonation. It goes down smooth and silky, with a light touch of creaminess. Beautiful.  Okay, I'm unsure what the actual alcohol content is, on this one. I've seen the IRS as low as 9.4% and as high as 10.5%. We'll just assume that it's in that range. Despite the fact that I can feel it's effects, I can't taste it at all. This is a very tasty and drinkable beer. While this is delicious, at just over 5 years old, I think it still has potential to go for a few more years. This is surely not my absolute favorite Stout, but it's probably a top 10 entry. I'll have to get some bottles to do aging experiments with.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,96
147,1160,WeedKing4,4.05,"22oz bomber pours a pure dark black colour with caramael 2 fingers foam. Taste is of dark malts with a hint of coffee with hops. This is quite drinkable and a decent stout overall. Still not at the top of my list, but its pretty good. No hint of the abv% at all. Very good beer overall, and glad I got to try this one.  Picked up a Limited 2010 spring release last summer. Decided to crack this open with a bit of age on it. Its still a little hot initially, but the roasted espresso/chocolate flavours come through in the finish. I hope to grab another bottle sometime so I can sit on it for a couple more years.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,96
147,1160,clayrock81,4.25,Pours a black vody with a one-finger head that leaves a lace ring fown glass. A great roasted malt smell with some minor sweetness. Extremely smooth and creamy when it first hits my tongue with a burnt chocolate edge alonst with caramel and I think hints of vanilla/molasses. Roasted and coffee malts are pretty abundant in this beer and it finishes dry but a little sweeter than I thought. Smooths as it warms and is a little stickiness that is great as well; ABV only serves to complement beer and this is a sipper you take your time to enjoy.,Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,96
147,1160,MVotter,4.5,"A - The Stone Russian Imperial Stout pours into a chalice the color of a Coke, with little or no head.  S - The smell is nutty, roasted malts, alcohol and coffee.  T - The taste begins with some sweet roasted malts and transitions to a coffee finish. Hints of semi-sweet chocolate and alcohol are also present.  M - The mouthfeel is medium/heavy, with a creamy carbonation. This baby is smooth!  D - Be careful. The 10.5% alcohol is expertly hidden. This is an extremely drinkable brew, a perfect blend of bitter and sweet; another superb offering from Stone.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,96
147,1160,cleeze,4.35,"2008 vintage. This puppy's got a year on her.  Pours a bit like engine oil, viscous and black with a medium frothy brown head. Aroma of dark chocolates, roasted barley, java and a bit of alcohol. Initial flavor has a noticeably roasty profile with some malty sweetness, caramel flavor and residual sugars. The bitterness really comes through in the end with a bit of a charred taste. Mouthfeel is medium heavy, but not as creamy as some imperial stouts. The finish is long, dry and bitter, like a good relationship gone south. Possibly Stone's finest offering.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,96
147,1160,yuriruley,4.01,"Appearance - Looks great, black as night with a nice caramel tan head that hangs on the whole time.  Smell - malts, chocolate and soy sauce smell.  Taste - roasted flavor with a little bitterness and that soy sauce smell I was tasting. Some warmth from the alcohol, but not much.  mouthfeel - rich and creamy, good carbonation.  Drink - Was a slower drink for me, granted it was a 22oz bomber. I'd rather have a 12oz bottle of this stuff.  Overall pretty solid beer. Wish the flavor was a little more balanced. I'd buy it again if it came in a smaller bottle probably. But for the price and drinkability I'd rather buy two 12oz bottles of old rasputin or yeti.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,96
147,1160,jsapunor,4.6,"Pours like motor oil into the glass. Hold it up to the light and suddenly there is no light. This is one black hole of a beer. The head is tan, thick and rich.  The nose is full of malt, chocolate fudge, caramel and coffee with a hint of the alcohol lurking beneath all the rest.  What a wonderful silky mouthfeel! This is so smooth and inviting it invites you to keep going long after good sense would tell you to stop.  This is heaven in a glass! Stone has brewed an incredible blend of chocolate, espresso, malt and molasses. The alcohol is hidden amongst all the rest of the flavors, no mean feat given the ABV.  Stone Imperial Russian Stout is everything it ought to be and much much more. More of these will be coming home all winter long.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,96
147,1160,rosmhuire,3.26,"Poured into a pint glass from a 22 oz bomber  A: Dark black with tan colored head. Head was not significant.  S: Burnt coffee beans, bread undertones, a little bit of chocolate on the nose.  T: Wow - very stong. Bitter burnt coffee beans. Heat present from the alcohol. This is almost too much for me. A RIS is supposed to be a Big Boy, but I think Stone took it a bit too far.  M: Very rich, creamy.  D: Definitely felt the alcohol after I polished off the bomber. Not very drinkable, yet Stone doesn't intend this to be a sessionable beer.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,96
147,1160,Gorillaz,3.95,"A: Midnight black with a rich chocolate colored head; Head lingered in a snifter for a quiet a long time (not recommended, however it concentrated the nose quite a bit)..Definitely worth the wait as the head calmed  S: Strong note of alcohol and coffee; initial sour note followed by a long dark chocolate/coffee scent  T/M: Not for the first time stout drinker. Almost bitter at first, then followed up by a rich dark chocolate feel similar to the Bitter Chocolate Oatmeal Stout (similar, not the same) of the same brewery.  D: To be enjoyed slowly. Not the kind of brew to be had every day, but definitely one that can serve as a proper nightcap to close out a long and stressful day.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,96
147,1160,Jayli,4.32,"Consumed 11/22/09  A: This beer pours a jet black opaque, ink color with virtually no head it it. Not much lacing to speak of.  S: Nose is of a healthy dose of alcohol, roasted malts, molasses, chocolate, and toffee.  T: Taste is very sweet toffee, and caramel up front. Some toasted and roasted malts with a hint of molasses lingering in, fill out the middle. The finish on this beer is of chocolate, a touch of smokiness, and a bit of alcohol.  M: Medium body, low carbonation, creamy body with a clean finish.  D: Alcohol is quite prevalent, dips on the drinkability, however a tasty beer that regardless of alcohol goes down quite smooth and finishes nicely.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,96
147,1160,COBeerBuff,4.37,"Limited Spring 2009 Release...  Appearance: A vigorous pour yields an opaque midnight black liquid with a finger and a half of caramel colored head consisting of large and small bubbles tightly packed together. Overall head retention is pretty solid, slowly dissipating to a nice ring around the glass, and the beer itself looks wonderfully ominous. Not a sliver of light escapes around the edges of the glass.  Smell: This is one of the best smelling RIS's that I've had in quite a while. The bready, toasted malts are big and bold at the front of this beer. There's sweet chocolate combined with roasted vanilla and a smoky caramel scent as well. The toasted grains though are out of this world. It's almost as if someone took a handful of grains from a field, toasted them on an open fire, and then let them soak overnight in the brew. Awesome!  Taste: The initial sip screamed at me that this is a big beer! The booziness is present and not as subtle as I was expecting, but then again, this is a Stone specialty. Initial flavors are sweet and resemble the expected chocolate, vanilla, and toffee notes I picked up from the nose. The aftertaste is all coffee and roasted goodness.  Mouthfeel: This RIS isn't quite as thick or as heavy as I expected. It's a very smooth feeling beer, but the big-ness of the beer also makes it a bit astringent on the tongue. The carbonation is almost perfect, but then again, I've been sitting on this beer for 7-8 months. The alcohol burns a little on its journey down my throat, but the warming qualities are definitely welcome on a chilly fall evening.  Drinkability: This is a very solid RIS. It's definitely a sipper. I can't see having multiple bombers in an evening, and I wouldn't really want to. This bomber will be enjoyed for the remainder of tonight, and that's exactly what I want from this beer. It's a big beer, and it lets you know that, but then again, you knew what you signed up for when you bought a beer from Stone with ""Imperial"" somewhere on the label.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,96
147,1160,taigor,5,"Poured from growler into 8oz glass.  A - Pitch black like coffee, completely non-transparent. Huge head that leaves a significant lacing throughout the glass while you're drinking this beer.  S - Malt with chocolate and coffee.  T - Very complex malt taste with dark bitter chocolate and hints of coffee.  M - Full bodied, creamy with tons of carbonation.  D - This beer is definitely a sipper but the aroma and taste are so exceptional that you cannot resist having another one ... or two.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,96

Sparse islands of brown bubbles sit on the surface.  S - Rich and deep aromas - lots of coffee, dark chocolate/bakers chocolate, some licorice, a touch of molasses. Maybe a touch of alcohol in the nose. Not getting any hops in here. Really good smelling RIS.  T - Very nicely balanced. Lots of coffee and dark roasted malts. Licorice is there in the background. Definitely not a sweet RIS, balanced toward the bitter side. Quite nice. Very smooth and rich.  M - Thick and chewy. Feels very slick and oily on the tongue. Carbonation is on the lower side, but enough to give some life and a light tingle on the tongue.  D - For RIS's this one sets the standard for drinkability. Very smooth - no hotness from the alcohol. Everything is balanced really well. Complex and filled with roasty flavors and aromas. Very, very good.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,96

147,1160,Mistofminn,4.4,"Thanks to DeaconBluez for sending me a bottle of this. Thankfully (you'll see why in a second...) I purchased a second bottle of this in Hudson, WI the other weekend.  The first bottle I opened (not sure if it was DeaconBluez or not) was definitely infected. I was really pissed off, because I so looked forward to having this beer and holding on to one, but now I had to open my second bottle to make sure I wasn't crazy. The first bottle tasted and smelled like it was brewed with Brett, no qualities of a RIS anywhere, so I took a few sips to confirm my fears, and drain poured it. This review is reflected solely upon the second, non-infected bottle.  Poured into a tulip glass, this is thick and rich deep black with a nice two finger brown head. Head has good retention and leaves lacing all over the glass. One of my favorite qualities in a beer is when the lacing leaves clear lines of where your previous levels of liquid were, and this one is one of the best.  The nose is roasted malts, bitter coffee, even some subtle hop characteristics left over from this past spring. Very characteristic of a quality Russian Imperial Stout. It's subtle, and not over the top, but very complex and enticing. Good stuff. Oh, yeah...one more thing. Alcohol is absolutely nowhere to be found, which is more than impressive for a brew north of 10% abv.  The taste is just what the doctor ordered. Roasted malts, bitter chocolate and coffee, subtle earthy hops, dark fruits and just the subtlest hint of alcohol. This is tasty stuff.  Mouthfeel is near perfection. Creamy and smooth, thick and rich. This is everything a Russian Imperial Stout should be and much more. It's like liquid gold. Drinkability is great, I can't imagine a better drinking 10%+ ABV RIS.  Overall, a great brew. I would have been extremely pissed if I didn't have two bottles of this, as the first one was horribly infected. Thankfully the second bottle put my fears aside and I can't wait to have more of this.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,96
147,1160,rapidsequence,4.7,"12 oz bottle from Spring 2008.  Appearance: Completely black, no highlights. Thick, light brown, uneven rocky head. After 20 minutes, there is still a thin layer over the top of the beer. Sheets of lacing with each sip, but just a little sticks.  Smell: Huge, huge rich bitter chocolate and coffee. A little whiff of licorice. Some hops in there too.  Taste: Enormous dark roasted malt tastes like delicious dark chocolate and some coffee with appropriate bitterness. The hops are still there too. Where's the alcohol? This is great.  Mouthfeel: Getting close to perfect. Heavy and full and creamy smooth. The right amount of carbonation rounds this out. Wow.  Drinkability: One of the best.

The color is great but the head is disappointing, only rising about one finger of medium tan that is gone quicly not even leaving a soapy film on the beer. The lacing is light, nothing great.  The aroma is very strong, as I swirl my cup looking at the lacing I can smell its lusciousness wafting my way. The biggest thing is big notes of sweet chocolate, a nice change up from bitter chocolate or coffee. There is also a little hops, and vanilla.  The taste is just like the aroma light chocolate that is balanced well with hops and finishes with at last a bitter coffee.  The mouthfeel is great its nice and full and leaves a lasting taste.  This is very drinkable, can't taste the alcohol at all.  Overall, this is great beer, one of the best I've had. I would love to try an older version and see how it ages.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,96
147,1160,rpstevens,4.18,"Thanks to johngalt1 for this 08 bottle included as an extra. I have been waiting to crack this one, and the weather in New England has me itching for big stouts. Poured into a dogfish head signature glass. The pour yields a deep black body, that lets no light through, with a one finger mocha head. As the head fades it leaves behind a very thick oily lacing.  The smell is roasted coffee, molasses, dark fruits (maybe some cherries, figs), bitter dark chocolate and on top of that a sweet chocolate fudge. Very inviting.  The taste matches the smell and hits all the big notes a RIS is supposed to, faint coffee flavors roll over roasted malts and bitter dark chocolate. The dark chocolate moves right into toffee, dark fruits and caramel and then there is a nice earthy hop undertone that dries out the palate. The aftertaste gives off a nice alcohol heat that encourages me to take another sip.  The beer is lightly carbonated, just enough to let the flavors work together and the beer move through the mouth. The alcohol is just present enough to let you know you're dealing with a big beer, but not cloying or overpowering. Compared to the 09 I have previously tried, the 08 blows it away, very nice.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,96
147,1160,icetrauma,4.62,Poured this outta a 22oz bomber and into my Arrogant Bastard glass. Pours a black as midnight color. A dark tan lacy brown head appears that disappates within 1 minutes time.  Initial smell of this brew was deep roasted malts with scents of roasted java dominating the olfactory.  Taste was big at first sip. Nothing less then expected from Stone. Dark roasted coffee with a touch of prune. Alcohol hits 3/4 way through this brew but is gone by the end. Left with just a touch of hoppiness on the palate. As this fine brew warms up the alcohol becomes more pronounced as do the hops. As I approach 1/2 way through this bomber a warm fuzzy feeling over comes me. Nice. Very nice.  Mouthfeel was thinner then expected at first but then as it warmed the consistency is what I expected. A thick feeling that coated the mouth as this elixer of love was passed over the tongue and into the belly.  Lets face it. This is no session beer. It is a big beer full of flavor that will warm your inards on cool fall evening.,Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,96
147,1160,CHADMC3,4.33,"Pours a deep ebony with a small, but frothy, deep tan head that hangs around for a while leaving a thin, but sticky trail of lacing in its path.  Aroma is big & packed with hearty roasted malt, coffee, milk chocolate, and dark bread notes.  The roasted malt with coffee highlights is absolutely delicious with hints of chocolate nibs, and robust toastyness. The sweetness is more pronounced as the brew warms but at the end the roasted malt returns.  Reserved carbonation, medium to full in body with tons of character and just the right flavors.  Amazing beer, pleasing to all senses, nothing that disappoints, and a fine example of the style. Enjoy!",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,96

Appearance- As dark as tar w/1 finger of head.  Smell- Bourbon and chocolate.  Taste- Bourbon, chocolate, coffee, and cherries.  Mouthfeel- Heavy but satisfying.  Drinkability- It is a sipper, not for the ABV but for the heaviness and tastes.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,96
147,1160,jnezda,4.2,"Poured from a 22oz bottle into a pint glass. Poured a black wonderful consistency with a brown/ dark tan full head, two fingers. The head faded and left good lacing as the beer went down. The aroma is immediate roasted malt with hints of coffee and some chocolate. These smells mirror the tastes as you sample this beer. It is surprisingly smooth and palatable for a Russian Stout and could use a touch more body. The easy drinking quality of this beer makes it a good stout for people used to lighter beers. Due to the light carbonation combined with the perceived thickness I would give this style points and say it is a very enjoyable beer. After enjoying many of the other Stone offerings I was happy to try one that is not for all of us hop heads and continue to be impressed with their offerings.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,96
147,1160,hayesez,3.78,"Been using the site for years, but have never posted my reviews. Figured I'd throw some up here.  The Stone RIS seems like a good place to start as I've had several over the years and enjoy them; a solid beer.  Drank this one on Monday night, during the game. Poured into a tulip glass. A small light tan head that dissipated fairly quickly as I drank. Very thin clear lacing.  An initial light coffee smell that quickly turned to roasted malts. Also a small amount of chocolate. A little more alcoholic smelling than I remember.  The stout tastes very similar to the smell. Large roasted malts with some chocolate finish. The 10.5% certainly comes through and stays around for a bit. It is a bit thinner than I remember but still has that silky feel.  Drinkability became better the warmer the beer became. Again, the stronger alcohol finish made it not quite as enjoyable as many other big stouts that I enjoy.  Overall, a beer I will continue to drink periodically, but not one of my top RIS's.

The first sip was exactly like experiencing your first good beer- it's perfect. There's ruby candy wine smoke with a flowery berry field vapor finish. the nose is a red wine gingerbread with cinnamon. Oh dear god! This is the best beer I have had in a long time. Has everything- good body, good carbonation, and unbelievable flavor. If you have not yet been able to experience this thing, I suggest you get a bottle as soon as you can. Stone has found a way to put transcendence in a bottle.  Note: On a second tasting, I noticed that the taste can be very similar to sherry at times.

147,1160,Daniellobo,4,"A nice Imperial Russian Stout. A bit over-hyped but a great brew nevertheless.  Presentation: 22 Oz bottle. Iconic demon gargoyle with Russian hat holding a glass of beer in the front label. Long and typical Stone over-the-top narrative on the back, somewhat tongue-in-cheek rambling playing on the notion of a perfectly crafted sinful brew, including a brief historic note on the style and brew description. Notes bottling date as ""Limited Spring 2009 Release"". Lacks any other info other than Alc. by Vol (10.5%) and cellaring indications. Poured into a snifter.  A - Black pour with very deep brown edges. Thick light brown foamy head fading to some nice lacing.  S - Chocolate and a bit of roasted coffee over a malt sense hits the nose right away in a very nice balance. Not as intensely aromatic or complex as promised but nice nevertheless.  T - Dark malt flavor, roasted sweetness with small caramel notes and a fruitiness and yeast character typical of most Stone brews. Luckily here it is a note in the background and not that dominant. While flavor is good, again it is not as complex as promised or remembered.  M - Smooth and creamy with adequate carbonation.  D - High drinkability but on this occasion it does not feel particularly remarkable. In fact it is a bit dull towards the end.  Notes: This is one of the brews that early on opened my taste buds to the US craft scene. I must have had one of the early releases since it must have been 01 or 02 when I first had it. I was just amazed at the variety of stouts in the country and almost by chance I ordered to have this one and was psyched to see a bomber land on my table, and totally awed when I tasted it. A lot has happened since and while I still like it, I don't find it as extraordinary as I once did. It might be part of the brew but certainly I have expanded my palate. This revisit to Stone's RIS was nice but fell short of the memories I had from those early years in the US.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,96
147,1160,Freethyhops,4.4,"22oz bottle split with a friend. 2009. Poured into a pint glass.  A- pours pitch black with just less than a finger of dark brown head that reduces to almost nothing within a minute or two.  S- huge roasted coffee on the nose. some sweet molasses and chocolate in the backround. some pungent stuff, too.  T- tons of chocolate and roasted malts up front and a big bitterness kick in the end blend together to create an awesome coffee/espresso flavor. An extremely well balanced beer for having to blend such big flavors together.  M/D- the feel of this beer is what really sets it off IMO. It's so thick and creamy with just a subtle carbonation to remind you that this beverage is a beer, not something from Starbucks. I could drink a bomber of this stuff every night. At least untill my liver completely shuts down. It's just one of those beer where you can't put down the glass.

Licorice,a ripe red fruit(strawberry?) that really sets this one apart, black currant, tobacco.  T- Milk chocolate, burnt malt. Less fruity than the nose with more of the dry tobacco quality. Vinous with blackberry almost like ruby port.  M- Thick and rich without being syrupy and suprisingly velvety carbonation.  D- Doesn't drink like it's 10.5%. A really well made beer.

A-Jet black, very dark with a nice 1 finger thick chocolate milk colored head that is very thick and producing nice lacing on the glass. Head dissapated slowly but stayed around the outside of the glass the entire time.  S-Roasted coffee beans and some really dark bitter chocolate, molasses/maple syrup, definate roasted malt smell.  T-Very very dark chocolate but very smooth and creamy, then you get a huge burst of roasted coffee, followed by some date/fig flavors, the hops are nearly gone on this but there is a bitter citrus looming on the finish but not much as the dark malt flavors quickly disperse the bitterness.  M-Nice big/heavy body, very thick beer, as it should be. Alcohol is present but not overpowering. Carbonation is present and definately takes a back seat to the overpowering flavors and alcohol.  D-Very nice Beer, gonna try to finish this bomber by myself. Normally I would share this beer with at least one other person.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,96
147,1160,BamaBeerBuff,4.43,"Note: this is a 12 oz bottle, released in fall of 2008 in a small batch. I'm not totally sure, but I think these were leftovers from a shipment of IRS to Japan. Either way, it's been laying down for a year, so let's see how that year treated it.  A: This is what an imperial stout should look like. Absolutely jet black in color, so black that the black is radiant/eye-catching (if that makes sense). Head is a thick, dense, and incredibly firm layer of thick, creamy foam, reminiscent of that seen on the finest nitro-stouts, but it's a hell of a lot darker with more texture to boot. Thick lacing all the way down the glass with a solid cap of foam with a central dollop of cream atop the beer throughout. A great looking stout.  S: Aroma is beastly. Dark fudge mashed up with dark roast coffee beans, mixed with molasses and a hearty helping of dark fruits. An oak-like vanilla is present, too. Interestingly enough, there's a substantial waft of citrus hop aroma bellowing out of the glass, as well. The aroma is quite balanced and nuanced, and doesn't seem to be overly burnt or roasted like some others in the style. Still, even at a year there's a decent helping of alcohol that remains. We'll see how the next bottle is a year from now.  T&M: Monster of a beer. Loads and loads of flavor, so I'll just list each in order of its apperance--creamy dark chocolate, espresso, dates, anise, roasted grains, fruity citrus notes in the background. Alcohol has a generous presence, though it contributes much more than it detracts. Body is thicker than oil with a silky, viscous feel. Finish is extremely long and lingers with hoppy bitterness (yes, hoppy!) and a hint of malt flavor. A dry one, for sure.  D: A sipper if there ever was one. Still, the flavors are rich and decadent, though not overpoweringly so. Complexity keeps it very interesting, but it's still balanced and coherent. A well-crafted beer, and one that will need to still sit in my cellar probably another year before I take another crack at it. Still, I'm quite pleased that I decided to open this bottle tonight.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,96
147,1160,Squelch,3.95,Appearance: jet black. Tan head. Opaque. Beautiful.  Smell: nice roasted aromas with some english hop aromas evident. Smells appetizing  Taste: roasted and toasted flavors dominate with a nicely balanced hop bitterness. No hop flavor. Would like a little more rounded and complex malt profile.  Mouthfeel: nice. Not astringent.  Drinkability: excellent sipper. Will have again,Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,96
147,1160,khiasmus,4.02,"We vaulted last night at 0400 hours. A jump behind enemy lines. Thick and black night with a good portion of brown smoke wafting atop in the moonlight. Our purpose is clear, our mission deadly. The dark brown soon fades, leaving a few spots of lace behind in our minds, or perhaps it's the gunfire flashes glancing off of the spots of cloud... We must not be seen, we must be black as the abyss around us. The deadly aroma fills the air around us, we try to quietly run with our packs and our guns. There is only death or glory. It wafts over us, earthy, sweet and organic, as well as hard and mechanical, the oil from the tanks. Milk chocolate and sweet cream, carob and vanilla bean. The burnt black of oil like so much dark roasted grain, the aroma filling the sky behind us as we trek on, away from one flame and into another. And the flavour assaults the senses as the aroma had caressed them... Acrid burnt grain and a hint of the smoke that lingers on our fatigues, combined with the mildest milky, lactose-sweet, chocolate flavours, and finishing with a light warming note of alcohol. Dry, it's dry, and the warmth keeps us from freezing as we press on. We're not as full as we'd like... the body is rather light, actually, for this style, but we have little to change that. The body is thick, don't misunderstand, it has to be. It's simply not as full as the style generally demands. So we have to trek on, the burns in our thighs, ignore, they don't matter. Press on for a brighter tomorrow, because the world is governed by force. Our heartbeats pound, every breath screams in our heads, Death or Glory, Death or Glory.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,96
147,1160,goblue3509,3.48,"Pours a dark cola color with no light able to get through. There is a brownish head that is thick and gives way to some moderate lacing. The smell is of roasted malts with a hint of chocolate and a slight alcohol smell. The taste is of chocolate tones with a roasted malt backbone, the taste mask the alcohol fairly well, however, the taste of alcohol becomes more prevelant the more you consume this beer. The mouthfeel was silky yet a little slick, the alcohol presence i thought was felt more through the mouthfeel than the taste. Overall it is a very good beer, however, after consuming more and more I began to notice the mouthfeel coming out more and more along with the alcohol, overall a solid good beer.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,96
147,1160,NittanyBeerFan,4.33,"Had a glass of the 2008 Stone IRS on tap at TJ's East Coast/West Coast Throwdown. Reviewing from my detailed notes from that day.  A: Poured into an outward-flared tulip glass. Even held up to light, this beer is completely opaque black. Absolutely no light gets through...not even around the edges. Head is creamy and frothy and dark. Lacing comes in random thin patterns from top to bottom.  S: The dominant aromas here, as one might expect, are dark roasted malts and dark chocolate. The beer has some slight remnants of hops, but more notably, there are some notes of vanilla.  T: In the taste, the roasted malts hit first. The give way to bitter dark chocolate flavors and coffee. Despite the high alcohol, the age has mellowed this beer out nicely. There are also some burned sugars with hints of vanilla hiding in the background.  M/D: The bitterness is biting initially. The finish is dry and malty, incredibly smooth down the pipe. There is a silky character to this beer. Despite the high ABV, this is so delicious that I wish I had some of this every night.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,96
147,1160,movingtrain,4.33,"22 ounce bomber sampled from a snifter.  I remember, many years ago, buying a bottle of this with a good friend. This was before our palates had developed, and before we really knew what a RIS actually was. We hated it.  So, here I am today...years later, trying it again. And, right off the bat, the smell is intoxicating.  Pours an excellent shade of black with a nice cream/tan colored, thinly present head. Mostly, there is a bit clinging to the sides of the glass.  Smells of oak, caramel, cedar, vanilla, chocolate. There is some alcohol in the nose, for sure. Smells bitter-sweet...like baker's chocolate.  The taste is creamy, bitter-sweet. Notes of chocolate, brown sugar, maple syrup, espresso.  The alcohol is very present in this one...which I think is why I didn't care for it when I tried it before. But the alcohol is well-balanced, giving a nice, warming sensation as it goes down. It complements the intense flavors involved in this beer, letting them linger for a long time on the tongue and down the back of the throat.  This is a top-notch beer...one to be reckoned with for sure.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,96
147,1160,afausser,4.35,"Spring 2009 Release, so aged a few months.  Appearance-pours a thick, almost opaque, dark brown, with two fingers of fluffy coffee colored head. The head quickly disappears but leaves a nice ring of lacing behind. Tiny streams of bubbles are the only movement you can see in this beer, and they just...don't...stop.  smell-A smoky, heavy, dark chocolate coffee. Notes of dark fruits (raisins and prunes) and molasses. You can definitely smell the alcohol.  taste-Even bigger than the smell. There is the initial heavy bitter taste, but it's also very sweet, with a heavy molasses taste and hints of brown sugar. Again, there's a very smoky, earthy taste, along with the taste of roast coffee beans, and again, there's the taste of raisins and prunes. You can taste the alcohol, but remarkably very little for the ABV.  mouthfeel-Very good. Enough carbonation to keep it easy to drink, but also very smooth and creamy.  Drinkability-Very drinkable. The fact that it goes down so smoothly and that the alcohol is masked so well is even more impressive.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,96

The head falls away quickly leaving almost nothing behind in the way of the head but a lot of lacing, especially considering the tiny scale of the original head.  Smell is far weaker than I was expecting. There is some sweetness, some malt, not a lot of roast and I can detect some alcohol in there as well. No hop aroma.  Mouthfeel is good, not too thick not thin at all. The flavor is sweet, with a lot of roast in the back. I can taste some of the alcohol. High drinkability. The roast completely clears leaving no aftertaste. This is a superb RIS.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,96

147,1160,ClevoPiwo,4.23,"Pours a thick, opaque black. No back lit highlights or varying hues, this beer is black as pitch. The head is nice and brown, dissipates into a nice frothy ring around the edge of the beer.  Smell is very big. Lots of roasted malt, dark fruit sweetness, bitter chocolate, molasses and a distinct presence of alcohol. This beer isn't kidding around or trying to be subtle.  Just like the smell suggests, the taste is huge. Viscous, nearly syrupy mouth feel with just enough carbonation. Creamy and sweet up front, molasses and dark fruit, perhaps some hints of chocolate. Bitter and roasted flavors come through next, lingering into the aftertaste which also has a decent alcohol presence. Very creamy throughout.  This is one hell of a beer. Would definitely be enjoyable if it were 20 below. Had an 07 vintage of this a few days ago, still had a big alcohol kick but the molasses sweetness and fruit came through much more.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,96
147,1160,Lldeegan,4.2,"First off, the name to me is funny but a fitting, mocking style of names. Stone's Russian Imperial Stout, named Imperial Russian Stout, just begs for the chance to hear someone make the mistake of disorganizing the set of words. The beer pours a thick deep black with a mocha head that depletes into a brown soapy film with some lacing down the glass. The initial smell is a deep licorice, with some roasty dark chocolate. The taste of the beer is quite opposite, with a bitter black coffee and dark chocolate up front, and a licorice sweet with some alcohol heat on the back. It has an oily thick sweetness to it on the mouth. A very thick beer, perfectly low carbonation. Honestly, the 10% punch this beer packs is suprisingly masked. Stone comes across as a beer that pulls no punches so the lack of the alcohol heat is a pleasant surprise, although on second thought, such a drinkable beer at 10.5% is a touch sinister. Well played, Stone.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,96
147,1160,boogyman,3.91,"I have been waiting to drink this for a while. Bottle says early spring 2009 release so this is a good 4-6 months since bottled.  A- Poured into my trusty tulip glass. Color is pure black with a huge tan head at around 2-2 1/2 fingers. After a few minutes it settles with some bubbles on top with some peripheral suds on the edges of the liquid.  S- Slight coffee and a little bit of chocolate. Definitely some dark malts in there. Overall the smell is fairly subtle, nothing too pungent on the nose. Can't wait for the taste.  T- Most definitely coffee with some slight chocolate notes. Very similar to the nose but instead on the palate. I am having trouble detecting anything else besides that. Maybe a bit of dark fruit, but only every so slight. Comparing this to other RISs, it is not nearly as complex on the palate or smell. That would the the biggest downfall for me of this brew.  M- Nice and thick. I am liking the thicky chewyness of this brew. No bubbly feel, but that is the way it should be for the style. Smooth going down. Where is the alcohol? No burning going down.  D- Even though this isn't the best and most flavorful RIS I have had, I could drink a lot of these, which makes this RIS much more dangerous then others. Definitely get this and try it fresh and try it after a few months, the flavor changes.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,96

Black, it has a medium-brown head steadily shrinking to a wispy top and rich, foamy ring, with a little foamy lace.  The aroma is charcoal, strong stewed prunes and raisins, hint of dark chocolate, earthy leavs, and overall a smokey quality.  The taste is up front very alcoholic, with very intense smokey leaves, prunes and rum, sweetness with hot, spicey alcohol and just barely dominant leafy-spicey bitterness. It starts too intense and a bit harsh, with sweet prune aftertaste and alcoholic warmth. It reveals nothing underneath. However, it then settles down into a more charascterful, more balanced and complex beer. It stays fairly intense, but not overly so, with strong charred leaves, strong alcohol, a bit rummy, slightly burnt prunes, some spice and leaves. It becomes much more drinkable at the same time. It is slightly oily but not very.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,96

There was little foam, but that may have been a result of the waiter not picking it up right away from the bartender. The smell and taste were much more subdued than I was expecting. Coffee was present in both, but was fairly subtle. I was surprised at the subtly of this beer since Stone is so aggressive in other beer styles. I expected an aggressive coffee flavor. Instead, I tasted a rich complexity of coffee and chocolate balancing each other. It was suprisingly sweet and light even though it had a thick mouthfeel. It reminded me of a porter with more complexity. Dangerously drinkable for a 10.5% ABV. One really needs to be careful drinking this beer because the alcohol is entirely masked.

The mocha-tinted head foamed up nice too, then settled after a little bit. When I poured it, I could get a hint of the scent, which is a really REALLY strong alcohol smell with some coffee thrown in for good measure. This is a fitting ""Russian"" beer... The flavor has nice roasted malt flavor, some molasses, some alcohol bite to it. I'm sure there are other flavors in there too, but it's kinda murky with this beer and hard to detect specific tastes. Extremely smooth though, with just a hint of sour aftertaste. I would definitely have this one again...but only one at a time because this sucker has a 10.5% ABV.

This beer is a punch of flavors, and the first noticeable flavor is the roasted malt, then hints of dark chocolate. It lingers with a light nutty flavor and leaves no bitter aftertaste. Absolutely wonderful.  Mouthfeel - This beer is thick, almost no carbonation probably due to aging, and feels very nice.

This beer would look prettier with more, but really with the smell and taste it has, I'm not sure it needs to be a looker.  S- Smells, well boozy. Like bourbon, combined with deep roasted coffee, perhaps, a coffee infused bourbon. Some dark fruit notes, kinda fig or raisin. A really inviting smell, and strong enough to satisfy my nose.  T- This beer tastes even more delicious than it smells. The bourbon is still there, but with an even more vanilla presence. And the roast is there, but is even stronger, combined with a bit of both dark bittersweet, and milk chocolate. I'm not going to say a lot about the taste, but it's complex and awesome and amazing and I wish I had bought another bottle of this.  M- Chewy, like a piece of chocolate cake topped with a coffee bean.  D- Really great. The alcohol isn't hidden per say but only shows itself in bourbon flavors and not too much in the actual burn.

147,1160,jamescain,4.72,"Just as the bottle states it is thick as the Russian crude. While pouring this beer you can see how thick it is. Normal beers have the appearance of pouring like water when compared to this stuff. Its dark, very dark, so dark that when you hold it up to the light it seems to absorb the light and get darker. It produces head very little head, which is tan in color but doesn't remain for long.  Compared to most Russian Imperial Stouts there was a strong presence of hops. I guess this should be expected from Stone. It smells of dark chocolate, roasted malts and what can best be described as toffee. It's hard to drink this beer because it smells so good, but it taste even better.  The beer is very malty and has a relative strong alcohol taste to it, but it is 10.2 % alcohol. This beer is full of big flavor. Full of dark chocolate, full of coffee, and full of malts. This beer is probably better if kept and aged for a while to maybe reduce some of the alcohol taste, but its hard to wait.  It was pretty carbonated and yet still smooth, which made for an interesting blend. It's hard to drink and about half of a glass will get you pretty tipsy, but this is what I have come to expect from Stone.  I highly recommend this one and to date is probably my favorite Russian Imperial stout because of the complexity of it. If you can buy a few and drink them every couple of months and enjoy the journey of the beer.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,96
147,1160,alleykatking,4.13,"Bottle from 2008. Poured from 22oz bottle.  A- Pours a deep black color. When held up to the light there is a little light around the edges of the glass and that is about it showing some lighter brown highlights to the beer. I only got about a 1/2 finger dark tan/light mocha brown head which didn't stick around for long at all. Not really any lacing to speak of. Some stuff clings to the sides of the glass and slides down back into the beer in a matter of seconds.  S- First off I was still surprised as how much of a hop presence there was in this beer. I mean it was not overwhelming in the slightest but after a year and some months I thought it might be almost nonexistant. Just my opinion and now on to the other scents in the nose. I got a mixure of the piney/light floral hops, coffee, roasted malts, toffee, hints of darker fruits, and some chocolate. This has a very mouthwatering effect on me as I sit here and just sniff away at it.  T- Big burnt/roasted upfront in this beer. Big chocolate taste to this that wasn't in the nose. Coffee and toffee hints are the next big flavors I pick up along with some roasted malts. Big and rich to say the least. The hops come through in the end for me in this beer and even those seem to have a toasted flavor going along with them. A bit boozy in the back end for me which knocks off half a point. Could use maybe another year of cellaring to calm that aspect of this beer down.  M- Heavy mouthfeel on this beer. Carbonation is pretty good for this. Has a slick oily feel on the palate and leaves a toasted/roasted taste on the tongue. Nice aftertaste of coffee and chocolate with some roasted malts with this one.  D- This is a sickly drinkable beer from Stone. But hey what do you expect from them? I have a couple more in the cellar that I'm going to sit on for a little while to see what happens to them.

147,1160,cbutova,4.35,"Re-entering my deleted review from the last site crash. Hope I can get it all back to how it was.  Mini vertical tasting with the 2008 and 2009 release. Had this one a few times before, finally reviewing it.  2009 (6 months old): Pours into my snifter with a pitch black motor oil color with an awesome dark tan coffee ice cream colored head. Medium lacing is left as I drink this bad boy, decent head retention. Smells of roasted malts, chocolate, coffee and a bit of an alcohol bite. Tastes of roasted malts, lots of chocolate, coffee and an amount of alcohol that goes perfectly with a big Russian Imperial. Mouthfeel is thick, oily, and leaves a huge coating of flavor on the tongue, also very warm from the alcohol. Drinkability is good, it is definitely worth the price for such a big beer with great taste, the alcohol will not ruin the taste over time and the flavors will hold their ground and not be thrown off. The alcohol content will hit you fast on this one.  2008 (18 months old): Same mouthfeel and apperance. The major difference that my friend and I noticed was the alcohol bite in the nose and taste of this year's release is big, much more than that of the 2009. I guess that makes sense as there might be a bit of yeast reacting in this one.

Deep chocolate flavor with sweetness that makes your teeth almost hurt. Coffee, toffee and everything that should be represented by a RIS, I was amazed at the thick mouthfeel and the deep flavors from a 4.99 bomber. Can't wait to go back and stock up on a couple of these to save for later this fall/Winter.  I could drink two of these, but would probably not want to in one sitting.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,96
147,1160,scottyshades,4.7,"A: Pours a very thick and viscous black color with absolutely no highlights, even when held to light. The head is nice and tight, mocha in color, retains exceptionally well throughout the entire 22oz bomber, and leaves thick sheets of lacing along the glass. Absolutely perfect score.  S: Very robust nose. Roasted/burnt malts are present and up-front, copious amounts of dark fruits (raisins, figs, plums, dates,). Caramel, molasses, coffee/espresso, toffee, and an amazing hop profile that really brings this one to a whole new level. The hops are perfectly balanced and very aromatic. The alcohol is apparent (especially when it warms), but considering the ABV, it is very well hidden.  T: Very similar to the nose. All of the roasted/burnt goodness is present, along with caramel, coffee/espresso, molasses, (didn't get toffee in the flavor), and TONS of dark fruits that seem to blend in pretty well...again, raisins (very noticeable), dates, figs, plums/prunes, and dark cherry. The only difference between the nose and the flavor are the hops. In the flavor, the hops are definitely bitter (also aromatic), and when combined with the malts, this makes one big beer. My only complaint is that the alcohol is a little overwhelming when the beer warms a few degrees.  MF/D: Superior viscosity...one of the thickest I've come across. Very smooth and creamy, long burnt/bitter finish with a touch of alcohol.  For $5.50 a bomber, this is an amazing deal. Also, widely available. Another amazing example from Stone.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,96

Its smooth, deep and syrupy with notes of molasses, currants and cocoa, Im loving the cocoa in here! Alcohol warmth all the way through.

Sipping reveals...wow! heavenly...bakers chocolate up front along with a dark toffee overtones. Wonderfully complex! Toasted malts also are apparent.

I would prefer the scent to be stronger, but I think that the taste makes up for it.  Tastes of coffee and molasses, dark fruits and slight hop bite is perceivable. Dark chocolate and toffee flavors. Feels a bit oily, but is smooth as silk on the way down. Not very light, but also not too thin. Just about perfect. Very drinkable, maybe a little too so.

Inky black with purple highlights and a light brown soapy head that settles out quickly.  Aroma of sharp coffee and licorice, bitter chocolate.  Flavors of espresso and molasses, licorice and leather. Some smokey notes, hints of port, some cherry tartness. Notes of both milk chocolate and dark bitter chocolate move in and out. Assertive bitterness without a hoppy flavor presence. Scary smooth for the ABV strength.

The head retreats fast leaving only the thinnest ring encompassing the top of the glass. Lacing is almost non existent.  Aroma is what you would expect from an RIS, yet I am somewhat let down with the lack of intensity. A spring 2009 release, hops are very much noticeable. Dark roasted malt smells lead the way being trailed by a generous dose of chocolate fudge. Molasses is present in the nose, much like a slight coffee aroma both smells are subtle.  Deep rich flavors are abundant. Dark roasted malt flavor with a slight bit of char are the first to greet the tongue. Chocolate flavors are rich but flavors are more bittersweet then what would be imagined from the nose. Hoppy bitterness from large fresh RIS's seem to be rather offensive to some but I find the addition to be welcomed. Much like the aroma the coffee notes are more subtle. Sweetness is rather understated more or less being overshadowed by the deeper flavors, I would imagine though that this changes with age.  Mouthfeel is full but not thick. Drinks smooth and creamy finishing only the slightest bit oily.  Absolutely a fantastic brew but leaves me underwhelmed. Drinks wonderfully easy and is remarkably enjoyable. The shortcomings are not deal breakers but more or less personal preference for the style. Definitely one to revisit in the future. While I came away moderately disappointed Stone IRS is truly a top notch RIS.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,96
147,1160,Mavajo,4.04,"Good lord, talk about chugging oil. Black. The head started off slow, but then exploded and kept expanding at the end - although I did begin to pour a little more aggresively towards the end. Very large, light brown head - extremely creamy. My head retained for quite a while before reducing down to a thick ring around the glass.  As for the taste...intense. Very strong and bitter coffee/chocolate flavors. Unbelievably smooth mouthfeel - incredibly creamy. This beer leaves a very distinct ""espresso"" aftertaste. The booze is noticeable, but I feel like it's kept well in the background.  This beer challenges me a bit more than I like, but it's absolutely of the highest quality. If you're a fan of what this beer is aiming to be, then you'll be in heaven.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,96
147,1160,deleted_user_357747,4.77,"Bomber bought at LiquorMax in Loveland. Poured into a chalice-like glass.  A- Pours thick black, like motor oil. Nice big brown bubbly head. Hella thick, hella black, hella awesome. Wish the head stuck around longer. Little lacing to speak of.  S- Whoa nelly, this here's a big boy! Coffee, molasses, raisins, vanilla, malt that reminds me exactly of the Celebrator I reviewed earlier today, nice light alcohol backdrop. Serious stout aroma. Boo ya!  T- Again, this is a big beer! Coffee and malt, of course, but buried deep in there are wood, hops, toffee, a sort of ""fishy"" taste (not a bad thing) and a creamy characteristic that is my favorite part of this beer. Alcohol isn't overpowering either, in fact, it's pretty well hidden, although I'm sure I'll find it at the bottom of this bomber. Very unique for this style, and I really like it. Tasty tasty.  M- Chewy and thick, big body and the right amount of carbonation. Feels good to swirl it through my teeth.  D- Drinkability suffers because this is such a damn big beer, it may be a struggle to finish this whole thing after I just ate a huge dinner. Better to split this with people.

147,1160,mothman,4.17,"Spring 2008 Release  Pours about 1/4 of a finger of dark tan head that fades to a thin ring around the glass. Not a lot of lace here. We will simply call the color black and leave it at that.  Aroma: Chocolate, coffee, toffee, roasted malts, dark fruits, earthy hops. The smell is very mouthwatering. I am enjoying it so far.  Wow, the taste is very rich and roasted. Lots of chocolate, toffee, caramel, some booze, dark fruits, and earthy hops. A big amount of roasted/burnt hops in this one. The dark fruit portion is pretty dominate in this RIS. I like it, but it is quite boozy.  Mouthfeel: Rich, smooth, hot, and a little bitter near the end. I can really tell there are a ton of hops in this beer from the mouthfeel. Full bodied with a lot of carbonation. Ends with a fairly clear burnt malt flavored aftertaste.  Overall, I am really enjoying this beer and I am glad the serving size is a 12 oz bottle. A bomber would be too much for me. I like, but it is nothing I am falling in love with.

147,1160,Tom8Analise,4.9,"Please note that the Stone Russian Imperial Stout that I had was a 2008 that had already been aging for at least one year.  A - Thick black stout that sticks to the side of the glass as you slightly swirl it.  S - Even smells thick with an aroma that is full of coffee and fruit notes...extremely comparable to the Kate The Great that I recently had.  T - Very smooth with barely any carbonation. Again, very comparable to Kate The Great with complex fruit and coffe undertones.  M - Easy to take down with a smooth full body.  D - Could easily enjoy quite a few glasses at a slow pace but it was a very filling beer (in a good way).  The '09 Stone Russian Imperial Stout was also an exceptional beer in my opinion but not in the same ballpark as one that had already been aging for over a year.  Cheers!!!

147,1160,JohnQVegas,4.32,"Bottle into snifter. This is a Spring '08 release, consumed in late September, '09.  Pure black, motor oil shimmy, thin coating of brown bubbles that dissipates fairly quickly. Fantastic stickage, and nice lacing.  Nose is packed with vinous dark fruits, dark chocolate, licorice, molasses, with some lingering citrus hop notes underneath.  Taste is full of chocolate, dark fruits (lightly vinous), burnt (even roasty) caramel and loads of licorice, sweet and rich. There's some lingering citrus hops towards the finish that contribute a light to moderate lingering bitterness with just a touch of charred malt on the finish. Nice alcohol burn that isn't overwhelming at all.  Mouthfeel is thick and chewy, with a sharp carbonation underneath that accentuates the burn from the alcohol.  Drinkability is good, delicious beer but not amazing in its drinkability - any beer where I can literally feel the alcohol burn shouldn't be getting higher than a 4 from me, even if I do believe it fits well with the flavor profile.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,96
147,1160,ricke,4.3,"2008 vintage. Cellared for about a year.  A: Black with a small brown and thick head, Nice lacings. A really good looking beer.  S: Very balanced and round, yet with plenty of bold aromas. Hard roasted malts, chocolate, vanilla, dark fruits and coffee - all listed in order of strength. Some alcohol in the nose.  T: Really good, smooth and powerful at the same time. It's similar to the smell with lots of roasted malts, chocolate, coffee and vanilla. Wonderful subtle fruity notes. The finish is quite bitter with a faint hop note, wood and a hint of licorice. The alcohol provides a warming feeling in the finish. It develops nicely in the glass - the roasted character and the fruity notes gain strength as the chocolate takes a step back.  M: Not overly full-bodied. Smooth mouthfeel and mellow carbonation.

Spring 2009 Limited Release 22oz bomber.  A: Syrupy dark brown verging on black, has an enormous brown sugar colored head, about an inch and a half thick, from an aggressive pour. Pretty darn dark when held to the light, a few garnet highlights towards the bottom of the glass. Excellent lacing, and fair head retention.  S: Roasted barley, molasses, chocolate, coffee, brown sugar, a little bit of alcohol in there as well, has some hoppy notes as well, but they're really lost in the fray here. Pretty damn nice.  T: Lots from the nose is carried over rich milk chocolate flavor with a huge dark roast coffee as well, brown sugar sweetness is there, a little too noticeable on the alcohol, but it still isn't that overbearing. Definite hop bitterness mixed in with the roasted malt, and alcohol. Really tasty, but the alcohol is just a little too unrefined here.  M: Quite thick and viscous, very little carbonation, dry from the alcohol, and pretty warm going down. Hits all the notes about right. Quite sticky on the lips as well.  D: Fairly easy drinking beer, has a lot of nice flavors and strong flavors, but the booze is just noticeable enough to not really want to crack another one open. One 22oz serving is more than enough.

This could be textbook!Lightly smoky aroma, with hints of cocoa powder and coffee. The flavour puts me in mind of an imperial oatmeal stout. Off the bat I taste oats mixing in with a rich melange of roasted malts. Some dark fruit, tobacco and alcohol round things out. Its very good all round, but its still not top tier in my oppinion - rather just solidly made.

Immediately, smells of chocolate, dark fruits, and roasted coffee, like magic, seem to appear out of nowhere. Really, does it get any better than this? I don't think so. Wow! What a mouthfeel! The flavor of roasted malts and chocolate hit you like there is no tomorrow. You know you're drinking something special when all the flavors are able to mask the 10.5% ABV like it's not even there!  For a beer that is relatively inexpensive, and is always available, I wonder why I seek out other stout's? Do I see myself looking for something better, something to put this over-the-top? The fact of the matter is, I am looking for something that just so happens to be right in front of my face. Highly recommended! ~",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,96

147,1160,apbarwood,5,"Had a glass of the '06 vintage and it was far and away the best stout I have ever tasted. Poured nice and dark, nearly opaque, with a perfect coffee-like foam on top that was never-ending. The smell was absolutely sensational. Loads of sweet malty flavors, chocolate, nougat, caramel, vanilla and a slight smoky aroma. One of the most powerful aromas I've ever had in a stout, it just leaped out of the glass. The taste delivered pretty much what the aroma promised. The bitterness was more pronounced in the taste but well integrated with the malt flavors. The bet way to describe it is that it tasted like a Toblerone bar, midway between milk and dark chocolate with a nougat/honey biscuity quality. Full-flavored with a nice medium body. I couldn't find anything wrong with this beer. One of the best brews I've had in my life. As I said, I've only had the '06 vintage so I'm not sure how the new vintages will compare. That being said, I would definitely like to hold on to this for a few years but I'm sure it's pretty close to perfect in it's freshest state.

Perfect for a late night when the wife's gone to bed and you're watching a college football game on the tube. I have gone beer-less for four or five days so this is a nice beer to break the ice again. Priced at $7.69 at Midtown Liquors in Nashville, TN, it's respectfully priced for a beer with such a good reputation. Initially, the appearance is the best thing going. But I'm going to give this one time to warm up to room temp before I proceed on my review... Contrary to my wife, who believes all beer is the same, this Stone offering is an EXCELLENT example of an Imperial Russian Stout. As it warms up, I can really smell the roastiness, coffeeness, and taste the oily goodness. Yum. Will definitely need to pick up another on my next trip to the beer store. This is my new favorite from Stone. Great job, guys.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,96

A - Black and oily pour with a nice brown head that lasts and good lacing.  S - Aroma is strong roasted malt and coffee, maybe some dark fruits too.  T - Burnt malt flavor, strong coffee with cream, and dark chocolate. Slight hint of roasted meat in the '06, and dark fruits present, more so in some vintages than others.

A slightly alcoholic sweetness at first, followed by dark chocolate notes and a very dark roasted, almost burnt, malt character. Some vanilla and oak notes in the background. Finish is sweet with just a faint shadow of hop bitterness.  M: Very full bodied with moderate carbonation. The carbonation level does a good job in lightening up an otherwise massive beer.

Smell: gobs of chocolate and alcohol, a little coffee and malt. Just what I want in a RIS.  Taste: slightly fruity alcohol and enough bitterness to stand up to the malt. At first, some of that great chocolate character from the nose failed to come through in the flavor, but as my glass warms up I'm getting more of that smooth chocolate which is just heavenly on the tongue.  Mouthfeel: thick and coating without being too much to handle. For the style, there's a relatively high level of carbonation here which lends a creaminess to the event. Great!  Drinkability: frankly, most RISs cannot break the 4.0 drinkability limit for me. The flavors are usually great, but the cumulative effect of all that malt plus the Herculean alcoholic content just pull that number down.

After the exciting smell, the taste does not disappoint. Bitter dark chocolate, French roasted coffee, it's initially sweet but finishes with a nice bitter espresso finish.  the mouthfeel is pretty interesting. It's full, rich, and thick, but it is also well carbonated. Maybe I would like it less carbonated...but it does help with the drinkability  even on a pretty full stomach this beer is pretty hard to put down, it's very rich but it's not sickly rich...like i said, the carbonation might be slightly high, it seems to make it easier to drink  Overall, this is an excellent beer.

The smell almost too light to pickup was not bad, but was nothing to bragging to your friends about. Tiny hints of espresso and chocolate arose from the glass. I tipped the glass took the first sip. Ah utter bliss! They say don't let looks decieve you and this holds true with this beer! Very rich in the dark chocolate flavor with a fair balance of espresso to break through the boldness of the chocolate, smooth carmal flavors that flow over the peripherals of the tongue and a superb syrupy finish that coats the mouth.

147,1160,cbarrett4,4.97,"Poured into a tulip glass. Noticed a surprising lack of a head though there was some carbonation noticable in the beer once poured. The color is dark, almost completely opaque with minimal effervesence. Once the glass was brought to the nose, the joy began. This amazing brew displayed a burnt toffee, espresso, caramel, molasses, black currant, and prune nose. Imagine pouring a burnt espresso over a caramel and currant tart. Wow! The first sip was almost sheer horror! Your palate needs to be ready for this monster! But after our initial shock, the beer seemed to get better with each sip.  The palate is dominated by burnt espresso and coffee flavors with some caramel hints. The beer is weighty and rich without seeming too heavy. I would pair this with dessert, especially chocolate, or rich food such as game or stew. It is especially nice on its own.

There is also an underlying fruitiness, dark fruits, blackberries, blackcurrents, and grapes. Definitely an awful lot to the aroma, surprisingly complex.

147,1160,wl0307,4.47,"Purchased from a very good Britain-based beer shop, ""Beers of Europe"", through on-line order. Coming in a light brown, 12 Fl. Oz. slim bottle, ""Limited Spring 2008 Release"" and ""Enjoy By 01.01.2013""; served cool in Hapkin's branded flower bulb-shaped sniffer.  A: jet black in colour, the carbonation is low and the dark khaki frothy head lasts pretty well. S: so deep and complex and oily, the aroma is initially thickly treacle-ish and roasty, but the flowery hop aroma never falls far behind as much as the sour hints of coffee syrup, vanilla chocolates, licorice, chillies and super sweet & fat black dates. A swirl brings up the bouquet of American hops as well as some settled alc., sweet walnuts and sweet tobacco. Overall the aroma is quite heavy as the back label warns, but it's still enticing and manageable probably thanks to a good balance. T: upfront comes a lubricating swallow of sweet black malts, treacle, sweet roast walnuts and black prunes, leading towards a lively aromatic flavour as of Chinese roasted walnut-date cake topped (bizarrely) with a little chocolate shaving; the creamy yet increasingly dry and bitter aftertaste of aromatic flowery hops replaces the fruitiness, roastiness, and creamy malts, rendering a truly chewy and surprisingly spicy mouthfeel to last until the very end along with a faint suggestion of banana-oil esters. A faint burn of alc. concludes each sip, but only just. M&D: creamy soft on the carbonation, fulsome on the flavour while the alc. treads elegantly as a much lighter stout. I disagree with the back label's statement, as I don't feel any guilt/sin while tasting the ale, but I think it's to do with how mellow this bottled ale has turned into in less than a year's time~~ Compared with the other American RIS tasted recently (incl. Great Divide's Yeti, Flying Dog's Imperial Russian Porter, Left Hand's RIS, and Brooklyn's Black Chocolate Stout), I find this one the most balanced amongst them all, as the hops seem to have melted in the magical mixture.

A light bit of fruitiness - black currents - rounds things out. As the beer warms noticeable solvent alcohol aromas show up as well.  The flavor is equally impressive. Loads of coffee waft over the tongue. Plenty of dark chocolate is present as well. Molasses soaked coffee beans and a hint of liquorice seem to round out the middle. As the beer warms up, the alcohol starts to show up. The finish packs plenty more roast, as well as a bit of a lingering herbal hop note.  The mouthfeel is full bodied and thick. The beer coats the tongue in velvety bliss. The carbonation is light but more than adequate for the job.  Man oh man is this one epic brew. Its a sipper to be sure. Loads of complexity await each delicious sip. Its very easy drinking upfront. The alcohol seems almost non existent. AS the beer warms up, the alcohol becomes much more prevalent.

Alcohol is evident throughout but is not hot. Nice balance between malt and hop. Hop bitterness in the finish but does not linger. Subdued roast bitterness in the finish also. Mouthfeel-Full body.

Complex hops and dark roast lend to a medium mouthfeel with a smooth roasty taste and long hop finish. I was a little surprised how the hops played a role in this. Will be interesting to try different years down the road. Nice brew.,Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,96
147,1160,Hojaminbag,4.08,"A super dark color that I won't even call dark brown, it is just black. Three fingers of brown head that has good retention and leaves lots of great, sticky lace patterns on my glass.  The aroma is one that I would call intensely fruity for a stout, with notes of dark currents and dates. A big roasted aroma is there also, with coffee mixed. Alcohol is definitely noticeable.  Stone Russian Imperial Stout's intense flavors match the aroma pretty well. It is still a fruity stout with currents and dates, but the roasted flavors are equally (if not more) powerful in the flavor. I notice a note of vanilla in there also. First comes fruits, then a touch of vanilla and the roasted flavors. In the finish coffee comes through and is paired with some hop bitterness. A touch of alcohol is in there too. The aftertaste features mostly choclate and roasted malt.  The mouthfeel is creamy, thick, full, great for the style. It seems to coat the roof of your mouth, but still maintains a moderate amount of carbontion.  Overall a very good stout, one that I have tried numerous times and only reviewed now. Great for the price too.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,96
147,1160,bobjonesSD,3.98,Ah the Stone IRS. Despite living in San Diego I had yet to try this one - I stopped by a small liquor store in Del Mar and noticed they had a pretty reasonable selection of craft brews including several bottles of this. Having looked for it before at Bevmo and been rebuffed I decided to give it a try.  I was in general quite pleased with this beer - poured form the bottle into a delirium noel snifter. I particularly liked the nice thick mouthfeel and creaminess. Altogether a very nice beer.,Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,96

Smell is as expected with a nice roasted smell with hints of coffee and chocolate.  Taste for 2008. Much more mellowed out than the 2009. Very smooth with no alcohol burn. It has definitely lost some taste with the age on it, but has gained a smoothness that makes it much easier to drink.  Taste for 2009. This is awesome! Everything(roasted malts, hops, chocolate and coffee tastes) is very present. This has a lot going on fresh, what a RIS should taste like IMO.  Mouthfeel is typical for a bigger stout I would say, meaning there is a sticky, lingering body to it rather than a crisp, watery feeling.

A mahogany colored head that was medium coarsity. Left nice lacing as it dissipated.  S: Chocolate, raisins and other dark fruit. This is what I expect a proper RIS to smell like.  T: Deep roasted hints of milk chocolate is what my palate first notices that cover what appears to be a dark fruit undertone. There is a nice warming sensation throughout with the ABV peeking its head towards the finish. This seemed to be served a little too cold initially but as the brew warmed up, another sip revealed a nice maltiness and also a dark chocolate contribution.  M: Deep bodied just the way I like it. It coats the mouth in a silkiness that lingers but also seemed to have what can only be described as a type of mustiness about it.

147,1160,Brenden,4.03,"This brew is black, inky and thick. There's no way to see through this one. A tannish head takes much longer to dissipate from the tap than it did from the bottle and it sits at a couple fingers, leaving some patchy lacing down the glass nonetheless. Big aromas come out of this one: heavily roasted coffee beans, bittersweet dark chocolate, the charcoal-like note that's common in a lot of imp stouts, molasses and black licorice, dried fruits (currant or plum), some smoky wood, lots of toasted and roasted grains, and a slightly acidic bitter undertone that actually maintains decent balance by way of an underlying malt sweetness. The aroma simply isn't as strong as it is from the bottle, though. The taste, as with all Stone brews with which I'm familiar, is nothing one wouldn't expect to discover from the aroma. Everything's very much up front and the balance is impressive. As with the aroma, the flavor is the same flavor as I get from the bottle, but a bit muted on tap; when that happens, it takes something away from the experience of such a huge brew. The mouthfeel is smooth and thick, making for a creamy, rich brew. The body is very full, not quite motor oil consistency (this batch, anyway), but close to it. Carbonation is quite moderate, though crispness is muted by the full thickness of this beast. It is present, though. As I expect from Stone, this is a huge brew with massive flavor exactly to style.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,96
147,1160,Boofshavik,3.97,"2009 poured from a bomber into 2 pints (sharing with the beer-advocate-in-training wife)  Pours an inky black with a thin coffee colored head that fades fairly quickly into bubbles around the rim. High alcohol is evident in the legs when swirled. Viscosity is certainly high, but a little lower than I expected in appearance.  Aroma is perhaps the best part of this brew. A very pleasant and not overpowering chocolate and toasty nose without the burnt character often in the style. Some currant character (as mentioned on the bottle). Higher alcohols present.  The warmth from the alchol is present in the first sip. I expect it would benefit greatly from a year in the cellar. On the exhale, the alcohol almost overpowers the nicely balanced roasty malt character. The sweetness right in the front of the mouth keeps me reaching for the glass!  It lays heavy on the palate, but isn't as slick and almost slimy as other high ABV beers can be (which I appreciate). Carbonation is just right, barely cutting through the viscosity.  Using @Mebuzzard's criteria of ""only half a beer left?!"" versus ""I still have half a beer?!"" for drinkability, the Stone RIS does very well. The front sweetness balances so well with the chocolate malt and carbonation as to keep me quaffing. If the alcohol character was either mellowed slightly or masked a bit it would be even better, as I imagine it will be next year.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,96
147,1160,ocelot2500,4.88,"Pours a deep black color with a tight mocha head. Sheets of lacing left on the glass.  The smell is of roasted malts with a big coffee and chocolate note. Think flavored coffee with some alcohol mixed in. Not much in the way of hops.  The taste is big roasted malts with the coffee chocolaty flavors coming through. This is a malt bomb with a molasses flavor coming through as well. There is also a slight estery note that comes through, but it is subdued. The bitterness from the coffee roastiness combines with the chocolate to make this fairly balanced. This should be a sipper, but I just keep wanting more since it is so delicious.  The mouthfeel is an exceptionally thick, syrupy. Coats the tongue well.  This is a very drinkable brew and I wish I had bought another bottle.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,96

S: Strong smell of dates, roasted malts, and a somewhat unpleasant animal stall flavor. Where did that come from?  T: Huge roasted/ burnt malt character is balanced with aromatic coffee, very dark chocolate, dates, and licorice. The anise-flavored spiciness, peppered with some dark berries (I detect blackcurrant), cloves, and chili peppers, really gives this a nice sweet zing.  M: Smooth and thick; coats the tongue with a soothing, sticky layer.  D: Wonderfully sippable; the smell could use some work though.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,96
147,1160,Kegatron,4.5,"On tap @ the Copper Mine Pub (North Arlington, NJ) on 7/24/09. 8 oz pour served in a Chimay glass.  Pours black as night in the glass, with a 1/4 finger of creamy burnt mocha colored head. Just awesome retention here, staying rich & frothy the whole way through the glass, leaving a big cascade of creamy spotty lace and brown goo back. The aroma is just awesome smelling, being quite heavy in the nose, with a perfect evenness between the darkker notes of roast & coffee and then the sweeter tones of chocolate, toffee, and dark fruits. As mentioned before, the alcohol presence gives this some heavy presence in the nostrils but is never stinging, instead imparting a cozy smelling warmth that makes this a pleasure to sniff.  The taste starts with a big crunchy flush of blackened and burnt roast and zippy espresso character. This is then balanced (if you can call it that) by an equally massive sweeter base of dark chocolate, toffee, black currants, and liquorice. Man, the finish on this is absolutely bitter and roasty that just STICKS in the mouth. Very satisfying. The mouthfeel is full bodied with a big mouthfilling prickly carbonation that really brings out the sharp roasty character in this. This then slickens out towards the back, with a chewy feel that carries the bulk of the huge sweetness in this with it. That hefty ABV is present, but just like the best RIS do, it never detracts from the flavors but instead gives them extra gravitas in the profile, helping make everything pop.  A classic from Stone no doubt. Full flavored, full bodied, full everything, RIS that leaves nothing on the table. I love the fact that you don't have to give up an arm or a leg to procur if either.

The balance of this beer is quite impressive, the mouthfeel is definitely the key player here, incredible smoothness brings flashing notes of chocolate and licorice. Slight bitterness really integrates with the carbonation to prevent any kind of cloying sweetness, which definitely ups the drinkability.

147,1160,abar22,4.2,"22 oz bomber poured into a tulip.  The Stone IRS came out black and thick with a 1 inch mocha head. It settled quickly into a thin cap with a nice thick ring around the glass. Lacing was there but minimal. The nose is a bit more subdued than I'd like. With a full head you get a whiff of chocolate. When the head subsides the roasted coffee, a RIS staple, comes through. Neither are particularly strong though both are pleasant. Nice but not as complex or fragrant as I'd like. A touch of carbonation hits first opening up to a nice smooth feeling body. The middle boasts of sweet chocolate and a hint of something dark and tart(raisins?). The ending brings the roasted malts and coffee that finishes nice and dry. The mouthfeel is consistent with great Imperial Stouts; smooth, creamy, with mild carbonation. The after taste leaves hints of roasted malts and alcohol. 12 oz goes down like a dream and going for two would be filling but not difficult.

T - brings a tear to my eye, dammit this is good! some roasted walnut-like flavors drenched in a medium roast coffee and sweet chocolate maltiness.  M - burps some dark chocolate bitterness and a hint of hops. realllly rich heavy body, wonderful.  D - I feel like I could drink one every day for the rest of my life, but I wouldn't want to do that simply because it is so good and doing so would ruin the effec. This is a beer I would seek to share at prominent celebrations or large family holiday gatherings - though I would probably be given strange looks simply because not many people could understand it.  I felt privileged to have found it and had been looking everywhere for it, I bought all 4 they had on the shelves and I do not regret it at all.. I wish I had a place to cellar my last one, but I will be saving it as long as I can stand to see it sit in my fridge. I will probably go back to the store and see if they can order a case of these so I can serve at my wedding next year.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,96
147,1160,theghost3,4.32,"Pours black with a 2-finger cafe au lait head. Medium lacing.  The smell is strong of molasses, roasted malts, dark fruit (mainly cherries), spices and coffee with alcohol esters. Taste is rather bitter from the strong dark coffee but there's a sweetness that comes through that consists of caramel malts and molasses. Mouthfeel is creamy, thick, almost oily.  This is a drinkable beer, but that ABV will surprise you. Excellent example of an RIS.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,96
147,1160,TheTrevor,4.18,"This beer poured a deep dark black with a two-finger dark tan head. The smell is a mix of strong black coffee, very dark fruits, and some melted dark chocolate. The taste starts off with a huge hit of sweet malt that gives way to some slightly bitter coffee and dark chocolate that gives way to a bit of real dark fruit and alcohol in the background. The mouthfeel is so thick and creamy it's unreal with some real pleasant warming from the alcohol. The drinkability doesn't suffer even though this is a big serious brew that means business. A fantastic version of the style.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,96
147,1160,nicholasdes,4.53,"I did not think I would finish the whole bomber myself, but I quickly found myself reaching for the bottle to replenish my glass. Pours smooth and dark with a dark gray brown head that foretells of the rich goodness below it. The nose hints at sweet chocolate roasted malt. So smooth and creamy on the palate, balanced and flavorful. The roasted malt up front mixed with caramelized fruit and a threat of sweetness the never materializes. The finish is dry with lite hop bitterness. A beer so good you can't help but stare at the glass as you drink it, amazed by the goodness it contains. It is the balance that makes this great, a perfect combination of complex flavors that are never overbearing.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,96
147,1160,jdklks,4.87,"A- impenetrable black with an amber hue at the edges when backlit; thick with a milk-chocolate colored head. gorgeous.  S- mmm. so good. makes my mouth water. coffee, cocoa, roasted/burnt malts, alcohol.  T- great. wow. bitter coffee flavor up front accompanied by dark chocolate and roasted malts. super, super roasty. bitter, dark chocolate throughout, but especially in the finish. intense dark fruit sweetness all around. a hint of hops when fresh, but they fade nicely at about the 6 month mark, and are devoured by the overall roastiness.  M- nice and thick, oily on the palate. well carbonated. great mouthfeel.  the 2009 is no let-down. it might have just convinced me to pop my 2008 that's in the cellar soon.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,96
147,1160,naiserie,4.17,"starting off with my first review, mostly to keep track of what i've had...please excuse anything amateurish.  poured from a 22oz bomber (bauer's in boston) into an over sized snifter.  two fingered head from a vigorous pour, reduces to a silky layer on top. good lacing as it drinks.  smells sweet, dark chocolate, caramel. tastes sweeter than it quaffs, slight bitter after, but not overly so.  nice thick mouth feel, but almost a bit thin from what the smell and taste promise.  at 10.5% abv, this is a brew that needs good time or company to finish.  surprisingly enough (i know i've seen it before, just never picked it up...good beer for the inaugural review), this is the first time i've actually had this beer. will probably pick up a couple to cellar.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,96
147,1160,magine,4.35,"Poured into pint glass.  Pours a pitch black brew with some ruby shining through. Has a nice thick chunky tan head that settles to nothing but a rim around the glass while drinking. Minimal lacing.  Smells of sweet coffee, caramel roasted malts, alcohol. Chocolate and molasses.  The brew tastes big - very thick creamy, very big flavors and bold too. Roasted coffee, chocolate taste, alcohol is in the taste as well (almost 11%) which is no biggie - it somehow works for this brew.  This brew is an absolute sipper - a high alcohol brew that is very big as ballsy. Not for the faint of heart - this brew would be best enjoyed to kick start your night of drinking. I wouldnt drink to many of these in one night. It would be a nice brew on a cold night; would be a great ""winter warmer"" for sure. Very impressive for what this beer is.  I would love to leave these in my basement for a long while to see how it changes these - very tasty. This will be a brew I will have ready for winter every year - a damn fine stout.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,96
147,1160,mullenite,4.27,"Poured a pitch black with a half finger of creamy tan head.  Smell is rich dark chocolate, roasted malts (coffee) and just a bit of hops to it.  Taste is very similar to the smell with the dark chocolate being the most prominent flavor.  Heavy mouth feel, a bit more carbonation than I would normally like but still damn good.  Easy enough to drink even if it is a bit warm out for such a beer.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,96
147,1160,azorie,3.98,"Notes: every drink one of these A+ ris and just go I don't get it, well this 1 fits that category to me.  A: Pouring into the Mug, had a nice 2.5 inch head, on top of the dark black color, its very creamy lace left over.  S: Very nice tones of dark chocolate, toffee, Burnt cream, very complex with a hint of hops. Some alcohol can be detected.  T: Warm and coffee, chocolate, toffee all rolled into one, with a sweet malt background. You know your drinking a RIS here, very strong alcohol presence, but in a good way. Very nice tasting RIS here.  M: thick, rich, heavy body.  D: well one 750ml at a pop is all I want, and I love heavy beers.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,96
147,1160,tigg924,4.5,"Appearance: 1/2 inch head and black  Smell: chocolate, cream, and sweet malt  Taste: milk chocolate, cream, sugar, a touch of hops at the end, tad bit of nut, and toasted malt--This is such a wow beer  Mouthfeel: smooth, creamy, sweet, and medium body, with a small bitter taste towards the end.  Drinkability: This is a wow beer and easily the best I have had from Stone. This does not have the hoppy taste I am used to from them. It is incredibly balanced. Well worth the hype, this is up there with Pozharnik as my favorite in the style. High ABV makes this a one time for me, but wanting more the second I finish.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,96
147,1160,patmcd,4.6,"22oz Bottle, 2009 Vintage.  Finally got around to picking up a 2009 Vintange and drinking it way out of season, although I do have several cellared for prime drinking this winter :)  What else can I say that hasn't been said about Stone's RIS? The De Facto Standard in American RIS's IMO. Also the most drinkable IRS I've had to date. So complex, so smooth, the flavors just blend right end to each other, which consist of burnt chocolate, molasses, a hint of coffee and even some carmelly-molasses. The malt and hops are in the perfect ratio as well. Pours pitch black with a dark, burnt-sienna brown head--it even looks formidable and foreboding (Does a Swamp Creature Lurk beneath the surface!?!)  For having a high ABV, it's incredibly drinkable. Perfect for a cold winter night.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,96
147,1160,beerwolf77,4.11,Well I've been waiting tfor this for some time now so here it goes. First off it's black hole dark. Holy crap it's black. The aroma is malty with hints of chocolate and coffee maybe molasses. It didn't smell as good as I thought it would though. The flavor is very rich and decadent. Like a piece of chocolate coffee cake. I was a bit suprised at how present the alcohol was in the flavor but at 10.8 abv what are yopu gonna do? The mouthfeel is about what it should be. Mild carb fills my mouth and hangs around for a bit. This is a sipper for sure. I felt no pain after downing a 16oz glass of this bad boy. I left the tasting wanting more though. I will have to try this beer again soon.,Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,96
147,1160,aristeros,4.63,"Poured from a 22 oz bomber of 2009 into a pint glass. Pours black into the glass with a finger plus of tan head with decent lacing and good retention on the glass. Active carbonation visible. I smell dark chocolate, licorice, and big roasted malt flavors like espresso and toffee.  I taste molasses and sweetened espresso up front, very ""imperial stout,"" but a few milk stout notes: moderate sweetness and creamy texture up front. It goes from that very smooth mouthfeel to something leaning towards syrupy, full-bodied. Moderate carbonation on the front end in particular. Some fig, licorice, and alcohol on the back end.  Big fan of Imperial Stouts, big fan of Stone, so I had high expectations here. Drinkability is good for the style, despite a pretty high ABV. Overall, powerful, deep, and satisfying, and I liked it more than both Old Rasputin and Sam Smith's Imperial Stout, both great beers.  Hard to pair with a food that this wouldn't overpower--maybe a rich, chocolate dessert, or well-seasoned beef. Best to get a bomber or two and share with your fellow stout drinkers.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,96
147,1160,thekevlarkid,4.17,"Out of a bomber this beer was an opaque, crude-oil black color. The brown, one-finger head displayed decent retention and good lacing. The aroma was rich and sweet, molasses, coffee, chocolate male and caramel malt. The flavors were of chocolate, coffee, roasted malt, sweet pipe tobacco and a hoppy bitterness that balanced the malt elements nicely. The mouthfeel was smooth, the body full and the carbonation right on-target. Not the most complex example of the style but certainly an accurate one.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,96
147,1160,kels,4.2,"Bamadog brought this one along for my move to Blacksburg, VA. Thanks for a good beer to start things off.  Appearance: Pours a beautiful super-rich chocolate brown, more or less black, and completely opaque. The creamy caramel-colored head pours at 2 fingers and retains at a healthy skim that pushes soft lace up the walls of the snifter.  Smell: Wow- the smell is absolutely delicious. I would most definitely like to eat this. Smells like rich dark and bittersweet chocolatesd, dark, toasted malts that are almost charred and smoky.  Taste/Mouthfeel: Feel starts slightly thin when first sipped, then fills out to a moderate creaminess from the carbonation. I can feel the sediment coating the roof of my mouth. Taste is super roasted malts, almost smoky, and dry, bitter chocolate. Alcohol is prominent, warm and sharper in the vapors of the aftertaste.  Drinkability: Moderate at best. It is really well-balanced, but the strength of the alcohol is definitely too prominent.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,96
147,1160,BeanBone,4.18,"2009 Vintage:  Appearance: An opaque black body capped by a generous three fingers of caramel-colored head that sticks around for a long time and leaves good lacing. Top marks.  Aroma: An intense blast of dark roasted malt with plenty of dark chocolate, dark fruit, and dark coffee notes (notice a trend developing here?). But as big as the malt body is, this is not just a one-sided affair as there are decent pockets of hops and alcohol to be found amongst the malt.  Taste: Just as strong as the nose promised, the complex malt base absolutely dominates and features notes of bittersweet chocolate, dark fruit, molasses, and dark roasted coffee. The hop character from the nose shows back up towards the end to offer a little added depth. While the alcohol content certainly lets its presence be known, its deceptively smooth, feeling closer to about eight percent. The aftertaste is roasty and chocolaty with wisps of alcohol interspersed throughout.  Mouthfeel: A thick, creamy full body with only mild carbonation cutting through and a dry finish. After your sip, there's enough of a coating left in the mouth to keep everything alive for a long time. The alcohol leaves some warmth and slickness, but not as much as you'd expect with it weighing in at a hefty 10.5%.  Drinkability: Quite the sipper, which is no surprise given the style, alcohol content, and IBU rating. A brilliant beer to savor after a meal.  Verdict: Certainly worth all of the the hype, Stone's Imperial Russian Stout is a damn fine beer well worth seeking out for any Stout fan. As good as this tastes now, I can't wait to see how this ages.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,96
147,1160,bamadog,4.3,"Split a bomber of this with Kels, poured from the bottle into a tulip.  Appearance: Pour is black with a nice 2 finger head that is dark tan and creamy looking and lasts for quite a while as it sits on top, daring me to try to get to the viscous pour below it; body is entire opaque, nothing could penetrate this bad boy.  Smell: Quite strong, I really can't get how overpowering the nose is on this monster; I pick up a lot of deep dark roastiness and burnt coffee-like malts; some woody smokiness; hints of bitter chocolate;  Taste: Wow. Just like the nose, incredibly strong and overpowering, just what I would want from something with a Stone label attached to it. The first flavor that really gets to me is that deep/burnt roastiness and slight smokiness (if that's a word...); the bitter-sweet chocolate is really subdued initially, but makes more of an appearance in the aftertaste, along with a pretty apparent bite of alcoholic warmth.  Mouthfeel: Thick, chewy, gritty with sediment; a nice thick coating is left all over the palate and the entire torso is left warm. Wow. This beer hits the whole person, not just the nose and mouth.  Drinkability: It's a sipper, no doubt, and I'm especially glad this one is being split as I would be passed out on the floor if I tried to drink an entire 22 oz. bottle on my own, so yeah... The flavors are mind-blowingly present and exactly what the bottle tells you you're going to get, but it's a little bit and heavy for much more than one glass.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,96
147,1160,DookDrinkyCrow,5,"I have heard alot about Stone Brewing Co. I searched for this beer and finally found it for 5.99 for a 22 ounce bomber. The 2008 edition.  It has a very dark, smooth appearance. The aroma is great, with coffee and chocolate. The most amazing is the roasted malt, the smell is almost as good as the taste.  This beer is great. Very sophisticated and hearty. A high alcohol content helps boost this beer above the rest.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,96
147,1160,GarrisWH,4.5,"22oz bomber from the Spring 2009 release.  A - Pours a completely opaque black with a creamy looking, brown head. Retains a nice thin cap of a head throughout drinking, and leaves subtle lacing.  S - Very rich smell dominated by sweet, roasted malts. There are tones of coffee, chocolate, and dark fruit in the aroma. Slight hoppiness coming through in the background with just a hint of alcohol as well.  T - Roast coffee is the first flavor i noticed, followed by rich chocolate and dark, dried fruit flavors(perhaps raisins or maybe even prune). Very sweet, but balanced with a nice bitter hoppiness that comes through in the finish, along with a warming alcohol presence. Slight smoky character to the flavor as well. Complex and delicious.  M - Rich, full-bodied, creamy and smooth.  D - Very drinkable, especially considering the 10.5% abv. Absolutely delicious with a complex flavor profile and a great balance that manages to be a monster on the malt side of things without being overly sweet. While it probably wouldn't be a great idea to put down more than one bomber of this, I thought it was stellar in all aspects.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,96
147,1160,bgjohnston,4.5,"I have been pleased with the offerings from Stone that I have been able to try, but even with high expectations, this was a pleasure to drink.  First off, I have not really been able to give high marks for smell for most beers. Allergies and perhaps a less perceptive nose to blame, I suppose. However, this beer comes on strong, giving very clear scents of dark roast coffee, dark chocolate, and a sweet maltiness that makes me think ""yeah! this is the real deal!"". If you are normally very perceptive in this category, this beer might kill you.  The appearance is as a RIS should be: opaque, black with dark brown color at the very edges of the glass, and a dark brown head. The best part is in the tasting, however, and does not disappoint. Strong sweetness, dark coffee and chocolate richness, and a little bite of hops in the finish, barely drying it out. A truly massive tasting beer.  Mouthfeel is usually a category where beers lose out with me, but this one has a nice creamy, smooth, yet very big feel to it. I can see why some folks pursue the best of the best of this style with such passion. I would definitely drink this again.  Drinkability is high for such a strong beer. 1 is definitely enough for the night (I could only buy this in 22oz bottles), but I want to drink more of this, even knowing it is overwheming my taste buds already.  Great beer. I will definitely welcome having this in my house again.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,96

147,1160,babaracas,4.4,"Limited Spring 2009 release. Pours pitch black even when held to the light, tan head. Smell: soft and sweet, something like a liquor soaked chocolate cake, black plum, roasty, caramel, a bit of coffee, effervescent alcohol. Not as pungent as some ris, but very nice. Taste: this one is pretty hot at 10.5. The booze and a bunch of sweet, syrupy malts are cut with a pretty serious hop note... roasty, unsweet chocolate, anise, dark chocolate. Rich viscous mouthfeel. Will need to grab a couple to sit until the cold(er) months.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,96
147,1160,brundo4,4.4,"Poured from a 22 oz. Brown bomber into snifter-style burgundy glass. Small head forms just after one is finished pouring. Espresso in color. Dissipates almost instantly. Ring of lacing around glass. Very sticky. Brew is jet black. This some serious stout. I've had the pleasure of its company once before and am glad to have it with me once again.  Sweet scent on the nose. Carmel, molasses, chocolate and coffee come through strongly. Also a very apparent malty smokiness, as well as a subtle yeast scent. A bit of cola floating in there as well as nuts, oak, and some soil and general earthiness. The inviting quality of this stout's smell is really absurd.  Upon first taste, coffee rushes immediately to the front. Then chocolate followed by a nutty bitterness. A very smoky, earthy flavor. This is one delicious beer. Good God. Great balance of flavors. A definite chocolate/coffee dominance but as the beer warms on the palate a subtle blending and balance is slowly cultivated. This stout is exemplary.  Thick, smooth mouthfeel. Like a great massage on the tongue. Feels like you could chew it and hold on. Deep, rich body. Complex, layered sensations.  This beer is remarkably drinkable. The stout of all stouts, I feel compelled to sing its praises. Not a sessionable choice by any means, this stout is certainly a meal. Sip slowly or with great vigor, this beer will flood your senses any way you attempt to engage with it.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,96

A-Pours pitch black with a beautiful thick coffee colored creamy head that has pretty good retention and nice uniformed rings of lacing.  S-I smell loadfulls of roasted barley and strong toffee notes too. Then it turns into a beautiful bouket of chocolate and coffee wofting into my nose. Very nice balance in the aroma. Mmmm, after it warms a little, some licorice notes come into play.  T-The flavor is pretty staight foward with bitter sweet chocolate and roasty malty goodness. Not complex but very good.  M-Man, I don't think the mouthfeel could be any better. It's soooo creamy and full bodied. In no way is this beer harsh because of the abv, it's a little hot but it's not ""hot"" perse.

147,1160,Liquids,2.86,"On vacation in NYC, treated myself to a bottle of this over everything else available at Whole Foods in NYC, especially as no Stone over the border in CT, and it should be amazing. I let it warm to room temperature to get the full experience in the evening when I'm back in the room.  Great looking bottle, pours a thick and syrupy (for a liquid) pitch black. Head is creamy and darker brown hue. Aroma is sweetish molasses, charred malts, and alcohol.  Taste - a disappointment. Sure I like big beers too, but this is just straight up boozy. Everything else is an afterthought to my tongue. Plenty of malt flavor behind the booze, and some hops which are more so dominated by the alcohol. Trying it later after chilling it, the booze is present but less so, with more hop flavor, but still boozy. It's hard to imagine anyone likes this so much except that they like the *idea* of drinking bigger darker thicker beer and enjoy the sensation of alcohol burning the tongue and nose.  Mouthfeel is good and thick. Drinkable? This has to be the least drinkable beer I've tried for those that I could get down...no one I know who likes drinking good beers would think this was worth any amount of money but to get drunker faster. I drink for the flavor, so this is a disaster. I finished it as cold as I could get it over a few days, a small glass a day--all I could stand. Surprisingly, Victory Imperial Stout is hands down better in my book...this wouldn't make it into my glass again unless it were free.

No light can get through this. Smell: The smell is very light. Distinct, but not overpowering. Taste: Unbelievable! The thickness in the pour really comes through in the taste. Ok. Maybe that goes into the mouthfeel category. So, I will combined them. The rich malt blend flows smoothly over the tounge. It only has a very slight bite at the finish.

147,1160,GJ40,4.6,"Sampled from a 12oz bottle in my DFH snifter. Purchased from Sam's in Durham, NC. The bottle says it's a ""Limited Spring 2008 Release"" so it's had some time to mature.  A - A deep, dark black with no light coming through. A small tan head that dissipates quickly. This one has a real ominous look about it.  S - Lots of chocolate with some roasted malt, coffee and a touch of alcohol. Very nice.  T - A nice roasted, dry flavor with lots of character and a mild lingering bitterness. Despite the enormity of this beer, it's about as balanced as they get. There's nothing harsh about it. And the 10.8% alcohol is well hidden.  M - It starts thick and chewy but it ends with a very light and airy feel; as if it's evaporating in your mouth. The carbonation is low and very fine.  D - This is a great beer to savor.

About an inch of brown head that disappears slowly and leaves a lot of lacing on the glass. Looks good.  S: Smells like malts, chocolate and coffee. There's a whole lot going on here. Kinda hard to point them all out.  T: Heavy. Tastes like chocolate, coffee, caramel, etc. Tons of flavors going on. Tastes really good. Slight alcohol bite in the finish.  M: Thick and heavy. Lightly carbonated. Leaves a dry alcohol taste on the tongue.  D: Surprisingly drinkable considering the 10.8% abv. Would never be able to make it through two bottles though.  Lives up the hype. Not an everyday beer whatsoever but absolutely worth a try.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,96

147,1160,allengarvin,4.4,"This extremely dark beer features a small but persistent head and some modest lacing. The aroma consists of lightly roasted, dark chocolate notes, with hints of cocoa powder. Excellent flavor, deliciously malty but never sweet, and highly bitter without bitterness being the dominant flavor. The taste mostly mirrors the aroma, but is richer and very smooth. The body is surprisingly light for the strength--a plus, since the heaviness of many RIS's is why I'm not a big fan of the style. Very well crafted, like nearly everything Stone has done.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,96
147,1160,WalrusJockey,4.55,"Spring 09 into snifters.  A- one of those rare, really-truly black beers. Head is thin and the color of the the crema (foam) on top of really good coffee.  S- chocolate and roast, with caramel and a hint of alcohol in the background. Mouthwatering, honestly.  T- light opening flavor fades into a dusty sweetness of roasty malt. Swallow is dry dark chocolate, followed by a very bitter bite which is directly alongside the alcohol bite, all of which fades together into a dry, dark chocolate aftertaste.  M- satisfying and creamy, but not thick, cloying or syrupy.  D- over-all, low. For the style, fairly high, I suppose, as this is a low-drinkability style.  Notes- RIS isn't my favorite style, I don't like alco-pops, or unballanced malt- or hop- bombs. But for what it is, this is very well done and very enjoyable. Would definitely buy again, though I wouldn't mind the price being cheaper.  EDIT: A+ seems a bit high, to me, but a very firm A is right on the money. I don't feel like monkeying with the scores to bring the over-all down, though.  Better a bit cooler, IMO. As it warms up the alcohol flavor becomes more of a factor and less of a background note.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,96
147,1160,EnojysAnyBeer,4.78,"Spring '09 bomber  A- Wow, this is the most impressive looking beer I have ever seen. The head is so big that it has a cascading effect if you pour it right. The beer is super dark brown and looks black in the glass. The bubbly foam on top also sports a latte-brown hue and sticks around long enough to enjoy while I sip away on an 11oz portion from my dimpled mug. Leaves great lacing on my mug, which is rare.  S- Big loads of roasted malts and alcohol with background scents of bread, yeast and honey. Cleaning solution comes to mind but more like chocolate-flavored cleaning solution.  T- Flavors of roasted malts all over the spectrum from bitter black coffee to chocolate to pretzel to dark fruits and caramel. Hops don't contribute much more than bitterness but do offer a few flavors of herbs and pine.  M- Thick. This beer is viscous and chewy.

Aroma is dark chocolate, coffee, and licorice  Taste is just about perfect for an RIS. Licorice and chocolate come through right away with coffee on the back end.

The nose is RIS all the way. Roasted malt and toasted burnt grains. Chocolate, espresso, vanilla, hops and carmelized maple syrup.  First thing I notice is this RIS possesses a flavor character that others do not. Fudgy cocoa, vanilla, roasted coffee beans. Dark semi-sweet chocolate is dominant with a marshmallow flavor. Holy shit the graham cracker is there too it's a f**king smores stout! Coffee liquor in the finish with a flash of whiskey.  Moderately chewy, heavy and somewhat creamy.  Had the 2009 version again in 2010, hasn't improved and found it less impressive. Good RIS but not great. Lacking complexity compared to others in it's class.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,96
147,1160,Gish,3.63,"Limited Spring 2009 release. Poured into a snifter.  Pours black with a long-lasting tan head. The smell is of roasted grain, booze, and espresso.  The taste initially is of rich and bitter coffee. However, the hops and alcohol come with a vengeance. I definitely get a bready aftertaste I usually only detect in regular stouts. It's interesting, but far from the most enjoyable RIS I've had.  Stone RIS has a very thick and syrupy mouthfeel. I almost detect the mythical 'chewy' aspect I've heard about. However, it goes down much easier than I figured. The second most drinkable RIS I've had for sure.  Less complex than I expected, and much more drinkable than I thought it would be. A great beer, but I question its really high ratings. I suspect aging would do wonders. If I see it again at the great price I found this one at I might put one down myself.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,96

147,1160,MrHungryMonkey,4.13,"2009. I was stoked to find this.  Nose is creamy with chocolate, soft ripe fruit, and some roast. Nut-like savoriness. Dry powdery chocolate. Smells pretty good.  Pours pitch black, moderate head with fairly quick retention. Looks good.  Major tones of chocolate and coffee atop much milder malt bed. Velvety smooth with luscious richness. Well done Stone. Some tart fruitiness, bright like green grapes yet dark and sugary like ripe red grapes. Mild bitterness takes on a roasted character. Finishes slightly dry/charred and slightly nutty/oily. Tastes quite good. Feels quite good. Good drinkability.  Very dark, smooth, creamy, rich, roasted, etc... Everything A RIS should be and then some. There must be a whole field's worth of barley in each bottle. Although it doesn't pour as thick as Siberian Crude, it is nicely thick. If you pass up a chance to try this you're a fool. You wanted my opinion, as you're reading my review. I'm sure the Stone gargoyle would tell you the same thing. Most impressive score with 1,437 reviews; I hope Stone is proud.

The modest head quickly retreats to a thin collar of espresso-brown bubbles, tightly packed and slow to rise through the murky liquid upon a tilt of the tulip. Strong, roasted chocolate aromas emanate from the surface, backed by a floral perfume of earthy hops and loads of dark fruit. Licorice, chocolate liquor, and brown sugar noted as well.  Clearly a standard for the style, this beauty of a Russian Imperial would have made the Czar's blush. Thick, chewy notes of dark chocolate brownie batter blend with roasted malt grains and spiced rum. Finishes with a spicy linger of musty hops, and more dark chocolate booziness. Thick mouthfeel is viscous and chewy, becoming somewhat sticky at times. A year or two in the cellar should definitely improve the body, whose drinkability is lowered due to its behemoth nature. Still, Stone's IRS is a worthy addition to their line-up, and a fantastic beer on the whole.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,96

Mouthfeel was nice and crisp. Almost a little too spritzy. Yet, this had a mellow creaminess that aided drinkablilty. Flavor was of roasted cocoa beans, wood, alcohol, espresso, and finished slightly charred. This was a very good brew. Dang. Perfect blend of flavor and mouth. Drinkable - freaking spot on.

Smooth and super creamy, its amazing the quality of ingredients used while still keeping a 5.99 shelf price. A little more body wouldnt hurt, i guess it just doesnt feel as big as it is...or should be...if that makes any sense. Amazing beer none the less, although this is my first time reviewing this beer ive had the past 3 years fresh and the 2009 vintgage is the best ive had. Great job Stone.

Smells of Drambuie-soaked raisins, dates, and other dark fruits, as well as a load of chocolate and some brown sugar. It would be pleasant if it weren't overpoweringly boozy. The more it warms, the worse it gets. More cocoa and dark fruits in the taste, and again, loads of alcohol. The initial chocolaty sweetness turns to intense bitterness from heavy hopping. Slightly astringent as well. Warming alcohol-laden finish. Thick body with nice carbonation. Too intensely boozy to be very drinkable. This might have the potential to be nice after a couple of years, but a fresh bottle tastes like chocolate macerated in port with a few dabs of soy sauce added for good measure.

This is by far the most looked forward to beer of the year for me, and lemme tell ya, the difference between bottle and cask makes this even rape harder even more. My first cask-conditioned beer, and wow, I was drunk halfway through my glass. This HAS to be stronger than the bottle! HAS TO BE! Slightly absurd! Felt nitro-y as well, VERY creamy and smooth, bitter, and alcoholy at the same time, but it blends oh so perfectly. Hard to scoff down, but it is one beast of a beer.

147,1160,erz316,3.96,"1pt 6 floz bomber into Sam S. pint glass. Limited spring 2009 release.  A - a beautiful pour, big foamy light brown head, pitch black body that is 100% opaque. Head settles down at a quick pace, leaving a copius corona of lace around the inside of the glass. the increase in head is of great appeal, and makes it look more appetizing that the rasputin.  S - smells malty-chocolate with a prick of alcohol. slight sweet molasses like scent. the dark malts are the most abundant, though the whole is not overpowering. I can see where they're going with the anise and black current, but I cannot distinctively point them out.  T - hot damn thats a good beer! the smoothness is ridiculous for a 10.5 abv brew! initial tastes are of alcohol, and the coffee-choco combination that dark beers can get. the coffee-choco combination is first on the palate and then the booze rushes in, like Raskolnikov with his axe unto the unsuspecting pawnbroker. on further analysis the alcohol is something that I think inevitably hold back the beer; the brew is good to drink, then you do not notice the alcohol, but when one keeps the beer in his mouth for a sustained period of examination the alcohol becomes a detriment, albeit a slight one, but the taste is quite powerful once it comes out. the finish is boozy, fluctuating with the coff-olate flavour; the end ihas the booze relegated to my lips, with the bitterness being more pervasive on the actual palate.  MF&D - the feel is a bit thin for how much ass this beer can kick; I would have it thicker. the drinkability is brought down by the alcohol pervasiveness, once I had found it there was no losing it out of. the carbonation is small, fizzy carbonation on the tip of my tongue",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,96

147,1160,lackingfocus,4.57,"Had this as part of a Stone-sponsored tasting recently. We were given the pleasure of the fresh 2009 edition as well as some well-cellared vintage from 2006 and 2007. The overall review is as follows:  A: A gorgeous earthy black, completely opaque without any hint of cloudiness. Pours a very minimal head with light lacing.  S: Amazing! Smoked chocolate with a notable aroma of hops. I could sniff this stuff all day.  T: Just like it smells. The '09 was a hoppier edition, and I have no complaints about that. But all give that wonderful smoky chocolate flavor that defines this stout.  M: Shockingly light and pleasant! For such a rich, flavorful beer, there's none of that ""stickiness"" that can drag the tongue down. The '09 especially is lighter and crisper than the vintages.  D: A very drinkable stout. Let your own preference and tolerance determine what that means to you.  Overall, this is a great beer that cellars well. The smoky flavor in particular is more notable in the older vintages, whereas ""fresher"" editions are hoppier, crisper, and a bit lighter on the tongue.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,96
147,1160,champ103,4.25,"A: Pours an opaque black. No light penetrates at all. A tan head of over two fingers forms with good retention. Not much lace to speak of though. S: Roasted and sweet malt. Smoke, coffee, and a bit of chocolate. Black liquorish. T: A huge roasted malt flavor. Coffee and slightly bitter chocolate. A bit of sweetness. A light hop flavor as the taste lingers. This is very decadent. M/D: A full body that is low on the carbonation end. Thick and syrupy. For the high ABV this drinks really smooth. The alcohol is noticeable, but just enough to warm the belly. A great beer to sip and savor.  I have had this several times now. Each time is a treat. Highly recommended.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,96
147,1160,cnally,4.45,"This one pours an intensely deep black with hints of mahogany around the bottom of the glass. A massive light brown head sits nicely and laces the glass.  A nutty, smoky aroma full of burnt walnuts and a heavy dose of burnt malt just saturate your senses.  Holy sweetness batman! This is a surprising sweet stout, with the sugary flavor starting right up. There are very smoky notes shortly behind the sweetness, and a deep malty flavor that just takes over the aftertaste. There are woodsy flavors like oak and nutmeg.  Slightly less imposing of a mouthfeel than I expect from a heavy stout. Instead of being thick and heavy, it is rather light and crisp.  Delicious beer that begs to be drank all the time. I have got to say, I have been craving an RIS for a while and this one has done the trick.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,96
147,1160,Lerxst,4.28,"A-Black as night. Beautiful. Thin copper head that dissipated quickly. Gorgeous lacing than hangs around to watch you drink.  S-Strong, but not as intense as I thought it would be. Chocolate, a bit of coffee, currants, dates, licorice. Nice nose.  T-An all out assault on the palate. Everything in the nose bombards the tongue with a delicious maltiness to boot. The alcohol isn't even noticeable.  M-Smooth, creamy and silky while punching you in your face at the same time. Incredible.  D-For such a big beer, this is highly drinkable.

147,1160,BeerZack,4.12,"Pretty black all the way with nice big frothy head that settles to a near complete covering of khaki and cream colored foam.  Smells of vanilla, chocolate, marzipan, licorice whips and, surprisingly, only a hint of alcohol.  As soon as it hits my tongue I get the alcohol impression, the only olfactory impression I get while I have the beer in my mouth is booze. If I exhale as I take a sip I can get rich chocolate, maybe raisin, finishes a little more fruity, dark fruit, dates, raisins, some licorice and burnt caramel. Drying bitter hoppiness asserts at the tail end.  Full, but not syrupy texture; nice carbonation that keeps it creamy and smooth for the most part.  From what I see, this beer is probably too hot for most people to fully enjoy when its fresh, but I think it's just fine now... maybe a couple months age would do it good, but less than a year for sure.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,96
147,1160,lacqueredmouse,4.48,"Pours very thick, a dark, dark opaque brown, with a rising head of incredibly fine brown bubbles, about the colour of chocolate shavings. Lacing is insane: tiny intricate patterns making a miniature Jackson Pollock print on the inside of my glass. Hell yes, what an amazing looking beer.  Wonderful roasted chocolate notes on the nose, big, rich and sweet, but with lightly smoky notes of wood-fired barbeque, burnt toffee, coffee bean and an odd light ozone character. Don't get me wrong, it's a good thing. Very raw and fresh, full of body and attitude, but also just plain tasty.  Smooth and slick mouthfeel is what I notice initially, thick and shiny like melting high-fat icecream. The taste is deliciously bittersweet, full of rich high-cocoa chocolate, mocha coffee and toffee. Only later do the true carbonised characters come through, with a black, high-roast character just lingering on the edges of the palate. Just so damn smooth, rich, sweet and delicious.  Hell yes, what a delicious beer. A rip-roaring RIS that is also a delicious treat. Raw, but refined. Heavy, but smooth. A perfect balancing act, showcasing the art of the Imperial Stout.

147,1160,rayjay,3.88,"2007 vintage poured in my Stone RIS goblet  Pours deep black, simmering like it has an air stone.  Aroma is dominated by fresh leather and rubbing alcohol. Makes a point, is unique, but there are certainly better.  After 2 years the hops are very smooth and mellow, and the malts are the stars. Everything has definitely smoothed out. Very strong leather and rubbing alcohol flavors, though. Some mild toffee.  Mouthfeel is nicely carbed and isn't too sticky. For a beer of this size it's pretty easy to tackle.  Although alcohol catches up with you it's got drinkability since it's a bold brew. East-coast like. Very good, but I have other favorites.

With a tan head that was about 1 in maybe less and left a mat with minimal lacing.  S - Sweet maltiness is present at first then a very prompt and striking smokey and roasted smell. No hops. The nose isn't as present some alcohol as well.  T - As it warms the roasted malt is ever so present. Hints of mild coffee almost with a hazelnut feel to it. A bit of sweetens with a subtle alcohol warmness afterward. As it warms when you roll it on the tongue the alcohol can be very well represented.  M - full bodied, oily and very fulfilling.

It pours like motor oil, thick and black, the nose isn't as apparent as the 2009 version but definite chocolate and coffee tones jump right out. Mouth is GREAT! Due to the age some carbonation was lost but I thought it made for a smoother stout feel and as it warmed more coffee and smooth silky chocolate came out.

147,1160,jettjon,4.5,"From a 22 oz bomber dated Spring 2009, into my cervoise. Dark, ""pitch brown"" color with no penetrating light or really anything around the edges. Towering brown-tan head collapses quickly to a thin sheet and ring of foam with small amounts of clingy lace. Nose of burnt sugar, oaky wood, hints of vanilla, and clearly present boozy alcohol. Creamy, milk-chocolate-sweet toasted malt flavor up front, with fruity undertones and refined-sugar sweetness. Moderate alcohol burn at the back with a dry, coffee-bitter finish. Mouth is smooth and creamy to the extrme. There's a tiny amount of carbonation keeping things sharp but other than that it's smooth and silky, just a bit thinner than skim milk and a bit smoother. Drinkability--ah, there's the rub, I suppose. This one's a consummate sipper, and I suspect reaching the bottom of this well-integrated 10.8% ABV beast is going to be a challenge.

147,1160,Patrick999,3.23,"Nice, the IRS finally showed up down here! I hear this is best aged, but hey, you gotta try it fresh first if possible. 2009 vintage.  A - Poured into a wine glass. Very dark, as you'd expect, and a thin espresso-like crema for a head.  S - Oddly rnough, I find the aromatics a bit muted. It smells like a weaker version of any number of imperial stouts. Mostly roasted coffee - I think I could be fooled into thinking this was a coffee stout if I didn't know better.  T, F - Ahh, I can already tell this needs more time in the bottle. It's harsh...really roasty and harsh. Extremely bitter coffee and bitter alcohol, with some of the currant and anise at the back end. Sticky and viscous, but without being terribly sweet at all. I can't believe I'm saying this, but I could stand for this to come off a bit sweeter. Whether from the roasted malts, hops, alcohol, or a combination of all 3, this is too bitter in its current state. Aside from the hint of currant at the immediate finish, it's just straight bitterness...and unpleasant bitterness if you ask me. With these huge American Impy Stouts, warming up usually takes a lot of the edge off for me, but it doesn't seem to be happening with this.  D - I don't know if I can finish the bomber. I have to get down to the last pour, though, so I can swirl in the dregs from bottle conditioning and see if/how that affects this.  Now, I do see the potential here.

Had to force the pour to get even an half an inch of head to form. Head forms minimal and stays around for abit. Aroma is of a very chocolate and mallasas mix. The Malasses taste is very prominant for me and is ocompanied by the chocolate and coffee flavors. The brew is thick but not overly thick and filling. Carbonation is minimum and average for a good RIS and helps with the drinkability. The brew it's self is very tasty but watch out for the alcohol level when you have finished the 22oz it will hit you. I am very interested in sampaling the older versions of this particular brew.

Smell is rich and thick, dark caramel, coffee, chocolate, bitter herbs, earth. A thin but penetrating warmth of alcohol ushers this wondrous bouquet through my nose and to the pleasure centers of my brain.  Taste is a verification, and amplification, of the smell. A blast of coffee and dark chocolate blast across my tongue, followed by sweet yeast, roasted malt, deep dank herbs, and earth, finally ending in a finish I can only describe as the last stage of a four stage firework, when you think it ends, another round of beauty follows. There is a sweetness here, and a taste of alcohol, but they are both balanced with the overall profile as to be ghosts, there, but not there. I was ready to not like this, I am a big fan of Stone, and wanted to be hyper critical to assure objectivity in this review, but this is fucking delicious, complex, deep and dank, everything you could want in an American Imp stout.  Mouthfeel is great, thick, resinous, full bodied but somehow light as it slowly clears out for the next sip.  Drinkability is very good, this is a good sipper. It's potency might limit, but the flavor invites a long sipping session.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,96

As the ale approaches room temperature, fruity esters add to the complexity giving off notes of black cherry and black currant. Also is more boozy as it warms, although overall the alcohol is well concealed for an RIS (or IRS in this case). Really enjoyed this one.

147,1160,Buschyfor3,4.38,"Served from a 22oz bottle into my Duvel tulip (as I see on Stone's website, it looks as if they serve their IRS in a similarly shaped, flared tulip glass).  A: Pours a deep, oily black and quite a sluggish pour at that. There is a slight cascade effect which builds up under a billowing, thick, creamy, dark khaki head that sticks around throughout the glass. Lacing coats the glass. My brother in law commented that this beer looks ""sinister."" Killer looking stout.  S: I get a huge dark fruit (maybe the black currants) blending with a heavy, boozy note. Alot of big roastiness in the form of hot, black coffee. Bottle also indicates anise, but I'm not picking much of that through the booziness in the nose.  T: Huge and complex! Dark bittersweet chocolate and big, bold, black coffee up front. Then the hints of molasses, sweet dark fruit and the faintest kiss of licorice make an appearance. The booze in the nose makes its presence well known here, following the initial wave of sweetness with a warming blast of peppery flavor that rides well into the finish where it is only surpassed by a fleeting moment of hop bitterness. Finish pulls out a mellower, roasted coffee profile that lingers long after each sip.  M: Thick, oily, chewy. Very low carbonation. This RIS coats the glass and the throat.  D: Huge ABV (10.5%) and it kicks you in the ass from the start of the bottle… it's definitely hot! (To me, this was noticeably more boozy than Bell's Expedition Stout that I tried a few weeks back). You must SIP this beer. It took me over an hour to finish the bottle, and the alcohol only seems to grow as it warms up. Overwhelming booziness impairs the drinkability to some degree, and for that reason alone I docked a few points from the final score. Otherwise, quite an enjoyable sipper, and one that took me most of the evening to finish.  Some age on the bottle would surely smooth out the alcohol presence and allow greater exploration of the complexities in this devilishly delicious stout. I would say that Stone's offering has a more complex, nuanced palate as compared to Bell's Expedition Stout (as a point of reference), but that Expedition just nudges ahead in terms of better drinkability for such a high ABV stout - but not by a wide margin! Nonetheless, a fresh bottle of Stone's IRS is very much worthy of a purchase - it is complex and has all the hallmarks of a supreme stout, not to mention a highly agreeable price point of $5.49/bomber.

147,1160,pmcadamis,3.75,"My wife picked this up for me in Fort Collins while visiting her sister. She knows the stuff I can't get in central IL and gets some for me while she's out that way (she always calls me from the liquor store and says ""have you had this?"" and ""can you get this in Springfield?"" She's great!  A - Thick and black like motor oil, with a trace of the purplish-rainbow sheen that you can see in old nasty oil that leaks onto the ground underneath old beaters. Held to the light, not a trace makes its way through. The head is initially four fingers of deep tan to light brown cream, and retention stays at about two fingers for the duration. Lots of really thick and creamy lace sticks to the glass, forming big sheets of super-dense foam.  S - Double chocolate chip cookies and German chocolate cake. Fudge brownies, melted dark chocolate chips, French vanilla coffee creamer (liquid), and lightly toasted marshmallows. This is smells ridiculously sweet and chocolaty; smells really nice and sweet but smells like it's overly chocolaty and sugary.  T - Much more well-rounded than it smells. The chocolate brownie, fudge, double chocolate chip notes are still there, but a bitter dark baker's chocolate and almost sour lactic note come through. This is much like a cafe mocha in that it's slightly bitter from espresso and dark chocolate, but sweetened by steamed milk, sugar, and cocoa powder. There is also a high level of hops that gives away it's west coast origin, and a lightly smoked flavor adds complexity.  M - Thick, viscous, but oddly simultaneously chalky. Reminds me of a handful of ash soaked in water and placed in the mouth. The sweet super-chocolate notes up front and the bitter hops and roasted flavors on the back end confuse the palate.  D - I'm surprised by this one. I thought it would be an outstanding brew, but while not bad it's no where near as nice as expected based on everyone else's ratings on this site. Chalk it up to personal preference, but I think that this is a confusingly complicated beer that I think might improve DRASTICALLY with age (mine is a Spring 2009 batch, so it's super-young).",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,96
147,1160,mikeal1917,2.74,"I spotted this number at my local Beer store.  Appearance: Amazing dark chocolately brown color with small head  Smell: Quick pungent, with a chocolate definitely pronounced initially  Taste: Unless your a fan of strong brews, think beer is quite bitter, and the chocolate doesn't match it very well in my opinion, and that was gently chilling it as the guy at the store advised.  Mouthfeel: thick brew rolls down your palette, feel a lot like milk, nice and smooth  Drinkability: Both the price and thickness will keep this beer as a once in awhile beer in small amounts  given the average of the beer, I'll probably end up trying it again just to be sure, but as of now not that impressed",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,96

Poured from a bomber purchased at Heinen's in Willoughby Hills, Ohio for $6.99. oured into my silver rimmed Chimay glass (I realized that I really do not have a proper stout glass). No observed ""best by"" date but does it really matter?  A Incredibly sinister looking absolutely black body under an actual dark brown head that was not significant (about 1 cm) and stayed around for about 2 minutes. The look, especially for the style, cannot be improved. 5.0  S Dark Chocolate sweetness, maybe some coffee with cream smell as well. I do not smell much alchohol at all which I did expect. The smell is interesting, inviting and even smooth. 4.5  T I waited with this beer, allowing it to warm to about 50 degrees, before attempting to sip. I took my time and created the above comments about appearance and smell. Anyway, here goes: Wow, a pungeant stout with that dark dark malt and some of the dark chocolate sweetness but a bit too much alcohol kick for my tastes. As I repeatedly sip and think about this beer I wonder if two factors would help my assessment and rating of this beer: 1. if I allowed it to warm even more 2. if I aged it more (my best guess is that this was bottled in 2008). Addendum (still sipping and thinking about this beer): As it warmed (over a period of 30 minutes) I continued to get a pungeant alcohol taste that I really do not care for. I know that imperials have a high ABV profile but others are better at hiding their huge alcohol content. 4.0  M Huge with big ABV, big deep dark tastes. This is a sipper beer for sure. 4.0  D Being an apertif its drinkability cannot be that high but within the style it has a better than average rating due to its huge complexity and potential for improvement in aging.3.5  Notes: the 4th of 5 Stone beers that I am tasting and rating this week. This is a great RIS but I have enjoyed others more (like Big Black Voodoo Daddy).",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,96

Deeper pulls reveal notes of alcohol, dark fruit, and berry esters. Warm and inviting on the nose. T: A wallop of booze. The alcohol has a major, dominating presence at first. Eventually this characteristic mellows out with warmth. Coffee and chocolate are present alongside big roasted flavors. Caramel comes out as well. I can discern the slightest hop presence, but it's very minor behind the sweet malts and alcohol. M: Thick, creamy mouthfeel. Low carbonation. Tons of bitter and boozy residuals left behind.

A - Poures jet black with a two finger dark tan head. Head fades at a fairly quick, but not to fast, pace leaving a small amount of lace that follows to the bottom. Very nice.  S - Roasted malts, chocolate, coffee, and a hint of some dark fruits.  T - Taste pretty much follows the nose for me; however, I know this one is much more complex than my reprehensible taste buds can detect. With that out of the way, this one ends with a dark chocolate tone. The alcohol is very well hidden, considering the abv, until the beer starts to warm a little.

T = Absolutely wonderful taste, that evolved as it warmed. A myriad of complex chocolate, coffee, malt, hop, dark fruit, rum like syrupy sweetness. A warming alcohol slowly evolved down the glass. This is one seriously delicious brew. The 2 year cellar did it real good.  M = Aside from taste, the other truly great aspect of this one. Creamy is the first adjective that came to mind. Just smooth and silky as it went down. Thick, but not as hugely thick as some others. Almost perfect in this regard.  D = Very, very drinkable for all that's going on here.

A - Black thick appearance, great lacing the ale is opaque and has lasting head retention  S - The aroma is rich w/ malt, dark fruit, molasses, candy caramel and vanilla w/ citrus odors from hops  M - The malts have great texture that is rich w/ coffee's roastiness smooth sweetness and viscous without becoming overbearing. The texture is warm from alcohol, but within range  T - The flavor of seriously dark chocolate, roasted grain w/ sweetness of vanilla rum, flavors of currants, plum and dark brown sugar w/ toasted nuts, and cocoa powder. The flavor of hops and alcohol are noted in the tertiary flavors but the taste really lingers w/ malt intensity  D - The west coast has many RIS's that are good, but this is a standout - do not hesitate to try this like I did. I consider it a great example of the style.  Re-review 2008 version courtesy of John Michaelsen at our Stout Tasting part deux. Poured from the cool bomber into a taster and re-sampled again. A-5 S 4.5 M 4.5 T 4.5 D 5  A - deep black, opaque ominous look with thick beige cap and lots of lace clings. The bead is tiny and retention is decent. The smell of strong roast and fruit with cocoa and a mellow spice element. The main fruit would be currant but other dark fruits come to mind w/ slight woody hop note and hints of toast. The feel is lovely, blended with spicy and roasted textures. The slight amount of alcohol in the feel adds complexity and the spice seems slightly strong with a mild bitter element in the finish.  The taste is great with chocolate bitterness and notes of pepper and currant with a light smoke and hint of toffee in the flavor. The mild cocoa and coffee is buoyed by the hop flavor which gives a slight sweet woodiness and then the toffee-molasses comes back with mild dark brown sugar taste in the finish. This is awesome aged - I think the 2008 is the best by Stone I have ever had, just ridiculously good drinkability and I want to go out and get some to age for three years now, what a treat!

T: Bittersweet malts followed by the twang of alcohol on the tongue. Finished with an espresso bitterness that lingers lovingly on the back of the tongue. Coffee and roasty, toasty malts.

No head, only some light brown lace. Sweet chocolate, vanilla, and almond aroma. Flavors of dark chocolate, prunes, roasted coffee. Doppelbockish. Thick and syrupy, but not overly so.

147,1160,ThreeWiseMen,4.77,"'08 vintage bottle shared with Brent (Swimsum). Thanks for the hookup buddy! I've been waiting a looong time to try this one.  Appeaance: Short, brown, creamy, head sits atop a thick pitch black body. Nice lacing. Decent retention - dies to a creamy halo after 5 minutes or so. Looks like a good RIS, but nothing really stands out as special.  Smell: Smokey, meaty, and floral. Hickory and dark fruits maybe? Caramel is quite prevalent, as is roasted malt and (to a lesser degree) coffee. Floral hops and estery alcohol bring the quaff to a close. Although I'm not sure if any distinction exists, I would call this an English-style RIS (as opposed to an American RIS). The main components of the aroma are sweet, fruity, and smokey, whereas American RIS's focus more on black coffee, dark chocolate, pine, and charred wood. This is the best English-style RIS I've ever come across.  Taste: Similar to smell: meat, smoke, caramel, coffee, leafy floral hops, and roasted malt. Chocolate is also in there, but it's more subdued than the other flavors. I had heard a lot of mixed reviews about this beer, the majority of them underwhelming. Now that I've tried it myself, I must say that I absolutely love it! Great job Stone!  Mouthfeel: Syrupy, thick, sticky, creamy, hearty, and moderately carbonated. Very smooth. Leaves a sticky residue on my lips.  Drinkability: I want some more of this soooo bad! I was expecting an absolute hop-bomb from Stone, but this turned out to be delicate and harmonious. This is one beautifully addictive RIS.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,96

There is also a significant amount of plum and rasin dark fruit smell. T= very nice and smooth. This is a 2008 vintage and its actually got some oak notes? Was it in oak at any point?

Pours a dark oily black, with an mean burnt brown colored head, really haven't seen a head like that in a while, no real lacing to write home about, so it just misses the perfect appearance mark. Nose is of rich roasted malt, bitter chocolate and coffe, with hints of molasses.

There is a strong taste of espresso, chocolate, roasted malts, but def. lacking the bitterness, I almost wish I would have drank this sooner, o well. It is pretty smooth on the mouth and is a silky velvet texture could be a little thicker though. The beer is listed at 10% and the alcohol is hidden pretty well, a sipper for sure just for the style.

147,1160,benwah22,4.63,"There's two smells to this beer - first is when the beer is still where you get the dark coffee with the backdrop of burnt molasses and dark chocolate. Then swirl the beer in the glass, think sweet dark fruits - figs, raisons, even blackberry...all with a hint of alcohol.  The beer appears black, but held to the light a deep amber/blackish/brownish/tawney hue can be seen. Dark khaki head that starts fluffy and leaves quickly.  Low carbonation, syrupy, and smooth in the mouth.  The taste is complex - no two ways about it. At first you're hit with the savory - the espresso, the dark chocolate, the tobacco, then the burnt sweet kicks in - think dried dark fruits and burnt sugar/molasses. Lastly, you get the alcohol - but you're not beat over the head with it.  This beer is surprisingly drinkable...well, until the 10.2% catches up to you.

Lots of bitterness from roasted malts - some nuttiness, fruitiness and chocolate along with a shot of booze. Nothing to write home about.  M. Thick and low in carbonation - just the way a RIS should be. This beer expands across your palate very nicely.  D. A sipper - I split a bomber with my wife, 11 ounces is plenty for me.

T - Slightly smoky and earthy, but the sweetness of chocolate is definitely there. I get a long finish of toasted malt.

It just rolls around your mouth. A bit of a sticky feel after swallowing, though I don't think you could make a brew this rich without a bit of stickiness.  D - This is one of those beers with which you should take your time. It takes some endurance to drink a brew this rich and complex - next time I would share it with a friend. I'm sure it ages exceptionally well. A must-try for stout lovers and adventurous beer drinkers alike!",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,96
147,1160,Monsteruss,3.97,"The foam was a deep coffee wheat/tan color, smooth and lacey. The color was opaque/dark brown with amber/mahogany highlights in the light. The smell was of a burnt mahogany, molassis with wheat overtone and subtle fruity undertones, complex. The taste was a deep, rich molassis, wheat flavoured, nutty and a little bitter and a little sweet. Mouthfeel - heavy-bodied, smooth and rich. I had to drink it somewhat slowely to enjoy the complex taste. Drinkability - heavy and smooth - good if you like the extended time to enjoy a rich porter taste - very good session.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,96
147,1160,AChamberlain,3.98,"Garnished in a trade with mattolesh, thanks! 2008 release. 12oz bottle.  Poured thick, black and beautiful. Thick brown head. Roasty, molasses aroma. Sweet, yet spicy. Roasted coffee flavor, chocolaty. Boozy after first couple of sips. Anise, raisin flavors as well. Some hop bitterness, slowly ripping at my tongue. Thick, oily mouthfeel. Nice to sip. Take your time with this one. Slowly now, warm it a bit. It definitely stands out from other RISs. I would love to buy a cache and age some.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,96
147,1160,Bartrob6,4.53,pours a very dark black. just like a stout should. with a beautiful head that looks like chocolate milk. great lacing left on the glass.  smells of burnt and roasted malts with some dark fruits also. a little coffe smell in there too. very inviting aroma. alcohol smell too...but i mean....its a 10.5% beer. what would you expect?  tastes basically the same way it smells. awesome balance between the dark fruits and roasted/burnt malts. slight alcohol burn but is nicely balanced with an extremely creamy mouthfeel.  i would love sipping this beer all night long. i just wouldn't have too many of them cause after a couple bombers of this i probably wouldn't really remember much of drinking them....  overall...incredible beer. well done stone.,Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,96
147,1160,greg202stewart,4.5,"A- Awesome bottle, love the Russian hat on the Gargoyle. The beer is dark like soy sauce with a very thin head. No seeeing through this one, it's a black void  S- smells like coffee and alcohol and rocket fuel  t- Definitely a sipper, but not because it's bad tasting, just very strong. I really like the flavors this one has, coffee, malt, and the rest is undefinablly delicious.  m- like holding a sip of whiskey in your mouth, nice and strong  d- a winter warmer, a seasonal beer for me",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,96
147,1160,rossthefireman,4.83,"2009 vintage A- this beer has a brownish black appearance. No visibilty through the beer! Great foamy head that lasts.  S- huge roasted coffee/roasted malt smell with a hint of alcohol.  T- Damn, this beer is huge on flavor. Chocolate and slight vanilla, some roasted coffee notes. Dark fruits , particularly dark cherry. Toffee, caramel, and roasted espresso. There are a lot of flavors playing around in this stout and all of them work great together.  M- Great mouth feel, good carbonation and slightly dry finish.  D- very drinkable now and probably even more drinakble is the years to come.  My god this stout is fantastic! The flavors that play around in your mouth are just awesome. Its as if you can get different flavors in every sip. This beer is going to age well and should just meld the excellent flavors of time.

147,1160,AVDeuph,4.25,"This is the Spring 2009 distribution...I'm excited to review this beer because it has been a while since I've had this and I know my tastes have changed significantly.  A: Blackish-Black. One finger mocha-colored head that was relatively short-lived.  S: Coffee, dark malts, and most pervasively, chocolate aromas. Very slight background of alcohol.  T: Dark chocolate (and possibly some even darker fruits?). Alcohol warms just a little bit, it's a good feeling. Black-coffee-bitter finish.  M: Nice and heavy, a soft bed of carbonation that really feels more like a general liveliness than anything else.  D: Well, I mean it's certainly tasty...flavors are robust enough to slow down the drinking process, so it's not like you are going to specifically want another one right away. Don't confuse that with the beer having low drinkability, it's just that I'm going to take my time and enjoy it.  This beer gets great reviews for a reason. A must-try for RIS lovers.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,96
147,1160,FishGetter,3.98,Reviewed on 4-28-09 Spring 2008 release.  Jet black apperance with thin mocha colored head that quickly disipates. Suttle hop bitterness aroma blended with dark chocolate. Equal amounts of dark roasted cofee. Alcohol gives a slight tingle sensation to the nose. First impression is a quick burst of bitter chocolate followed by deep roasted cofee notes. Finishes up with a fearless alcohol presance that remains. Solid body here with thick mouthfeel. Oily resins cling to tounge with fading alcohol. Without a question one of the best RIS! Drink only suffers mildly from intence ABV.,Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,96
147,1160,McDiddyPop,4.38,"Vintage Spring 2009. 22oz bomber poured into a Cigar City snifter. Jet plack pour with a thin mocha head that diminishes to nothing. Scattered lacing along the sides of the glass. Ruby red hues when I tilt the glass in the light. Smells of dark roasted coffee. Sweet milk chocolate. A hint of toffee or caramel. A touch of alcohol shows through in the finish. Tastes of roasted grains, a bit of dark chocolate. Sweet toffee notes towards the front of the tongue, dark roasted bitterness on the sides with a smooth alcohol warmth at the back of the throat. Carbonation is just about perfect. Finishes with a slight burnt chocolate aftertaste. Alcohol peeks its head in towards the end, but overall a very drinkable beer, especially considering its ABV. This stout deserves to be in the top 10.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,96
147,1160,angelmonster,3.88,"This is the 2009 vintage  Pours a big 3 finger dark chocolate head. Body is pitch black in color with no light at all coming through. Good lacing and great head retention through out  Smell is big on roasted malt and coffee. Faint alcohol is smelled and there is also some hops in there  Wow, big malt is present here. Very roasted and a little chalky. Taste is similar to dove dark chocolate. Hops and alcohol are more pronounced in taste than they were in the smell  There is a semi creamy head to this beer. Body is alright but a bit thin for a RIS. Carbonation is lively.  Overall this is an above average RIS.

Taste is a little sweeter than expected. Well balanced for as bold as it is. Excellent taste. Not as coffeeish as I expected, nor as rosty, but really a combination.  Mouthfeel is right on, and for the high abv, the drinkability is great.  I was expecting to be let down on this, but was pleasantly surprised by a world class beer.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,96
147,1160,BirdFlu,3.93,"Smells very roasty and sweet, very malty and a bit earthy. Pour is a super dark, near-black color with light brown head. The only thing preventing it from looking perfect is it seems like it should look a bit more viscous, a bit thicker. Tastes vey rich, roasy with a bit of dark chocolate. A slot of roasty malt with a good amount of bitterness behind it. Bitterness in aftertaste is a bit much and as it opens up the whole drnk takes on a sort of bourbony, rum-soaked-raisins flavor. Good but not great. Mouth has a crisp carbonation bite, moderate viscosity and not too chewy like most RIS's. Its definitely good and quite tasty but you really need to be in the mood for it, its not something that could be enjoyed at anytime. I didn't even finish the bottle because hte last 3 or so ounces were just too much. It would be better as single 12 oz bottles.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,96
147,1160,Darius75,4.4,"2009 batch served from bomber into a large wine glass.  Appearance: Dark brown, almost black, light tan ring of foam around the edges of the glass. Thick as an RIS should be.  Smell: Chocolate, roasted malts.  Taste: Licorice and malty roastiness, rich dark chocolate, moderate alcohol presence mellows the flavors in the finish. This beer is quite complex, and does not reflect a common RIS taste... it has a fruity quality which almost reminds me of a dark Belgian.  Mouthfeel: Lower carbonation, smooth but not silky. Goes down easily if sipped.  Drinkability: Drink a bomber by yourself and you're down for the count. It's a slow sipper for sure, but packed with flavor so that's not a problem. This is a phenomenal beer, and unlike anything that I would have expected. Strong recommendation.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,96
147,1160,MetalHopHead6,3.93,"22oz bottle poured into a snifter.  Stone Imperial Russian Stout poured jet black with a moderate tan head. The smell is thick and acidy--not too strong, but not too pleasant either, like overly roasted, bitter coffee beans. The taste, however, is spot-on for an imperial stout. It's like roasty licorice, if there is such a thing.  The feel also is thick. It sits for a long time on the back of the tongue and the alcohol presence is overpowering. It must be sipped very slowly.  Stone Imperial Russian Stout feels like a rainy, chilly afternoon...good for the soul, but only when you're in the perfect, laid back mood.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,96
147,1160,HopoPotomus,4.25,"I first tried this beer a while back while I was making an imperial oatmeal stout. Since then I placed this beer as one of my favorite ""big ass stouts"" that I search out whenever possible. The appearance of this beer is striking and memorizing. The think tan head flows into a meaty bold mouthfeel. As with any great stout it feels as if you can chew this brew as it swishes around your palate. The taste and smell of this beer confirms that the appearance of this beer is not false advertising. Notes of vanilla dance in the perfect balance of sweetness and alcoholic strength. Bordering on hot this beer does let you know exactly what you are imbibing without deterring you from grabbing for another.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,96
147,1160,nycwinter,4.08,"Poured from a bottle into a chalice. A= Thin dark creamy head dissipated to a thin ring around the edge of the glass. Viscous. Alchohol and legs slide down the sides when swirled. The body is very dark, opaque, and deep red on the edges when held up to the light.  S= Tangy dried fruit. Moderate to strong alchohol smell. Roasted toasty caramel or malt backing. Very simple stout.  T= Very bitter and tangy. Very little fruit. Burnt dark chocolate aftertaste. Drier than expected. Again, pretty simple stout.  M= Full bodied. Warm alchohol feel overall.  D= Stronger than expected, but pleasant overall.  The bottle suggests to let it age.

This is one of the darkest brews I've seen yet.  S- Big roasted coffee and bittersweet chocolate nose. Lots of malt and grain aroma with a hint of hazelnut. A very detectable ester presence and alcohol was quite prominent.  T- Big roasted malt flavor. Flavors include coffee, chocolate, grain, dark fruits, alcohol, and roasted nuts. The taste is syrupy with molasses, sweet malt and caramel coming through as it warms.  M- Full and creamy/oily with ok carbonation. This aftertaste isn't going anywhere soon.  D- Big powerful brew that can cripple a weak palate into submission. Drink with caution.

Appearance is jet black with a little bit of head (thin film) and thick, sticks to the glass when jostled. Smell is of coffee/burnt malt. Taste is, as before, like a car bomb, in that it has a little bit of sweetness, a lot of alcohol, the roasted malt flavor and a bit of bitterness. Can't wait for this to mellow out. Definitely sticks in the mouth. Had to drink pretty slow with the alcohol.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,96
147,1160,gameface23,3.72,"Review from 11/27/2008: 2008 vintage. Pours a jet black with a very small dark khaki head. Smell was muted, but had aromas of must, hops, very bitter chocolate, anise, and dark fruits. Taste was average at best, but did have a full-bodied mouthfeel. I have come to the realization that I enjoy stouts much more if they have coffee in them. If they don't, I find them underwhelming.  EDIT from 5/5/2009: 2008 vintage. I bumped the taste score up a 1/2 a point. The year of aging has improved the taste somewhat. It's still on the boozy side, but more flavors have appeared.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,96
147,1160,atsprings,4.89,"2007 Vintage on-tap at Flying Saucer Charlotte served in a tulip glass a nice opaque black with a thin tan head. Aroma was a wonderful blend of bakers cocoa, fresh ground coffee and roasted malts. Taste was a wonderfully complex roasty blend of cocoa and coffee that gets even better as it warms, reaching the point where it is meal in itself, or a least a very fancy dessert. The beer is certainly on the heavy side, but age has served it well providing a great smoothness. This one was truly fantastic, enough for me to want to pick up a bunch of this beer and age it for years to come.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,96
147,1160,ffejherb,3.88,"Vintage 2007 bomber into pint glass on 4/29/09. Thanks to Deuane for sharing.  A - Poured a pure black body with one-finger burnt mocha head that quickly diminished to a thin, patchy veil and deposited spotty lace on the glass.  S - Mild soy sauce character with some bitter chocolate notes and dark roasted malt character. Aroma wasn't as strong as I was anticipating.  T - Milk chocolate and roasted malt up front with a subtle soy sauce character. The bitterness builds up steam as the liquid warmed up. Hint of earthy, leafy hops appears in the finish.  M - Medium to full bodied with a slick, oily texture and soft carbonation resulting in a smooth mouthfeel overall. Mild alcohol warmth on the tongue.  D - Very good RIS, but not as mind-blowing as I had hoped. Regardless, this was a nice vintage brew that was quite smooth, tasty and pretty mellow overall.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,96
147,1160,ncstateplaya,4.5,"I loved the look of this beer, almost like pouring chocolate syrup from an amber bottle. Very viscous and dark, simply black with no visible carbonation. The pour forms a thick mousse like cookie dough colored head. There was adequate lacing in the glass when I was done.  It smells malty with tons of roasted nuts and a strong hint of alcohol. Maybe a little coffee in the background but not a significant contributor.  Tastes smokey and bitter, the coffee comes through much more so in the flavor than the smell. A very nutty taste that reminds me of dry roasted peanuts. You pick up the alcohol on the finish.  Medium to heavy bodied with great carbonation. Just enough carbonation to let you know its there. Very smooth and viscous, leaves your mouth feeling somewhat oily.  IMHO the ABV is the only inhibiting factor. Could have the will and desire to drink 8 of these brews but would never make it. Great taste, excellent body, all around a terrific beer.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,96
147,1160,Magpie14,4.75,"A: murky black with soft burnt sienna edges. Huge and glorious cocoa chocolate colored cap that maintains a presence well after the pour. After the blob of foamed chocolate melted away the bubbles that remained exuded a soapy shine. The lacing provided light blobs of film coating the glass in random order  S: the nose is just as amazing as the look. Huge roasted malts, slightly blackened. Bittersweet chocolates, cocoa powder, and smokey roasted coffee beans. I can even pull some fudge brownie notes. It just has that vibe and definition  T: a wonder beer! Huge dark chunk-roasted malt goodness. Flavors reminiscent of black currants, cocoa crusted bitter coffee beans, a slab or two of molasses, and some of the finest bitter chocolate chunks I have tasted in liquid form. What took me so long to get a hold of and drink this? Believe it or not a few hops make a bold showing, very delicate. The green cones barely cut through on my malted, chocolate, and anise drenched tongue. Alcohol notes are in the mix and seem too fit like a glove, very harmonious. This is a five!!!  M: the body is a perfect match for the flavors. This is a thick sheet of velvet on the tongue...it has the velvet touch. Incredibly smooth and delicate with powerfully harnessed flavors. I can remember having thicker stouts, but not many  D: This beer is a monster and any stout lover is not complete without giving this bad boy a shot. I had a hard time finding anything wrong with this one...maybe a little strong on alcohol at times? Naw!

Taste: It hits you with some coffee and a bit of a bitterness. Really has a taste of bitter like dark chocolate to it. Definitely some sweetness to this beer. There was a very strong taste of alcohol to it. Some roasted taste to it as well.  Mouthfeel: Wow this is a big beer with some nice carbonation on it. It really has some cream to the taste. Very thick to the point of almost syrupy.  Drinkability: Well the alcohol taste was a little bit too much, but its wonderful mouthfeel just blew my mind.

147,1160,WaXHeLL,4.39,"2009 Vintage 22oz bomber poured into a pint glass - 10.5% ABV. Tasted on 4/25/2009.  Appearance - Pours pitch black, with minimal head. Head has a slight tan hue, but nowhere as dark and tan as stone's 12th anniversary stout. Nice lacing down the side of the glass.  Smell - hints of roasted coffee, bitter chocolate, roasted (but not burnt) malts. Real nice and appealing aroma.  Taste - Super complex -- can definitely taste the roasted malts and coffee. The malts come on pretty strong and taste slightly burnt. The slightly bitter finish is done pretty well. Real bold flavor that stays strong from start to end. Slight hoppy taste, but nothing like most of the stone beers. There is a bit of a thick syrupy taste, but it's not sweet, but rather a roasted and smoked taste.  Mouthfeel - thick and carbonated -- tends to stick to your mouth afterwards, but executed above average. A little bit too much carbonation for my tastes. Gets better the further you drink, although still not exceptional (partially lending to the thick, burnt, syrupy like texture).  Drinkability - Smooth, complex, and a real in your face flavor. A little bit more complex than most Stone beers, but definitely tastes like a Stone beer. As with most Stone beers, the high APV isn't apparent in the taste, but hits you later. The high carbonation also puts this slightly back a bit.  Overall -- Some of the more complex flavors probably will come out better with aging, but definitely worthwhile. Overall, the burnt tone is a little excessive, but regardless on the good side. I'm a big fan of complex beers (and a bit of a hophead on the side), and although this doesn't have the hops (I wouldn't expect so in a stout anyways), it does get high marks. However, from stone's selection, I'd probably prefer the everything but the kitchen sink stout (pilot beer #5) or the 12th anniversary bitter oatmeal chocolate stout much more over this one.  Finishing Notes -- Recommend pouring this into a pint glass straight rather than against the side to take off some of the carbonation tones. I have yet to try this on tap, but it probably would be significantly better than the bottle in my opinion. The burnt taste is a little much, but the other complex flavors make up for it.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,96
147,1160,JAA,4.23,"Thankyou Stone for deciding to distribute to Florida. Also thanks to Total Wine for being a kick ass store.  Poured out of the painted-glass bomber into my Brooklyn brewery curvy ""pint glass"". I had to violently pour it, to coax out the one finger tan head. Laces quite well.  Smells pretty good. A pungent charred meat and smoke odor is the dominant characteristic. A fair amount of chocolate is also in their, fighting with the smoke to be noticed. There is also some sort of light fruity note that i can't pin down, (maybe peach or pear).  Tastes fantastic. Chocolatey and roasty. A hint of dark berries peeks through. A bit of spice, which i really enjoy in Russian Imperial Stouts. Overall the smoked meat and chocolate dominate.  Drinkability and mouthfeel are about what you would expect from such a dynamic beer. One bomber is more than enough for tonight. RIS isn't my favorite style, but i'm glad i picked up an extra bottle for the weekend.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,96
147,1160,ColForbinBC,4.25,"22oz bomber poured into a snifter; 2009 Vintage  Pours an ink black with hints of brown along the edges. A thin, one-finger mocha head that subsides to a thin layer and leaves a decent amount of lacing.  Aroma appears to be pretty straightforward. Cherries, bittersweet dark belgian chocolate, solvent alcohol, grassy hops, and roasted (almost charred) malt.  Bittersweet Belgian chocolate and dark cherries mix together with roasted malt and a heavy dose of solvent alcohol...which leads to some moderate burning. The flavor mimics the nose with no real surprises other than the heat from the booze. I know its 10%, but its not hidden at all. Kind of welcome, but not so much.  Silky and creamy with a perfect amount of carbonation to lift it off the tongue.  The booze really slows me down, as it should, but it a bad way. The flavors alone are solid, but not robust. Not as bold and in your face as some others on the market, but a damn fine example of the style.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,96

Milk chocolate, light roast coffee, slight char and smoke aromas. Chocolate entry, again some nice sumatra coffee flavors mix with dry fruit undertones in the finish. Nice velvety feel blankets the tongue. Etanol is definatly a neighbor here, but never bites you. A nice warming component and extremely well integrated. Great stuff.  I've had many a cellard version of this, but I think this is one that drinks sublime enough fresh.

Leaves a linger sweet/toasted flavor in the mouth.  M- Syrupy and smooth with a good carbonation level.  D- An outstanding representation of the style.

I found myself a little disappointed with the taste of this beer. This beer gets better as it warms. The booziness dissipates and it becomes more complex.  I must say, I'm surprised to read all the ""complex"" reviews for this beer. To me, for the style, this beer lacks the complexity and depth of some of the others (ie. Blackout Stout, Expedition Stout, Storm King, etc). It's fairly boozy also. Could have done a better job hiding the alcohol.  It's an okay beer.

147,1160,LordAdmNelson,4.1,"2009 Brew  A- Opaque crude oil black. Relatively thin chocolate milk head. Moderate lacing.  S- Roasted malt, dark chocolate, a little alcohol, some cherry, vanilla. Not extremely strong. Fades to only coffee as it goes on.  T- Interesting here. It seems to always be changing. I got a beefy (tasted like a good steak!!!) taste at the beginning (which was very strange). It evolved into roasted, almost burnt, malt with some oak-y or earthy notes. I get some vanilla, some cooked vegetables, a little hoppy bitterness. Boozy. Complex (which is good), but I'm not digging some of these flavors.  M- Medium-plus bodied. Smooth, slightly prickly from the alcohol.  D- Pretty good, moved through the bomber pretty quickly, but nothing incredible.  I really wanted to like this beer, but I was kind of disappointed. Maybe it needed more age on it.  3.5, 4, 4, 4, 4--Overall: 3.9 (B+)  5-15-09 Re-review  A- A nice tan head (about an inch). Opaque black. Good head for a high ABV stout. Head fades relatively rapidly, however.  S- Some chocolate, some coffee, big malt--biscuity, bready. Decidedly less phenolic than before.  T- Good... I thought I had a bad one last time. Slightly spicy, good coffee, deep dark malt. Slight hop bitterness (very slight). Oaky and earthy. A little boozy. Slight alcohol bite.  M- Velvety and smooth. Carbonation doesn't hamper the mouthfeel at all, but ups the drinkability for a stout like this.  D- Carbonation ups this. Good, a good, enjoyable drink.  Overall, much better than my first review. Dark and malty, a good stout. I would still prefer Yeti or Storm King or FBS or Raspy. Kind of similar to Raspy though.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,96

It was filled on 4/19/09 and consumed on 4/22/09.  Appearance- With a refridgerated 3 day old growler there is perhaps a slight pressure release so on a normal pour it did not result in an overly abundant head. The consistancy is thicker than less malty beers but the motor oil comparison is kind of cliche' at this point. It is noticably ""weighty"" when it hits the glass. The lacework descends sharply when the stout begins to warm and the espresso-like color makes you know you're into a chewy, malty beer experience.  Smell- Aside from the before mentioned espresso comparison, this stout(like most others)comes alive when it gets warmer. Huge grainy notes on a cold first pour but after the temp rises we're running the whole gamut of coffee, currant, dark chocolate, alcohol and bready aromas. One thing I've noticed with this stout is the mellow hoppy smell- which surprised me considering this is a Stone beer. I expected a more pronounced hop aroma.  Taste- Way complex- completely changes character when the temperature changes. Deceptivly drinkable..until the 10.5 ABV kicks in. We're talking classic roasted malt, chewy stout and bread pudding-like flavors. However, there's no cloying sweetness which marrs other potentially great RIS's. One thing that surprised me, however, was the restraint on the hop drop- not what I expected from a Stone beer(and I LOVE Stone beers).  Notes- Like most of you, I LOVE this RIS. It warms the soul and after drinking it it gives you the feeling that all is well in the world. Stone is consistant in making awesome beers and I'm glad that I can get it here in the Low Country.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,96
147,1160,olmatty,4.6,"Spring '09 batch  Appearance- Pours a light brown one finger head and an opaque liquid that is both the color and viscosity of very used motor oil.  Aroma- Chocolate, roasty coffee and some bready yeast aroma.  Taste- Well balanced between roasted coffee, chocolate and a slight molasses and dark fruit sweetness. Just enough hop bitterness rounds out a somewhat dry finish.  Mouthfeel-Middling carbonation, chewy body and palatefilling texture and flavors.  Drinkability- Surprisingly drinkable for such a huge ABV. Smoothness and sheer flavor seems to eclipse alcohol.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,96
147,1160,Vonerichs,4.77,"Pitch black and opaque, no light passing through this beast. The head is very slight and a cinnamon color. It dissipates quicking except for the outer edge. The lacing paces the beer by about 1/2 inch.  What a smell. I popped the cap on this and let it breathe for a minute while I rinsed out my favorite drinking glass. I could literally smell the roasted malt and coffee scents from 6 feet away, and strong. Once poured it really opened up and released strong scents of molasses and dark fruit which I perceived to be blackberry (but after reading the bottle realized it is in fact currant.)  The taste is equally complex and distinct. The nose is unmistakably currant and roasted malt. After the swallow is where this really shines. There is a brief period where this tastes like a dry red wine (or maybe a port,) then that gives way to dark chocolates, espresso, vanilla, caramel, and a slight hop bitterness. The final aftertaste resembles black licorice.  Top notch mouthfeel. Very thick viscosity with just the perfect amount of carbonation. The finish also resembles that of a dry red wine, slightly astringent with detectable tannins. The alcohol makes its presence known, but not as much as I expected with the abv. It actually adds a very classy touch to the overall experience.  I gave this bonus points in drinkability mainly due to the complexity of the flavor and mouthfeel. It would be hard to consume more than a bomber on my own in one sitting, but it is just so enjoyable I finished it wanting more. Compared to other extremely viscous stouts, this doesn't sit rock heavy in the stomach or come across too sweet. In contrast, the dryness seems to make it more drinkable.  This is a world class RIS and I can honestly say this is bar far and away the best I've ever had. Stone advertises this is a great stout to age, and I could definitely see that being the case. If ever given the chance (not sold in IL and I have limited access to Stone brews) I would definitely purchase a few to age.  Note: 2009 batch",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,96
147,1160,alcstradamus,4.38,"I should note that this is a bottle of the 2008 batch. The 2009 has just been released but I have not tried it fresh:  A--Pours pitch black with no highlights and an awesome two finger mocha brown head that recedes pretty slowly. A little bit of lacing is left on the glass.  S--Chocolate, vanilla, caramel, oak, faint bourbon, sweet malts, nuttiness. Very complex  T--The complexity of the nose translates to the taste very well, with the addition of a strong layer of bitter hops that dominate the finish. Chocolate, vanilla, very slight bourbon-like booziness, wood, pine hops, coffee beans, hazelnuts.  M--Creamy but not too thick. Coats the mouth well for a few moments before the carbonation finally washes everything away leaving a coffee bean bitterness that is pleasant.  D--One of the easiest drinking 11% beers I've ever had. The booze is noticeable, but it is not distracting in any way. I'm actually very glad you can taste it because this beer is so damn smooth it would be chuggable without that alcohol burn. And that would not be a good idea to do.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,96
147,1160,Seanibus,4.3,"Pours viscous, thick, and black with an off color, even brownish, head. Initial aroma from the bottle was a strong blast of damp cardboard. But that gives way to roasty and rich, with wood, charcoal and a little plum. Flavor is bitter, woody and a little smoke. Finish is surprisingly dry, with an ashy bitterness. Mouthfeel is thick and slightly clingy, but it finishes cleaner than I expected.

Lacing stays pretty much throughout the tasting.  Smell is of roasted coffee,with a touch of chocolate and caramal. A heavy boozy smell is present too.  Taste is very thick like drinking syrup,and very smooth to go with that thickness.Little bit of a fruity aftertaste when it settles in the stomach. For such a heavy hitter it really dosen't have that burn like most big brews have.  Mouth is very thick,full bodied and good carbonation.

Coffee, toffee and molasses.  Flavor has a nice smokiness with a subtle but still there coffee overtone and just a touch of a combo of molasses and vanilla and a mild bitterness that stays in the finish.  Mouthfeel is good, possibly a bit too much carbonation, but otherwise a fine viscosity and a nice tongue coating and a smidgeon of alcohol heat.  This is an RIS that I could possibly drink for an entire night, but that could change with some aging.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,96

March 2010 edit - recently enjoyed another bottle with more age on it ('08 vintage). less head; virtually none, really. a more noticeable smell of dark soy that translated into a more savory flavor (though the overall impression is still on the sweet/malty side). feel about the same, i.e. smooth but not exceptionally creamy. excellent drinkability remains.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,96
147,1160,morimech,3.76,"Spring 2009 Release  Pours a dark black, appears viscous, with a moderate brown head. Heavy lacing is left on the glass surface. Reviewers describe an awesome aroma but all I get is a shot of alcohol. Maybe a little roasted malt as well. Things pick up in the flavor department but not much. The main flavor component is a roasted/burnt bitterness. Missing subtle flavors that would warrant a higher grade. A substantial body with proper carbonation. Not as thick as other RIS but still good. A good RIS but nothing that sets it above others in the style.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,96

Something else I can't quite put my finger on in the mix too. Nice.  The taste opens malty and rich, with hints of coffee and chocolate. The other flavors fade, finishes with the coffee dominating the taste. Somewhat more bitter than some other stouts, but not overbearingly so.  The mouthfeel is the weakest aspect of this beer. It just doesn't feel as full and rich as I was hoping it would. A bit of a disappointment here. It's not bad, but it's less impressive than a lot of other top flight stouts.  I wouldn't call this a session beer by any stretch, but all 22oz were plenty enjoyable. Best sipped slowly, but smooth enough.

Head quickly thins out leaving bubbles and a slim layer of tan carbonation. I was on the couch grabbing my computer to do this review and could smell this RIS all the way on the coffee table...wow! I get chocolate milk, alcohol, roasted nuts, on the nose. I taste dark chocolate mixed with heavy cream, almonds, and a bitter alcohol flavor on the finish.

147,1160,dqderrick,4.83,"2009 22oz Bottle --- Purchased at Encinitas, CA Bevmo for $5.69. Funny, I live in Carlsbad and have purchased 3 different kegs from Stone direct... not to mention having tasted every beer Stone has made over the last 2 years at least... and this is my first Stone review after over 30. Significance = None.  NOTE: My 2008 IRS review that was completed on the same day (4/15/2009) can be found toward the bottom.  A - 5.0 Pure black. Poured with just over 1/4"" chocolate milk colored head. As the head dissipated, I swirl the glass and can see bubbles effervescing just under the surface along the edge of the glass. The lacing slips down the sides. Towards the bottom of the glass as it thins, it looks a little like RC cola in color. It seems more carbonated than I remember the 2008 IRS. It looks amazing... I long for it.  S - 3.5 Roasted grains. I can smell the alcohol. Is it my glass? A little chocolate. Even a little nutty smell. Maybe even a little hairspray? Odd. I pick up sweetness... maybe a little honey? Still picking up a little hairspray. I think the smell will improve with age as I remember the 08 smelling at least 4.5 worthy. HAIR SPRAY!  T - 5.0 Malty chocolate, a hint of caramel. Awesome. I could drink this until the cow come home. There is a little espresso in the flavor. Some roasted grains. A hint of molasses. I'm revisiting the malty chocolate experience. Damn. This 22oz is going fast.  MF - 4.0 Seems more carbonated that I remember. More than I like. But, still quite good. My tongue feels a little numb... in a good way.  D - 5.0 Crazy drinkability. I had a 5 gallon keg of the 2008 IRS and found myself going back for 3rds on quite a few nights. I'd love to get another keg, but I just don't trust my self control. I must admit, this isn't as smooth as the 2008 IRS is now. But, we've all come to expect a fresh Stone IRS to be a little harsh with alcohol. The fresh hops may add some to that as well.  === === ===  2008 12oz Bottle --- 12oz bottle purchased at Stone Brewery for $3. I just had the 2009 and had to compare. WOW, what a difference.  A - 5.0 I have nothing to complain about. Carbonation is a tad lower. The 1/4"" head appeared but dissipated quickly to the edges. Visually, seems right on par with a fresh 2009 with only a small bit less carbonation... but hardly noticable.  S - 4.5 Home run. So much more going on here than the fresh 2009. Floral malt smell with little to no alcohol/hairspray smell. Smells a bit like wet wood. A little caramel chocolate. Even a smidge of bourbon.  T - 5.0+ Smooth, earthy, even a little wood aged. Honey sweet comes with the aftertaste. Upfront, silky bourbon chocolate. Crazy good. Just a hint of coffee/espresso.  MF - 4.5 Deliciously silky. Swirls around my tongue lightly but pronounced. Leaves a woody-aged feel.  D - 5.0+ For this high of ABV (10.8%).... scary drinkable. What a year does! This one year aged beer is even more drinkable than the 2009. I'm almost sorry I gave the 2009 a 5.0 and now I can't go any higher.

147,1160,Thorpe429,4.33,"Spring 2008 Release  G: Poured into an oversized snifter.  A: Pours a very dark, rich brown that is opaque in the glass. A finger or more of light cocoa-colored head with a good amount of carbonation visible in it. Pretty good lacing.  S: Strong on the alcohol. First scents are chocolate, cherry skins, caramel. Rich, roasted malts.  T: Waited until this one warmed up a little bit to fill out the taste profile--it definitely improves as it gets more toward room temperature. Plenty of complexity. Caramel with hints of chocolate, all behind a solid roasted, dark malt backbone. Not as much of the dried fruit as I picked up in the nose. This almost hits me as a cross between a RIS and an American Imperial Stout. Either way, very solid.  M: Medium-bodied with an above-average amount of carbonation. Definite alcohol warmth. Slightly chewy.  D: Highly drinkable for an RIS.

147,1160,roadhouse,4.38,"The first review below is for the new bottle, but I kept the score for the old bottle since it was higher.  Spring '09 Review look: 4 | smell: 3.5 | taste: 4 | feel: 4.5 | drink: 4 3.95 B+  Poured from a 22 oz. bomber into a snifter.  Appears completely black with a one and a quarter inch tan head produced after a fairly hard pour.  Aroma is chocolaty primarily, a slight dark fruit character of cherries perhaps, a light hop presence, and a tinge of alcohol.  Taste is chocolaty up front with the fruit character entering in the middle. Finish becomes a lot more coffee-like and bitter especially since there is a lot of citrus and piney hops present. A bit of an alcoholic finish.  Mouthfeel is creamy as hell, pretty thick body, I suppose it could be called chewy.  Overall I really don't like this one that much when fresh. Obviously from my review below with only a few more months on it, I liked it much more. I will probably pick up another bottle this week to put in the cellar but this brew just doesn't impress me that much right now. There's too much hop flavor and everything seems to be struggling to blend but just can't get it done.  ---  Spring '08 Review (08/08/08) 4.5/4/4.5/4.5/4.5  For my 100th review I thought I'd do something special that I've been wanting to try. Well lucky me, I found a bomber of this stuff today at a liquor store that I had never been to.  Poured from a 22 oz. bomber into a tulip glass.  Appears a pitch black color that is completely opague. No light is getting through this one. Big two and a half finger dark tan head that sinks to a coating and sticks around to leave some sticky lacing down the side of the glass.  Aroma is bursting with sweet and roasted malt. Caramel, chocolate, coffee, and raisins come to mind.  The taste...wow, the taste. Sweet caramel and molasses up front followed by a big dose of dark chocolate and a bitter coffee-like finish with a bit of alcohol. After the swallow the hops come out on the tongue, take a bow, and do a little dance to the tune of the First Promenade of Pictures at An Exhibition. Royalty right here.  Mouthfeel is nice and thick without being syrupy. Excellent.  What a great beer. That's all I need to say.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,96
147,1160,DarbyOGill,4.52,"Poured into a Duvel tulip glass.  A: Poured like molasses, jet black, with a think brown head. Pretty nice lacing. REALLY DARK  S: Smells boozy, but at 11% ABV that isn't surprising. Strong malt flavors also come through.  T: Starts with alcolhol taste hitting the palette followed by a little burn. The alcohol is then followed by chocolate hints and I get a slight coffee flavor. I always get a flavor resembling soy sauce in all RIS I drink, this beer is no exception (and for some reason it's a good thing). I got a strong malty flavor throughout each sip, which was really enjoyable. It ends similarly to how it starts, I get a nice alcohol finish.  D: Goes down really smooth. Not as heavy as I expected, but I could probably only drink 1 or 2 before moving to lighter beers. This beer is pretty hard hitting. This is my first beer of the night and I'm already feeling it pretty good. Anything over 1 or 2 would be a waste anyways, because I'd already be tipsy at that point.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,96
147,1160,MacDomer,3.62,"12oz bottle from 2008 poured into my Duvel tulip.  Looks nice - this is black as black can be, light tan head which doesn't last, not much of a cap either after 5 min. Smells good, and the thing that jumps out to me is some kind of sweetness. It's pretty rich, with some chocolate, dates, raisins, some licorice, prunes, and I'm sure some other things I'm missing. A bit of alcohol. Taste is also good, medium-full, pretty rich, and rather sweet. Flavors like the nose. Ton of malt. Feels fine, but I'd prefer less carbonation. I'm going to score this lower on the drinkability scale, not because it isn't sessionable (which it's not, but what are you expecting from a RIS after all?), but because after I eventually consume the other couple of bottles of this that I have, I probably will not seek out again. Fun to try, but just not to my taste. A bit too sweet for how I like my RIS.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,96

Roasted malts and sweet coffee. A lot of dark fruits as well with some alcohol coming from this fresh bottle. A bit of cream and vanilla in the distance.  T- A sweet blast of chocolate with coffee not to far behind. Roasted malts follow and play well with the vanilla/cream underlay. I'm getting just a hint of a tootsie roll flavor. Some hops balance it all out making for a delicious treat. A bit of fresh alcohol.  M- Full bodied with some apparent alcohol sting but some malt fullness to heal any wounds. Coats the mouth with the main ingredients focusing on chocolate. Some bitterness and a bit of carbonation. Pretty good all around.  D- Best to be split with the high ABV but I could see myself with one of these in the middle of winter. Not the most drinkable RIS i've had but perhaps some age can fix the dents.

There is some underlying coffee and smokiness that follows shortly after.

T: Bitter chocolate hits the tongue. followed by a subtle fruitiness and acidic coffee. the heat from the alcohol comes through pleasantly at the end but is dangerously well masked, especially for a bottle with no age on it.  M: Viscous lingering mouthfeel. subdued carbonation. what one would expect in a russian imperial stout.

147,1160,ahpark,4.62,"22oz bomber poured into a tulip. Beer is completely opaque in glass with nice dark roast coffee-esque head. Scent is superb; if I didn't know better I'd think I was smelling a glass of chocolate milk or one of those sugary Starbucks drinks. A hint of hazelnut or almond is also present at the end.  Taste is reminiscent of a strong iced espresso. There's a nice, in-your-face dark chocolate bitterness upfront, and as it goes down the throat, a nice aroma of roasted coffee beans and dark burnt caramel invades your palate with a nice alcohol burn to warm up your stomach. I could imagine someone drinking this and mistaking it for a dark roast Irish coffee.  Mouthfeel is nice and thick as a RIS should be. Feels like a nice thick cappuccino milkshake that coats your entire mouth before it goes down. You can actually feel it coating your esophagus and your stomach on the way down. Wonderful.  Drinkability is unrivaled, compared to RIS's I've tried. Alcohol is completely balanced with the flavor, to the point that it's really not noticeable until it's down the hatch. I could see myself drinking these regularly as a nightcap, like a cup of warm milk before bed. Even better, I drool at the thought of having a pint of this on nitro tap.  Overall, this is an amazing RIS. I'm a fan of stouts and porters, but generally not a fan of RIS's because the alcohol takes over the flavors in a large number of them. But this is ridiculously balanced, so much so that I probably wouldn't have known this was a RIS.

147,1160,ThatWineGuy,3.88,"Limited Spring 2008 release, enjoyed an hour after Easter dinner; with Stone Brewing Company's reputation for making excellent beer, I quite looked forward to this.  Opaque, pitch black with a one and a half finger tan head that receded leaving a cloudy, bubbly film over most of the surface. Moderate lacing, head easily regenerates with a swirl. Smells of leather, subdued coffee aroma, brownies and pumpernickel loaf. The taste is really big but not that complex - anise and black licorice predominate but not a lot else going on despite airing and warming. There is a dry brazil nut astringency that compromises a better mouthfeel, a little too astringent for my tastes. Because of that, the texture is just a little rough even considering the style. As well, warming brought out a burnt wood / charcoal aroma. On the plus side, the high ABV is reasonably well handled and there is a hearty, substantial fullness to this stout that is consistent with the style, heavy duty might be a good term for it, this is obviously not a beer for the meek and mild.  Overall, I wish I had cellared this another year during which time the astringency might have settled somewhat and allowed for greater complexity in taste and a more rewarding mouthfeel. The advice on the label to cellar a case and try it at six month intervals is pretty sage and I'd love to try doing that sometime.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,96

147,1160,John_M,4.37,"On tap at Max's today.  The beer pours the expected black brown color, with pretty good head retention and plenty of sticky lacing. On the nose there is a huge blast of coffee, coupled with some roasty malt and vanilla. Flavors on the palate replicate the nose, except there is an underlying creaminess that is really nice. Interestingly, the beer starts off with some moderate sweetness, but the finish is pretty dry. There is also a hint of cherry, licorise and chocolate in this impressive stout. Mouthfeel is medium bodied, but there is a long, creamy, smooth finish that is impressive. Drinkability is pretty good, though you can tell the alcohol is up there a bit. This is clearly the sort of beer that you won't be pounding down a whole lot of.  A couple of thoughts. This is a very good beer, but I have to say, that at least in my opinion, it's not in the same league with Dark Lord, Abyss and KBS. In fact I would probably take the Goose Island Bourbon County over this beer. All that aside, this is still a very fine beer, and an absolute treat to find on tap.

147,1160,caddybuyer,4.55,"Poured from a 22 oz bomber.  Spring 2009 Release  A-Deep brown opaque with a fluffy tan head  S-Roasted malts and dark fruits. Very nice.  T-Thick, sweet malty goodness accented by dark fruits, chickory, coffee, and a hint of cocoa. Honey and molasses, caramel, and perhaps a hint of licorice and cherry thrown in. A bit of back end hop bitterness, but not much. Utterly delicious.  M-Damn near perfect. Thick, chewy and viscous. A perfect match for the style.  D-One and done with this, but only because of the nature of the beast. Thank goodness I have more in the cellar, and I am going out to get more as well. You cannot drink more than one of these and appreciate the nuances.  Stone remains one of my favorite breweries, and this is an absolutely tasty effort. I am going to introduce this to my stout drinking friends who think Guinness is gods gift to the Irish. Damn this is good. Now I just have to decide which I like more, this, or Founders Breakfast!",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,96
147,1160,crazeguy,4.13,Poured from Bomber into a New Belgium goblet.  Deep jet black color. Brown thin head.  Smells roasty and espresso-ey. Smells like the better stouts I've had. Reminiscent of Old Rasputin for example.  Taste is strong and determined. Pleasant though.  Mouthfeel is thick and creamy.  This is probably the best RIS I've had. Beats Speedway Stout by a mile.  Can't wait to taste this with a few years on it.,Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,96

147,1160,Gosox8787,4.57,"I had heard good things about this beer, and, I must confess, this is my first beer from the Stone Brewery. Picked up at a bottle at my liquor store. Poured into a glass with a slight brown head. The brew is completely opaque and black, resembling most well made Russian Imperial Stouts. The smell is intense with dark fruits, chocolate and coffee being the predominantt aromas. The taste is phenomenal. There is a great balance in all the flavors, with chocolate, coffee, expresso, and dark fruits all present but none overpowering. The mouthfeel is heavy with a slight bite to the carbonation near the end of each sip. Drinkability is not great because of the heavy flavor profile and high ABV.  Overall, one of the better RIS's I have had and a great example of the style. Definitely made me want to try more from this brewery.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,96
147,1160,Nick3,4.47,"Beer pours a liquid black color that looks as dangerous and ominous as the Warlock on the bottle. No head whatsoever, but a chocolate brown film rims the glass a the top of the brew. Smell is a smoky chocolate mocha and it makes me want to drink it now. Taste is expresso and chocolate. Alcohol is very well masked; could easily put a few of these down. Finish is roasted malts with a touch of hops. Full bodied almost syrupy with low carbonation. Wow, the best RIS I've ever had.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,96
147,1160,BringusKilkenney,4.5,Poured into a pint glass from brown bottle. Had a nice black as tar color to it with a thick mocha head that dissipated slowly. Real inviting and just gorgeous color  The smell was of sweet caramel and barley could pick up the alcohol but despite the abv was not a prominent factor.  the taste was great burnt toast and roasted malts just like you would expect in an imperial. What blew me away was the vanilla and sweetness i could catch a hint of this brew is done superbly.  The mouthfeel was heavy like a brick and had a nice balance of carbonation in there to just enough to make you want to go back for more.  Couldnt handle more than two or three of these but wouldnt need to cause you are feeling great after the first and even more so after the second what a great beer to just take your time and enjoy.,Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,96
147,1160,steelerguy,4.28,"A - Pours black with a large tan head. You are not going to see through this sucker and the head just lasts and lasts.  S - You got your dark fruits smells that are so good in an RIS and you can also get some roasted malt notes with a little licorice.  T - Awesome, full of flavor, super robust, lots of malt flavors to dissect here. At first I tasted plumbs, slightly sweet, then some roasted coffee notes hit. There is a nice hop presence, you will definitely get some bitterness on the palate early on. A little alcohol warming, but you would never guess it was 10.8%. Quite smooth, a viscous feel like most big beers. Didn't really detect the carbonation.  M - Very good, smooth and viscous. You know you a lot of malt went into making this beer. Warming and smooth without being harsh on the alcohol.  D - One of the most drinkable 10%+ beers I have had. Damn near hearty and you could easily drink too much of this because it disguises it's alcohol content so well.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,96
147,1160,db27,4.26,"A-the party starts before you even pop the top off. Stone did a great job on the bottling, and the fun little story. Pours about as dark as any beer of seen or tried with a small dark tan head.  S-I'd hoped for a little more out of the smell, this one is subtle but evident alcohol smell. I'd expected to get a little more in the way of sweet smell.  T-For a plus 10 percent beer this one doesn't taste it (a good thing IMO) and has very likable nuttiness that I cannot quite place. Strong, complex, and satisfying.  D-Surprisingly drinkable for a bigtime beer of this type, definately a sipper and through one snifter I was feeling it a bit.  Overall I really enjoyed this beer, and would absolutely encourage anyone who can find it to try it.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,96
147,1160,slk22,3.92,"Pours nearly pitch black with a tan/brown head with little to no staying power. This beer is hugely aromatic. Chocolate, coffee, bready malt, nuttiness, and a bit of alcohol. Taste mainly follows the nose with strong coffee or espresso, roasted malt, and a hint of warming alcohol. The main surprise here was the high level of ester sweetness, which was more than expected, and was a tad overbearing. Mouthfeel was medium to full bodied with low to medium carbonation. This is a really nice offering, but is a bit strong for a session beer.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,96
147,1160,MunchkinDrinker,4.63,"A - Pitch black with a dark brown foam that builds slowly to a nice thick head. Sticky lacing all the way down.  S - Dark roasty malts, coffee, chocolate, a little cherry. There's a spicy bitterness that comes in ontop of the underling roasty sweetness.  T/M - Cream, roasted coffee, dark cocoa, dark malty sweetness. There's alot more flavors than this, but my palate is too unsophisticated. Some tangy fruits underneath it all, like blueberries, cherries, or raspberries. Alcohol is simply warming, but it's not there in the flavor, which I think is very nice. Mouthfeel is thick, but not overbearing. It leaves a film in your mouth that at first felt strange, but it imparts the flavor of this wonderful beer in your mouth even when you're not sipping it.  D - It's too high alcohol to be very drinkable. You start to feel it halfway through the glass, but it's wonderful stuff.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,96
147,1160,AlcahueteJ,4.43,"Limited spring 2008 release reviewed in March 2009  A - Pours black as night, one of, if not the darkest beer I've ever seen. Half-inch tan coffee-like head that slowly fades leaving a thin brown lace all over the glass.  S - All roasted malts up front, with bittersweet chocolate coming through after. There's a hop bitterness that pulls through towards the end. It's Stone, there's always hops somewhere.  T - Hint of espresso, followed by bittersweet chocolate flavors. As the beer lingers on the the tongue the espresso flavor returns, only much stronger this time. A bitter roasted flavor all around as well. It's not unwelcome, but I feel this would fade with some time, making the beer more well-rounded.  M - Smooth creamy mouthfeel, not too viscous. I remember the mouthfeel being quite viscous the last time I had this beer years ago, not as much this time. A pronounced hop twang on the tongue as well.  D - I can feel the alcohol slightly, but at 10.8% I should be feeling much more than this. That's really the only negative thing I can say about this beer in terms of drinkability. Truly one of the most drinkable stouts I've tasted, so I'm going to go ahead and give this a 5 here. Definitely a sipper, but something I could easily sip all night long. In this case it's a nightcap though. I have two more bottles I'm cellaring, can't wait to try those out.

No visible light penetration. I wonder if even a laser would show through (probably)?  S) I smell mostly dark roast coffee; licorice and alcohol.  T) Dark chocolate prevails. I think I'm also detecting some hops at the end.  M) I felt my tongue slightly numb from the alcohol right away, but then it gets chewy.  D) One is plenty!

The head is tan and has a neat glistening copper ring around the edge. Nice lacing.  The aroma is outstanding, dominated by bitter chocolate, roastiness, malts, and anise. I picked up a little alcohol in the aroma as well.  Taste is superb. Bitter and sweet chocolate, coffee, malty and nice touch of hops. Alcohol, although evident, is well incorporated. Very aggressive flavors, but very well balanced.  Mouth feel is thick, but creamy. Very smooth with the perfect amount of carbonation.  Overall, this was an experience with the complexity of flavors. The was very strong, but nothing was overpowering. It was hard to put down and simply ""sip"".",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,96
147,1160,johnmichael712,4.78,"Appearance: Poured out of a 12 oz. bottle into a nonic glass. Bottle lists this beer as the spring 2008 release, making this bad boy just about one year old. This beer pours the darkest of blacks with a gorgeous dark brown head that is about two fingers in size. The head is soft and pillowy, and looks to be very sticky, which it is. A small amount of lace clings to my glass as I drink.  Smell: The nose of this beer is intensely aromatic, and is dominated by aromas of dark bittersweet chocolate, roasted black and chocolate malts, and coffee. There are also hints of licorice, blackstrap molasses, and a little bit of alcohol. I'm not sure if there isn't much hop presence in the nose because this beer is a year old or because Stone designed the beer that way, but at 90+ IBU's I have a feeling they'll be showing up in the taste even though they forgot to come to this particular party.  Taste: After the first sip all I can say is ""wow"", and it's going to take me a while to try and put this much complexity and flavor into words, but I'm going to give it the old college try. This beer starts off very sweet with an absolutely phenomenal amount of chocolate and malt flavor. As in the aroma there are hints of molasses and coffee, but they've given most of their elbow room to the chocolate and dark roasted malts. The beer remains sweet throughout this interplay of flavors, and finishes with a strong hop presence and a good amount of alcohol taste. The finish is also fairly dry, but not cloying, and makes for one hell of a delicious beer.  Mouthfeel: It's rare to find a beer that really achieves the mouthfeel I desire, but Stone Imperial Russian Stout has managed to do so. A heavenly smooth and luxurious brew, this beer also has an exceptionally full-body and a chewy, malty feel on the tongue. There is little to no carbonation to speak of. This is definitely one of the thickest stouts I've ever had, and only North Coast's Old Rasputin Russian Imperial Stout comes to mind as being thicker.  Drinkability: This is definitely a sipper if there ever were one. Despite how delicious it is and how thick and smooth, the 10.8% alcohol could make for some pretty bad decisions down the road if one isn't careful.  Notes: Overall I was superbly impressed with this beer, and I'd love to pick up a few of them fresh to see how they compare to this year-old example. I'm assuming that, considering my tastes run less toward the hoppy end of the spectrum, I won't appreciate them as much as I did this beer, but I'm sure it will be delicious nonetheless. Stone's Imperial Russian Stout is an exceptional stout and an exceptional beer, and is one of the finest brews that money can buy. It's a bit hoppier than other stouts on the market, but if you're a hophead looking for a good stout, this beer may just be the love of your life.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,96

147,1160,kaseydad,4.37,"Why is there no picture for this beer? The bottle alone is frickin awesome! I was very happy to see Stone is now packaging this great brew in 12 oz. instead of bombers. Be sure to let this brew warm up before partaking.  It pours a dark chocolate brown with a nice small coffee-like head.  The aroma is coffee, chocolate, black licorice and nice roasted malts.  The taste is like a finely blended coffee which hits the palate after the swallow. There is also a tobacco-like aroma which lingers. Very nice.  As I stated before, I am glad this is in 12 oz. as a bomber pretty much puts me out of commission for the night.

Touch of bitter chocolate and vanilla as well. Tons of malts and bitter coffee/chocolate. Hoppy and coffee aftertaste balances the start very well. Warm but not hot. Dark fruit notes are present. Thick and well carbonated. Drinkability is not high because it's not very kind to the palate and high abv... But man is it good.  Overall: Stains the glass a bit and reminds me a bit of dark lord.

Taste: extremely well-balanced taste here- mild bitterness at first taste, a tide of roasted chocolate/coffee as well as raisin) then predominates and expands throughout the tasting. A moderate alcohol warmth then finishes. Finish itself is clean but not too dry or bitter. Overall taste is smooth and balanced without any sort of bombastic flavor profiles.

147,1160,bowersdm,3.71,"12oz bottle from the March 2008 release poured into a nonic. I had previously tried this beer in October '08 and found it to be mediocre at best. I have been advised that Stone IRS like Bell's Expedition Stout is fair when fresh, but phenomenal when aged around one year. Here goes nothing.  A - jet black with 0.25cm of light brown head. a mere one minute of setting in the glass waiting for it to warm leaves no remaining head.  S - roasted barley and charred barley, anise/licorice, tobacco. nothing else.  T - roasted malts, anise/licorice and a piney hop flavor rush by ever so quickly. The finish is of dark chocolate, alcohol, and more anise/licorice. a nice smokey flavor that comes from either charred barley or tobacco seems to be present, especially in the finish. The dark chocolate and the roasted malt come together to create a nice mocha like flavor. The alcohol definitely noticeable and not at all well hidden, but it isn't offensive in any way. Molasses began to come through as the beer warms.  M - okay body. it would be very good for a stout, but it's only average for an imperial stout. carbonation is adequate, but the beer lacks that chewiness or thick feel that makes so many good RISs even better.  D - it's pretty good. I've had quite a few RISs and I truly feel that this one doesn't deserve a place in the top 20.  I still don't see what it is with this beer.

A: Pours black black with a 1.5 finger white head that quickly fades into nothing. Little if any lacing.  S: Rich and roasty, like opening a fresh coffee can. A little bit of soy sauce in the background. Becomes more chcolatey as it warms up.  T: As I begin, it's almost too complex for me to wrap my head around. After my palate adjusts, it settles into a nice chocolatey groove with hints of coffee and licorice. Finishes bitter.  M: Surprisingly thin and watery.  D: This is one of those beers that I'd never been able to ""get."" Every time I'd gotten this beer, I felt like it was a chore to force it down. I even did a drain pour one time. I didn't understand how I could find a beer so highly regarded so unappealing, so I kept coming back. This time around, I decided to let it warm up on the counter for a lot longer than I usually do (specifically, 45 minutes) to see if that opened up the flavors. It worked like a charm.

Coffee is present, roast chicory and chocolate notes dominate. A hint of medicinal anise. A bit warm, alcohol-wise ... and judging from their Web site, this is last year's bottling, so it's had time to mellow.  It could be just a bit heavier in the mouth. Still, it lingers a bit then slides down slick. Beer is swallowed but the flavor lingers.  I find RISes drinkable as heck in general, and this one is no exception.

T- Heavy malt, Fudy sweet center similar to a suprise candy in a box from a lover. This beer leaves you with the sense that a real licorice stick was swirled in chocolate and held over a sugar fire.  M- Great feel. Cosistantly full but not too thick. Good balance with carbonation.  D- This is my go to stout, hence the avatar. Its availability year round plus the price is outstanding. I love sharing this prize with new beer drinkers. Their eyes get all gooey and the deep breath that follows lets me know ""they get it!""

Appearance: Pours almost black with a dark brown ¾"" head of small bubbles which recede in a couple of minutes leaving behind a film of lacing a bit above the liquid with patches of foam extending on the surface of the liquid.  Smell: The initial aroma fills the room and is composed of dark chocolate and/or roasted dark malt or burnt grain with a trace of alcohol. As the beer warms to room temperature the aroma becomes more complex with traces of dark fruit, maple syrup and dark molasses.  Taste: While still chilled there is a rich strong burnt malt bitterness up front that dominates everything. As the beer warms the flavor opens up to reveal the underlying sweetness of dark chocolate, molasses, caramel and some sort of fruitiness. If there are hops left in here they play a their bit part well and are not noticeable as such.  Mouthfeel: A bit thick but smooth with very light carbonation and a long finish which fades slowly from burnt bitterness leaving behind the taste of semi-sweet malt bitterness.  Drinkability: If you like RIS, this is drinkability exemplified. Made for slow sipping and savoring.

Perhaps he is sneering at my unworthiness, but the joke's on him... the beer he's guarding is going into my glass whether he thinks I deserve it or not!  Of course 'my glass' is of the Stone shaker pint variety, and is also adorned with the fearsome winged figure...  Fruity malt perfume laden with chocolate and licorice hisses forth as I pop the crown off the bottle. Poured into the aforementioned gargoyle-clad vessel, Stone IRS is matte-ebony in color with a finger-thick cap of light brown sugar-colored foam atop. Not even when held directly to the light does any other color twinkle on the edge of the inky blackness in my glass. Lacing is left on the tumbler in fine-bubbled, wispy webs.  The aroma is rich and chocolatey with lots of perfumey fruit and liquory candies. Fermenting berries with notes of toasted granola and coffee tumble with burnt caramel, vanilla, dark raisins, licorice and toffee.  The taste is rich and wonderful, the profile jam-packed with a perfect melange of melted milk chocolate bars and dark chocolate truffles, with liquefied homemade fudge brownies, coffee with whole milk and raw sugar, creamy vanilla caramel, silky toffee juice... each wonderful mouthful brings forth a new flavor sensation. As the drink progresses, notes of dusty cocoa and spicy licorice accent a bit of peppery alcohol that warms the belly, loosens the tongue, and complements the rest of the drink just perfectly.  The brew is Michaelangelo-chiseled perfection in feel with mild carbonation and a full, solid, creamy body. I really can't think of any way that Stone could possibly improve the quality of this beer, outside of making it available from my kitchen faucet, and somehow keeping the monster-sized ABV from kicking my ass....  Otherwise, kids, believe the hype. Stone Imperial Russian Stout is unbelievably excellent, and is now my new personal benchmark for the style. The 12-ounce bottle is a perfect serving size for it, too.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,96
147,1160,Frosty80,4.52,"Color: sits black with a little dark brown rim  Smell: TONS of chocolate. smells like its loaded with cocoa powder. usually it seems imperials are dominated by coffee, but it definitely takes a back seat here. a hint of alcohol is noted but really only on a deep inhale.  Taste: first, there is chocolate. then there is the alcohol. somewhere in between is some coffee and some bitterness. alcohol mostly comes though in the finish. little bit of bitterness and roast also in the finish.  Mouthfeel: full body. low carbonation. smooth  Notes: absolutely delicious. a bit more tame than comparable imperials because of so much chocolate. i guess i kinda like a slightly more present alcohol tone. but damn, this is delicious. might still be a little cool. we'll see as it warms",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,96
147,1160,Rayek,4.32,"From a spring 2008 bottle.  A: Pitch black with a deep tan cap that starts out huge. Head retention is above average and patches of lace are left behind.  S: Pine forest meets licorice plant. A nice balance of dark sugars and woodsy hops.  T: Very complex. Malt is dominated by flavors of molasses, licorice and a touch of baker's chocolate. Bitterness is strong, but not over the top with its powerful pine bite. The entire flavor lingers through the finish.  M: Medium-heavy body is syrupy and slick. Carbonation is a touch on the high side.  D: A very nicely balanced RIS. Bold taste isn't dominated by any particular flavor, which is nice. Definitely worth a revisit.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,96
147,1160,OtherShoe2,4.22,"Poured from a 12 oz. bottle a deep brown/black with a half-finger tan thick head. Some lacing, but not much.  First whiff gave me deep roasted grain, a hint of vanilla (that I couldn't find again as I got thru the pint - ?), coffee, and either a cane syrup or blackstrap molasses scent.  Great flavors here. French-roast coffee and dark chocolate are first and are immediately pushed out of the way by the alcohol. Next is some sweetness akin to molasses, and a bitterness from some hops. Great balance and layering here.  Full bodied, but not cloying -- the alcohol is a bit astringent and clears the palate well.  Overall, really surprised at the drinkability of this one. Imperials are usually real sippers for me, but I found myself drinking this one faster than I thought I would. I also think that because I found it in a 12 oz. bottle, I wasn't ready to be done with it due to sheer consumptive volume. Really great.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,96
147,1160,colts9016,4.5,"Thanks to traquairlover for this bottle.  Pour into a pint glass at 54 degree.  Appearance: A deep dark brown color with a one finger head. The head is dark tan color with a rock solid head. The clarity of the beer is opaque, no light is going to get through.  Nose: A rich roasted dark grain with chocolate, coffee, and molasses. There is a nice hoppy aroma with a subtle floral aroma. In the background of the beer there is a burnt character that is like a hint, also with some caramel and toffee.  Taste: A deep rich complex heavy grain bill. There is a beautifully roasted dark grain with a slight burnt character. In the beer there is coffee, chocolate, and molasses. In the back ground of the the hops is there but it is subtle floral aroma, also with caramel and toffee.  Overall: The mouth feel is full body rich and complex beer with some creaminess. The finish is full and lasting. This beer is huge with a good amount of hops note. This beer is really good. I would like a few more bottles, but unlikely.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,96
147,1160,sonicdescent,4.11,"Pours a black with a head thicker than most an some highlights around the edges. Looks viscous.  Scent of dark fruits over the typical ris scents of chocolate and toffee. Not much booze or roasted malt present.  Taste is rather creamy with chocolate swooping in, then being taken over by roasted malt. There it is! The fruits from the scents are present but muted. Complex, but not to the level of a Dark Lord. Very good.  Feel is rather thick and near flat. Nice!  Finally another one that is good and relatively easy to come by.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,96
147,1160,mjryan,3.58,"Very, dark with a thin tan head. Faint aroma of chocalte and charred malts. The aroma intensifies as the beer warms. Smooth chocolate flavour followed by mellow coffee notes, slightly sweet in the middle but dries out in the finish. Hop flavour and aroma are minimal, and the hop bitterness is very mellow but does still manage to provide balance. Lower carbonation and huge malts contribute to a rediculously smooth body. The 10.8%ABV is well hidden. Not my favorite imp stout, but very good none the less.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,96
147,1160,superdedooperboy,4.28,"12 oz. bottle of ""Limited Release Spring 2008"" poured into a snifter glass.  As black as old engine oil, this beer gives off a creamy cinnamon-toned head that settles somewhat quickly and leaves behind nice rings of cling on the walls of the glass.  Aroma is mostly roasty, with some bitter chocolate playing in front of a hazy backdrop of hop notes.  Thick and full-bodied, with a smooth mouthfeel and a light tingle of carbonation. Roasted malts open up for a surprising (though perhaps not surprising considering the brewery) onslaught of bitter hop notes combined with coffee and dark chocolate, fading away into a lingering bitter, dry finish.  A very West Coast interpretation of a Russian imperial stout, with a bitter dryness that makes it go down quickly, but coming in at over 10% ABV, it's best to tame it and sip rather than quaff.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,96
147,1160,Calicoast,5,"On tap at Beechwood / Seal Beach. 2007 Stone RIS Vertical. (3) glasses, no alcohol burn, smooth as a blonde with double d’s, and an ass that tastes like French Vanilla Ice Cream. Age does this one well.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,96
147,1160,NCSUdo,3.88,"12 oz bottle  A: Pitch black body under a small dark brown head. Some spotty lace, no retention.  S: Roasted malt, chocolate, maybe some dark fruit and some nuttiness. A bit lacking for me in the aroma department.  T: Coffee, chocolate, roasted malt, espresso, hint of a sweet cream, pretty big bitter finish, all accompanied by booze.  M/D: Full bodied and smooth. Carbonation is light and alcohol very apparent as already mentioned. Drinkability is good for such a large beer. A preferred sipper, but something that could be had in a decent quantity, at least until the alcohol catches up to you.  Good all around beer, but a little lacking in some areas and, at times, a bit overwhelming in the taste department. I think this one could stand some time. I'll revisit this review upon diving into my 07 version some time in the future.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,96
147,1160,vacax,4.48,"A: Pours gloppy and jet black with a very nice thick mocha head. Exceptional lacing.  S: Bready, roasted and somewhat spirit like with a chocolate and dark fruit backdrop.  T: For me this is the style-defining Russian Imperial Stout. Heavily roasted malt flavors balance with bitter chocolate essences. Some alcohol burn at 10.8% but quite smooth (early 2008 bottle here). Fresh this beer has more alcohol and chocolate, but this is also amazing aged as the alcohol smooths out and dark fruit flavors come to light. A great beer, I count this as probably the best without getting into rare ""one day a year"" or barrel aged releases.  M: Heavy body with moderate carbonation. Smooth and thick.  D: Such a great beer, I can easily drink bombers of this stuff (though 12 oz. bottles are now available). Great balance in this one. One of (if not the only) few imperial stouts I can actually purchase regularly and truly savor. The best imperial stout on the market that is not impossible to get.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,96
147,1160,blaje,4.17,"Spring 2008 release and opened Feb 2009. almost a year old. Served @ 10 oC. Pours as a dark black translucid liquid and formed a medium head, mocha in color. Unfortunatly not lasting long enough, disapeared in about two minutes leaving a small lacing aroud the glass. First impression: not as thick and heavy as I was expecting. Nose is revealing anise and rosted coffee. Fruit smell is present, certainly due to high alcohol content. Mouthfeel is very plesant. It is surprisingly sharp for an Imperial Stout. Very nice bitterness that tempers down the heavy side of the stout type of beer An impressive stout, very well balanced.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,96
147,1160,TequilaSauer,4.58,"Pitch black with a surprising amount of head and lacing.  Smells of dark chocolate, hazelnut, and roasted malts. Very pleasant aromas, but they do nothing to hint at the flavor that awaits.  The taste is incredible. Fantastic balance. The entire experience of drinking this beer is thoroughly enjoyable. Attacks with heavy chocolate with gives way to a roasted, malty coffee flavor. Again, there is more carbonation than expected. On the finish, the chocolate is gone, but a heavy, slightly smoky, coffee flavor with remains. A very tasty stout, indeed!  Not the most drinkable stout in the world, but there's very little alcohol hint given the ABV, and that flavor will leave you coming back for more.  If this were more widely available, it would easily run toe-to-toe with Ten Fidy, Expedition, and Rasputin as my go-to stouts.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,96
147,1160,remllof,4.38,"Got my hands on this in eastern NC thanks to my beer store being such a great customer. Pours out jet black, with an amazing thick golden brown head. Leaving behind nice thick lacing. The aroma has hints of coffee, a bit of alcohol just wonderful. The taste has hints of coffee, chocolate, a bit of alcohol, but very little considering how high this brew is. Mouth feel has a nice bit of thickness but not as thick as I thought this would have been.

Also nutty and a hint of raisin.  Toasted malt, dark chocolate, some coffee and alchohol in the taste also.  Smooth and thick feeling. Quite a bit of carbonation on the tongue and down the back of my throat.  Good drinkability. A bit of a sipper due to the strong flavor and alcohol present.

As it warms, dark stone fruit comes through.  T-Chocolate and bitterness from the hops with a nice bit of warming alcohol on the finish. As it warms, definite tastes of dark stone fruit and vanilla come into play.  M-Full and creamy. It feels like a big beer. Bitterness lingers throughout and alcohol can be detected.  D-A great example of the style. A great beer for a nightcap. One to sip and appreciate its nuances as it warms.  I think the saying on the back of the bottle perfectly sums up this beer for me.

147,1160,jjboesen,4.53,"In the 19th Century, trade routes had opened between England and the Baltic States; and, since many porters of the day would not endure the journey, the brewers made their beers especially strong - much like they did with IPAs. The result is this exquisite style of beer (It is called ""Russian"" due to the fact that it was enjoyed by those folks.  Stone's version is a big and toasty concoction that starts out with a giant head of billowy cream-colored foam. It retains sweet aroma of anise combined with chocolate. The palate is greeted with a heavy but smooth malt blast that fades into biscuity warmth.  The mouthfeel is exciting; there is a warm blanket that covers the palate; and yet, despite the alcohol, which is subtle, this one is deceptively smooth at initial sip.  As I mentioned, this beer became very popular in Russia; in fact, the mad monk Grigory Rasputin is said to have particularly enjoyed it - I guess when he wasn't seducing the Czarina.

Left quite a bit of lacing. The head subsided fairly quickly.  Smell: Coffee, milk chocolate, lactose, roasted malts. All the flavors blend together creating a really awesome scent as it warms.  Taste: Roasted malts are the most prevalent flavor, which fade to a nice alcohol bite in the background. Heavy coffee notes, with a nice balance of sweetness to temper it slightly. The roasted/coffee aftertaste lingers for quite some time. As it warms, more chocolate flavors begin to come through. A slight pepper kick in the background.  Mouthfeel: Nicely carbonated, but a little too thin for an Imperial Stout.  Drinkability: A very solid Imperial Stout, one that places more of an emphasis on the roasted notes than others I've had. The alcohol will sneak up on you with this one. A very good beer, but I'm not sure it's worthy of the hype. It's almost too strong of a roasted flavor, and I would have liked to see a little more balance.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,96

However, this shows nothing....it's like liquid molases!  The head is a light brown with a good finger full of appearance. It fallas away and leaves a small ring around the top of the liquid and leave a decent amount of ringing. First appearance though, is brilliant!  Smells like chocolate malt, molases, treacle and then a lightness in the background.  Tastes like it smells and looks. I know that is strange to say, but when you see something this dark, you just know it is going to be a meaty beer. However, this still has a little lightness in it's aftertaste.

Wonderful nose with malty chocolate and, of course, the 10.8% ABV is definitely present, but not overpowering at all.  Ah, the taste, well, well, well, what have we here? Fantastic! All of the previous reviews came very close to my experience. Bitter chocolate, roasted coffee, molasses, with some cherry sneaking in at the end. Wow!  Very good mouthfeel, slight carbonation, which is fine with me. Too many bubbles get in the way!  I think this is definitely an ""end of night"" beer to be savored. One of the best of the style, to be sure.  This is my second tasting of this RIS, the first was last Monday night upon arriving home from my first Kate the Great tasting at the brewery in Portsmouth.

Smells of expresso, roastiness, and burnt chocolate. Taste is absolutely phenomenal, unforgettable. First thing you notice is the fact that its so tightly concentrated that it almost burns initially (I'm sure that the 10% abv also has something to do with that!), and then opens into sweeter, chocolatey, burnt sugar notes before finishing with dark cocoa bar and roasty bitterness. We've all tasted these flavors in other stouts and porters, but few other beers can approach the sheer concentration of these elements that Stone somehow achieves.

S: Smell is rich of coffee, currants, dark chocolate, raisins with hints of vanilla and alcohol.  T: Rich and very sweet with coffee and currants with a flavor that lingers for hours after your done drinking it. The flavor is also heavy on the alcohol but is balanced with the sweetness of the brew.  M: Thick and syrupy. It would be hard to drink more than a pint of the stuff, as I'm sure it would be very filling.  D: I prefer my Russian Stouts to the brink of freezing but the flavors are unlocked as the brew approaches 45-55 degrees and it becomes more drinkable. As stated before, it would be hard to drink more than one but I really want to!  Brutal and simply amazing, its like a swift kick in the mouth with a steel-toe boot; the flavor is just intense and overwhelming and simply extraordinary.

147,1160,OlieIPA,4.5,"Enjoyed the vertical tasting of Stone 05', 07', 08', and 08' RIS cask at Beachwood BBQ with my good buddy Pehlman.  2005 Edition  A: A black liquid that consisted of a nice one-finger tan head with lacing that clung to the glass throughout the whole beer. Very little evidence of carbonation.  S: Strong cocoa and chocolate characteristics mixed in with cherry and fig fruits; reminded me of a very mild Dark Lord aroma.  T: Can you say Abyss? The little brother to the Deshuetes classic. It gives off several flavors including chocolate, cocoa, roasted coffee, licorice, figs, cherry, caramel, and a very subtle alcohol presence up front as well. The sweetness flavor almost comes off as being a bourbon, which is funny...since this beer is not aged in bourbon or brandy barrels.  M: A little chalky. Full-body with gentle carbonation and a lingering cocoa/roasty taste on the palate.  D: Alcohol was hidden very well and the flavor was deep and rich. This makes for a deadly combination.  2007 Edition  A: Similar to the 05' version , but appeared to have more carbonation. Lacing was decent.  S: Flavor consisted of a more robust dark chocolate than any of the other aromas that were present in the 05' version, along with a strong alcohol bit.  T: Roasted malts, chocolate, and dark fruits. Alcohol was present as well.  M: Full-body with light carbonation. Thinner than what I expected.  D: Alcohol sensation is very apparent, but flavor keeps you intrigued. Yummy!  2008 Edition  A: Same as 07' version (refer to previous edition)  S: Refer to 07' version.  T: A milder and smoother version of the 07' edition, but not as complex in flavor profile as the 05' Stone RIS.  M: Full-body and medium carbonation.  D: Awesome!  08' Cask  A; The most frothy looking head out of all four tasters, this beer consisted of a 1 to 2 finger head that included spider-web lacing along the surface of the my glass.  S: Subtle amounts of chocolate and cocoa flavor mixed in with a slight vanilla extract.  T: Very airy and rubbery (in a good way thought, lol)...almost reminded me of a very strong dry stout, but with more flavor. Roasty, chocolate, and caramel. Alcohol was extremely well hidden.  M: Light and almost no presence of carbonation.  D: WOW!  Overall: Out of all the tastings, the 05' edition was the best by far...which leads me to believe that aging this beer only increases its flavor profile. A top 10 beer which deserves the ""world class"" status that it has on BA. Very similar to the Abyss, along with hints of Dark Lord make this beer a must have by all beer lovers. WOW! Cheers!  P.S. Cellar this beer!!!!",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,96
147,1160,ThirdLap,4.7,"While Sierra Nevada Pale Ale gets the credit for turning me on to craft beer, Stone Imperial Russian Stout was the proverbial straw that broke camel's back. There was no looking back after that first sip.  This '08 bottle pours a near opaque black with a short-lasting chunky tan head. After dissipating completely, a slight ring remains. Agitation results in a gorgeous frothy return. Lacing is minimal.  My nose is filled with roasted malt, dark chocolate, vanilla, molasses, and a touch of soy. I've noticed a bit more in this year's batch, but nothing that takes away from the overall experience. This bottle is almost a year old now, and the alcohol seems as though it might be mellowing out at bit.  Taste is dark fruits, chocolate, and an oaky, candied sweetness. Alcohol is well-hidden, with only a slight burn. Hop presence is very well-balanced. Swallowing produces a strong coffee (almost espresso-like) taste in the mouth. Slight medicinal characteristics.  Mouthfeel is creamy and tangy, full-bodied, with only the need for a touch more carbonation. There's a bitter finish that coats the mouth just right after each sip.  Drinkability is a standout for the style. I could drink these everyday, and a bomber disappears far too fast.  While this may end up not being my highest-scoring RIS, it is arguably my favorite. A fantastic beer.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,96
147,1160,SykDoc,4.38,"Poured from a bottle into a flute. This pours a deep brown motor oil that is opaque when held to the light. The 1/2 inch tan-colored head is short lived and leaves a nice lacing around the edges.  The aroma was a bit unusual to me. You can pick up bourbon and oak notes, but also brown sugar and banana. Mix this is a dark chocolate and coffee mix and it is unique.  The taste is a nice blend of chocolate and coffee. There are also notes of tobacco and brown sugar. The is a very mild hoppy background.  The mouthfeel is fairly heavy bodied with a high level of carbonation, which blends nicely with the flavor. It leaves a very crisp finish, which is unusual mixed with a creamy sticky beer.  Overall, this is a great beer for the style and it is quite drinkable. I will continue to monitor for its availability and get it when possible.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,96
147,1160,n811,3.34,"Spring 2008 version.  Poured into an imperial pint glass, revealing a small head despite an aggressive pour which dissipated almost immediately.  This brew has a great smell - dark roasted grains, coffee, and hints of licorice.  Taste was less than stellar. The alcohol is not very well masked, with a slightly astringent flavor. A bit of a disappointment.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,96
147,1160,Monkeyknife,4.2,"Poured from the bottle a dark brown-almost black with two fingers of rich mocha head which leaves a beautiful curtain of lacing around the glass.  Aroma of roasted malts, coffee, caramel, toffee, dark chocolate, vanilla, nuts, and a whiff of booze.  The taste is big and bright. Roasted malts, espresso, dark chocolate, vanilla, dark red fruits, charcoal, and rye bread. The almost-11% alcohol is much more subtle than expected.  Medium-to-full bodied, smooth and creamy, with a moderate carbonation.  A RIS that is tough to beat and very drinkable for such a big beer.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,96
147,1160,jobcrackerbah,5,"06 on tap at the brewery. The beer that revitalized my desire to drink beer. I was considering going on a long term beer break until I went to the brewery and had this world class beer. I had the 08 spring version out of a bottle and it was not half as good. This masterpiece was meant for cellaring. The oaked arrogant bastard was amazing, but this blew me away. Revels in the darkest shade of black. The aromas can't be contained. The flavors are so complex I can't begin to identify them. The basic ones I taste are velvety chocolate, coffee, and fruity notes. The 10.8 has to be a misprint since I'm pretty sure I ordered a beer and not a heavenly chocolate shake. There's a thick, endless stickiness that coats the mouth. Thank you stone for making me a believer.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,96
147,1160,br3wmeister,4.07,"A- One inch brown head with pretty good head retention and good lacing. Black beer that lets no light through.  S- Nice toasted barley, dark chocolate and some sweet molasses. Hints of dark fruit and some alcohol. Some fruit bread aromas, and hints of vanilla.  T- Dark chocolate and toasted whole wheat bread. Some sweet molasses and charcoal. Plum and other dark fruits with an alcohol bite.  M- Medium to full bodied not as thick as other RIS's I have tired. Good carbonation but a little too much alcohol bite.  Overall- A good imperial stout lots of good flavor but too much of an alcohol presence.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,96
147,1160,htomsirveaux,3.95,"22 oz. bottle tried 21 Oct 2008.  Poured in a 0.4 L snifter. Small dark brown creamy head. Opaque dark chocolate color, almost black. Aroma is very roasty, lots of chocolate, coffee, ethanol. Flavor starts with burnt caramel, bittersweet chocolate, dark cocoa. Also raisins, clove and anise. Finish and aftertaste is of espresso and licorice. Ethanol is very warming and strong. Heavy body, good coating mouthfeel.  A good nightcap for a fall evening.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,96

147,1160,DavoleBomb,3.58,"Poured into a snifter, 2008 edition.  4.0 A: Opaque deep purple/black color. Thick head with less than average retention. Tons of lacing.  3.5 S: Coffee and molasses. Nose is too weak for my liking except for burnt sensations.  3.5 T: It's pretty good, but it isn't great and certainly no where near as good as most of BAs think. Dark chocolate stands out the most, there's also some roasted coffee. Next is dark fruits and caramel. The balance is out of whack as the beer is too sweet. Lastly, there is a significant solvent-like flavor mixed in and the alcohol is very noticeable.  4.0 M: Full bodied. Good and creamy with mid-range carbonation.  3.5 D: One is certainly enough because it simply isn't that good.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,96
147,1160,raoulduke37,4.75,"Before this, I had only ever had the Arrogant Bastard from Stone, and that one wasn't what I consider to be ""world class."" This beer, however, may just qualify for that. I was amazed to get such an amazing taste and mouthfeel from a bottled stout. Many times, stouts are best suited to be poured only from the tap (like Guinness). The appearance is a beautiful black with red highlights around the rim of the glass. Beautiful brown head does not stick around, however. Taste and mouthfeel are freaking heavenly. Taste of prunes, pork fat (no joke), initially, and then chocolate all the way down. God damn it's a beauty. I can see why this is on so many want lists. I feel extremely lucky to have this readily available in CA. This is one I would stand for in the face of opposition.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,96

147,1160,CpnYates,3.74,"I guess I had read to many reviews before opening this beer, because my expectations were waay over the top for this thing.  It's not that this is a bad beer, or even an average beer. This is a GREAT stout. I get Old Rasputin a lot locally but this Stone is much harder to find. The problem is, I was expecting world class and it just wasn't there. There is coffee, malt, brown sugar, chocolate. Its just not the overpowering nose present I was expecting.  The taste is good, not great with much of the smell being tasted in direct proportioned amounts. There is more alcohol on the initial sip than excpected.  The mouth feel is where this beer really shines. Outstanding subtle carbonation blends with the sticky sweet resin that coats the mouth. You taste this beer for thirty seconds after your last sip.  Overall I enjoyed this beer. But I didn't LOVE it, as I expected to after reading the reviews. The others are going into the basement to mellow a while.  BTW this was the Spring 08 version.  The beer looked great when I poured it but my first hint that this wasn't going to live up to the hype was in the nose.  Still thouroughly enjoyable.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,96

T-Is a shot of alcohol, dark roasted malt and some bitterness.  M-Medium and lightly carbonated.  D-Is nicely drinkable even with the noticeable and high alcohol. I think I would prefer an aged bottle that mellows the alcohol.  Of course this is a good stout but would like less alcohol.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,96
147,1160,Lunchmade,4.52,"I brought home a growler of this amazing imperial stout and now wonder where it has gone. A modern confectionery treat. Smells extraordinary with deep roasted chocolaty hues.

Darth Vader ninja black oil color - very thick motor oil consistency. I held it up to the setting sun and still could not see through it.  S - Burnt chocolate coffee smell.  T - Creamy chocolate taste, strong alcohol finish, the aftertaste is a bit bitter and numbing. Good flavor that gets better as you sip it. The bitterness strikes you at the same moment as the alcohol which helps to mask it. The strength of the alcohol is the slightest bit too strong, but other than that, this is a very good beer and I am definitely aging this.

147,1160,sweetbrew82,4.53,"22 oz. bottle into a snifter/ no freshness date  P: Pours syrupy black from the bottle, and sits a light-obliterating opaque black in the glass. 2 fingered, dark chocolatey brown head is thick and creamy. Disappeared pretty quickly to form a halo with a thin film in the middle.  A: Huge wave of roasted malts, chocolate (cacao powder?), coffee, currants, and some alcohol.  T: Starts sweet with deep, roasty flavors of chocolate, coffee and molasses. But, it's nicely reinforced with some bittering hops that take the edge off the sweetness. The currants seem to show up later, along with some slick dark fruits on the back end. Alcohol is very well-hidden for 10.8%, and does a good job of warming the chest. Finishes slick, not dry and leaves a puddle of resin behind for a great aftertaste.  M & D: Somehow, saying its full-bodied just don't cut it. It's incredibly thick, rich, creamy, syrupy yet chewy. Pure decadence! I'm not sure I could drink more than two, but this one went down so quick that I thought someone was siphoning off my glass.  Notes: What else can I say. It's simply incredible! So thick and rich with such delicious flavors abound. One of the best RIS out there, without a doubt. A perfect example of why this is my favorite style of beer. Highly recommended",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,96
147,1160,damienblack,4.38,"Pours jet-black, thick and syrupy, with a big, frothy tan head. Great retention and excellent lacing, this appears to be a very healthily carbonated beer. Bubbles erupt on the surface like little lava pockets, or like a bog. Smells a little yeasty, a little burnt, and a little bit of hops, all rolled into one. A little subdued, but interesting nevertheless.  First impression: With Stone, I was expecting a super-hopped imperial stout, and this is nothing of the sort. Dark roast malt that comes over as nice and sweet, without any real harsh burnt sensation (like charcoal that you get from some). The roastiness just lingers on the palate long after the beer is gone. Touches of coffee and chocolate, without either one particularly dominating. Something slinky lurks in the background, like a vanilla or sweet spice. Just enough hops for balance/cleansing, nothing more. Fantastic. Nice big body, very rich, if not super creamy, filling and cloying in a good way, yet slick and oily at the same time. Hides the alcohol super well, no burn, or even a hint of alcohol that high. Fantastic stout from a brewery that I'm not the biggest fan of, since I don't really care for super hoppy beers. This is sure to please all.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,96

S - Lots of roasted malt... Baker's chocolate... Licorice... Rye... Crust...  T - An attention grabber... True to the nose the roasted malt, chocolate, and licorice dominate the palette... Perhaps a hint of raisins work their way into the mix as well... The alcohol is also hard to miss...  M - The warmth of the alcohol fills the mouth... Not as creamy or rich as expected...

Aroma and flavor is rich malts, ripened fermented fruits, light licorice, smoke & coffee. Flavor also has hints of molasses and bitter hops. I have been wanting to try this one for a long time now and it sure was worth the wait. Awesome beer.  1-21-09 Just cracked another 2007 and it is drinking very nice right now.

147,1160,hoppheadIPA,4.47,"WOW, finally, what a beer. I've been waiting to try this on for awhile now. Pours a deep dark brown, almost black with light brown colored head that dissapates rather quickly. Hits the nose with roasted malt and coffee tones with some chocolate sweetness in the backround. What a delicous beer. Tastes of perfectly blended roasted malt, coffee, light chocolate, with a slight alcohol backround. Very well balanced. Being such a big beer, it's surprisingly drinkable.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,96

Great tasting stout. Some chocolate and licorice flavors as well as subtly roasted malts. There is a coffee-like bitterness on the back of the palate.  The mouthfeel is nice and thick. This is a very full-bodied beer.  For a big beer, this is very drinkable. A great sipper.  I have been underwhelmed by some Stone beers in the past, but this one is really noteworthy. Good, good stuff. I would not put it in the class of the Abyss, but not far off either. Pick some up if you see it.

147,1160,spmags,4.39,"Poured this into a pint glass and even during the pour it was almost completely opaque. As dark a stout as I have ever seen. The bottle says ""pours like Siberian crude"" but you have to see it to believe it. Modest head that quickly dissipates leaving some lacing.  Didn't get much in the nose...mostly alcohol, though it was my second Impy on the night so that may have played a role in some loss of sensation.  I tend to idealize the mouthfeel of the cream/sweet stouts, so I really liked this one. Much more creamy/viscous than the Oak Aged Yeti, but with a similar full body.  The first thing I noted was that it was sweet hoppiness, not because it was the most prominent flavor, but because I am not used to tasting that in this style. However, the creamy chocolate taste underscored by warmth of alcohol are possibly the most dominant flavors. If you like stouts with that hit you in the face with roasted to burnt bitterness, you might want to look elsewhere. This really downplays those but you can get some of that in the finish.  Very drinkable for a brew with ~10%ABV.  To date it is probably my favorite beer.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,96

The taste is well balanced with elements of chocolate, roasted malts and prunes.  Mouthfeel is complete, complex and very smooth, the sensation is that of draping dark velvet curtains across your mouth.

Recommends cellaring at 55, specifically getting a case and sampling every 3-6 months. Best by 01.01.2013. Listed as Bottle Konditioned, why the K?  Appearance: Pours with 1/2 finger of dark tan head. This settles quickly to just a ring around the glass and some errant foam on the surface of the beer. The beer itself is dark, dark brown, essentially black. As a fellow BA said, ""So dark it sucks light bulbs out of their sockets."" A small amount of sediment remains in the bottle.  Smell: Roasted barley bitterness with definite alcohol sweetness hidden just beneath. Hints of toffee and black licorice.  Taste: Sharp mix of hop and barley bitterness up front, with a creamy chocolate and lactose flavor in the finish. Hints of oak and bourbon. Sweet alcohol flavor underscores it all.  Mouthfeel: Lower than average carbonation level. Body is excellent.  Drinkability: A great sipper now, and I imagine an even better one int he future.

147,1160,Mazeraski,4.3,"A 22 oz. bomber with ""Limited Spring 2008 Release"" written on it poured into a Middle Ages imperial pint.  A - Pours a complete jet black color with a thick, frothy dark tan head that dissipates rather slowly, leaving a slight sticky lacing clinging to the glass.  S - Hits the nose with large roasted malt and coffee notes accompanied by hints of chocolate, caramel, vanilla and a tad bit of cinnamon.  T - An incredible combination of big roasted malt, oaky vanilla, dark chocolate, dark roasted coffee, molasses and a slight twinge from the combo of what little hops are present and the alcohol, leaving the brew with a warming, roasted thickness on the palate after the sip. The roasted malt, chocolate and coffee aspects become more pronounced as it warms (along with the oaky character).  MF - Full-bodied with a bit of a lower amount of carbonation. Amazingly smooth, creamy and chewy all at the same time.  D - Very drinkable taste-wise, although it suffers a bit from how filling it is as well as the higher ABV.  Notes - An amazing beer that I was skeptical of due to all of the hype. However, despite this I would say that it is hands down one of the best RIS's I have had the pleasure of sampling. Incredibly smooth and creamy with a spectrum of flavors on display that would make anyone who brews an RIS jealous. Absolutely excellent.

S: Roasted coffee with a hint of chocolate and cherries.  T: Notes of espresso and dark chocolate, with an almost imperceptible alcohol burn. The burn gets more pronounced as the beer warms, but this is quite pleasant on a cold winter day.  M: Silky smooth, with a bit of an alcohol burn  D: I'm surprised this is above 10%. It hides the alcohol pretty well. Considering that it's a pretty big beer, it goes down quite smoothly.  I'd been meaning to give this one another shot, and I'm glad I did.

Some sweetness (anise) in the aromas as well no alcohol present in this at all.  Flavors start of sweet chocolate and finish with a coffee hoppy bitter. Let me say that that is the most blunt way to put the flavors in words .this is a complex brew and very good at that. This stout has a big thick and heavy feel; I will be sipping this thing.

S - Strong hits of chocolate and cocoa in the aroma, almost like a chocolate chip cookie. There is also a bit of sweet and burnt malt and vanilla coming through. Maybe some black licorice?  T - This beer had a nice balance between chocolate and coffee. Semi-sweet chocolate at first, with a black licorice. There are very dark chocolate and coffee/burnt malts and extremely subtle hops on the finish. Leaves a lingering taste that reminds me of pistachio nuts covered in chocolate, interesting.  M - nice and full, but a bit too carbonated for my liking. I am impressed that the alcohol is so well hidden in this beer.  D - Due to the high abv, it is hard to drink anything after a bomber of this. I really enjoyed this and wish I could get this in Missouri. Oh well, it leaves something to desire when I travel.

I have been milking this one for the past 90 minutes letting it warm to see how the flavors change. The pour resulted in a pitch black color brew with a limited but steady darker brown head that left nice lacing. The aroma is magnificent as the black roasted/burnt malt give off a intoxicating aroma of chocolate, dark fruit (raisin, dates) molasses and brown, slightly burnt sugar. Extremely inviting mixture along with a faint but present Alcohol smell. The flavor is very good, lots of burnt/roasted malts (not overly astringent) gives a thick but slick feel. Coffee, chocolate, dark berries come to mind. As it warms the flavors seem to come out even more, if that is possible mixed with a warming taste of alcohol with is fantastic.

147,1160,xxthepatientxx,4.53,"OK. So, as an early birthday treat to myself this year, I went and bought a growler of 2004 Vintage as part of Stone's Black Sundays event. I've had a few of these fresh before - the 07 and 08 - and they were always prime, but totally knocked the hell out of my palate. I can now say that age treats this beer extremely well. It's much smoother and the flavors more blended and complimentary. As delicious as ever (I say more so), but much less jarring.  A - Poured into a large wine glass. Deep, rich brown that blackens as the glass fills. Leaves a nice brown head, but not much lacing. Held up to the light...and whole room darkens. Nothing gets through; I'm drinking a black hole.  S - First whiff...is that soy sauce? Not unpleasant, just unexpected. It works, though having only heard horror stories of SA Triple Bock, I pray for the best. That's only the initial impression, thankfully, and as I continue to inhale I get burnt grains and a hint of black licorice.  T & M - I think I hear angels singing. As I said in my preamble, everything just feels so much more rounded out after these 4 or 5 years of aging. It is glorious. First there's a sweetness, slightly molasses-y. Then it rolls thick and smoothly over my tongue, but does so cleanly, without any sticky or oily lingering sensations. Then I taste burnt grains and coffee grounds; delicious and bitter. The finish is a gorgeous blending of all the flavors.  D - Perhaps a bit too drinkable! The fresh releases, I have to power through the second half of a bomber, not because it's bad, but because it is such an overwhelming beer that assaults your taste buds and takes no prisoners. This one though...wow...just goes right on down. 2nd glass? Yes please! And the taste hides the ABV all too well; the only sign of its strength is the warming effect it has on the way down and how much more giddy I feel after half a glass!  All in all, this is still a beast of a beer, but a much more subtle, sneaky, trickster of a beast.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,96
147,1160,Cyberkedi,4.58,"Has a rich, smoky, roast-coffee aroma with a nutty hint and just a touch of molasses. Pours a deep, opaque sable, just a shade this side of black with a thick, fine-bubbled tan head that sticks around. Flavor does not disappoint - thick, smoky, tones of malt and unsweet chocolate, ribbon of hop bitterness, nutty and coffee hints, with a satisfyingly bitter finish. It fairly dances on the tongue and on its way down the pipes.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,96
147,1160,xcephalopodx,4.38,"OK, so this is my first time reviewing a beer on BA, so here goes:  Stone 2005 RIS on tap at the Stone Brewery  Had this on tap at the Stone Brewery last night, and it was my first taste of a cellared RIS. This beer is as black as my heart; no light gets through. Very nice cinnamon colored head, but not much of it.  Smell is complex and, to me, primarily of chocolate and coffee. Because of the age, it does not have a strong alcohol smell, despite being 10.8%. I don't smell licorice or figs or currants, just strong coffee and chocolate.  First taste is of coffee, good strong coffee, then a deep chocolate which gives way to a nice sweetness. Not too heavy or syrupy; very nice. It gives way to a dry and delicious hoppy bitterness.  This is one smooth beer going down. It's thick and heavy, but not syrupy, and makes a great sipping beer. I can't imagine drinking a bomber, but for a half pint it went down real easy. Fun to swish around in your mouth to get all the flavors. Because of the smoothness, it is a very easy beer to drink. Again, I can't imagine drinking a bomber, but a half pint or pint goes down a lot easier than I expected for a beer with so much alcohol.  Good stuff Stone. I'll be back for the Winter Storm for more.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,96
147,1160,Gyle41386,3.95,"Couldn't find this beer anywhere, then finally spotted a handful of 12 oz bottles at the third Green's I looked at.  Pours a dark, dark black with a thin cappuccino head. Smells of hops, chocolate, coffee, and alcohol. I didn't know this was a 10.8% until I took my first sip and had to check the bottle. It tastes very roasty, with cocoa and coffee notes. The bitter and sweet elements balance each other very well. I felt that the alcohol was inconsistent, meaning I tasted it on some sips and not others. Full bodied and thick. I don't think I could drink more than one of these at a time.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,96

147,1160,joerodiii,3.66,"This beer pours a beautiful, thick black in the glass with minimal head. The aroma is nice -- hints of roasted barley and chocolate with a strong smell of alcohol. The beer hits the mouth with a moderate but noticeable taste of chocolate. The mouthfeel is appropriately thick with low to moderate carbonation. Unfortunately, then the alcohol takes over. As it hits the back of the mouth, there is a strong bitterness. There is no noticeable hop flavor, but it is very bitter tasting, maybe a bit too bitter. I really think this beer (from spring '08) needs to age for a couple of years to mellow and balance out.  A friend described this beer as very drinkable...kind of like a session RIS. I disagree. The combination of bitterness and strong alcohol flavor made the bomber tough to finish.

Overall This was a big letdown for me. It's raved about and Stone makes other beers I've really enjoyed.

Thick and rich, coating the palate. Lacing on the glass for good visual. Big bite off the bat, very smooth afterword. Bold flavors of the coffee roast come heavily into play.

147,1160,jstilwell,4.21,"Found these in the small bottle. With no one to share with tonight, it made for the perfect after dinner size.  A: Thick Dark Chocolate Color. (See image above) There is no light shining through this one. Nice thick light brown head results from a standard pour.  S: Hints of Dark roasted coffee and strong alcohol.  T&M: Mild bitter beginning followed by serious explosion of coffee, chocolate and chestnuts. Sap splatterd tree bark comes to mind for some reason. This is decadent chewy and complex for sure. As with all of the quality stouts, mouth swishing recreates the taste cycle and brings out more subtle characteristics. I think I am now getting some plums and black pepper.  D: Oh no, not more than one of these. The bitter ending and high alcohol make it prohibitive. The alcohol is strongly apparent but I would not have guessed it to be close to 11 ABV. A drinkable offering as compared to others in the same ABV class.  All dark beer lovers need to try this one. It is a great representation of the style, and has some unique qualities to it.

There's an assertive hop bitterness, but it's more than balanced by the rich malts.  M - Dense, viscous, round, and full-bodied.  D - This is a slow sipping brew, perfect for a nice, lengthy contemplation every now and then.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,96

The addition of high alpha bitterness and soy sauce in the taste give this beer a wonderful depth of flavor. No flour Chocolate cake and cappucino show with warmth. The mouthfeel is very thick with soft, velvety cabonation. Roasted barley, coca and hop bitterness makes up the long dry finish.  Alcohol is remarkably low key for 11% ABV.

The bottle is cool, the Stone Gargoyle with a Russian cap on. What I like about the Stone 22oz bombers is the text on the backside of the bottle. Always an interesting read.  The pour of this stout is what a stout should be, a dark pour. Pretty heavy and no light comes through the glass. With my pour I got almost no head, like half a finger or so.  The smell is good, one of the strongest characteristics of this beer is the alcohol. You can smell it right away and taste it immediately, which is so so good.  The taste is really good, no outstanding flavor pops out, just a combination of coffee, some pine or spice, and alcohol. Really drinkable also, really fun to finish. Two or three of these suckers would get you pretty lit. When drinking a good craft beer, getting a little drunk is just that makes the taste double in pleasure.  Will buy all that I find.

147,1160,popery,4.85,"Limited Spring 2008 Release 12oz bottle. A thick, smooth Imperial Stout with phenomenal depth of flavor and a round, luscious mouthfeel. The liquid is opaque and black topped by a small but sticky dark brown head. The nose is rich with perfectly toasted malt. The flavor is vast and superior, in my opinion, to many fancily barrel-aged stouts, not that I don't love a good barrel-aged beer. Stone just manages to pack in massive toasted malt flavor without adding in outside complexity. The malt is mostly chocolate with some coffee on top of wonderfully burnt toast. It's not nearly as roasted as some Imperial Stouts but the roasted flavor is just right. There's still some hop bitterness without too much age on the bottle. There are a number of flavors that will take me a few more years of beer tasting to describe adequately. The feel is incredible, lush, smooth, thick but never cloying or sticky. It's a remarkably drinkable beer for the alcohol level and the depth of flavor. You just have to keep going back for more. I wish that I had a case of this stuff, and come Spring 2009, I will.

147,1160,GordonQuid,4.63,"Stone Russian Imperial Stout poured jet black with deep purple, deep mahogany hues as I swirl it in a 16oz goblet. A thick creamy ¾ inch head with thick leggy lacing is present initially. The head dissipates to tan ring around the top of the glass, lacing is nice and thick.  The smell is that of dark roasted chocolate, black malts, alcohol soaked prunes/raisins and nugget hops right in the front of the nose. From the mere smell of this I can't wait to take a nice-long sip.  Taste is very heavy and rich roasted barley, chocolate and black malts. Turbinado sugar soaked dates and raisins and a blend of nugget and fuggle hops produce a slight dry finish. However I am blown away by the dynamics of this incredible elixir. Fucking incredibly SEDUCTIVE! As this warms I can pick out some fruity esters, caramel sweetness but still get a nice dry finish with subtle hops lingering. Excellent Russian Imperial Stout with a dynamic profile only the brewer's at Stone can produce. My hat is off to you gentlemen....  FULL bodied! This brew is a drinking experience. I would suggest having only one or sharing one with a good friend or a beautiful voluptuous woman or two cute chicks who are willing to try new things.... (?) Not a session beer.

Taste is too fruity with currants and prunes. I like the chocolate/stiff coffee base, but the currants are too much. While this is a very good Russian Imperial, It can not hold a candle to the Speedway. This is fruitier and sweeter, with a strong alcoholic bite.

Smell: Heavy coffee and chocolate aroma. Kind of like a mocha. My buddy seems to think it smells like red wine but I don't smell that so much.  Taste: Big roasted malts, coffee and dark chocolate. It has a little bite to it towards the end of the sip. Starts to taste much better as it warms.  Mouthfeel: Not much carbonation but very dry finish. Really invites you to drink more.

Smooth, tasty filling, exactly what I wanted last night after work. It was hard to pick up any real distinct flavors but it worked. There was of course a malty/dark chocolate sweetness to it, but not as much coffee as I expected. This is a very good R.I.S. if your looking for one and the price is right too.

Sweetened coffee, fig, chocolate and pine on the nose, although it was a struggle to pick those out. Not as aromatic as I would like. Surprisingly sweet on the palate at first, but flavors of coffee, chocolate, and caramel come through, along with a piney hop character. Assertive hop and roast bitterness provides balance.

147,1160,TLove,4.82,"This beer is probably the best Russian Imperial Stouts I have ever had.  It has a great thickness to the pour and a beautiful, substantive, dark head with barely any fizziness. The smell is rich with roasted chocolate and espresso malt, but it is smooth as hell.  The first taste and the last taste are exactly the same. The incredible thing about this beer is that its consistency is just as strong and substantive as the very first sip. The flavor is similar to the smell, with a beautiful malty, bitter taste that is infused with dark chocolate, espresso, and oats. There is an undeniable smoothness to the substance and has an almost imbued bitterness that disguises the near 11% ABV content.  The finish is fantastic as well. The bitter touches the tip of your tongue on the front, the alcohol burns on the back, and the richness of the motor-oil consistency and oaty smoothness just flow down your throat. It is remarkably easy to drink, despite its thickness, but can be unapologetic in its brutally beautiful style to those who are unaccustomed to the mighty russian imperial stout.

And some Swedish dark baking syrup (contains malt extracts and is used to make breed).  The taste is very complex. It is mild, bitter, sweet, dry... Everything goes very well together. After a couple of sips I can taste some dark chocolate and some coffee.  As a liquid it's thick. The density must be quite high.

I don't really see how an RIS could look better.  Smell is boozy in the snifter, but not overpoweringly so. Aside from the alcohol there is also lots of roasted malts and coffee.  Taste is bitter hops, roasted malts and coffee with some warming alcohol. Very nice and pretty much perfect for the style. It is exactly what you would expect a good RIS to taste like.  Mouthfeel is full, solid, somewhat creamy but not too thick or syrupy. I think the ABV has a lot to do with keeping this one from being too viscous. It definately has a nice burn to it, as well.  Let's be honest. This is not a six-pack kind of beer. It is big and demands respect. I do not know if I would want more than 12 oz in one sitting, but then again I probably wouldn't turn it down and I will definately be drinking this again.  Stouts are not generally high up on my list of styles, but this is good. Highly recommended, especially in a world of $20+ bottles of beer. Buy a bunch and cellar some.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,96
147,1160,dancinwillie,3.35,"Spring 2008 release.  A: Pours, um well, black. Crowned with a mocha head that slowly disappears. Frothy looking, and seemed viscous during the slighty aggressive pour.  S: Hit me while pouring. Coffee, Chocolate, a general fruitiness.  T: A bittersweet chocolate mixes with slight bitter coffee, dark fruit(iness). Perhaps more of a cocoa flavor than chocolate. A lot of roasted flavor. A noticeable hop bite. Pretty tasty, but honestly, a bit tame. I will say that it's impressive that absolutely none of the alcohol flavor can be detected. None.  M: Smooth and silky. Low carbo. Full bodied.  D: I COULD drink a few of these at a sitting. But I don't think I would. For my money, there's many better examples of the style. This isn't bad in any way, it just doesn't stand out from many others in an overpopulated style. Good, but no better.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,96
147,1160,linnet,4.82,"Creamy brown head, colour is almost pitch black. Smell is roasted, coffee, hops, liqorice. Flavour is exceptional! It's sweet powerful, heavily roasted, dark chocolate, liqorice and very warming but yet not overwhelming. Mouthfeel is very smooth. The best imperial stout I've had to date.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,96
147,1160,olegv40,4.66,"This was a Spring 2008 bottle. This was one of the best looking beers I've ever seen. Poured pitch black with a finger thick dark brown head. When being poured out of a bottle had the consistency of crude oil or some sort of sludge. I put it up against a light to try to see what color it really is, since most stouts end up being a dark red when put up against the light. Not this guy, there was absolutely no light getting through.  Tasted of mild hops, chocolate, and a pleasant bitterness. When drank normally I could barely detect the alcohol at all, only when I kept sipped and savored did I detect the massive amount of alcohol that Stone throws at this thing.  Delightful and extraordinary, this is one of the best beers I've ever had, give me a few of these on a cold day, and I'm a very very happy man.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,96
147,1160,taylorhamrick,4.05,"This was a bomber of the 2008 version.  It pours out nice and dark, with some red/amber hues around the edges. The head was about a half inch thick and brown. There was some lacing and a few swirls of bubbles by the end, but finishing it before they die is a task. I also noticed a few little chunks, which doesn't exactly turn me off. Actually, I like seeing a bit of sediment. The smell is a bit sweet and boozy, about what you'd expect from an imperial stout. A bit of ripe fruit and deep sweetness you'd expect from roasted malts. The taste is very pleasant. The sweetness hits you first, and the taste finishes a bit sweet. But I was very happy to taste a bit of the roasted character of these. Sometimes I like that fresher taste, with a bit of bitterness from hops and malt overtaking the sweetness - and fresh, this one delivers. The alcohol is noticeable, but it blends well, like it should. And unlike some examples of the style, there is nothing to make you flinch in the taste, like the burnt tastes that accompany some darker beers. The mouthfeel is surprisingly a bit below what I expected from the taste. You don't get a whole rush. The flavors come and pass, but it doesn't make a huge difference. But there's a good bit of thickness, full enough to keep me interested - but it's thinned out a bit from the alcohol. This beer is also fairly easy to drink for the style. I never know what to do about drinkability with RISs, because you could put back 3-4 sessionable beers in the time it takes to drink the average RIS, but I enjoyed it the whole time, and the experience got better with time, and I finished it quicker than I have with some others.  Another great beer by Stone. I might pick up some of the 12oz late 2008 release to try it again.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,96
147,1160,dickieb,4.58,"Pours black as night with a 3 finger coffee colored head that works down to about 1/4"" and leaves some grate lacing. The smell is rich with dark roasted malts spent coffee and bitter chocolate. The flavor is complex with roasted malts some bitter hopping and light hints of chocolate and some earthy spicing. The mouthfeel is perfect for the beer, and this is the most drinkable RIS I can every remember. Such an excellent beer and example of the style.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,96
147,1160,swanmann,3.56,"The bottle poured thick and dark chocolate color with about an inch of orange hued tan head. I'm afraid I'm just too congested to fully appreciate aromas and flavors. I definitely get warm alcohol in the nose. Alcohol in the taste, but also chocolate, and an aspirin like bitterness, which I'm sure is off due to my cold. Doh! What a shame. I can get only a few Stone brews in Oklahoma, and this ain't one of them.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,96
147,1160,SammyB,3.96,"I have been sitting on this beer for 6 months and have been anxious to try...22oz bottle  To begin I love the time that Stone puts into their product from the quality of the beverage to the silk screen bottles....  The appearance was nice a 1/2 shade off black with minimal light penetrating. A coffee colored, 1 1/2 finger head evolved but reduced in a minute to leave a decent lacing. My first drink proved that the beer was too cold and i would suggest allowing it to warm slightly because it is only then that you can appreciate the caramelized sugars, dark chocolate, alcohol, but still could detect the malt and hops. I didn't think the mouth feel was as thick as the bottle described, but the texture and taste formulated a very drinkable beer.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,96
147,1160,Vendetta,3.66,"Original Rating Date: May 17, 2008  I'm really not a big stout fan, but I had to try this. Pours like motor oil. Deep black hue with a dark creamy head. Aroma strikes me as deep, fruity, candy, but isn't all that noticeable. Flavor is a wonderful toasted coffee with a hint of creamy dark fruity chocolate. Feels amazing in the mouth, thicky and creamy. The high abv (10.8%) is well hidden by the taste. I have yet to drink another stout that comes anywhere close to this one.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,96

Mouthfeel: Pretty thick, not coating though.  Drinkability: Went down pretty quick for a impy stout.  Finally got to try this after several years of waiting. Picked up a single 12oz bottle from over in Wisconsin. I was not blown away by this beer's flavor. It didn't seem to be all that complex. I let it warm but it didn't seem to change much.

A- pours a thick looking black body under a finger of lasting coffee colored head that sticks around and leaves an even lacing on the sides of the glass. cant ask for more than that.  S- lots of roasted malts, milk chocolate, and a touch of alcohol. some faint hints of dark fruits as well.  T- a lot of roasted malts upfront along with some faint figs and plums. definitely some milk chocolate. lots of coffee at the end, along with some hops.  M- nice and thick, almost chewy. slight heat from the booze, but at over 10% its extremely well hidden.  D- wow, this is one thats worthy of its following. extremely easy to finish, but at the ABV its really not a good idea to have more than one. i wish this was available in my area, but an hours drive for this makes it well worth it. cant wait to see what this one develops into! check this one out if you get the chance, highly recommended.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,96
147,1160,Ljunkan,4.75,"Pours a pitch black color with a brown head. It dissapears quite quick. Some lacing.  Smell is roasted malt, chocolate, toffee and coffee.  Taste is quite sweet first. Notes of dark chocolate, lots of coffee, toffee, almost Riesen. Some hops in the background but they are not that prominent as I expected. On the other hand that's only good according to me. Ends with a great bitterness. Much more balaced than other american imp. stouts I've had lately. Wonderful taste! Too drink this is like letting some chocolate toffee melt in your mouth, and even better! Aah.  Wonderful and filling in the mouth. Very creamy, quite thick, a bit sticky, but at the same time smooth. Wonderful and fantastic.  This is defintely a very nice sipper. Despite the 90+ IBU:s (?) it feels very balanced. Not too bitter, but not too sweet either. This is how I want to have my imperial stout! Fantastic! Very tasty! I'm really happy now.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,96
147,1160,LilBeerDoctor,4.06,"Reviewed on 4/14/08. Bottle, 2007. Pours a dark, thick black with a pretty 3/4"" dark tan head that dissipates quickly. Aroma of chocolate, coffee, alcohol. Flavor of mild chocolate, roast, raisin (especially as the beer warmed), and some smoked meat. A good imp stout. Complex, yet it had an almost mild palate. I would like to try this again. 8/5/8/4/16 (4.1/5)  Update 6/22/08: Had this on tap at the Ginger Man. Smells very nice, strongly of coffee. This is too green as the mouthfeel is heavy, cloying, and sweet. Strong alcohol presence. Needs to mellow and definitely should be aged at least 1 year.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,96
147,1160,PBoegel,4.2,"2008 edition bottling.  Let me just say, I have had bottle(s) of this beer in 2006 and 2007 and then earlier I think first year of release.  I always enjoyed it but found it a bit too much, too thick, too cloying too hoppy.  I do not know if the recipe has changed at all, especially on the hops, or if this beer just needs a significant at least 6 month minimum cellaring, but I found it much more to my liking.  Pours dark and with some trademark Imperial Stout viscosity. The aroma's actually eminate well on the pour, picked up roastiness, maple syrup, vanilla, cocoa, dark wheats, some spicey aloohol notes. The head was near brown and think but breaks fairly quickly in an imperial pint glass.  The flavor is much more mellowed than I have recalled, thick and robust but inviting. Hints of dark sweet hot fudge and roasted grain, some hints of dried fruits, chocolate covered raisins and cherries. The hop character I have previously recalled as being in too much conflict with the malt profile is much more subdued and in balance.  Think I am going to pick up another bottle and cellar it another year.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,96
147,1160,corby112,5,"Pours a dep dark black with a chocolate/coffe colored head. Aromas has hints of roasted malts, coffee, alcohol, and chocolate. Full bodied with a lot of roasted malt flavor.

147,1160,Bung,4.23,"Good black/brown pour, some light gets through around the edge. Not much visible carbonation to speak of, but is present going down. Nice dark brown head, but thin and short lived. Excellent roasted malt and mocha coffee aromas. Flavor the same, a bit lively in the mouth at first, but really mellows nicely. Chocolate, coffee and warming alcohol really come out. Dry hopping maybe? gives this a nice bite also. Alcohol is not overly present at any time. A very good RIS very straight forward and no bull. But honestly, not that remarkable considering this is supposedly a top ten. Tried an 08, I bet this will age nicely though.  Update, had a 2 year old sample of this and WOW did it age nice. Had that awesume layered head white, ruby and brown. Much more complex, less bitterness. Like a fine port and double stout combined.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,96
147,1160,Brianmerrilyn,4.2,"After a long time of passing over this one at various stores, I gave in and tried the vaunted Stone RIPA.  A: Poured into snifter, to reveal a dark that I can only relate to of deep sea black. Along with the 2 and half plus dark tan head, and a medium to minor lacing, you will find to your pleasure some chocolate glints here and there.  S: The nose don't play. If you don't know what Russian Imperial means, taking a whiff of Stone's is a good benchmark. Coffee and coco and mixed with lots of roasted malts. The ABV is upfront and on the verge of overpowering, but with further aging, I know that will subside.  Overall, you get a full blast of flavor with each quafing of this darling. Malts takes over as you move down the glass. It's not af if your chewing on Whoppers here, but the emphasis malt and more of it. The taste continues to develop with after tastes of molasses and low keyed noble hops perhaps. This is a meal in itself and a truly large big boy beer. The density of the flavor sticks to all parts of your cheeks and a studio of candy flavors prevails to my wide grin.  M: A great leveling of strong flavors to provide a heavy cocktail coating all parts of your mouth. The finish is baby skin smooth.  D: A wonderful experience and heavy duty delivery of malts and candies with an ABV that cannot be ignored with time. This is a top shelf for the mature beer drinking pallet.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,96
147,1160,ruckzuck,4.35,"Woo, so glad this is in GA now!  A - pours an opaque, smooth black body with a chocolaty head which dissipated somewhat quickly  S - that roasted chocolate malt is in full effect. Rich chocolate, coffee, hints of ABV, caramel, and syrup  T - again, a rich roasty mouthfeel. A real delight to drink. Dark chocolate is much more pronounced in the aftertaste, and it's awesome. The tiniest hints of hops are around, and there's sort of dark fruit taste up front. ABV really isn't that pronounced IMO. Of course the awesome coffee and caramel aromas show up in the taste to round this badboy out, and man oh man is it tasty  M - smoooth in the mouth. Luxurious body and just an all around a nice a feel. Excellent  D - wow, I was psyched to have this after realizing it was on sale here and so highly ranked, and I can see why it has the ranking it does. This is a hell of RIS. The taste and mouthfeel are amazing, and the ABV is well-hidden IMO. I could certainly drink another of these, although that's probably not the best idea. Anyway, I love this.

Mouthfeel: Exceptionally smooth. Rich and thick. Not quite as heavy as I expected  Drinkability: Great beer, I will have to get some more.

147,1160,waltonc,3.83,"Thank you Stone for offering this in a 12 ounce bottle. Nice to see a brewer offering a super strong heavy beer in a smaller bottle than before, instead of the reverse. This has always been a favorite imperial stout of mine, though I didn't enjoy this year's serving as much as previous years. Perhaps my tastes have just changed? But it seemed like this was hoppier than years past. Maybe it just needs a little time to mellow out. But anyway, taste is deep dark roasted malts, coffee, chocolate, and hop bomb levels of hoppiness. Gotta ding the taste for the out of whack hops. Mouthfeel is thick, creamy, and very nice. While I was once able to get through a whole bomber of this, I now struggle to get through a 12 ounce bottle.  Update: 2009 version seems to have corrected the hop bomb issue.

There's licorice, chocolate, dark fruits, and a noticeable alcohol.  Taste begins with a carmel or brown sugar sweetness. Maybe I'm getting a trace of cinnamon. A smokey, coffee flavor follows.  The mouthfeel is thin as can possibly be for a stout, but is not unwelcome.

Dark malty flavor with roast and choclate, very mildly bittered, with a pleasant sweet but not overdone aftertaste. leaves a little chocolate/cocoa on the tongue. A nice alcolhol warming sets in after the second or third swallow.

147,1160,Jmamay22,4.25,"This bottle is a 2008 release. I'm surprised I haven't rated this one yet. I've enjoyed Stone's IRS over several years at various ages. It has generally been a delight.  Pours a menacing black with a mocha colored head that fades to a thin collar. Smells of dusted cocoa, roasted malt, lightly of soy sauce and a generous helping of hops in typical Stone fashion. The soy sauce is less than pleasant, but plays a minor roll. Nonetheless it would be better without and something I haven't picked up until more recent versions of this brew.  Strong cocoa and dark chocolate flavors dominate, but give way to a growing alcohol presence and firmer mouthfeel. A definitive finish consists of a kick of hops, roasted malt, coffee and alcohol. The flavors of sweet chocolate are nicely maintained by the hops and roasted flavors to strike a balance. Alcohol remains embedded within the beer rather than acting as a defining component making this an enjoyable sipper on a cold night.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,96

Dark chocolate, dark malt, dark caramelized sugars, alcohol (ok that one isn't dark.) I drank this one very slowly in 4 small glass increments. The first was pretty cold, possibly too cool. That was a much different, smaller beer than the later and warmer cups. I'd recommend this one warm only...you are missing out on the best parts when it is cold. I like the coffee notes that come with warmth. Mouthfeel is great, really astringent aftertaste that screams bitter cocoa with hops.

Has a thick scent which gives off a burnt, toasty smell. Bittersweet overall.  Taste: A delicious malty blend of semisweet chocolate, roasted coffee beans, dark fruits, and a little cream. Very rich and thick. For the most part it's sweet, with a slight bitterness underneath.  Mouthfeel: Creamy with a milky feel on the palate. In the mouth it feels rich and thick like a milkshake. Aftertaste is bitter, with a coffee taste up front.  Drinkability: This is a phenominal stout beer that ever fan of the style needs to try.

T: The first impression when the beer is on the cold side is a smoky, peaty flavor that lingers long after swallowed. As it warmed, a sweetness appeared that was undetectable when cold. Aftertaste reminds me of smoky, sweet beef jerky, but in the most pleasant way possible. This is a wonderful late-night pleasure that I plan to keep on hand at all times.

This one had legs when swirled.  Smell was brown sugar and raisins. Moist, freshly baked brown bread. Some alcohol in the aroma.  Taste was roasted bitterness. Chocolate and dates. Steely. Mellow and rich. Very nice to savor over the evening. Well hidden alcohol. The roast and hops were just enough to accentuate the rich malts and sweetness.  Mouthfeel was smooth and velvet-like. Wow.

147,1160,erikm25,4.23,"A: This concoction pours a thick blackened molasses. Held up to the light I was unable to find even the slightest nod to any other hues. An aggressive pour yielded a minimal burnt caramel colored head. Lacing is slight yet present to the end. If you could pour a midnight starless and moonless sky into a glass this is what it would look like.  S: Aromas are oats coupled with a subtle mixture of dark cherries, figs, and plums. Rich chocolate sweetness appears towards the back but overall this aroma can be described as honey warm. Despite the high ABV the alcohol appears instantly and fleetingly like an apparition.  T: Rich toffee chocolate and malt tastes. Additionally a sting of hops hits the tongue. Barley coupled with a pinch of coffee and sprinkled with brown sugars. Complex balance of creamy cocoa richness and grapefruit laced licorice. Chocolate becomes even more apparent as it warms. The alcohol is only present after it drops the bodies temperature down a bit.  M: A creamy rich viscousness that plasters its flavors all around the mouth. A flat out treat.  D: Perfect beer with some warming fuzzy music. Drinkability is a double edged sword. In a perfect world I would love to make this a regular habit but it is one I will save for special occasions. Worth picking up and holding on to for down the road. Stone always delivers.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,96
147,1160,WYVYRN527,4.77,"Might be my new favorite. I opened a 22 oz. bottle and poured it into my trusty pint glass. Black with a very thin head that dissapates almost immediately. The aroma is soft, and chocolate and roasted grains shine through. On the palate, espresso, bitter chocolate, and vanilla strike with force. The hops aren't very present until the very end, where it has a very mild, dry finish. This medium bodied beast could be a session stout, even though it has strength and body that rivals a Sherman tank. I love this beer, and it's unfortunate that it isn't sold here in the Minnesotan tundra.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,96
147,1160,daythree16,4.3,"22 oz bottle poured into snifters and shared with my wife. The bottle indicates that it is from the Spring '07 release. It pours a jet black with a one-finger brown head.  There are aromas of rich chocolate and dark fruit, chiefly ripe figs. Taste is mostly chocolate and caramel up front. Some figs and other dark fruit are present as well. As the beer warms, some coffee bitterness begins to develop.  Mouthfeel is thick and silky, and it coats the tongue on each sip. The beer is super rich, and coupled with the high ABV, this one is definitely a sipper.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,96
147,1160,Reagan1984,4.45,"What a great beer to come in from the cold with.... Poured almost a full black in color with a thick creamy tan head. This remained floating on top of the beer for quite some time before slowly receding back into the glass.  Aroma was a nice combination of both chocolate notes and some vanilla bean.... Black licorice?  Flavor was very nice and only got better as the beer warmed to close to room temp. Chocolate notes up front, then some cinnamon. Slowly faded to a vanilla bean or vanilla extract note (very subtle) and again a get a slight touch of black licorice..  Mouth feel is medium to full bodied and silky creamy in texture.  I just think this is a great beer.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,96
147,1160,danielharper,4.65,"Appearance: This thing is so dark you'd probably need a photospectrometer to differentiate its color from that of the Bootes Void... and yeah, I was waiting for the opportunity to use that tortured metaphor. Suffice to say it's extremely deep black, completely opaque, Has a tiny head that dissipates but leaves a touch of lacing regardless. It's not quite as intense as Dark Lord, but it's close.  Smell: Highly malty, strong notes of barley and intense grains. Hints of coffee and bittersweet chocolate. Lots of hops and a touch of astringency due to alcohol. Rich, inviting.  Taste: Heavily malty, strong doses of crisp California hops, with a strong tart astringency due to the alcohol. Delicious qualities of coffee, chocolate, hints of bittersweet raisins. Sweet and astringent finish, with a dry, bittersweet, malty aftertaste that leaves me wanting another drink. As the beer warms the dryness and the maltiness become more prominent. Delicious and well-executed.  Mouthfeel: Thick, low carbonation. Chewy but also smooth.  Drinkability: A fantastic beer. Approximately equal to Bell's Expedition in terms of quality, and a fine brew to have on these cold winter evenings. A beer designed to be savored and enjoyed for as long as the bottle lasts.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,96
147,1160,Tolnik,4.87,This is a wonderful beer. The dark dark brown beer has a great amount of foam and even a great lingering lacing after settling.

Overall this is a wonderful beer that I would highly suggest anyone that wishes for a great stout to grab this beer.,Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,96
147,1160,rhinos00,4.67,"Poured out of a 22 oz. bomber into a snifter.  A- Jet black. Inch of tan head formed but disappeared rather quickly.  S- Combination of dark chocolate, coffee, malt, dark fruits (maybe prunes?) and alcohol.  T- Chocolate and coffee are the first things that come to mind. This is followed by a mix of malts and hops. Alcohol is not as prevalent as I thought it would be.  M- Complexion is viscous, yet rather smooth. Very little carbonation if any.  D- Very drinkable for a beer with almost 11% abv. Beer went down so smooth.  Overall a very impressive beer. With such a high abv. the flavors masked it well, allowing for smooth consumption. Highly recommended!",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,96

Needless to say I'm a huge Stone fan and a big RIS fan, so I was super excited to find this bad boy and give him a try.  A: Pitch black body with a nice tan head that didn't stick around too long.  S: Roasted grains, dark chocolate, dark fruits, coffee and alcohol.  T: Rich and malty with a chocolate presence right off the bat; after the swallow, the coffee and dark dried fruit flavors; big hops emerge on the finish and provide a long lasting bitterness.  M: Rich and viscous; not much carbonation; warms on the gullet for a long time after the swallow.  D: Quite a brew and deserved of the great reputation it has gained. Stone not surprisingly has another winner and here's a beer all great advocates should seek out and try. Drank very smooth and easily for an RIS, a sign of quality. Still, I've got to give the RIS edge to Victory's Storm King (and even Brooklyn's BCS), though that just shows this brew is in excellent company.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,96

The head is the same dark tan color as espresso foam, but dissipates rather quickly. A thin lace remains, though.  Dark and earthy aromas, such as coffee, fuse with dark fruits like prunes. Slight smell of alcohol.  Coffee flavor and sweet, dark malts. The sweetness is very thick and syrupy. There's also some dark and spicy anise tossed in there.  Viscous mouthfeel. Carbonation is light and moderate. Very smooth overall.  Very drinkable for an RIS. Very smooth and enjoyable.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,96

Pours a dark black color with some dark red hues with a one finger tan creamy head with good retention. Lots of bitter aromas, lemon rind, espresso, chocolate with some dark stone fruit. Up front coffee flavor with roated and smoked malt, lemon rind, alchol warmth and some cherry. Light carbonation, very full body with a chalky, mouth coating feel to it, very dry.

Pours a syrupy, thick, used motor oil BLACK with a caramel brown head a couple inches deep that lingers around. Good lacing. Robust aromas of roasted malts, chocolate, burnt caramel, awesome. Taste is equally as decadent as the smell. Huge roasted malt flavors, caramel, dark chocolate, milk chocolate, balanced out with some sweetness and a noticeable hop presence. Simply put, Outstanding & Phenomenal. Mouthfeel is huge and viscous, oily, slick, coats the mouth.

147,1160,kcillini77,4.49,"Picked up on my last trip to Livermore. Spring 2008 on the bottle. Found it in September, but this is supposed to age well, so I just consider myself lucky to have found it, especially for 6 bucks.  No head whatsoever to speak of. That's primarily why the appearance suffers, though I'm sure it's not intended to have a huge head.  Taste is a wonderful roasted malt and coffee and chocolate overtones with just enough hops to balance it out. A brandy-like warming alcohol is very present on the swallow. Certainly couldn't handle more than one bomber, but this is an exceptionally tasty brew, and I find myself lucky to have had the chance to experience it.  After enjoying on its own, I finished the bottle up with a little dark chocolate. Great pairing!",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,96

147,1160,Pleepleus,3.9,"Reviewed from notes. Poured from bomber to pint glass black as night with a minimal tan head. Smelled of burnt malt and chocolate. Warm mild alcohol taste with malty sweetness, coffee and chocolate. Has a very mild booze taste but the ABV is for real in this one. I will buy this again but would probably not have more than one in a session.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,96
147,1160,Arsenal82,4.83,"Poured from a 1 pint 6 oz bottle. It poured dark and rich and settled with about a half inch thick mocha head. It smelled of coffee, chocolate and sweet malts. The taste was even more incredible, even better than the smell. The chocolate and coffee accents were there along with the malty freshness. Even the slight bitterness in the end was great. Mouthfeel was excellent. Very smooth going down, could drink another one! Excellent choice with this Stone, not too hoppy and not too sweet, very balanced in the end. Definitly recommended on a nice cool New England night.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,96
147,1160,YonderWanderer,4.42,"Stone IRS pours a dark black with brownish-red highlights when held up to the light. A layer of dark tan foam forms on top upon the pour.  Smell is of chocolate, roasted grains, and a hint of coffee. Taste follows suit, with chocolate flavors leading the way. Roasted grains, coffee, a hint of brown sugar and molasses also make their way into the mix. Alcohol is a bit warm, but barely noticeable overall.  This is a smooth and thick stout, that goes down easier than a 10% brew should. An enjoyable stout. Not the best I've ever had, but certainly a solid and delicious offering.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,96

D - Too much chocolate for me but still fairly easy to drink. The alcohol is nearly undetectable and the body is full. If you like chocolate then this is for you.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,96
147,1160,bluemoonswoon,4.6,"22oz bomber, thanks to MtGoat, poured into a bubble glass.  A: Dark as night and at first topped with a deep reddish brown half inch head that fades into a thin ring. Lifted to the lips and set down again, the liquid clings to the sides of the glass and slowly sinks back to the rest of the beer. Even though there is not too much lacing, this beer lets you know how thick it is.  S: Brown sugar and more brown sugar, tobacco, slight hint of smoke and oak, dark fruits and more dark fruits  T/MF: Thick, mildly carbonated, heavy and sweet then quickly bitter, tobacco, bitter chocolate, coarse ground iced black coffee. Wonderful malt bill, rich without being overly sweet and bitter without taking away from the sweetness. Finish is mildly bitter, finishes a bit dry and reaffirms the flavors on the first initial sips.  D: This beer is something out of this world. Just amazingly solid, tasty, easy drinking sipper, been drinking this for well over an hour and it only gets better. I would argue that this beer gives all those other rare RIS's a run for their money.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,96
147,1160,Jwale73,3.97,"Had the opportunity to sample this one right after it was released and thought it was a little hot and could benefit from some cellaring, so here goes...  2008 vintage served in my Terrapin snifter. Poured a deep, opaque brown just shy of black with a quarter inch, frothy tan-colored head that quickly dispersed into a soapy skim. No lacing present during the tasting. Nose is cocoa, malt, brown sugar, molasses and alcohol at the tail end. Taste is consistent with nose, but some hops bittering is exposed in the middle and lingers lightly at the finish. Mouthfeel is medium, but a bit thinner than anticipated. Some carbonation burn across the tongue amplifies the bitterness. Alcohol heat lingers at the back of the throat between quaffs. Decent RIS, but not my favorite; a solid offering nonetheless. Can't wait to do a vertical to see how this one ages.  Edit. Thanks to SteveMcqueenJr for sharing on 2005 vintage as part of the 'Motha of all Stout Tastings' on 4.17.09 (beer #4).  A. 4.0 - Pours with a mocha-colored head that quickly dissipates. S 4.0 - Licorice, malt, hops, a little booze and some caramel. T 4.5 - A little hoppy, some caramel, some roast and some char. M 4.0 - Just south of medium-bodied and a little effervescent. D 4.5 - A great balanced beer - some hops come out, but a great sipper and alcohol is very well-hidden. This beer really holds up well over time. A great treat.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,96
147,1160,deaconsmith,4.25,"A.-In a thick glass mug it poured a beautiful rich creamy burnt tannish tinted head about a inch thick. Nice head retention with a fair to medium lacing. The beer it self was a cold black with a thick heavy body.  S.-A sweet malty chocolate aroma with a mild bitter coffee rhythm section. Hints of unidentified nectar like tones and and the smell of alcohol was not too shy.  T.-Initial taste was a sweet malty, creamy chocolate with A bitter roasted blend at the end. The hops were there but almost disguised..The alcohol was much stronger in taste than in smell but still all flavors blended very well..A well balanced taste.  M.-Temperature was in the mid 40's and was kind of a mild shock first going in the mouth..Very thick but smooth with a medium carbonation. Very creamy going down the throat with very little texture sustain.  D.-Also another one to drink slow and you probably don't want to get more than one or two.. It is a really thick, heavy beer with a bold ABV but delightful in every way for savoring a well crafted brew...A awsome after dinner beer.  **I have always been a fan of Stone Brewing co. and this one added a missing dimension to their line..Signature taste and very well put together..Going on my top 50 list..I recommend this beer.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,96
147,1160,paytoplay,4.15,"This beer has a weight to it, and density that is special. Milk and dark chocolate, coffee nib, excelent nose and dark rich head. Almost too much of a good thing.

147,1160,BierFan,4.4,Poured from a 22 ounce bottle into a tumbler glass.  Appearance: Dark black with a small head the color of the fizz on a coca-cola.  Smell: Aroma of black coffee and bitter chocolate.  Taste: To me it mainly has the taste of bitter chocolate.  I was surprised how drinkable the beer was even though it has such a high alcohol content.  A very good imperial stout but I prefer Samuel Smith's offering.,Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,96
147,1160,bigkahunas4,4.55,"Poured from a 22oz bottle into a snifter  A: Pours a thin chocolate syrup, thin cocoa head w/ slight brown lacing.  S: Dark Chocolate, hint of raspberry, and alcohol finish  T: Coffee roast, dark chocolate, almond, milk, warming alcohol after. Extremely balanced and tastey.  M: Creamy and sticky. The complexity reality consumes your entire palette.  D: Definitely a great session beer to be drank slowly and appreciated between sips. Incredibly balanced.

147,1160,seangroves,4.65,"Poured into a pint glass.  Appearance: The beer pours well with very little head, about 1/8"" that dissipates quickly. The beer color is very black, typical of a Russian Imperial. It's darkness and low appearance of carbonation is welcoming.  Smell: The beer is very easy on the nose. You can prominently smell the roasted malts used in it, with a hint of chocolate; the roasted malts are very strong in smell. There is a slight almost ""fruity"" smell from the hops but again it is very focused toward the malts.  Taste: The beer has a very balanced taste between the malt and hops which is surprising given the strong smell of the roasted/choc malts but is quite balanced and soothing. As is typical of Imperial Stouts it does have a strong after-bite of dark malt but is not too overpowering.  Mouthfeel: This beer feels surprisingly light in the mouth and goes down very smoothly. There is no feeling of over-carbonation yet it does not feel under-carbonated, it has struck the right balance.  Drinkability: This beer is very ease to consume. It would make a great session beer as it is perfect to drink at a slow-to-moderate speed, especially given its higher ABV. It's smoothness coupled with the great taste balance between the malts and hops is very inviting. I would definitely have another.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,96
147,1160,BMoney575,4.7,"Sampled on 9-24-08 2007 Edition  Pours completely black, with a foamy brown head that quickly settles. Brown lacing rings the sides of the glass, with a little bit of foam around the edges.  Smell is perfectly aged, hint of oak and anise, with a gigantic roasted quality. A great booze on the finish adds a dryness that works with everything.  Taste is thick and malty, though not as complex as the smell. Still tons of flavor, bits of anise and huge alcohol bite. The hops are still there, enhanced by a kick from the alcohol.  Mouthfeel is outstanding, thick and viscous, it coats the palate with huge malt flavor.  Drinkability is very good considering the intense flavors and abv.  Overall, a monster of a beer, and one of the classics. A little more age won't hurt this beer a bit.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,96
147,1160,glid02,4.55,"Got the 2007 version at the GA release.  Pours completely black with a one-finger tan head that dissipates into a thin ring around the glass. Some lacing, but not very much.  Smells very nice. Lots of roasted malts with a bit of breadiness.  Tastes great. Malty up front, both roasted and sweet that segues seamlessly into a great chocolate flavor and ending with a mild bitterness, just enough to leave me wanting more. Warming on the way down, but other than that there's no hint of the high ABV.  Mouthfeel is great as well. There's a solid thickness with lively carbonation that brings out all the flavors.  Drinkability is great. I could very, very easily have more than one of these. The flavors are all big, and they are all amazing.  Overall this is certainly in the top tier of RIS's.

147,1160,spointon,4.6,"I poured this one from a 22oz brown bomber bottle into an imperial pint glass.  A= This stout poured jet-black in my glass. No light could penetrate this one. The head was dark tan, slightly creamy, and started at 1"". Within 2 minutes it was down to 1/8"" and eventually dropped to a skim. Some minor lace down the glass.  S= I found aromas of dark chocolate, mild roasted coffee beans, sweet malts, and mild alcohol.  T= This stout stared off with flavors of chicory, molasses, sweet bready malts, and cocoa. That was followed by a slight roasted grain bitterness and faint hops. Alcohol only comes forth briefly in the finish. Though I usually hate the word smooth in a beer review, this was truly the first beer I have found worthy of that descriptor. All flavors in balance, everything well done.  MF=Definitely a heavy beer, with a thick and robust body. The carbonation was equal to the task of lifting this heavy bitch and making it dance on the tongue. A real tongue-coater for sure.  D= Wow this was a crazy good beer. After trying and loving some of their hoppy stuff, this one solidifies Stone as easily one of my top 10 breweries in the US.

A one plus finger chocolate head rose from the liquid and lingered long into the drink.  S: It was a mass of complex flavors including chocolate, burnt malts, molasses and plums. As it warmed the chocolates differentiated into bitter and dark chocolate flavors that teased my nose.  T: This is a coffee and chocolate lovers dream. The coffee hits the tongue first...it remained me of my first attempt to drink Turkish coffee. It was thick, sticky and bitter. Then the chocolate came forward. It was like drinking straight form the Hershey's dark chocolate bottle. There were also plenty of dark fruits.  M: It was thick, creamy and smooth. It had little carbonation and finished warm and clean. THere was a small bitter aftertaste.  D: It was smooth, despite its inherent bitter coffee flavors. It is too heavy and has too high an ABV to be a session beer but it is a wonderful taste treat.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,96
147,1160,hoppymeal,4.17,"Spring 06 release. Pours black with a nice coffee and cream colored head. Very nice aroma of ripe fruit, some raisins and prunes, also some caramel and chocolate, some alcohol evident in the nose as well. Hints of some ageing to with a bit of leather, smoke and meatiness in the aroma, though they are subtle and contribute to a very complex and enjoyeable aroma. Taste follows with a good dose of chocolate sweetness, some roasty smokiness towards the finish, and a bit of a bourbony alcohol bite in the finish. Some of the leather is also noticeable in the taste. Mouthfeel is medium to heavy in body, somewhat syrupy up front, though not heavily so, and it is broken up by some bitter roastiness and alcohol warmth. Age has been good to this one and it could probably go a few years longer. The aroma is very delicious and quite complex, the taste doesn't quite live up to the aroma's promise but is very good nevertheless.

There is a tiny hint of hop flavor, bitterness is low. Mouthfeel is creamy, rich, with nice, low carbonation levels. Very little alcohol apparent for such a high ABV brew.

After about 10 minutes, I started getting the hint of an asian brown sauce or hibachi sauce after the first swallow. Would be great along side some sushi.

Taste is strongly of coffee, chocolate, burnt sugar, and a hint of anise and grape. Finishes with a little bitterness, a lot of burnt flavor, and a touch of alcohol. Definitely improves as it warms, with the chocolate and coffee flavor becoming more pronounced while the alcohol becomes less noticable.  I was not expecting the sheer depth of this beer.

147,1160,JoeMayo,4.47,"I enjoyed a bunch of these fresh when they came out in early spring and was surprised to find how different it was after only five months. At first I was a little disappointed in the change, but as the beer warmed, it definitely grew on me.  A- Pours thick and black with a rich tan head  S- The first thing to hit my nose was rum, which was definitely NOT there 5 months ago. Coffee, chocolate, and raisins also make their way through.  T- Very different from the first time I tried it and I almost wish that I had reviewed it fresh. It's complexity is still there, but the flavors are quite different. Very malty, but not as sweet as you would think. Bittersweet chocolate and coffee come through with a slight flavor of dark fruits, raisins, and very mild licorice.

147,1160,josiahschlender,4.38,"This one laid away didn't last long. I've got one left in the cellar, maybe it'll stick around longer to see how it changes with a little age. I had one of these fresh, and now this has aged a few months.  Appearance is great. I love the badass Stone bottles. Upon pouring into a pint glass, the color is utterly black with a great cocoa cap. molasses sweetness, maybe some sweet dark fruits? Definitely some alcohol. I also think I detect some resinous, nectar hops.  Very intense and complex flavors, dialed for the style. Definitely noting a lot of dark chocolate, and rich roastiness from the malts. Big bitter finish, Stone poured a lot of hops in this one... I get a little earthiness that I think is coming from the hops, too. Also noticed some alcohol heat with raw vanilla. Not as much as I remember from the fresh bottle a few months ago, though.  Feel is substantial and smooth. Impy stouts could almost always have more body in my opinion, but this has plenty of oomph to match the flavors. I like how the thickness coats my mouth and disperses the long finish, lasting a great while after a swig.  I think a few months improved this excellent beer, and am hopefully that a few more will make it all the better. Not a bad price, and it's drinking frightfully easy. Another excellent brew from Stone, well done.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,96

This bomber is toast!  Pulled a bomber out of my new beer cellar (birthday gift from the best wife in the world) and poured into a glass at exactly 55 degrees...  Black. No blacker than that. Black. I actually went outside to hold this up to the sunlight and the sunlight cringed, bent around this black hole just like Einstein said. Ridiculously thick mocha head. Without trying. Like whip cream on hot cocoa. This beer is a physical specimen.  Smell of coffee beans and coffee. Not as strong as anticipated. My fault.  Taste is pretty nice. Lots of coffee, slight taste of alcohol. **Edit: after warming up even more, nice tastes of chocolate emerged**  Rich, thick, creamy, why the hell was I afraid of this? I think the wonderful 10.8 is hidden extremely well. Like baileys in coffee (an old friend). My first 5.0 for mouthfeel.

The taste had the chocolate malt back bone with a good coffee bitterness. I also got the vanilla, oak and good dose of alcohol.

Sweet chocolate with hints of caramel and cherry to begin, followed by a less sweet dark chocolate and coffee finish. A hop profile in the background balances the beer nicely.

Know I see what everyone has been talking about. Definately a great beer! I would not want to drink more than a glass or two at a time as it was a very powerful force - both in alcohol (which was masked superbly), and in character (malt, hop, and otherwise).  I poured mine into a trappist glass and the head was an amazing dark tan. It pours much like an oatmeal stout, which was surprising seeing as how it is so high in alcohol.  The smell was clean and malty with a light hint of the alcohol to come.  The taste and mouthfeel really cannot be described, but since I have to it was an over the top malt, hop, and alcohol trio.  I wouldn't consider this a sessionable beer by any means, but it went down more smoothly than any stout I have had thusfar - and I love stouts of all kinds. Will I buy this beer again you ask? I have already made plans to do so!",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,96

The head faded slowly leaving lots of sticky lacing around the glass. Aroma is roasted malt and just a bit of chocolate and coffee. Aroma seems kinda subdued to me.  Taste is pretty good. Lots of roasted malt and sweet milk chocolate up front, with a hint of cherry. Plenty of bitter dark chocolate and roasted coffee in the finish. Bitter aftertaste that lasts for awhile. Solid hop profile underneath all that. Slight alcohol noticeable in the taste.  Feel is very smooth and creamy. Just the right amount of carbonation. Full body but not too thick. Drinkability is pretty good for such a big beer. The alcohol stays fairly hidden. Really good, but I don't think I could handle much more than 22 ounces.  Pretty good beer. I don't think it's as massive or grand as the text on the bottle make it out to be. But it is a very, very good RIS. I'll definitely have to find another to hold onto for awhile.

Some nice roasted malts with a good chocolate note. Cereal and grain also available.  Taste is ok. Definitely a big maltiness with some nice bitter chocolate going on. Kind of grainy which I don't really dig. Pretty boozy, decent but is not deserving of 15th best beer in the world IMO!  Mouthfeel is full bodied, thick and syrupy. Lightly carbonated.  Drinkability is moderate. decent flavor makes this beer enjoyable to consume, but it's rather boozy right now which really slows consumption.

Good thick head, some of the darkest I've seen, settles quickly, almost no lacing.  Aroma is rich and malty with a faint red wine/bourbon sweetness.  Flavor is amazing! It's sweet to start with strong bitterness coming up before a dry finish. It has those typical roasted coffee and dark chocolate flavors but also has a unique port and cherries background. As it warms, there's more of the sweetness and fruit. Lots to enjoy here. It makes me want to try it back-to-back with the Stone 12th Anniversary because of the chocolate and coffee they have in common.  Mouthfeel is good and the drinkability is great considering the style.

Hop bitterness on the finish. Medium to light on the body side given the style and gravity of the beer. Finishes with a drying hop and roast bitterness. Minimal alcohol noticeable. Way more well rounded that I thought going in- very well balanced and well crafted.

147,1160,kinger,4.74,"Spring 2006 edition, I wanted to let this cellar longer but to be honest it never stood a chance I had to open this up and try it. Pours pitch black into my imperial pint glass reminds me of motor oil, very slick and thick. Large brown head that soon becomes nothing and leaves no lacing I expected this due to the very high abv. Aroma is fantastic blending sweet malts, dark roasted malts, licorice, and even smells like plums and raisins. The aroma also gives off an insanely strong alcohol presence. Mouthfeel is perhaps the best I've ever experienced, this is the fullness and thickness I've been looking for and a smooth finish to boot you can almost feel the alcohol evaporate before you ultimately swallow. Flavor is phenominal sweet fruity yet dark and bitter. Two opposites clash but yield a wonderful taste, if only that strong alcohol wouldn't kick so hard this is near perfect especially for this style. The licorice and dark fruits also repeat themselves in the taste. Surprisingly sweet and smooth this is nice on the palate, overall a truly wonderful creation.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,96
147,1160,Hoagie1973,4.55,"Holy freakin crap! Poured jet black. Usually even the darkest stouts have some red around the edges. This stuff had nothing! Just a black abyss of goodness with a thick, sticky, coffee-with-cream colored head. Didn't even have to raise the glass to my nose before smelling the rich chocolate malt. Upon further olfactory inspection there was a touch of molasses, anise and faint alcohol, also a hint of dog biscuit???? (sounds wierd, but I just report the facts). Flavor was like getting hit in the mouth with a sack of roasted malt. Sweet and flavorful with plenty of chocolate, molasses, caramel, and a slight fruitiness. Alcohol was present, but dangerously subdued for 10.8% ABV. Hops are barely perceptible, but not even missed; too much else going on here. Mouthfeel is incredibly smooth, thick, & full. Creamy and heavy. Not for the Coors Light drinking beer wuss for sure. This stuff is just rediculous. It costs almost 9 bucks for a 22 ouncer, and I don't even care.

When the 07 came out I bought a case and after the fact wished I would have bought more. I bought 3 cases of the 08 release.  The 07 is excellent, the 08 is good but maybe it needs more time to age in the bottle. It's very rich but surprisingly smooth. The aroma smells like chocolate, coffee, dark roasted grains, and alcohol. The head is full and thick and is a dark brown. This is a great special occasion beer, I try to drink one every month or two.  One 22 oz bottle is quite intoxicating.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,96
147,1160,Buebie,4.06,"Got this in a trade from JasonA, thank you.  Poured from a 22 oz brown bomber into a tasting snifter. Not at all transparent, black with no glow from the edges. 3 finger clumpy fluffed brown creamy head. Thick sticky laceing on the glass. Award winning retention, led me to give a 5.0 in appearance. Bottle has a printing of spring 2008 release. Nice looking lable, good reading on the back, expensive looking screen print on the bottle.  Bittersweet chocolate malt dominates the smell, with some alcahol fumieness, not as detactable had I not known the abv. Mild coffee scent, mixed with a dairy like cream smell. Pruny like raisin scent, sweet dense chocolate cake, smoked maple syrup?  Taste is outta this world, with dominating bittering chocolate grains, mixed with a sweet chocolate malt character too. Through initial gulp and into the middle sweet and condensed milk, piney hops through the swallow and into the finish with a hop bitter lingering well. Medium carbonation zing, but not at all overpowering. Thick mouthfeel and creamy silky smooth.  This was one fine brew, to have brewed this must not have been cheap. Not the thickest creamiest full bodies RIS, but the flavor of this was up there with the best. I really enjoyed that piney hop finish, very good brew guys. I only wish you offered yourselves to Minnesota. I'd buy this by the case as the bottle suggests.  Edit: Its now about an hour and a half later without any other beer, and this beer being my only one in 30+ hours. I would say I'm intoxicated, this is one sneaky brew.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,96
147,1160,throwitallaway,4.32,"This review applies to the 2004 vintage of Stone RIS. Picked up Saturday from Stone. Decanted from the growler into a snifter. Pours extremely dark with a small head that fizzles away quickly. Aromas of chocolate, alcohol, and plums. Smells more like an old ale than a RIS. Taste is chocolate, coffee, and a touch of alcohol. The taste in general is smoother and less sharp than younger Stone RISs. Mouthfeel is fairly thick and because of the age it has, this RIS is more drinkable than most. Overall, four years of age seemed to have done this brew some good.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,96
147,1160,THEBEERBAR0N,4.9,"This Stone RIS was enjoyed from a 220z bottle poured into a snifter.  The appearance on this brew is like looking into the darkness of a night sky- it looks well worthy of the respect demanded by the gargoyle depicted on the bottle. The head is a rich tan-brown, rocky and creamy. The lacing is like a geological substrate sample- thick and readible.  The smell is outstandingly rich and complex- dates and dark chocolate jut out prominently but are followed by honestly more than my humble nose can sniff out... a round creamy, dark fruit/roasty edge is lurking in there.  Tastewise, outstanding. It changes in character throughout each taste- starting like rich dark fruits but quickly getting a thick roastiness with a creamy edge coupled with a warming alcohol taste which is intertwined quite well with the character of the brew.  Mouthfeel is smooth and silky with only the faintest hit of carbonation. This allows the taste to really sit with you for a while- an excellent thing.  Well- define drinkability. Am I going to drink several of these in one afternoon- most likely not. But will I look forward to these as a treat of rich beery goodness? Most certainly. Not a session beer, but rather something that lends itself to contemplation.  One of the best dark beers I have ever had.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,96
147,1160,neenerzig,4.82,"Reviewed from notes.  One of my most favorite beers ever, and on-tap too! The 2008 batch I believe. I was quite thrilled to see this indeed. Served in a snifter. This beer is a very dark brown, almost black color that lets in to light at all. The tan, brown head is about 1/2 inch thick when drawn from the tap. Eventually settles to a thin tan ring lining the inside of the glass and a thin surface covering. Decent lace. Aromas of roasted malt and coffee, chocolate, hops and maybe caramel are all present. Sweet chocolate and malt flavors, along with strong hints of bitter roasted coffee, rounded out with a nice touch of hop bitterness. the hops are there indeed, but they don't wallop you in the face like they do with many of Stone's other beers. Even in the bottle version of this the hop presence was a bit more up front than it is here. Simply fantastic. As my good friend Jon Passow (imaguitargod) says ""This is a beer that is so good that you can drink it in bed and it will lull you to sleep."" No disagreement here. Great balance of flavors overall. A bit more balanced here than in bottles, at least when it is fresh, aged may certainly a different story. Has a nice smooth, creamy, frothy mouthfeel with a full body and moderate carbonation. The most drinkable 10.8% ABV beer I have ever had! I want an everlasting keg of this on-tap in my house.  Eric",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,96

Really, really late in the aftertaste it seems the water profile isn't as clean as say, Nogne. It took a while for the alcohol to show through. It's more a mouth evaporation thing rather than flavor or hotness.

T- The taste was very much like the smell, the roasted malts coming though, the anise blended in with a chocolate taste, it is just delicious all around.

The beer is a motor oil thick black hole from which no light can escape, even when held directly to a light. A dark tan, creamy head sits atop the brew, two and a half fingers thick with pretty good retention, leaving rings all the way down the glass after every sip.  Smell: Dark chocolates and sweet, milky coffee come together to create a rich and intoxicating aroma. A bit of roastiness that is also slightly burnt rounds things out in the aroma.  Taste: Nice introduction to the tastebuds with the flavor of real hot chocolate. Big coffee-like roastiness also comes through. Has a bit of vanilla in the middle, along with a nice hop bite to keep things in check. Creamy caramel comes though for a moment. Finishes with a bit of dark chocolate, as if I just took a bite from a bar of Godiva and just let it melt in my mouth.  Mouthfeel: Thick, heavy, rich, and full-bodied. Creamy throughout the mouth and finishing sooo smoothly. Awesome.  If it's this good now, what would it be like with even just a touch of age on it?

The brew is creamy & smooth, but too heavy to be easy to drink. The heavyweights in this category, for me, bely their dark nature & drink light. This is heavy, & without a lot of the richness & complexity that I love in a fine RIS.  Especially after having some other Stones, I'm disappointed; I was really looking forward to this one. It's a decent enough RIS, but I was looking for more.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,96

147,1160,JRed,4,"Hypnotic dark black in body with fleeting mocha head. Subtle aroma of chocolate, roast, dirt, coffee beans. This beer does not hide from you, it tells you with a calm, straightforward voice that it means business and it wants your soul. Heavy body oozing with chocolate, coffee, roast, alcohol burn, hop bitterness towards the finish, dark fruit tang and burning wood. If you are into stouts look no further, this is the messiah who's come to Earth to free us all. A biting stout. Prepare to enjoy a nice steak and sit by the fireplace for a few hours with this brew.

147,1160,brewandbbq,4.32,"Vintage 2008  Pours opaque black, with a half inch head of brown foam that arose with a stretch pour. Errant dots of lacework and a few smears of froth in between sips, along with a partial skim coat.  Aromatics are laced with dark chocolate, roast coffee, nougat, and roasted barley. A slightly sweet and herbal note rounds out the nose.  Thick and chewy mouthfeel with a creamy body.  The pallet leads off with a heft of resinous hops under all the char and roast. Heaps of bakers chocolate, espresso, and reduced caramel. Bitter, drying, and rich. Alcohol is warming but hidden.  Finishes with lingering choco-roast, dark roasted coffee, and a hint of Kahlua.  A great example of the style, but it leaves me wanting more complexity.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,96

The taste is very smooth with almost all the hot notes gone. I really love this brew. I do think its hot fresh (still great though) and needs aging. With 4 years its phenominal. The sweet taste of chocolate and malt with no hops make this a great, great brew!  Its very nice on the tongue too. Its not to heavy and very drinkable. All in all very very nice  Overall, this has to be my favorite aged brew right now, and at 4 years not to hard to duplicate!

It had a sweet chocolate and coffee aroma, which I thought was a little subtle. The coffee came through more in the taste. Chocolate was there also, and the subtlety of the aroma vanished into a richly rewarding beer. A very drinkable beer, despite the high ABV.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,96
147,1160,MakeMischief,4.85,"2008 Bomber  The appearance alone made me want to give this tasty brew a whack. opaque as all get out with a lively action when poured, I was very surprised with the loose head that came up with it (though that was not an indication of its mouthfeel in the least).  Roasted chocolate smell hits right away with this brew and lends itself fairly sweetly into a fruitful aroma.  definitely a deep tasting stout really heads into the chocolate roast taste head on. The caramel rolls off this roasted taste and touches on the ripened fruit side of the stout with a biting anisette flavor. incredibly well balanced deliciousness in this bottle.  The mouth feel is exactly what you'd expect from a stout of this caliber, medium carbonation- enough so that one takes the alcohol heat harmoniously with the taste. Smooth as silk.  Drinkability in my opinion rests with the drinker's taste. Personally a mellow bite coupled with a respectable abv is paramount when tasting a RIS. It was served completely smooth. Creamy may not be the correct adjective to describe the feel but silky may be more correct. Silky and thick and dominantly smooth going down.

Smell is incredibly robust and really complex. I can smell it as I'm pouring it before I get my nose even remotely close. It has coffee, dark bakers chocolate, roasted malt, dark fruit like raisins and dates. Really nice.  Taste is equally as exceptional - lots of coffee, chocolate, and roasted malt. Dark fruits again, and there is quite a bit of fruity hop flavor, too. Nice sweetness of chocolate and molasses. Finishes roasty with some hop bitterness. There is just a bit of alcohol heat to remind you that this has some strength to it.  Mouthfeel is very rich, chewy, full bodied, creamy and smooth. Incredibly drinkable, too.

Seems to have ""legs""  A- Roasted malts, coffee, slight sweet almost fruity aroma as well.  T- Very rich malty taste, with lots of roasted malt flavor. Coffee flavors and slight hints of chocolate. There is a slightly noticeable taste of alcohol as well. The faintly fruity nose starts showing it's face as the beer gets warmer, but is still very faint.  M- Medium-full body with low carbonation. Not as thick and creamy as I expected. Definite alcohol warming.  D- Long ago I had a RIS when I knew little of beer besides fizzy yellow stuff. Having this again years later is amazing.

A dark chocolaty beer and the coffee really comes out as it warms. Pour it cooler and let it warm. Some dark fruits in the nose as it warms, not as much in the taste though - possibly covered by richer flavors. Lots of dark roasted malts. Some hops add a nice bitterness to the mix, but never come close to taking over. Woody touch with hits of vanilla. Not as creamy as it could be, but still nice on the mouthfeel. Lighter body than I thought, but still definitely not light by any standards - it is an RIS after all. Suprisingly easy to drink. Alcohol comes out just a tiny bit the warmer it gets, but is still suprisingly well covered at 10.8%.

Smells of roasted malts, some chocolate and alcohol. Taste is the sma but well put together. You can taste different flavors all separately but they work together very well.

Aroma: Chocolate malts and roasted coffee beans.  Taste: Very strong but so good. Coffee and chocolate flavors up front, becoming more chocolatey in the middle. The finish is dark chocolate, lingering nicely with a slight alcohol warming.  Mouthfeel: Full bodied, thick, almost syrupy but still very smooth. The carbonation balanced well.

Mouthfeel: Roasty and bitter like coffee with a decent amount of chocolate in the mouthfeel. Tastes well balanced.  Drinkability: Very drinkable and you wouldn't be able to tell that it's 10.8%. Deceptive. It's also well-balanced and a decent sipper. If you're looking for a decent imperial stout, you can't go wrong with this.

147,1160,CrellMoset,4.23,"2007 vintage, on tap at the Innsbrook Capital Ale House in Richmond, VA.  Appearance: A one-and-one-half finger chocolate head with nitro-esque, pinprick bubbles. It sits upon the opaque, black-as-night brew immobile, regal. Almost like that neat cossack hat, perched atop the gargoyle on the bomber label for this gorgeous-looking beer. There may be carbonation, but who has any clue? You sure can't tell from looking at it. The lacing is hefty, three-dimensional, and sticks to the sides of the glass in big, wet globs.  Aroma: Deep Viennese roast coffee dominates here ... perhaps even deeper than Viennese, because there's some definite char in some places. Licorice, dark currants, bitter chocolate, notes of lighter caramelized malts, toffee-esque, and other estery, woody notes, almost like it had been oak-aged. Very, very complex.  Taste: Do I taste both chocolate and vanilla in this? Like a mix cone! Almost makes me miss suburbia and its buffets. Anyways, deep roasted astringencies are present but aren't harsh, molasses is thick but not dominating, warming alcohol that blends almost perfectly into the body of the beer is hidden so well, and a host of other great flavors fade in and out of the foreground - currants, toffee (as things warm), other fruity notes, anise, and smooth hop bitterness. A really masterful blend.  Mouthfeel: I feel like I'm always giving 5.0s on mouthfeel - am I just a sucker for a silky beer? Maybe so. This one deserves it though, with an incredibly creamy and even head that stays as round and solid up front as it does throughout. Like swallowing a pillow, although much less unpleasant than that sounds.  Drinkability: Ha, had to knock this one somewhere, and here only for the high alcohol content, nearing 11%. A sweet sipping beer, perfect with dessert or after dinner, but one to be wary of. You will get sucked in by the complexities and sheer deliciousness. It's that good.  This is a painfully good beer, both in the way you'll feel next morning if you're not careful and in that there will never enough of it around. One of the better RISs I've had the pleasure of trying. Highly recommended.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,96

147,1160,jbphoto88,4.8,"Pours a dark velvety brown, with a nice hearty viscosity. A chocolate colored head mounds and rises above the beer a full inch. Rocky bubbles and creamy froth dissipate to a thick collar and some scattered oil coated bubbles. It might be because of the dark and thick characteristics but this beer feels heavier (by weight) then most. Its not a struggle to lift the glass to my lips but it is a little beefier then others.  Smell is bittersweet chocolaty and of heavenly roasted malts. There is a hint of coffee beans and a deep rum fruit nose.  Taste mimics the scents except the malts dominate the flavors with the chocolaty, coffee-ness delicately backing them up. The malts do not eclipse the hops, there is a moderate bitterness to the tongue and a lovely astringency in the finish. The mouthfeel is fantastic. Its smooth and creamy which coats the palate with rich flavors. There is a light chalkiness associated with the aftertaste but it is light and not distracting.  A must try. This is a fine beverage that has great personality. I love the big flavors, thickness, large scents and wonderful warmth. I'm now angry that they don't sell this in my state.

Poured a thick solid black with a tan fluffy head.  Smells like roasted malts, chocolate, and smoke.  Taste is impressive. First off, with the ABV at almost 11, you'd expect to taste the alcohol, but you don't. The flavor is dominated by dark chocolate and roasted malts, hints of coffee, brown sugar, and molasses are also present. The best part is that the flavor is a bit different every time you try it and it goes amazingly well with barbecue.  Mouthfeel is heavy and thick, not overly carbonated but you can tell its there. Very sharp and carying in its flavors.  Drinkability here is good, this beer has quite a bit of characther and is on par with beers like Dark Lord for sure.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,96
147,1160,callmescraps,3.35,"Just barely went for this over the Souther Tier Cherry Saison, mostly because I wanted to try something new. Not always my favorite style, but most reviews are glowing.  Appearance - Poured thick, and black. It almost looked like molasses pouring in there. Topped by a half inch of hearty, coffee-colored head.  Smell - Definitely smell the roast, almost like coffee, but also something like toasted marshmellows and a little raisin.  Taste - Roasted malts with quite a bit of coffee-ish bitterness. A small hint of those raisins, and a boozy aftertaste. Yet, the biggest disappointment may be that it seemed a little weak. Just, a little something missing. It's more or less what I expected BEFORE I smelled it. After smelling, I had hopes of a more complex beer.  Mouthfeel - Pretty disappointing. I figured a creamy goodness, but there was a lot less here than expected. Smooth, but just sort of disappears.  Drinkability - The mouthfeel makes it easier to drink, but it's still heavy in taste. Not bad for the style, but I find it hard to throw down a couple stout's, no matter how good. Although for the abv, it's pretty smooth.  Weaker in taste than some stout's, and also lighter. No creamy goodness, but some malty coffee-ish vibe. This isn't always my favorite style, but occasionally I find ones that I really enjoy. This wasn't one of them.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,96

The taste has dark roasted malts, with a slightly metallic flavors, and a pretty boozy finish. The mouthfeel is smooth and creamy, but is a little thinner than expected. Overall, I am a little disappointed in this offering. There is no question that it is a solid beer, but I think that it is extremely over hyped here on BA. It is just too boozy for me, I have had many other RIS's with a higher ABV that hide the alcohol much better. Worth a shot? Definitely. Will I buy it again? Probably not.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,96

Smell - Roasted Malt, chocolate, and coffee are the most prevelant scents. Some sweetness as well.  Taste & Mouthfeel - Bitter and sweet. Pretty thick but traditional to the style. Great smooth flavor. Slightly sweet, bitter, and roasted taste. Some alcohol but not enough to kill everything else. This is bad ass!  Drinkability - Loved this from the minute it hit the lips.

Appearance - Pours a thick syrupy molasses colored dark black. Head was a half finger thick, and was a tan light milk chocolate color. A nice tan halo hangs around all the way through the end of the beer.  Smell - Bitter roasted coffee and an alcohol bite, with dark currants and chocolate sweetness present as well.  Taste & Mouthfeel - Very bitter and syrupy in the front. A sweetness came through more and more as it warmed, but the roasted bitterness set up camp all the way through. Alcohol scratches at the mouth with a fury, but the sweet smoothness swings things back in check. Black currants leave a fingerprint, but don't overpower.  Drinkability - Found it to be a little harsh at first, but calmed down nicely and balanced as it warmed.

147,1160,ASymon13,4.83,"2008 release.  This beers pours a thick viscous black with a nice fluffy chocolate head to it that leaves some decent lacing as the head recedes. Not even a shimmer of light gets through it. Awesome. There is a lot of dark chocolate in the nose with some very solid smokey roast thrown in. The nose really is huge, with those two notes dominating. The alcohol is hardly even noticable, and I really can't catch any hops to it.  The first sip is dominated by those two flavors; chocolate and roastiness. My two favorite flavors common to the style. There is some decent hop bitterness but it works well, complementing the malts and not overpowering them at all. There is no underlying sweetness to it like some RIS's, so it has a nice dry finish. The alcohol is noticable but it also complements everything nicely. The body is thick and creamy and the carbonation works perfectly for the style.  While this is less complex than many RIS's I've had, that does not detract anything from it. The flavors blend together so beautifully that it is easily one of my very favorites.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,96

T- a complexity that goes beyond words... starts of strong malts with mildly sweet molasses giving way briefly to a moderate level of alcohol that gets buried in a resolving finish of dark chocolate covered malts... this one gets better and better through the entire glass.  M- fulfilling, just enough carbonation to ease the journey.  D- I think I may have started feeling it half way through the bottle on this warm and humid evening, but was ready for another shortly after finishing the first... good thing I only had one bottle around or I may have had my wife calling me an alcoholic.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,96
147,1160,paco1029384756,3.68,"Pour is black with a small tan head and a thin ring of lacing.  Smell strong roasted malts, slight coffee, with prunes and a hint of raspberry.  Taste is bitter with prunes, hops, and alcohol apparent initially, some sugars come in and fade quickly into an alcohol taste, finishing with strong, bitter malts and coffee.  Mouthfeel is clean and biting, powerful.  Drinkability is good taking the strength into consideration.  To be honest, I was disappointed by this beer. Too much alcohol in the taste makes it unbalanced, and although it does work in some cases, it is too overpowering here.  Update: 2007 bottle sampled thanks to vwcraig; it's pretty much the same, just subdued alcohol, which is the only benefit to aging.

Slightly alcoholic in the aftertaste and pretty warming.  M: A very thick mouthfeel, but the carbonation was perfect and it was smooth as silk.  D: A fairly drinkable beer. The stuff is very thick and can fill you up quickly just because of that.

Taste of roasted, smoky molasses, sweet spice, cooked tar, charcoal, nuts, coal, brick, earth and prune. I have seen some comments on an overly alcohol profile but I didn't sense it, at least in comparison to some other Russian Imperial Stouts. Yes, the alcohol is there and will kick your ass, but this didn't have the brandy/whiskey notes that overpowered the overall experience.

I sense the alcohol confuses the brain here. A nice aroma, but not a lot of variety in the nose.  Taste is smooth but a bit too rich with an unexpected bitterness in the finish.

147,1160,everetends,4.04,"A 22oz bomber thanks to Redwood21. Poured into a tulip for review number 100.  A: Poured a pitch black, with a super thick consistency, even had some minor chunky splashes. Got a nice medium brown head that receded to a mocha ring that stayed for the entire brew, leaving nice sticky lacing. The beer leaves a nice yellow-black slick on the glass. The are visible particles in the brew. All in all, a beautiful looking beer.  S: Smell of the beer was a little disappointing. I got some roasted malt, dark chocolate,caramel, slight notes of coffee and nuts. The suprising thing about this beer was that the hops note really comes out in this nose. Totally not expected.  T: This beer does not have the amazingly complex tastes that some RIS's have. It does have the deeply roasted malt, dark chocolate, cream, caramel and a touch of coffee. Yet again suprising is the very notable presence of hops in this brew. Don't know how I feel about that.  M: Chunky and thick, just as it should be. Coats the mouth and really allows you to taste everything this beer has to offer. A slight bitter aftertaste rolls down your tongue. Very nice.  D: This is a drinkable brew. I do not find this beer as complex and awe inspiring as other RIS's I have had. With that said, it does represent well what an RIS should be even if it doesn't have the complexity, and although nothing is too amazing about the taste and nose, you can't find anything wrong with what it offers. A fine example of the style.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,96

T: Roast and chocolate up front. Hints of black licorice which I hate but somehow works in this. Again never got it out of the bottle. Ends very sweet and leaves a nice sweetness on the lips.  M: Super creamy. Love a good nitro tap. Super full body.  D: I had two pint of this animal that night. I love this beer. The one thing I will say is that the fresh keg tasted like a bottle with about a year on it. I could literally drink this till my liver turned to stone.

S- roasted malts, caramel, pale malts that totally define a RIS... light alcohol in the nose, not over bearing though just enough to give you that reality check.  T- a blend of roasted bitterness, sweet malts and slight alcoholic burn are all rounded out by a ever so light hop presence. Wonderful balance to such an 'uber' beer.  M- thick and chewy just like a RIS should be. This one stands up to the rest.  D- ever so smooth and balanced. This could replace an old favorite.

Pours black with a boozy, malty aroma. Little head and lacing. Flavour is full and thick as it coats the throat. Alcohol is noticeable, but particular flavours such as coffee or chocolate are not. Enough hops to try to balance things out, but not hop forward. Not particularly impressed - and I'm a big Stone fan and a pretty decent imperial stout fan.

Dark, bitter chocolate smells -- like baking chocolate.  Flavors absolutely define what an Imperial Stout is to me. Giant, bold roasted malt flavors. Thick creamy body. The stoutest of the stout. You could imagine them diluting this stuff 10:1 to make Guinness. Extraordinarily creamy start builds into that huge roasty malt punch. Solid dark chocolate, coffee, and dark fruit flavors through the middle. Hugely complex. Bitter finish with a faint sweetness.  Body completely fills your mouth with flavor. Thick and creamy... hangs out forever, which in this case, is a great thing. Almost like eating a chocolate mousse.  Drinkability? 10 point what percent? Bah!

Also, interestingly, there's a sourness that I associate with older fruit.  Strong roasted barley flavor which defers from the typical coffee flavors. Lots of black patent malt. The aftertaste has some hop, but it's still a mostly dark malt. Appropriate body for the style.  I like this beer, but it isn't my favorite from Stone.

In a word: dessert.  t: Delicious. A complex, bold and rich concoction of chocolate, licorice, plum, coffee, some light bitterness in the finish, but above all else, this is a tribute to the power of heavily roasted malt. As the bottle says, ""It almost seems evil.""  m: thick, heavy, rich, syrupy and just about perfect for the style.  d: Dessert in a bottle. Certainly deserves to be in the top 10 for its style.

Black, tinged brown at the edges, with a medium sized dense tan head that paints the glass with very finely textured lace.  Smells mainly like dark chocolate cake, espresso, chewy grain, very clear raspberry, and a permeative herbal note like perilla with a strong fennel aspect. Also some vague dark fruit a bit like black cherry, and a hint of smoke. Complex and enticing.  Tastes like sweet chocolate and raspberry, with some roasted bitter notes like cocoa and coffee, some hop bitterness, and chewy toasty grain; milder notes of smoke, molasses, and fennelly perilla. It tastes sweeter than it smells, but the bitterness balances the sweetness fairly well. The flavor seems slightly disjointed at first, but becomes grounded and cohesive towards the finish, and almost completely dry. Long dry roasty finish, very tasty.  Full silky texture. Reasonably drinkable.  Great beer, I enjoyed this and look forward to trying it aged.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,96

Smell: Rich chocolate and roasted malts dominate this incredible smell. Alcohol becomes more apparent as it warms, but not in an offensive way. Possibly the nicest smell I have ever had from a beer.  Taste: Chocolate malts to start but well balanced. The roasted taste balances the sweetness of the chocolate very well. There is a slight sourness in the finish. Alcohol is apparent, but not overpowering.  Mouthfeel: Medium to thick almost creamy, body. Not overly carbonated.  Drinkability: Almost an immediate buzz at 10.8%, and certainly a daunting task, but remarkably drinkable.  Truly one of the nicest beers I have ever had.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,96
147,1160,mpyle,4.2,"App - Perfectly opaque, rich tan head with good retention. Head very creamy  Smell - roasty, slightly chocolately. Surprisingly clean and not very complex at first sniff. Some alcohol as it warms, but had to work pretty hard to find it (nicely masked).  Taste - Nicely balanced chocolately maltiness to start. Dark grains and hops keep the sweetness in check. Alcohol flavor at midmouth, but not hot or unpleasant. Finishes with a chocolately alcohol flavor, but not overpowering.  MF - full body and moderate carbonation. Robust warming due to the alcohol, but pleasant and in the style. No astringency.  D'ability - So far, so good. But seriously, it goes down easy for a 10.8% ABV brew. Not the most complex or in your face Imperial Stout, so maybe more drinkable than some.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,96
147,1160,mnj21655,4.32,"22oz. bomber spring 2008 release  Pours pitch black with about a 1/4"" of brown head that quickly fades. Aroma is chocked full of dark fruits, figs, raisins, plums, some light caramel maltiness, a touch of alcohol, and some very faint hoppiness. Flavor is complex with a vinous quality. There is alot going on here, some relatively restrained roastiness and a bit of caramel are first. These flavors are quickly overtaken by dark fruits (figs, raisins, and plums), which give this brew what, in my opinion, is a distinctly vinous feel. Some bitterness enters towards the finish to balance this brew out. The dark fruits linger in the long finish with a touch of roastiness, a noticable but not terribly significant alcohol heat, and a bit of malty sweetness. Mouthfeel is good, full bodied, with low carbonation. This beer appeared to be properly attenuated but at times it seemed a touch syrupy, though not at all sweet. Drinkability is pretty good, I certainly enjoyed it. Its a good representation of this style, complex and interesting but not quite all that I had hoped for. I'd be interested to see how it tastes with a bit of age on it, I think it may change for the better. Overall its a well crafted brew that I'd recommend seeking out. *As a quick note I've had this on tap and enjoyed it immensely so my expectations were pretty high.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,96

147,1160,czfreeman,4.9,"5/15/08 I attended a Stone tasting held at Half-Time beverage in Poughkeepskie,NY. We tried Double Bastard 2005,10th anniv, Old Guardian 2006, and Imperial 2008. This Imperial Stout is truly something to behold. It pours out roughly the same viscosity as used Castor oil, high mileage even! The brew hold about a 1/4 inch tan film for about a minute, before it dissapates into the abyss.  The aroma is of deep cocoa, roasted malts, bitter chocolates, a touch of malts, hazelnut fudge, molasses all cut by a nice bite of Warrior hops. The flavor when I sipped it cold a was pure iced super-thick mocha coffee mouthfull. As it warms to drinking temp,my God! Roasted malts, coffee notes, cocoa, hazelnuts, sorghum molasses, then a perfect balance of alcohol warmth and hop bitterness. The mouthfeel of this beer is truly incredible. Super-rich,thick, yet cut perfectly by the warm alcohol bite and Warrior hop finish. A mouthfull of a hot White Russian is all I can say. I was lucky enough to try it fresh, I reccommend trying one now, and aging a few. As far as appearance,taste, and mouthfeel, this was a perfect Imperial stout. Unleash this Rasputin proudly for the Czar to behold!

147,1160,Ecliptica,2.03,"When I finally saw this for the first time at Julio's Liquors in Westborough, MA I was excited - one of the highest rated beers on BA and not available in Louisiana where I usually am and usually purchase beer. It was an automatic purchase, even at $8.00 a bottle.  Poured the brew in a pint glass that I brought back with me from my favorite bar in New Orleans and the beer poured as expected, a completely opaque black that absolutely refuses to let light pass through it, no ruby tints as with most other Imperial Stouts. This is as black as black can be. The beautiful tan head leaves zero lacing behind.  The smell can best be described as a licorice-laced espresso. There is a hint of fruity esters somewhere in there and it's actually quite complex and quite leading. I don't know why it doesn't taste like it smells.  Although the beer is 10.80% ABV, the only distinguishable taste is the alcohol. I'm getting very little fruit and NO chocolate whatsoever. It tastes almost like soy sauce, leaving the mouth dry and wanting more. . .but certainly not more of this beer.  The beer is nowhere near as thick or as smooth as it should be considering the vigorous pour, and as I mentioned above, there is a quite bitter and sour aftertaste that leaves the palate desiring more liquid and I continued to drink the brew even though I knew I wasn't enjoying it.  Drinkability. . .::sigh::. . .I don't even know. This is probably the second beer I've had in the last couple of months that almost resulted in a drain pour. I'm just left wondering why it's rated so high. . .is it because it's a Russian Imperial Stout? Is it because of the high ABV? Is because the brewery itself is known for producing quality beers (this is the first one that has let me down, FWIW)? I'm just confused, I don't recommend this at all, and between this and the Harviestoun Old Engine Oil (Aged in Malt Whiskey Casks) that I had last week, I've been having pretty bad luck with choosing my beers lately.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,96

The hops don't really show up as they are dominated by the malts. Some alcohol makes its way through.  The ubiquitous ultra bitter malts are there along with a little show from the hops toward the end. Some chocolate makes its way in there as well. Full bodied with good carbonation. The finish is the lingering bitter malts.  This is a great stout but I'm not ready to rave about it. It doesn't offer me anything that all the other RISs have, and falls just below the few that I have truly enjoyed. Still, it's recommended.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,96

Love at first taste. Coffee and chocolate comes through strong, but in the end a taste of malty bitterness sits on the tongue.  Excellent mouthfeel, however not as thick and smooth in the mouth as it looks when poured.  After many tastes and finally having with chocolate, this is officially my favorite beer. Even surpassing my first true love, Guinness. I highly recommend p.s.

The aromas are perfect: smoky, sourish malts mixed with strong fruits (raspberries) and coffee laced hops. I mean the smells are all over the map, but they are so wonderfully complementary that there really is a great unitary aroma. Taste-wise is also excellent with an incredibly savory bitterness that is a combination of coffee, mocha, espresso and wheat flavors. The mouthfeel helps aid in perfecting this beverage by making it very smooth on the palate. Its not light but any standards, but by making it almost milky with a medium carbonation, the flavors are able to express themselves quite well. By far, one of the best drinks I have had. Highly recommend.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,96

Let's start with the new one. Pitch black, oily, with a very dark tan head that holds reasonably well, making a decent amount of lacing for such a high octane brew. Great aroma, with roasted malts, but not burnt, chocolate, coffee, molasses, fruits particularly dark ones. Full bodied as expected, with a low level of carbonation, the taste is all that was expected and more; with licorice, molasses, alcohol, coffee and chocolate, all of them quite strong except for the alcohol, coming and going in great waves without stomping the other. It is mostly malts, but hops make a nice fruity appearance here and there. Incredibly easy to drink, and I cannot wait for the aged one. In the meantime, let me enjoy...  Now for the aged version, Same appearance, a little bit less head. Aroma shows a little bit more alcohol and licorice, as well as chocolate and anise. Carbonations levels are even lower, as expected, but on the palate is even fuller and creamier. Taste has mellowed a bit, the alcohol is more noticeable even though the ABV is lower; there are more roasted malts and chocolate, and little to no hops. It is better, although barely - but then, how can you make this any better? Two masterpieces. If you never had this beer, now is the time.

147,1160,SurlyDuff,4.2,"Waited for a fairly chilly night to crack this.  Pours black with a tan head. Thick like motor oil. Head eventually falls away, just leaving sticky lace.  Huge malty chocolate and coffee aroma.  Deep dark coffe and bittersweet chocolate, then it falls away into a sweet gooey chocolate.  Alcohol presence is disguised by rich dark fruits. Plum and fig. Honey and molassas in there too, syrupy.  Mouthfeel is good, but theres some lactic milky chocolate notes that form an uncomfortable saliva syrup (sorry for being discript). I generally like my Imperials to be a bit dryer and shorter in the finish, just to keep the drinkability up. It does go down smooth and with the alcohol covered up well, makes for an okay drinker. It's just not 100% what I look for in a russian imperial stout.  I'm reviewing this against others in the style, and am not falling pray to BA's IIPA/IStout/Quad syndrome. I'm not going to rate this against a Golden Ale or a hefe, but against other Russian Imperial Stouts.

A little disappointing. Not as good as, say, Abyss, Yeti, or Brooklyn, or even Bourbon County. Closer to a straight stout.

Attractive caramel cap of fine bubbles which thin out a bit but gravitate to the edge of the glass where they leave their mark copiously.  Aroma is roasted and toasted malts and some earthy hops.  Big and bold, imbibing this beer feels more like eating chocolate birthday cake with caramel icing, at least in body. The taste exhibits some of this, but leans more heavily on toast and nuts. Starchy and bready on the finish, the mouthfeel is silky up front.  Butter presents itself on the nose and palate as the beer warms, and with it a more prominent booziness. And this one will have ample time to warm, as it's a very slow sipper. No room for seconds; more like dessert for two.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,96
147,1160,Bejogle,2.29,"Poured from a 22 oz bottle into a snifter.  This beer is opaque black in every sense of the word, with a really impressive, pillowy tan head. The head subsides very quickly, however, and leaves only slight lacing.  The smell was not very interesting really, smelled pretty much like a Guinness if Guinness made malt liquor, lots of hints of fusel alcohol.  The taste was worse than the smell, unfortunately. There is no presence of chocolate or coffee flavors at all in this beer as there are in other RIS'. It tasted pretty much like a mixture of cough syrup and the fusel alcohol i mentioned before. I don't understand where people are getting the complexity.  Mouthfeel was good, thick and oily like a RIS should be, but the taste ruined the experience and therefore the drinkability.  I was hoping it was just a bad bottle but I bought another one and it had the same exact problems. I really really wanted to enjoy this beer because of its high rating, but I'm starting to think it's rated so highly simply because its a seasonal from a reputable brewery and because its so high in ABV. I won't be buying this again, sticking to Old Rasputin.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,96
147,1160,pershan,4.35,"The beer poured a dark, evil, black with a thin brown head into a 12 oz pilsner glass. The smell was of alcohol and roasted malt. The initial flavor was of roasted malt, with a slight black-currant sweetness that faded quickly into an alcoholic, burnt toast and slightly hoppy finish. Fairly low carbonation gave this beer a viscous mouthfeel, but there was still very nice lacing down the inside of the glass. Another fine beer from Stone.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,96
147,1160,calebmills,4.43,First of all this is the 2nd best stout i have tried. second to the rogue chocolate stout. This stuff is amazing i would recommend trying it just as much as any other stone beer. This stuff is very complex and spicy in a way with the high alcohol content but it wont overwhelm you as much as some of the lighter stone beers when i say lighter i mean that this has the highest alcohol that im aware of from stone but it doesnt seem as potent as a double bastard. anyways this stuff pours thick black and has a thick creamy head that tops off the amazing apearance and smells like coffee malt hops and some chocolate. And tastes like this also with some complexities i cant identify but id like to have a couple more bottles to really say for sure. This is heavy stuff for me i dont need more than one bomber at a time to enjoy it and trust me if you like stouts you will enjoy and probably love this one.I only wish i had the money at the time to buy another bottle or two.,Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,96
147,1160,MoJoe,4.63,"2008 Bomber Bottle  A- Pours out a thick, dirty oil black with a dense, dark tan head that leaves a decent amount of lace on the glass.  S- The alcohol is very present along with the scent of roasted malts. A wonderfully complex aroma. Dark roasted coffee, dark fruit, taffy amd vanilla.  T- The sweetness of this beer is perfectly matched with the bitterness. Along with everything that the nose gave you there is also black chocolate, licorice, carmel and toasted oats. The alcohol was again very evident.  M- Very full bodied. The bitterness of the dark roasted malts gives way to there sweetness then the bittering/flavor hops take control.  D- Love this Beer! Wonderfully complex and balanced.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,96
147,1160,macster,4.3,"2007 Vintage. Pours a viscous, thick jet black color. Completely opaque with some burgundy highlights when held up to the light. Pour initially forms a hefty 2"" dense tan head which gradually fades to a wispy coating of foam. Some spotty streaks of lacing as glass is consumed.  Fairly assertive aromas of espresso coffee beans, dark roasted malts, molasses, dark choclate and dark dried fruits waft up from the snifter.  Mouthfeel was moderately full and chewy. Seemed to become much fuller and smooth as the beer warmed.  Flavors were a tad more assertive than the aromas. Starts off on the sweet side with a firm blast of dark rum soaked raisins and figs, dark cocoa, molasses and vanilla. The mid-palate reveals a transformation to a slightly bitter side with notes of burnt malts, espresso coffee, baker's chocolate and a touch of spicy hops. Has a long and pleasant bittersweeet finish with a definitive alcohol warmth.  A solid and well done Russian Impy Stout.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,96
147,1160,GbVDave,4.03,"poured from a 22oz bottle into two 20oz imperial pints. Thanks to HeatherAnn for the assist!  Spring 2008 release.  A: Pours a coal-like, pitch black color with a creamy, dark khaki, three finger head. Huge amounts of lace in the glass.  S: Interesting aromas of molassas, dark fruit, toffee, blackened malt, chocolate, cherry, coffee, and brown sugar.  T: The taste follows the smell very closely on this one. Take everything above and add charcoal, toasted oatmeal, bitter hops, and alcohol.  M: Surprisingly this starts a little on the thin side. However, as it warms it becomes thick and sweet while never losing it's bitter edge.  D: Good drinkability. I found this to be a tad on the overrated side, but it's very good.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,96
147,1160,AKBelgianBeast,4.23,"A good one for review #300! And just by chance too! 2008 vintage.  Pours impenetrably black with a huge tan ice cream head. A bit cold yet, but the nose is weaker than I had expected. What there is is roast and toast malt with some metallic copper alcohol smell. The roastiness comes out as it warms. A bit of coffee and slight hop fragrance. Taste is nice and smooth, roasty malts, coffee, vanilla, and alcohol come to mind, some dark dark malt flavors in here and a nice hop kiss on the finish. Not as hoppy as I would have expected for a stone brew, which is sort of refreshing as they tend to be a little bit obsessed, but still on the hoppy side (barely). A slight metallic astringency to it, and alcohol is a bit more pronounced than I would prefer. Vanilla flavor is apparent enough it has a bourbon aged hint in the middle. The alcohol heat is a bit strong fresh, but should mellow in just a year or two. Mouthfeel is good, but could be a touch more viscous, just a touch. Drinkability is good now, but will should vastly improve with just a little trip to the cellar. Overall a great imperial stout, maybe slightly overrated, but defenitely not one you want to pass up. It is certainly case in the cellar worthy..even if you are not! oh wait, different stone brew...",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,96
147,1160,DefenCorps,4.53,"2008 bottle poured into my Duvel tulip  A: Gorgeous pitch black with a dense brown two-finger head that recedes leaving a nice lacing. Picture perfect  S: A spicy note to start off with - is that the anise they talk about?I Behind that, there's chocolate, coffee, cream, roast, burnt and molasses in a beautiful balance  T: Roasted flavors followed up by a very well balanced chocolate and coffee. There's a definite nutty note to it. There's some spice to it too, almost a hoppy spice.  M: Full bodied, thick and delectable. The finish is a mild burnt bitter and very pleasant.  D: This one will do me in. It's a sipper and excellent for it's style.  **Edit 28 April 2013** I'm drinking a bottle of the 06 IRS tonight, as I anticipate getting my hands on and drinking a bottle of the Espresso IRS later this week (hopefully)  The nose is pretty awesome. Mellow with anise spice, milk chocolate fudge, a great blend of roast and coffee, this does also have a mellow port-like oxidation, which lends a little bit of a red-wine character. The palate opens moderately sweet, with caramel, toffee, tobacco, anise up front, along with some medium-dark chocolate. This just might be heading over the hill, as I'm starting to get a wee bit of papery oxidation/ aged thinness, but it's barely on the threshold of perception (IMO). What this means, though, is that this beer is near its peak. Medium-full in body, moderately carbonated, this is smooth and fluid on the palate. A lingering grainy/roasty bitterness lingers, tempering the sweetness. Excellent. 4.5/4.25/4.25",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,96
147,1160,steelscarab,4.75,"Had my growler filled with the 2006-cellared brew of this at their brewery and I served it in my goblet.  Appearance: An immensely dark black colour, almost obsidian in nature. It poured with a half inch of mocha-coloured head which quickly dissipated. Moderate lacing did persist around the edges though. I would've given this a 5 if the head was retained more.  Smell: A smoky, sweet smell dominates the nose when smelling. A bit of coffee is present as well, but you primarily smell the roasted malts and alcohol.  Taste: Complexity! One can first detect many sweet things in this brew such as a bit of caramel, coffee, roasted malt, and some sort of earthy berry (perhaps raisin). This sweetness leads to a slight bitter smoky taste with a warming alcohol touch to it. An experience for any beer drinker!  Mouth: This brew holds amazing mouth-feel. It is smooth, creamy, and not too much carbonation. I'd say it's just perfect for the style and silky smooth for its alcohol content.  Drinkability: High drink-ability if you are into Imperial Stouts. This is definitely a sipping beer though, and probably not suited for active social gatherings. This may just be one of the best beers for a night in with the old woman and a marathon of CSI.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,96
147,1160,jockstrappy,3.9,"Pours an opaque black color with a creamy tan head. Aromas noticed here are coffee and caramel with a little alcohol in there as well. Taste begins with a classic roasted coffee flavor and a small hop note up front, with a well-rounded balance of chocolate, caramel sweetness on the way back, and finishing with a pleasant alcohol warmth. This brew is pretty heavy....and drinks as such. Syrupy mouthfeel, and somewhat filling....that said, with a 10.8 ABV, one is plenty. Great beer after a nice meal.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,96
147,1160,justinmartz,4.06,"Poured from a bomber into a seidel. This is a big and heavy beer. The color is black like the universe at the beginning of time. The head is a sandy brown color with a diet Coke-like consistency. Audible head reduction: this is a noisy beer! The smell wasn't distinguishable from other fine stouts even though it claims anise and black currants. I don't know, maybe I have cerebral palsy, but I didn't notice those. At 10.8% ABV the alcohol was noticeable in aroma and taste. This beer would benefit from cellaring. Otherwise, it's a perfectly carbonated beer and one of the gnarliest stouts I've ever had.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,96
147,1160,RunawayJim,3.88,"Poured into a snifter. Pours a pitch black with a small dark tan head that lingers for a bit.  Smells of dark roasted coffee and roasted malts.  Taste was a little disappointing. There was a strong metallic taste to it that lasted throughout the bottle. Other than that, there were a lot of roasted coffee bitterness, some dark chocolate notes, and a slight hint of malty sweetness.  The beer was thick and a little oily in the mouth and quite drinkable for a 10.8% ABV beer. There was absolutely no taste of alcohol at all.  Regarding the metallic taste, it also seemed a little rough. I plan on picking up another one and aging it for a while to see how it comes out. I imagine it'll smooth out a bit and hopefully that metallic taste will go away.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,96
147,1160,ElGrecoVerde,3.84,"Finally found this at a small shop by my house. 2008 edition, 10.8% abv.  Pours deep black with a dark brown, creamy head. Looks incredible.  The smell was a bit disappointing. Maybe I overhyped this one in my head. It had the usual roasted coffees and chocolates, but a strong bitter aroma as well. There was a fair amount of dark fruit in the nose as well.  The taste had a highly bitter blend of dark fruit, raisins and chocolate in it. I get images of the California Raisins in my head with each sip. Some roasted flavors try to get through, but the bitterness took over my mouth. Overall, however, it's fine as I love stouts, but I couldn't help feeling a bit let down.  This makes two highly rated Imperial Stouts that didn't exactly blow my socks off. Don't get me wrong, it's an incredible beer, and judging by other reviews, it must just not match my palate. But after being floored by a beer like Rogue Shakespeare Stout (which I realize is entirely different), I'm finding the Imperial Stouts fall behind in my book.  Still, and excellent beer, and I'll keep giving the style more chances.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,96

M = Creamy, full bodied, luscious full coating of the mouth. Perhaps a little too frothy, otherwise close to perfect mouthfeel.  D = Very good drinkability.

147,1160,Maudite,3.81,"One of the better beers I've had from Stone.  A- Very little head, unless I agitated the glass (snifter), and then it was a delicate and rich milk chocolate that waned quickly leaving behind some sticky lacing. The body was as black as motor oil. Or shark's eyes.  S- Surprisingly, not much until it got to room temperature. Upon the initial pour there was a fairly discernible hop aroma. As it warmed it smelled of biter cocoa, iced coffee, very sweet and malty. It also smelled like jam; fruity, thick, sweet.  T- Espresso, roasty, almost smokey, like whiskey but black as pitch, sweet, dark fruitiness. As it warmed the alcohol was much more present and had a pleasant warming effect. There was an almost berry, port-like flavor with a dry, bitter, coffee finish.  M- Thick, sweet, coating, acidic, dextrinous. Not dry in a hoppy, or whit wine/champagne way, but in a coffee way. Definitely present long after swallowed.  D- My wife and I shared a bottle after dinner, and it was awesome. I would definitely drink this again, though not often. It's a strong bugger. I recommend trying it.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,96

The nose brings molasses and dark chocolate, and a brush-up of fruity alcohol. The carbonation is a little harsh in the begining, but the beer mellows out as it warms. The beer becomes sweeter in this case, with a 1-2 punch of choclate and molasses, with a rush of roasted character in the end. The high alcohol level in this one balances out the sweetness of the beer, and it makes this one a sipper.  So this is what a fresh Stone Imperial Russian Stout tastes like.

S- There is a substantial aroma of smoke followed by creamy chocolate, roasted malts, dark fruits, and coffee with some hops in the background. There's also a nice aroma of fresh baked raisin bread, or something similar to that. The alcohol is only slightly noticeable as the beer warms.  T- The roasted malts, coffee and chocolate flavors hit first, followed by a moderate hop bitterness and that same smokiness that was present in the aroma. The alcohol provides a bit of a kick on the dry and slightly bitter finish.  M- Oily and slick with some moderate carbonation bubbles. The mouthfeel is not as thick and rich as I expected it to be.  D- This is very drinkable for 10.8% ABV. The alcohol never gets in the way. However, the smokey flavor of this beer prevents me from wanting to drink a whole bomber.

S: A huge roasted malt aroma on the front, with coffee notes and molasses. A little bit of a dark fruit at the very back of it all, but the other scents battle with it a little. Great to sniff over a few times to pick out specific aromas. (edited the review after another just to up this from 4.5 - 5: some nuttiness and hints of chocolate come through on top of the other features. This is an amazing smelling brew).  T + M: Heavy, thick, and viscous paired with a little shimmer of carbonation in there. A rich malt flavour on the front, definitely roasted grains... followed soon after with a little sweeter prunish like flavour. This is all as it approaches the mid-tongue, where the coffee roast bitterness starts to become more noticable and comes out on the finish. Some dark, Belgian chocolate like flavours floating through there, and upon finish, it leaves a wonderful lingering flavour of it all coming together at once. Lovely.  D: Considering how huge it is, it's very drinkable. I'd like to try aging some as suggested to see how things go, as this is quite a fresh bottle, and I found it to be very smooth already.

147,1160,garydemp,4.73,"I have had 3 bottles of this beer, all were 2005 Vintage, drank between Nov. 07 and Feb. 08. I am lucky to have a local liquor store that has a supply of aged bottles, so I have not had this beer ""new and fresh"".  As for the 3 year old bottles I tried, myself and my 2 brothers unanimously gave it a huge thumbs-up. The first was drank on Thanksgiving day with a large turkey drumstick and appropriate sides. We drank some before dinner, and some with food, and the beer is outstanding either way.  Pours very dark, with nice brown foam. If you pour with some attention the foam will last until the glass is empty, which I find very pleasing.  Nice aroma, with all the things you hope to smell in a strong stout. Flavor does not in any way disappoint, full-flavored, very smooth, nice alcohol but not too pronounced either (perhaps owing to the fact that it was well-aged). Hops noticeable on finish. Very long finish, and due to its high-octane nature, can be enjoyed over a rather long session.  I would advise to share a bomber with a friend or loved one, as you will share a wonderful stouty experience together.  What more can I say, I don't drink stouts all that often, but when you are in the mood for one, you really can't go wrong with this one.

Thick mouthfeel, viscous, but low carbonation. This one was an easy drinker for the style, but the high abv made it a definite sipper.

With a slight baked effovensence. I am also picking up a smoked wood chips/ bacon smell(which is 100% a positive). Slight roasted coffee beans. T:Super dark sweet chocolate. Just a tiny hint of licorice. Also a steely hopiness on the back end. M:Thich, but in a great way. Very dry and very crisp. D:Perfect consistency for the style.

147,1160,Pencible,4.82,"This poured pitch black with a little dark tan head. It smelled like chocolate covered raisins or prunes with some alcohol notes. It tasted like sweet dark fruit and mocha, slightly bitter with some alcohol warming. It was somewhat oily with no carbonation and a smooth, warm aftertaste.

Balanced and mellow scent has it all - bready yeast, extra-dark roasted malt and slightly bitter hop backbone (earthy and grassy). Just realized that my cold is precluing me from smelling anything mortal so this must be good - may update later.  The balance and mellowness is both surprising and overwhelming. Not too much of anything but enough of everything. Dark espresso with a little licoricle and cinnamon sugar. Some earth, slate, grassy hops and gobs of malt.  Slithers down the throat nicely - with no aftertaste. Thick but clear.  Beautifully done. Extremely enjoyable.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,96

I made sure to stock up on this beer in 08, as the 07 IRS was a great experience. The 08 does not disappoint.  I split a bomber and aggressively poured a nice two-finger head into a snifter. I let the coffee and chocolate aroma linger. The smell is great, but not overpowering. You won't, for example, smell it from a few feet away. Put get your nose in that glass and enjoy.  The first sip of the 08 had me remember why I think this is one of the best beers that I've ever tasted. It punches you right away with the strong stout taste, but it then morphs into a smooth, hoppy aftertaste that is quite pleasurable.  Finish leaves the coffee taste as the beer's final statement. And what a wonderful statement that beer makes. I am completely satisfied. I need to buy some more!",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,96

T - Strong and dark, burnt flavors and sting of alcohol are most present to the sweet molasses and malts, has a bitter hops finish.  M - Extremely deep and smooth, dark and demands respect with the 10.8% bite, leaves a impressive aftertaste.

It tastes of very rich roasted malts, some coffee, chocolate, and some caramel as well. The taste is followed by a short and faint but nice hoppy bitterness to round out the flavor.

The smell is like a charcoal party with everyone invited. There was also the presence of dried grass. Taste was roasted, burnt, massive, and delicious. One of the more bitter imperial stouts I've had. A bit hoppier than expected, but not bad at all. Mouthfeel is spot on. Thick and syrupy with just enough carbonation. This is an absolutely huge beer.

I just bought the 2008 which was just released this past week. I don't care what people are saying about Dark Lord or The Abyss. The Stone RIS is the BEST RIS on the market. People are willing to say that something taste better if they think it is rare and hard to get just to brag about drink the best beer on the market but this beer is just as good, no, better than either of the other two. Find a 2006 or 2007 and have a glass and decide for yourself. If you have to, drink a fresh 2008 and see what I mean.

I've had the pleasure of drinking the 2003 in '07, the 2006 in '08, and finally have got around to reviewing the spring 2007 in early '08. My first impression is this beer is really hot. It's amazing how much it time mellows out the rough edges, but on to the review. Poured a 22oz bottle into my Smokestack goblet. Wow, this is a beautiful pour. Rich oily black, letting no light through, no head even with an aggressive pour. This beer leaves no lacing whatsoever. Aroma is of raisins, dark chocolate, and espresso beans. It's really complex as with most RIS's. Taste is huge up front with bakers chocolate. Slightly bitter. Then pours in the roasted (almost burnt) coffee beans and finishes with almost a Isles Scotch taste. This beer really is another amazing product that the Stone Brewery puts out. Mouthfeel is exactly what I want in a beer. Plain and simple. This is my favorite style of beer and a absolutely fantastic version of it.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,96

Strong, deep smell of currants, roastted malts, chicory, cocoa powder, and rich espresso... Taste was top-notch, and an excellent depiction of the style, bursting with creamy, rich, thick flavor... Notes of dark espresso, burnt coffee, roasted malts, anise, dark chocolate and mocha were bursting!... Great stuff from Stone... an excellent, milk-shake-like creaminess apparent with a strong essence of pure coffee and chocolate...

Excellent lace which looks like a line of trees on the African plain.  Aromas of caramel, coffee, dark chocolate, and currents. The alcohol is extremely faint for being over 10%. Great nose to this brew, sweet and roasted.  Flavor is first and foremost intense. Roasted grain, malts, bakers chocolate. Hops are in there, but hide in the background. Very rich, robust, and bitter. Feel is thick and smooth.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,96
147,1160,davidchollar,4.6,"Enveloped in darkness, an absence of light in my tulip. Fat, brown head on top. The retention and lacing are adequate. This beer looks really good but smells even better.  Like the best doppelbock I've had the pleasure of quaffing, this is obviously a malt bomb. But wait, there's so much more! While initial smells reveal whoppers and coffee, a little more sniffing brings out the IBUs. And tasting confirms this. Holy hoppy ... wow. All together now, mocha, chocolate, coffee, cookies and liqueur. With a big vicious liquorice bite.  Mouthfeel is outstanding, so full and smooth. But at nearly 11%, it loses a point for drinkability as a bottle of this is dangerous. I've only had a few RISs, but I would say Stone's has a pretty unique flavor. Yeah, I'll be getting this again!",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,96
147,1160,abankovich,4.66,"Just picked up some of the 2008 Spring release and couldn't wait to try a bottle.  This beer poured a THICK dark black. Absolutely black, with no light able to permeate the color. Definitely some viscosity to this one. The head that formed was very impressive and a nice light brown color that stuck around with a good cover frothiness.  The initial smell on this one is sweeter than I would have expected. Definite chocolate notes. I think the anise is what is coming through and I like it. Toasted aromas are also present along with coffee.  Damn this beer is good. Thick, very thick and so smooth. I can feel the warmness of the alcohol all the way down and I'm left with almost small sour pains in the back corners of my mouth from the bitterness, but in a good way. The sweetness and the toasted malt taste is balanced pretty perfectly in my opinion, I love that the hops are also so noticeable.  Mouthfeel is obviously thick and heavy but since it is so smooth, it doesn't really give you that urge where you almost feel like you have to chew as you drink. I love it.  Well at 10.8% I can't say this is a beer you could drink a lot of. But I would love to have more of it, lots and lots more.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,96

It's very tasty, and I'd agree pretty much with anything anyone here who rated it an A- or better had to say. I really enjoyed this one, even though I'm not a big fan of Stone offerings, although I do enjoy their Old Guardian Barleywine. Probably the best thing is that this baby sells for about $5.99 (as does the Old Guardian at American Thrifty in Brooklyn). At $5.99, it's a fantastic beer at a fantastic price.

Appearance: Black as night is a Duvel sniffter with a densely packed tan head that will go as high as you want. The lacing is so nice it looks like you'll need to scrub it off.  Aroma: Sweet, malty coffee aromas are the overwhelming presense here. There's a little caramel essence sneaking there as well.  Mouthfeel: This is like syrup in your mouth with barely a hint of carbonation. I'm struck once again by the lacing as I sip. I sense a little anise as well The welcoming presence is all there as it's just silky smooth.  Taste: Wow. This is as smooth as any 11% beer you'll ever have. It's just a little bitter on the initial taste but is pure black malt from there on. The alcohol isn't evident until it warms you on the way down. The finishing exhale is the best toffee with a little coffee poured on top.  Drinkability: One of the best Imperial Russian Stouts from my favorite brewer.

Thick chocolate and roasted malts .. coffee and dark fruits .. the alcohol has really gone away in this one with a year in the cellar... a little smoke and char... maybe a little citrus/catty hops, but my nostrils could be playing tricks on me.  Big and badass across the palate ... thick and creamy while still retaining perfect carbonation. Dark chocolate and dark roast coffee ... fairly sweet but only enough to tie the figgy flavors into the roasted character. Toffee and essence of brown sugar. Alcohol only shows as it warms ... and then only in the gullet. Mild tawny port notes as it hits room temperature.  This is the type of beer that makes me wish I would have started cellaring alot sooner. Fantastic ...

Fabulous pour, heavy and jet black with a modest 1/8"" head that dissipates quickly. Very nice garnet color under strong light.  Aroma is weak, a nice chocolate note that floats away with a bit of graininess behind it. Slightly meaty.  Taste is a letdown. They took this one out of that lab too soon. No glaring defects, but weak and lacking complexity. Slight amount of dark fruits, black grains, molasses and alcohol.  Mouthfeel is balanced, bitterness low but balanced.

Aromas are quite boozy first, quite roasty, chocolate, slightly burned walnuts, and a bag of black patent. Just a touch of piney hops there, but the alcohol and malts really dominate. On the palate, a thickly bodied, low carbonated brew really kills the palate with a hugely complex malt profile. Layers of coffee and chocolate, roasted grain, touches of oak and smoke finishing with a lingering bitterness. I'm thrilled this is not an overly hopped RIS, as I've come to really hate that. Overall, an incredible brew, one to really put up against my favorites: BCS and Expedition.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,96

147,1160,Pehlman,3.89,"Honestly, I expected more from this beer. Not bad but I was hoping for holy grail-esque quality. The smell of the beer was mostly of the alcohol. The color was just like I like em, pitch black. It was aged approx. 1 year, but I still felt like the alcohol flavor was a bit over-powering. Maybe it gets milder with more aging.  The flavor was definately good. Very smooth, but a bit like spiked, BBQ-ed, slightly carbonated fig juice.  The #1 thing I would give this beer is its great mouthfeel. I've had plenty of imperial russians and porters that feel like I'm drinking a smokey, 55 degree coke. This beer has absolutely perfect carbonation.

Fruitiness greets the nose with roasted coffee notes taking over mid-sniff. Smooth texture as the oil-dark brew slides creamily into the mouth. A full bitterness ensues, full of toasty nuts and coffee. As the beer warmed up, notes of the promised black currants developed. A pleasingly mild astringency salutes the departure of the beer, accompanied by a subtle alcohol burn down the throat. This is a big, manly beer and one of the only Stone beers I can think of that isn't hopped to within an inch of its life. Not to knock Stone at all - but it's a nice change.

I have to say I had very high expectations, not only due to the high rating of this beer but I am a huge fan of most all of Stone's offerings. This did not live up to those expectations and was a very mediocre beer. Pour was good, nice mocha colored head, dark as can be, decent head retention with some lacing. Smell was very disappointing. Stong smell of alcohol, particularly vodka which I found weird. Some smell of toffee and raisin, but mainly alcohol. Taste was of some coffee, chocolate, dark fruits but again a very sharp alcohol bite, especially as it goes down. Mouthfeel is medium, carbonation is great.

Smell is extremely intense, roasted malts, chocolate, with good hop balance, too. The taste is amazing. The year of aging has added so much flavor. I taste coffee, chocolate, hazelnut. Unbelievable. Not as intense as some of the other RIS out there but the complexity after a year of aging is unbelievable. I'm blown away. My buddy has a Westvleteren 8 waiting for me to try, and I can't put this glass down.  The aging has done wonders for this beer. I had it about six months ago, and it has improved so much.

147,1160,markgugs,4.75,"2007 vintage. 22oz. bottle poured into a tulip glass (consumed: 2/14/08)  A: Pours a thick, viscous dark brown with an equally dark brown 1-finger head. Holding it up to the light reveals some ruby colors around the beers edges; it even sparkles a bit after the initial pour. Phenomenal looking.  S: An almost-overwhelming rich, intoxicating bouquet of chocolate and roasted malts, backed up by even more cocoa, with the slightest hints of a floral hoppiness left.  T/M: Amazing. I cannot believe this is the same beer I had back in April when it was fresh, it's an entirely new beer already. It's *very* rich, a dessert chocolate mousse is the closest flavor I would describe this to be. As it warms, even more bittersweet cocoa comes out, as well as luscious dark cherries dripping in sinfully palate-watering juices. The beer doesn't so much as coat your mouth as it does vanquish anything else that's in there, with an oatmeal-like oil slick quality. Exxon Valdez has nothing on this beer.  D: Far, far too easy to drink for a beer that's over 10% ABV. I kept reaching for another sip, it was very difficult to let this warm properly as it was deliciously potable from the get-go. Highly, highly recommended.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,96
147,1160,YankChef,4.53,"poured into a tulip glass. 2007 vintage  Appearance: Completely opaque with a tan/beige head that clings to the glass. Very still and implacable character, this beer looks like you could stick a spoon in it and it would stand up straight.  Smell: Strong smell of candied fruit, particularly fig, plum, apricot, molasses, a little bit of cumin {yes cumin) and a little bit of cranberry/blackberry.  Taste: Upfront there is a hit of sweetness that is a dark sweetness, almost like a mixture of honey and brown sugar. Then you move into all sorts of dark candied fruit flavor like dried figs, crystalized ginger, caramelized pear, plum, palm sugar and a little bit of bitter molasses. The finish on this beer, at this point&lt; is bitter with a strong assertiveness of hop... I'm thinking cascade and/or chinook and a strong espresso flavor.  Overall: Basically this beer kicks ass. If you like RIS, than this is one of the best beers in the world. I must say though, if you really like Russian Imperial Stouts than you must try this beer. More importantly this beer is not ready to drink when it is released. Let it sit for at least one year before drinking. Up to 3 years (When it will peak) is ideal.

Give it a swirl and it wakes up and shows some nice legs and foamy lace.  I really spent a lot of time swirling this one - the smells are very complex and pleasant. Smells of dark roasted sweet malts. Not a lot of burnt malts coming thru for such a dark beer. Alcohol is quite apparent in the nose. Smell intensifies and some coffee and dark chocolates come out as it warms.  Alcohol not as apparent in the taste. Although you can definitely feel the buzz from this. Carmel and espresso. Malt doesn't taste burnt or overly bitter like some RISs, but more like a fine dark chocolate. There is a subdued bitter hops aftertaste, which doesn't linger excessively.  Mouthfeel is thick, viscous and smooth with moderate carbonation. This is spot on for the style.  Defintely a sipper. A great beer on a cold winter nite. Easy to drink though.

This beer was also a launching pad for my obsession with beer, so it holds a special place for me in the pantheon of beers.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,96
147,1160,gkatsoris,4.83,"A: WOW! This was intimidating. First of all, the head took almost ten minutes to settle; and the flavors that came from this head (gizzing in my pants thinking about it). The color was basicly black with a huge burnt caramel head.  S: Coffee, chocolate, hops, vanilla, and raisins.  A: This was absolutely delicious. Delicious! Lots of hops, and malts. Lots of deep rich coffee and tastes of chocolate. And hints of raisins. And honestly, perfectly balanced.  M: Very nice. Thick and rich. Nice carbonation. And it coats the tongue (which leaves the flavors there for an enjoyable experience for the next 3-5 minutes).  D: More, more, more please. Looks like I need to get another Stone gargoyle tattoo.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,96
147,1160,DackAchan,4.67,"A- Pours dark, with a thin layer of a mocha head. No lacing.  S- Good smell. Lots of complex aromas, dates, and chocolate the primary smells.  T- Excellent taste. Starts sweet with a nice rich chocolate flavor, flowing well into a strong date/raisin flavor. Finishes nicely with a touch of bitterness on the back end. Overall very well rounded.  M- Heavy body, nothing harsh about this beer. Feels good.  D- Good drinkablitly for a RIS. Alcohol isn't overpowering so it is pleasant the whole session.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,96
147,1160,yourefragile,4.35,"22 oz ""Spring 2007"" bottle poured into a snifter  A: A rich deep, dark chocolate color that is completely opaque. A thick, fluffy dark mocha colored head with that dissipates to a ring and some small bubbles in the middle. A lot of thick, sticky lacing. S: Strong aroma of roasted coffee and surprisingly almost as strong, darker fruits. Slight hint of alcohol in background, barely any chocolate or malt detectable to me. T: In general this is a very pleasant, smooth easy drinking, yet complex RIS. Coffee flavors are present throughout and are strongest in the aftertaste. A strong fruit sweetness (grape, currant) is also present in the body and is slightly bitter. Not surprisingly, hops are also near the finish for balance. Even after aging for a year there is the slight taste of alcohol, but not unpleasant. Not a very strong malt or chocolate presence. M: Thick, full body, almost syrup like, very little carbonation. Finish is very smooth and non-abrasive. D: I was feeling the alcohol from this beer from the first few sips so drinking a bomber alone is a little tough. I think this is an excellent RIS and surprisingly drinkable bit there's really nothing here that wows me (not a bad thing, but keeps me from rating this higher). Was much sweeter (from fruit flavors) than expected. After I'm done reviewing this beer I feel like I shortchanged it and that it probably deserves a higher rating, so I take that to be a good sign for this beer.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,96

Smell: Light aroma of high end coffee with hints of fruit  Taste: Very smooth, slight coffee / fruity taste, very yummy  This bomber was just what I need on a chilly Saturday in February. Very smooth and easy to drink, no way you could know that your are drinking a 10.8%  More than 1 bomber in a sitting could probably cause me some damage or a headache, so I'll save the other bomber for next year.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,96
147,1160,LittleBreeze,4.47,1/26/08  2007 edition cellared by aerozeppl  Old ale smell. Nice. Can double/pass as a winter night sipper.  This one was so smooth. The coffee and a bit of caramel are still there. Rough edges are gone. Did I mean how smooth this one is?  A year made a big difference.,Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,96
147,1160,drseamus,4.5,"Thanks to aerozeppl for sharing this bottle. I had previously rated this beer before but after having this bottle with a year of age on it I deleted the old review because it was a vast improvement. This beer took the night versus Darkness, a 2003 Czar, and Siberian Night.  A: Dark black body with a darkish head. Standard fare for a RIS (or IRS?).  S: The aroma is sweet and almost old aleish. There is a touch of raisin in it. Nice and inviting.  T: Very tasty. Sweet with a good caramel malt kick. A bit of coffee also. Again, a slight old ale character. No chocolate really. The bitterness that is present in this beer initially had diminished greatly and made for a better beer.  M: Medium to heavy. Lower carbonation than fresh I think.  D: Very smooth. Age did wonders to this beer. I have a 2005 that I will have to drink.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,96
147,1160,Lupe,4.8,"Foamy coffee head sits atop a black as night brew. Head slowly dissipates to a fine ring and leaves behind some sticky lace.  Aroma is rich and full with dark roasted coffee, chocolate milkshake, berry fruitiness, and rum-raisin, adding light alcohol with the fruit.  Initial blast of sweet maltiness with dark fruit, berry, and molasses. Rich roasted grain, dark chocolate, and espresso come next. Leafy hops show up in the background, adding a twist but not getting in the way. Alcohol also pops in adding some more complexity. Mild spice, oak, and smoke are also present. Carmel sneaks in after warming. After each individual flavor has their say, all the different flavors blend into a strong yet well balanced deliciousness. So flavorful.  Slightly thick, very creamy, slick, and smooth. On the lighter side of being full bodied. Highly drinkable and very deceiving for a beer at 10.8% abv. After the bottle was gone I wanted more - Truly a sign of drinkability with a beer of this size.  This beer's greatness doesn't show right away but builds, and midway through the bottle you realize it's just outstanding.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,96
147,1160,Tilley4,4.31,Been waiting to rate this one for a while. The wife decided she wanted to share it so I broke it out.  Midnight black pour with a small head.  Loads of chocolate covered dark fruit on the nose here. Something different every time I take a whiff too. This really smells good...  Rush of chocolate and dark fruit upon the first sip which mellows out into a nice roasted chocolate malt finish that leaves me ready for the next sip.  I loved everything about this stout. It's definitely in my top 5 in the category.. Awesome beer.,Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,96
147,1160,sraimondi,4.25,"Aggressive pour into a standard pint glass yields a 2 inch tan head. Totally opaque, no light shines through. A very pretty beer.  Smell dominated by sweet malt and some chocolate.  Taste is phenomenal. Chocolate malt dominates, with some smoke and minor hops flavor.  The mouthfeel borders on a 5.0, no kidding. The complexity of this brew is complemented by a round hops flavor.  At 10.8% ABV, one bomber is enough in any one sitting. Next time, I'll have to try this one with dessert. Good stuff from Stone.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,96
147,1160,beerthulhu,4.23,"A: Poured a dark, opaque and crude motor oil color with a thin quickly fading khaki head.  S: The nose was surprising light with some dark chocolate, a light smokiness and a touch of dry pine.  T: The initial flavor was a rich, dark roasted character with some dark coffee grinds. Upon warming some fresh prunes were evident along with a spicy alcohol (dark rum) and woodiness and a very dry pungent grapefruit and malty lacing on the tongue. The palate was very dry throughout the course of the drink with a nice medium roasted malting. There was a sharp and acrid coffee bitterness as well anise coming through upon warming as well.  M: The mouthful was light-moderate per style with some slickness.  D: Overall not a bad beer but feel like the body was lacking substance at times and felt light. Still a very good beer but think there are much better examples per style.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,96
147,1160,DavidEddie,4.7,"Spring 2007 release. A thanks to JJ for this outstanding RIS!  Heavy dirty black motor oil appearance with some sticky tan lacing. Aromas of chocolate, coffee, and burnt toast. Big flavors of roasted malt, dark chocolate, light smoke, and bitter coffee. Delicious! Mouth feel is thick and coating. Drinkability is great. An outstanding sipper! Did not detect the high ABV whatsoever. Highly recommended!",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,96

Pours with big, long lasting light tan head.  s: Big beautiful notes of maple syrup, chocolate, alcohol, and a bit of coffee.  t: Mirrors the smell. Big and luxurious notes of chocolate and molasses dominate. Some coffee and a warming alcohol note come along for the ride.  m: Super creamy and well carbonated.  d: I prefer smaller bottles so I doubt I'll buy more of these, but this is a world class RIS for sure.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,96

147,1160,milesfan76,4.28,"New Year's resolution no.1: write more beer reviews. It's been quite a while since my last one so here goes...  Poured from a 22oz. bottle with a gargoyle in a fur hat. If Stone's beers weren't so good, they'd still be worth buying just for the bottles.  A: Pours as black as the margins on the sides of these pages. Dark tan head that stays around for a while.  S: Smells like roasted malts and unsweetened chocolate, just a little bit of hops.  T: Mmm. Malts, chocolate, coffee, slight bit of hops. 10.8% ABV? Really?? I don't taste it.  M: Thick, almost syrupy. Carbonation is just right for my taste.  D: Very drinkable, though obviously not sessionable. I would love to have three or four of these but the ABV (which I couldn't taste) says no.  A great brew from a great brewery.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,96
147,1160,JWFokker,5,"This one pours BLACK like pitch with a thick tan head that sticks around for a while. The nose is roasted malt and coffee, fruitiness, nuttiness, and a bit of alcohol (hey, it's 10.8% ABV). The flavor is GREAT. It's a smorgasbord of roasted malt and coffee and chocolate and a touch of hop bitterness. Some people taste tobacco and if you look for it, it's not hard to find in there. Surprisingly, the alcohol is lost in the mix, despite being detectable on the nose. But even better than the variety of flavors in this beer is the balance. This is a truly exceptional Imperial Russian stout. The mouthfeel is almost creamy, but likely thinned to just the right density by the high ABV. As filling as this beer is, drinkability is incredible, simply because of the superb flavor and mouthfeel. If you like stouts, you won't want to stop drinking this one. Highly recommended.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,96
147,1160,lightindarkness,4.57,"oh, so good. 22oz 2007 spring release.  Thick, black, only hints of light come through the bottom of the glass. Nick dense tan head goes down to bubbly film, then ultimately to nothing but a ring.  On the nose, sweet heavy bittersweet chocolate, dark roasted malt, prune, raisin, hints of caramel, warm brownies, and alcohol.  Do not read further, just try it yourself. If you're still reading I assume you've already had a sip or two, or a bottle or two, whatever. Taste is remarkably well balanced, with full dark malty flavors of dark chocolate, coffee, tobacco, roasted grains, and softer vanilla extract, all reigned in with a slight bitter note that sits higher on the palate and a round sweetness lingering on the back of the tongue. I lost the 10.8% alcohol in there somewhere; it's faint but not overwhelming. As an example of the style, very well done with no single flavor dominating. Aftertaste is controlled and grainy, very appealing.  Extremely rich, yet surprisingly drinkable. Mouthfeel is pleasantly full without being gaggingly thick. Sticky, even a little oily, but mostly just plain delicious. With the subtlety of the sweetness hitting somewhere more in the back of the mouth than up front, it's not overly syrupy. Very nice.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,96
147,1160,sfoley333,4.73,"Poured from 22oz bottle from 05 into a stone RIS snifter. Poured a used motor oil black with a wonderful thick tan head.

Thick malt tones. Just so robust and consistent. Alcohol doesn't seem to show up at all. Feel is amazing on the liquid. Extremely drinkable. A RIS that sits at 10.8& alcohol? Easily could be a recipe for disaster, but this just comes out magnificently. Easily one of the best beers ever created, IMO.

147,1160,bigman147,4.52,"Bottle dated 2006.  Apperance: Pours a blackish brown (almost glossy opaque). Head is maybe 2-3 inches but fades quickly to a dark brown ring around the color. Lacing is wonderful and appearance is above average.  Aroma: Like all RIS, this has a dark roasty toasty malt character. Aromas of chocolate and coffee. Spicy dark winter fruit cake with a present alcohol nose  Taste: Bitter coffee and sweet chocolate give way to a delicate sweet finish reminiscent of good Beligan Dark chocolates. Bitterness from hops tends to linger slightly but helps to balance with alcohol which starts out somewhat hot in the back of the throat.  Mouthfeel: Creamy and rich carbonation which helps cut the at times thick almost cloying sweetness. Alcohol heat and coffee bitterness give this a thinner finish even with the creamy sweetness.  Drinkability: Not the most drinkable beer (considering the style). An excellent special occasion beer to warm you on a cold winter day when you come in from shoveling or skiing or whatever.. Not a session beer nor is supposed to be.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,96
147,1160,Dansting,4.58,"Bottle. Poured a blackish-brown color with a light brown head. Good lacing. Aroma was sweet with a hint a vanilla, coffee, and roasted malt that usually come with this style.

I wish at least.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,96
147,1160,stemcell001,4.35,"Cellared for six months and poured into a pint glass. Dark, pitch black body with a very tan head. Wonderful smell of roated malts and coffee. Very complex taste with strong coffee notes, spicy hops and hints of anise and other spices. Very potent brew which is a drawback concerning drinkability. I don't see how I could drink more than one of these in an evening. Despite this small flaw, Stone makes a wicked Russian Imperial Stout, most likely the best I have had of the style.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,96

You can feel its power course through your veins as you drink it. It is a well-balanced Russian Imperial Stout. It has smoky, sweet and bitter character in one brew.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,96
147,1160,connecticutpoet,4.2,"Tasted at Julio's Liquors, in Westborough, MA. My father then purchased a bottle for me, and it has been cellaring for a year and a half. It will be superb next summer.  This beer had a head just under half a finger, composed of very tiny bubbles. It was incredibly dark brown, nearly black, and clear.  Aroma was of dark and roasted malts, complex and blended, and bitter chocolate.  Taste was of very strong roasted malts, as expected. However, as in the nose, it was evident that they were blended and each brought out the best in the others. Some bitter chocolate and coffee notes, but the roasted flavor overshadowed this. The alcohol was very evident.  Mouthfeel was smooth, silky, and creamy. Quite nice.  Drinkability is very good... but the flavor was so strong, I thought it could use some time to mellow it a bit.  All in all, an excellent brew.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,96
147,1160,Tolann,4.25,"A - How did they take the picture fast enough to capture so much head on this beer? The head quickly disappears and no lace. Color is clear but nearly opaque. I think you'd need a high powered spot light to get light to penetrate this beer, and then your glass would melt...  S - Sweet with a bit of milk chocolate. Some fruity smells. I think it's the raisins like in what i'm tasting. It's like a chocolate covered raisin.  T - Sweet taste up front. Some bitterness at the end. Raisins, and roasty malt. Yum-O Other reviews mention licorice....Yeah, maybe. I'm still thinking of a sweet chocolate covered raisin with a kick.  M - Little boozy that warms your chest. Very pleasant. Medium body and smooth across your pallet. Not a lot of carbonation  D - A really wonderful beer. Glad I made the impulse buy when I saw it was the last bottle in the back room.  Chocolate covered raisins. Final answer.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,96
147,1160,PittBeerGirl,4.77,"A- Pours deep motor oil black with a thick foamy light brown head. Head eventually completely dissipates and some lacing is left behind near the top of the glass. When held up to the light nothing penetrates the opaque blackness.  S-Smell is rich in deep chocolate malt and warm roastiness. The alcohol is slightly noticeable in the background along with hints of licorice and anise. The smell is slightly sweet and very welcoming.  T-Taste is very similar to the smell. Rich, semi-sweet dark chocolate malt upfront with hints of licorice and anise. The dark chocolate intensifies for the finish and becomes slightly bitter as a big toasted malt character emerges. What lingers on the palate are hints of bitter dark chocolate, toasted malt, and toffee-all wrapped in a soft alcohol blanket.  M- Medium carbonation with a heavy and rich body with a slight alcohol slickness. The body is not to thick-which increases drinkability immensely.  D- This is one great RIS. Stone produces some awesome dark beers. I was really impressed by this one as well as the smoked porter. This one is very rich-but not too rich and it is my favorite RIS so far. I will definitely purchase this one again. This beer is definitely worth the hype.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,96
147,1160,PEBKAC,4.08,"On tap at Blind Tiger for the sensory overload they called 12/12/12/12.  Chilled to the point of haze coming off the beer, I had to wait. Everything was being served a degree off frozen it seemed. An inch of milk chocolate head cemented the black & brown brew shut until I was ready to partake.  I smelt ash & molasses. I thought I smelt the potential for diacetyl, but it didn't come through in the taste. The hops were green & itchy to my nose, but neutral.  The buds sense a little lactose to go along with the creaminess of chocolate. But it's the taste of charcoal & burnt BBQ drippings that I really enjoyed. Savoriness itself flamed, caramelized, & concentrated for your imbibing pleasure. The hops felt muted. They are more obvious on the finish when the beer thins out. A little bit of soap & little over-roast if I can describe them at all.  Frothy, but not necessarily thick. The alcohol was of course noticeable, but doesn't fume like a high ABV does more often then not. It rinses down without being sticky trying to coat.  I definitely want another, but can I handle it?",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,96
147,1160,OKCNittany,4.97,"22oz bomber poured into a goblet  A: Poured a thin brown head that didn't last too long or leave much lacing. Near black body that after awhile seemed to resemble a very dark red wine. I'd normally take off a bit more for the lack of head retention & lacing, but it looked too damn good after the initial pour.  S: Powerful aroma of chocolate and roasted malt. Outstanding. Alcohol exerts itself as it warms, adding dark fruit characteristics & making the smell even better.  T: There's too much flavor to capture it all in a few sentences. Rich dark chocolate & roasted malt headline, with dark fruit and a touch of alcohol in the background. Well balanced, complex, and big big BIG.  M: Full body. Very low carbonation yet not flat. Really the perfect mouthfeel with a slight alcohol warming.  D: Surprisingly and dangerously drinkable for 10.8% abv. I had to keep reminding myself to only sip. No offense to Victory Storm King, but I think I have a new favorite.

Warming alcohol is very noted.The alcohol and bitter hops linger on in the after taste...YUMMMM!!! Coffie is present as well. YUMM!!  This RIS drinks like a full meal. Very thick, sweet, and filling.

147,1160,ElGordo,4.1,"2007 edition, poured from the 22oz bottle into a snifter. Body is as dark as a black steer's tuckus on a moonless prairie night, topped by a thin brown head that disappears almost immediately. Aroma of huge amounts of roasted malt, a good bit of alcohol, and notes of dark fruit (prunes, raisins). Palate is highly complex and changes from sip to sip. Up front roasty malt melds with an almost cola-like sweetness, only to quickly yield to the presence of tons of bittering hops. Notes of fruit and a musty yeast are evident on the swallow, along with some of the dark fruit notes observed on the nose. The hops leave a lasting bitterness on the finish. The body is thick, smooth, and just a touch oily, simply perfect for the Russian imperial stout style. This is certainly a beer to be cautiously savored, as the high ABV and huge malt content can have you out for the count in no time. And, I foud it goes quite well with chocolate chip cookies.

This is one where I need to work up the mood for. But that's not so hard. Truly a Russian, this big hitter is worth it. Again and again.

Slippery lacing down the sides that falls back into the beer. S: Sugary, chocolatey and earthy malts predominate. Notes of coffee, fruit (cherry?), and some grassy and bready scents. Warming lets the coffee and sugars out more. Overall, well-balanced and quite nice. T: Chocolate malts at first, smooth and sweet. Tiny bit of fruit flavors noticeable. Next comes a roasted coffee taste, with some lingering sweetness. Finish is also sugary and smooth, but with a big alcohol taste that's almost unpleasant. M: Very strong on the alcohol.

147,1160,andrewm190,4.92,"My beer grades tend to be high. There are two reasons for this. 1. I like beer. 2. Most of my beer reviews are only from beers that are micro (good/better beers).  This is my favorite beer yet tasted, and by a sizable margin. Even from about a foot and a half away, the opening of the bottle revealed a delicious aromatic smell that rolled right into my nose. The smell and taste, naturally meet. Strong chocolate sense, very sweet, also a good sense of coffee tones. The chocolate is a bit more aggressive, and the more dominant sense. Also a faint sense of roasted malts. The alcohol is present, but well blended, and very finely balanced. As a result the mouth feel is one of the best I have ever had with a beer. The imperial stout has a very high alcohol level, so one pint is about all most will be able to handle before going into the ""freshman at college"" party level.  An asterisk for those how aren't dark beer fans: if you don't like dark beer, you might still like this one, and if you don't I just don't know what to tell you. For those of you who love beer, but dark is just something you do occasionally, this beer may be a bit intense, but I'm sure you will appreciate it. For those of us who love a dark beer, this is, I believe, the benchmark. A gold medal from Stone.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,96

When I tilted my glass to the side, there was very heavy, sticky lacing on the glass. The aroma was of sweet, grainy malt with a subtle alcohol. There was a slight aroma of bittersweet dark chocolate. The flavor was very full-bodied. What struck me first was the large hop presence with its full, bitter boquet. It also had a burnt grains flavor and finished sweet. This is a very full beer with a lot of ingredients.

147,1160,MiScusi,4.88,"(late November, 2007) 2004 version On tap at the Stone Bistro, making this about 3 1/2 years old. Pours a dark dark brown almost black, with a dark tan creamy head. The aroma and taste contain dark chocolate and roasted malts, though the roastiness is much more subdued than younger versions. The alcohol is also quite a bit less recognizable. The melding between the roastiness and chocolate is superb, making for an easily drinkable rich stout. The mouthfeel was very smooth. I can't imagine this one peaking any more than it has now. ___  (September 2007) 2006 version on at the Stone World Bistro & Gardens. poured thick black with a dark tan head. The smell was a combo of dark malts, some roastiness, and alcohol. None of these single components were overbearing, it all blended together really nicely, and was a lot less roasty than I expected. The taste was pretty similar as nothing was really overbearing but it all blended together very nicely. The chocolate wasn't too chocolatey, the roastiness wasn't too bitter though it did give off a touch of coffee flavor. The mouthfeel was as thick as it should be and nothing more or less. Very drinkable for such a big beer. ___  (late December 2006) 2005 version on tap at the Stone Bistro, (guess about 1 1/2 years old or a little more by now). Deep deep brown, basically black, not much of a head but a little tan thin and creamy foam up top. Chocolate malt, coffee, and alcohol dominate this beer, and it is very smooth. Rolls over your tongue without any carbonated bite but with a little alcohol heat.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,96

Great Nose. sweat dark fruits, plums, raisins, figs mixed with brown sugar, chocolate a slight bit of vanilla. a total treat on the nose  Mellowed out nicely on the tongue but can maybe even still use some more time in the cellar. A very slight bit smokey, chocolate and coffee notes, the dark fruit is hear at well.  A medium body that is incredibly round in the mouth with a modest amount of fine bubbled carbonation. Creamy and smooth with a clean finish accompanied by some dark chocolate smokiness.  A truly great stout and one that is proving to only get better with age, I have another 2006 hidden away and may just sit on it for another year",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,96
147,1160,MarkSCCOT,4.9,"Was able to sample this beer at the November 2007 Charleston BA tasting courtesy of TedsButcherBlock (Scott). Between him and RNorgart (Breakfast Stout!!) I really have had my interest revived in this class.  A. Like a black hole. Pours dark as motor oil and try as I might I couldn't see any light through this beer or it's edges. Coffee Mocha Latte head with decent lacing!!  S. This beer jumps out and grabs you by the nose. This is a busy beer. Hops, malt, coffee, chocolate and some kind of exotic fruit.  T. This is a world class beer. Malt and hops. Raisins, figs, fruit. Dark bread and birch.  M. Thick chewy creamy beer with a good alcohol burn. This is a beer to take out and enjoy slowly. Sip it smell it and enjoy.  D. Could drink it all night, but can't. This would have a 5 also if it were available more. It really deserves a 4.75 but that isn't an option.  This is one of the first highly rated beers I have had that truly lived up to it's hype!! It deserves it's ranking.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,96
147,1160,ByTor2112,4.28,"2007Edition Pours an inky black. A one finger thick head forms but but reduces to a thin film, brown in color. Very nice color contrast against the black body of the stout. Aroma-cocoa, chocolate,smoky, some woody notes and roasted malty aromas. Mouthfeel-smooth, silky, potent. Very rich with dark roasted coffee flavors. I get some alcohol warmth. A froth on the palate intensifies the alcohol and releases some more intense flavors-medicinal and the hop profile flourishes with a decent bitterness. the finish lingers with some dark or roasted malt flavors, almost a burnt taste. As this warms up even more I get some licorice and anise flavors. A certain sweetness comes through with the additional warmth. Not overly complex but layered with many flavors coming and going. I am never disappointed by any of Stone's offerings. Its Pravda! Skol! Joe",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,96
147,1160,jjayjaye,4.5,"Pours an opaque darkness with a wispy full finger dark tan head that resists fading. The smell is wonderfully rich and thick, dark chocolate and roasted coffee beans. There is also a touch of vanilla and oak age treatment. Lightly carbonated, the mouth feel has a thick yet smooth texture. The syrupy coating sensation is light yet the roasty choco-java flavor lingers nicely. The 10.8% ABV is present in the nose but otherwise well hidden. Immensely quaffable, highly recommended.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,96
147,1160,jackhammer54,4.85,"Kudos to Stone for creating a beer that will bring a tear of joy to ones eye. I must say after having a Stone Imperial Russian Stout makes drinking supermarket next to a sin. Buyer beware you will no longer be able to consume inferior beverage after this experience. From start to finish it was everything I wished this would be. For starters when poured the appearance was super cool rich and dark and creamy just like you would expect. The smell again is warm, rich and luxurious. The taste is complex, not to heavy or strong. Mouthfeel was smooth as silk, coating my whole mouth and continuing down the throat. Drinkability is a joy, easily a year round beer. No longer are stouts reserved for great meals and winter time for me.

Excellent head retention, terrific lacing.  S: Molasses, rum, vanilla.  T: Tastes exactly the way it smells. Slight alcohol warmth that is nowhere near the 10.8% ABV listed on the bottle.  M: It felt a bit thin for a RIS. On the one hand, it was impressive that a beer this big could feel so thin. ON the other, a RIS should be a meal. I want to have to cut it with a knife and chew it.

I must have more of this.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,96
147,1160,Atlas1,3.99,"I find most Russian imperial stouts to be a bit daunting, and the Stone version is no exception. Still, I love them, and find myself continuously drawn to them.  I poured this one from the bomber into a little Belgian snifter. An appropriate glass for something this complex, I assured myself. It appears black as night, with no colors shining through when held up to the light, except a few light shades of orange at the top near the dirty head. And speaking of head, there isn't much of one. Nothing like the BA photo at least. This one thinned out quickly and only left a few big bubbles along the rim. The nose, however, is big, as expected. Lots of dark fruit (plum, cherry, fig), followed by baker's chocolate, brewer's yeast, molasses, and faint hints of vanilla and coffee bean. A beautiful aroma. And the taste follows suit in a similar order, but comes out a bit sweeter than I anticipated. There's a nice lingering bitterness in the end which I wish was a bit more pronounced because it's so damn sweet all around. Still, it's a tasty brew. Mouthfeel is on the thin-side, if you ask me, but does fill out as the beer warms.  Stone has made a fine Russian imperial stout here, no bones about it. But it's not my favorite out there, nor should it be considered the best on the market. It's nice and complex, as it should be, but it's sweeter than some and a bit less complex than others. Definitely worth a try, though, and it'll keep you warm in the wintertime. Try it with a hearty stew, or a dense chocolate/raspberry dessert.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,96
147,1160,hero27,4.85,"22oz bomber. Early Summer 2005 Release. *Cracked open this bottle after 2+ years in the cellar to see how it held up.  What's better than drinking Stone RIS on Halloween night? ..well...probably a lot of things, but I didn't have too many more options.  Still as black as the day it was conceived. Dark fruits, chocolate, burnt malts, and vanilla flavors envelop the brew. Damn, I forgot how good this beer was... The one aspect in which I feel this beer has really improved over time is it's drinkability...so smooth, and the flavors have blended together without losing their initial redeeming qualities when consumed fresh. absolutely superb.  If this bottle is any indication, I'm positive Stone RIS can hold it's own for at least 5 years of downtime before drinking...possibly a lot longer.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,96
147,1160,mrasskicktastic,1.9,"Spring 2007 release  A - Black brew with an excellent cascade. A bit of lacing is left on the sides.  S - Molasses, licorice and a hint of fresh pitch. Burnt pith and alcohol. As the beer warms, only slightly. A pretty unpleasant smell.  T - Molasses, soy sauce, sour, licorice, black pepper, alcohol. Aftertaste is a bitter scorched malt and some sourness.  M - Thick, syrupy, smooth, a bit refreshing.  D - This beer is not very good at all. I neither hate nor love Stone beers, and I neither hate nor love extreme beers - but, objectively, this is just bad. A little short of drain pour. Truthfully, I don't think age will make a worthwhile difference in this one. I'll let it sit for a few years I think and then crack it open. I am really sad that I bought two when I saw it. Very few times that I say this, but ""at least it is strong."" Barring the one I bought synchronously (which I might just trade), I won't have this again.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,96
147,1160,seaoflament,4.3,"This bottle is from the Spring 2007 release, so it has about 4 months rest.  A very good looking RIS with some active bubbles and decent amount of hot chocolate colored head.  Big roasted aroma with some chocolate malts, coffee, toffee, hints of cherries, and cocoa.  Taste is very much in line with the aroma but with a little more cocoa in the lead. Great roasted flavor thats complimented with the coffee and slight bitterness in the finish. Still a bit of a hop bite in this one. The alcohol is well hidden but not completely absent from the beer and works in the manner of a pleasant warm feeling as it goes down and sits in the stomach without a burning sensation. The finish is semi-dry with an aftertaste of coffee and chocolate malts.  This is a RIS that would age really well and Im putting aside a few to test it.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,96

T: Super flavor with again the chocolate and coffee. Fairly sweet, also a strong roasted taste, very minimal hopping.  MF: Uber-thick with a long-lasting aftertaste. Extremely smooth and heavy. Strong warming but the alcohol is masked well.  D: A very good and easy to drink beer. May be too flavorful for some. It would be great to drink all day, but I don't think I could drink more than a bottle at a time. Very filling, a very good beer.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,96

D - If I only could, this would be an all day beverage :)",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,96
147,1160,jakon,4.41,"22oz bottle purchased in April of 2007. Case is dated 2-14-7.  Pours pitch black with a large tan colored head that creeps up on you. Be careful not to overflow the glass. The foam recedes at a steady pace leaving behind an impressive wash of sticky lacing. The alcohol in the aroma has faded a bit since spring. The first thing that hits the nose is the roasted malt character, a bit of bakers chocolate, a hint of coffee and a distant hop presence. The taste has mellowed a bit as the flavors have melded together a bit more. The alcohol isn't nearly as perceptible as it was 5 or 6 months ago. There is a robust bitterness that seems to be originating from numerous sources. Baker's chocolate, hops and coffee. There are dark fruit characteristics and a background sweetness that help to balance everything out. The mouthfeel is thick, smooth and somewhat oily with the perfect amount of bite. I really like this beer, but have been spoiled by a surplus of Speedways lately. This isn't quite on the same level, imo, but it's still one of my favorite stouts. I've got 10 more, and look forward to checking in on them a few times each year. It's really not even hitting its stride at this point.

Some coffee, dark bakers chocolate, and a little bit of pine like hops.  Flavors are mellow and creamy up front. Some sweet chocolate flavors and coffee flavors. While the finish is still bitter, hoppy, and with a lingering alcohol bite. This beer still has a really nice kick to it.  Mouthfeel is nice. Carbonation is nice, feels thick, and prickly in the mouth.  Drinkability is very good.

Out of all the amazing high profile stouts like Darklord and Bourbon County Stout, this trumps them all, for sake of drinkability and mouthfeel. Close your eyes, take a sip, think Caramel, coffe, chocolate, feel the alcohol warmth, and remember that moment, for you have reached the pinnacle of beer drinking, and it is all downhill from here.

147,1160,deanhead,4.35,"2007 vintage. 22 oz bomber. I couldn't resist temptation!  Appearance- Deep & Dark inviting color like the night of a new moon. Pours a very rich and creamy looking tan head, plenty o-bubbles.  Smell- malty, biscuity, nutty with a strong smell of alcohol. The malt really shines thru on this. No noticeable hop aroma picked up with this beer.  Taste-Carmel notes, toasted, roasted malt and tobacco, very alcoholic with a subtle astringent undertone, almost winey. Clearly a well balanced beer with high gravity in mind.  Adequate carbonation. This is a warming full bodied, smooth drinking beer. It's easy to believe that this is an all malt beverage, let alone over 10%. It's clearly got the body to go with the style.  Drinkability- This is a big beer. I could probably handle more then one on a cold Winter's night, but alas for a showery Autumn evening one is the perfect amount. This beer should age very well. It's as complex as it gets and it would be a shame if the 2007 were no longer available to me locally (within 25 miles). Outstanding beer. Well done Stone!",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,96

I've got these going back a couple years - but, to get an 02 (a year where I wasn't close to being of legal age), I had to rely on other means. Opened for my father's birthday - I think he appreciated.  A: Dark black - slightly muddy - with a 1/2 finger head that dies relatively quickly.  S: Dates, plums, molasses and brandy - nice!  T: Brandy-soaked plums, raisins, some chocolate & coffee. I've had many fresh bottles and those don't have anywhere near the dark fruit characteristics. The chocolate and roasted flavors have mellowed out, and the fruits have definitely come out on this one. A truly different beer - and a very tasty one at that.  M: Somewhat rich, low carbonation. I like it.  D: Very drinkable. I want more!  Highly recommended. Can't wait to try the 2001 I've got!",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,96

Lace falls in sheets on the sides of the glass. Smells of rich roasted coffee. Full bodied, heavy on the palate and full of flavor. Big roasted backbone with some coffee flavors and just a touch of sweetness. This beer is thick and heavy in the mouth. I love it. It's a sipper but a great beer.

147,1160,umustdrink,4.69,"My belated birthday beer A Spring 2007 edition, got in a trade from MiScusi  A - Jet black color, yields almost no light, I was able to get some color out of the bottom edge of the glass: a deep ruby red. Head is one of the darkest brown colors I've seen on a beer, it was grainy and swirled with lighter streaks. Unfortunately it faded to a patchy film. Minimal lacing, just a few streaks.  S - The most prominent smell here is a raisiny sweet toasted malt. Background is thick with aromas, sweet creamy vanilla, fresh baked bread, butter, some sharper spices and some muted bitterness. Little to no alcohol detected in the smell.  T/M - The taste starts with a nice bittery bite and quickly into the darker flavors. A smooth and creamy dark roasted malts, a very light bitterness comes in from the roasting but overall its a very creamy taste. Right after the swallow a wave of flavors hit, just a quick blast of rich cream with a very sharp bitter coffee malt. The finish leaves a toasted maltiness with a coffee-like bitterness.  D - I'm glad I got 2 of these. This is an excellent stout and definitely worth the stop on the quest to try the worlds greatest imperial stouts.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,96
147,1160,TheWhaleShark,4.9,"Poured from a bottle into a pint glass.  A: Blacker than the blackest black, times infinity. Had a dark brown head, about 2 fingers. Beautiful.  S: A bit of alcohol, and some dark, roasty something. Perhaps a hint of coffee.  T: Damn. I mean, damn. A very strong malt body, with just a touch of hops. First hits are like a dark roast coffee and bitter chocolate. Underlining that, and continuing aftewards till the finish, is a very noticeable and pleasant sweetness, very much like caramel. This is simply delicious, no question about it.  M: This is what the word ""stout"" was meant to describe. The body on this is as full as you can get, without gumming up your mouth. It's divine.

Lots of coffee and dark chocolate, faint spices. No noticeable alcohol aroma. Taste is amazing. Heavy bakers chocolate, coffee, dark roasted malts. I detected some kind of lingering sweetness that was somewhat unexpected. Mouthfeel is very thick and heavy. The only way this beer could have more body is if there was an actual body inside the bottle. Very Nice. Drinkability is quite good, but with so much in your face flavor, it'd be hard to drink more than a bomber of this. Buy a few and share with friends.

I havn't tried Dark Lord but this is without a doubt the best stout I've ever had. Okay, on with it.  22oz. Bomber(Winter 2007) Party Source poured into a Tulip.  A: Pours such a pitch black that only God Almighty could shine any light through(lol). Dark tan 2finger bubbly head. Not much retention or lacing.  S: Toasted grains and coffee beans. Has a yeasty ""browning"" scent of fresh biscuits.  T/M: Amazing toasted malts bring out a smoky coffee mouth full. Very small amounts of hops add to the coffee side by giving just a touch of bitterness, similar to a strong Italian. Carmel undertones give this brew the slightest hint of sweetness.

S: Man do I love the smell of stout's and this one does not disappoint. Tons of chocolate in the nose of this one along with a dash of coffee. There are hints of vanilla, cinnamon, and I detect a hint of alcohol. Wonderful smelling brew that begs you to drink it.  T: The only thing I like better than the smell of an RIS is the taste...And this is one great tasting brew. Tons of flavors rush into your mouth at once. I actually had to really concentrate on what I was drinking to pick everything out. There is a blast reminiscent of espresso mocha right up front. Then anise comes thru with hints of pure bean vanilla, and milky caramel. The experience and believe me this beer is an experience ends with the slight burn of alcohol.  M: Full bodied, rich, and creamy.  D: Very drinkable for a RIS.  Overall: Stone just does not disappoint do they? Several of my favorite drinking brews come from this brewery, and I can add this on to the list as another of those beers. The aroma and taste is huge and the price tag is so low.

I poured this into a goblet and formed a 1-1/2"" head of tan frothyness over the ebony of ebonies. This beer pours like used motor oil on a winter day!  The aroma is subtile.... chocolate/roasted malt/coffee. Not as aromatic as my reference RIS.  The Taste: mmm! good! Lots of toasted caramel, with some chocolate and coriander.... very complex and balanced! A bit of smokey alcohol to finish. Oscillating between 4 & 4.5.... OK.... 4.5... seems very similar to my REFERENCE RIS (Hoppin' Frog; B.O.R.I.S. The Crusher).  Mouthfeel: Creamy goodness. A bit of an alcohol bite... just to let you know who's in control here.... Perfect carbonation. Wonderful mouth coating and aftertaste!  Drinkability: Nothing objectionable. HIGHLY RECOMMENDED.... If you like this... Try Hoppin' Frog B.O.R.I.S. The Crusher.... from Ohio. I think Hoppin' Frog just edges this one out... but maybe someday, I'll do a side-by-side comparison with my four favorites:  1) Hoppin' Frog: B.O.R.I.S.

147,1160,kkipple,3.95,"2007 release.  Well well, at last I finally meet the elusive Stone Imperial Stout... this is hard beer to get your hands on in South Carolina, and it took a trip to PA to get some. It's been hyped to death, so I was eager to try it...  This has your classic Russian Stout looks: a dark dark brown (nearly black) beer with a fat, toasty-tan head that fades fast. Opaque and oily looking.  I'm smelling tons of roasted, burnt malt... sweet and dense with hints of prunes, coffee and more malt piled upon malt. My friend thinks it smells like malted milk balls and he's not far off. There's some hidden alcohol, but it's not nearly as upfront as some in this style (Avery...)  The sweetness continues on into the flavor; this is quite sweet compared to others in it's style I've tried. Big burnt / roasted malt upfront, with a bittersweet character that rises above everything else. Mild coffee and milk chocolate flavors swirl on my palate. Perhaps some dark rum? Evident alcohol, but well balanced. Rather tame and mild for the style. Nothing wrong, just nothing terribly interesting.  Mouthfeel is slick and a bit thin, but then I've recently had both a Dark Lord and Abyss, so maybe I'm biased. Sweet, grainy, roasted aftertaste. Pleasant, but a little basic.  This is a good beer, no doubt about it, but I can't help but be disappointed after hearing it hyped to the skies. It's just not thick or complex enough to warrant the praise heaped upon it, in my humble opinion. While a good introduction to the style, there are plenty of breweries who do this one better. Highly recommended if you're breaking into Imperial Stouts. If you already love 'em, try Deschutes Abyss, Dogfish Worldwide, Dark Lord, Storm King, or Gonzo Porter -- all are a few notches above this one.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,96

Chocolate, coffee, bread pudding, cinnamon, plum and old wood (smells kind of like a closet) in the nose.  Starts very very sweet with lots of chocolate and licorice. Dark fruits in the middle -prune, currant, and raisin. Vanilla and cinnamon seem to be hidden behind the more robust flavors. Finish is warming, roasty and dry.  Mouthfeel is thick, smooth, and creamy- a thing of beauty. Overall an contemplative brew that should be purchased by the case to be enjoyed through the colder months and years to come.

147,1160,BabaJohn,3.5,"Looked great in the snifter with lots of carbonation clinging to the sides and a thick tan head, though this faded fast, as expected. Aroma was of sweet caramel, chocolate and molasses, with the characteristic roast and coffee smells as well. At first taste, earthy flavors in the front of the mouth gave way quickly to malty chocolate, followed by strong alcoholic warmth and a bit of herbal hop finish. I found that the malt intensity could be slightly overwhelming and out of balance (how else did they get a 10.8?) If I were Stone I would knock down the gravity just a bit to even things out. My drinkability rating was particularly low as I'm not inspired to knock this one back due to the combined alcoholic slap in the face and the overwhelming maltiness.

I just finished a Limited Spring 2007 and have to say that Stone's Imperial delivers a mighty melange of roasted grain, cocoa, coffee, and a bit of zing as well. Pours black and taste that way, too, but without being overly bitter.  The beer is pretty easy to drink, despite its heft. Take caution: Plenty of alcohol just around the bend. Go easy and enjoy.

147,1160,JerzDevl2000,4.5,"Picked this up a few months ago, since I saw that it was a limited release for 2007. I love Stone's other offerings that I've tried, and the North Coast Old Rasputin was one of my favorite beers of the last year. That being said, I had high hopes for this, and they were met and exceeded. It's the middle of the summer, but this beer is just as drinkable now as it would be in the middle of the winter, when I tend to sample stouts and heavier brews.  The pour was great...not the best I've ever seen, but this was a rich, dark beer that had the aroma and body to back it up. A beautiful, toffee-like frothy head arose as I let the motor-oil like liquid out of my big bottle, and the scents were just as lavish. There's lots of chocolate, espresso, coffee, figs, and a bit of caramel here, and the balance among them all is strong, yet subtle that one doesn't predominate over the other. Don't be mistaken, this is a strong beer and even if the alcohol isn't very detectable, it will sneak up on ya during your drinking session!  The aftertaste of this retains the roasty, bitter aspects quite well, but loses the depth that can be found up front. No matter, the 10.8% ABV is not really a factor here, unless ya like your beer to slowly sneak up out of nowhere and make it's presence known once it's too late to turn back. In that case, Stone has done their job wonderfully here and even though it's not hoppy like many of their well-known beers, it's just as good and worthy of it's own big bottle and limited release. Perfect for year-round quality beer-drinking sessions, or those who aren't afraid to get introspecitve with a stout. Highly recommended!",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,96
147,1160,travisd13,4.6,Served from a 22oz. bottle into a snifter just under cellar temp. Bottled date is 05 and 07. Sat down with some friends and compared the two.  A - Poured both with a small quarter inch head. The head on both was a thick dark tan. The 07 appeared to be much thinner than the 05. Both very dark in color but Ive seen darker.  S  Smells of coffee in both and some what hoppy / piney smell in the 07. Light alcohol presents in both vintages more so in the 07.  T  Both are tasty in their own ways. The 05 seems to have more of a balanced presentation of flavors lead by hints of coffee and chocolate. The 07 with coffee and some chocolate present also a hint of hops.  M  The 05 is thick and smooth with a lasting finish. The 07 is thinner with a clean finish.  D  Im finding the 05 much more drinkable than the 07. Thats fine with me because Ive got a case of 07 in the cellar. With any hope the 07 will develop as well as the 05. Hands down this is still one of my favorite stouts and at $5 a bomber its a steal of a deal.,Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,96
147,1160,Kudashov,2.24,"This brew was going to be enjoyed while watching my beloved Boston Red Sox . I got neither . The Sox game was called off and this beer was not enjoyable . When poured , the color and the crusty bubbled head was nice and very impressive . The head reminded me of the inside of a Crunchie Bar that my folks would bring back to the States from Ireland . The aroma is coffee and boozy . Burnt and overwhelmingly bitter . I have enjoyed the Storm King and Brooklyn Black Chocolate stout . The latter is one of my favs . Stone makes some very tasty brews but this was a mess . It was not a drain pour but it will not be bought again .",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,96
147,1160,franksnbeans,4.5,"Pours black as oil with a huge foamy chocolate milk head that laces for days. Smells of roasted malts, french roast coffee, molassas, fig and slight alcohol. Tastes of dark chocolate notes, dried dark fruits, coffee notes, caramel, molassas and list goes on and on. Nice warming effect and a touch of alcohol finish. Feels full in the mouth with a perfect touch of carbonation. Smooth as silk and the alcohol is extremely hidden considering the high ABV. Crazy drinkable for such a robust stout, I could polish off another bomber or two easy...then wake up the next morning with memories of a delicious brew. A must try.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,96
147,1160,soupyman10,4.85,"Got a bomber of this - impossible to find in Philly where I've been living, but back in Michigan it seems to be everywhere. This one pours a totally black, with light red-brown head that dissolves a little quickly (although that could have been the pour). Nose is lots of licorice, molasses, black current, spices, and a touch of light alcohol. Smells excellent. Somehow, the taste tops it. Coffee, chocolate, dried fruit, molasses, roasted malt, breadiness, and some light licorice. Body is full and creamy, with perfect carbonation. This is a fantastic beer, with a great flavor and body. The only slight problem is the quickly vanishing head and the somewhat mild nose. Otherwise, incredible. Cellaring would only make it better, too.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,96
147,1160,mountdew1,3.71,"Poured into a tulip pint glass. Was a very nice completely opaque very dark brown/black. Had a gorgeous dark brown chocolately colored head. Lacings clung to the sides of the glass the whole time. Smelled like freshly baked oatmeal cookies. Not too sweet, but not to earthy either. Tasted smooth, with a very slight bitterness that reminded my of a very very dark chocolate. Had a hint of coffee hiding in there also. Felt great in the mouth. Very smooth, coated the mouth perfectly. A little bit of bitterness/burning in the throat, but not bad. Too strong to drink fast, but a great brew to sit and sip.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,96
147,1160,ommegangpbr,4.33,"The 2007 edition with the gargoyle wearing that spiffy Russian hat. Holy bananas, batman! I don't think I've ever picked that flavor out of a Russian Imperial stout before, but here it is! This is drinking more like a hoppy quadrupel than a RIS, and that's fine by me. If you wanna take away style points for such a thing, so be it. Still some chocolate flavor in there but there is more of a dark fruit presence than vintages past. Not as delicious smelling as past vintages but still good stuff. I get mostly raisins out of the nose mixed with smoked and roasted scents. Slick and sweet on the palate with a lingering bitterness just underneath the sweetness. Always a pleasant find when on the hunt for a big, dark and hearty brew.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,96
147,1160,BrewSomerville,3.62,"Aroma: Chocolate, coffee, pine needles, ethanol.  Looks: Black. Slightly smaller than average beige head. Poor head retention (down to a thin cover fast). No lace.  Taste: Chocolate, roasted malts, coffee (sweet). Sweetness upfront with flavours listed above, then hop flavours. Long hoppy finish.  Mouthfeel: Full bodied. Carbonation feels light.  Overall, I think it's a good RIS. I didn't get as much of that black liqorice flavour that I dislike as I have with some others.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,96
147,1160,Overlord,4.57,"For a bomber costing five dollars, this beer is phenomenal.  Not the darkest of stouts I've seen (that honor goes to speedway stout). The chocolate and coffee are in perfect harmony, with neither overpowering the other. There is a hint of vanilla, and some type of fruit. Almost feels like currants or raisins. Oddly, this is not the most appealing stout visibly (at least for me). It looks a bit thin, doesn't seem to pour with much of a head, if at all... It's the taste that wows you, not the presentation.  They are sold out here at the Irvine Bevmo, but I've laid down six or seven to carry me over for a while. A great beer, and for my money the best of the Stone offerings.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,96
147,1160,udubdawg,4.7,"22 oz bomber of 2007 vintage - after another 2 years, I'll bet this scores a perfect ""5""  It's a bit of a waste, as this beer needs (IMO) a mimumum of 12 months of age to truly shine, but oh well - I've got more. Sadly I'm drinking this alone - a nice vertical tasting of previous vintages of this beer with friends sounds like a hell of an evening. At 10.8% ABV and 22 oz, there's no way I'm having another of these by myself. Maybe I'll try that tomorrow.  Let's get to it. Don't bother to open this beer at refrigerator temp, or you'll miss much of it. At about 55 degrees viscous glossy liquid flows slowly from the awecome silkscreened bottle into my big ol snifter. Color is deep light-sucking blackness, and I find myself a bit embarassed to have called other beers black. Three fingers of dark tan head quickly form, subside to a thin cap, and then stubbornly decides to stick around despite the ABV. Lacing is spotty over a large region of the glass. Very nice looking beer - too pretty to drink? - well, umm, no.  Aroma is even better. From experience I believe this will improve with age, but it is already very nice. Chocolate makes a big appearance, and sweet dark fruits like raisins, currant, and plums. Alcohol peeps from behind the carmelized and burnt sugars and briefly reminds me of the strength of this brew. I note less coffee than I recall from previous vintages - once again I look forward to a vertical taste test. This is also a bit less overall roasty and more fruity than expected. Somewhat redolent of a baltic porter like Sinebrychoff , or a lighter fruity imperial stout like Samuel Smith. Really complex, and a definite treat.  The taste is far from light and fruity though - this is all Stone IRS. The size of the malt bomb is no surprise, and the flavor is a bit more roasty than the aroma. The bitterness of the aggressive young hops is a bit raw but welcome in the long finish. Silky smooth mouth-coating deliciousness, with just a bit of light carbonation. I don't know that I've ever had a bottled beer I'd rate higher on mouthfeel. Chocolate makes itself known again, and liquorice and carmelized sugar. This a rich drink; downright decadent. I feel a brief pang of regret that I didn't wait until these nice flavors blend together perfectly, but the gargoyle on the bottle screams at me to shut the hell up and drink it. Who am I to argue? If you're looking for a food pairing the obvious answer is chocolate. Nothing too sweet. Few beers of this strength are as drinkable - maybe that isn't such a good thing, but at the moment I'm not about to complain. Now if you'll excuse me, I'm out of nice things to say about this beer, but I'm not yet out of beer.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,96
147,1160,TexIndy,4.33,"Poured from a 650ml bottle - 2007 vintage - into my NBB snifter. It was a solid black color even against the light. It had a small, dense dark brown head that settled into a thin collar. Just a little lacing. The aroma was mostly chocolate with coffee and alcohol in the background. Smell and taste are sweeter than most stouts or amer double stouts. The taste is very smooth and follows the aroma. Very drinkable. The mouthfeel was good but a little watery for a stout. Expected it to be creamy but it wasn't. Overall an excellent beer and glad I finally got to try it. Highly recommend.

147,1160,warmstorage,4.33,"22 ounce bottle, 2007, $5.59 at Brown Jug Warehouse in Anchorage, AK.  Appearance: Pours deep black with a dense, small, medium brown head. Slight, dispersed lacing. Head disappears relatively soon after pouring, not surprising given the high ABV.  Aroma: tar, coffee, creosote.  Taste: prunes, licorice, creosote, tar, roast, all of it strong. Solid alcohol heat, and finishes chocolaty and roasty yum.  Mouth: tingly, sharp, hot alcohol with a pleasant burn that sticks around for a long time.  Overall, it's an excellent beer, and a good example of the RIS style. This bottle is definitely better than many of Stone RIS that I've had: for many years, I think it was a prime example of how extraordinarily overrated some of Stone's beers are due to the cult following the enjoy. That said, this one is worthy of solid scores and praise. It might even, one day, grow up to be as good as Yeti.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,96
147,1160,younger35,4.65,"Drank at a camp site on the shores of Lake Coeur D Alene in Northern Idaho. I took a couple tasty beers to enjoy with the scenery of about the most beautiful place on the planet. Drank out of a clear disposable Rubbermaid cup. Classy!  Appearance- Pours an oily dark brownish black that allows zero light to enter or leave. Not much head even with a very aggressive pour. What head is there is medium brown around the collar dissipating to a light brown in the center. Light, sticky lacing follows the beer down the glass adding to the enjoyment. Smell- Lots of roasted malty goodness here. Roasted chocolate, dark French roast, black liquorices, toasted marshmallow, alcohol and lots of smoky nuttiness permeate out of the glass. All the usual smells that youd expect from an IRS but a tad bit sweeter. Taste- Sweet roasted malts give this beauty a nice light sugary sweet bite up front. Lots of toasty dark chocolate, toffee, liquorices, raisins and other dark fruits make this thing amazing. Its so complex and so smooth its mind boggling. The 10.8% ABV is hardly noticeable although you get a tinge of the alcohol occasionally. Mouthfeel- Silky smooth oiliness that is full and heavy. Tiny little bubbles lend the smallest of carbonation to the beer. Drinkablity- Although I think Stone makes some pretty good beers (AB is pretty good), all-in-all I think they're pretty overrated. This beer is the exception. I thought it was terrific and I can imagine with a little time it would only get better. Its tremendously smooth and balanced and a really phenomenal beer.

147,1160,goschool,4.3,"2004 Vintage. Consumed in August 2007. This was the first beer I cellared.  Appearance: This one pours thick inky black with red hues and a small, fading brown head.  Smell: The aroma has almost none of the dark fruit that younger versions exhibit, but it has more chocolate and I'm a sucker for chocolate. Mocha is probably the better description since there's a bit of sweet Northern Italian espresso as well.  Taste: I am missing the fruit in the flavor profile. The oxidation brings the chocolate into baker's chocolate territory and the espresso component is very sweet. Gingerbread and anise round out the vicious roasted assault.  Mouthfeel: The body is super thick and finishes rough.  Drinkability: I think one to two years is the ideal age for these beers unless you're a big fan of oxidized flavors. It was certainly worth the experience.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,96

Chocolate/ espresso and rasins/ dates. A bit of buttery, nutty maltiness and a long hoppy, spicy finish.  M - Very thick and oily with higher carbonation than I would have expected.  D - I can't find anything to complain about in this one. The flavor and aroma are excellent and the chocolate notes are particularly delicious.

147,1160,Furball,4.56,"Poured into a tulip glass out of a bomber, slightly cool, but by no means cold. First off, this beer is DARK. Nice coffee head that receeds to lace as you drink. At first sniff, I get burnt malts and caramel. As it breaths, notes of licorice and dirt... which isn't too bad. A very earthy brew. The first sip seems to be a bit on the sweet side, almost unpleasant, but there is also a a bite on the tongue that cuts it instantly. You can taste a very roasted character to brew. Not a lot of alcohol tasted, but this being an RIS, it's there. Goes down fairly smooth with little or no aftertaste. Overall, this is a very good brew. Very smooth, reminds me of my favorite oatmeal stout, but just a bit of a bite. This would be paired great with a hearty stew... or just on it's own.

Dark fruity aromas mostly dates,figs,raisins and some licorace with a touch of booze.  Very roasty,burnt bittersweet carmell with lots of malty sweetness. Dark fruityness raisins,dates. Dark chocolate always seems to be lingering around. Syrupy with a very nice balance and hint of boozyness not as much as you would expect for the alcohol content of the beer. Finishes with a very sharp clean dry chocolatey finish. The chocolate lingers on the palate with a residual sweetness. A suprizingly smooth taste,more so than i would suspect from a RIS.  Thick and full mouthfeel,some creamyness and a good bit of cloying. Very enjoyable beer. Very drinkable RIS had no problem putting away a bomber,almost can't belive how easily it went down.

The complexity continues into the flavor and builds as the beer warms- definitely do not drink this one cold.

(3.5 fresh, 4.5 aged 2+ years).  M: Big, robust, but definitely smooth, the alcohol just adds to the character of an already big beer, very well done.

147,1160,ncvbc,4.07,"Pour was thick and black. Tan head rising up and falling within a couple minutes. Smell was of dark, sweet chocolate. Some roasted coffee and dark fruit also present. Not a BIG roasted malt in the nose, but it was there. Taste lacked the depth I had hoped for. I still picked up some dark fruits here, fairly sweet though not so much as the nose suggested. The coffee and chocolate also come through, maybe even a hint of vanilla in there. Warming alcohol also noticeable, in both taste and mouthfeel. Mouthfeel seemed a tad light. Somewhat syrupy thick but not as much as many others. I'd put it on the medium bodied side when all is said and done. I drank the bomber and don't think much more would have been possible. Nothing that I dislike greatly about this one, just thought there might be a little more to it considering its ranking.

S: An outstanding aroma on this brew. Roasted coffee and quite a bit of sweetness shine through in the nose. Surprisingly, the alcohol is not very detectable.  T: A wonderfully complex and flavorful RIS, my favorite one yet. It starts out with some roasted coffee and other malt flavors. The interesting part is that it then transitions into a sweetness that I really enjoyed. Currants, liquorice, toffee, and other dark sweets come into play here. The next thing to hit the palette is some bitter chocolate and espresso coming from the hops. This lingers into the aftertaste as well a lot of warming alcohol.  M: Full bodied with very little carbonation.  D: Certainly not the most drinkable of beers due to the whopping 10.8%. It's definitely a sipper and it's not the smoothest of RIS's. The plus is that there are a ton of complex flavors in this brew. I've got a couple aging in the cellar. It will be interesting to see how it smooths out over time.

147,1160,InsolublePancake,4.7,"A- Black as night with a nice tan head. This is pretty much exactly as a stout should look, only the head goes down a little quickly.  S- Tons of roasted malt; some rich caramel and a touch of alcohol.  T- In a word, decadent (I'm not even sure what that means, but it seems to fit here). Incredibly rich with an amazing roasted malt character. Dark fruit, chocolate, coffee and alcohol are all players in this assault on the palate. Nice hop bitterness on the finish. Amazing.  M- The bottle compares it to Siberian crude. I'd have to disagree; I doubt Siberian crude is carbonated. Other than that, though, I guess it's a pretty apt description.  D- Obviously a sipping beer, although when compared to others within the style, it's easily a notch above. It went down much faster than I expected.  Amazing. This is easily the best stout I've had, and it's not even close. I've admittedly been hesitant to try too many stouts as the style has never been my favorite, but this beer just changed all that.

Roasted malt flavor all over the place, somewhat smokey, with assertive chocolate and coffee tones. For such a high abv, the alcohol blends in quite well due to the massive malt attack. My palate was lovin' every minute of it.  M: An appropriate level of carbonation for the style, heavy body, but at the same time, sort of light in its own regard. Not as heavy as I expected, because the mouthfeel is thick yet silky.  D: This stuff is amazing.

S - a heavy onslaught of toasted grains and a plethora of coffee, chicory and a touch of chocolate. A heavy yeast aroma of doughy goodness.  T - falls a bit short in the fresh version of this, comparitively, but still impressive. Where this brew really shines is the complexity and depth of tastes that remain over the duration of the palate. While the initial nose meets the initial taste as sweet and thick, every taste and aroma previously described, waits in line on your palate to introduce themselves seperately. Beautiful.  M - oily, yep. Can't get more descriptive than that, but I will add that the alcohol is still noticeable in the fresh version as well, but comes out more with age.  D - just one, call me a wimp.

147,1160,kohoutek,3.73,"1997 release. A bit early, but it's nice to look at potential, no?  Pours an opaque black with medium viscosity. Nice persistent espresso crema head. Very small bubbles with what appears to be a softer level of carbonation.  Aromas of clean, neutral smoke, molasses, iron, brown sugar, raisins and other dark fruits. Some underlying oaty, grainy aromas that remind me of cooked breakfast cereal. Steel cut oats pehaps? Herbal, floral hops of noble lineage enliven and round out the darker notes. A persistent yeast character abounds. Some vegemite autolysis and suspended yeast. These microbes must have gone through the ringer to reach 10.8%. One of the downfalls of drinking a beer of this character at this young age - I think . . .* Lots of alcohol aromas, but unlike the normal jet fuel character I get in Stone's usual line-up of big beers.  Many flavors mimic those experienced as aromas. A somewhat messy lack of integration casts these flavors to and fro. A powerful bitterness seems only to highlight the unbridaled character of this brew. The smoke and yeast character dominate the flavor profile. The dark fruits, rich sugars and hop flavors are buried beneath these more forcefully expressed notes. I hope time will lean in this beers favor.  Mouthfeel is suprisingly light and refreshing for a beer of this size. Quite dry for an imp stout. Nice soft carbonation.  The messy flavor of this beer makes it a bit difficult to finish.

Strong black coffee grounds, caramel, molasses, and some Dutch baking chocolate. An amazingly deep roastiness to the thick malt base. This stuff warmths your soul.

147,1160,wingman14,4.58,"Spring 2007 Bomber  Pours black like motor oil with a small dark mocha head. This one is one of the darkest beers I have seen, you cannot see through it even when held to the light. The smell is great, it has some sweet notes and chocolate, some alcohol as expected, with faint burnt notes as well. The taste is very similar, starts sweet, heavy, and malty. It ends strong, powerful, with plenty of alcohol flavor. The aftertaste has the sweet notes with some burnt characteristics. It has a smooth mouthfeel that could overpower most with the finish. Good balance in flavor and carbonation. This isn't an easy drinker considering its ABV, but is an outstanding beer with great flavor and I could have one any time. I suggest that everyone should check out this beer, this is one not to be missed.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,96
147,1160,Graham21,4.15,"Poured Black with a very nice brown head which left a beautiful lacing. Smells Fowel, like a sweaty towel. Malts and deep dark roasted wood smells. Sour coffee undertones with a bit of bitter chocolate. Taste is wonderful; the bittersweet chocolate shines through, a hint of coffeee, hops, and many malts. Balanced well. Not spectacular ...but a damn fine brew.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,96
147,1160,cactusjuggalo,5,"My first 5 and usually i never really freak out about a beer but DAMN!!! Bottle was a limited 2007 release that i aged for about 4 months (i just couldn't wait anymore) poured into a standard pint glass and ejoyed while watching old ECW tapes. Pored black as night and motor oil like, just from the pour you know you are in for a good one. Taste was nice and malty just all around great beer if you can find it buy as many as you can carry and store a few for a bit to get maxium flavor out of it.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,96
147,1160,Cascadia,4.05,"Great beer here. Pours inky back with a thin head that disapates quickly into an oily finish. Smells like roasted coffee and and burnt sugar. Tastes great, very complex and balence bitterness, nice roasty notes at the finish. The 10.8% ABV is very well hidden. Great chewy mouthfeel that coats after a few sips. Sips that quickly turn into gulps. Stone hits all the right buttons on this one.  Cheers!",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,96
147,1160,brantadid,4.73,"Poured black with little to no head. I was a little disappointed in the smell initially but as the beer warmed a bit it became more fragrant. The taste was outstanding. Malty, coffee, chocolate. Hops came through mid to back palate. The alcohol was present but not overpowering. Overall, a very balanced beer from start to finish.  *I am currently aging serval bottles and can't wait to add to this review.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,96
147,1160,DavidSeanNJ,4.7,"22 oz. bomber purchased for $4.99 (what a great deal). Drank it during the finale of The Sopranos (I'm from Jersey, whaddaya expect?)  Poured into a standard pint glass- tar black- thick and creamy- carbonation- looks like octopus ink. small tan head but just enough to give it that perfect stout appearance.  Stone RIS tasted and smelled of cocoa beans/coffee/caramel/alcohol. hops were not upfront but came on strong at the end. Stone RIS burnt the hell out of my throat with each sip that I took- but that almost added to the pleasure of drinking this fine brew. Drinking this was a pleasure- as smooth as could possibly by- the flavors tingled on my tongue-  I would image drinking this during the colder months would be much better- but I still enjoyed the hell out of my bottle. Will be buying as much of this stuff as possible to save for the years to come.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,96
147,1160,CarolinaCardinals,4.23,"Original Review 6-10-2007: Spring 2006 Release picked up at Sportsman's in May 2006. I could not hold out any longer!  Beer poured black as night into my Duvel glass with a limited head - 4.0. Nose is of boozy roasted malts, coffee, and chocolate-4.5. Taste is boozy, roasted malts, some coffee and chocolate, with a blast of hops in the finish-5.0. Mouthfeel is perfect! Creamy smooth roasted hops that glide so nicely across the palate-5.0. Overall drinkability is very good. This is the best RIS for the price. The boozy, malty, hoppy concoction is awesome-4.5!  Re-review from the Stone 2015 ""Classic Release"" on 11-3-18 on a perfect 78 degree day. Picked up a bomber from the Tempe BevMo for $7.49 on 10-29-15. Stored in wine fridge and regular fridge since purchase.  Beer poured black as night with a nice tan head that dissipated quickly - 4.0. Nose is roasted malts, some anise, and a touch of chocolate - 4.0. Taste is really well balanced between the dark chocolate, anise, and roastiness from the malts with a huge amount of hops that blend very nicely - 4.25. Mouthfeel is thick, rich, full, and very satisfying-4.75. Overall this is still a very good beer, not one of the best anymore but good nonetheless.

S: Roasty, chocolately, and boozy.  T: Lots of chocolate and roasted malt, with some licorice and bourbon. Strong, upfront hopping for a RIS. Warm, with a bourbon-ish burn going down. A tad hot right now, could use a couple years to cool down.  M: Good low carbonation, not as thick as I expected.  D: One bomber is enough for a night, but very tasty.  A very good beer, but I'm spoiled by some of the locals (Bell's, Founders, etc). Not the mind blowing experience I was expecting, but still solid.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,96
147,1160,jmalex,4.67,"I went to Martin's Liquors in Mount Laurel, NJ every day for a week after this year's release. Finally I saw 3 bottles sitting on the shelf. So I bought all 3. This is bottle 1.  2007 vintage  APPEARANCE: Pours into my Delirium Tremens snifter absolutely pitch black with even blacker highlights. No light gets through this at all. The head is minimal and light cocoa colored. A few spotty patches are left on the surface as is a thin collar.  SMELL: The smell is deep and chocolaty with a backing of coffee, caramel, and dark fruits. As the beer warms, it becomes a bit more bready and slightly alcoholic. Really, really nice.  TASTE: Oh, nice! It's bourbony and bitter up front and hits you really hard. But then comes the mellowing, and wow, is it nice. Rich chocolate and caramel flood your mouth. It's not as fruity as the aroma might lead on. The finish shows the hops and is the perfect level of bitterness. Burnt black malts also contribute to the bitter finish. This is balanced nicely by the sweet malty flavor that still coat your mouth long after your last sip.  MOUTHFEEL: Thick, syrupy, and it lasts forever in your mouth. Pretty much just what you'd want from an Imperial Stout. Carbonation is at an appropriate lower level.  DRINKABILITY: The hidden alcohol factor is a real winner here. 10.8%?! Are you kidding?! It's a huge beer and one bomber is enough, but any harshness this beer has is virtually non-existent. About as drinkable as it can be.  Crap, now I've only got 2. I'd hate to wait 6 months or more to have another, but it will be well worth it.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,96

A About as dark as a beer can be, which makes me excited to see what its all about  S smell is complex with your typical stout scents coming through, coffee and chocolate mostly, slight licorice, and theres enough booze that you can smell it. Really quite delicious smelling  T This one tastes even better than it smells. You can't talk taste without mouthfeel with this one. Its so thick that the different flavors stick to your mouth and come out over a longer period of time. Like the smell, coffee and chocolate dominate, and theres a strong alcohol presence. Some licorice and rich fruit. Transitions from remarkably sweet to suprisingly bitter. The mouth feel is what dominates the taste though, and what makes it such a delicious dessert type beer, M See above D drinkability is tough with this one. So thick and rich youd think you could only have one, but so delicious your tempted to drink it all night.  overall a wonderful brew. Definately one to sip and enjoy.

147,1160,Mitchster,3.58,"$5.99 for a 22oz bottle. Limited Spring 2007 release. 10.8% ABV. 90+ IBU's. Hopped with Warrior. I swear I had this brew before, but I guess I haven't actually reviewed it.  Pours out to a very dark burnt black, almost like motor oil without the silky sheen. Forms a pancake batter-like dark cocoa head with excellent retention and nice sticky lacing. Carbonation is mild to moderate. The aroma is at first very yeasty, followed by burnt grains, prune juice and green hops. Alcohol not initially noticed in the nose. Mouthfeel is viscious and very smooth with a dense, full body. Great mouthfeel. The taste isn't quite as heavy or dense as I was expecting...black currant, burnt malts, prune juice, vanilla, molasses, black walnut....very herbal hops throw it off with an odd character. Bitterness is moderate. The yeast imparts a strong ale yeasty character with some not-so-pleasant off-flavors and some slight fusels. Somewhat oxidized in it's finish with some ruddy dankness in the middle. Herbal hops linger in the finish. Alcohol isn't really tasted.  Well, I'm not very impressed with this offering from an otherwise impressive brewery. I would certainly take Rasputin or Founder's RIS over this in a heartbeat I bought 2 bottles of this so maybe I'll come back and edit my review if anything changes.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,96
147,1160,dangle47,4.5,"Poured into a pint glass from the bottle. When I poured it I noticed its massive thickness, kind of like molasses. The head had a copperish tint to it, unlike a foamy white you would get from a nicely poured Guiness. Smelled of espresso with a hint of it's alcohol content. Went down surprisenly smooth without the alcohol overpowering my tastebuds. No burning sensation here! I would have to put this as one of my favorite stouts.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,96
147,1160,Ieatlambfries,4.45,"Poured into a snifter. Jet black and viscous looking. A brown head of fine bubbles that only reaches about 1/2 inch. Scant lacing coats the side of the snifter with each sip, and quickly fades away.  Smells of caramel, burnt molasses and salt water toffee. A faint earthy hop aroma lingers in the background.  Upfront flavors of caramel and espresso. Burnt molasses, cocoa powder and a hint of licorice. Hoppy in the back end with a sweet malt finish.  Thick mouthfeel. Heavy body. Very drinkable for such a rich stout. The alcohol is nicely hidden which makes this go down easy. Very much recommended",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,96
147,1160,gunnerman,4.47,"2007 bottle  Poured into the Stone Russian Stout snifter, pours a complete pitch black with a dirty dark head that doesn't hang aroung other than a ring around the glass, little lace. Smell is of chocolate, coffee, cake, sweet roasted malt and barley, this smells very nice and tasty. Taste is inviting, strong coffee notes, velvet chocolate, and just a bit of bitternes towards the end, I am also picking up a taste of wood in the mix as well, this is simply awesome. I had high expectations of this brew seeing the fine high reviews and believe me this is simply an awesome creation, now let me go back to enjoy the remainder of the bottle.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,96
147,1160,theopholis,4.52,"Appearance - Black. Black as Pete Rose's heart. Even when held right up to a 100 watt bulbe, you get a hint of caramel in the last few atoms on the outside. Otherwise...black as Darth Vadar's underwear. No head at all. This really surprised me. You get a very small, tight cap of light brown.  Aorma - Mostly freshly roasted coffee. Some malt sweetness peaks in, but mostly coffe aroma. A hint of smoke and burnt toast sneak in as it warms.  Taste - Not as over-powering as you might expect. Not subtle, but a nice blend of malt sweetnees with molasisi overtones, followed by roasted matls and bittering hops.  Mouthfeel - The body is perfect. Not to heavy, not to light. The CO2 level is tigt and leaves just a hint of CO2 burn on the tip of your tounge. IT's just sticky neough to coat the inside of your mouth and leave you with a very nice after-taste without being obnoxious.  Drinkability - This definatly is not a day-time beer. A great, last beer of the day, watching a great old war film or listenning to the crickets getting it on.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,96
147,1160,ski271,4.65,"On tap at Zenos in State College. A- Almost pitch black with a tinge of red at the edges of the glass. Head is small, foamy, and dark tan and quickly diminishes to a persistent film. Some good lacing early. S- Intense, deep roasted malts dominate but with a very light fruitiness in there too adding some balance to an otherwise malt-bomb aroma. Coffee, dark chocolate, alcohol, dark fruit, caramel, and vanilla T- Even more of a malt-dominance here than in the nose. Roasted malts are HUGE! All of the above characteristics, plus raisin and black cherry. A wonderful light citrus hops presence shows up on the finish. M- Full body, chewy texture, and soft carbonation. D- Fantastically complex yet remarkably easy-drinking for as big and heavy as it is. Almost a little too sweet at times, but the finish more than makes up for that. Definitely worth trying.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,96
147,1160,BBM,4.53,"It feels like the middle of summer, but this beer still hit the spot. It poured a beautiful jet black from the tap, slowly finishing with a thick, chunky brown head. It really is a pretty beer. The aroma means business. Woody, dark fruits, alcohol, all tease the nostrils.  I will admit I had a certain expectation going into this beer, but after the first sip, I realized why all other Imperial Stouts are playing from behind. A wonderfully complex palate, alternating from sweet dark fruits and chocolate to a stern, warming alcohol. There is a definite roasted flavor here, along with hints of sweet molasses. Each sip invites another. The mouthfeel is full-bodied and creamy. Even at 11% this beer is incredibly drinkable, and for me is the gold standard of Russian Imperial Stouts.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,96
147,1160,Maerzen,4.08,"Had this on tap last night at Toronado where they were featuring Stone beers. Pours extremely dark, almost black. The foam is thick and a dark mocha. Nice mix of hop, malt and chocolate. The alcohol is present on the palette. Very enjoyable. Definitely a beer to sit and enjoy slowly. A bit over powering for food.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,96
147,1160,CortexBomb,3.91,"Had the luck of running into this on tap at Ashley's in Ann Arbor.  Textbook Imperial pour, jet with a tan head on top, good lacing, really hard to find any fault here. The nose is heavy on the chocolate with other subtle, sweet tones also present...sugar, caramel.  The flavour on this was a fairly standard take on the style. A malty profile with the chocolate and caramel tones from the nose coupled with the roasty backbone that makes the Russian style what it is. Not a lot of hops present. I like the direction that they were going with the flavour, but it is almost too well-balanced, it's tasty, but nothing really jumps out at me either.  The mouth on this was thick, coating, appropriate for the style. Tremendous marks for the easy drinking nature of this though, no problem drinking a pint, I would say it is amongst the most drinkable of the big Russian Imperials that I've had.  The bottom line: This isn't a bad beer, but it is not as exceptional as Stone's other big beers. I wouldn't pass one up, but there are many others in the style that I enjoy more.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,96
147,1160,Damian,3.6,"Drank from a 1 pt. 6 fl. oz. bottle purchased at Liquor World, Cambridge, MA Bottle label read: ""Limited Spring 2007 release""  Poured an absolutely opaque, pitch black with no head but rather a thin, coffee-colored film of lace that transformed into a clingy ring.  The aroma was powerful and complex. Coffee, powdered cocoa, brown sugar and a rich, rummy alcohol presence were instantly recognizable. A powdery, yeastiness lingered in the background. As the beer warmed, notes of oak, bourbon, raisins and dark fruits (and possibly bananas) came out as well. An oxidative character, similar to wet paper, also became detectable.  The taste was deep, dark and intense. A roasted, almost burnt maltiness was noticeably strong up front. Sweeter notes of brown sugar, dried fruits (raisins, currants and prunes) and rummy alcohol came through mid-palate. At 10.8% ABV, however, I was astonished at how well the alcohol was masked. Slight oxidative notes were also detectable and became progressively more apparent as the beer warmed. An oaky, bourbon-like flavor came out as well. The beer became quite hoppy (clean, crisp, minty hops) on the back end, with the hops turning bitter as they carried into the very dry, tannic finish. The hop bitterness lingered on my palate for what seemed to be an eternity.  Mouthfeel was ridiculously thick and viscous, with a nice creamy frothiness for added measure. This was unquestionably one of the most deep, dark, rich, thick and overall intense imperial stouts I have ever sampled.  While many applaud its extreme nature, I felt somewhat overwhelmed by its flavor profile, which came off as rather sharp and astringent at times. This is a good beer, but I am not sure that it deserves the attention it receives.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,96
147,1160,cbreitro,4.18,"This is a fine beer. Imperial stouts are one of my favorite styles. Stone has a great stout. It is dark, the head was not very thick, but not bad. The smell was a bit bland. I liked the taste. I would rate it higher if it had a more complex taste. Not hoppy enough for my taste.  Perhaps the best thing about Stone's imperial stout is its drinkablility. Though strong, it does not have a strong alcohol taste.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,96
147,1160,ndekke39,4.92,"Split a bomber of this with a good friend. Part of the Spring 2007 Limited Edition release. Pours a completely opaque black with a thin, off-white head. Poured it into a brandy snifter - maybe the wrong glass, but it seems to fit. Wow! What complex aromas and flavors! Smells like so many things: dark chocolate, dark roasted coffee, raisins, cherries, caramel, molasses, all with a smoky tip to it. Tastes are wonderfully balanced: dark and sweet flavors of molasses, brown sugar, cherries, raisins, and chocolate. Nice bitterness from the coffee and a touch of hops. The flavors travel nicely through the sweet and bitterness, and ends with a wonderful smokiness. Nice, thick mouthfeel - perfect for the huge flavors at work here. Still, none of the elements are overpowering, which makes this a wonderful, highly drinkable beer. I'm looking forward to having this beer again.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,96
147,1160,mcallister,4.08,"Been waiting to try this on tap and now is the time. 2007 edition.  Completely opaque nearing midnight. Head is thick and tightly wound. A rich shade of mocha. Falls leaving little lacing into a foamy top.  Rich with dark chocolate semi sweetened. Hints of roasted coffee, mollasses, toffee, cooking caramel, with black currant, black cherry, vanilla bean, and an alcoholic expression.  Thick, chewy, full, rich, forever finishing mouthfeel. Nice somewhat citrusy hop, bitter hop finish. Rich and roasty flavors with a tingly feeling on the toungue. Anise lending toward black licorice. Full and oozing fudge and dark chocolate. RS is decent and I like the inclusion from keeping this bone dry. Black chocolate covered cherry, chocolate covered raisin, rum soaked raisin, and vanilla fill out the mouthfeel with both black currant and read currant esters.  Delicious and easy to drink. Needs some time to tame itself however.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,96
147,1160,SaucyA,4.12,"I wouldn't consider this the end-all/be-all of beers, but it's another great offering from Stone.  2007 batch, found at a local supermarket, managed to snag the last two bottles. One for now, and one for later!  A - Looks great, how an imperial stout should pour. Great dark head, but leaving little lacing. I'm curious as to how clean the glass I poured it into was orignally. BLACK, oily goodness.  S - Smell is great but dare I say.. could be better? I'm not getting much more than a crazy yeast affect, with tinges of chocolatey malt undertones. I smell coffee and a MAJOR alcohol overtone as well. My mouth IS watering.  T - Perfect. What a RIS should taste like. I've never had a better offering, on tap or in bottle. The variety of flavors is definitely second to none, and should be experienced by all BA's. Served a little cooler than room temperature, nuances jump out at you like hot embers from a fire. Chocolate, plums, raisins, coffee, alchohol, anise (barely)... all put together with a creamy silk-like mouthfeel. As if they weren't already aware, Stone really does a great job with this beer.  D - The only qualm I have against this HUGE beer is the abv, which can smack you in the face quicker than you'd like to imagine. I've only nipped my glass a couple times and already feel the effects. I can't imagine drinking more than 2 bombers.  All in all, another beautiful beer from Stone. They really know how to brew a good drink!",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,96
147,1160,cpn920,4.35,"Simply put, the best beer I have ever had. Certainly I have not experienced as many different beers than many of the reviewers on this site, but again the best beer I have ever had. The visual appeal is amazing. The darkness of the stout is unlike any others that I have experienced. It had a wonderful rich smell and the taste lived up to it's appearance. The taste was incredibly smooth considering it's abv. I sipped this beer after dinner and could have drank two or three but I probably would not be able to walk or talk. Truly a great drinking experience.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,96
147,1160,ArrogantB,4.24,"2006 bottle 05/14/2007  Cellared for a year. I poured this beer into my snifter and it was a dark black with slight brown edges. A short brown head faded quickly until no bubbles were left. The smell was slightly chocolate. The taste was vinous and reminded me of wine. There was a little plum flavor going on. This was much better than the 2007 bottle I had a couple weeks back but this can probably still use a year on it.  2007 bottle 02/23/2008  Beautiful smell like gourmet chocolates, an amazing improvement over the last year. This beer is a really good example of a cellar-worthy beer.  2006 bottle 04/20/08  This is about two years old now and I'm a little disappointed in how its aged. It doesn't taste as good as the 07 I had a couple months back. It has almost six bubbles total and no carbonation. It is sticky sweet but no chocolate or roasty flavors, mostly dark fruits. hopefully this will pick back up in a couple months.  2006 vintage 01/10/09  smells malty grains, some chocolate, tastes good and probably can't get much better. Drink 'em if you got 'em.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,96
147,1160,Georgiabeer,4.32,"Poured out of a 22oz bomber that had beeen aged for one year. Poured black with a brown head that faded quickly and left minimal lacing. The smell was of sweet stewed dry fruit, especially prunes and dark cherries; as well as dark malt, a touch off soy, and a hint of anise at the end. The aroma of alcohol has been tamed by the aging. The taste is very mellow at this point, and markedly similar to the aromas with the addition of a tasty black licorice finish. The mouthfeel is smooth and creamy, but not remarkably so. After some aging, this one is pretty drinkable. Overall, a very good beer, and probably more drinkable and enjoyable for the aging, but probably not quite the elixer its made out to be. Quite good, but don't kill yourself trying to find it.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,96
147,1160,boxofepilepsy,4.84,"bomber to .5 liter glass. pours completely black with a notable head the color of chocolate milk.  smell- huge roasted malt presence with chocolate and a little coffee. i can't find the alcohol.  the complex taste of this beer even exceeds the hype. a lot of roasted malts dominant with dark chocolate, espresso and woody flavors. sweet caramel is subtle. everything in balance. again, the alcohol nearly invisible. a very thick brew.  drinkability is much better than i had expected. despite its complexity and powerful alcohol content, i could sip this one all night. one of the best beers i've ever tasted.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,96
147,1160,sessycuban,4.88,"Sampled the limited 2007 release.  Appearance - The pour on this beer is incredible. You get the rich black of a motor oil, minus the viscosity. You also get a very thin dark head on the end of the pour. I'm particularly impressed with the lacing. This beer holds well.  Smell - The smell is very malty. I wouldn't call it overwhelming, but despite the high IBUs on this beer, the malts really come through.  Taste - Wow. This is no joke. The taste is very complex, but what I find more remarkable is how the high ABV is truly palatable. I get chocolate and coffee hints, but its almost secondary to the all-around great taste of the beer. The combination of the flavors and above all the maltiness of the beer really comes together to create something truly magnificent.  Mouthfeel - Thick. Drinking this beer is much like eating a loaf of bread, but as long as you know what you're getting into, the mouthfeel should not put you off. Don't mistake thick for chunky. This is an incredibly smooth beer; you're going to find uniform consistency from the first drop to the last.  Drinkablity - This is the ideal special release. It comes out at the right time of the year so that you can compare it with other Imperial Stouts. This one definitely ranks among the finest. In closing, I think this is perhaps the first beer I've ever had that I wasn't so much concerned about food pairings. I think this beer is so good that food pairings are almost a distraction to the complexity of this offering.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,96
147,1160,bjoyce12,4.28,"Wow, you're getting what you expect with this stout. Pours a dark, dark, brown, nearly black. Good brownish-copper head that lingers. But it's in the taste and feel of this beer that you get your money's worth. A strong flavor of rye bread comes through with first sip and lasts to the last drop. A full, dense drink that I compare more to a hearty stew than a beer. Stone packs an incredible amount of taste into it, and with 10.8% abv, it packs a wallop. A great choice to accompany a meal on a winter's night.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,96
147,1160,torchedpunk,4.15,"This guy is a monster. Sipped slowly from the big bomber.  Appearance- Pours a BEAUTIFULLY dark almost syrup like texture. Contains a subtle dark brown head around the rim. You can't see through it and it looks like a darker flat coke.  Smell- The smell consists of maltiness. It is not overwhelming, and it actually is almost a facade to its mighty kick in the face taste. The malts are really something though. You can smell the blend it is smoothly perfected.  Taste- This is the monster that is Stone. It is strong and malty and the alcohol is more then palpable. It is truly great, but it is not for the faint of heart. I loved its power and authority but it was a little to strong for me. This may be the strongest stout I've had yet, almost working its way up to the complexity of a Quadruple but twice as thick. I felt a little taken advantage of when I finished it, I was honestly waiting for it to apologize and hand me my pants back.  Mouthfeel- Thick and hearty. Great example of an Imperial Stout, and so far my most complex.  Drinkablity- Smoother then the Brooklyn Chocolate, but this one was harder to drink in terms of bite. I feel like it starts out welcoming then it turns into a bull and the power really shows you what's up.  Another greatly offensive beer from Stone, Oh how I love them so.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,96
147,1160,westweasel,4.48,"Poured from a 22 oz. bomber into a Sam Adams tasting glass.  Appearance - A dark, opaque dark brown/black liquid with a thin tan head. No lacing is left on the glass as it goes down. Appears to be very thick.  Aroma - It's all about roasty. I'm picking up some coffee and chocolate also.  Taste - Roastiness dominates. Some coffee and chocolate are in there. Most noticeably, there is no strong alcohol flavor.  Mouthfeel - Full with a medium finish.  Drinkability - Fantastic for this style. Nothing in this is too overpowering, yet it is still full of flavor. It's amazing that you can't really taste the alcohol going down.

S - Aroma of dark roasted coffee and black currant.  T - WOW! This is an exceptionally tasty stout. The best I've had this season. Roasted flavor, 10.8% abv is very well hidden in the taste.  M - Thick and creamy, mild carbonation, goes down smooth and easy.  D - I said you couldn't taste the alcohol, but damn, you will sure feel it. Drinkability is still a little better than 'good'.  Overall this is a very fine example of the style and like I said before, it's the best Imperial Stout I've had from this year's offerings.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,96
147,1160,StargherKing,4.13,"Been looking forward to this one for a while. Pours dark, jet black, with coffee-colored head. A less beer-savvy friend watched the pour and asked if I was drinking beer or motor oil. Smell was coffee, caramel, some fruity notes (grape? currant maybe?), and just a hint of toffee. The taste is bitter, a lot more hops than I was expecting (though since this IS a Stone brew I suppose I should have known), with a strong coffee/toffee flavor, undercurrents of caramel and that same grape/currant flavor that I noticed in the aroma. Mouthfeel is very thick, but it seems like the carbonation and bitter hops keep it from coating too much. Personally, the 10.8 ABV on this one hit me like a load of bricks. Reading the bottle, they reccomend buying in bulk and cellaring to enjoy the aging...I may just have to try that.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,96
147,1160,SaltyLime,4.78,"I have found my precious. I started with one bomber to sample and have since bought every bottle I find at the local liquor stores.  Appearance - Black with a cappuccino brown colored one-finger thick head that lasted to the end. Poured thick and reminded me of motor oil.  Smell - Very little if it is still too cold. Let it warm up a little and the joy of chocolate and roasted malts come out.  Taste - The light aromas threw me off with the first taste, this one kicks ass. This complex beer hits your palate in layers, first is the maltiness which is probably initiated by the foamy head. Next comes a little bite of hops, not too bitter and not too subdued. Then it finishes off with a dry, soft taste of roasted coffee beans. Solid flavor.  Mouthfeel - Thick. No pesky carbonation. Mellow.  Drinkability - Drinking any beer after this is a step down. Be mindful of the ABV, it's so good that I always seem to forget.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,96
147,1160,quikfish13,4.82,"Straight from the bomber, this brew poured a thick and rich black. A very foamy brown head tops my glass of crude motor oil. The head lasts the entire time I write this review.  Upfront smells of chocolate and roasted malts. A nice hint of coffee but with a definete sweet undertone to the smell.  A very nice bitter coffee taste upfront with a hint of cocoa. The chocolate doesn't come through until the very end. There is a definete alchohaulic bite to it but the earthy malts and hops mask it well. Stone brews for people who like BEER, and it shows in the bold flavors in this one.  Very thick and creamy but a smooth beer that goes down very easliy witch I find somewhat surprising for this style. I could drink on this for a while.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,96
147,1160,montageman,4.92,"Poured into a La Chouffe tulip. The color is pitch black with a very nice tan head that goes away fast leaving a little bit of lacing - not as thick as some stouts I've had. Smell is roasted coffee, dark chocolate, some anise/black licorice, and some dark fruit - very nice. The taste is precisely what an Imperial stout should taste like, IMO - big dark roasted coffee up front segues into dark chocolate and a nice note of tart cherry & anise. The finish is dry and mellow. The mouthfeel is very creamy and thick, but a could be a little richer. This is one mighty fine brew - very tasty and easy to drink. It'll be interesting to see how this stands up next to Dark Lord. Another winner from Stone. Highest Recommendation.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,96
147,1160,swhitt,4.58,"This is one seriously delicious beer. I haven't been reviewing in a while due to laziness, but this one prompted me to get of my lazy ass and open up notepad. I had the 2006 last year, and it was good. This bottle is from the Spring 2007 release and it is absolutely amazing. Courtesy of the Wine Gallery Kenmore in Boston- those guys are great, check them out.  Pours completely black into my dogfish head pint glass with an off-brown foamy head. This isn't very heady but it still looks damn good. Smell is malty and dark chocolate/espresso with a bunch of floral notes from the hops. Taste is smooth and accentuated by the hops. ROASTY and some serious (but good) alcohol heat. Wow.  I got a half case, but I doubt I'll be able to age any of these.

Roasted malts,some sweet chocolate,coffee and fruit smells.  Roasted malt,then some sweet chocolate.The taste sticks to my gums and leaves a dank aftertaste in the rest of my mouth.Coffee notes and some fruit notes.

I think this was a different year than the bottle I had before, but it doesn't seem to have changed much. Tap version is a little more kicky with the alcohol presence (negative for me) and noticeably smoother and less carbonated in the mouthfeel (positive).  Also, it kicked my ass after having not eaten most of the day. Oops.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,96

147,1160,jomo,4.65,"Black as night with a tan, two fingers head. Head is airy with big bubbles, so it dissipates quickly.  Has malty, coffee aroma. Very inviting.  Taste does not dissapoint. A balanced combination of smoke, malt, sugars and bitterness. I didn't notice the alcohol, but I rarely do.  In the mouth, the brew is a bit thinner than I expected, but still creamy. The carbonation is light, but aggressive (if this makes sense). You can really feel the bubbles attacking your tongue. I've had better carbonation. Feels better if you let the beer sit for 10 minutes or so....  Drinkability? Fine for a imperial stout.  Not the first imperial stout I would grab, but undoubtably a really good one.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,96
147,1160,EStreet20,4.85,"My first crack at the '07. Poured into a snifter glass.  A - Visciously black liquid topped by a nice sized tan head. Totally opaque brew. Head stays nicely. A few lace rings on the snifter walls.  S - I get some coffee, some chocolate. Little bit of boozy smell as well.  T - Smooth and sweet. Carries some roastiness and finishes with a nice wash of bittterness. A great, layered bunch of flavors. Some black licorice thrown in. Really a complex brew.  M - Big and full. Coarts your mouth and really allows the flavors to roll around.  D - Each sip makes you want more. Complex. Sweet and bitter. Many flavors to mull over that all tie together nicely.  Notes: Bravo on another great IRS year from Stone. Great fresh, and I'd wager great with some age as well.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,96
147,1160,shirfan,4.35,"Completely opaque black, with an average sized dark tan head.  Aroma of roasty malt, greasy barbeque smoke, charcoal.  Taste is big on dark, roasty flavors with more smoky, burnt tones over top of hardwood notes. Starts smooth and incredibly creamy, then alcohol pushes through without adding too rough a feel. Very mild floral hops dot an otherwise pitch black taste array. Finish smooths out again with a drying, almost greasy thick smokiness.  Good balance for such a huge, heavy beer -- at no point is it overly alcoholic, nor bitter, nor dry. A nearly flawless RIS.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,96
147,1160,biking4beer,3.5,"Bomber split with a friend and poured into a pint glass.  This beer is black, black. No light gets through. Poured aggressively and still only ended up with a slight tan head that dissipates to a whisp. Decent lacing.  Good aromas with this one. Roasted malts, coffee, chocolate. Chocolate, probably dark, is the big one here.  Taste is of ths same. Dark chocolate is the predominant flavor, but it's almost too sweet. Very bitter. Burnt/roasted malts. Coffee/espresso. Too bitter in the finish. Alcohol is very prevalent.  The carbonation is low. It's a very creamy beer, and thick, but not thick for an Impy Stout. I found it rather thin for the style.  Drinkability is definitely low. I'm glad I had someone to share this bomber with. I even had a hard time getting down my half. I have few more bottles of this, and I probably won't even touch another one for a year. Normally I would wait six months, but I had the same experience with a 6 month old 06 on tap. This one is not ready to be enjoyed in my opinion.  I did have some Green & Black's 70% Dark Chocolate with this beer (after my notes). It definitely helped quell the bitterness, but the alcohol remained. I typically like both those characteristics in a beer, but it's too much in this one right now.  I'll revisit this review after some aging.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,96
147,1160,Phatz,4.05,"I have had Stone Imperial Russian Stout several times now. First one was side by side with Speedway Stout and it just didn't stand up. Second was at a tasting when my palate was smashed and though I liked it seemed hot and I didn't feel I could write a fair review the third time was when I took my most thorough notes on the beer with several servings and then the fourth time was blindly in a stout tasting. Though I really enjoy this beer, must say I'm not sure it is in my All-time top 8 beers and it certainly can not compete with Péché Mortel, Alesmith and *certainly* not Founders Kentucky Breakfast Stout. I think Stone beers may get a bias a tad because of all the rest of there great beers. Still, I love it. Appearance: Pours Black with a short light brown head. Smell: Rich chocolate, malts, vanilla and a warm boozy alcohol. Taste: Chocolate malt, and an aggressive roastyness paired with bitter hop bite and a boozy heat makes this a monster to be reckoned with. Mouthfeel: Creamy and smooth not nearly as thick as I expected. It works for this hot beer though to be a tad lighter in the mouth. Drinkability: The alcohol is a bit inhibiting when it comes to trying consume this in less than an extended sitting. Take your time with it. I was told that this is a beer that reaches all of it's hype after a year or more in the cellar. I will certainly come back to it again in the future.  Hope this is helpful.

As stated earlier, my favorite beer ever. I find something new in every bottle and every taste. Mouthfeel: silky, smooth, abrasive in a good way, malty, heavy Drinkability: Easily consumed and hard to share. I have only had the 2006 and 2007 versions of this beer after searching for a while for this offering. I love it and can't wait to drink my other bottle of '07 as well as future bottlings of this magic elixir.

147,1160,illidurit,4.76,"2007 vintage poured into a pint glass. The beer is murky and black; the carbonation struggles to make its way to the top where it crests as a beautiful tan froth of a bit less than an inch.  Immediately my nose is pummeled with scents of chocolate and coffee, as well as a subtle alcohol sharpness.  The balance in this beer's taste is impeccable; like eating a chocolate-covered coffee bean it starts out sweet and then melds seamlessly into a slightly bitter roasty flavor. Booziness makes an appearance as the beer warms.  The mouthfeel here is just exceptional. Full bodied with just enough carbonation to prevent it from being cloying. Ridiculously smooth.  Drinkability is phenomenal.  Absolutely lives up to the hype and my expectations. Superb.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,96

Even the smallest sip just fills the mouth with a cacaphony of flavors. Sip this one to get the most mileage out of it! It's like a chocolate shake beer!

147,1160,RidiculedDisplay,4.57,"2006 Edition. I bought this from a place I trust to keep their beer refrigerated and in the (relative) dark. I always seem to find Stone's RIS a bit too warm/alcohol-y when it's young, so we'll see how this does.  Appearance: Thing is literally impenetrable by light. Pours with a barely there froth, but the froth is menacing. The most consistently tan/coffee-colored stout foam I've ever seen. Just a solid, dark, menacing (I know, this is an adjective that comes up a lot with stouts or this stout in particular, but it's entirely appropriate) stuff that also produces some bubbly, cauldronically tan lacing. Again, the body? It's a solid black.  Smell: A familiar RIS aroma, amplified a bit. A deep nuttiness at first - almond, walnut, followed by a stinging, bittersweet chocolate. Massively roasty - dark, dark, dark coffee beans. A fragrant perfumey quality that reminds one of cinnamon or nutmeg. Some hint of fig, plums, dark fruits. All typical RIS flavors, yes, but boldened. I think complaints of Stone's ""bigger is better"" brewing philosophy being fallacious can decidedly fall on deaf ears with an RIS. RIS's should be large, and Stone does it perhaps better than anyone.  Taste: A slight metallic quality. Not sure where that comes from, but it does knock down the rating a bit. Sort of infuses with the alcoholic sting, which is present still but is, yes, MUCH more toned down after a year of brooding. Very bitter turkish coffee, more present in the initial taste than I'm used to, but also, familarally for the style, on the back end. Some creamy quality, sort of like coconut milk and some cinnamon-like Indian spices. Chocolates of many different, difficulty pinpointed varieties. Some raisin or other dried fruit qualities on the back end I have difficulty pinpointing. Cranberries?  Mouthfeel: Lightly carbonated, otherwise thick. Not astringent by my estimation.  Drinkability: A year on this does it wonders. I think I'm converted - not to Stone, but to their RIS.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,96

Poured from a 22oz. bomber into a snifter, the Stone RIS is absolutely jet back, with a medium sized burnt tan head that quickly faded to a thick collar with mild skim, leaving only the slightest lace. Served at cellar temp. The aroma is rich and deep, toasted malt and sweet, with caramel, cinnamon, anise, vanilla and coffee. And lots of alcohol! The taste, whoa is it rich! Sadly, not nearly as deep as the aroma - I'm hoping that will drastically change for the better with time. Very roasted and boozy, not nearly as sweet as the aroma, lots of bittersweet chocolate that fades to a pure alcohol finish. Holy hobo breath! The mouthfeel is heavy and a bit oily, with a slight creaminess This is not to drinkable right now. For one, it tastes way to boozy. Two, it is boozy! 10.8% ABV, how many of these do you think you can drink in one sitting? Rather then try to find out, why don't you just stash some for a while, and then savor one or two on occasion. As they so altruistically suggest on their label, ""We recommend getting a case (of our expensive most expensive beer!) and opening a bottle every 3 to 6 months to enjoy it's journey."" I opted for four, and will probably have 1 a year or so. As I often feel about young RISs, this was nothing that will have me clamoring to break into my stash earlier then I should.

This stout is so thick, that the bubbles struggle to move. Head dies down fairly quick but some stickiness remains here and there throughout. Smell is of roasted coffee/nuts with a molasses/brown sugar scent that tingles the nose a bit. Alcohol is a bit there as well, but not overpowering by any means. Taste, mmmMMM!!! Thick malty goodness dominates this amazing brew. Very mild hints of hops, but just enough to balance this one out just about perfectly. As this warms, it seems to become a bit sweeter with a more powerful roasted caramel presence. So smooth, so flavorful, so well balanced for a 10.8% abv. Such a great job done by Stone once again.

Smells a bit of alcohol, green apple, and deep roasted malts have a bit of sinus issues now so hard to smell too much. Taste starts with dark chocolates, transfers to a nutty mid, and finishes with a coffee/alcohol bite masked by piney hops. Alcohol leaves a bit of a sour-ish aftertaste that lingers, along with the warming feeling :-D. A great full balanced brew that is definetely worth a try, I could definetely drink this one again.  Ok my second bottle, I had at room temperature, and this stout has got to be one of the most balanced brews that I have had. The taste of this brew at room temp was much better, so do not refridgerate this one, the aftertaste was well disminished and the alcohol taste was not noticeable at all.

The nose is all roasted barley and molasses. 10.8% alcohol is alarmingly well-hidden here, especially for a bottle with little age to it.

Smell is of dark roast coffee, a bit of molasses, and dark chocolate.  The molasses hits the tongue right away immediately followed by the dark roasted coffee. The chocolate then splits through and blends with what seems to be a slight dark fruit flavor, possibly prunes or dates. All of these swirl together in a nice creamy finish. The alcohol is very well masked.  The mouth feel is nice and viscous. The carbonation is balanced perfectly. Just where it all should be for the style.

Smell: Malt is a dominant attribute in the nose. More chocolate than espresso IMO.  Mouthfeel: Thick, baby... all thick... man, like the bottle states, all Siberian crude. Oh hell yeah. The CO2 is just right, not too harsh at all, but present.  Taste: The malt flavor which I usually don't like in a beer is incredibly enjoyable. I get these hints of spice that just peek out enough to let you know they're there, yet do not dominate, letting your palate explore the malt complexities. Alcohol in amounts that warm you just right, rather than turning abrassive.  Drinkability: I'd say HELL YES it's drinkable. Tops in it's field. No question.  All in all, follow the bottle's suggestion: get a case, store it away and open a bottle every 3 to 6 months to enjoy its travel through complexities.

I was fortunate enough to be able to taste the 2003 IRS the previous week, but they had just run out when I arrived today. They were also offering a 2005 IRS for growler fills only in the gift shop. The 2004 stout poured black with a creamy thick yellow-brown head and smelled of roasted brown sugar, alcohol, and dark chocolate. The taste was a little metallic up front, with notes of bitter dark chocolate, cocoa, black cherries, and woody hop. The beer finished roasty, with a powdery-cocoa, peppery tongue-numbing, and slightly syrupy medicinal finish. Despite finishing every last drop of the beer, the inside of the glass remained stained with a thick brown sugary glazing clinging all the way to the rim. A mellow-smooth relaxing buzz emanated from the 10+% ABV. I enjoyed a second 2004 IRS after brunch paired with the espresso drizzled cardamom coffee cake.

Nose is a thick balance of pancake molasses nose and ever so slight bubble gum cherry.  First swigs: Roasted malt with cherry hints. Boozy stout with some cocoa and maple syrup. Buttery pancakes with syrup. Thick chewy bread dough notes that are not quite coffee but in a coffee sort of arena. More like rum and coffee. Half way through the warming, a bit of waffle creeps into the flavor, with Turbinado sugar.  Feel is so hop fronted that the malt balance needs a minute to catch up. Overall, this is a huge balance of bubble gum and roasted malt.  Last swigs: Much more flavorful than last year. Ya know what's funny? This is the best Stone RIS year yet.  Beer is good.

T: Again, not as sweet. I think the 06 is more suited to sipping like the aged beer it is. I like this better for normal drinking. The same amazing complexity, but a bit more subtle, with slightly better flavor.  M: Not quite as thick as the 06, but better slightly carbonation.  D: Just as drinkable as the 06, maybe slightly better because there is less sweetness.  Overall, I think I enjoyed the 07 slightly more. Both are great, but the 06 is more suited to sipping.

Shared with a friend, and decanted into a couple of Stone Imperial Russian Stout tulip crystal glasses as shown in the picture to the right of the description.  WOW ... how to begin. This is as close as I've come to ever giving a 5 to any beer, and the only reason I didn't is because with the high ABV, you might be well advised to drink this with respect and responsibility.  The pour easily produced two full Stone IRS tulip glasses with massive heads. Color is .. well ... opaque. Like looking into the depths of the dark eyes of a beautiful mediterranean woman. I'm in love!  The nose .. how shall I compare thee? So full .. so complex .. so indescribable. A malty mixture of licorice, chocolate, dark fruits with a hint of the alcoholic strength in the background, which isn't distracting .. it really adds to the experience. My nose was so overwhelmed with the maltiness that I couldn't pick up on any hops.  The taste follows the nose, only to a higher plane of existence. The mouthfeel could not be more full. The sweet maltiness cannot be improved upon. It is NOT cloying, just so richly satisfying, like allowing a piece of the finest 70% chocolate to slowly dissolve on your tongue. The taste is so complex and full of subtle nuances that words alone cannot convey its remarkable flavor. Definitely a 5 in my book. The finish goes on and on and on, and on .. like the Energizer Bunny. The considerable ABV warms you and puts your entire body at ease.  Easily the best Imperial Russian Stout I've ever had. My favorite used to be Victory's Storm King, but even the ""King"" will have to bow to this formidable offering from Stone.  Very highly recommended. If you like Imperial Stouts, you simply cannot afford to miss this one.  Cheers",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,96
147,1160,BlindPig,4.83,"2007 vintage: A- About a 1 1/2"" mocha head on a pure black body. S- Coffee, chocolate, and roasted malts all blended together with a big dose of grass hops in there also. Chocolate comes through clean and the roasted and coffee and mixed together in the back ground. T- Big robust chocolate flavor in intial taste and in aftertaste. The hops balance this out very well and leave a nice big bitterness on the tongue (mixed in with the chocolate). Alcohol comes through and tingles the tongue and the warms the back of your throat very nicely. Light roasted malt and coffee flavors in the background of the up front chocolate. Very nice! M- Maybe a tad to high on the carbonation (would like a smoother palate on it). Big full body though with low to medium carbonation. D- This is a great beer. I wish I would of liked stouts this much when they came out last year. This will be up there for one of my favorite stouts (along with Siberian Night, Storm King, Dark Lord, and Bourbon County Stout).",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,96
147,1160,greenbeaner,4.11,"Leave it to Stone to brew an RIS with some balls and then some!  Rich and dark dark brown, this one pours a thick two-finger head, dark tan and speckled with dark bubbles....Notice how I keep using the word dark...it's because it is. Very good looking beer.  Smells of vanilla, sweet chocolate maltiness and hops...Scent is about the only thing subtle about this beer.  Tastes of vanilla, with a strong chocolate flavor up front, malt, spice, slightest hint of cinnamon maybe? Finishes with a strong hoppy bitterness and a strong burn of alcohol...yessss....  Fells great in the mouth, thick, creamy, sticky and lingering. A very chewy beer. Basically this one is dinner in a bottle, although while drinking it I've found it to go fantastic with some smoked honey ham. Well balanced all throughout.  This is a very tasty beer indeed. An exceptional RIS with the boldness one can expect from Stone. Drinkability is only limited by it's strength, which personally I chose to fully embrace!",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,96
147,1160,jamie2dope,3.55,"I was really excited to see this one at the store lately, as I havent had a fresh sample of this beer in a while. This is the 07 release. I love the 05 and 06 bottles, which I have quite a few of. This one pours a dark brown/not quite jet black coloration with a brown tan head. In the nose was faint alcohol, powdered cocoa and a definite burnt character. Taste started off with burnt coffee, but as it warmed up a bit more of chocolate showed up. Mouthfeel was heavy, but not too big on the alcohol despite the presence of it in the aroma. One bomber of this was more then enough for me. I have to say that im a bit disappointed by this release, as it is not as good IMO as the 05 or 06. Maybe a little ageing will complement this beer. Either way it is better then 90% of the stouts out there. Check it out regardless. Cheers",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,96
147,1160,JimsArcade,4.27,"Spring 07 Release...  A: Black as dark-roast coffee. A hard pour into a snifter produced only a minimal brown-colored head.  S: The aroma of dark-chocolate-covered cherry cordials dominates the nose. No evidience of hops in the aroma: just malts and alcohol.  T: Bitter chocolate, espresso, molasses and alcohol. The flavors are almost overwhelming. It almost feels as if my other senses become muted as my brain tries to deal with the intense flavors.  M: It's thick... almost syrupy. Carbonation is minimal (as suggested by the minimal head after a hard pour).  D: A treat to drink, but having more than one would be difficult. (Not the least of which would be the ability to function after drinking more than one bottle of this 10.8% brew.) The beer is so thick that a lighter-bodied beer (i.e., about 99% of the world's beers) needs to follow to give the palate a rest.  Stone's RIS is one of my new favorites in the category.

Will mellow nicely, right now, it's a hot rod. Very good beer, if you can get it, buy it and drink it.  2008 bottle: Its been a year since drinking the last one so hear goes.  Pours a beautiful syrupy opaque black, with a big brown head  Smells of roasted coffee, deep malts, toffee? Smells fantastic, some peppery smell which I think is the hops.  Tastes fantastic! This one will age well. Sweet dark sugars, alcohol.  Lingering sweet aftertaste that coats your mouth and gives you a lugie.

The head falls very fast and leaves a slight lacing. The smell is boozy and harsh with some off flavors, I have had these off flavors before I just can't put my finger on it. The taste is slightly roasty, alcohol presence is noticable. Their are off flavors again. Mouthfeel isn't very good, it leaves my mouth dry and want of more, not more of the beer, but something.

Strong aromas of chocolate and esspresso, very malty. The taste is glorious, roasted malts and esspresso with hints of chocolate. Very smooth to the palate, suprisingly smooth for the alcohol level. Definately a highly drinkable beer. I am very impressed. Great work Stone Brewing Co.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,96
147,1160,IntriqKen,4.18,"Spring 2007 release. I love waiting a year to review this....it is always a wonderous surprise and like tasting it for the first time, each time. Again, pours very black...Head is more massive than in the past...thick, craggy, two finger tan head that melts to something very sticky. Aroma is slightly disappointing...some chocolate, some coffee, a little stale cardboard. &lt;sigh&gt; No...wait...that isn't cardboard...no...that isn't anything offensive...it's something very interesting and allusive....it's the burnt malts with coffee and chocolate blending with citrus hops at the end and a touch of smoke. This is nice. Taste is yummy dark espresso coffee with a bit of chocolate that turns to more chocolate than espresso...again, some smokiness and a touch of drying citrus hops on the end. Nice warming alcohol while the taste leaves your mouth and you are left 'breathing' chocolates and alcohol. I seem to love this every year. I bought a case so I will re-evaluate this many times and may change some of what I have here for first impressions.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,96
147,1160,jaxon53,4.62,"Spring 2007 release. Served at cellar temperature in a snifter from a twenty-two ounce bottle. Poured a very intense , shiny jet black color. Some brown highlights when held up to the light. Two fingers of very thick, creamy, mocha brown head formed. Retention was very good lasting almost to the end with plenty of thick lace. Smelled strongly of roasted/toasted malt, sweet dark chocolate, with strong bitter aromas of coffee with just a small alcohol presence. Tasted of chocolate and fresh coffee up front, with a little caramel, more chocolate , and a short bitter hop bite in the middle. Finished with coffee and warming alcohol. Overall pretty smooth and the flavors compliment eachother well. Mouthfeel was full bodied, thick, almost chewy and a little heavy. Just how I like my RIS.Very drinkable , but at almost 11% abv. this one might bite back. Also a little young in my opinion. I'll definitely lay a few down.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,96
147,1160,prototypic,4.52,"2007 Release  Appearance: Pours a nearly jet black color with a very thick and creamy two finger head. Great retention and lacing. Very good looking beer.  Smell: Wow. Where do I begin? Very complex blend of espresso, dark chocolate, and toasted nuts. Stick with it a little longer and there's scents of dark fruits and caramel. Nice malt presence. Alcohol is actually coming through a bit as well.  Taste: The chocolate and espresso seem to come through very strong initially. Definitely has a smoky, toasted nut flavor. Dark fruit flavors emerge after the initial blast of chocolate and coffee. Alcohol is blended pretty well, but one can still pick up a bit of the taste.  Mouthfeel/Drinkability: It's pretty thick and creamy, but very smooth. At nearly 11%, drinkability is somewhat limited. One bomber is enough for me in a sitting. But, don't get me wrong, it's very easy to drink. Overall, this is a fantastic imperial stout. Easily one of the best I've tried. Classic Stone brew. In my opinion, it has every ounce of arrogant character one would expect from Stone. Highly recommended.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,96
147,1160,MaltyGoodness,4.85,"22oz. bottle - 2005 release  Pours a viscous black liquid with a small mocha head that disappears. Sparse speckled lacing on the glass.  Rich blended aroma of roasted malts, espresso, dark cocoa. It's hard to differentiate the aromas, they are very equally distributed.  Rich, sweet roasted malt flavor that absolutely melts into equal parts espresso and German dark chocolate. Very slight bitterness as it finishes sweet with a perfect blend of flavors.  Rich, creamy body. Mild carbonation.  I seldom find that the hype matches the beer, but this beer truly deserves all the accolades it receives. It is a real pleasure to drink such an expertly crafted brew. From reading reviews of fresh bottles, I would assume that letting this sit for 2 years has been key in allowing this to properly mature. Patience is indeed a virtue.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,96
147,1160,dbalsock,4.71,"2006 (about a year old) Appearance: Poured dark black... like there's any other kind of black... could use more head and lacing.  Smell: Fruity aroma comes through with the coffee and hint of chocolate. Strawberries are on the forefront of the nose and make this incredibly enticing.  Taste: Again the strawberries with coffee and chocolate. It's sweeter than I remember, and the hops are almost gone now. The coffee comes in on the aftertaste to round out the taste, with the fruit esters in front and the chocolate (milkish chocolate) in the middle.  Mouthfeel: Smoothed over since it was out last year. The alcohol is less noticeable, almost non-existent for me, and the hop bitterness was gone. It was smooth and thick on the way down. Quite an experience.  Drinkability: Very easy to drink. I would want to session this, but that's a little dangerous.

Pours oil-slick black with a small but persistent tan head and slight lacing, which is a surprise, given the style.  The nose is loads of coffee mixed with malt, charred in the flaming pits of Hell. Some vanilla-ish aroma. Maybe this beer really IS as evil as Stone makes it out to be. I'm excited.  Tastes like it smells, coffee flavor, dark-roasted malts, and black malt bitterness on the finish. Some woody and vanilla flavors appear mid-palate. This is an incredible, incredible Imperial Stout.  The mouthfeel is chewy and substantial, balanced by carbonation, more than I was expecting.

Into a tulip glass, pours a pitch dark, thick black with a half inch of tan head, receding to a thin foam, pretty good lacing that sticks in bubbles, but not much. The aroma was depressingly weak, kind of chalky, charred malts distracting from what should and is a lovely roasted malt and coffee grounds.  The taste is better, but still thought it lacking. Where is that arrogance? that might? the alcohol and bitterness? I just don't find it here in the quantity I should, and can't understand why it could be. Its very mellowed out. Its still good, lots of roasted malts with faint chocolate tones, coffee ground into it, the hops a bit fleeting. The mouth is pretty good, not all that full, or warming, what you'd hope a RIS to be.  Basically, something happened to this bottle. It had to have, because I can't believe I'm going to score this beer so low, and give it such a sad review.

147,1160,Imstillthegman,4.03,"Summer 2005 release. I got this bottle from Zorro about a year ago.  Poured a viscous, opaque black. Thin golden brown head quickly faded to just a ring with a strange ghostly looking film floating in the middle of the glass.  The aroma is improving as it warms up. I smell some dark roasted malts, soy sauce, anise, sweet dark chocolate, faint coffee and some burning alcohol in the background.  The flavor surprises me a bit after smelling it. I get more coffee and chocolate than what I smelled. There is still a noticeable alcohol presence, but it complements the other flavors. The soy sauce shows up at the finish with a sweet and sour type of kick. Age has done this one quite well.  Thick and chewy. Very little carbonation. Some alcohol burn in the aftertaste. I like this one, but I am not sure if I can get through the whole bomber on my own.

Mouthfeel is thick, oily and indulgent. Carbonation is sublime, but there. Age has really tamed the hops and the alcohol in this. It would be insanely drinkable were it not for the sheer malty sweetness of the beer. Very nice, but a bit much to finish a bomber.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,96
147,1160,MICAMD,5,"Stone IRS is absolutely stunning- worthy of the hype and my first 5.0. I cannot think of anything to make this beer better than it is.  Spring 2006 bottling.  A- Poured a black as night, thick black liquid. When held to a light, I could see no light peeking through on the edges. The head that formed was a beautiful brown head that slowly settled to a nice marbling on the surface of the liquid. Even at the very end, there was still some remnants to the head. Gorgeous.  S- Wow. I could smell this as soon as I cracked open the top. Sweet, roasted malts, chocolate, black licorice, and some cinnamon are present. Could not find any hint of alcohol in the nose.  T- Perfect balance of sweet and roastiness. Brown sugar, vanilla, oak, smokiness, chocolate, black licorice, raisin, cinnamon. There is a lot going on here. Amazing. Everything blends so well together. This is a great beer to let wander your palate. Again, no alcohol presence.  M- The carbonation level in this is perfect. Not too much to make it feel light, but just enough to enhance the flavor. Very very smooth.  D- For such a big beer in a bomber, I found myself wanting more as I polished off the bottle. This is a remarkable beer that I was very skeptical of before I cracked it open- but damn... this is liquid gold.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,96

147,1160,mmcave,4.5,"Received in trade with cooperrip thanks again. Bottle states limited spring 2006 release Served a bit below room right into a nonic. Tan head rose and fell and lingers on the surface. The body is black oily and completely opaque. Smells is robust, salty, smoky, earthy, maybe some brown sugar, dirty coffee hints of caramel and that slight anise character typical in some RIS, but subtle and perfectly executed. Taste is big, chewy, meaty, yet immediately approachable. I get an excellent roasted flavor, colored by a nutty character that makes it sort of pop in my mouth. Bitterness is perfectly balanced definitely not as aggressive as some, but provides tasteful ballast. Mouthfeel is wonderful, well balanced, surly and big, yet so tasty and easy to drink. This great offering starts aromatic and tasty and ends in very welcome alcohol warmth. I am very pleased to have had this wanderful brew. Great companion on a cold night, a simply great brew from a great brewery. God I wish I could get a case and do as they suggest",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,96

First smell was almost like prunes and roasted coffee. Might not sound too appealing, but it really is once the other smells come out as it warms. Weak molasses smell and a big chocolate smell came out later along with a mellow anise/licorice smell. Tastes upfront of sweet chocolate with roast coffee beans and roasted but not burnt malt flavors. Almost perfect carbonation in mouthfeel, very smooth but faintly bubbly on tongue and creamy if left to hang around. Drinkability is excellent as the alcohol is well-hidden. The entire experience of this beer just gets so much better with every sip. Can't wait for the next batch to hit!

147,1160,mikesgroove,4.59,"Much thanks to unclejedi for the bottle!  Poured a deep black, opaque, no light through this baby! Creamy head gave way to some crazy brown lace, couldn''t hardly see through the glass! Nuts looking dripping down the glass. Black as night this was. The smell, holy crap, CHOCOLATE. I thought I was sniffing hershey, the chocolate smell was so overpowering, my wife could smell it next to me. As it warmed, hints of coffee and alcohol tingled the nose. Taste started out with coffee, sugary caramel sweetness, hints of chocolate, not as pronounced as the smell. There is a definate alcohol warming on this one, definate, but is is very good. Fel is very thick, almost shake like, very good RIS, very nice and another hit from stone, I thoroughly enjoyed this and can only hope to have another one day!  2008 Update  Finally got a hold of this years IRS from Stone. Needless to say, I was happy to see this one show up on my doorstep, as you could always rest assured you were going to have a top quality brew on your hands with this one. The pour was just as to be expected. A deep dark black liquid, that was completely opaque. A big three finger high head of tan colored lace was stretched over the top and took a good long while to finally settle down. Once it did, there was still a good-sized head on top that stayed around an inch high for the rest of the session. Very nice side glass presentation left lots of brown foam all over the glass. Your classic big stout.  The aroma was full and rich, and very sweet. Lots of lactose and cocoa hints were rippling throughout. The aroma of fresh roasted coffee provided some bitterness and a touch of depth to it, as did the hint of alcohol that was all over the back of this one. The flavor followed it along perfectly. Very big and rich, with a deep layer of chocolate and coffee that provided the bulk of the flavor here. The alcohol was a bit hot at first, but given time to warm up to room temperature, it turned into a wonderfully big and mellow stout. The finish had a nice touch of bitterness to it, and the slightest bit of hops dried you out and left you with a long drawn out flavor of sugar-filled coffee. Great feel on this one, with a full body that left the nice little bit of a creamy feel to it. The alcohol was hard to escape at almost 11%, but was surprisingly more mellow then you would have thought, leading this one to be a superb sipper, and perfectly tailored for the late night tasting.  Overall, I thought this was very good, and definitely up there with some of the best in the style. A big, strong, full stout that you must respect when drinking. Do not take this one lightly, just because it is a little bit more available then some of the others, is no reason to pass it by.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,96

It starts off sweet and then finishes with a nice hop bitterness which lingers around a while. The alcohol is well hidden, but you can taste it here and there. Mouthfeel is medium/full, it's smooth, creamy and slick. Drinkability is very good, it goes down easy and almost as soon as I was done with one sip, I was ready to pick up the glass for another.

Tastes of dark malt, chocolate, and prune, with a warm alcohol and bitter hop finish. Warm. This just warms you all the way down and makes you glad to be alive and drinking a beer.

Smells of bittersweet chocolate, alcohol and a good dosing of hops.  Taste is rich, chocolatey with big notes of alcohol and a hoppy bitter finish.  Mouthfeel is kinda slick, medium bodied and very warming. The slickness is kind of off-putting and the body seems to be a tad light.  Drinkability is pretty good but this is not my favorite RIS.

147,1160,jeffjfindley,4.78,"I had two of these in the past couple of weeks, one was an 05, the other an 06.  A syrupy pour yields a stormy black beauty with a walnut colored head with a touch of red in it. The smell is toasty and malty, and doesn't for a moment try to disguise the alcohol contained within. In the 06, in addition to noticing more hop character due to the aging of the 05, I also noticed a character similar to that of a Belgian Strong Dark. I'm guessing that they used a Belgian yeast in the 06, but I'll have to try the 05 again to see if it's there too. Anyway, the smell and flavor are both outstanding.  As with every other drop of beer from Stone, the mouth is delighted by the feel of this gorgeous, gorgeous beer. If this is a session brew, it's gonna be a very short session.

Smells wonderful, alcohol, dark berries, toffee, and sweet leather. Tastes just as complex. Definite currant and some other fruitiness as well as chocolate and toffee. The alcohol is more hidden than I thought. I've had a few double stouts but no imperial stouts, so I guess that is what I was expecting. But, this brew slapped me in the face and showed me what imperial stout means. Very complex and very, very good.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,96
147,1160,jj21,4.25,"2005 release (Thanks to biglove) Pours black as night into a stemmed tulip creating a dark brown dense head that disappears all too soon leaving some lacing, but for the most part it was pretty lifeless. Somewhat disappointing as I had been waiting a year before opening this one. Aromas of chocolate and roasting coffee mask the alcohol well. Taste was excellent. The hops were muted and the malts shone through. Big and thick mouthfeel coats the mouth and throat while alcohol persists. Some dark fruits and sweetness but not what I expected. This was a lot easier to drink than I thought it would be. I expected a bomb of a stout (see DFH WWS) but it wasn't. Don't get me wrong- it was still a great Stout. I look forward to cracking open the 2006 tonight to see what it's like fresh.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,96

147,1160,MVassar,4.11,"Resembles a cup of black coffee. Very dark brown. Short-lived mocha head, with no lacing.  Roasted coffee, roasted nuts, dark fruit, and raw sugar in the nose. Very enticing.  Sweet malt, syrupy, rich fruit. Raisins, molasses, chocolate.  Creamy, thick mouthfeel, with a long finish. Low-key carbonation.  Delicious for dessert, but not one I would consume in great quantities.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,96
147,1160,terrabyte,4.57,"Pours a deep black with a small brown foam that disappears quickly.  Aroma is very strong and easy to pick up. Unsweetened roasted chocolates, a hint of bourbon, and burned coffee.  Flavor is quite intense. Dark chocolate flavors make the base, yet added hardly any sweetness. Some alcohol could be tasted in the form of dark fruits like raisons and dates. The flavor that Ill forever remember, though, is a smoky & woody ashtray taste. Unique and mostly enjoyable.  Mouthful is very thick and heavy. In fact, one of the heaviest I can remember in recent history. Carbonation was low, but hardly a factor with the thickness.  Drinkability is a sipper. I didn't find the alcohol to be very apparent, actually. It was the thickness and the dark flavor that slowed this down. This bottle probably lasted over an hour with me at a party.  This is a 2006 bomber I saved until New Year's Eve. A fitting event for such a bottle. I offered some to everyone there, but they were intent on mixed drinks and MGD. Although I thought the ABV of this beer was masked by its strong flavors, it should be noted that I had put away a growler of Grumpy Troll Russian Imperial Stout and a 6-pack of New Glarus Spotted Cow earlier that day. My tongue may have been impaired.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,96
147,1160,Tyrawlings,4.5,2006 offering poured from a 22 oz. bomber into a snifter glass.  A: Dark as night black with absolutely no light visible from any angle of the snifter. The cinnamon brown head poured one finger thick and dissolved in seconds to a slight ring of tiny bubbles around the glass. No lacing what so ever.  S: Roasted coffee. Dark chocolate. Dark fruits. Oak or wood with a slight smoke spirit. Alcohol.  T: A dark bitter chocolate with roasted coffee are noticable right off the bat with a sweet or sugary molasses touch. A slight citric hop bite is followed by the taste of dark fruit or currants. The alcohol kicks in with a taste of oak aged bourbon. This beer finishes with an earthy and smoked aftertaste.  M: Syrupy and luxuriously thick. Slight if any carbination. A dry aftertaste comes from the alcohol.  D: I had this beer with a fine dinner on New Year's Eve. A perfect combination with the surf and turf I enjoyed. This beer is not for the faint of heart. This is a sipper that is to be savored over time. The favors really come out as the beer warms. Leaves you with a calm warming feeling all over. All said.... This was a treat! A great representation of the style. A fantastic beer from start to finish!

147,1160,jasonjlewis,4.29,"This beer had a decent head that faded a bit too quickly for my taste. The smell was strong of chocolate malts, the alcohol was not too overbearing. Apple phenol, my favorite smell, was present. Taste was incredibly balanced and malty. I can't believe this is 10.8% alcohol. The malting of this beer is superb and thick. I was afraid the alcohol would be overbearing. Not too bitter either, I've heard the ibus on this beer weere very high, but the balance doesn't make it very noticeable. This beer was pretty easy to drink. A very nice RIS.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,96

Nose: Roasted chocolate malts, licorise, dark fruit and alcohol.  Deep thick chocolate blast with some intense alcohol. Definately a sipper. Smokey wood bourbon finish that warms the throat considerabley.  Mouth is thick and chewy with a low carbonation and a slick feel.  I don't think i would drink more than one of these in a sitting, but definately a good choice for a scarey movie on a snowey night.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,96
147,1160,jlh8643,4.47,"A 2005 bomber version. Pulled it out of the fridge and let sit for about 30 mins. Very dark with ruby highlights around the edges when held up to the lights. A mediocre tan head that fell away all too soon leaving some whisps of foam arounds the edges. Roasted and dark malts dominate the nose. The hop aroma was subdued after about 18 months in the bottle but I knew some was there. Dark fruits, caramel and roasted, coffee notes deliver a long full finish.  If it wasn't for the disappointing initial appearance I would have rated this a bit higher. Overall I very much enjoyed this brew.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,96
147,1160,Frozensoul327,3.55,"A: Dark black opaque color with a short lived head of foam that took off in no time. No lacing, and what appears to be a low level of carbonation. Woul'd've been nicer if it had more of a head.  S: Rich, roasted chocolate malts, notes of unsweetend cocoa and raw molasses. Notes of bourbon and chocolate liquor hide in the background. Java notes swirl in and out of perception's view.  T: Dense dark chocolate flavors come out swinging. A hearty dose of warming alcohol kicks in shortly after, followed by a wallop of bourbon laced nuances: coffee, smoke, wood, grain. Nice.  M: Dense, heavy, thick. A measureable amount of carbonation is noted, but is overpowered by the magnitude of the liquid it's contained in.  D: Fair. It's not bad. Very much a sipper. Seems to be more akin to a imperial java stout, or something along those lines. Well made, just not my bag.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,96
147,1160,NJpadreFan,3.68,"Stone- Imperial Russian Stout  Appearance- Dark black with a thick tan head. Heavy lacing throughout the beer. Smell- Strong alcohol, burnt coffee beans, cherries, and raisins. Taste- Very sweet, sugary sweet smokey malt mixed with a roasted coffee bean and fruit flavor. Dried fruits of raisin and cherries come through. Mothfeel- Sweet!! Syrupy sugary sweet with huge doses of alcohol.  Overall- Not a bad sipper, but you better like it over the top sugary sweet!!!",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,96
147,1160,tkarsies,4.87,"Served at cellar temp in a pint glass. 2006 version. Has been in my cellar for 7 months. Appearance is coal black. No light shows through even when held up to the light. Brown head briefly appears but quickly dissipates. Smell is sweet with strong roasted smell and some fruits. Taste is of roasted malt. Again, some fruit is noticeable in the background. Bitterness mostly from the roasting and only slight hop presence. Some alcohol is tasted as well. Mouthfeel is smooth, very smooth. Carbonation is light. Wow! This is one great beer. It is much smoother than many other impy stouts thatI have had in the past. Alcohol is not as obvious as I would expect for a beer of this strength. I am eager to try my other cellared bottle in a year or so. Definitely a nice Christmas Eve treat.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,96

Taste: Light roastiness upfront, gentle hop bitterness quickly fades into thick, sweet, black currant, molasses, some coffee, very complex, and moderate alcohol warmth at the end (especially for the abv).  Mouthfeel: Very thick and heavy, not particularly creamy. Pleasant and appropriate for the flavor.

This has to be one of the hoppier stouts ive had in a while, latly ive been drinking goose island Bourbon county and founders breakfast, and man on man was this a nice change of pace. I love the copper head and the darkness of a great stout, smell was awesome, reminded me of dark lord, rolling over the the maltyness and hops really came out. overall i would have to say that i have to get over to FFF and check this out on tap.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,96
147,1160,scruffwhor,4.3,"Poured into a Bellevue snifter from a 22oz bottle.  Appearance- Jet black, used motor oil. Nice and viscous. Deep brown head of about an eighth of a finger. Looks like a black cognac in my snifter.  Smell- Lots of cream, coffee, wood, and toffee with a veil of black draped over it all.  Taste- Starts very dark and sweet from the vanilla and cream roasted malts. The middle is a little more woody, but still dark. The finish lets the hops get some say so by imparting an almost viney smokiness to the finish.  Mouthfeel- Not as viscous as Dark Lord. But still viscous. Just what I'm looking for in a good RIS.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,96
147,1160,alysmith4,4,"My first try of anything Stone.. and my first Russian stout at that! Very deep in flavor, complex with roasted coffee and toasted fruit flavors. Detected a touch of coffee and cherry flavors, and some herbal, medicinal flavors.  Not my favorite style, but a well-crafted flavor with carefully brewed complexities. Definitely worth a try, even if you don't like this style.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,96
147,1160,HoustonTX,4.87,"2006 Edition. Poured into a Duvel tulip.  The darkest beer I have seen in a long time. Non-opaque and jet-black. The head was lacking, and only produced a ring of lace at the end of the pour. This lace will last until the end of the drink, I guarantee it.  I set the beer down on the counter... and waited. Waiting for what you might ask? I was waiting for my nose to calm down, as the fragrance was being permeated throughout the room. I could smell the beer almost a foot away. Insane. The smell is excellent overall. Strong current of chocolate/coffee malt, along with fruity esters. Caramel and chocolate take center stage. With undertones of ripe cherries, and graham cracker. It's quite hard to take this beer away from my nose. It's smell is just incredibly pleasant and true to the RIS style.  Mmm, the first sip was delicious. Lots of complexity going on initially, and even more after each sip as the beer warms. A strong blast of malt on the get go. Chocolate with perfect balance. Right in the median between bitter and sweet. After the initial blast of malt, comes a hoppy note which produces exceptional balance. Citric in nature, and goes well with the overall flavor scheme. After the hops fade, comes a long lingering dark coffee flavor which resembles espresso almost exactly. Pushing up against it is a large roasted grain note, which lasts long after the sip is gone. Talk about beer for breakfast? This one could pull it off, with ease. The mouthfeel is creamy, a bit oily, and right on for the style. Drinkability is great for a beer of this size.  I am having trouble expressing words right now, much less conveying them to type. It's almost unbelievable how good this beer really is. After the large amount of hype and good word I have heard about this beer, it did have a lot to live up to. I'd proudly like to say, that this beer is definitely world-class, and that it does indeed live up to the hype - and past it...  Hands down, one of finest Stouts on the face of the earth.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,96
147,1160,lpayette,4.6,"Details- Thanks to dbalsock for the sample straight from San Diego. 22 oz. bottle - Spring 2006 release, and enjoyed on Dec. 2nd 2006.  Appearance- Pours very dark and very thick. Didn't observe much lacing. I would like to see the head be a bit bigger too.  Smell- Darkly roasted malt, hints of black currants, a definite coffee bean aroma, very dark chocolate (of the milk variety).  Taste- Very dark chocolate that is truffle-like. Gets creamy as it warms. Coffee. Alcohol, but it has either become or always was surprsingly mellow. Delicous, and especially delicious as it warms to room temperature.  Moughtfeel- So thick and creamy as it warms. Doesn't get any better than this.  Drinkability- I sipped on this for about an hour- but when it approached room temperature I found myself wanting more and more, and it was surprisingly drinkable. I bet this would be even better with another year or so of aging. A great beer that I look forward to trying again.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,96

It's a nice balance. A very thick brew -- practically a milkshake -- with no carbonation. A nice sipping beer on a cold day with a piece of dark chocolate.  I thought it was a great beer but I expected more of a wow effect from the taste given its acclaim. It is an excellent interpretation of a russian imperial stout but I found myself prefering old rasputin.

147,1160,mmmbeer,4.84,"22 oz. bomber, released in early summer '05 - served lightly chilled in a big chalice. It pours thick and black, with a small, lightly fizzy orange/brown head that reduces to a collar, then fades away. It is quite aromatic, with dark and sweet chocolate, coffee, charred/burnt, nutty, smoked?, roasted, and sweet malts, tobacco juice, currant, blackberry, apple?, oranges?, other berry/tropical esters, and a bit of a lactic quality. Insanely complex. Just as complex on the palate, with cocoa, tobacco, leather, coffee, Jagermeister?, blackened/charred/burnt malts, roasted and vinous malts, plum, currant, blackberry, and green/piney hops that leave a medium bitterness. The body is thick, fairly carbonated (thanks to bottle-conditioning), and incredibly smooth - swishing the beer in your mouth turns it into an almost milkshake consistency that you damn near have to chew. It leaves a long, roasted and hoppy finish and hides the alcohol surprisingly well (in flavor; you can feel it going down). Overall a dangerously drinkable beer from one of my favorite breweries.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,96
147,1160,SacoDeToro,4.35,"Poured blacker and thicker than Saudi Arabian crude with a small brown head.  The aroma was of rich roasted malts, chocolate, some hops, and herbal notes.  The flavor of the beer was richly roasty without being harsh or ashen. The malts cascaded through a variety of flavors. There were notes of dried fruits, herbs, and licorice. The hops were well balanced and didn't follow the normal Stone edict of coarse bittering.  The mouthfeel was full and creamy. The carbonation was spot on. Very drinkable for such a big beer.  I'm not normally super impressed by Stone's beers, but this one was exceptional. It's deservedly at the top with the likes of 3F Dark Lord, Bell's Expedition Stout, and Alesmith Speedway Stout.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,96
147,1160,Metalmonk,4.72,"Couldn't hold out another day. This is the Spring '06 batch. Call me weak for opening it in Fall '06. But I...LOVE...STONE... (thanks to my Portland peep, msubulldog25, for the bottle!)  Pours out a jet-black ink. The oil was utterly opaque, with a moderate light brown head. Small patches of lace form, but nothing too outrageous.  The aroma is mighty. Booze, tangy cherry, coffee beans, juicy black currants, melted chocolate.  Flavor has as much depth, balance and variety as the aromas, and mirrors those listed above. There's also a generous hops element, but they are well-incorporated. Smokiness/roastiness comes out stronger in the flavor than in the aroma, and along with the fruitiness, the chocolate/lactic sweetness, and the coffee-like heartiness...is there really a better stout out there, Russial Imperial or otherwise? There's a ton of action here, lots of things going on, but everything remains focused, and every sip is a joy. This is effing brilliant.  Mouthfeel lacks the viscosity you get in many other Russian Imperials, being remarkably buoyant and airy despite its strong looks, aromas and flavors. It doesn't lack thickness, but also doesn't feel heavy or sticky.  Is there anything Stone can't do? This is incredible.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,96
147,1160,nriech,4.53,"""Limited Spring 2006 Release.""  Appearance: Jet black with a thin head and steady lacing.  Smell: Dark fruits, chocolate, sweet currant and espresso.  Taste: Really very remarkable. Chocolate and sweet bread lead the charge, followed closely by currant and espresso. Dark fruits, such as plums and a bit of cherries fill out the middle and a touch of a spicy alcohol presence round out the end.  Drinkability: Mouthfeel is velvet smooth, and drinkability are excellent for the style.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,96
147,1160,SilentSabre,4.45,"Bottle says, ""Limited Spring 2006 Release."" This was everything I was hoping it would be and more. I wanted so badly to like this, and I hoped, terribly so, that it wouldn't have the West Coast style ""citrus and pine"" hops in it like Rasputin or Czar or so many others. This...this is a masterpiece in brewing. It poured black. Absolutely black. In fact, when held up to a light bulb, no light passed through it, even the edges. Head was like the foam on a glass of Coca-Cola, and dwindled down to a ring of frost around the edges in about 30 seconds. Smell reminds me of raisin bran cereal. Very malty and deep with a raisin / stewed fruit smell. Alcohol is present as well. Magnificent. Taste isn't as rich as I was thinking (or hoping) it would be. All the attributes in the smell are present in the taste. There is an extraordinarily profound presence of heavy malt immediately noticeable that stays with you the whole time. There is also a very brief manifestation of alcohol as soon as you swallow, but it vanishes as quickly as it arrived. In fact, to be nearly 11%abv, the alcohol in this is concealed exceptionally well. Mouthfeel is without equal. Well, there maybe another stout out there that *can* equal this, but certainly not exceed it. This is just a glorious creation, coating your mouth with its decadent and nearly oily presence with each sip. Very, very heavy. Beautiful. Rasputin has a mouthfeel similar to this, but it also has a hop presence that I am not particular fond of. This drink, is a sensational marriage of nearly everything I like in a stout. Many, many thanks to Ding for bringing me this most splendid brew!!",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,96
147,1160,RonfromJersey,4.6,"A black hole gives way to a laser of red along the bottom of the glass. Massive, dense dark tan / light brown somehow suggests chocolate. Head is snap, krackle, popping.  Big aroma of roasted coffee and deep chocolate, with hints of dark fruits, licorice, and alcohol.  Taste follows smell - big coffee, big chocolate (a nifty blend of milk and dark), some alcohol soaked dark fruit, and a bit of licorice to stir. Nice bite of hops as the finish approaches. Mild alcohol in the afterstages warms but does not burn.  Mouthfeel is thick, chewy, semi-slick, not overly oily.  Drinkability for a beer this big is not only dangerous but downright frightening.  Decadent and delightful, seek this out.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,96
147,1160,blackie,4.5,"Early Summer 2005 Release  appearance: The pour gives a deep mocha head that recedes to a ring around the glass. One of the darkest beers I've seen.  smell: Smells f'in delicious. Perfect blend of aromas, but I need a little more strength for a 5.0. Creamy cocoa, tempered coffee and roasted malts, soy sauce jerky, and whole, dark sugars. Nice, moderate American hop aroma and the perfect ethanol presence.  mouthfeel: The carbonation is medium, and the body full and slick without being overbearing.  taste: Sweet, flavorful roasted malts bring notes of cocoa and soy sauce. The American hop flavor is hard to dig out of all the roasted malt. After the swallow, a moderate bitterness dries it up a little with some dry, dark roasts becoming more prominent. Very smooth, with well blended flavors overall.  drinkability: A great RIS, and the ABV is very well disguised  Bottle received from dirtylou late last summer and cellared since  02/03/08: Early Spring 2007 Release received as an extra from dirtylou, cellared about a year. Thick with smooth dark cocoa and deep, rich roasts with a great smoky character. A light note of sour that's pretty interesting, and probably draws the old ale comparisons I've seen in other reviews. Ethanol present, but at welcome and appropriate levels. Thick and delicious.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,96
147,1160,Bitterbill,4.25,"Poured from 22oz bottle(room temp-2006 bottling) a pitch black with a smallish head of dark brown foam that quickly shrunk to just a fine ring around the glass and soon after that, it was gone as well.  The smell is strong on the caramel malt with notes of chocolate and coffee.  The taste is really big on sweet and roasted malt up front with strong flavours of chocolate and coffee that add some nice complexity. The finish brings some nice hop bitterness and there's a touch of alcohol there as well but it's not overpowering as long as you just sip on it and...that's what this brew is all about. A very good sipping RIS that more than satisfies after a 22oz serving.  Body wise, this is a very ""chewy"" Stout and makes for a really great mouthfeel. Yum, Yum, Yummy.  Bottom line: This is a top notch sample of the style and everyone should get a chance to try it. I highly recommend it!  PS: I've got one more bottle of this and a bottle of the 2005. :^)  Update: Drinking my second bottle of the 2006, I poured it into my NB goblet and there was lots of nice foam and lacing and it lasted for the entire session.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,96
147,1160,beerphilosopher,4.3,"Thank you to WarriorSoul for this lovely brew ... a 2006 bottle i didn't have the patience to cellar. Pours an opaque black so intense it's as if it sucks up any and all light within a 5 ft radius. Gorgeous. Epic head of chocolate tan that persists long. complex lacing patterns in the goblet in which it sits. Nose is good, but not great ... something some time in the cellar would remedy, I'd wager. Dark, roasted grains, espresso, baker's chocolate, and a slight sweetness. Nothing wrong with it, just didn't knock me over. Palate is consistent with the nose, except the tastes are so intense they nearly overwhelm the senses. Incrediblly rich, thick chocolate, espresso, and dare I say ... tobacco-like flavors. Remarkably dry though all of this. There are hops in here ... never cloying. Mouthfeel is super thick and coating. A man's beer throughout. All in all, incredible.

Enters the mouth with rich robust dark toffee, and burnt malt. This is a very heavy feel, but very fullfilling and welcome. Smooth and well balanced over the entire palate.

147,1160,JMH_,3.6,"Pours a nice looking dark dark brown to black colour with a mid-range sized head that leaves a small amount of tan residue on the glass.  The aroma is malty (a bit burnt), chocolate and coffee (although more the former than the latter) and certainly throws some alcohol into the mix as well.  The flavour hits on all of the aromas and is actually a bit sweeter than I remember it being in the past, with less coffee flavour as well. Alcohol is definitely present as well and will it is somewhat minimal in the flavour, it certainly lends to a degree of ""hotness"" in the mouthfeel that I wasn't so crazy about. It wasn't bad, it was just a bit out of place.  Overall, this is a good one. It got a lot of flavour and is big without being over the top, which is a tough feat to accomplish sometimes.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,96
147,1160,Vancer,4.77,"For review 500, I saved this bad boy for the past 6 months, giving it the Stone requested quiet time. Aging works - the alcohol recessed and was well hiddened.  What a pour, oil black, thick and gooey. No head but a thin brown ring  just check out that sliding oil slid around the glass (snifter, of course!).  Tons o plum, raisins, anise  the works in the aroma. On the sweet side, you can get a little bourbon barrel in the background.  Dry and powdery, this is just an awesome brew. I just wish the hell we could get Stone in Illinois, or Missouri. This would make for a great evening brew with friends  sharing about 6 bombers thru a cool fall nite sitting in front of the bonfire.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,96

I don't know how I resisted the urge to drink this fine beer, but somehow I found it within myself to do so.  The pour out of the bottle was very nice. Dark black color, opaque, with a small dark tan head. Exceptional aroma, lots of chocolate, roasted barley, and coffee. The taste brought it all together into what is probably one of the most complex beers I have ever tasted. There is a touch of sweetness at the end too.  Amazingly drinkable for such a strong and complex brew. In my opinion, this is one of the best beers in the country, and one of the best beers I have ever had.

147,1160,jdoolin,3.04,"Presentation: 22oz bomber poured into a wine glass in front of a fireplace in a cabin in the Smoky Mountains.  Appearance: Completely black with a thick, luxurious light brown head. Very nice looking beer in a great setting.  Aroma: Hmm... I smell the typical roastiness of a stout, but I get a lot more malt than anything. Strong caramel and molasses aromas, a lot more like a barleywine. Also a very strong alcohol aroma.  Taste and Mouthfeel: Very thick and syrupy. Much like the description of the aroma, I could taste the roastiness and light hints of chocolate and coffee, but it was overpowered by the malt sweetness and the associated flavors of caramel and molasses. Alongside the malt sweetness is the strong flavor of alcohol. Once again, more like a barleywine. No way I could have more than one of these in a sitting.  Notes: I find myself describing this beer much like I did Speedway Stout. It tastes like they mixed a stout with a barleywine. Not enough stout flavors and too much malt and alcohol for my tastes. I can see why this beer is so well liked, but personally, I prefer a roastier, dark malt flavor. I won't be reaching for this if I'm in the mood for an Imperial Stout.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,96
147,1160,Fugazme,4.52,"From notes:  Opaque... black. No light passes whatsoever.  A nice thickness with a great swirl... sticky, big tan head... excellent legs.  Chocolate, alcohol, caramel, figs, smoke, maple, nutty... I would say beautifully perfect aroma.  Taste is sweet and malty... raisins and coffee... great balanced hoppy bitterness on the swallow.  Mouthfeel is smooth and silky.  Very, very good.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,96
147,1160,blitz134,4.45,"Review 250...wanted something good. I've had some tasters of this in the past, and knew it was good, but wanted to sit down with my own. Enjoyed over a long evening of watching tv...  Pitch black body. Shiny, like oil, coming out of the bottle. Dark expresso colored head, small and fleeting. Leaves a slick surface on the top.  Dark toasted malt, bittersweet chocolate, expresso and coffee beans. All those dark aromas work in with a bit of sweet, dark fruits. Raisin and prunes. Fruit takes on a fermented aroma with the alcohol that is present.  Taste is pretty huge. Dominated by dark toasted malts and bittersweet dark chocolate. A bit of sweetness comes in after that, the dark fruits again. Lots of alcohol...it doesn't hold back at all, although it doesn't really burn that much.  Mouthfeel is oily slick, thick, full bodied. Slides down the tongue and down the throat. Flavor lingers for a bit and the alcohol hangs on a bit longer.  Really nice beer here, awesome aroma and nice flavor. Huge bodied but lots of alcohol. I'd gladly have this again and again, so its perfect from that standpoint but this is a huge beer and its drinkability is limited there. Double edged sword...whaddya do?",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,96
147,1160,sleazo,4.4,"Had this on tap at O Briens. this was the first time i have had this beer on tap but one that i have enjoyed from time to tiem in the bottle. The tap version was better, but not by much. This sucker was dark as night with very little head. I would describe the aroma as coffeeish with some hops and malt playing aorund too. As for the taste, i have to say it really does not get much better than this. You get chocolate/coffee and malt upon first sip, then you are hit with the heavy hand of the hops and alcohol. This iss a very nice beer, though i dont know how many of these you coudl have.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,96
147,1160,rsyberg01,4.74,"S - 22 oz. bomber courtesy of Warriorsoul whom I would like to thank for this classic. Top left corner states ""Early 2004 summer release. Bogartsky while you can."" My first ever stone offering.  A - Black, copper breaks through at some edges of the beer. Head is a dark beige color and isnt that big but definitely suffices. LAcing is sticky and decadent.  S - Raisins, chocolate, fruitness, roasted coffee, slight biscuit aroma, cherry, maybe a hint of raspberry. The alcohol heat makes me feel like I am going to breathe fire, very nice. I am in for a treat.  T - Caramel, fruity twang that is quite prominent, Huge warming in my chest, I wish it were snowing. Roasted notes of coffee and barley, sweet and sticky, definite dark dried fruits. You could reduce this and put it on your damn pancakes. Cherry, raisin, and fig are the three most obvious fruits. Devilishly unbelievable, a beer that definitely deserves an evil gargoyle adorning the front of the bottle.  M - Creamy, sticky, perfect combination of the heaviness to carbonation. Perfect.  D - This RIS is a spectacular example of what an RIS should be in the drinkability category.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,96
147,1160,eballard,4,I tasted the 2006 release of this beer. This beer pours as black as black can be with a dark brown head that settles into a light lace. The beer smells richly malt and of roasted coffee. It has a creamy malt sweetness and hints of caramel. There is a sweet fruitiness that settles into a light alcohol flavor. It has a smooth creamy feel with a crisp bite from the high alcohol content. In all this is a great example of an imperial Russian stout. If you like stouts that are over the top strong this is a must try.,Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,96
147,1160,akorsak,4.17,"A: Jet black with a coffee with cream colored small ring of head.  S: Smell is full of rich alefruits and a strong presence of alcohol.  T: Flavor is a big chewy amalgum of vinuous complexity, roasted coffee, chocolate and alcohol. As I sip, chocolate covered cherries come to mind, as this beer has the ability to go from chocolatey to fruity from one sip to the next.  M: The ale is very smooth, going down like the oil it resembles. The flavors in the beer are excellent, providing an ever-changing spectrum.  D: The 10.8% is steep and the alcohol is not well hidden. One bomber is more than enough for an evening.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,96
147,1160,stouty1,3.82,"WOW! This shocked my pallete! Was hard to get down the first couple sips. I am glad I waited to review this to get a couple more sips in. Sips is all you can get. Limited Spring 2006 release.  Poured a deep dark purple black, no transmission of light what-so-ever! No head either. I poured aggressivley too and maybe was only able to get about a 1/4"" max. Gone! Faster than I could get it up to my nose for a sniff.  Smells of dark chocolate and dark roasted malts. Seems to be a theme going here. Some fruit essence in there somewhere.  Almost like drinking whiskey. Harsh at first with a smooth finish. Coffee and chocolate mixed with a tinge of sweetness finishes with a brandy-like flavor. Medium body despit the sluggish motor oil appearance. This is once a night beer due to the high octane level. Maybe would have been better with some aging.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,96
147,1160,vanrassel,4.23,"I brought this back from San Diego shortly before the new carry-on restrictions against liquids came into effect. Phew!  It poured from a 650 mL bomber like motor oil and sat utterly opaque in my pint glass. A thick tan head with large bubbles sat atop this wonderous creation. The smell was inviting, with roasted malts, chocolate and some blackcurrant. There was a definite whiff of alcohol, but it wasn't overpowering and not indicative of the 10.8 per cent ABV wallop this beer packs.  Likewise, this is an eminently drinkable beer and hides its alcohol well going down. The low carbonation and full body made for a smooth mouthfeel. Roasted malts gave way to a rich, chocolately flavour that remained semi-sweet and never crossed over into bitter or burnt. It finished nice and dry.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,96
147,1160,techdiver,4.87,"Wow, this is amazing. Appearance, yeah it's black, can't see a thing through it. Smell is, well, I get more coffee, but it's great just to breathe it in.

147,1160,murrayswine,4.52,"Recieved from Boolshot in a trade.  Pours a beautiful deep black into my chalice, with a thin head and steady lacing.  The smell is huge and amazing. Dark fruits, chocolate, butter, rum, coffee, and brandy cream.  The taste is first dried cocoa, then plum, grape, and mint, followed by coffee roast.  This beer is absolutely phenominal, It's only true better is Dark Lord.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,96
147,1160,GimpyCane,4.9,"appearence: poured a motor oil black w/ a 1 inch mocha coffee creamy head. The head last the duration of the brew and left some great lacing. Love how intimidating this brew looks.  smell: well-balance w/ roasted coffee and malt, caramel and a hint of alcohol.  taste and mouthfeel: begins w/ a sweet caramel blast and strangely enough I got a nice expresso coffee at the end. The flavor was long lasting w/ a strong but welcoming taste of alcohol (like a IRS should have). The mouthfeel was exceptional w/ a full, thick, creamy body that followed w/ a pleasant soft carbonation. Nice warm feeling going down from the alcohol.  drinkability: although thick, syrupy and smooth, this beer is better sipped. Careful this brew packs a punch at 10.8% ABV and 1 22oz. bottle will start you off just fine.  Overall, this brew is awesome. Make sure you drink at 50 - 60 degrees to get the full and intense flavor it has to offer. Several months ago I bought 6 bottles and one thing I 've realize is how hard it is to keep them stored. Must restock for the winter. Thank you Stone for making one hell of a brew.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,96
147,1160,BlackJeremiah,4.65,"2006 edition, cellared for five months. Poured from a 22 oz. bomber into a Stone Russian Imperial Stout snifter.  A: Black, no undertones because it is thoroughly opaque. Noticably viscous when pouring, like engine oil. Even the roughest pour produces 1/2"" of head, tops, which settles to a negligible coffee-colored froth in moments. Gorgeous, like gleaming onyx or the space between stars.  S: Sweet, fresh-baked bread, chocolate, currant and espresso. Very inviting, very complex. Aeration and a second sniff brings out the currant and notes of fennel and mutes the bread. Obviously there are layers here, and the scents meld very well.  T: After five months, the highly disparate flavor profile I remember from its release is already melding and aging nicely, if perhaps faster than I anticipated. That being said, it's really very remarkable. Chocolate and sweet bread lead the charge, followed closely by currant and espresso. Overtaking all four of these quickly is the fennel/pine tar hop bitterness, which does well to mask the alcohol until the tail of the aftertaste, where the RIS lets you know it is 10.8% ABV.  M: Thick and chewy viscosity matches its flavor profile so well. It's really like drinking used oil, if used oil were delicious and aromatic. I love thick stouts, and this one definitely has the presence on the palate to qualify.  D: I've commented before that high ABV beers just don't seem as drinkable to me. This one is an exception. Of all my cellared beers, the Stone RIS is the hardest for me to age. I love sipping on one or two throughout an evening, and it is really one of my favorite beers. However, if you are one of those that find stouts too thick and filling, you should adjust the drinkability rating down one point. The flavors and hop presence make this beer easier to drink than a still, bland stout, but it's still VERY thick.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,96

147,1160,RedHaze,4,"2005 version.  Pours a deep jet black, with a dense one finger head that settles very slowly to a thick layer of foam, leaving behind a solid sheeting of lace.  Smell; dark roasted coffee mixed with bittersweet chocolate. There's a nice presence of dark fruits, and I'm also getting a little bit of anise.  Taste; the aroma of this beer is really good, but the flavor is incredible. The coffee and chocolate flavors come through much more prominently than they did in the nose. Dark fruits, such as plums and a touch of cherries, fill out the middle, and a touch of that anise and a spicy alcohol presence round out the end. Although the alcohol is noticeable, it's only a little, and doesn't detract from the beer at all.  Mouthfeel is full bodied, rich and very creamy, with a very good drikability that would be higher if this were not such a thick beer.  Whenever I try a beer with the magnitude of hype that surrounds a beer such as Stone's IRS, I'm always a bit worried that it won't live up to it. However, with this one, I had no reason to worry.

Still has a strong coffee smell with caramel and chocolate undertones. Has a sherry-soy taste without being too much.  Tastes great.

It poured into the hotel water glass with a big fluffy tan head that slowly disappeared; I need to travel with the proper glassware. The body is black, there is no light getting through at all. It had the look of olive oil being poured, very thick and viscous. The smell was really muted, only solvents getting through, and an alcohol bite. The taste was very complex. There was coffee with sweet cream, dark fruit (prunes), a spicy herb that I can't identify, and a bit of alcohol bite at the end of the sip. This beer is way more complex than my palate. It has a velvety smooth texture with a good level of carbonation. It is very drinkable for something this high in abv and complexity of taste. I am very glad I bought this.

Aroma is of roasted malt, coffee, dark caramel, pumpernickel bread and alcohol.  Taste is of chocolate, coffee, alcohol. There is a dark, almost burnt malty taste to this ale. Alcohol is very prevalent as it warms. Pretty agressive and bitter. There is some sweetness that offsets this at first, but as the ale warms, it starts to become a challenge to drink.

Taste is pretty right on with the smell but the alcohol pops out a little too much in the finish. The body was good for a ~11% beer and was good for the style.

147,1160,Jaynuze,5,"This is nothing short of an incredible Imperial. I've been reading about it for quite some time and finally had the fortune of grabbing two 22 oz. bottles from my local shop. My only regret is that I didn't buy the entire stock. It pours a very thick and leaves a lovely mocha colored lace across the top. Unlike some of the Imperials I've had lately, this one is B-L-A-C-K ... tar black, with a tinge of chocolate brown towards the top of the glass just below it's mocha head. Some have mentioned that carbonation cannot be seen ... it's because this baby is like a lunar eclipse ... no light is getting through this one. It's notes are of coffee, toffee, chocolate, and a smooth tinge of alcohol to round out its robust finish. It's malty alright ... but not overpoweringly sweet. Some may be dismayed when they hear coffee, but this one was even enjoyed by my coffee hating buddy. Though opaque in color, the alcohol and malts give this a smooth finish with a hint of sweetness. It warms the palate and fills the mouth with a myriad of flavors ... each complementing the other ... no one true flavor coming through unlike some of the Imperials I've tried that seem to have one defining note. The mouthfeel is smooth with a light carbonation. It wraps itself around your tongue and holds on for dear life. The taste lingers even after you have had your last sip. This was incredible. I'm really ticked that I didn't buy more since it's such a phenomenal beer. I'm hanging on to my second one for next winter as I've heard this baby only gets better with age. If you find the 2006, grab it fast. It's definitely worth it!",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,96

Reminds me of hot cocoa on Christmas morning as a child.  Big chocolate is present on the palate as well, but is more dark chocolate than milk chocolate.

A nice coffee flavor is dominating at first,then the thick chocolatey taste takes over. You get a nice roasted coffee and alcohol taste with this drink. It is pretty ""heavy"" on the palate.

147,1160,Estarrio,4.66,"While I have been enjoying Stone brews for some time, this particular offering had been eluding me. I finally procured a 750 ml bottle labeled ""spring 2006 limited release"". This exceptional beer defines for me why I love Stone brews. While I love Stone for their IPA's and American Strong Ales, they seem to excel in every beer genre that they attempt.  This poured viscous pitch-black oil with a medium coffee colored head. Retention was moderate and intricate lacings remained throughout. The smell is roasted malt, buttery toffee, sugar and a hint of burnt caramel.  The flavor is an incredible balance of molasses, roasted and burnt malt, chocolate, honey and sweet plum. The first tastes are sweet, quickly balanced by a subtle hint of bitter hops and then followed by a sweet, roasty aftertaste. The warm alcohol presence is apparent, but one would hardly guess 10.8% as the strength is well masked.  The palate is pleasingly thick, viscous syrup with moderate carbonation lending to a creamy, drinkable consistency that begs to be sipped all night long. This is a nice contrast to some comparable examples of the style that seem to fill me up very quickly.  Kudos to Stone on creating what I consider to be the best Imperial Stout that I've tried. They continue to exceed my expectations.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,96

Pours an opaque obsidian black with a thin finger mocha-beige head that slowly fades to light sticky lacing that coats the glass. Aroma is rich with a coffee roastiness, sweet malts, alcohol, bitter unsweetened chocolate. Taste is even richer than the nose lets on, hitting straight off the bat with an enormous malty sweetness that turns to roasty malt and coffee before leading off into the rich chocolate and alcohol finish. Leaves a slightly dry aftertaste, dry bitter roastiness paired with some warm alcohol. Mouthfeel is heavy and thick, viscosity similar to used motor oil, slick and slippery on the tongue. Lower levels of carbonation, pairs well with the characteristics of the beer. Drinkability is excellent despite the higher abv, which is hidden well, only hinted at slightly in the nose and in the aftertaste.

147,1160,dwarvenspirits,2.45,"This was the 2005 limited early summer release editon of this beer.  KAA-POW! That's the first thing that came to my mind, then ""WOW!"" This beer is a one beer per night drink. Definitely sip this monster beer because it's so thick and syrupy that you can only sip it. The worst part about this beer was the overpowering taste of alcohol. You can smell it when you pour it when you drink it, even when it's just sitting there. This definitely needs another year or two to age just to mellow out the alcohol in it. The color is rich and black and there is a roasted smell with the complements of coffee. The flavor is chocolate, at least what I could tell throught the hot alcohol flavor. Drinking this beer is like putting vodka in a stout and ruining the flavors of the stout. And I also think this definitely needs more hops added to it for bitterness just to balance out the sweet malty taste of it and the incredible alcohol flavor. I was really disappointed with this beer. The Stone Ruination IPA was fantastic but this RIS is horrible.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,96
147,1160,cbl2,4.4,"7/30/2005 $5.00 22 oz. 10.80% Limited Early Summer 2005 Release.  Appearance:  Pours a thick inky black with fine carbonation leading to a very thin dark tan head that settles rapidly, and laces the glass.  Aroma:  Chocolate and licorices come to mind with sweet marshmallow undertones and a touch of spicy chicory root as well as some soy/worchestershire sauce.  Taste/Mouthfeel:  Extremely full bodied and complex, with some burnt coffee grounds up front coupled with an intense chocolate sweetness. A little harsh midsip, showing it's youth. This will age wonderfully. Plum like chewiness towards the end, excellent ripe fruit characteristics.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,96
147,1160,jokelahoma,4.62,"Poured a deep, dark, and totally opaque black, with a small but frothy and loose dark tan head.  The aroma is a very interesting mix of licorice, coffee, chocolate, and roast malts, with subtle hints of black currant and citrusy hops sneaking in as well. This may be the most complex smelling beer I've ever experienced. I had to sniff for awhile, leave it, come back and try it again in a cycle that repeated at least three times. Each time, I think I picked up something that wasn't there the time previously. There's a whole lot going on in here. After smelling it, I can't wait to taste it, and isn't that what a beer's aroma is supposed to be all about?  As complex as the aroma is, it doesn't hold a candle to the multitude of tastes that hit your tongue on first sip. This is simply a ""wow"" experience. There are flavors of chicory, dark bittersweet chocolate, espresso, dark berries, roasted malts, black licorice... just amazing. Even more amazing is the fact these tastes don't come at you in succession. Rather, they all jump out at you right up front, with the ""hey look at me"" attitude of a child in a talent show, and they don't let up until the end. Even then, those tastes only seem to finally be subdued by the long, lingering bitterness that goes on and on. This is just an amazing flavor, if I can use the word ""amazing"" again. The only thing that kept me from giving this a perfect ""5"" in the taste department was the very prevalent alcohol. That will no doubt meld into the rest of the flavors with age. Unfortunately, I'm out of this brew, and it's a tough trick for me to get more here in Kansas.  The mouthfeel to this one is thick, rich, and given it's a RIS, wonderfully appropriate.  Overall, this is a great beer. It's not a guzzler, by any means, and anyone calling this a session beer is a liar. But for what it is, it's done extremely well. I wish I had bought more, so I could cellar this and see how it changes over the course of a year or so. Strongly recommended.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,96
147,1160,peabody,4.85,"This has to be the best beer I have ever tasted. When you pour the stuff out into the glass, you are thinking, motor oil. It has a dark head that goes away quickly. The smells hit your nose and the flavors are many and pronounced. This was a 2005 bottle and I understand that it needs a year or two to gain its full potential. Liked it so much I bought a case of the 2006. Stone has some great beers and this one has to be the better of the batch.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,96
147,1160,stodbrew,3.63,"Poured into the glass a rich, dark black color. No light getting through this beer. Had a briefly lasting tan head that settled to a pretty thin cap in no time at all.  Aroma is of chocolate, roastiness, some coffee, licorice and a fair amount of soy sauce.  Taste is of more of the same as the aroma. A bit on the sweet side, with a fair amount of alcohol heat coming through. More soy sauce, as well.  Mouthfeel is great, however. Its full and well rounded.  Overall, I've not been terribly impressed with this beer. Its good, and I'll drink another after it has some age on it, but not really among my favorites.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,96
147,1160,FlyFisher2782,4.65,"Pours very dark but I couldn't get much head out of the initial pour.  This is without a doubt the heaviest brew I have ever consumed. It pours like a milkshake.  The malts are toasted to peak darkness but there is no burnt or smoky flavor here, pure dark coffee and chocolates come through while entering a slight bit of fruitiness before the slightly spicy finish.  When I first poured it, I could smell the heavy alcohol content, but drinking it revealed its true prowess... this is a SMOOTH brew, it does not drink like a 10+ % alcohol beer at all... in fact I could barely discern any alcohol. Ridiculously drinkable. Smooth. A very filling Brew.  Another job well done by Stone Brewing.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,96

Some malt then big overpowing alcohol. Burns a bit going down, warms you up. But a wiskey like burn from a stout, not a good thing  M- balanced feels like a stout, again to much alcohol  D- unfinishable, way to much alcohol in the mouth for this beer to be anyway near refreshing. Some complexity sure but the heavy alcohol taste takes over.  Notes- this is the second of stone's offerings I have tried (VE 6 06.06) in recent days. Both seem to have tons of potential with age, but are to overpowering young. If I buy stone again it will be years before i drink it.

Deep breath...and here we go.  Pour: Black hole black, nothing escapes under a minimal skim of coffee cream head.  Nose: oatmeal grain/malt, milk chocolate, lactose and caramel sugar.  Taste: Coffee, toffee, vanilla/caramel cream, bittersweet chocolate, a bit of lactose milkiness and booze in the finish.  Feel: boozy thin to medium body, smooth, smooth, smooth  Drinkability/Overall: Mad drinkable for almost 11%, impeccable balance between sweet caramels and toffees and bitter coffees and chocolates and grainy malts.

147,1160,expatsteve,4.8,"What a great beer for review 100 - thanks to DaPeculierDane for this one...  Appearance: Black, with a 1/2 inch cappucino head. Doesn't leave much by way of lacing. Medium viscosity.  Aroma: Spectacular nose - chocolate, with port notes, raisins, blood plums and green apple skins. A little molasses.  Taste: Wonderfully understated for the style and the level of complexity. Mild chocolate, with cocoa, lactic sours. A little booze on the tongue, but balanced by back palate nuttiness until the slightly vegetal aftertaste. Fruit developments, predominantly raisins, with bursts of brown sugar. Simply fantastic.  Mouthfeel: Smooth in the mouth with a wonderfully dry finish. Low, constant carbonation.  Drinkability: Spectacular - completely drinkable despite a heavy complex flavor and a high ABV. Body carries this brilliantly. One hell of a beer - fantastic whether judged according to style, to flavor, or to sheer drinkability.

147,1160,MLegendre,3.75,"A: Jet black and very thick, can't see through the glass whatsoever. Unfortunatly even with a hard pour I could only get a very thin tan head that disapeared as soon as it appeared. Very little lacing.  S: Very strong smell of dark fruits and hints of roasted malt and soy sause. The sweet fruit smell is dominant.  T: The super sweet malt hits first reminding me a bit of North Coast's Old Stock, then comes roasted espresso like flavors in the finish. Aftertate is bitter like coffee. Alcohol is present but not overpowering. I was hoping that the roasted flavors would be more dominant then they were.  M: Very thick and creamy. More carbonation than I thought there would be (a good thing). Goes down very smooth for something so heavy.  D: Though it was very good, it's not something I could drink horribly often, but something I would love to have again. This is definitly a sipper, I even shared my 22 and still had a hard time finishing it. Not because I didn't like it, but because it's so rich and heavy. a bomber of this goes a long way.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,96
147,1160,veggiemafia,3.98,"I've reviewed the 04 and 05 previously, so this is my most-reviewed beer. Charting the differences has been kind of fun.  Appearance is similar to both of the previous years, if I remember. Jet freakin' black with a substantial tan head and good retention for the style.  Smell is extremely fruity, plums and raisins, with a good amount of espresso in there, as well. Quite boozy when the beer is this young, though, which is why it didn't get a 4.5 or 5.  Taste is more of the same, with a fairly hot alcohol presence. Still very nice, with an intense sweetness that's balanced with an earthy hop and a dark roast coffee/espresso.  Mouthfeel is velvety, creamy and luscious.  Drinkability kind of suffers because of the alcohol hotness and the overall booziness of this one. Still not nearly as boozy as Weyerbacher Heresy, and Heresy is only 8% abv.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,96
147,1160,idResponse,4.46,"An onyx brew that sucks everything else in the room away and leaves you purely focused on the beer and nothing but the beer. The smell then leaves you begging to taste what you know you are expecting. You are smelling the expectation of something so dark, so smooth so rich, yet so mellow that you could swill this stuff down faster than water itself. You finally take a swig and it tastes like a full compliment of laughing licorice soldiers with ginger helmets and their complimentary cavalry of mellow spice horses thundering across the plains of your tounge, You are forced to put more in your mouth uncontrollably. Once you begin to consume you will not wish to stop. Most excellent.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,96

Thick even on the eyes, the tan head emerges and peaks at almost two fingers. Bubbles randomly pop and fizzle into submission over several minutes.  Smell- A generous, full aroma showcases chocolate, some molasses, and black currants quite well. Heavy and really, really huge... the fruit notes here are much more pronounced compared to every other beer of this style I've tried... save for Dark Lord last year. Awesome and damn impressive.  Taste- Rich, fruity notes of black currants blend seamlessly with the roasty character of chocolate and coffee. The alcohol presence is felt not only in the warmth throughout the body, but certainly in the back end of the tongue during and after the swallow. Bold and decadent... a gargantuan example of a RIS.  Mouthfeel/Drinkability- Thick and creamy in the mouth... the carbonation is rightfully downplayed in favor of a smooth, slick, viscous experience.

147,1160,mithrascruor,3.65,"22 oz. bottle poured into a mug.  Appearance: Pours an extremely dark brown/black color, and seems like you're pouring chocolate sauce. Looks completely black in the glass and has a small tannish-brown head that turns into a film fairly quick.  Smell: Has most all the smells that you might find in a dark beer: roasted malts, chocolate, coffee, molasses, etc. The overall smell is a bit like a mocha. Maybe a tad overkill, though.  Taste: Very heavy on the malts, with the coffee and chocolate kicking in shortly thereafter. The alcohol is rather apparent at times as well. Somewhat bitter in the aftertaste -- more of a coffee bitterness than a hoppy one.  Mouthfeel: Heavy-bodied and very smooth, with a light bit of tingling. Light burning of alcohol too.  Drinkability: Very high alcohol content (which I don't personally find bothersome), but it's the distinct taste of the alcohol makes it difficult to drink.  One of the better beers I've tried from Stone Brewing Co. This one is over the top as usual, but not as much as the others. The flavor itself is quite good, but it seems as if they dumped some grain alcohol in during bottling. I like to feel alcohol in a beer, but not taste it. This has the distinct taste of hard alcohol -- while I don't mind the taste & feel, I personally don't think that it belongs in a beer.

Black color, dark brown head that quickly dissipated, I didn't get the head the picture shows, but maybe my glass was dirty. Smell is very nice. Full of chocolate, dark fruit, piney hops, coffee, and I think some oak was present. Taste doesn't let down either, chocolate in the beginning, coffee stepping in before a dry vanilla oak finish. Mouthfeel had great carbonation and was full bodied, heavy on the tongue.

It poured absolutely pitch black into a snifter and the light from my halogen desk lamp did not even penetrate it, which was impressive. It had a very small tan head and left very little lacing. The smell of baking chocolate and roasted coffee beans predominated, with the taste being of bitter chocolate and espresso. There was very little carbonation and the mouth feel was at the same time heavy and silky, with very lttle carbonation.

Pours black with light brown head and smells a bit sherry-like, chocolatey brandy maybe with a bit of alcohol. The roasted flavors really came our in the flavor. Chocolate, burnt coffe, espresso, more chocolate, and warming alcohol; quite tasty and it really lingers. It has a nice thick mouthfeel, but it took me a while to get through maybe 5-6 oz.

147,1160,edskirk3,4.33,"Limited Spring 2006 Release. I planned on saving it for at least the fall, but I could resist no longer. I used a pint glass. It's viscous. It's opaque black with a creamy, sticky mocha head. It looks formidable.  Complex aroma. Chocolate, coffee, and burnt malts. And alcohol. Other stuff I'm not too sure of. Dark fruit? Black cherries?  Take a few sips and... oh yeah. It's Imperial, all right. At first, I'm thinking bitter chocolate, or coffee without sugar. Keep drinking and more levels of flavor are revealed to you. On the back of the bottle they mention anise and black currants. I will admit, I don't know what those things are. That's why we have Wikipedia:  ""Roasting enhances the flavor of anise... also used in anise-flavored liqueurs (such as raki, arak and ouzo) and is the dominant ingredient used in the infamous and sometimes-banned liquor absinthe. It is also used in soft drinks such as root beer.""  ""Blackcurrants have a very sweet and sharp taste. They are made into jelly, jam, juice, ice cream, cordial and liqueur. In the UK, Europe and Commonwealth countries, some types of confectionery include a blackcurrant flavour, but this is generally missing in the United States, even within the same brand. Instead grape flavour in candy (including grape jelly) almost mirrors the use of blackcurrant in both its ubiquity in the USA, and its rarity on the eastern side of the Atlantic.""  Now I know. And now that I think of it, another flavor comes to mind: licorice. Black licorice.  ""It should be noted, though, that in most of these [licorice] candies the taste is reinforced by aniseed oil...""  Now I know. I am that much more intelligent and that much more numb after drinking this beer. Yes, it's a sipper. A philosophical sipper. Do not gulp. The alcohol is quite obvious, but it does not detract from the overall flavor profile.  I am nourished, Stone Brewing Company.

Yes I just used that word but if you try the damn beer you will see what I mean. The Alcohol, though apparent in the smell, is masked well considering 10.8 %.

A very blended mature smell that reminded me of cloves, charcoal, oak, coffee, dark chocolate, and dried fruit...oh and a little sharp alcohol at the end.  T - Extremely pleasant. Stouts are not even my favorite type of beer and this baby just put a smile on my face. The flavor was not overwhelmed by the ""take-no-crap"" 10.8%.

M - Simply pleasant and warm...makes you feel as if you're at your grandma's warming your feet by the fire.  D - In one word....scary. In two, scary and delicious! I finished a whole bottle of this in an afternoon ofcourse..not noticing that this baby is a whopping 10.8%.

It's got the deep, dark fruit flavours that make Doppelbocks so wonderful -- plums and raisins, most raisins really. This is counterbalanced by a light, powdery 'darkness' that ephemeral bitterness that roasted barley can contribute when used in just the right balance.  As it warms, the alcohol definately becomes more biting. I would say that is really the only flaw with this beer. That, and the hopiness seems to be fighting with the roasted barley. The two, very different kinds of bitterness are really fighting for attention here. It's more like two spoiled brats rather than a heavyweight champion fight.

The robust and very complex palate includes a variety of roasted and burnt flavors such as coffee, bitter chocolate, burnt grain, as well as some dark rum notes and some distinct hints of dark fruit (raisins, plum, etc). The rich, lingering finish has a satisfying burnt bitterness. The mouthfeel is very thick with mildly active carbonation.  What a great Imperial stout: rich, thick with very nice burnt flavors and a great overall complexity. The alcohol is well hidden, barely detectable considering the nearly 11% ABV. Its not quite as good as in years past, but honestly, the difference is so minimal that it could be my taste buds numbing down or my palate becoming more demanding. In any event, its still very good and entirely satisfying.

Slighty vinous scent. Not very strong...typical of Imperial Stouts, but nothing that grabs me.

Long finish slowly turns mildly bitter and earthy. Alcohol shows itself in the aftertaste, a little bit of lip-numbing tongue-tickling burn. Still remains smooth and silky down the hatch.

147,1160,Kendo,4.35,"OK, here's the scoop on the 2004 release:  Poured a dark, impenetrable black with a chocolate milkshake-colored head. Smelled of chocolate -- unsweetened cocoa and dark chocolate, with a tad bit of fruity sweetness. Mmmm. Candy. A truly enticing scent.  As for taste: my first thought was the alcohol -- it was more up front than in the 2006. Next I noticed the chocolate and a bit of licorice, fighting with the malt and coffee flavors for dominance. Not sure any one of them was declared the winner, and oddly enough (compared to the 2006 at least), the hops were pretty muted. Not sure if it's because this is a different recipe or because the aging had toned down that bitterness, allowing the malty, sweet flavors to take charge. . . .  Mouthfeel: I described it as thick and rich but also velvety, with just a tad bit of carbonation dancing around in there. Definitely a heavy beer, but relatively modest in heft on the tongue. Nice balance.  All in all we were most impressed with the nose of the 2004 compared to the 2006. But on taste the general consensus was that the 2006 was a little bit better. But both are excellent. If you find them, buy them. And enjoy.  Drinkability: The high ABV and taste of alcohol detracts from the overall drinkability.

I just about cracked open my bottle of Old Guardian that I'm cellaring becuase I just needed a 'kick you in the ass and leave you for dead' kind of brew. But luckily I got ahold of a Russian Stout. The pour was slow and deliberate and it oozed out thickly to produce a nice head of tans and light browns, the glass completely impenetrable by light. I held the glass up in direct sunlight, and failed to see the sun on the other side....how fitting for this beer, so complex and complete it can block out the sun. I let the stout sit for several minutes to warm ever so slightly and took a whiff. Coffee, chocolates, a bit of an earthy tone and the flavors of heavily roasted malts. I prepared myself for liftoff, raised my glass and took a sip. Outstanding. Rich, smooth, thick, the mouthfeel was exceptional. Flavors of coffee, roasted fruits, alcohol, and malts. It is right up there with Old Guardian as one of my most favorite beers in the ""Good God, how in the hell can this be over 10%abv"" category. Sip, savor, enjoy, and respect the black.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,96
147,1160,mitchfor3,5,"2006 Vintage.  Damn. Near. Perfect.  What a beer. The 11% is at once devastatingly present, yet highly drinkable. This beer took the greatest aspects of my favorite RISs and put them into one. Part Old Rasputin, part Storm King, the list goes on, but none of the other fantastic beers in this category combine such incredible depth and complexity with such amazing drinkability. I really can't wait to see how this one tastes in a year or two.  My first perfect score, and a well deserved one.  Side note: This beer caused me to reflect on Stone's lineup and really grasp how incredible of a brewery it is. Stone just overtook the top spot in my book.

A brief cascade settled into two fingers of firm dense camel colored froth. The head faded to a wispy cap. Lace was thick and inviting.  Smell was dark roasted coffee beans, sweet dark prunes, cocoa, diacetyl rich buttery toffee and a charred smokiness.  Taste was unsweetened cocoa, charred, darkly roasted coffee with an excellent balance of malts and hops.  Thick and viscious, full bodied. Heavy, but somehow creamy on the mouthfeel.

The smell is incredible, wafting out through the room strong enough to be easily detected without putting the glass under my nose. Sweet toasted chocolate with a hint of alcohol. Prunes, raisens and maybe dried dates. Strong malts with a touch of caramel. Taste is a mellow and silken burnt sweet chocolate roast fest. Even the aftertaste is roasted chocolate with a hint of hops coming through with some expresso bean flavors. This is quite amazing. Mouthfeel is excellent. Full and thick with plenty of coating and leaves the feeling of a slick sensation all over.

S- Roasted malt and chocolate aroma with a heavy licorace prescence, some fruityness also shows up.  T&M-Very bitter almost like eating dark chocolate covered espesso beans. I can feel the alcohol burn as this goes down my throat,but I won't be critical of that due to it being so young. I'm sure that will be different with the next one I try in the future.

One year old at opening. Pours dark and thick like black oil. Slight brown head. Smells like a mildly sweet, black forest cake. Soft hint of fruit in the background. Be prepared to taste a little bit of alcohol, but then savor the creamy, balanced elixir. Strong malt to chew on and a subtle hop on the back end. This isn't beer...it is my dinner and dessert.

It reminds me very much of Okocim Baltic Porter. Mouthfeel is smoooth, yet has a rich chewy note that sticks to the palate quite nicely. Drinkability is great for the high abv. This is a 10 abv?

Finally found this at Cork's in Mansfield (which is a pretty awesome store, review to follow). After all it's chalked up to be on this site, and it's apparent ellusiveness, I wasn't sure if it would live up to expectations. Like with many Stone brews, it taught me the error of my ways.  Pours an amzingly dark colour, with tan, caramel like head.  Smells of fruit, molasses, and a kind of floral/pine. Very inviting.  Tastes reflect the aroma, with rich roasted malts, chocolate, coffee, and a bit of sweet fruits, like raisins or currants. Very good.  The taste can be a whallop, but it goes down smooth.

After letting it breathe and warm a bit i get chocolate, coffee, a few burnt notes with a slight hop bite and alcoholic finish. I'm getting toast in the aftertaste.  Mouthfeel is medium/full (but not full enough for the style imo), a bit oily and slick with low carbonation. It's this beers weakest attribute.  Due to high abv, drinkibility seems rather low.

It has a small dark tan head that leaves some light lacing. It has a bouquet of flavor that includes coffee, chocolate, spices and finishes with a light nutty scent. Wow Im not exactly sure how to describe the taste because of the many different flavors. It starts out with a clove/spice type flavor that lends way to a chocolate taste and then melds into a nutty coffee type flavor, although the alcohol is definitely present it hides the 10% quite well.

My first one was in a large wine glass). Ebon black body, mahogany head. Some lacing, but that's not what I'm looking for in a stout. I'm holding it up to the light and...nothing. Nothing comes through. It's blackness is absolutely astounding. Makes some other, excellent RIS's look like Shiner Bock.  Smell: Espresso, chocolate, roast malt, and a woodiness (ash, maple? not Oak, but something hard), and alcohol.  Tastes like everything I want in a big, strong stout. Lovely toasted malt flavor, with some side flavors just like the aroma. Hints of dark, dark chocolate, and espresso made from dark roasted beans. The wood is hickory, now that I've had some time to ponder it. Wonderful.  Starts out with a sharp cripness in the mouth that rapidly opens up and smooths out. This beer is thick and coats everything it touches, allowing an adequate time for the aftertastes to develop.  Drinkability. Well, there has to be a knock somewhere on this brew. After all, nothing's perfect. This is a very drinkable beer. Surprisingly drinkable, given it's style. However, it hits like a Mother..., so it's not TOO drinkable.

147,1160,orfeu,4.83,"""Limited Spring 2006 Release."" Brought up from my increasingly warmer cellar, then chilled for about 15-20 minutes in the freezer, then set out for a few minutes before opening. Poured into a 17-ounce snifter, the 2006 Stone Imperial Russian Stout is dark like a 90% cocoa Belgian chocolate bar -- nearly all light in the room is absorbed by this beer's blackness -- with a dense cafe con leche colored foam cap that disperses within a minute to a thin cover and ring. Aromas of semi-sweet chocolate, deeply dark plums, and raisins soaked in spiced rum. I also pick up a scent which reminds me of Coco-Wheats or Malt-o-Meal. The flavors I initially detect are raisins, rum-stewed prunes, powdered cocoa, and a twangy mineral finish. Earthy and bitter aftertaste. After warming a bit, some gigantic roasted malt flavors emerge, yielding a much fuller chocolate presence as well as an essence of toasted grain. Huge oil-slick mouthfeel which I imagine in time will become pure velvet. The nearly 11% alcohol content is barely noticeable other than in a lower esophogeal warming. Nearly perfect; this will only improve in mouthfeel and flavor with some age on it. Absolutely deserving of the hype.  Maximum respect to dmeadows for the trade to Stone-starved Western New York!",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,96
147,1160,clickpush,4.16,"Pour: 22oz bomber to tulip glass. Has an incredibly dark body that looks like coffee pouring out of the bottle and then like black ink in the glass. It came out with a one finger, mocha colored head that continued to grow after I finished pouring, all the way up to about two fingers, making plenty of noise as it bubbles. The head goes down slowly to leave some excellent lacings. Although the beer is opaque, some slim bubble trails are visible around the outside of the glass.  Nose: The alcohol is very present in this glass, and I'm not sure I could tell the difference between this beer and an Irish coffee in a blind smelling. Lots of chocolate maltiness, coffee, and Kahlua. Smells tasty.  Mouth: Enters with a nice blend of flavors, like hot chocolate around a campfire, some smokiness, and a long lasting bitter flavor after swallowing like unsweetened baking cocoa. There are also some berry notes that come out as the beer warms, but I think it needs some time in the cellar before these flavors mature. On the downside, the alcohol in this beer stings my mouth before I've even swallowed. It's too noticeable, from the time the beer's about halfway through my mouth and on through the following exhale. Hopefully some cellar time will cure that as well.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,96
147,1160,HellsBELLS24,4.83,Excellent!  This Imperial stout has a great aroma of vanilla and fresh chocolate malt. The smoothness of this stout (I feel) can be attributed to the malt. This beer has less of a hoppiness and more of a malt characteristic.  It's smoothness is with the best of them. For a russian imperial it is very easy to drink. Although for non stout drinkers it may be a little tough.  I have 3 bottles of the 2006 and I am trying ver hard to keep them around for a while. It may be hard considering that I have already drank 4 of them.  Excellent Brew!,Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,96
147,1160,trep,4.66,"2006 Edition  Pours black as coal, a finger or so head of dark tan foam rises above the thick opaque body. Settles down to a thin layer of tan that leaves a good bit of lace. Still a 5.  Roasted malt and dark chocolate hit you right from the start. Followed by a little alcohol which rounds it out nicely. Rich mocha and vanilla come out as it warms up. Not as vivid as last years but when I had last years it had been aged for roughly 10 months. Give this one time and it'll all hang out.  Holy mackerel! A nice smooth start that explodes into a vast array of flavors. First a rich smooth vanilla hits you followed by a little alcohol bite that fades into a bittersweet dark chocolate and roasted malt finish. The thickness of this brew really coats your mouth, about like a milk-shake does. Perfect carbonation as well.  Although this one might be a bit rough-drinking for the average beer-drinker, I love these big hearty beers that take you on a journey. Incredibly drinkable for such a high ABV brew. Only 3 left in my stash and I plan on trying one this time next year and two years from now.

App: the only reason I did not go for the full 5.0 here is that it is not magically enchanting, sounds dumb.. but I have seen some big stouts that seem to swirl and shimmer. Other than that, it has a nice sturdy head and all the right colors for the types of beers I like.  Smell: Got some rasin type smell, dark deep lucious grains in the nose, some booze, but the smell is not huge, not big amounts of cocoa, or huge amounts of coffee. Its a good smell just not huge.  Taste: first sip, so scared.. tasted a small hint of trash can,wich is the word i think i use for the bad OX word. I said OH NO!, and then leaned in for another sniff, and another gulp... SAFE! no trash can! just rich huge drinkable wonderful stone ris. I will note, it is hard for me to give a down to earth review cause this beer is my lil sip of heaven. I love fat dog, I love Old raspy, I love Wake n bake, I thought storm king was pretty good, just weak for me, I liked the peche imortal coffee stout thingy, but found it a bit to grainy tasting, dog fish head wws, well thats a diff animal, but it was ok. loved dog woods youngblood porter.. the list goes on of my fav beers, BUT this one is king for me. my taste discription is this, take all those, besides some of the stronger coffee flavors, and take out the bitternes and dry mouth (fat dog) the sometimes trashy and overly booze flavor (old raspy) and add more richness, more creamy thick gooey mouthfeel and plant your self in dark beer heaven.  MF: huge, very full without drying your tounge up or coating the back of your mouth with that snot feel.  drinkablity: VERY, I have trouble not chugging the thing. If I had a bunch of these around I would soon be laying on the floor in a pile of bottles.   This is my favorite beer, this bottle was a reminder of that.

Here goes the review:  Pours very thick (motor oil like if you will) with pitch black color and thick head and good lacing. Smells strong with coffee and toasted aromas. The taste just wasn't I was expecting. I somewhat expected a better blend of the flavors that just wasn't there. I felt the coffee taste overwhelms. Mouthfeel is thick and goes down smooth.

Beer pours a deep brown, maybe black with a decent head and a good bit of lacing on the glass. The head dies down fairly quickly, but that isn't too much of a detriment. Smell is great. Roasted malts, coffee, chocolate .. all of them meld together very well. Taste is much like the smell. I can taste all of those elements, but there is also a pronounced fruit yeastiness as well.

Believe every word of it. Stones RIS is nearly perfect. Jet black. Bubbly dark tan head. Vinous aromas, dark fruit, chocolate, and a massive, unparalleled roastedness. Flavors of huge burnt dark roast coffee, nuts, vanilla, chocolate, dark fruits, everything one could ask for. Mouthfeel is perfect. Smooth, balanced, well hopped, partially covered to fading alcohol.

147,1160,rodrot,4.03,"For my 100th beer review, I decided to crack open a bottle of this gem that I acquired in a trade. The beer poured totally black with a 1/4 inch light brown head. Aroma was of coffee, roasted malts and hops. Taste was of espresso coffee with lots of smoky burnt flavors coming through and notes of cocoa, ripe fruit, alcoholic warmth and hop bitterness. This is without a doubt a sipping beer, very full bodied and sort of like drinking a sherry or port. Nevertheless, I finished off the bomber easily and found myself wishing I would have aged this a little longer. At least until the colder months arrive.

He also has a Snifter of this beer in his right hand. Like all of the Stone bomber bottles, the back of the bottle had plenty of information about the beer. The date on the bottle is on the front under the Gargoyle and mine is the new Spring 2006 Release. On one of the sides they have a small picture of the Stone Gargoyle raising a glass with the caption of 10 years of Brewing Stone.  Appearance: When poured into my Brooklyn Brewery imperial pint glass, the beer was a dark ink black with no light shining through. Another beer that was disappointing in the head of foam department. All I got was just a little thin skim of tan colored foam and even that dissipated into just a few rings and very little sticky tan colored lace around the glass. I kept trying to swirl the glass to get a better head of foam, but still remained the same.  Smell: It had a rich pleasant aroma of dark bitter chocolate, dark fruits, roasted coffee beans, and just a hint of roasted malt in the end. Basically the aroma was nothing but dark and roasted.  Taste: This beer was very complex in dark and roasted flavors, just like the aroma was. There was plenty of roasted coffee beans up front and then come the roasted malts, little dark fruits and the bitter dark chocolate. After all of those dark and roasted flavors, come this huge whopping taste of alcohol at the very end. If you love dark, roasted, and alcohol in your taste, then you'll love this beer!  Mouthfeel: Just what I expected from a beer with that taste and alcohol content. It was very thick and full bodied with an aftertaste of bitter hops and plenty of alcohol. This beer doesn't want to bother with hiding it's alcohol content!  Drinkability: An excellent sipping beer that you better be careful about. 22oz. of this beer is good enogh for me!

147,1160,benito,3.78,"From the tap to a snifter at Falling Rock in Denver. They had just run out of the '05 vintage, so I ""settled"" for '06.  This pours an impenetrable black with a dark tan head that dissipates rather quickly and leaves only swirls on top of the beer. Licorice is the dominant aroma in the bouquet, though it is complimented by a slight hint of chocolate. There is also a light hint of bubble gum.  The flavor is aggressive: a mix of burnt wood, licorice, and bitters, as well as a hint of dark chocolate. It comes strong across the tongue, weakening into a mere hint of its previous bitterness by the time it reaches the back of the palate. Were it not for the creaminess of the body, I would have found this too bitter and imbalanced. As it is, there could be a better marraige between the beer's aggressive flavors and its overall texture.  Rather easy to drink for a RIS, but this is a sipping drink to be sure.  Worth a look, but IMO, this is a slightly overrated imperial stout. I'd choose Bell's Expedition Stout over Stone any day of the week.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,96
147,1160,Foxman,5,"It pours an impassably dark, inky celestial black, no light escaping, not even a glint, maybe even capturing neutrinos. A figner of brown mousse foam slides up, then down to froth on a pool of crude. Twisty lacing dances along the inside of the glass.   The aroma is almost as dark as the hue, with an edge of charred malt, Turkish coffee, black cherry, glove leather, and port. The merest hint of a hoppy bite is quickly inundated by a muscular current of alcohol.  Upon sipping, there charges a crispy bitter scarp of darkly roasted malt, the sugars deeply caramelized to an earthy snap. Still, a curl of dark fruit sweetness drifts through, along with an alcohol-driven vinous character. Coffee and dark chocolate come about, as well as a slight biscuit note. Residual malt and late-arriving hops combine to deliver a long and memorable bitter legacy. Complex and fundamental, blended and revealing, earthy and rich, it's all that, and a bit more.  Full bodied, it caresses the palate, thick and coating, bordering on chewy, a sinewy and soft glaze for the tongue.  If the finest, plushest velvet was a beer, it may just be this one. Big, full, rich, lustrous, sumptuous-if I enjoyed this any more, the experience might become sexual. Wonderfully complex, it's so artfully blended that it's never a challenge, or too busy. The ABV is a kick, but it's too damned hard to care about that, at least until morning. If I had enough, I'd fill a tub with this beer and bathe in it, and then drink the tub dry. Well, ok...enough of that...let's just say, this is real close to as good as it gets.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,96
147,1160,ColoradoBobs,4.03,"Review on May 22, 2006  Spring 2006 release in a 22 ounce bomber. Chilled then set out to warm.  Vigorous pour yielded a very large creamed-coffee reverse-cascading head that quickly faded to a thin but solid ring, over a completely opaque black body. Decent lacing, but not too much.  Rich smell of coffee, roasted fruits, dark chocolate, burned raisins and cherries.  Nice espresso and unsweetened chocolate taste, with boozy back-notes of rum-soaked raisins. There's some toasted pumpernickel bread and burned sugar back there too. Not quite the malt depth and overall complexity I look for in a RIS.  Mouthfeel was nice and round, full and mouth-coating, but a little bit thinner than I expected.  Drinkability is quite nice.  Honestly, this was not what I was expecting: I mean, I was SO pumped in anticipation, since it is rated (as of mid-May, 2006) just above 3F Dark Lord. Believe me, this is no Dark Lord! Indeed, it's WAY, WAY, W-A-A-A-Y short of the DL! Far from being the second best beer in the world, this isn't the second best beer in my refrigerator. Don't get me wrong: it's good. But definitely not THAT good!  EDIT, November 1, 2006 -- Not the seventh best beer in the world, and possibly the seventh best in my cellar. Still very good. Still not THAT good!  EDIT, March 12, 2008 -- I note that this beer has fallen to #15 in the world. It is not that good. MAYBE in the top 100, though not in my opinion: it's tied for 84th place out of the 339 beers I've reviewed.  EDIT, October 18, 2008. I've now reviewed 400 beers. This beer is tied for #93 on my list, but is still hanging in on the Best of BA"" list at #16. How do you spell ""overrated""?",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,96
147,1160,pjwilson,4.8,"Been hit with a freak rain storm here in Sacramento on this Late May sunday. frankly depressing as hell, perhaps this fresh '06 Stone RIS will cheer me up a hair.  appearance: I've had a lot more Russian Imperial Stouts than my last encounter with beer. Speedway Stout for one. still this beer still looks great poured into my white wine glass. Siberian Crude. Pitch Black when held to the light. very, dark tan head with pours big and then settles into a nice film that never truly lets up.  smell: ah so good. Black currents, figs and come chocolatly smells. Low on the coffee and roastiness common to other big stouts. This is closer to quad like smothness, without any yeast character though. A pleasure to sniff.  taste: very good. lacking almost any roast character. similar to smell, we have figs, currants, smooth chocolate, but no coffee. there is alcohol in the taste as well. an excepted backing of bitterness comes through in the end, although never overwelms, perfect balance.  mouthfeel: about right. light for a beer of this size, but still it has a solid thickness you expect. glides right past the tounge, no problem.  drinkability: a good sign, is when your hand is constantly reaching for another sip. a beer like this you sip, but when it's this good, you sip often.  After a glassI already feel better, and somehow the rain doesn't seem so bad. A fantastic beer. I would love to have this side by side with speedway stout, because they are sort of on opposite sides of the Russian Imperial stout spectrum, this being the smooth and malter of the two, speedway more roasty and coffee like. Right now i'm very, very content, and will have to get several more bottles while I can. Not really to age, but just to make sure i can have one once a month at least. One of the best beers of all time.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,96
147,1160,TurdFurgison,4.82,"The beer was presented in a pint glass, and looked completely perfect for the style. It was dark black colored with a thick tan head. The smell was pretty intense, with fruit and hops and chocolate and malt and more than I can pin down in words.  The flavor was the best part, with plum or raisin type fruits mixing with chocolate and some burnt malts. The liquid was not too heavy but had a coating quality.  I rated this from notes I took while having it on tap at Pizza Port in San Clemente. I've also had it in bottles twice since then and it's been really consistent. An awesome beer.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,96
147,1160,leedorham,4.78,This beer poured black like a coffee syrup and the carbonation struggled to travel to the top. It still produced a moderate head with minimal lacing.  I get the impression of wood roasted flavors from the aroma with the bitterness lurking in the background.  Wow. I like it. That is all I can say. This beer is currently going for $4 a bomber at a local market and is better by far than the Rogue IRS going for $13 in the nifty ceramic bottle. The taste is rich and complex. Not smoke. More like a bittersweet roasted flavor with burnt sugar in the background. It soothes my pallette like a gourmet coffee. I only regret not buying more. This is the best beer I have had in 6 years.,Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,96
147,1160,sinstaineddemon,4.42,"A - heart of satan black, with a coffe bean brown head, that laces within half a minute, too dark for carbonation  S - strong alcohol aroma, mixed in with the stouty goodness, the rich coffee and chocolate aromas  T - wow, tastes much better than it smells, very rich coffe flavor and very much smoother than i expected, high ABV adds some bite, but the richness of the flavor is too good to let that bother meslight licorice flavor in the background  M - damn good over all, bitter up front with a chocolate sweetness, very well balanced  D - bitter and sweet, but as i said well balanced, easy to drink, most people would love this",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,96
147,1160,doppelmeup,4.03,"Can a beer with this much hype live up to it's expectations? My quest was to find this out tonight. I bought several bombers of this on a trip to NJ, two weeks ago, but with surprising willpower held off drinking any of them until tonight. So here goes. Does it live up to the hype?  Poured this into a tulip glass. It looked like I expected. Totally black, with no light shining through. About a half inch of toffee colored head, which dissipated fairly quickly, leaving a ring around the edges. The head renewed itself each time I swirled the glass. Even as I approached the bottom of the glass, I still could not see my fingers through the beer. So far so good.  This beer didn't have as much of an aroma as I was expecting. I could smell cocoa, coffee, some sweetness and some bitterness, but nothing overpowering. It did smell good, though.  Now for the big moment, tasting this beast. Coffee, bittersweet cocoa, toffee. Not overly sweet or bitter, but you could taste both at once. Really good, but a bit on the rough side. Alcohol was fairly well hidden, but it was still apparent.  Mouthfeel: Thick, chewy, warming. Similar in texture to a doppelbock. Not too much carbonation to cut through the thickness.Warmed the throat all the way down to the stomach.  This came across as quite strong, and I don't think I could drink a lot of it in a row. I split the bomber with some friends, and my third was enough for one sitting.  Overall, this was a good beer, but I don't think it lived up to the hype. I'm skeptical that any beer could really do that, however. After all, what would you expect from the number two beer in the Beer Advocate world? But I've had a few others that I liked better, like Celebrator, for example. I think at this level, the beers are all pretty good and most is left to personal preference.  I've got two more bombers stashed away to age, so I'll be curious as to how they taste in a year or two.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,96
147,1160,Gusler,4.53,"Release 2005: The beer upon extraction the 22-ounce brown bottle sets in the glass the color of a Raven and in my opinion, thats about as dark as it gets, head is dinosauric in size, the texture creamy and the color chocolate brown, as it slowly vanishes, the lace forms a thick sheet of lace to surround the glass. Nose has a that deep burnt grain aroma that to me means Imperial Stout , hints of dark, deep roasted coffee, bittersweet chocolate, sweet and malty , the start is sweet, grain profile delightful, the top full and rich. Finish has a light to moderate acidity, hops are dynamic in their spicy bite, very dry and lingering aftertaste, definite tummy warmer this beer, another of Stones great lineup that I eagerly await each year.   Release 2004: The beer after defection from the 22-ounce brown bottle sets in the glass as black as a starless night with the head modest and frothy in size, the color that of rich chocolate, the lace a thin and clinging sheet to the glass. Nose has a deep roasted coffee and bittersweet chocolate aroma, toasted grains and a sugary sweetness, the start is rich in malt, sweet with the top as full as they get. Finish has a benign acidity, the hops majestic in their spiciness, quite dry and long lingering aftertaste and a noticeable belly warming, another great release of this magnificent beer, and to think at one time I thought it to strong; your palate does change over the years  Release 2003: The beer as it sets in my 30 plus year old Chimay Chalice, is as black as they come, the head is prodigious in size, a beauteous chocolate brown color and spumous in texture as it evaporates in the blink of an eye, the resultant lace forms a Victoria Secrets like sheet of lace See-through got to love that? Nose is dominated by the toasted grain aroma, backed up by the coffee, chocolate, and a fresh and pleasing crispness I find so appealing. Start is ambrosial, thickly malted with the top as thick as the Ice in Maine Today! Briskly acidic, hops spanking in their spiciness and the aftertaste desert bleached bone dry, and my most highly ranked Imperial, and one of my most favorite Stone Brewing Creations, which is a tie with the rest of their beers, except for that Levitation stuff, just kidding Arrogant Nipple, I mean Greg!",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,96
147,1160,Domingo,4.68,"(This is for the 2006 edition) This bottle came from Whole Foods of all places. Pours a murky black color. No light making it through this one. Probably the darkest brew I've ever encountered. Head is present and a nice brown color, too. Just the right amount of lacing. Smells of raisins, brandied cherries, MALT (note the capital letters), and a little alcohol, too. There's a little hop flavor in there, but it's masked or perhaps a milder variety of hops. Flavor is chocolate, coffee, booze, malt, and sweet fruit all rolled into one. Hops are there in the finish but are playing a back-up role. It's really balanced, which is great coming from a brewery known for hops. Possibly the maltiest beer I've ever had...which for me is exactly what I like! Mouthfeel is perfect. Just the right mix of thicknees and going down easy. Short of the ABV (which is nearly 11%), I could drink this until I have no more. An AMAZING beer worthy of all the praise given to it.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,96
147,1160,Phocion,4.67,"Wow. That's the only word I can use to describe this beer. I'm not surprised at all it's ranked #2 on this site. Went to a local liquor store after work, and they had just gotten in several cases of this stuff, so I picked up a couple for just under $5 a piece. One of the perks of living in northern San Diego County..  Poured into a Stone pint glass, this is probably the darkest beer I've seen, pure black with a dirty beige head.  Smells very sweet, coffee and chocolate.  I left this in the fridge too long tonight, I have to admit the first couple drinks were very disappointing. The only real taste I could pick up was the coffee flavor, so I decided to let it warm up for a bit. Fifteen minutes later I tried again, and this beer is incredible. The coffee is still there, and the chocolate as well. There's a definite hoppy bite, but it's not as overpowering as most Stone brews. Paired with the sweet chocolate and coffee, this is incredibly well balanced. You can taste the alcohol as well, but for nearly 11% ABV, it's surprisingly well-hidden.  As with most Russian Imperial Stouts, this is a very heavy beer. Definitely full-bodied.  Not the most drinkable beer, but for 10.8% I suppose it's not too bad. I doubt I'll have any problems finishing the bottle, but I'm pretty sure I won't want another one tonight.  I'm not much of a stout fan, but this beer might have just converted me. I'm definitely going back tomorrow and am going to try to pick up a case of this stuff. I can't think of a better after-dinner drink, and I can tell right away this would go extremely well with a nice, creamy Connecticut-wrapped cigar.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,96
147,1160,jaluria,3.62,"Appeared a viscous, opaque, black with a soft, mocha-colored head that dissipated quickly and left behind some lacing. The surface was covered in small bubbles that seemed to be immovable. Aromas of plums, dark chocolate, alcohol, and coffee. The taste was similar with the addition of bittersweet candy. Smooth with a suprisingly bitter finish. Hops were present in the background. Dry, chewy, and viscous in my mouth. Quite enjoyable, but too rich to enjoy repeatedly.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,96
147,1160,IPALOVER,4.77,"Can anyone say ""dessert?"" This beer is definitely that-- a rich, heavy, Imperial Russian stout that tastes like coffee and chocolate. Given the choice of a piece of cake, a bowl of ice cream, slice of cheesecake, or any other incredible edible dessert, I would pass them all up in favor of the Stone Imperial Russian Stout.  I liked the way the beer poured-- created a nice, creamy head, but dissipated a bit as I drank. No lace on the glass, but I don't expect that with a beer with as high an alcohol content as this one. It took me almost two hours to drink the 22 oz serving, and as the beer warmed to room temperature the flavor became more ""coffee like."" Yum.  I'm a huge fan of Stone-- I like that all of the beer they brew has an incredible hoppiness that I can taste. Although not as hoppy as their Ruination Ale, I can definitely taste hops in this beer. Just a tad of a bitter bite at the end.  Great job, Stone! I'll keep a bottle of this to age-- I bet the flavors will just get richer with time!",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,96
147,1160,cameraman,4.82,"I waited to make this my 50th review and man was it worth the wait. This beer pours black and is opaque with a small beige head forming. The aroma is amazing, chocolate and coffee scents with some currants in there as well, followed by little bit of hops. The taste is wonderful, it starts a tad bitter, then a sweet taste of chocolate comes in, ten ends with a nice clean finish, there is alot going on in this beer. The alchol is present in the flavor and the mouthfeel as well, which is more dominated by the thickness of this beer. It is almost like a syrup, it coats the palate and lingers there for sometime making you wanting more.

147,1160,sloejams,4.75,"This pours dark as night, slightly syrupy with a chocolatey slight head. It looked real nice in my Stone Imperial Russian Stout tulip glass. Yeah I'm pretty fucking rad.  The aroma is slightly subdued: expresso, roasted malt and dark chocolate. The sip is smooth and full of body. The taste is complex: the coffee, the chocolate adding a slight sweetness. A lot is going on and it's all quite pleasant. The texture is brilliant.  While there's undenying the alcohol content (at 10.80% ABV), the warmth it provides is not overbearing and it's quite drinkable. I imagine having this aged a year or two will bring out some other characteristics. Pretty damn good now too.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,96

147,1160,kdmorse,4.82,"Summer '06 Release  So much hype. So long of a wait (just arrived locally last week). So economical ($6/bottle).  A: Pitch black topped with 1-2 fingers of chocolate brown head. No lacing to speak of. Doesn't lure me in, but does intrigue me.  S: Sweet alcohol and raisins. Chocolate and coffee hints. Subtle and enjoyable, but doesn't amaze me. More than good, but not quite there yet.  T: Coffee and chocolate. Sweet and subtle. Hops seem to appear afterwards. Balanced and clean finish.  M: Creamy and full. Heavy and light all at once. Dense and thick then it disappears.  D: Wanted this to be hard to drink, but I can't put it down. Could buy a case (especially at that price) and drink it all day. +10% does not show up at all.  Notes: Once it got in my mouth, it was perfect. There was so much build up. Was it justified or overhyped? I think it was justified, but not the perfect beer yet.

147,1160,soulgrowl,3.75,"2006 release:  Appearance: Black and completely opaque. Kind of unimpressive ruddy brown head with sub-par retention. Still, this is one mean-looking brew.  Smell: Burnt sugar and burnt coffee, anise, light tamari notes, figs, hazelnuts, and peaty tannins. Subtle alcohol. Mild DMS. This doesn't seem as strong as last year's model.  Taste: The darkest chocolate, the blackest coffee, and the spiciest 151-proof rum en flambé. Rough black currant, vanilla extract, and anise. Finish is lush with chocolate and somewhat acrid. This is a rude, rude brew. I dig it, but it does not live up to the hype, in my opinion.  Mouthfeel: Lighter than anticipated but still damn thick. Pleasantly clean yet still exceptionally creamy and chewy. I wouldn't be able to tell for sure without a side-by-side comparison, but I think this is an improvement over last year's.  Drinkability: Pretty rough on the palate and the tract, but fairly savorable. Would probably benefit from some time in the cellar. I really can't believe this is the second-best beer in the world, but what do I know?  Edit: I am having trouble finishing the bomber, so down goes the drinkablity score. Honestly, people, what is with the obsession over this beer?

147,1160,ej285701,3.43,"2006 release, 22 oz bottle  Pours out thick and black from the bottle into a Chimay goblet, with a light brown half inch head.  Like the bottle says, the aroma is of anise, dark fruits, alcohol, and roastiness. However alcohol seems to be the most dominant.  Taste is similar to the smell, anise, dark fruits and alcohol. Some roastiness in there as well, but not as much as the smell. No hops to balance the sweetness. Very cloying.  Nicely cabonated and a fairly light body for an imperial stout. The carbonation is lost about half way through my glasss however.  Average drinkability. The sweetness definitely hinders this. It seems like a chore to finish the whole bottle. The 2005 release was so much better than this. It seems odd that this was the same recipe. My other two 2006 release bottles will remain in my basement for a year or two, hopefully developing some positive characteristics.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,96
147,1160,HimerMan,4.41,"22oz bottle, served in my Sam Adams Chocolate Bock glass.  One of the nicest pours I've encountered. Absolutely black, but perhaps a bit thin to the pour.  Smell was not strong at first, but the aroma of chocolate and coffee/cream peaks though, especially after the first sip.  Taste - awesome, I agree with many of the other comments - much sweeter than previous years. More so, I can barely taste the hops until the beer is about room temperature. So, colder for those who are in less favor of hops - and warmer for those who enjoy IPAs and hops. It is a win-win.  I feel this may get a bit better in time, maybe 6 months to a year, so I am reserved about rating it 5's, as I agree that should be a rare thing given.  Alcohol is not an issue with this beer, I would have guessed about 6% with this, certainly not 10.8%. They did an excellent job at not making this too strong.  Overall, absolutely worth a shot - of you find it in the stores, pick up a few. Try one, save some, try them again. Definitely worth it.  Enjoy and Cheers.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,96
147,1160,jwc215,4.85,"Poured jet black with a fairly thin, but extremely well-retained tan head. The smell was mainly of rich, roasted coffee with a touch of alcohol. It was slightly thin, but what was there was very inviting. The taste was incredible...I drank it before reading the label -which describes it perfectly - It was a complex mixture of coffee, licorice (anise), chocolate-like berries (black currants)...and a slight charcoal-like smoke malt...but, as my roommate (who had the good fortune of sharing it with me) pointed out - each one was like a different level. It was like eating a rich layer cake. You could taste the different levels individually. The mouthfeel was silky smooth. Perfect. The drinkability...well, if it weren't for a budget and alcohol-content - I could drink it endlessly... This is a beautiful beer...

147,1160,ChainGangGuy,4.77,"(2005 Vintage)  Appearance: Oh my, yes. Pours out a rich, inticing jet black body. The foamy tan-colored head recedes quickly.  Smell: The welcome aroma delivers a sweet scent filled with rich espresso, roasted barley, molasses, and anise. A soft scent of port wine can also be found here. Lastly, an inspiriting alcohol vapor fills the nose.  Taste: While tasting this beer I scribbled some complimentary notes down on a notepad, but didn't get all of them because I went through the world's entire supply of ink and paper in the process.  The world's entire supply of ink and paper, I said.  That said, this brew is tremendously malty, with sharp notes of coffee and chocolate. Undertones of vanilla and molasses are present as well. Hop flavor is gentle, barely peeking through the immense gamut of flavors present. Yes, the alcohol is apparent, but quite soothing.  The long finish leaves a sustaining roasted flavor on the tongue. Delicious.  Mouthfeel: Full-bodied and quite chewy at times, while maintaining an unequaled velvety texture.  Drinkability: The very best RIS I've tasted yet.  So, yeah, I liked it. I had very high expectations for this beer, and it met every single one of them.  Thankfully.

Good retention. Lacing is somewhat shy.  Smell: Chocolatey malts, currants, spice, and alcohol. A spot medicinal in the nose. Not the beer's best attribute.  Taste: Sumptuous chocolate, roasted malts, and oh those currants. If it weren't written on the bottle, I would have never put my finger on that taste. Caramel and sugar, and perhaps some vanilla. Superb flavor.  Mouthfeel: Intensely creamy and warming. Robustly full body, and a tinge of carbonation. Quite luxurious on the tongue.  Drinkability: Rather addicting really. Delicious flavor leaves one yearning for more.

Protruding out of this black liquid comes tastes of dark chocolate, coffee (no sugar or cream thanks), toffee with a splash of caramel. A bit of hops creep up on you, but are pushed back by the onslaught of malts which ends with some roasted nuts and toast.  Mouthfeel: Absolutly one of the smoothest beers I've ever had. Slight carbonation, slicked from the slight levels of hops which seem to have a greater effect on the mouthfeel than the taste palate.

But of course I had to crack one open now.  I figure the Duvel tulip would be a good outlet for tasting this sucker, so here we go.  Appearance: Blacker than the back of your eyelids. Yes, this is as opaque as can be. I recently washed the glass before I poured it in, so there's not much lacing and not much head, but I'm giving it a 4 on the account of the fact that it has to be the glass. I need to make it a point to never do this again.  Smell: Even green this is awesome. Lots of dark, rich, unsweetened chocolate, tons of malt and the tinge of bittering and curbing hops to quell it all. There's some mocha, some fresh ground coffee beans, a bit of black licorice, some dark dark cherries and fruit, and the slightest amount of anise. I don't get the toasted and burnt feel of the malt as much, though--could it be the hops that are making this so?  Taste: Smooth, really smooth--tons of malt, chocolate, the oh-so-nice-amount of bitterning hops, and finally some burnt and toasted malt characteristics. Finishes with notes of raisins, toffee, slight vanilla, dark fruit, unsweetened and strong chocolate, and, once again, the lingering presence of the hops to sustain its longevity. I can't imagine this later down the road. Green's my new favorite color, ya'll.  Mouthfeel: Hugely thick and coating with the carbonation levels high when they need to be high, though they're the back-up singers, so to speak, in the mix. This does nothing but contribute to the finish. Silktastic.  Drinkability: Yes, I'll have another. My advice is drink one now and save a bunch for later. On the bottle they suggest a case! That's why I love Stone. They know what they're about, and if I had the funds right now I would snag one in an instant.

147,1160,cheers2beers,4.88,"Served into a snifter:  Appearance: This stout pours a deep dark black liquid with possibly the darkest creamy looking head that I have ever put eyes on. As I swirl this fine beer in my glass I notice the syrupy legs running down ever so slowly, Leaveing behind minimal laceing.  Smell: The aromas are woody, a sweetened chocolately coffee bean malt, a vague trace of soy sauce, a touch of cherries, some bready and/or doughy notes as well. All of these combine to create a most superb scent. Not much hops in the nose, but I can definitely detect an alcohol presence. Very nice aromas indeed!  Taste: The flavors are absolutely stunning. Very much like the nose the flavors consist of milk and dark chocolate, cafe latte coffee with a hint of vanilla extract, a quaffable alcohol sweetness that makes this beer very smooth. It has the bready notes as well as a nice roastiness that seems to balance everything to become one. Oh yea, did I mention that this beer is balanced, wow!  Mouthfeel: Smooth and silky redefined! The alcohol helps to make this not so thick as it is satiny smooth. Just a pleasure to drink. Its like thin motor oil. A full mouthfeel that is on the leaner side of heavy with a carbonation that is really not detected aside from the wonderful head.  Drinkability: The high abv % does not hurt the drinkability at all. In fact, im in a very pleasant if not giddy mood now. This is just about as close as you can get to a perfect Imperial stout.

Had a fusal hops, with chocolate and coffee. Very nice aroma. The flavor was more of the same with lots of chocolate and coffee. A very sweet almost like molasses.

Smells of soy, beef jerky, dates, and apricots. Not sure where this soy/teriyaki smell is coming from, but it's pretty distinct.  Tastes of plums, rum, cinnamon, sourdough, and a hint of soy sauce (again with that element, it's almost distracting).  Mouthfeel is big, bold, and a warming alcohol finish. Just enough carbonation to keep this heavy, heavy syrup from becoming a fork-and-knife event.  With the alcohol, and the persistant aftertaste of soy sauce, I really think last year's batch was much easier to drink, which is really too bad.

Smell: It even smelled like a good coffee, with some sprinkles of lake champlain Tanzanian dark chocolate. Piney hop effluves slowly creeped up and alcohol in the finale was and soothing.  Taste: Surprisingly smooth at first, the hop astringency gradually comes along in the end, making a kind of wave that's creamy, then just a bit sweet, then bitter and warm from the alcohol. I wouldn't drink tons of this stuff, but when I have a feel for a RIS I wouldn't mind having some of this.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,96
147,1160,BradBLR,3.84,"2006  I bought a couple of bottles of this because I am a Stone fan more than I am a fan of stouts. When I first poured this into my glass I was blown away. It was as dark as old used motor oil and the head was a dark chocolatey brown color. I actually took it outside and held it up to the sun and I could not see through it... cool!  The smell was not overpowering, but a nice chocoalte coffee aroma. The taste was good, I was not blown away maybe because I am not a fan of stouts. But this was by far the best stout I have ever had and it had nice very balaced hoppy flavor. The after taste was a nice malty flavor that diappeared quickly. The one think I noticed was the lack of the flavor of alcohol, it a beer that is 10.8% you should taste some alcohol, but I did not really taste it. The mouthfeel was good, nice and thick and it coated you mouth well.  Overall a really interesting beer that I enjoyed. I think was made this beer really unique is the fact that it is so new and already balanced really well without the taste of alcohol... Give it a try if you get a chance.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,96
147,1160,wedge,4.3,"2006  Dense, jet black color with a thin brown head - nice lacing at first but more of a slick coating as it warms. Rich aroma of roasted chocolate malts, complex vinous fruits, sweetened coffee, and alcohol. Thick, intense flavor - rich malts, charred grains, and dark fruits. The alcohol is clearly evident but not a problem - nicely warming on the throat. This is thick viscous stuff, oh yes...lusciously smooth and warm.  This could most likely chill in the cellar for a while to bring out the best of it, but it is pretty damn complex as it is now. Obviously a big, serious brew; one bomber's probably enough for one sitting. A rather tasty stout though, if I may say so myself, but it can only get better after sitting around a while...",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,96
147,1160,tastybeer,4.75,"2006 As black as it gets, with an inviting warm brown head. Ring forms for the duration and leaves bits of lace about the glass. Aroma of sweet roasted caramel, espresso, burnt black fruits, and extra dark bittersweet chocolate. Taste is loaded with constant luscious awesome. Burnt roasted coffee bean, velvety cocoa, sun ripened raisons, cherries, rasberries, plums, black grapes, and the list goes on. Hop character peels through the density giving an added variety to the sea of dark beery goodness. Mouthfeel is thick like a heavy cashmere winter blanket. Viscous feel as it moves slow motion around your mouth. An oh so long finish coats your mouth. The rich juicy charred fruits and espresso flavor is constant throughout the session. After one sip I wonder if my mouth will ever feel dry or empty again. Drinkability is smooth and easy especially for such a complex, thick, and high alcohol beer.

147,1160,artusory,3.78,"2006 bottle. Pours jet black with a small, creamy, tan head. Quickly fading, no lacing. The aroma is very sweet - golden grapes, chocolates and figs. Overall, the nose is suprisingly mellow for a monster Imperial Stout. Flavor is also very sweet - lots of dark fruit, chocolate, molases, becoming bitter and roasted at the end when some coffee and dark chocolates come in. Finish is long, sweet and slightly bitter with a heavy dose of warm alcohol. The mouthfeel is big, rich, creamy and coating.

147,1160,mattpetti,4.52,"2006 spring release...  Pours an absolutely pitch black with good sized head. Very cloying to the sides of my glass. This looks to be a thick one.  Smell is of roasted malts dark ripe fruits, mocha, some chocolate, maybe ever alittle smokiness. A wonderful smell. There is alcohol too which is very apparent, but for some reason isn't harsh.  The taste was up front solid, roasted, malts which was backed by wine like cassis and coffee flavors. The final hit is of smoke and a lingering alcohol kick. Very complex.  The overall mouthfeel was good. It was alittle too astringent for my taste , but its what i expect a russian imperial stout should be like. The only thing i didn't like was how the acidity seemed to become more powerful as i drank more of the beer. Also for some reason this beer was not as fullbodied as i expected from such a dark beer.  Overall you can def down more than one of these beers easily. If you love RIS's then this is the beer for you without a doubt. Also i think with age this beer will be unstoppable. I'll try and review one again months from now and see if i can tell the difference.  Drunk Responcibly;) -Matt",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,96
147,1160,daliandragon,4.35,"Ah, a bomber of quality Imperial Russian stout, indeed a pretty sight. At least as good as a jug of sack, but slightly easier to find for us if not Falstaff. That said, I wish more places near me brought Stone to the table. Usually I have to go Brooklyn for it, as in this case. This is a 220z of the 2004 limited early summer release and has some comical Russian themed randomness on the bottle. Color is black as night. The beer has no head as it pours, develops one after and it slowly dissolves back to nothing like a perfect circle. The color is pure jet black with tannish lacing and head scraps. Nose is pure coffee malt on overdrive with pine, sugar, and dairy. Alcohol dances lightly in the backround. This is an attractive beer. Coffee and malt sugar combine in a flavorful but not overwhelming taste with an almost eternal aftertaste. The alcohol is present but understated for the size. Mouthfeel is good but not perfect. Definitely more bitter than many stouts of similar size and reputation. This isn't quite the greatest stout I've ever had but I will definitely be looking for it again soon.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,96

S: Full aromas of chocolate, anise, and alcohol.  T: More hop presence than last year's (as I remember) with some typical chocolate and coffee flavors attempting to sneak through but covered by strong alcoholic and metallic tastes. This one needs to wait a bit.  M: Thick and creamy with light-moderate carbonation.  D: Last year's edition was the best beer that I've ever had to date, and this year's was a bit of a dissapointment to me. This is still one of the best beers out there, but not as good as I remember.

147,1160,instrumentality,4.43,"This bottle came from the ""Limited Spring 2006 Release."" I received it as a gift for my 30th birthday party, and what a gift it turned out to be.  This one practically oozed out of the bottle: a thick, black, hearty beverage with a thin layer of brown foam that quickly settled and left a shallow pool of carbonation in its wake.  The odor was a mix of coffee, caramel, and cherries.  One sip and I thought to myself, ""Good god this is tasty."" The coffee flavor came through immediately, but heavy, almost like tar, yet not overpowering. This was followed by a mildly bitter sweetness akin to some red wines. The alcohol is also clearly present but not overpowering. Aftertaste is mainly coffee with a splash of caramel.  I held a gulp in my mouth and could feel the tingling of carbonation, but other than that the drink is soothing on the palate, with no burning alcohol sensation.  I'm not that familiar with imperial Russian stouts, and I bought this one with a skeptical mind despite all the hype, thinking it might be a little too winey for me, but it's nice. I'm taking it slowly, but I could easily see myself making short work of this treat if I wasn't consciously pacing myself. And at almost 11% ABV, I think it would be wise to give this one time.  The best part is, it's still a very young beer, and I'm fully prepared to follow the advice on the bottle:  ""We recommend getting a case and opening a bottle every three to six months to best enjoy its journey.""  I love Stone as it is, but this beer is on another level.  I've just poured the remaining contents of the bottle. My glass is literally hissing at me. Or is it the gargoyle on the bottle? Stone doesn't mess around.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,96
147,1160,Bleedingshrimp,4.22,"Poured from a bomber into a tulip. This brew poured the darkest black wherein no light permeated. Nice chocoalte milkshake head that fades quick but leaves the tiniest layer throughout. Smells strong of alcohol and cinnamon with notes of plum and pomegranate. Taste is sweet with notes of coffee. The gentle hops play off the moderate vinous taste. Alcohol is clearly present but is overwhelmed by a nice complexity. As it warms, green apple and vanilla notes make their prescence known. A giant among beers. Mouthfeel is chewy and creamy. Drinkability is hindered because the alcohol does play prominently in taste. Overall, a big complex beer that leaves you with a warmth and a sense of what went into its creation.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,96
147,1160,Lnedrive14,4.58,"2004 Bottle purchased at American Beer Distributing Company in Brooklyn (felt pretty lucky to come across this gem). Not sure how well it was stored, so was a bit worried when I cracked it open. Wish I had done it with a vertical, but oh well - will have to compare based on memory.  A: Pours a jet black with a thick tan head. Very pretty.  S/T: Big hop presence. Certainly not overwhelming though, as the roasted malts and chocolate/vanilla swirl flavors compensate quite nicely. It wasnt till the last 6-8 oz. or so of the bomber that the alcohol presence started to make itself known (I think it tasted better without it).  M/D: Strangely, I felt the brew was much more carbonated than the last sample I had had. Swirling it in my mouth didn't leave the sticky chewiness that I expected - slightly less full-bodied. Drinkability was very high at the beginning, but as I said, the alcohol started to come across at the end (as I began to get a bit intoxicated).  Fantastic brew overall. I think the aging worked well - though not to such a drastic effect as I had anticipated. I would say that at most it was a bit more subdued. Not sure if hte increased carbonation was a part of it (I would have expected the opposite).",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,96
147,1160,sponberg,4.28,"2005 edition, stored cold over the past 9 months.  Pours absolutely opaque with a dark tan head. There's some serious dark malt in this baby. Aroma of dark toffee, faint chocolate, dark toasty malt )almost pumpernickel, maybe brown bread) and alcohol.  Who needs dinner? Hugely chewy - starts with a brown bread toastiness then all malt hell breaks loose. Vast flavor - between the bittering hops and roasted malt, those taste buds are happy, and in the meantime the rest of the brew goes to work with dark, fruity maltiness and a serious warming surge of alcohol to accompany. Finished with a long, lasting alcoholic vapor and bittersweet dark malt. Huge. And hugely enjoyable.  Given the strength two would be plenty - but many other brews of this heft (I smoked a pork shoulder with less meatiness) would have me shouting ""No mas!"" after one bottle. Damned fine brew.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,96
147,1160,TheBungyo,4.33,"Just as a driver's ed teacher would say ""the car is not a toy"" a wise beer drinker might say the same of this beer. Yank off the cap, and gaze in wonder as the glass slowly fills with magnificent ebony liquid. This liquid is so dark that the head looks more like the froth on top of a chocolate milk shake. Nose seems restrained to me. I get loads of choclate and espresso. Taste starts off with sweet chocolate syrup, giving way to cocoa and then coffee. Finish is like your mouth after swallowing a mocha. I suppose I would have liked a tad more bitterness. Now the mouthfeel is where this beer shines like a spotlight. It coats the mouth like an oil spill. The carbonation is like a fragile work of art. Delicately spilling over the tongue and the rest of the mouth. If I had the means I would be happy to drink this whenever I craved a stout. The reputation is well deserved.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,96
147,1160,maddamish,4.9,"Highlights:  Taste: Like most stouts, this one is best consumed just under room temp. I made the mistake of chilling it in the fridge for 3 hours. When I first tasted this stout I was unimpressed. But the more it warmed up the more it showed it's true character. Chocolate, coffee and dark malts swirl together to give this beer depth. This is the sort of beer you just sit back and contemplate.  Ap: This stout is as thick as they come. Pitch black and as dark and syrupy as used motor oil. The head was thick and creamy.  Thoughts: This is just as good as the Victory Storm King Stout in all categories except taste. But This is not a 4.5 beer in the taste department so I deducted .5 from the drinkability score. I think storm king has a little more going on in the taste department but that is not to slam this great. beer. But there can only be one top stout and this one makes a good case for that title.

147,1160,TheManiacalOne,4.53,"2006 release poured from a 22oz. bottle into a pint glass.  A: The beer is a deep brownish black, with a thick brown head that fades slowly and leaves a thick lace on the glass.  S: It has a rich coffee roast & dark chocolate aroma with a little bit of hops & alcohol. The smell has a robust quality to it that lets you know right away that this beer doesn’t mess around.  T: The taste is an excellently balanced, rich flavor of coffee & chocolate, roasted malt and a touch of hops. As Stone does so well, it’s not overly sweet, but not bitter and STILL masks the 10.80% ABV.  M: Full-bodied, extremely smooth, medium carbonation, leaves a clean finish without any syrupy or oily residue which I would attribute to the fact that the sweetness isn’t excessive.  D: This beer is treacherously drinkable because it’s so smooth & tasty and the ABV is well hidden in the taste. It also is not filling unlike other stouts that I’ve had. Given all of that, this beer can do some heavy damage if you go with it for some time. Unfortunately for me, I won’t be able to test myself beyond the one bomber that I had.  This is an excellent beer. I know that by the time I make it back to the store where I got this beer, it will all be gone. While I consider myself lucky to have gotten the beer, I’m cursing myself for not buying more of it.

147,1160,scottoale,4.25,"Limited spring 2006 release pours from the STD.Stone 22oz. bomber a rather thick, black-licorice with a cocoa brown inch of foamy head. Very stout indeed.

Initially sweet, strong , black malt of a coffee flavor loads the tastebuds. Powerful, almost puckering rich, toasty (almost burnt) flavor that doesn't quite know when to quit...astonishing complexity. When you finally do find the time to swallow this amazing elixer, it goes down, ever so smooth and warming, with the pefectly bitter balance of a finish. A lingering, gourmet coffee like aftertaste that satisfies, yet makes the taste senses yearn for more...and more...and...

The taste is rather dry, and mostly like coffee, with chocolate undertones. Moderately bitter, the alcohol taste is slight, but becomes strong over time. Thick mouthfeel, but smooth and slick feeling.

147,1160,UberWasser,5,"22oz brown bomber served, bit by bit, in a snifter. 2006 Vintage.  I usually say that a beer ""pours"" from the bottle...but that is an understatement for a beer of this magnitude. I would say that this beer...well, disembogues from the bottle as thick Russian crude oil would from a pipeline. Coming to rest in the glass, it sits thicker and blacker than any beer I have laid eyes upon...the minimal head is a dark coffee color. As it sits in my snifter, it actually bubbles and churns as would the brew in a witch's cauldron. I'm almost afraid to take a sip.  So, for the moment, I take a sniff instead. Holy moly. Coffee, dark chocolate, prunes, molasses, brown sugar, bread dough, some earthy tones, a clean sweetness and slight but sharp background alcohol scent...it actually tingles the inside of my nose when I take a deep sniff.  How can I refuse a sip after this nasal fiesta? The first thing that rushes across my tongue is a rich creamy sweetness, which is rapidly followed by a building of molasses and semi-sweet chocolate bitter sweetness on the middle tongue. As the beer settles across the back of the tongue an intense coffee and dark chocolate bitterness flows forward to envelope the palate and rises upwards to fill the nose. Upon swallow, a slow and long lasting alcohol warmth fills the throat and the bitterness rolls back to a semi-bitter dark chocolate that plays with the back of the tongue for many minutes. The mouthfeel of this beer is thick and syrupy, with just enough tingle of carbonation, both of which do nothing but accentuate the flavors.  All in all...easily the best Imperial Stout I have ever had. The best beer ever? Well, I do like a balanced brew, and on that end this could use some cellar time to mellow, but honestly, I also love a big, in your face brew from time to time, and I have never, ever, never, ever had a brew this big and in your face. I loved every sip of it and would open more, if I weren't saving it for future tasting.

First smell it had a coffee aroma. However, what stood out to me the most was the fruity smell to it. As it warmed the beer started to give off a pleasant alcohol scent.  Now comes the first drink, oh wow I was dearly thrown from the chair it was such a big complex taste. It tasted very nicely of malts. Sorry but words excape me right now. All I have to say about taste is one must try this beer.  When the beer enters your mouth the first thing you notice is how thick and syrupy it is. It comes in a just coats your mouth. On the way down your throat it gives off a nice alcohol warming feeling. This is a beer to be taken slowly and to let it warm so one can pick apart all the flavors.

147,1160,phishgator,3.83,"This poured into a snifter. The dark choclate/black color produced a rether big tan head. The aroma is the common roated coffee beans and then some spicy (hop?) aroma. The taste is bitter up front and a little astringent in the end. There is coffee, bitter sweet choclate, and a little plum twist. The astringence detracts from the mouthfeel and the drinkability.

I tend to be a little bit critical (compared to the rest of BA) of Stone beers, but this is, in my opinion, one of the best beers, and the very best stout, in the world. This is US beer experimentation at its best. It takes a style that is traditionally pretty easy-drinking, because of the lack of bitterness, and makes it in-your-face. This beer is very malty, with strong notes of semi-sweet dark chocolate, plus some coffee. But, it also has a stong bitterness (without an overt hoppiness) that defines the finish.

Smelled predominantly of roasted coffee in addition to a slight fruitiness. Just by smell, it is easy to tell that there is a lot of alcohol in this beer.  Head maybe about half a centimeter; though it wasn't an aggressive pour.  Taste is chocolatey and fruity, but finishes off bitter, like French roast coffee. Very balanced, as no one flavor really sticks out. Flavors get more complex as it warms, though retaining its balance.  Halfway through, I'm a little tipsy.  Great mouthfeel, but not as ""chewy"" as, say, an Alesmith Speedway Stout. Thick, and almost syrupy. Very smooth. Doesn't feel like a ""chore"" to drink sometimes, as with the aforementioned beer.

147,1160,biegaman,4.45,"Stone Russian Imperial Stout looks every bit as crude as Siberian oil. It's black and opaque regardless of the angle it's observed at and no light no matter how strong can change that fact. It's like the ocean in the middle of the night in the middle of winter. Its head is a wicked brown shade, thick and coloured like a mound of chocolate mousse.  Chunks of melted bittersweet chocolate, a generous splash of coffee, fortified dark fruits, more than one vanilla pod and maybe a dash of sherry are decadent and alluring enough that I keep my nose literally pressed right up against the rim of the glass (any lower and I'd be half way to drowning myself). Warming is most welcomed.  Of all the Imperial Stouts I regularly revisit, Stone's has probably become the most familiar to me. Its intensely tar-y flavour is thick as home insulation and its leafy bitterness can be quite aggressive when fresh. But specifically, it's the flavours of black tea and tobacco leaf and the smoky, singed cedar wood overtone that I find so distinguishable.  This Spring 2008 release is now over two and a half years old and doesn't exactly brim youthfulness. Its flavours are slightly oxidized and seem to be coming under fire of a lactic-type sourness. Both the sweetness and bitterness have begun drying out and leave the mouthfeel with a raw, drying, unfurnished feel that's a little like licking dry rope.  Despite that Stone's beers are arguably the most prototypical examples of American craft brewing, their RIS is actually much closer to the traditional, modest, English-style model than virtually any other American rendition I can think of. It is not belligerently strong and its flavour profile (dark fruits, anise, cold coffee) is neither obnoxious nor excessive.  Correspondingly, this lends itself to a much quieter and much more gracious drinkability. While some US Imperial Stouts command the world's attention be on them and are so bold so as to provoke standing, shouting grunts of ""U-S-A, U-S-A"", this one invites a fireplace, or a good book, or a hearty meal, or a game of cards, or silent, solitary, discerning and high-minded reflection on things much bigger than the beer itself.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,96

It poured out like coffee syrup with a scent so intense I swear smelled soy sauce. The head was thick and nearly as black as the beer. The feel was creamy soft. The taste...oh my...so many favors danced on my tongue, I'm not good enough a writer to express them all in words...",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,96
147,1160,jhammerly,4.28,"2005 Release. Served in the proper glassware, a Stone Imperial Russian Stout goblet. The bottle states, ""Expect our version of this mysterious brew to pour like Siberian crude..."", this is an understatement as far as appearances go. Thick, blackness that formed a frothy, tannish head that disappeared rather quickly to nothingness. As the glass sits upon my desk, I can see my reflection in the still liquid pool like black lacquer.  The smell of sweet, alcoholic roastiness mixed with what I can only imagine is the anise. I am unsure of the aroma of anise, and even the taste for that matter. Or is it the currants?  Taste is how it smells, but only more powerful. The alcohol really stands out as it warms up. Not very thick, which is surprising. This is a very drinkable beer, especially for this style. Sits on top of my list of favorites for this style.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,96
147,1160,TheLongBeachBum,4.85,"** Early Summer 2004 Release ** Stone Imperial Stout, 10.8% Sampled ~18 Months Old  Presentation: Classic silver and blue screen printed bottle. Has the added Russian moniker over and above the Imperial Stout title of the previous 2 years samples which I have in my cellar. The reverse wording on this years bottling is rather funny and heavily slanted toward the Russian labeling.  Appearance: Incredibly dark on the pour, jet black with little in the way of forgiveness to oncoming light, its all absorbed. Yet held to a powerful light, the edges reveal a thick black molasses composition which glimmers with a dark brown Marmite consistency, the high alcohol rolls down the sides of my Stone IRS Goblet with a resilient viscosity long after the color leaves. Relatively low conditioning but a firm brown coca head forms on the pour, yet it settles down to a thick bubbly halo ring with a thin spiraling milky way covering. Minimal lacing, only the odd bubble remains trapped in the thick heavy coating after a gentle swirl.  Nose: Oh yes, this is the real deal. As soon as the cap was off that feint but very familiar odor of currants, warm raisins and dark sinful fruits filled the air. Deeper inhalations picks up a big contribution from the alcohol, roasted Turkish coffee beans and rich thick coffee cream liqueurs wrapped in a thick bitter Austrian dark chocolate.  Taste: This is soooo smooth. Rich, thick, luscious and intensely packed with all the flavors associated with the great Imperial Russian Stouts. Garibaldi biscuits thick with pressed currants, plums and some date like sweetness. Malt soaked molasses contribute wealth of luxury to the body, sharp blackcurrant in the back third and a mature port-like alcohol wraps up the finish with a lip-licking feeling of self-satisfaction.  Mouthfeel: At a year old this is damn silky, smooth yet thick with a little toffee on the tongue, soft and chewy but it still has a stiff alcoholic backbone. Sit back and sink into this treat, it will break your fall.  Drinkability: Tremendously dangerous, a Five Star Sinner. It should be a sipper but I could happily quaff this to my hearts content or until my Liver gives out.  Overall: Last night I came across a lost Review for a 2003 Bottle of Stone Imperial Stout, and it inspired me to immediately pop a bottle of my 2004 IRS stash into the Fridge and gave it a day to cool off. I just added the 2003 Review which is a year old, and seemingly following my own advice in that Review, so is this bottle of 2004 Imperial Russian Stout. I have to say that I still hold firm that this brew is best enjoyed with about 12 months under its belt. An utterly brilliant creation and definitely one of Stones premier offerings. It cant be long before the 2006 Release appears, heck, this 2004 bottle still has a $3.49 price sticker on itbarrr-gain. Each Bomber is worth twice that coin in my book.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,96
147,1160,Phyl21ca,3.86,"Bottle(room temp  July 2005 release): Poured a pitch-black color stout with a bid foamy dark brown head with pretty good retention. Aroma of roasted malt with some coffee. Roasted caramel malt are easy to distinguish with some very easily distinguishable coffee. I was expecting a bit more complexity (liquorice, chocolate, plums) or even more hops. Body was quite full and alcohol was well hidden. Overall, this is a very good imperial stout but I was expecting a bit more complexity and I still have to say that I would drink Expedition over this any day.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,96
147,1160,tattooedtolley,4.7,"22oz bomber  Appearance: Pours solid black, one of the blackest I have ever seen. A dark brown head settled quickly.  Smell: Awesome roasted malt aroma. Sweet with a slight fruity smell. Very inviting aroma, it's easy to tell that this beer will have tons of taste.  Taste: All the sweetness seems to be up front and levels out with the roasted flavor of malts, some coffee, and a bit of chocolate. I was suprised by the amount of carbonation in this imperial stout, it was more than I had thought it would be, which to me is excellent and gives it a bit of crispness. I made the big mistake of tasting this beer soon after taking it out of the fridge, big mistake. The flavors kind of ran amuk and at first I was put off by it but I knew it was too cold and I allowed it to sit for a bit. Once I came back to it, this beers flavor was incredible. I am a fan of imperial stout and I must say this is the best one I have ever had.  Mouthfeel: Very thick and syrupy.  Drinkability: I will most likely not drink this beer again so early in the day. I would rather save it as an after dinner drink or a dinner. I could have put down another bomber but I began feeling all that alcohol sneaking up on me, the alcohol is not very noticable while drinking but afterwards you can sure feel it.  Not much to say other than if you like the style go buy this beer. I got mine for $6, to me that is a super impressive deal for this awesome beer.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,96
147,1160,Crosling,3.28,"Opaque. Black. Gentle aroma of rich malts, providing chocolate, coffee and roasted notes accompanied by a thick resiny hop leaf and scents of dark fruits, vanilla and brandy. Intense raisin, black licorice, molasses and brandy character ending with a huge dose of anise and a hint of chocolate and coffee. All, somewhat put together by a well hopped profile and a cunning bitterness. Its a nice beer, no doubt, but to me, its too hoppy and its a little to fruity, thin and sweet. After about 8 months in the bottle, after its allowed to mellow, its a 4+ for sure.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,96
147,1160,kpantz,4.08,"Executive Summary: A hefty, hefty stout that requires planning to drink - quite the gastric investment, but well worth it!  Appearance: Pours a devilishly opaque deep brown/black into my snifter, with a mocha colored head that retains fairly well. Lacing is good, but not too resilient.  Smell: Raisin, plum, alcohol, deep malt all mix together to portend a fantastic flavor.  Taste: Exactly what I like in a stout. Deep roasted malt flavors, with a bit of hop character to balance. Chocolate and coffee flavors bounce around, and I swear I sense cherries. Warming alcohol flavor as well - this is a hell of a brew to cozy up with after a cold dog-walk.  Mouthfeel: Perfect for the style. Thick, without being too sticky. Really embraces the mouth and the tongue, immersing you in the deep texture.  Drinkability: This is where I knock it down a bit. Not because it's high in alcohol (though it is), but more because it's just such a strong, aggressively flavored stout. There are far more drinkable imperial stouts (Victory Storm King, Samuel Smith, Weyerbacher Old Heathen/Heresy) - this one is just so bold that I can only down one bomber without either switching to something else or stopping altogether.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,96
147,1160,assurbanipaul,4.37,"Pours an opaque black with a thin, dark khaki head that settles to a ring almost immediately. Aroma is strong and rich with notes of sweet macerated fruit (prunes?) and a dark vinous quality.  Taste is sinfully rich and sweet. Tons of roasted malt, black patent, bakers' cocoa, molasses, coffee and espresso flavors. Hop flavors early, adding a fruity little bitter heat to the otherwise malt-heavy profile. Finish is slightly to the sweet side, some burnt sugars in the aftertaste, although the alcohol is well-hidden. Turns a little more bitter as it warms, a little more acidic.  Mouthfeel is thick, quite viscous, but remains drinkable. Impression is of a very, very strong, alcoholic espresso (which ain't bad at all). Some cocoa flavors in this beer would pair very well with dark chocolate. It's not a Dark Lord-type of evil, but don't leave it alone with your grandmother.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,96
147,1160,kirok1999,4.18,"My first perfect rating. Because it simply is perfection in a glass. This 22oz was from summer of 05 yet still simply the best.  Appearance- Black with a caramel head nicely lacing the glass.  Smell- Great coffee smell, cherries or currants or both, sweet roasted malt and alcohol.  Taste- Sweet cherries as first then warms with the alcohol and chocolate. Enough hops to balance the brew, good carbonation and the sweetness dominates till the tingly finish. There is so much going on here it is hard to believe. My god, this is just too good.  Mouthfeel- Thick and oily, chewy and clingy.  Drinkability- The 22oz was gone way too quickly. Not sure I would want 2 of them as the abv is pretty high, but the incredible taste makes me want to try.  Re-reviewed on 3-6-07 and had to knock it down a few notches due to some much better stouts reviewed since. It's still a massive brew worthy of it lofty rating, just not the perfect 5 I gave it on first review.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,96
147,1160,LPorter33,3.41,"Purchased 22oz Bomber of limited early 2005 release from Bauer Wine & Spirits (Thanks, Nick!). I bought this many months ago and had it sitting in my fridge for awhile. I was waiting for the perfect moment and person to share it with, and just happened to get a random guest drop by tonight, so out came the bottle opener, in my desire to intoxicate her by my charm, i.e. get her drunk. So here goes....  Appearance = Thick and black as the darkest night. Liquid seems extremely dense and heavy. Very little carbonation and head which surprised me. Looks like Texas tea.  Smell = Dark, toasted malt with hints of really bitter baking chocolate. A bit of tanginess and sourness I'm guessing from the hops. Smells lighter than expected in the alcohol department. I was imagining a stronger presence of overpowering fumes.  Taste = Sweet, powerful and full of intense alcohol like flavors. This is a very well blended beer with the syrupy sweetness coming in nicely. It's just a bit too overwhelming for my taste buds. I can appreciate this beer and realize it's quite well made but it's not my ideal. It did go very well with a strawberry yogurt Zone Perfect bar though.  Mouthfeel = really thick and coating. I enjoyed the way it warmed the inside of my mouth. Like getting a massage for your gums.  Drinkability = I wouldn't be able to have more than a 1/2 bottle of a 1/2 bottle shared. It's just too overpowering. I think I need more food to compliment this beer, like a calzone from Bova's Bakery.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,96
147,1160,stewart124,4.47,"This beer has a midnight black color that cannot be seen through and it is topped by a thick brown head. As soon as I poured this there were huge amounts of malt in the nose. Coffee and anise are also present in the smell. The taste is extremely strong. Body is syrupy with a huge silky feel. Alcohol is very present in this beer. My tastebuds are screaming for mercy. Black currants are present along with tons of roasted malts and coffee tastes. Very soothing taste and like the bottle says ""sinful"". I don't think I could drink anything else after this one as everything would be uncomparable. Really strong after taste of malts and hops not to mention the alcohol. Another masterpiece by Stone.  2008 bottle reviewed 2/16/13 Same expected color with just a hint of the tan head.  Pungent nose but without a hop bitterness. Strong stone fruits in the nose. Some oak and vanilla notes.  Smooth and a little less carbonation or body. More syrupy than I remember. Plenty more caramel and dark candied fruits. Some lingering bitterness at the finish. Alcohol is still obviously present but at first it drinks so easily. Half way through this starts to catch up with me.  Still a great Russian imperial stout. I believe I need to set aside another few of these for 5 years.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,96
147,1160,timtheenchanta,4.48,"Jet black spent oil color. Little head with little retention. Slight webby lacing. Roasted coffee smell with some alcohol smell bleeding through. Smooth thick feel with huge coffee taste and alcohol bite. Alcohol comes through heavy in the finish. Oddly enough, doesn't have warming feel as much as a cooling effect on the throat. Great RIS. Thanks to BeerBeing for this one.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,96
147,1160,beermanbrian,4.09,"Black color with very small tan head. Was expecting a much larger more prominent head. Smell of cherries and plums, slight alcohol note that becomes more prominent as you drink, chocolate, coffee. It's all in there, everything you would expect from a IS. The coffee flavor stands out the most to me in the taste. Mouthfeel is actually a little thinner than i would have expected. Overall this is definitely an above average beer but it didn't quite live up to my expectations. Maybe I was hoping for too much but it just didn't blow my socks off.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,96
147,1160,warriorsoul,4.25,"Late Spring '03 release...picked this one up the first time I went to a Stone tasting at Colonial in Acton and met the man they call Grover. Pours a deep, dark black with absolutely no light passing thru...agressive pour produces a full finger of tan colored head and some decent lacing sticks around. Smell is inviting...cocoa powder, vanilla, sweet malt and no sense of alcohol. The taste is where it shines...huge dark chocolate profile, a balanced sweetness, just the slightest coffee presence and a subtle bitter finish. The alcohol is very well hidden and the finish is clean. Mouthfeel is quite thick and the carbonation is right on for the style. I have one more of these and believe I will crack that one open soon too...will try it with this past years release just for comparison. Thanks to Stone for another winner.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,96
147,1160,JoeyHotrod,4.97,"Wow Wow Wow!  I knew I was in for a treat from the start. If the raves this beer gets weren't enough to convince me, all it took was a single solitary look.  The apperance is something to behold indeed. Think of the blackest black you've ever seen... and from there think even blacker! No way... no how, is a single speck of light getting through this dark as night majestic stout.  The head didn't last long and that would explan the 4.5, as opposed to a straight 5 score all around. To be fair the head while it was there, was quite a sight to behold. A darkish brown/tan color that was a perfect combination, to the black as black gets brew itself.  As I drink there was some definite lacing action going on, though it wasn't anything noteworthy.. a miniscule complaint, given the quality of the liquid within.  The smell... wow where to begin. Dark chocolate.. a hint of alcohol (well a hint by 10.8 percent standards anyway..) roasted malts, even a frutiness of sorts to it. So much going on really, that's hard to even put into words.  The Taste.... again wow about sums it up! Full bodied, with hardly a hint of the alcohol taste one would expect from a beer this strong. Don't get me wrong it's there, but trust me when I say it's well masked indeed. There's a hint of hops, but not the full fledged hop implosion one is apt to find in other Stone beers. I love hops as much as the next guy, but a nice change of pace in that regard and appropriate for the style.  Tasting further one notices definite coffee influences, as well as everything from coffee, to the darkest of chocolates. A whole lot going on here to say the very least. It's worth noting that as I slowly make my way through the glass, I become even more amazed about the well hidden alchohol. Stone deserves some definite cudos for masking it as well as they did.  Drinkabilty.... one bomber would likely be enough for most anyone, but it goes without saying that a person could quite easily 'convince' themselves to indulge in another bomber if need be.  Stone wasn't lying when they said this poured like used motor oil.. not so sure about the tasting even heavier part though. This is damn close to heaven in a glass and while heavy, made so well that even those not into the style, might be able to find some appreciation here.  World class all the way!",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,96
147,1160,aforbes10,4.58,"I bought two of these at CIty Wide in South Bend and im cellaring one for later. The other one we had last night at our South Bend Coalition of the Drinking club. This is the early summer 2005 release. Pours black, black, black. creamy caramel colored head with good lacing. fantastic overall appearance. Smells like roasted malts, chocolate, prunes. Taste was great. smoky roasted maltiness, coffee-also roasted, sourness like coffee grains, alcohol not totally hidden. Smooth in the mouth. smacks the roof of the mouth a bit for the first sip or two. Faaaantastic drinkability. i only give it a 4.5 though because im so optimistic about the one im cellaring that i want to leave room to give it a better score.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,96
147,1160,SupaCelt,4.13,"Early summer 2005 release: This Rusky Imp emerged from the bottle a deep and dark brown. Getting a decent head took some work, but I managed to get nearly an inch of ruby tinted cocoa fluff. Some reverse cascading took effect and I was afraid that it was going to overflow my glass. The head split in a hurry leaving only a ring. Lace factor was minimal due to small sips and a slickness that caused the little bergs to go sliding back into the mix. Every now and then a small carbonation bubble could be seen struggling through the thickness, but it was fairly light on effervescence.  Chocolate and raisinesque dark fruit notes dominated the nose. Vague coffee bean impressions were notable although very mute. The alcohol presence left its vaporous sting amidst the mostly sweet scents. I was unable to notice any trademark hop character, and overall the nose was pretty light.  The taste was basically the nose as interpreted by the taste buds. Scent and smell were nearly identical. Heavy on chocolate with over ripe vinous qualities. There was scarcely any bitterness in play. The finish remained juicy and wet without any dryness. Lip smacking and luscious come to mind as adjectives. The dark fruit qualities lingered on in the aftertaste quite nicely.  The mouthfeel was pretty thick. It held the clean and refined Stone character though. Where some brews have a thickness that includes an almost palpable grainy chunkiness, and sugary granulated feeling, this one was smooth and clean. It was simply dense. I have never palated anything I can think of that was similar to this with such a clean thickness.  The drinkability factor could be considered as pretty darn drinkable. This brew wasn't really a mammoth by any stretch. Sure the abv is up there pretty good, but the cleanliness makes this thing dangerously drinkable. A very solid brew, but I have to say that it appears to be greatly overrated. I was expecting more based on the numbers, but this just proves how irrelevant all of our opinions are. To each his own as they say.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,96
147,1160,doubleipa,4.92,"Summer '05 Release. Finally got around to rating this one. Aroma was light bread, strong coffee, dark chocolate, and roasted. Moderate yeast and a bit of dough. This baby pours black with minimal head. Excellent lacing that fully diminishes. This is one full bodeid brew that's oily/syrupy with only a little carbonation. This is my favorite RIS. As I have a bunch of these, I'll be adding my reviews as they age.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,96
147,1160,DarkerTheBetter,4.65,"2005  This is clearly one of the darkest beers Ive ever poured. No light comes through what so ever, not ever around the edges. The dark tan head is frothy and left only slight tracks of lace.  Smelled of dirty Hersheys syrup, black liquorish, slight dark fruits and black roasted malts with a hint of alcohol.  Tasted of huge bitter black chocolate with a smokiness up against my palate. Finishes with the best roasted malt character Ive ever encountered. The standard to which I here after hold all other imperial stouts. It doesnt taste like bonfire, or coffee; just smooth roasted malt (and a lot of it, I might add). Marvelous balance!  The mouth feel was medium bodied with a surprisingly small amount of carbonation for an IS. Actually, the light mouth feel just helps the drinkability.  This is a marvelous beer and I highly recommend it.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,96
147,1160,BigDaddyWil,5,"Acquired in a beer trade. Bottle states limited early summer 2005 release. Poured from a bomber into snifter glass at almost room temperature. Stone bombers are the coolest looking bottles I've seen, their gargoyle kicks ass!!!!  Appearance: O.K., here we go!!! First off, this beer is deep, dark black color, with a one inch thick creamy tan head. It has an inviting look about it. Some delicate tan lacing clings to my glass, but disappears after a few minutes.  Smell: Very balanced aromas of coffee, chocolate and dark fruits, like raisins or plums. Smells like what an Imperial stout should be.  Taste: Holy Crap!!! What an awesome taste!!! I already cannot wait to get more of this brew!!! So well balanced, it taste like it smells, coffee, chocolate and dark fruits. Roasted malts and hops are blended perfectly!! I wouldn't know this has an abv of 10.8%.  Mouthfeel: I must say this stout has the best mouthfeel of any beer I've tasted. Very creamy, not too heavy, not too thin, absolutely perfect!!!  Drinkablility: Even though this brew is 10.8% alcohol, it doesn't hit you too hard. It's hidden very well and the taste leaves you wanting more!!! Also, I've drank about half the bomber already, and I do not feel full at all!!!  Overall this beer lives up to its hipe!!!! This is the first beer that I can honestly say is worthy of a perfect score!! The only downfall is that Stone is not sold in MIchigan yet. So, I'll keep trading or make many trips to Toledo to pick my new favorite beer!",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,96
147,1160,rhoadsrage,4.69,"(Served in a snifter)  A- This beer has a blackish black body with a thin wisp of dark chocolate colored head that fades to a thin film around the edge. Even held up to the sun there is no sign of light or carbonation in this beer.  S- Even during the pour the aroma was breathtaking. Dark roasted grains with notes of coffee and black strap molasses, chocolate and port with some nice alcohol aroma at the finish. Prunes and raisins with a hint of dark cherries come through as it warms. Perhaps even a note of hops in the alcohol at the finish. There are some lighter notes of caramel and bready notes also.  T- The dark rich roasted grains and malts have a nice sweetness to them with notes of currants (like the bottle says) and brown sugar. Then a more robust taste comes through of dark roasted coffee with some cigar earthiness in the background. The finish has some vinous taste with a balance of hop bitterness and some alcohol kick.  M- This beer has a medium-full mouthfeel with some silky texture and a nice alcohol warmth to balance the sweetness at the beginning.  D- Even though this is a big complex beer it has a lot of balance and smoothness in flavors. As it warmed in the snifter it really took on different flavors and smells. It wasn't heavy on the burnt flavors but had nice dark flavors of all sorts.

147,1160,phisig137,4.26,"After much anticipation, I finally popped this bottle of 05 RIS, and enjoyed. It pours an absolute black like I'vew never seen before, and a caramel colored head that dissapates rather quickly. In the glass, this looks just incredible. First thoughts when smelling it remind me of malt extract that I brew with, ""Whoppers""(the malted candy), and dates.  The flavor of this beer goes along with the aroma, with huge malt flavors, slightly sweet without being cloying at all, a bit of roastiness on the finish, backed by a nice hop profile, as well a a subdued smokiness.  All in all, this is one of the best imperial stouts I've ever had, partially because it is SO much different than the standard old rasputin, heresy, or other imperial stout. I cannot wait for the 3 bottles that I have in the cellar. I think 3-4 years will do quite well.  Next time you see it in the stores (I think I bought mine in april or may) pick up a few bottles.

""ouch!!"" the blackness of the beer actually dims the room. i reach for another light switch, but to no avail. looking through stone IS colored glasses makes everything appear dark.  and the smell?! agghh! no need for nose hair trimmers this month. gone in a flash. fig, dates, over-ripe plum to the point of producing their own alcohol. and alcohol. i swear this stuff will take off your nail polish. but still sweet, fruit, and mouth wateringly delicious.  hot damn. multiply the aroma a few times and get the taste. i swear there is ssome seriously good milk chocolate in there some where. it is that smooth. of course the guys at stone cant show their sensitive side so they try to cover it with loads of roasted malt, bitterness out the you know what, coffee beans, and heat. yeah, if i was a russian czar, i would still drink this. unimagineable smoothness when it approaches room temp.  mouthfeel is hard to describe. this stuff must numb the tongue cause i dont feel it past the front of my mouth. but on the front? goood.  and drinkability? well, ok, its 10+%abv makes it hard to session (ha!! thats an understatement). but after this, i doubt anything will taste the same. i've still got half a pint left and it has changed the way i think about beer. is it possible to cram too much of a good thing into one bottle? nah. just call it stone irs and leave it at that.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,96

This one is a great beer !  Poured dark black with the faintest amber highlights at the edge, the rising bubbles from the pour result in what I call a reverse waterfall effect (flowing uphill) that I typically only notice in rich dark beers, this gives a thin brown head that faded quickly into the blackness.  The smell was delightfully roasty, malty with a hint of hops,  Taste was rich, malty, sweet chocolate, hoppy and well balanced.  Mouthfeel was full, viscous and solid.  Drinkable, if you can find it.

In the end I thought I tasted rum raisin which was interesting and quite delightful.  Mouthfeel - Very syrupy. This is one heavy beer, quite rich as well. Extrememly smooth to drink.

147,1160,Tupperwolf,4.75,"I think it's my fault - but I simply couldn't get a thick or lasting head in my Stone Imperial Stout glass (couldn't help buying it). What bit I did get was a dark tan that lasted about two seconds. the appearance of the beer otherwise is phenomenal, absolutely the darkest beer I've seen. Zero light gets through. Very sticky, a good swirl leaves a lasting brown sheen on the surface of the glass.  Smell is of nuts and baker's chocolate, with lots of spice zing and a whiff of fruit or citrus. Complex and hard to describe.  Taste is exceptional. So many things going on I can barely describe them. Oily, fruity, cloves, chocolate, coffee. There's a definite alcohol warmth but it's merely the nail in the coffin, sealing it all up. This stuff is GOOD. Taste buds I didn't know I had are standing to attention and rendering a proper salute.  Mouthfeel is similarly wonderful; Carbonation is thin, a few small and tight bubbles that are disinclined to rise, but the beer is so chewy and sticky it's like drinking a heavy wine. You know you're drinking an honest stout.  This beer is quite drinkable for its style; The alcohol content is high but masked by so many other good qualities no faults can be given (as if I'd fault high alcohol content).  This was the last bottle in the store and I'm glad I got it, and its matching glass too. If you see a bottle, snatch it up.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,96
147,1160,nlmartin,5,"Poured from the bottle into a oversized wine goblet. Vintage 2005  Appearance: The beer pours almost a perfect black. The head was a fantastic creamed coffee coloration. Great head retention noted on the beer. The lacing is heavy tan webs down the glass.  Smell: This beer is almost perfect. The smell has loads of darkly roasted coffee and chocolates. Fruity smells float throughout the beer. There is the smell of curants, raisins soaked in rum. There is a very nice spicyness floating in the back of the smell.  Taste: This beer is true to smell. There is massive amounts of chocolatey sweetness. This sweetness is offset by loads and loads of dark char roasted coffee. Dam this is great stuff. There is a nice assortment of fruity goodness floating on all the other great stuff.  Mouthfeel: This beer is very chewy. There is just layer upon layer of great tasting stuff here. This beer is very full bodied. Thanks Stones this is a Imperial Stout that does not fuck the drinker around. I could not ask for anything else in a stout.  Drinkability: Dam this is a good beer. This is a very full bodied, very big balanced treat. Gods of Beer I love this brew!",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,96
147,1160,Smittysguinness,4.83,"A HUGE thanks to BA ""smchnsgy"" for getting me the 05 and 04 version of this beer. This particular rating will be for the 05 version. I may revise it for the 04 version when I crack it open...which speaking of crack....this beer *must* be about as addictive.  Translucent black bottle with the Stone Gargoyle, 2005 limited edition on the bottom, with all sorts of cute references to Czarist Russia hidden in spots around the bottle. Makes for interesting reading while enjoying this beer.  Then the taste. I drank. It was hard not to swallow tears at the same time. The taste was so complex, and literally seemed to change as the beer grew warmer. Some hops to it, mostly  It poured into the glass with the consistency, speed and appearance of motor oil (no kidding). Thick and viscous, with a thin red-brown head that dissipated quickly. The beer did, however, leave a decent lacing around the glass.  I smelled it. I wept a little. I smelled dried fruit, but on the heavier side like dried cranberrys or raisins. Huge toasted malts, like dark rye toast.  As I tasted it, it was hard not to drink tears at the same time. Beautiful. Sweet hops up front, dark chocolate bitterness, a bit of anise seed. As it warmed, some of the dried fruit character became more apparent, as did the bitter dark chocolate become enhanced. So huge and complex.  This is definitely a full bodied beer, about as thick and chewy as I can remember in a long time. Exquisitely drinkable, but really only one at a time. Amazing beer.  Can't wait to see how the ""bottle konditioned (nice touch with the 'k,' Stone!)"" 2004 version tastes. I may pass out.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,96

The aroma is roasted coffee, licorice, chocolate, and raisins. Huge roasted malt flavor. Sweet, but not overly so. Hoppy in the finish.

147,1160,nickss,4.97,"I've been holding on to several bottles for special occassions, and since I just finished my last final of the fall semester of MBA school, I figure what better time to pop the top.  First off... the pour. This beer is darker than any beer I have ever seen. Pours thick, like the motor oil the bottle speaks to. the head, while fairly small, is a reddish brown that I have never seen before. Gorgeous beer.  As soon as I poured this beer into the glass, the fragrance hit my nose. What a complex aroma! From chocolate to berries and fruit, to a noticeable alcohol aroma, with a bit of toffee thrown in the back end. Wow... amazing odor.  The flavour is just as the smell would have me believe. Extraordinarily complex, and beautifully balanced. Huge toffee notes in the back end of this one. This is preceded by chocolate, vinous berries, and big chunky malt tastes.... simply incredible.... flawless.  As the beer warms, it becomes thicker... extremely thick. OK... not Guinness thick, but then again, that would limit the drinkability wouldn't it. As it is, the mouthfeel is perfectly thick.... you can notice the moderate carbonation and hoppiness on the tongue, but nothing the weight of the beer doesn't overcome.  For a 10.8% beer, I challenge anyone to say this isn't drinkable. Barely perceptable alcohol, perfect weight, wonderful taste. All in all, I have a hard time not giving this one all 5's.... after drinking this beer, I want to go back to all the other Impy Stouts I've tasted (maybe save Storm King) and dock them for producing, in comparison, a mediocre beer.  Wow.... glad I have two more of these in the cellar.... absolutely phenomenal.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,96
147,1160,Derek,3.5,"A: Pours like used motor oil (that's AWESOME). Black, slight redish tinge, tan head... a little retention, lace.  S: Burnt, fruity, bready.  T: Bitter, roasted, tar, molases, black currents. Certainly some depth to the flavour. Bold hop bitterness, initially slightly sweet, with a dry, sherry-like finish that's quite bitter. Did I mention it's bitter?  M: Thick, syrupy.  D: I find it a little harsh.  An interesting brew. Currently rated #2... but I think it'll start to fall as the hop heads come off their Bitter Blitz.

147,1160,Knuckles,3.9,"I kept on plugging away at the Stone lineup, hoping I'd eventually find one that I actually liked, and appear to have found it. The IRS is, hands down, the best Stone beer I've ever had. Contrary to my other experiences with Stone beers, this one almost achieves a very real balance between alcohol presence, malt sweetness and insane hoppiness, and I feel like I've finally found one of their beers that would improve with age.  Appearance: I like to shop at Uwajimaya, the Asian supermarket here in Seattle. It's a great place to find things like Asian produce, inexpensive soba and all the other crap my wife sends me in for that I can't seem to recall at the moment (I do love me some daikon radish). They also have the single largest soy sauce section I've ever encountered in any store. I like soy sauce just fine, but I'm not sure I like it that much. If I had ever found a bottle of carbonated soy sauce and poured it into a pint glass, it would look exactly like the IRS does. Actually, it also looks just like a ninja wearing coonskin cap (completely impenetrable blackness, with a dark brown head).  Smell: A massive blast of malt and alcohol that is chased out of your nose by this insane soy sauce follow up. I poured it, took a deep sniff and thought i was insane. I handed it to my wife, she did the same and said, ""Smells like soy sauce."" Nice to know I'm not completely smell-deficient.  Taste: I was a little dubious, and didn't really expect to like it, but I did. Massive alcohol in the front that is balanced by the malty, brown sugary sweetness in the middle, and then that weird salty, soy saucy finish. The hops are there (I get them only when I burp), but they are completely masked by all of the other characteristics of the beer.  Mouthfeel: I like thick, chewy beers, and this is one. I'm only rating it a four, however, because I don't like thick, chewy beers that have a massive alcohol front to them. Makes them seem thicker and more onerous than I like them to be.  Drinkability: I originally had this at a 4, but I'm actually moving it down to a 3.5. The reason for this is that alcohol presence. I was able to finish the bomber, but it took me the better part of two hours. I'm very tempted to buy a bottle of this and toss it in the cellar for a year or so. I bet that it would age very, very well (and would probably change this number score quite a bit).",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,96
147,1160,GolgiIPAratus,4.12,"Sampled: 11.25.05  Appearance is muddy black, like dark liquid chocolate. A Brown head with big bubbles sits atop. Opaque. All the way through.  Smell is creamy chocolate and roasted malts & coffee. Initially, its sort of what one expects from a big stout like this, but the creaminess gives way to an aroma of ice cream, java chip ice cream! Some barley scents are present as well, and due to mine being a 2004 edition, a little metallic smells crept in.  But not to worry, the flavor more than held up! Tangy extra dark chocolate and more roasted coffee beans envelop the palate. The creaminess follows through from the nose and a mocha coffee ice cream flavor (its slightly different from the aroma; more chocolatey) This bad boy is real sweet, but there is a bitterness at the end, though Id hardly call it hoppy. This brew is very smooth and this is even amplified by the low carbonation, which makes it quite full in the mouth.  Its fairly easy to drink for the style, but its one thats made to savor. Not much alcohol present, but it could pack a punch if you rush.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,96

This medium to full bodied beer is smooth on the tongue. The roasted malt flavor is blended nicely with some coffee, chocolate and nut tastes. Towards the end some sour cherry and alcohol flavors mix in and remain behind after each the beer is gone.

147,1160,alexwag,4.65,"Early summer 2004 Limited Release.  Allow me to preface by saying that, as the first Stone beer I've reviewed, I efffing love the bottles. Especially the Arrogant Bastard one.  A- Wow. Is this beer or a Chevron product? Sounds heavy going into the glass. Cannot be pierced by light -- a veritable black hole. Milk chocolate-looking head stuck around for a little, dissipating and inviting me to follow it. This is going to be a good time.  S- Malts and malts of malts, with a tinge giving away the high ABV (10.8% in this edition, booyah!). Chocolate, caramel, coffee, a hint of spice. All good things.  T- Sticky sweet, from the demon's head to his feet. Malts attack! Everything in the smell explodes onto the scene. Dark dark chocolate and coffee, some burnt flavors, all with solid alcohol air cover. Hops seem more or less obliterated. Since it's about to snow I can dig it, but it's hard-hitting, to be sure. Warms you up.  M- Substantial but easy -- well balanced for the ten ton flavor.  D- Putting down this bottle solo and it is a formidable task. There's a lot to it, and the 10.8 is not exactly stealth-like. Still, as one expects from Stone, quite tasty and true to form. Would certainly keep one breathing in Siberia ... sort of ironic given it comes from California.  Lives up to its reputation, but NOT to be taken lightly. This is hardcore, As such, I would only tackle this beast every so often.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,96
147,1160,BuckeyeNation,4.72,"Late Spring 2003 release. Glossy sable. No highlights, no edges, no nothing. It isn't possible for a beer to be more light nullifying than this one is. The head is one of the darkest that I've ever seen. It's a menacing shade of cocoa brown, the perfect color compliment to the beer on which it rests. It also puts the lie to the notion that high-ABV beer tends not to have large, persistent heads. Even though there isn't a glass smothering amount of lace, there's more than enough not to spoil a world-class appearance.  The nose is outstanding. It practically oozes heavily roasted black malt with all of the aromas that go along with it. Bittersweet chocolate fudge swirls around chunks of crushed coffee bean with generous lashings of molasses. The faintest hint of alcohol is more than welcome since it gives the aroma a seriousness that all good RISs possess. Perhaps nearly three years in the bottle is a bit too long to expect hops to persevere. However, I still have hope that they'll make a cameo on the palate.  Stone RIS is phenomenal! It's everything that I had hoped for and so much more. I have never experienced a more mind-blowing, darkly delicious, megaton malt bomb in my life. First and foremost, it possesses a monolithic malt backbone that gives granite an inferiority complex. Rivulets of melted chocolate, espresso, blackstrap molasses and the finest ouzo combine to create a raging river of mouthfilling (and belly warming) bliss.  The hops haven't completely faded, although I'm sure they're a shadow of their former 2003 selves. As is usually the case, they make an appearance on the finish when the malt deluge has finally begun to abate. I'd love to taste this beer fresh, but I have to say that it's an ass kicker of the highest order when aged. It's amazing how long the flavor lingers. The licorice/anise/ouzo hangs on seemingly forever.  This particular vintage clocks in at 9.47% and it feels every bit of that (even if it doesn't taste like it). This is a beer that is brewed to be sipped. It's doing an admirable job of warming me up, which I needed since I just came in from snowblowing half a foot of snow off my driveway. Each mouthful leads me to thank the boys at Stone for such an incredible beer. Although I don't usually buy in cases, this is a 'case beer' if there ever was one.  The mouthfeel is, in a word, perfection. It's as if the brewers read my mind and designed it especially for me. I've had thicker Imperial Stouts, but none that possessed this degree of heavy silkiness. Try as I might, I cannot find a flaw. Perfect mouth presence, perfect coating finish, just... plain... perfect.  SIRS is Stone's finest creation and is infinitely deserving of a place in the pantheon of the greatest beers ever created. I've run out of adjectives for 'great', but I haven't quite run out of beer. So if you'll excuse me, it's time to savor the final few swallows. Stone Russian Imperial Stout is a tour de force and is the finest stout in existence, bar none.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,96

Flavors are forceful and direct, this is a very potent beer that has a lot of very nice characteristics. Hops also finish this out with a nice alcohol finish, good for a frosty winter's night.  Mouthfeel: Full and slick, leaves a slightly sticky mouthfeel, but is very good, with appropriate carbonation levels.  Drinkability: Excellent, an outstanding Imperial Stout.

The taste is boldy sweet at first, chocolate malt and roasted barley. Some fusel notes are perceived as it warms, but a dry, american hop bite in the aftertaste keep the ABV and sweetness in check. Finish is dry, but leaves some traces of fig/plum and a slight alcohol smack.

147,1160,becktone,4.63,"This black molasses looking beer was poured from a 22oz. ""Limited Early summer 2005 Release"" brown bomber. It pours to form a nice but moderate/conservative brown head. The head quickly dissiaptes to a lacing around the sides of the glass, with a very very thin film over the top of the beer. When agitated the head dosen't really return, not very much head retention here.  The beer has a very malty smell, I detect no presence of hops at all in this beer. After tasting this beer I can easily smell the roasted barley/malt and chocolate aromas that eminate from this beer. The smell is not very strong, nor is it weak, but its about average. Don't get me wrong, the beer smells great but its not very potent, meaning this: when I opened it the aroma of the beer didn't fill the room. Ok so call me crazy but there is something in the overall aroma that reminds me of the smell my George Foreman Grill Produces when I clean it off after making Hamburgers. I clean it with a paper towel. Perhaps a burnt smell, but that's just what it reminds me of, it's a good smell of course.  This beer is amazing. I recently just brewed a batch of my own Russian Imperial stout. I was anxious to see how these two compared. I must say that the two brews have quite a different taste to them. My brew is just overall maltier, sweeter. This one has a wider variety of flavors. I can taste a roasted flavor, chocolate flavor, and an overall sweet flavor. My brew just had the overall sweet flavor to it. When this brew hits the lips the first thing I taste is the sweet malty flavor of this beer. Next comes a weak, short lived, bitter taste at the back of my tongue. This is followed by chocolate and roasted taste. The after taste after thinking about it for a while reminds me of M&M's and coffee.  Nice dark and heavy mouthfeel to this beer. It's a full bodied dark brew that feels great on the tongue. This beer is low in carbonation as well it should be, I don't think that a beer like this would be very good with high carbonation. This beer is excellent, and is definitely worth the money I spent on it. I would definitely buy it agian. As to the actual drinkability of this beer it is something to be sipped, I imagine if you drink too many of these in one night you'll easily get sick. Definitely an amazing beer go grab one if you haven't had this.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,96

147,1160,PatYoda,4.49,"Late Spring 2003 Version.  Ahh the Stone Imperial Russian Stout. Always a good choice. Let's see how it has held up over the past 2 and a half years. Pours near black with a quickly dying half centimeter of brown foam that doesn't leave much behind. Just as expected. Swirling does bring back some foam. The smell hits me before I'm even finished pouring. Molasses, vanilla, raisins, coffee, rum, and oh so much chocolate behind it all. A hint of oxidation. Now to taste. The coffee and roasted grain bite first, you can really taste them on the tip of the tongue. Chocolate is there in force, as the smell suggested. Sweetness dominates in this beer after the initial bite - the molasses and dark fruit, especially raisins, really come through, with some vanilla as well. The sweetness is defnitely kept in check, however, by the harsh acidity of the roasted grain and coffee. Bittering hops are there too, but don't seem to play much of a role. Never does the beer as a whole actually become harsh. On the contrary, it is actually very smooth and easy drinking for such a big beer. Again, there is a bit of oxidation in the finish, but it is tucked in neatly behind the bitter coffee aftertaste and the chocolate. Very well blended flavors in this, one, but it's definitely a sipper. Mouthfeel is medium to full bodied for the style, and very smooth.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,96

It smelled of the typical roasty, chocolate, but was far more complex and very well balanced. The taste was also chocolate with hints of coffee, and one of the best balances of malts and alcohol Ive ever had. The smoothness was incredible, with minimal carbonation. It finished as good if not better than when I started it, what I consider a rarity among Imperials. This was drinkable to the very end. Overall, this was one of the best Imperials I have ever had.

147,1160,Oxymoron,4.37,"Sinful? Maybe. Stones Imp Stout pours out thick and super dark. Reminds me of motor oil. When held to the light there is some color distortion hinting of a deep chestnut brown color. A decent dark tan head with limited lacing. I would say one of the darkest Ive ever seen. Very prominent at the beginning but does decrease over time.  The smell is very rich and very complex. A malt lining with chocolate mostly but roasted and coffee odors mix very nicely together. Some limited alcohol smell but a very nice rich and smooth aroma.  The taste is a very rich malt with more of a sweetness and chocolate taste. Very complex malt taste. There is a sort of smoothness thats not like a milk stout but is similar in texture. Almost like coco. There is a big phenol flavor that becomes stronger in the aftertaste. I wonder if I would let this sit if it were not to mellow out more. As it is, it really deters from the taste. One thing to note is as it warms, it becomes less detectable.  The body is super big. A very rich an complex malt. An exceptional example of how an Imp Stout should be. I am a little deterred by the phenol flavor but overall I still impressed.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,96
147,1160,mynie,4.8,"There are stout pours, and then there are Motherfucking Stout Pours. This is the later. This is completely opaque. Big brown head that ain't going nowhere.  Smells like strong coffee and Stone yeast. Very doughy. Jesus, is this an imperial IPA? Chewy tasty uncooked bread mixed with roast malt, coffee, and chocolate.  Tastes like the aforementioned flavor with a smoky hint like a smoldernig campfire. Dreams, good and bad. Lots of jumping candy and burnt toast and your mother's favorite dress when you'd lean against her and felt so safe. Remember. Feel it all over, eyes and ears and crying tongue. Look at the moon! your mother says. She tells you remember it because it's beautiful and even though you don't know what beauty is you still remember it years later, the color and the smells and her long hand over your shoulder.  Wonderful, wonderful, wonderful beer.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,96
147,1160,foamer,4.43,"2005 edition.  I can't believe how black this beer pours. I can't coax a hue out of this even with holding it up to the light. And what a thick tan head on the pour. About an inch and a half which diminishes to a nice ring of foam leaving lacing down the glass. Very impressive for 10.8% The nose is a symphony of aromas. Dark ripe fruits, unsweetened chocolate, with a faint roasted hint and some slight alcohol. Very very nice. Strong dark fruits up front blending seamlessly into a chocolatey bitterness with a strong alcohol warmth on the finish. This beer packs a punch, but does it with velvet gloves. You can tell the strength, but it hits you gently. Quite lovely, but it's going to take me the whole night to finish this bomber. Lovely thick and almost syrupy mouthfeel. Very minimal carbonation and smooth as silk. A very very lovely beer. I only wish I could get this more readily, I'd probably buy a case. Definitely something to cellar. Special thanks to Air Canada for getting this home in my luggage in one piece.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,96
147,1160,radshoesbro,3.65,a - black as black can be! completely blocks out all light. there wasn't much head and there was no lacing.  s - malty! reminds me of dark chocolate and coffee.  t - lots of malts and that 10.8% ABV is definately right in your face. mild creams goes down fairly smooth for a stone.  m - heavy bodied with a strong malt finish.  d - didn't go well with buffalo wings.,Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,96
147,1160,rabidawg,4.87,"Late Spring 2003 Release 9.47% ABV Sampled 10/09/2005   Appearance: Pours a viscous pitch black. Little carbonation, and an aggressive pour yields a modest tan head. Sticky spots of lacing shellac the inside of the glass.  Smell: The only evidence of oxidation in this 2+ year-old bottle are slight hints of sherry in the nose. The alcohol has mellowed entirely, with nary a bit of booze. Sweet malt aromas touched by bittersweet cocoa powder and fresh-ground espresso dominate any hop presence.  Taste: Incredibly smooth and creamy in the mouth, with the initial flavors of cocoa combining with that to give the distinct impression I'm drinking a cellar-temp café mocha. Amazingly drinkable for a beer this big. Age has done this one right! Big espresso bite after the swallow, with a lightly bitter and slightly astringent finish. Warming alcohol presence noticeable in the flush of my face, but not in the taste. Excellent imperial stout, and a definite top five beer overall for me.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,96
147,1160,UncleFlip,4.38,"This one is just DARK. Held to the light, there's just the barest bit of mahogany. Tan one finger head (combo of loose and tight bubbles) goes down somewhat quickly, leavng thick wet lace behind.  The smell is deep and thick, with elements of strong coffee, molasses, dark chocolate...and oddly....bacon.  The flavour tends to be spicy, with some coffee notes- and even a bit of the bacon still. There's some round sweet chocolatey bits in the bottom of the aftertaste.  The carbonation hits right up front, and deteriorates at a medium pace. The liquid underneath is thick but not syrupy.  Very drinkable to me... I could easily make a sessioner out of this. In the words of my brother, ""this beer makes me want a donut"". I couldn't agree more. We like donuts....donuts GOOD.  Be well -UF",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,96
147,1160,troutmask96,4.58,"Stone has done it again. Their version of a traditional Russian Imperial Stout is sensational. This is a gargantuan brew that pours with the viscocity of used motor oil. I would have liked to have seen a bit more head. Smell is of dark chocolate, alcohol, and currants. Taste is...oh, my...so rich, so smooth, so drinkable at almost 10% ABV. I literally had to walk away from my pint glass for several minutes to pace myself.  Proceed with extreme caution...",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,96
147,1160,DrJay,4.9,"2005: Pitch black, dark brown, chocolatey head that leaves trails of lace down the side of the glass. Very fine head reduces to a ring and sticks around throughout. Strong roasted and burnt aroma, coffee, dark chocolate and lots of caramel malt. A bit smokey as well, with some vinous alcohol, ripe fruit, and licorice. Moderate bitterness with a bit of hop flavour balances out the roasty malt and alcohol very well. This brew is full of dark malts, giving it plenty of roasty coffee flavour and a bitter chocolate. The alcohol flavour blends into the background along with a bit of acidic smoke. Finishes with just a bit of bitter dryness from the roasted grains with a fair bit of sweetness. Theres lots of alcohol warmth going down, but no harshness. Smooth and creamy, full bodied with low, well-integrated carbonation. Wow. This is a great beer, well balanced and exactly what an imperial stout should be. It'll be fun trying this one again once it's aged a while.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,96
147,1160,Sephiroth,4.4,"2004 Edition: I am drinking this from the obligatory Stone IRS glass. The beer is black. The nose is of anise, light smoke, and roasted malt.  The taste is outstanding. It is drier than the fresher 2005 edition. Raisins, cherries, figs, and other dark fruits abound. Chocolate appears as it warms. The finish is long and bitter.  The mouthfeel is heavy, the carbonation light. The drinkability is good, as in I will have no problem downing this bomber. I don't think I could drink another one.  This sample has convinced me to not touch my stash of 05 IRS for at least a year, and to get more.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,96
147,1160,gotbeer,4.7,"The beer pours a opaque black with a decent head. The head is dark like the beer, and it almost looks evil. It laces the glass lightly.  The taste is incredible. Coffee, chocolate, and raisens all come to mind. Incredible complexity and a little alcohol and a hoppy bite at the end. Very warming, and not nearly as thick as one might think from looking at the beer. That lends to a great mouthfeel, and it hides the beers ABV. The ABV is the only thing that takes away the drinkability of this beer.  An incredible imperial stout. My favorite to date, and I think it would be very hard to top.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,96
147,1160,SCW,4.3,"Deep opaque black hole sucking in every beam of light in the room from my pint glass. Small half-inch of head slowwwly forming at the top. Lingering deep beige head leaves small lacing on the pint glass.  Aroma of fruity esters, with raisins and currants dominating. Slight burnt twinge and a faint hop presence as well. A mild alcohol warming in the nose.  Taste of deep French roast coffee and bittered caramel sweetness. Body is full but not cloying. A nice balance in the medley of flavors of fruity esters, alcohol, burnt/roated flavors, and hop bitterness.  Exceptional silky velvet mouthfeel that is full-bodied yet providing a smooth viscosity. A rare feat to create such a ful-bodied brew and not have it taste like maple syrup.  Alcohol is the only burner in the drinkability of this brew. A fine nightcap, if I must say so myself.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,96
147,1160,BrewMaster,4.83,"2005 Bottle. $4.49 at BevMo.  Appearance: Big creamy brown head that looks like a dense pile of brown sugar on top of the beer. The beer is jet black like used motor oil.  Smell: Soy sauce, brown sugar, toast, caramel, sweet and rich maltiness. The nose is quite attractive.  Taste: Dark chocolate, toast, roasted and slightly burnt sugar and deep malt profile full of rich flavor. This beer is roasty and tangy but not overpowering. Nice alcohol warmth comes way after the beer is consumed. No burning. Lots of mild flavors dancing between the rich roastiness and domoinating chocolate. Those mild flavors include toffee and a light hint of cherry. Well balanced and yummy.  Mouthfeel: Smooth, full bodied, coats the palate nicely. Rich is a good adjective for the feel of this beer.  Drinkability: All around an excellent stout, Russian Imperial or otherwise. Rich and full of wonderful roasty flavor and dark chocolate goodness. It leaves a velvety smooth feel in the mouth and tastes great. When it comes to price and availability, this is one of the best stouts out there. Wonderful this year as every year so far.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,96
147,1160,ghostwalker,4.66,"Pours absolutely black. How much more black could it be? None! None more black. Not much of a head, might have used the wrong glass for this one, (a Sam Smith's Imperial Pint). The head that did form was very dark brown, left some nice lacing too.  Dark, rich, malty nose with coffee highlights.Very nice, made my mouth water.  Flavor is outstanding! Mouthfeel as well. Heavy, but in a really good way, very rich and chewy. Coffee, chocolate, black currants, raisins and a wonderfully warm and soothing alcohol presence. Overall, the best flavor I could have possibly expected, they nailed everything the Imperial Stout style is about.  Drinkable? Hell, yeah! But not an all-night kind of beer. It's more like have 1-2 during a great afternoon college football party, interspersed with something like a nice hoppy IPA, (Harpoon IPA sounds good to me). The alcohol can definitely sneak up on you, but the flavor keeps it's appeal.  I had heard so much about this beer that I went out and bought the last 3 bombers I could find. Now that I have had one, I believe the hype. Too bad this is only a seasonal, I will hoard the remaining two and await this year's batch eagerly!",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,96
147,1160,GimmeAles,4.27,"Been wanting to try this one for sometime, finally got a bottle for my birthday (what a gift!).  As with all Stone Brews, the label is part of the experience: no actual sin used says this one.  This *does* pour silky and thick (like Siberian Crude also says the label), and as head forms, Im amazed at the rocky, garnet-colored beauty that grows to about 2.5 fingers-thick. It continues to enthrall and (Ill admit, intimidate a bit) through the rest of the pour. Black as night and light carbonation struggles to the surface. The head quickly subsides to a dirty ring that lightly laces the glass  Nose is sweet and complex with the alcohol making itself known early. Prunes, raisins, and rum-soaked currants waft up dreamily, roastiness wafts in from behind.  The flavor is astounding, the fruits on the nose are immediate - again with the Prunes and currants with a backbone of French-roast coffee and black malts. Warming ethanol is a significant presence  would almost be too much would it not be for myriad other dense flavors present to balance it out. This is a huge beer. Oily in the mouth like a Port, though this has more body. Overall character struck me as remarkably Port-like as well.  Drinkability is excellent for the beers stature, though half a bomber slowed me down plenty (glad I was sharing). It was a superb combination with the char-grilled rib-eye and twice-baked potato. This would be a great beer for cellaring  the alcohol would soften and I can only imagine the deeper complexities of smell and flavor. I will be picking up a couple more of these for this reason alone.  update (01.14.08): after having this a couple more times (once aged a year on draft) I'm forced to knock this one down a bit in flavor and drinkability. A distinct, and consistent briny soy-sauce flavor (peated malt?) more present than many other impy stouts I've had since. Still, a strong offering.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,96
147,1160,unklesyd,4.67,"I have this love/hate thing with Stone. I hate something about them, but I can't put my finger on it... but I love everything else about them, most especially their beers.  Looks the way a Imp. Stout should look. Pours thick.  Complex nose, subtle hop, dried fruits, ethanol back.  Fantastic palate and flavor, multilayered and creamy with a smooth butteriness and a bitterness from the hops that is well matched with the roast bitterness.  Not nearly as heavy as I thought; it is not fatigue inducing (well, on the body, perhaps on the mind... we'll see shortly).  Overall: an unsurprising surprise. For all the hype, I expected to be let down and was not even for a moment.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,96
147,1160,Backer2004,4.25,"Damn, this is beer is kicking my ass tonight. After a big Notre Dame win versus Michigan, I knew I needed to pull somthing nice out tonight. Appears as black as any brew I've tried, this one does not overwhelm me like Stone's barleywine. Combined with a Smore and more chocolate, this one complements any dessert. Packs a nice punch, the sweet malts balances any taste of alcohol. Definitely worth the $4.99 22 oz bottle.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,96
147,1160,jakester,4.38,"This was a bomber I bought at Union Jack's on the Manatawny. I drank it in a tulip-type glass. The bottle is absolutely beautiful, as are all Stone bottles.  This positively looks like used motor oil. Thick and black as the night sky. A decent brown head of foam forms on top with an average pour. Head eventually drops to a ring, with decent enough lacing on the glass. I can see no light whatsoever through this beer.  Aroma is dark chocolate, coffee, vanilla with fruits like dates or prunes. Very estery. Vanilla stands out as this warms. Alcohol, too. Having said all that, I have smelled better RIS's.  Flavor is (WOW, is this thick!) like a chocolate/coffee milk shake with extra molasses, very dark malts, sweet as hell but not cloying in any way. A strong dose of hop bittering, combined with all the dark malts balances the sweetness pretty well. Alcohol is in there, that's for damn sure. It's very fruity, but I'll be dipped in shit if I can describe them. Aftertaste is sweet dark malts and mocha coffee.  Mouthfeel is thick as hell, oily, but in a pleasant way, very slippery on your tongue. Carbonation is soft, alcohol present but well muted.  This is one really big sumbitch. I can feel it after half the bottle, and my tolerance is pretty damn high. I like this alot. It's not a session beer, nor is it something you would drink every day, but for every now and then, or special occasions, it's wonderful. Highly recommended.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,96
147,1160,dwvarner77,4.53,"""Limited Early Summer 2005 Release""  The bottle says it pours like Siberian crude, and it does just that. Leaves a thin quarter inch of thick deep brown-crimson head that falls to keep a nice lace. Completely opaque, I can only sense the slightest hint of light about the periphery, if that. Nose is thick with chocolate, with a background of vanilla and coffee, even a hint of something like coconut. Catch no alcohol in the nose. Looks like this will be dangerous.... Taste is thick, deep with coffee, vanilla and chocolate. Sweet and malty, slight hop balance present, and the alcohol only hints at you with a warm taste in the belly. Incredibly smooth, the slightest hint of carbonation keeps it from appearing syrupy. A bit of a thick texture at the back of the tongue, but not a detriment. Big, thick, and strong, full of flavor, and dangerous b/c the ABV hides itself well. Could hit this again and again.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,96

She had a nice dark brown head that fell to a ring around the glass leaving no lacing at all. The smell is of roasted malts, molasses, fresh brewed coffee, rich dark chocolate, and hints of vanilla and alcohol. The taste was a powerful roasted malt, with chocolate, coffee leading into an aftertaste of slight hops alcohol and dark chocolate lingering on the tongue. The mouthfeel is rich, creamy, very thick and enjoyable. Very drinkable beer for an impy stout lover like myself. I cannot wait to try this one after it has some age on it.

147,1160,beerinator,4.4,"22 ounce bomber  Appearance: Dark, black beer. When light strikes the glass, it shows through a really really dark brown. Dark brown head.  Aroma: Smells are roasty, creamy and slightly bitter. The smells are nutty and thick with breadyness. Vanilla and cherry fruit are lingering at the outskirts of the nostrils.  Taste: The mouthfeel is solid and coating. The bitter flavor, from the coffee and dark chocolate side of the roastyness, flows through the mouth, lingering through the mouthfeel. The depth of flavor here is dramatic to say the least.  Notes: A very solid Imperial Stout. Very much worth your time.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,96
147,1160,SkeeterHawk,3.82,"Appearance: It looks like motor oil in my glass with a small tan head around the ring of my glass. It didn't pour with hardly any head. I have no idea how many bubbles are maintaining the head...it's Black!  Aroma: There are some noticeable floral hops hanging out with the roast and alcohol aromatics. As it warms, the aromas get more intense, but you don't notice anything really different than when it was first poured except that the alcohol becomes more apparent.  Taste: Super rich beer! There is a lot more hops in this version than I think that I have ever tried. There are noticeable floral hops when you first taste this beer to go along with the roast and fruit flavors. You get slammed by the roast and hops initially and this really doesn't let up much until you get a syrupy slick warming sensation on the back of your throat...like I imagine taking a teaspoon full of Vicks salve would be like.  Opinion: Golly gee, this is not your ordinary beer! It is way big, and something that I personally would only drink on occasion. I shared a bottle with some of my club members at a brew-in yesterday, and I am glad I didn't try to tackle this beer on my own. I think that this beer would do well to sit down for at least two years at 50F to let the hops mellow and the alcohol to add complexity. Like this, it hits your palate with brute force.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,96

In the nose there is some dark chocolate and alcohol. The bottle mentions anise. That must be the scent that is turning me off. Same with the flavor. After a while of drinking, Im starting to come around. I think its somewhat astringant. Hard to drink.

147,1160,AlexJ,4.72,"Nightmare black pour. Fluffy head the color of espresso foam lasts for about 30 seconds. No lace, no ring, no cling, although it is obviously viscous and tarry. Not really expected at this high ABV.  Aroma meets me before I even get my nose in there. Powerful chocolate and coffee, shadowed by dark fruits, anise, charred malts, creme brule', and sweet alcohol. Very deep and complex nose.  Flavor starts off with unsweetened espresso mocha, high%-cacao dark chocolate, rum soaked plum and berries, creamy dark caramel, a hint of smoke, and piney/floral hops in the finish. A bit of sweetness is apparent somewhere in the middle, and in the finish. Superbly balanced. The level of hops is perfect and allows the glorious dark malt flavors to take center-stage. The finish on this beer is unbelievably long.  Mouthfeel is just shy of big, with a very oily, almost syrup-like texture and a slick, creamy mouthfeel. This beer is pure bliss to drink. It satisfies me on every level. Thank God I have one more bottle!  Thanks to GClarkage for the samples.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,96

On with the review.  So i poured from the bottle to glass and the color is rich dark black, couldn't see through to the other side. aroma is definately roasted with chocolate and coffee notes. Mouthfeel is full bodied with a lasting aftertaste. A bit rough around the edges as it leaves your mouth almost a bit puckered, but I have been assured that aging does wonders for this one.

147,1160,mntlover,4.23,2005 Vintage  Pours a dark deep black no light thru this one big fluffy chocolate head but not much lace.  Aroma is lots of roasted malt big coffee aromas mingled with alcohol and hops. Some chocolate and fruit mingled underneath.  Taste is well a little hot and rough on this one some cellaring should help mellow it to perfection. Taste is big lots of roasted malt packing big coffee flavors upfront. Have the fruit dipped in sweet chocolate underneath trying to mellow out some of the harshness. Alcohol is noted and finishes with a nice dose of hops pine/grapefruit west coast style.  Mouthfeel is nice big full flavored loads of malt.  Drinkability is good still a nice IRS but doesn't live up to the 04 yet which seemed perfect fresh. Then it has been a year and I have had lots of big Stouts since then so maybe my tastes have matured either way believe this one will only improve with age.

A moderately sweet and almost heavy bitter, roasted and nutty milk chocolate malt taste with molasses and coffee, flowery herbal and pine hops flavor with lime and grapefruit/orange.  Full bodied, dry and creamy texture, soft and lively carbonation, and has a smooth metallic and heavy alcohol finish with a light astringency.

The taste isn't syrupy, though, as the carbonation cuts through nicely. The body in this beer reminds me of Double Bastard, but the flavor is (of course) a more chocolatey, coffee taste. I don't get the ""dark fruits"" that a RIS is supposed to contain, but I think my tongue (or my brain?) is less sensitive to the fruity esters that beers contain. This beer is probably too over-the-top for an August evening such as right now, but I think I'll be picking up another of these in the winter!",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,96

The head quickly goes down to a thin ring.  The aroma is sugary lactic cocoa with some anise, coffee and a little fruitiness.  The flavor is sweet chocolate and fruits that quickly morphs into a strong burnt, somewhat acidic, licorice bitterness with a noticeable alcohol finish. The mouthfeel is very full-bodied and viscous with light carbonation.  Overall, a solid brew. A little strong on the sweetness and the alcohol in my opinion.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,96
147,1160,garymuchow,4.82,"This bottle obtained via BIF10 from Gueuzedude. Many thanks for this treat!  This is review #500  Wonderfully rich aroma of dark malts and fruits. Alcohol. Heavy rich sweetness. A slight oxidized state from aging. A little wild hop aroma hanging around on the fringes round it off nicely. Greatly complex. Black as pitch, with one of the darkest heads ever that starts off heavy but in time settles into a persistent ring. The flavor is the kicker on this. Extremely heavy and rich without being over the top. Roast more abundent than the fruits. Ever increasing bitterness rounds off the drink with an extended dryness. Again bold with without excess. Thick and chewy mouthfeel of just the right lower level carbonation. Soft and smooth, but not quite velvety. Very nice nonetheless. This drink holds all the right elements. Complete and complex. In the words of my fellow MN BA's Yum!   An early summer 2004 addition that I sat on for over 1 year. It's aged beautifully.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,96

Tastes of alcohol, burnt malt and coffee. Milky too. Oaky vanilla. Tastes kind of like those little chocolate bottles filled with liquor. Rich malt and some alcochol burn in the finish. Creamy mouth and smoky on the back of the throat that lingers. A sipper to be sure but very good.

Taste, oh the taste, was dark chocolate, coffee, and bitter hops up front. Body is very full and mouthfilling. Sweet malt is balanced by massive hops, and rounded out by the dark coffee taste. This is a massive beer. Finish is long and sweet with snappy and bitter hops.  Wow, what a beer.

A intense roasted aroma and alcohol dominated the nose in its preliminary stages. As the beer warmed sweet dark fruits and malts were detectable. No doubt this beer has some hops but they are in the shadows.  The first thing that hit my tastebuds was saltiness. That faded quickly and was a strange sensation. As the beer opened up I detected licorice, espresso and burnt toast. This is a very deep complex tasting brew. I tasted some earth and nuttiness as well. The alcohol is very prominent in the taste right now as well. Best way to describe this RIS is intense!  The mouthfeel is thick, rich, full-bodied, and creamy. The beer has a very long finish with its burnt, roasted character swirling around the mouth long after it has been swallowed. It is definitely alcohol forward right now.

Poured into an Arrogant Bastard pint glass.  Appearance: Blacker than Lucifer's soul. Beautiful three-quarter inch thick head the color of toffee and brown sugar. Surprisingly little lacing.  Smell: Hints of chocolate, mocha, with a somewhat fruity undertone. Brown sugar and molasses dominate my nose. An entire dessert shop in one bottle.  Taste: Oh lord. Chocolately, sweet, wonderfully tasty. A bittersweet coffe/mocha flavor hits a second later. Hints of prune, and very little alcohol. Acidity and bitterness seem to keep each other perfectly in check. More than 4.5, less than 5.0, what am I to do?  Mouthfeel: Easily my favorite part of this beer. Smooth and creamy. Feels like a milk stout going down. Velvet is the first word that comes to mind. I would give it a 6 if I could.  Drinkability: Amazing. You WILL drink this a little too quickly; there is no stopping yourself.  overall: As a relatively inexperienced BA, this beer seems to fit PERFECTLY within it's style. This is a wonderful treat. A dessert unto itself. If you are a fan of big beers, you MUST try this.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,96

147,1160,karengarys,3.8,"Update 9/21/2006: Tried the ""early spring 2006 bottle"". The mouthfeel is very good, somewhat creamy. finish is clean. Flavors are as before, I'm raising my original review from 3.5 to 4 on the taste and mouthfeel. The fizzy wisky is not as I originally reviewed - yes, there is some, but at over 10% I'd think some alcohol flavor exists. I'm finding ""fizzy wisky"" more like ""rich RIS style"" than I originally percieved. Year to year variation? I would say my tastes and perceptions are more the discrepancy here. In any case, TRY THIS!!!    This pours from the ""early spring 2005 bottle"" quite thick! Aaah, yes, the rich Imperial stout! Dark brown that light hardly passes through - I'll have to pour another during daylight to see if sunlight can peak through. No head, too much alcohol I guess.  smell - alcohol, malt and molassis. In a good way.  Taste - a bit thick on the alcohol, richly sweet, but hardly a balance that I would expect. I'll have to revisit that bottle of Great Lakes Blackout Stout and give it another try to compare, (I will update this review if my taste buds are skewed today), but it seems that this all alcohol and sweetness with little other stuff to balance it out. Too much like fizzy wiskey for my tastes.  Mouthfeel is a bit flat and thick too.  Finish is a little rough going down. That thickness turns a bit thick on the way down, with a bit of bitter unpleasentness.  I tend to like some Russian Imperial Stouts. I like Great Lakes Blackout and North Coasts Old Rasputin - but this one lacked the balance needed to hide the heavy alcohol a bit. Please try one anyway, I've love every other offering I have tried from Stone.  I will re-review this if I've found today was just an off day. I'm surprised I'm not giving this at least a 4, but it just isn't cutting it per my tastes.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,96

147,1160,mcclurmc,3.89,"Incredibly black - won't even let light shine through. A thick, chocolaty head with good amounts of lacing; the head recedes fairly quickly. The body is as thick as it is dark, pouring with a consistency almost like that of real maple syrup. Only light carbonation after the pour. If the head were a little thicker, alittle creamier, and lasted longer I would have given it a 5.0.  Very strong smelling at first, but less so as head dies down. I smell something that reminds me of soy sauce, also a little anise and coriander. The light carbonation probably lends to the dissipating nose. As it warms the nose starts to reappear, but slightly. At the end of the glass, I begin to smell the alcohol; but only slightly.  This is my first Imperial Stout, so I'm not sure exactly how this beer is *supposed* to taste. I definitely taste a medium-strong bitterness that lasts after I finish drinking. I can taste the anise and a malty sweetness very well. A slightly metallic aftertaste lingers a few moments after swallowing. The flavors change as the beer warms up and its character definitely moves towards that of a Scotch Ale.  This is exactly what I expected an Imperial Stout to feel like. It is very thick with a consistency like whole milk. It leaves a sticky sensation on my lips, as if I had been eating a candy. As thick as it was to begin with, it gets even thicker as it warms. Silky is probably a better way to describe it.  This is a very strong beer, not in any particular area but as a whole. It's bitter but not incredibly bitter. It's thick but not syrupy. It has a powerful nose that dissipates quickly. It's very malty but not quite like a Scotch Ale. It wasn't very carbonated, but I would expect as much from a stout without one of those little Guinness nitro-widget thingies. I think this beer might take me close to an hour to drink even if I wasn't writing a review while drinking it. Even so, the taste makes me wish I could drink it faster.  I like this beer. It has a good, strong taste that isn't characteristic of normal stouts. It has a beautiful appearance and incredible mouthfeel. It is incredibly dynamic as the flavors change while the beer warms. On the downside, it is a little hard to drink - this is definitely a meal in itself. I think the taste definitely improved as the beer warmed up, though towards the end the alcohol got a little strong. If it weren't for that and the quickly dissippating nose, I would have given this a very high score. Overall, however, a very good beer.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,96
147,1160,pentathlete,4.4,"Black...opaque, with a minimal head by the time it arrived. Firm ring of foam atop the brew. The nose lacked the complexity that I was expecting, some coffee, a little licorice. But the taste...semi-sweet chocolate start, bitter coffee, anise and hops, all working together and standing apart. Where was all of this in the nose? Mouthfeel is oily, full and the finish is marathon length. All the flavors reappear and linger long after the swallow. Find it. Drink it. Enjoy.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,96
147,1160,krberg,4.37,"2K5 release.  Impenetrable black body with a shaved chocolate colored head.  Smells like sweetened cocoa powder. No hop notes.  Dark roasted coffee, chocolate with a slight tang and a sweet finish. I can find some bittering hops, but they are very well hidden beneath the dark malts. Little to no alcohol profile.  Thick like whole milk. Fantastic! Carbonation is low, but there is some CO2 bite present.  Too bad this is nearly 11% because it is wonderfully smooth and drinkable.  Stellar RIS! Kudos to Stone. Certainly a beer to look forward to each year.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,96
147,1160,cooter,4.67,"Let's work down from 5 on this bad mofo, because it seems appropriate.  It's presentation boasts a totally black body--carbonation invisible thereby--and a dark tan head. It loses marks for a light, easily erased foam cover--but thankfully it comes back with a little swirl, because DAMN is that foam delicious. Creamy and bursting with flavor, MMMM so good. Demerits for poor lacing. Also, the bottle is standard-issue Stone awesomeness, with an essay and random funny tidbits (it was brewed during a jig...).  The smell has coffee, chocolate, caramel, but I don't know what ""anise"" is so it may or may not be there (like the bottle notes say). Loses a point for potent alcohol scent...nah, it doesn't, because it smells good next to the (roasted?) malt flavors.  Tastes fantasmorgasmic. Everything from the nose is back, plus cherries, a brilliantly enjoyable cloying-like sensation, and something reminiscent of heavy cream. Grapefruit comes through when the carbonation hits. Goes well with sour cream and burrito, by the way. Apple is in there, I think, and maybe--is that pear? Well, other fruits. And a wonderfully balanced hop/malt ratio. Alcohol is put in context.  Amazing texture! Silky but with so much flavor as it runs by. Smooth but biting somehow...great for such a strong and dark brew. Deserves its place among the top 10.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,96

147,1160,Dukeofearl,4.13,"EDIT: Now includes a 2005 release notes (7/28/05)- I didn't do a separate review, because the scores are pretty much the same, and much of the descriptive info is the same too. The big difference- seems more coffee-like rather than bitter chocolate. But it's bitter coffee. And the alcohol notes are really strong- too much for this lover of a kinder, more gentle (but still full flavored) beer. But the flavor profile is still pretty nice in mid-drink, just rough at the end.  Early Summer, 2004 varietal, found in a little out of the way liquor store in July of 2005. I actually thought it was the new vintage when I bought it- I was pleasantly surprised when I got it home. I may pick some more up and compare with the '05 soon. Great little bits on the label like ""Limited... Release, Bogartski while you can"" and ""Brewed and bottled while doing a Cossack dance by...."" the Stone boys do have a sense of humor!  Jet black racing motor oil, with a beautiful brown soap-bubble head that quickly subsides, leaving a little lacing. I love this look.  Aroma is actually not all that strong. Good roasty malt profile, with slight bitter chocolate. I looked for coffee, didn't find it.  Flavor is great with one off note. The overall blending of the roasted malts in a rich, very full mouthfeel is marvelous. My only kicker is that it has a stronger alcohol back end than I like.  Overall, very good, but watch out for the alcohol- not to be taken lightly, comrade!",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,96
147,1160,IceAce,4.9,"2005 Edition  Poured into a chalice, this beer becomes a black hole within my home office. Light may enter this brew...but absolutely none is allowed to escape. It is capped with a ½"" of malted-milk style foam which seemed to be chased off within a minute by the alcohol esters emitted from the goblet opening.  The nose, as a precursor to actually tasting the body, does a very good job of readying the palate. Ripe with chocolate, molasses, black currant, and heady alcohol, this stout is nothing but serious business.  Entry is silky smooth, getting support from a perfect level of carbonation. The deeply roasted malts lead headlong into the midtaste, quickly followed by layer after silky layer of chocolate covered fruits, molasses, and toffee. The finish is ushered in by a fast appearing wall of hoppiness which quickly disperses into a beautiful, alchohol-warming, slow malt fade which warms both the throat and the heart...",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,96
147,1160,Mark,4.28,"This review pertains to the limited edition 2005 early summer release. Black as night with a malted milk head that faded fairly fast. Some small smatterings of lacing were evident. It poured a thick almost motor oil like consistency. Aroma was of dark fruits, raisins, plums, and some roastiness. Alcohol in strong evidence. Taste was superb, one to sip, with all the above mentioned aromas figuring strongly as well in the taste profile. Thick and rich on the palate, with some chocolate notes I may add. This kicks your butt folks, I went right to bed after I had my bottle. More appropriate for a cold winter night but thankfully I had a coolish summer night to try it on.

The head doesn't last long and quickly settles to ring the glass nicely.  Smell: Dried plums, raisins, vanilla, a bit of oak, also some alcohol esters noted. Truly magical.  Taste: Very raw and vinous. A touch of smoke, vanilla bean, dark roasted malts, bitter chocolate, french roasted coffee all beat the heck out of my palate.  Mouthfeel: Medium bodied and slightly creamy. The carbonation balances out nicely. There is a long, coffee bitterness to the finish.  Drinkability: One to sip and savor. A fine summer tradition.

Head resembled chocolate mousse Lacing stuck around, used a pint glass, tonight I will use a goblet. Mouthfeel is thick and syrupy coating my toungue and teeth The drinkibility was what I was really surprised by. To go into the complexity of the flavors is a bit daunting. In no particular order, chocolate, coffee, fig, currant, prune.  Malty but not too sweet, hops are there for a bit of a bitter finish, but definitely not a stand out characteristic.

Huge dark chocolate smell, mocha and coffee in there too. Wonderful.  Taste/Feel: Holy crap. Freakin' good. Tastes even more like dark chocolate than it smells. It's not too sweet, though, nice and balanced. Roasted barley and and decent amount of hop bitterness in there too. Hops are certainly present, but they're balanced.

Pours out very thick, and the head retains well and leaves a good amount of lace.  Smell is dominated by alcohol, roasted malt, piney hops, dark fruit, dark chocolate, and coffee. Smells quite yummy.  Taste is quite complex. The roasty flavors meld well with a substantial hop bite, and a chocolatey coffee flavor persists throughout. The alcohol is present throughout the flavor, but comes through particularly strong in the finish. The creamy mouthfeel does a lot to enhance these flavors, and it comes through as the complex delightful mix of all of these notes.

147,1160,BEERchitect,4.5,"Release '11: (reviewed 05/31/11)  An insanely masculine stout with ultimate creamy maltiness, aggressive roast, and a lush cocoa driven, coffee-centric flavor that completely defies what stouts should be.  Black as coal and with a voluptuous pour that exudes weight, creaminess, and viscocity- this inky black beer builds a thick top coat of foam adorns a medium tan color, carries a heafty retention and moderate lace. All this manifests in a very dessert-like appearance.  Malty, malty, malty rich aromas of slightly burnt toffee, nutty coffees, bittersweet cocoa, all come together in a way that reminds me of Whoppers malted-milk candies and chocolate covered espresso beans.  Flavors are all the same, except the malty sweet flavors erupt first, then with the quick rebuttal of coffee, cocoa, nutty flavors that demand attention at mid palate. All that coffee, chocolate, and nutty taste rounds out wonderfully with a bitter-sweet but cherry alcohol flavored finish that's reminescent of tirimasu and espresso bitterness.  Very lush and creamy textured, the early feel is robust and full. The beer makes a quick but even transition to a hearty malt mid palate, just before the bittering and drying finish. Though the beer never achieves full dryness or refreshment (It's not supposed to), rather holds onto a savory bitter chocolate semi-dry finish that lingers well into the next sip, making it a perfect compliment to a dessert or as a dessert itself.  Stone's Imperial Russian Stout is always at the epidome of what the style represents. With ultimate maltiness and supportive roast and complexities, it's amazing how effortless the beer seems at it's rudimentary levels, but how complex and succulent it becomes the more you delve into it's individual and unique flavors.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,96
147,1160,beersarang,4.87,"2004 edition: Pours a black black black with a dark tan head. Did I mention this beer is black? Head retains pretty well and I can tell just by looking at it that this beer is THICK.  Fruity alcoholic roasty aromas rise out of this beer, coffee chocolate etc. Pure evil.  At first a strong fruity malt base hits, then you get punched in the face with hops and alcohol. The bitterness is indeed pronounced, and beyond that, the alcohol is noticable. The roast coffee/chocolate character is quite appealing. Lots of raisin and a touch of charcoal too. Finishes sweet and amazing. Aftertaste reminds you for the next two minutes. Damn.  Thick, pretty heavy bodied light carbonation, right on par for the style, I would like to say.  I would love to have this beer again, one of the best Imperial stouts, in my opinion.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,96
147,1160,sulldaddy,3.98,"I am sampling a bottle from 2003 at room temp in a tulip/snifter. The bottle has been cellared adequately. The beer pours pitch black with a 3 cm fluffy tan head foaming up easily. Leaves tight latticework as it slowly fades. Aroma is deep rich chocolate and brown sugar, mising with some ripe plums and raisins. Deep sniffs detect just a hint of alcohol. The first sip reveals a creamy silky body that caresses my palate. This mixes with a very fine carbonation that tingles gently across my tongue. Whoa! A good bit of warming from throat to belly after the swallow. Didnt get that on the nose! Flavor is very malty! I get chocolate and some dark ripe fruit with a bit of espresso bean bitterness. The flavor gives in to the heavy warming effect on the finish. Very hot and it is difficult to focus on other aspects of the beer. The beer is thick and heavy and this combined with the hot finish make it a big time sipper IMO.  Overall I find this beer to be good, but wonder if I were drinking cold would only the alcohol come through? Perhaps I will need to try a fresh bottle next time I see one I will buy for sure. Tough to surmise, but would the alcohol be hidden better if fresh? Perhaps I should also try it again when it isnt so stinkin hot outside!

147,1160,Litterbean,4.65,"I pop open the cap and watch as wisps of steam furtively escape the chilly interior, like moaning spirits reaching towards the sky. Pouring forth from this dark bottle comes a fluid so deep, thick, and syrupy that pancakes are suddenly my deepest desire. The rocky, off-white head taunts me. I lift my glass to my nose, and am overtaken by a sweet caramel aroma, with hints of licorice, and sweet caramel. Visions of hop flowers enter my brain as I realize that the earthy character of this brew is more than palpable. The taste, where to begin? Hoppiness to the extreme, but a deep, burnt, chocolatey undertone hits me where it hurts the most: my palate. Undaunted, I realize that the complexities of this beer are too much to handle. I find many hints and flavors, all intermingling and forming a cacophony of sinful flavor in this hearty brew. Sip upon sip reveals nuances that had previously remained hidden. The balance between the hops and malts are striking, but just because there is balance does not mean that neither is too extreme. Both are in your face, both hit you like a ton of bricks, and both can decimate the palate if one does not respect this mighty beer. Smoothly it finishes, and is surprisingly easy to drink. And just as easily as it was poured, it finishes, and my liver has a long night ahead of it.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,96
147,1160,neonbrown82,4.51,"Every time some Stone manages to find it's way into my belly here in Stone-deprived Iowa, it seems to impress me more and more. Thanks to fellow BA mentor for sharing this exceptional brew.  My review for appearance is no different than my previous take on this brew. It pours to a dark sludgy black with a little brown head. Just like siberian crude. Also giving a bonus .5 point to the appearance/presentation for the fact that the Stone bombers are so enjoyable to read.  The smell wasn't quite as powerful as I remembered it to be. Caught aromas of coffee, chocolate, black liquorice (anise), and a subtle but undetermined hop.  The taste was as described by the nose, but much more intense. The chocolate malt flavor was blended very well with the coffee. There wasn't much of a hoppiness or roastiness detected, but rather it seemed to be quite sweet. This beer is responsible for my current craving for the Imperial Stout style.  The mouthfeel is full and viscous. Once again, has a very oil like quality, not that I've ever actually ingested crude oil for a true comparison. After about a year of aging, the ethanol flavor seems to have become more mild along with the bitterness. I think the year has done this brew well.  Drinkability is quite high, but I couldn't rate it at perfect due to the fact that 1 22 oz is not enough, but 2 seems to be almost too much at times. I think this is my favorite brew at the moment, but unfortunately it is not distributed here.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,96

Some very subtle citric hops, a hint of coffee and a little alcohol. Almost sugary sweet like a milk stout. Hugely complex and intrigueing. Tastes of roast bitterness followed by that sugary sweetness that is evident in the nose. I absolutely love it. Sort of marshmallowy. Some acrid bitterness in the finish, along with some resinous hops. Very warming and alcoholic. This beer is a mouthfull, creamy and very thick. Mouthcoating is the word.

147,1160,mentor,4.85,"Bomber obtained from Liquor Mart (Boulder) in 2004 and consumed in June 2005. Pours a dandy brown two-finger head over a pitch black liquid. Smells of roast, chocolate, molasses, and alcohol. Tastes divine. Wow this is incredible. Starts sweet smooth molasses chocolatey before Ghengis Khan drives 1,000 screaming roasted barley grains through my mouth and down my throat. A detectable alcohol lays beneath these flavors and becomes more prevalent in the aftertaste. Super thick creamy mouthfeel and mild carbonation. Further tastes reveal a great depth in the molasses flavor. Wet sweet to start with some fruits, but they are hard to identify before the roast appears. Plums or prunes and some licorice, too. The roast is dry and contrast with the malt in a nice power struggle. In the end, roast dry does win out, but the malt sweet hasn't completely given up the ghost. It's for this reason that I never became tired of this beer. I can't tell if I'm attributing some hop bitter to the roast character or not. If there are any hops here, they have settled. This is one fabulous beer. Many desirable flavors coming and going in an easy and well-blended flow.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,96

Thick prune, fig and sweet capuccino tones to the nose. Rich silky body permeated with the standard Impy tastes...deep chewy dried fruit tastes, cocoa/coffee tones. Light hop presense ( many be a result of the aging). Finish give the licorice impression that the alcohol turns to a light salty taste.

I'm still thinking about that, while I'm pouring the beer out, I'm also thinking, damn, that is some DARK beer, holding this up against a light, NOTHING gets through. Kind of a wimpy head I'm thinking, and it's just this thin layer of thick brown foam. The first sip of this beer is like getting punched in the face. Just a goddamn onslaught of flavors. The usual stout flavors are there, like chocolate, roasted grains, sweet maltiness, enough hops to notice, a slightly dry puckering feeling, and all this shit is turned up to eleven.  At first, it's nice and cold, tastes like dark chocolate mixed with cold cofee and a few tablespoons of sugar. But see, it's deceptive, the flavors are so strong that they soon over power you, and while your tastebuds are being pummeled into submission, all you can do is sit there and stare into space for a couple minutes, until you realize, ""I should really take another sip now."" The beer warms up, and and I can start to taste the alcohol, it burns slightly, but not in a bad way, it actually helps me snap out of the trance. The beer tastes much sweeter now, and the alcohol is making my whole chest feel warm (which is good, cuz I had to ride home tonight from work on my motorcycle while it was raining). I'm giving this one almost all 5's, to me it is everything a beer should be, appealing to my basic tastes, while firing off some synapes in my brain.

No head to speak of, just a light rim around the circumference of the glass. Mocha/java in appearance; nice, inky black. Impressive whisky and molasses bouquet, quite sweet, like an understated WWS.

Taste - sweet up front, then progresses smoothly into coffee flavors, delicious and roasty. 10.8% abv comes through but is masked extremely well. Ends with a mild alcohol warmth, chocolate and espresso.  Mouthfeel - smooth, rich, and moderately carbonated.  Drinkability - perhaps the most drinkable 10%+ beer I've ever had.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,96
147,1160,GCBrewingCo,4.63,"The beer poured into the glass black, midnight black, the head was very low, dark brown, but was persistent and laced the glass.  The aroma was strong expresso coffee, dark chocolate and fruitiness blended with some higher alcohols. The fruits were dark and that of raisins and prunes.  The flavor was dark chocolate with raisins and prunes and other fruits. The malt had a sweetness that was comanded by the acidity of the dark grains. The expresso flavor tamed the sweetness into submission and then held it on the ground till it was made to cry Uncle. The bitterness component in the flavor was slightly grassy and understated again held in place by chocolate and coffee.  The finish was dry with a lasting coffee and chocolate mixed with dark fruits long into the aftertaste. The body was full, every bit of it. Alcohol made it's presence known in the aroma, but really only shined in the warming sensation that occured after consumption.  22 ounce bottle. 2004 early summer release. The head must have been impaired by the alcohol content of the beer. The alcohol also lowers the drinkability slightly.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,96
147,1160,BeerFink,4.65,"2004 release, served from a 22oz bomber...  This seemingly demonic brew blackens my snifter as a sticky brown head arises like a phoenix. As I consume this stout, sticky lace accumulates on the sides of the glass. No light is visible anywhere in this blackness. Huge aromas eminate from the glass - dark fruit (black currants) is up front, along with lots of black coffee and some bitter chocolate. Alcohol is also apparent in the nose. Taste is quite complex. Roasted barley and black patent flavors are quick to attack the palate. The dry malt blitzkrieg is followed by sweet fruits. I'm thinking about raisins, black currants, and prunes as this stout permeates my digestive system. Coffee and and a little chocolate are also apparent, lingering til the bitter end. The faintest hint of hops are apparent, but are not long in the world of this stout. Alcohol is not hidden at all - it takes control of the flavor a little too quickly, but is not totally overpowering. There is a classic roasted finish, enhanced by the warming alcohol. The sweet fruit flavor balances the roast taste like few others. The 10.8% abv warms the body quite like a wine. Good carbonation balances the heavy mouthfeel. Although not the stickiest of imperials, you still feel like you need a toothbrush to be rid of this brew. Chalk up another heavy hitting ass kicking brew from Stone.  I couldn't think of a better way to sum up this stout than an excerpt from the bottle: ""It almost seems evil.""",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,96
147,1160,Hefe,4.7,"22 oz. bomber with the Stone Gargoyle doing his job impressively. ""Komplicated Beer for Komplicated Times, Komrad"" it says at the bottom. Indeed. One hell of a Komplicated brew. Late spring 2003 release served with decadent capitalist chocolate dessert on 3/19/05.  Pours a dark chocolte brown, with light visible at the edges, and a surpisingly thick chocolate head that quickly dissapates to sticky lacing at the rim of the glass. Before I even get my nose anywhere near the glass, it hits me. Molasses, dark roasted coffee, bitter chocolate, dried fruits. The flavours are of a chord with the aromas, the finish is unexpectedly dry given the immense richness and a seeming initial sweetness. Carbonation is very fine, and the mouthfeel would be creamy if not for a viscous richness. Despite the size of this brew it never becomes cloying or overwhelming.  Bravo!",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,96
147,1160,bensiff,4.77,"This dark beauty poors dark and thick consistent with the style. It has a slight tan head with nice lacing.  Its aroma is filled with alcohol, dark chocolate, and coffee notes. Mouthfeel is full as this high gravity drink delivers a powerful yet surprisingly smooth punch given its high ABV. Taste is outstanding and by far the best I have encountered in this style.  Overall this rates highly with exceptional drinkability. Due to its heavy hitting nature resulting in a slow sipping intake, I suggest a nice cigar accompany this one to bring out the best in both. Take the two in on the back porch with a friend and a debate of philosophy, theology, and politics and you have a glorious night...just remember that drinking this Russian doesn't mean that you aren't a good red blooded American even if commy's come up in the debate.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,96

147,1160,Gagnonsux,4.7,"Purchased this while on vacation in Memphis. The color is black, head is medium brown and creamy. Head is very good considering the 10.8% ABV. The aroma is of rich, dark chocolate with slight whiffs of alcohol and roasted coffee. The taste is quite simply amazing. Rich and complex dark chocolate flavor is ruling my world here. Alcohol flavor is noted in the finish. A light roasted taste rounds this out. Another great thing about this beer is that considering the extremely full flavor and high alcohol content, Stone Imperial Russian Stout is amazingly drinkable. This is a beer that every fan needs to get their hands on. I haven't finished my bomber yet and I'm already mad that I can't get more locally.

Aroma: Coffee, bitter chocolate, dark fruit, and strong alcohol notes utterly dominate the aroma.  Taste: Opens with sweet alcohol, dark malt, there is a vinous note that carries throughout; dark fruits are present throughout most of the taste. Finishes with a strong bitter note of cocoa and coffee.  Mouth feel: Smooth and rich body, almost syrupy.

Smells of dark roasted chocolate malt and dark fruits (black-currant, plums, raisins) on a vinous, oily and spicy alcohol base. Flavor starts with sweet fruits, is enlivened with stabs of alcohol spiciness, tons of bitter chocolate and slight roasted coffee malt. The flavors intermingle all the way to the finish, which features bitter roasted coffee and chocolate and a very strong alcohol bite and warming. Quite viscous in the mouth, with nearly imperceptible carbonation and a thick, oily feel.  A gigantic imperial stout.

The aroma is heavy with chocolate and roasted malt notes. There is just a mild hint of citrus hops on the finish. More chocolate notes up front in the flavor. The roasted malt comes across too along with a bigger, brighter hop flavor than I expected. There are layers of flavor in this beer, and the layers come together nicely in the finish.

147,1160,chilidog,4.5,"I've been waiting on thisone for the perfect winters day, well, we've had a few. I pulled this 04 from the basement where its been resting six plus months. Used a Stone pint glass. It poured black as nite, with a one inch tan head that faded to a thin film rather quickly. The aroma of dark bakers chocolate & cold coffee hit the nose with a tickle of alcohol. The taste carries that chocolate coffee with the alcohol in full notice to help warm things up. Other flavors are roasted malts, and dark fruit. The mouthfeel was abit softer than expected, perhaps carbonation finds it way to help soften. Drinkability is good as a sipper or to share as a desert beer. I found I enjoyed this Imperial more-so than even the porter. IMO",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,96

I can stand there a few minutes to let my eyes adjust but it does no good. Thats the colour of this beer. The head is a beautiful tan brown. Dense and creamy. Leaves decent lacing on my glass too. The aromas are dominated by malt. Hints of coffee adn blueberries but most of all the maltiness. The taste is rich and balanced. Malty with a nice hop finish. Suprisingly little aftertaste. Taste is a mixed blend of coffee and choclate and some nuts mixed in there too. I cant detect the high ABV in the taste of this beer. I had high expectations expecting to be disappointed since I dont usually like high abv beers but this one blew me away in pretty much every respect. A slight alchol burn in the finish, but a kick ass beer. One of my favorites now for sure. Too bad I cant get it here.

147,1160,dauss,4.25,"Presentation: Standard 22oz. silk screened brown bomber. Funny story on the back about how you might think drinking this beer is committing sin. On the front it says: ""Limited Early Summer 2004 Release. Bogartski while you can..."". Lots of weird uses of the word ""K"" such as ""Produckt of USA, Komrad"" and ""Bottle Konditioned"". 10.8% ABV.  Appearance: This is jet black, and completely opaque. A head struggles to form, even with a stout pour. Poor retention, no lace whatsoever.  Smell: Sweet-port like, lots of dark chocolate, coffee, dark fruits, and alcohol.  Taste: Tons of roasted malt. Coffee, lots of chocolate. Sweet and very thick. Alcohol very present, medium hop bitterness throughout.  Notes: Very tasty. Even though the alcohol content is very high, it surprisingly doesn't have the burning solventy alcohol taste, but it is very strong in the taste. Definitely a slow drinking beer.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,96
147,1160,rousee,4.22,"A- black 2mm head fades to wispy foam within seconds. Very nice lace on sides of glass.  S-Very malty. Slightly sour but very rich and robust. Quite a complex smell. It has some strong alcohol phenolic qualities but they are not as apparent on the tongue as the nose.  T- Smooth and robust--mild carbonation. Some coffee/chocolate profile and a nice maltiness. Not too different from the Sinebrychoff porter I just had. This one is not quite as good though--not to take anything away from it, this is a fine tasting beer--it is just a little rougher around the edges than the Finnish one I mention.  MF-Nice and dry. Has the velevety mouthfeel that I really like.  D- Too much strong alcohol taste to say it is very drinkable. Yes its smooth--yes its good, but one bomber is plenty.  02/26/08--trying again and all the things I said before still apply now. Cant say its improved much but it didnt need much improving.I think the alcohol heat is a little more noticeable than it was last time I tried this but the bottom line is this is one fine beer.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,96

This one comes out black as night with a small tan head sitting atop the viscous looking fluid. The nose is huge. Full of big dark fruity tones, chocolate and hints of black licorice. Wow. The flavor is a blast of alcohol soaked chocolate followed some figgy notes, finishing slightly coffee. I think I am in love. This is great, but it remember the tap being even better. The feel is huge thickness, almost a syrupy residue on the tongue after swallowing. Drinkability is not bad at all for a big ass beer that is thick anc big on flavor. Stone, you do good work.

147,1160,orbitalr0x,4.7,"Been waiting to try this one for some time now. Empties the bomber black as eternal night with a deep dark tan head that rises up to greet me. Thick, syrupy pour...black hole...there's no escaping...help! Bitersweet chocolate, roasted coffee & nuts, black licorice, dark fruits and burnt grains...a cornucopia of sensual delight for the nose. I enjoy just smelling this brew. (I was sniffing so much my fiance wondered what the hell I was doing.)  Incredibly thick roasty coffee and chocolate chewiness rushes over my palate. Hints of black candy licorice, raisins and nuts along with some nice fruity notes. Alcohol singes the back of my palate, but melds in well and enhances the experience. A damn fine imperial stout...I love it.  Smooth, creamy, huge mouthfeel...it doesn't get any better than this! Velvety smooth. Drinkability is hindered slightly by the big ABV, otherwise this is an awesome brew to have on a cold night..wonderfully crafted and will warm ya up nicely. 100% recommended.

147,1160,santoslhalper,4.7,"Early Summer '04 release.  Appearence: The pour is kick-ass. A deep black with a dark, dark brown head. Loads of carbonation roll up the side. Evil.  Smell: Now that's a stout! Chocolate and coffee are the initial smells, with a giant alcohol undertone. Smells just like a stout should. Excellent.  Taste and Mouthfeel: An explosion of flavor in the mouth. Tart and deep with a phenomenal amount of alcohol. This is very close to what could be the perfect ""big beer."" Monstrous chewy mouthfeel with a giant lingering aftertaste. The beer gets deeper and thicker as it warms a bit. Odd. But not bad at all.  Drinkability and Overall: This beer is the definition of a BIG BEER. It's huge! Everything about it is big, and powerful, and downright evil. The only thing about this that makes it hard to drink is ABV, but I still love it. Another great Stone offering. Try this.  GClarkage..

147,1160,Crotor,4.76,"I live for beers like this.  Pours thick and black into my tulip glass. It looks so thick it reminds me of how they use Elmer's-type glue in milk commercials to achieve those thick, ropey pours. This looks like black Elmers glue... As it settles in the glass, a dense, dark brown head rises, and sticks around for quite a while - surprising retention for a beer this big. I like that...  The aroma is big and roasty, with a bit of caremel going on in the back. Good, but not great. Really the only failing is that the aroma is unimpressive when compared to the beer's other aspects.  As I finally drink, there's a massive assault of roasty, chocolatey, espressoey goodness on my tongue. Behind it all there's just a hint of fruit (plum/raisinish). A hint of alcohol is evident, but i's not at all unpleasant. Other characteristics are a reseved bit of sweetness, and perhaps a little mustiness. Overall, the massive yet rounded taste profile is excellently articulated. How can a beer so big and so extreme also be so subtle? It's masterful...  This is without a doubt, the best, and most drinkable RIS I've ever had the pleasure to encounter.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,96
147,1160,oxmasterscream,5,"Bottle courtesy of mrpicklerelish, big up.  Appearance: Dark, dark, opaque black-brown with a cocoa-brown head that fell to just a ring.  Smell: Wow. First, full-on raisins and spice. Then intermingling aromas of unidentifiable dark fruits, molasses, chocolate, burnt brown sugar, burnt sticky buns. Unbelievable. Very similar to an aged Storm King Stout. The benchmark for what an imperial stout should smell like. Perfect.  Taste: Yow. I can barely put this into words. Bittersweet dark chocolate, sweet but burnt raisins, prunes and other dark, ripe fruits, wickedly spicy, burnt syrupy pastries, with a mouth-drying, bitter finish that's preceded by an enormous burn from the hops and high ABV. Like its smell, perfect. I feel privileged to have tried this.  Mouth: Full, silky and smooth. Light carbonation keeps the tongue awake. ABV warms the tongue nicely and gradually. Exactly how one of the best should feel.  Drinkability: So amazing that I was in a constant battle with myself over whether or not I should keep taking massive gulps or sip it quietly. It's the kind of beer that grabs your attention and blocks out the rest of the world for you. I had but bottle and now it's gone.

147,1160,GClarkage,4.82,"11/26/04- Purchased at Bevmo in San Mateo, CA  Appearance- Pours a very black and thick used motor oil color. Head is brown and about 3/4 inch. Not very much lacing to be had though.  Smell- Mmmmm, chocolate and heavy burnt coffee malt.  Taste- Damn, this is the best stout I have ever tasted. I need to re-taste Rasputin on tap because it's been over a year since I have had it. But, I'm pretty sure this tops it. About the perfect combo of chocolate and coffee I have ever had. Nice hops finish in the background.  Mouthfeel- Perfect except it's a tad too carbonated to me which makes for a slightly less than smooth swallow.  Drinkability- Brutally drinkable! This may be my highest rating to date. From the first sip I didn't want it to end. Too bad I had to share a 22 oz bomber with two other people. Only 8 oz at the most for poor me :( The alcohol comes through pretty hard at the end. Already noticing a tinge of buzz after my 8oz. Fricking phenomanal beer. Like drinking a smores with a cup of coffee. But minus the marshmallow and plus the buzz. Sounds good to me.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,96
147,1160,CSquared,4.7,"22 oz bomber  Appearance: Midnight black, no light getting thru this one. Dark brown head is beautiful, but goes fairly fast, leaving a mild lacing.  Aroma: Dark malt nose, burnt notes, chocolatey then turns into more of a toffee smell.  Taste: Starts fairly sweet, with wonderful chocolate notes. A very slight alcohol presence appears, but amazingly negligible for an 11%er. Mild hop presence perfectly balanced. Bittersweet finish that lasts. My favorite impy to date, surpassing storm king.  Mouthfeel/Drinkability: Silky smooth, with a huge body. Amazing drinkability for an impy stout.

147,1160,niknar,4.78,"Stone has quickly become my favorite craft brewer. Here is just one reason why:  Pours out a very thick, very black color with a modest (but far from understated) head. The average coffee is not as thick and black as this lucious offering. The head is colored something akin to the froth created on the top of a steaming mug of hot chocolate - milky brown and bubbly. Well developed lacing as the head settles and consumption begins. The aroma is very complex. Distinctive notes of coffee, chocolate, faint hops, and rich roasted malt. The flavor is immaculate. Initially, this offering strikes strongly with roasted malts, caramel malts, and coffee / toffee flavors. Followed closely behind is an assault of hop bitterness that lingers on the roof of the mouth. The finish is dry and bitter at the back of the mouth, with the sweet reminiscences of heavy malts left behind on the sides and front of the tongue. Also of note is the presence of alcohol in the taste... 10.8% shines through! The mouthfeel is excellent... something similar to eating a ham sandwhich... perfect! Drinkability of this offering is limited slightly by the high alcohol and thick substance of its body. However, don't let the numbers fool you... a six-pack of this stuff would probably give an elephant a run for its money!  Enjoy! Highly Recommended!",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,96
147,1160,Globetrotter,4.8,"Picked up a bomber at the Whole Foods Market in Arlington, VA. Oh, if only something like this were actually available in Russia!  Pours black as coal under a 1.5 finger burgundy head that lingers forever, with good thick lacing. A beauty to behold. The nose is treated to strong roasted malt sensations, while the mouth is mildly carbonated with a very thick body. Luscious. There is lots of roasted malt flavor, with good hops backing leaving a pronounced dry impression. There's sweet caramel here, too, but it is quickly blown away by the smokey nut and dark chocolate, which in turn yields to espresso. Ideal blend of bitter and sweet in the aftertaste. This is a truly great stout.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,96

Russian Stout pours an opaque onyx. It's delightfully thick, with a textured but continuous velvet feel. The aroma is mild but complex, with chocolate, coffee, and roasted malt notes. The layered flavors in this brew are delightful. There's a sharp citrus hop spice to balance the incredible chocolate sweetness. Coffee and burnt malt notes contribute favorably. I'm not sure where stone hid that 10+ ABV. the slight alcohol in the finish is remarkably subtle. Now, I wouldn't call it a summer brew, but the early release encourages some aging and mellowing.

Slightly alcoholic in the finish, but not objectionably so. This is a thick beer, clinging to the tounge lest you forget about it.

This is a beautiful looking beer that should be served in a nice tulip glass or snifter. The aroma of this brew is intense and consists of black kurrants, chocolate, espresso, alcohol, bourbon, vanilla, caramel, and more!

147,1160,germaniac,4.8,"This is an awesome beer. Pours out darker than Martha Stewarts heart. Minimal head, just enough to lace the glass with it's passing. A huge roasted malt smell is the first thing to assault the nose, followed by a expresso/ coffee scent. Very nice. Yes, there is a big taste of alcohol, with just a little sweetness thrown in with the malted goodness. Raisins and plums provide a nice tartness that rounds out the flavor extravanganza. This is beer that demands you to pay attention to it. Raw around the edges, perfection just may lie within. It can only get better with age, as far as I'm concerned.

147,1160,ddarden,4.6,"Early Summer 2004 Release. I am sitting on a cool rainy day and thought this would be a great day to try my first 22 oz bottle of Stone Imperial Russian Stout. This beer poured out a sweet black color with a nice brownish head. The smell is heavy with roasted malt and hints of the strong alcohol. The first taste is a perfect follow-up to the appearance and smell; roasted malt, warming alcohol, heavy chocolate and java overtones. This is great sipping beer to cap off any day. This is not the beer I would normally drink on a daily basis, but one that I would seek out again for a good occasion.

Pour when served was the color of black gold. The coffee crema style head was a nice touch, and lasted through-out the glass. Aroma wise, the roasted notes were the most apparaent (think java), but I also picked up some plums as well. Mouthfeel wasn't quite over the top full, but definitely chewy. Tastewise, the hot alcohol kept one in check while admiring the roasted java meets tootsie roll in the taste. Very good, well made, but damn dangerous at that abv.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,96
147,1160,bditty187,3.98,"Spring 2004 Release  Black. It is black in the middle and around the edges. Even when I held it to a light there was no penetrating the dense liquid. Impressive. The head was a lovely brunette color. At the apex the tightly compacted bubbles reached about a half finger in height. The head retention was respectable; it faded to a skimpy cap, kind of naked in the middle with a bubbly collar. In my goblet this beer does look damn imposing. There was no subsequent lacing, which can be expected I suppose. Still it is a good-looking beer. The first sniff of the nose was a massive explosion of malty goodness. I set the glass down and exhaled. Ah, Imperial Stout. Only a prodigious stout could be so malty. I went back for more. Raw alcohol, completely unabashed, it is forceful and hot. Did Avery brew this? Thankfully there are *enough* ripe, dark, and tropical fruits to play with the heat for a while anyway. Continually smelling the beer after I poured it from the bomber, wore my tolerance of the booze smells thin. If the alcohol had a more complex aroma then, say, rubbing alcohol I might I have been more inclined. By the finish the beer returns to a chewy, sweet, coffee and chocolaty array of olfactory pleasing aromas. Random hints of burnt caramel. Plums. There is also just a tickle of sugar. Potency is bold enough, I want my big beers to scream; this one talks very loudly. Inviting even with the rubbing alcohol smells. The palate is warm and damn yummy. There is excellent depth. Sometimes alcohol heat detracts from the overall enjoyment of a beer. Rarely does a raw burn add welcoming effects. In this case the alcohol works, the heat adds depth to the flavors. Also it acts like a connective tendon between the muscular malt and the delicate fruit. I guess calling the fruit delicate is a bit of an understatement as it does come across dark and tropical with plums, raisins, peaches, and even some apples. Random spiciness. The meat and potatoes of this beer are the malts. Big, chewy, evil, tastes like coffee (spiked with brandy), chocolate that is semi-sweet, kind of chalky. I have nothing to complain about with the palate it is charming in an angry kind of way. Not perfect but very good. Imperial stouts should be bold. This one is. A little too raw? Id buy that. Still, it is very tasty, very complex but its lacking a little magic I think. Id like a little more roast, more char, and less warmth. Full/medium-full in body, amazingly creamy, silky mouthfeel. It is like swallowing liquid velvet. Low carbonation but it is fitting for this beer. I really like the mouthfeel. Maybe it could be a tickler fuller (I guess I want to drink motor oil) and a little less hot. But the absolute smoothness cant be ignored. It is drinkable, it needs to be sipped and savored. A tickle too raw maybe a theme is developing here. It is a very good Imperial Stout. Not perfection, though. More malt depth and less alcohol would be ideal. This beer makes me want to eat grilled meat and hearty cheese! I need to send a huge Thank You to meathookjones for sending me this long sought after beer. A damn good nightcap ZZZ I dont feel the need to hurry back and drink this one again",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,96
147,1160,PSUDREW,4.5,"Very, very impressed with this beer. Dunno what it is, but this imperial floats my boat.  It pours such a dark, imposing black. I mean black. No light can show throught this F$%&*!. I mean, it is quite impresive. Aside from the color, it has a thick rocky head, that doesn't disaptes and play so well into this beer.The alchohol is subtle, but present in every part of this beer, from it wild nose, to its sweet finish. Mouth feel is very very rich, and almost can feel the punds being packe on. Still so satifiing.  Such a good good beer. I cannot say enough god things, go get some, whether by trade or whatever, go get some. Thanks nvsblman  thanks",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,96
147,1160,Skidz,4.97,"Late Spring 2003 release. Bottle obtained from a trade with ppoitras. Part 2 of the 4 part Stone tasting with my bro.  Pours out a viscous jet black, like old motor oil and sits 100% opaque in the glass with a small dark tan head that sinks into the pit of darkness below, leaving no trace.  Aroma is super chocolately with mild coffee and a hint of raisins. Alcohol penetrates from beneath the sweet and malty build.  Tast is as rich as rich can be. Devilishly sweet with monster amounts of chocolate. Coffee-like bitterness moves in and ends with a mild pleasant bitterness. Some traces of raisins and a hint of smokiness. Alcohol gives a good showing. Some dark fruits also play their part in the delicious brew.  A million dollar smoothness...like butter made from a golden cow! Low in carbonation but adds to the creamy build.  A spectacular RIS, perfect for any occasion and makes a great night cap.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,96
147,1160,IrishRedRock,3.78,"2004 edition, been sitting around my apartment for a few months but I think it's about that time. My most awaited of the 4 different Imperials I had here, and maybe my expectations were too high, but it's not the best of the ones I've had recently (Yeti was pretty kickass). Still, it's Stone, so it's still quite good. Here we go...  It's pitch black (duh). But the head hardly retains at all. As for the aroma, I feel like Kramer when he loses his taste buds and can't taste the Mackinaw peaches. ""I'm gettin' nothin' here, nothin!!"" Some mild traces of chocolate malt and alcohol...it is nearly 11% after all, but not much else. Flavor comes through a little better, with a surprising gush of juicy hops to start with, melding with the thicker, chocolate and dark fruit undertones which head into the *very* warming alcohol finish. The thickness of this brew does a little to hide the booze, but it's still pretty noticeable. Mouthfeel is rich, buttery, creamy, etc. You know what I'm talkin about here.  I'm a big fan of Imperials so of course I still like it, and it's still a good beer, but I am going to have to get a few more bottles for comparison. Maybe it's me, but I know Stone...they are an amazing brewery, which makes me think they can produce an amazing Imperial Stout. This is good, but it falls short of amazing.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,96
147,1160,Shaw,4,"I bought a bottle of the 2004 vintage while visiting San Diego and brought it back to Florida to share with my friends.  This is a very approachable Imperial Russian Stout, much more so than Rogue's, which I must admit I like a little better. Stone's take is a lot creamier and smoother. Stone keeps the roasted malt flavors on a tight leash while Rogue lets them run wild.  I find it interesting that Stone releases a beer I would think of as a winter warmer in early summer. And while this beer certainly can be laid down, I see no need to. It's ready to drink now!",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,96
147,1160,thecoldesquire,4.59,"Wow! This is an excellent beer. This is the 2004 edition of this lovely brew.  Appearance: Thick and black, like motor oil. Watching this thick beer pour into the glass was amazing. Black as midnight. I have to knock points for having little head, actually almost no head.  Taste: When cold, you really don't notice that it is such a strong beer. As it warmed, you get a nice alcohol flavor. Hints of chocolate and coffee. Very good.  Mouthfeel: Creamy  Drinkability: surprisingly good for such a strong beer.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,96
147,1160,BadBadger,4.63,"This is a mighty fine stout. It pours a deep black, with beautiful brown foamy head. The smell is of sweet roasted malts. The taste carries on the malty wonder of the smell, nice roasted malts. A warm full and smooth mouthfeel. This is a very tasty stout and there is really no hint of the high ABV in either the aroma or taste. Definitely a beer to be searched out and enjoyed.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,96
147,1160,bigchris1313,4.5,"Appearance: Black as night. Black like a black hole. Black. White to light beige head, perhaps 1"" thick, but that could just be due to how I pour.  Smell: Mixture of chocolate, coffee, and a tiny hint of alcohol.  Taste: Chocolate. I've been a chocoholic all my life and this is simply the most choclatey brew I've ever had. It is like dark chocolate, bittersweet in nature. Some bitterness, but overpowered by some coffee and massive chocolate flavor. Perhaps I was (subconsciously?) only tasting what I wanted to taste, but this thing was amazingly chocolatey.  Mouthfeel: Something like whole milk, but without that mild oiliness to it. I like to joke with my less-enlightened buddies that they'd need a knife and fork to navigate the glass.  Drinkability: I don't really know how many of these things I could drink repeatedly, as this gem clocks in at 10.8% alcohol by volume. Although not the infinitely drinkable yet amazingly delicious perfection that defines Stone's IPA, this brew could be consumed for a good while.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,96
147,1160,bashiba,4.85,"Thank you chilidog for the chance to try this exceptional beer. Wow what can I say that already hasn't been said, but this beer is fantastic. From picking up the beautiful Gargoyle Bottle to the last drop a great experience.  Appearance - Pours a thick black color which no light penetrates with a small coffee tan colored head that continues to lace down the side of the glass until the very bottom.  The smell is not quite as strong as I would have guessed but there are hints of Blackened Malts, Espresso, Chocolate, Kurant, Anise. All fighting to escape. Great.  The taste is simply WOW - what an explosion of flavor. I am instantly hit by the power of the Sweet Black Malts and a fruity Kurant Flavor. It is quickly followed by a strong Anise and Coffee flavors. There is some nice hoppiness at the end along with the nice warming alcohol notes, but overall the flavor is dominated by the amazing complexities and not so much the hops or malts. Very Cool.  The Mouthfeel is a combination of a creamy fuzziness with a nice warming charachteristic. Great  The drinkability is fantastic, I got the bottom of the glance and imediatly wanted more. The only bad thing I can say about this beer is that I can't get it on a regular basis and now that makes me very sad because I want another.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,96
147,1160,koolkat,4.45,"This beer pours a nice thick syrupy black liquid that almost sticks to the glass as you pour it. I know Im in for a treat when I finally get to drink this. The flavor dosent dissappoint, it is very powerful wich much more of a malt tone than I expected from Stone given their other beers. The hops are well prononunced yet not overly powerful like in Arrogant bastard. All in all a very nice beer, but I doubt many people could handle this as a session beer it would just overwhelm you.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,96
147,1160,Padron4KM,4.7,"Pours a thick black with a decent sized coffee brown head. minimal lacing. Veiwed from above it took on an almost port-like apperance (dark with a clear layer on top) Aroma was dark fruit(prune,plum) coffee, liquorice, alcohol. flavor was rich, thick coffee (espresso) unsweetend chocolate, with a touch of bitter/sweetness in the finish.

147,1160,goose114,4.73,"Pours a light-destroying black with a chocolate milk colored, finger-and-a-half head. Roasted malt, chocolate, and coffee notes explode from the glass into my nostrils, held up by a stiff hop bitterness. Taste is perfect, with a wonderful burnt chocolate flavor taking center stage and supported subtly but expertly by roasted coffee goodness and balancing hop bitterness. A wonderfully viscous mouthfeel highlighted by the spicy alcohol notes.  The simplest description that comes to mind is a perfect cross between Victory's Storm King and Brooklyn's Black Chocolate Stout -- two personal favorites in the style. A nearly perfect imperial stout that leaves you in awe of what can be accomplished with malt, hops, yeast, water, and talent.

The aroma was clean without having any defects but it was hard to pick up much except a little roasted barley and alcohol. The taste was very nice as the rich malty sweetness was balanced very well with the sharp contrast of the roasted grains. The hops made a brief appearance right before being run over by a warm alcohol and then finishing clean with a touch of roasted flavor lingering. Very drinkable though not a session beer as one bomber is enough to get a nice buzz.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,96

Very thick reminds me of crude oil like they say on the bottle.  I wish they made cologne that smelled like this stuff it smells amazing like chocolate, burnt coriander, and molasses. Very pleasant and thick smelling.  The taste of this beer just makes my mouth water. It tastes very complex of chocolate, soy sauce, coriander, and black patent malt, with alcohol on there to back it up and more malt also with a hop edge in the back with the after taste.  I can drink this beer even if it is warm although it would probably take me 2 hours to down it.  Overall it is a really good Russian imperial stout. Stone is once again amazing!

But the head is a bit skimpy even when roused.  Nose is quite nice. Definately get the roasty toasty scents and maybe a bit of hops, but I also get some nice dark chocolate dank cherry cake notes and some breadyness to boot.  Taste is a little disapointing. Definately the massive roasty toasty notes backed up by massive hop bitterness and flavor, some smooth caramel crystal malt flavors there as well and a touch of wineyness but finishes a bit chalky, like some of the second tier Imperial stouts I've tried like Great Lakes. Little disapointed.  Nice mouthfeel. Very appropriate, but not quite perfect.  Pretty drinkable for such a big beer, but awfully bitter after a couple sips. Woudl like something a little smoother.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,96
147,1160,daledeee,4.75,"It's tough at the top. The differences are sometimes only slightly discernable. A recent trip to the Chicago area afforded me a chance to try the Stone Imperial.  A 22 oz bottle. It took me an hour to relish the rarified brew.  It poured a beautiful black, and I mean BLACK. The head was nice with a tawny color. At the end of the pour the last drops of the brew danced across the head defying gravity. I knew then this would be a magical experience.  The aroma is unbelievable. Coffee and chocolate with malt. This is the best smelling beer I have ever enjoyed.  The flavor of this drink is worth savoring for as much time as you have. It is so well balanced and tasty that you will want one every day. The flavors burst free when they hit the palate. A perfect balance of chocolate, malt, coffee and hops. The aftertaste is just as fulfilling. A little more bitter at the end.  I have only given a few 5's across the board. There are a few categories for this brew that deserve 5+. So enjoyable, so drinkable. And yes, a good buzz. Nice high alcohol content.  NOTE: A few years since the first review. I have since tried many imperial stouts.

It was so damn good, I'd have to say it was the best stout I'd tasted thus far.  Dark as all get-out and thick. Rich smell , just made me smell a few times and enjoy just that. Mouthfeel was very thick and deep. Drinkability was really good. This was thick, not very strong and made me think I could have more than one despite what this beer can do to you.  Taste? Very very complex, typical like a stout but not with the heavy alcoholic taste like most imperials.

Taste is unique for an imperial stout. Very fruity, with undertones of coffee, malt, and cinnamon. Alcohol has an impact on the aftertaste, and burns the throat slightly.

Nose has a bit of alcohol which was preceded by notes of chocolate and coffee... mmm... roasted malts. Taste is simply wonderful, lots of chocolate and slight bitterness. A slight sensation of alcohol follows but it is pleasant and warming, not strong at all. Mouthfeel is gloriously thick. Drinkability is decent for a brew of this strength.

Mouthfeel & Drinkability-- this is where it shines.. very very easy to drink.. dangerously so... the low carbonation level makes it go down easy, and the alcohol is hidden well.

Taste: Smooth silky coffee and chocolate that is followed by a brandy flavor that blends into a bitter sweet chocolate finish.

147,1160,crookedhalo,4.62,"Late Spring 2003, Bogartski while you can, 9.47% ABV edition. Pours opaquely deepest brown to black with a medium brown head that fades into thin lacing. French roast coffee, scorched malt, dark fruit, toffee, raisin, black strap molasses and a big alcohol punch prevalent in the nose. Throw a lot of hops in there, too, but they're trying to keep their head above water like a mafia victim with concrete shoes that gets lost in the riptide. Malty, floral and sweet, with residual flavors complementary to that of almost any stereotypical dark ale; coffee, chocolate, dark, plummy fruits. But this monster does have some leafy and grassy hops manage to poke its head out like a prarie dog seeing if the coast is clear. Oops, the coast isn't clear, here comes the black patent malt monster. There's a mineral and salty background, not unlike Le Coq.

This aroma is something to remember: alcohol, coffee, burnt-roasted grains, ripe berries, and a solvent-like sharpness. Bitterness and graininess mix with alcohol in the taste. The alcohol is mouth-numbing after a while, and there's a slickness that starts in the mid-tongue. The finish is bitter and lingering.

147,1160,Zorro,4.28,Pours a pitch-black brew impervious to light that is darker than a Lawyers soul.  Smell is sweet malty and fruity with a solid coffee background.  Taste is a bit sweet and strong but not harsh. Lots of fruity flavors with a strong black coffee flavor that beats back the sweeter flavors.  Mouthfeel is milkshake thick.

Alcohol, dark fruits like raisins, coffee and a light caramel sweetness.  Full bodied and very smooth but with a light prickly carbonation. The alcohol is very noticable, but this is a fresh bottle. A light sweetness and dark fruitiness comes up next. I would describe the flavors as burnt raisins or plums, something along those lines. It finishes with a dark, lightly sweet coffee flavor and leaves behind a mild alcohol flavor with weak molasses-like flavor.  This is a delicious IRS. I only got one bottle but next time I'll grab a few so I can see how it ages. Top 5 of all the beers I've had.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,96
147,1160,BrewMan13,4.78,"Oh my, when I saw this at my local beverage center for the 1st time, I snapped up 3 bombers on reputation alone, never having tasted it before. And am I glad I did! Nice blacker than midnight appearance. Head is very dark brown and recedes slowly. Some lacing. A small amount remains for most of the drink. Taste is very intense. I cant describe the flavors as well as some others have, but I pick up on heavy chocolate malts initially, some roasted malts midway through. Both flavors seem to continue and are accompanied by a slight alcohol flavor at the end of the finish, along with a hint of hops. Everything is so intense and complex, I know I am missing something. Just try it and taste for yourself. I feel that a great IRS should have a flavor so intense that it drowns your tastebuds and leave them gasping for air by the end. This one follows that exceptionally well. While it may not be sessionable, I've been craving my 2nd since I had my 1st, a very fine accomplishment, which is why the drinkability score is so high. I think that the fact that a beverage this dark, flavorful and complex and another beverage so light and flavorless as Coors light are both ""beer"" (I use the term loosely in regards to coors light) is proof enough that there is more variety of flavors in beer then wine.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,96
147,1160,rajendra82,4.53,"The beer looked very dark brown and fully opaque with a nice foamy cream coffee colored head. The look was closer to a regular stout than the inky black appearance that some other Imperial Stouts assume. The aroma was very roasty and chocolaty, with strong notes of anise and licorice. The taste was most impressive, with an intoxicating combination of fruits, coffee, chocolate, and bitter hops that all attempted to squash my taste buds into submission. The alcohol was quite evident in its peppery warmth at the back of the throat that traveled way down into the stomach. There is no attempt at subtlety here at all. This is a monster of a beer that makes you dare to drink up. Many thanks are due to the fine BA, FormalKid for this bomber.

147,1160,dmbfrat420beers,4.23,"Presentation - 20004 22 oz. bomber with plenty of hilarious jewels to grace their bottle.  Appearance - Very dark with ruby red tint that runs along the edge. First glass I poured (perhaps a bit too lightly) lacked any decent head. The second was much better with a small, albeit tasteful dark tan head that left a nice, light lacing on the glass, but all head dissipates pretty early on - I wonder if this bottle was a bit off, will have to try some others to be sure.  Smell - Seems like too much alcohol on the nose. Otherwise, a bit of grassy hops, a bunch of roasted malts, and something that just sort of clears the sinuses. It's strong for sure, but not as great as its flavor, in my opinion  Mouthfeel - For me, this defines a chewy, full-bodied feel. Very low on the carbonation, but fine otherwise  Taste - there is just so much going on here and I can see why it gets such high ratings. Where to start...Lightly sweet malts start it out in combo with some of the grassier hop taste. Gives way to a delightful roasted malt flavor that lingers for a long time. So interesting because even though the roasted flavor is so strong, you can always detect a strong west coast hoppy bitterness at the back of the mouth and on the lips. A very interesting balance. Also noticed a strong currant taste with a dose of alcohol on the palate and warming the throat. Ends with the aforementioned roasted maltiness and some spicy flavors to top it off. It is hard to do justice to the complexity of this beer.  Drinkability - I haven't had trouble finishing this beer, but it was slow process and would dread doing 2 in a row. While I think this is amazing in terms of flavor and craftsmanship, it is no session beer.  Conclusion - Quite an interesting brew to try and I look forward to several more. Something to have over or after a meal with friends, but too heavy in alcohol and flavor to consume in large quanties. Make sure you read the bottle, komrads.  Thanks to AleOha for the bottles.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,96
147,1160,WetCoaster,4.43,"2003 release.  Appearance: This is, without question, the most dense beer I have ever encountered. In daylight it's as black as coffee; held against a 100-watt bulb, only a tiny line of mahogany appears. The head is thick, rocky and as brown as a Connecticut shade cigar wrapper. The fine carbonation fights to the surface with great valor. Among the kings of stout, this is surely Elvis.  Smell: Huge surprise--deep waves of dark fruit and chocolate, a massive nose.  Taste/Mouthfeel: This is the 1600 SAT score of Imperial stout; it's got it all right. Immediate rum raisin and molasses. Chocolate and a subtle nuttiness emerges. The finish brings the bittering hops and drys it up, with perhaps a bit of smokiness. Alcohol warmth, but no burn. The mouthfeel is full and a bit sryupy, but the carbonation kicks just enough to keep it alive.  Drinkability: Well, let's be honest here. It's a thick as tar and almost 10 percent alcohol, no one's going to session this guy. You'll certainly enjoy the time you have with it, though.  Nothing but net for Stone on this one. This is about as regal as Imperial stout gets. Benchmark beer.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,96
147,1160,twilight,4.66,"Pours black as midnight oil with no head and lacing that lines the sides of the glass before sliding down into the muck. Still, looks like it would suck up surrounding light like a black hole. Smell is alcohol and plum/raisins, kind of like a belgian strong ale. I think I would have expected more of the roastiness to come through, but it's partly because of the taste. The taste is bitter, roasty sourness. My roommate *hated* this one, leaving me to drink the entire 22 by my poor little self. Awww. An initial taste of maple syrup giving way to a bourbon-like bite lessening to this sour bitterness of roasted malt and ending with a coffee finish on the tongue lingering and lingering and lingering. Until the next sip where you get to experience it all over again. This is one huge massive beer. Mouthfeel is thick and juicy with the beer being almost flat, you would think it was cask right out of the bottle. Geez. I guess I have to get a case of this for the next year and bust it out for special or not-so-special occasions. Mmmm...",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,96
147,1160,MrNuggets,4.35,"Sweet. Very sweet, brown sugar sweet. The fruits in this one are quite ripe. Pungent, full, huge! Exciting. This stout is exciting to drink! Dark fruit lingers for eternity.

I had a great time enjoying this beer.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,96
147,1160,BierManVA,4.42,"This is the 'early summer 2004 release' according to the bottle. Be careful boyz and girlski. This is one huge bier....  Thick black motor oil in appearance, infused with tiny carbonation. The aroma will nock your komrad's socks off at 6 feet. The taste is amazing. Strong alcoholic esters, wood, light vanilla, smoke, complex semi dry sweet fruitiness. Just massive.  At nearly 11%, it's best to take the advice of BA Tinustime and NOT wait till the last bier of the night for this...unless you want to crawl to bed.

147,1160,99bottles,3.55,"2004 version.  Appearance: Pours a dark brown-black color with a tiny head of tan that didn't stick around. What an imperial stout should look like, only without head. Retention issues. And yeah, it's served at the right temp.  Smell: Rich roasted malt character, slight bitterness, quite sweet scent also.  Taste: Um. Not bad, but not impressive. Mostly coffee beans, some cocoa powder, some sweet alcohol, maybe some fruit or fig. Overripe fruit taste and alcohol in the end. I'm very disappointed. An imperial stout is supposed to balance it's heavy malts with heavy hops. This is a Stone, correct? Where are the hops? Why does my beer taste like Guinness with the water distilled out? There's some bitterness in the finish, but the flavor of the hops isn't there. This is lame, and a letdown. I'm not saying it has to taste like Storm King, but it ought to meet the style requirements. I don't understand the difference between an American Double Stout (which I might buy this as) and an Imperial Russian Stout (which this calls itself ). Now, in all fairness, this is tasty and a nice beer. But it is not anywhere near Rogue and Victory and it is missing an important aspect of any Imperial Stout.  Mouthfeel: Not as thick as I might have thought, but it retains a depth and complexity becoming of an IS.  Drinkability: Fine. This one, if not for the limited release and price, could be enjoyed all year long. Not heavy or bold like some others. Goes down easy and is satisying. I wouldn't bother cellaring. It's not like anything is out of control and needs time to refine.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,96
147,1160,SeanChouffe,4.52,"2004 An opaque black color with a dark brown head. No obvious signs of carbonation. Head dies, and leaves a nice lace. Aroma is of roasted coffee and barley, malt, caramel and hops. Mouthfeel is full bodied and smooth with a light effervescent and sharp hop finish  rolls and bubbles off the tongue. Flavor is of malt, coffee and chocolate. Sweet at the start with a well balanced, but light (for Stone) hop finish.  An apparently simple beer with complex undertones with a nicely balanced combination of intensity and subtleness. A well crafted brew.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,96
147,1160,WesWes,4.2,The beer pours a deep dark black color with a thick frothy light brown head that fades to lacing. The aroma is good. It has a rich black malt and chocolate scent with a dry alcohol driven aroma! The taste is great. It has an intense black malt flavor with a dry warm finish. It goes down smooth and leaves a black malt aftertaste. The mouthfeel is fine. It is a full bodied beer with adequate carbonation. This is a fine Russian Imperial Stout. It has good aroma and better flavor; a good drinker.,Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,96
147,1160,rdrummer,4.6,"This was on tap at the Grey Lodge. It was a great find for Scoats. It pours a beautiful black with a dark brown, thick head. The lacing is huge. The aroma is of sweetish malt with a roasted chocolate and coffee smell. The taste is very rich, strong, and wonderful. There is a sweetness at the beginning that is almost sugary but it is quickly followed by a roasted malt flavor that overwhelms the sweetness. There are hints of caramel, coffee, and chocolate.  This is a thick beer and feels smooth in the mouth. I tried to have a second, and that was my downfall. This is not a beer to quaff all night.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,96
147,1160,mzwolinski,4.87,"Geezus, does Stone ever quit??? This beer is amazing. Pours black like a black hole with one of the darkest heads I've ever seen. As one would expect with this style, the head quickly reduced to a thin creamy lace which lasted about halway down the large 1 pt, 6 oz bottle.  And gawd, the aroma. Not much to add to the descriptions of others here. It's a *deep*, sweet, fruity malty aroma. Black currants, cherries, roasted coffee and alcohol -- though this last is surprisingly unobtrusive for such a potent view (9.47 ABV!)  The taste is wonderful, intense. Fruity and full-bodied. Very complex malt flavor accented by dark fruit and alcohol. Really, the best thing to do is look at the BJCP guidelines for imperial stout -- this beer fits them to a ""T"", with the possible exception of the noticeable hop flavor. The beer is hoppy, but as others have noticed, not quite enough for balance. But, hey, balance isn't what Stone is all about. Stone is about smacking you in the face with a style and telling you what you can do with their king-zize bottle if you don't like it. Good for them.  Really an amazing beer. The batch I got was the Spring '02 release. Bottle conditioned, so I' ve got a few tucked away in the cellar for aging. Can't wait to see how they mature.  04 batch: Still a great beer. The alcohol has been ratcheted up a point and a half, and the hops seem a bit more assertive than in 02. Also, there seems to be a more noticeable roasted malt character. All in all, this lends a bit more balance to the brew, but without detracting from it's big bruiser status. Yummy.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,96
147,1160,DaveGood,4.78,"I believe I have found my favorite Stout! I actually picked up 2 cases of this beer after my first sampling. It is the Limited Early Summer 2004 release.  The beer poured a rich dark black with a nice thick tan head that eventually left a nice ring around the glass for the duration of the tasting.  The aroma can best be characterized as roasted coffee with a hint of molasses.  The taste started with a very rich malt flavor that tasted like a combination of roasted coffee, caramel, and cocoa. It was balanced quite nicely by a hop-filled bitterness on the back end that lingered for a couple of seconds.  Mouthfeel is excellent with very slight carbonation and a very smooth feel.  The drinkability is exceptionally high, given the high ABV%. I could easily sit back and enjoy a couple of these in a session.  Kudos to Stone Brewing on another impressive brew! They just never seem to fail to impress with anything that I have tried from them!",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,96
147,1160,MuddyFeet,4.03,"Poured pitch balck with a burgundy tinge. There was no head, and this beer was so smooth that there was no lace on the glass either. There were very strong flavors of chocolate, coffe and hazelnut. So strong this beer was almost stifling rich and hearty. The finish is a waft of hazelnut coffee. Overall, a very smooth drink.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,96
147,1160,stirgy,3.93,"Had a pint of this at the Grey Lodge. Poured dark as night and was topped with one of the darkest heads I have ever seen, Looked like worn and dark leather brown. Sour licorice nose with deep and dark roasted chocolate notes. I detected some ammonia-like alcohol in there, which brought my aroma rating down a bit. Complex, burnt and rich. The taste is strong and very rich, with sweet molasses in the forefront and a small roasted bitter bite towards the finish. Theres touches of seared caramelized fruits in there, too. A very bold beer. Definitely worth a try. And for me, definitely worth a revisit in the future.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,96
147,1160,mobyfann,3.03,"Paid $4.75 for a 22oz. bottle labeled, ""Limited Spring 2003 Release""  The apperence is a nice thick stout with a deep dark brown body and a chocolate-mocha colored head that retains low but the thick lacing proved to be quite nice. The aroma is also nice, full dark coffee smell and hints of fruit, molasses and some other small stuff. So far a solid start... but  The taste wasn't all too spectacular, it was very thick, as thick as Bell's Expedition Stout, but not as strong. Absolutely no carbonation! The flavors in the taste were pretty good, but that's it. Too much syrup flavor as well. Mouthfeel was way too heavy for this, as I had problems wanting to finish up. The drinkability is non-existent as well; feels like it would be more suitable in taking shots of this and having a decent if that aftertaste.  Final Thought: This is the second strong beer I've had that has been too heavy, and really shouldn't be classified as a beer. I'll try it again but as of now I prefer Victory Storm King and Great Lakes Blackout over this any day...",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,96
147,1160,Hunter,4.68,"Between the high ABV and the previous reviews, I was a bit intimidated by this brew. Not enough to prevent me from opening the bottle, mind you...  I gave it time to warm up a bit, having stored it in the fridge a few days. Beer pours black as night, with a thin but lasting cocoa-brown head. If there's carbonation in there, you can't see it. For the style, it doesn't pour better than this.  Nose is one of alcohol first. Underneath that is chocolate, smoke, licorice, bareymalt.  Holy cow, is this stuff thick on the tongue! Almost like motoroil. The alcohol hits hard on the swallow, going straight through the throat and warming you to your toes. Bitter notes of coffee, licorice, and seems like little else. Aftertaste is sharp and dry.  This is only the second Russian Imperial I've had, Rasputin being the other. An intriguing style, one that seems to lend itself to dark, cold winter night even more so than regular stout. I'll be back in the store buying another one for the sake of storing it.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,96
147,1160,benmiliron,4.75,"Paid $5.99/bottle. Tastes of espresso, alcohol, roastiness, and a few things I can't quite pick out abound in this stout. A fantastic brew yet again by Stone. Alcohol is a bit overwhelming, but had I eaten something first that would have been alleviated.  This is fresh stout, so everything's a bit sharp yet, needs a few months to mellow a bit. I say grab as many as you can and wait to drink them until November.   Old 2003 review:  Dammit this is good stout! Not quite Storm King, but the beer reviews have it dead on as a close second. A very black stout, sweet, good malt, warming with the alcohol. A great winter beverage, but not the most drinkable. One 22 ounce bottle is plenty for me!",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,96
147,1160,rastaman,3.26,"Intense. Extremely thick, heavy, alcoholic mouthfeel. Not as roasty as i would have liked, some vanilla, and toasty/roasty/choc, quite citric and extremely hoppy, hop bitter. In fact the malts play a secondary role to the intensity of the hops, hops are quite citric/acidic/bitter. To be honest felt a little out of place for me, especially when mixed with the vanillin/choc malts, some vegetable stock and spice in there aswell. Very intense, and lots going on. Not quite my style, but cheers to Greg from Stone for giving me this opportunity to try it, Greg is an absolute legend.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,96

Dry chocolate and anise come wafting off the brew with a piney hop and alcohol bump to close it.  Body is thick, viscous, oily with dry chocolate tones dominating and cutting through with a bright hoppy bite in the finish accentuated by a roast and alcohol slap.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,96

147,1160,Billolick,4.6,"On tap at BT in NYC, sheesh, Stone is just crushing folks at the Tiger this week! Their I.S. hardly seemed like the appropriate brew for a warm summer night in the big town, but this one had to be tried and enjoyed. Poured black and gooey with a solid dark tan head. Coffee and chocolate in the nose. Body/mouthfeel is rich, thick and motor oil in feel. Big and bold flavors of roasted malt, coffee, raisins, prunes, chocolate. Finishes dry with uggodly hops. This stuff has the style nailed. Classic sipper. I imagine this stuff would age very well also.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,96
147,1160,imblane,4.87,"(2004 Edition) Just like the label says, ""Pours like Siberian Crude"" Black as the Ace of Spades, dark as midnight, literally a black hole in my Stone IRS glass. Pours with a nice two finger head, much like a good quality shot of espresso, but dissipates quickly with minimal lacing. Smell is black currants, dark chocolate, anise and finishes with a medium alcohol, simply marvelous! Taste is smooth toasty malt, prunes, espresso and raisins, with a warming alcohol bite and a mild acidity. Thick, creamy, belly warming good!! I am cellaring an entire case for this winter. This is a huge complex IRS that makes me feel truly ""Not Worthy""",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,96
147,1160,palliko,4.8,"An amazing stout!!! Pours out like crankcase oil, tastes like ambrosia. A full creamy head on a black coffee brew, with nice sticky lacing. An aroma of Arabica roasted coffee, raisin and molasses and a hint of the absolutley decadent 10.8% ABV hits your nose. With all the syrupy viscosity of cough syrup, (but none of the taste of cough syrup!) The body is solid with malt, and plenty of carbonation. The initial taste is a sweet maltiness backed by prune, and a molasses/caramel flavor that washes cleanly off your tongue. Toasted grain, coffee and dark chocolate prevails. The hops are so subtle as to be almost missed, but they are there. This stout will keep your taste buds guessing and fully engaged. Nothing dominates, all is in perfect harmony. The mouth is left with a taste that says, ""Please, Sir. I'd like some more!""",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,96
147,1160,beertaster13,4.94,"Best Stout I have ever had, hands down. Have had this 2003 bottle cellared for exactly one year. Pours a dark motor oil black with the darkest head I have ever seen, brown/tannish with dark black hues. Lacing sticks to the glass like it is possesed. Head not as thick as most stouts however. The smell is a sweet caramel/molasses with mocha beans. Hints of irish roasted coffee and toffee. Small tone of bananna as well. The taste was rich and full of mocha. The roasted malts was mixed with the powerful alcohol to create a monster. This is overpowering, but not to the point where it is undrinkable. A very full bodied stout, this stout is dangerous because you can drink alot because so good but I don't recommend it, it will mess you up.

This, like the others, did not disappoint. One of the creamier stouts i've had with a hint of chocolate, and incredibly smooth. This is the best stout i have had in the states, and probably only second ever for me to Guinness fresh at the brewery in Dublin.  Only knock may be the drinkability. This is a beer that can kick your ass if your not careful, and while i love that about it, not everybody can be a fan of that.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,96
147,1160,merlin48,4.69,"22oz bottle says late spring limited release, so I guess this one has had time to adequately age. Okay, here we go! Geeez, what a black pouring brew! No head to speak of. Nose is complicated and powerful. Coffee, tobacco, and a smoky campfire come to mind. Smooth as satin in the mouth, but very rich.Taste is complicated, and no doubt will get more complex as it warms up in the glass. I can already say that this is my favorite Stone.  As others have said, there's a lot going on here. Malt and hops disguise the alcohol very well. This is a very big beer and it looks like I'm going to be spending the next hour enjoying it. This is a classical imperial stout, and definitely a top ten overall.  Stone has done an excellent job creating such a complex yet rewarding imperial stout. The flavors just keep improving as it warms in the glass. You might not taste the alcohol, but after several minutes your brain and tummy let you know it's in there in spades. ""King of Spades"" would be an appropriate name for this black beast of a brew.  ""limited early summer 2004 release"" is a bit different from the 2003 version. Herbal anise is first to the nose, quickly followed by floral hops suggestive of wild roses on the vine. Roasted coffee notes become pervasive, but there is a pleasant aroma of fresh, concord grapes here that grabbed my attention. Low carbonation in the mouthfeel, with a port wine, vinous presence.  Appearance of the 2004 version was slightly disappointing. Not much of a head, and no lacing, but the body was jet black and opaque.  Very complex taste, with concord grapes and black licorice playing a major role. Espresso provides a nice roastiness, with bittersweet chocolate sliding in underneath. Rosewater lends a solid, floral hops essence.  Thick, rich, big, and sinfully drinkable. Old baseball glove leather and pipe tobacco emerge at the finish to contribute to the immense complexity. I cellared a bottle of this, as I think a few months aging will improve the 2004 release considerably. Be careful with this gigantic imperial Russian stout. Sit down, relax, and sip. This is going to give you a buzz by the time you finish it. I was disappointed not to find any English walnut nuttiness here, which I prefer in any stout, but with all the other characteristics going on here, this is just a minor, personal issue. This one is going to be quite an experience to enjoy after a few months in the cellar.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,96
147,1160,goodheflover1280,3.83,"This is a big stout! The intial appearance is used motor oil black. This stuff pours thicker than any beer I've seen, although I'm no seasoned pro so there may be beers that are thicker. The head is brown, the beer is black. The smell is like coffe/chocolate/mocha, but that big 10.8% comes through also. The taste is good. It leaves a sweet/bitter taste on the back of my tongue after the first drink, and that taste remains for quite some time. The mouthfeel is thick, as I presumed it would be by the consistency of the beer. When tried with sweets a certain mocha/coffe flavor hits my palate strong. They didn't mask the alcohol content very well with this, but that would be my only complaint. The beer is made for sipping with desserts (I tried mine with a nice, warm cinammon roll). Watch out, this beer with creep up on you. Overall a pretty good stout.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,96
147,1160,meathookjones,4.58,"22oz bomb from the 2004 batch. As I was pouring this I was reminded that my car needs an oil change. Wow this is thick stuff, and about as dark and opaque as a beer can get. An excellent dark tan/brown head arose from the snifter as this was poured and stuck around for a bit before leaving a lace as is dropped to a bubbly ring around the beer. First smells that hit me were the bittersweet dark chocolate and the roasted coffee. After that notes of fruits and a touch of alcohol could be found. The taste begins with a bit of sweetness followed by the chocolate and roasted coffee. You get hit with the alcohol around the middle of the taste but not in a negative way and some fruity flavors as well. A nice bitter finish and this one lingers around a bit in your mouth well after you drink it. Mouthfeel is HUGE, a small sip seems to fill the mouth and it is so rich and creamy feeling. This goes down extremely easy for the alcohol and overall hugeness of the brew. Awesome brew I couldnt be more pleased with the high expectations I had, highly recommended.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,96
147,1160,FormatKid,4.92,"--Bottled in 2004 edition.  I got the word on the net that this would be at Bacchus in Chattanooga, he received plenty of them so no sweat getting up there. I was very happy to be able to get this seasonal in Nowheresville, TN. Ive been dying to get my hands on ANY imp stout and I figure the one from Stone should do nicely.  Pours out into the goblet as expected, blacker than the darkest night. Not even being held up to direct light effects it, in fact it seems to suck the surrounding light into it like a black-hole. I can detect a bit of carbonation that is pressed right up into the glass that streams up to form a creamed-coffee color, brown head. You have to agitate it to get much of a head here. The head recedes rather quickly into a slick foamy layer on top.  A fruity smell is much heavier on the nose than I would expectsmells exactly likewild berries! Behind that a rich and deep roasted coffee/bitter chocolate smell is evident. It smells very delicious.  It leads off sweet and round, rolling back slowly across my palate. Middle is complex and beautiful, sweet fruitiness (berries); rich, roasted malts are very dense in the middle as well bringing a bitter chocolate character. This is accompanied by the first ever so slight twang of a slightly vinous alcohol flavor. The finish contains a nice sturdy dose of bitter hops and a strong shot of espresso. The vinous alcohol character is evident in the finish as well, but its presence is most known by the warmth spreading along my esophagus. A loooong, slow ride, and each sip feels like a mouthful. Licking your lips brings a reminder of the depth of the bitterness and beauty of this brew. Mouthfeel is heavy with very light play of carbonation, not quite as dense as I was expecting though.  Overall I am VERY pleased with my first Imperial Stout experience. I am glad I grabbed a couple of these to cellar and/or drink at will it will be hard to hang on to them, but Id like to see how one develops in a year or so.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,96
147,1160,sideshowrob,5,"2004 release, sampled as soon as the bottle had chilled.  Wow. To paraphrase Homer, this is a groin-grabbingly good Imperial Stout. Despite it being summer, a lot of breweries seem to be releaseing IRS's right now. While I haven't had a bad one from anyplace, the wide sample size really allowed the Stone example to shine through. Stone has very limited distibution on the right coast, but this puppy was worth the effort to find.  Appearance - none more black. Pure ink, with a golden brown head, reminicient of the burnt topping on a good creme-brulee. Smell was fantastic, lots of complex and well balanced notes waifting through; a slightly sweet overall note. Taste and mouthfeel were nearly transcendental. Again, the complexity and balance of this brew are what set it apart from other IRS's, all the coffee, roasted/smoky, currant and buttery notes are there, but none domminate. The zen-like qualities of this brew add to the enjoyment - despite it's high ABV, this brew does not go down like a five course meal. It's very easy to sip all night long.  All in all, I can't imagine how one could improve upon this beer, other than to make it a year-round, and have more cases cross the Rockies.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,96
147,1160,Gueuzedude,4.85,"2004 Bottling, Sampled June, 2004 Pours a pitch black color that supports a deep brown creamy head. Rich dark malt aromas waft from my glass, and are joined by notes of rum, burnt raisins, toasted biscuits, and a fair amount of grain character. The taste is intensely malty, and it almost has a saltiness to it. It is quite rich, yet somehow light for an Imperial Stout. There is a nice low level of malt sweetness here that balances the roast character, and each of these components is in some way muted by the interaction of the other. This beer is definitely rich and creamy from the front end to just before the finish, after this the burnt, roast malt flavors kick in and linger around a bit   2001 Bottling, Sampled June 2004 I have been saving this bottle for quite a while. Since I am going to be getting a case of the 2004 pretty soon I decided that now would be a good time to try an aged sample.  It pours motor oil black with a deep dark brown thin head. It is quite a clear deep brown color when held up to the light through a thin cross section. The aroma is ripe with notes of dried prunes, raisins, miso, and sherry. There appears to be at least some oxidation character in the nose. Underneath the other aromas I get hints of espresso, and roasted barley. The beer is still quite thick and viscous; it is fairly sweet up front with strong dark malt flavors just dominating my palate. This is incredibly tasty and has aged quite well in my closet. It is slightly oxidized, which adds more complexity to this already complex beast, there is a hint of sherry and some port notes, but none of the wet cardboard type oxidation flavors. It is quite fruity up front with notes of prune, raisin, and cherry. The finish is dry and slightly astringent from all of the dark malt notes that includes espresso, burnt toast, and roasted barley.  Did I say that this is damn tasty? It is quite smooth, and just slides viscously down my throat, coating my entire mouth with lingering flavors that refuse to dissipate entirely. I take another sip and the process begins anew. The middle of this beer is laden with smooth dark malt flavors, but the burnt/ roast character of this beer really only hits you at the very end. As this beer slowly disappears and as it continues to warm up, it just gets better and better. This beer is awesome right now; I am definitely going to have to age quite a few of the 2004 vintage.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,96
147,1160,Thrasher,4.57,"2001 edition. Well, I've been rash enough in the past to scoff at Stone's beers, and the imperial stout style, deeming both of them as not-quite-worthy of all the heaping praise bestowed upon them. With this 3-year-old Stone Imp. Stout (Russian was on the label at that point), I am eating my words, or should I say, drinking them. And they're delicious. It pours a dark, dark brown (just shy of black) with the smallest head, belying the alcohol content. Brilliant aroma of chocolate and vanilla. The flavor is obviously enormous, with huge portions of milk chocolate, dark chocolate, and vanilla bean. Undercurrents of smoke, spices, mocha, oak, wood, sherry, brown sugar, lightly burnt vegetables, slight anise, perhaps nutmeg, and black currants (misspelled on the bottle). Despite this bonanza of flavors, the beer managed to be somewhat mellow, and completely integrated in all aspects. None of the flavors jumped out and showboated; they all worked together as a team. However, the vanilla bean flavor was most noticeable on my palate, unexpected and supremely enjoyable. There was some lactic sourness throughout, and a big bitter coffee bite appeared towards the finish, but only for an instant. The mouthfeel was gloriously smooth, and not especially thick which surprised me. The alcohol was a big part of this beer, but perhaps from the aging it received, it was not at all out of place. The beer became thicker and stickier at room temperature. All in all, wonderful.

The smell was of chocolate, coffee, and maybe some spices thrown in. Taste is rich chocolate with hints of espresso, and fruit, like plum. Good hop bitterness. You can taste the alcohol presence. This is full bodied, no debating. One of the thickest beers I have ever had. Low carbonation, which is good in this case. Overall, GIVE ME MORE NOW! No doubt, one of the best beers I have ever had. This is imperial stout at its best. I will have this whenever I can get my hands on it!",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,96
147,1160,ColForbin,4.9,"Tonight I'm drinking a 22oz 2003 Stone Imperial Stout.  This beer is as black as black can be. I tried to shine a very bright halogen light through it to see what color I could see, but no light passed through. In fact, this beer seems to be sucking up all of the light that comes near it like a black hole. It pours with the slightest dark tan coating of bubbles that completely fades to a slight ring around the snifter I am drinking out of.  Aroma is extremely complex, raisins, sour cherries, caramel, burnt sugar, dark chocolate and some coffee notes are present. One of the most complex beers I have ever brought to my lips. Taste is more of the same, with the burnt sugar and raisin notes dominating and a bitter french roast coffee/bakers chocolate aftertaste. A warming alcohol feeling follows. This beer is incredibly thick - they compare it to Siberian crude on the bottle and I can't say I disagree. I think they should advertise this as the anti-Atkins - it probably has about 100g of carbs and every one of them is delicious. If I had to pick a beer to sustain me through a fast I would pick this one - it is as good a meal as I have ever eaten. Deserves every bit of praise that it has gotten.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,96
147,1160,LuckySevens82,4,"22 oz bomber, Limited Spring 2003 release. Pours an oil slick black with a small (very small) light brown head. No light can penetrate the liquid. There is a certain amount of lacing on the glass, but it seems it would be better if the head were more prevalent. Aroma is chocolate, BIG chocolate. Some coffee and hop florals are present as well. Taste is also chocolate, some coffee. This is a very smooth stout and I have hard time believeing that it is such a high ABV brew. This is almost as sweet as some of the milk stouts I've tried. Despite the sweetness and overall oil slick mouthfeel there is a measure of alcohol dryness to the finish. This is a good Imperial Stout, but definitely not one of my favorites. While I am glad I tried it, I will neither have this one again, nor seek it out. [Added clarification]: This brew is not available in my neck of the woods so I had to go through some effort to get it (this is why I would not seek it out). If it were available in FL, I would most probably get this one again.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,96
147,1160,Sammy,4.42,"smooth thick chocolate more than coffee. Like a porter. Roasty aroma - not the main show. Beautiful black. 2003 edition. A bit acidic tempered by some food. Bit of carbonation - perfect. Had a 2004 a year later, wasn't as great but will keep the rating. Had 2005, and dropped the rating to the average of the three-still very good. Thick though nowhere near the thickest RIS I have had. Had it in late 2006 and it was great roast and chocolate and winelike, thick and mellowed 2-year old bottle.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,96
147,1160,elmocoso,4.4,"Imperially Black. I kicked up a nice finger or two of head, clinging. Sweet Sweet mollassis, smoke in the nose chocolate - almost too sweet (d-.5) Full mouthfeel combo with taste almost too much for a full glass a sipper or after dinner drink. I was excited to try this one, and it did not let me down. I would like to see it in 7-12 oz bottles though.  cheers",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,96
147,1160,joshlara,4.55,"Bottled 2003, sampled April 26, 2004. Like the rest of us I have been waiting with great anticipation to try this beer. Finally found at Half Time, I wish I bought more than one.  Appearance: Pours an opaque black, no light can hope to get through this baby. A hard pour generates a beautiful rich brown head that dissipates to a thin collar. Thick as motor oil and black as night.  Smell: Another striking characteristic of this beer is the smell. Right after the pour strong aromas wafted from the glass. Chocolate, black currant, roasted malt, dark fruit, molasses, black cherries, bittering hops, and biscuity malt all make themselves known. The alcohol is also very noticeable. I don't always pick up the different aromas found in many bigger beers but I definately was able to find them here.  Taste: This is so thick and extremely complex. Multiple flavors push the palate to its edge. The flavors are very distinguishable. Chocolate and black currant begin the flavor barrage. Cherries are found somewhere in the middle. Toasted biscuit and nutty coffee flavors finish the extravaganza. There is a noticeable alcohol kicker accompanying the cherries and biscuit. Hops definately take a back seat which is surprising from Stone. Full bodied and massive, there is enough body to anchor the massive flavor and alcohol.  Overall: This reminds me a lot of Rogue's imperial stout. Huge, watch out as drinking this by itself can get you a little loopy. A meal in itself. I don't love most imperial stouts, too much dark fruit and black currant, but the Stone offering offers so much more. The alcohol presence is almost overwhelming but it ends up complimenting the multiple flavors nicely. I must say that I don't think I have ever had a beer with so much alcohol hitting you after every sip. Stone Imperial Stout is big enough to handle the alcohol. I will definately purchase this every time I see it. If you ever want to try a beer that lives up to the hype, this is the one. A great drinking experience.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,96
147,1160,jvajda,4.04,"Limited Spirng 2003 Release  Appearance: Jet black with a three finger, dark head. Has the 'meal in a glass' look. Smell: A little sour like it may have gone bad. Not a pleasant smell. Taste: Big roasted, chocolate, creamy taste. Maybe a hint of vanilla. Bitter finish. Alcohol comes out from hiding while it warms. Mouthfeel: Oh so creamy and milky, this one soothes the tongue. Light carbonation keeps it welcome. Drinkability: Wow, this one is one of the best stouts I've tried. Great for a dessert, but not too much more.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,96
147,1160,CBFanWish,4.73,"As black as the soul of death himself with a thick brown head that lasts for what seems forever. Aroma of toasted barley, malts, chocolate, coffee and caramel. The taste is of dark chocolate with caramel accents with wonderful hints of chocolates. I had to have this. I have had it for about a month, but I just couldn't wait any longer. When I poured it I was entranced by the deep black colour and thick frothy rich head. The head released a wonderful aroma that just warms the soul. I really enjoyed drinking this. A rich dark chocolate taste perfectly blended with coffee and caramel. Sweet yet bitter at the same time. Without a doubt, the best imperial stout I have ever had.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,96
147,1160,barleysangel,4.03,"2003 Vintage: This is a dark chocolaty brown beer with light brown head. No lacing really. It had barely any carbonation. The light does not penetrate this one. If you look down into the glass, youll see the abyss. The smell was a little fruity. The taste was also a little fruity and syrupy. There was a small aftertaste of alcohol. This beer was easy to drink; it went down the throat very smoothly.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,96
147,1160,bigbubba,4.48,"This review is of a cellar aged 2003 bottle, a little less than 1 year old.  It is very dark black with a small but dark brown head. The head didn't last, but there was plenty of carbonation. The smell was good but not real impressive.  The taste was incredible. There was a huge amount of malt but it was not too sweet. There was just enough hops to balance the malty sweetness and hide the alcohol. I noticed no bitter aftertaste, not that it wouldn't be welcome.  The mouthfeel was excellent. This is what an Imperial Stout should be! The drinkability was excellent, but beware, this stuff will put you on your ass if you're not careful.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,96
147,1160,watermelonman,4.05,"This poured like used motor oil. It's just plain black, without an ounce of head aside from the small ring around the inside of the glass. It leaves a delicate and small lace as it goes down.  The taste is outright powerful, with a hint of licorice. The alcoholic content is certainly present, although not overwhelmingly so. All things considered, it's a well-balanced beer. I've had some imperial stouts lately that didn't quite live up to the name, but this one definitely does not come up short. In fact, it could almost be toned down a bit.  This is one big stout.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,96
147,1160,NearerMyBeerToMe,4.57,"Spring '03 bottling. A strong pour results in just a few brown specks of bubbles and a tiny, dark collar. This is possibly the blackest, most opaque beer I have ever seen. A few swirls bolster up the collar a bit, but not enough to leave lacework. The beer doesn't really ""cling"" per se, except in a liqueurish sense... it really is more like motor oil, like a rolling, oozing mass of black protoplasm! Slippery smooth nosefeel initially suggests dried figs, port wine, and cocoa up front; then black currants lead the way into a finish with the bitterness of licorice and, with increasing warmth, the alcoholic presence of coffee liqueur. Over a root chord of massive chocolate malt, flavors intertwine melodically: sweet and figgy warming to spicily alcoholic; licorice, baking chocolate, coffee roasting away. Luxurious, velvety, melted ice cream mouthfeel, puckering, sticky, wow. Addictive drinkability. Just beckons to the senses. Like it's staring out at you from its glass on the table...  Yeah.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,96
147,1160,Rastacouere,4.34,"Blind Tasting, thanks Jazz88 Black hue with almost no head, just a light brown ring. Aroma proposes a solid malt profile of dark chocolate and possibly marshmallows, perhaps a touch of salt as well. Bold grapefruity hops accompany this all. Up to now it's nothing special. In mouth, the malt profile is huge. Very full-flavoured caramel and brown sugar together with a profound grapefruity hoppiness. The difference is.. it works here, very balanced and intense at the same time. You don't realize how hoppy this is before a few sips. Mouthfeel is excellent, silky and full bodied with low carbonation. My main critics are the almost absent fruitiness and restrained roastiness. But as one who didn't particularly enjoy what he had from Stone, I was bound to recognize in a blind tasting that their imperial stout is world-class. Delicious and one of the best, as much as I hate to admit it.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,96
147,1160,taez555,4.8,"This beer poured a pitch black, crude oil looking, body with a tiny orange/tan head that died quickly.  The nose to this beer was simply amazing. Rich milk chocolate, fresh malt, alcohol, slight smoke, roasted coffee, a slight licorice or anise touch. In my notes I wrote oh my fucking god!!! I guess I liked it.  The body was very thick and rich yet completely smooth. Chocolate, coffee, black liquorice, a hint of wood, smoke. The bitterness is very mellow coming mostly from the soft roasted barley. Alcohol touches, wood, a slight hop taste. It actually starts simple on the first sip but as it passes across the tongue it ends with a more pronounced malt flavor followed by a soft sour bread sort of ending.  Simply an amazing beer. It actually almost reminds me of a nice german bock beer mixed with stout at times. The fresh malt flavor though reminds me of going on a brewery tour. Its really an amazing beer. A must try. I can still taste it days later.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,96
147,1160,kbub6f,4.9,"2003 edition.  This beer is black. There is not a bit of light coming through. I managed to notice that the head was dark brown in the two seconds before it died to nothing. Aroma is sweet chocolate, with some roastiness. A sweet, tangy, chocolate front. A thick, sweet, dark, chocolate, syrupy, buttery middle. A nicely bitter finish, roasty, nutty, with warming alcohol. This is an excellent imperial stout: jammed with choco-syrup, buttery, roasty intensity.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,96
147,1160,TinusTime,4.41,"Wow this is one black stout.. I think it started sucking the light out of the room as I poured it.. Nice foamy mocha head that lingered and laced well.. The smell is of dark roasted malts and coffee. Maybe a bit of bittersweet chocolate. The taste is of coffee, caramel and a bit of brandied plums. Alcohol is barely noticeable. The Carbonation was beautiful and lended to a splendid mouthfeel. Drinkability is very high for a stout of this power.. Absolutely fantastic",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,96
147,1160,travolta,3.65,"22oz bomber. 9.47 ABV  Apperance: Great rocky bubbly chocolate head. The color is black in the glass, and the same held up to the light. My knees shook when I held it up to the light.  Nose: Spice, mustard, mint, hops, cold dark iced tea, red wine.  Taste: Coffee, toffee, black currants, alcohol at the end. Chemical in the middle. There is a funny pinch towards the end. Very syrupy.  Notes: About the pinch; This brew gave me an ""alcohol, hops, chemical, bitter"" pinch in the middle to back of the tounge. It was an interesting characteristic, however unpleasent.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,96
147,1160,Boto,4.85,"22oz Bomber: The beer has a ""thick"" consistency when it is poured. It is almost a little syrupy. Dark oily brown color. Small cocoa colored head. The aroma is multi-faceted. Molasses, coffee, chocolate, some fruits too? Taste starts out a bit sweet. Malts and chocolate are the first hits. The flavor gives way to some chocolate, coffee and a bit of bitterness. Very rich, full and complex. Wow, this is good!",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,96
147,1160,HardTarget,4.73,"22oz Bomber, Limited late Spring 2003 (tasted March 9, 2004) Aroma: Started cold, which only gave a mild cotton candy scent. Once it warmed, all I could really note was the alcohol, maybe with a hint of rum soaked raisins. Appearance: The beer is ink black, with only the slightest line of deep brown at the edge when seriously backlit. The smallest of heads with a stiff pour quickly formed an odd web-shaped coat in the middle of my Chimay goblet. Carbonation trickles fed a tiny ring at the edge for the first pour, but gone by the second. Flavor: Komplicated is right. Coffee, raisin, cherry, maple syrup, caramel, alcohol, chocolate and toasted malt&#8230; maybe I should start listing things I don&#8217;t taste. Balance is toward the malt, but very evenhanded. Hops didn&#8217;t show up until the beer warmed a bit, and only deep in the aftertaste. This baby aged for a year, which I think explains the mellowed hops, and I&#8217;m happy for the effect. While this is komplicated, it is like pieces of a puzzle that just fit together. The komplete taste is whole, and serene. No harsh bite, no hop slap, no sweet rush, no sour pucker, just a smooth complete taste. Mouthfeel: So smooth&#8230;. Medium body that grew a bit as it warmed. No oils, but a gentle mouth coating quality that let the gentle hops and rich flavors slowly seep into your chops. Overall Impression: I was scared to try this, it being ranked so high (currently ranked #3). My expectations were high. God bless you BA! I don&#8217;t know how Bayesian estimates work, and I don&#8217;t care; this is one of the best beers I have ever tasted. Rich, complex, mellow like a good cigar. The alcohol is felt and tasted, but it fits. I&#8217;m awed by Stone&#8217;s abilities. While this is a massive beer, it&#8217;s easy to drink. If the alcohol content wouldn&#8217;t make me drool, I&#8217;d drink 3 more. Many thanks to weefishheads for the bottle.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,96
147,1160,ManekiNeko,4.97,"22 oz. bomber served at cellar temperature in a Trois Pistoles goblet.  Appearance: Jet black topped by a small dark brown head that evaporates to a ring of foam faster than a businessman with political aspirations in Putin's Russia. Little fingers of lace were left on the glass, which I promptly licked clean so as not to let any of this go to waste.  Smell: Intensely dark aromas of coffee, alcohol, dark chocolate, blackstrap molasses, and burnt roasted malts. Light notes of prune. I want this as a cologne.  Taste: Bliss. Sheer, un-a-friggin-dulterated bliss in a glass. A bittersweet symphony of espresso, dark chocolate, blackened malts, and magic. Yes magic. The alcohol can definitely be tasted, but it joyously melds into the whole gestalt. It just feels right that you can taste it, dig?  Mouthfeel: Thick and viscous with aftertastes longer than Ron Jeremy. I wish they stuck around longer, unlike the person I compared them to. And, oh yes, alcohol burps!!  Drinkability: No other Stone beer has made me wish to buy it by the case. The 2004 release cannot come soon enough. Bring it on, Stone, and screw the credit limit!  Marginalia: I had the good fortune of having the same vintage back in August and it was much more brash with hops and alcohol. Time tames this ferocious beast into a glorious creature of beauty.  I described this to a friend of mine in a state of euphoria. She respond with a message containing three emoticons of smiling hearts, and then proclaimed to all and sundry:  ""All I want is a Stone Imperial Stout and a pet meerkat"" -Xi",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,96
147,1160,lou91,4.28,"Believe the hype. Rich, chocolatety initial flavors - thick with an alcohol punch to remind you who are playing with. The burnt coffee initial taste gives way to a bitter chocolate aftertaste in a way that is predictable but so well done that it doesnt really matter  much like watching the godfather for the 17th time. A world class stout at a reasonable price. Life is good.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,96
147,1160,BeefyMee,3.64,"Appearance: I'd say it's the blackest beer I've ever seen. It has the darkest brown head too. As a genius once said, ""None more black.""  Smell: An interesting chocolate aroma here, as it's not the usual for an imperial stout. It has more of a milk chocolate smell instead of dark chocolate. Alcohol comes through in good portions as well.  Taste: Smooth chocolatey taste accompanied by a healthy dose of alcohol. The chocolate is different from the smell and leans more towards the dark side. Point loss due to the alcohol being overpowering at times.  Mouthfeel: So creamy smooth. Feels like you can almost hold it in your hand. This one is right up there with Rogue Chocolate Stout in terms of superb mouthfeel, although I would have to give the edge to Rogue.  Drinkability: Okay, but I wouldn't go beyond one bomber. The strength of the alcohol hurt the beer in this department. The disagreeable alcoholic quality just started to get on my nerves after a while.  Beef Notes: I can think of at least three imperial stouts I'd rather have, but this is still a good beer. I did expect a little more character from Stone. C'mon guys, you gotta live up to your own hype.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,96
147,1160,BeerResearcher,4.2,"This big brew pours a roofing tar black with a thin, fast-fading tan head and very little lace. I was expecting a big wallop in the aroma department, but was surprised to find the need to search and concentrate for the answers. Sweet bready malt, faint hop and just a hint of the advertised 9.47 % abv are noticed upon close inspection. Sweet, biscuity malt, toffee, sweet creamy coffee and some candy sugars blend well with sharp-edged white grapefruit, lemony sourness, orange zest and vodka-soaked pears. Brown sugar, maple, milk chocolate and rummy flavors rise up. The body becomes overly syrupy, and as far as ""drinkability"" goes, it's a bit thick. While it is quite tasty, this is one-at-a-one-time sort of brew. The advertised abv begins to make advances as it warms.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,96

147,1160,nomad,4.33,"Dark, you expect anything else? Has tiny wispy stain from nice head that fights to stay but, alas, can not.  Smells of chocolate surrounded by slight smoke, molasses, and a fruitiness closest to black currants. Nutty presence through out. Flavored by sweet-ish complex fruit and dark chocolate, melding into an amazing play of black currants and mocha weaving in and out of each other. Also tasted a calmed espresso flavor. A smooth profile, complex but so well blended its tough to pick it apart. Ends on a roasty finish with small cream licks and a tiny spice of alcohol. Extremely drinkable, it went down very easy.  I think I let it sit for too long, as I aged my bomber bottle at about 60F for 6 months; it thereby lost some of its punch, especially around the olfactory. I did like how the hops had calmed down so much, and how complex the taste had become - thus, next time I'll age it for 3 months. In personal taste, I'd take a Dragonslayer or Czar instead.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,96
147,1160,GreenWBush,4.3,"This is another monster-sized stout, but what else could expect from Stone? Anything else would be blasphemy. 22 oz, $4.99.  This mega-stout pours out impenetrably black with a measly dark brown head. On the nose I catch roastiness, then coffee, chocolate, and even fudge. I get some of this crazy-juice on my finger and fear that it is soiled forever.  This stout is so full of ingredients that the alcohol odor is swallowed whole - quite a feat at above 9% ABV. My mouthfeel is chewy and cocoa-rich. You can tell how much power this beer wields when the intricate lacing starts to look like cloud patterns. As you progress down the glass, you will find the hop fangs slowly sinking into you.  This beer avoids being sickly sweet, but is still not hugely drinkable. I would never consider drinking more than one bomber on even a special occasion. Still, I never had any trouble downing it.  Watch your breath after this one, though! People will think you've been lapping up motor oil from the parking lot. God only knows how many calories are in this bomber, but i'd guess enough to feed a small country. All in all a good stout, but not one i'd want as often as say a Shakespeare stout.

Ah, now THIS is what an imperial stout should look like. Dark and slick as used motor oil. Surprisingly small head from fairly aggressive pour, but what's there is creamy.  Whoa, Nelly, I can smell this brew at arm's length. Roasty, toasty and alcohol. Hints of sweetness -- fig or raisin.  Smooth, warm and wonderful on the tounge. You can actually taste the barley, hops and yeast independently. Ok, almost. Alcohol would be overbearing for my tastes, but it melds so well with the roasted malt taste that it's most enjoyable. That taste hangs in there, pitches a tent, sticks around.  Full bodied? Sh-he-heeee, this bubba is sumo-bodied. Slick, smooth and most deffinately heavy. With a half-empty glass, I'm getting full. Wow.  I can't drink more than a two of these a day. I just can't.  Give this to a Ulta-light drinker and they will actually die. This is full flavour.

Aroma is of dark coffee, very sweet malts, brown sugar some dark, ripe fruits. Alcohol. Mouthfeel is extremely heavy (syruppy) and very creamy. Very light crispness at the beginning, but doesn't last long. Very sweet and malty. A very slight amount of hop bitterness, but it's hard to detect. Ends with fairly alcoholic, almost like a cough syrup. This one is almost a little too much. A very well-crafted beer, but needs to be given the proper respect.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,96
147,1160,Gavage,4.33,"This one pours a strong black color with a thin dark brown head. The nose was dominated by alcohol more so than other imperial stouts, but coffee, roasted malt, and licorice were noticeable. The flavor kicks butt. Roasted malt, coffee,chocolate, caramel, licorice, plums, and alcohol were flavors I could pull out during the drink.  Very thick bodied. Smooth on the tongue. I noticed a chocolate and mellow coffee aftertaste. Very creamy finish.  This one turned me off slightly at the start on the aroma due to the very dominant alcohol smell, but the flavor turned the tables. The alcohol level was much more tolerable by the tongue and was balanced in the other flavors.

Pouring it reminded me of changing the oil in my car -- but if my oil tasted like this stuff I'd be a dedicated motorhead. It had a hint of prune that reminded me somewhat of my '94 Sam Adams Triple Bock, but was far more drinkable.

147,1160,OldFrothingSlosh,4.3,"Late Spring 2002 release. ""Komrad: This beer is bottle-kinditioned.""  Presentation: Screened 22oz. bomber with typical very witty Stone description of the beer on the back (""pours like used motor oil and tastes even heavier"").  Appearance: Yup. It's like used motor oil. Pours like an Exxon Valdez accident...thick, black, and devastating. Wispy thin layer of dark brown lace swirls atop this ""crude"" beer.  Smell: Lots of dark fruit running with wild abandon, chased by a chocolate bar holding a steaming cup of coffee. Medicinal alcohol aromas abound. An avalanche of smells ravage the palate. Fantastic.  Taste: Initally, this beer had a bit of an over-ripe fruit flavor to it. However, as it warmed up more, it got *much* better. The dark druit flavors become much more balanced by the cocoa powder/coffee bean flavors. Some smoky flavor also noted near the end. Finishes with a slightly sour aftertaste, mixed in with some bitterness. Not very long-lasting, either. Some tongue-numbing effects from the alcohol as I neared the end of the bottle. Very flavorful, but just a wee bit behind Storm King IMHBAO.  Mouthfeel: Massive mouthfeel. Thick and creamy...where's my knife and fork. Medium-bodied and virtual lack of carbonation make for an almost cotton-like mouthfeel. Sticks to the palate like velcro.  Drinkability: One to sit back and savor. Many flavors come and go as it travels the lengths of the palate. Much better as it warmed to room temperature. More of a one-an-evening beer as this one lasted quite a long time.  Notes: I'm curious as to whether or not this may have been past its best point for consumption. I purchased it very late in 2002 and it has been in my closet since then. The bit of sour flavor was only a tiny cause for concern as the overall experience was excellent. I prefer just a bit more chocolate flavor and that's why it ranks a little behind Storm King for me. I am curious as to how my '03 bottle tastes...",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,96
147,1160,feloniousmonk,4.7,"Color is as black as sin, thoroughly opaque, utterly dark, and well-endowed with a full, thick, lush roasty-toasty tan head.  Aroma: Oh, goodness, gracious, golly! Sweetness, rich, lush, chocolatey, and burgeoning with a myriad of further flavors, dates, raisins, anise, molasses, maple syrup, dark, twisted, delicious...I've compared certain other Imperial Stouts to candy bars (Bell's Expedition, to name one, whose glass I drink this from), and this goes a touch beyond that, without testing the boundaries of sweetness. Magnificent.  Taste: No body could be fuller, no taste could be richer, the malt is thick and juicy, even, and the hops keep the tongue busy and happy. A complex melange, a viscous mouthfeel, constant tussel with the palate, insistent pleasure on the tongue.  Now, the thicker, slicker, motor-oliy feel kicks in, but by now, you love it, or you're out. Strength, too, sets it's feelers out and begins to trickle into the feeling and the brain, as well. Sticky and treacly, though dark, and thoroughly delicious, if your tastes run like mine.  It rolls around and around the mouth, washing all the senses with this rich, dark, utterly decadent flavor.  Oh, what dark malts can do, for this flavor is so rich, so thick, so fully flavorful, this is decadence, indeed. Finish? There ain't none! It just keeps going in the mouth! Mouthfeel? It is utterly dominant, thoroughly covers every inch of the senses...an amazing beer!  I'm going to close on the note that this is my second bottle of this incredible beer, and second review, for when I first cracked the cap on this monster over 15 months ago, I might not have been prepared for the totality of this experience, despite my past love and appreciation of Imperial Stouts. Now, later, I acknowledge what an astounding bad boy this one is, and I LOVE IT!!!",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,96
147,1160,HiroProtagonist,4.67,"Latest Review: 3.5 years aged bottle. 2001 Stone Imperial Russian Stout was served from a 22 oz. bottle, labeled ""Russian"", unlike 2002 and 2003. In a pint glass, the beer was black with ruby edge accents, and was topped by a brown ring form tan head. The nose was loaded with ultra roasty-oaky raw cocoa malt, with accents of dark esters (currant), vinous sharpness,creamy coffee and powdery nutmeg-like spice. On the palate, a roasty super-dark (85% cocoa solids content) malt profile exploded, and was soon joined by a big dark cherry-blackberry component, which formed the transition to the excellent milk chocholaty sharp finish, which left lingering anise and currant notes. No signs of alcohol were detected. This flavor is unequaled in the imperial stout world. The body was rich and thick, feeling just right for the flavors and character of the beer. The carbonation was appropriate. Even though this stout was huge, the generous esters and superb balance made this imperial drink extremely drinkable.  First Review. Bottle reads...""Limited Late Spring release 2003 Release. Bogartski while you can..."" Pours with no head (Duvel Tulip), color is nearly black, with dark cherry color at the edges of the glass. Aromas of chocolate, coffee, caramel, powerful malts. Tastes delicious, smokey malts, warmness, and twinge of dark cherry flavor perhaps. Its hoppiness balances everything perfectly! Mouthfeel is full and enveloping. You are left with a lasting hop/malt essence long after the last sip. This is a mighty pleasurable stout, one of my favorites!",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,96
147,1160,Realale,4.4,"Black, with just a touch of ruby. Fine ring of brown foam.  Simply great nose. Lots of different malt aromas. Chocolate leads, with a touch of good coffee, and just a bit of caramel/toffee.  Very full in the mouth. Plenty of delicious malt flavors that imitate the nose. Great bitterness kicks in on the long finish. Some dried cherry-like fruitiness develops as it warms. Extremely well-balanced.  Excellent mouthfeel for an Imperial - just enough carbonation to keep the flavors moving across the palate, while allowing the richness to linger. A top-notch Imperial. Seamless, and perilously easy to drink.  Tasted blind at the 12/14/03 St. Louis BA tasting. The best beer I've had from Stone. This is the late Spring 2003 release. I still marginially prefer Expedition, but this is a great example of the style too.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,96
147,1160,woemad,4.72,"Bomber purchased at Jim's Homebrew in Spokane for $5.65. Reads the label:""Limited late spring 2003 release. Bogartski while you can..."" I've come to anticipate anything from Stone that I happen across, and this didn't disapoint me. Poured a black that was as dark as Gray Davis's current political prospects. The head was small and brown, and didn't hang around too long. The nose was primarily of premium French roast coffee, sweet dark chocolate, molasses, and a tiny bit of smokiness. The taste begins with coffee and chocolate notes, with a thin cloak of smokiness wrapped around it. Then a sweetness akin to mollases and caramel slips in for a brief appearance, and walks off with a slight hoppy dryness at the end. The high alcohol content creeps in slightly with a warming sensation after the swallow.The mouthfeel of this beer is thick and viscous, which is just fine for an imperial stout. I had to grade down a little for drinkability in the sense that this would NOT make a good session beer. The combination of rich flavors and the 9.47%abv would probably be a bit much for that. However, this would be great to have at the end of a satisfying meal, perhaps with a nice cigar.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,96
147,1160,CharlesRiver,4.2,"Poured dark as night, solid black! Very small white head even with a solid pour. Smell was sweet chocolate and coffee, but on the mild side. Some nice smokey notes were the first taste that hit me. Alcohol was more present in the end as it led to that warming feeling.  This beer has been in my cellar for over eight months and it could stay in there much longer. Smooth overall but could still use more time. I still rate Storm King above this.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,96
147,1160,OatmattStout,4.45,"REAL TIME REVIEW: Pours coal black with a coffe ice cream color fluffy head. The nose has roasted and malted mik balls aromas. Holy cow! The first thing I notice before I even swallow and exhale to taste flavors is the sheer thickness of this brew. Sweet tobacco and chared grain/oat flavors to start and a nice licorice hop juice biterness. It reminded me of some of the flavors from a big dip of sweet leafy chewing tobacco after a big meal, if you chew you will know what I mean. So many flavor so few fluid ounces... flavors of bittersweet chocolate, prunes and malted grains. Probably the biggest Imperial Stout I've ever tasted. So thick, velvety and good.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,96
147,1160,frank4sail,4.2,"Roasty, bitter, coco and coffee smell with sweetness and clean hops. Dark black opeque look with a thick rich sticky tan head. Superior lace on the glass. WOW is there a hell of alot going on on the tongue when you taste. Initial abv presence introduces roasty malt and and expresso.. this then mellows to some dark chocolate, plum, gin, and some bitter hops. The mouth is quite thick and coating. As it warms the flavors smooth and the edgyness gets mellowed. It will however get better with even more time in the bottle as this is a 2003 release. A sit back and relax kind of brew. It's blowing 30-55 mph outside my fence just broke, a boat blew off a trailer in my back yard and I have no worries... beer is the solution..

147,1160,Bighuge,4.34,"ReReview as of 11-11-03:  My first review (below) came at the end of a long review session. Here's a new look at it with a fresh palate:  Beer is pitch fucking black. The color of death. Man I love it. The absence of head is fitting for the style. A slight brown rimming leaves sparse lace. Some charcoal, tobacco, burnt malt and chocolate on the nose. Surprisingly subdued nose for a Stone brew. The taste is chock full of burnt, roasted, bitter goodies. Charred malt. Anise. Dark fruits. Bitter high alph hops. Brown sugar. Molasses. Dark currants. Great flavor combo. Alcohol is hidden nicely. The mouthfeel is like silk. And the body is about medium full. This is a great tasting Imperial Stout.  Gotta shoot out props to LongBeachBum for serviing this one up for me.     First of all, I almost split a gut laughing as I watched my brother ZAP moan and groan in pleasure as he smelled his portion of my 22 oz bottle. It was as if he were experiencing an intimate moment with a beautiful woman rather than a beer.  This beer is black. Just that way I like my Imperials. A very small brown head dissipates into and edging that laces adequately. Exceptional aroma. Honey, dates, molasses, roasted tones and chocolate. The taste of this beer is phenomenal. Burnt malt, dark fruits, anise, licorice, roasted malt and black currants all intermingle nicely. There's a bit of an alcholic warming sensation, but not a ton. And there's some evident bitterness too. The only drawback, and a slight one at that, is the body of this beer. It is not real thick. I'd say it's in the medium to full range. A little light for my liking.  Add another elite Imperial Stout to my list.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,96
147,1160,ngandhi,4.4,"No head. . . . at first. Stone Imperial Stout is so viscous, the bubbles struggle to make it to the top. When they finally do, forming a thin but beautiful pure brown head, you can see them fighting to hang around, but this bastard kicks them out on the street.  At refrigerator temperature, this stout is thicker than any stout I've ever had. At room temperature, I expect it to set. Yet, the liquid flashdances against the stripper's pole of your tongue before prancing away down your throat like a hooker high on ecstacy for the first time.  Sweet and alcoholic on the nose. Fruit, some say currants, maybe cherries, with green hoppiness in the background.  The initial taste enlivens the front and sides of the tongue; floral, very sweet with figs, prune, rum-plumped currants, and some light cherry, yet inordinately balanced with hop bittering. Creamed coffee. This is the archetype for imperial stouts. It manages to achieve the brutal malty viscosity that everyone longs for, while giving the beer a strong hop backbone that has an aftertaste of raw, whole leaf hops. Also some alcohol -- warming, but never intrusive. Sherry. Medicinal fruit finish.  Russian Imperial Stout is perhaps the toughest style to balance because so much goes into it: twice, maybe three times, the base malt to get an acceptable gravity, ridiculous amounts of dark specialty grains, and more hops than the average brewer could probably afford for a batch. And, in the end, it's all a crap shoot; you can't know if your recipe is good and, because it's so heavy and expensive, it's a tough one to experiment with. Stone pulls it off without a hitch. This is well-balanced for an imperial stout and, therefore, for any beer.  They're really pushing it by serving the stout in 22 oz. bottles. At a private tasting, three people (including me) shared a single bottle and that was almost too much. I just finished my bottle -- in half an hour -- and I think I'm in trouble. This is a real ""I love you man . . . No, I really love you, man"" beer. I live in Illinois and was lucky to come across two bottles of this. If I ever find anything from them again, I'll take it. Stone: WE NEED YOU, please distribute here again!  I can't believe how loud the hop flavor is in this beer (yet, not too bitter and, unlike Out of Bounds Stout, not too leafy). How does it get through all that malt?!  Relax, relax. ng",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,96
147,1160,granger10,4.97,"OH MY! This one was amazing! Dark, thick, black, syrupy, explosive with flavor. Lots of roasted malts in this one. Burnt barley seems to come to mind. Chocolaty sweet, like eating a chocolate cake. Alcohol is there but definitely not too strong. I notice a fig flavor as well. Man oh man, I couldn't get sick of drinking this one. As of now it is my all-time favorite. I love the Imperial Stouts and this one doesn't mess around! Slightly weak head and low carbonation are the only setbacks, but I believe Imp. Stouts shouldn't be too carbonated. If I ever see this at a store I'm buying the whole stock the store has to offer!

147,1160,WaltTrombone,4.8,"WOW! This beer is entirely worthy of it's acclaim!  This was a bottle of the Late Spring 2003 release, and if it tastes this good now, I can only imagine how good it'd be after cellaring for a while!  It poured as black as motor oil after 15,000 miles, with a fluffy tan head that had good staying power and left sheets of lace behind. Aromas were of malt, coffee, currants, raisin, prunes, leather. Tastes bombarded my happy tongue, with raisin, prune, espresso, grapefruit. There was some alcohol warming after just a few sips, and followed by flavors of caramel, blackberry, chocolate, and anise.  The mouthfeel was thick, silky and smooth, with a fine carbonation. It finished with espresso, malt, and prune.  Outstanding beer!!! I can see why it's rated so highly. If any other brewery were to put the word ""Imperial"" on it's offerings, I would doubt it, but this beer is truly worthy of the adjective!",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,96
147,1160,rkhaze,4.8,"2003 edition. Drank this a couple nights ago but wanted to review it as my 20th brew, and what a brew it is! Poured an absolute black with a head that said hi and then melted into the body. Didn't leave lace but coated the inside of the glass with a nice version of a beer oil slick! Smoky aroma with some cocoa, coffee, molasses, licorice and brown sugar. There was also an alcohol presence, my mouth watered just smelling this. Sweet roasted grain flavor with cocoa, espresso and licorice really coming through. Noticeable alcohol warmth, but well integrated into the package. Tangy bittersweet, fruity aftertaste with an almost salty characteristic. Reminded me a bit of a toned down Danish licorice. This beer is so rich, complex and tasty it's almost an overload to the palate. Gets tastier and more complex as it warms. The first time I had a 22 oz. of this, it took 1 1/2 hours to finish! Definitly a sipping beer. Thick, full, creamy and viscous mouthfeel. This is what an Imperial should feel like as it rolls across the tongue. A savory, slow drinking beer. Great with a cigar! The best beer I've had in the last five years and one of my top five ever. Only hindered by the drinkability, but still not bad for the style. Very highly recommended and worthy of all the hype.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,96
147,1160,winomark,4.35,"What a choice for my 20th review!  Appearance: Jet black, with no light showing through at all. Nice chocolate head clinging to the edge of the glass. I would mistake this for Jagermeister with carbonation.  Aroma: Smoky malt and chocolate tones. Peaty and coffee as well. A massive nose.  Taste: Sweet alcohol and malt coats the palate. Smoky, peaty flavors present, and hops make themselves known in the finish.  Mouthfeel: Coats the mouth entirely, with a lingering viscosity and smokiness. One of a kind.  Drinkability: My no means an everyday beer, but one aht is good enough to indulge in whenever possible. Another Stone stunner.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,96
147,1160,Nay,4.55,"Fantastic big stout. Not syrupy big, so I had a couple, but a couple is the max for this lightweight.

147,1160,goz,4.45,"Pours an opague jet black, with a small but dense dark brown head that mostly diminishes, leaving chunks of lace.

147,1160,cokes,4.61,"2002 This is basically pitch black...except to a geek like myself who held the glass to the light in every conceivable manner in order to acheive some ruby-orange edges. Brown head makes an appearance, decides it is not needed, and leaves. Beautiful nose full of woody smokiness, charcoal, coffee, chocolate, prunes, figs, and liberal alcohol. One of the most complex brews I have ever had. Starts off with big time expresso notes. Smoke resides here as well. Burning embers of charcoal. Then in rushes some fruity sweetness. More variety of fruit than I expected. Obviously prune/plum but also blackberry, peach and grape. Turns milk-chocolately at this point. Alcohol shows up, but not rudely. Hops are big, but do not quite balance the immense load. This is the only qualm in the taste dept. The cloying residual sweetness rides long into the finish. Think of roasted/carmelized milk-chocolated covered peach. Needs a little more bitterness for stability. But wonderfully tasty overall. A little thin for an Imperial. Definately full bodied, but it doen't coat the mouth as well as some. But it goes down like a dream. This is certainly a top notch imperial. But a slight step down from my elite class. Thanks to Bighuge for securing a bomber of this for me. (rating: 4.55) --- Spring 2003 Release.  Black. Black and deep. Blacker than memory. Black and opague. Ponderously Black. Entrapping Black. Black. Brief visit from its tan head buddy. Nose is a step down from what I recall, but still captivating. Burnt wood, milk chocolate, and wine-ish alcohol. This doesn't quite sodomize the drinker like, say, Expedition or Rogue, but rather unfolds its complexitiies simply and magnificently. Begins with a torched fig sweetness. Cafe Au Lait and chocolate quickly join. Roastiness is substancial, but it doesn't reach the char of some. Flamed vanilla beans, and deep, vicious caramel. Roasted walnuts and delightful woodiness. Oak mostly. Seems aged and refined beyond its 6 month birthdate. Plums and raisins dominate the later half. Loads and loads of blackberries throughout. Chewy. Hairy. Star Wars fans, bellow your ""aaahhllaaargh"" now. Brown sugar is all over. Dark rum alcoholness. Leafy hops add a slight flavor of forest and growth, but otherwise go unnoticed. Almost full bodied. And almost the best Imperial. This is frightfullly gulpable. Equally sippable, which this is better suited for. Really a top notch Imperial. Overall, better than I remember.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,96
147,1160,beerguy101,4.52,"2002 version. Eclipse black color. Head is medium. Aroma is roasted malts, fruit esters and dark chocolate. A big bold full bodied Imperial Stout. Deeply roasted malts, fruity (touches of cherries, plums, apricots and raisins), vanilla, chocolate and coffee. It has a nice hop bite. Its very smooth for all the flavor stuff going on here. Soft and creamy texture. Mild and soft carbonation. Excellent sipping beer. Hides the 9.6% alcohol very well. Mouthfeel is full and round. Finish is smooth. Aftertaste is slightly sweet.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,96
147,1160,AtLagerHeads,4.3,"An awesome brew, this strong stout is near perfection in virtually every category. The incredibly dark look is topped by a small, but impressive dark milk chocolate head that tends to form slowly and leave too quickly. Still, what remains behind is a fairly impressive lace effect from the residual layer of foam.  The smell is roasty and warms the mind just hinting at the great flavors that are going to come from the thickly inky body. And come it does, with volumes of roasted coffee taste and a thick mouthfeel that informs that this is not your average stout. The overall effect is so full of the coffee and bits of caramel as to nearly overwhelm the senses. The only weakness in this lovely presentation is the limiting effect of the alcohol; limiting as to the sense it gives the rich, tasty brew and limiting in terms of being able to drink more than a little of this great beer.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,96
147,1160,scottum,4.2,"Pours out BLACK with a short light head which leaves a nice lace. The darkness is real my friends. Dark in the look, but also dark in the feel. Mouthfeel is big and black. The taste is good. Not the best Imperial in the land, but a good one none the less. I'll let this Imperial review to be the chance to recomend Magic Hat Nailbiter as the best in the land. Storm King is also quite good. But failing those two I would reach for this over an Old Rasputan which is also good stuff. I love the style, what can I say? I'm glad that this beer was finally retailed in Boston the week I left town so I got to try it.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,96
147,1160,Winter,5,"22 oz bottle. ""Late Spring 2003 Limited Release"". Pours black with a thin dark brown head. Thick lacing. The aroma consists of chocolate, coffee, dark fruit and has a pleasant overall sweetness to it. Full-bodied mouthfeel is very thick and syrupy. Almost chewy. Flavors of molasses and honey covered chocolate roll ever-so-sweetly over the tongue. Taste turns a bit vinous at times with flavors of plum and raisin. Finishes up with a mildly balanced hop bitterness that adds another delightful level of complexity. Behind all this goodness, veiled in the shadows of the blackness, lurks an ass-kicking 9.47% alcohol. By the time you notice it, it's too late.  There are very few beers that linger in my mind days after consumption begging to be had again. Stone Imperial is one that's been tough to get out of my head. This could quite possibly be the ultimate Imperial Stout.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,96
147,1160,dmarch,5,"This was a very tough decision to make. Should any beer be worthy of perfect 5's? Finally, I decided that it wasn't fair to Stone to deduct a point somewhere just because there should be no such thing as a perfect beer. After tasting this, I think I may have been wrong. I honestly don't think any imperial stout could top this. Jet black in color with a thin tan head that just seems to hang around for an eternity. Roasted coffee is dominant in both the aroma and the taste. There are also traces of plums and raisins. What more can I say? As far as this particular style goes, I don't think you can top this.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,96
147,1160,Boilermaker88,4.32,"2003 vintage; poured from a 22oz bomber . Pitch black color. No light could penetrate, even when held up to the late afternoon light. A veritable black hole as no light could get through. A rather wispy tan head formed and quickly disappeared. Smell was an assault on the olfactory senses. Aromas of roasted espresso beans, caramel, prunes, dates, figs, and a heady whiff of alcohol to foreshadow what was next. Taste was even more intense. Strong flavors of mocha/espresso, carmelized dark brown sugar, dark dried fruits, and roasted barley combined for a syrupy sweetness tempered by a faint hops taste and an alcohol kick in the finish. Feel was thick, smooth, almost oily. Filled the mouth and was rather cloying. Damn, I'm still full from this beer and it's been 3 hours! A great tasting brew that hides the ABV% well until it gets close to room temp. Then the alcohol really comes out and sucker-punches you. This offering from Stone is what all those fizzy yellow ""dark beers are heavy"" beer drinkers have nightmares about. Tough to work through one of these brutes alone but worth the taste treat.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,96
147,1160,Indybeer,4.7,"22 oz bottle. Poured a pitch black, with a massive head, some good lacing on the glass. Aroma is roasted barley, espresso coffee, chocolate, and even alcohol! Whew!!

This stout poured an opaque, black color with creamy brown foam (with coaxing) that settled but clung to the glass a bit. The smell was a very pleasant sweet roasted barley aroma with grain, malt, and oatmeal? in the mix. The taste was sweet and malty with roasted barley, chicory, fruit (figs, raisins), hints of coffee, and toffee, and a trace of alcohol. The hops were present in the finish. The mouthfeel was smooth, sweet, creamy, and warming, with full body. The aftertaste was nice and lingered. This was a very enjoyable Imperial Stout!

A perfect 2 fingers, with the appearance of rising dough. Various sized bubbles break the surface with the promise of whats to come.  An intense nose with notes of roast espresso, anise, grapefruit, & a hint of solvent.  Complex flavour, featuring notes of cinnamon, espresso, and all of my favorite dark fruit buddies: raisins, plums, & black currant. A bit of warming alcohol, is followed up by a semi dry finish including a bit of grapefruit. The hops are quite punchy, but not overwhelming. They make their presence known without making a bitter stout. As it warms it begins to take on a minor perfume like aftertaste.  Thick, chewy, and syrupy. Viscous, like carbonated 5W-30.  This stuff is liquid desert!",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,96
147,1160,RoyalT,4.92,"Appearance  Black as night with a ruby tinge. The head was kind of weak but lasted the glass really well.  Smell  Super stout flavors. Huge coffee and chocolate mixed with molasses and malt to make this an olfactory orgasm.  Taste  My Lord! The big coffee (Starbucks finest) has a lot of company in here. Raw brown sugar is a big player, along with chocolate syrup, prunes and raisins, kahlua, light toffee, and a complicated flavor that reminds me of tiramisu. This thing is awesome.  Mouthfeel  Low carbonation, typical for the style, and a smoothness that is beyond reproach.  Drinkability  I dont know how Stone gets their brews so smooth, but this went down like silk.  Comments  Im wary of being the newbie that rates beers too high  especially after my Ruination spasm attack (Im still twitching)  but this brew embodies everything I believe a Stout should represent.  Update  The Stone RIP has established a reputation as one of the best beers made in America, and it is very well-deserved. In comparing the 2003 to the 2005, the only dig I can find is that the Appearance isnt perfect. Otherwise, its as close to straight 5s as you can get without gettin there.  The nose is incredible and changes dramatically as the beer warms. The sipping flavors come so fast they really make you slow down when drinking. You almost want to set up a tent out in the street and start telling people about it.  The Mouthfeel is impeccable and just does fall short of some of the best that Ive ever had. Drinkability? You gotta be kidding me! I raise a toast to Greg and the entire Stone staff for putting everything together (once again). Cheers!  Update  I popped one of my cellared summer-released 2005s in June 2006. Its just starting to get into the sweet spot. The alcohol is picking up steam and the sugars are opening up nicely. It still has plenty of body and will be perfect on its second b-day.  Update – Found a six-pack can of this at my local beer store just before Thanksgiving 2022. The aroma of this beer is magical with in my opinion the best roasty/sweet notes on the planet. They somehow got a rich, sugary scent up front but managed to keep the beer from tasting too sweet. Still in my top 5 RIPs of all time.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,96
147,1160,alexgash,4.87,"2003 edition. Awesome. By the way, thanks Chaduvel for this one. Brewed in California, delivered by refrigerated truck to Boston, purchased by Chaduvel at Juliana's, flown in baggage to SLC, driven to Logan, and consumed shortly thereafter. What a life for this magnificent 22 oz. beer. Split this one with Kluk. Poured darker than the 4000+ mile motor oil I just drained out of my subaru. Not as thick though (thank god). Formed a small to medium sized tan head. Smell was dominated, initially, by freshly cut barley and roasted espresso. But I also picked out plenty of alcohol, raisins, and other complex fruity/chocolatey mixtures. Amazing. Taste was much like the smell. Big roasted malt presence but the alcohol and the chocolate and the sweetness of the overripe fruits balance this well. The finish was warming and just bitter enough. The lacings on the glass are great. Very thick, rich, and syrupy; just how I like my imperial stouts. My half of the bomber was gone too soon...need more...hmmm...I can really feel this alcohol. Thanks again Stone. 3 for 3!",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,96
147,1160,cretemixer,4.42,"2003 release  Pours darkest auburn but rests in the glass like a black hole. The creamy head is the color of lightly creamed coffee with a little two tone swirl effect going on. The head settles to a ""cling-ring"" after a few minutes leaving no lace. The aroma is as promised. Rich and thick with notes of toffee, raisins and licorice. The first taste is of mildly bitter coffee, with a shot in it. The alcohol is apparent from the get go and warms all the way down. Becomes dryer by midglass and a hop bitterness comes into play as well. The dark fruits in the aroma are there along with bitter chocolate towards the finish as it sweetens up a bit. I was expecting this beer to be a bit more viscous. Don't get me wrong, it is full bodied and slick in the mouth, but I was expecting a bit more thickness to it. Overall a very drinkable Imperial Stout and one worth seeking out.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,96
147,1160,Rumrunner,3.96,22oz. bottle  A very complex stout but somewhat on the sweet side for me.  It pours a great dark brown with a deep tan head. Very nice lacing. The smell is sweet malts and alcohol. There is also some sweet fruit scents mixing around as well.  The flavors are very sweet creamy mocha. Some light roasted coffee and a heavy taste of molassess. The flavor of alcohol is present but it does not hurt the flavors too much. Some prunes and fruit but not much hops. The flavors are complex but the sweetness is not what I look for in a stout.  A nice syrapy mouthfeel. This is a heavy creamy stout. Excellent body. It drinks impeccably smooth.  Overall I enjoyed this stout. I just did not love it and I can think of others that I would purchase before this one.,Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,96
147,1160,kmcnair,4.9,"Spring 2003 release, 22oz bomber.  Oh where to begin... what an incredible honor it is to drink something so good. This exceptional imperial stout pours a thick opaque black and leaves a thick sexy tan head in my glass. The smell is very rich, sweet and licorice. The taste is thick of roasted coffee, licorice, currant, smokey and is delicious. Leaves a nice lace on my glass. Mouth feel is exceptional, very warm and smooth. My 22oz bomber is more than adequate, but I feel as if I could drink more and more. This is the epitome of an Imperial Stout, do not pass this one up if you have the option.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,96
147,1160,tavernjef,4.33,"Pours out of the bomber a deep dark leathery brown of 5W-30 motor oil vescosity only to settle as if its been through the engine much longer and without a filter. That means black to the unmotorized-friendly. A waffer thin, tightly sponged, light cocoa brown head sits atop which fades to a skim always present, lace sticks in ink blot patches.  Smell is subdued but moderately present of dark roasted malts and black malts, quite lusciously so...a light sense of dark fruits favoring raisin, plum, fig, and alcohol warmth mixing in the nose with some chocolate sweetness and coffee notes in there as well.  Taste is quite creamy rich and moderately hefty, but mellowing of dark roasty malts with a slight coffeeness, hops arrive quickly with favorable rich bitterness that fits in quite nicely helping finishing this out with some chocolate twingy tangyness.  Quite a nice easy heavily creamy full body, rich, lusious, and filling, with an incredible lingering chocolate and mild hop bitter drying finish with a bit of alcoholic warmth showing up late taking effect on your head after half the bottle or so.  One excellently done stout in its drinkability, it goes down so wickedly; nearly dangerously smooth and easy for an Imperial Stout its just a knock-down dazzling splendid yummy packed treat that makes you crave every sip after yummy little sip.  Big Thanks to Gusler for the bottle!",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,96
147,1160,mikeys01,4.62,"I managed t bring a few bottles of this magnificent imperial stout back to CT from a recent trip to California. These are 22 oz bombers, marked spring 2003 release. Intersting aroma of coffee with slight hint of anise just on opening the bottle. Pours out black as night, nice light brown head, and the amazing aroma just builds more in the glass. This smells like an imperial stout, all right. Very full, complex taste, with the coffee flavor most evident and hints of chocolate most prominent. The alcohol warms the throat on the way own, with a nice sweet aftertaste. All I can say is yummy...",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,96
147,1160,zerk,4.37,"Sampled at room temperature.  Pours black and completely opaque, with a tan halo of foam encircling the glass. Aroma is a mixture of coffee, roasted malt, and port wine. Flavor begins somewhat sweet with notes of coffee and chocolate, then becomes somewhat vinous, and tannic. The finish has an ample amout of earthy hops. Mouthfeel is smooth and thick... has the consistency of cough syrup.  This is one very wonderful and very big beer.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,96
147,1160,euskera,4.9,"Big, beautiful 22oz bomber. Late spring 2003 edition. Black as oil, beautiful to behold, with a nice caramel-brown head that dissipates into a head not unlike the ""crema"" on good italian espresso. Smoky, roasty chocolaty aroma that feels excellent on the nose. Taste is robust and warm, unbelievably delicious and complex. Anise, bitter dark chocolate, roasted espresso and even a little port wine on the finish from the alcohol. I can't wait to see how this tastes after laying it down for a while. My what a masterpiece.

147,1160,avylover,4.57,"2003 ""late spring"" bottle. Black. Just black..no light gets through it, like oil with 10000 miles on it. Head is brown and fairly small. Scent is overwelming. Dark chocolate, tons of coffee aroma of the starbucks mocha variety, some slight fruitiness underneath all this and a hint of alcohol. The sum of all this ends up smelling like coffee ice cream...Damn!! This is one incredible tasting beer. Starts off with some sweet chocolate then explodes into a huge sweetened coffee flavor. Don't let your 2 year old get ahold of this stuff...they'll love it!! Finishes with a very slight hop bitterness, and the aftertaste is a welcome lingering sweetness, basically as if i'd just put down some coffee ice cream. Alcohol is only evident in the warmth of my belly. Smooth silky mouthfeel and terribly easy to drink. This is one the best ever of any style. Incerdible. BELIEVE THE HYPE..IT'S THAT GOOD!!  Note:Would be all 5s (I can't imagine a better beer) but no straight black beer should get a 5 in appearance IMO.  Edit: 2004 - I just did not enjoy this beer as much this year...maybe just me, or maybe the beer..but it was less creamy and more fruity..not what I like in a stout",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,96
147,1160,bigbelcher,4.11,"Very strong and young. This is one beer worth setting down for a year or two and then it will be remarkable.

Last year it was impossible to get this beer, this year it is available at a couple of places.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,96
147,1160,Naerhu,5,"This is the most fantastic beer I have ever had. It was like being reborn into a world of velvet smooth, soft as silk, juicey heaven.  This was jet black. Could not see throught it with mag light next to it. The brown head was so intense you could land a harrier jet on it and not disturb it.  The smell was aromatic and intense and came at you like a charging clydsdale. Coffee and dried fruit.  If there was a drinkable version of a feline jaguar, this would be it. Powerful roasted malt, silky slick on the palate. Soft but prominent hop betterness. No harshness at all.  The mouthfeel was smooth almost sexual. The alcohol was like transparent silk wrapping on the blockbuster body.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,96
147,1160,beergeek279,4.72,"Served in a 22 oz. bottle., 2003 edition The color was oil black (pouring the same consistency) and held a great head. The smell was very sweet. The taste was a malty sweetness, with a taste reminding me of licorice/anise. The mouthfeel was somewhat heavy, but the alcohol was barely noticable even at this ABV. For this high an alcohol, this is certainly quite drinkable, and I could enjoy a couple of these.  For my 50th review, I wanted to choose a great beer, and the 2003 Stone Imperial Stout is about as good as they come! I'll be waiting on future releases of this Imperial Stout with enthusiasm!",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,96
147,1160,JohnnyDuvel,4.62,"My favorite Stone thus far. As is the case with Speedway and Expedition, there is a rich body and sweet malt profile to balance the bitterness. I love the motor oil appearance, and the rich coffee-like mouthfeel. Certainly stronger and richer than Samuel Smith, but not as balanced or drinkable, IMO. However, I would rate this as good as any other imperial I've had, and if Stone ever becomes available in my area, this would be a regular purchase.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,96
147,1160,Jon,4.63,"This stout pours midnight black. Opaque. As in absolutely no light gets through. A fizzy brown head sits atop the dark liquid, which is a beautiful sight. As the beer breathes for a bit, copious amounts of roasted malt, along with notes of triple-shot espressos, West Coast hops, and alcohol all seek attention from the nose. Taste is incredibly complex, with black currants, incredibly roasty malt, bittering hops, coffee, and alcohol all present. Mouthfeel is very nice and oily, but not overly so. For such a huge offering, this is the most drinkable imperial stout I've ever had the pleasure of drinking. The alcohol content is certainly there, but it never becomes overly prevalent. Overall, this is one exceptional imperial stout.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,96
147,1160,BierReise,4.42,"This is probably the darkest looking stout I've had. First scent to hit my nose as I uncapped this 22oz bottle was cocoa and espresso. Reminded me of an espresso gelato I once had. Very enticing aromas, from a deep black brew with a thin head resting atop. Chocolate, espresso, intensely roasted malts and hints of alcohol and yeast. Velvety smooth stout, extremely smooth and approachable with a slight dryness at the end. Superbly balanced and pure decadence. This is the best product I've had from Stone brewery. I drank this bottle at approx. 65 degrees.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,96
147,1160,Bierman9,4.67,"15APR09 - Tax day! And what better way to celebrate a whopping refund of $3.00 than with the latest edition of Stone's RIS. Dense,deep black liquid is topped by a thin, fine layer of mocha-hued bubbles. Lace is still good. Aroma is detectable from a distance, with lots of coffeeish roastiness. Love the mouthfeel; LOVE it! Rich, smooth, creamy and chewy. Gets no better. Lots more roastiness hits the palate, with coffee, chocolate and mocha melding together. Black currants and a smidge of anise are here, too, with subtle floral hopping laying down a nice layer of linger. Damn good stuff again this year... Flip-flopped appearance and smell from previous entry... Prosit!  4.65 look: 4.5 | smell: 5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 5 | drink: 4.5  *** ***  24OCT04 - Sampled the '04 version today.... still ebony-like in its darkness, with a tan, fine, creamy head... Super lace. Rich nose replete with roasty, coffeeish notes and dark fruit hints. Creamy smooth and, once again, chewy in its mouthfeel. Lots of roasty flavor; more dark fruit notes...lasting hop bite....super bier!! Very similar to '03, in my opinion.... Kicked up a notch to 10.8% this year.... same rating.... lovely stuff from Stone!

Oh yeah!  Out of the bottle comes the North Sea crude....well, it looked dark and as thick as oil anyhow! Deep, dark brown, bordering on black, with no chance of any light escaping this black-hole whatsoever. A hard-pour created a frothy, dark tan head with tight, compact bubbles. Lacing is a decent covering on the glass sides. Initial whiffs bring out some roasty, chocolate notes. Probing further, dark fruit (black currants, raisins) aromas come forth with malty sweetness. The body is full, and it has a big, chewy feel on the palate. Smooth as silk! Oh yeah!! The flavor is a top-shelf combo of malty, roasty sweetness, black currants, dates, raisins, a pinch of molasses and brown-sugar, and an alcohol-induced warmth. I expected Stone to whip-up a larger hop hit at the finish, but this one is a touch restrained, yet still quite up-front and tasty. Even with 9.47% ABV this bier is eminently drinkable. Yet another supremely quaffable Stone bier! Prosit!!!  (5.0/4.5/4.5/5.0/4.5 = 4.65)  568",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,96
147,1160,Dmann,4.83,"What a beer!! I have never seen a beer so black and so thick in all my life! This baby poured like 10W30 but had such a heavenly smell to it...hints of plums, chocolate and coffee without much carbonation. This sucker was black through and through, no light could get through whatsoever. I let it sit till it was just below room temp, took my first sip and was amazed. It felt like a thick syrup going down, then I tasted the chocolate and coffee flavors followed up by a huge yet incredibly smoothe alchohol flavor. This was a thick ass beer and it took my about 45-50 min to sit and enjoy the whole bomber bottle. This is one to seek out now and try, then geta couple more and cellar them!",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,96
147,1160,WVbeergeek,4.67,"Before I start my usual hyping up of the Stone Brewery, just stop me and leave the house and seek out this beer. This is not just any beer this is a beer to be experienced and relived annually like a tradition, only it saddens me to think about the batches from the last two years that have escaped me. This is the 2003 limited spring release, and I am in heaven simply heaven. Pours like crude oil (according to the bottle, but you must see it for yourself), honestly this beer is viscous and opaque it eats up the light that attempts to shine through it. Dark black body with the pleasant thin moccha toned head floating atop of this dark abyss. The aroma contains layers of light milk chocolate tones, dark roasted barley malt, hints of anise in the background, deep plum or any overly ripened fruit in a light brandy liquer all topped off with a light hopping of signature Stone hops to boast it's west coast roots along with an underlying nose of alcohol gracing my olfactory nerves. As the temperature rises so does the amount of alochol that shines through in the flavor of this classic Imperial Russian Stout. A creamy based chocolate/coffe presence along with sweet buttery notes that elegantly dance on my palate. An overall warming effect creates a sense of ecstasy, with notes of fruit tones and acohol notes that are in one word heavenly. Mouthfeel is full and heavy syrup esque, but goes down suprisingly very smoothly. Low carbonation that complements the overall quality of this beer, and definitely a one bottle at a time experience no session beer found here and none wanted from an Imperial Stout of any kind.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,96
147,1160,Dantes,4.62,"Presentation: ~10oz. from draught in a tulip glass at the Stone 12 event. Served a bit cold. Cost: $5.  Appearance: Intensely black in a way that one can imagine a black hole absorbs light. Probably the darkest stout I&#8217;ve seen with the possible exception of the Expedition. Generated and kept a remarkably resilient, tight-grained head, which was beige in color.  Smell: Combined the phenolic quality of spent hydrocarbons with a determined fruitiness that prevents this from being acrid. The smell of a metric ton of roasted malt compressed into the size of a die. Emits the singular fruity aroma of Kenya AA.  Taste: Smoky, tarry, and strongly bitter in a pleasant way; relieved by a subtle sweetness provided by the taste of long-cooked fruit, steeped in eau-de-vie. Stone&#8217;s classic mentholated-hoppiness lurks in the background. The usual stout descriptors of coffee and chocolate don&#8217;t suffice. It has that extra dimension that separates it from the unremittingly bitter Storm King. It&#8217;s hard to come up with the appropriate description, but the fruit-and-earth undercurrent was somewhat reminiscent of a sauce I once had on truffled foie gras. It was supposedly composed of black currant preserves and Pedro Ximenez sherry, cooked down over a long period of time into a barely liquid sauce. It&#8217;s this fruity depth that calls to mind Kenya AA rather than espresso; Valrohna Grand Cru Manjari rather than just chocolate. A finish as long as John Daly&#8217;s drives.  Mouthfeel: Faint but present carbonation. Body was full, but not as chewy or viscous as Expedition.  Drinkability: Another Stone Beer whose drinkability is best judged by the degree of self-restraint required to stop drinking it. Fortunately I knew I would be spending the night in the city, otherwise I&#8217;d have been in BIG trouble.  Probably my second favorite Imperial Stout after Expedition. A real achievement in balancing the classic, core bitterness of a first rate stout with the added elements of dark berries, wine-like flavors, and a definite tang. Mouthwatering.  Bottom Line: Maybe this is what Ferrari is really using in the Enzo at $60/quart.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,96
147,1160,Ellbert,4.8,"Wow!!! As soon as I opened this bottle the air around me was permiated with the thick and full aroma of this stout.  The apperance was pitch black. A tan head slowly formed and discipated leaving a nice lace.  The smell was overwhelming, mostly coffee with a lot of hop aroma.  The taste was exceptional. First I could taste a nice coffee flavor and the alcohol at the end with hops all over the place. Very robust and different. In a class of its own.  Mouthfeel was excellent, it felt thick and creamy with a moderate ammount of carbonation to spice it up.  Despite the wonderful traits to this brew It was very rich and full and difficult to drink after half of the 22oz bottle.  A hunk of white cheddar cheese complimented this fairly well in my opinion. This beer could be a meal in itself. Everything I would look for in an imperial stout. Go Stone Brewing!!!   ""Mmmm Beer...""

147,1160,PhantomVodoo,4.18,"2003 edition on tap at Brew's. Opaque and black as night. Brown head that laced nicely. Aroma of alcohol, dark ripe fruits, and something I can't really describe.  Taste of sweet, roasted malts. Hops are there to balance. Dark, ripe fruit. The predominant flavor is something I can't really describe. Alcohol is evident, but not overbearing. Pretty smooth for a beer of this magnitude. Good balance, not overly sweet or bitter. Finishes nicely.  Nice, full-bodied mouthfeel. Very drinkable for a beer of 9.5%ABV.

147,1160,SheepNutz,4.78,"I had this awesome beer in a 22oz. bomber poured into a tulip-style glass. It pours a thick black with half a finger of reddish-tan head. The head goes away quick, and there is no lacing. The smell is a sweet malty flavor of coffee and spices. The taste is just fabulous. Hints of chocolate and toffee under roasted coffee and caramel. There is just the right amount of hops to balance it all out. The mouthfeel is just awesome, very heavy. This is still a drinkable beer at 9.47%. A really great example of an imperial stout!",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,96
147,1160,Mess,4.08,"With a beer that swallows all light, Stone has outdone itself with this fine interpretation of the style. I wondered if I should have dared to be selfish enough to take on the entire 22oz rather than share it with a friend; I perservered through the guilt. Black as the ace of spades, the beer pours thickly and smoothly with a consistency reminiscent of the bottom of a coffee pot lined with spent grounds. Atop sits a fluffy, dark brown head. A whiff of chocolate-coffee sweetness and alcohol are apparent throughout the beer's pint-plus lifespan. A soft-silky mouthfeel encompasses the tongue while yeasty flavors with roast coffee and dark chocolate nourish the senses before the smooth liquid drapes down the back of the throat. This is a delicious treat on its own or for dessert. It kept me warm and filled my belly - enough to where I wished I didn't eat the meal I did before hand! - and would pair perfectly with chunky chocolate chip cookies (which would probably stand straight up in the tasty stuff). Stone's Imperial Stout is an excellent flavorful beer that was easy to put to my lips and yet one that's best to take time with. Can't wait to taste this vintage once it's been cellared for a year.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,96
147,1160,TXHops,4.35,"Mmmmillicit Stone Imperial Stout 2003 vintage... It looks pretty much like Id have expectedjet black (though a little brown can be teased out around the very top of the pour line) with a VERY brown head of bubbles that lasts about as long as Id have expected on a beer of this strength and viscosity. Aint no Dry Irish Stout The smell was not quite as expected., though A huge bouquet of dried, roasted coffee beans mixed with powdered cocoa and smoked, salted jerky to create some very unusual aromatics, even for a beer as necessarily complex as a big Imperial Stout. The murky, viscous body contained the whole range of expected flavorscoffee, charred beef, licorice, port and evil black fruits that have no name. Still, the interesting aspect of this beer to me was the slightly salty, slightly menthol-like aftertasteis that the roasted barley mingling with the high alpha hops and 9.47% ABV? My chest actually feels hot and cold at the same timelike Ive drunk Vics soothing chest rub diluted with soy sauce. Luckily the taste isnt quite so foul ;) Complex doesnt do this one justice any more than viscous does. Next to an un-aged Lees Harvest Ale (of which I took a hydrometer reading at over 1.040 once) this is the thickest beer Ive ever consumed. Certainly theres enough unfermented blackness in my glass to brew a Guinness.  The whole time I drank this beer, I kept having intermittent, incomplete flashbacks to my mothers kitchen. I dont know exactly which flavor was taking me back on that Freudian journey, but I have a guess. My mom used to bake a lot pies. The signature of my mothers handiwork was the little stream of fruit and dough that stuck to the outside pie plate and burned there. I think this beer tastes like chasing that little hunk of carbonized starch with 80 proof port (if there is such a drink).  A monster, indeed. Im really curious to see how this beer tastes in a year. The flavors are not at all rough or segregated, even at this VERY young age. The beer flows seamlessly from the glass into the mouth, creating a uniform, though thoroughly complex flavor profile. Kudos again to the boys at Stone for not only brewing massive beers, but brewing beers with flavorsome substance too.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,96
147,1160,irishmoss,4.9,"""Limited Late Spring 2003 Release"" - I've been anticipating this one for a very, very long time. Pours darker than black with a brown head that goes away farely quickly. I found myself swirling this viscous liquid around the glass and watching it cling to the sides of glass like Jager. Flavors of roasted malt, coffee, chocolate, and a hint of spice. This was nice and fresh and should age very well. I tried like hell to sip this one, but it knocked me on my ass anyway. But it was in a good way.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,96

147,1160,NeroFiddled,4.77,"""Limited Late Spring 2002 Release"" - roughly one year old right now. There's been enough said about the specifics of this beer that I'm sure I don't have to start with ""Pours as black as night..."". I'm not a huge fan of Imperial Stouts, but this one just became one of my all time favorites!  I was quite impressed with the level of maltiness present in the aroma, and the complexity that goes along with it. It's quite cocoa-ish, but also fruity. It has a touch of the ""burnt currant"" that's so common to the style, but this is more ripe and juicy - and it's the fruitiness that I recognize in the other Stone beers (particularily the pale ale). But it's even more complex than that with some very light citrusy hops and an oak character that really makes it interesting. But surprisingly, it's not that roasty. In fact, overall, it's more of a Baltic Porter. There's a touch of alcohol in the nose as well, but it seems to enhance rather than hinder.  The flavor follows the same routine. It's quite impressive with a rich-but-not-cloying maltiness that delivers buttered brown sugar, cocoa, fresh wort, creamy coffee, ripe raspberry, nuts, dried fruits, sweet bread crust, red wine, and caramel. It's well-balanced by a bitterness that supports, but also hangs in the wings.  Highly recommended!!! Although the alcohol will stop you.... you'll want to drink a few of these!",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,96
147,1160,beerluvr,3.43,"2002 version. Pours out with a light tan head that collapses upon black as night opaque liquid. The nose is very plummy/dark fruit-like. Taste is very malty, deep dark and rich, with prune and and malt sweetness dominating. Alcohol soon follows with warming and soothing sensations. The hops are there...just not enough for my taste, I was expecting to taste a bit more with this being a West coast brew. Finishes tangy, more sweet than bitter. Nice, but there's more exciting examples availiable out there.  Thanks to ""Gloworm"" Gusler for the bottle.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,96

147,1160,Darkale,4.73,"Arrogant Bastard proved that Stone owns the right to call itself a premier brewer; I thought I would check on their Imperial Stout to see if AB was a fluke.  It's not a fluke.  It truly pours like some kind of lubricant; the reviewers are not kidding. The head is heavy and tasty but not particularly deep nor resilient. Aroma and taste are a strange mix of malty, raisiny, fruity and mildly spicy flavors. Wonderfully chewy, and the sweet fruitiness almost makes it sparkle (as if something that pours like motor oil in Siberia could be said to sparkle!).  Like Arrogant Bastard, Stone's Imperial Stout makes me smile from cap-off until the last line of foam is in my mouth.  I used to think Guiness was a stout.  Ha!  It's like swallowing Christmas lights during Midnight mass. Wow. What a stout.  For the record, it's March of 2003 as I write this, and the stout was the spring of 2002 version, and apparently has been patiently waiting for me in one of my local beer stores (with no ill effects) for the last several months.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,96

As I pour it in my Stone pint cup (hehe), I can see nothing, what i mean is the shadow it places as I set it next to me on my desktop proves a real deep dark caramel coffee color that gives reason to what is packed in this stout. The smell is rich raisin, deep malt and hints of coffee, Ahhh. The taste is a major kick in the a$$ with full flavor you would want to keep in touch and never let go. Some hints of black cherry and dates are also present. I would slowly savor the combination blast of this wholesome treat that i can see it to be addictive to my stout loving ways. Chances are I would even pour this on my ice cream for that fruitful candy taste. In all this is what I call delicious, maybe this is not the way to describe such a brew, but I can assure this to myself, this is clearly hands down one great Imperial Stout.

Malt, bread, chocolate, currant, plus an untold number of other characteristics. Wow, this is a thick, heavy brew! It is malty, bready, lightly sweet in taste. There are also hints of coffee and chocolate. The alcohol is evident and provides a good balance with the sweetness. Too complex in taste to comment on everything.  Just an absolutely incredible ale. I must have more, and soon. Could very well be #1 on my personal list.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,96
147,1160,JISurfer,3.81,"This is one helluva brew! It is my first experience with an Imperial Stout. Richer than Ted Turner. The color is a super black color, like old motor oil. Had a real thick head on it at first, but then quickley subsided. The head was a real reddish brown color, and started out like an inch thick. The taste is that of dark coffee, some fruits(grapes), and chocolate. Kinda taste like a fruity chocolate espresso, which is kinda wierd to me, but I like it. It starts out smooth and finishes smooth. The only reason I gave it a 3.5 on drinkability, was due to the fact that it was so rich. Give it a shot, you might like it.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,96
147,1160,aaronh,5,"This beer totally blew my mind! Ok, now that that's out of the way:  This beer is black, and pours with a minimal, but dense brown head. No color can be seen through this beer, it is so ominously dark. This may be to foreshadow the evil effects it will have upon your opinions of other beers. The aroma smacks you hard with chocolate, malt, hops, and some plum fruit. All distinct, but yet one aroma. It's as if this beer transforms it's smell continously to mesmerize it's victims. Upon sipping this silky smooth liquid satin (or is it Satan), intense plum, chocolate, coffee, and roasted malt flavors bind your tastebuds. Assertive but well balanced hops secure the knots as this deliciously evil brew takes you hostage. You are assaulted by such intense flavors that it is impossible to distinguish the beginning of one from the end of another. Now completely given in to the power of this beer, you have no choice but to drink every drop of it, and immediately search out some more. Beer may never be the same. I'm not even sure this was beer. It has a power over me now. I must find more. I must find more. I must find more.......",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,96
147,1160,johnrobe,4.45,To me this beer is cast and mold for the style. The color is so dark no light can escape it and it sports a deep tan head. Chocolate malt dominates the aroma with a bit of coffee in the background. Chocolate and black malts are front-n-center in the taste with citrusy hops providing balance but utimately being overshadowed by all the malt. This brew exhibits more fruitiness than other imperial stouts I've tried. Roasted barley comes on late but takes a backseat to other flavors. Mouthfeel is thick but not syrupy. Outstanding!,Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,96
147,1160,aracauna,4.28,"Absolutely black opaque with a dark tan head that is about what you expect from the style. Alcohol is stronger on the nose than some of the other imperial stouts. Nice malty aroma with good cherry fruitiness under the alcohol bite. Taste is smooth, creamy. Milk chocolate, slight coffeeish hint with creaminess hints at Kahlua. Anise. Great beer.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,96
147,1160,maxpower,4.5,"Wow I don't know what to say, I feel blessed to have a taste of this brew..........Nice burnt chocolate malt,perfect amount of hops. Black Licorice and coffee flavor.Sweet with a great malt balance, One of the best Imperial Stouts I have had I hope I can get some more.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,96
147,1160,Dogbrick,4.75,"This is the first (but certainly will not be the last) high-ABV beer I tried since the limit was raised here in Ohio. Quite possibly the prettiest beer I have ever poured. 2/3 oily black evilness under 1/3 beautiful dark brown head. Aroma of dark chocolate and anise. Amazingly rich and complex flavor consisting of coffee, cloves, chocolate, and lots of other stuff I couldn't wrap my brain around. This is not a beer, this is an experience. It is completely engrossing from beginning to end, and left me with a nice buzz to boot.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,96
147,1160,Jarod,4.5,"When poured into the glass it flowed into a nice creamy head, not as high as I thought it might but still impressive. The color was a light light brown and it left a lace to match. The color of the brew was a deep dark brown/mocha color. The flavor of this beer had hints of malt, coffee, chocolate, molassas and some light fruit. The aroma matched the flavor with some smells overtaking the others, depending on temperature, and if it is shaken slightly. A very good stout. I loved it, and wish I had more.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,96
147,1160,jreitman,4.88,"Pours an opaque black with an absolutely wonderful light brown head. Roasted mocha aromas rise from the glass and are unmissable. Chocolate and molasses are dominant in the mouth with some coffee and other sweet flavors showing themselves at times. Mouthfeel is absolutely wonderful as it slides down your throat with ease, yet a fair bit of substance. Bitterness is well balanced with the malts, but still gives a good bite. Another amazing beer from Stone.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,96
147,1160,Murph,4.8,"Pours a super black color with a nice creamy brown head that lasts nicely. Big roasty chocolate is huge in the nose, almost a chocolate cake like smell, very nice. Big chocolatey malts jump right out with some more subtle roasted coffee type flavors in the background. The great warming finish has nice dark fruit tones to it that leaves a great amount of flavor lingering on the tongue for a bit. Silky smooth and fairly heavy, this is one great brew. I am going to have to grab a few bottles to cellar as this is one great brew.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,96
147,1160,Wildman,4.95,"2002 Ltd. May Edition: This beer poured as black as the night. It formed a lovely dark tan, foamy head that left some nice circular lace. An aroma of malt, coffee and cherries. A flavor of malt, coffee, chocolate and dark fruit that gave it a slight winey feel to it. A medium body and a slightly bitter/astrigent finish. A great imperial stout.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,96
147,1160,Brent,4.78,"Holy cow! All other stouts, imperial or otherwise, shall henceforth pale in comparison. This is one over the top, take-no-prisoners monster stout. Pushes the envelope on how much flavor can be crammed into a liquid - my tastebuds were overwhelmed and threw in the towel after about four sips. Coffee, molasses, dark chewy malt, you name it, its in there. And did I mention thick? You could just about spread this on toast with a knife. A little sour and astringent at the end, so that it finishes clean enough to invite another quaff. Well done, Stone.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,96
147,1160,hyuga,5,"2003 vintage:  All I have to say is that collectively, Stone's imperial stout is my favorite of all imperial stouts.  2002 vintage:  Much more hoppy than the 2001, the roasted and caramel malts are both more up-front. Less complexity in the fruitiness. This one definitely benefits from more aging, but this vintage is still absolutely wonderful!  2001 vintage:  This one has been waiting for me since last year. This is the Spring 2001 release, which is labeled as ""Stone Imperial Russian Stout"". Pours almost like the bottle jokingly suggests, like used motor oil! This is the darkest black I've ever seen in a beer (if varying degrees of darkness in black are even possible. They seem to be, when used in describing beer, so I'll go with that). It just refuses to let light through. Creamy dark brown head, but not much of one. Still leaves some lace. What a delicious aroma! I am thoroughly impressed. Very sweet chocolate, vanilla, coffee cream, even a bit of cherry, along with underlying roasted coffee character. In one word, the aroma says ""cream"". Makes you want to jump right into tasting this, however, you still can't help but savor the aroma between each sip. On to the palate, very sweet malt with spicy alcohol accompaniment appears first, coating your mouth with a caramel sweetness. Roasted grain and chocolate with some hints of coffee come next. Some of what I'll call ""dark fruit"" flavor as well, including more cherry character. Hops don't come around much, which surprises me, this having come from Stone. This could be due to the aging. Of course, that's not at all a bad thing! As I expected, a very creamy mouthfeel. What an experience this beer is! Definitely a must-try for anyone who can get it! Great one to cellar, too.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,96
147,1160,marc77,4.57,"The virtually jet black hued and opaque brew is topped by a dense, thick, rocky, light brown head that quickly recedes into a thin layer. Sparse lace is left. The highly appetizing aroma is comprised of oaky woodiness, carob, dark chocolate, deeply caramelized dark fruit... roasted grains coupled w/ esters and subtle citrusy hops have had a synergistic effect on the aroma... the whole is greater than the sum of the parts. The rich malt profile is dominated by buttery dark chocolate and sugar coated nuttiness, with roasted barley bitterness lending a bittersweet undertone. Hop bitterness, although secondary, sufficiently balances the residual sweetness, leaving the deeply chocolately malt character intact. Full bodied w/ a highly dextrinous and viscous mouthfeel. Finishes w/ a hint of spicy alcohol and with more mellow dark chocolate lingering. Soothing alcohol warmth emerges after a seemingly long deliberation. Stone Imperial Stout is a tremendously flavorful and rich brew. I only wish I had waited until a cold winter night before drinking this fine beer.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,96
147,1160,ZAP,4.65,"These F'ers have the best smelling beers around...INCREDIBLE aroma...more of sweetness than dryness...Jet black...very small lace....some cocoa and coffee emerging on nose...""Sweet"" is the first impression on the buds...not much in the way of bittering..very nice sweet flavor...easy drinking for an imperial...a bit more hopping would be nice but a very enjoyable imperial...I have several other reviews of Stone Beer on paper that I will be entering tonight, and this could very well be the best brewery in the USA.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,96
147,1160,Jason,4.17,"Presentation: 22 oz brown bomber, Limited Spring 2002 Release on the label gives you an idea of freshness  not that it matters being that this brew is a towering 9.47% abv.  Appearance: Big pillowing foamy tan head is slow to form as the bubbles of carbonation struggle to the top of this thick crude oil black brew. The head does dissipate but the there is a lace that sticks around for the show.  Smell: The aroma is full of highly roasted coffee (French Roast), fruity esters (dried black currants), slight molasses, mild char, and vague solvent alcohol and lost of roasted grain.  Taste: Nearly syrupy from a huge malty body, carbonation is at a medium crispness with an extremely viscous mouth feel. First the flavours go sweet with maltiness are fruity flavours of black currant and prune. Malt sweetness upfront is more of a mild molasses with a deep following of roasted grain and a chocolaty backing that sticks around until the finish. Hop are thrown in for good measure but dont seem to get in the way too much. Alcohol flexes quick with a faint solvent flavour as well as the fruitiness providing some esters for more complexity. A smoothness creeps in out of nowhere and pulls the flavours in further which saturates the taste buds. Deep within, after the brew warms up a bit there is a dark caramel flavour that sits next to beer heaven. After the initial wave of flavour there seems to be a Zen of balance as all of the flavours meld together in perfect formation. The roasted grain lingers with an endless trail cleaning up all other flavours in its wake.  Notes: Devastatingly flavourful, highly drinkable and very deceiving for a brew at 9.47% abv. This beer shows-off Stone Brewings prowess to take a style a bring it to a greater level than others.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,96
147,1160,mickeymac,4.78,"Spring 2002 release. Mine had little head, which faded quickly, leaving only a glass full of beautiful, magical blackness. It has a terrific fruity sweetness without the pronounced roasty flavors of some other imperials. Chocolate flavor becomes more noticeable as it warms. The hops are just enough to balance the sweetness and keep it from overwhelming this beer. This one's got me thinking about moving south to San Marcos to be closer to the brewery.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,96
147,1160,Andy,4.48,"Thick, quickly dissipating tan head. Glassy black color, the darkest I think I have ever seen. Aroma is sadly nothing special compared to the hype. Strong chocolate malt aroma mixed with alcohol, figgish sweet fruit and alcohol. Toasted wafer flavor, well-balanced between malt, alcohol and hops. It took me several hours to drink it, which is impressive. The flavor changed but sustained throughout. A very tasty imperial but I still prefer Brooklyns.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,96
147,1160,mattmaples,4.94,"Mine didn't have as big of a head as I thought it should. The big dark raostyness was very enjoyable, it had an appropriate dryness (some imperials end to be too sweet for the style) and a nice alcohol presence. Excelent Imperial,side by side with North Coast and only to be out done by Havey and Son",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,96
