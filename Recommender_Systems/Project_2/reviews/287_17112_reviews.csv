287,17112,PsDavito,4.2,"Was expecting a little better with such a high rating. Overall it is definitely better than most, would probably buy again.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",Imperial IPA,98
287,17112,HowfarisZanzibar,3.48,"Here's a hot take: I don't think this is a good beer. Perhaps I got a bad batch last time, but it just didn't have the flavor profile I'd expect from a beer that almost cracks the top 250. The honey seemed to reduce the supposed ""Hopslam"" down to more of a ""hop nudge"". This meant any flavor complexity seemed to disappear as well. In this case, I think the high ABV is also detrimental as it tastes very alcoholic, and therefore heavy. Too bad, 'cause it's a heck of a value at Costco.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",Imperial IPA,98
287,17112,jeffdr123,4.28,"In a flight at British Open Pub. Oh my goodness. Complex and over the top in all the tight ways. A strong hops palate but also a strong malt backbone. Kinda boozy, but it's New Year's Eve.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",Imperial IPA,98
287,17112,Wattie83,4.55,"Poured from 12oz can to a tulip glass. Look is fairly clear burnt orange/amber color with a foamy ivory head that takes a while to fall to a nice cap. Sits pretty still in the glass. Smell is pine, melon, caramel apple. Aroma is present but not powerful. Taste is pretty sweet up front with a hit of cantaloupe and citrus. Middle gets a shot of bitterness, but nothing too bracing. Middle sees more fruit flavor like apple and citrus. A bit of pine hits in the finish but it's balanced by a floral, honey sweetness. Balance is a key characteristic here. Aftertaste is apples, caramel and honey. Feel is medium bodied and smooth, smooth, smooth. A low carbonation pops up, but boy this is easy to drink. Overall, I should have tried this years ago, but balked at the price. This is tasty, balanced pretty well between hop bitterness and malt sweetness. Way too easy to drink given the 10% abv. I am a fan of this one though.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",Imperial IPA,98
287,17112,hmf05,4.66,"Still one of the best DIPAs on the planet even in 2022 with all the ""competition."" What makes this beer for me is the mouthfeel. It's thick and chewy without being syrupy. Wish this was around all year.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",Imperial IPA,98
287,17112,dano213,4.25,"12oz can purchased from the fridge as a single for $3.49. Canned on 10/1/2022, so this is a bit over 5 1/2 weeks old.  Look: This is a very pretty beer. It has an almost clear copper color with an amber tinge to it. There is a fluffy, frothy off-white head and lots of tiny bubbles rising up the sides of the glass.  Smell: Tons of piney, fruity (melon, pear, apple skins, golden raisins) hop aroma along with floral aromas and a caramel/honey sweetness. Boozy. This smells almost like a barleywine and it kind of reminds me a bit of a combination of the aromas of Brooklyn Monster Ale, Thomas Hardy's Ale, and North Coast Old Stock Ale. Lots of green bell pepper on the finish after swirling the glass. Has an intense, complex nose.  Taste: This is a sipping beer. It's very interesting and probably not like any other Imperial IPA that I have had before. To me, this really comes off more like an English Barleywine or Old Ale than an IPA. There's just so much caramel malt sweetness in here. It would actually be very interesting to age one of these for a long time and see how it would taste after the hops fade. Up front, it's sweet and malty with caramel and honey notes. The mouthfeel has a lot of weight to it so those notes stick around on the palate for a while even though the hoppy notes steal the show. The finish is definitely bitter, with lots of piney hop resins and grapefruit peel and pith. The lingering flavor after some time is kind of like an undersweetened honey grapefruit marmalade on toast. It's intense and interesting and keeps you coming back for more.  Feel: It has a very slick and oily mouthfeel with a lot of chew to it. Medium plus body. The level of carbonation is right and it provides a relatively soft, almost creamy mouthfeel.  Overall: I'm pretty sure that this is the first time that I am having Bell's Hopslam Ale. It's nice to be reminded what Simcoe hops smell like and their use of honey is pretty tasty and interesting here. It's kind of crazy how popular Simcoe used to be and how much of a throwback it is considered nowadays. This is a pretty tasty beer, and as I mentioned above it really blurs the distinction between Imperial IPA and Barleywine.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",Imperial IPA,98

287,17112,RonaldTheriot,4.85,"Hopslam (2022) has a very thick, off-white head and a translucent, orange appearance, with bubble streams and heavy lacing. The aroma is of white bread crust. The flavor is of strong, but not harsh, hop bitterness, white bread crust, and possible honey. Hopslam (2022) has a high-medium body and a dry finish.

287,17112,LifesAnesthesia,4.6,"L - golden with a large off-white head that sticks around leaving behind a ton of lacing. Good looking IPA S - Tons of juicy, piney, bitter hops, tropical and citrus notes, as well as honey. Some caramel and malts as well. Floral notes as well T - follows the nose with juicy, piney, resinous, bitter hops, tropical and citrus fruits, and honey all intermixed incredibly well. The honey really smooths out bitterness from the hops. Malt ties everything together nicely F - medium bodied with moderate carbonation. Refreshing O - an incredibly well balanced DIPA",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",Imperial IPA,98
287,17112,Shiredave,4.47,"Canned 1-20-22 Perfect, beauteous pour. Deep amber color, transparent with reasonable chill haze and a firm, persistent 1/2 inch head of creamy tan foam that left full curtains of lace. Aroma is a mix of rich malt and hints of woodsy hops. Sweet, caramel and honey nose with subtle pine and citrus hop notes are a welcoming indicator of the flavors to follow. Rich and yummy malt flavors wrap around the conifer and leathery hop resins in terrific balance. Honey character comes through and the body leans towards a honey like texture and mouth feel. Okay, Not honey thick but your do feel the beer hug your tongue, leaving a slick, sweet coating allowing that depth of flavor to linger.... honey-like. Hop bitterness comes in at the finish with a long and smoldering hop/pepper burn as the honey-malt dance twirls off stage. Alcohol is always perceptible but never gets in the way or in any way harsh. Expertly crafted, no un-needed wheat or oat starch, no unseemly and superfluous floculants, just a straight up damn good BIG beer. Outstanding.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",Imperial IPA,98
287,17112,blazerkor,4.75,"It smells really floral, citrussy and sweet. There's a subtly about the scents. Definitely the sweetness is from both the malts and honey. The citrussy floral notes are obviously from the slamming hops.  Sweetness is the first taste that occurs as it hits the palet but then really nice hoppy bitterness.  It's thin and has medium foamy carbonation. The finish is bitter, floral and sweet initially incredibly balanced but everything else fades and the bitterness remains drawing out for some time.  Overall it's such an extremely good DIPA. The hops are very strong but the sweetness of the malts and honey balance it out so instead of being extreme it's incredibly refreshing. One of my favorite DIPAs, it has an originality to it. I give it a 5.7 out of 6.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",Imperial IPA,98

Less hop bitterness than I expected/more malty than I expected. .Medium to heavy body mouthfeel; very smooth, merest hint of the honey. Overall, not a lick of indication that it is 10% ABV.

287,17112,RacerX5k,4.53,"Decided to delete my old review so that this one shows as new ... copied the original text below for reference. Best beer I've had this year, don't know what's changed but been thru an entire case now ... amazing. Not Heady Topper, but I recommend drink from the can, or pour into a big glass and enjoy the ride. Looks good, smells fresh but the taste is the wow factor, Extremely hopped, with a great bitterness, drinkable, and 2 16's is completely satisfying, overall world class.  Edit 1/31/2021 This year's release back in bottles is very good, almost great, and I actually bought a sixer after my one single for the first time in many years. For me to spend $20 on a sixer, it has to be outstanding. Real bitterness. 4.25  Original 1/31/2020 Easily the most overrated beer on earth. And, yes, I still get one (some years even 2, a long time ago an actual sixer) every year thinking I will change my opinion. That's stupid, because I never do. Very mediocre and actually boring, even smelled a little bit like poop poured into my mason jar. Thank goodness, the aroma quickly cleared. Pretty golden color I guess. Smells decently of malt and hops, I don't detect the honey at all. Taste follows, fresh but way too mild. Overall boring as hell.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",Imperial IPA,98

287,17112,jadpsu,4.63,"2/11/22 On draft at the Lincoln Fill Station. LOOK: Very clear amber with an off white head, with good retention and better side glass lace. SMELL: As advertised, floral and pine hops, honey, also some dark fruit. TASTE: Citrus, not sharply bitter, smooth, malts are heavy and there is a combination of early malt and honey sweetness in addition to the resinous hops. Chewy, hides the 10% ABV well mildly sour in the aftertaste. EDIT: 4/29/22 Had a can of Hopslam while in Laurel. Delicious! Excellent, Seemed to be even better than the draft.

Sweet, like honey.  T---Grapefruit, as advertised. Finishes with the honey. Hoppy & a bit bitter. Alcohol is well hidden. On a warm day, that could be a problem.  F---Medium/full body with more carbonation than expected for the high ABV.  O---I was excited to get one of these and I was not disappointed.

S: Definitely full of hops. Mostly floral but a little piney too, if you wait for it. T: For me the honey hits first, but then there's really good balance between all the different hop varieties, with a really nice bitterness to finish things out. F: Soft and pillowy but also full-bodied and well-rounded. My favorite part about this beer. O: An all-timer.

287,17112,Coronaeus,4.43,"Pours a bright copper with a full head that slowly dissipates.  A broad array of floral and pine hop notes on the nose. The honey, had I not known was there would have been too negligible to notice, but, knowing it is there, my nose picks up a smidgen.  Classically piney/grassy IPA on the tongue with a solid bitterness to finish the sip. The honey shines without adding any unwanted sweetness. Quite good.  Lightly effervescent with a full body.  This is excellent stuff. I’m thrilled to have finally tried a can and would definitely buy it in large numbers were I afforded the opportunity.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",Imperial IPA,98
287,17112,mvogt,3.86,"Not as intense as I expected. Smell is kind of muffled. The thing I like eat about it is the feel: smooth and a little syrupy going down, with some alcohol warmth after.

287,17112,DrBeergood,3.67,"L: Amber. Fizzy carbonation. Only slightly hazy, glossy  S: Not very intense on the nose. I was expecting more.  T: Moderate on the flavor. One of the sweeter doubles I've had.  F: Resiny. Perhaps the honey has something to do with that. The dry hop is pleasant on the pallet but the chew is filmy and oily. Worse, the flavor is actually intensifying rather than mellowing out.  O: High ABV.

287,17112,TedHead,4.03,"Pours a standard caramel copper color with a fluffy white head. The nose is sweet with notes of pine and grapefruit/orange dominated citrus up front. The taste has that same grapefruit taste up front that fades into a nice and caramelly malt with a satisfying just barely bitter finish. This one is sweeter than expected, but the honey really does compliment the malt flavor. It's slightly more carbonated than expected, so it's almost refreshing, and goes down very easily.

287,17112,JohnniEMc,4.35,"Although previously consumed a review hasn't yet been posted. So, this time, a twelve ounce brown bottle has been emptied into a clear pint glass. It looks good, but not inspiring. The color is a bright and light copper-amber, on the translucent side. There's only a slight head and no glass lacing. The aroma begins to improve expectations, as there's malt, hops and even honey to detect. The taste starts with a good full on earthy malt character. This never gets bitter, but it never gets too sweet. The body is near perfect and the balance of malt to hop is unassailable. That must be quite the accomplishment, since honey is in the mix. A wonderful exchange of sweeter malt and mild hops that 0deliveres a tasteful brew that may disguise its high ABV better than any other. Outstanding.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",Imperial IPA,98

287,17112,Rug,4.21,"Bottled 1/6/21  This is a legendary beer that I honestly haven't paid much attention too. Pretty widely available too, so it's a shame that it's taken me this long to get around to it, but at least I'm having it now! Let's jump into this beast  Pours a lightly cloudy golden amber with 3 fingers of soapy white head that slowly fades to a cap and leaves patchy lacing, carbonation bubbles streaming from the bottom of the glass  There's a definite balance in the nose between fresh, vibrant hops, and sweet chewy malt. I'm picking up on aromas of oily pine, pithy grapefruit, crackery malt, some earthy spice, sweet honey, and grassy hops  The balance continues into the taste, but leans more into the bitter side of things. On the front end of the sip I'm tasting fresh cut pine, tangerine, pale malt, and lemon rind. The swallow brings notes of pale malt, light toast, orange zest, and floral hops  A medium body pairs with gentle carbonation, resulting in a creamy yet dry beer that is quite refreshing for the abv. Finishes mostly dry with aa decent sweetness  While this is good, it did not come anywhere near the average on here. I suspect the high rating reflects much older batches, as I've heard this has changed a lot over the years. Oh well, I'm still happy I had it",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",Imperial IPA,98

287,17112,defunksta,3.58,"2022: Review:  Appearance: Pours a deep, rich golden color with a strong and thick off-white head. SRM of 10.  Aroma: Moderate aromas of agave, honeyed lemon, orange, nectarine. Sweet berry, honey with some slight dankness on the back end. Sweet and heavy.  Flavor: Moderate flavors of sweet lemon, agave nectar, honey, orange, and nectarine. Some sickly sweet pear and berries. Then a slight bitterness before a sweet finish.  Feel: Heavier bodied. Low carbonation. A tinge of bitterness lingers among the rich malts.  Compared to Lagunitas Super Cluster 4/11/22: Pours a darker color, larger head. Milder aromas. More sweet nectar/honey. Less orange hops. Sweeter and larger.  Overall: Again, a large honey malt body. Sweet, but appropriately relies on the honey and malts rather than having hop burn. Even a respectable bitterness to it.... Still too large and sweet for my preference. -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 2021 Review:  Appearance: Pours a clear, deep orange color with a large sticky white head. SRM of 15. (4.00)  Aroma: Only moderate aromas upfront of resinous mandarin orange, slight tropical citrus/melon, with some dank berry aromas before a deep layer of honey malt comes forth. Slight pine. (3.50)  Flavor: Hits with a wave of malts. In the middle, some candied orange, tropical fruit, dank berries, pine on the tongue. In the end it finishes with a wave of candied malts and honey. There's a bitterness presence here, but outmasked by the honey/malt sweetness.  Feel: Heavier bodied upfront. Only moderate carbonation. Hides the alcohol well within the malts. A rather dank and strong pine bitterness. Don't be fooled, it finishes heavy, sticky, and sweet, which isn't particularly pleasant.  Compared to Hop Valley Cryo Stash IPA 4/29/21: Pours a darker color with a larger head. Milder aromas. Light to moderate aromas of resinous mandarin orange. More caramel malt, honey, dank berry, and pine.  Overall: Not unlike my 2020 review, this one has a large malt body upfront, some mandarin orange and tropical, dank berry notes in the middle, before it's all cleaned off by a dank pine and strong honey/caramel sweetness. For some this beer is a reminder of home. Maybe a barleywine. For others, it's just an over-done IPA. If this beer was a pickup truck, it would be an F-150 excessively jacked up 8 feet with oversized tires. This beer can be made, not sure if it needs to be. --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 2020 Review: Appearance: Pours a completely clear, deep, orange color with a large, sticky, white head. SRM of 11-15. (4.00)  Aroma: Moderate aromas of tropical citrus, grapefruit, floral, and pineapple underneath a layer of honey. There's mandarin orange, grapefruit, pineapple, berry, but all masked by the honey sweetness. Lighter aromas than I expected. (3.50)  Flavor: A wave of candied fruit flavor. First it's candied necatarine, citrus and pineapple. Some berry and tropical melon too, but not as much. Then a moderately strong bitter citrus comes through at the end to finish sweet, but relatively bitter. (3.75)  Feel: Heavier bodied and sticky. Carbonation is no match for the sweetness. Actually hides the alcohol well though. Finishes heavy, sticky, and sweet. Not really resinous, but more honey-like and smooth. Leaves a sticky, cola type of sugar grittiness on the teeth. (3.50)  Overall: Not sure how to rate this one. Obviously way stronger than an IPA should ever be. It's packed with fruit sweetness and stickiness which is offputting. The only positive thing about it is that it hides the alcohol well underneath that. No alcohol burn. But this beer is like drinking the nectar out of a birdfeeder. There's a little bit of fruit in that honey.

It knocked my sox off it tasted so good; smells just slightly like an IPA, faintly hoppy; Ooh, the taste. It's unusual, and very pleasant; The mouthfeel is just right, perfect. It feels like beer. After two sips, this may be my new favorite beer. Well, later sips were a little less spectacular. We'll have to see if it becomes a favorite. I expect there may be more of it, but at $21.49 a six, probably not all that often.  2/9/21 The taste is full, robust, and it is somewhat bitter with a hint of sour. The taste of this second one didn't measure up to the first. But no adjustment to the score.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",Imperial IPA,98

At 15 dollars a six pack, I won’t be trying it again. It’s blended well, all the flavors come together nicely. The bitterness is there and satisfying.

287,17112,SierraNevallagash,4.08,"Tried this for the first time last year, but my review was deleted by *someone*? Nothing to compare this to, but if it's half as good as the last, then I am excited! Let's do.  12oz bottle (yes, bottle) - 2021 release - poured into a Spiegelau IPA glass at 38°F.  Pours a deep honey-golden, a touch amber, with two fingers of sticky off white head that leave some spotting being. Visible bubbles.  Nose: Clean pale malt - grainy, slightly sweet, slightly bready with some honey drizzled and toasty caramel malt notes, and then just stacked woth big fresh hop notes. Floral, herbal, fir sap, lots of resins - grassy, dank, and pithy with and that Simcoe musty West Coast thing. Some hints of tangerine, pineapple, and persimmon.  Palate: Hopslam greets the palate with big sweet crystal malts and a bit of honey biscuit quality - bready, and just that classic, almost barleywine malt sweetness. Atop that, lots of West Coast leafy hop notes - dank Simcoe, tangerine, dried papaya, green leafy cones, candied citrus, and some classic spicy and herbal boiled hop notes. The finish is honey malt sweetness, malted barley, and by now, yhe hops begin to exhibit some sweet dried apricot, white grape, and some vaugue fruity bits, lacking any real pine or pith, but some resinous bitterness appears.  Mouthfeel/Body: This one's pretty full-bodied. Heavy, slick, and weighty. The effervescence is lower, but helps a bit, and the hops dry out a touch on the finish, but the sweetness lingers. Hint of stickiness left around the lips.  Overall: Last year's batch was my first ever Hopslam, and it blew me away. For some reasons (HELP!) several of my reviews have completely vanished, including that one. Is this a good DIPA? Yeah, it's great. But from what I remember of the last batch, this is an entirely different beer. Less hops, more sweetness, and non of that beautiful character that made it so unique. Last one reminded me a lot of Pliny. This lacks that entirely. This drinks more like a weird alternate dimension Bigfoot. I bought several packs of last year's....I'm happy with just a single of this. Hopefully the last one wasn't just a fluke.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",Imperial IPA,98
287,17112,davisdahlberg6,4.67,"Enjoyed on tap at Flying Saucer which is Memphis TN. A: Pours a dark gold copper color. Clear with no haze. Still about a half inch of foam after the waitress and brought it to the table, from that I judge the retention time to be fairly good. S: Smells very hoppy with scents of caramel and a sweet honey fragrance. T: bold hop flavor really slams the tastes buds (pun intended). Malt tastes of caramel and gives the aftertaste a bit of sweetness which balances out the bitterness on the front end. The abv is very well hidden and not noticeable. F: Great feel, not too light or heavy. The right amount of body and carbonation. O: Fantastic! One of the best IPAs I’ve had. The bitter and hop flavor is wonderful, but the malt makes it a well balanced beer with a complex flavor.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",Imperial IPA,98
287,17112,HalfFull,3.62,"12 oz. bottle poured into a tulip glass. Pours a fairly clear orange copper in color with a thin cap of off white foam. Fair retention though settling to some spottiness.  Bold hop aromas on the nose, coupled with some some honey rich malt notes and a waft of ethanol. Doesn't exactly blast the hops as you gotta get into the glass to find them.  Taste seems a bit muddled with sweetness evident on the finish. Not a whole lot of malt character as honey notes take center stage but do mask the alcohol well. Some citric hop spice on the finish breaks the monotony to a degree and keeps the mouthfeel from being overly cloying given the ABV.  Overall a decent quaff but not what I expected from such a highly lauded brew. We'll see if a little warming improves things.

287,17112,imnodoctorbut,4.37,"bottle packaged 1/7/21  pours a clear, deep orange-tinged gold body with an off-white frothy foam head that reaches a finger and a half and has moderately high retention, leavings copious splatters of thin webs of sticky lacing as it settles to a halo  aroma is HOP, then honeyed malt. the HOP throws floral yet earthy, pungent-near dank (until ripped back by herbal) and of course citric vibes all over the place. bouquet of amazing, covering many profiles (er, you know, like, 6?)  bless this malt bill, y'all. a solid platter of deep, rich honeyed malt provides the perfect backbone on which to sit a masssssive bundle of hop profiles. sips and gulps are regularly rotated - it's easy, but layered and interesting, especially for the hop lover. slowing down we damn-near equal helpings of the following: herbal, earthy grapefruit, resinous-pine-near-oil-concentrate, floral orange & lemon, and honeyed peach. further investigation finds that the herbal and resinous pine take the majority, but the others are there right behind, mostly culminating in a Citra vibe on the wings.  mouthfeel is moderately low carbonation with a medium body. it balances a near-oily body with carbo/booze prickles for a pretty easy sail through, ending dry and earthy bitter.  overall: QUITE the spread here, folks. I would be hard-pressed to name drop another IPA that covers this much hop ground as elegantly as it does. if you love hops, this will be a great exp addition, and would work wonders with an IPA tasting flight if you're into that kinda thing. would totally have this last on the list in that case though, bringing it all home. it leans towards herbal in the 4th quarter, but still holds on to the fruity Citra to the bitter end. (get it?) DIPA/ImpIPA easiest drinker of the year award for sure though, as a side note. last remarks: I am totally not a huge ""herbal/parsley"" IPA fan, and this one dips hard into that territory towards the end of the glass especially, with the malt backbone lightening up and the honey and citrus fading a bit. that's why my ""overall"" is a 4.25 rather than siding with the ""first few sips"" score of 4.5 ///",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",Imperial IPA,98

Aroma is very mild for me, but the enjoyable array of hops certainly are noticeable. Nice and crisp smelling. The taste is the best part - a pleasant party of hops having a romp in my mouth and I'm not sure if I want to sip or gulp it. The feel is good, at least IMO it matches what this is, a midwestern DIPA. Not too thin, not to thick, just nice.

Flavor is lightly caramel malt, citrus and piney hops, orange, grapefruit, pine, light stone fruit, hints of tropical fruit; complex and a bit boozy. Medium bodied with light to moderate creaminess, nice body and mouth feel. I see what all the fuss is about with this IPA. The hopping is West Coast leaning, with lots of citrus and pine, but there is also nice layers of apricot and peach as well as mixed tropical fruit notes. Lingering pine and citrus rind resinous finish with both aggressive hop bitterness and herbal hop flavors. I got this can round-about from California and it is not quite as fresh as I would like, but really still has both depth and intensity of flavor.

287,17112,hophead723,4.52,"I got a six pack of cans of this at Trader Joes for $18.99, it better be World Class! Poured into m Samuel Smith glass.  Look: The most incredible, epic, fluffy, and gorgeous head of foam I have ever seen on a beer. The silky, glimmering foam contains a universe of different sized bubbles. It lingers entirely throughout, staying strong and steady all the way down the glass. The color is a perfect golden amber, with a good amount of carbonation streaming through the slightly hazed body.  Smell: Apricot, grapefruit pith, mango, mild stonefruit, and a kiss of honey are present in the delightful aroma. I also detect caramel and bread as it warms, with the malt aromas becoming more present I detect honeysuckle, pumpernickel crust, biscuit dough, and fresh walnuts, and a slight whiff of the alcohol.  Taste/Feel: The taste is big apricot, grapefruit, lime, peach, and incredibly smooth waves of glorious pine all carried by the soft and rich mouthfeel. A smoothly bitter pine-resin bite coats the tongue pleasantly, only for a complex wave of honey, biscuit, and caramel malt to balance it out. The lingering bitterness is grapefruit pith and pinecone flavored. The honey has clearly been used to up the ABV and in no way makes Hopslam sweet, and also adds natural complexity. The end result is you can taste and feel the quality and excellence exhibited by this beer.  Overall: Incredible. It is so easy to drink. It isn't boozy at all, and the bitterness is perfectly balanced. I really enjoyed the overall quality of the brew. It is so smooth and easy to drink while packing a well-executed wallop.

A bit of a Pixie Stix powderiness. Bitterness solid. M: Medium bodied with moderate carbonation. Tingly.

287,17112,Explorer_Bill,4.71,Wow! I’m a fan. Amber orange with a really nice long lasting head and impressive lacing. Citrus and sweet fruit fragrance with a bit of a toast note as well. The upfront taste is citrusy but finished slippery pine. Honestly I hadn’t noticed the ABV percentage before I ordered and I must admit it’s well contained and not really as boozy as I expect at 10% ABV.,Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",Imperial IPA,98

As soon as I popped open the can, the smell put a smile on my face.  Tastes just as it smells, of super bitter pine and some fruitiness. Hard to tell it is 10%abv.

Smell: Pine, citrus/citrus peel, caramel, and bread. Taste: Follows the nose, bitter earthiness is balanced out by an equally intense honey sweetness. Feel: Full-medium body, dry/sticky, relatively light carbonation. Overall: A classic, and a yearly release worth checking out every year.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",Imperial IPA,98

(Too busy enjoying the beer -so you know where this is going. ;) )  Almost-clear orange-amber, with substantial off-white head, that leaves about 1"" of lacing.  Smell is light pine, mixed citrus, bready malt, and a sweet floral aroma.  Taste is pine, caramelized bread crust (think toasted raisin bread, or other sweet breads), & a light bit of grass and honey.

287,17112,Hooded,4.86,"Notes from 1/29/2020. The only other Bell’s beer I've had is Two Hearted Ale which I didn't like. 12oz can poured into a tulip glass. The body is amber with two fingers of white foam receding at a normal rate leaving a cap. There is a large amount of moderately thick lacing all the way down the glass. 4.75 The aroma is closer to medium than strong. The nose is of ripe mango, ripe peach, and is slightly piney, and there's something sweet that might be the honey. The aroma is more complex than any other IPA I have had. 5.00 The taste is strong, complex, and intensely bright and exploding with hops. In support are mango, peach, some lemon, a hint of apple, and a strongly bitter piney finish. There's also many flavors that I cannot identify. How in the world did they hide the alcohol flavor when it has 10% ABV? 4.75 The mouth feel is between medium and thick, and is creamy. Okay, I drank all 12oz before I could finish the review. I feel more of a buzz from one can of this beer than any other beer. I'll just pop open another can. 4.75 Overall, Hopslam Ale is a sensory overload. It's amazing that such a powerfully hopped beer is not just good, but complex in aroma and flavor, and delicious. 5.00",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",Imperial IPA,98

Appears amber, medium lacing and a head that dropped quickly. Smells citrusy, piney, bready, floral. Taste follows the nose, hop forward, plenty of malt backbone, not boozy tasting at 10% ABV. Amazing! Mouth feel is medium plus for the style. Overall one of the better beers I've had this year.

287,17112,DavetotheB,4.27,"From a 12oz can dated 1/10/20 into a pint glass. Pours an amber color with a slight murkiness and about two fingers of white head which dissipates slowly leaving a moderate amount of lacing. Smells sweet. Definitely some tropical and citrus in there but something I couldn't place-then I saw it was brewed with honey! Taste follows with some malty sweetness and definitely honey. A bit of alcohol in there as well-not overpowering-respectable for 10% abv. Mouthfeel is an interesting combo of dry and sticky with a great bitter hop kick on the swallow. Overall-does it live up to the hype? I don't know if anything does. It's a widely available well made brew. Price point is a little painful: $23 for a sixer, which I'm glad here's five more of these to go.

Smells pretty weak with more of an alcohol/piney aroma. Feels nice and sticky in the mouth almost like a melted piece of hard candy that coats your teeth. Taste is much stronger than the nose with nice fruit and pine notes. Very west coast old school bitter with just the slightest alcohol burn. In 2020 this definitely isn't what it was in 2014 or so with so many hop bombs available, but it's still a crisp and nice drinking double that goes down smooth for the amount of alcohol in it.

Taste is perfect balance of bitter, honey, & malt. The best in my recollection of Hopslam releases. Mouthfeel is also what I would want & expect from a 2xipa - smooth & silky. Very little alcohol burn for the ABV. I fear that I could hurt myself drinking these. Will need to pace myself.

287,17112,Wolvmar,4.46,"Jan 2021 Review 2021 vintage. Forgot to check bottles on date. Poured into Bell’s pint glass  Maybe being lazy but not much has changed. Slightly less head and lacing than in past years. Nose and taste are pretty much spit on. Great beer. No change to ratings.  Jan 11 2020 Review 2020 vintage. 12oz can dates 01-03-20 poured into a Bell’s pint glass.  Pretty much the exact same as the 2019 review. Maybe a bit more head, but nose and taste are extremely consistent. Love this beer. Pour 4.25 Nose 4.5 Taste 4.5 Mouthfeel 4.25 Overall 4.5  =====  2019 vintage. 12oz can.  Pour: thick, golden, burnt orange color. Two finger head that leaves a ring, clouds and lots of lacing. (4.25)  Nose: despite the name, the nose is sweet malt with a side of citrus and pine hops. (4.5)  Taste: like the nose, malt is what really stands out and in a very good way. The hops are complimentary. Slight honey sweetness adds to the profile. (4.5)  Mouthfeel: moderate carbonation. Thick, viscous feel. Again, lots of bready malt character. (4.25)  Overall: love this beer but it’s misnamed. Should be Maltslam with a side of hops. Absolutely worth trying but don’t be surprised if it’s not what the name implies. (4.5)",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",Imperial IPA,98

The only thing hurting Hopslam(and most great beers) nowadays is the price gouging! The beer stores here are ruthless and almost criminal if it weren't for the people buying it from them!

287,17112,Jesterr44,4.13,"Looks like an amber ale really; just a touch of light haze, fluffy off-white head fades down to a thin film moderately quickly - some pretty decent lacing during drinking. Aroma of sweet caramel malt & piney hops. Not much of anything in the fruit department. Taste follows with a smack of piney hop & full malt backbone. Sip ends with a long lingering boozy taste & feel - pleasant but definitely also letting you know it's packing a 10.2% ABV. I don't taste the honey per se, but there is a hint of sweetness - maybe a tinge of strawberry? - which is barely tasted, but seems to dampen the potential astringency of the hops. Not sure what I expected from this - certainly a classic I've never tried before, from a time before fruity NEIPAs - the better of which I've really come to prefer. I would definitely have this again, it's a great beer, but I'm also fine crossing it off my list & not worrying about seeking it out again.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",Imperial IPA,98

And, now that Bell's distributes to NJ, it's time to check it out for myself. Let's dive in!  Great looking beer in the glass. Somewhere in between deep gold and pale amber. Slight haze. Large, frothy, persistent white head that leaves behind a good amount of lacing.  Complex aroma that runs the gamut of hop descriptors. No shortage of grapefruit, pine, and orange. Maybe even some melon too? Sure, why not. Once you get past that, especially as the beer warms, there is this beautiful floral, herbal, earthy aspect to it. Even perfume comes to mind. Really impressive.  Heavy malt and honey sweetness show up in the flavor. The balances really shifts to the malt here and the finish is sweet and bitter.  Medium-full bodied, sticky, and almost syrupy. Slightly warming from the 10% ABV.  This is an old school Imperial IPA.

T: This reminds me of the base ingredients of a Don the Beachcomber/Trader Vic Tiki drink. The base flavors are honey mix and grapefruit juice. The hops make them selves known. There's a floral flavor throughout.  M/F: Hopslam goes down very easily - its medium consistency and light carbonation combine with the flavors mentioned above to create a top notch AIIPA.

This beer lands right in my wheelhouse with a bite of hop with a smooth slightly rich yet clean taste and finish. The 10% is nowhere to be found giving it an insane drinkablity. Just enough fizz to tingle the tongue with a easy medium feel. Honey plays a part in this beer and for me creates a very unique imperial IPA that I very much enjoy.

T- The taste is extremely well thought out, and surprisingly refreshing for an imperial IPA. Citrusy and fruity hops make up for a sweet and malty flavor immediately. The flavor is abrupt, refreshing, and memorable. F- Medium bodied, but extremely fresh and rewarding. Nice carbonation at the end. O- Probably the best imperial IPA I have every had. It packs a punch alcohol wise, and you can't even tell there is any there... A bit dangerous I could say. But it's pretty astonishingly refreshing. The hop presence is lively and fresh, and it's as sweet as you could imagine. Altogether beautifully made beer. I loved every sip of it.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",Imperial IPA,98

287,17112,MoMaMe,4.38,"Picked up only one can because of the price, but will definitely get more. Impressive!  Pours a very clear light amber with a medium head that lingers for a long time. Smell: light, sweet, hoppy, dried fruit Taste: stronger than smell. Good balance of sweet and bitter. Bitterness lingers on the palate but with rich flavor. Notes are honey, dried fruit, pear, floral, mild pine, and a touch earthy. At 10%, the alcohol is very noticeable. The honey adds a nice balance of sweetness that is not overbearing. Mouthfeel is incredibly smooth and full-bodied.  Very nice IIPA! Definitely worth looking for.

287,17112,SB2017,4.14,"Looks quite beautiful, with an off-white pinky of foam and generous bubbles rising. A deep amber on this beer, nearly verging on a red ale's color. The head dissipates at a moderate pace, leaving behind bountiful lace. On the nose it's round, sweet, and spicy. Milder than I imagined, but altogether supremely well balanced. A cacophony of flavor from the get-go, with the best texture to a beer I've perhaps ever tasted. Utterly creamy and decadent, with significant grassy and malty notes to go around. Strong taste of weed, much like a Stella has, but with a good wheaty kick at the end. The beer keeps on giving, with something new to taste every sip. Ultimately, I will have to drink this with food. There's simply too much flavor to stand on its own, and I'm getting overstimulated with each taste. If this is your jam, pick up this beer. It's really something, and I'm terrifically impressed by Bell's yet again.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",Imperial IPA,98

Tons of lacing. As IPAs go, this isn't super aromatic. It's very floral, and that's backed up by some ripe stonefruit notes. There's a very solid malt backbone underpinning the flavor profile. Pretty high in sweetness / residual sugars as something labeled an ""IPA"" goes, though not out of character for a 10% ABV monster. A touch of lingering hop bitterness on the finish.

Poured golden liquid into a glass and watched it rest beneath a puffy white head. Looks the part of an excellently crafted non-hazy IPA, for sure - more clear than cloudy, equal parts amber and honey-gold.  Aroma is ruby red grapefruit, caramel, honey, pine and orange zest. Wonderful balance considering the double-digit ABV. Taste is right there with a touch of honey-sweetness followed by an subtle earthiness.  Smooth as all get-out with reasonable alcohol heat.

287,17112,jrc1093,4.23,"Canned on 1/10/19  Pours a deep golden burnt orange with a steady white head; higher level retention eventually leaves a formidable wall of semi-thick lacing; a clear, exceptional-looking nectar of a beer.  Aroma brings concentrated notes of ultra-dank pine, herbal sweet malts, pithy grapefruit, a pungent forality, and dank citrus rind; more of a hop-malt balance upfront here, with the bouquet hinting toward an underlying intensity.  Taste hints of dank citrus rind with an intense stream of raw hop resin coursing through the center of the profile onward, and touched by hints of honeyed malt toward the back end; intense, bitter, but excellently balanced by the honey.  Mouthfeel shows an incredibly smooth medium body topped with creamy carbonation; prickly and hugely refreshing resinous tones from the hops build throughout; primarily dry near the finish, but with an almost syrupy slickness faintly in the background adding some depth.  Excellently-crafted heavy hitter of an older style IPA; impressive in its balance of both flavor profile and mouthfeel, as well as a finely-tuned, condensed hop intensity.

287,17112,ichorNet,4.38,"Here goes nothing. The highly-vaunted HopSlam finally flows into my glass via a can dated 1/9/19, meaning that not only did Bell's recently get distribution in New England, but they're paying extra-good attention to the dates they get stuff out here by! Now that is how you treat a new market... I feel very lucky to have this beer right now, that's for sure. I've heard so much about it, and now it's finally time to sink my teeth into it.  Pours a slightly-hazy medium-amber/golden color with no notable hop/yeast particulate in the body. Head builds up to about three fingers at first, but eventually it settles to about a half-finger with soapy lace show and medium legs. Surface is pretty much covered in the same foam, but a little less dense. A fairly good pour with an air of classiness to it. It's not crazy, but it's not boring or underwhelming. I approve!  The nose reminds me a lot of Sierra Nevada's Hop Bullet, and maybe I'll get some hate for comparing an older beer by a much-loved brewery to a newer IPA from an even-older, maybe-more-well-liked brewery, but that was the first thing that came to mind. Strong tangerine/grapefruit and lemon verbena notes with some catty dankness and pine resin. Slight peach/nectarine with a little suggestion of the honey they used in this one. I have had some excellent honey-infused IPAs over the past year or two, and this is definitely the godfather of such an idea, and it deserves to be appreciated for that! That said, I would like this to be a little more aromatic than it is... it doesn't jump out of the glass quite as much as I'd prefer.  On the other hand, the flavor profile is sticky and super-satisfying. I get a bit of citrusy juiciness right upfront combined with some suggestions of stone fruit, grassy hops, pine-resin stickiness and pithy bitterness toward the finish. The honey is prevalent here, surprisingly enough. It really punches through the semi-heavy body and gives a nice balance to the proceedings. I was assuming it would totally be fermented out, but I was proven wrong... light florals and herbal elements definitely congeal in the mid-to-finish of each sip, lending a very full bodied and complex flavor to this classic. And I now understand why it is considered a classic. It may have been the first commercially-distributed triple IPA, after all. Why isn't that a style on BA...?",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",Imperial IPA,98

Smell: Resinous and somewhat dank. Primarily lemon zest, but also some orange and grapefruit on the tail end. Some booziness.  Taste: Sweet honey and resin upfront, a little grass. Grapefruit, some sweet citrus and pine, a hint of lemon. A touch of breadiness to balance out the sweetness, but I know it'll only build as this beer gets older.  Feel: Drinks super light right now for 10%. Semi-oily and smooth, clean finish but not dry.  Overall: This beer is really nice when super fresh. Stands out from the rest of today's DIPAs with its huge honey sweetness, doesn't veer towards the pine bomb WCIPAs that much or NEIPAs in the slightest. Still a winner 15(?) years after batch 1, at least when fresh. I remember standing in lines for this bad boy, now it's almost always readily available when in season.

T: Green and oily up front with soft herbal tones and perhaps a touch of scallion. This soon transitions to full blown citrus. Bitter white grapefruit, lemon peel, pulpy orange.

The taste is outstanding and consists of loads of fruit: grapefruit, lemon, orange, tangerine, mango and passionfruit. There’s also some weaker piney hops, herbal hops, malt, caramel, bread and vanilla. Smooth mild mouthfeel with a little bit of creaminess the coats the palate. Nice carbonation. Outstanding flavors with a great balance between the slightly bitter hoppiness and sweeter malt backbone. Perfect amount of bitterness at the finish.

287,17112,DoghouseReilly3946,4.13,"Date: Canned on 01/15/19, revisited on 01/21/19.  Appearance: Pours out a nice dark and almost hazy copper orange color with two fingers worth fluffy off white head. Fairly standard but it looks nice.  Aroma: While I am no haze craze fanboy, I will admit that they by and large are much more aeromatic. Not to say that this doesn’t smell good, it does but it never seems to explode with the bouquet of aromas which I am now used to. Anyway, I get a lot of sweet honey up front which has an almost burnt aspect to it or perhaps caramelized is a more accurate word. There is also the standard pine, bitter grapefruit zest, and a decent amount of tea leaf aroma and green onion. For it’s name, Hopslam lacks some of the deep, bitter, resinous elements of other double and triple IPAs, at least on the aroma.  Taste: The taste fairs better than the nose as there is an initial rush of assorted hops that overtake the palate before dropping back to allow for the honey to come forward. The honey sweetness rises quite quickly and just as the question “is this getting too sweet?” creeps into my head, the hops return with that deep resinous prickly hop bite and bitterness that was missing from the nose. While the bitterness isn’t anything wildly out of the norm for an IPA this big, the fresh hop bite lingers for a good while and has a little spicy burn. There is a notable floral taste in here as well, perhaps it is a hop variety or maybe they used wildflower honey. I also get some deep herbal notes as well, but nothing that is really definable. The mouthfeel is medium-full standard DIPA style and pleasant enough. It has a standard chunky malt backbone which veers a little too close to the syrup like character of say Dogfish Head 90 Minute. The rush for Hopslam seems to have subsided over the past several years and I can understand why to some degree. The first time I had it, I thought it was awesome, of course that was three hundred beers ago. It is still a well made and enjoyable offering but for the price and limited timeframe of availability, it simply cannot compete with many of the beers being churned out by many of the newer smaller more adventurous local breweries. I get the feeling that Bells has become complacent riding on Hopslam and several other limited releases, everything now unfortunately feels old hat about this one. Hopslam even has some trouble when compared to the, honestly somewhat better and cheaper year round offerings like Stone Ruination.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",Imperial IPA,98

287,17112,micada,4.41,"Had a can of this 2018 vintage for the first time a few months ago and was not impressed, despite the high ratings. I decided not to review back then, figuring maybe I was just missing a DIPA boat because I'm really more a stout guy. It's really hot outside now, I like cold IPA style when it's hot, I saw the beer store clerk had this stashed in a cold hiding place, so I bought it for a second try.  Waaaay better than last time! In hindsight, the first cans were comparatively flat and syrupy, so they were probably allowed to get too warm. This batch is delicious. Nose is lemony, grapefruity up front, maybe some pine in the back. Color is slightly hazy yellow-gold. Poured hard into a barrel glass created a small head that persisted, due to a crazy amount of carbonation. This has been the first time I've seen that level of active bubbles from deep down the glass since I had Pliny the Elder forever ago. Side note: if there's anything local in the Buffalo, NY area I can trade for some Pliny...hit me up!  First sips are citrus and pine, slightly bitter but balanced by the honey. Very crisp mouthfeel, refreshing aftertaste. Alcohol hides well, but has a slight presence. Very easy drinker on this hot, humid night.  Considering how the carbonation really made the difference, IMO, from last time with Hopslam, I think this might be the same issue I had with the Lawson's Sip Of Sunshine, so I might have to retry a pack that has stayed frosty.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",Imperial IPA,98

Pours a deep orange, with a nice three finger head of frothy foam that leaves patches of heavy lace as it settles.  A vibrant array of lemon, grass, and floral hops hit your nose. Fresh honey and light bready malt linger.  The flavors here are really nice. The honey isn’t overwhelming or too sweet, and the bitter, floral hops return and dissolve into a malty finish.

Im not really getting much to be honest. Taste up front is grapefruit subdued by some malt backbone. Followed quickly into mid palate orange with some noticeable alcohol burn. I get some subtle honey but thats probably bevause im looking for it. Rather clean end palate with lingering burn from the booze. Mouthfeel is nice with adequate coating of the palate. For all the hype i expected more. This seems to be an average beer with nothing that really stands out.

287,17112,ScaryEd,2.36,"Poured on tap at a bar in Tempe, Arizona.  Pours a clear golden color with a white sheet of head. Leaves zero lacing before the head completely dissipates into nothingness.  The aroma brings notes of pine. That's it. Hey I love a good pine bomb but I also like balance. No honey, no citrus, no tropical fruits. Just pine. A lumberjack wouldn't like this shit.  The taste actually brings some citrus into the mix. There's some oranges and a touch of grapefruit before a wave of chalky aspirin humps my taste buds. There's some malt on the backbone so it gets a point for that. Otherwise, entirely bland and unnecessarily bitter.  The feel is thin with moderate carbonation. It's thin, yet somehow sticky. Solve that one, nerds. Alcohol is barely present which is neat.  Overall, a pretty damn awful DIPA. I don't care how hyped up this beer is, I just didn't like it. I'd gladly give it another chance if I ever got some bottles but other than that I'm not impressed.

Overall: A bit sweeter than I like in my DIPAs, but this is a very good beer, as I was gifted a 6-pack.

It smells divine. It doesn't have the malt some DIPA's do so it doesn't have the sweet aroma but the hops make it a good smeller. The honey plays a great hidden role in this beer The head fades and the lacing is great. The taste is good and the alcohol is acceptable. I can't tell I'm drinking a 10 percenter , so smooth, delicious and satisfying. But you'll take notice after two of these bad-boys, if it takes that long. A great beer overall that uses honey to sweeten it as opposed to malts. Worth trying for sure and a nice change for DIPAs.

287,17112,MittenBreezeMD,4.33,"I’ve drank this beer numerous times, but it’s not until I try a fresh can from across the country that I feel the need to rate this beer. Here is my best shot. Look: pours smooth amber orange with a nice head yet still quite clear. Little to no Haze. Smell: Pungent smell of citrus, pine, earthy, and resinous hops in what seems to be mostly flavor. Not the sharp clean scent of a dry hop, but rather a plethera of hops covering a strong honey malt smell. Taste: Strong, bitter, and in your face. To those that may feel this is a turn off, trust me, this is not. This is a high gravity beer, so expecting anything “light and breezy” would just be a novice mistake. This beer has been hopped in a wild and Cluster f***ed of a manner to balance the dry honey base and full carmel malty body. Feel: In all, the beer lathers the palate with warm, carmely honey notes, and yet the string of a complex bitterness. The high abv definitely lingers, but for a beer this big that is a moot point.  Overall, definitely my favorite beer from Bell’s. Coming from Michigan, I am uber critical of beers, but I am glad to see that the high demand from across the country has still proven to the success of this beauty!",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",Imperial IPA,98
287,17112,citizencane,3.96,"Pours yellow with decent head. Leaves a remarkable amount of lacing down through the glass, making it obvious where the glass emptied down to on each sip. Smell is citrus and floral notes, and honey. Taste is similar but hops come through more clearly. Feel is a touch dry, but this seems to be balanced a bit by the honey. Still, the dryness lingers. Overall, solid beer, nothing less than I’d expect from Bell’s. Not quite worth the hype, maybe, but a good beer.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",Imperial IPA,98
287,17112,RedhawkPoke,4.46,"A: Beer pours a golden orange body with a thick two fingers' worth of head. Large amounts of lacing and head remain behind while drinking.  S: Beer's aromas give off a strong floral smell coming out of the can. Hops are very dominant here. There is a small amount of sweetness coming from the beer, likely from the addition of honey.  T: Tastes are similar to the beer's nose but with a stronger honey taste. Large amounts of hops present in the beer. The hops give off a nice bitter taste that mixes well with the honey and high ABV for the style.  M: Medium bodied beer with a nice amount of carbonation. The beer does have some bite due to the higher ABV, but the alcohol is blended well with other areas and isn't a major issue. Pretty smoth drinker.  O: Very nice beer. Lots of hops and a nice example of a West Coast IPA. The addition of honey cuts through favorably on the DIPA. The beer's aromas are too one dimensional but a really good beer regardless.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",Imperial IPA,98
287,17112,Ahypercube,4.78,"Very good DIPA. I am certainly impressed. That said, I've had better for the price. Not my favorite that I have tried, but I would put it at #4, under Hoptimum, Double Jack, and Unfiltered Enjoy By. Probably the mildest in flavor of those.  L: Transparent orange body with a bit of haze. Tons of head, tons of carbonation, and sticky lacing. Looks as expected.  A: Definitely a lot of Simcoe. Papaya, passion fruit, pineapple, orange and lemon lead, with some plum and raspberry in the middle, and pine and grapefruit for the finish. This smells very West Coast, surprisingly. A bit of malt comes through with a funk very similar to BO and some honey.  T: Super drinkable for the abv. Holy crap this is impressively tasty. Honey is an extremely important part of this beer, and it fits like a man in a tailored suit. The tropical fruit is balanced at first by a strong white pepper note, then the sweetness from the honey flares up, then the pine and grapefruit bitterness sets in, taking it to a smooth, but strongly herbal finish, fitting to the style.  F: Damn. Just enough body, and yet super crisp.  O: This is the best brew I've had from Bell's yet. Super flavorful, but not too wild. At $20 a six-pack, however, I don't see myself buying very many of these in the near future.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",Imperial IPA,98

There is an underlying slightly sweet something that may be malt, or honey, or both.  Flavor on entry is hop forward with a surge that jumps out and lands with both feet on the palate. There is a firm bitterness that quickly builds larger all the way into the aftertaste where it features prominently. I searched for sweetness but didn't really notice any except in the back of the palate where it moderated the hops somewhat.  Full texture with balancing carbonation.  Altogether an interesting brew that plays a wide range of flavor notes from low to high in a fairly well integrated and complex fashion.

Very well balanced with plenty of malt supporting the hops and very slightly sweet from the honey. Moderately thick mouth feel. Bitter with a moderation from the malts and honey in the finish, eventually transitioning to a bitter lingering aftertaste.

The aromas are strong and not at all muddled--juicy grapefruit, honey, and floral notes all take turns pleasing the nose.  The flavors are equally nuanced and enjoyable, although there is just a hint of ""burn"" from the booze that is a little heavy, even for the double-IPA style.  The mouthfeel is excellent. Slick and crisp all at once, with plenty of body, but no extra weight.

Smells pineapplely with some pear and green apple, i barely detect the honey but its there. Taste was a lil mehh for me as there wasn't much to make it stand out from many others. Really well balanced but there's no explanation point anywhere that brings the hype. Grapefruit and pine, but not too bitter or astringent, not too sweet either which i find a problem with a lot of dipas. No honey taste for me. Mouthfeel was spot on though, you knew you were drinking a hefty beer on abv but still extremely smooth and perfect balance between crisp and sticky. Overall great beer but will probably be the last hopslam i buy, way too pricey. Price analogy: If two hearted and hopslam were in school, two hearted would be the kid that put their time in studying but went to the bar every night, got laid and still got an A; hopslam lived in the library 24/7 and got an A+... id rather chill with two-hearted.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",Imperial IPA,98

It has a nice juicy hop aroma with a full pineapple-pear cocktail note that goes the distance.  The taste doesn't have as much of the juice but is balanced and very smooth. The alcohol is apparent but doesn't seem to detract from the overall taste. Some sweetness is layered in with the hop bitterness but I'm not picking out any honey in particular. The finish is rather clean with a small zesty aftertaste.  The body is to the light side of medium and I find the carbonation to be in the same neighborhood.  Damn good brew!

Don't expect your wife or girlfriend who drinks fruited Berliners to enjoy more than a nip of this Light to slightly above light feel. Not a problem for the style.  Very noticeable lacing on the glass. Plenty carbonated.  It's been very popular for the last 5 years or so to put the knock on this beer and to complain about how it's become dated and doesn't hold it's own against the current crop of haze/juice bombs. This may be true to a certain extent but like way too many things these days, it's mostly predatory anti-hype. Hopslam is still an excellent double IPA, well worth picking up once a year.  Very pricey though, I do agree with this. Enjoy.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",Imperial IPA,98

Another winner from Bells.,Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",Imperial IPA,98
287,17112,FullOfHopkins,4.67,"I assumed this beer was overhyped but I was wrong. Let me start this by saying I do NOT like IPAs and do I did not expect to like this. Pour is a really nice light golden color with a good head that recedes but lingers throughout. Honestly the smell is my least favorite part of this beer because it reminds me of straight up pine. But the taste... man it is delicious. And to reiterate, I really, really do not like IPAs or even most light beers, but this stuff is exceptional. It’s the perfect balance of bitter and sweet. The hops are definitely really prominent but it’s also got a really smooth, sweet wave that’s predominately honey with a bit of that pine scent coming through. I would never guess this is a 10% beer either, which only adds to the overall greatness. It feels great in the mouth, light and smooth and easy to drink.  Overall, really exceptional beer that I didn’t think I would like. I was fortunate enough to load up on it this time around, I’m going to try to save it but it’ll be hard not to drink it all right away.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",Imperial IPA,98
287,17112,NathanBeets,4.34,"A bit let down from this. I don’t see this being a borderline world-class brew. Although it is very well balanced, Hopslam is missing something for me.  Still enjoyable.

I have crystal Spiegelau IPA glasses, but will leave the details to others much more qualified. ;-) The shelf life is only 3 months. According to the brewer, it is still good after 3 months, but should no longer go by the name ""Hopslam"", since the taste will change. I bought a case since this is allocated to stores in the area, and hard to come by. There will be no worry of it requiring a name change. All will be consumed within the next 2 weeks!

287,17112,Ltdsaint,4.39,"Good head, creamy, 3 finger. Body is a gold amber with a strong dark orange mid body. Smell is of hops, pine, maple, floral, as well as tropical fruits such as pineapple, peach and even some serious sweet notes. Its hard to pinpoint these sweet notes of taste due to my virgin IPA tongue of only two years, but this one is giving off a strong essence of sweet. The strong booziness is there, but not as recognizable as you would surmise. The taste is definitely similar to the taste in exception to the sweetness. Fantastic IPA for its first round, would buy again most def and definitely deserves a second or even third try.

287,17112,Vidblain,4.5,"Quite fresh, can date of... looks like 1/8? Not super legible.  Pours a nice amber-gold, transparent, no haze. Powerfully hoppy nose, sweetness already quite apparent. This ain't no NE IPA, ya'll.  I liked last year's release of Hopslam - but the funny thing to me is that I never really noticed just how sweet it is, and how present the honey is. It's a unique IPA - definitely not a NE and not a West Coast. It's mildly malty, nowhere on the level of a Founders Doom, but there's certainly some there in the mouth feel and taste. Again, it's sweet! Quite sweet. But, my girlfriend being the litmus test, the hops are still quite present - enough to be unpleasant to non-hops people.  This one isn't a beer that I want to drink multiples. I'll drink one and give up, or move on to something else.

The lacing is crazy, this beer left the inside of my glass looking like it was covered in soap suds. On the nose I am getting a lot of sweet floral notes as well as a bit of piney resiney goodness. On mouthfeel I am getting a surprising creamy texture and the co2 hits at the end. As to taste this beer is perfectly balanced, full bodied with enough bitterness to cut the honey which I was a bit afraid might add a bit too much sweetness. I’m getting a lot of citrus stone fruit and pine on the finish.

The head recedes to a thin ring and island leaving substantial lacing. The aroma is sweet caramel, citrus and pine. The taste is sweet caramel and honey flavors moving into sharp and clear piney bitterness. The booze in the aroma and taste comes out as it warms. Mouthfeel is medium bodied, adequately carbonated and somewhat dry in the finish. Overall, very good. All of these classics have a hard way to go compared to recent DDH bombs.

287,17112,Tshane,3.38,"I give this a high rating only despite the hops, not because of them. The flavors are wonderful except for the hoppy pine and bitterness.  In my other reviews I've explained I do not like hoppy beers, 30 IBUs is probably the highest I go in terms of truly enjoying a beer. But this one manifests not only in the bitterness but also in a piney floral scent that reminds me pleasantly of walking, as I did many years ago as a child, under pine trees at my grandmother's home in Northville Michigan, and at many Michigan campgrounds my family visited.  I would sit and enjoy the shade and the scent of the needles, which was probably enhanced by crushing them as I walked and sat on them.

Some balance with the pine, orange and malt, but the hops kicks all other tastes asses. Excellent firm mouth feel, bitter and pleasurable, texture firm, smooth going down.

287,17112,PlinyMeNow,4.19,"12 oz can poured into a Duvel tulip. At this time the beer is probably not anywhere close to its full potential as I bought and drank this can months after the package date! I was just happy that the store still had cases of it so long after production. The beer was definitely not skunked but may be significantly more mellowed than when fresh. Overall its hoppiness is on the dank and rich side, rather than the bright side, and I can't tell how much this is owing to its aging. I found it to be similar to Dogfish Head 90-minute IPA, with that same rich sweet malt backbone and balanced, full hop profile, only with the hops/spice/alcohol turned up a bit further. So I won't go into a detailed review and will just say that I enjoyed it and I'd like to revisit it when it's fresh.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",Imperial IPA,98
287,17112,Lone_Freighter,4.49,"She pours a light golden color and leaves the same colored body. A half finger white foamy head appears and lasts for about a half minute. Light sticky foamy lacing appears. The smell has a ton of piney hops (holy hops, Batman! - could there be any more in the smell?), citrus, and some light honey (more so as the beer warms). Light caramel and a slight malty presence comes in later in the beer. The taste has a large amount of bitter and sweet between the previously mentioned flavors. A bit of spiciness comes through as the beer warms. On the palate, she sits about a medium with nothing sharp on the tongue. This has got to be one of the smoothest DIPA’s I’ve ever had. The 10 % ABV is hidden very well, as I almost feel like I could pound this all day, very sessionable. The aftertaste is piney and the finish is sticky and bitter.

I don't say that without cause. The honey taste is sweet, but the underlying IPA bitterness really adds to the overall complexity. There's a series of events for your taste buds to experience with this one. This year's price was around $20.00 a 6 pack. I'm not a wealthy man, but I bought 8 where and when I could find them. It's worth a trip to their brewery, as well. They have several world class beers, and I don't see them slowing down. If you're truly a beer ""snob"", this one will put you on the edge of your seat!

287,17112,beergoot,4.26,"Re-visited February 10th, 2022  Honey-hued body, clear; hardly any visible carbonation yet the head is thick and frothy; gobs of foam stick to the glass. Malty, sweet aroma; herbal spiciness. Excellent taste; malt-forward initially, finishes with a spicy, peppery hop flavor; moderate, earthy sweetness. Heavy body; chewy and sticky on the palate; semi-dry feel overall.  This isn't the boldest version of this beer I've had, but perhaps the most balanced and approachable. I didn't pick up any honey presence per se but perhaps its presence manifests itself more in the mouthfeel. The 10% ABV is well-hidden and lets the malts, honey, and hops do their thing.

Powerful hop aroma; plenty of fruit aromas: pineapple, pear, strawberries. The taste follows along the lines of the aroma with sweet fruit flavors; a noticeable alcohol presence that blends well with the fruit sweetness and hop bitterness. Heavy body with a soft, velvety quality; boozy warmth sitting beneath some fine residual sugars; an extraordinary blend of sweet and dry on the palate.

Mouthfeel is fine. Not too thin, but just thin enough to be somewhat refreshing. Overall one of the better dipas I've tried.

287,17112,umichfan,2.89,"Maybe I'm missing something, but this is another beer that I'm not sure how it got rated in the BA250. I've only had the 2017 release, and have heard that prior years have been much better, so this is only the 2017 review.  Poured from a 12oz can into a snifter. Pours a golden, honeyish color that leans more amber, with a creamy white head. Slight haze to the body; the head stuck around and did lace nicely. From there, it went downhill. The nose was lacking & overbearingly sweet, especially for a DIPA. Coupled with lots of malt notes, a lot of the hop nose was overpowered.  The sweetness of the honey and how strong it came through is what shocked me most about this beer, to the point it's about all I could concentrate on. There's a flutterance of hop note that tries to compensate for the sweetness, but then the malt picks up on the tongue and the hop gets muddled. The overbearingness of the malt backbone and honey just didn't work in tandem with the Simcoe hop. Not enough bite to cut through the sweetness.  It finishes almost oily and lingers, but not in a way you'd like for a beer to linger. It's disappointing because Bell's puts out a lot of good product, but this, and especially for the price, is a huge miss in my book.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",Imperial IPA,98

Will never be my favorite, for sure, but glad I bought a sixer of it when it was out a few weeks ago. SOLID. 2019 version: at least .15 higher overall score, less cloying, less sweet.

287,17112,bhdc,2.26,"This review is for 2017 canned hopslam, consumed less than 14 days after bottling. Sadly, I am reviewing this year, as this beer was a real gem in the past. One of the interesting characteristics of Hopslam is the noticeable differences year to year. Unfortunately, I found the 2017 Hosplam to be astringent, boozy, and uninspiring. As usual, it is very hop forward, but only in bitterness. I found this year's Hopslam to be unbalanced and leaving an after taste of alcohol like a cheap Vodka. Thankfully, the beer does get better near the end, but hardly worth the wait or price. Temperature variations do not seem to provide any appreciable character. If I had to guess, I'd say mass production has led to the sad state of a beer that was once (for me, at the very least) so sought after.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",Imperial IPA,98

287,17112,D9sus4,4.85,"I have been fortunate enough to find Hopslam on tap for the past few years. Always tastes a little better to me from a tap. Tastes more like the Imperial IPA that it is, than when poured out of a can. But, I would never pass it up in any form when I'm lucky enough to find it.  As Imperial IPAs go, this one is probably the most Hop forward I've ever tasted. But it doesn't have too much of that grapefruit hop taste, that's so popular right now, but that I don't like. But it varies from year to year, as its a true craft beer that depends on a lot of variables, like timing when to add the next dose of hops. That said, this year's Hoplam was the best I've ever tasted! 5 snifters from a tap, and two 6 packs...

287,17112,cascade_meister,4.31,"Enjoyed this freshly canned. Looks different from your stereotypical DIPA, pretty light bodied with a gold-like hue. Tastes much lighter than expected, most likely due to the honey undertones, and lacks the super hoppy taste that most DIPAs have. Surprisingly refreshing for a 10.5% beer and doesn't have the dry mouth feel to it that many heavy hitter DIPAs have. Overall this is a very good beer, but quite uncharacteristic of a DIPA.

287,17112,spoony,4.39,"From a 12 oz can (packaged on what appears to be January 23, 2017) into a tulip.  A-When I think about what an IPA (or IIPA) should look like, this is pretty close to what I have in mind. A tall, sticky off-white head is pillowy and dense. Retention is good and lacing is plentiful on the glass. The beer beneath is clear and light-golden-orange. A few bubbles creep up the center of the glass.  S-The aroma is intense and I like it. Lots of sweetness from the honey mixes with a pungent, powerful hop note. I sniff honey, bread crust, as well as orange zest, guava, lime, passionfruit, hints of pine and leaf, and a subtle herbal/dank note. Bitterness is high...this isn't a juice bomb, NE-style IPA.  T-The taste is similar to the smell with honey sweetness coming through clearly. The hops tend towards bitter and dank more than juicy and bright, but there is a good dose of pithy, zesty citrus fruitiness here. Alcohol is not concealed and there is a good bit of heat on the finish, along with a palate-scraping bitterness. The flavors on the finish suggest pepper and dandelion leaf.  M-The body is hefty with an active carbonation that fits the beer well. I also notice a heavy, oily hop residue.  O-This is one intense beer. I like the honey, which adds a lot of sweetness, but others may not. I don't know that I could drink more than one in a sitting, but at 10% ABV, I don't really need to.

287,17112,funk_master_flex,4.58,"First time enjoying this much hyped (but deserving) beer. Bought a 6-pack at Belmont Station in Portland, Oregon. I used my go to Avery 12 oz tulip glass to assess this beer.  Look: This beer pours a translucent golden, light orange color with a small white head that quickly dissipates. There are some light alcohol legs when swirled.  Aroma: Right up front you my nose gets smacked with pine and resin. There is some hint of grapefruit on the end followed by a very light wildflower/floral sweetness and caramel. As the beer warms up the boozy alcohol smell becomes much more apparent.  Taste: Again the taste is at first dominated by the pine with a very strong caramel malt backbone to support the somewhat aggressive bitterness of the hopping. As the beer warms up it becomes more sweet and boozy. Grapefruit and mango become more apparent as I continue to sip and there is definitely a discernible honey/wildflower sweetness that plays nicely with the hops. This beer actually becomes more enjoyable as it warms up and I am able to taste the honey much more near the end of the glass.  Feel: Low to moderate carbonation. Fairly light mouthfeel despite the strong caramel malt backbone. I think the honey thins this brew down a bit. Becomes increasingly thin as I drink.  Overall: I will echo the rest of the BA community when I say this is a world class IIPA. Wonderfully balanced with an assertive malt backbone that allows the hopping regiment shine through. This is also one of the few IPAs I have had that actually becomes more enjoyable throughout the drinking experience (and not just because of the 10% ABV). It is extremely drinkable for being 10%. I think the honey makes this beer even more enjoyable near the end of the glass. As the hop flavor dissipates the honey and floral tastes step up to the plate without coming off as cloying or overly sweet. First beer I've ever had from Bell's and I am very impressed.  I was able to try this beer on tap side by side with Pliny the Elder both on tap at Belmont Station last weekend which was not only highly enjoyable but also quite informative as to the differences between two world class IIPAs. This one seems to have a more assertive malt character that is enhanced by the honey possibly.

Does not get much fresher then that!!! A: Slightly hazed amber with a towering 3 finger snow white head that lingers long time...beautiful. S: Floral, piney, dank hops goodness, with a sweet undertone...very nice. T: Follows the nose with the hops, then a solid malt backbone balances it out right away. Light honey sweetness comes in at the end offering its assistance in the balancing act, & combined with the malt gives a valiant effort...but the hops win! M: Lingering hoppy goodness leaves things on the dry side, with a bit of the 10% ABV coming through. O: Bell's Two Hearted Ale is my all time favorite IPA, so I had high expectations for this well hyped offering, especially since I'm a big fan of braggots. Did it live up? Sort of...it's VERY good, don't get me wrong, but I wasn't as blown away as all the hype said I would be, especially considering the price & scarcity of it.

Not sure how they do it, very impressive. Some honey sweetness and hop bitterness that is melded together perfectly into a beer that is very craveable.  On the other hand, I would almost prefer it to be 5-6% than 10% ABV. If I'm going to drink something with that much alcohol, I don't want it to go down easy. I want it to have some intense, complex hops that I can sip slowly and appreciate.

Head recedes to thin film.  Smell is not overly aggressive but has good dose of grapefruit, orange, cereal, and yes, I pick up the honey.  First taste is pretty sweet up front coupled with some citrusy tartness and bitterness. Can really feel the balance of the cereal sweetness and piney, citrus flavors. Some of the honey flavor comes thru too and it adds to the sweetness. Some caramel too, but for so much sweetness, the orangey and grapefruit flavors are in tune with all of it. Zero alcohol detected.  Heavier side of medium bodied, a touch syrupy and mouth coating but only a slight bitter aftertaste. Carbonation is ample for the body.  I really wanted this beer about six years ago when first getting into craft beers but never scored and stopped actively searching it out. Finally able to get some now that it seems some of its luster has faded. But I can see why people like it so much.

287,17112,thebeers,4.09,"Clear golden bronze with three fingers of off-white head. Leaves heavy lacing.  Piney, resiny goodness in the aroma when first cracked open, followed by a honey graham sweetness that has a relatively dry, powdery finish. Just a kiss of alcohol behind.  The taste has some of that same dry sweetness up front with a touch of tropical fruit added to the mix. There's clear alcohol throughout, with a mellow piney hop bitterness on the backend that slowly sneaks up on you.  Medium bodied, somewhat chewy, with a fairly strong astringency from the alcohol.  There's a lot going on in this one. Maybe a bit overhyped, but still excellent.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",Imperial IPA,98
287,17112,DraconusDesanctus666,4.51,"Poured from a 12 oz can package date 01/14/17,into a Cigar City spiegelau IPA glass.  Thick,creamy,slightly off white colored head,that stands just under 2 fingers tall.Beautiful lacing that sticks to the side of the glass.Hazy dark gold in color,with an almost orange hue.Medium clarity.Medium carbonation  On the nose I get citrus fruit notes,mango and grapefruit,along with piney hops,and some earthy malts.Maybe it's just me but I think I am getting some caramel,probably from the malts.  On the palate I get mostly bitter piney hops up front,backed by some citrus and some sweet malts on the back end to balance it out.Also getting some spices and floral flavors in the middle.  The body is on the border of thin,and medium with a good dose of oxidation on the tongue.Dry finish with a slightly chalky mouth feel.  This is a very good IPA citrus and pine on the nose,bitter hops on the palate,nice mouth feel.Not much to complain about on this one.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",Imperial IPA,98
287,17112,Oopssorryy,4.33,"Pours a dark gold, nearly amber, with a thick creamy head. The head was quite large in size, but fell quickly to form a thin white cap, slightly thicker at the edges. lacing is everywhere with this one. Completely clear, with a small amount of carbonation rising to the top. As always I get tropical fruit with these DIPAs, but the addition of honey makes this a real treat. I get undertones of grass, it's floral, piney, and bitter to go along with the fruit.  I get very little of the fruit flavors the nose promised. Instead I get heaps of pine, fresh cut grass, resin. This is the first beer I can truly call dank. I get hints of grapefruit at the beginning, and then right at the tail end, along with the honey sweetness. Right in the middle of the beer, it reminds you that it's not something to ignore, with a huge alcohol bite to accent and strengthen the piney flavors.  The beer is not as dry as I'd heard, with the honey helping keep the beer very drinkable. It's still very bitter, with the honey only there to help cut down on the bite. It's ABV is also not hidden at all, and a long with the high amount of carbonation I felt in the mouth, this beer was very light and thin bodied, but never in flavor. While IPA still isn't one of my favorite styles, I am glad I was able to try this giant of the craft world. I would buy again.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",Imperial IPA,98

It smells of sweet malt, honey, peach, and pine. The taste is a wonderful blend of biscuit, sweet malt, bitter hops, honey, and sweet fruit. Rather than one taste at a time, it seems to all happen at once. It's absolutely delicious! This ale is medium-bodied with with a rather thick, creamy feel, with pleasant carbonation, and a punchy 10% ABV that gives it substance. Overall, this is superb DIPA, equally appropriate for casual drinking or paired with a good meal.

A few years ago The Slam was special, but now with the proliferation of DIPA's it's just OK. It's extremely balanced and crushable for 10% ABV, but it's not what it's used to be for my tainted buds.

Honey is noticeable as you pour, then some flowery hops with a hint of citrus. Fairly sweet upfront, the honey seems to stay with this. Surprisingly creamy and smooth. I guess I was expecting more of a hop bomb here, but this proved to be a very smooth beer. It's boozy, but easy to to drink. This is one of those beers where I kick up the ratings as I drank it.

From its hazy yellow-orange glow and creamy head to its honeyed hop flavor, nothing is overpowering and the flavors just meld together perfectly. Its sweetness from the honey perfectly balances the hops that hit you in the face. I'm not a big fan of hops for the sake of hops, but this brew just sings in harmony with all of the other flavors.  The only downside is that it is seasonal and must be had fresh. Other than that, get it if you can and savor it.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",Imperial IPA,98

The price is huge on these. Almost twice as much as Bigfoot, can't solve that riddle. A lot of grapefruit to the hop mouthfeel, its relatively light compared to its actual size.

Within 20 seconds, the foam head becomes rocky and poruous. At 3 minutes, the head has refused to shrink completely, only dwindling down to two fingers. Honey orange in color with a high amount of cloudiness. There is a plethora of small and medium-sized bubbles ascending to the top to support the undying head. Lacing is high in quantity and thick with a few areas being very thick. SMELL: Strong aromas of white bread, mangos, peaches, apricots, and papayas elegantly entangle with mild honey and caramel aromas along with subtle aromas of earthy and piney hops. Hints of alcohol are also present. TASTE: Mild white bread, honey, and caramel flavors first enter onto the palate. I'm incredibly surprised that the initial flavors aren't stronger as the smell would have told me. Mild flavors of mango, peach, papaya, and apricot and subtle bitter hops flavors immediately trail the initial flavors as honey grows slightly stronger. Mild piney hop and subtle earthy hop flavors close out the flavors as all previous ones push on. FEEL: Full-bodied and subtly carbonated. Goes down smooth and creamy.

Smells is slightly dank, hoppy, hint of honey.  Tastes good, not great. The hoppy bitterness is there, but the honey gives it character, but not as enjoyable as it used to be.  Mouth feel is medium bodied and slightly bitter.  Overall it's a good DIPA. It gets a lot of grief as hypeslam but some of it is rightly given. It's easier to find now, and the beer isn't as good as it was 3-4 years ago. Not sure what they changed. I do like the canned version better than the bottle. This brew is way better on draft.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",Imperial IPA,98

287,17112,Joe_Palooka,4.94,"2017 update>>>>>>Well, I have gone through nearly 200 cans of this fine beer this year and I do consider myself an expert on Bells Hopslam. Great beer, always has been. Keep it real Bells because your Hopslam junkies are loyal! Still have a dozen or so but they've taken a back burner to ""Mars"" the latest Bells offering. i have managed to find about 4 cases of this fine beer and I look forward to Bells next!  Everyone knows how this beer looks, smells, tastes, feels, etc. I find the most amazing thing about this beer is it's balance. I have waited until I finished my 15th six pack of this years release to make my opinions know. Yes. I am a beer snob and hoarder. I enjoy following a nice double imperial stout with a Hopslam. 10% ABV.....?? You would never know it it goes down so smooth. My only wish is that Bells would make this a year round beer to take away the hype of trying to find it every January and February.  2018 update: Another 200 plus cans this year and this was another great Hopslam year and we are just about a month away from 2019 release.

Amazing tropical and citrus fruit hop aromas. Passion fruit, grapefruit, orange, mango, and a hint of key lime. Smells juicy. Phenomenal. T: Follows the aroma with that wonderful amalgamation of hop notes--mango, passion fruit, orange, grapefruit, and key lime. Dry cracker malt in the background. With warming, the honey note emerges. M: Juicy tropical sweetness. Medium body (the ABV is extremely well hidden). Moderately dry and bitter throughout. Lingers and matures nicely on the palate too.

Aroma: First off, I certainly get a hit of some of that honey its brewed with. Then I get a remarkable mixture of semi sweet bready malts mixed with an array of citrusy hop smells. HONEY BREAD? People claim this thing explodes with grapefruit action but I get more orange soda scents and like a tangerine or sweet sweet cutie type thing. Taste: It's pretty good. Not mind blowingly tasty but it's quite tasty and drinkable for a ten percenter. you get just a tad of the alcohol heat. I mean there is some malt but its brewed in a way that makes that overly malty and alcohol sweetness from ruining the beer or creating off notes. I dont get much pine, i dont get much dank, i dont get crazy grassy or green matter type action that many west coast IPAs have. I guess its balanced and delicate. Mouthfeel: medium ish? carbonation is lively enough to keep it interesting throughout. semi oily and not so resinous at all.  Overall: I wish i couldve had a fresher can.

Poured into a Duvel tulip glass.  Appearance: It poured a hazy copper orange colour with an one finger off white head that sticks around for a bit and leaves nice spotty lacing.  Aroma: Crisp candied orange and caramel with some light tropical pineapple, apricot and pine.  Taste: Its quite a sweet DIPA but that should have been expected with ale brewed with honey. I get a quick hit of bitterness to start before it turns sweet with caramel, honey, pineapple and orange. The finish is bitter again with grapefruit mixed in with some honey.  Mouthfeel: Mid to full bodied with light carbonation.  Overall: This was nice, but maybe my expectations were too high and it was perhaps just a bit too sweet for me.

287,17112,scaryjarbro,4.82,"I've been a California red wine guy for the last 8 years, and have started getting into beer again after 20+ years over the last 2 years or so. Fittingly, I've trended towards Imperial Stouts and everything bourbon-barrel aged. Significant amount of hops has been a bit too extreme for my palate. I've trended towards more & more hops lately, and the most forward-jumping progress has been what I tasted in Hopslam, which is appropriately named. I was struck by the balance of the beer, which despite it's overwhelming hops punch allowed me to at no point being overcome by the bitterness.  This is as close to perfect an Imperial IPA as I've had and ranks as one of my top 10 beers of any variety. It's also single-handedly opened up my palate to greater hops in other ales. Spectacular beer, and I'm at a 99 rating for it. Kudos to Bells for this genius product!",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",Imperial IPA,98

S: malty, vague citrus and resin, pine and honey. Really it smells like it tastes, a very sweet hoppy beer. This was an old can. I'll need to get my hands on a fresh one next year, and re-review.  T: very sweet arrival, malty mid palate with loads of pine and citrus, then here come the hops rounding out the back end, with a solid and lingering bitterness. Quite boozy, though alcohol is detectable, it never overpowers or becomes unpleasant.  M: thick, syrupy, slick, quite modest carbonation.  O: glad I tried it, I like it; if readily available, might make it a regular DIPA.

287,17112,OmahaKF,4.21,"Smell is orange citrus, pine, and honey. Taste mimics the smell fairly closely - citrus, pine, orange blossom, nice malt backbone, and the sweetness from the honey cuts the hop bitterness well.

Smell was a nice bouquet of tropical fruits, floral notes and pine with undertones of perhaps mango? Very fragrant, just a bit hard to discern individual aromas.  Taste followed the nose with a nice array of tropical fruits initially before giving way to a piney, sappy bitterness on the finish. Prominent malt backbone to this beer provided flavors of caramel malts with a slight honey sweetness. Personally this is a one or two and done kind of DIPA for me. Lots of hop character really taxed my palate pretty quick. Not a knock on this beer, just not one I can drink a lot of.  Feel was nice, bit of thickness from the honey and malts, but not overly so.

S: Definitely on the richer, maltier side for the style. Some delicate floral hops, caramel malt and a mild metallic character. Also a nice resinous citrus hop character. Overall the aroma seems a bit muted.  T: Sweet and a bit boozy, with lots of floral and piney hops. Lots of caramel, grapefruit rind, wood sap, a bit of that honey and some of the metallic taste that often comes with it. Despite the sweetness, it’s a pretty clean flavor profile with a bitter, semi-sweet, moderately boozy finish. Definitely a malt-driven DIPA.  F: Medium-full and chewy, with medium carbonation, a bit of alcoholic warmth and a slick, resinous mouthfeel.  Thoughts: This is a big DIPA – not the most drinkable for the style but there’s plenty of flavor. It’s a classic though I can’t say it’s ever been my favorite.

287,17112,curtisjoseph,3.34,"16 oz draft poured into a Budweiser pint glass of all things.  This is the first review I've written and unfortunately it's not going to be a favorable one. I saw this beer briefly in stock but ended up opting not getting it and regretted it since. Local bar ended up having it on draft, it was expensive but I decide what the hell since I had heard good things about Bells annual release and thought I had missed out. Not sure if it's just this year, but this is what I was served:  Appearance: Beautiful golden, opaque glass of beer with an almost peache colored head that remained about a millimeter thick.  Smell: Very fruity, pleasant aroma. No real sense of the alcohol from the smell, fairly mild with hints of peach and mango.  Taste: Alcohol. Alcohol. Alcohol. A quick bit of sweetness as the syrup hits and then you get the sensation that you just downed a shot of liqour. Not what I was expecting at all. Finishes off with some bitterness from the hops but doesn't even approach IPA let alone DIPA like this is supposedly styled as. I can't get a feel for what this beer is going for, let alone what style this should be. If I had to guess this should be more of a strong ale than anything else. Syrup, alcohol, tinge of bitterness.  Feel: Full bodied beer, mild carbonation, overall goes down extremely well.  Overall: They definitely tried to make something different here, but it is honestly one of my less favorite things that i've tried. Would be interested in comparing this to a previous release to see if this is a new direction or if this is what Hopslam is supposed to be. Try it if you can find it for a decent price, would highly advise against spending $8 on it at a bar.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",Imperial IPA,98

It smells good, but was so alcohol forward could barely taste the hops. I prefer the APA and milder IPAs where you can actually taste hops and not get overwhelmed with the booze flavor. Doesn't taste like beer; would rather drink vodka. Glad I was able to buy as a single can, was only able to finish 1/4th of it.

287,17112,Alex_Hams,2.89,"2016 vintage poured into a Sam Adams perfect pint glass.  Ooooohhh boy. This one's a bit of a mess. A big, sweet, syrupy mess.  The best part of this beer is the appearance. It pours golden orange with a heathy head that is retained for a while and which leaves a bunch of lacing in my glass.  Things start going wrong in the nose. It's sickly sweet. Like simple syrup or honey with a hint of hop bitterness.  The initial flavors are bracingly bitter (which is nice) but that's quickly followed up with honey sweetness. The problem with this one is the ABV. To achieve this ABV you have to use so much honey or malt and that detracts from the hops in my opinion. Also, at 10% it's hard to enjoy this one. It's boozy and hot. Goes straight to your head. I don't mind a RIS or Barleywine weighing in at 10%+ ABV because I can cellar them for a bit to mellow. This beer is meant to be drank fresh and at 10% that's a bit rough.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",Imperial IPA,98

Smell is peach, mango, papaya, pine, and grapefruit.  Taste follows, loads of tropical fruits, with pine and grapefruit taking over in the surprisingly balanced finish.  Mouthfeel is on the larger side, moderate carbonation which is perfect, on the lush side, and 10% never went down easier!

Appearance is a clear light gold, lacing is about perfect.  Smell is nicely florally hoppy, not overbearing. A little barley, too. A lil alky-hall.  Taste is really mellow at first, followed by a little bitterness and a little sweetness. When I'm looking for balance, this is what I want: complexity without dominance. (Okay, stating the obvious there.) It's more pine than citrus, but there's also a bit of savoriness that I didn't even know was possible with a hop bomb.  It's so smooth, I could chug it. At the non-Michigan price, I'll just have to gradually enjoy. There was some noticeable alcohol on the nose, but I suppose that dissipates once it's out of the bottle (or can).  I guess I'm going to keep an eye out for it this time next year.

Sweet caramel malts, honey, candied citrus, spicy pine, apricot and faint tropical notes. Good mouth feel on this one; an initial spritz of carbonation makes the beer feel light but it transitions towards a chewier consistency. A nice sweet citrusy flavor throughout with a nice lingering aftertaste. Not overly sweet and doesn't feel bitter at all. On the taste I get a lot of honey comb, grapefruit, canned clementines, caramel, pine, a sweet maltiness, and spicy herbal hops. Never really understood the hype for this one.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",Imperial IPA,98

T: Big hit of pine and resin, like chewing pine needles, some grapefruit peel, hit of bitterness, finish is more grapefruit peel balanced with malts, touch of honey balances out the beer, very tasty.  M: Medium bodied, low carbonation, semi-dry finish.  O: This is very good, lots of hop notes, good amount of malts, and a touch of honey to add some sweetness.

A puffy, cream colored head forms and settles, leaving behind some solid rings of lacing with each sip.  S — Smell is dominated by some nice honey notes, a bit of floral lavender, resinous, piney, chewy, lemon, candied ginger, some caramely sweet notes and some lightly toasted bready notes, quite sweet and subdued.  T — Candied hops, ginger, lemon, orange peel, grapefruit, blood orange, melon, citrus rind and pith, bitter pine needles and earth, some honeyed sweetness.  M — Slightly warming and rich, a really smooth and clean finish, slightly lingering and chewy, very nice.  O — Excellent overall, like gnawing on a candied hop flower.

287,17112,McStagger,4.41,"Cans! Also first time.  Stamped on the bottom PKG 12716. Dating machine is misguided, as the relevant info is stamped halfway through the bottom lip of the can.  A: Aggressive pour gives two finger dark khaki head. Not quite to creamy up top, with large bubbles forming the side. Beer itself is a golden orange. Translucent, with a ton of very tiny particulent floating in suspension. Carbonation is subdued, with the odd bubble floating to the surface every few seconds. Retention is pretty minimal. Head collapses in the course of 30-45 seconds.  S: Smells like a bruiser. Big malts from the glass. Sweet malted barley, heather honey, honey (duh). Hops lend towards the more west coast style. Some pine, some grapefruit. Stone fruits are more pronounced. Pears, apples, some peachiness.  T: First word that comes to mind is balance. While obviously hoppy, there is more than enough malt here to compensate. Shot of sweetness from the honey up front, immediately cut by stone fruit skin. Think the bitterness of pear or apple rind. Malt wins out towards the mid palate, but a sharp tropical spiciness takes over before the sugars completely run away with it. These two flavor sets intermingle towards the finish, where the malt eventually wins out with a pleasantly, but not overly, sweet finish. The fruity hoppiness encores in the aftertaste, with the same spicy tropical and peach notes being the final flavors of each sip.  For several sips I agitated it on my tongue for a few seconds before taking the drink. Starts off sweet, but this fades into a distinct fruity bitterness each time. Further agitation made the bitterness more pronounced, taking on a borderline green tannin type flavor. This agitation also opened up the 10% ABV, leaving a noticeable warmth on the back of the tongue and nasal cavities. The IBU's must be pretty high, since the bitterness really sticks around after all is said and done.  M: Feels a bit shy of its 10%, but still a big beer. The sweetness of the honey helps to accentuate the roundness in the mouthfeel, which has subdued carbonation. The ""weight"" of the beer can really be felt if one chews it. It effectively sticks to one's palate and teeth. God knows how many carbohydrates are in a single can. The astringent hop presence in the end dries the beer out substantially in the finish, with the alcohol only becoming really noticeable if one continues to swirl in the mouth.  O: This is exceptional. I bought it because it's new to my region, but I was skeptical due to its reputation as being old hack as far as DIPA's are concerned. I was also concerned because many had stated that several vintages were subpar. I'm glad I picked this up. At $20 a sixer, it's very well priced. Many would balk at the tag, but it equates to less than 8 bucks a bomber. That's more than fair for a beer of this quality. I'm very happy to have picked it up. Top notch stuff. It's a classic for a reason.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",Imperial IPA,98

Clear copper body with a thin white head. Great retention.  Not a huge DIPA aroma...but I actually found this intriguing. I knew this beer was under 4 weeks old...and not a west coast beer...so I actually kind of liked the midwest scent. Smelled fresh and hoppy without going overboard.  Big beer in every way, with an incredible balance. This is why the beer is so sought after. You can taste some of the booze, but there's a very good balance of hops and honey sweetness. I actually think the mouthfeel is nearly perfect as i found myself gulping bigger sips  I gotta say, it's a wonderful beer.

Here's what I thought. It pours a clear golden color with a nice medium sized bubbly head which dissipates into a thin lace that retains well. As I put my nose to the glass, I was hit by sweetness. It smelled like cake and honey. Later, I noticed the abundance of tropical fruit. As with the aroma, the taste is quite sweet. This is one big juicy DIPA; like alcohol soaked citrus and tropical fruit. I felt like I was drinking some kind of hoppy tropical island punch. One also tastes the honey and malts. The hops are there and provide an aggressive kick in the mouth that is especially felt in the puckering finish. This one was medium to almost full and chewy.

It's smooth bitterness; strong but not at all harsh. Another sip presents bread and citrus notes. As it warms, a little alcohol heat joins the party.  This is a big, rich beer. Classical hops and classical malts balance well in a strong brew. Is it hype or substance? Depends on what you are looking for.

287,17112,dd43,4.29,"Hopslam is somewhat of a unique animal. Honey isn't typically part of the mash for an imperial IPA, but it seems to work here. The honey does more than lend a large amount of easily fermentable sugar, the flavor and aroma of clover honey comes through when drinking it. Head was pretty substantial upon the pour, a mix of medium and small sized bubbles, bright white, topping an amber colored and lightly hazy liquid beneath.  This is a beer that features malt and hops in equal measure. The name is somewhat deceiving, as while the hops are definitely big and in your grill, the malts are just as pronounced. I got some pretty ripe melon, almost a fermented melon smell, along with pine needle and citrus oils in the nose. There's a flowery bouquet as well but I can't pin it down more than that. Flavor brings in the honey, and a pretty deeply resinous malt punch. Hop bitterness is assertive enough to keep the malts in check and reward each sip with a pleasant finish on the sides of my tongue.  There is booze to be found in the aroma, I get the essence of it when exhaling after a swallow. Mouthfeel is on the sticky side, not a sugar bomb but certainly not what I'd call a dry or crisp finish. I actually wouldn't mind if that part of this beer was lightened up somewhat, but then I suppose it wouldn't be Hopslam anymore.  Great beer, worth trying to anyone that has never had it. That said I don't think if it was harder to get that I'd really go nuts trying to find it. One or two six packs a season seems plenty to me.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",Imperial IPA,98
287,17112,Umdrunner,4.23,"Poured hazy light orange with one finger white head that had good retention and lacing. Scent was subtle pine, citrus with sweetness. Flavor was a pine, grapefruit, with noticeable sweet malty character with lingering boozy after taste that didn't overpower. Good, not worth chasing trucks for though.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",Imperial IPA,98
287,17112,Lingenbrau,4.17,"HopSlam pours a lovely light shade of amber. It's pretty clear with a smooth and tightly knit yet large foamy head resting on top. It has excellent retention and lacing.  The aroma is surprisingly old school DIPA. Grapefruit and pine, with splashes of caramel and even some alcohol, yet that comes as no surprise. Honey? Maybe, but in more of a crushed candy form more so.  Wow, is this sweet. Definitely getting the honey now. Overall, this tastes very malty and the alcohol is again pretty apparent. There is added sweetness with melon and dark berry flavors going on as well.  For a 10%er, it's smoother than expected. Though crisp, it does have a long lasting syrupy sweetness before an alcohol warmth takes on the final blow.  This is a good 'DIPA', and I'm sure in it's Hey Day, there was nothing quite like it. I find it to be a little too sweet, too rich, and too much alcohol presence to enjoy multiples of. This is only my third year with this classic, so I have an unfortunate unbiased opinion. Cheers!",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",Imperial IPA,98
287,17112,FriedSlug,4.38,Clear orange with a white head and spotty lacing. Smells sweet and dank with the faint scent of honey. The taste is malty sweet with honey and really nice bitter hops. Really nice beer.,Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",Imperial IPA,98
287,17112,HorseheadsHophead,4.47,"Look: Semi-hazy amber-orange with a few bubbles a tight white creamy head that leaves sheets of lacing.  Smell: Lots of pulpy yellow grapefruit and orange, grassy and floral; also pretty dank and resinous with some faint sweetness. Perhaps a touch of tropical notes; pineapple, papaya, passionfruit.  Taste: Loads of yellow grapefruit, orange, and a bit of lemon up front, dankness and pine resin. Incredibly smooth, balanced, and drinkable. A firm yet subtle malt backbone of caramel, toast, and honey. Lights notes of pineapple and papaya. Finishes dank and grassy, but only faintly bitter.  Feel: Slick, smooth, and creamy. Just enough carbonation to roll it nicely over the palate, but feels slick in the mouth like cream.  Overall: Another whale that did not disappoint. A top notch double/triple IPA worth seeking out, and a pleasure to drink.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",Imperial IPA,98
287,17112,Kurt_Dog,3.68,"Fairly good double ipa. Big malt backbone. Bitter, gritty finish (you can feel the amount of hops on your teeth). This IPA tastes dated (I had a fresh glass on tap). It isn't very fruity, tropical or dank. I guess this is east coast vs. west coast. I would have to say that east coast / midwest, at least Michigan is falling majorly behind west coast IPA's, esp. California. I can think of a dozen better IPAs in California off the top of my head.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",Imperial IPA,98

287,17112,jimdalton,4.67,"Appearance: Crystal clear golden orange that pours a two finger pearl colored head. Very nice lacing down the glass. Smell: Earthy, floral hop with some bready-malt undertones. Taste: Perfect balance between bitterness and sweet that really allows the hops to flourish. Citrus (grapefruit, orange) and earthy, floral hops with some very nice sweetness towards the back end of the taste. Honey notes are present, but not overly dominant. Very smooth finish. Feel: Medium body with less than sudsy carbonation. Overall: A spectacular double IPA worthy of high marks. Not for those new to the style or perhaps craft beer in general, but it is a fantastically complex and enjoyable beer. Highly recommended.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",Imperial IPA,98

AROMA: Some citrus, pine, and grass as it warms. Honey? Ok, there is a sweetness there that I can imagine to be honey like. The beer does have a nice aroma, malty & hoppy citrus mostly, it smells like it's going to be a balanced beer. TASTE: Big malt sweetness. Nice hoppy citrus and pine notes, and pleasant, mild bitterness. A little alcohol as it warms. FEEL: Full body. Average carbonation. A bit sticky, dries on the finish. Just the slightest bit of astringency to the beer, but very mild. OVERALL: A really pleasant DIPA. It is very balanced though, between malt and hops. Don't know if I would have called this HopSLAM...

287,17112,Davey-C,3.12,"Sampled on 2/11/16 from can dated on box ""1/8/16"" from pint glass. Aroma: initial aroma dominated by pine hops and hop resin. Aroma develops to reveal moderate malt sweetness (Carmel) and bubble-gum fruity (pineapple, pear, tropical fruit) hop aromas. Appearance: moderately clear with light cloudiness. Copper color. Good head retention with 3/4"" just off-white head that persists for 5+ minutes leaving film that persists. Heavy lacing. Flavor: moderate malt sweetness combined with high levels of hop flavor - clashing. Balance is hop forward. Yeast characteristics of ""clean"" American ale strain. Finish is moderately sweet and persists. Hop flavors of pine and sweet fruit (bubble gum, pineapple, tropical fruit, stone cherries). High hop bitterness. Mouthfeel: medium-heavy body. Medium carbonation. Very slight alcohol warmth. Moderately creamy - coating mouth. No astringency or acidity. Overall: high levels of malt and hops and alcohol muddle flavors. Consider lowering dextrinious malts, mash at lower temp to reduce sweetness in finish and allow hops to be expressed. A fair attempt at a difficult style that has fierce competition. Cloying sweetness and lack of standout hop aroma and flavor don't make me a fan. This beer seems to have quite the following, perhaps I got a bad can?",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",Imperial IPA,98

287,17112,CNoj012,3.89,"This beer pours a hazy golden copper color with a huge, pillowy off white head. The retention is amazing and there is tons of spotted lacing. Smell is subtle yet complex. Orange and grapefruit along with floral and a slight bit of pine in the hop department and some sweet and caramel malts. The taste is similar, but one person's balanced is another person's muddled, and to me this seems a bit more of the latter. Also a bit on the sweet side. Feel is medium to full and really coats your whole mouth. Overall a nice beer, but I'm a little let down. The hops really seem like they would be the star of the show from the aroma, but instead of the malt just kind of cutting out the bitterness, they really kind of weigh down the hop flavors.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",Imperial IPA,98

Mostly hop aroma, but can sense the heavy malt backbone that carries the hoppy bitterness and piney floral notes.  Taste: Malt flavor first, then I get that beautiful piney hop flavor that dominates the nose. Then a slight bitterness and a hint of boozy flavor near the very end.  Mouthfeel: Fairly light bodied for a double IPA. Still a bit of swirl in the glass.  Overall: A delightful double IPA.

Smell is of fresh hops, but not overwhelmingly so. Flavor is less hoppy than the smell, due to the combination of sweetness from the honey and the slight tinge of warmth from the higher abv.

287,17112,jm1229,4.69,"Been looking for this bad boy ever since I joined onto BA. But being that I live on the West Coast, it's almost been more of a myth than an actual beer. Now that Bell's has expanded West, it's time to give it a try. Will it live up to the hype or will it pale in comparison to other amazing west coast hop bombs?  Poured from a can into a Samuel Smith imperial pint glass. The head was pillowy and fluffy (like I've seen with other East coast IPAs) and sticks to the glass on the way down. My poor pour made the head stick up above the glass like a soufflé (which looked nicer than I deserved for the pour). Nice cloudy golden color.  Smells like pineapple, pine, citrus fruits. Big aroma. Off to a good start.  The taste is amazing. I'll be the first to say I'm not a huge fan of east coast IPAs as I find them too malty or sweet, but this tastes like you're biting into a fruit. It just burst citrus flavors that match the nose. But the beer really shines in its mouthfeel. It's robust and full, yet once you drink it down, it doesn't linger and assault your tastebuds like a more aggressive IPA. You want to go back for more. Really drinkable.  Overall, oh man. What a delicious beer. Full bodied, yet crisp and drinkable. I can see why it has the hype it does. It's a double IPA, yes, but it doesn't feel like it's competing with the likes of a Pliny or Alpine IPA because it's a blatant east coast, sweet IPA.

Smell: Hopslam smells like... a DIPA with hints of fruit (grapefruit and citrus). Taste: Hopslam hits you with a nice kick upfront, with heavy hints of honey and alcohol that goes down smooth and satisfying. Took a few drinks to get used to, but now I truly appreciate the amazing flavor. Strong and hoppy without being too bitter. Feel: The mouthful is not too light, nor heavy - just right (medium). It goes down satisfyingly easy. Overall: I'm not used to DIPAs of this calibur. Hopslam definitely hits you up front with its bite and honey alcohol kick, but is able to maintain an easy-drinking beer that brings warmth to the heart and soul.

There is some grapefruit and pine there, but the honey really dominates and seems to overpower the hop flavor. Not much bitterness present. The alcohol isn't burning but you differently notice it. F: Medium mouth feel. The good carbonation makes it an easy drinking beer. Overall: This is a DIPA which is just two sweet and alcoholic for me.

I enjoy the easy drinkability, the flavor profile, and the hop characteristic of the style. This beer is far and away one of the top doubles I have ever tasted. The look is a dark amber color and the smell is citrus and pine. The taste... so this is where I have to pipe up. Some people hate the sweetness that the honey entails. I love it. It cancels out the bitterness that the hops bring but doesn't stop from the citrus profile that the hops in this double are known for. Again, I love it. It is not the double IPA that some might think it is. It is not hop forward like most in this style, but it adds another layer that most don't have. It is one of my favorites. The price point is a bit high but for a once a year release, I can't stop picking up a couple six packs. This is one fantastic beer.

Smell is equal parts sweet and dank, with heavy tropical fruit, pine, citrus, honey and clover. First read off the tongue is sweet honey and burnt sugar, with bittersweet grapefruit and pine following, huge biscuity malt and toffee rounding and balancing things out. The flavors come in waves and then abruptly end with just a moderate, pithy bitterness in the aftertaste. Wonderful. Feel is silky and medium-bodied, syrupy and coating. Very nice. Really awesome beer that's worthy of the hype and very memorable in a crowded category.

287,17112,ThisWangsChung,3.59,"Pours a beautiful amber color. The head is three fingers high and slightly off-white in shade. While not the densest texture-wise, retention is pretty good. TONS of lacing sticks to the glass, literally tons.  Wow. Smell those Simcoe hops. Needless to say, they pop aromatically with a ton of piny notes, alongside some grassiness. There's a slight spiciness to the hop qualities as well - no real citrus presence, though. Naturally, the caramel and toffee appears vividly, as does some honey sweetness. Clearly, it's not the biggest or baddest-smelling IPA on the market, but it certainly charming taking its own merits into consideration.  It opens up with some piny hops flavor-wise. Throughout the flavor profile, piny, spicy hops seem to dot the palate. Around the middle, a large amount of caramel malt sweetness makes itself known. The flavors end with some honey, apricot, and orange peel. I have to say that this doesn't offer the most interesting collection of notes for a big DIPA (especially one as hyped as this); however, it's compensated by its balanced and easygoing nature.  This is a sweet-tasting beer, but not that sweet-feeling. This is why I like honey as an adjunct - it offers a bold flavor presence while creating a dry finish. And here, it definitely seems to save this from having a syrupy, sluggish palate feel. Carbonation is fairly gentle, given its thick texture.  HYPESLAM HURR HURR~ No, it doesn't have the newest or sexiest hops, but it's a 10% monster that drinks like it's 7%. Seriously, though, the hype for this beer is kind of crazy. It's just a good, highly drinkable DIPA - that's it. Quite a few DIPAs from the DMV region are superior to this, but it's still worthy.

The aroma has medium ripe mango, pineapple, and sticky, resiny pine backed up by a seemingly strong malt backbone with low caramel notes. It doesn't exactly leap out of the glass but definitely smells nice.  The flavor leads with fleeting fruity hops that quickly fade and become replaced with a medium-strong bitterness that lingers. The malt makes its presence known but mostly stays out of the way. Unfortunately the hops don't really pop for me... they're there then they're not. It's a bit of a muddled hop flavor, which could be a result of what the brewery calls ""the most complex hopping schedule in the Bell's repertoire."" I tend to favor two or three character hops personally so it could just be my bias but I remember this being more hop forward in the past.  The mouthfeel is full with a medium dry finish that is enhanced by the lingering bitterness. A hint of alcohol is detectable but never overpowering. The beer lays a bit heavy on the palate and is filling over the course of a serving; pair that with the double digit alcohol and this isn't exactly a beer to have several of during a drinking session. Overall Hopslam is still a good Imperial IPA but the recipe is showing its age. It hearkens back to an era of bigger, sweeter hop monsters or what I used to refer to as Midwest DIPAs (bigger body, lower bitterness than West Coast DIPAs). For me this was a nice throwback but I'm not exactly chomping at the bit to get to the other five cans.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",Imperial IPA,98
287,17112,Soneast,4.41,"Been drinking this since 2006, always one of my favorites. I, for one, feel that it has been fairly consistent year after year, and it surely never lets me down. Lots of new beer drinkers think it is all hype, but other than in a few new beer drinking circles, and a buncha threads on BA around January, this beer really doesn't get that much hype. Sure it sells out quickly in some areas, but that's just because people like it.  Pours a slightly hazy, golden-orange color with a 2 finger thick, white colored head that has some great retention, condensing to a thick, 1/4"" creamy layer atop the beer, leaving a ton of lace.  Aroma is predominately made up of floral grapefruit as well as other citrus aromas. Quite pungent and fruity, with just a hint of honey-like aromatics.  The taste is a bit more prominent pine-like flavor than citrus, though a nice grapefruit flavor is evident. Just an amazing balance of flavors, the honey lends it a fairly dry finish, leaving a mildly bitter flavor on the palate. *Note honey ferments out completely (ie there is NO honey sugars left in the beer after fermentation). It leaves no residual sweetness, so n00bs commenting on a honey sweetness are just plain wrong. The beer is dry, with maybe a bit more malt sweetness than the average West Coast IPA, but by no means is there any HONEY SWEETNESS!  Medium in body heavy in ABV, Hopslam is a very drinkable beer, almost TOO drinkable. I was surprised that I couldn't detect any alcohol on the nose or tongue considering the 10% ABV. Absolutely look forward to this beer every year...and honestly, it's gotta be one of my favorite beers, period!",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",Imperial IPA,98

S: Citrus & honey  T: There is a lot of citrus flavor in this beer, but what strikes me the most is the bite. I am not sure if brewing with honey gives it this or the high alcohol content. I have had many other Imperial and double IPAs that do not exhibit this characteristic. Definitely my favorite offering from Bell's although Two-Hearted Ale will always hold a special place in my gut.  M: Incredibly easy to drink for such a strong IPA. Feels great in the mouth and the bite from this beer is like no other ive had.  O: This is my favorite IPA. I drink about 80% IPAs so I have had many.

A huge amalgamation of tropical notes, from nectarine to mango to orange to pineapple to passionfruit. Highly elusive and hard to pin down, but the magic of this beer is in the sweetness that immediately follows. Fairly clean, bready, slightly caramelly and a wonderful smearing of honey. This creates a soft, decadent backbone for the explosion of hops, with a bitterness that only comes later in the palate, and is just enough bite. Finish is fruity and just a bit bitter.  M - Medium-full body, smooth and creamy.  O - Over-hyped beers and IPA's are huge turn-offs for me, but even going in with negative preconceptions this absolutely blew me away.

Aromas and flavors of pine and citrus are balanced perfectly by a solid malt presence, which is subtly caramelly and sweet. Good mouthfeel for the style, not too thin. Pleasantly bitter, no alcohol bite despite the high ABV, clean finish without any lingering sweetness. Insanely delicious and drinkable.

287,17112,BladesOfBarley,4.67,"Well, I'm back after another hiatus, and boy I have to say, its great to be back! Tonight, I am drinking Hopslam, by Bells Brewery (a favorite). And I have to say, this beer truly does live up to its reputation. A wonderfully balanced Imperial IPA, I would recommend this brew to anyone interested in the style. Pouring a beautiful, hazy, and golden with a slight orange tinge, this beer comes out with a solid head that never really dissipates, lacing is medium and just right. On first sip, a heavy aroma of alcohol shines through, only to be subdued by loads of citrus, resin, and malty goodness, citrus becoming more dominant as the beer warms. The real star here is the total balance of the flavor profile, deliciously hoppy and sweet, with notes of honey, pineapple, grapefruit and rich resin, with a sturdy malt background to carry it all forward.  Overall, this beer really does get better as it warms (and its delicious to begin with!, and what I would consider a solid intro to Imperial IPA's. Not to bitter and just citrusy and rich enough for the beginning drinker, and a wonderful sipper for the experienced.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",Imperial IPA,98

287,17112,BillBabbitt,4.5,"Before I had tried this beer, I suspected it was over rated. It pours with a nice head, but as an unfiltered beer it is hazing in the glass. The aroma is good, but unexceptional. So far, not impressed. But the taste, the mouth feel and finish really bring it home. An excellent beer that does not feel like 10% ABV, and in my opinion deserves the accolades.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",Imperial IPA,98
287,17112,TheKlevin,3.47,"I've never understood the hype, it's an okay Double IPA, but the honey ruins it for me. It adds an almost unnatural sweetness and really turns me off from the beer.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",Imperial IPA,98
287,17112,Sabtos,3.36,"Re-rating as my outlook on this has changed over the years.  The appearance of this beer to me is the most impressive aspect of it. A cloudy yellow to orange top to bottom, it's like a hazy tequila sunrise. A sturdy white, impressive and persistent amount of head too.  There is a slight hint of pineapple on the nose, then some dog breath, which I think is more accurately the honey with some wheat toast. There is also spiced tangerine, butterscotch and hot pine, and as it warms, straw and oatmeal come forward.  There is no dog breath in the flavor, but pretty bitter and spicy hops do take over, the straw and oatmeal notes smooth it out a bit. I think it's best to let this chill in the fridge for a month or so, as it sweetens out with the honey, develops some melon, and still keeps that tangerine. I also get the butterscotch and hot pine in flavor, or is that booze?  In the past when I had this, I sort of wanted to just spit it out and rub cold lunchmeat on my tongue. These days, a heavy use of hops has become more tolerable to me in certain respects, but this is still a bit overboard. I still think these kinds of beers are on the extreme and a little more balance is my preferred approach. However the honey does provide a hefty hit of sweetness to try to tamp it down.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",Imperial IPA,98
287,17112,Cfred371,3.19,"First time drinker of Hopslam, and came into this one looking forward to a well regarded double. This can was packaged 1/19/2016, so 13 days old and pretty fresh. I let the can sit out for 30 or so minutes to serve around 45-50 degrees. Drank from a tulip glass.  Look: The beer pours a nice golden color, producing a nice inch or so slightly off white head. The beer isn't crystal clear, but light does penetrate through, and is by no means hazy. The carbonation on Hopslam seems to be solid.  Smell: I thought the smell was pretty average: hop dominant with some citrus shining through, and a little bit of sweetness from the malt/honey. There is some earthy/dank aromas in here as well. The smell of Hopslam didn't differentiate itself much, to me, from any other double I've encountered, and was rather disappointing  Taste: The taste is initially the hops making a statement with some slight citrus, the dank flavors, and then the honey and malt start to take over around the middle, balancing the hops quite nicely. I note a little bit of the alcohol, but at 10%, that is expected.  Feel: I was pleased with how full the mouth feel on this beer is, carbonation assisting in a nice smooth, thick beer. Hopslam certainly has some bitterness in the finish, but is balanced with some sweetness at the beginning of the finish.  Overall: This is an OK beer, if not overly sweet. I wouldn't suggest seeking it out.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",Imperial IPA,98
287,17112,PBIU,3.82,"Very fond of this beer as it was the first Double IPA I tried back in the day. But with some others on this site I think that it could use a little tweaking. Why? Because my palate has shifted and so has the market.  Look is wonderful a honey orange color with lively carb.  Smell is tangerine, passion fruit and honey malt.  Taste goes back to my opening. Starts out great. Slam of bitterness and then where does it go? It is followed up by a huge wave of malt. Lingering sweetnesss but cloying.  Mouthfeel is medium. Alcohol heat warms up in the aftertaste.  Overall I do like this beer but wish it could be amped up a bit now. Less malt and more hop. I am thinking of Double Jack, Abrasive, Dreadnaught. Price point at $17.99 a six pack makes me go...ahem. You can do it Larry! Let's get Hopslam Into the future.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",Imperial IPA,98

The aroma is intense sweet citrus with a slight alcohol note. Taste pretty much follows the nose with bright citrus. Perfect balance of sweetness from the malts and honey. Alcohol is definitely present on the back end along with an astringent bitterness. Overall I can see why this beer has been hyped for so long.

This year it seems rather bland to me. I don't know of it has something to do with it being in cans this year or what. It's not that is bad but there are so many other choices out there now a days that are cheaper and easier to get.

Smell: Very rich and caramelly smelling. Strong hop aroma here (citrus and pine). There is a slight savory/buttery scent.  Taste: There is a powerful kick of hop bitterness at first, but not over the top. The bitterness is quickly overcome by rich, sweet, syrupy, buttery, caramel flavors!!!! The deep roasted malt flavors are very woodsy and nutty. After the sweet caramel flavors wear off, this beer fades back to a bitter hop flavor and it starts to dry off. You are left with pine and a slight smoky after taste.  Feel: Fairly full bodied for a hoppy ale. Thicker than I expected - a bit slick and syrupy. There is a drier finish though.  Overall: This is a very good beer. Better than anticipated. I saw that this beer has been rated in the top beers of the country, so I had to check it out. I live in Colorado, but grew up in Michigan.

Aroma: A punch of citrus with notes of orange and peach, with an underlying grassy, piney base. Taste: Really rich and sweet maltiness, almost candy like, with definitive citrus flavors. Resinous, strong hop bitterness slowly builds and comes to a crescendo after the swallow. Mouthfeel: Light to moderate body with a low carbonation and a hint of alcohol warmth. Finish: Bitterness and dryness grows after the swallow and lingers with some resin on the tongue. Overall: Very light and balanced for a double IPA, with the richness of the malt standing up to the hops. This causes the bitterness to slowly increase as opposed to an abrasive punch in the face.

287,17112,1000lbgrizzly,3.98,"A: Hazy orange, hardly any lasting head, spots of lace.  S: Orange rind, biscuit, honey.  T: Orange juice, mild pine resin, bitter herbs, good note of sweet honey. The finish alternates between the sweet and the bitter. No detection of the super high ABV, for the better.  M: It has a syrup/oily quality to it, not much in the way of carbonation, yet still easy to drink.  O: A good beer, surprised at the actual lack of variety of hoppy flavors and the balance between bitterness and sweetness as opposed to straightforward bitterness, although my bottle was 4 months old. I'll try it again with a fresher bottle, but for the moment it's a great IPA, nothing more.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",Imperial IPA,98

S: Bright citrus, resinous pine, backing tropical and stone fruit, bready malt, and caramel honey sweetness.  T: Resinous spicy pine, citrus, candied orange, lemon, and grapefruit, super floral, fruity notes, candied pineapple, guava, peach, passion fruit, and a touch of papaya and melon, sturdy bready malty backbone, plenty of caramel honey sweetness, and a little alcohol.  M: Medium to full body, moderate carbonation, pretty smooth, but also a little warmth.  2019 Revisit/Update: Pretty close to what I remember. Not overly complex, but doesn't need to be.

Hoppy as hell, yeah, but more bitter than I like. Like, almost aggressively bitter. Don't get me wrong, judging this objectively, they created a genuine hopslam and if I were ever in the mood for an IPA that was that intense, it would hit the spot, but I prefer my hops more spicey, citrusy, floral, and less tongue-shredding. There's some honey in there which gives a nice malty balance when it's needed, but it's too little, too late.

287,17112,ARoman,4.47,"*transferred from previous notes 1/21/2014* On tap into a tulip. It has an strong, although not quite overwhelming, grapefruit-citrus aroma with some resin and floral spiciness and a mellow lemon and grass background notes. It’s a slightly hazy, orange-gold beer with a very light foamy head that leaves an average lacing along the inside of the glass. The taste is medium-heavy bitter with maybe some light citrus sweet, but the bitter definitely dominates (would you ever guess that from the name?). It’s a medium-full body beer with a pleasant amount of carbonation. Even though the malt doesn’t readily present itself in the nose, or even in the tongue for that matter, it subtly presents in the fact that this beer is very smooth drinking for such a hop forward recipe. It’s beautifully balanced and leaves a mild hop and floral aftertaste that’s surprising clean - it doesn’t linger very long and, while it is present, doesn’t feel like it coating my mouth.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",Imperial IPA,98

Piney aftertaste that doesn't really linger.  M: medium body with medium carbonation.  O: good beer, that was not quite what I expected from a beer with the name HopSLAM. I expected a beer that was overpoweringly Hoppy that made my tastebuds melt. I didn't expect much malt to come through in this beer. The beer came through with a good hoppiness in the beginning with a strong maltiness at the end. After you swallow there the happiness returns, only in the aftertaste. It is def a pretty beer with the alcohol hidden well in the flavors. I am happy I stumbled upon this in the store but I would not go out of my way to hunt it down.

The taste is spectacular. Bursting with hops and fresh citrus, some grapefruit notes. The addition of honey is more like an after-thought, but lends a nice balanced sweetness. As it warms on the palate the alcohol comes through and leaves a pleasant mouthfeel. Its slightly carbonated and dry. Overall, it's a wonderful DIPA.

Always a nice treet when hopslam comes out to break up the snowy months but I've always kind of wished bell's would switch around hopslam and oracle on the release schedule.

Drinks incredibly balanced and smooth and there is just of malty honey sweetness to balance out the bold hop profile but not get sticky sweet or syrupy.

Pours a nice goldenrod/dark yellow color with barely any head at all. Minimal lacing. Low/moderate carbonation. Smells of hops, pine, and sweet fruit (grapefruit, apples, oranges, mango). Light bodied, and very lively on the palate. Very smooth for 10%. Initial taste is bitter hops with hints of pine, citrus, and orange peel. Settles into a mild, tart sweetness, then another kick of hops and bitterness on the back end.  A great DIPA. Very well balanced and enjoyable. Not the best I've had, but far from the worst. I'd probably pick up a 6 pack if I could find one.  ------  Revisited on February 18, 2016. This year's batch seems to have much more of a honey flavor than last years. Much better, IMO.

287,17112,mschrei,5,"Initially rated the 2015 Release at 4.56, and that was the first time I had it. Wanted to re-rate and review it, as I am really enjoying this years more than last. Perhaps it is because I'm heavier into stout season this year and this is a welcome relief to my palate, perhaps it's cans vs. bottles, or perhaps it really is just that outstanding. I had two six packs, both canned on 1/21/16. Much better when poured into proper glassware – a Hopslam snifter that I got last week in anticipation. Pouring it opens it up, softens it, but most importantly, allows the juiciness to step forward. Golden orange and cloudy, strong carb and lacing. Beautifully strong hop nose. I opened and poured the first one the day I got it home and the hops hit me from two feet away. Incredibly well balanced. Hoppy and bitter, but plenty of citrus zest follows with the accompanying sweetness of the honey. Mouth filling creamy feel. Extremely well done. I will miss you, giant hop. See you next year.  Yet another edit-after drinking the 2017 edition, I love this beer even more. I'm just going to have to bump it up to a five. It is that good.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",Imperial IPA,98

Last year I held this in very regard, challenging the best of the best. Made it a point to secure a case this time. I've never had it's like. Call it a double ipa or whatever, the sweetness of honey makes this beer shine. February is a great time for those of us who look for non-winter-warmers, and hopslam is just that. Can't wait til july to have one outside. A question I always ask to beer folks is...'if you were on death row, and got to pick your last meal and the beer to go along with it, what would that beer be?'

No piney flavor for her (what she hates) and some booze on the taste, readily apparent it's 10%. For me, I have sweet citrus upfront, definite booze bite on the end. Warms as it goes down. Oily mouthfeel, thick and delicious. This is my second year with Hopslam. I didn't take notes last year and I wish I did.

287,17112,Qbdoo,4.34,"I finally got my hands on this. Looks great, a murky golden hue. Unfiltered? I should check. Intriguing scent. I don't want to say I smell the honey, but there's an odd sweetness that is not familar to me. Smells more barleywine-ish than DIPA-ish. Mouthfeel is its strongest quality. Dense and oily. Feels big. Taste is a bit of a puzzle for me. Not typical for a DIPA. Piney hops on the opening but a great deal on honeyed sweetness on the end. I really like it but feel like it gravitates toward an American style barleywine, which isn't a criticism. Overall, I can see why this gets so much hype, it's a great beer, but perhaps not as mindblowing as you would be led to expect.  Update: two years later, after deciding not to spend the $20 on a sixer last year, I can say the most recent version nearly lives up to its reputation. The coarser barleywine-line qualities I saw two years ago have been smoothed out. Also, I can see the incredible combination of power and balance that I didn't see before. Besides the fact that this year's version is simply better, I think the name is misleading and when you go in expecting a hop monster and just get an incredibly well-balanced DIPA, you can be disappointed.

287,17112,aleigator,4.28,"Many thanks to Charlie for the bottle!  2015 vintage  Pours a big, froth head, with tiny, crystallic bubbles in it, while the beer has a clean, darker amber, orange color.  The aromas contain a big load of tropical hops, featuring peach, mango and blood orange, which are utmost juicy and ripe. This gets balanced by bready, slightly biscuity malts, accentuating a zingy, glazed lemon peak on top of the distinct fruitiness. The nose is very rich and intriguing, as it is bursting with mellow, luscious tropical fruits, very well compounded.  Taste begins with crisp lime among bready malts, while the beer drinks very smooth. A vivid kiwi prickling gets added to the taste, as well as more lime and sunny, louche grapefruit. Honey is certainly noteable, while the alcohol is not detectable at all, and it provides the fruity hops with a ripe, sappy note, as it leads the malt flavor closer to the hops by adding a striking biscuity quality to them. The beer doesn't turn sweet though, it is still centered around the hoppiness, which is yet evolving on the palate. A distinct, slick bitterness arises from the fruitiness, leading to a slightly dry, long lasting finish, continously using the hops as center of attraction, exhibiting a slightly piney note, blending smooth into the sapful fruits. The carbonation still adds a slightly refreshing impression, while the beer is heavier bodied, without loosing its typical IPA drinkability, ending with a unique honeyed, hoppy finish.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",Imperial IPA,98

287,17112,Roguer,4.33,"Beautiful orange/amber brew, just slightly hazy, topped my a humble snow-white head. Fantastic retention, and a nice line of lacing.  Fairly traditional IPA aroma: extremely juicy, loaded with citrus and tropical flavors, some pine, honey, and a balance of caramel and pale malt biscuit.  Flavor follows, with big, juicy hops up forward, balanced by a nice sweetness. No graininess to the malt profile; some honey and brown sugar and flat biscuit. Hops come in juicy, bitter waves: ruby red grapefruit, lemon, orange peel, resin.  The mouthfeel really is superb: crisp and bitter and balanced. Exceptionally drinkable; drinks like a 7% IPA, not a 10% DIPA! Almost effervescent, not-quite-dry finish, with a lingering bitterness.  The hype train with Hopslam may have run off the rails, or perhaps it has simply been eclipsed in recent years by the ubiquity of fantastic DIPAs (and even TIPAs).

287,17112,TheCraftBrewReview,4.52,"Over the past few years, I have encountered triumph and heartbreak when attempting to obtain an extremely hyped beer that was only available in limited quantity. After stalking the twitter feeds of local beer stores, I was able to confirm the exact bottle release for the 2015 Hopslam Ale at Green’s Beverages located on Buford Highway in Atlanta, GA. After practically colliding into a light post and almost running over a homeless man, I parked my car and sprinted into the store. Looking left then right, and not noticing anything out of the ordinary, the cashier grudgingly pointed to the back wall where there was a line of several people quickly forming. As each six pack was handed off to another enthusiastic beer lover, I grew more and more anxious, and my hands began to perspire. When it was my turn, I hopped to the front of the line with glee, only to hear the store associate bark, “That’s it. No more in this stack.” My mouth dropped, and just as I thought the nightmare had just begun, a pack of Hopslam was placed into my trembling hands. Let the games begin!  Appearance – 96: Poured the 12 ounce bottle into a tulip glass. I was first taken back by its magnificent, bright orange glow followed by the hazy cloudiness from being unfiltered. The 1/2 inch head provided decent lacing that quickly dissipated after the pour.  Aroma – 91: Up front there are notes of citrus and some pine. I was a little disappointed because I was expecting more of a punch in the nose, as the scent quickly tapers off.  Body & Texture – 97: For a massively hopped ale, this is amazingly balanced. There are many imperial IPA’s that exhibit a syrupy feel and tend to be heavy, but this is even-keeled and medium bodied for its beer style. It has just enough carbonation so that you are left with a crisp, smooth finish and the right amount of bitterness. Very refreshing.  Taste – 97: This is where Hopslam shines, as I feel exactly like the guy on the bottle label that fell flat on his back from the gigantic, overpowering hops. After my first sip, I am immediately overcome by a wonderful blend of tropical, citrus flavors along with strong floral notes and sticky, piney hops. Hints of grapefruit, orange, and stone fruit are complemented by a touch of sweetness from the added honey, which keeps the bitterness from overwhelming the palate. The alcohol is hidden well (for a double IPA at 10% ABV) and caught up to me quickly after consuming my second bottle.  Overall – 95 (World-class): I rank this imperial IPA in the same tier as Alchemist’s Heady Topper, Russian River’s Pliny The Elder, and Lawson’s Double Sunshine. At first, I was a little skeptical when the label indicated that the beer was brewed with honey, which is not typical for an IPA. After only a few swigs it became quite clear that the sweetness was what distinguished Hopslam from its predecessors and made me thoroughly appreciate this brew. I want to thank the folks at Green’s Beverages who provided me with daily updates from their Twitter page.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",Imperial IPA,98

The taste is an interesting transition from citrus, to malty, honey, then to Vidalia onion, and finally to lingering blend of honey and hop bitterness. I think this might be the fullest spectrum of flavors across one beer that I have encountered to date. You certainly don't sense the 10% that will hit you full steam about 3/4 of the way through the glass. I love me some DFH 120 minute IPA, but for the price, I think this is the winner.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",Imperial IPA,98

287,17112,Phigg1102,3.94,"I have to be quite honest, this is an ok IPA. I enjoy it and will drink again if I come across it in season without the fuss over where to get it. Not one of the top IPAs in the world by any stretch of the imagination though. Not even better than two hearted (not even close IMO). The hype is probably a result of the market being flooded by incredible IPAS in the last 5 or so years. This was probably the best around ten years ago, but now its being past over. My negative statements about this beer are not intended to make a claim that this is a BAD beer, IT IS GOOD! It is not however one of the best beers, or even IPA's that I've had. In any case I'll give a bit of a review as well.  Clear light amber in color. Slight honey in the aroma along with fairly heavy malt and a touch of booze. Nice balance of slightly bitter pine hoppiness and malt, the honey definetely brings the sweetness out a bit more. The body is medium with little carbonation. The bitterness lingers for a fair amount of time which is quite nice.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",Imperial IPA,98

I knew Hopslam would be good, but I was beginning to think that it couldn't possibly live up to the hype.  I tried a glass up at a friends cabin this weekend and can say that I would not change a single thing about this beer. Looks beautiful in a glass; I could smell it all day; and it has a perfect balance of sharp, hoppy bitterness and delicate ""nectar of the gods"" sweetness.

287,17112,SierraFlight,4.38,"12oz bottle poured into tulip. Hazy orange liquid topped by a finger of ivory head that settles to a clingy ring. Streaks and dots of lacing are left behind. Aroma is pineapple, grapefruit, bread, citrus zest, a bit of honey and some alcohol. Taste follows the nose, with a beautiful sweetness up front that is abruptly replaced by a mellow lingering bitterness and some wafting booziness. On the full side of medium body, creamy but sadly not as sticky as I’d have liked, medium foamy carbonation, drying and boozy on the finish.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",Imperial IPA,98

It tells me Hop Slam is on-par with the best-of-the-best! 2019 edition...same applies, except for the Green Tea IPA part ( wish Stone would revisit that!!!),. All-in-all, Hopslam is a very good D/IPA, but not worthy the hype nor price....IMHO. 2020 edition...all the above...however, as far as a seasonal, it does make me look forward to it’s release! 2021 editon...delicious...and I'm kinda getting the hype!

287,17112,DaverCS,4.68,"2015 vintage. Pours amber color with 1 finger off-white head. Nice lacing on the glass.  Aroma gives florel hops. More oiliness than citrusy. I get a solid presence of malt. Some dankness.  This is a big, thick, mouth- coating beer. This is definitely more of an east-coast IPA. Multiple flavors going on. First is that strong hop florelness, followed by some dankness. I get some nice citrus for a second after the florelness. It transitions into an onion and garlic taste in the middle of the mouth. I get a nice strong malt presence at the end with a kiss of honey. Right before the end of the sip is an alcohol hit that almost brings a slight spice to the sip.  I use to LOVE east cost style IPA's. While they are way more balanced than their counterparts, they are just so thick! The beer boasts extreme hoppiness. I think if the malt was tamed down, this would be more present. However, for the style, it is very good! I understand why this is the OG of the IPA world. I pair it with a grilled whole fish with lemon and capers. I give it a 93.6/100.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",Imperial IPA,98

Hop oil in the middle with a suprisingly clean finish.  Feel: Medium-heavy mouth feel with a clean finish.

Bright astringent pine, grapefruit, solid nose, but not overpowering. Hint of honey and booziness after awhile. Sweet on the front of the tongue, followed by solid pine in the middle and a classic, big bitterness towards the end... mellowing into a nice honey sweetness. Grapefruit/citrus came out a bit more for me as the glass warmed up. Solid mouthfeel, refreshing but not run of the mill... I expect that the honey added some of this aspect. Totally worth the hype.

Some lacing left, but not as much as you would expect with the super-foamy head.  Smell - Piney and sweet. Some hops present but not a lot.  Taste - Piney up front, then a sweet transition into the hops, which aren't palate destroying, but are definitely present in the middle to back-end of the taste, and have quite a strong taste and after taste. The sweetness is just right with a slight honey taste that doesn't overwhelm (i don't mind adjuncts in my beer, but the less the better). For all you sippers our there, The honey sweetness comes out more the warmer the beer gets.  Feel - Moderately thick for an IPA, but is so foamy and airy that it seems to just float in your mouth.  Overall - Doesn't live up to the vast hype that surrounds it, but how many do? This is a very good beer with a slight enough touch of sweetness that it won't deter die-hards, but will attract many newbies.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",Imperial IPA,98

287,17112,Pliny_the_Gelder,4.02,"Nothing wrong with the nose; piney and almost mango-ey, like the best WC IPAs I've tried. Honey immediately noticeable in taste and texture. Unlike any IPA I've tried, honestly, but reminds me of the fruitier SD IPAs I've tasted (without going malty). Can't quite put my finger on the aftertaste; almost tart, but not infection. Like a DFH90 w/o the malt. Booze definitely present in nose and taste as it warms. Piney but sticky sweet; wouldn't go so far as to call it resinous like a Rip Current signature, though. Glad I finally got to try... Not quite the IPA the 100 rating led me to expect, but an awesome, fun (dangerous, shareable) beer that isn't anywhere close to what ""HypeSlam"" claims had me worried it could be.

287,17112,steveh,4.21,"A trade gift from the resident hophead at work. Only ever had Hopslam on tap in the past.  A -- Pours a hazy peach color with a dense, long-lasting white head that leaves good lacing.  S -- Aroma starts piny and resiny then mellows to light tropical fruit esters. An earthy, herbal character develops with more warming.  T -- First taste is lightly sweet biscuit malt that folds into fruit esters and then into resiny bitter hops. The biscuit malt maintains an underlying presence as a good balance backbone to the hop and yeast characters. Bitterness lingers in the finish along with peppery alcohol. Resiny bitterness continues through the aftertaste, but never really becomes harsh.  M -- Mouthfeel is crisp up front and syrupy on the tongue with a dry finish, much warming from alcohol, and a medium-robust mouthfeel.  O -- A great interpretation of the style that remains strong in its hoppiness without hitting palate wrecking degrees. ABV strength makes it a definite sipper.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",Imperial IPA,98

Finishes semi-dry. Overall: With a name like ""Hopslam"" I was expecting to have the top of my head blown clean off with an overabundance of hops. That was not the case. Instead, I found this beer to be sweet and bubbly and very mild in the hops department. Although this beer was very enjoyable from start to finish I was not slammed by any hops. P.S.

T - Hops hit first, with a mid swig heat note, followed by a malty, honey sweet finish. The hops are strong, you get a touch of sea salt, but no onion, and is balanced enough to keep it from being over the top.  M - The carbonation seems above average, a spot sharp. It holds together well, and is neither thin or syrupy/sticky  O - Always tough to live up to the hype/expectations, seeing the ratings, the forum talk, etc..beforehand.

The smell is hoppy and has a slight tinge of alcohol to it, with a minute amount of fruitiness. The taste is very bitter then it dissipates quickly, leaving you with a fruity (grapefruit-esque?) flavor that dies down into a biscuity sort of taste. The back end is a nice warming sensation of alcohol, but not strong. Subtle, to the point where it's most enjoyable.

A little sweet, but a good hop taste and malt presence. I do not get the boozy taste others are reporting.  F (4.25) -Nice carb, easy drinking.  O (4.25) - Overall a solid beer.

287,17112,spacebear09,4.31,Very crisp and slightly sweet DIPA. Not what I was expecting but it's good. Mouthfeel is the best part of this beer. Taste is honey and caramel malts with light hoppy notes coming through in a resinous finish. Not as hop-forward as I would have expected. Very good but if I want a DIPA this usually isn't what I would reach for. Still good and very drinkable. Not worth the crazy hype though.,Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",Imperial IPA,98
287,17112,itsratso,4.55,"i think what this comes down to is the west coast vs east coast iipa thing. this beer, in my book, is the best example of an east coast iipa. the hops may star in the west coast version, but the malt plays a much bigger role here as compared to a west coast iipa. the hops are big, piney and resinous. but the malt is sweet with a huge mouthfeel and just delicious. i love both styles, but this is one of the best.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",Imperial IPA,98

287,17112,Czequershuus,5,"Finally reviewing to back up my rating. This beer pours a fairly hazy orange with a large head. The aroma features grapefruit peel, tangerine peel, pineapple, mango, and a bit of caramel and salt. The flavor lead with a blast tangerine peel, followed by just a touch of honey sweetness, and background notes of pineapple, guava, and mango. The mouthfeel is full and very fizzy.

287,17112,dmgeng,4.58,"I tried this once long ago and I figured I would review it now with a fresh one.  A - Nice amber-orange color. Pretty clear with fine white head and strong lacing.  S - Hop bomb with a mix of citrus, herbal, and resiny tones. Has a sweet candy like hop fragrance that is nice but is somewhat muddled compared to some DIPAs out there.  T - Full flavored with a pungent hop character that has citrus, resin, herb, and some fruit with alcohol and malt to round it out. There is a distinct honey flavor that compliments the strong bitterness but is definitely hop forward. Definitely a bitter hop bite but I relish in the hops.  M - Very full mouth-feel with good carbonation. Very thick for an IIPA and the honey definitely adds a lot of body along with the sweetness and the amount of resin doesn't make it any lighter. Pretty much the anti-light pilsner beer.  Overall, a very good DIPA. Great appearance, smell, and flavor but does have substantial bitterness and is very thick so it might not be the best beer for your first DIPA. This brew is not a light beer but if you like big, resiny, and complex beer I'd recommended it. Like I remember it is mostly bitter and pretty thick so I think it is slightly over hyped but a delicious beer none the less.

At first, yes it is good, a lot of bitterness up front, sweet from the honey and the malt. As it warms (and I would advise to drink this from the start at room temperature. Don't even chill it slightly) so much pops! The fruit is pineapple and it appears at the back end of the taste like right before the beer goes down your throat. And then it stays and says what's up! Then from there, yes GENIUS. It's like I'm listening to a symphony and hearing for the first time all of the intricate parts and timbres. Same with this beer. It's like an intellectual beer. I'm constantly thinking about what I'm tasting and what flavor combinations are there. Highly recommend for those that appreciate the more subtle things in a German beer.

Rich nose of grapefruit and pine hops, biscuit like sweetness coupled with a subtle honey note and just the slightest hint of alcohol.  Rich heavy medium body with a texture that is both oily and creamy. Slightly above normal carbonation with a touch of effervescence in the middle and a nice burst in the finish.  The World Class flavor profile is quite intense, very complex and reasonably balanced. It begins with a slam of grapefruit that slowly takes on a pine character. As the hop flavor fades, the rich biscuit and honey sweetness comes to the forefront. In the middle, a mild bitterness takes the lead. A blend of the above slowly fade and jostle for prominence going into the finish.

Citrus and Pine. Smells delicious. Malt is sweet smelling which I assume is due to the honey as well. Very fresh smelling. Can I drink this through my nose? Maybe.  T: Bang! If you're a hop head you'll enjoy it alot. Its bitter as hell initially, but gives way to a nice malty sweet finish with the citrus revealing itself along the way. First drink is always a bit shocking. Second one reveals why this beer has such a great following. At 10% you know your drinking a big one. The booze is present, but fits just right with the rest of it. Its big flavor from start to finish, and the beauty of this beer is its drinkability.  M: Awesome smooth mouthfeel. Malty and full. Juicy just like it looks. Carbonation is completely spot on.  Overall: From pour to finish it seemed to last maybe 10 min. Is it allowable to make a 10% DIPA so damn drinkable? Yes! The mark of any good beer is your desire for its next drink, and this one is pure lust from a hopheads perspective. Its a different beer from the start to the finish, and as my comrade finshed one swallow before myself, and he said, ""Damn, that was delicious.""

287,17112,blankenhoney,4.54,"Bottles dated 1.8.15 and enjoyed out of a Hopslam glass between 1.15 and 1.25.15.  A: Pours a mostly clear coppery orange with a soapy, 1-finger head. Minimal retention and lots of soapy lacing on my glass.  S: Pungent aromas of resiny and pine-heavy hops, followed by notes of candied orange peel, generally intense citrus aromas, and thick, bready malt. Kind of like a grown-up's version of orange juice. Good stuff, but fails to signal the flavors that are about to blow up your mouth.  T: One week after bottling, Hopslam leads with enormous flavors of piney and resiny hops that are insanely bitter. That quickly gives way to orange peel, creamed honey, a hoppy tingle, and a nice alcohol burn. White peach skin, too (srs). Hops are fragrant and floral, and balance perfectly with the strong malt presence. Bottles consumed further away from the bottling date lacked the hop wallop up front, but were still delicious.  M: Vinous, oily, and lightly syrupy, with a lovely dry and bitter finish. Hopslam is incredibly crushable, especially because there's no fooling yourself you're drinking a 10% beer. You know having more than 2 bottles in a sitting would be a mistake, but you grab a third bottle with ZFG.  O: One of my favorite DIPAs, and the beer that sent me spiraling into craft-beer madness 2 years ago. Hopslam is phenomenal even 3-4 weeks after bottling, but the fresher you can find it the better. Those bitter, biting, and dank flavors you get with an ultra-fresh bottle are about as good as it gets in the DIPA realm.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",Imperial IPA,98

Smell is quite sweet, likely due to the added honey. Smell was not very strong, thus the lower rating.  T: Pine, resin, slightly floral hops, balanced with sweet malts. Not super bitter, instead it’s quite balanced. A very good IPA. Also, despite the 10% ABV, the alcohol was undetectable.  F: Smooth, medium-full bodied. Carbonation level is average.

Nice soapy lacing clings around the glass, with some light streaming carbonation. Aromas of big grapefruit, tangerine, pineapple, mango, apricot, lemon zest, orange peel, pine, honey, light caramel, bread, and floral/grassy earthiness. Damn nice aromas with good balance and complexity of citrus/tropical hops and moderate malt sweetness; with good strength. Some light booziness shows up as it warms. Taste of big grapefruit, tangerine, pineapple, mango, apricot, lemon zest, orange peel, pine, honey, light caramel, bread, and floral/grassy earthiness. Good amount of pine/citrus rind bitterness on the finish; with lingering notes of grapefruit, tangerine, pineapple, mango, apricot, lemon/orange zest, pine, honey, light caramel, bread, and floral/grassy earthiness on the finish for a good bit. Fantastic complexity and robustness of big citrus/tropical hops and moderate malt sweetness; with a great malt/bitterness balance and zero cloying flavors after the finish. Medium carbonation and medium-full bodied; with a smooth, fairly crisp/sticky, and lightly creamy mouthfeel that is great. Alcohol is well hidden with only a light warming present after the finish. Overall this is an outstanding double IPA style. All around awesome complexity and balance of big citrus/tropical hops and moderate malt sweetness; and very smooth to sip on for the big ABV. A highly enjoyable offering.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",Imperial IPA,98
287,17112,leroybrown10,4.24,"Noticeable hiss when the bottle cap is popped open. Pours a deep golden color that reminds me of the honey that is added to this beer. Seems thick. Pale cream colored head that is one finger thick. Heavy, sticky lacing left behind once the head settles. Tiny bubbles rise in a continuous stream from the bottom of the snifter.  Major hop aromas. Citrus flavors of mango, grapefruit, tangerine and orange. Some mild pine. Heavy sweet honey. Some underlying bready malt.  First sip is sweet honey and a citrus hop assault on the taste buds.. Mango and orange. Sweet caramel malt provides some balance to the hops but are still close to being overwhelmed. Some peppery notes. Sour grapefruit and resiny pine on the back end.  This is a oily IPA which leaves the tongue feeling thick and coated. That oily nature causes the flavors to linger and intensify with every subsequent sip. Medium carbonation and a little alcohol bite though not as much as the 10% abv would lead you to believe.  An excellent hoppy DIPA that does have some sweetness and malt balance. Only a trace amount of bitterness. Fairly easy drinking as well which could get you in trouble with the 10% abv.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",Imperial IPA,98

287,17112,Sparty1224,4.59,"Serving: 12 oz. bottle poured into a tulip. Bottled on 1/10/15, making this 11 days old.  A: Pours a nice, bright golden color with a 3/4 finger white head. Perfectly clear, no haze.  S: Pineapple, mango, peach. A touch of honey sweetness here, much more prominent than previous vintages.  T: Great, complex hop flavor up front. Several different varietals give way to a nice mixture of grapefruit, peach, banana. Back of the mouth gives more piney and resinous flavors.  M: Nice and full. At 10%, alcohol is well hidden here. Finish is not overly bitter or bruising, but it does stick on your tongue for a while.  O: So I had this fresh on draft just yesterday and am able to compare to the bottle version directly. I do slightly prefer this more on draft, as those pours were a bit more aromatic for me, the flavors popped just a touch more, and the mouthfeel was a bit more creamy and smooth. Nonetheless, this beer, in any format, is outstanding. It's refreshing to drink a mixed-hopped DIPA after so many single-hopped beers (mostly of the citra variety). This one is so well balanced and complex. Nice to see the honey come through much more this year as well. Unlike some people on these forums, I've actually grown more fond of this beer over time and I think it ranks right up there with the best of the DIPAs.  Recommendation: A must-try for any craft beer fan. Drink it fresh!",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",Imperial IPA,98

287,17112,PaulyB83,4.5,"Bottled 01/08/15 Poured into a Sam Adams glass.  L- Medium amber, looks like honey, good clarity, two finger slightly off white head dissipated quickly to a ring.  S- Big hop aroma on this beer, hop dankness, mango, pineapple, maybe a little stone fruit, I believe I'm getting quite a bit of Simcoe and Citra here, I know I've read that this is exclusively dry hopped with Simcoe. I swear I can smell a slight presence of the honey. The abv is only slightly present.  T- The dankness comes through more in the flavor, pine that you don't get from the aroma, and then some of those fruit notes come through, finishes with a light bitter bite and a definitely lingering honey flavor can be detected. Some of the alcohol comes through, a bit more than I'd like but only a slight warming on the tongue.  F- Slightly syrupy but a good mouthfeel for such a big beer.  O- An amazing beer that is worthy of hype and one every hop head should try at least once. The honey adds a dimension to it that others do not have, for me I find it takes away slightly from the hops but it still works, it just might not be everyone's cup of tea. Another thing I have found is that this beer is really best within the first couple of week from bottling. I find the alcohol can become more present at about a month, it's the same problem I have with Oracle as well.

Very good overall.  S: Very mellow, actually. It has a very grassy, floral smell that's mixed with some citrus and pine. Not very robust, but still good. I think that the smell isn't as robust owing to how old the beer is.  T: Very good. Pine and citrus and more apparent in the taste than in the smell.

I had been saving the last of my six pack and decided that enough was enough. While its characteristics had changed, it was not enough to discard the review. It held up remarkably well.  A: Nearly clear, bright golden honey coloring. One fingers worth of fine, soapy, crystal white (peachy tint). Fades slowly to a thing cap and a moderate ring. Looks vastly different from other top notch DIPAs,  S: Peach, strong apricot, mild honey, piney resin, subdued hop aroma... especially for a 10% DIPA. Each component comes through with great clarity, usually it takes me some time to work through the aromas, Hopslam presents itself very clearly.  T: Yes. Yes, yes, and more yes. This will clean your palate... not a scorcher, but it provides a fresh cleansing as the powerful hop flavor rolls over your tongue, with wave after wave of honey, lemon, grapefruit, apricot, and sweet malt following along for the ride. Drool worthy.  M: Medium carbonation, creamy body, clean... but not dry. Leaves behind a fractional amount of hop oil and honey, just enough to keep you in a state of nirvana before grabbing the glass again. Once again, this is not a west coast style beer, this is a balanced midwest iteration, it is smooth from start to finish.  0: One of my personal favorite DIPAs. Has tremendous midwest IPA maltiness, a tremendous nose, a tremendous taste... a damn fine beer that is worth picking up whenever the opportunity arises. I rank this up with Heady, Double Sunshine, and Dreadnaught amongst the best of the style that I have had the pleasure of trying.  Update:  Bottled 1.6.21.

287,17112,Buschyfor3,4.21,"(review from tasting notes)  Serving: 12 oz draft served in a pint glass at Pazzo’s, Lexington, KY  A: Honeyed body with amber-gold highlights; off-white head recedes to collar quickly.  S: Spicy/herbal scent of hops, then sweet fruitiness envelops the nose – citrus, grapefruit, tropical (mango, melon?); a honey-like note lingers throughout as well; surprisingly, I don’t get any sense of the alcohol on the nose, which I expected given my other experiences with big DIPAs.  T: Herbal hops, pungent, juicy pine and some bittering grapefruit, all of which is then moderated by a wave of sweeter fruit flavors running from orange to tropical pineapple; definitely picking up the unmistakable flavor of honey on the middle palate; a biscuity flavor in there as well mellowing before the finish comes with a residual bitterness from the hops; alcohol does start to sneak in late in the glass, but its presence is more of a glowing warmth instead of full-on peppery/fusel heat.  M: Oily but very smooth; carb is just enough to cut through the slickness, without the body feeling too thick or syrupy.  O: What can I say, I am not much of a D/IPA drinker, but this is one that I actually enjoyed. Bell’s has showcased a pleasing array of hops varietals, covering everything from juicy and spicy, to sweeter, tropical citrus fruitiness, all while avoiding that growing trend of creating a pungent, resiny pine-bomb that seems to be the M.O. for most DIPAs these days.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",Imperial IPA,98

Spotty lacing is left behind as the beer is drank.  Aroma is a huge hit of grapefruit and tropical fruit (mango and pineapple stand out), along with underlying pine, honey and sweet, caramel malt.  Taste seems to be reversed, with the sweetness of the honey and malt taking the lead initially. Mid-palate the fruits and pine join to balance nicely throughout the finish.  Mouthfeel is medium-heavy with medium carbonation. Bitterness is on the high end, but appropriately so to cut through the caramel malt and honey.  Overall, Hopslam was the beer that really made me fall in love with craft beer.

As if moves through the palate, the alcohol shows up and reminds you this is 10% and finishes with punchy hops.

Little tiny carbonation bottles flowing from bottom to top, lively.  I'm drinking this a little late, okay a lot late, for this beer, but it has been kept well, though the nose suffers a little bit. It's not bad, it just doesn't have that umph that you'd expect. Lemony sweet honey, some herbal hops, not a big malt nose, but the typical character is there.  Man this thing is good. A bit drying thanks to the honey and I feel like the bitterness helps with that, as well. Still a fairly medium-full bodied beer. Pretty boozey(hot vodka-ey alcohol), but the malt/hops cover it up fairly well and it doesn't really detract from the character of the beer. Noticable honey flavor which I like; I find a typical smoothness from a honeyed beer.  BA reviews at 100? Far from a perfect beer, but 94 from the bros sounds about right. Overall, this can fight on it's own against any of the top DIPAs, but I still don't find any character that makes this a standout, very unlike a lot of Bell's other beers.

287,17112,Louisville-Beer-Reviews,4.43,"Appearance: Clear, golden orange color with a very thick, persistent head and heavy lacing.  Aroma: Fruity aromas of stone fruits, dried peaches/apricots, and a bit of pine.  Taste & Mouthfeel: A strong flavor and texture of honey on the tongue, with a bit of alcohol flavor in there as well. Sharp, grapefruit flavor is present as well, with the finish introducing sweet, full, nutty malts, and piney, slightly resiny hops. Alcohol flavor is still present throughout, but overall the alcohol and hop bitterness are well balanced by the sweet citrus, honey, and malts.  Final Word: One of the best balanced IPAs I’ve had, especially considering that it is a Double IPA! Bell’s says that this brew has the most complex hopping schedule of anything they produce, and it shows in the amazing variety of hop flavors and aromas experienced here. In most beers this high use of hops would translate to the final product being overwhelmingly bitter and dry, but Bell’s wisely balanced the profile with sweet, nutty malts, and honey. As I drank this beer I kept feeling that the honey’s texture and flavor was the glue that holds this beer together; it bridges the gap between the resiny hops and the nutty malts, while lending a grounding sweetness to the entire profile. The only complaint I had was that the higher ABV made itself known every once in a while by coming up in the flavor, but this still doesn’t taste like a 10% ABV beer. While folks new to craft beer might still find the hop character a little overwhelming, this is absolutely a brew that everyone should try if given the chance.

In a good way... Makes for a sweet, easy drinking DIPA. Unreal at 10%. It's thick and creamy. I tend to like my IPA's more dry and crisp. I still have to say it's slightly overrated, mostly due to hype though. That's not Bells fault, so I won't knock it. I don't believe it should be flying off shelves at near $20 a 6'er. On that note. It's 'supply and demand' and I will seek out what I can. Hopslam is perhaps the smoothest IPA on the market~",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",Imperial IPA,98
287,17112,Bone53,4.65,"Poured from a bottle into a snifter at around 45 degrees Fahrenheit  Appearance: Orange golden color with a one finger off white head  Smell: Candied bright fruits, pine, honey, with a sweet malt backbone. Very clean aromas, although i do pick up the alcohol as expected.  Taste: Tropical and citrus hops, honey, sweet malts. In that order. Even cleaner than the aroma  Mouthfeel: Medium body; Very smooth with slight bitterness  Overall: Although Hopslam is abundant in my area, it has slipped through the cracks for a couple years. I have to say it does live up to the hype and is on another level from other great DIPAs iv had. It's superbly balanced with bright fruit, pine, honey, and sweet malt characteristics. Making it even better, I found $3 bottles at my local mix n match bar and walked out with a cheaper six pack than most ($18). Compared to other beers iv had in the same style, its slightly better than Dirtwolf and Double Trouble IMO and on par with Sucks and Head Hunter, but not quite up there with my favorite DIPA right now, Enjoy By. Although an outstanding beer, I think the limited release hypes this beer up more than it should be",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",Imperial IPA,98
287,17112,Dawgboned37,3.53,"Poured from a very fresh bottle shortly after this year's release into a tulip glass. The aroma from the very start just has a bitingly bitter smell to it. This beer is bitter for bitter's sake, which isn't really my thing. I've tried it a few times, and I just can't seem to enjoy the abuse to my tongue (as indicated by the artwork on the bottle). The malt is evident through the sip, but almost completely overwhelmed by the hop bitterness.  As the beer ages, the hop bitterness dissipates quite a bit, and becomes much more pleasant in my opinion. However, since most IPA's are meant to be enjoyed fresh, I must rate this based on the fresh bottle.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",Imperial IPA,98
287,17112,mrfrancis,4,"A: Pours a clear, golden amber with a thick, slowly receding white head.  S: Aromas of honey, caramel, biscuits, herbs, lemon, lime, bitter orange, grapefruit, pine, spruce, and astringent alcohol fill the nose.  T: Notes of pine, spruce, peppermint, sage, kumquat, grapefruit, lemon, lime, and bitter orange spring from a base of honey, cream, biscuits, crackers, and caramel. The finish displays strong, pungent notes of lemon, lime, bitter orange, grapefruit, and herbs before a sneaky, heavy-handed hit of peppery alcohol dominates the fade.  M: Full in body, but not particularly heavy or thick. This ale starts off rather dry for the style before turning resinous around mid-palate. Carbonation is active and firm, yet it is also somewhat delicate. Alcohol is pronounced, lending this beer a fiery bite that is most noticeable on the finish.  O: A nice DIPA to be sure, but I am still not certain that I understand or appreciate the furor that surrounds this beer's yearly release. It is definitely good, perhaps even very good for the style, but I have had ales of this style that are better balanced, more readily available, less expensive, more approachable, and that present a better, more sophisticated integration of bold hop and succulent malt flavors. Then again, judging by the name, as well as the attitudes and preferences of the crowd drawn into Hopslam's oddly rabid and surprisingly steadily expanding cult following, this is a beer for the truly hop obsessed. As if my reviews do not make this clear, I am not one of those guys, at least not consistently. Still, I can appreciate Hopslam for what it is: a big, unbelievably aggressive DIPA for the legion of self-professed hopheads inhabiting the netherworld of American craft beer geekdom.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",Imperial IPA,98

S - A blast of citrus dominated hops.  T - A hop forward citrus blast followed with rich malt finish.  M - Very rich and creamy - very easy to drink. Excellent carbonation level.  O - This is just a great beer. The flavors are complex enough that you don't even notice the 10% ABV (not sure that's a good thing).

287,17112,bradenh,4.18,"Hopslam (2014)- the first Hopslam release I have had. I heard last years was better but anyways...  A- Golden, light brown. Caramel is probably the best color description though  S- More malty and sweet that piney and tropical, overall balanced between malt and hops.  T- Very slight carbonation fizz and sweet hops come through on the from end. Aftertaste is slightly bitter, dry, piney and hoppy.  MF- Not too familiar with mouth feel describing words yet, in between a water and milk consistency, full bodied.  O- It's a very drinkable and balanced DIPA I must admit. I used to never like IPAs, but I am really starting to enjoy them now. This is a great DIPA if you can get your hands on it. BUT IF YOU CAN'T, DON'T FEEL LIKE YOU ARE MISSING OUT. This beer (at least this years Hopslam) is not worth $20 for a 6pk. I lean towards the less sweet, more hoppy, piney, and citrusy IPAs (Victory Dirtwolf and Great Lakes Chillwave for example) and this 2014 Hopslam didn't quite make me fall in love with it. If I can get next years bottle I would be very happy, but if not, that's fine.

Mouthfeel: Medium to high carbonation. It's medium bodied, smooth and surprisingly easy to drink.

Crystal clear copper colored body with a generous off white head which persists throughout leaving layers of lacing, impressive considering the abv.  No strong aromas, but hops and sweetness rise up.  Just an excellent tasting imperial IPA. Big aggressive hop punch, but the most impressive aspect is the superbly strong malt balance. Malt doesn't hide below, but comes up swinging with the hops. A lesser malt bill would have been swamped, making the drink a solid hop bomb. Well crafted brew.

Creamy and smooth for mouthfeel, with a refreshing and crisp finish. The hops linger on the tongue for quite a while after one swallow. The taste is full of hops and honey!

Smell: Honey, tea, and pine, as well as caramel malt. Much more honey here than I expected.  Taste: There really is a lot of honey here--I think a bit too much. There's also lemon to match the pine from the hops, and a bit of malt flavor. It is somewhat boozy, but then again it is 10% ABV.  Mouthfeel: Medium bodied, fairly smooth and almost creamy. Carbonation is medium. This is less bitter than I expected, with the honey leaving sweetness on the tongue.  Overall: Overall, I didn't find the complexity here that I was looking for, and it didn't have the hop flavors that I was looking for (I think the honey and alcohol burn got in the way). There are so many heavily hopped beers today that this just may not be the world class beer that it once was.

First whiff set the stage for the floral, vibrant, zesty, hoppy goodness. Hook this up to an oxygen tank and let me breath it in! Flavor combination of some tropical fruits, lots of citrus, and a bit of a chewiness to keep it interesting.

287,17112,Da314man,3.67,Expectation failed to become reality. I've heard over the years it has gone down hill. With a name like Hopslam I expect to be slapped in the face with hops. It was very mediocre in that department. I got 2 bottles through trades. 1 FRESH and 1 aged a year. The aged one was more pleasant to drink as a complex 10% beer. The FRESH one was just not worth what I heard they sell for upwards of $20 a six pack (or more). Too many better beers out there to waste that kind of money.,Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",Imperial IPA,98
287,17112,schris,4.76,"It had been a while since I had Hopslam - probably five or six years. Living in Chicago now, it was easily accessible, so I have sampled it many times this (2014) season. First off, I am not sure whether it's a difference in this year's batch, or whether my palate has changed, but this beer does not strike me as deserving of its name. ""Slam"" isn't the word that comes to mind - more like a big wet kiss. The nose is boozy and dripping with fruit and honey. The hops are present in the mix, but this beer is extraordinarily well-balanced, and has a sweetness to each element - nose, body, and finish - that really appeals to me.  I have had it from the bottle, from a snifter, a pint glass, a tulip glass, and I would drink it out of a paper cup if I had to. It pours a misty golden color, with a minimal head that quickly dwindles to a faint spiderweb. Smelling brings some hops, but again, a touch of sweet honey to smooth it out. Just the right amount of carbonation, and the mouthfeel is like a light syrup. It tastes magical, the Platonic ideal of a honey-brewed IPA, imperial or otherwise. But that sweet touch really distinguishes it, making it incomparable, to my mind, with some of the other great imperial pales I've had - Heady Topper, Abrasive, Dreadnaught, Arctic Panzer Wolf. Highly recommended, but drink it fresh to keep as much of the hop presence as you can - if you're out of market and thinking about trading for it in 2014, do it now.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",Imperial IPA,98

For a beer so big in numbers and its namesake, the aroma doesn't quite match the bill. It has a well balanced smell of grapefruit and some pine... But not the dankness of hops that I expected. As I further read the bottle only now do I see that the beer is brewed with honey. I wouldn't have pointed it out without reading it, but maybe that is the reason the hop smell is leveled off some.  Hopslam's taste is well rounded, but that wasn't what I was expecting. The alleged honey that I didn't really smell has come out to cut the hoppy character that I thought this beer would have.

There are many good IPAs out there. Hopslam is no doubt one of them. However, there is a lot of hype around this beer. So much so that I feel Hypeslam is an appropriate name. I don't think it justifies the $20 price tag for a six-pack. Not when you can pick up many other IPAs of just as good quality for $11. Again, Hopslam is very good. But not for the price. Maybe if I got it on tap or closer to the source i'd feel different. Bell's Two-Hearted is almost as good, half the price and readily available.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",Imperial IPA,98
287,17112,pkalix,4.39,"another awesome one today! thank you Mike! pours a golden, honey-like color with little carbonation but a beautiful creamy opaque head. I love the way this brew looks! aroma is of honey first, and actually, that is all I get... some other stuff, but not an overpowering aroma of anything. I see others remarking on the hop, but this one is stamped 12/20/2013 so maybe it's endured a bit on the long journey.... but I hear Bell will begin distributing here in SoCal (san diego) in May!!!! just need to drive to get it.... taste is honey (amazing!) with some slight hop bitterness. very easy to drink (this is 10% ?!?)... some bready malt to it at the finish.... definitely NOT west coast double imperial ipa, but very very good. again, another first for me!!!",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",Imperial IPA,98
287,17112,badmotorgrunge,5,Hello old friend! Nothing beats a fresh Hopslam! An absolute classic!,Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",Imperial IPA,98
287,17112,rawfish,4.15,"Smooth pour nets a one finger head of tight white bubbles. Amber in color with great clarity and lacing that renews with each turn of the glass. Head retention was minimal, I could have been more vigorous with the pour.  Copious amounts of bready malt and honey match the bright pine and grapefruit pith hops. RIsing amounts of stone fruit and guava add a touch of tropical complexity. Alcohol rises from the glass as well, preparing you for the slam.  Thick malt base is bready with toffee and honey soaked sweetness. Pine and dark citrus creeps out of the malt shadow evolving to a more floral quality late in the drink. Alcohol provides more of a body slam than bitterness. Finishes with a sweet honey malt with tingling pine.  Average DIPA body with appropriate carbonation. Does a good job of drying despite the quantity and sweetness of the malt. Alcohol is very present but at least the bitterness is not overdone.  Beer geek legend, glad I got to finally try this one. The craft movement really has done a number on what is needed to make a beer shine out from the pack. Hopslam is a well integrated hop, booze and malt bomb with limited outstanding qualities. This is a classic and despite craft evolution it will continue to impress through reputation and respect.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",Imperial IPA,98
287,17112,Stevotex,3.62,"Got a six pack in trade. Immediately chilled for 30 minutes as soon as I opened the box.  Poured in a pint glass after supper of baked mahi mahi.  Appearance: poured a nice thick fluffy head of 4 inches, topped off gently to reach a two finger layer of foam, fairly clear light amber. Beautiful look.  Smell: nice but subtle aroma. No particularly identifiable trait.  Taste: mildly bitter, but also sweet. Rather boozy. Sweetest bitter hoppy beer I've ever had. Most noticeably floral honey taste with a touch of caramel. Tiny bit of pine in the finish.  Mouthful: medium body. Smoothly flow over the tongue. Healthy fizz of carbonation, but actually kind of sticky.  Overall: enjoyable. Not a blockbuster. Smooth and tasty.  I'm thrilled with receiving Hop Slam in my first out of state trade.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",Imperial IPA,98
287,17112,JamieDuncan,4.42,"A friend picked this one up for me on a strong recommendation from my beer guru. Excellent appearance, not to thin, with a great head that clings. Smell is also outstanding. Not as much punch to the nose as some IPAs but other than that perfect. Very good taste but a little to much bitter hanging on for my taste. Surprised me when I looked up the ABV, did not seem near that strong, much easier to drink then that which gives it big bonus points overall. Overall an excellent beer that I will want to try again.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",Imperial IPA,98
287,17112,darthvohn,4.46,"Glass Used: Tulip  Appearance: A beautiful misty copper-orange body lurking beneath a jam-packed white foam. As you drink down this hoppy concoction layer upon layer of ringed lace is left behind. During this journey, a steady trickle of minuscule bubbles make their way to the surface.  Smell: I get the honey from the get go followed by floral aromas, stone fruits - dark plum, nectarine, a punch of citrusy-fruit hops. The malt waifs around and mingles with these scents.  Taste: Pretty close to the nose with the addition of a bigger citrus sweetness followed by more malt and the trademark hop kick to the mouth. Bitterness lingers for a while before fading.  Mouthfeel: With the aroma and flavors, I would expect this to have a bit heavier feel than it did. Nice bodied; medium at the most. Well carbonated.  Overall: I love the smell of this DIPA. Ranks up there with the best I've had. Definitely a beer all DIPA lovers need to have once in their lifetime.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",Imperial IPA,98
287,17112,theIPAman,4.25,"Received in a trade, and glad I got the chance. An excellent beer overall. For me, Not the most attractive on the nose, but not unpleasant. Honey and a little citrus. Not much bitterness which would have been nice to offset the sweetness. An original tasting beer, so I score it highly in taste for originality. The 10% alcohol is mostly masked, although sometimes I feel it tastes vaguely of a fruity cocktail. One to try.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",Imperial IPA,98
287,17112,TheSixthRing,4.02,"Bottled on date of 01/21/14  Appearance - Pours a hazy orange amber with a slight off-white finger width head. Good retention results in a fair layer of suds across the surface. Strong lacing left around the glass, with good stick.  Smell - Scent hits on citrus pith and a touch of honey backed by a strong bready aroma.  Taste - Follows the nose to a degree. Profile is similar, but drinks stronger than the nose would have you believe. Orange peel and a touch of grapefruit upfront and throughout. Underlying honey sweetness and fair bready notes. Finishes with a light pith bitterness and a faint, long lingering honey sensation.  Mouthfeel - Medium to full in body with moderate carbonation. Smooth, silky mouthfeel. 10% ABV? Hard to believe, but this buzz tells me otherwise. Utterly drinkable for such a monster brew.  Overall - Didn't quite live up to the hype for me, but it is still a hell of a beer. The flavor is pretty good, I'm just not head over heels in love with it. Too much honey, maybe. Really didn't bruise my tongue as the bottle suggested, but then again my lupulin threshold is pretty high these days. Stupid drinkable. I could probably knock back 3 of these without trying and get into trouble. Good thing it ain't from 'round these here parts!",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",Imperial IPA,98
287,17112,BuckeyeSlim,4.07,"12 oz. bottle poured into a NB snifter.  A - Beer pours a brilliant, glittering yellow-golden. A two-finger head of very tight, thick eggshell-white foam with a crown of loose bubbles falls at a moderate pace, leaving a thick ring of pocketed lace around the glass. Eventually, all that is left is a solid, thin blanket of sheen across the surface. Held to a full-spectrum light, the beer is a soft, muted sunset orange and somewhat opaque, with a thick column of bubbles rising slowly up the middle. Traces of residual sugars on the sides of the glass linger, but not enough to call them legs.  S - Fresh pine backed by ruby red grapefruit and hints of mandarin orange. Nicely toasted malts and Jolly Rancher sugars push up through the hops on the ABV, which is present without being hot. As it warms, slightly acrid floral notes appear, followed by tropical notes opening up, such as mango.  T - Hop profile shifts to a noticeably more bitter one, featuring dry floral, herbal, a bit of resin, and hints of lemon rind. Toasted malts with notes of light caramels and hints of orange sugars provide a foundation in the background and somewhat of counter-balance, but make no mistake - the hops are the featured act here. The ABV is remarkably well-hidden. Bittering hops dominate the finish.  M - Fizzy, with mouth-filling carbonation. Body is on the light side, but solid. Components are well-integrated and rich with quality. The hops really take hold in the finish, creeping into the back of the nostrils and lingering on the tongue.  O - Better balanced than an all-out hop bomb, this is a big beer that's all about celebrating a variety of nuances various hops will produce, both in the nose as well as on the palette. It's expensive, but worth it if you're a fan of big and bitter. Watch out for the ABV, though; it will sneak up on you!",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",Imperial IPA,98
287,17112,Resuin,4.49,"12 ounce bottle poured into a tulip. This was bottled on 01/28/14 so is about a month and a half since bottling.  Appearance: Pours straight amber with a half finger of sticky white head, that slowly fades to a rim around the glass.  Smell: Resin, honey, citrus, ""tropical"" hops, hint of pine, malts. Big ""dank"" quality as well. Definitely hop forward; nice and pleasant.  Taste: Really restrained for a 10% DIPA. Honey, resin, citrus, mango, pine, pineapple, malts. Nice IPA flavors blended well together. Slight alcohol on finish.  Mouth-feel: Medium carbonation with a medium body. Finish is a bit bitter with just a dash of heat.  Overall: Very drinkable for 10%. Nice hop flavors. Very well put together. I would definitely go to this one pretty often if it were in my area.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",Imperial IPA,98
287,17112,WanderingFool,4.38,"Hopslam pours a clear yellow/orange with a moderate sized creamy white head on top. The foam fades slowly leaving a thick layer of lace on the glass.  The aroma is loaded with tropical fruit, pine and some earthy hop notes. A touch of caramel malt is also present. I had an expectation of a strong hop aroma and was surprised with what I found.  Each sip of this medium to full bodied beer is creamy with moderate carbonation. The flavor begins with tropical fruits, like mango, coconut and pineapple. Sweet caramel malt lingers throughout and nicely balances the hops. It finishes moderately bitter with an earthy, grassy hop funk. Once gone the malt sweetness and tropical fruit lingers on the palate.  This 10% beer hides its abv well. It's a sipping beer, but each sip goes down quickly. The great mouthfeel and balance of hops and malt make this a great beer.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",Imperial IPA,98
287,17112,bylerteck,4.46,"Not uber fresh, bottled January. ChurchKey in DC. From notes.  A - Poured hazy dark golden with a thick off white head of two fingers. Great lace rings and a half finger retention.  S - Pungent hops, honey, dank, melon, pine. Quite nice.  T - Woah. Big pineapple core, pine, lot's of citrus, honey, bread, gripping with lot's of resin. Excellent stuff. A bit floral and some boozy, syrupy fruits come out later.  M - Good carbonation, full body, nice honey and bitterness to finish with some booze.  O/D - This is legit. Lives up to the hype for sure. So flavourful, complex, and lovely to sip. Not as easy drinking as Heady Topper, but they're different styles of DIPA. Lovely in it's own right.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",Imperial IPA,98
287,17112,mjstacker,4.37,"Poured from a bottle into a tulip shaped glass. Dated 1/10/14 so it's exactly two months old. I'm guessing most will say i need to have it fresher but this is the best i can do here in New Hampshire.  I thought it presented almost perfectly, creamy off-white 3/4 head, some lacing as i go. Hazy, dense copper color, very pretty. The smell is good but not what drives the beer, musty & funky with a hint of sweetness. The taste is bitter and hoppy, no real fruit presence. Not sure if it's the honey that slightly offsets the bitterness but it works non-the-less. Overall, this a bubbly, carbonated, hoppy happy beer. Their isn't even a slight hint that it's 10%, no boozy taste or smell. Cheers.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",Imperial IPA,98
287,17112,hops202,4.08,Poured into Dogfish spiegelau glass.  First look is a light amber color with some haze. Smells very inviting with with floral honey and a citrus mix - I am going to say clementine and tangelo. Taste is very sweet - very prevalent organic raw honey. Still very tasty. Apparently this years release is not up to par when compared to previous years but I still think it is a great beer!,Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",Imperial IPA,98
287,17112,ONovoMexicano,4.25,"On tap at 1702 in Tucson, Arizona, served in a pint glass.  I got lucky and got served a pint instead of the 10 ounce pour the menu said I'd get. The beer arrived with a finger-thick head that was chewy looking and persisted well. The liquid was golden and copper with some light carbonation, plus had a bit of a hazy look.  Quite a bit of sweetness to this beer on the nose. There's a potent sweet malt aroma, fruity and citrusy hops and a subtler, resinous piney hops.  As the aroma led me to believe, this beer was sweet, very heavy on some berry-like, strawberry flavor. On the back end, I get the more resinous, spicy and piney hops. There's a thick mouthfeel to the beer and it's not until about mid-palate that the bitterness emerges, persisting until the finish. Supposedly this beer is ten percent ABV, but I'd never guess.  I found this beer delicious, but not particularly hopped up and aggressive as I'd expect from an Imperial IPA. Still, I liked the sweetness and the berry flavor and armoa that aren't common in the style.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",Imperial IPA,98
287,17112,surfcaster,4.62,12 oz bottle in a pub glass  A: Dark orange with a 1cm head that dissipates and leaves a thick lacing on the glass--beautiful.  S: Big hoppy blast as the cap came off and it just gets better and better as it warms. Some sweetness.  T: Pungent bright citrus notes balanced by a big malt bill that keeps the hops in check enough to completely hide the 10%. Citrus and tropical fruit everywhere.  M: Tiny bit on the thick side but what you expect for something so big.  O: AAAHHH. Just as it always is. IPAs continue to get bigger and more extreme but this big boy stays the same. Annual treat--have enjoyed for years and never disappoints. Others may blast you harder or remove all your enamel but this one stays wonderfully drinkable.

287,17112,Dogjam,3.32,"Nose is medium strength, more dank spectrum than fruity. Taste is sharp hoppiness, mixed dank with some fruity notes. Honey is very present, much more than I was expecting, and I don't particularly care for the sweetness it contributes. Wanted to really like this beer, but the honey and the hop profile were both disappointing. Very smooth for a 10% ABV beer, though.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",Imperial IPA,98
287,17112,bruinhoppy,4.41,Had been looking forward to this beer for several months and was able to find it at a Whole Foods in my area. The store kept this beer in their backroom with strict limits per customer. Now I know why.  Great pour with noticeable head. Slightly hazy caramel color.  Immediate strong hops presence and followed by slightly sweet after taste.  Hints of banana and caramel.  Waited a long time for this one and was not disappointed. I should have found a way to buy more since now it appears I have to wait till next year for more.,Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",Imperial IPA,98

Honey, malt, soap, lemon, and grapefruit.  M- Perfect for the style. ABV is hidden well. Medium carbonation and body is somewhat sticky.  O- I have had this gem a many of times and this one was a little more than a month old and it was great. Fresh is best on this one.

287,17112,JohnCassillo,4.48,"Acquired 12 oz. bottle via trade; poured into tulip glass  A: Opaque copper/orange, with very little head at all; looks incredibly bright.  S: A powerful blend of citrus fruits, pine and honey that lingers throughout drinking.  T: The citrus takes a backseat to the honey and hop flavors, which come at you right up front. Can definitely taste the alcohol content, but it's still well masked by the other delicious flavors.  M: Warm and a bit heavy, with very minimal carbonation.  O: Glad I finally got to check this one out -- it's an absolutely delicious DIPA, and thoroughly delivers on its name. The price and fervor around it may seem a bit much, but sticking strictly to the beer itself, it's a well balanced drink that shows off the immense talent of the good folks at Bell's.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",Imperial IPA,98
287,17112,Wolberjs,4.02,"A - Darker amber than most IPAs, with some cloudiness. Poors with a decent head that receeds.  S - Get a malty honeyish smell, with a little dank citrusy smell in the background. Pleasant but not memorable.  T - Much more malt and sweet honey forward than most IPAs, which shouldn't be a shocker. A little hoppy bitterness on the finish. Interestingly different than other IPAs.  M - Great silky mouth feel. Very good for an IPA. And I had an abrasive just before this review which I thought had a terrific mouthfeel.  O - Not up there with the other highly rated IPAs per my personal tastes. Could be it's different enough from what I expect from the style that I'm not appreciating it enough, but I've had both plinys and kern citra, within the last month, a can of abrasive just before this review, and I'd drink all three of those repeatedly before having hopslam again. Bottle was dated 1/11, so probably by it's best by date. Stupid polar vortex delaying shipping. However this review seems to correspond with my remembrances from past times I've had it that it didn't blow me away, even the glass I had at the brewery, so I'm posting it.

287,17112,aqualung23,5,"I had to review this beer after trying it for the first time because I am not a hoppy beer/IPA guy but was blown away by this superb beer! Tried it in a sampler and promptly ordered a whole one.  The color was almost orange in hue, with a slight head that dissipated quickly. The aroma was fantastic! I could tell by the smell that I was in for a treat, because it wasn't overpowering in the typical way that very hoppy beers are to me, but instead gave amazing floral and citrus notes. Mouthfeel was substantial compared to a regular IPA, and I liked the body and slight malty sweetness, which quickly gave way to the hops. Whatever combo they use was enough to convert me, because it was intense and complex without the harshness of most beers with that much hops. I'm guessing a lot of late additions and dry hops. You'd also never guess this was 10% ABV. I never order IPAs or DIPAs, but from now on, when I see this on tap, that's probably what I'll get.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",Imperial IPA,98
287,17112,DMXLOX22,4.57,"Picked up a 12 oz. of this brew at my local establishment, Civera's in Drexel Hill, PA. This came highly recommended by fellow beer drinkers. Let's see how this matches up.  Appearance: Pours a golden, orange, hazy coloring that leaves behind a nice, frothy white foamy head that dissipates into a thin layer that follows all the way down to the last drop. Leaves behind an impressive lacing. Very nicely well done.  Smell: First noticeably are the hardcore aroma of hops. Wow, is this brew impressive in that department. Grapefruit hops are the first apparent smell. Purely citric is what makes up a majority of this beer. Pineapple, some orange, but not overpowering like some wheat beers. Good, but not overpowering. Great balance.  Taste: Pretty much everything I've hoped for and more. Comes off greatly bitter, pretty much a perfect example of an IIPA. Grapefruit, lemon zest, tropical fruit, hints of honey. The bitter malts definitely balances the sweet honey. The aftertaste brings more citrus that is delicious.  Mouthfeel: Medium to heavy body with medium carbonation. Finishes full bodied. Somewhat dry, but not overbearing.  Overall: Coming into this brew, I was given a lot of good opinions. Boy, were they right. If you're a hophead and love it that way, you won't be disappointed. The pour was very impressive, all the way to the finial sips. Citrus hops were very apparent in this brew and made itself well known from the beginning. I would definitely recommend to a friend and will definitely have again. Hope to find it soon on tap.

287,17112,KVNBGRY,4.68,"Ap - Light amber to gold. It depends on the lighting. Like all Bell's beers, it's unfiltered, yet it isn't cloudy, or hazy. It's a little bit cleaner looking than Jai Alai. The head is an off-white fluff that clings to the glass.  Ar - Grapefruit with sugar, soaked in pineapple juice. With more pineapple juice! You can almost smell the alcohol, at least get a burn of the nostrils.  T - Less pineapple than the nose would suggest. But the grapefruit covered in sugar is there. The alcohol is hidden like a gem in the taste. I wouldn't be able to tell that there is honey in it, if it weren't listed. But, since it's listed, I (think I) can taste a tiny hint of honey in the aftertaste.  M - Perfect I believe. It's not too bitter. It's not too dry. It's not too sweet. The hops and malt and honey seem to intermingle perfectly. There's the perfect amount of carbonation tingle. Sticky, medium bodied, big IPA.

287,17112,Petey_the_Quiet,4.43,"I waited, waited and waited some more for this beer to hit Florida, it had two release dates set back here in Jacksonville before finally quietly hitting shelves this past Wednesday. The hunt for this beer was a good rush from wondering ""When will it be here?,"" ""Will I be able to get my hands on a 6pack?,"" to, ""I see it down the aisle!,"" ""It's in my possession, I have it! The day is mine Trebek!"" It was alot of fun just scouting and finding this beer.  That said, from all the hype Hopslam really does have quite the reputation to live up to and it totally does and kinda doesn't.  The hype around this beer adds to the lore of drinking it; it tastes of victory and the tears of defeat for those who failed to capture this brew. However for the price now that DIPAs have really come into their own all across the market, there is definitely many more and better options at much more wallet-friendly price points. Exp: DirtWolf from Victory or Stone's Enjoy By come to mind.  Enough build-up, on to the review:  Appearance: Somewhat amber in color, good head (everyone does better with more head), but not entirely murky.  Smell: Prepare your nostrils for an onslaught of tropical storm proportions. Honey, grapefruit, orange, orange peel, piney, slight alcohol scent that is hugely apparent at the first sniff.  Taste: Now this is where the fairy tale takes a slight hit. I was looking for a punch to the mouth, a Cassius Clay knockout punch of a hoppy hit to the jaw... and while it's certainly hoppy, it's extremely well balanced, and executed with precision... it somehow falls somewhat short of what I was expecting. It's so delicious, don't get me wrong, but compared to what I was hearing prior to my first sip, it didn't quite make it there. The abundance of grapefruit, orange, piney, minimal honey flavor with a dry finish comes through in full force, it just leaves a figurative bitter taste in my mouth because of the hype/price I paid for this beer.  Mouthfeel: Again, so well balanced, very easy drinker especially considering the 10%abv. Full bodied feel, dry finish, hits all the right notes.  Overall: Such an enjoyable beer, always a welcome addition to my fridge or at my local brewery. However for the price, there are much better deals and arguably better DIPAs on the market. I believe this is an experience every craft beer nerd should have from the hunting and finding to the tasting of Hopslam, but once you've had it, there are more viable options available to you on a more regular basis. I love this beer, but I don't see me hunting it down again next year, unless it drops it's price (which is unlikely and ok.)",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",Imperial IPA,98
287,17112,glass_house,4.29,"12 oz. bottle poured into a footed Belgian tulip  Pours a medium amber-gold with orange highlights and a dense off-white head that recedes to a thin cap with nice sticky lacing. The label says ""brewed with honey"" and that's obvious with the first sniff. Orange rind, tropical fruits, and a bit of pine surround the sweet malty notes.  Good, not great texture for a DIPA in my opinion. No complaints, but I prefer something a little more oily/sticky. Very nice combination of flavors. The sweet caramel and honey is there, but definitely takes a backseat to the hops. A medley of citrus leads, with mango and pineapple along the way, and some mild resinous pine support on the back end. The balance is impressive.  Did it live up to the hype? Not quite, but it wasn't far off. Dangerously smooth for a 10% DIPA and it's tame enough that a lot of non-hopheads could enjoy it. I like this beer a lot, and would never turn one down. But it's just a notch below my favorites, and for the price, I feel there are much better values to be had.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",Imperial IPA,98
287,17112,justintcoons,4.41,"12 oz bottle poured into a snifter. 2014 Vintage.  Appearance Golden orange with a short loose head that dissipates quickly. Excellent clarity with low carbonation.  Nose Tangerine, honey, peach, navel orange, apricot, papaya, and caramel.  Taste Peach, apricot, tangerine, and papaya. Lighter notes of navel orange, pineapple, and lemon pith. Well balanced with a caramel and honey maltiness. Finishes with resinous pine sap, tangerine zest, and mango skin.  Mouthfeel Full bodied, oily, smooth, sticky, and dry.  Overall Well balanced while keeping a dry and bitter edge. Loads of hop flavor going on countered by a honey sweetness.  ---  Bottled on 1/23/13, Consumed on 1/30/13 12oz bottle poured into a snifter.  Appearance Really hazy golden orange with a tiny white head that dissipates immediately.  Nose Papaya, pineapple, tangerine, navel orange and lemon pith.  Taste Sugar coated navel oranges, tangerine, lemon pith, papaya and pineapple juice. Caramel and honey sweetness mingle with a piney bitterness. Finishes with tangerine, orange zest, lemon rind and pine sap. Resinous pine and florals linger on.  Mouthfeel Medium-full bodied, oily, slick, juicy, bitter and dry. Light-medium carbonation keeps everything crisp.  Overall Tropical/Citrus bomb! Juicy with loads of hop flavor. Excellent balance achieved with the caramel malts and honey. Incredibly easy drinking at 10%.  There have been some criticisms about this year’s different batches so I've decided to re-review. The 1/23/13 is drinking fine in my opinion, although it does seem to be lacking a little flavor. This is still an awesome beer worth seeking out.  ---  2012. Poured into a snifter.  A: Pours an orangey gold with 1 finger of head that quickly vanishes. Very low carbonation and spotty lacing. Excellent clarity.  N: The orange citrus is out of control on this one; Navel orange, tangerine and clementine. Lemon, honey sweetness and caramel all back this up nicely. Hints of pineapple and papaya are also apparent. Very aromatic.  T: Pineapple, papaya and tangerine are upfront. Mid-palate shows deliciously sweet honey, rich caramel, lemon, orange cream and clementine. The finish is much like a juicy navel orange only a lot more bitter. Pine sneaks its way in there as well. The honey persists to linger.  M: Medium-full bodied, creamy, smooth, juicy, sticky and bitter.  O: This is a must try DIPA. Drinks incredibly easy at 10% and can be extremely dangerous. Alcohol makes no appearance. Amazingly juicy with both citrus and tropical fruits. The honey adds the perfect balance to this brew. This is Bell's masterpiece.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",Imperial IPA,98

287,17112,WheelsPSU,4.25,"2014 edition. I had a 12 ounce pour ($8) at RFD in Washington DC. Time to find out if this is the real deal, or ""Hypeslam"".  The pour produced a frothy, off white head. The color is bright orange,almost amber and very clear. The lacing was thick and solid up and down the tulip glass.  The smell had every hop aroma imaginable. Loads of all kinds of tropical fruits were first followed by the pine. Very nice orange fragrance as well. Although I couldn't find the honey aroma but there was a small caramel sweetness from the malt.  So far so good.  The taste had pine and grass but the tropical fruits from the fragrance were not that juicy. I got more bitterness than sweetness. Just way too much for me. The hops dominated obviously but in a bitter tart kind of way. I again did not find the honey. And boy did I taste the full brunt of the 10% alcohol.  Mouthfeel was great. Full body, medium, and even foamy.  This beer is amazing in appearance, smell and mouthfeel.

Abundance of lacing, good looking, attention to detail was used here.  Smell - Bitter pine and orange rind. Sweet candy malt and honey quite prominent.  Taste - Rich malts with honey shining through but this is no malt bomb! Awesome fresh bitter pine and orange rind finish, I can imagine this is one of those beers that deteriorates fast with age due to the honey, so make a note of that if you want to try it, CONSUME FRESH.  Mouthfeel - Medium-bodied with good carbonation. Sticky honey lingers but I was totally digging it. Boozy but drinkable and smooth.

Alot of complaints from the local beverage distributors about the lack of Hopslam ie (1 case per delivery) of course i always have a reservation on all the hard to gets though.  This beer definetly lives up to the hype. Probably one of the most refined DIPA i have ever had. From start to finish this beer has a mouthfeel like no other. i do believe the alcohol is a little overwhelming but im attributing this to being a few weeks old and lossing a bit of its hop character.

The nose was not overpowering, it was very delicate, and the keg had been tapped 12 hours before. The mouth feel was really good, it is a beer that feels uniform.

I'm mainly smelling pine but I do detect some honey. In the flavor, I'm getting the bready malts again. Although there is a ton of hops, this beer has a really nice malt presence. The hops hit hard mid-palate on, and then the honey comes in to make the ending bitterness very pleasant. It feels smooth and goes down way too easily. Be careful with this one.. Overall- This one's a sipper! I'm not saying this because it's overwhelmingly bitter or anything; I'm saying it because: 1) it's 10%!! And 2) The flavors really came out as this beer warmed up a little. At first I thought, man this beer just isn't as good as last years version, but then I gave it a chance to warm up and man I was on board! It really is a very unique beer.

Pine and citrus, led by grapefruit and orange peel. Mango. Pineapple. A hint of alcohol. A touch a caramel malts.  Taste follows the nose. Leads with resinous pine. And as the name indicates, the hops punch you right in the mouth. Tropical takes over after a bit, with grapefruit, orange, mango, pineapple, and a squeeze of lemon juice. A slight hint of booze, but overall it is masked very well. Good deal of bitterness, which pairs nicely with the pine resin.  Medium bodied. Goes down pretty smooth for 10%. A bit sticky.

A- Pours a hazy, light bronze (i.e. golden-amber) hue with nothing more than a single finger's worth fo a white head. Minimal lacing on the glass as the beer is consumed. (4.5)  S- Dare I say, the first name that comes to mind is orange blossom honey. By no means overwheming in the aroma, ripe orange/tangerine citrus dominates [edit: the 2015 version is domintated by aromas of peach/apricot stone fruit] followed by sweet and fleshy tropical fruits in mango and papaya. Like many other DIPA's there is also a prickly, pine essence in the aroma. Quite inviting: (4.5)  T- Immediate honey-like sweetness followed by a gradual bitterness that burgeouns into a white grapefruit rind. Although simple, Hopslam's complexity exerts itself in the taste...sweet, savory and then bitter. (5.0)  M- Full bodied and truly representative of everything I adore in a DIPA. However, it is so balanced between aroma, taste and mouthfeel that I can see tossing a few of these down the human casam without much thought. As such, I caution those fortunate enough to aquire an arsenal of this beer and be sure to tread lightly.

Grassy and I can't believe I'm saying this, but horse blanket. It is mostly pine with just this weird twinge of fruitiness.  T: Nice balanced and bitter hop profile. A surprisingly good (sweet honey) aftertaste that just reminds you of what you just had. It's not one of the aggressive and grossly bitter aftertastes that you can sometimes get from highly hopped IPAs. Being a honey connoisseur, I feel that the honey is a big reason for the balance and slight sweetness of this brew. It definitely looks like honey. I get some single varietal notes here as well.  M: Slightly smooth with just a wisp of massaging effervescence.  O: I guess that I can see why so many people love this DIPA. It is a balanced DIPA, that is surprisingly not that bitter comparably.

287,17112,CHickman,4.42,"Bottling Date of 1/17/14: Pours a slightly hazy gold color with an absolutely massive foamy 2 finger off white head that was full of bubbles and faded slowly, so slowly that it looked like time stood still – this was one of the longest lasting heads I’ve ever seen, dissipating very slowly and leaving amazing sticky lacing coating the sides, rings as it goes down and a layer on top. Could be the best looking beer of all time, as this defines what an IPA could and should look like. I had 2 bottles tonight and the pour and look was fantastic after both pours.  Smells was not as hoppy as I expected, with just as much sweet malt and honey as there was fresh hop juice. Nose consists of sweet citrus hops, light grapefruit, lemon zest, piney hops, graham cracker, buttery biscuit, caramel, honey, light floral hops, toffee, mild spices and wet grass or perhaps wet hops. The hops don’t dominate, but do smell really good and fresh with great malt balance that is bready and sweet.  Taste is pretty hoppy, but again not the massive hop attack I expected based on the name and hype. It is more complex than just a hop-centric brew with like the nose had citrus hops, light grapefruit, lemon zest, and then it was followed by piney hops, graham cracker, caramel, honey, lightly toasted grains or wheat bread, orange peel, buttery biscuit, floral hops, toffee, mild spices like pepper and coriander and wet grass or wet hops. The balance was almost perfect with the hops and malts intertwined and complimenting each other, while completely hiding the 10% ABV with masterful perfection. There was not even a hint of the ABV, which is quite a feat in itself.  Mouthfeel is medium bodied and almost chewy, with a slick buttery feel, mild carbonation and only a slightly bitter aftertaste that was just as malty and bready as it was hoppy and sweet. Goes down easier than it should for such a big beer and high ABV.  Overall this was a very good beer, and it almost lived up to the hype; if not the best looking beer I’ve ever seen it’s at least in the top 3, and the drinkability for a 10% ABV beer was ridiculously smooth. I wish there was some more hop dominance in the aroma and flavor, but this was a damn good beer – pound for pound I think Two Hearted is better, but this is a fine DIPA.  2/11/2016-Scored a batch of this year's cans and I think the nose is the most impressive improvement to me, besides the looks of course which were a 5 rating again. Tasty with a massive amount of fresh hops that confuse the taste-buds with pine, grapefruit and an assorted array of floral hops. This review raised the overall score to 4.75 as the drink-ability for a 10% ABV brew was excellent again.  2/2/2017-Canned 011217, it looks great again and smells basically the same as prior years, but this flavor had some more alcohol burn to it. Very hoppy and dank with the honey and malt sweetness adding lovely complexities, this attacked my tongue and coated it with resin as it went down. Another enjoyable batch.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",Imperial IPA,98
287,17112,fmccormi,4.48,"Straight pour from a 12oz pry-off bottle to a teku glass; bottling date of January 21, 2014 printed in black ink at the bottom of the back label (“12634 PKGD 01/21/14 A”), making this bottle one month old exactly at the time of consumption. It only hit stores here maybe three days ago, so it could hardly get any fresher.  Appearance (4.25): Two fingers of off-white foam come off of the pour, dissipating at an average pace to leave a broken collar at the top, wide patches of froth all the way around the glass, and a light film on the surface of a glowing, slightly hazy, orange-hued honey-amber body. In the end, it shows excellent lacing, though the head could stick around a little long and leave more evidence after it dies down.  Smell (4.25): A beauuutiful mix of dank resin, some pine needles, pungent candied citrus peel, and then some surprisingly light-handed floral and fresh, almost sweet grassy character comes out to represent the hops profile. The malt is simple, pale, and moderately sweet, showing simple syrup, just a tiny bit of caramel, and fresh-baked bread to support the hops.  Taste (4.5): Now this is really outstanding—really great stuff. A moderately stiff bitterness comes out immediately, with some grapefruit zest tempered by the light simple syrup flavor of the malt hinted at in the nose. It transitions, though, quickly into minty, biting but not astringently resinous hops that blur the boundaries of the noticeable booze hiding behind it all. If you hold onto it, that strongly resinous character downshifts into earthy, herbal, and spicy notes that are even slightly tobacco-like, which also blend into that solid booziness. The malt, I dunno . . . the malt’s in there somewhere. It melds well with the hops, being lightly sweet and bready, flavors that fall in line behind the citrus and floral notes easily. Hopslam finishes with grapefruit peel and spicy booze to scrub everything clean.  Mouthfeel (5.0): A bit over medium-weight in feel with a slick, oily feel that washes out easily with almost astringent hop bitterness, lending the beer an incredibly dry finish for its size and thickness. The bubbles are classically Bell’s: even, moderately tingly carbonation covers all surfaces before letting the hops oils scrub everything else away cleanly. This is, in fact, perfect for the style.  Overall (4.5): It actually is that good. It’s not on the level of Heady, in my opinion, or even a couple of others I’ve had that don’t get quite so much hype (looking at you, Double Dose), but man oh man is this beer well done. One of the things I look out for in these big DIPAs is whether or not the line between booze and hops is blurred—the good ones make it hard to tell where one ends and the other begins, and this is one of them. Big, yes. Boozy, yes. Hoppy as hell and executed cleanly, absolutely yes. This is a great beer.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",Imperial IPA,98

In the past, I've thought it was the fermented honey notes, though this year I'm a tad less sure of that.  Nicely clear with a strong head for a high-ABV IPA, and there's even some lacing. Nose has malt and grass influences this year, with a hint of honey wheat. Taste has a slightly sweet malt opening with a weak tea backing note (this is the note that doesn't jive with me). Decently bitter back, turning the beer slightly bitter just as the opening was slightly sweet.

287,17112,JerzDevl2000,4.19,"Can't say that I've been excited to try a beer in a very long time. I had Bells years ago when I knew people out in Michigan but this was one of their offerings I never found when stomping out in Great Lakes Country. When I found this at Top Hops last weekend, I was a bit leery of the $20+ price for a sixer but so many people on here raved about this beer that I grabbed two (one for friends) and lugged them home through the snow/slush/ice back to Jersey. After finally giving this a go, I can say that this was overpriced by a bit but certainly good, and a welcome change from the West Coast ""hop bombs"" and the Dogfish Head beers that are rated so highly.  Nice pour to this, with a light apricot hue and head that was solid, long lasting, and faded into lacing that left its mark in rings down the side of my pint glass. Not a overtly strong aroma to this beer but what was there was grassy, floral, and slightly reminiscent of orange. The taste had all of those in it with a strong metallic undertone and a pretty oily mouthfeel. The burn and astringency were up front and then the lighter, more earthy notes came out in the back. Not a strong beer in terms of the flavor but what was here melded well together and didn't ""slam"" me like I expected.  There was enough alcohol here but it really couldn't be detected and it wasn't until I downed this that I could feel the buzz. I think I've had too many other examples of this style to fully appreciate all this had to offer, but this did go down very smoothly and wasn't like anything I had before. The hype is justified if you're a hophead and want something different from the other popular examples out there. Otherwise, this would be a go if you don't mind shelling out the extra cash for something subtly enjoyable while deviating from the norm just a bit.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",Imperial IPA,98
287,17112,alphagnome,4.02,"Appearance: Hazy, deep orange body with a finger thick beige head. Decent Lacing but no noticeable carbonation.  Aroma: Not as brutal as one might expect, but it's simple and surprisingly sweet. Nice, earthy and citrus hop bouquet laced with vibrant notes of honey and tropical fruit.  Taste: Big, bitter bite right up front. Gobs floral and pine hops are somehow balanced with sweetness from honey and pineapple, tangerine, and other tropical fruit. Boozy.  Mouthfeel: One smooth medium-bodied beer. Decent carbonation. Alcohol is very present. Dry finish.  Overall: A very good Imperial IPA that is incredibly hoppy, yet nicely balanced. Worthy of the reputation it has earned.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",Imperial IPA,98
287,17112,snaotheus,4.18,"12oz bottle poured into a pint glass at fridge temp (41 F). 12586 PKGD 01/16/14 A. Honestly thought I'd never get a chance to try this. This could be a total letdown, with the amount of time I've spent wishing I'd happen across it.  Pours slight orangey-amber in color, clear, with very little head. Poured gently but completely from the bottle. Head is small, but fades very slowly. Little active carbonation unless agitated. Smell is surprisingly bready, not super piney or flowery. Some honeysuckle, some vague bitterness. As it warms up, more bitterness seems to come out of it.  Taste very nice. Honey, flowers, citrus, softness, some citrus rind, some pine, long slow bitter finish.  Mouthfeel is thick, rich, chewy, a little sticky. Works nicely with the rest of the beer. Overall, this is a very good beer, but not mind blowing. I like it. But ignoring availability, I'd take Sucks or Double Jack over this. But I'd be very interested in a blind tasting to see how I feel without the influence of labels.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",Imperial IPA,98

Making my way to the stoop of my trailer, the main concern is to get out of these shoes. Plopping down to un-suffocate my feet, they decide to show off a few new blisters. About time for some new boots, I suppose.  Taking a moment to just relax and calibrate myself, my neighbor approaches me. “Looks like you could use a beer”, he says to me.  “You read my mind”, I eagerly reply. “What’d you got to share?”, I say.  “This here is Hopslam”, he kindly answers.  “Hopslam, huh? Never heard of it. Let me take a look. Bell’s huh? It’s been a few months since I’ve had a good, craft beer and I thoroughly enjoy their Two-Hearted Ale“.  “Well, this will make you forget all about Two-Hearted and it’s odd, fishy label“, my neighbor adds with a warming smile.  “That so huh? Well let me get two glasses from the cupboard and we’ll partake“.  “All right, sounds good“, he says in agreement.  Making my way back outside, I pour my neighbor his and then my own.  In each bubble, I can see myself. In some bubbles I am smiling, happy as a kid at Christmas time. In some I am singing, loud joyous hymns. And in others, I am just dancing, without a care in the world.  “This is gonna be a good beer”, I says to myself.  Once my nose breaks the plain of the rim, I am welcomed by the most magnificent aromas. Fresh pine from my hikes up northwest in America. A slight honey scent straight from Winnie’s home.  I start to get excited. My first sip transcends my imaginary being of myself into an altered state of another dimension. I am in a room. Yet it is a room that goes on forever, so it is not a room at all. Up above me, out of reach is a treasure chest. I can’t seem to reach it.  Out from the void, appears numerous pine cone entities. From the cracks of their cones, they are perspiring honey. They assemble themselves in the form of a ladder, forming a perfect ascension to reach the treasure chest. As I climb, each one seems to rub my back for an eternity. The feeling is not felt, for I am not of this body. I make my way upwards, dauntlessly, smiling as I reach the treasure chest. As I approach, it opens automatically.  Inside is a picture of me as a baby. My innocence. I have found what was never taken from me.

287,17112,roger617,4.04,"Had this one both on tap and bottled. Reviewing a bottle as that is what I have now and is obviously freshest in memory.  A: Slightly hazy orange and copper, pours with less than an inch of head. S: This does not present the hop bomb that I expect for both the name and hype. The forefront of aroma is indeed hoppy, but there is still a strong lingering malt aroma - which I can understand to get to 10%. T: Sweet citrus goodness, with an awesome lingering honey aftertaste. This is very unique, with a slight alcohol presence. M: Carbed very well for a 10% DIPA. Not too bitter, slightly dry aftertaste. O: I look forward to Hopslam each year, but I'm not sad when it's dried up. This is a very unique and delicious offering from Bells. In my mind, I hype it up because it is one of the callings of the end of winter. It's a delicious 10% DIPA released when we're still enjoying Stouts and Porters at the tail end of winter.

Definite presence of honey.  Taste - This is where you can appreciate the greatness of this ale. Reminded me of Bell's Two Hearted on steroids, with better balance. The honey and malt really balance the bitterness.  Mouthfeel - Perfect. The maltiness provides a slightly heavier mouthfeel than most IPAs.  Highly recommended.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",Imperial IPA,98

S: Hoppy pine, pineapple, melon, some floral and cinnamon and graham cracker notes show as it warms up. Just want to sit around smelling it all day/night.  T: Almost everything but the cinnamon and graham cracker transfers over. Honey along with other grapefruit notes really shine as well. Just a lot of balance with the flavors.  M: Super solid carbonation. Medium pushing a bit towards full bodied. Tad oily, but dries out super quick leaving you wanting more.

T: The malt and hops play nicely off one another neither overpowering the other.Not much bitterness tasted. The citrus comes out near the end with a smoothness of honey flavor.  M: Surprising smooth coats the tongue.  O: Flat out I love this beer. Recommended by the patrons at my beer distributor and it didn't disappoint top 5 beers I have had all year.

287,17112,HoppySOB,4.73,"Hands down my personal favorite. Picked up a case as soon as it came out for the season. Pricy but worth it. Pungent citrus, pine notes. Nice citrusy aroma (somewhat diminished by the honey as mentioned in an earlier review, but it does not take away from the overall experience). The addition of honey and a good amount of malt really balances the flavor, making it a very drinkable DIPA. Trying to make the case last into summer but I'm not sure it will be possible. I just can't keep my hands off this one. If you can find it...buy it!",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",Imperial IPA,98

The head was small, off white and lingers for a little bit on top of the beer, but stays around the edge the whole glass.  Honey does mute the scent of citrus and hops, but still smells wonderful  Tastes of hops and a little bit of citrus. The honey holds the flavor of the citrus back, but adds to the smoothness of the beer and helps to leave almost no bitter aftertaste that can be present with some Double IPAs.  Perfect feel in the mouth, not too heavy, but not light. Great flavor at the front and perfect balance in the aftertaste.

S- Pretty muted here for a pale, I imagine the honey did that. I am blaming problems on the honey, and giving honey recognition for making this a great beer. Small amount of hop presence with a malt like character that I think is more of the honey.  T- Some hop bite, but not much. Honey is present. This is a top 10 pale for me. Great brew.  M- Pretty viscous for a pale; the honey I think does this. My favorite mouthfeel for a pale is the creamy ones, this one is second.  O- A great brew. The honey is still present a month after.

287,17112,Boomerdawg,4.59,"Bottle dated 1/21/2014. Picked up a couple of six packs as it came off the truck this morning, promptly put it in the fridge when I got home knowing I would be unable to let it sit. Tried it for the first time last year, and was blown away by it to the point that I was able to acquire 1 1/2 total cases from my local store, which proceeded to disappear over the following 5 or 6 weeks. THis year it had a reputation to live up to. Poured it into a Piraat glass immediately after retrieving it from the fridge, which in hind sight was a mistake. This needs to sit some and warm slightly prior to drinking, initially it was lacking in smell and taste, however it became clearly evident over the course of the first bottle that a slight warming does wonders in both areas. Poured a solid two fingers that quickly disappeared leaving a slight lacing on the sides of the glass which continued as the level was drained away. Again, very little was noticed in smell until it warmed slightly. One thing immediately noticeable was an acidic taste on the back sides of the tongue. This was rapidly followed as the beer warmed with the smell of grapefruit and pine tempered apparently by the honey, so it never developed the strong tastes typically associated with the type. Alcohol was never apparent in the quantity indicated, so as I remember from the previous year, it snuck up rather rapidly by the end of the first beer. Color was a nice golden orange, somewhat on the thin side versus heavy you would expect from a high ABV beer. I do think the 2013 version was slightly better, however that should be considered from the perspective the 2013 was a first time tasting, and therefore quite a high pedestal, and I have noticed a similar trend with other releases I have tasted. All in all, this is still one of my favorites. I am definitely looking forward to my other case I should have in another week or so.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",Imperial IPA,98
287,17112,dar482,3.99,"The beer comes in a hazy deep orange amber color along with a large white head.  The aroma is extremely challenged. It almost smells like nothing when cold. I had to smell random things in my room to see if there was nothing wrong with my smelling sense. One of the most aromatically challenged hoppy beers. As it warms, there is pineapple, mango, sweet grapefruit, lots of sweet malt, resin and dankness.  The beer follows with some pineapple, grapefruit peel, then grapefruit jucy. Bitterness is throughout of older of floral, green earthy, and herbacious hops. A dominate note of the beer. Honey comes through slightly if one is looking for it, but not obvious. Then onto a caramel malt with a nice creamy mouthfeel. Alcohol pops in the middle, but The finish is of grapefruit peel, resin, pine, and again those floral and herbacious notes.  In the end, aroma is extremely blunted. Not as hop forward on the flavor as I would imagine. Quite hyped, but well crafted and one of the better double digit ABV hoppy beers.

287,17112,GrumpyBeer,3.8,Brew date on this bottle was 1.2.14 and poured it on 2.17. This beer poured copper orange with a light white froth head. The smell is a balance of sweet malt and a balanced hop. The aroma was good but it lacked that pungent citrus and pine that others have. Taste was good with sweet malt grain and hop bitterness. The booze showed thru a little much for my taste and I didn't get any citrus from the hop but more bitter resin. The bitter lingers a little long and over powers a bit. It just didn't have the body and was almost astringent. If you love a bitter leaning IPA it's your beer for sure and overall a top 10 IPA for me just not my favorite.,Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",Imperial IPA,98

S: For a IIPA less than a month old, you'd expect more hop aroma. Maybe the Abrasive, Sucks, etc of the world have spoiled me. Mostly aroma of honey, malt and booze with a tinge of C hops.  T: Big ass beer in every way, with an incredible balance. This is why the beer is so sought after. You can definitely taste the booze, but for 10% this is incredibly drinkable.  M: Like a bigger Two Hearted. Decent carbonation.  O: At one time, this was my favorite beer in the world.

287,17112,Tony_D,3.84,"A - Light orange to amber in color. Head was a nice white foam that quickly dissipated and leaves a nice lacing on the glass.  S - Good overall hop aroma but nothing to write home about. I get a bit of a pine smell but don't get much in the way of citrus such as mango or grapefruit. For a beer called hopslam I do expect more of a hop aroma.  T - Taste is good but a bit on the sweet side. The 10% alcohol is well hidden behind the generous amount of bitterness and good amount of grain.  M - Mouthfeel is spot on for the amount of alcohol. You cannot taste the alcohol and they seem to have the perfect balance of malt and hoppy bitterness.  O - Personally, I find this beer to be overrated. Is it a good IPA? Most certainly yes. Is it worth all the hype and having to wait in lines and sell your soul over? Absolutely not.

Wonderful pine, resin, and earhty hops join the show midway. All of this over an awesome backbone of caramel and, yes, honey. Slight piney/citrus, sometimes peppery, aftertaste. The flavors blend absolutely beautifully! Complexity increases as it warms. Every taste is a touch different than the one before.  M- Medium body with good carbonation. Lightly oily on the tongue.

The feel is smooth and there is minimal lingering bitterness for me. I also don't really notice any alcohol despite the ABV.

287,17112,DavidBart,4.52,"I've been eyeing this for some time on the BA top 250. The name jumps out at you so I've been eager to try this. Bell's just arrived in NY this week, but this is a hard one to get. Stores are telling me it's flying of the shelves, even with a 6 pack limit. It's name is catchy, and very accurate.  Poured a beautiful rich copper tone. Not much head but I do like me beer very cold. Little carbonation. Hoppy blast on the nose along with citrusy tones. Similar for the taste. Your usual DIPA culprits. The thing that makes this beer stand out it that it's very well smooth and balanced. I would have never pegged it for 10%. It's also not too bitter which I like. You get a nice blast of hops and a full mouthfeel. Very good beer.

Slight scent of citrus fruits. A scent of honey comes through as well.  T - Sweet flavors of tropical fruit comes through first. Some honey sweetness gives this a great contrast to the residual bitterness in the finish. This is a superior beer.  M - Given the ABV, the amount of hop resin in the beer, and that is so drinkable, I cannot see how a DIPA could be better.  O - Lives up to the billing. My palate seems to prefer Pliny a little more, but this is one of the best imperial IPA's ever made.

Decent head at first pour. Good head retention.  S: Plethora of fruits: citrus, grapefruit, papaya, etc. Mixes well with the pungent alcohol smell. A hint of honey.  T: Wow. Hops hops hops. That's what you expect with a name like hopslam, right? Citrus, pine, resin, papaya, grapefruit. The flavors just keep coming. Slight malt backbone. Honey filters in at the end while the bitterness takes a hold of the palate.  M: Really a strong point of the beer. Perfectly balanced, medium-bodied. Bitterness holds the alcohol at bay.

I must say I felt stupid for paying so much for this beer but had to try due to the hype. Man am I glad I took the leap. This beer is quite possibly the most complete and tasty IPA I have ever had. Smell is floral with hints of the honey it's brewed with. Taste is complex with the usual mango and grapefruit hop flavor. Mouthfeel is great. Slight bitterness which I like but fades quickly leaving a great aftertaste that leaves the palate wanting more. I feel guilty drinking this beer as I feel like it is liquid gold.

287,17112,YeahRightt,4.46,"Appearance - great amber color, very appetizing. Medium head that settles relatively quickly and remains on the perimeter of the glass with mild coating.  Smell - Possibly the best part of this brewski. Complex fruity smell with hints of the alcohol and a definite presence of the plentiful hops. Basically exactly how I want an IPA to smell.  Taste - Pretty amazing. Complex, robust malty start that builds to a crecendo of fruit, which is quickly followed by the hops. The hops are perfect. I'm usually not a huge fan of ""hops for the sake of hops"" beer (which, ironically, are usually easily identified by a hops pun in their name) but this beer nails it. Lives up to its hoppy claims without ruining the complex malty and fruit undertones while also deserving its name. It bears its pun name in an endearing way that I would otherwise hate in an overly hoppy beer.  Mouthfeel - Slightly oily and acidic without being abrasive. Leaves a very pleasant flavor that sticks to the tongue and leaves you wanting another sip.  Overall - My friend and i were at a local happy hour in Arlington when he got an email update about this beer being available. He gave me the lowdown on its scarce availability and how quickly it sold out. As I said before, I usually stray away from beer that ride the hops train and tack a pun about its flavor as the brew's title, but I agreed to buy a six pack with him. I have to say, I was very pleasantly surprised and pleased to say that the beer deserves its hype. Although it is undoubtedly pricey, it is a result of its limited availability, which is understandable (and likely adds to the beer's appeal).  All in all, a very pleasant drinking experience that I will definitely be interested in trying again. Bell's remains one of my favorite breweries and this beer is another great notch on their decorated belt.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",Imperial IPA,98
287,17112,BradtheGreat7,4.38,"12 oz brown bottle with typical Bell's style label and logo artwork. Dude slammed with actual hops. Not the greatest of labels, but what's inside has made this a classic design outside and in. Poured into a authentic Bell's American Pint glass.  A - golden orange with some clouded haze and light sediment. Something all that great dipa's have. Head pours pretty nice and provides a good ring of lacing and excellent stick. Just a pure and beautiful dipa. It's just glows.  S - a real plethora of hop brilliance. Citrus and grapefruit with orange, lemon,'and peach. A resinous pine character with a solid Bell's style malt backbone. It's luscious and fruity that's just bright smelling and mouth watering even before you get started.  T - follows right along with the nose with absolutely gushing fruitiness. Citrusy and tropical with orange, lemon, grapefruit, peach and mango. Pine resin takes control of the backbone with some nice alcohol warming and bitterness. A real Bells bread like malt and yeast. Some sweet candied fruit as well. Some fruity alcohol esters in the semi warming finish. Really a one of a kind top shelf double ipa.  M - big bodied and a thick texture. Splashes its gushing flavor throughout coating the entire palate. Quite drinkable for as big as it is. Can't think of anything more enjoyable.  O - its been a while since I held a hopslam in my hands, but goodness is it not an absolute dandy. Big and flavorful while pushing across flavors you just don't get from other ipa's of this size. This is one of the best ales of any kind you'll ever come across and clearly after experiencing hopslam you will understand the hype it does bring about.

287,17112,1sophrosyne1,4.41,"Two tulip glasses over 90 minutes, with and without food at the Federal TapHouse in Harrisburg, PA.  This is a glowing amber orange beauty, with a bubbly white head that's not dense or massive, but nice. That cap falls fast and leaves less lacing than one might like. The core is a touch cloudy, but still bright and inviting.  The nose is complex and changes a great deal with time in the glass. Orange rind and peach are remarkably forward, more prominent than the evergreen and tart citrus that often dominates scents in this style. There are sweet floral elements, too, clearly enhanced by the honey brewing--lavender, dandelion, and honeysuckle. Peppered toffee becomes a more potent player with warmth. Overall, though, it's somewhat surprising that the bouquet is less intricate at higher temps than with the tight binding of cold.  The taste experience begins nicely with a cleansing bitter wash, enhanced some by carbonation. Then, it goes slick with a caramel-honey phase before unleashing the core DIPA flavors of grapefruit, pine, and peach with a heavy dose of orange. The fruits give way to flowers, primarily lavender and honeysuckle, with a pepper-spice edge that converts to alcohol burn. It doesn't end quite as clean with a bitter hop finish as it might, but this is not to say that I didn't go quickly back for the next sip.  The mouthfeel is thick and nicely syrupy in balance with the bright citrus fruit, but the moderate level of carbonation is just a touch low for this beast. The bubbles needed to keep the bounce in this heavy brew aren't quite there. It does feel good on the tongue, but just doesn't dance and compel.  Overall, I'm thrilled to have tasted this beer on tap after its fresh seasonal release. It has a lot of heft and hop strength, and I really enjoy the nose with its sunny fruits that complement the color. If I'm honest, though, in some ways I think Bell doesn't do this amped up double quite as well as they craft the more accessible and compelling Two Hearts. And, I had a repeat performance with a beer born 1/21/14 three weeks afterwards--its color was already less orange, and both nose and palate had turned funky with no elemental improvements in exchange.

Smells very hoppy with nice floral aroma, and also pick up some nice citrus. Taste is citrus and hop with great heat form the alcohol. Also taste honey which I think gives is a smoother finish than some other dbl IPAs. Mouthfeel is complex with big bitter form the hop and citrus to sweetness form the honey. Beer is silky and well carbonated.  Overall, I just love this beer. The only knock for me is the price limits me to only a couple six packs a year. But on the other hand it is a treat to have and maybe I enjoy each one that much more, because I'm not buying a case.

S- pine and citrus aromas hit the nose right away. Grapefruit, orange, tangerine very pungent. I could smell this beer all day long.  T- malty sweetness upfront. A pleasent hop bitterness in the bach of the tounge. Leaves you ""chewing"". Very smooth for the abv and style of beer  M- its excately what to expexct from a beer this big. Thick viscous and bitter but smooth. Surprisingly easy drinking.  O- I'm a bjg fan of bells and I've heard all the hype about thjs beer. was reluctant to buy jt because of price and finally splurged on a six pack and it was worth every penny.

287,17112,ironchefmiyagi13,4.24,"On to the Aroma! -It has a pungent honey-glazed sweetness to it. -Hops are there, but not in the usual/predictable citrus and pine way. -Alcohol is there only at the end of the whiff, and even then it isn’t that strong. -As it opens, there is a grassiness that dries out the aroma. This is coupled with a little orange pulp that represents the citrus from the intense hopping.  On to the Flavor! -Honey absolutely drips from every ounce of this beer. It smooths out any astringency or overwhelming bitterness from the high IBUs. -Sweetness is on the cusp of being cloying, but I don’t mind it. -Once it warms, the hops and alcohol can be perceived a little more as the beer washes over your palate, but again, it does not do this in a negative way.  On to the Verdict! -I really liked this beer. The honey was an interesting touch that helped make it not just another hop bomb. Unfortunately, for the price of this beer,($20 for a 6-pack) there are other good options out there to choose from. I have bought 2 six packs so far and I find it safe to say that is all I need for a while.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",Imperial IPA,98

287,17112,Sludgeman,5,"Edit on Aug 27, 2018 - At this time I have had 185 different double IPAs. There are a number that rise the top (Pliney the Elder, Double Trouble & Devil Dancer, Enjoy By & 120 min and some from the Veil), but after some contemplation and rereading my past reviews, I have decided to make Hopslam my number one DIPA and rate is as a 5.0. Maybe one day I'll get a taste of The Younger and reevaluate. ----- Bottled on 1/21/14. Poured into a chalice. This full review updates a rating from 2013.  No way this is a 10% ABV! Well balanced. A seductive aroma. This beer is not just about the hops. 4.75  A – Pours a slightly cloudy honey color with a half-finger off-white slightly rocky head. 4.75  S – Sweetness, apricot, some grapefruit. 5.0  T – Slight sweetness in front and finishes with herbal bitterness, a good amount of malt in the middle. 4.5  MF – Good carbonation which gives the beer a fizzy/sharp start (of course accentuated by the hoppiness), medium-bodied, dry finish, no real lasting bitterness for such a highly hopped DIPA. 4.75",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",Imperial IPA,98
287,17112,eandersen,4.18,"Been looking forward to this one for quite a while. Glad I could get a pretty fresh couple of bottles...this was bottled on 1/17 today is 2/11.  A - Pours a shining dark side of gold. 1.5-2 finger white head that fades pretty quickly. Doesn't appear to be very heavily hopped.  S - I do get some tropical fruits but not a ton of citrus. For me this is pineapple and mango, maybe even a little bit of berry. Not much of the sharp pine or grapefruity aromas I was expecting. A sweet caramel malt comes through as well. It smells good but nothing mind blowing.  T - Oh there it is. The best way to put it is that this beer is full of ""sticky"" hops. Starts with a definite sweetness reminiscent of the nose. Pineapple and mango, but there is also some citrus that did not come through in the nose. Its definitely more on the sweet side of citrus, maybe an orange or tangerine, still not really that grapefruit bitterness you tend to expect from a big DIPA. Finishes sweet again, with the caramel malt presence being felt. No real trace of the ABV.  M - Nice and full, definitely sticky and lingering. It works with the flavor, but I definitely would prefer it to be at least a little dryer and more carbonated.  O - Very good beer. Is it the best DIPA in the world? No it is not. But it absolutely is world class, and somewhat unique. I will drink this whenever I have the chance.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",Imperial IPA,98
287,17112,Beldark,3.4,"Poured from a 12oz bottle packaged on 1/28/2014. My buddy and I went through a lot to get this beer (he really was really captivated by the hype) and I'm excited to try it.  A: Seemingly a bit less carbonation than expected. Had to pour with some vigor towards the end, but a good one-and-a-half-finger head developed after I finished the pour. Lacing is okay. Color is a very nice amber color - perhaps one or two SRM darker than expected - with that sort of vague opacity that looks clear until you see that everything behind the glass is a big blur.  S: Not the citrus bomb I expected, like Enjoy By or Hop Ranch - but that is not to say that this beer has no citrus aroma. The usual lemon/orange are there (no grapefruit) - but it's backed by a sort of herbal quality, too. There might be some strawberry in there. It comes together as a sort of sour-sweet aroma; not a malty sweetness, and not at all unpleasant, though not very exciting, either.  T: Uh-oh... my first reaction is that this is just a tad hot. There is no masking the ethanol here. Little malt flavor besides that, and the hop profile is frankly odd. There is a nicely balanced bubblegummy/strawberry note in there (sounds odd, but I personally get that a lot in these massively hopped DIPAs). That flows into the usual citrus, and the grapefruit is here in the palate - but also a bit of spice that has a synergistic effect with the heat, and not in a good way. There is zero west-coast piney resin to balance out this bit of spice. It just doesn't seem well-balanced to me at all. As it warms, the boozey heat comes out much quicker than it should.  M: Probably the best part of this beer. A wonderful froth when swished in the mouth due to what I now see is a perfect volume of carbonation. Definitely fits with the gravity of the beer.  O: I must conclude that this beer is hugely overrated. Every aspect of it reminds me of Enjoy By, except it's not done as well. It is by no means a bad beer, and I am of the opinion that nothing can live up to the amount of buzz behind a beer like this - I quickly learned this lesson with Pliny. I would not drive 35 minutes away on my hour-long lunch break to pay $22 for a six-pack of this again, but I would definitely buy it again if I stumbled upon it at my local store - not that that will ever happen.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",Imperial IPA,98

Honey notes on the palate with nice hop bitterness. Very dry. Some heat from the 10% ABV. Super smooth with a medium body. Nice level of carbonation.

But in my opinion it wasn't very bitter. However, awesome hop character with mixed citrus, and a whopping honey finish. I served at room temp, maybe ill need to try the next bottle a little more chilled.  Overall this hop monster was super fresh, I thought it was well balanced but I would like to see the honey finish maybe a little less over powering in the finish.

287,17112,BurgeoningBrewhead,4.75,"Ahh the famous Hopslam...finally managed to track down 8 bottles of it between two stores.  Poured into snifter; glowing, slightly hazy orange with a minimal clear white head that fades quickly into a ring of foam and some spotty foam on top. Smell...dear god. Citrus, honey sweetness, some tropical fruits such as pineapple, floral scents, and some mild vegetal/herbal qualities, but not anything earthy or dark. Smell is huge from the bottle but seems to calm down a bit once it's in the glass. Taste...a surprising amount of noticeable honey sweetness, and a ton of bitterness from the hops. Accompanied by a sort of flat, wide citrus/herbal assault that destroys everything in its path. I'll have to edit this review as my taste at the moment is somewhat muted from illness, but even now I can tell that this is simply an unassuming but very well-balanced and well-crafted beer that is insanely hoppy. Mouthfeel is relatively clean for 10%abv, not too sticky either. The bitterness takes care of any stickiness the aftertaste might have had. Overall, possibly the hoppiest beer I've had, but also still incredibly well-balanced.

N- Light citrus, lemon peel, malty but not overpowering. Slightly boozy. Notes of pine.  T- Piney up front, some citrus, each sip brings on new complex flavors as it warms up. Bitter but just enough to keep you coming back for the next sip. A little boozy at the end. Finishes with a strong hop and pine.  M- Strongest part of this beer. Smooth, tangy, leaves a thin pine coating.  O- Well rounded. Tastes different each time I have one, even in isolation. Remarkable balance for its ABV.

Once getting past that the beer is very tasty with orange and some more tropical citrus on the nose and in the taste.

287,17112,StuporJew,4.34,"Poured from the bottle into my Spieglau IPA glass... Best Christmas gift ever. Thanks Sis!  A - Pours an clover-honey orange with a one-finger head that recedes quickly, leaving behind wispy lacing on the sides of the glass. Carbonation is visible, but sluggish, but as far as looks go, I'm excited to try it.  S - Vegetal hop notes rise out of the glass, tickling the sinuses. Hints of floral aromas emerge as the beer warms, making apparent that a decent amount of honey went into this beer. Wow.  T - Floral notes such as basil, jasmine, and fresh cut grass dance across the palate. The bitterness you'd expect to be inherent in this beer takes a backseat to loads of herbs and citrus fruits, such as tangelo, mango and sweet pink grapefruit, as well as sage, lemon verbena, and WHITE basil. I could drink this beer every day, and not nail down all the nuances that lie in wait for my taste-buds.  M - Soapy, but smooth, and refreshing. The carbonation is prickly, but only helps to push the never-ending and mind-warping flavors of this beer across your tongue.  O - A damn fine effort from Bells, which I wish I could get my hands on more readily. There just aren't enough words to describe how wonderful and insanely different from other beers in this category this beer is. Anyone have a decent clone recipe for this??? I already have a culture of Bells house yeast... Anyone? Either way, if you can find this beer, grab as much as you can, go straight home, and hoard it to yourself.

287,17112,BierGiek,3.65,"1-3-14 Batch side by side with the older one. I got these both in a trade, so I'm not saying that I have the world's most refined palette here or anything, I just picked the one that had the least amount of oxidation. Poured into my badass Moonlight Brewing 12 oz. Pils glass.  A - Beautiful hazy orange color. Perfect finger bonewhite head that slowly dissipates, leaving a stubborn thin layer of foam. Lacing is perfect.  S - Here's where things are no longer perfect. Pine, citrus, tropical fruit hop aromas predominate, with a cereal sweetness. That's all fine and good; the problem is the alcohol: it's too present, and overpowers a lot of the subtle aromas I'd like in this beer.  T - Much the same as the smell: beautiful fruity hop notes, with a perfect complement of sweetness to balance it out. Same problem, though, with the alcohol. It's simply too present on the back end, and leaves for a less than optimal finish.  M - This is my biggest beef with the beer, but it's purely a matter of preference. Maybe it's a SoCal bias, but I like my IPAs and IIPAs bone dry. There is way too much body and residual sugar in this beer, to the point that the mouthfeel is almost chewy. This is precisely what I'm looking for in a stout, but not in an IPA. Once again, a lot of people clearly disagree, but that's my opinion, and I'm sticking to it.  O - I'm glad I have more, don't get me wrong, but this beer did not live up to the hype in the way that other beers have. I'll hold off final judgment until I can try it fresh at the brewery, but, until then, I gotta say that I'll stick with my local beers that nobody seems to give a shit about (I'm looking at you, Swami's!)",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",Imperial IPA,98

287,17112,brianmandell,4,"Bottle to glass. Honey color with clumped lacing. Sweet honey floral, citrus and pine aromas. Taste is sweet up front and carries huge floral and citrus hop notes. The finish is long and bitter and a bit boozy/spicy but the bitterness is never overpowering. Mouthfeel is a bit syrupy with prickly carbonation. Getting Hopslammed is reminiscent of a sweeter, amped up Jai Alai. Goes down dangerously smooth.  Updated February 2015 with the January 2015 bottling: Relative to what I remember and wrote last year, the hop flavor takes a back stage to the big honey sweetness. The floral and citrus flavors are overpowered by the sweet honey. It's still tasty but I liked when the big sweetness was balanced by the big hop flavors.

S: A cornucopia of juicy tropical fruits, natural honey, accented by spices and medium toast malts. Can't stop sniffing this.  T/M: Follows the nose with juicy fruits, honey dew melon, cantaloupe, mango, grapefruit, pineapple, tropical bubblicious, timid fresh pine needles and earthy honey drizzled granola. I get hints of corn alcohol, toasted grain and lightly smoldered pine wood. Hops are pronounced and assertive but not overly bitter. Booze is a tad harsh and warms the senses. Medium- full bodied that is sticky and gracefully carbonated. Lingers pomegranate, berries and honey. Leaves a drying film on the palate similar to sharp cheddar cheese.  O: I just love highly hopped brews that don't smack you with harsh bitterness but truly highlight and display the lush flavor of the hops. This is a masterpiece of complexity and harmony.

287,17112,utopiajane,4.12,"Pours a beautiful hazed orange amber with a creamy head of off white foam that lasts and leaves rings of lace. Nose is resonant with hops sweetness. At first it's tangerine, then a bit of grapefruit, some pine. but then the floral overcomes anything you can name and these hops become pure perfumed lightness. The malt is a breaddy scent with a bit of earthy honey. Orange blossoms. No alcohol on the nose. Taste is very sweet. The honey is thick or so it seems and the malt is rich. It has a fruitiness form the tangerine and grapefruit but it's very dry and so it's earthier rather than juicier. The malt becomes like a soft sugar cookie on the nose and on the palate. It's almost chewy. There is a faint herbal that becomes stronger as you drink. I was waiting for a biting, bitter, tongue bruising like the label said but I found the bitter to be a bit more than moderate. As I am finishing the glass the juiciness is coming forward more and the scent is becoming a bit more tropical. The alcohol is only a hint on the very back end of the swallow and in the warmth as it finishes. Mouthfeel is creamy, sticky and full-ish.

287,17112,GarthDanielson,4.69,"Poured from a bottle into a shaker pint, the beer is a bright, slightly hazed, copper-gold coloring with a slow flow of carbonation and a frothy, low profile, bright white head that clings all over the glass, and slowly settles into a filmy surface coating as you drink. Aromas of deep, rich, bitter, resinous hops all over the nose, with a subtle sweet caramel backbone, and a blend of tropical fruits that include pineapple, mango, and grapefruit. Very balanced and very rich nose. Flavors are tropical fruit forward, rich and sweet, with a blast of citrus tart and bitter to follow. That's a lot of fruit on the palate all at once, but it is perfectly balanced by the pungent, dank, piney and grassy backbone, rich in resinous characteristics. This goes from fruity to forest green in a flash. Wow. All through this, there is a subtle sweetness of caramel darting in and out. Great tasting brew. The aftertaste has some pepper spicing and stronger floral notes, but it's still all hops. Smooth and robust in mouth, leading to a smooth, clean, slightly drying finish. This is amazing.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",Imperial IPA,98
287,17112,jackass,4,"I love you Bell's but the DIPA category has caught up with you. In 2007, I had my first taste of Hopslam and it was a religious experience. But seven years have passed and while Hopslam is still a standard bearer for the category many have joined the ranks. It's a great DIPA but in my opinion no longer the Holy Grail and just last week I paid $22.00 for a six pack which I suppose isn't crazy given the going rate of so many over-priced bombers? Again, still very, very good but no longer ""I'll search for it for weeks."" I'm in the Chicagoland area and for me, that DIPA is now Three Floyd's Permanent Funeral!!!

Caps lock is on for H-O-P-S as the grapefruit flavor is only rivaled by Fresca or an actual grapefruit. It is between the eyes HOPS and it trounces other hoppy brews. It's a sweet Double IPA, but the sugars are perfect balanced to bring the hoppy character under control. One caveat: at 10% ABV, this one can topple giants. This was the second time I have tried it and it's worth $3 a bottle. Hats off to the team at Bell's.

287,17112,Kendo,4.48,"Bottled on 1/17/14, consumed on 2/6/14 - making this bottle just 20 days old. . . . This arrived in the Albany area for the first time ever just two days ago (6-pack was $18.99, nearly $21 with tax and deposit). Reviewing my 2nd bottle. . . .  A: Poured into a Piraat tulip/snifter-type glass. Hazy orange with a half-finger ivory head on top that settles to leave behind a decent ring of lace and splotchy lacing on the glass throughout.  S: Citrus - oranges and clementines come to mind - with a hint of pine.  T: Malt foundation of sugar cookie dough, then a healthy dose of hops steals the show. Citrus again, with oranges figuring predominantly along with grapefruit. Bitterness at the finish and on the palate in the aftertaste is more pine-like; as I work my way down the glass, it becomes even more bitter on the aftertaste, bringing to mind crushed pine needles and grapefruit peel. Slight alcohol warming on the back end as well, then full-fledged, noticeable warmth in the belly; makes sense for a beer that's 10% ABV. There's also a sweetness that I attribute to the honey, but that's probably just the suggestive nature of the label. And don't think this beer isn't hoppy just because I note some sweeter flavors; the more I drink this, the more I realize the bitterness is doing a number on my taste buds. What's surprising, though, is that there is still a decent balance that makes it pretty drinkable.  M: Two days ago I split a bottle with my wife and thought it was too thick and syrupy. I've changed my mind a little now that I'm drinking my own bottle. Yes, it's on the slick, syrupy side of things, with a full body. But that heft doesn't slow down the drinking at all. Carbonation is modest.  O: Not my favorite DIPA of all time, but it is well crafted and an excellent example of the style.

287,17112,JMFP,4.56,"Poured from bottle into chilled DFH pint glass. Beautiful amber/orange color. Short but fluffy white head, which quickly dissipates to this white collar. Lots of minuscule bubbles and excellent sticky lacing throughout the experience. On the nose, the initial scent is a lovely pink grapefruit with floral hints, followed by sweet papaya (must be the honey). On the palate, the flavor profile replicates yet intensifies the olfactory sensations. Nice full mouthfeel -- not chewy per se, but ample and all-encompassing. Virtually no alcohol burn. The finish is long and sweet, yet balanced -- meaning that there is enough malt and alcohol present to extend the finish, without any of the elements (the sweetness from the honey, the pine from the hops, the malt, or the burn of alcohol) overpowering or dominating the experience. Just a long, steady, well integrated finish all the way through. Hard to believe that anyone could actually plan for this to happen -- seems more like a coincidental miracle of divine artwork than anything designed by human hands. All in all, a tremendous experience. This beer is truly unique. I've certainly never had anything else quite like it.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",Imperial IPA,98
287,17112,Jackofallbrews,4.65,"Served in a Sam Adams special pint glass. The aroma on this is wonderful with a bright mandarin orange, sweetness and orange blossom honey. Deep gold color with large white persistent head. Flavor is slightly sweet up front that fades to a bitter hop-flavored middle and off-dry finish that borders of astringent. Some orange sweetness and hint of honey with a light grainy character as well. Some alcohol warming. Overall this year's is very well balanced and easy to drink, way better than I remember it.

287,17112,Omnium,4.39,"Bottle > Chimay Challice  A - Golden orange with a finger of white soapy head, nice medium lacing. S - Huge honey and orange, some peach, grape, pine, grapefruit, sweet smelling malt. T - Lots of honey and orange like the aroma, a little mango, some more classic pine and floral bitterness in the end, candy like malt. M - Strong but still smooth because of the honey, well balanced for its power, a little sticky. O - Excellent IPA, but lets be clear Its value exceeds its worth, its definitely a great IPA, but the price is too steep to justify a case of it anymore, heck even looking for a case is not worth the effort. Also, I refused to review this beer last year because of how awful the 13 batch was. It was overly bitter and abrasive, tons of alcohol power and no honey. I'm glad 14 is a return to form, but the 2012 batch will remain my favorite of all time.

287,17112,Hop-Droppen-Roll,4.7,"Color is honey gold, and I can see some gossamer of unfiltered goodness in the center of the glass. This isn't the best tasting DIPA I've had, but it might crack the top 3. The charm for me is in the honey - it's such a great and unique spin. After my first bottle, I smelled the empty glass some time later and it smelled so much of honey. It's really present in the flavor as well, it's great. I can just barely detect the alcohol on the first sip and after that it's gonzo - THAT'S what makes this beer so impressive from a technical standpoint. This is also the beer that taught me what it means for a beer to have a creamy mouthfeel - I could just let this one roll around on my tongue for days.  I'm glad this beer only comes around once a year - if it were always available, I'd either take it for granted, or spend WAY too much money on beer. Yes it's overpriced but I'm not here to review the economics of it - I'm here for the ale. Makes a fantastic occasional treat.  Do I like Abrasive more than Hopslam? Probably - but I can really only do one Abrasive at a time before it just gets to be too much for me...

287,17112,Bwj344,4.81,"A: pours a beautiful orange/ amber color with a small amount of head that disappears into a Lacey remnant.  S: the citrus of the hop makes for a very pleasant aroma. There is a sense of the honey.  N: there is a bit of hop citrusy-ness up front, but vanishes very quickly.  M: there is a slickness to the beer. It is overall medium bodied with a smooth finish.  T: the citrus hop starts, but leaves quickly. The majority of the taste is this smooth, bitter/sweet combination that is truly amazing. The finish is very smooth. Not much maltiness at all, which for me, is a huge plus. The alcohol is well hidden especially considering the hop is not as pronounced as other DIPAs.  O: this is really one of my favorite beers. Admittedly, I've not had either of the Pliney's or heady topper, but comparing to other DIPAs it's amazing!

287,17112,guityler83,4.31,"A: A finger+ head of bright white head formed with the appearance of soap bubbles, fine ones on the bottom and larger mixed sized resting on top. The beer is a woody dark orange color with great clarity, no sediment, just a consistint stream of bubbles rising to the top.  S: Big complex hop aroma with lots of depth going on. Kiwi and guava fruits with tree sap and over rippened grapefruit to name a few. A touch of honey like aroma coming through, no real malt nose detected.  T: Pungent tropical fruit bitterness, ripe with the guava, mango and grapefruit flavors. Slight oniony character towards the middle. The sweetness of the honey comes through but melds well with the fruit flavors from the hops. A big burst of more hops seems to evolve at the end with the pine and tree sap flavors. Balance is on the hop side (of course..). Maybe a hint of boozyness but overall very drinkable.  M: A moderately big body on this bad boy for an IIPA. Carbonation is middle of the road, perfect for the style. A little alcohol warming can be felt after a few sips. Relatively clean finish but some lingering hop oils cover the tongue keeping you wanting more.  O: A pungent complexly hoppy IIPA, drink it fresh and its a great beer. I don't understand the folks that age this... its an IPA those hops are going to drop out in a flash.

287,17112,MasterfulIdiot,3.63,"Poured into a Dogfish Head IPA glass.  I got a little lucky getting this one - it was delivered right as the 2014 2-inches-of-snowpocalypse was beginning, which prompted the stores to be closed the next day, and allowed me to go to work late the day after that, just as the store was opening! It was sold out only a few hours later.  Appearance is a golden honey with plenty of bubbles rising to the top. The head itself is a little disappointing though - it's just not very big (maybe because of the extra alcohol?), although it does have pretty good retention.  Aroma is, as expected, lots of hops, although I'm not quite as slammed by hops in the nose as I expected to be. I'm getting mostly grapefruity citrus, with some underlying herbal/earthy notes. There's also a little bit of honey-sweetness to the aroma piggy-backing on the faint whisp of malt sweetness. And there's also some unmistakeable alcohol.  Flavor is lots of citrusy hops on the front end, with some of the dank herbal-ness coming in mid-palate, and then a honey, resiny, malty, caramelly sweetness on the swallow before the bitter hoppy aftertaste comes in. I'm not really crazy about that caramelly sweetness that sneaks into most DIPAs, although I think I'm in the minority here.  Mouthfeel is really nice, and as expected for the style. Relatively thick, but with lots of carbonation that helps cut through some of the resin on the flavor.  Overall, I think this isn't just my cup of tea for an IPA. I think I'm just more into the ""newer hop"" IPAs that give more hop flavor without so much bitterness. I also do tend to steer clear of most beers marked DIPA to avoid that slick caramelly flavor that I don't really like. Still, this is a style with some pretty stiff competition, and there are many year-round IPAs that I would choose any day over this one. It's definitely really solid, but I have to say I'm a little disappointed.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",Imperial IPA,98
287,17112,shadetree67,4.32,Appearance: Golden amber in color with a nice 2.5 finger head. Really nice lacing. Beautiful beer.  Smell: Was expecting more from the smell. Sweet Citrus. Some alcohol.  Taste: Citrus. Some spice and honey to balance it out.  Mouth feel: Medium body and carbonation. Potent alcohol burn for the first few sips which was unpleasant but my palate adjusted quickly. There is a creamy or sticky feeling from the honey.

287,17112,magictacosinus,4.48,"Yay, some Hopslam, finally!! I must thank mattvandyk (and c64person) for making this happen. This review is of my fourth bottle overall. Poured out of a 12oz bottle into a tulip wine glass. Bottling date is ""12/20/13,"" so relatively fresh.  Looks like freshly squeezed tropical/citrus based juice, for lack of a better description - in other words, like every great world class DIPA that comes out of this country. Amber orange, with a frothy white head chock filled with big bubbles atop - this effect changes depending on the glass, and it seems it does best in wider tulip glasses designed for beer. Still, pretty cool to see a 20 proof beer showing this good of a head, as well as decent lacing and stickiness throughout. It's a bit cloudy (with the dregs) and doesn't have the same glimmer as other beers of its class, but it looks quite good.  To me, the most unique aspect of Hopslam lies in the aroma. In the same way ZD utilizes Citra hops in a truly unique manner, this beer does the same for Simcoe. This is ridiculously layered and complex - in terms of fruit, tangerines, orange rinds, and peaches flourish to their full advantage. Super floral as well, with notes of lavender, violets, as well as white pepper. Not too mineral, but showcases even the most eccentric aspects of Simcoe - cat urine (trust me, it's really all over this thing - and this is the first time I'm using such a ridiculous term in a review!) and a wet cloth-like dampness comes to mind. Pine, toffee, and caramel goodness, as well as a funky green apple flavor, and little bit of a stinging sensation from the alcohol. If it weren't for that, I'd give this a perfect score right away. Wish there were more honey, but otherwise, super phenomenal.  One thing that I feel many fail to describe about Hopslam, especially in terms of its flavor profile, is how massive of a beer this is in many ways. At first, there's a creamy, near syrupy blast of sweet caramelized sugars (mainly toffee and caramel), as well as a lingering sweetness that is no doubt caused by the addition of honey in the beer. Afterwards, this beer literally explodes with flavor in the middle of the palate, with huge notes of grapefruit, tangerines, white peaches, pine, honeysuckle - almost in the sense where you feel like eating dried flowers - lavender, clove, and a slight spiciness. Also, slightly tropical, with pineapple and guava being most predominant. Finishes with the same bittered sensation of blended under-ripe orange or grapefruit juice, as well as lingering dried palate cleansing sensation that gets you read for the next sip. The alcohol is also not too well hidden here, and it makes it a little difficult to drink in a quaffable manner. Nevertheless, it's really a unique beer unlike others I've had it's kind.  Man, this is a real treat to drink. Doesn't quite touch the same enjoyable or drinkable standard set with Two Hearted, but it's a monster of a DIPA without being too overwhelming or overblown. Lots of amazing flavor profiles make this up - any fan of these beers must seek this out at least once. I probably won't immediately get another 6-pack any time soon, but I'll welcome having some of this any time that it's offered to me.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",Imperial IPA,98
287,17112,CowsandBeer,4.48,"12oz bottle poured into a Tallgrass Brewing Cervoise style glass. Bottled on 12/27/2013. Huge thanks to Jeremy for this non KS item.  Appearance: Poured straight down the middle produced three fingers of off white, creamy head. Long head retention. Nice golden orange body with white lacing. A delicious looking IPA if I ever saw one.  Smell: Huge orange notes up front. Like smelling your hands after you peel an orange. Lots of bright, peppery, fleshy citrus notes. A deep greenness that reminds me of fresh cilantro. Finishes with a sweet, golden maltyness. The hops and the malts totally play off of each other.  Taste: All kinds of hop complexities going on here. Dense orange, grapefruit pith, and fleshy lemon notes up front followed by a piney, woody bitterness. A very nice honey graham cracker malt backbone. A lingering sticky sweet grapefruit bitterness rounds everything out.  Mouthfeel: Medium mouthfeel with lower carbonation. For being such a huge IPA the alcohol warmth is minimal and the bitterness enjoyable. Refreshing on a winter’s night.  Overall: My first taste was a little overwhelming, but once my palate adjusted ie “hop slammed” this was an immensely enjoyable DIPA. A great looking body with excellent hop complexity and a nice, sweet (but not too sweet) malty build. Puts to shame all the other boozy, cloying, bitter DIPAs out there.

287,17112,A-lex-ander,3.39,"Appearance- Pours dark golden slightly hazy with a foamy head that disappears quickly, leaves small amounts of lacing at top of glass.  Smell- Smells strongly of honey, very subtle aromas of citrus, almost as if it was a citrus flavored honey.  Taste- Strong hops upfront but mellows after a moment into a slightly citrusy slightly piney taste but not a lot of either, disappointed in the lack of honey coming through after such a strong smell, ultimately nothing special just a standard IPA.  Mouthfeel- Has a nice hop zing like many IPA's, but an unpleasant lingering film that persists long after the final sip.  Overall- Is similar to many other IPA's the two defining characteristics seem to be the very forward honey on the noes, and the unpleasant filminess.

S: This is where the beer began to disappoint. I pick up an almost vegetable-like odor, rather than the pine, citrus, or even hops I was expecting. There's also an almost formaldehyde-like scent lurking unpleasantly in the background.  T: I like the taste. If this was some sort of an American IPA, or just a regular $7.99 6 pack, I'd happily rate this higher. A nice balance of hops and fruit up front. Unfortunately, as I experience with Two-Hearted, there is the hint of a REALLY bad taste at the end. Like a really poorly balanced alcohol taste, reminding me a bit of nail polish.  M: Feels a little bit like cold milk, nothing extraordinary.  O: A relatively high quality beer. For all the hype, and a $17 price tag for 6, I was extremely disappointed. As my first review, also a little disappointed to have to disagree so drastically with a community that has led me to some outstanding beers I never would have tried otherwise. Bell's Brewery really just hasn't been in my wheelhouse.

Sure I'll still pick up a sixer of Oberon in the summer, but I'll never expend any special effort, or get my hopes up to try a Bell's beer again. Much like Two-hearted and Expedition, this is a perfectly nice beer, but a rating of 100???? Give me an effin break! I know everyone's taste is different, but I can name a dozen DIPAs off the top of my head that I find to be equal or superior to Hopslam. But, I suppose I owe it the courtesy to at least get into the specific reasons for my disappointment.  A: Fine. Nothing special, nothing inadequate. A modest head. A somewhat lighter orange cast than I would have expected from a beer rumored to be so flavorful.  S: The first sign that I was going to be disappointed. I can't think of any word to describe it but bland. A bit of citrus, a bit of pine, but nothing memorable.  T: Again, nothing distinctive. A sweetness that I suppose might have been the honey, but it tasted more like unbalanced alcohol to me. I've read reviews where people wax rhapsodic over the big, bold, punch you in the face citrus notes. Well, I guess they must have gotten all of mine.  M: A bit on the slick side. No real carbonation or sparkle. Again, the sense that there was more alcohol than they knew what to do with.  O: Meh. Again, not a bad beer by any stretch, but it doesn't come a country mile within living up to its hype. But, as mentioned above, that's been my response to most Bell's products, so maybe it's just me. For those who fight over this every year, you'll be happy to know you have one less person to compete with.  And just for the record, the bottle I just drank was packaged 1/16/14 -- or less than two weeks ago.

287,17112,Hopalong51,4.1,"Spent most of the weekend trying to secure a few six packs of this year's release of Hopslam. I let it sit in the fridge a few days before giving it a whirl. Poured a hazy golden color typical of American IPAs. Smell was terrific with the hops overtaking everything else which is expected. Front end was fantastic with the abundance of hops and bitterness. Thought the back end was a little too sweet for me but guess that is where the honey comes in. It was great to finally try this beer since I have heard about it for quite some time. I expected a lot more from this beer and that was probably due to the hassle getting ahold of it and the hype surrounding Hopslam. Overall it was a great IPA, one that I could drink regularly. It wasn't the best IPA I have tried but it was certainly one that I would order.

In my experience, the honey impartment blurred the hop intensity. Mouthfeel is spot on and the 10% is hardly noticeable. Kudos for this. That a brewer can generate this type of excitement: double kudos. For me the beer not only doesnt live up to the hype, i can probaly find two or three readily available brews at a more approachable price that deliver more. But i can also see how this appeals to many afficianados due to its subtleties and present hoppiness. Could probably be a great introductory example for those who want a big sweetish Iipa on occasion.

Taste - Starts out very grapefruit and pineapple forward, but with a nice lemon and honey flavored background. Lots of orange and some citric notes. Sweet sugars mixed with a decent malt backbone round this out.  Mouthfeel - This is what really sets this beer apart. Sweet citric hops along with lemon and honey coats the tongue.

I remember really enjoying last years batch, though I only had two bottles, one of which was not ideally fresh. Freshness is not an issue here. Bottled 1/16/2014.  A- Poured from a 12 oz. bottle into a Great Lakes snifter/tulip thing. A finger of creamy off-white head dissipates quickly. A slightly hazy golden/burnt orange color. Really nice. Spotty lacing.  S- Pretty good hop presence. Faint pine, heavier on the tropical fruits, with mostly grapefruit and orange coming through. Unmistakable malty and sweet. Almost candy-like. Maybe a little too much so, especially for an IPA. Booze is able to push its way through. Not overwhelmingly so, but it's quite obvious. Evens out as it warms. Not amazing, but not bad at all.  T- Underwhelming. It's good, but I don't think it's fantastic. Doesn't quite have the lunch I would expect. Very tame hop presence. A little too sweet for my taste. Alcohol is too evident. I expected more.  M- Well done. Medium carbonation. Medium mouthfeel. Goes down smooth enough. Light alcohol burn.  O- I like this beer, but I want to like it more. I'm not crazy about it. There are many other IPAs I would rather drink. That being said, it is good. Just didn't live up to the hype for me. Maybe it was this year's batch? Not sure...

Appearance - Pour yields a massive three-finger head of creamy parchment colored microbubbles. As it rests, a few bubbles grow and burst, leaving some pocking throughout the foam. As it begins to dissipate, it leaves pronounced, thick streamers of suds down the sides of the glass, as well as a one finger perma-head atop the body, fueled by a rush of effervescent carbonation rising up from the laser etching on the bottom of the glass. The body is a rich blend of oranges and ambers, with some lighter golden highlights in places. Slightly cloudy from the unfiltered nature of the beer. A beautiful beer in its entirety.  Smell - I'm a little surprised it's not more aromatic, but with a little bit of coaxing (and warming), I start to pick up notes of citrus and clementine, but more of a tropical presence, with notes of mango and papaya. In addition to the big fruitiness, there is a subtle earthiness, and a gentle sweetness of honey. I can't help but wonder if the delay in delivery to the KC market and passage of a month since bottling has taken a bit of the brightness off the aroma that I've read about in so many other reviews. Either way, it's quite good smelling.  Taste - Here, the citrus and tropical fruit notes are at the forefront, with orange zest, fresh mango and passion fruit, as well as a pleasant malty sweetness. The use of honey really serves to smooth out the taste and does an amazing job of mellowing the 10% abv. The aftertaste is pleasantly cloying, lingering with a creamy bitterness that doesn't overpower. Like with the aroma, there is a hint of earthiness that serves to balance the massive fruit.  Mouthfeel - Medium-bodied and heavily carbonated, with a semisweet finish that lingers on the palate. A little bit of chewiness complements the otherwise juicy characteristics of this beer. Far too easy to drink for such a strong beer.  Overall, a really wonderful take on the style that makes it quite clear why this is such a popular beer. One of the more balanced DIPAs I've had and the use of honey makes for a uniqueness that you don't get in other beers of the same style. I'll certainly make a point to see this out on a yearly basis, and I might sit on one bottle just out of curiosity to how well it holds up over time. I think it may have jumped to the front of the line for me in terms of offerings from Bell's. Just an outstanding DIPA from the Midwest that certainly represents itself well compared to the heavy-hitters from the Northeast and Southwest.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",Imperial IPA,98
287,17112,don1481,4.22,"12oz bottle poured into Mr. Pint Glass.  Appearance: Pours a beautiful amber-gold color. Lots and lots of bubbles! Small head that leaves a nice lacing on the side of the glass as it goes down.  Smell: A very definitive grapefruit smell to this one! A little bit of the Pine-sol smell to it as well. If I just bought a 6 pack of floor cleaner, someone's gonna hear about it.  Taste: Now that honey taste comes out of NOWHERE. Definitely hoppy, but not HOPPY, if you will. This is much more mellow than, say, New Glarus' IIPA. It doesn't punch me in the mouth quite as much as I was expecting, especially given that it's a double IPA like the NG. Still really nice, very well balanced.  Mouthfeel: Smoove. Very smoove. Crisp. Clean. Scores great points here.  Overall: If this turns out to be Pine-sol... it was definitely a very delicious beverage. I'm glad I got a 6 pack of this stuff. Although... it is just too drinkable...!",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",Imperial IPA,98

There is a minty note there as well after warming.  T: Noticeable but not excessive bitterness and sweetness. Very nicely integrated. Some grassiness when it warms.

287,17112,Joey-bags1990,4.68,"A- Light to medium copper tone, similar to the color of cream soda. 1/4 inch head after it settles. Definite retention of foam on the side of the glass. Medium carbonation appearance based on the amount of bubbles ascending from the bottom of the glass. S-Obvious strong scent of floral-like hops that comes expected from a double IPA. Also warm malt scent with hints of sweetness from the honey. T-Outstanding IPA taste. Hops are plentiful for sure, and has a great bitterness to it. The hops have a very fruity/grapefruit taste. Smooth warming finish of malts and honey that acts as a smoothing finish to the hops bitterness. F-Medium feel on the palate. Not overly bitter after tastes because of the smooth finish provided by they added honey. O- World class beer by all means. The best IPA I have personally ever had and I feel it's only appropriate for it to be a limited release each year. I highly recommend to all IPA drinkers.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",Imperial IPA,98

287,17112,James773,4.24,"Can't really see the color too well through the brown bottle but it looks clear and golden. Smells like pine and citrus but quite sweet. First impression taste-wise is an abundance of resinous hops, but it quickly becomes sweet (not overly so) as the honey flavors emerge in the backend. It's a flavor combination that works really well, but six-packs are pretty pricey and hard to find from what I understand so I don't think I'll be enjoying this one as much as I'd like to.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",Imperial IPA,98

S - Orange, grapefruit, citrus, and a sweetness.  T - Palate wrecker...lots of hoppiness in mainly citrus and piney notes. A hint of malt in the background gives it a touch of sweetness. The alcohol is noticeable.  M - Very bitter on the sides of the tongue. Finishes dry, carbonation tickles the tongue.  O - This is a very good DIPA. It's a hop bomb (or slam) that finishes very bitter and dry.

287,17112,dlukask,4.71,"This might be the best IPA I've ever personally tasted.  I really love the piney tasting IPA, and this, to me, was like sucking on a green pine cone – in an amazing way. It's super hoppy, but the bitterness is balanced by it's freshness.  Has a great mouthfeel, as it should being so nutrient rich in ABVs.

Bready malt in the background. A little bit of grainy feel that makes it less good than I expected. T - 3.75 - Same problems as the smell plus it's boozy. The honey might be drying this out and increasing the ABV too much. It may benefit from honey malt and certain crystal malts used rather than just plain old honey. Garlic, earth, grapefruit, pine, booze, honey, etc. M - 3.75 - Light-medium. Alc present. Aftertaste is sweet and bitter, but not well defined.

287,17112,villainousfoil,4.64,"Great beer. Best after or during a good meal, at 10% take your time and you will get a warm relaxing buzz. I'm not a beer expert by any means, so excuse any misuse of jargon, but it seems like the honey balances out the bitter hop flavor. Properly poured it will have a good head so when you take your first drink make sure to get some on your upper lip, especially if you have a mustache; you will get to taste this amazing nectar all night long.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",Imperial IPA,98
287,17112,eclipse54,3.97,"Pours a slightly hazy copper/gold color with about a finger’s breadth of pure white, bubbly head. The bubbles linger for a few minutes before settling to confluent patches of large bubbles around the surface of the liquid. Scattered strands of lacing decorate the glass. The aroma is of grapefruit/orange citrus, honey, cane sugar, wet earth, a bit of lemongrass, and subtle white pepper. It tastes of various citruses - primarily grapefruit and lemon rind - alongside a predominant honey flavor. Cane sugar, grass, and some earthen/peppery hops round it out. Mouthfeel is lively, but slightly more viscous than many other DIPAs, perhaps due to the honey. It has a wet, resinous finish as the bitter hops linger; a bit of warming alcohol is noticeable right on the end.. Overall, the honey adds a unique dimension to this big beer that hides its alcohol very well. The honey isn't entirely to my liking, but it is a very well executed beer none-the-less.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",Imperial IPA,98

287,17112,Jho3325,4.43,"Pours a nice golden with a good head and strong lacing.  Smell of grapefruit and citrus hops.  Taste is citrusy, but the beauty of this beer is the sweetness from the honey that balances the hops. This is not a palate burner DIPA, but the sweetness keeps you drinking this beer easily and dangerously since I got no hint of its 10% ABV.  This is a winner worth it's steep price tag.

287,17112,Beric,4.6,"Serving: On tap, 12oz in a snifter Served: 20 Jan 2014  Appearance: A hazy burnt orange color with a thin layer of white bubbles. Good lacing on the sides of the glass.  Smell: Huge hop nose, but not as abrasive as some other DIPAS, a theme that will reappear multiple times in this review. Some sweet maltiness evident in the nose, but mostly hops.  Taste: A pure, thick hoppy flavor with notes of grapefruit and pine. Very ""juicy"" hop notes overlaid on a sweet malt. Tastes somewhat like an imperial Two Hearted, which also has an excellent, sweet maltiness. Semi-sweet finish doesn't coat your tongue in syrupy sweetness, but also doesn't dry the mouth out.  Mouthfeel: Deceptively thick and creamy for an DIPA. Really compliments the rest of the beer well.  Overall: This isn't an abrasive, blow your face off DIPA. I had this one at a Bell's event at a bar in town and the representative made sure to emphasize that this isn't a West Coast style IPA. It's a lot like Two Hearted- an incredible, unique IPA that has different characteristics than their west coast cousins. This one is sweeter and thicker than West Coast DIPAs, which really tones down the hoppiness and makes it compliment the beer more than give it a shocking, abrasive edge. Expect something slightly different than you expect when you see DIPA and you'll be pleased with this brew. Expect something like Stone Enjoy By, and you're going to be disappointed when you aren't burping up hops every half hour for the next 3 hours.

287,17112,SeanBond,4.24,"So finally, after a year of waiting, I finally have a 6-pack of the much-hyped Hopslam at my house. I love DIPAs, so I had high hopes for this.  Bell's says this was brewed with honey, and you can tell. The beer starts out bitter, but the honey makes the finish nice and smooth (and not bitter at all). The beer is lightly piney all the way through, pretty tasty, although not the world-conqueror I was hoping for.  Honestly, if you like big, bold hops, this probably isn't your beer. It's great for people who don't like a really bitter finish (myself included), but if you're looking for a huge hoppy taste, there are a lot of better choices. Hopslam is excellent because of how smooth it goes down (making it essentially the polar opposite of Bell's The Oracle).  Glad I got to try this, but for the $16.99 I paid for a 6-pack, there are definitely a bunch of options I'd prefer. Still, a unique effort by Bell's.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",Imperial IPA,98

Mouth-feel Medium body, super sticky, the honey is a much appreciated addition to this earthy double IPA. Slight alcohol warming sensation after each sip.  Overall I dig! Not your average double IPA. This steers clear of the citrus bombs that reign supreme in the Double IPA world and delivers an earthy, sweet, bitter IPA that will rock your socks off. Have 4 of theses and call me in the morning.

Smell - Very aromatic citrus, with different hop varieties. Grapefruit, clementine, pineapple that is baked. Not a ton of roasted notes from malts, but you do get some sweetness from the honey. The alcohol hits the nose right at the beginning.  Taste - Citrus slightly on the grapefruit side, but you also get sweet citrus navel orange, clementine, almost a beaked pineapple flavor. More roasted notes in the taste than the smell. Roastiness comes through sweet reminds me of the rich sweet but not overwhelming flavor of caramel. Resinous flavor as well that has both woody and piny characteristics. Alcohol does not overwhelm.  Mouthfeel - Medium carbonation, full bodied. Coats the palate leaving a nice after taste. Alcohol warms the tongue.  Overall - Great beer. This is my second time buying hopslam and I only wish id gotten more.

S - A hop snap of citrus and pine, with floral notes. Strong, but not unpleasant, and very clean.  T - This is a special beer. The powerful hop is well balanced with malts and honey, a slight sweetness, but the explosion of fruit, then pine, then a subtle bitter close tells you what is boss, as if the beer's name hadn't already.

At long last I have acquired a six pack of Bell's Hopslam, after missing out in the past.  Poured into a clear balloon snifter.  A - Pours a nice bright burnt orange colored body with some semi-clarity and one and a half fingers of thick soapy off-white head. Scattered lacing. Looks very nice.  S - Smell is of fresh and floral hops. Grapefruit, mango, oranges. Some honeyed biscuit malts buried in the back end. A touch soapy. Smells fresh and juicy.  T - Taste is especially delicious. Smooth, creamy, juicy, and best of all, fresh tasting. The thing has the drinkability of a glass of fresh squeezed orange juice. Grapefruit, orange / tangerine, pine, honeyed biscuit malts.  M - Feel is smooth, creamy, and juicy. Bitter and resinous on the palate for a good long while, but never does it become too much. Medium-light bodied with perfect carbonation.  Overall, a wonderful IPA, especially when you can catch it fresh, so there is no wonder that this beer is as highly renowned as it is. The honey adds a nice distinctive touch to an already delicious beer. The high 10.00% abv isn't noticeable in the least. One of the better DIPA's I've had in a long time.

An ample amount of pine and grapefruit. Super bitter and dry with little to no balance. But this is the intention of the ale. Balance is not a need, necessity, or a want from an ale like this.

Aggressive pour yields a solid 1 inch head that lingers, and lingers... Slowly dissipates leaving excellent lacing sticky to the glass. The color? This is what this style should be, a hazy orange gold tint. Big up front hop kick in the nose with solid boozy smell behind. Exactly what I wanted. Taste? I can only imagine what this is like on tap if it's this delicious out of the bottle!! Very similar to Doom, without Doom's overpowering alcohol kick. Loads of piney bitter hops, held in check by the honey to balance them out. For a ten percenter, this is a very drinkable beer! The sweetness of the honey is the perfect balance to the hops. This beer takes the sting out of a cold bitter Michigan winter night. Damn good beer!",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",Imperial IPA,98
287,17112,TheBrewo,4.4,"After living in Michigan for a year now, we FINALLY have our hands on this. It has been a top “want” for a while now, oh yes. So we crack a pair (12/27/13 PKGD, so you KNOW that bad boy is fresh), pouring into our oversized tasting snifters. It appears the color of burning rust. It puts up a solid two finger head of eggnog colored cream that slowly sloshes around the glass and up its sides. This holds well, depositing beads and pinheads of lacing in no real organized or uniform fashion. A chill haze cuts clarity, but no sediment is noted once this dissipates. Carbonation appears to be light. The aroma sings of the fruitiest, most tropical and nectar-laden juicy hops one can find, with sugary twangs of bubblegum esters, clean honey, herbal mint tea, fleshy kiwi, mango, pineapple, pomegranate and guava fruitiness, Muscat grape, lemon rind, and dried apricots. The malt bill is fresh with notes of pales and caramels, otherwise bolstered by singed rye graininess, grappa booziness grape stem, distant earthen mineral, black pepper, pine bitters, and phenolic clove. Our first impression does not necessarily match the line on the back of the bottle, but we do feel that with just a tiny flick in one direction, the bitterness, which is paradoxically held at bay by the sweeter side of the hops, could tumble and roar to the tune of a west coast beat. As we sip, the taste opens up with bitter grapefruity and floral hops, resiny pine, foam packing peanuts and cardboard, splashes of vodka booziness, black pepper and cumin spiciness, raw honey and honeycomb sweetness, chlorine bite and lemony cleanser bite. The middle peaks with lemon zest and wet juiciness, cherry flesh and skin astringency, further bittering thickness of piney, herbal, and soapy hops, potpourri florals, bubblegum esters, cloven and lightly plastic phenols, cornmeal, clean pale malts, and white sugar sweetness. The end washes with dank herbal, floral, and nectary hops, with rumbles of booze and high potency vanilla extract, cocoa butter chemical bite, water soaked rose petals, lavender wax, roasty caramel and sweaty pale malts, apricot, tonic water bitterness, and cottoned soapiness. The aftertaste breathes of orange bitters and blossoms, vanilla bean, steely vegetal greens, mineral, pine sap, green grassiness, mushy graphite, peppered boozy spice, soapy and citric hops, heavily bittered plastic phenols, malted toast, and tiger balm. The body is solidly medium with full fringes, while carbonation is medium to high. Each sip gives nice slurp and smack, with comparably nice froth, cream, and foam. Finishing pop is crisp and sticky. The mouth is left coated, lightly tannic, and astringently chalked along the hard palate and tongue. The abv is appropriate, and the beer drinks nicely, but is slowed due to its warming and thicker qualities.  Overall, the best thing about this beer was its aroma. From the moment you crack that top, the stickiest, sweetest, fruitiest, most tropicaliest hops bombard your senses. Here the hops truly overpower the grain, allowing it to fade into the back and form a true base. Although this isn’t barrel aged, we felt that there was significant inclusion of vanilla bean extract, much in the same sense that Founders’ Doom presented with. It adds a certain softness to the inherent bitter flavors held within. Speaking of bitters, which is a huge advertising point of this beer, we felt that that aspect of it was rather dimmed following our expectations. The hops were gloriously present and diverse, but just weren’t to that palate crinkling extreme that many DIPAs search for. This restraint went appreciated, and ultimately lent towards the final balance. This is a fantastic beer, and although we wouldn’t tag it in the same individualized company as Heady and the Hill Farmstead one-offs, it takes a high rank in the order of the regular fridge sippers.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",Imperial IPA,98

Fairly sweet.  T - So awesome. Just like the smell. Resinous pine upfront followed by sweet tropical fruits and a nice sweet caramel malt backbone. So well balanced.  M - Medium bodied with high carbonation. Very smooth and easy drinking. Slight alcohol burn in the finish.  O - One of the best beers I've ever had. Extremely well balanced and drinkable.

287,17112,BrainDad,4.8,"On tap at Logan's Alley in GR. Statewide barrel release 2014. Too bad America can't be here too.  Everything about this beer is an IPA lovers dream. Alcohol taste a bit over the top. Looks beautiful and feels good rolling over the palate and down the gullet. A perfect balance between aroma and taste, which is much more than I can say about most others. Not too syrupy, not too ""vacant"".",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",Imperial IPA,98
287,17112,MrPlayboy,4.9,"The original and still the best hoppy beer available. A beautiful orange-golden appearance with hops, citrus, honey, and pine on the nose.

S - wonderful floral aroma as well as a decent amount of citrus  T - spot on, hops balance seemed better this year than last. Nearly perfect! Hopslam has jumped back up to one of my favorites.  M- carbonation was good and malt balance was perfect. This beer hides it's abv well.  O - a hop lovers ideal brew. not overpowering, just right there on the nose and palate. A definite must try.

Not clear but mostly sunny, no clouds around here today.  S- Plenty of citrusy/piney notes, balanced with sweet honey.  T- This beer is brewed hop forward and I like it. A citrusy grapefruit hop blast is followed with a great equalizing sweet honey flavor. At the right time all the flavors balance out perfectly.  M- Sits well, goes down the same. The heat cleverly remains in the background until needed at the end. Good feeling aftertaste.  O- Bells has surely raised the bar with this beer. Very well put together and balanced with wonderful flavors. Always looking forward to its release.

287,17112,KingSlayer,4.56,"12 oz bottle poured into a wine multipurpose chalice. Poured an amber semi translucent liquid with orangey tints, formed a half finger offwhite head with medium to little retention, little belgian lacing left behind. Nose composed of a sweet mild boozyness, orange rind, other citrusy components, honey and beewax, flowers, lemongrass and similar herbaceous, horseblanket, woody, hint of pineapple. Taste- Really well balanced, not as bitter as i expected, malt sweetness and hop biterness are round, citric and herbaceous components are less intense a bit of guava is picked, and woody horseblanket comes forward in the aftertaste. Mouthfeel- medium body, non sticky, alcohol well hidden, lightly carbonated. back and side of the tongue tings with biterness, mild heat in throat. Overall a very tasty and rounded IIPA, persistent rich aftertaste. IBUs and alcohol not apparent.

287,17112,mechamifune,4.27,"Poured into a delirium tulip. Pours a nice healthy copper color with a light creamy head. Slight sense of carbonation. Strong smell of hops, honey, passion fruit (maybe).  Taste is obviously sweet but with an assault of hops on the initial tasting. This subdues slightly as you get through the glass. Nice creamy mouthfeel that coincides nicely with the sweetness.  Very drinkable as there is almost no sense of alcohol (i'd imagine the sweetness goes a long way towards accomplishing this). For a 10%er, its almost dangerous how drinkable this is.  In total though, this beer has kind of become muddled in its place since I initally had it over 4 years ago. It's a good DIPA for sure, and at least somewhat distinct, but the pure volume of great (and much easier to get) IPA's currently in the marketplace make its place in the upper echelon of the style somewhat tenuous. To be fair though, if you come across it, give it a shot. I just wouldn't go truck chasing for it.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",Imperial IPA,98

287,17112,TheosTheories,5,"This was bottled in January 2013.  A- nice orange color, small white head that doesn't last long. Just beautiful orange, what a beer should look like.  S- even with the age on it the hops are still forward. Citrus and pine, fresh orange peel, a little honey at the end, but pretty much all hops, great!  T- follows the nose, big hops, big orange peel flavor, citrus and piney notes, big grapefruit, not as bitter as it was when I had it fresh but still bitter enough, this beer is just as good with a little age on it. The honey is there but really doesn't do too much besides create a great balance with the strong hops.  M- very smooth, medium body on it, goes down nice.  O- just a great brew, you really can't do any better. This is a two hearted ale (one of my favorite beers) on steroids.

287,17112,UnionJack31,4.94,A - Rich orange-gold with minimal head.  S - Strong pine but citrus comes through as well.  T - There is a stronger citrus flavor that is able to hide the higher alcohol content. The overall balance is incredible.  M - Amazing smoothness that makes it so easy to drink.

Don't get me wrong you know it's a DBL IPA with those hop flavors but that honey just smooths things out so well.  Probably the best beer to hide alcohol I have ever tasted, I mean you could slip this to someone as pale ale and most would drink it not thinking about a 10% beer.  Phenomenal beer for sure.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",Imperial IPA,98
287,17112,BullyBrewing,4.07,"A: A nice true Orange with a mild/moderate head.  S: Citrus up front first and foremost! Floral a close second. I was hoping to get a hint of honey in the aroma, but alas the hops drown it out imo.  T: Suprisingly balanced for what it is. Everything plays very well together to create a great blended flavor profile. Hops truely hide the high abv, and the hops are rounded out nicely by the honey. I really expected to be overpowered by the hops but this is a very drinkable beer.  O: Here is where I differ from the masses. Maybe I was to hyped up about this beer, but it just did not knock my socks off like everyone said it would. Was it tastey... yes, was it the greatest beer ever like everyone led me to think... no. Very well crafted beer overall.

T-Again hops dominate at first as expected, followed by citrus and honey flavors.  M- Oily and hop resin heavy. You won't be putting these down too quickly.  O- This is a very good IIPA.

I have had it since 2010, every year but I must say that if you cellar it for a year, the hopiness calms down and the semi-sweet overtones of the beer are more dominant.

Smell- A symphony of competing hop flavors, fruits, pines, bitters, and a sweet malt backbone.  Taste- The hop flavor goes in a rainbow of sweet to bitter, and then the malt caramel sweetness rounds the rollercoaster to an end.  Mouthfeel- Thick and oily, but doesn't linger longer than it should. Carbonation can dissipate quickly.  Overall- This is definitely a thinking beer. A bomb of flavor.

There is definitely traces of honey on this bad boy! A sharp citrus hits on the end.  T: A symphony of hops. Pineapple, a little mango, almost a tart apple quality. The end is backloaded with piney, resinous hops. Glorious! there is grapefruit and citrus and lemon peel. As if all these tropical fruits and pine needles were skewered with honey. Nice and sweet malts with hints of caramel and honeycomb. The finish is dry, clean and quick. It hits you and leaves.  M: Medium bodied. Thick without feeling heavy. A small trace of carbonation. There is no alcohol present in this AT ALL.  O: One of my all time favorite beers. There is so much going on with a huge hope character. its on the sweeter side but it works so well.

Floral with the sweet smell of honey and hops. The taste did a great job of masking the alcohol content.  I was never a big IPA fan but this beer completely changed that. Went out the next morning and purchased two additional six-packs.

Taste- Slightly sweet pineapple-grapefruit juice, raw honey, orange zest and grass.  Feel- Oily and creamy to start with a slightly bitter finish.

287,17112,jjboesen,4.86,"Ah! Hopslam. Just saying the word makes my mouth happy. We all know about this elusive bastard and the kerfluffle surrounding it. Let's start by looking at the label, which seems to depict some poor schnook being crushed by a giant hop plant. Yeah, I get it, it's heavy shit and such. This is a visual that brings to mind domination over the individual, who is overwhelmed by something more powerful than himself.  But Hopslam cannot be limited to visual; this is about the sensual aspect of human interaction. It represents sublimity as something tangible: a glass of delicious beer that serves as the journey into ""something more powerful"" than yourself.  The journey begins at first pour, as the golden elixir silently slips into the glass; there is a cloudy body of amber topped by a silky beige crown of foam - sleek and shiny. Watch it slowly sink; look at the trail of gummy lacing lathering the side of the glass.  Take a sniff: the nose is suddenly overwhelmed in a complex mish-mash of pineapple, peach and mango, while the palate receives an initial plastering of malty honey underlayed with some creamy hops and eventually replaced by a friendly blanket of mild hops - minute pinpricks of pine. The mouthfeel is wondrous: honey cream that provides a milky creaminess to belie the heavy alcohol content (10%)  Highly quaffable is this blasted Hopslam, It breaks all the rules and shouts a heavy beer is not a heavy beer; it is sweet and easy! Drink me Beer Whore. (Sorry, got carried away.) In anu case, the ""schnook"" on the label is me as I truly loved this beer, one that has earned its reputation.

287,17112,Hendry,4.35,"Pours a semi clear amber/orange hue, nice soapy 1 finger white head.  Not the aroma I was expecting. With a name like HOPSLAM, I was expecting something in the area of Heady Topper. There was a presence of hops surrounded by sweetness, either from the mal, the honey or a combination of both.Bottle was 3+ months old, wondering if that played a part in the lack of hop forwardness.  Flavors are exceptionally balanced between hops and a sweetness that does not overpower. There is a slight grapefruit peel vibe amongst the malt and honey sweetness, yet all flavors blend amazingly well.For a 10% abv, this is crazy drinkable!  Mouthfeel is medium, on the rich side of sweetness without overdoing it.  Amazing drinkability in a high abv IIPA makes for good times.

Mouthfeel: perfect amount of carbonation, not too full  Overall: My favorite beer of all time, narrowly edging Bells other staple, Two-Hearted.

I stock up on this every year to drink through spring and take camping in the summer. It's a great way to wind down an afternoon and set up an evening of big beers. We've put it up against Pliny's (fresh on fresh), and Hopslam wins out every time, hands down.  I load the basement fridge with a couple cases of this every year, and it lasts into summer.

Tons of effervescence flowing up the glass. Nice dense head retention and sticky, thorough lacing.  S - Super hop forward. Crisp pine, mango, pineapple, grapefruit and peach. Fairly fruity with a tropical twang to it. Subtle caramel malt, just enough. Nice mix of sweet and bitter in the hop bouquet.  T - Fantastic. A delicate balance of palate-intensive hop assault, but the bittering character is brought back just enough. And its tasty as hell. Pineapple, mango, green apple, and grapefruit giving it an excellent tropical fruit hop barrage upfront. Floral notes abound as well, with a crisp and zesty citric quality. Minimal malt in the profile. Overall, it feels very fresh, balanced and drinkable. Holy hell this is a great beer.  M - Medium bodied, but lots of lively but fine bubbles of carbonation. Smooth, but a little warm and oily, as DIPAs tend to be. Sticky on the lips too!  D - This is a benchmark for the style of the 'double' IPA. Most in the style are merely IBU bombs, with an obnoxious palate wrecking bitterness and lack of any real flavor. This isn't. Reminds me of a domestic favorite of mine, Red Racer IPA, in that it has tons and tons of flavor but is still immensely drinkable. Absolutely delicious DIPA, and that's coming from a guy who doesn't really care for the style.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",Imperial IPA,98
287,17112,rand,4.07,"From 12 oz bottle poured into nonic tulip glass  A: Orange-apricot in color, forms a nice, frothy 2-inch head that leaves patchy lacing around the glass. Brew isn't as opaque as I'd guess.  S: Citrusy hop oil meets lots of honey-sweet notes and booze. Essence of grapefruit all over the place.  T: Flavors really arc as they pass over your palate. Citrusy and somewhat refreshing at first. Strong, sticky honey-malts roll through as the hop notes turn oily and bitter. Lots of booze. Grapefruit rind lingers throughout the sip and beyond, along with warming alcohol. Finishes long and bitter-sweet.  M: Really chewy and viscous, almost syrupy. Carbonation is there but it's almost overwhelmed by the gunky consistency.  Definitely accomplishes what it sets out to do - pound your palate with hops, and hop essence. It's not as refreshing as its West Coast brethren but I like the unique take on the style.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",Imperial IPA,98

T: Follows nose witha bit of pepper on the finish. This one's a hophead's paradise.  M: Light to medium. Dry finish.  O: If I were a hophead, I would buy this by the case.

S- Hops forward with apple, pear and citrus overtones. Sweet.  T- Very sweet, hops follow nose but not as much hop bite as is expected from the nose. Almost too sweet and not bitter enough to be a pale.  M- medium heavy bodied, almost syrupy, yet very sweet. Thick.  O- Very much so too sweet for my palate as I like my IPA's well balanced and drier. My tap review came from a shit hole that still had hopslam on tap 3 weeks after it hit the market in Minnesota (Casper's in Eagan, MN) gottah love it. It comes across as a little too syrupy from the bottle and lingers too long which can be good or bad. All in all a great ale but Surly Abrasive wins.

Aroma is nice, but not as hoppy as I imagine a fresher bottle would be. More to the malty side. Sweet, kinda hoppy aroma.  Same with the flavor. The beer is plenty bitter, but not as much hoppy flavor as I'm assuming a fresher bottle would have.  Medium bodied. Carbonation feels harsh when coupled with the bitterness. Dry, everlasting finish.  After looking for a while, I finally found a liquor store with a few bottles of this beer left in stock, so I bought one. This bottle is nearly three months old, I'm sure the hoppy flavor and aroma I was looking for was much more prominent two months ago.

287,17112,WiscoBrewsco,4.91,"Appearance - Golden in color, medium thick head that doesn't linger, highly carbonated  Smell - Massive citrus hops, all types of hop smells really but citrus and floral dominate. A touch a sweet sugar smell as well from the honey  Taste - Wow! This beer is a force to be reckoned with. The massive hop flavor just wrecks the palate and dominates the whole mouth filling it with pineapple and grapefruit flavors. Then it is as if the beer reaches in and grabs your tongue and paints it with a layer of honey. The hops then wash down the back of your throat leaving a bitter finish but then the citrus works its way back up into your mouth and just sits waiting for you to take the next sip and start the ride all over again  Mouthfeel - The hop presence and carbonation and honey make this a very mouth coating DIPA. It almost sticks in your mouth and on your tongue anywhere it touches. Thick and rich are understatements.  Overall - This is without a doubt the best DIPA or IPA I have ever had. Even better than Pliny and Double Jack. It may not have the hop bill of Pliny or the intricacies of Double Jack, but the overall balance and experience makes it superior to them both and the use of honey in this beer is simply masterful. I could drink this beer every day and still not have enough. I don't know exactly what was in the Ambrosia that the Greek Gods were drinking, but I imagine it was something like this.

In all regards this Kalamazoo product comes through.  Tasted fresh even though it was brewed about 2 months prior, but it didn't linger with a negative after taste. What was most enjoyable was in fact was the mouthfeel, very well carbonated almost like if they took a pine cone and turned it into a soda, that refreshing.

I mean, its a great beer don't get me wrong, but it didn't stand out to me as something worthy of the absurd praise its received. the pour is a nice hazy honey color with a creamy white head with fine retention, beautiful. the nose is oily hops, high alpha semisweet fruity hops, with some pollen character from the honey and a subtle but complimentary yeast strain. the flavor is boldly hoppy, both bitter as hell and oily sticky danky. its a beer with plenty of motion, moving from a fruity sort of vibe to a really gnarly bitter bomb. the sweetness of the honey is hard to pick out, and the alcohol is shockingly well hidden. you would never know this was 10% abv until you drank 3 or 4 of them and it walloped you! great mouthfeel with groovy carbonation and a fuller medium body. there is a great resinous feel left after the swallow. overall an outstanding imperial ipa, one of the better ones ive had honestly, but it just didn't blow my mind the way it has for others.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",Imperial IPA,98

M: It feels a little more than medium-bodied and somewhat crisp on the palate with a moderate amount of carbonation. There are some bits of warming from the alcohol in the finish.

Creamy and lightly effervescent, it fills your mouth and doesn't leave the tongue willingly. This is, without a doubt, my favorite double IPA and certainly in my desert island 6-pack.

287,17112,4ster,4.55,"Poured into a large wine glass. Bottled Jan 9/2013. Served out of the fridge. Acquired in a trade from FrostyWG.  A: Clear, amber orange, trace of micro bubbles, thin, white frothy head that dies pretty quickly to a small bit of lacing. (is more hazy if you drain the bottle)  S: This is my first go at Hopslam, but I'd say the nose is already starting to fade on this, similar to other reviews. That said, sweet florals, lighter tropical aromas that aren't super sweet/acidic, and a light, sweet honey smell.  T: Out of the fridge, less floral and sweet, with a little more citrus and mellow tropical fruits, finishing slightly piney/grapefruit in the aftertaste. As it warms the malts and honey sweetness is more forward and pronounced, and it does get a bit more bitter.  M: Light-Med carbonation, medium body, very balanced, no real presence of alcohol except for a slight warming in the aftertaste, pretty neutral MF, a little sticky but that is about it. Very drinkable.  O: If I had to sum this up I would say it is like the younger sibling to Heady. Perhaps people don't like comparisons, but, I would say their hop profiles are similar, with Hopslam being perhaps a bit more tropical and sweet, with slightly less hop feel at the end. Both are extremely balanced and smooth which to me is what really separates these top notch DIPA's. That being said, Hopslam is a very good beer, though not the Hopslam I was expecting. i really like the floral/sweet honey undertones to compliment the hops, a nice touch, otherwise what you get is probably one of the more easy drinking DIPA's out there. Not sure it is worth the hype as it wouldn't be at the top of my Hop list, but it certainly is worth trying and one day it'd be nice to try a more fresh batch.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",Imperial IPA,98

Need I say more?",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",Imperial IPA,98
287,17112,Oakenator,4.65,Pours a light brown to yellow with a thick head. Good lacing. Aroma is strong hops - mostly pine with some floral. Flavor is consistent with the nose - sweet up front and piney bitter on the back persists well. Maybe a hint of honey sweetness present on the back end. Great beer.,Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",Imperial IPA,98
287,17112,312HopBomb,4.56,I received this fresh but took a while to review it. Down to my last one of the case.  Color is a clear honey tone with maybe a touch of hazing. Head is light and white.  The full aroma is sweet honey and citrus hops. Maybe orange blossom honey? Smells awesome.  Taste is a Hopslam as expected. A nice honey flavor is in the background during the full hop assault. Alcohol is noticeable with a slight burn. This is not a malty DIPA and the malt is light and lets the hops take center stage but the honey and malt do provide a solid base. Bitterness continues through the finish.  Mouth feel is medium with light carbonation.  I was blown away last year after trying this for the first time on tap upon it's release. This was almost as good but maybe because it was a bottle and not on tap. i am very glad my brother snagged a case for me. I will definitely seek this out next year. Bell's brewery rocks the hops.,Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",Imperial IPA,98
287,17112,MrKennedy,4.6,"12oz bottle, thanks to Rifugium and pdeepak for the bottle. Into a Southern Tier tulip.  Glowing golden appearance with a hint of orange about it. Really nice, abundant head of white foam on top that drips lacing. Really good looking beer.  Smell starts of as being a bit herbal. The honey is evident, so too the orange and citrus coming out of it. A bit of hoppy dankness to it as well, makes it more intruiging. Great mix.  Love the honey influence with this. Not the heavy honey, but really light, lifted sweetness. Goes well with a decent malt base that hides well in the background allowing the fruitiness to come through with pineapple, sweet pine sap and sweet grapefruit there.  Sweetness, fullness and a lightness that you would not expect from 10% ABV. Found this super drinkable and fortunate that this is at home, do not get any sign of booze. Sufficient bitterness to keep you coming back.  Loved it! Overall it is fantastic. Gives the sweetness of honey without any cloying or harshness. Lifts the flavour profile and in an incredibly drinkable way. One of the best hoppy beers i've come across.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",Imperial IPA,98
287,17112,GOBLUEBEERFAN,4.49,This was a very good beerb that started me into realy trying many kinds of beers for the first time and it is bad that you are unable to get it when you want it. I use to be a normal bud light drinker but never again. I really enjoyed the smell with the taste. I would love for this to be more available. I have enjoyed many of Bells brewery beers.,Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",Imperial IPA,98
287,17112,Jake_Ramrod,4.03,"I've been wanting to try Hopslam for a while now and was excited to finally see quite a bit of it in KY this winter. With allof the hype surrounding it, I went ahead and picked up a case of it. After trying a few of them, I'm not disappointed that I stepped up to the plate right off the bat. So, here it goes on my initial reaction:  A: Overall, it is decent looking beer, but nothing special. It's a faint amber color with a little carbonation. I slow poured it into a 12oz. West Sixth Brewing Tulip and was a bit surprised at the lack of head. Perhaps a more vigorous pour would have brought out a bit more carbonation and a thicker head.  S: A light touch of sweetness and flowers, but again not a huge overpowering aroma like many other IPAs I've had lately. Is the taste going to be as underwhelming as the nose and appearance?  T: Ah, now there is the result I was expecting. A very pleasant beer up front. Light touches of pine with an underlying bitterness that isn't overwhelming. More of a light grapefruit presence. This is actually a pretty balanced beer for one that presenst itself as a ""Hopslam"". The alcohol is muted for a 10%'er.I find myself instinctively going for drink after drink as I type this. Mmmm...  As the beer warmed, I found that the flavor profile changed and the hops became a bit more pronounced. I love it when temperature differences bring out the subtleties in a beer.  M: Actually, I find it a bit thin for its class. It could use a little more body to it. And, I get just a hint of a metallic feel to it.  O: Overall, a very nice example of its class. Extremely well balanced and very drinkable. Maybe not the best DIPA around, but definitely a really good beer for the money. Much more ""drinkable"" than many of its bretheren in the craft beer world.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",Imperial IPA,98
287,17112,Ryanm1,4.71,"Bell's, a quality brewer with National appeal. Bottle and cases were in scarcity in Philadelphia most of them selling out in a day or two from most places that were only allocated a few cases to begin with. I myself did not purchase the brew, but acquired from a friend.  Was interested to try this as I'm not a fan of IPAs but had heard good things. I guess it's been selling out for a reason. So no I didn't pour this one in a glass, so I can't comment on the color. And also I'm not going into detail about the nose other than it smelled along the lines of a typical IPA.  What I will comment on is the taste and the finish. The taste is excellent. Bursting with citrus and pine hops in the beginning, but finishes smooth. You can barely tell it is a 10% ABV beer. There is just slight undertones of alcohol. I feel a lot of IPAs out on the market linger too long on the tongue and feel like you are sucking on a 9 volt battery. This beer is mild for IPAs but complex for the 6 different hop types it uses.  Great IPA on par with my other favs from Flying Dog.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",Imperial IPA,98
287,17112,CommanderOfAwesome,4.33,"2013 bottle less than 1 month old.  A: Pours a nice golden amber with light 2 finger head.  S: Honey and floral sweetness with hops prevalent in the aroma.  T: Sweet honey with floral and citrus (Grapefruit) characteristics. Slight caramel as well with hops coming at the end. Not the ""hop slam"" I was expecting, more sweet and balanced but delicious never the less.  M: Medium bodied, perfectly carbonated. Slight bitter dry finish with sticky sweetness coating the mouth.  O: Fantastic well balanced sweet DIPA. While not a hop slam when compared to other West Coast DIPA, I prefer this style to them. I still like a maltier DIPA the best however.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",Imperial IPA,98

287,17112,Labeorphile,4.7,"Poured strong from a bottle into an oversized wine glass, but little head. What was there made up of tiny beautiful bubbles with little streams supporting underneath. Nice opaque light copper color.  Aroma is beautiful with lots of hops and honey. Need to find out what hops were used because I like the blend, very pleasing.  Flavor is good. The hops are well-balanced by the sweetness of the honey. Almost a little too sweet, with a bitter finish as expected. Mouth feel is good for style and carbonation seems about right. I was hoping for a bit more in the flavor, but a good drinkable beer.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",Imperial IPA,98
287,17112,Oxymoron,4.51,"Horray I got to try this fresh. Pours a light orange color with a golden red hue through out. Crystal clear with a fizzy head. Limited retention.  The nose is hop dominant. Very grassy and super fruity hop aromas. Some lemon grass and grapefruit notes with a citrus and orangey note. Some minor pineapple and herbal. Some minor esters, rose peddles and light mango. No real malt aroma's as the hops really shine  The taste is a touch more balanced but more hop in your face West coast IPA like flavors. The fruity notes come out more vs the nose but some herbal and grassy notes linger into the finish. More of a mango, apricot and lemon flavor. This blends into more grapefruit and simco like catty hops in the finish. Some resinous like notes and a hint of bitterness. Would like a bit more to balance. The malt is second fiddle for sure but comes out more vs the nose. A touch sweet some minor honey characteristics. Some yeasty notes. Esters, sweet plum and roses as well.  The body is moderate. Would like a bit more depth here as well as a bit more astingency to balance out the hop notes. Carbonation is light and could use a touch to balance. Some heat and a minor oily note in the finish. Overall a nice west coast IPA but really would like a touch more balance.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",Imperial IPA,98

287,17112,TripelBlove,4.64,"This has to be one of the best IPA's I've ever had. Yes, I know it is a double IPA but I categorize all of them together. Had it as part of a sampler with several other beers and what I love most about this beer is that although you get a strong sense of hoppiness, the honey quickly dissipates any of the lingering bitterness that is usually left by such IPA's. A must have if you are ever at the brewery, try to save as much as possible. Currently aging an '11 and a '12 together. Looking forward to when I can try them next year!",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",Imperial IPA,98
287,17112,Tuey13,4.91,"Pours a beautiful crystal clear golden honey color with a creamy off-white head. The lacing on the glass is thick and sticky almost like icing!  The smell is heavenly... strong sweet pineapple, mango, peach, fruity citrus, light honey, and of course piney hops! I wish they made air fresheners in this scent!!  The taste is a utopia of balanced perfection... bitter pine and juicy grapefruit... then you get a sweetness form the honey and the malts to balance out the bitterness. The alcohol is dangerously hidden in this, only evident in the warming sensation in my chest With every sip i am amazed at how deliciously smooth this is.  I know how much negative reviews have been on this year but i disagree... it is what it is, a very big well balanced double IPA that is crafted beautifully. I know with the exorbitant price it opens up some issues with the previous years releases... but come on everyone... this is a phenomenal beer. I think we have all become stuck up beer snobs sadly... sigh.... anyone not wanting to finish their lots can send me the leftovers lollll.

Strong pine notes in this edition with some floral background, perhaps a tiny hint if citrus. Medium/heavy mouthfeel, syrupy pine hops hit the pallate hard upfront with a slight malt backbone. Bitterness comes in late and lingers a bit. Overall it lacks the citrus notes and balance of the 2012 vintage. Good, but in my opinion this year doesn't earn the high rating it has on the top 250.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",Imperial IPA,98

Smell: Resinous hops, a little cat urine, rubbing alcohol with some citrus fruits, grapfruit, and orange peel.  taste: Sticky/sweet bitter citrus notes, almost like biting into an orange with the rind still on. finishes with hops and then falls off clean, and leaving you begging for another bite/sip. This is yummy! It hides its ABV of 10% very well.  Mouthfeel: well bodied for the style which sits on the tongue and leaves the mouth dry, which is to be expected, but still tingling from the flavors.

I reached in with my finger and rubbed some off and it was almost like cotton candy on my finger..It appears to be sweet,sticky, nectar given to us only by the masters at Bells.  S: oh my lord! Pineapple,Mango skin,and a little bit of peach with a generous amount of alcohol on the back end to enhance these amazing aromas. I am picking up on the honey mixed with some sweet malty goodness that is just seducing me.  T: wow this is everything i hoped it would be and then some! Sweetness up front with bitterness int he middle and a tad bit of alcohol on the back end..The pineapple with the honey mixes together then the hops just smack you in the face.The simcoe hops shine though on this one and i am just amazed at each sip how delicious the beer really is. This is a close second to Heady Topper if not neck and neck...wow.  M: Medium body feel at first then the honey just make this beer coat your mouth giving it a sweet,sticky coating that just lasts forever..each drink blows me away.  O: In my opinion this is the second best DIPA in the world only to Heady and im still not sure if its neck and neck, this beer has the greatest mouth feel i have ever experienced in a beer..Just a superb brew and i cannot get enough of it!

287,17112,martyl1000,4.59,"Original Review: 2/2013 On tap at Maduro, Madison. A beautiful pour in a Bell's tulip glass. Inch of fluffy snow-looking head. And glacial lacing on the glass.  It's often more of a challenge to write a review in a bar, given all the distractions and working on a cell phone touchscreen keyboard. That's particularly true of the cigar bar. Great aroma, though the cigar smoke in here is obstructing any and all nuance. I'm getting generic concepts of high hop bitterness, the foundation of bready grains, and a syrupy sweetness.  in the mouth the hop bitterness and candy sweetness team up to beat back the tobacco smoke. There's only room on my pallate for one alpha flavor. ------- UPDATE 2/24/15 Oh, man. Delish. This is a fresh Hopslam (bottled in January, 2015).  Still not as good as on tap, which I've had twice in the past two weeks and loved, absolutely. Today, this beer has an astringent aftertaste (which was not present in the tap beer), and it hurts it significantly. Still, amazing, though.  I'd give this bottled Hopslam a 4.30.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",Imperial IPA,98

287,17112,padan7,3.23,"Hopslam once a great beer...now a bitter disappointment. Used to think that Hopslam was the cat's meow now I think it tastes like...  I had this on tap 2/16/13 and drank a bottle on 2/15/13 (bottled on 1/2/13). The review was similar.  It looks like the old Hopslam. Nice looking IPA golden with a nice head.  The smell- not the same amount of pineapple citrus in the nose as before not bad but the aroma has been turned down.  The taste- could not find that wonderful balance of citrus/pineapple/honey/hops. Could barely taste the citrus and the taste was more bland and average than before. What a letdown. Looking for the wonderful  Mouthfeel- thinner and less savory than before.  Overall- I called Bells looking for someone to talk to. Ryan said ""I'm not aware of any quality issues."" I thought I might have gotten a bad 6-pack but the draft the next night tasted the same. Three other friends all agree this is not as good as it used to be.  Lagunitas Sucks, Hoptimum, Nugget Nectar are all better more cost effective choices to me now.  My number 1 IPA is fresh(30 days or less) Zombie Dust.  If you don't like spending $18 for a 6-pack of just ok tasting beer than pass on Hopslam this year.

S: Floral with some citrus and def a hit of sweet honey.  T: Very well balanced beer and too easy to drink for 10% ABV. You get the floral and piney citrus up front and then that smooth sweet backbone balances this beer wonderfully.  M: Nice carbonation with a great body. Pretty much what you expect from a IIPA.

Spidwerweb lacing coats the glass.  Smell: Pine, some orange, some alcohol. Smells brutal and uninviting, in a kind of good way?  Taste: This is my second Hopslam this year, and I think you really have to be in the right mood to enjoy it. It's a really strong, bitter DIPA! Or maybe a beautifully approachable orange and citrus forward Barleywine? The honey and high alcohol does lend a bit of a malty sweetness to balance the bitterness, which I respect, though the alcohol taste is a bit strong for me. An interesting and unique brew. Not overly sweet with the normal highly regardless citrus and tropical fruit notes, but there is just enough in there to counteract the pungent bitterness. I'm rambling, because I'm not sure how I feel about it. Maybe that's a good thing? Like I said, it certainly is interesting and complex! Okay, now I am really feeling like the lingering finish is nice and sweet like an overly ripe orange. Shit!  Mouthfeel: A little more simple than the taste. Thank god. Pretty thick mouthfeel, with average to slightly low carbonation. Stickiness coats afterwards. A bit thick for me ... not super refreshing.  Overall: Glad to try it.

287,17112,Auraan,5,"Poured a nice amber into a tulip glass, bubbles can be seen rising and a very slight off white head formed. The scent is of floral grassy hops, pine and grapefruit, with slight hints of honey and cat urine. The cat urine scent became more pronounced as the beer warmed but was almost pleasant in an odd way. The taste was excellent. Bitter pine begins each sip, going into more bitter pine mixed with grapefruit and ending on notes of bitter grapefruit pith. There is also a nice presence of malt, though it is overwhelmed somewhat by the hop profile, as well as nice hints of honey that are present throughout each sip. The mouthfeel is pleasant, with a slight carbonation, but not enough to dull the tongue to the hops or make drinking the beer difficult. There is also a slight stickiness but not as much as in some examples of the style. The mouthfeel aids the flavor of the beer and does not detract. Overall this is an excellent DIPA, by far one of the best, with an excellent hop flavor profile, well worthy of the title hop bomb. Yet it also is well balanced and avoids the pitfalls of being too hoppy. A beer to try and to enjoy.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",Imperial IPA,98
287,17112,humuloner22,4.89,"I am a fan of IPA's. This one is a DIPA which I have had a few but this one is really good. But from the beers I have had from Bell's this one is no exception. I love the 2 hearted ale and this one builds upon a similar paradigm, its just a bit more adventurous. When I drink Bells it makes me think of Hemingway and this one is no exception it should be like For Whom the Bell Tolls really, when you open it it smells of a pine forest, much like the novel. But it goes into a tropical citrus character. I was getting pine, but also grapefruit and pineapple from the aroma. The color was a nice golden ale typical of the color scheme for this style. The taste was much like the smell a good bit floral from the hops, but not bitter really. I know the label says that it is strong, but I felt it was really well balanced considering the amount of hops and IBU's in a DIPA. This is a great cooler weather beer, perfect for spring or fall, although it will not last that long. It was pricey but was worth it and just be careful the 10% will get you.

T: Glorious blast of hops, spicy and piney, then honey, caramel, grapefruit, pineapple. Doesn't get much better.  M: Rich and creamy but finishes dry thanks to ABV and a truckload of hops.

Absolutely lives up to expectations in every aspect.

287,17112,hctap00,4.6,"Drank through my half-case so quickly that I nearly forgot to do a review, so here goes.  For me, this is what an IPA should look like. Clear and golden with a creamy white head. None of my pours yielded too thick a head, which I found a bit surprising.  As soon as I pour it, the aroma fills the room. Not overpowering, but intoxicating nonetheless. Fantastic hop bouquet. Pine dominates. Very sweet. The fruity aromas are brighter and more tropical than in most IPAs.  Taste is near perfect as far as I am concerned. Piney hops upfront. Seems like it might get overwhelming when the sweet malt backbone kicks in just enough. More pine with some citrus towards the end. The finish is what really distinguishes Hopslam for me. A subtle yet still assertive fruity blast, pineapple for me, that rounds out the beer perfectly.  Still one of my all time favorites. I will buy it every year.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",Imperial IPA,98

S: A load of hops. Tropical; pineapple dominated with sweet orange peel and grapefruit. Faint smell of alcohol.  T: the smell is outstanding, but this is where the beer really exceeds my already over-hyped expectations. Loads of hops. Ldrinking sweet grapefruit juice. No sharpness or raw hop bitterness in the finish. Incredibly balanced: like the brewers extracted the floral aspects of pounds of hops (for this single beer) and left behind any of the hop acidity.  M: Velvety and resinous. Often with DIPAs, it feels syrupy, or alternatively, flat. This beer is light on the tongue and quenching. Unreal how smooth it goes down for %10 ABV.  O: Can't say a bad thing about it. Felt like a sucker buying a $16 sixer and wanted to find fault with the almighty HypeSlam, but this is as close to beer perfection as I have had the pleasure of tasting.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",Imperial IPA,98
287,17112,Bosoxfan20,4.27,"Bottled on date of 1/9/13  A- Crisp copper color with a clean, clear appearance. Large, dense white head of about 1.5-2 fingers. Great lacing and retention. Perfect carbonation  S- Strong fragrance of pine with floral aroma. Sweet honey and biscuits.  T- Wow. Multiple waves of flavor flowing over your taste buds. Pine from the aroma hits you first, then some citrus, followed by some sweetness, and finishing a terrific touch of bitterness. The balance of this beer is simply amazing. The honey used in conjunction with the malt base makes for a fantastic combination. You wouldn't notice the 10% abv based on the taste. Well hidden.  M- Texture of the beer is spot on for a double IPA. Mid-full bodied. I was expecting the finish to be dry, as common with most IPA's brewed with west coast hops, but that wasn't the case here. Exceptional job of balancing the sweetness with the simcoe hops.  O- I was a little skeptical of the hype surrounding this beer. But i have to admit, it lived up to, and possibly exceeded my expectations. I am reluctant to hand out big scores on the beers I rate or review, but this is certainly one of the best double IPAs I have ever had.

S - at first it smells like I walked into a florist. Exceedingly floral. Underneath the bouquet of flowers (pun intended) rests a basket of fruit. Citrus and tropical fruit to be exact. Notes of sweet and bitter orange peel, mango, tangerine and sugar coated grapefruit pulp. Hints of earthy pine come out as it warms.  T - Lightly sweet malt profile, almost like honeycomb cereal. hop flavor enters quickly with ""green"" herbal notes as well as bright citric bitterness. Mostly bitter orange peel and grapefruit rind in the center while hints of mango and pine needles add depth of character. Candied grapefruit pulp flavors on the backend. Floral, pine and bitter citrus notes seem to linger for days...  M - medium bodied with a slightly watery texture with medium carbonation.  O - Excellent double IPA.

O - you can definitely sense the quality that's put into this brew. Everything very obviously fits together well.

Very nice to watch. The aroma is very much filled with citrus and resinous pine, along with a floral sweetness and a detectable malty backbone. The taste transfers from orange to bitter grapefruit, but then the bitterness just about disappears to reveal malt with a nectar like sweetness. The finish comes back with a bitterness stronger than the introduction. The mouthfeel is excellent.

287,17112,Anker13,3.83,"2/7/13 Bell’s Brewery | 2013 Hopslam | 12oz Bottle  Appearance- light copper honey color, slight haze, white lacy head  Aroma- very hoppy, lots of piney grapefruity notes, a little citrus and spice, slight malt character, just a hint of honey sweetness. Smells very similar to Ithaca’s Alphalpha  Mouthfeel- It’s got a great feel to it. Light CO2 makes for a smooth experience, full bodied, well balanced and juicy  Taste- It’s an interesting progression. A little bitterness upfront leads into a sweet malty center, but then the bitterness makes an impressive comeback on the finish. Pine and grapefruit, toffee sweetness, almost quinine like on the end  Residual- lingering bitterness (in a good way), touch of sweetness, leaves you thirsty for me  Overall- The closest comparison I can draw is Ithaca’s Alphalpha, and honestly… Alphalpha is better.  This is overhyped for sure. Don’t get me wrong, it’s still a great DIPA. There’s plenty of character to make it a good and tasty beer, but $20+ for a six-pack? Never again.

287,17112,dbl_delta,4.4,"Can dated 01/16/18 into pint glass. Pours a very attractive deep amber color with a substantial and persistent eggshell-white head. Initial impression is a very tasty citrus, nicely balanced by biscuit and light caramel malts, fading into a resinous pine-y bitterness in the finish. Mouthfeel and carbonation are perfect. I rated Hopslam a 4.5 back in 2013. I wish I had written a review, but I didn't. That was in the very early stages of my rating/reviewing career - in fact, it was only my 9th review (838 beers ago). PBR was still my ""go to"" beer at the time. Hopefully, my perspective has changed in the intervening 5 years, but surprisingly my rating hasn't. This is a really enjoyable DIPA. Highly recommended.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",Imperial IPA,98
287,17112,StopPre694,4.94,"Poured from bottle into a standard 12 oz. beer-stein:  A - Poured a darkish amber hue - not nearly opaque, but not quite translucent. Pour produced about a 2-inch full-bodied head with great lacing that maintained itself quite nicely &lt;---- continued to bubble throughout consumption, almost reminiscent of a wet-hop ale brewed with champagne yeast.  S - Incredibly powerful aromas exploded from the bottle instantly upon opening. Hop aroma smells wonderfully fresh and I am detecting an earthiness to it, as well as floral, citrus, coriander, and honey (this is stated on the bottle-label).  T - Taste exceeds the already-lofty expectations I had due not only to the mind-boggling hype this beer gets every year, but also due to the considerably enticing aromatic profile. At 90 IBU's, this beer is indeed quite bitter, but comes in considerably lower than other, similar offerings of its peers in the same double-IPA style (e.g. Sierra Nevada's Hoptimum came in at 100 IBU's this year, and the difference in bitterness between the two was highly noticeable). Because of this, I was amazed at how drinkable this brew was, despite its tour de force hop-profile and exceedingly high ABV; to that end, WHERE is the 10%?! The alcohol is so well-hidden and blended within the hops and citrus/honey notes that I would've guessed it to be about 7% if for not reading the bottle-label. Aftertaste is wonderful and the flavor profile builds as you let it marinate on your tongue.  M - Great mouthfeel. Only gripe I have is I wish it had a little bit more carbonation; after finishing one and moving on to a second bottle, I noticed that they seemed a BIT watery, but nothing that truly detracts from the overall greatness of this beer. The hops are biting and truly challenge your taste-buds to keep up, if you will. Delicious syrupy go-down, likely from the honey, which gives it a unique feel.  O - Overall, I can honestly say this is the best double-IPA I have ever had (granted, I have never had the luxury of trying Pliny the Elder or Heady Topper &lt;--- commonly implicated as Hopslam's only worthy competitors in the style. Though the price for a 6-pack is steep (I paid $15.99 for 6 and that was a sale-price), it is well worth it. Phenomenal brew and I wish I hadn't drank the 6-pack so fast; can't wait till next year!!",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",Imperial IPA,98

I tasted it side-by-side with Lagunitas Sucks DIPA, which is clearly the superior beer in 2013. For the exorbitant price and hype, Hopslam will probably be my biggest disappointment in 2013.

287,17112,BedetheVenerable,4.07,"Presentation: 12oz brown pop-top with awesome label and cap. Bottled 1/9/2013, so I'm having this at just under 4 weeks of age. Poured into my Founders snifter to celebrate being offered a job. Thanks to Russ G. for gifting me this bottle. Cheers!  Appearance: Honeyed orange-amber brew, capped with a rich ivory crown. Lots of super-fine sediment in suspension. Overall, very attractive DIPA.  Smell: Vibrant, incredibly juicy hops. Massive ruby red grapefruit and sweet citrus/tropical fruit (maybe mango?) along with dank herbal notes. By the time I'm halfway through the glass, I get a ghostly hint of pale malt. Not crazy-complex, but this has a sweet, fruity hoppy intensity I haven't seen in too many other DIPAs. Not really the pine I (for some reason) was expecting, but the nice herbal notes keep this from being one-dimensional.  Taste: Booze and a strong, firm, but not harsh, hop bitterness lead here, with hop flavor showing less intensity than the aromas. There are, however, nice notes of peach, herbs (stronger than the fruit), and citrus rind. You certainly feel the 10%, but it's not quite hot, if that makes sense. While I would like more intensity in terms of hop flavor, this is integrated fairly well.  Mouthfeel: Medium feel, maybe leaning towards full. Smooth.  Overall: I remember when I first had this, 3-4 years ago, I was absolutely blown away. Then I had it a couple more times, both on-tap and in the bottle, and I thought it was good, maybe even great, but not as incredible as I'd once thought. With a (hopefully) more nuanced palate, I wanted to give it a try again this year. Let's break this down. The aromas are world-class; this brew smells absolutely fantastic. The flavors are, in comparison with the aroma, a bit of a let-down. However, this is a very nicely balanced DIPA. For some people, that seems to be a bad thing, which I don't understand. Don't get me wrong, I love me some Green Flash Palate Wrecker, but it's not very often I crave something like that. This is an all-around great DIPA. Is it world-class in the way that Pliny the Elder is? Perhaps not. But it's damn good nonetheless. Is it worth $17 bucks a sixer? Maybe if you have the coin. I kinda wish they'd throw this in 4-pks and charge $10-11, and I'd probably pick one up every season. In the end, the price (and the madness around trying to land a sixer, even when there's plenty in your area) has to drop this a bit.  90% = A-",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",Imperial IPA,98

287,17112,RedneckBeerz,4.09,"I'd agree with a few other reviews that I have read off the top. This is a well balanced D/I IPA. Problem, every take on an American Double/Imperial IPA calls for a heavy Hop forward brew in smell, taste, and bitterness; none of which apply to this brew. Tasty, Indeed. But much like Pliny the Elder (to me) it is to well balanced to be a world class D/I IPA. Disagree ? I'd gladly trade you my 5 pack for two 4's of Gandhi Bot or a couple of 6's of Ithaca Flower Power. To me this brew is way to balanced to be considered more than an excellent D/I IPA.

I cant speak to that, but I can say Lagunitas Sucks was my second round. Good beer, but nothing to write home about.

Beer has an opaque straw color that leans towards a light orange. Aroma is super bright, citrusy, flowery hoppiness. Slight earthiness ( maybe unfermentables from the honey? ) Aroma is worth a second, third, maybe seventeenth smell. Just to be a little more descriptive, there is a lot of tangerine and orange coming through. Some grapefruit, and I think I'm getting that signature fruitiness of their house yeast. Taste is some serious bright hop fruitiness. More tangerine, mango and grapefruit. The hop flavor combined with above-average sweetness really hides the ABV and balances the assertive ( but not harsh ) bitterness. Mouthfeel is pretty thick, and coats easily. Slight warming sensation at the end of the sip.  Overall... yeah this is worth the hype. The focus is ALL on the hop flavor and aroma, and the residual sweetness tames the bitterness to really let the bright flavors and aromas shine through.

Fresh hops, citrus, cotton candy.  T - 4.25 -Really nicely balanced. There is a malty citrusy sweetness offset by a bitterness that's an even match for it at first but which takes over in the immediate aftertaste and lingers. I'm so glad to have caught this so fresh. What a difference it makes.  M - 4.5 - Short of medium bodied. Sticky on the tongue after swallowing. I'm left with the nicest warm, mature dryness in the aftertaste and exhale. There is the beginning of hop abrasion, which is leaving my lips and tongue slightly tingling but not raw. That's nice.  O - 4.25 - That has to be one of the better DIPAs I've had and just a winner all around. Whether it's $18-a-sixpack good is another question. I'm glad I tried it and like it a lot but think I'll stick to one sixpack per release. When you compare the per-bottle cost to what you'd pay in a bar, it's really not pricey at all.

A light malty sweet smell overpowered by resinious, floral, grassy hops, with light hints of citrus, grapefruit, and pine.  Taste: 4.5 Initially there is a light malt sweetness with hints of rich caramel-like honey with contrasting earthy, resinious hop qualities.

Overall: 4.75 The beer, if tasted blindly, begins like any other imperial IPA and has similar qualities. What sets this beer apart is the delicate interplay between flavors the expert blending of hops, malt, and honey for an experience unlike any other.

Too many dIPAs are so overwhelmingly hoppy that the cumulative effect of the bitterness increasingly drowns out all other flavors with each passing sip. Not so with Hopslam.

S: Like walking into a warehouse piled high with whole-cone hops and barley malts. A pungent, floral aroma hits the olfactories immediately, followed by a caramel candy finish. This one's definitely a smeller!  T: The sharp piney hops slam your tongue- lots of spiciness and a hint of honey, with a boozey, vaguely chalky aftertaste. It's the unsettling quality of that lingering aftertaste which brings the score down to a 4.5 for me. I'd prefer more of a rich, malt finish to my DIPA- something akin to Sierra Nevada's ""Hoptimum"" or Dogfish Head's ""Burton Baton"". This is still one of the best-tasting examples of the style out there...but it's something about these Bell's IPAs...I notice the same thing when drinking Two Hearted Ale.  M: Great mouthfeel overall. Carbonation in relatively light, and the beer hits your tongue with a crisp flow. The hops make the tongue jump a bit, but that's to be expected with the style.  O: While it's not the 'be all and end all' of DIPAs as some folks hail it, it's definitely a winner for those hopheads among us! As mentioned above, there are better examples of the style out there (particularly Sierra Nevada's ""Hoptimum""), but on balance, this is a pretty incredible beer that makes every frigid Michigan January just a little warmer!",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",Imperial IPA,98
287,17112,TheSSG,3.69,"Pours a HUGE, dense head with resin all over; very persistent with thick lacing. Surprisingly soft aroma is floral and hoppy...but unexpectedly subdued. Hazy, golden-honey color. Starts almost tart with a lot of citrus hops. There is a very noticeable sweetness. I'm REALLY surprised noticeable the honey is. It builds to a medium hoppiness which becomes more of a citrus/pine bitterness in the finish.  This was a HUGE letdown. It's not overly hoppy in the bitter sense (a la ""Ruination"") or the floral/aromatic sense (a la ""Bedlam"") ""With a name like Hopslam, what did you expect?"" I expected to get SLAMMED WITH HOPS! The honey pairs very, very well with the floral hops.

Six bucks later, here is my review. Smell is nice, typical DIPA aromas. Pine, winter citrus, pineapples. Taste was where I was a bit taken back. Its good don't get me wrong, but all the hype around this beer and it tends to fall short. Bitter fruits, a bit of honey and some tropical fruits. Not really impressed, didn't blow my mind like expected.

287,17112,sjones5045,4.03,"On tap at Bell's. Pours exactly as you'd expect from a quality Imerial IPA, dark orange with a great at hoppy citrus smell. Taste is worldclass. Hits you with a hops out of the gate and remains on the tongue evenly throughout the entire mouthful. Extremely smooth and hides the Abv very well. The hoppy citrus taste does not linger too long which makes you want more. This is an extremely relaxing IPA that you just want to take your time with. Last note is that this may be the first beer I truly can say on tap is hands down better than the bottle. Not to say the bottle is bad, it's more of a comment on just the incredible freshness straight from the tap, and in this case straight from the brewery. This is the best IIPA I've had to date.  2014 Update: (score was 4.95 in 2013) not sure what happened with this years Hopslam but it just isn't as smooth as previous year. I don't find it as citrusy either. At first I thought maybe my taste has changed but I still feel the same about other seasonal IIPAs that I liked last year and still like this year. Maybe the hops pick too early or late but it definitely isn't the top of class anymore. Hopefully next year it will regain its form.  2018 Edit This beer has either changed or my taste has.

Smell : WOW. Smells absolutely delicious. The first thing that I got was a strong citrus and tropical fruit aroma. Also, floral and honey notes are present along with a slight piney scent that reminds you it's a dipa. Taste: very well balanced flavors, the hops are certainly present but not at all overwhelming or bitter. The citrus from the smell is present as is the slight honey sweetness. Also getting a fairly strong apricot presence.. Finishes with a dry hoppiness that makes you want another sip. Mouthfeel : nice moderate mouthfeel and carbonation. Very smooth for a 10% abv.

I must note that I did think the beer had a good flavor and my less than perfect review could be that my tastes are leaning more to hop forward beers and I would say I found this beer more balanced than I remember and not the Hopslam that I remember.  Serving type: bottle so glad that someone else had the same experience as i did. everyone holds this beer up so high, and they dont want to say anything negative about it, but i completely agree that this is a different tasting beer from years past. very disappointed in the 2013 hopslam. ive tried it from a bottle to snifter, and from draft as well. same response...disappointment especially for 11.oo for a pint. i can think of 15 other beers id prefer having before this one this year.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",Imperial IPA,98
287,17112,LibrariansLoveBEER,4.52,"Poured into a pint glass from a 12 oz bottle.  Appearance: I was very excited to find this at the bar we went to before dinner (very good Thai, BTW) as it wasn’t on the beer list, but the bartender mentioned they had it after telling my friend they were out of the Green Flash West Coast IPA. I couldn’t get a good look at the color as I was unable to hold it up to the light. The head was excellent as proved by the lacing, it was ravishing, lingering on the glass until the very last swallow. A lovely sight to behold.  Smell: No mistaking that this is a DIPA. More citrus aroma than pine, definitely grapefruit and lemon zest.  Taste: The ABV was sly, not in your face like you might expect from a 10% beer. The balance was remarkable for a beer called HOPslam. The hops flavor was strong and able, but not overpowering like some other DIPA’s and IPA’s.  Mouthfeel: A great beer to savor, the taste does not diminish as it warms. It settles into all the spaces and corners of your mouth just making itself at home. I liked the carbonation.  Overall: I drank this after having a Lagunitas Sucks earlier in the evening, so I think I will go back and try it again all by its lonesome. I did enjoy it immensely but it was partly influenced by the overall nice time I was having with my husband and my best friends.

Smell: Please, please, please let the taste match the smell.! Mango, honey, citrus and slight grapefruit team up to make one of the best smelling beers, ever. Damn.  Taste: Honey is present throughout the course of the drink. It allows citrus/mango sweetness to take center stage with a nice quick crescendo, then as they fade, the bitterness sets in gradually at the end. The end of the drink is nicely balanced, however and finishes bittersweet in a pleasant way. Booze is hid pretty well for a fresh beer. It doesn't get much better than this.  Mouthfeel: Full and nice, with ample carbonation and still isn't too much.  Overall: This was my first slamdance and you can color me impressed. One of the best 2xIPAs I've ever had. Hype=earned.

Poured from a growler into a Westbrook tulip.  A: Beautiful dark honey/amber color. Slightly off-white, 2 finger, foamy head. Good lacing all the way down.  S: Amazing. Sweet honey, candied orange, floral/citrusy hoppiness.  T: It's starts off with sweet honey/caramel and the grapefruit and orange zest follows closely behind. From there you start to get some of the floral, hop bitterness that lingers right to the end where the malt comes back for one last go. The crisp, hop bitterness wins in the end though and is what is left on your palate.  M: Crisp. Good carbonation but not overdone. Medium mouthfeel.  O: I try not to buy into the hype, but it's hard not to with this one. It is a fantastic DIPA. I'm not the biggest fan of palate destroying, bitter IPA's, so the balance Bell's has created with this one makes this 10% DIPA very drinkable.

Some grapefruit comes through when farther back from the glass.  T: Lots of bitterness in the flavor, with that sort-of tree resin quality. Some of the catty flavor comes through as well. It feels like biting into an unripe citrus fruit. Some spruce comes through in the after-taste. I get nothing from the malt.  M: Very chewy. Lots of bitterness that is a tad rough. Fairly light bodied.  O: Overall I thought it was a pretty good beer. It leaned more towards a catty flavor that I'm not fond of, then followed up with a ton of what tasted like citrus rind. I wouldn't say it's my favorite DIPA, but it's pretty good. I'm very surprised that it's 10% ABV because I didn't even check before drinking...and couldn't taste the alcohol at all.

287,17112,TheCondor,4.18,"I was finally able to get my hands on some Hopslam, for the first time ever. I called almost a dozen local stores before I finally tracked it down at a sleazy supermarket/liquor store/discount cigarette place. Anyway, side poured from the bottle into my Boulevard pint glass.  Appearance - Pours a beautiful golden color with a copper tinge and a real nice, two finger head that sticks around for damn near the whole drink. Leaves excellent lacing as well, basically a line on the side of the glass for every time I drink. Love the packaging, a dude getting run over by a massive hop. Appropriate.  Smell - It is certainly a DIPA, no doubt about that. To me the hops are more a fruity variety than anything else, with citrus, grapefruit, and lemon zest in there with a touch of flowery hops and a slight yeastiness in the background.  Taste - There is certainly several layers to the hoppiness of the brew, not initially noticeable as much in the nose as on the palate. Again the fruity hops play in with citrus and grapefruit, some pine, and that slight maltiness to balance the beer. Very good. Not too much hoppiness, but enough to ensure you know this is a DIPA.  Mouthfeel - Medium bodied and carbonated. Finishes crisp and bitter, with a slight alcohol warmth to it. Smooth but certainly not weak.  Overall - Of course, I relished the fact that I was finally getting to drink the fabled Hopslam, and it is an excellent beer indeed. I think my review bears that out. However, I do not rate it as highly as many on this site, and certainly do not think it is the best DIPA I have ever had, nor is it worth the price or an extended road trip to get it. While it is an excellent beer, I likely won't buy it again just because of the exorbitant markup and search process.

A- pours crystal clear golden-orange color with a two finger foamy white head that reduces to a small layer skimming the top, leaving textbook lace around the rim.  S- wow, hops punch in the face! Sharp and pungent citrus notes, oily resin, some floral notes, citrus pineapple and papaya and a very refreshing mint leave smell. Just a touch of yeasty malt on the end with a bit of dank. Quite complex.  T- the thing that's immediately stands out upon the first few sips is the complexity of the hops. I'm getting citrus, mango, papaya, grass, fresh mint and just a touch of pine. The alcohol is noticeable but not 10% noticeable, just enough to warm up the palate. With the complexity of the malts, it doesn't rip my tongue out. But rather leaves an intense hop linger that lasts long after the sip. Malt it noticeable but this is obviously a hop show.  M- medium body, moderate carbonation, just enough to give it a kick. Quite possibly the creamiest mouthfeel I've experienced from a DIPA, the finish is velvety, leaving just enough alcohol to let you know it's there.  O- After finishing half of the glass I'm still picking out little subtleties that pop out from the hop profile. This is the best DIPA that I've had, nearly perfect mouthfeel, hidden alcohol and a solid flavor profile. Worth seeking out.   Note: Revisiting this beer 3 years later and I can't get over how boozy it is in both aroma and taste. It almost has a vodka-taste finish.

It is hazy golden color that is clear but looks as though there is something extra in it.  S - This one really lets off some hop aroma. It is really dank and pungent with a ""citrusy"" orange smell. A wonderfully sweet cascade of hops from this makes my mouth water. After drinking this beautiful smell fades away so if you like the scent smell it before you drink it.  T - Again like the nose, a pungent dank citrusy (orange, lemon) hops which leads into a bitter bite on the back end. This one is relatively sweet and honey-ish but not cloying with minute amounts of alcohol on the aftertaste. So bitter it has an astringency to it on the finish.  M - Medium bodied with enough carbonation to keep the flavors going. My tongue can feel the bitter bite of this brew in which it feels like it was scrubbed clean by the hop oils. Slightly sticky. Interesting what it does to the mouth for sure.  O - This brew is what ended up getting me into drinking true craft beer.

Pours a cloudy orange with plenty of carbonation evident and a two-finger head that gradually gives way to a foamy coating. Lacing is perfect evidence of each sip. Nose is overwhelming citrus (especially orange, grapefruit and lemon), but hints of honey are there as promised. Taste: The one disagreement I would have with Stone is that his is NOT a ""biting, bitter, tongue buster,"" although elements of each descriptor are there. I find it actually much better balanced than that, the honey backbone probably doing the most to sorta' tame these very wonderful hops. Taste is at first dominated by the citrus but this is so beautifully balanced by the honey and caramel. Mouthfeel is medium, and aftertaste is a sweet bitterness that is not overly cloying. Certainly, there is enough bitterness and dryness to satisfy DIPA fans but this is a VERY refreshing and crisp end to a very special beer. Come on, can't SOMEONE do this ALL YEAR?

There is still plenty of aroma, however, sweetness came to the forefront rather than the normal citus/pine smell I would have expected.  Taste - Certainly not a DIPA that would cause your taste buds to beg for mercy on the initial sip. Very smooth DIPA that hides its 10% ABV very well, did not taste ""hot"" at all.

A blend of peach,lemon and grapefruit jumps out of the glass. A few more whiffs give off a tiny bit of dank hop aroma mixed with alcohol.

287,17112,Neorebel,4.82,"-Bottle date 1/23/13 -  Hopslam's appearance mirrors the sheen of untouched copper... and after looking upon it in my snifter, it now resembles pure honey, with an almost imperceptible haziness, and a fizzyness that quickly wanes to a thin ring of white around the perimeter of the glass. The aroma is enough to make me salivate! Contained within each whiff are the essences of clementines, zesty lemons, juicy red grapefruit, pungent resinous oils, wild honey and sap. Scents of boardwalk shop sweets and flower garden bouquets enter my imagination. The hop's bitterness and floral aspects court my tastebuds equally, then a second later, a super-sweet tingle of honey and pollen appears on the tip of my tongue, as if it were a finale. The brew gracefully coats the inside of the mouth, and it's warming on the way down. Very smooth and velvety... Despite the high ABV and dry finish, it is the antithesis of harsh, for sure. A mimicry of other popular DIPAs, this is certainly not. To say that each sip leaves me wanting more is an understatement... rather, I find myself unable to believe this otherworldly elixir is really in my grasp! I'd imagine this is what the great god Pan drank in the unspoiled wilderness of Arcadia!",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",Imperial IPA,98
287,17112,SaxmanRick,4.74,"On tap at 3 Squares in Maple Grove in MN. Pours amber colored with 1 inch head. Nice retained lacing. Smells of sweet malt and fresh, but not sharp, hops.  Taste is well balanced...malt base is full and slightly sweet and well balanced with the strong hop presense. This was a very fresh keg, but prominent hops (but not overbearing) were crisp. clean and similar but not quite as sharp as fresh hops. Lighter citrus (orange?), and sweetness apparently from honey, but not sweet for the sake of sweetness. Overall, well balanced and royal.  This is a special Imperial IPA. Alcohol well hidden and very drinkable...almost sessionable. I proceded to buy bottles for future pleasures.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",Imperial IPA,98
287,17112,Cobrito,3.69,"A nice brew, but not the best of the best even though I had to go behind the counter at total wine to find one. Biggest weakness is the taste doesn't follow the nose because it is a bit too sweet and dumbed down by something, either the honey or the malts or both. Not as ""biting"" as advertised, does not live up to the hype surrounding it, but still tasty and drinkable.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",Imperial IPA,98
287,17112,Ilafan,4.39,"Love love love BEll's Hopslam Ale! To me, the combination of the honey with the hoppiness creates a perfect balance in the taste. It is smoother than Two-Hearted, for example, and the overall richness of the flavors makes this a top-tier brew for me. The look is a nice golden hue with hints of amber (again, balance is evident). The smell is not enticing to me, the feel and, again, taste more than make up for that.

First impression on tasting was the hops, of course. The citrus and carmel sweet came after, but the hops didn't let go. I was impressed by the 20 proof factor, but wondering about how much taste that would hide. Actually, the crafting of this brew made the alc content undetectable. Yep, this one will sneak up on you. I compare this with other IPA brews that have the same flavor but with half of the kick. The head seems to go kinda quick, but with a flavor like this one, I'm good with that.

Beautiful nose, pine forest and grapefruit rinds. Significant carbonation pops the scent of hops into the room, but settles quick clinging to the glass. Complicated mouthfeel, I know it is really bitter, I can feel it at the back of my tongue near the throat where it says grapefruit/lemon but the rest of my mouth says sweet honey and more subtle fruits like peach or that weird fruit pomelo. The final taste is bitter, but not particularly dry (because I am salivating for the next sip?). This is 10%ABV? Hides it very very well under that soft bitter bubbly.  yeah, a perfect 5, this is what it takes to get one of those from my tastebuds and my nose, and any brewery that makes complicated IPA's like this gets my upvotes and money!",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",Imperial IPA,98

Tropical fruits, pine, citrus, mixed with honey and and light caramel and bready malts. Wondeful. Medium-heavy body, creamy consistency, medium carbonation, and a somewhat crisp finish.  Overall this is an amazing, aptly named, imperial assault on the enamel on my teeth. One of the great examples of the diversity of DIPAs out there. How does this rank among the other top rated DIPAs?

Freshness date says ""Bottled on 1/17/13"" meaning this is technically the freshest bottled beer I have ever had.  A - Beautiful, hazy, luminescent. The head, with a hard pour, culminates in a two-finger beast, but subsides to a thin layer that leaves some spotty sticking on the glass.  S - Honey and sweetness dominate the nose, with no hint of the 10% waiting to kick you in the ass. Maybe some pine notes.  T - Pine resin, clover honey, creamy, SWEET. Big hit of fresh cut grass. Finish is amazing with a distinct layer of fresh picked honeysuckle, specifically. It is scary how little booze I detect.  M - The velvety viscosity of this beer is off the charts. Probably having a good amount to do with the honey (I don't know how much is actually in here) rounding out the already luxurious mouth-feel of most IPAs  O - A must try, it is not for everyone, but I think this is a great beer that may not all the way live up to the hype.

287,17112,Zach136,4.3,"12oz bottle, packaged on 1/15/13 poured into a Lost Abbey Teku.  A - Light straw with a pale one finger head and excellent lacing.  S - Smells pretty damn close to a piece of watermelon bazooka bumble gum with a touch of grapefruit. Delicious!  T - I thought I had grapefruit bombs before, I hadn't. This taste like sipping grapefruit juice. It's bitter but not a ""tongue bruiser"" like the bottle promised. I don't mind, I much prefer balanced IPAs to their 1 trillion IBU counterparts. No oily flavors at all. Very very well done.  M - The only place Hopslam takes a hit from me. Very sticky mouthfeel, I prefer my DIPAs dry.  O - A very well crafted beer and a very easy drinking DIPA, but at $18 a six pack, my wallet is glad it only comes once a year.  2014 batch update. Just as my notes describe.  2015 batch update. Bottled 1/17, enjoyed 2/6  I hate to be that guy, but this years batch just doesn't compare. Head/lacing sucks, aromatics and flavor are just not there. Mouthfeel is stickier than ever.

Murky element reminiscent of being trapped under water, in an exciting ""I cant tell whats ahead of me"" kind of way. Bubbles dancing quickly from the ocean floor. Decent lacing.  Smells so rich, so piney. State Park levels of pine, hints of cinnamon and honey. Sweetness, hoppiness, citrus.  Oh. My. Could not possibly describe the flavor here, but I'll give it a shot. Hops, honey, spice, grapefruit, orange, lemon (multiple layers of citrus explode on your tongue). ABV is hidden extremely well, so is typical IPA flavors of earth and pine. Not overpowering, extremely subtle.  M - leaves your tongue feeling like it just discovered sex for the first time.

There's really not much aroma coming off this beer.  The taste is not the hop punch you'd expect, In fact I think the ibu's are pretty low for a DIPA. I get the honey along with a healthy amount of malt back here. To be honest it's not terribly complex. It's just done well and everything is nearly perfectly balanced. The alcohol is obviously present at 10% but it's hidden very well. The finish is slightly bitter orange peel that sticks around for a while after.  Carbonation is pretty moderate. Mouthfeel is just slightly sticky. Overall, it really is an awesome beer. So balanced, so tasty.

S - Powerful aroma of tropical fruits, mild clean malts, and spicy hops. Smells amazing.  T - Big blast of tropical fruits (pineapple, mango, papya) with aggressive hop bite. Manages to be tongue peelingly bitter without being sprucy or grassy. Malts lurking underneath lend a honey graham cracker sweetness, and never allow the hops to fully take over. Turns into sort of a lemon zest in the finish. Everything flawlessly integrated here, and the flavors are lush and rich. Perfection.  M - Dry finish. Medium carbonation. Body is light, but without being watery. This beer now tops my list of ""most dangerously hidden ABV"", as the alcohol is nearly unnoticeable.  O - Simply amazing from start to finish, and one of the best IPA's around. Very limited in my area, and a little expensive, but worth the trouble and expense.

S - Smells like wild and tropical fruits. Picking up some pineapple, mango, pine, and some citrus like grapefruit. Floral but doesn't seem as much as even Two Hearted which I feel I can smell a few feet away.  T - Taste is actually a nice melange between the tropical, citric and piney hops with some sweet pale malts to boot. I am getting some nice alcohol warming but for 10% it is pretty well hidden.  M - Mouthfeel is pretty smooth and slightly creamy.  O - Overall one wonders if this beer is worthy of the cult like following.

Just sweet hoppy goodness and some malt to back it up. It's nice how sweet this is without being syrupy, which a lot of more ""balanced DIPAs"" can be.  M - Smooth and creamy, ridiculously drinkable for the ABV. Right up there with the best.  O - This is one of the best balanced DIPAs I've had. It still delivers on hop flavor without becoming syrupy and too sweet. Yet there's still low bitterness. If you're new to IPAs or hoppy beers this would be great for you I'd imagine.

Fresh cut grass, resin, cat urine, pine, and dank hops form the initial aroma. Grapefruit, lime, and a touch of honey sweetness are also present.  Dulled grapefruit, orange peel, resin, and fresh cut grass open the flavor profile, with a fair amount of bready, fairly sweet toasted caramel malt carrying into a fairly bitter, biting finish. Herbal and earthy hop notes add complexity. Pine is evident in the aftertaste. Mint emerges as it warms.  Body is a touch full, with moderate carbonation, some astringency at the finish, and a significant amount of alcohol warmth.  A balance in extremes, in a sense.

The smell is just wonderful , the hops really hit you first, to me its almost fruity with a sweet malty smell in the background , very very nice and fragrant  Very mouthy beer , not overly carbonated and smooth and refreshing  Taste is out of this world to me , the hops really pop at first then a sweetness comes through that stops it just short of being a bitter beer to me. Nice and malty finish and if you let the taste linger ans swish around the alcohol really pops out in the end , but not over powering , very good mix of the three flavors coming together and making the perfect mix  Overall this beer is worth the 17.95 I paid for the 6 pack , I only wish I could get my hand on more of this.

Lacing left with each drink which made an awesome cascade down the glass.  Smell: Really powerful hop scent with the bight citrus aromas going toe to toe with the hops. There is a subtle malt/honey sweetness on the undertones. It comes off as an almost violent aroma but warms the drinker up as this brew is enjoyed.  Taste: There is a hop splash at the front of this beer which quickly yields to the honey malt sweetness. The hops linger throughout the brew, coming to a high point at the end when they ravish the palette. The sweetness comes from the honey over the citrus flavors. The 10% abv is almost entirely hidden, it provides a spicy tingle over anything else.  Mouthfeel: Very clean. The hops make it crisp feeling but provide a very pleasant aftertaste.

287,17112,Arbitrator,4.11,"EDIT: Updated for the 2013 batch. The bottle is about 10 days old, courtesy of pokgye. Thanks, Jason.  I stand by all my notes for the 2011 vintage except the aroma: it's much less billowing and aromatic than I remember from 2011. The 2012 batch was the same way for me; I'll attribute this to a nasal Lupulin Threshold Shift, if you like, but it's just not as expressive as it used to be. Still tastes great though!  2011 vintage. Chilled bottle into a glass, courtesy of Steamhead.  A: Pours a clear, mildly hazy orange/copper color with reddish tints when held to the light. The head is a generous 2 fingers when poured, but it recedes into a light film on the top. It leaves significant lacing down the glass as I drink. For the ABV, it's exceptional.  S: Pineapple, grapefruit, lemon, tangerine, and -- of all things -- a strong guava smell dominate the nose. Some lesser notes of pine hop cones and flowers. I had to search a bit for the malt, but detected delicate biscuit notes. Exquisite. It's a hop bouquet and a total delight to sniff. The aroma falls off very fast, though; even refrigerated bottles consumed over a week tracked downward.  T: As the nose predicts, citrus hops (pineapple, grapefruit, lemon, mango) dominate the taste. Biscuit malt and honey flavors in the mid-palate. The finish is a flavorful combination of grapefruit and pine. The aftertaste is all citrus bite. Very clean flavors. It's not very sweet at all. Note I'm differentiating between honey sweetness and honey flavors here; the former is fermented out, leaving a beer that is quite dry, but the latter imparts a floral taste.  M: Medium-bodied, with perfect carbonation for the style. The 10% alcohol is well-masked, although there is just the lightest burn at the end of a sip. It's a fairly dry beer. I rather like that. Just the little burn makes it lower than a perfect 5, here.  D: It's fantastic, but it lacks the pungency I remember from last year. I had this immediately upon receipt and again later next to Pliny the Younger; it doesn't measure up like it used to. I won't say it's bad, but I rearranged my top 5 a bit. I don't think I'll track down a case next year, maybe just one six-pack.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",Imperial IPA,98

287,17112,hornsup,4.27,"Fressshhhh bottle from a trade poured into a pint glass  A: Pours a light burnt orange color that is very appetizing for a DIPA and leaves about a 3/4 inch frothy head that is pure white. Leaves a gorgeous lacing as you drink it. Thumbs up  S: Smells like citrus, grapefuit, fresh pine, and an overload of hops. I'd use this as an air freshener if I could.  T: taste is a little bitter, thats why I only gave it a 4.25. Very citrusy still with a hopslam (whoaaaa) all over the place. Some slight molasses, nectarine, guava and finishing with a slight alcohol burn (to be expected of a 10%) but it is very delightful in this instance.  M: Full bodied mouthfeel, slightly oily but enjoyable. Piney hops hang around for a long time  O: Very solid. I was expecting to be blown away by this after hearing about its anticipation for so long so I suppose I was slightly disappointed but it was a fantastic DIPA. I'd still put sucks ahead of this and categorize this with Hoptimum. Would seek out again for the price.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",Imperial IPA,98

Heavily hopped nose with a large sweetness from the honey and malt. Grapefruit, orange, pine, tropical, graham cracker.  Grapefruit, orange, tropical fruit, sweet honey, and bready malt. Really nice flavor going on.  Smooth and creamy with a slightly biting bitterness. Well balanced in sweet and bitter as far as a hoppy DIPA is concerned.  Highly enjoyable.

287,17112,Ryan011235,2.93,"Poured into a Delirium snifter on 1/21/13  11645 Pkgd 1/03/13  Slightly hazy and browned honey color with a one finger head that starts a quick decline. Soapy retention and some drippy, sandy lace; neither holds up over by the end of the glass.  Hop oils and alcohol are strong on the nose; apricot, peach, pollen, hints of grapefruit and a vague notion of lemongrass. The malts are fairly neutral but in abundance, so there's a lot of sweet cracker and biscuit coming through.  The taste leads off with a moderate pine bitterness which is peppered with citric pith and rind. The hop oils ooze together; picking out distinct flavors is laborious and largely pointless. Similarly, the malts become part of the whole lending a sweetness to the concoction. Tropical booze lasts long on the finish.  Oily. The feel is so oily. It clings across the palate every which way. The body is on the high end of medium but the hop oils weight it down. The carbonation is capable; lively in conjunction with the hops but not sharp.  The first few times I had this I loved it, but year after year I try Hopslam and I keep coming to the same conclusion that it is simply ok. I like to have a pint and a bottle or two each year just for kicks, but plopping down close to $20 for a six pack just ain't gonna happen.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",Imperial IPA,98
287,17112,hustlesworth,4.22,"A- gorgeous honey apricot amber. Warm and glowing. The superior looking off white head is solid and sticky and topped with a cluster of iridescent bubbles. Lace adheres in swirls and waves.  S- things are getting interesting. Ridiculously fresh hop aroma is fuming out of the tulip. It's all manner of pungent, sweet, herbal and fruity with mandarin orange, grapefruit, pineapple, mango, apricot, white raisin, pine, juniper, lemon, and thyme. Not sure if the sweetness in the aroma has anything to do with the honey or not, cuz the malt presence is strong up in this bitch. Cookieish sesame sweet and shortbread kinda like those apricot birds nest cookies. Some sandalwood and cedar as well.  T- big crunchy hop flavor up front, savory and herbal becoming fruity. Not so intensely bracingly bitter, but so fully hopped that the first few sips make me shake my head and shiver. Loads of orange and grapefruit and pineapple with resin and white flowers. Very soft honey flavor comes through near the end alongside an enjoyable dryness. Even at 10%abv, it's nearly impossible to detect any alcohol flavor, just a little heat on the swallow. Finish is like chewing on a hop flower. Thick full hop flavor with lingering bitterness.  MF- full creamy feel with tight rolling carbonation. More coating on the palate instead of super dry and alcoholic or sticky. Perfect pleasant feeling for such an aggressive IPA.

Like the smell, a lot of floral hops, honeysuckle, citrus, biscuit, the honey is notable but not in a sweet way. M- as expected for a 10% , a little thicker but spot on. O- so my first few I've drank through the week I thought it was a bit over rated. After sitting down and picking it apart, I realize this is one of the most enjoyable IPAs I've ever had, the honey gives it a nice district flavor without making it sweet and the flavors compliment eachother perfectly.

287,17112,AmitC,4.28,"This is the first beer that i bought a case full of. As soon as i had first one, i was grossly underwhelmed. I was expecting a hop bomb, it certainly was not that. This is my fifth bottle since then.  Poured from a 12 oz bottle dated 1/3/2013. A very slight haze. Color is amber orange or exactly the honey color. Has a good two to three fingers thick pour depending on how you are pouring. Off white color. A decent lacing. Head persistence is good but not anything exceptional. A slight unclarity, but still very fine appearance. Lack of bubbles and very calm.  Aroma has been varying depending on the bottle. Sometimes hops have been very upfront, some times malty, bready sweeter tasting aroma with a good mix of hops. Floral and citrus hops are dominating. A very good malt backbone, that gives it a good soothing smoothness. A little bit of herbal spiciness to the nose as well. No alcohol whatsoever.  Taste is a slightly sweet due to upfront honey and some dry fruits may be. A very solid and sweet looking malty, bready backbone. Hops do have a strong presence, giving it some oily feel. Herbal, Citrus and slightly earthy hops dominate. Bitterness is there in the aftertaste, but not worthy of a name like Hopslam. Not tongue biting or anything. An IIPA, that imo will be appreciated by those who do not like overly hoppy beers. A very well balanced finish that fails to give prominence to anything be it malts, hops, honey or alcohol. A nice blend of everything is what makes this beer great.  Mouth feel is on the medium side. A lot of oily and resiny feel that is very much appreciated. Low on carbonation is another good thing. Complete lack of any astringency. Alcohol is very well hidden for a 10% ABV. Smooth as hell and drinks very easy. This makes it a dngerous beer to have a plenty of. You consume a lot of alcohol without feeling anything. You realize only when your head is dizzy. Definitely will make the head spin, if you have two in a row.  The USP here is balance and smoothness, which you won't find in the best of IIPAs, that makes it a winner. Personally there are much better Imperials than this, but this one is one of the smoothest thing that i have had overall.

287,17112,sitarist,4.62,"A- Pours a light honey color, yellow with an orange hue.  S- Grapefruit, some spice, orange peel, pineapple. It kind of smells like a citrus milk shake. Something, probably the honey reminds me of ice cream.  T- Apricot, orange rind and seeds. Pine, resiny, there is a sweet aftertaste. Alcohol is very well hidden.  M- Medium body, light carbonation that explodes then quickly fades, no alcohol burn, slightly astringent.  D- Pretty drinkable, alcohol is transparent, sweet, sticky.  Update 1-14-11: This years batch is just as hoppy as last years batch.  1-11-12: Better than ever. I really am enjoying this years batch, especially on tap.

Expectations are high, but reserved.  A- Half-finger white head with a surprising amount of retention for the high ABV. Soapy, wet lacing slides down the glass. Dusky amber color with medium-high clarity. Light carbonation.  S- Grapefruit and citrusy hops battles with sweet honey tones for the strongest smell in the beer. The aroma is not sharp or overpowering, but subtle and enticing. Some pepper, pine, and tropical fruits are present in small amounts. Hides alcohol extremely well. Could be perfect if the hops were just a tad more pronounced, but very nice nonetheless.  T- Alcohol definitely is more present than in the bouquet. Citrusy and piney hops, with relatively thick hop oil. Honey is present in small amounts. Highly drinkable, but not world-endingly good. Balanced quite well between sweet and bitter.  M- Semi-oily, balances well on the tongue and finishes wet and slightly alcoholic.  O- Complex flavor and smell which hides the alcohol content, very nice feel.

The lacing on this puppy is incredible. Completely sticks to the entire glass for the full duration of the drink.  S: Pine and hops. I get total citrusy melon and pineapple hints. Underlying all of it is the dominating honey smell.  T: Hoppy. The citrus whiffs come through in the taste. The thing that blows my mind with this one is how well the 10% ABV is hidden. The balance of sweetness from the honey and hop bitterness is pretty incredible.  M: Sticky! I would say it's a little more full than a typical DIPA - definitely. Creamy.  O: The honey is much more present in 2013 than 2012, but I like it. The sweetness comes through without losing any hoppiness. A 10% ABV brew should not be ""seshy"" but this one is darn close.

After your done drinking, the pine flavor sits perfectly on your tongue for a few minutes.  M: low carbonation which makes it crisp, but it also has a certain fullness to it.  O: Such a tasty beer.

You can smell the hops immediately. Light citrus scents hit your nose then your palate prior to a light bitterness. Almost a sweet bitterness.

The hops are present throughout, with a wonderful fresh taste, and good bittering hops as well. On the maltier side, not surprising given the ABV, but really nicely balanced and enjoyable.  Feel: Good carbonation, pretty dry. Not quite as smooth and creamy as my gold standard Heady Topper but very easy to drink. Much lighter than expected for the ABV. No heat whatsoever in this one.

287,17112,Efay,4.14,"Got a sixer today and had to try the craze. Poured in a pint glass.  A- Not so much head, only about a finger worth and there is not much retention. Whats left of the head is a light layer of white foam over the body. Now the beer was light amber in color, and transparent. Carbonation bubbles rose to the top from the bottom. A beautiful beer.  S- Pine is dominant, but is complimented with sweet tangerine and honey. There's a hint of light malt at the end, but it is very minor.  T- When I took my first sip, I had a rush of hops that attacked my palate, which dried up my whole mouth. This thing bites! Pine, pine, and more pine; this hop attack is ruthless. Some honey comes through, as well as some citrus, but the pine just dominates this. Even when my mouth is empty, my palate has this bitter aftertaste.  M- This beer is dangerously smooth and light.  O- This beer packs a punch! If you're a hophead you have to get your hands on this. However, I believe that a good beer isn't rated on just its IBU, and beers need a medium of flavors.

287,17112,SerialTicker,4.59,"2/28/15 Note: Got a 32oz growler of this stuff and I'm drinking a pint right now -- yes ma'am, this is a marvelous brew. Didn't have it out of a bottle this year, but it was fabulous on-tap. I've knocked up the feel rating by half a point... man, what a beautiful freakin' beer.  RE-RE-REVIEW: Had this on-tap at One-Eyed Betty's in Ferndale, Michigan. I wasn't super impressed at first, but it was also insanely cold when served to me. As it warmed up, it got better and tasted better than I remember when I had it last year. Nice feel, fantastic aroma, great candied fruit kind of hop flavor with a very nice malt presence. I wasn't as blown away as when I first had it, but I liked it quite a lot more than I did last year.  RE-REVIEW: Bottled 12/20/13 and poured 2/13/14, so it's not the freshest bottle.  Appearance: Just as I remember. Beautiful golden color. Slight haze. Two finger head leaves lots of lacing. Maybe the best beer I've ever seen. (5/5)  Smell: Also as I recall. Massive tropical fruits with a particularly peachy ""aftersmell."" Plenty of honey sweetness. (4.75/5)  Taste/feel: Not what I remember, and that pains to say. It's a 2mo old bottle, but the taste is so much different than I remember it being. Sweet peach sort of flavor on the front with a bit of tropical fruit flavor and a decent sweetness, and then a throw of bitterness with malt at the finish. I recall Hopslam drinking like honey, hop, nectary goodness with flawless balance. This is a disappointment in comparison. Alcohol is warming in the belly, which is fine, but also in the flavor as well. I recall it being well hidden. This truthfully tastes like a different beer. Good? Hell yeah, it's still a good beer, but this isn't nearly as unbelievable as I initially thought. Mouth feel is a bit thinner as well. Beer's not tasting as sweet -- again, more bitter with alcohol not very well hidden. A decent bit better as it warms. (4.25/5, 3.75/5)  Well, that's that. I understand this bottle is two months old, but I don't believe Hopslam would change so dramatically. What I loved so much about Hopslam when I had it last year was its awesome honey sweetness and ability to hide its alcohol. I'm left unhappy with this beer compared to my initial opinion. Still, this outshines most in the style. I'll have to try it again next year. I like it a lot, but I've had better for cheaper.  (4.25/5) / 4.34/5  ORIGINAL REVIEW: Bottled 1/03/13, poured into a Sam Adams Perfect Pint  Appearance: I'm just not used to seeing such a high ABV beer have such a sexy head and with such beautiful lacing. The beer APPEARS filtered, and has a perfectly clear amber/gold color. (4.75/5)  Smell: Absolutely stunning. Super grapefruitty from the hops, but then there's plenty of honey sweetness... smells like candy. (5/5)  Taste/feel: The taste is just... the score's justified, put it that way. I didn't think beer could taste this good. It's got a super nice bitter bite , but the honey and malts mellow it out. As I've seen other people say, Hopslam isn't really an appropriate name for this beer, because it's actually incredibly balanced ... the honey flavor is utterly outstanding. The mouthfeel is also among the best I've had in any beer. Extremely smooth, lightly carbonated, and just a delight. I'm assuming the smoothness in this can be contributed to the honey that the beer's brewed with. Holy God is it great... I'd also have no idea that this was 10%, as it drinks like a 7%. (4.75/5, 5/5)  Truthfully, the perfect IPA. It's super hoppy like a DIPA ought to be, but the amount of honey makes this beer drink and, as I said, smell like a candy. I may have now found a favorite beer. Makes me proud to live in Michigan.  (4.75/5)",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",Imperial IPA,98

As the nectar exits the bottle and penetrates the crystal clean glass there is no mistaking that my future is one of pleasure. Just the right texture and just the right color is followed by nothing but the best head. Being patient and allowing time to enjoy the head proves worthwhile as I tip the glass, drawing it ever nearer my lips, that quiver with anticipation, that relieve themselves of all hydration and all memory of previous excitement, in further anticipation of what is to come.  The sensation as the cool glass touches my lips, followed quickly by the rushing wave of ecstasy too sweet to call bitter, my tongue explodes forth.

287,17112,emyers,4.59,"12 oz. bottle poured into a Founders snifter. Bottled on 1/2/13.  This is the beer that really got me hooked on IPA's. Finally doing a full review.  Appearance - Pours a clear, deep gold with a two finger fuffy white head. Head dissipates fairly quickly, but leaves a nice lacing down the glass.  Smell - Impressive. Tons of grapefruit up front with a healthy dose of floral hops, followed by more layers of citrus, some papaya, and just a touch of honey. The honey is not nearly as noticeable as some have said, and this one is really all hops. The hop profile is complex and powerful, yet extremely clean.. Honestly nothing I would change.  Taste - Brings the same great grapefruit/floral hop character as the aroma. Strong and clean, but not quite as explosive as in the aroma. Bitterness is very restrained, and this is what really differentiates it from other DIPA's. It's all about the hop flavor and aroma, but without that in-your-face bitterness, which can be good or bad depending on what you're looking for. That slight hint of honey comes back in the finish (although it may just be floral hops and in my head, as logic tells me the honey would all ferment out).  Mouthfeel: It definitely has some body to it, but still finishes very crisp and dry. Medium carbonation. Dries out the palate and leaves you craving more as it goes down.  Overall: Phenomenal. Again, if you're looking for a DIPA with huge hop bitterness, look elsewhere (I would recommend Surly Abrasive). But in my opinion this offers one of the best overall hop profiles out there.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",Imperial IPA,98

287,17112,Jugs_McGhee,4.01,"12 fl oz brown glass bottle with standard pressure cap served into a conical pint glass. Expectations are high given its incredible reputation. 10% ABV. Bottled 01/02/13 (11 days old). Thanks to Britta for bringing the bottle from Ann Arbor.  Served straight from the fridge and allowed to warm slightly over the course of consumption. Side-poured with standard vigor as no carbonation issues are anticipated.  A: Pours a 1.5 finger beige colour head of slight cream, fair thickness, and incredible retention for the high ABV (~5 minutes). Body colour is a transparent copper; it's not particularly vibrant but I wouldn't call it dull. Translucent. No yeast particles are visible. No bubble show . It's par for the style, but it isn't as appealing as other beers in the style I've seen.  Sm: Hops: nectary, floral, pine, grapefruit, honey, effervescent crystal malt, perfumey hop oil, bright fruit (mango and some light tropical fruit), caramel. There's a lot going on here, and the hop bitterness is well concealed. Lots of depth and diversity. No yeast character is detectable, nor is any alcohol. I'd like more of the oily hop notes. A bit of grassy character emerges on the climax, joining the fruit. The honey comes off very raw; it's not at all too sweet. A fairly strong aroma, and a pleasant appealing one. Definitely different from the aromas I'm used to in beers of the style, but I don't know that it's necessarily an improvement. I can't wait to try it.  T: Ah. A perfect balance of honey and pale malt sweetness with nectary hop notes, bright fruit, and floral character. Sticky and sweet - but never overly so. Nectary hop notes dominate. I'd like more pine from it, but what little is there is well balanced. Not as heavy on the grapefruit as many beers in the style - and rightly so; it works to ensure the hop bitterness is well concealed. A bit grassy and oily. Light caramel rides beneath. Bold pale malts give it the refreshing effective body it needs. No alcohol comes through until the warmth hits me in the stomach; this one is dangerously drinkable. Not at all soapy like many problematic beers in the style; they brought this out of primary just in time. I expected a bitter hop bomb, but Bell's remembered to balance the flavours, and the result is a great Double IPA. Loads of complexity and seamless subtlety make this one a real treat.  Mf: Sticky, nectary, slick, and coating. Perfect thickness and carbonation. Quite oily. Feels custom-tailored to the flavour profile. Smooth and wet. Near perfect execution; bravo, Bells.  Dr: Dangerously drinkable for the high ABV. It delivers hops, but more importantly it delivers balance. I could down it all night, and I'd be happily knackered by night's end. This Double IPA will satisfy hop cravings, but it isn't the bitter hop bomb it markets itself as. It is in fact a balanced, very enjoyable Double IPA that I'd love to have again (preferably on-draught). Does it live up to its reputation? I'm not floored, but it is fantastic. It's not the best beer I've had in the style, but it's certainly one of them. Well priced in Michigan at $18 a six pack. Constructively, it could use more depth of flavour, but I'm nitpicking.  Would pair incredibly well with spicy food.  A-  * 01/21/17 impression from a can ($24 per 6 pack in New York - yikes!):  Delicate honey. Glimmer of honeydew melon.  Balanced through and through, with pale malt sweetness just present enough to take the bitter edge of the heavily floral hopping.  Ludicrously drinkable for 10% ABV (I think the kids are saying ""crushable"" these days).  Surprisingly light-bodied. Nice push-pull between coarseness and smoothness, tugging towards the coarse side without being dragging or rough. Not oily, gushed, hot, boozy, astringent, harsh, or scratchy.  A fine imperial IPA, though I remembered it better. Call it batch variation, can vs bottle variation, or call it me being inconsistent, but my impressions this time around aren't quite as favorable - good though this undeniably is.  B / GOOD  * 01/22/17 CAN:  Glowing gold-copper body. Obviously filtered. White frothy head.  Aroma entices with hints of fresh honey, bright floral notes, nectary hops, and resins alongside a kiss of citrus. Surprisingly mild aromatically, but attractive and suggestive of a balanced brew.  Ludicrously drinkable owing to its impeccable balance, with delicate subtle fresh honey sweetness joining pale malts to oppose any hop bitterness. The result is a terrific brew that hides all hop bitterness yet retains all hop flavours, showcasing its hops wonderfully and finishing coating and a little sweet without ever feeling syrupy or cloying. Finishes with an impression of hop oils.  Dangerously good. I find myself inhaling it, its 10% ABV of no consequence. Terrific work from very talented brewers.  B+ / VERY GOOD  * 2018: B  * 2019: B * 2020: High B- * 2021 (bottle): A-",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",Imperial IPA,98

T - Moderate amounts of grapefruit up front, followed by tons of pine and malt. No mango comes through and the malt sticks around after the finish.  M - Medium chewy body with moderate carbonation.  O - Overall, a great DIPA, but not as legendary as what everybody makes it out to be. This one goes to 11 beats it any day.  UPDATE AS OF 7/25/2015.

287,17112,JamesMN,4.35,"Date on bottle 01/03/13.  Appearance: Wonderful golden honey color with incredible clarity. A one finger off-white head has dissipated into a thin bubbly film atop the beer. One of the best looking beers I've seen, looks very succulent.  Aroma: Interesting but not very strong. Pine layered with honey. Also hints of mango and peach hop characteristics. A touch of rubbing alcohol.  Taste: A decently complex brew with flavor shifts throughout. Starts with a sweet bitterness that becomes more and more intense adding in a distinct pine flavor about halfway through. The end and finish give throw in addition hop flavors of citrus and grapefruit but they can be hard to detect. Each sip ends with a big blast of bitterness that lingers for a long time. Despite how bitter it is (somewhere in the ballpark of 80 IBUs), Hopslam actually maintains a near perfect balance with a pleasantly malty undertone. Most of the 10% ABV is hidden but the finish does give way to a moderate heat in the back of the throat.  Mouthfeel: Just below full in body and somehow not syrupy. It would be quite easy to chug this down which is surprising given the style. Just very smooth overall.  Final Thoughts: To someone who's new to IPAs or DIPAs they may think Hopslam tastes like a liquid pine tree. However, a more informed palate would note that it strikes a near perfect balance in flavor and delivers a pleasant drinking experience. Would I drink it again? Hell yes, it is deserving of its near legendary status in the world of craft beer.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",Imperial IPA,98

287,17112,rodlavers,4.72,"This beer is very dear to me. I first had it last year, in both draft and bottle format, in that order. As I recall, at first I liked Hopslam on draft more than I liked it in the bottle. I was actually put-off somewhat by the super fresh bottle I had, just after I had it on draft. After a few weeks, my case obviously depleted but over time, the bottled beer really changed quite a bit, read, it got better after a few weeks. At the time I was aware of the freshness concern with Hopslam, but for me it tasted better after lets say, 2-5 weeks, and after that I ADORED it, could not get enough of it, and then it was gone. Fast forward about 11 months. Received word that Bell's had bottled Hopslam on 01/02/13, and pretty randomly decided to drive about 8 hours to Kalamazoo to buy some for me and my friends, mostly because we did not want to wait the three or so weeks for it reach out area, A, and B, we were/are not sure how much we will actually be able to purchase here. So I went to Bell's and got plenty for me and my friends, a case a piece. Anyway, this review will at some points refer to my recent experience at the Eccentric Cafe, but for scoring purposes, relies solely on the experience I am having right now with a 9-day old bottle of Hopslam. At the Cafe, over a period of two days, I probably had 5 12-16oz. pours of delicious Hopslam. It appeared hazy/foggy, and tasted and smelled unfuckingbelievable.  In terms of the bottle I am enjoying right at this very instant, I poured it medium strength into a perfect pint glass, leaving a bit over a finger of really white head, some bubbles, lots of lacing, I am literally staring at lacing right now. In contrast to the draft pour, this bottle pour is super translucent. It actually caught me off guard at first. It is a combination of gold, orange, tangerine, and yellow in color. In other words, quite distinct from the draft pour.  Smell is amazing. I really enjoy the blend of honey, pine resin, citrus, slight malt, and admittedly some booziness.  The taste is similarly immaculate in my humble opinion. Less citrus-forward, more honey sweetness with pine, some sweet orange, resin, malt combination combining to make a delightful experience on the taste buds. Slightly bitter feel, smooth hop finish. Medium carbonation and I am guessing not over-powering IBU's.  Overall, Hopslam is amazing. Having enjoyed both formats, draft and bottle, I am grateful for the experience. Over the last year, it has made me chase ""honey beers"" only to be disappointed. Bell's did a great job, and I feel like this year is better than last. Please find the chance to sample this excellent brew. It is definitely different, draft v. bottle, and I think it's hitting its stride right now, 9-10 days in. Glad I have a chance to drink 1/day for the next 2.5 weeks, and hopefully I can grab some more to see how it changes after several weeks. Again, must try. Cheers.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",Imperial IPA,98
287,17112,tobelerone,4.3,"Pours dark gold with a small head and a moderate amount of lace. A small cream colored ring remains around the top of the beer. Good clarity. Lovely aroma; pungent hoppiness; resinous, slightly oniony; some citrus and pine qualities.  Has a slightly tongue scathing bitterness to the flavor; again very resinous, with grass, pine, citrus, and onion characteristics, and a surprisingly dry finish after hearing much about this beer's honeyed taste; I found there was little in the way of sweetness at all, really. After the swallow the bitterness lingers a bit but recedes enough so as not to be obnoxious or overbearing; you are left with the sense of a powerful beer, both in terms of hops and alcohol, although the latter is well masked during drinking.  Medium body and carbonation, almost light for this style. This is a top notch DIPA, sure, but not perhaps in the class of the other heavy hitters of the genre; lacks the intricacy of Heady Topper and the refinement of Pliny, to cite two examples. But still dusts the vast majority of the competition.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",Imperial IPA,98

The smell was phenomenal, I think this year's hopslam was much more well balanced than last years. Less Malt, more hops, and floral undertones this year I think.

Aroma is a huge dose of flowers and sweet honey, followed by orange and other citrus. Amazing.  Taste is also honey forward, sweet but also with a powerful hop presence with tons of flowers, light spice, moderate citrus.  Mouthfeel is great, extremely well carbonated, extremely drinkable.  This is a damn good beer, and very unique among the big DIPAs for being so sweet without sacrificing its hoppiness or drinkability.  9.1/10",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",Imperial IPA,98
287,17112,Gobzilla,4,"A: poured an amber brown in color with pale yellow highlights and a nice half finger of head that left some good bubbly lacing sticking to the glass.  S: kinda dissapointed on the aroma due to lots of malty sweetness upfront, the honey is apparent, with signs of green citrusy hops, a little of the grains coming through and hints of earthy grass.  T: once again the malty sweetness character was also leading the way on the palate alongside grassy earhty notes, very mild hop profile with citrusy grapefruit, honey accents, and flavor of variety of grains in the background.  M: the brew was medium in body with a good amount of carbonation which had a sweet, malty, grassy, mildly hoppy very slight bitter and crisp finish.  O: honestly don't know what all the hype is about this beer cause it's just an average DIPA and mild all around at that.

287,17112,kell50,4.34,"Poured 12 oz. bottle (dated 2/3/2013) into my OMB snifter glass.  A: It pours a relatively clear light red/amber color with about a finger head that dissipated into excellent lacing.  S: I was expecting a big hop aroma the moment I popped and poured this beer, but it didn't arrive. I did notice some faint citrusy hops, but the brewer's addition of honey really stood out to me. I was hoping for a bit more.  T: Wow. Major improvement from where I thought this beer was heading off the nose. A bitter punch of hops at first followed by the sweetness of honey. There's plenty of floral and citrus hops on the finish with a crisp, clean malt balance. The bottle says 10%, but it extremely well hidden.  M: A medium bodied beer with small compacted bubbles constantly rising. Nice and smooth as it goes down. It finishes clean like a Pilsner, but unlike a Pils your left with a bitter palate.  O: I'm always one of those people who think this beer is SOOO over hyped, that Bell's couldn't possibly put together a beer like this year after year- but they have.

287,17112,tectactoe,4.53,"Had on tap at Bell's Brewery in Kalamazoo, MI, also many times out of the bottle. Pours a golden, light-amber with a moderate amount of haze to it, micro particles sift through the brew upon which a two-finger, creamy, light beige head rests and leaves nice amounts of fuzz on the glass. The aroma of this beer hits your nose mid-pour. Up close, things begin to get magical. Humongous citrus aromas; grapefruit, pineapples, tangerines, lemon zest - a wild, sweet, fruity explosion crowds your nostrils. Mild resinous, pine, and hop aromas make their way in as well - after all, this is HOPslam. The nose is absolutely brilliant and does nothing but get you excited to finally bring this one to your lips.  Take one sip - BOOM. MF'ing hop slammed. The hop bill is one of the finest and most robust out there, and you'll realize that when you finally gulp this sweet nectar. Piney, oily, resinous and slightly dank hops will seize your palate and engulf your taste buds immediately. This bitterness here is certainly dominant, but in the best way possible. After some time, some more floral and perfume-like aromas and tastes emerge, just icing on the already delicious hop cake. The heavy hop flavors are much more pronounced on the palate than in the aroma, which is to be expected. The citrus is not to be forgotten, either - it resides just under the thick layer of hoppy goodness; more pineapples, grapefruits, orange and lemon zest... Just thinking about it makes my mouth water.  Not picking up much malt, if any at all. But at this point - who cares? This beer wasn't made for the malt. There's enough to give it some kind of a backbone, but that's about it. Any other non-pale malts were probably in very small quantity and just for the color. This beer is about the HOPS, anyways, and any malt distraction would do nothing but make me angry. The end of the sip and a touch of the aftertaste contains an extra dollop of sweetness - could this be from the honey, perhaps? It's hard to pick any actual ""honey"" flavors amidst the hop assault, but the sweetness of Hopslam doesn't go unnoticed and gets more vibrant as the beer gets warmer. Definitely a subtle, unobtrusive addition that sets Hopslam apart from other DIPAs even more so. The mouth is wet, slick, and on the thicker side, though not as lumpy as you may expect a 10% ABV beer to be. Carbonation is spot on, letting the flavors pop without being abrasive.  Hopslam is, simply put, one of the best DIPAs in the world. A fantastic hop profile that gives off an orgasmic aroma and a wonderfully complex yet drinkable flavor profile. Despite the 10% ABV, the alcohol does nothing more than provide a teeny, tiny bit of warmth. One of the most drinkable DIPAs you'll ever find. If you're looking for a hop explosion, look no further - get yourself some HOPSLAM.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",Imperial IPA,98
287,17112,JimsArcade,4.33,"(Taken from notes of sampling in Feb. 2012.)  Pours a nice medium-light amber with decent head. Aroma is surprisingly muted for an IIPA.

287,17112,JamesShoemaker,4.36,"12 oz bottle poured into a snifter and a wine glass. Bottled a mere eleven days ago.  A - nice oranges and reds, pours a finger foam on a forced pour, cream colored residual lacing. Semi-transparent.  S - extremely crisp, clean, and citrusy. Not unlike other DIPAs, but still a prominent feature. Lingering grapefruit, lemon/lime, and other citrus fruits. No alcohol to speak of, but behind the other monstrous smells that's unsurprising.  T - the honey blends in very nicely with the citrus, which is somewhat unexpected. Unlike some IPAs and DIPAs, Hopslam doesn't leave you with the bitter rind of the fruit. Starts with a nice, clean burst of oranges and finishes mellow and sweet, probably attributable to the honey.  M - it doesn't taste especially carbonated, but I have a difficult time differentiating between the bite of citrus and overly carbonated beer. It burns the cheeks when you leave it in your mouth for more than a second, but otherwise it's light, which is remarkable considering the high alcohol content. No syrupy taste, just very pure.  O - I've had this four or five years in a row now, but this is my first batch since I've really gotten into craft. It definitely doesn't disappoint.

Sweet malted grain, honey, and an explosion of citric hops. Hop filled finish, strong taste of alcohol. Smooth and creamy mouthfeel- One of the most drinkable IIPA's i have ever had.

I'm realizing this is about the best DIPA I've ever had at or above 10% abv. I admit I didn't expect the honey to play as big a role in the flavor as it does. I'm going to sip this one slow and savor it. It feels quite thick, as though it should due to that honey aspect of the brew. Sticky as it begins to warm. Although in the end I prefer more piney/ pineapple/ citrus flavored DIPAs over this, Bell's did as good a job as I can imagine anyone can do with regards to marrying honey to beer and having it all balance out with the big hop flavors like this. For me, the honey gave me the impression of an elixir, but in a very good way. My wife, who hates beer, was on hand and I had her sip this. I asked if she tasted the honey. ""No"" she said...""but I smelled it"". Then I asked ""well, what does it taste like?"" ..she said ""beer... bitter"", as she made her usual unpleasant face as she always does after reluctantly trying beer. I then took a couple more sips as it's even warmer now, and there's orange citrus in there too. Syrupy. For a big imperial IPA, sweet. But for what I understand this retails for, this is very good bang for your buck. ",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",Imperial IPA,98
287,17112,AdamCzap,5,"A: beautiful, golden color S: smells like honey and sweetness T: explosion of flavors in your mouth! Very hoppy, but also has an acceptable amount of sweet taste that balances well with the bitterness. The after taste of this beer just leaves me wanting to drink more of it.  This is truly a world class beer. It's also very expensive and usually costs around $16-$20 for a 6 pack! However, at 10.5% abv, you get what you pay for in alcohol content and exquisite taste.  If I were stranded on an island and only had one beer I could take with me (along with food, of course ;)), this would be it. Well done, Bell's. Of course it would have to be on tap because this stuff is LEGIT coming from a keg. Bottles are good too, but this beer really shines on tap.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",Imperial IPA,98
287,17112,srv33,4.75,"Finally, I get to do a full written review of this incredible brew. Pours a nice honey color, with an inch foam head, beautiful lacing. The scent is wonderful, well balanced citrus, hops, and honey. The taste is, oh my, incredible. This is definitely one of my top beers, for sure. It hits hard, but is perfectly balanced in such a way as to not reveal much alcohol taste at all. Honey, hops, and citrus dominate the taste in a wonderful array on the tongue that is neither too biting nor too quick to leave, it unfolds on the palate revealing the complexity of the hops. If you can find this, don't hesitate to pick some up.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",Imperial IPA,98

Leaves really fantastic lacing.  Smell: Huge burst of tropical fruits up front, followed by some citrus fruits. A very strong honey aspect comes through as well.  Taste: Big tropical citrus, pineapple, and mango, followed by a big honey sweetness. Doesn't so much balance and just make the beer feel 'bigger.' Some nice citrus bitterness. Finishes sticky and sweet with honey and hop resin.  Mouthfeel: Insanely drinkable for 10%, but with a hint of booze on the finish, especially as it warms. Medium bodied.  Overall: This beer definitely wowed me fresh. If it wasn't for the price point, I'd buy this all the time.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",Imperial IPA,98

This year I was able to get a case, but last year we got the mini kegs too. This is my favorite American DIPA, period.  A - It pours slightly thick and viscous for an IPA, with a golden brown color.  S - The smell is of sweet honey and piny / floral delicious hops.  T - There is nothing that tastes quite like Hopslam. The hop presence is HUGE and it hits you up front with pine and citrus. But, there is a deliciously sweet honey flavor that balances it all out and makes it a deceptively strong beer, at 10%.  M - The mouth feel is sweet, sticky, and thick. The hops will linger on your palate for a while too, but I didn't want them to go away.  O - Overall, after writing this review, I already wish I had some more.

I didn't realize it was available this late in the year.  appears a hazy orange copper color with small white head. hoppy aroma is fruity - I pick up a lot of pineapple. taste is actually fairly balanced with caramel malt, finishes hoppy though. medium body and carbonation works for the beer. A bit of booziness, but in a good way.  overall - honestly I was expecting more based on it's reputation. A very good DIPA, and I'd certainly seek it out again. But not a top ten for me.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",Imperial IPA,98
287,17112,rundocrun,4.69,"Bottle date of 1/25/12, so nearly 5 months on this one. Poured into pint glass.  A - A half finger of fine white head forms. Body is deep honey and amber. Cloudy. Not sure if it's chill haze or the natural appearance of the beer. Retention is decent. Minimal lacing.  S - Citrus bomb. Tons of lemon and orange peel. Some sharper resiny and grapefruit notes as well. Grassy, slightly bready, and hints of tropical fruit.  T - Malt is noticeable up front. Caramely and sweet. I also get some mango, lemongrass and pine flavor toward the front. Slightly more tangy, spicy and bitter toward the middle. Bitterness really takes hold on the sides and back of the tongue, but doesn't destroy my palate. Juicy, hoppy, and lemony finish. What I feel sets this DIPA apart, though, is its incredible balance. There is a definite smooth malty backbone that holds its own all the way through the finish.  M - Medium-to-thick body. However, it is most definitely not syrupy and cloying. The finish is quite clean semi dry. Incredibly refreshing for such a big beer. Boozy warmth is just barely noticeable.  Overall - The guys and gals at Bell's should be congratulated on this one. I can tell a lot of careful thought went into selecting the ingredients for this beer (rather than just chucking a ton of different hops into a strong pale ale base).",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",Imperial IPA,98
287,17112,THANAT0PSIS,4.83,"Appearance: Wow, this is a gorgeous beer. The color is a deep, rich gold, almost approaching an amber/copper color that is reasonably cloudy. The cream-colored, three finger thick rocky pillow of head that crowns this beer is the icing on the cake; though it does eventually subside into a much more manageable one finger, the foam takes its sweet time crawling down the glass and leaves a bit of lacing in its wake. This beer also sports some alcohol legs, though they are not very obvious, which is surprising at a massive 10% ABV.  Smell: Citrus, honey, pine resin, and just a whiff of alcohol simply pours out of the mouth of the glass, taking over any and all air above or around it. It is very densely hoppy, and really quite a pleasing (and perhaps sweet) smell. At the very tail end there is just a hint of apple.  Taste: This is such a dense and complex beer; it is a real challenge for the palate, in a very, very good way. The hops are there up front and pack a punch, but it is merely a glancing blow as the honey really balances this DIPA out. After that, in a surprise for an Imperial IPA (at least in this reviewer’s experiences), the malt comes through, adding a strong caramel flavor. Finally, the honey comes back, quickly followed by a second round with the hops, which the beer ends on. There is a bit of rind in the final bout with the hops, which adds a welcome astringency and forces the mouth to water.  Mouthfeel: ""Thick"" is the word for this beer. It is practically syrup sliding down the drinker’s throat and leaves the sticky residue one would expect. It isn’t overly fizzy, but it is still refreshing. After only a brief appearance in the nose, and a no-show in the taste, the alcohol finally sneaks its way into the mix by giving a very pleasant warming feeling as the glass empties.  Overall: This is a personal favorite of this reviewer, and it never fails to satisfy. It really has everything a drinker looks for in this style, plus an amazing addition in the honey, which balances this into one of the most drinkable DIPAs on the market. One must be very careful drinking these because of the ease that they keep going down, and the hurting another six-pack will put on the pocketbook. 19/20",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",Imperial IPA,98

M- Medium bodied, well balanced between hops and honey, abv very well hidden, finishes smooth.  O- This was a very good DIPA that's a little bit different then the Northeast IPAs I'm used to due to the addition of the honey.

A: Poured to a one-and-a-half fingers of light khaki head that disapated into a thin layer after a few minutes and left a good lacing as the glass emptied. The brew is a golden orange and cloudy.  S: The aroma is a citrus and floral hops equally balanced with a sweet honey and malt.  T: It begins with a robust bitterness and then some citrus and floral hops with a mild honey sweetness and a slightly sweet and bready malt that is just enough to take the edge off the bitterness. There is also an alcohal heat the compliments the bitter nops bite.  M: The body is medium to heavy with a light carbonation. A very satisfying mouthfeel.  O: An outstanding robust IPA. Great hops bite and bitterness with just enough malt sweetness to take the harsh edge off the bitterness. The honey sweetness also fits well and adds a unique flavor.

287,17112,markmiller,4.12,"Got this at IP trade, but the bottled on date is December 2011. I've decided to post my initial reactions and then revisit this review when I'm able to get this fresh. (Because it was old, but still pretty damn great)  The pour produces a nice orangey beer that isn't fully opaque, but not translucent either. Nice foamy white head that leaves some sticky lacing.  The smell of this beer is mouthwatering. The citrus dominates, but there is a sweet malt aroma that keeps this in check.  Obviously the hops were the first thing that I tasted, but I didn't get that solid kick I expected, and I feel that the age of the beer affected the quality. The pine and citrus flavors were there, but there seemed to be too much sweetness for what I expected this to be, and how others reviews have pointed out.  Beware of the ABV, because all the people I had try this one we're shocked at the mellow flavor and no presence of alcohol on the tongue.  I was also surprised at how low key the bitterness level is. Quite amazing as I expected an almost tannin-like bitterness to dry my tongue.  I read all about how hardly anything can beat fresh Hopslam, and I have reason to believe those people are on to something.

Some presence of alcohol evident, but not really prominent...a bit more drinkable (going faster) than other DIPA's. Mouthfeel is substantial, with moderate to heavy, active carbonation. Another delicious one from Bell's and recommended again.  Revised, fresher review: OK, so I'm trying an eight day old Hopslam, and I've changed my mind. I wish I could have one of these every day.

Very thin white head dissipates almost instantly to not much more than a tiny crown. Sips & swirls create only a minimal amount of spotty short-term lacing. Excellent clarity. Color & clarity attempt to make up for the lacking head.  S- Big fruity hop aroma, more tropical than citrus. Light piney hops. All balanced by a big residual malt & honey sweetness. Very complex and pleasing aroma. Only a tiny amount of alcohol detected, becomes more evident near the very end of the glass as it has warmed to near room temperature. Aroma also becomes sweeter as it warms and the hop aroma fades.  T- Initially sweet, then comes the rush of juicy hops and bitterness. I'm sure the IBUs are off the charts on this beer but the persistent sweetness restrains the bitterness to something completely manageable. Finishes with a nice lingering bitterness and some light pale malt and honey sweetness. Also get a little bit of some lingering citrusy hops in the finish. An amazingly complex flavor with every aspect melding extremely well. The hop flavor is even harder to pin-point than the hop aroma although I do get a little more pine off the flavor than the aroma. Only slightly boozy.  M- Medium carbonation, medium-full bodied, slightly heavy on the palate but not overbearing.  O- Fantastic beer, but as a DIPA named ""Hopslam"" I would expect a less ""balanced"" beer. The back of the bottle reads: ""A biting, bitter, tongue bruiser of an ale."" This is a bit of a stretch. Don't get me wrong, this is a BIG hoppy beer but the amount of residual malt & honey sweetness definitely detracts from the huge complex bitter hop profile. At 10%, this beer goes down with some ease, it would be real easy to get carried away with a few of these.

287,17112,biegaman,4.09,"A cloudy, deep golden colour, Hopslam looks like honey. It has little carbonation and can appear almost sludgy depending on the angle. No head ever forms. The highlighting is dulled too, despite that it is light enough to allow moderate transparency.  Some IPAs simulate the effect of sniffing a baggie of hops; this IPA simulates standing dead center of a hop farm. You'd think you were submerged under an entire Pacific Northwest harvest. I don't like taking my nose out of the glass - I'll need a snorkel if I'm to drink this again. It is minty, herbal, and showcasing a lot of lime fruit.  The taste has pungency and a good amount of spice. That said, it is considerably less bitter than it let's on. The honey is surprisingly appreciable. Flavors of honeycomb and toffee are, believe it or not, more pronounced than the hops' contributions of leaf, lime, and pine. There's as much toasted caramel as there is grapefruit or flower petal.  The mouth feels privy to a lot of bark, rind, and resin - all goods features so far as IPAs are concerned. It is dry and to the uninitiated might feel like pine flavored sand paper as it runs over the palate. There's a dosage of alcohol esters noted as well, but they aren't entirely distracting. Still, it's not exactly what I'd call refreshing, all things considered.  As much as I have always enjoyed Bell's Hopslam, I can't help but say of it that it's the right size but the wrong shape. What I mean by that is that it has the right amount of bitter, tropical, herbal hoppiness but it all falls way to an overall toasty, sweet, and malty persona.

You folks that are stating that it doesn't live up to it's ""hype"", obviously like an IPA that is way different than my likeing. All is good though, it has everything that a good beer has to offer.

287,17112,TCbrewz,3.13,"Pours a copper color with a rather creamy looking white head, carbonation is evident. Very slightly opaque as far as clarity goes. Head is retained until the end. Smells almost as hoppy as the name implies; more earthy and spicy notes than floral. Malt aroma is almost undetectable, but overall a rather appealing smell. Flavor is very hop forward as expected, almost too overwhelming on the tongue to pick apart. Finish starts with pronounced bitterness, followed by a not unflattering pine resin(y) taste accompanied by an almost barlywine-like malt flavor with a bit of alcohol in the nose. Lacks balance in my opinion. For a beer that looked rather over carbonated after pouring, I have to say the mouth feel was great. Good viscosity, and definitely not over-carbonated. I realize with a name like hop slam, that some intense hoppyness should be expected. But more goes into a great beer than a ridiculous amount of hops. I've had quite a few IPA's that did a much better job of showcasing the hops used. Anyway, hop slam is alright, nothing great though.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",Imperial IPA,98

287,17112,JohnnyHopps,4.33,"Poured into a snifter from the bottle, the beer was a beautiful golden color. It gave nearly an inch of head which quickly dissolved into beer. Immediately, the aroma is noted as a hoppy pine scent that melts into a certain sweet scent. The balance between the sweetness and the hops in this beer is remarkable. Initially sweet with the honey making its presence known, the punch of the hops knocks that flavor out of the way. Even long after the swallow, the hops linger on the roof of the mouth. A strong pineapple and a hint of peach are evident in the hops, but the pine flavor is most noticeable. Not a lot of carbonation is present which helps the taste to linger. The aftertaste is dominated by the warming sensation of the alcohol. This is not to suggest that the aftertaste is without flavor. The pine continues in the aftertaste with a certain hint of sweetness.  On my first experience, I was not overwhelmed by this beer. I found myself more impressed after a year away from it.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",Imperial IPA,98
287,17112,rinhaak,4.2,"I was excited to find this on the shelves while I was visiting Minnesota, but though it is a tremendous DIPA, I'm not sure it's quite worth the hoopla. (Though I would still recommend tracking it down and trying it, if you can!)  It's plenty hoppy, but creates a good balance between bitter and sweet. A mouth full of citrus with some grapefruit and orange (unlike some previous reviewers, I didn't feel the grapefruit was overwhelmingly strong), the beer doesn't do a very good job of hiding the alcohol. I wouldn't call this a complex beer, but what is there is done really well. This beer is all about the hops, which is good since Bell's made some nice choices with their hop selection.  I really enjoyed this beer, and though it didn't blow my mind, it certainly could fight for a rank among the top 15 or so DIPAs on the market. Give it a try if you can.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",Imperial IPA,98
287,17112,C20Percent,4.53,"*Reviewing after my second Hopslam*  A: For me, Bell's deserves a lot of credit here because the appearance is the best feature of this beer. It's pours a slightly hazy dark bronzy-orange that slowly gets hazier. A firm head of foam holds pretty steady for the whole drinking experience leaving some really fantastic lacing. And, I don't want to fail to mention the bubbles I saw. When I think of what type of appearance qualifies for a 5 this is it. Perfect.  S: I think Hopslam trips up here. Look, certainly I'm getting a very subtle citrus grapefruit smell with some earthiness in the background. And, if you look hard enough the honey aroma comes through. But, and this is a criticism I've heard, it smells boozy. Usually, with IPAs that I'd describe as boozy, I don't encounter that characteristic until the taste, but I'm getting it in the smell. It's nothing to write home about. I'd say this is average.  T: Taste just like it smells, but for me that's not a good thing. To be honest, the boozy, dry finish is killing my beer-drinking experience. You can taste the grapefruit and other citrus flavors trying to burst through, but they never quite do. The taste is almost there, but it never hits the spot. In fact, I think the honey might be deluding the citrus. I don't know for sure - just not doing it for me.  M: Credit where credit is do, though. The feel of this is nearly perfect. Hopslam coats your mouth, but doesn't overwhelm you. It does have a thicker body, bordering on syrupy, but Bell's balances this really, really well. The carbonation is just a little lighter than I like -- a like a medium carbonation, and I'd call this light. Great feature of this beer, though.  O: I really wanted to like this beer. Doesn't live up to the hype for me. I think it compares very well to Bear Republic's Racer 5, which is another popular beer that I don't enjoy. Still, I'd suggest everyone try it. I'm glad I only picked up a six-pack this go around. I'll pick it up next year to see if there's any difference. Overall, taste is the most important aspect of a beer for me, and this one is just above average.  Re-Evaluation:  *Same batch two weeks later*  S: This smell is greatly improved from the first impression. Real nice bold citrus smell. That booziness is not there that was not there previously. At least not at the level that originally warranted a 3.0 rating. I think I'd change this to a 4.0.  T: I know I thought this was boozy before -- and yes, there is some of that, but this is so drinkable. A real nice sweet malt, intense citrus taste, which I don't remember getting in the first brew. I gotta bump this up a half a point.  O: Still not perfect, but greatly improved from my first rating experience. And, I'm an honest guy. I give credit where credit is due. I would definitely drink this again, and recommend to people.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",Imperial IPA,98

Essentially no malt aroma that I can find.  T: Hops! Tropical, orange citrus, pineapple, grassy dank pine. Just hints of a cracker malt flavor in the background. For the amount of hop flavor & aroma, it doesn't come across as particularly bitter - perhaps due in part to all of the fruity flavors the hops give off.  M: Medium body, nice amount of carbonation, and a moderate alcohol presence given the ABV - but the alcohol does become more noticeable as the beer warms.

Some carbonation is evident as are some alcohol legs.  Smell: Some moderate citrus orange and pineapple but there is an overall sweetness that I would assume is from the added honey. It actually smells like a fruit bubblegum to me. This is what differentiates Hopslam from other DIPA's for me to date.  Taste: More citrus with orange, pineapple and lemon than pine like. The hops are mellowed big time by the overall sweetness that is Hopslam. Quite sweet mid palate and this actually seems to cut the bitterness maybe too much. This is why I enjoy Hopslam though for a change of pace. There is the hop presence but the sweetness makes it so highly drinkable, especially at 10%.  Mouthfeel: Medium bodied with a sort of sticky feel and moderate carbonation. No alcohol burn at all.  Overall: I can see why so many people seek this one out.

M: Caught some of the presence of that 10% alcohol here, but nothing that would dissuade a drinker. Smooth otherwise.  O: A great beer. Pretty pricey where I'm buying but definitely worth a try if you've got the money.

287,17112,rodkin,4.1,"EDIT:  Having had this beer again for the 2013 release, I have to say I'm not quite as wowed. Still good, but the mouthfeel is a bit bigger than I'd like, and its drinkability seems a bit lower. I think this has more to do with my taste changing than variation by year, but who knows?  Bottles on 2/2/12.  Pours a golden copper color, very slightly hazy. Visible carbonation, and a nice head, not too big. Reduces to a small film, but doesn't dissipate completely. This beer looks great.  Smells like honey, pineapple, and lots of citrus. Very pleasant, kind of sweet.  Very, very hoppy. Pleasant bitterness, would almost be too much but it's balanced very nicely by the honey. Some citrus, particularly grapefruit. Very slight alcohol warmth. Leaves a bitter aftertaste that makes you want to just keep drinking. I would not believe this was 10% if I didn't know it.  Mouthfeel is great. Slightly creamy, with tingly carbonation.  Overall a highly drinkable, very tasty and very hoppy DIPA. Glad I picked up as much as I did.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",Imperial IPA,98
287,17112,facundoCNB,4.17,"poured a hazy orange/yellow with a very small amount of head. smells very sweet like candy but with a hint of bitterness rising from the hops. taste is bitter, but sweet enough to balance it out (until the bitterness of the aftertaste kicks in!). definitely taste the sweetness from the honey, a fruity banana taste to it as well. a bit heavy on mouthfeel - a little too rich and creamy for the weather right now (70 and sunny outside), bitter but smooth going down. this is a great iipa, of course it's way hyped by beer geeks which makes me a bit turned off, but after giving it a try, it was a great beer. i wouldn't call it the best for its style, it could use a bit of work on the appearance and the smell (not too many different things going on there and not a great deal of hop aromas either)",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",Imperial IPA,98

A - Dark amber body with a 2 finger off white head that dies down to a neat cap with edging. Moderate lacing and retention.  S - Juicy peach and mangoes, some dank earthiness, honey and malt sweetness finished by a bit of an alcoholic twang.  T - Starts off with grapefruit and peach which then leads into sweet caramel malts. Super juicy hops surrounded by some dank flavors and some honey sweetness. Finish is warming and dry with some residual hop bitterness and sweetness. Very delicious.Mouth feel is vibrant and silky with a nice level of carbonation.  O - One of the best DIPA's out there. I would put this one just behind Surly Abrasive. I absolutely love the honey addition.

Not very bitter, finishes dry.  M - Medium body, medium carbonation. Quite smooth for the ABV  O - Tasty beer that doesn't quite live up to the hype for me.

287,17112,NuclearDolphin,4.44,"Poured into an Oversized Wine Glass  Appearance - Cloudy Dark Orange color with a little bit of carbonation. Lacing retention is decent  Smell - Very powerful citrusy hops with sweet honey, caramel and malts. Before even smelling this, the hoppy aroma managed to travel all the way over to where I was.  Taste - Like the smell, powerful citrusy hops upfront followed by a sweet honey and malty flavor. For a flavor this strong, the aftertaste is surprisingly dry with only a slight bitter resin aftertaste.  Mouthfeel - It's a bit on the heavy side in terms of body, and it feels very creamy thanks in part to it's lack of carbonation. For an Imperial IPA, it's very easy to drink.  Overall - I had high expectations for Hopslam and I'm happy to say I'm impressed with it. It's got an excellent hoppy kick that I love and it's incredibly easy to drink.

Sweet scent and the hoppy nature is there.  T: It has been awhile since I've had a hoppy beer, so this really hit my tongue. Once the power hop hits, there is a bitterness that lingers, along with a faint hop taste.  M: No excessive carbonation and relatively smooth throughout the bottle.

287,17112,IPA4LIFE,4.4,"Found the last bottle of this they had for sale at AJ's on the north side of Tucson. Poured into a tulip glass.  A- Clear golden golden slightly orange color with about one finger of off-white head. Head retains a small amount of foam on the edges of the surface of the beer. Lacing is very minimal.  S- Really sweet aromas to start off with. Notes of raw honey and sugar, followed by light hints of tropical fruit and some alcohol. Not as hoppy as I expected, but still not bad by any stretch of the word. Impressive, but not the greatest aroma I have ever seen, to be honest.  T-Ok, this makes up for the slightly-less-than-amazing aroma. The taste is awesome. Rich malt character up front, characterized by some sweet caramel and honey notes. A nice touch of alcohol on the mid palate, followed by a very very nice hop profile. Hops contribute some tropical fruit and spice, along with grapefruit and orange peel. The hops flavors smooth into a really nice, rich bitterness, which competes with a slight hint of alcohol for your attention throughout the end of the taste.  M- Really smooth and silky. Relatively low carbonation is great for the style.  O- This is a good beer. It is an excellent beer in-fact. However, I'm not sure that it is a 99 out of 100. I really love the complexity of the flavor profile, but the aromas were just a touch muted in my opinion. Still awesome, and I encourage anyone who has the chance to try one to do it.

One of my top beers on this site though is Central Waters Double IPA so I made sure to have a Hopslam and a CW DIPA back to back to make sure I could compare to the Hopslam to the ""gold standard"" (for me at least) of IPAs.  This beer had a nice amber look to it as I poured with some nice carbonation and a small white head.  I could smell the welcome scents of an IPA: hops, citrus and pine all came through.  It had a really good taste with the expected bitterness of an IPA followed up with grapefruit and other citrus fruits. The mouthfeel was very good but nothing special.  So I really liked this beer and my guess is that it's score will put it amongst my top 10 but when compared to Central Water's Double IPA, this will probably rank as my second favorite IPA.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",Imperial IPA,98

The taste is a symphony of sweet honey, and bitter hops, with a good showing of malt as well. The alcohol is hidden very well, only showing up a bit as it warms. Tastes like sweet sour hop candy  The only problem here is the sweetness, and not being big on sweet beer, it knocks this down a notch for me. That and it's very expensive at ~$20 a 6-pack.

Slightly sweet hops and even with my dying taste buds I can taste the honey and it is perfect. The bitterness lingers and is just right.  Mouthfeel is perfect. Smooth slightly oily with perfect carbonation.  Certainly not a hop bomb but an absolute must try for all hop heads. Way too easy drinking for 10%, This is the dipa that all others want to be.

I reviewed this as a bottle but honestly that didn't prepare me for how much better it was on tap.  A: Golden, perfect, foamy head. Lots of lacing.  S: Amazing bouquet of hops, with a slight sweet smell.  T: Best I've ever had, bar none. There is no other DIPA that tastes anywhere near as balanced as this one. It is literally the perfect combination of all those great IPA flavors we know and love - bitter, grapefruit, sweet, sour, flowerey. As far as flavor, I'm sure the famous Stone Ruination would overpower this beer in terms of sheer hop content and power, but I would literally take this any day over the ruination. It is lacking absolutely nothing.  M: Low carbonation = smooth, smooth mouthfeel. There is literally nothing offensive in here. If you wanted to, you could straight up chug this, as it literally has no indication that it actually contains any alcohol, but with a nice mouthfeel like this, you'll want to swirl it around and let it warm up and enjoy every single drop.  This is the highest review I have ever given any beer, but it is deserved, in my opinion.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",Imperial IPA,98

287,17112,PatDreadful,4.67,"Poured from a tap into a 12 oz snifter.  Appearance: A very relaxed amber with hazy undertones. There is a very small head which vanishes quickly and leaves minimal lacing.  Smell: Wow. As I was talking to the bartender I could smell the hops wafting up to me. The complexity of the aroma was off the charts. I was first hit with the citrus and then the pine and finally the scent of farm fresh wet hops. Simply spectacular.  Taste: Again the complexities of the hops really stand out. The fruity hops present themselves first but the one works its way into the flavor all while there is a sense of freshness involved. A gorgeous symphony of the different hops which is complimented nicely by some bitterness and s very mild malt backbone. The beer is so strong with flavor but some how really invites you take another sip immediately.  Mouthfeel: Most IPA's this complex leave me feeling worn out. Not HopSlam. The intense flavors have more of a relaxing sensation as they wash over your tongue with just the right body, carbonation and bitterness.  Drinkability: A dangerously drinkable brew. I could easily have four or five without thinking.  This may be my new benchmark for IPA's.

Bell's is always consistent, and with Hopslam they have created one of the best IPA's in America, in my opinion. I'm not even that big of a fan of India Pale Ales, but the balance of honey and hops makes this one fly!  Poured from a 12 oz. bottle into a pint glass, it provides a color that is somewhere between golden and amber, coming across as pure honey just from its look. I was expecting to be blown away from the bitterness, but that's really not the case with this double IPA. There is a lot to be said about this beer's smoothness. It's incredible, and has opened my optimism for IPA's up again.  I'll be buying this again.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",Imperial IPA,98

Crisp, clean, finish considering the stature of this beer. Slight lingering bitterness and sweetness but it's plenty expected and perfectly managed.

Thick lace curtains and a strong steady bead. Looks great.  Punchy, resinous and candied hop aromas of grapefruit, lemon sherbet and tangerine, amplified by garlicky, sweaty notes. Also some subtle floral hops. The honey is not brash, but certainly noticeable and sharpens the aromas nicely. Pretty awesome.  Bracing bitterness off the bat. Loads of grapefruit, pine branch, lime pith and sherbet. Malt backbone is relatively light, and intertwined with the honey.  Sticky, full and appropriately big. Resins bite in the back palate as does the booze heat, which lowers the drinkability a little.

287,17112,BlackBelt5112203,4.67,"I've had this beer on tap before and was very impressed, but I didn't take any notes to review it. I just snagged a 6-pack today that was bottled on 1/26/12 so we'll see how it goes.  12 oz. bottle poured into a pint glass at slightly-cooler-than-cellar temperature.  L - Pale amber color with a 2 finger white foamy head. Pretty good retention and alright lacing.  S - Definitely hoppy. Resin, grapefruit, and a little bit of pine and floral aroma. Slight sweetness of malt/honey apparent. Alcohol content definitely there but not even close to overpowering.  T - Follows the aroma for the most part. The hops are there, grapefruit and resin, maybe a pineapple taste, too. Definitely some honey flavor. Alcohol is not really noticeable at all, a miracle for 10% ABV. This actually tastes more sweet than bitter to me, something that I was surprised about, but brewing with honey might do that. Don't get me wrong, the bitterness is still there, though.  F - Medium body, medium carbonation, definitely a dry and bitter finish. Sort of a mouth-coating feel and man, does this go down smooth.  O - As good as this is, I remember it being hoppier and slightly more bitter on tap, with more grapefruit aroma and taste especially. My guess is that it might be a factor of the beer aging and the hop character diminishing, but I don't know how much a month can do.  Edit: I had a fresher bottle recently and it was how I remembered it on tap - lots of citrusy grapefruit aroma and flavor and a nice bitterness with the perfect amount of honey and malty sweetness to balance it. Great beer.  That being said, this beer is ridiculous. It's so smooth and balanced without any hint of alcohol in the taste, but you know it's there when you start to hit the bottom of your glass. There is a ton of complexity without any overpowering flavors, something that is hard to find with a lot of DIPAs.

287,17112,cagocubs,4.59,"Served on tap into snifter. Waited a long time for this one.  A: Pour presented with a nice amber gold color with a steady flow of carbonation. The head was a finger's length of foamy white sud that reduces to a thin layer with slight lacing.  S: Citrus, hops, florals, and pine right off the bat. The sweet aroma digs deeper than grapefruit. The floral/pine aromas combine nicely with typical DIPA scents.  T: First and foremost, I could not believe this beer snuck in 10%. All of the typical flavors came full circle without hinting the strength of the ingredient profile. Nice citrus and hop bitterness that gave way to sweet flavors.  M: A nice flow to the beer. The active carbonation gives a nice tingle as the masked alcohol and bitter hops give a nice aftertaste.  O: Honestly, I don't like jumping on bandwagons, but there is no argument to be had here. This is by far one of the more quality beers you can get out there.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",Imperial IPA,98

Smells very citrusy with lots of pineapple; almost like fruit juice. Some floral notes are there as well.  The citrus hops come through very prominently at first and linger throughout. A moderate to high bitterness appears about halfway through and lingers for awhile. Honey is detectable mainly towards the finish and the sweetness hides any alcohol. Mouthfeel is medium to full but not at all syrupy like many IIPA's.  I was very pleasantly surprised by this beer. It honestly drinks like a 6 or 7 percent beer. The fruitiness is also very nice.

A one finger, frothy white head appears initially and slowly fades to a thin film across the top.  S: Nice hop profile that isn't overpowering. Floral and citrus aromatic notes are the backbone, while a touch of sweet honey, and some pineapple-like aromas come through in the background.  T: Again, a nice hop profile of floral, citrus, and tropical pineapple, but all aspects are slightly muted when compared to the aroma. It has a nice bitter bite to the end to finish it off.  M: Medium bodied, with a moderate amount of carbonation. It has that resiny feel that I really like in an IPA. It feels a bit oily and finishes dry. Pretty good.  O: I've had many DIPA's in my time. This one is pretty good, but doesn't stand up to the elite DIPA's. The nose and the taste just seemed held back a little.

287,17112,OneBeertoRTA,5,"I've heard the hype and made a conscious effort to procure some this season.  Scored a couple six packs at the Binny's right when the opened on release day.  The bottle pours a rich amber (honey) color with ample carbonation. The aroma is hops hops and more hops.  Upon first taste the hops hit you in taste and smell but the subtle honey is noticeable throughout. One of my buddy's trying one also for the first time said the honey really stood out although I found it subtle.  The fact this beer is ""supposedly"" 10% is mind boggling. This is really a masterpiece. I want this all the time.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",Imperial IPA,98
287,17112,DrinkSlurm,4.51,"Poured from bottle into tulip. Pour is an orange cloudy golden, perfect lacing. Smell is fantastic. Great tropical, citrusy fresh hop aroma, mixed with a bit of candy. Taste is fantastic as well. The best DIPA I have ever had to date. Taste is of fresh hops, slightly citrus and tropical notes. I really taste the honey and it makes this slightly sweet. I will go out on a limb and even say I even taste a bit if vanilla. Nice booze flavors as well. Slightly bitter feel, but that is what I expected. It actually works very well with this brew. There is a reason for thy hype of this beer. Its one of the best DIPA's out there.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",Imperial IPA,98
287,17112,jrenihan,4.45,"Bottled January 26, 2012  Beer is golden orange with a good-sized, solid looking white head. Lots of lacing.  Smell is certainly hop-focused. Citrus scents abound, a very juicy scent. Pineapple, mango and grapefruit. The smell makes me think of a bowl of sticky pineapple and mango, the stickiness probably coming from the honey scent that accompanies the fruit. Don't get a lot of malt scents. Very nice.  Taste is similar to the nose. Tangy, bitter tropical fruit with some sweetness provided by the honey. A bit of a pine flavour at the end, but this one is really about the citrus. Like the nose, it is pineapple that come through most strongly for me, but grapefruit is prominent as well. Aftertaste is quite bitter.  Beer is full bodied, moderate to high carbonation but not irritating. It works. A bit oily.  Overall, an excellent DIPA. Glad to finally be able to try it. Hopslam can count me in as a fan.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",Imperial IPA,98

T: Hops and bitter up front with some malt flavoring coming in on the end. Pretty amazing. M: Some alcohol burn but a lot of nice hop flavor throughout with some pine notes. O: Great, good hop varieties that complement each other and the flavor really comes through. A-  2013 note - Not as hoppy as I remember. Still a really solid beer but it seems muted and its was only bottled 20 days ago.

287,17112,Philousa,3.04,"Pours a clear honey gold with little head. Pretty typical for a Triple IPA. Very Grassy, piney hops. Sweet honey kissed biscuit with an alcohol tinge at the end. Very dank. Hop resin sums up this beer in two words. That's nearly all you need to know. Sweet, chewy white bread malt turns bitter grassy, then very alcoholic bitter aftertaste. Lingers very plasticky, band-aidy in the mouth. On the syrupy side, very dry finish.  I really liked the aroma, but that phenolic plastic aftertaste really buried this one for me. I got this in a trade, so I'm really hoping this one was sitting in the sun or something because this has a lot of potential. FYI, I wouldn't normally give something I suspect to be ""damaged goods"" a review, but I really don't have any other means by which to review this beer. This is more for my notes so i can go back and try it fresh in Chicago one day to compare. Gotta say though, even with the plastic phenol taken away, it's pretty syrupy. After the DIPA fest, I can say I've had several beers that lack this characteristic that still fit the TIPA style. So I guess I'm saying that my below average review is still warranted in my eyes.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",Imperial IPA,98
287,17112,Sobered,4.8,"For me, Stone's Ruination had been the creme de la creme for a long damn time. It was my go to sixer when I needed something that was a notch above the competition in the DIPA category.  One day I walked into my local overpriced bar (they're all overpriced here in PA) and saw something called HopSlam sitting in the cooler. I knew I had to at least try it. I'm a bit of a hop head these days and my wife absolutely hates it. She can taste ruination and think it's kinda strong on the grapefruit, which I LOVE. Her first sip of this... she gagged and dry heaved. That should tell you how hoppy and bitter it is. If you're a hop-head and after the most pungent, bitter beer imaginable, this is the one. It was simply a 100/100. There is no point in doing a 6 point breakdown on this beer.  If you love the brutal assault on your tongue that is a well crafted DIPA, this is your beer, if not, this is not your beer. At almost 21.00 a sixer in PA, there's not even room for experimentation.  If I was going to be banished to a desert island for eternity with just one thing to drink for the rest of my days, this would be my choice. So good...such a reminder of why I'm here in the first place.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",Imperial IPA,98
287,17112,yamar68,4.2,"Pours a golden honey with a subtle haze that clears with some warmth. Finger of white head comes with a vigorous pour. Decent, spotty lacing. Typical west coast IIPA on the nose - big on the citrus and mango, backed up with some pine and subtle malt support, more boozy than some. Leans more towards fruit on the tongue with less herbal/pine hop presence. Fades off into some soft booze notes, and a tiny sting on the back of the palate at the very end. Mouthfeel is as expected - medium everything. Appropriate for the style. Overall it’s a good double IPA. I wouldn’t say it’s worth the hype and the price but it’s good. EDIT: Just got a sixer with a 2/10 bottle date - a month fresher than the batch I reviewed initially. Much more interesting. The honey is a bit sweeter and better incorporated. I’ll adjust my numbers somewhat, but not too much because I don’t feel that any beer should suffer that much from 4 extra weeks in the bottle. I’d probably seek this out year after year if I was guaranteed the fresh stuff.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",Imperial IPA,98

A: Pours a clean copper-orange color with a minimal head that fades quickly.  S: Definitely picked up plenty of hops, pine, some candied pineapple and tropical fruit. Not as floral as I expected or am used to but still a great nose.  MF: Nice Body, very light carbonation... feels so silky and smooth. The alcohol is slightly noticeable but considering that this one clocks in at 10%. I'd say they did an excellent job of balancing this one out.  O: A beer well-worth trekking for and/or seeking out.

A: Pours golden light copper, mostly clear with just over two fingers of white foamy head with good retention and lacing.  S: Fairly big tropical fruit with notes of mango and pineapple, honey and sugary sweetness is noticeable, pine needles, slight dankness, alcohol can be detected in the background.  T: Balanced hop punch of the tropical fruits, pine, and herbal dankness. Honey and sugar sweep in with a nice body of pale malt to help alleviate the hop destruction being unleashed on the palate. Unfortunately the booze appears on the back end and it does detract from taste and experience. Finish is somewhat sweet with lingering honey/sugar and hops.  M: Medium to slightly full body. On the sweeter side of DIPAs, though it doesn't have too much malt. Moderate astringency that is balanced by the sweetness. Moderate carbonation.  O: A very tasty DIPA that would be really world class if the alcohol bite on the end wasn't there or as strong. Maybe a touch better than Double Trouble, though I think it still pales a bit in comparison to the big boy DIPAs out of VT.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",Imperial IPA,98
287,17112,Darkmagus82,4.44,"Served in a 10 oz chalice glass  Appearance – It had a deeper golden color with a slight bit of haze. The head upon serving was relatively small and faded to give a moderate level of lacing.  Smell – The hops hit you from afar and hit hard. Big citrus and pine hops greet the nose with a nice aroma. These then mellow a bit as a maltier and sweeter aroma of caramel and bread mix in with the citrus and pine. Toward the very end of the smell there is a bit of floral that manages it way in to the aroma, although it is quite light in comparison the pine and citrus.  Taste – The taste follows the nose quite well. There is a nice more bitter citrus and pine taste upfront with is mixed quite nicely with a big malty backbone of some bready and biscuit flavors. As the taste moves forward it sweetens up with some sweeter fruit and caramel flavors coming into play. Toward the end it all comes together and leaves a very satisfying somewhat bitter, somewhat sweet flavor in the mouth. Quite pleasant.  Mouthfeel – A moderate to thicker body with a slightly lighter then normal carbonation level give this brew a nice creamy feel and allow the tastse to linger and permeate the tongue.  Overall – This was a nice imperial IPA. It had great aromas flavor and mouthfeel. One to look for and one to sit back and savor.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",Imperial IPA,98

T: Continues from the nose....oily pine and citrus hop with notes of peach and pineapple. The floral honey flavors are perfect. A very nice sweet malt background helps to keep the beer balanced. It doesn't get too much better than this.  M: Medium-heavy body with a feel that drinks like a wheat beer. A nice silky feel to it.

T: There is tons of hops, some alcohol and then some malt as the beer lingers on the tongue.  M: For as strong as this beer is, it is beyond smooth.

287,17112,fullmetal1381,4.37,"Bottle dated 1-26-12, part of a sixer.  Appearance: Amber-orange haze I am getting used to seeing from IPAs. Wish I wasn't drinking this at night, I'd imagine the sunlight playing through this brew to be amazing.  Smell: Tropical. Definitely sniffing the mangoes other speak of; the pineapples are more elusive. VERY faint hop-funk. No hint of honey whatsoever, despite what the packaging says. Intoxicatingly awesome; I could smell this all day.  Taste: If Bruce Lee one-inch punched you in the throat wearing a burlap sack that a massive load of hops was just poured from, you'd be close to the initial salvo from this beer. BITTER. I am still getting used to the IPA style even as I'm falling in love with it. Bitterness quickly fades to be replaced with fantastic floral notes. Hint of sweetness in the back end just to let you know that the sun will come up tomorrow, though not reminiscent of honey. Perhaps the malt?  Mouthfeel: I feel most noobish in this category, so grain of salt. Ever so light carbonation, nothing to stop me from drinking the hell out of this.  Overall: It should say something that I have tried both 90 Minute IPA and Dreadnaught (also stellar Imperial IPAs) and was moved enough to review this one first. I'm too new to the style to say if it's worth the hype, but I'm glad I got the sixer.

Great looking IIPA...  S: The aroma is absolutely fantastic. I can't stop sniffing this beer as I type this...amazing smelling beer.

You get a little of the caramel sweetness towards the end then bam...another wave of hop excellence...this beer has a really long finish. The aftertaste on this beer is outstanding.  M: I think the mouthfeel on this beer might be my favorite aspect. This beer just coats your mouth with intense flavor and it's so rich and creamy. Everytime I take a drink a let it linger in my mouth to feel the honey like texture. Very well done...  O: Well I have to say this is one of the best IIPA's I've ever had the pleasure of consuming.

A nice, smooth, malty, grapefruit and pine on the front of the tongue, with a simultaneous pleasing floral scrubbing on the back.

Another description on the bottle is ""a biting, bitter, tongue bruiser of an ale"". All that is true and says it about as well as I can. The appearance is a true honey color and laces very nicely in the glass. I'm not sure but I think this brew is filtered and I think if it was unfiltered I'd score it a 5 in appearance and it woudl also boost the taste score as well. The hopslam is a giant of goodness! I'm docking it a little on taste because we can't rate drinkability anymore. This is not a real drinkable beer. The graphic on the front of the bottle is a good one. This is the hulk of the hops.

Left with some good visible carbonation and a nice lace of white head.  Smells, shockingly, like hops. Pine is right there. There is NO DOUBT what this beer is: a HUGE IPA. There's very little maltiness in the smell...you get hops, hops, and more hops. A slam of hops, if you will. (Do I detect a slight green onion kind of smell?)  Tastes incredible. This is what an IPA should be. Sharp, sharp hops. Much bigger bitter aftertaste than Heady Topper, it leaves you wanting more and more! There's not much in the way of sweet malty balance. For a 10% ABV IPA, I'd expect this to be much sweeter. Nope, it's a hop SLAM.  Mouthfeel is the best part of this beer. It has perfect carbonation and goes down easy. This is scary drinkable. Love it. It tastes amazing.  Overall, I love this beer. It's not as good as Heady Topper - it's more one or two note than the symphony of Heady. But this is a very good beer.

Before I even get started I have to make a note that this is one of THE greatest smelling beers I have ever smelled in my entire life. The aroma hits you the very second you begin to pop the cap off the bottle.  A- Pours a Deep hazy orange with a white head. The head retreats in the first 30 seconds after pouring, down into a thin lacing on the top of the beer. There is a healthy looking white ring that forms around the edges of the glass. Small white bubbles can be seen rising in streams from the bottom to the surface along the edges of the glass.  S- A very strong and vibrant smelling beer. It has a very sweet and fruity aroma. Honey blends in with the smell of luscious grapefruit and mango notes. Their are also faint hints of juicy pears, mandarin oranges and lemons. Very citrusy and hoppy. Almost no bitterness to the aroma at all.  T- Incredibly well hopped and sweet without an intense bitter finish. Has some very fruity characters. Starts with sweet notes of mango and papaya from the hops and finishes with the semi-bittersweet taste of grapefruit and pineapple notes. The honey is somewhat noticeable but not entirely. There is absolutely almost no bitter earthiness to the hop flavor at all despite how aggressively hopped this ale is. The finish is very enjoyable sweet and tart for a beer of this kind.  M- Very smooth and medium in feel despite how well carbonated it is. Slightly crisp at the start from the carbonation but finishes very smooth.  O- Going in to this review it was very hard not to be biased due to all of the positive hype that this beer receives, however it is one of the very few that I have tried that has actually almost exceeded it in terms of how much I truly enjoyed this beer. This is the perfect beer in so many ways and I am happy to say it is the first beer I have ever reviewed that I have given a 5.

S - Huge citrus coupled with some spicy hops and a caramel sweetness. I get a little bit of alcohol on the nose. Very pleasantly aromatic beer.  T - Sweet and tart grapefruit is balanced by some drying piney hops in the middle. Finishes a bit sweet, nectarine, with a touch of alcohol that I would expect from a double digit ABV. Despite the label ""ale brewed with honey"" I didn't get an overwhelming honey flavor. However, it is probably sweeter than most. Impeccable balance between hops and sweetness; quite tasty.  M - Nice and thick, which compliments the flavors nicely. The carbonation is above average and a touch tingly on the tongue. Finish is smooth and moist. Nearly perfect.  O - One of the best beers in one of my favorite styles. There was no doubt I was going to enjoy it, but I was afraid all the hype and exclusivity (in my area, at least) would build up my expectations too high. Hopslam didn't disappoint and should be considered world class in the DIPA category. It has the hops and alcohol that ""slam"" the palate, yet a soft sweetness that mellows the flavors out.

M: Not as sharp as one might think with bell’s description (A biting, bitter, tongue bruiser of an ale.) The sticky sweetness lasts quite a long time.  O: I first had this beer two years ago… long before I had tried anything else like it. It has been my favorite beer since. I plan on aging the last two bottles, how long? As long as I can wait.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",Imperial IPA,98
287,17112,Immortale25,4.71,"Poured into an Evolution Brewing pint glass. Back label says 10914 PKGD, so no readable freshness date.  A- Pours a medium amber color with a 1/2 inch head that bears little retention and fritters down to an 1/8 inch ring around the edge of the glass leaving bumps of lacing. Surface foam is in a mold pattern indicating healthy yeast.  S- Grassy, pungent hops along with sweet, biscuity malts. Quite floral and almost perfumey.  T- Bright, intense bitterness assaults the palate but holds back enough to let the malt duality play its part. On second sip, the hops don't let up and continue to make their presence very known. Upon the third sip, one notices that the booze is quite toned down for a full 10% ABV. By the time the fourth sip is taken, you can start to notice the honey come in and complete the sweet finish that the malts begin. After the fifth sip, the palate is almost fully acclimated to the hop bite and can now appreciate the synchronization of all ingredients in the flavor profile. Remarkable.  M- A dry afterfeel plus jaw clenching from the bitterness, at least during the first few sips. Medium-low carbonation.  O- I like it better on tap, but this is still a leader among IPAs.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",Imperial IPA,98

HOPS are amazing in this one... definately the key ingredient but not overwhelming to the sense that it is bad... becasue wow!!! Nice sweetness from the orange. Nice piney bitterness!  M: 10%...really!!! No sign of boozyness. Nice balance to this medium bodied beer.  O: Look forward to this beer each year. Defiantely my kind of beer!

287,17112,BBThunderbolt,4.07,"Thanks to nomasnomore for sharing this bottle with me. Bottled on 2/2/12. Poured into Tulip. Poured a nice golden honey color with just a thin cap of white head that had minimal retention and lacing.  The aroma had a nice blast of piney hops upfront, and a bit of malty sweetness noticeably supporting it. The hops were also at the forefront on the tongue, very tart and well defined pine, with some citrus in the background.  The body was nicely full and smooth, and was fairly well balanced across the tongue. Drinkability was very good, this is a rare ImpIPA I'd drink a few of at a time. Overall, one of the rare beers that actually lives up to it's hype. For me, this is a much better beer than the even more hyped PtE.

Followed by pine hops, orange and peach.  Taste: All the flavors are combined perfectly. The pine and floral hops with the mango, orange and peach come out at the same time. It's amazing!  Mouthfeel: Good carbonation, smooth with a mid-light dryness on the palate.  Overall: Clean with a crisp finish. Perfectly balanced with a medium body. Has a great sweetness to it from the honey.

287,17112,brystmar,4.15,"Bottled on 1/26/2012.  Copper body with thick, white head; decent lace and retention. Aroma holds tons of hops, sweet malts, honey, and a distinct boozy caramel-ness. Love how this one smells, just wish its aroma was stronger.  The honey really stands out initially, contributing to a complex (and undeniably sweet) flavor profile up front before the hops return for a dry, bitter finish. Strong malt backbone adds character, body, and balance. Hop character is smooth & round, not sharp or overly piney like many of its West Coast peers. I'll attribute this equally to the brewer's intentions (this is clearly an East Coast DIPA) and the addition of honey.  Creamy body flows smoothly around my mouth. Alcoholic warmth soothes the throat as I swallow. Booze gets to me sooner than expected -- I definitely couldn't drink more than one of these in a single sitting.  Hopslam is a great DIPA, especially considering the tremendous batch size, and I prefer it to *bottled* Pliny.

Absolutely pleasant with big grapefruit and pineapple aromas. A bit of foral and honey aromas as well. T- Not as hoppy as on the nose, but still super hoppy. There's a bit of candied grapefruit, orange juice and honey backbone as well. Big flavors. M- The boozyness is noticable, but for 10% it does well. Carbonation is even but leaves a slightly prickly feeling. O- A beer that has been on my beer bucket list. It lived up.

Thanks!  12 ounce bottle bottled on 02/09/12  A - Amber orange, one finger of white head, dissipated really quickly into a white wisp.  S - Sweet hops with a slight piney note, the honey comes off strong in the nose, nice floral bouquet, you can smell the balance in this one!  T - The hope bite is more pronounced in the taste than it is in the nose, with grapefruit coming in a little more, the honey kicks in on the back end and lingers for a while.  M - The carbonation is a little sharp for me, but the level of carbonation is perfect, the honey also helps this beer with the mouthfull as it coats the inside of your mouth.  O - A really solid DIPA, and I am really glad I was able to get my hands on this one. This beer holds up to it's name and the hype around it. At 10% abv, you better be careful!",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",Imperial IPA,98
287,17112,Steverus,4.88,"1. Damn.  2. It's called Hopslam, so you shouldn't be surprised that it is very hoppy. But what's impressive about this beer is it's honey backbone - smooth uncharacteristic of such a big beer.  3. Rich doesn't begin to cover this beer. A rich, piny aroma with a subtler malt character is what this beer is all about.  Make no mistake, the first taste is a hop-heavy throat punch. But with its honey backbone, it only gets better on the second taste.

287,17112,RoamingGnome,4.5,"Poured from 12 oz bottle into CBS snifter.  A) This is a golden/amber with a slight haze. A pretty routine pour yielded a half a finger of white head, that settled quickly to a wispy dusting. This had decent lacing.  S) Nice floral aromatics combining with citrus fruit. Pleasingly sweet with a hint of grass or evergreen. There's some alcohol on the nose too.  T) Here's where I pick up that honey. Nice citrus flavor, some peaches. I tasted Juicy Fruit bubble gum. This is grassy at the end, with some alcohol heat. This leads to a tingly citrus rind aftertaste.  M) Initially I was thinking medium bodied, but as I was sipping, and it warmed, it felt more full. This is a definite sticky mouth coater, with a good amount of carbonation.  O) The alcohol could have been slightly less detectable, but considering the ABV, this is highly drinkable, which means I will proceed with caution since this is a work night. This is a must purchase every year, and without a doubt, highly recommended.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",Imperial IPA,98

S: I had forgotten to include the smell aspect of the review initially, so I will leave it 'as is'. However, know that you will not be disappointed.  T: Grapefruit, citrus, lemon, honeycomb, malt. As it matures in the mouth, the hoppy bitterness intensifies but in a creamy, sweet way. Leaves the palate with a sweet honey, dry biscuit twitch. ABV is where? It enhances the flavor.  M: Unreal. The sticky resin of Hopslam coats the palate like gorilla glue on a hot summer day. Carbonation is absolutely perfect, tingly and full.

287,17112,demuzik,4.15,"Pours a deceptive gold with a hint of amber; moderate to low head.  This beer is hoppy - surprised? The hops in this year's brew are varied giving it a complex hop taste, personally can't pick out the varieties used. Quite bitter though not strong on the pine; more spice, and brunt bitter on the tongue.  The honey traces across the tongue and the entire beer lingers in the mouth; if I didn't see it say 10% ABV on the bottle, I'd never believe it.  Last half of the glass/bottle finds it hop heavy, the seesaw heavily weighed on the hoppy side. To compare to others in the genre, I prefer Pliny for it's balance and pine-ey ness; this is definitely not a West coast beer, it makes perfect sense its a Midwest beer since I find it tasting somewhere in between Pliny and Dogfish Head.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",Imperial IPA,98

S: Up front I smelled the honey which caught be off guard, but not in a bad way. From there I got some citrus and hops that were very well balanced.  T: Hoppy up front, followed by a sweet honey taste. Seemed to lack some type of malty or other flavors.  M: Light and clean for an IPA. No harsh aftertaste but there was some remaining hop in the back of the mouth.  O: Fantastic IPA. So glad I bought it even though the high price.

Aroma- A very intense piney and grassy aroma are mixed together. A big time citrus note comes out as well. Not much honey here but tons of sweetness (probably due to the malt).  Appearance- Pours a 1 finger head that has average retention. Has a reddish copper colored body that is deep but mostly good clarity. Leaves thick lacing behind in sud and lace form.  Flavor- Has a very sweet beginning (for half a second) and then tons of grassy hops hit the mouth. The lightest honey attribute finally comes around but really have to search for it... Malts are huge here! Medium-High Bitterness level finishes this one off.  Mouthfeel- Medium-Full Bodied, Medium Carbonation, Smooth, and tons of sweetness and good hop that remain on the palate.  Overall Impression- While enjoying this one many times, I still don't find the honey it talks about except only in the background... I still would enjoy this over and over but would appreciate more pronounced honey if they put this on their bottles!

Thick, pillowy, eggshell colored 1/2"" head, clear goldenrod color with lots of bubbling action from the bottom of the glass. Head clings to the glass and retains impressively. The nose is a little hard to distinguish, but it's fresh and hoppy. Kind of a lemon/orange combo, some kind of faint tropical fruit. The taste is a hop assault; more than any other IPA I've had, it just tastes like bitter, leafy hops. What it lacks in complexity it makes up in richness. There's some pine and a little bit of honey, a bit of grapefruit zest in the finish, but mostly just planty, bitter hops. Nice light texture to it, which is impressive considering the ABV. I want to call it fluffy, in a good way. Slick and clean. A good and unique DIPA, but doesn't live up to the hype for me.

T - Clean and Hoppy, the hops give it a citrus taste, after swallowing more of the bitterness comes through. Very similar characteristics as the nose with pine coming out after swallowing. I had this out of a cask a couple weeks back and I have to say I enjoyed it much more... the cask seemed very fresh, having more fruity plum notes, as well as other great hop characteristics that made the beer seem more complex as a whole. Out of the bottle there is a very slight alcohol burn, which I don't remember from last year... probably due to the increase in honey (from what I have heard)  M - Sharp, crisp and bitter yet somehow smooth ... yum.  O - All in all... very solid, I'm being picky and thats because I really really enjoyed it out of the cask more. For $20 bucks a 6 pack kinda disappointing compared to last year but still damn good.

OOH, the excitement! Ummm,smells like grapefruit at the peak of ripeness. Not a hint of bitterness. There is a sticky sweetness to the nose that may be the honey. Head is less than I remembered. Taste is of grapefruit with just the right amount of sugar on it. I'm not picking up on the pineapple like I remembered. Mouthfeel has far more carbonation than the weak head would indicate.

Nice bitterness up front with a punch of hops going down as well. Lingering honey citrus pine on the palate. Very drinkable, despite the 10% alcohol. Light to medium body with medium carbonation. A must try for anyone who fancies themselves a hop head. I look for this one every winter. Wish it were year round. Out of the bottle this is excellent, but on draft this thing hits a whole new level. I find a bit more of the mellow honey sweetness on draft and more floral aromatics--but excellent both ways.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",Imperial IPA,98
287,17112,SoCalStout,4.47,"Bottle poured into a Tulip at Toronado SD on 2/12/2012 Given to me by one of the Beertenders so I dont know the bottling date.  Appearance: Pours a clear, honey color with a nice thin head and great lacing.  Smell: Tons of citrus hops. The most up front for me is grapefruit and orange, but also quite a bit of piney aromas and a slight sweetness of honey in there too.  Taste: Citrusy, and pine hops dominate this one with some sweetness coming from the honey. Just a bit of malt to keep the beer nice and balanced. I say this is one of my favorite DIPA's, but I may be biased since the brewery name is the same as my last name. Definitely not overrated. A must try.  Mouthfeel: Good carbonation and close to being full bodied. The malt profile is definitely giving this a creamy texture. This beer is a great DIPA that doesn't dominate in the boozy category. Highly drinkable.  Overall: The smell beats out the taste for me, but this is definitely among the smoothest, tastiest ones I have had. Glad to have finally gotten to try this beer and looking forward to my next one. If only I could get it easier out here.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",Imperial IPA,98
287,17112,nmbr0ne,4.57,"Poured into snifter from 12oz bottle. Bottled on Jan 26, 2012.  Appearance: Clear, amber body. Finger-thick, white head that dissipates to a mediocre amount of lacing on the sides of the glass. Leaves a decent amount of patterns on the top of the beer.  Smell: Citrusy. A mixture of grapefruits, tangerines, and oranges. Piney. It's definitely a hop slam. A tinge of honey as well, but faintly.  Taste: Hops are dominant at the beginning of the sip. Still very citrusy flavors that finally succumb to a sweeter middle. It's balanced out though. Not too sweet. The finish is a combination of a hint of bitterness, that doesn't linger that much, and booze.  Mouthfeel: Crisp. Decently carbonated. A little slick. I would say medium-bodied.  Overall: One of my favorite DIPA's. Happy I finally get to review it. Definitely my favorite IPA that I can easily get in Florida when it is released.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",Imperial IPA,98

287,17112,amcmaho1,3.9,"Big thanks to GabrielM for this beer. Cheers again Gabe!  Bottled 1/9/12 Poured into snifter  Appearance: Pours a nice honey golden, with a bright white head. Very little head retention, though there is some nice lacing. Really clear beer, with a rich color.  Smell: I know this is a notorious hop-bomb, but I'm not necessarily getting the hops on the nose like I wish I was. I really do get a slight bit of vienna sausages and garlic (do they use simcoe in this?). Other than those aromas, which strangely enough I'm enjoying, there are some piney and resinous hop notes. I'm wondering if this was a bit fresher, if the more clean hop aromas were more prominent. There's some definite malt sweetness, and some slight earthy/possibly honey balancing out the hops.  Taste: I may have been missing some of the other hops on the nose, but they really come through in the taste. Nice assertive bitterness alongside some sweeter flavors...and some definite alcohol. This is a huge DIPA, and I have to say that I personally feel that it tastes vastly better than it smells (I'd love to try a 2 day old bottle though haha).  Mouthfeel: This is a pretty aggressive beer. The beer feels pretty thick and syrupy, it's dry, and it pretty much kills your palate...I think it's supposed to do all of these things though haha.  Overall: I certainly appreciate trying this beer, but I can't say that I really fell in love with it like everyone else. It's a stellar DIPA and certainly worthy of it's hype, but I personally prefer a more fruity/citrusy hop profile on a DIPA. Regardless, I'd seek this out again...maybe offer up my whole cellar for a fresh bottle (enter sarcasm)",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",Imperial IPA,98
287,17112,MattyG85,4.92,"Poured from 12 oz. bottle into a Surly Darkness Chalice glass. Bottled on 1/10/12.  Appearance: Pours a bright and slightly hazy looking golden amber orange with a moderate amount of bubbles. Decent two fingers of white head that fade into a thin patchy layer. Lots of lacing sticks to the glass.  Smell: A big aroma of ripe citrus fruits. Lots of grapefruit, mango, pineapple, orange, and some hints of peach and passion fruit. Also some piney and floral hops behind the tropical citrus. Solid base of bready caramel malts in the background with a good hint of honey. Very juicy and nice.  Taste: As great as the aroma leads. Big blast of tropical citrus hops up front with big notes of grapefruit, mango, orange, pineapple, passion fruit, and peach. Also some pine resin among the citrus. Hop bitterness is strong but not overpowering. Midway emerges a nice balancing sweetness from some bready malts. Good hints of caramel and honey. Outstanding taste.  Mouthfeel: Medium to full bodied with a moderate level of carbonation. Somewhat sticky and chewy. Very smooth for such a big ale. Alcohol is barely noticed at all. Finish is pretty drying.  Overall: An incredible Double IPA and one of the best beers in the world. The bitter hops and sweet malts play off each other perfectly.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",Imperial IPA,98
287,17112,minterro,4.67,"2012: Six pack from Spartan Spirits the first day it got there, but I've been letting this last one sit.  About 20$ a sixer.  Poured into a snifter  A & S: The biggest smell that comes to my nose is PASSIONFRUIT! The smell is very intense. Other scents include pineapple, orange zest, sweet burnt sugar maltyness, with hints of some resiny pine. The aroma is so luring that its hard not to take a sip, “It seems like gods vagina”. When it warms up a bit you can smell more of the boozeness. When vigorously poured its pours about a finger of almost white head. This one head isn’t retaining as well as I remember, but it form a ring and some wisps in the middle. Lacing is in clumps. Hazy orange colored beer that looks really peaceful, with no carbonation rising for the bottom.  T & M: This beer is incredible well build. When I think of this beer I think of a constant battle that end in a pleasant balance. The sides fighting are: piney vs citrus hops, sweetness vs bitterness. And the result is this very close to perfect combination. This beer is a perfect example of a beer that walks the fine line between being too hoppy while trying to retain that malty backbone presence. The finish has a dry bitterness to it making the beer awfully hard to put down. Piney in the burps. Scary drinkable. Full bodied with a kick of carbonation.  O: hands down one of the best beers out there not only for the style but overall, its also one of my personal favorites and my favorite Bell’s beer (although I hear good things about Black Notes).

A moderate pour delivered half a finger of off white head over a yellow-orange body. After a minute or so the head has dissolved to a ring. As I peer through the translucent beer I see very little carbonation activity. Thin lacing tries but cannot seem to cling to the side of the glass.  As I sniff the beer, I find that the nose at least lives up to the name. It is like eating a bowl of mandarin oranges, grapefruit and peaches in a pine and flower garden. Now who makes a garden out of pine trees and flowers? Don't know, but that's the smell.  The immediate taste is pine and grapefruit. A floral character quickly picks up and then flows into mandarin oranges and peaches. Alcohol begins to say ""hi!"" after a few sips. This my friends, is good beer.  This beer is straight up medium bodied. Carbonation is there but doesn't make a big deal of itself. It isn't sticky or syrupy, the flavors flow perfectly, it moves over the tongue well and it has the dry finish you expect from the style.

The sweet floral fragrance was amazing.  Body was a bright apricot orange with a slight haziness only broken by the carbonation threads coming up from the bottom.

I've never had a beer quite like this one... different, but in every best possible way. Amazing.  M - Thick, not too much carbonation. That honey really makes an impact on the thickness, but not syrupy by any means.  O - Amazing, remarkable, only good things to say about this stuff.

Smell is absolutely jam packed with citrus hops, complemented by a floral aroma. The taste comes through with an absolute blast of hop flavor. Citrus and floral hops all over the place with a nice bit of pine coming through as well. The malts and honey come together to form a softly sweet backdrop for the hops to shine. It also lends to a silky, smooth mouthfeel with lighter carbonation. The tropical hop aspects linger longer than the bitterness with a sweet hop finish. I usually like my DIPAs dry as possible, but this beer, as far as I've found, is one of a kind in the way the soft sweet malt flavors blend seamlessly into the intense tropical, citrus hop flavors.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",Imperial IPA,98

A: Amazingly clear medium-amber with 1/2-to-1-finger off-white tightly bubbled head with good retention and a few spare lace spots.  S: The aroma is far more resiny on-tap: the floral, tropical fruit notes are definitely dampened compared to the bottled version. The maltiness is still strong with a low-medium caramel contribution.  T: The flavor is also a lot more resiny than the bottled version, and it drinks almost like a lighter-bodied PtE with big pine resin and a much more subdued grapefruit note. The usual psssionfruit and pineapple are not in there.  M: The feel is still superb with a reasonably light body for the style which enhances drinkability.  O: It's still a great beer but not as great as the bottle-conditioned version -- so much for the CO2 is the same forced as yeast-carbonated argument.

287,17112,beagle75,3.85,"Poured from a 12 oz. bottle into a tulip glass.  A: Clear, light amber color with less than one finger of diminishing white foam head. Moderate lacing remains on the glass and scattered streams of bubbles rise throughout the column.  S: Resinous and syrupy, with dank herbaceous and dark citrus hops. Bready malt is faint and clean. No alcohol is detected.  T: Begins sweet, with dominant pine and mixed citrus hop aromatics as well as a thread of almost cakey malt. Acidity is heavy into the middle, where flavors quickly dry out and hop flavors become more green. The finish is moderately bitter and very clean. Faint ethanol lingers on the palate.  M: Medium to thick viscosity, acidic and sticky on the palate, with moderate carbonation.  D/O: This is a fairly effective strong DIPA. Sweetness is pronounced early, backlighting and perhaps detracting slightly from the featured hop aromatics. Despite the sweetness it is not boozy, managing not too stray too far into the 'kitchen sink' trap that other extreme DIPAs often find themselves in. It is dissimilar to Russian River Pliny the Elder; try comparing it to Port Hop 15, Avery Maharaja, Oskar Blues Gubna, or even Alpine Exponential Hoppiness instead.

Thanks so much Bri for the beer! Love ya bro!  Poured and enjoyed in a DFH Signature Glass.  A - Pours a golden amber color. Semi-transparent, slightly cloudy. Little to no head on the initial pour. A slight scattered skim on top of the beer. Moderate lacing left on the glass.  S - A classic IPA smell! Great aroma of citrusy grapefruit mixed with a nice hoppiness.  T - Awesome beer! I can see why this is so highly rated. A fantastic and well balanced mix of citrus along with a nice bitter bite from the hops. A nice backbone of malts lend a nice sweetness so it isn't just a hop bomb. I'm also getting a rather distinct pine taste on the backend. Leaves a great bitter aftertaste. The alcohol is there but not to the point that it is overpowering. I could down several of these but the 10% ABV probably would sneak up on you really quick.  M - A moderate to slighly heavier consistency. A hoppy bitterness lingers after each sip.  O - A top-notch DIPA. It deserves all the accolades that it gets. I loved this beer and would love to be able to get it all the time. Easily one of the best beers I've ever had. I now can say that I've been able to enjoy this classic. Highly recommended.

287,17112,Alieniloquium,4.12,"12 oz. bottle poured into an Alchemist pint glass. Bottled on 1/26/2012. Just picked it up today.  Appearance - Orange amber body. Quite clear. Not much of a head, but it sticks nicely to the glass and leaves some wisps on the surface.  Smell - Wow, it's got a great hop aroma. Up there with the best of em. Citrusy from a distance (literally, from a few feet away), but it's got a dose of pine as I smell it more. Great aroma. Some sweetness comes through, but it's still all about the hops.  Taste - The hop flavor delivers in the front. It's a huge wave of hops that recedes as dramatically as it hits. The citrus gives way to pine, much in the way of the aroma, which gives way to a hefty malt and honey sweetness. Not cloying and not even all that sweet, but it's amazing how much the hops disappear. It still tastes pretty damn good, but not like the best IPAs out there. The finish is boozy and slightly bitter.  Mouthfeel - After the hops drop off, the booze is pretty evident. There's an astringency presumably from the fermented honey. It's not really bitter, either, but still the bitterness is one of the only flavors that lingers.  Overall - I used to think this beer was the bee's knees of IPAs, but having had far more interesting hop profile IPAs, this one hasn't quite risen to its lofty heights as of late. Definitely not one of those ""It was better last year"" people, but I feel my appreciation for it has changed.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",Imperial IPA,98

287,17112,falloutsnow,4.3,"Review from 2012-03-20 Bottle from Hyvee in Council Bluffs, IA Bottled on 2012-01-25 Poured into an willi glass  Able to pour a tall, &gt;2cm head of off-white foam, small and medium size bubbles that together create a very dense, fluffy-looking head. Decreases slowly, over minutes, and leaves some good amounts of lacing and dots on the sides of the glass. Body is orange-brown in color out of light, orange with yellow highlights when in. Somewhat hazed in appearance due to it not being filtered. Carbonation is visible, looks about moderate.  Aroma of mango, orange, tangerine, grapefruit, and peach. Heavy citrus in general, with peach becoming more noticeable as the beer warms. Ethanol becomes increasingly noticeable as the beer warms as well.  Hops are the major flavor component, obviously, but first, there's an opening bit of honey-malty sweetness. Hop flavors include grapefruit, orange, tangerine, and some pine resin, all atop a solid bitterness. Long, lingering fruity bitterness, particularly of grapefruit. The ethanol is a bit more noticeable now, particularly as it warms, though never overpowering.  Medium to medium-heavy bodied, not as heavy as Green Flash's IIPA, which is good, in my opinion. Carbonation is there, but not antagonistic to the mouth, generally creating a fairly smooth, flowing mouthfeel. Slight oiliness from hops (I assume?) actually helps this impression. Finish is semi-dry.  Review from 2012-02-10 Bottle from Hyvee in Council Bluffs, IA Bottled on 2012-01-25 Poured into a tulip glass  Pours a head of about 2cm of off-white foam, fairly small bubbles creating a very dense appearance. Head fades in a few minutes to a thin cap atop the beer, with some fairly good sheets of lacing along the sides of the glass. Body is a burnt orange to copper color, with orange highlights when held to the light. Carbonation is visible, though seems a bit sluggish.  Aroma is a complex mix of hops: citrus (tangerine, weak orange), mango, and some piney hops. Some solvent-like scent, probably ethanol related. No bitterness detected in the nose, so there is some sweetness here, but I can't put a name to any distinct scent, as if from toasted malt or honey or whatever. Assume the distinctness is all lost in the mix of hops.  Taste begins with some slightly bready, sweeter malt flavor on the tip of the tongue. Quickly transitions to intense hop flavors of grapefruit, mango, pineapple, and faint tangerine. Pine hop usage was more noticeable in the scent than taste, but it's somewhat present here. Bitterness is fairly gentle, but persistent through latter half of tasting. Alcohol becomes fairly noticeable on the back third of the tongue, particularly as beer warms; kind of disappointing in this regard given the malt bill that had to go into this. Aftertaste is bitter, pleasantly so. After about halfway through the bottle, I think to myself that this isn't something I could drink every night: nothing is cloying, but the intensity of flavor seems to destroy my desire for anything else as far as food, taste, goes.  Medium to medium-heavy bodied, not as heavy as Green Flash's IIPA, which is good, in my opinion. Carbonation is there, but not antagonistic to the mouth, generally creating a fairly smooth, flowing mouthfeel. Slight oiliness from hops (I assume?) actually helps this impression. Finish is semi-dry.  Overall, I thought this was a pretty solid beer, though the noticeable alcohol was something of a turn-off for me.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",Imperial IPA,98
287,17112,xenjoiii,4.5,"Received two six packs of HopSlam from grinnellj. Thanks again for the trade!  Bottle date - 1/26/2012  A: Poured into a Southampton Snifter. The beer reveals a golden orange color; and builds a one-finger white head that fades quickly leaving beautiful lacing around the glass.  S: Wow. Huge pine notes, and a blast of freshly sliced grapefruits. The smell on this beer is bold, and suits its name well.  T: Hops. Juicy hops. Huge pine, and resin notes up front, which make way to a pleasant sweetness; out the back comes the bitterness.  M: Very light mouthfeel. A moderate amount of carbonation. Very easy to drink; despite that fact that this beer stands at 10% ABV, the alcohol is hidden well.  Overall, I am very pleased with this beer; a fantastic IIPA. For the most part, us New Yorkers are deprived of many of the great IIPA's (especially us who are out on Long Island). I'm glad that I was able to trade for some of this, and I would most certainly do it again. I think it lives up to its hype, despite the complaints of its high price. Bell's delivers.

Then one day I had A Lil' Sumpin Sumpin and my world change, something clicked. I can drink any IPA, for example, I now love Stone Ruination. But I digress. When I tried Hopslam last year, it wasn't for me. This year is a completely different story. I Love this beer. The balance of all the hopes and a little sweetness is great. The aroma brings a smile to my face. The flavor gives a tingle to my loins. Every sip I take, I am happy that I have evolved to love hops!

287,17112,haywire77,4.37,"Bottled on 1/10/2012  Brew poured a very hazy dark orange color that is darker than I would have expected for the style. 1 1/2"" of slightly off white tight knitted head that hung around for a good 5-7 minutes before dissipating to a thin ring around the edges and a choppy light lace pattern in the center. Also good lacing on the sides of the glass that hung around well after the beer was gone.  The smell is amazing. Overly ripe grapefruit and a nice balance of malt character can be found easily. Honey and pine with more fruit than I have ever smelled in a beer. Pineapples and mango go nicely with sugary sweet papaya. I could just sit and smell this and be happy without even drinking it. Well maybe not...  The taste is a hopslam. Piney resin and bitterness abound, but without that tongue tingling goodness that makes the best IPAs stand out. Smooth like a good Dipa should be, but missing that certain something. Maybe the nose set me up a little too high. Peppery finish and a nice complex flavor.  Mouthfeel is slick and oily at first, then very dry on the back end. Kind of strange, but in a good way. Medium bodied and not as thin as are many in the style.  Overall this is a wonderful offering from Bells that I will definitely seek out again next year. A little steep on the price, but I expected such with all of the hype associated with this one. Well above average.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",Imperial IPA,98

A: Pours a golden orange color with a small white head.  S: The initial smell is very complex and dominated with a citrusy hop character! Most of the citrus I'm picking up seems to be lemon.  T: Once again I'm picking up the lemon in the taste along with an explosion of hops! Very bitter yet smooth and drinkable! Also a bit of sweetness in the after taste. Maybe the honey?  M: Very easy to drink! Nice medium thickness with a decent amount of carbonation.  O: Overall this is a very smooth, drinkable beer to be 10% ABV.

S: Sweet hop blend, complex, earthy and sweet malts with the bold and aggressive hoppiness that you would expect from its name.  T: The first was aggressively hoppy. With a slight honey/malt finish. However, this beers strength comes frome consecutive drinking. As my pallette adjsuted, the bitterness retreated and let me really enjoy the base malt/honey flavors. Drinking this beer a few times back to back has made it my new favorite beer.  M: full-body, creamy and smooth. feels very nice to drink.  O: absolutely great. I don't know if it was luck or design that makes this beer exponentially better as you drink it (up to 4 for me, 5 and 6 taste the same as number 4) but this beer is great the first time and even better the 2nd 3rd and 4th time.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",Imperial IPA,98

A nice tropical hop note comes in afterwards though and begins to dominate the nose.  Pours light amber in the glass...smallish head...completely clear.  Bitterness here is quite piercing right off the bat. A great citrus and tropical hop profile...mango and grapefruit...with puckering bitterness extending to the sides of the tongue. The bitterness stays throughout the drink, though a nice, sweet undercurrent shows up that showcases the honey this beer is brewed with...it isn't the toffee or biscuit that some other DIPAs have. Some people have said this beer is excessively sweet, but I'm not really seeing that. I'm tasting a beer with an impressive bitterness with a second fiddle sweetness that doesn't balance the beer completely (more like 2:1 ratio in terms of flavor, I suppose). Resiny on the finish....quite dry. As it warms a bit, the booze starts to peek through but never too bad.  One of the more bitter DIPA's I've had, but unlike some others that really drove up the IBU's, this one has a pretty nice sweetness underneath that helps temper it a bit and gives character.

287,17112,beerthulhu,4.18,"-Thanx to Paul B. (WV). Bottle dated 12/29/11. Consumed 2/6/12.  A: Deep orange honey coloring with a semi-dense clarity. A slight frothy light beige head sits atop with a moderate rate of retention. Inside a slow rise of spacious carbonation, outside on the glass a thin broken ring of lace.  S: The aroma was of sweet honey-pine with some dry grassy notes. Have to be honest was expecting much more pungency here. Moderate complexity, the honey definitely adds some balance and some sweetness to the dry citrusy mixture, while hints of lemon grind linger about though the strength was refrained.  T: Ah here comes the hops. Nice pungent bitterness that cant be held back any longer. The honey, once again shows up adding some balance and sweetness in intermittent bursts before being overtaken by the piney-grass bitterness. Respectable amount of bitterness though is refined and smoothed out by the honey makes this easy to enjoy. Toasty honey malt, spicy bite of citrus with a nice leave of grapefruit/pine bitterness.  M: spicy of citrus, medium bodied but thickens up on longer holds. Sticky hop oils and slick malt lingers behind.  O: Overall a well balanced dipa with a unique influence of honey balances this out for a remarkable, yet smoothing and respectable hop bitterness that is easy and very enjoyable to down. Had a wow moment when realizing this was 10%abv. Just a remarkably smooth and easy dipa especially at this level. The honey no doubt adds a higher OG and ABV% while still maintaining a good balance of sweetness and malt level with the hops.

Definitely delivers on its name. Bitterness persists throughout, but then gives way a little bit to slight malty sweetness. The honey claim on the label is for sure present. Finishes pretty clean with a little lingering hops bitterness.  M- The weight was perfect for the style in my opinion. Fair amount of carbonation, but not so much as to detract from the silky smooth malt profile. The malt hops contrast is really brought out by the weight on the palate.  Overall, it didn't knock my socks off, but was definitely very good. I'm not a big IPA/DIPA guy, but I enjoy trying them, and this one mixed a good ratio of malt to hops.

Suddenly, I was drinking a near-perfect DIPA. Abundant pine and citrus on the nose, and balance on the tongue.  Too bad I am reviewing 2012, then. I found very little to like about this beer. It looked great in the glass.  But that's where the fun ended. I took a whiff, and was happy to note the absence of honey. But where was the rest? This beer is supposed to smell like *something*, for crying out loud. I was halfway through this beer with my nose buried in the glass before I could sense anything at all.  And where was the balance? There's no sweetnes to balance the bitterness. This might have been OK in an aromatic beer, but not in this one.

S - Not as aggressive as I was expecting. Pine and lemon aromas, honey and caramel malt. Hops are balanced with malts and honey sweetness.  T - Taste is a lot more hop forward. Instantly very bitter, like bitter hop juice. Alcohol astringency and some pine and citrus flavors are present. I am very surprised by the degree of alcohol flavor in the beer. It is too much for a beer that is this highly rated. The booze should be better hidden. Some grapefruit and pine needles, honey and caramel.  M - Medium to full body with a slightly drier finish. Booze thins it out a touch and produces some heat.  O - Overall a fine DIPA, but far from world class. Not even close to the Pliny's, Double Sunshines, and Headys of the world. I've heard this year might be a down year, and I'll drink it again, but it doesn't make me say ""wow!""  This beer is a beer I would love to buy a case of at release, but I certainly wouldn't go out of my way for it. I have a similar opinion of Nugget Nectar: I love it and love drinking it, but the fervor around release makes it hard to acquire and therefore hard to just walk in and buy some to enjoy as a daily drink.  EDIT: Drank a second bottle from a fresher batch (1/9), tasted a bit better, but still not world class. Will be drinking bottles from that original 12/30 batch every week or so so see if a few weeks age help it  EDIT2: Drank a 12/29 bottle on 2/26. TONS of pineapple.

287,17112,Pintofbrown,4.08,"I had Hopslam in a shaker pint.  Appearance- A hard pour produces two fingers of off-white, dense foam. The lid is smooth and has a nice smattering of big, bursting bubbles. Retention is good, and sheet lace clings hardily to the side of the pint glass.  The same transparent, copper-orange body has a few tiny carbonation bubbles.  Smell- The nose does not seem quite as sweet as it did when I had it on-tap. I detect pear, pink grapefruit, lemon, and a musty herbalness.  Taste- Bitterness is barely present until the finish, when it finally decides to stick a little to the roof of the mouth. Hopslam has that same herbal mustiness to start, almost like a Columbus hop flavor.  This is followed by the citrus qualities, all grapefruit and lemon. The finish is a little grainy, has a touch of sweetness from the honey, and some hop oil keeping things bitter.  Mouth feel- The feel from the bottle offering is almost as good as it was on tap, a little more watered down and not quite so creamy. Otherwise, still solid and very easy to drink.  No booze here affecting the feel.  Overall- The bottle I reviewed is two weeks old, and maybe this is already starting to be past the prime of what Hopslam should be enjoyed at. The main difference is it is not quite as punchy with the sweetness from the malt, and it is a little less boozy.  It really makes the herbalness stand out more in the nose and on the palate. The bitterness is also working a little differently. Instead of starting to overwhelm the palate and then backing off, it just sits on the roof of the mouth in the finish.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",Imperial IPA,98

On first smell the hop notes are quite nice, but a heavy sweetness takes over.  Flavor is tropical hops and some seriously sweet malt. Notes of pineapple, grapefruit and light pine. They are matched by a heavy, syrupy-sweet stickiness. This is not a dry beer, by any means. I think I can taste the honey. Booze is noticeable, but not too much.  Mouthfeel is medium-thick for the style, with the thick body leaving sticky sweet notes on the palate.  Overall, this really didn't strike me as much better than many other East Coast DIPAs--way too sweet for my liking. I've heard complaints about this year's version, but I haven't had it in past years, so I can't compare. I will say that the bottles in the case I bought seem to vary in sweetness and hop character, to my tastes.

I have had a few bottles of this, all from the same batch. The ones I consumed earlier seemed somewhat boozy, this one really hit the spot. Not sure if my palate was off or what...  A- Pours a one finger head with good lacing and a small ring of a head retained on the sides of the glass. A hazy golden color that is very appealing.  S- Pineapple bomb. The fruit is certainly out in front here and it works very well. A bit of sweet honey and booze.  T- The closest thing I can compare it to is juicy fruit gum in the beginning and middle. The end gives a bit of piney bitterness, but not very much due to the sweet honey and lighter malts that back the beer up. I can see how some would think this is too sweet, but I love it.  M- Smooth, medium-bodied for the style. A little stickiness that lingers, but not a whole lot.  O- A damn fine beer. It's certainly sweet and I'll admit I had a couple bottles that didn't do it for me, but at it's full potential this beer is really delicious.

Approximately a 10 oz serving, poured into one of those horrible narrow tulips that seem to be all the rage now with bars and bottle shops. They should definitely be outlawed!  After purchase I was given a proper Nonic to use. Many thanks to Kevin and staff for that.  After getting a proper glass this ale pours a beautiful two finger head, solid and it lasts, slowly reducing to a ½” head, great lace sticks to the glass. Medium deep gold color.  Nice hop dominated aroma though it could be a little more distinct. Mostly notes of tropical fruit, pineapple and lemon with just a hint of piney resin. Fine golden malt. Quite pleasant.  Crisp entry on the palate of bitter citrusy hops, followed by refined malt and some hints of ale yeast. The bitterness lasts throughout the pour, with a slight sweetness but not overdone. The crisp acidity helps balance everything out. Full mouth feel. Delicious.  Long lingering finish of bitter hops with the hop oils sticking to your mouth.  An unbelievably smooth and easy to drink DIPA. The 10% ABV is not even remotely noticeable. Total enjoyment! As stated above I feel it could be a little more aggressive in the smell, but what’s here is very enjoyable. Well this was certainly an enjoyable brew. However that being said it is much overhyped. There are many DIPA’s out there that are as good as this offering, and much easier to find. Founders Double Trouble, Dogfish Head 90 minute and Weyerbacher Double Simcoe come to mind first but there are others.

287,17112,RickS95,4.82,"Looks the type. Almost orange, very darkish for an IPA. Some coppery notes. The head is bright white and looks slightly creamy. Dissipates quickly to a thin layer of bubbles, then sticks around.  It really smells good. Honey and citrus flowers fill the nose.  Wow, I see what all the fuss is about. It's the best tasting DIPA I've ever had. Really, it's flawless. The honey is first, followed by the citrus. Pineapple. I love it.  I expected to be slammed in the gut. It's not there. The honey balances the bite from the bittering hops, and the pineapple keeps it sweet well into the finish. There is lots of hoppiness, but it's well-balanced.  It's not something I could drink a lot of in one night, but it's something I could drink one of every night. It's really superb.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",Imperial IPA,98
287,17112,BarrytheBear,4.1,"12 oz bottle with a bottle on date of 1/26/12. Have had this beer many years running but never reviewed it from the bottle.  Moderate orange, light haze, and some clumpy islands of surface coverage.  Heavy dose of green apple, pineapple sweetness, touch of yeasty spiciness, sourdough bread, honey, and a pretense of big alcohol.  The worker bees have been busy doing their sinful bee-like business here. Moderate is both sweetness with a crisp green apple bite. Pineapple rind lends a raw bitterness at the finish.  Touch syrupy, low carbonation, and sticky.  Overall, I tend to annoy easily when discussing whether a recipe has changed or so-and-so is less hoppy than last year. Looking back on a past on tap review, I loved this beer. Maybe it was time and place, a food pairing, a moment in time. I do know that at times I had been enamored with HopSlam and others, I've been, shall we say, underwhelmed. Right now, it's a pretty solid DIPA, but doesn't stand as a favorite in the style.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",Imperial IPA,98

There are lots of little bubbles that continuously stream up the side of the glass. Nice hoppy scent.  There is almost a rye taste underneath. It has a dark fruit, semi-grape note to it.

It's just amazing hoppy goodness but I am having trouble separating out the smell. The first things that come to mind are pine and vanilla? There is also some sweet citrus in there, orange-like. Some honey or caramel as well.  T- Delicious as advertised. There definitely is a ""hop slam"" as the bitterness hits you up front but balances nicely with the sweet malt; the bitterness lingers long after as well. The alcohol bite is noticeable but considering this is a 10% beer it's really masked quite well.  M- Great full body, almost creamy. Perfect smooth finish that just leaves you wanting more.

S: Faint citrus (grapefruit, orange), a little pine and grassy-ness. Caramel comes out more as it warms and mingles very well with the honey. Smells good but on the fainter side.  T: Citrus hops and caramel malt first, followed by honey washing over the tongue. The honey covers a decent amount of the underlying hop bitterness (for the better). A little residual, subtle sweetness is evident at the end. Again, the honey and caramel malt work wonderfully together.  M: Medium-full body, a little sticky, medium-light carbonation. Carbonation is a bit rough.  O: The honey is the high point here. Otherwise, not particularly hoppy. Incredibly drinkable for 10%--I would have guessed 6 or 7 without looking at the label.

Poured from a 12 oz. bottle into a pint glass.  A: Slightly cloudy orange with a thin, off-white head that stick around. It leaves moderate lacing.  S: Lots of hops in the nose with a bit of sweetness from the honey. The aroma brings to mind citrus and peaches.  T: Alcohol up front (though not unpleasant) followed by a wash of fruity hops--citrus and peach again, with a tropical tinge. A hearty bitter back balances it well.  M: Mild carbonation and a good, middle-of-the-road texture. Warmth from the hefty 10% ABV.  O: Yum. More subtleties in the hop flavors come out the more you drink.

287,17112,troysoy2,4.75,"A little mid-afternoon hopslam never hurt anyone. Picked up the other day at 1 for the Road, in Wexford, PA. Thanks!  Bottle date 1/10/12, poured into a chalice. The head was impressive, but died down quickly to a frothy film, which left splotchy, yet attractive lacing. The body is a deeper redish gold, and has a nice thickness to it.  The smell is everything I imagined it to be. Hop heaven. Citrusy grapefruit, oily, with a hint of sweetness - almost confectionery. The smell almost leaps out at you from the glass.  The taste is, as promised, quite the slammage of hops. I guess I must officially be a hophead now, as I could appreciate the bitterness and tart grapefruit without being the least bit put off by it. In fact, I don't think hops alone make this a great brew. There's a good complexity to the taste, with sweetness from the honey in the finish, and just the slightest bit of lingering alcohol heat. The mouthfeel has some real body to it, as well as just the right crispness of carbonation.  Ok, so is it worth all the hype? I'd probably say so. It's a great beer, and I really am glad to have the opportunity to try one of the (presumably) ""holy grails"" of the IPA world. This is a great beer, and it's a shame it isn't more widely available.

Mango, Pineapple and god knows what tropical fruits else is in here. O, and fresh cut grass.  T - A good pine taste upfront, light sweet and a tiny touch of honey.

Clear copper and orange with a moderately sized eggshell colored head that eventually leaves spiderwebs and messy ribbons of lace down the glass.  Huge amounts of citrus hop presence in the aroma, accompanied with defined honey sweetness, and a bit of sweet caramel and onion.  The flavor is both very bitter and sweet, with huge amounts of citrus flavor, a bit of caramel and toffee (honey?) sweetness for balance, and a bit of onion.  Medium to full bodied with moderate carbonation. Very nice.

Pungent grapefruit zest stings the nostrils, followed by a wave of honey. A little bit more of those hops come into play, with a concentrated pine sap type of smell behind the initial sweet and citrusy aromas. The alcohol also begins to become a little more apparent as you take deep whiffs of this brew.  Opens with plenty of that pungent hop flavor. Almost tastes like concentrated pine sap and grapefruit juice, then moves into a nice sweet, honey like flavor. A little bit of graham cracker and yellow cake in there too.  Medium bodied and sticky, a little oily on the palate too.  Excellent hop flavor and aroma with a nice sweetness. Always looking forward to this one coming out every year.

Head dissipates fairly quickly leaving a very thin layer on top of the beer and some thin lacing on the glass all the way down.  Smell is of citrus hops, pine, resin. Definitely good but not great.  Taste is citrus up front, but not as juicy or citrus as their Two Hearted Ale. Has a tangy and somewhat bitter aftertaste from the hops that lingers. Some honey in the taste as well but it is faint compared to the hop bitterness and citrus.  Mouthfeel is fairly light for a Double IPA, and the 10% ABV is masked quite well.

Fantastic bright fresh nose. Lovely tropical and citrus fruit with a light and mild sweet candy backbone.  Amazing bright fresh crisp flavor as well. The colder the better IMO. Again lovely range of hop flavor including great tropical and sweet floral characteristics. Great balance and transition from bright hop notes to mild sweet and cotton-candy-like sweetness in the finish.  Mouthfeel in light and crisp with high carbonation.

T - Almost follows the nose identically, but more sweet and with a little pine as well. Absolutely fantastic balance. Just bitter enough to counter the malt, but FULL of hop flavors.

287,17112,alkemy,4.82,"*Update from previous review: Just had this on tap a couple weeks ago (I've only been a bottle suckler) and it's even better. Main thing I noticed was a stronger mango and pine presence with a bit more resiny feel. Yummy!*  Pours gold hinting at orange with a fluffy white head that quickly fades into a thin mesh. Big pine and grapefruit in the nose along with peach, pineapple, mango, and guava...a nice tropical fruitiness. You even catch the slightest bit of caramel. For me, pine was the most prominent taste. It had a strong presence in the front and was the taste that lingered longest. In between there's a nice helping of citrus,pineapple and more malt presence than I was expecting. I typically like a DIPA with a more resiny feel, but I really enjoyed the crisp and clean feel this had. The drinkability is almost stupid. I'd never guess this to be anywhere close to a 10%ABV.

This is a BRUISER in every sense of the word. Excellent. No wonder it get such rave reviews. Glad I stood in line and I am thankful for my 4 bottle allocation.

There's no doubt that this is the best DIPA I have ever had up to this point. Even so, I think my expectations might have risen too high with the reputation that this beer has. Putting that aside though, I can really appreciate what an awesome offering this is. The hoppy aromas and flavors are very well done, as expected, but what sets this beer apart from others is its drinkability.

It's nearly a peachy smell that transforms into a smell of sweet honey.  Taste: Solid Double. Hops abound from the start and then a quick burst of malty goodness followed up by an overbearing alcohol ending that didn't seem to linger. The 10% showed itself right before the lights turned out, near perfect.  Mouthfeel: This beer had sex with my tongue. The carbonated bubbles danced on my tongue then left my mouth feeling sweaty and dry at the same time.  Overall: Good Brew. The best Double IPA I've had this year.

T- Grapefruit, citrus (maybe some tangerine), pine, honey, and some sweet malt...bordering on too sweet. Leaves a strong bitterness on the finish to round out that sweetness, but not at all to the point that you can't handle it. If you are a hophead, you'll love this one.  M- It has a juicy feel to it. I'd call it medium-heavy. Its has the heavier feel of a DIPA but its not a big thick syrup bomb. Its done just right.  O- This beer gets a ton of hype and deservedly so. I've had yet to try Russian River's Pliny the Elder, but if its better than this it would have to be an out of body experience.

It tastes like biting into a fresh mango or something more exotic like dragon fruit. Refreshing finish with a great balanced flavor.  M: So smooth and tasty. Fruity hop oils coat your mouth. Right amount of dryness in the finish and a solid malt presence to keep it from being an intense hop bomb. Way too drinkable for the ABV.  O: Easily one of the better IIPA's available.

Sweet honey. Very nice, not revolutionary.  Starts off with slightly bitter hops with a strong undercurrent of sweetness. Good, but not mind-blowing... then the magic happens. The most amazing part of this beer is the aftertaste. It starts with rich, not cloyingly sweet honey, and then turns to malty goodness, then just... fades away into a delicious cloud. There's no bitterness in the aftertaste, which I find AMAZING.  The other amazing thing? The mouthfeel. It's thick like honey in the mouth, and it sticks around, coating the tongue with flavor.

Ring lasts throughout the drinking process. Carbonation looks to be on point.  Smell: Big fruity nose. Grapefruit, hints of mango, and orange. Zest, flesh, and then some. Mild pine resin brings up the rear. Honey adds a pleasant earthy sweetness. Floral and slightly peppery. Malts add a nice bit of biscuit and caramel to the back. Doughy and citrusy. Touch of alcohol on the back.  Taste: Pine resin and grapefruit zest. Big fleshy fruit hit. Oranges, grapefruit, and a touch of mango. Slightly earthy and peppery. Deep resinous finish. Sweetness from the malts runs to caramel with a nice biscuit undercurrent. Surprising malt presence, but the hops are definitely at the forefront. Booze and a touch of mint.  Mouthfeel: Moderate to high. Carbonation is on the medium side and works well. Dry on the finish.  Overall: It's mighty tasty, but I can't buy in to the hype completely.

287,17112,fergster75,4.62,Appearance: Dark golden orange color probably a finger and half of head  Smell: orange smelling hops. Fantastic  Taste: obviously hops. Lots of orange and grapefruit tastes. I love ipas like this with that hop sting after taste  Mouthfeel: medium body. Not much alcohol feel for 10%.

287,17112,afrokaze,3.93,"Thanks to TheBandit1 for an awesome extra, can't wait to pop that Westy 12! Poured into Sierra Nevada hop glass.  Pours a hazy amber with 2 fingers of head that recede pretty quickly, decent carbonation and great slick lacing that really stays around.  Smell is dominated by floral and dank hops, a bit of sweet malt and honey. Alcohol is a bit too prevalent as it warms up though.  Floral and spicy hops come in a huge wave, followed by the sweet malt and citrus with a little honey. Second wave is earthy/dank hops and a bit of orange/lemon citrus. Alcohol is strong enough to back up the hop slam but seems a bit too ""cutting"" on the palate somehow.  I like the medium body, a bit chewy and sticky to help the bitterness linger for a good amount of time after each sip but the alcohol cuts through more than I remember from last year. The heat is enjoyable.  Overall a great aggressive DIPA but it could use just a bit of smoothing around the edges. The hop selection is a bit one-sided, but very nice overall for a sweeter DIPA.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",Imperial IPA,98

S: Big, juicy citrus hop aroma with some malt and alcohol presence, but as all DIPAs should be, this is definitely dominated by the hops.

M: Medium body and moderate carbonation, slightly resinous, finishes clean and slightly dry.  O: Delicious, highly drinkable DIPA, the 10% ABV is incorporated incredibly well.

Some pine and floral hop flavours up front with some alcohol presence as well as citrusy hop flavours of tangerine, lemon, pineapple and orange. This gives way to a honey and almost nutty finish with more orange citrus hop flavours. Definite waves of flavours in this beer.  M: Medium viscosity with a medium-to-high level of carbonation.

287,17112,CBlack85,4.74,"Poured from a 12 oz bottle into a New Belgium Globe Glass  The beer pours a crystal clear golden amber color with a big rocky head that lasts forever, leaving a small cap that lasts until the glass is empty. Surprisingly there is not much in the way of lacing  The aroma is sweet and inviting, comprised mostly of apricot, mango, citrus fruits, and just a hint of honey. There is also to a lesser degree, a nice bready, toasty malt presence that becomes more prevalent as it warms. There is also a more pronounced alcohol presence than I remember from previous years.  The taste is very smooth for such a big beer. A nice bitterness is immediately noticeable, that breaks down into more citrusy and piney components. There is also some of the apricot and mango that were present in the aroma. As the beer warms the maltiness is able to break through the hops and provide a bit of biscuit/toast flavors, and some caramel sweetness that helps balances the beer out. The honey is barely perceptible, but offers a bit of complexity that makes this beer so much better than many other IIPA's.  Overall the beer is terrific, and lives up to the hype. Incredibly easy to drink. It's a shame that this beer only comes around once a year.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",Imperial IPA,98
287,17112,afoltz2,2.46,"I'm one of the few that wasn't head over heels for this brew, and the reason is very simple - Hopslam has a very strong mango flavor to it, and I don't care for mango. That flavor even comes through in the smell, which I confirmed from another person before I poured it out of the bottle.  I liked the way the brew felt due to the hoppiness, but the end of each sip proved too citrusy for me. The beer, despite a high ABV, did not have a strong alcohol taste, which was nice, and had a good appearance in the glass.  HopHeads who love this beer and appreciate the citrus flavor rightly make this their beer of choice, my brew taste just runs towards ambers & stouts.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",Imperial IPA,98

This is something I don't recall as much from last year. I am reminded it is 10%.  M- Carbonation is slightly higher than some in this style. It is still very smooth with a medium creamy body.

Aroma of citrusy hops and toasted bread. Taste is bursting with hops: citrusy-orange-grapefruit zest and a bit of pithy bitterness, tropical fruits, pine needles, and a nice sensation of honey-drizzled toasted bread coming through for a very nice balance. Medium mouthfeel, quite smooth and extremely drinkable for the style (where's the alcohol?).

A blast of citrusy hops up front and a smooth sweet honey flavor on the back end. Finishes with lingering bitterness. A touch of alcohol as it warms.  M: A very smooth DIPA! Maybe it's the added honey that gives this beer such a smooth mouthfeel. Hops and honey coat the mouth. Moderate body with light carbonation.  Overall this is a top notch DIPA. One of the best.

T - Starts out with some sweetness from the honey then boom, the bitterness of the citrus hops come into play. Finish is dry and bitter but such a nice rounded smoothness from the honey. Nearly perfect balance of hops and malt thanks to the honey.  M - Medium body with sticky hop goodness coating the entire mouth.  O - What can I say that all the reviews haven't said before?

Lots of hops follow, mostly earthy and spicy here, with a bit of bitter grapefruit. Finish is strongly bitter, but well balanced by the malt.  M: Full mouthfeel, but not heavy. This much hops bitterness in the finish could easily go highly astringent, but there's not much of that at all. Great, long linger.  O: Exceptional balance. Dangerously drinkable 10%.

Pours a slightly opaque dark lemon yellow with a medium size fluffy white head that slowly recedes leaving sticky resinous lacing along the side of the glass and a small cap of white foam.  Aromas are burst out of the glass highlighted by a citrus overload; clementine, lemon, grapefruit, blood orange, etc. After you get past the hops, and the beer warms, you can detect the sweet honey maltiness. I have encountered beers with a sweet honey bready maltiness, but this smells like honey which is quite pleasant and unique.  The tastes directly follow the nose but reverse like most DIPAs. The sweet honey and biscuity maltiness opens up and assaults the palate, but then immediately you are assaulted with grapefruit, blood orange and pineapple hop flavors. Lemony bitterness lingers on the palate for a decent amount of time after you sip.  The mouthfeel is medium bodied with medium carbonation. The finish is semi-sweet from the honey yet in the end the bitterness wins out.  Overall, for my first experience with HopSlam, I was quite pleased. The high ABV seeks up on you and is no where detectable, which makes it quite dangerous. I do have to say that I am slightly dissapointed overall. While this is a super beer, it is by no means my favorite DIPA, mainly because of its potency and lingering bitterness despite the ample sweet honey flavors.

If you evaluate the taste as a whole, there aren't many holes to poke in it. It literally begs you to take another sip. The easiest drinking 10% IPA in existence. Not hard to see where the hype comes from. The aftertaste/late palette is absolutely incredible. All hop flavor, no bitterness.  Mouthfeel: Medium-bodied. Carbed enough to not be sweet or cloying.

There is no other way to describe how this beer smells other than how the Borg from Star Trek would describe it: It is perfection.  The liquor is a perfectly clear medium orange color, like honey. The head is nice and fluffy, and leaves some of the most prominent, obvious, and gorgeous lacing I have ever seen. Visible carbonation supporting the head from the etched glassware gives this beer a little extra oomph.  To truly enjoy this, I would chill it, then let it sit out for 30 minutes before opening it. This review is of the third one that I have had, and by far, this is the best serving temperature, probably right around 47°F. Immediately, I get hit with hops, floral in nature, like a punch in the face by Mike Tyson wearing a glove made of hops. The bitterness is solid, but I get a nice sweetness to it, like a mix of toffee and caramel. It's also a tad biscuity. The hops linger though the finish, but so does the alcohol. It's somewhat boozy, this one. This what I would expect to taste if I jumped into a pile of freshly harvested hop cones with my mouth open.  Hopslam has a full body, or at least on the very high-end of medium bodied. Carbonation is perfect at a nice modest level. You taste the beer, not the carbonation bite.  Overall, there isn't anything bad I can say about this beer. The entire experience draws me back to the picture on the bottle, a man being crushed by a giant hop cone. This is what drinking Hopslam feels like. Excellent job Bell's, in creating an IPA that needs to be sipped to be appreciated.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",Imperial IPA,98
287,17112,UnknownKoger,4.62,"Finally got a 6 pack of this. As a West Coast person, I'm very excited to finally try this. Bottle date of 1/9/12. Poured into Bruery tulip.  Appearance is golden. Finger thick head dissipates into a ring with little islands. Smell is absolutely awesome. The hops are there and the sweetness of the honey. My mouth is watering.  Taste is outstanding. It's hoppy, but it's not overwhelming (or maybe my palate is just getting used to extremely hopped beers). There is a sweetness that accentuates the fruity and floral notes of the hops.  Mouthfeel, for 10%abv, is great. Goes down smooth and the aftertaste lingers in the mouth.  Overall, it's outstanding. It's really good. Cheers!",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",Imperial IPA,98
287,17112,cheers405,4.52,by far the best beer i have had in awhile. i debated picking up a six pack for myself however with it being so limited i let our customers have at it :) luckily we have the best customers ever and one was kind enough to hand a bottle over as i was instructed to enjoy and soooo i did. not bitter at all definitely something to sip on and enjoy to the very end,Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",Imperial IPA,98
287,17112,TenHornsProud,4.47,"Major thanks to brkstoutfiend for the trade!  Pours a clear light orange with a big white, fluffy head that lingers and laces.  Smells of dank, fruity hops. Notes of grapefruit, plum, pear, peach mix with an herbally, earthy hop character. Not fruity in the Nelson hop kind of way...more American style hop character with, perhaps, some noble hops. Bready/cracker hints of malt and alcohol are present.  Taste is up front cracker that instantly goes into a tropical fruit flavor while blending into a more pine/earthy character mixed with tropical fruit that finishes on a bitter, fruity note. The finish morphs from fruity to malty to earthy...very interesting and not like other DIPAs (Pliny for example). Notes of apple, pear, stone fruit, and grapefruit are prevalent. It makes me think of fruit snacks like Gushers.  Medium to lighter body with medium to lighter carbonation works well for the beer. The taste is more complex and heavy than the actual body of the beer, which is a good thing. Alcohol is present and warming but not out of balance.  Well, this is easily one of the best DIPAs I've had. It is so different in some ways from Pliny that it is hard to draw a comparison. Bready, malty, complex hop character (fruity, dank, earthy), and just well balanced overall. I'm glad I got to try it fresh.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",Imperial IPA,98
287,17112,drgarage,3.03,"Sampled three bottles from a sixer in Michigan bottled on Jan. 9.  A: Nice, golden IPA, nice head with minimal lacing. Pretty much what you look for, but nothing spectacular.  S: Nice citrus hops, but a bit faint for my liking. Pales next to Lagunitas Sucks, for example.  T: Big and sticky and lacking in complexity. I get no honey at all, and the hops just don't come together in any interesting way. It stuns me that many have rated this higher than both Younger and Elder, each of which is significantly superior. I am impressed with how successfully the high ABV is hidden.  M: A bit thin. Good carbonation, nothing to write home about.  O: A good solid DIPA, but nothing to write home about. I'm from Michigan, so I was ready to have my socks knocked off. I can only conclude that anyone rating this above the best west-coast IPAs, Heady Topper, etc., have never had any of those fresh. This just isn't terribly special. Disappointing.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",Imperial IPA,98
287,17112,B33R501,3.12,"Second (re) review Friday nite after my cheesteak and my sharp cheese you know what drinking my last 2 hopslams this beer doesn't have much going on tonite at all, kinda bland and tasteless, doesn't pare well with dinner at all. Give me a celebration all day, yea that goes well with everything. . Well. Ok I get it the hype and the demand for this beer. But, honestly, for me, this year is just like last year, I'm glad I got my 6, and enjoyed it, but it doesn't make my favorite list and it's not one of those beers I miss when its gone. For my money, here's hoping Hop 15 makes it to distribution this February, time to bug the brewer as I call it. And 9 month old Central Waters Illumination blows this away, that's the beer I'm looking forward to this year, gotta try it fresh, yea I'm one of that ""niche"" who doesn't mind aged ipas. And the best thing about this beer is i got my sixer for $17, yes $17 dollars, I got a case @Shangys for $69 and sold 3 sixes to a retailer for $52 cost. I don't need any $$$ from this, I'm happy to pay the $ 17, last year i paid $28 for my sixer, ridiculous. All that being said ...  Pours beautiful hazy golden, big bitter smell of citrus hops with a little alcohol. Taste follows, grapefruit, lemon, orange hops with a nice bitter orange peel aftertaste. Very drinkable, the boozy finish does not bother me at all, I'm a boozehead. I'm on my 3rd, hammered, and this beer actually (like most alcohol) gets better as you go.  If I'm reviewing the first beer today, it's way overhyped, now on the 3rd, well, let's just say I'm glad I paid $17 not $28 for this sixer. If I could let one sit for 6 months in the frig I'd love to see what its like then.  Overall its good, but not necessarily better than many other less hyped beers.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",Imperial IPA,98
287,17112,Retail1LO,4.47,"FINALLY. My first EVER Hopslam. DaveHack sent me this as part of his box from Poker BIF 2.0. For this special occasion, I'm also Christening my Hill Farmstead nonic pint glass. What a pair. On with it...  Beer pours a lovely translucent golden straw haze with roughly a fingers width head atop it. The head recedes quickly, and lacing is thin and minimal. The smell is outstanding. Loads of hops and loads of citrus. Just the way I want my IPA's to smell. The taste is on part with the nose. Fabulous. Again, more hops, and even MORE citrus. This is a well balanced beer in my opinion. The finish is sweet and slightly hot, but this is far from a booze bomb, in my opinion. It'll warm the back of your throat and stomach though, no doubt. Overall, this is very solid. I thoroughly enjoyed this.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",Imperial IPA,98
287,17112,Jimmys,4.39,"yeah Hopslam! i had to do all kinds of regrettable things to get 6 of these. packaged 1/9/12.  A: a slight haze on a vibrantly bright orange body. head is slightly off-white with reasonable retention. leaves some pretty lacing behind.  S: big stinky bag of weed. piney and citrus all at once. honeydew. great showcase of american hops. each visit to the glass is just a reinforcement of that. seems that way no matter how long the glass sits.  T: the bitterness is strong in this one. and throughout. there is an underlying sweetness, probably from the honey, but the hops are definitely the big dawg here. a very resinous pine flavor. similar to the nose. there is enough malt and honey sweetness to oh so slightly keep the bitterness in check, but like i said this is still a prime showing of american hops.  M: moderate/high amount of fizz. full bodied for sure.  D: wow, these are tasty. had to take 2 bottles just to solidify my review. tons of aroma and tons of flavor. a super big DIPA, but drinks well and is relatively crushable. only thing slowing me down is the ABV. 6 of these would be a good time.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",Imperial IPA,98

S - Strong citrus notes with honey and some pine present as well. A very strong and hoppy smell - I picked it up as soon as I opened the bottle.  T - Nice strong hops flavors that blend nicely with the honey and citrus notes. A bit of bitterness from the hops, but not quite in the form of a hopbomb.  M - Medium bodied, great carbonation level and very creamy and drinkable. Smooth, and it hides the 10% pretty well. Amazing mouthfeel for a DIPA.  O - Hopslam is one of the best DIPAs out there and well worth the hype/price. I wish this wasn't quite the rarity that it is, but perhaps that is some of the charm.

Ya, this is my first really hyped beer so I'm a little anxious to say the least.  A- Poured into my tulip leaving about 2oz left in the bottle. Nice (honey)golden color with about a finger head. A little haze but suits it well.  S- Should be in the same sentence as the seal break since it exploded with fragrance as soon as I cracked it. I am getting incredible pineapple, tropical fruit notes along with the sweet honey. Probably my favorite smell in a beer so far.  T- Bitterness and then the honey and sweetness. A little boozey but mellows out the honey. Great taste, hyped, but still amazing.  M- Smooth and incredibly drinkable. I want to have 10 of these back to back, but with 10% ABV, thats probably not advisable(not to mention I only have 3).  O- Very satisfied I got my hands on this. Yes it is hyped, but thats part of the fun. If I can imagine this beer as a godsend, and thus improves my entire experience, why the hell not? Its a great beer and should be sought out.

287,17112,jayhawk73,4.85,"Bottled Jan. 9, 2012- Just at 2 weeks old at the time of review.  Pours a beautiful gold color with a nice one finger off white head. Really good lacing on the side of my snifter. Somewhat clear in appearance, and nice amount of bubbles coming up from the bottom of the glass. The nose is amazing: pineapple, mango, orange, peach- very citrus oriented, and extremely well balanced. The taste even steps it up a notch. One drink and my palate screams for mercy.. thus the name 'Hopslam'. I get the citrus flavors, honey, slight malt in the background, and some other grassy/earthy hops. Amazingly, none of the 10% alcohol is evident at all. Just really well balanced and ultimately tasty. The mouthfeel is exquisite as well. It has the citrus/honey sweetness with some malt, and then the hops just wrecking your palate on the backside. Perfectly carbonated and executed. Overall, this is definitely one of my favorite seasonal beers- and favorite beers period. It's amazing, and I'm glad I still have five left in my fridge.

287,17112,kevanb,4.33,"It pours a dark straw, honey color with a nice finger of white bubbly head on top. Nice cloudy texture, but no noticeable sediment or hop residue floating in the glass, a bubble or two rising to the top of the glass. The aroma is great, big citrus character, grapefruit, lemon zest, some pineapple, and a nice amount of pine makes its presence known. Alcohol is definitely present, tingles the nose ever so slightly, a faint biscuit aroma is there as well. Bitter hops greet your tongue right off the bat, grapefruit is there, big pine notes, much more pronounced than the aroma leads on, a big sweetness from the honey comes through that plays well with the natural sweetness from the higher levels of alcohol. Faint biscuit is again at the finish, but this is a bitter hop monster, but that dash of sweetness really helps this one, it goes down so easily. Very crisp body, much bubblier and zingier than the appearance leads on, yet still has a big wet punch to it.  Verdict: This is a slam dunk from Bell’s, and with a year round beer like Two Hearted, it comes as no surprise. Big bitter hops with a nice sweetness that makes this one go down dangerously fast for 10% ABV.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",Imperial IPA,98

287,17112,siege06nd,4.13,"Poured from a bottle into my Jackie O's tulip...  Bottle dated 12.29.2011...  A: Pours a clear golden orange color with just a tinge of copper, like a summer sunset. A beautiful two finger eggshell white head erupts from a conservative pour and slowly recedes to a one finger head. The lacing positively blankets the glass, a super thick sheen that refuses to fall down. The thickness and uniformity of the head is astounding. If there are better looking IPAs out there, I have yet to see them. Out-freakin-standing.  S: Really nice. Crushed pineapple explodes off the nose, along with a good amount of honey and candied citrus. An absolute citrus bomb here. Very little in the way of bitterness, maybe just the slightest hint of pine resin. Very very good, but perhaps just a bit too smooth for its own good. In need of some malt and bitterness to take some of the edge off.  T: Man this is really sweet, and by that I mean sticky and saccharine. A lot of sweet creamy pineapple, candied citrus, and some pine resin. But much of it is overwhelmed by cloying honey. It really mellows out what could be a hop bomb. The booze is noticeable, but not offensive. The flavors are a little bit muddled, and somewhat of a letdown from the nose. The sweetness is slightly overdone.  M: Too syrupy and too cloying. Lacking a nice crisp bite. Flavors are decently balanced, carbonation may be a bit lackluster.  O: Well it is one of the best looking and smelling IPAs around. But the taste is overly sweet and the mouthfeel overly sticky. I know it's an Imperial IPA, but I'd rather they let those hops shine than covering them up with honey. Reminds me of drinking soda fountain extract...too over the top. A unique beer and certainly tasty, but I wouldn't and don't feel the need to revisit this one over and over.

Amazed with the fruit smells! Taste is on par with the smell, definitely hop forward at first, while the honey and malts hit halfway through. Finish is very smooth. Very tasty yet so complex. Mouthfeel is slight carbonation with a silky smooth finish. Not too boozy, but can taste just enough to feel its presence.  Overall, one of the best DIPA I've had the opportunity to sample.

287,17112,dejrrma,4.5,"$2.50 per 12 oz bottle at The Beer Growler (Avondale location) and $17 (with tax) for a six pack. Bottled 1/10/12 (printed on back label). Poured into a snifter.  This was the first time I had hopslam. Let me start by saying that I was initially a little disappointed. Although the beer was good, Founder's Double Trouble blew me away more. I was lucky enough to get 3 six packs and a couple of extra bottles (totalling around $57). About half of the bottles was cloying and boozey and not as hoppy as I expected. However, someone suggested I let them sit for a week more or two. The results were amazing. That boozyness was gone and though the delicious honey was present, it wasn't overpowering the hops. It also enhanced the smell to where I could detect more aromas.  a- hazey orange color, a 1/2 inch of head that maintains for a while, and some thick lacing that eventually slides off.  s- honey (so much honey!), strong citrus (grapefruit), lemon zest, hops, and a good deal of mango as well. really strong aromas coming through from this one, and i can smell it from a foot or two away.  t- hoppy and bitter at first, lots of citrus that persist and some pine. pretty good malt background, and finishing with a soothing honey (incredible!) aftertaste.  m- creamy and medium bodied. resiny, and leaves the mouth dry. all the flavors just soak the palate. the 10% abv is not very apparent, but i feel some of the boozyness as it goes down.  o- highly enjoyable beer, and i would definitely buy again. i'm really excited that i got the chance to try it.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",Imperial IPA,98

Amazing aroma of clean bittersweet citrus bursts out of my Piraat tulip. Up close, there's a nice mix of tropical and citrus fruits, resiny pine, and candy sweetness. ""I say this with a staunch record of unblemished heterosexuality: It's fabulous.""  Tropical fruit and pine step up on the palate with citrus in back. Simcoe is not trying to hide -- intense characteristic spicy pineapple dominates. There's also mango, grapefruit, orange, and apple. A little flavor from the honey, noticeable alcohol (especially apparent with food) and an excellent slightly sweet malt backbone round things out. Solid punch of bitterness, but nothing even a drive-by hophead couldn't handle.  Carbonation is moderate, which helps keep the fairly hefty, oily body in check. There's nothing I can criticize about this beer without absolutely nitpicking. Hopslam is amazing beer. I think a word that sums it up perfectly is ""focused.""

There's a very nice earthy bitterness to it, with a slight sweet note towards the back that I attribute from the honey.  T: Wow. This is so much better than I remember. Either that or I simply appreciate this beer so much more. A wash of bitter hop oils, pineapple and astringent grapefruit notes start off. Through the mid-palate the pink grapefruit intensifies, and trails off with a sweet honey and caramel malt flavor. So complex and delicious.  M: Body is medium to full with ample carbonation. Lots of tiny bubbles on the tongue give this a smooth and almost silky texture. A bit of alcohol heat in the chest.  Well, honestly this beer is simply awesome.

I can barely notice the alcohol presence in this monster.  Taste: Big awesome hop flavor upfront, wit a tropical taste as it is mid way down and finishes a nice and crisp zest making for an amazing first sip. The fruit seems to be a mango-grapefruit mix with a hint of lemon or lime flavor in there as well. I have a hard time even tasting the alcohol in this big DIPA.  Mouthfeel: The carbonation is wonderful, there are small bubbles rather than some other IPA's I have had in the past that are large and diminish the taste. It is medium bodied and crisp as it goes down.  Overall: I love this beer, I have officially jumped on board the hype train.

Nice two-finger head from a rather vigorous pour that has receded to a thick ring and splotchy surface foam. The lacing is lacking.  Smell: Huge hops. Tropical fruit medley. Tart mango, starfruit, papaya. The malt presence is impressive, too (although, obviously not in the forefront). I get some honey and malt breadiness to bout with these mega green hops. Pretty noticeable alcohol smack in that nose, as well. I mean, we're talking 10% here. Alright, time to drink...  Taste: Big leafy hops with a tropical fruit twist. Some citrus. Picking up floral honey, lime, pineapple, and almost celery juice/green vegetable juice in the finish. My girlfriend tossed up that she tastes cucumber skin, and that ain't far off. Bitter on the tart side, but very bitter (and not astringent in any way). Clean and salty finish where the alcohol is uncovered a bit. Amazingly deceptive. Great malt sweetness underlying with a doughy breadth. More flavors uncover as it warms; some tangerine, some white pepper spiciness... this is one juicy IIPA.  Mouthfeel: Deceptive carbonation... it's not showing in the glass, but I can feel it scraping my tongue. This beer is slightly heavier than just medium-bodied. Somewhat sticky. I MUST add that this beer is ridiculously drinkable. That alcohol is really only prominent in the nose, at first. And then, once you've started drinking, you can't detect it anymore (uh-oh).  Overall: A few big pluses with this beer for the style: not overly sweet, no shortness of hop bitterness, not difficult to drink, superb aromatics.

S- This beer smells amazing. Lots of citrus with some mild honey tones.  T- Again, lots of citrus. The hops aren't as strong as expected, but instead are balanced out by the honey. I know others think it might be too sweet, but to me, the combination makes this an incredible DIPA. The alcohol is hidden very well, and I would never have expected this was 10%.

287,17112,GardenWaters,4.04,"Bottled on 1/6/12. Experienced on 1/22/12. Poured from 12oz bottle into Boulevard tulip.  A: Poured a beautiful copper color with outstanding clarity. Produced a light, white, 1cm head which dissipated almost instantly. Lacing nearly absent.  S: Wet hops and honey. Slightly boozy.  T: Sweet, with lots of honey. Maybe a bit too much honey for my tastebuds. Pineapple, grapefruit, orange-peel, lemon are also present. IMO, this beer reminds me of Hoppin' Frog's Raw Hop Imperial Pale Ale. Again, that's only my opinion.  M: Light-bodied with moderate to high carbonation. Finishes clean and without any lingering bitterness. Balance is out of this world!  O: This is truly a unique and flavorful beer, though not what I expected considering all the hype. I was surprised by the sweetness, yet disappointed with the lack of bitterness of this brew; not what I expected from a DIPA called ""Hopslam"". Perhaps Bell's intention was to create the most well-balanced DIPA ever... which I believe they did. Either way, this beer is dangerously smooth and drinks way to easy for a brew with 10% ABV. However, if I wanted a DIPA, this probably wouldn't be the first beer that comes to mind.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",Imperial IPA,98
287,17112,fvernon,4.5,"Poured at 55 degrees into a Bell's tulip glass; this has long been a late-winter favorite but I haven't gotten around to reviewing it yet.  The pour is the color of clover honey with a thick 2.5 inch head - I had to let it sit for a bit before clearing out the bottle. The head stuck around for a minute or two, but worked its way down and left pretty strong lacing on the sides of the glass.  The smell is primarily of honeysuckle and then resinous hops. Actually, the aroma feels more sweet-forward than hop-forward to me this year. The initial sip gives me the same impression - loads of wildflower honey flavor up front but balanced extremely well by the hoppy bitterness. The honey fades quickly, and the hops take over for the finish.  The feel isn't cloying, but it is thick. The abv is hidden incredibly well, but I can catch the quick burn at the end. All around a wonderful midwest DIPA; more floral than bitter, and I'm glad to have it in such abundance.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",Imperial IPA,98
287,17112,mwill7287,4.4,"Bottling date on the label reads ""12/29/11"".  Appearance: Pours a bright orange with a slight haze in the body. A thin white head created by a slow pour quickly recedes to a mere lacing atop the brew. Lively carbonation bubbles scurry about my tulip glass. Virtually no lacing is left behind on the side of the glass post-brew. 4.25  Smell: A strong sappy, piney nose foretells the hop adventure I am about to embark on. Grapefruit, orange, lemon citrus meld beautifully with a dollop of sweetness from the honey. 4.25  Taste: While I expected an in-your-face assault of hops, my first few sips prove this brew is much more balanced and subtle. The juicy citrus and sappy pine are certainly there, but they walk in slowly rather than in a mad rush. The brew is well balanced with a solid malt backbone and the just noticeable honey. Bitterness is moderate and, with the overall taste, increases in intensity with warmth. The pine and grass, as well as some floral notes, open up nicely with warmth. 4.5  Mouthfeel: Light bodied and on the higher end of carbonation. Lingering bitterness in the aftertaste. Only a tad sticky from the generous hops. Goes down very smooth - too smooth for this big of a DIPA! 4.75  Overall: This is apparently high in ABV (I can tell after I've finished) and is definitely high in hops, yet with a lighter body and a solid malt backbone, Hopslam is a very drinkable beer. Definitely up there with the best IPAs out there, especially those from these parts of the country. 4.5",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",Imperial IPA,98

Scent is grapefruit, grapefruit, grapefruit. I don't find much else.  Taste is very sweet. The first sip is like grapefruit juice without the sour taste on the tongue. Very unexpected. Had not had this before and was expecting a bit more pronounced bittering hops flavor. This was all sweet and grapefruit. Later tastes were a bit less pronounced, but sweet.  Finished clean with later tastes drying out.  Overall I was more surprised than impressed. Not what I was expecting from a beer so highly raved about. I was glad that I got to taste it, but would not buy again unless I wanted a VERY sweet beer with a one-dimensional flavors.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",Imperial IPA,98
287,17112,ahq514,4.5,"Poured from 12 oz bottle into tulip glass.  Pours a nice golden color that is mostly translucent. Solid finger head, white and fluffy. Appears to have lower carbonation. Laces like a champ, coating almost everywhere that the beer touched.  Beautiful aroma. Great balance between malt and hops. As far as hops go, I get pineapple, a little citrus, and pine. Touch of honey. The malt aroma is sweet with a touch of caramel. Great complement of the hops while letting them shine through.  Different than I remember from last year, but then again my palate has changed a ton. Malt comes through first with a nice sweetness. Quickly transitions into a bitterness from the hops as well as a blend of the aromas that I got in the nose. Pineapple, citrus, and pine. The bitterness lingers on the palate for a bit.  Good mediumish body and lower carbonation. Damn drinkable for a 10% beer.  A great dipa and beer in general. Deserves to be where it is in the ratings. Really enjoy the balance of this beer. A lot of the top rated ipas I end up thinking are too hop forward with not enough malt to balance, but this is good. Good stuff.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",Imperial IPA,98

Good alcohol legs. S- Hops galore, Lots of pine and tons and tons of citrus fruits. Grapefruit and lime. Some sweetness from the honey. Awesome stuff. T- Excellent hop profile here and the honey definitely shines through here as well. The hops are all over the board, citrusy, piney and a little bit skunky. Blends insanely well and is balanced as could be. The bitterness and the sweetness really are in perfect harmony. Some faint alcohol tastes but at 10%, its nearly impossible to hide. M- Bitter aftertaste but the hops are very refreshing. Carbonated well and goes down smooth. O- This beer is all that and a bag of chips. Its one of the Best DIPA's around. It is strong but not hard to drink; its hoppy but still balanced. Get it while you still can.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",Imperial IPA,98

S - Nose is plenty of floral hops with caramel and some lemon.  T - Pineapple dominates. It fades away, though, leaving a bitter pine with a perfectly-balanced orange peel at the finish.  M - The body is pretty thick even for a dipa. Carbonation is moderate to high and gives the beer a creamy body.  O - I was really disappointed with this brew. I have been wanting to try it for a long time and I had it alongside Abrasive last night and Abrasive blew it away.

287,17112,output01x,4.62,"Poured from a 12 oz. capped bottle (PKGD 12/29/11) into a pint glass.  A strong pour yields a 1-finger cream-colored head that fades after a couple minutes to a thick dusting and thick foam ring. The body is a translucent golden amber with just a few small, slow-rising carbonation bubbles. Thick lacing can be seen coating every available bit of glass throughout consumption.  The nose is a bouquet of citrus. Notes of mandarin orange, grapefruit, honeydew, and pineapple, and mango are all present.  Just like the nose, tropical citrus flavors explode at the start of each sip with notes of orange, grapefruit, and mango. As the beer is swallowed the tropical citrus flavors become even stronger. Suddenly pineapple, tangerine, and honey join the other flavors in assaulting your taste buds. A slightly piny bitterness comes in at the end as an aftertaste along with just a hint of rum-like alcohol.  Medium to full bodied with tingly carbonation, this beer is way too drinkable for 10% ABV. The body is a little sticky and very coating but surprisingly smooth and enjoyable. The carbonation is a rather fizzy but it definitely needs to be to make this beer as refreshing and enjoyable as it is.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",Imperial IPA,98

The hops smelled mostly of grapefruit. I also picked up some floral notes and some grassy notes as the beer got warmer. There was a lot going on with the aromas and was quite pleasant. The grapefruit flavor in this beer is big and heavy. There is a nice caramel malt back up to balance the hops very nicely. The body is medium to full. I get a crispness from the carbonation which comes right before the resinous hop punch. The malts follow the hops quite nicely. There is an after taste but doesn't linger because of the balance between hops and malts. This is one of my favorite beers. The hops smell great and deliver bold flavors. The malts create a subtle aftertaste making this one very balanced beer.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",Imperial IPA,98

The smell is absolutely the best I've experienced to date - a cacophony of citrus scents that is intoxicating. This is where this beer really stands out. Even my wife, who hates the smell of any beer, said ""That's the least-offensive smelling beer I've ever smelled"", which is quite an endorsement for her. The taste is not quite as powerfully citrus as the scent would lead you to think, but grapefruity bitterness comes through big time. There is enough of a malty and honey sweetness to provide some semblance of balance. Very nice mouthfeel adds to the experience.

I was so excited that Hopslam was available, because some of the forums I read said that Hopslam wasn't coming out until the first week of February 2012. I bought a six-pack of Hopslam at the Martin's Grocery Store in Stevensville, Michigan on 1-20-12.  The appearance was a fruity orange-yellow with a one finger head with a medium-hard pour. The head-foam was the tastiest I ever remember tasting of any beer - ever!  The smell was fruity, citrousy, and hoppy. Very appealing smell!  The taste and mouthfeel this year was better than last year's. Lot's of high gravity alcohol and full of hops....duh. Tangy and very appealing to my pallette.  2016 UPDATE: Absolutely amazing batch just like previous years. This appears to be the first year of cans only. $16.99 a six pack.  2017 UPDATE: Not sure if I got a bad case, but definitely not as good as the 2016 batch. Even did a side-by-side comparison to the aged 2016 batch and 2016 was better.....hands down!

A frothy one finger head sits atop this masterpiece and sticks around a while. Lacing is excellent. I don't see how you can improve upon this at all. Just gorgeous.  S: I remember the smell to be much more ""in your face"". I actually have to swirl the glass to wake up the aromas. Grapefruit notes dominate...definitely leans toward the fruity citrusy hop varieties overall. Peach. Mango. Some earthy/floral/dankness to it as well. A hint of sweetness.  T/M: Such a pleasant DIPA. I can't believe this is a 10% beer. The bitterness is there at the front, but isn't harsh at all. Then it hits with flavors of grapefruit and mango...peach, orange peel. Lemon-scented soap suds. The taste never really bites you, which is a compliment. Overall a soft and delicate beer. Finishes with a good bit of dryness on the palate. Carbonation is right where it should be...maybe even just a tad low. And I'd call it medium bodied - no more, no less.  O: Not quite how I remembered it. This beer has a soft, but firm bitterness with massive notes of grapefruit and tropical fruits in both the aroma and taste. The 10% is nonexistant in the taste, but watch out! This is is one sneaky beer. Warming hits you you about a third of the way through.

Had on tap one week earlier and felt it to have lost some of its appeal from the previous year.  A- Nice amber-copper tone, very clear. The pour generated a fast white head that dissipated to a soapy film on top of the glass. Sticky lacing with active bubbles.  S- Hops!! I get nice citrus aromas and fresh lemon grass. Some hint of grapefruit and orange. The malts are nice and smooth. Biscuit and honey backbone. Very Nice. If you a deep whiff you can pick up the alcohol burn.  T-Very smooth flavor. It starts off smooth and finishes with a ascending hop bite. The honey and biscuit malts blend so well. This a very nice IPA. The abv is present but not over powering.  M- The mouthfeel is perfect for the style. Carbonation is spot on and even at a 10% abv it goes down nice and easy. It has a very residual hop flavor that lingers for some time after each sip.  O- Well worth the circus. I feel there is a little hype involved but the beer is amazing. I must say the bottle did this seasonal monster justice, the draft left me concerned.

It tastes like a fresh mix of citrus juice that I could personally drink all day until I succumb to alcohol poisoning. And personally I was not a big fan of Bell's at all before I tried Hopslam. Already had it on draft and out of the bottle, and out of the bottle there is much more of a citrus taste, and I can not taste any alcohol in it at all. It has a gorgeous golden blonde color with a thin white head that disappears quickly.

Head disappears quickly leaving the thin, white, tiny-bubbled lacing that turns into a beautiful spiral in the fishbowl tulip.  S- I remembered last year's batch as flowery with honey. This time I smell fruit, especially tangerine/blood orange... acidic, approaching lemon.  T- Tangerine, citrus, flowers packed into the nose, then the bitter but balanced leave that lingers.  M- Wonderfully smooth and light. Moves around the mouth in an incredible way, giving a citrus/ alcohol sting that moves up the nose.  I feel funny drinking this beer in 7 degree weather... the fruitiness makes it feel like a cool summer-night beer. The complexity is in the nose- there is a beautiful palette of orange fruit, citrus, and flowers that is quickly overpowered by the hop bitterness and citrus/booze acidity that moves up your nostrils about one second after the sip... this is a beast, a beautiful, golden beast of a beer. The fruit and honey come back in the lingering aftertaste- only to be shot to the back with every next sip of wild IBU and citrus power.

Looks like a slightly darker version of Two Headed (performed a side-by-side comparison with a friend that, for some reason, decided to drink two-hearted instead of this.)  Smell - Lots of grapefruit and fresh hops, but a lot of booze in the nose. Citrusy.  Mouthfeel - Syrupy and smooth. Lightly carbonated. Goes down easy. Too easy.  Taste - A surprise. Big booze and malts. Not the honey and hops we got last year. This is a different beer and possibly for the worse. It tastes great, don't get me wrong, but it's absolutely not incredible.

287,17112,blackcompg,5,"Poured from their 12oz bottle...  Appearance - A rough pour gave me 3 gingers of golden fluffy eggshell head, color is a gorgeous glowing slightly hazy yellow gold, almost a lite orange. Big laces already starting to appear. *Thick broad splashes of lace all over the inside of my glass when finished - wow.  Smell - Oh BIG pine and fresh grapefruit zest, more citrus smells like orange zest and pineapple too, and there is an underlying sweetness, perhaps from the honey. One of the best smelling beers ever, literally makes the mouth water.  Taste - What a perfect balance here - starts with Big citrus notes of grapefruit with other citrus zests (orange and trace lemon) and even some under-ripe pineapple with hints of pine. moments after the sip there are green grassy floral hop flavors - and for the entire trip there is the perfect amount of sweetness in the back to just keep your taste-buds attached. You can actually pick up the faint honey flavor. Not the sugar laden honey from the bear shaped container at the grocers, this is much more of a natural honey from the comb flavor, very floral and natural tasting. Fantastic big flavors here. Alcohol is perfectly hidden, even at 10%.  Mouthfeel - This has a medium mouthfeel with almost medium carb. The carb adds just enough cleansing and crispness to to let the hops really come through and linger long into the finish. Careful, this is such a wonderfully drinkable beer, you could very easily end up like the person pictured on the front of the bottle...and get hopslammed ;)  Overall - I am enjoying this so much, a hop lovers dream. So perfectly balanced and still very complex. So many wonderful hop flavors - citrus, pine, floral, meadowy, grassy, like you dipped the tips of a fistful of hops into some fresh honey from the comb, and thrust this into your mouth all at once. My favorite style is a really good DIPA, and until i find something better, this is a poker hand of 5 aces.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",Imperial IPA,98
287,17112,dorianmarley,4.5,"Appearance is an orange amber with a decent head and some lacing.  Nose is plenty of floral hops with caramel and some lemon.  Taste is overwhelming; wow. That is about as many IBU's as I can handle. The bitterness bum-rushes like a wave. It is still surprisingly well-balanced, since there is a sweet caramel that lasts all the while. The honey flavor is electric. It tastes as dynamic and well-rounded as real honey. It finishes with some black peppercorn and toffee.  Mouthfeel is smooth with mild carbonation; very drinkable.  Overall, this is an exciting beer. It is a lot of fun to drink, and has a well-balanced flavor despite its experimentation.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",Imperial IPA,98
287,17112,BarryMFBurton,4.38,"It’s finally here – mo’ fuggin Hopslam. The last time this beer was released, I wasn’t even 21; sad, since I’ve been told how great it is multiple times. But now, I’m ready for a sip of those magical hops – HIT ME!  According to my massive boner, this beer was brewed incredibly recently. Checking the date, checking the date…”PKGD 1/06/12.” Yessir.  A: Wunderbar! Shining gold with just the right shade of darker amber hues – looks like honey. Just as appealing is the stark white marshmallow-cream of a head; three fingers of foamy glory, with lacing sticking all the way down to the body in stringy, abundant patches. The light, steady stream of rising bubbles moving through the radiant body is beckoning me to have a whiff, it seems like. Whatever you say, sexy beer…  S: THIS is the hop scent I’ve been missing! I’ve been on a hop hunt recently, and even fresh Prima Pils can’t touch this citrus sensation. Melon, berry, grapefruit, mango, orange – they’re all there, and then some. So satisfying; it’s like Torpedo had a lovechild with a ripe pineapple. Malts are tough to pick out, but give off light aromas of toasted oat and sweet honey. I’ll admit, though: after a while it starts to put of an aroma of red onions, which, while not too strong, is pretty strange. An excellent nose, nonetheless.  T: Damn, what a kick in the teeth! There’s a big alcohol blast at first, running hot like whiskey (my spirit of choice) and setting the stage for a true hopslam – a badass tongue-lashing of pure hoppy, resin and biting pepper. It’s deliciously dark – not as bright a palate as I anticipated, and that’s fine by me. Also surprising is the malt profile; that is, it’s bold enough to pull through the bitters. It has a unique, naturally succulent sweetness over a whole-grain bread character. Look, hops are great, but this is what I really love about a good IPA/DIPA – that’s why I love Pliny the Elder and SN Celebration, as well as this beautiful brew. Finishes dry (of course), but not without a taste of honey and sweet, leafy fruit – a bit flowery, even.  M: Smoothness; thick smoothness. It sticks to the sides of your mouth at every opportunity, feeling as viscous as a 10% should. I might try pouring my next one a little less aggressively just to see what it would be like with more pop, but as of now, it’s spicy, astringent, and powerful all the way down.  O: This beer was worth the wait; one of my favorite beers from my favorite style to date. Now I know why people buy this by the case, even at $16+ a sixer. This beer is nothing short of wonderful, providing me with an experience that I wish every DIPA could duplicate – way to go Bell’s. I should have expected this from the guys who brought us Two-Hearted, but this one really blew me away.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",Imperial IPA,98
287,17112,deadonhisfeet,4.5,"Bottled on 12/29/11. Consumed on 1/14/12. Poured from a bottle into a New Belgium tulip. Beautiful unfiltered hazy honey color. Nice head and nice lacing on the glass. The nose is very pungent. Notes of grapefruit and pineapple smack you like an oily fist.  Flavorwise, this is definitely something different. You get your typical tongue-bruising blast of hops accompanied by a nice bready, malty backbone, but the use of honey lends this beer a sweetness that distinguishes it. Some IIPAs may have a boozy, medicinal (unpleasant) sweetness, but this one has a creamy, caramel-like sweetness underneath all that bitterness. It's unlike any other IIPA I've had. I swear I could pick this one out of a blind tasting. The mouthfeel is oily and very firm.  This beer is everything it's cracked up to be. Is it the best IIPA on the planet? Honestly, I couldn't tell you. What I can tell you is that it is one of the best IIPAs on the planet. I'm very grateful that I live in an area that has access to this beer every January.

Orange peel and a pine smell linger in the background.  T- again, pineapple dominates. It fades away, though, leaving a bitter pine with a perfectly-balanced orange peel at the finish.  M- A perfectly correographed dance of carbonation and medium thickness.  O- I wish this was available year-round!

287,17112,SaintJonah,4.67,"This was the first year I was able to get my hands on this much-hyped brew. Needless to say my anticipation was through the roof. I bought 2 sixers.  I drank my first one from the bottle! I was terribly underwhelmed. The following day I poured one into a pint glass and took to the task of really appreciating this beer. The pour was a beautiful golden color with a perfect 2-finger, off-white head that just stuck around...and stuck to the glass! The aroma this beer gives off is something to experience. I've always found it a bit difficult to find the different smells in beer that everyone talks about, not this one. I got hit with Pineapple right away. Really nice. Maybe some mango and other tropical-type fruits, not real sure...but it smelled amazing.  The taste is quite similar to the smell in all the right ways. The hops are off-the-charts and crazy delicious. There's a lot going on in your mouth at this point and it's all good. The bitter, followed by sweet, followed by more bitter just sends your taste buds for a loop. It really is a good tasting brew. The body is just a nice, medium feel...not sticky or too resiny. It's pretty crisp for a 10% DIPA. The alcohol is there and warms a bit, but it's not offensive at all. This beer drinks ridiculously smooth. Almost too smooth.  Even now I feel like I've underrated it. Each one I drink seems to increase my appreciation. Top 10 for me, easily.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",Imperial IPA,98

M- Thicker creamier than expected, excellent!  O- Overall I love this beer, I am glad that I got a hold of a couple 6 packs when I could because it is going fast!

S- Warm, citrusy hops. there is a profile similar to the taste itself. Hop forward with some of that nice honey in the background.  T- Pretty epic here. Kinda leads you with the citrusy hops into some bigger and more bitter fresh cut wet ones before smoothing into some of that nectar honey smoothness. Some appleness and some green grape.  M- I guess I wish it were crisper. I have been drinking this case fresh since it was less than 2 weeks off the bottling line and I haven't felt the tongue burn. Nice carbonation.

287,17112,jtingue,4.55,"2011 Batch. Poured into a tulip.  Appearance. Clear golden in color, with a slightly orange tint. Pours with 2 fingers of head, which dissipates to a nice thick layer on top of the beer. Gorgeous lacing sticks to the side of the glass in clusters of tiny bubbles.  Smell. Obviously hop forward. I would describe the hop aroma as both grassy and citric and slightly herbal. There is also a pretty prominent honey sweet aroma as well as some breadyness.  Taste. Starts out with a herbal yet sweet hop presence. Some tangerine and other citrus flavors take over, before a medicinal note builds. This is accompanied by some spiciness and sweet bready notes. The finish is dry and filled with the medicinal hop presence from before as well as a hint of honey.  Mouthfeel. The body is pretty thick even for a dipa. Carbonation is moderate to high and gives the beer a creamy body which I really appreciate.  This beer really lives up to the ""hype"". It really is so different from a west coast dipa, such as pliny, and in my opinion could not even be compared to those types of beer.

Loads of citrus and grapefruit flavors assault the palate. Definitely lives up to its name. Some grassy and floral notes are present as well. Finishes with a pine resin flavor along with a little bit of booziness and sweet honey undertones.  Pretty thick due to honey I presume with medium carbonation levels. Very smooth for 10%.  I love Hopslam season. I love the uniqueness of using honey to ramp the ABV. It ends up retaining it's hop bomb status without getting too sweet as most DIPA's do in this range.

Not what I expected considering the hype and the price; just what you would expect a double ipa to taste like, nothing extra-ordinary aside from the honey, which is well-balanced by lots of bitter hoppiness.  M- My favorite thing about this beer; smooth, surprisingly drinkable, thanks to the honey which thickens it. Well carbonated.

287,17112,CTAID,4.34,"It's that time of year again. It's the time of year to abandon my resolutions into being a more responsible individual and get mad crazy drunk off of some Hopslam.  Pours amber gold, thin head. Smells like every IPA should smell. Goodness, the citrus, the beautiful citrus grapefruit marvel the smell is. I could just smell it and feel like I'm getting stoned. Not that I condone that sort of thing.  Tastes like a strong IPA. Not much else to say here - the hops are strong with this one, and it has a heat factor that becomes less present the more I drink. But it's a strong IPA done so gloriously right. Really my only issue with the beer - I feel like I'm getting drunk too quickly. Getting drunk too quickly is not an issue, but feeling like it is. I could use a little bit less alcohol taste. Or maybe I just have fond memories of this beer when I had lesser taste buds? Whatever. Carbonation is well done. Overall a fantastic beer that I will get more of before the month is through and I'll look forward to spending nearly $20 on a six pack next year too.

The retention was very nice and drawn out. It subsided slowly to a thin film and thick collar that left some sudsy and soapy lace.  S: Very nice smells are wafting out of the glass. Notes of citrus and tropical fruits with a subtle pine and dankness as well. There is a slight bready malt and a touch of sweet honey on the backend.  T: The taste really follows the nose. Great citrus fruit notes, mostly grapefruit, come through with a slight bittering hop in the middle. There is a slight floral quality to it as well. The finish is rounded out with a sweet honey. The bready malts take a back seat to the hops in this one.  M: Light bodied, but surprisingly sticky in nature. The ABV is well hidden in this, very dangerous. The carbonation is great and it has a nice sweet finish that feels very clean and refreshing.  O: Very well balanced and the honey sweetness really adds a nice touch that rounds out the beer.

Citrus and grapefruit are coming through the most, with some mango hints, and of course the hops. For an IPA, it also has a great sweet maltyness as well, which is very nice. Too many strong IPA's have no flavor and only a ton of bitter hops in your face. This is a simple, clean, somewhat sweet amazing IPA. It's nothing complicated, but SOOO good. And I'm not even a hop head. And you can't taste the alcohol, but it WILL hit you by the end of the first glass. Has a champagne type buzz, it's lovely.  M- feels pretty good, not too thin or thick  O- definitely a top flight beer and it deserves it's kudos as one of the Best beers in the land. Everyone should try this beer. It's nothing complex or mercurial, every bottle is the same... DELICIOUS! Double Trouble from Founders is somewhat similar but WAY more hoppy and in your face grapefruit.

Very sharp bite in the mouth, but not a very clean after taste.  I liked it, but it has a heavy presence of malt sweetness to it. To me, it distracted me from the hops.

287,17112,JohnQBeer,3.82,"As a huge fan of Pliny the Elder and Heady Topper, I was very excited to try my first Hopslam, fresh and on-tap at Ashley's. Alas, I was hugely disappointed. I don't disagree with the majority of the other reviewers with regards to appearance, smell, and mouthfeel; where I diverge is in the taste.  While huge hop aromas are present and the initial taste is full of hops, from the middle to the finish the honey and malts dominate, making the beer seem closer to a Barleywine than a Double IPA. The malty sweetness really takes over the hops, and the finish in particular is much more sweet than bitter. As a hophead, I find the maltiness almost cloying and disruptive of the burst of hops I'd rather be enjoying.  One thing I love about PtE and HT is that I feel like I could keep drinking them all night; I never tire of their awesome hoppiness.

287,17112,Chris585,4.82,"I have had this beer at the very least within 5 days of bottling the last four years and am now finally reviewing it.  First pour, even aggressive, is of golden nearly clear with a one finger off white head. Lovely!  Aroma is unbelievable. This is almost what I wait for 9 months of the year, since I usually finish off the case or so within three months.  Taste is just as nice. WOW. Piney, peach, mango, you name it....done so well. Then in the middle to end you can taste and feel just a bit of burn and alcohol. Most reviews I have read on this beer state you cannot even tell the alcohol is 10%, Im not so sure this to be totally correct, but I guess when you have had so many off balance beers like so many of those have had, maybe they didnt want to notice it. Its there, but the honey and malt backbone keep it as just a passer by for me....I know its there but the sweetness at the middle to end is just right. Not too filling, not too sweet, high ABV, but doesnt make me want to sip it....I can keep going back to the fridge for more, if it werent for the common realization that the morning would be just a little too much with the kids running around and the head and spider webs abundant.  Mouthfeel is right there with the taste, but because of the burn in the end and the astringency i coulndnt quite give it the 5. Creamy, piney, full and excellently balanced overall. This is so hard to do, yet Bells pulls it off like clockwork.  Overall this beer is so hard to put down just one....and just as hard not to give it 5's all the way across the board. IM not sure what else would be so deserving of a full 5 but this is DAMN close!!! I almost want to give it that because I havent had much better in 5 years.  I would have given it a five in appearance yet I have seen a couple better DIPA that had a little more texture and haze to them that I liked and met the style better....but just by a tad.

287,17112,VncentLIFE,4.67,"2 glasses on draft at Sams.  Pour is bright honey colored. Thin white head floats around. Kind of looks like it has to be forced out of the tap.  Smell is loaded with honey malts. Honestly, I find more honey and balance than I expected. The taste is really very balanced, but with a very nice piney hop presence. Its like The Oracle, except with different hops.  I very much enjoy the balance, and this is the best hiding job ever. The alcohol is nowhere to be found, which is kind of scary for the ABV. Very well done Bell's!  A different kidg produced a better flavor. This one tasted the same, except add a ton of juicy citrus fruits.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",Imperial IPA,98
287,17112,frenchblood21,4.67,"Poured from bottle into a tuliped Goose Island pint glass.  Appearance- Dark orange color. Exactly one finger of paper white head. Very consistant lacing.  Smell- Grapefruit and orange right away. That is followed by hops and strawberries. What a great smelling IPA.  Taste- AMAZING! This is on par with White Rajah and 90 Minute. Similiar to the nose, but add more hops and pine.  Mouthfeel- Thick for an IPA. There are so many great flavors for your mouth to digest, but I'm up to it.  Overall- What a quality beer. Bell's is famous for making highly drinkable beers, but this one is on a different level. I can see why stores sell out of this in a day or two.

Smell--Fresh hops, a little hint of sweetness  Taste-- Are you kidding me? Beer can be this good? It's a full hop flavor on the front end, followed by a malty, honey sweetness, with a delicate crispness in the finish. It's a real thing of beauty  Mouthfeel--Surprisingly light, considering the amount of flavor it has. At 10% ABV it probably goes down too smoothly.

Head is off white, 1 in, dissipates to line the top of the beer. Medium carbonation. Heavy lacing.  S: Big hop notes of pine resin and grapefruit. Some honey and a touch of malt is noticable.  T: Described as : ""a biting, bitter, tounge bruiser of an ale."" but I disagree. Huge hop flavors are very intense, but light honey additions are a solid counter. Bitterness is present, for sure, but not abrasive at all. My tounge is being delighted, not bruised. Flavors stick to the palate, with hops dominating and honey and a bit of malt manifesting. Aftertaste is hops, hops, hops, honey, and malt.  M: Full body. The resinous quality of the hops coats the palate and light honey and malt serve as a nice balance. The overall feel is still viscous and resinous. Dry finish on the outsides and back of the palate, wet in the middle.  O: To quote the Kool-Aid guy, ""Oh yeah!"".

I just picked up a case of the batch bottled on 12/29/11, meaning it's approximately 13 days old. All else considered, I honestly can't imagine anything else I'd rather drink at this point of the year. Very strong, but a flavor that I love and have become accustomed to after about 6 years of drinking various IPAs. Fantastic Winter brew, and it honestly puts me on point for going out for any occasion. I've had 7 of them in the past 3 hours(equal to 14 Budweisers), and can somehow think and speak clearly and concisely.  This review doesn't evaluate the properties of the beer or necessarily entice anyone into trying it, but if you're one of those people intent on trying a fantastic DIPA and money is generally not an issue, give this one a try.

Great retention and a lot of lacing.  S: Smell is very earthy and citrusy. The citrus/grapfruit notes really stand out here.  T: Wow. Just as good as I remember. The nose is not deceiving. A citrus hop bomb right up front with the honey notes mellowing out the flavor on the back end. This fruity DIPA is so smooth, maybe the smoothest I have had.  M: I love the stickiness of this beer. It coats the mouth well and lingers for quite some time. Liquid sex.  O: In all honesty, this is one of my all-time favorite beers, so I am biased. However, this is the cream of the crop of the Midwest IPA/DIPA. Dreadnaught, Double Trouble, and The Liberator are all fantastic, but nothing beats the drinkability of Hopslam. I could (and have) session with this, but it is not recommended.  The only thing better is having it on firkin.

287,17112,jegross2,4.95,"Reviewing the infamous Hop Slam, an imperial IPA from Bells Brewery, Inc. Score: 97  Bottled 12/29/11, served in a Duvel tulip glass, and enjoyed 01/12/12.  Appearance: Pours a hazy golden orange color that fades from a light honey color at the bottom to darker orange at the top when held up to light. Three full fingers of white, soapy head at pour gradually settles into a very thin layer of head. Superior lacing. 4.5/5  Smell: Fresh, zesty lemons and grapefruit, fresh piney citrus hops, honey, and a little vanilla. Some earthy pine sap and freshly cut grass too. Slight floral aromas too. As it warms, the aromas get much more intense. 5/5  Taste: First sip is a sharply bitter honey-and-resiny-pine flavor. Really bitter. The flavor of this beer is like a roller coaster. It starts off low key, but quickly crescendo's into a bitter climax, and then mellow outs crisply, leaving a lightly bitter finish. Mostly an earthy pine hoppiness, with some light citrus and sweet honey. A little tropical fruitiness comes out as the beer layers. There is little, if any, maltiness to balance out the bitter characteristics of the beer. Total hop bomb here. 5/5  Mouthfeel: Medium bodied with light carbonation. Light carbonation accentuates the earthy bitterness of the beer. Oily mouthfeel. Incredibly drinkable for a 10% ABV IIPA. Finish is bitter, acidic and savory. 4.5/5  Overall: While not the best imperial IPA that I have tasted, this is one of the best hop bombs that I have ever had. Absolutely delicious. Consume this one fresh. Hops heads unite!  Recommendation: Bitter hops haters should absolutely avoid this brew, but all others will enjoy. Not the best beer for casual beer drinkers, but beer geeks need to get their hands on this one.  Pairings: Kuma's Corner's hamburgers.  Cost: $17.99 for a six pack.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",Imperial IPA,98

S: Very fruity, citus fruits such as grapefruit are definitely present with honey. The hop smell is very minimal.  T: This has to be the smoothest DIPA I've had - including Dreadnaught. Fruity tastes up front, finishes with a little bit of a honey and hop taste, not bitter - perfect.  M: Light body, medium carbonation.  O: Outstanding. It's downright scary that this DIPA is 10% because it could easily be a session beer. I could drink these until I pass out, which by the 10% ABV wouldnt be very long.

287,17112,1Adam12,4.09,"I haven't hardly reviewed a beer since the new ""rate a beer"" thing came out, but I felt the need on this one. Bypassing the normal etiquette of things here. This basically tastes like a hoppier version of gumballhead. Huge nose on it, however, the taste is very wheaty, grassy, with lots of hops, just like gumballhead. I'd be curious to taste them side by side some day. I realize this is classified as a DIPA, however, the wheat stands out, the hop finish stands out, and it reminds me totally of gumballhead. I will say this is very good, however I will also say this is severely overpriced and overrated.  Edit: Well that was very difficult to read. Now that I actually know what I'm talking about, ignore the previous review lol. Very sweet DIPA. Crazy hoppy. Not very bitter. Just a big overflow of hops, but in a good way. Awesome mouthfeel. Very full bodied and creamy. I've noticed it tends to be a bit boozier on tap than it is in the bottle, but it is still good both ways. Totally worth the price. Can't drink a whole bunch of it at one time due to how sweet it is, but 2 or 3 is all you need at a time anyway.

287,17112,dgugliuzza,4.65,"Poured from bottle into a tulip  Vibrant golden pour with about an inch of white head. The head doesn't go anywhere as is proudly perches atop the body. Steady stream of carbonation shoots up from the bottom of the glass.  Massive hop profile in every sense. Piney and citrusy hops dominant initially before the honey sweetness comes through. Ultimately, the insane bitterness is masked and balanced by the honey. Sticky resin lies beneath the honey sweet malt bill. Gorgeous and inviting aroma.  Bitter, piney hops create a full on palate assault and I'm loving every second of it. Tropical fruit flavors follow and intertwine with sappy resin. The honey sneaks in at the end and provides some relief from the bitterness. This has a fantastic contrast if kick you in the mouth hoppiness and savory honey sweetness. Outstanding and complex.  Medium bodied with a nice amount of creaminess. I can definitely feel the hop oils on my tongue. Carbonation is assertive. Deceptive alcohol makes this dangerously easy to drink. Goes down smooth.  Hopslam is certainly not a misnomer. This is an exceptional DIPA that arrests and challenges your palate. I can't think of another beer that benefits this much from the addition of honey. Though the hops are explosive, the honey adds subtly and enough sweetness to bring out the best in all six hop varieties.

The first tastes are of grapefruit with a bite and hop. I sense a bit of honey on the backend, but I may be talking myself into tasting it. It's very slight. It leaves you with a nice bitter bite. The 10% abv is not overly apparent. The alcohol taste is present but not overwhelming or very prevalent. A very clean stronger IPA.

The smell represents a nice bouquet of hops, with a tinge of sweetness. The taste follows suit here: definitely hoppy, with a nice, sweet finish. There is a lingering bittness after a minute or so. Hops...nice; malt backbone...check. To me, the crowning jewel to HS is the smoothness and the lack of heat: dangerous! For a 10% brew, the alcohol is incredibly well hidden.

T: The taste is also very tropical. The grapefruit and orange are immediately upfront. A bit of pine follows that. Finish is raw floral hops, ripe fruit, and orange rind. Alcohol gives a little kiss at the end, but definitely doesn't taste like 10%. Malt base is fairly strong and sufficiently balances out the hops and alcohol.  This beer really shows the diversity of hops. Every hop taste from fruit to flowers to bitterness makes an appearance. Definitely a complex DIPA.  M: Really nice for an IPA. Smooth, oily, slick, creamy, but still a bit prickly.  Mouthfeel is perfect for coating the mouth in those great, raw hop flavors.  O: Definitely a top-tier DIPA. I'd say it lives up to the hype.

Not nearly as hoppy as expected. This isn't a hop bomb beer, but just a really great tasting hoppy beer. So maybe the name is a little misleading? Or maybe it just means it has hops in it and you will want to slam them down one after another? Regardless, good carbonation trending to the high side. Hops are more of a subtle bitterness that linger. Taste is floral hops, citrus fruits/lemon and some honey. Not nearly as much honey as I feared though. I normally don't like 'honey beers' but this is a huge exception thanks to the subtle usage. At 10% abv I can honestly say this is the most dangerous beer I know of. I could literally drink these one after another they are so smooth. Not a noticeable alcohol taste at all. But after a few, you can feel it and you know the bottle label was telling the truth.

287,17112,spinrsx,4.5,"BA review #800!  12oz Bottle - big thanks to iguenard for this one  Appearance – Clear copper colour with an average size fizzy and frothy white coloured head. There is an average amount of carbonation visible and there is a good amount of lacing. The head lasted for around 5 minutes before it was gone.  Smell - Malts, hops, caramel, grapefruit/oranges, peaches, pineapples  Taste & Mouth - The beer has an average amount of carbonation and it feels slightly thick on the tongue. I can taste malts, caramel, and lots of hops. It also has lots of fruit flavours going on, pineapple, tangerines, grapefruit and some peaches. I can also pick up on the booze a little bit, and it provides a nice warming feeling as it goes down. It finishes with a sweet tropical fruit aftertaste with a long lingering hop bitterness.  Overall – I know my bottle isn't the freshest, but I still thought this was an incredible beer. Either it really held up well, or the fresh stuff is going to blow my mind. Definitely one of the best beers I've had the pleasure of drinking.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",Imperial IPA,98
287,17112,harrymattcody,4.92,From the bottle to a tulip.  The pour is a radiant orange color with a nice head that has some longevity to it and lays down a gold bit of lace. The nose alone is enough for me to know that I'm going to love this beer. It's a tropical and citrus fruit bomb that never gives a hint of malt. The taste follows suit with an abundance of citrus/tropical goodness. The beer is full in the mouth but not overly so.  One of my all time favorite beers and my favorite DIPA.,Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",Imperial IPA,98
287,17112,aficionado,4.28,"Orange amber body with no head but lots of sticky icky lacing.  Smells kind of like Sauvignon Blanc, but very weak. A little cat pee and grapefruit with some orange rind.  Piney, sharp, citrusy, bold, impressive. Very unique flavor. Points for uniqueness, but not PtE beats it flavorwise. Nice and dry, but has a juicy sweetness to it at the same time.  High carbonation. Probably the silkiest body in a DIPA I've ever encountered.  Very smooth for what it is. Tastes like they found a way to utilize all of the flavor from the hops without the harsh bitterness. This is one to be appreciated. You can sense after one sip that one of these will give you a nice buzz.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",Imperial IPA,98
287,17112,biboergosum,4,"12oz bottle at the Oak Cafe in Wyandotte, Michigan.  This beer pours a clear medium golden hue, with two fat fingers of tight foamy eggshell white head, which leaves a wall of honeycomb lace around the glass. It smells of caramel/toffee malt, and citrus, pine, and pineapple hops. The taste is caramel malt, earthy honey, bitter citrus, pine, and a bit of booze. The carbonation is fairly low, the body medium weight and as smooth as possible. It finishes with not unexpected uptick in overbearing hoppiness, blotting out the now underperforming malt.  Maybe this is a sort of aged bottle, but it's still quite good, but not that wow, holy shit, head shaking way I was stupidly awaiting. Oh well. All that aside, a good DIPA, especially given the big, basically undetectable ABV.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",Imperial IPA,98
287,17112,ThePorterSorter,4,"Appearance: Dark amber with a light, tan and fluffy head. Decent lacing on the sides and the head falls flat quickly.  Smell: Very sweet sugar with some light, spicy hops. There is also a little bite from the alcohol, this smell reminds me of their 9000/10000 (which are american strong ales). I would have liked to smell more aromatic hops.  Taste: Lots of sweetness with a strong bitterness. The second most noticeable thing is the strong alcohol. Thankfully all the flavors are fairly strong and therefore the alcohol is balanced, otherwise it would be too much.  Mouthfeel: Quite potent sweetness and alcohol with almost no lingering bitterness from the hops. The carbonation is creamy and helps break apart its otherwise syrup-like consistency.  Overall: This is a good beer that reminds me of the quality associated with the other Bell's beers that I've had. Its got some strong bitterness and alcohol, but is lacking of almost all aromatic hoppiness. The strength of the alcohol also makes this one hard to drink more than a few of. Worth trying, but not if you have to acquire long distance.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",Imperial IPA,98

287,17112,detroiter,4.89,"What an amazing beer. This like PtE must be enjoyed fresh. If its over 2 months old its just not the same.  It has a nice color, very clear for a DIPA.  The smell is as you would expect, a hop bouquet of epic proportions  heavy on the grapefruit and citrus hops, with plenty of dry hopping.  Surprisingly light for being 10+% ABV.  I have had this on tap and bottles and firkin and I think my favorite is on tap but that firkin is something else too. It has much more nose and and little more malt than bottle and regular draft.  worth the hype!  Cheers",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",Imperial IPA,98

287,17112,bismarksays,4.49,"A-A beautiful orangish golden color with a nice two finger head. Head retention is evident as well. Simply goregous  S- Mmmm, hops, hops, more hops, and honey. Sweet, bitter, alive. Grapefruit/citrus, honey, and floral notes burst from it.  T/M Just as it smells, it explodes with pure hop heaven and honey on the tongue. A bit sweet, perhaps, but balanced beyond perfection. The mouthfeel is very nice, clean and inviting. Maybe..if I am being really picky here, a bit sticky, but my tongue was not complaining.  Overall: This beer lives up to the hype, looks the hype in the eye, and knocks the hype out of the park. A must have.  Update: Since my last review, which was two years ago, my opinion on this beer has changed. First, I feel like it has gotten sweeter and less carbonated. This leads to more of an unbalanced flavor. Secondly, it feels like they are dry hopping more and using less in the boil. The fresh stuff now drinks a bit like the old stuff. I down graded the taste, mouthfeel, and overall.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",Imperial IPA,98
287,17112,hippityhophead24,5,"Appearance: Beautiful orange color. Very clear and inviting. Nice two finger head, with not too much retention. Looks fairly light in comparison to higher ABV beers like this one.  Smell: Strong citrus flavor. Very full of notes from the orange/tangerine family. Slight sweet honey notes as well.  Taste: Lots of intense flavors going on. It all hits my tongue fairly fast so it is somewhat hard to take in. Has some strong sweet orange citrus notes. Then a tiny booze taste. Then it goes quickly back to the sweet citrus notes. It’s almost too complex for my palette to pick apart. Maybe after I am able to try another bottle or two at a later time.  Mouth feel: Great, light, frothy feel on the tongue. Not overly carbonated but not flat.  Overall: I think this is a great beer. It definitely is one of my favorite DIPA.  Glasswear: Snifter",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",Imperial IPA,98
287,17112,BrauKilR,4.62,"Technically this is a braggot rather than a DIPA. Aroma: Orange citrus with subtler resinous hints that suggest to me Simcoe hops. Alcohol, caramel and a sweet, honey-ish sack mead quality in moderate intensity. No diacetyl, and any vegetal aromas I attribute to hops. Appearance: Hazy orange with a creamy, moussy head that thins after several minutes to a creamy film to rim the glass and cover the liquid. Flavor: Orange and grapefruit citrus up front with the balance all hops. Moderate malt sweetness which lends support. Caramel and a honey-wine quality in a dryish, hop-astringent finish. Mouthfeel: Medium bodied. Medium carbonation. A creamy texture which coats the tongue lightly and rests for the most part between the tongue and roof of the mouth. The finish is grapefruit astringency and hop flavor, mingled with a mild sweetnesss that persists for a few minutes and then fades quietly. Prominent warming that continues as a pricklyness on the lips. This beer slams you, and not you it.

Alcohol but this beer hides it incredibly well. The hops hit you like a mack truck! My goodness, what a beer.  Easily in my hall of fame. Incredibly drinkable beer for how big it is.

287,17112,hoptualBrew,3.96,"12oz bottle with no bottled on or freshness date on it. Love the label though!  Before getting started, I would like to say I found this a lucky find in an improbable spot. The 6pack has most likely been sitting on the shelf for 5 months, so I do not expect this ""hop heaven"" of a beer to be anything like it's fresh version. Come January, I will be re-reviewing this brew as the fresh version.  Pours a deep orange amber murky semi transluscent. Nice frothy off white head leaving amazing lacing down the glass. Did not expect that from a 10% brew.  Not quite the hop bomb in the nose that I was expecting, most likely due to its age. Nose is mostly a combination of pale & caramel malts with a side of tropical hops and can definitely smell the booze wafting in the background.  Bittering bite up front, midway through, and in the after taste. Who are we kidding here? This is a crazy hop bomb. For the most part this brew is a mix of sweet malts & overpowering bittering fruity & floral hops. Getting a little citric grapefruit & floral grassy hops. Once again, I would like to state this brew is 6 months old - so take my review as the ""aged version"".  A very thick body (8/10) makes this DIPA that much better. Carbonation works beautifully with the hop bitterness & body.  Picked this up from World Market at Coconut Point Mall for $14.99/ 6 pack. Great price! Just looking forward to having it fresh. If it is this good 5-6 months past its prime, I cannot even begin to fathom the fresh version!

287,17112,SubpoenaDeuces,4.6,"Bells’ Hopslam DIPA, 10% abv  A: Mildly opaque golden hues, brighter and more apricot than most DIPAs and it doesn’t look exceptionally malty. Nice thick white cumulus head with huge thick lacing  S: Huge sweet hoppy character that comes off extremely saccharine and herbal. The hop cloud is like an olfactory bomb you can smell 18” away.  T: There is an initial huge sweetness that isn’t exactly citrus, it tastes more funnel cake/cinnabon, then the herbal and lime flavors initiate into a great bouquet.  M: For a beer this big it is incredibly drinkable. The mouthfeel isn’t overly coating or exceptionally filling, but the flavors are relentless. I want to drain my glass with increasing celerity ::pushes glasses up nose::  D: This is incredibly drinkable and I would say that the ABV places it in leagues with several different classes of beers. This will warm you in the winter or cool you off with awesome refreshing sweet notes in the summer. Just fantastic all around; even with a bit of age it is still an impressor.  Narrative: Sure, it wasn’t the WWE, but the triple title, welter weight tristate professional wrestling competition was nothing to sneeze at. The competitions behind the Tastee Freeze lacked the ambiance of a pure demonstrative environment for the masses, but the hum of the generator provided a mild lull for the public lacking dental insurance. A dim spotlight, spotlight loosely being referred to as a Belkin floodlight, shined furiously on the center of the canvas ring. A 9 year old girl swayed gently on the ropes awaiting the entrances. The smell of cut grass and grapefruit began to fill the baleful air, the mist of sticky herbal sweetness lingering within each patrons’ nose: Hopundertakehopper had arrived.

The smell is, well, holy hell,an explosion. This what one would classify as ""Hop Porn"".  The fabulous hop orgy continues with the first sip. The hops are masked in a fruity broth. The hop-spice and bitterness are just brilliant here, pushed as far as you can go before it becomes off-putting.  As far as drinkability goes, Hopslam sits in that sweet-spot between sipping and guzzling. Goes down remarkably easy for a hop dynamo, but watch yourself, or this shit will tear your esophagus out.  I have had a lot of Bell's and while I like quite a few them, there are many much-loved Bell's beers I've found to be a little overrated. Not Hopslam.

As I drank there was considerable lacing clinging to the glass. Huge citrus/grapefruit on palate with sweet maltiness on the nose. Hops really stayed on my palate long after gulp was gone.  Okay there is a reason i drank the four i had rather quickly after release. This one while still amazing lost a bit of the hop freshness. Still amazingly clear(not cloudy) and not too syrupy for its style - I would recommend not saving this one and drinking sooner than later.

Very enticing  T- Nice grapefruit bitterness taste upfront is then greeted by some malt balancing it out. There is also some orange flesh, slight pine, and mellow sweetness that may be from the honey although I don't really taste honey necessarily. Slight alcohol taste.

287,17112,angrybabboon,4.62,"Review adapted from notes taken 1/31/11  Appearance: Orange with a hint of amber, shockingly clear, amazing lacing  Smell: Pure, glorious absurdity - hops everywhere - dank, musty, resinous, spicy, juicy - citrus and pine - smells like a fresh bag of hop pellets, in the best way possible - some sweetness (the honey) and pale malts  Taste: The only reason I'm not giving this a 5 is because it is so over the top - this beer is an all-out assault on the tongue, daring you to even think about having something else after - the flavor is like hop juice, hop elixir - again, mostly citrus and pine - some sweet, pale malts in there that just manage to provide a base for the attack of the hops - utterly ridiculous, one of the most purely hoppy beers I've ever had - absolutely no trace of alcohol whatsoever  Mouthfeel: Medium bodied, adequately carbonated, extremely sticky  Overall: A unique experience  This is a beer that I can't compare to anything. It makes beers like Sculpin seem like they are reaching for balance. Hopslam is so absurd that I couldn't see myself drinking it more than a couple times a week - which I totally would, if I were in the distribution area. This is a must-try, to say the least.  Update: The 2012 batch seems to have more booze, more honey, and more grassiness. I would like to hope that this is not simply a matter of my changing taste buds.

Hops hit right away along with the carb sting and then the grapefruit. The grapefruit almost taste as if it has ripened a bit more, very bizarre but nice. I really don't taste the alcohol in here...  M: Carbonated and sticky  O: This is very nice a hundred and three times better fresh but not bad with a few months on it. Looking forward to next years release already.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",Imperial IPA,98
287,17112,ajcobb24,4.64,"Appearance - This beer was a medium tan and fairly opaque. Not much head on the pour. At most you would get a finger of head with an aggressive pour. Not very viscous and no stickage to the sides of the glass as you swirled it.  Smell - Heavy citrus notes. Grapefruit was most prevalent with orange and floral notes coming in a distant second. Quite a sweet smelling beer as well.  Taste - Wow. I thought Quadrupels were my favorite beer. The bottle describes the taste as ""bitter and biting""; thank God that wasn't true. This could not have been more smooth and pleasant. Heavy grapefruit and orange notes with some retro-nasal breathing. Overall one of the best tastes I have had. Went down dry and leaving you ready for the next sip.  Mouthfeel - Not heavy at all. Medium-bodied with some substance. Not much carbonation to speak of. This is so smooth you could chug it (but I wouldn't because it needs to be savored).  Overall - Very, very good beer. Love the citrus notes in the beer. A lot of care went into brewing this. Probably the top 2 of all of the beers I have had.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",Imperial IPA,98

I've had this a couple of times at different places, and while I think it is an excellent brew, it isn't the holy Grail of hops that some claim it to be  The nose is quite intoxicating when first poured, but I think taste lingers a bit too much, almost like ruination does. Wonderful color and mouthfeel to this beer, just seems to be missing something to me.

S - Deceivingly smooth citrusy hop aroma  T - The hop bite is much more apparent in the taste than the smell. It has quite a bite a first, but that mellows out into the grapefruit taste many have mentioned quite quickly. Although the alcohol wasn't present in the smell, it made it's presence known after taking a deep swig.  M - It is much thicker and heavier on the palate than it appears to be.

I'll try to re-review if I can get a fresh bottle next year.  Poured into my dfh snifter, pours a murky orange color, very cloudy in appearance. Nice 3 fingers of head, good retention, some lacing. Smell- uh oh...I smell sweet malty honey. No hops detected on the nose. Taste- malty malty malty malty. Bready, no hops whatsoever. Hop-what? Nope...none here.  This bottle is way past its prime and I'm surprised anybody who is drinking it in May is giving it good reviews. This is a great example why beers like this should be drank fresh.  Reviewed again, fresh this time. Bottle dated 1-26-12. Many thanks to Kzoobrew for the chance to taste this fresh this time! Poured from bottle into Brooklyn Tulip glass. Pours a cloudy orange-golden color. Decent head, leaves about a finger of cloudy white head. A terrific looking beer. Smell- Tropical sweet hops, raw honey, citrus (orange, lemon zest), bready, with the big huge malt backbone sweetness. Yum. Taste- wow! huge hop explosion on my tongue, bitterness assault to my tongue and sides of my mouth, equally balanced by a super deep sweet honey based malt backbone. I get it. I really get why this is so talked about. I get why this gets put up there with the elite IIPAs of the world. Just so balanced, yet complex, and unique with the honey play.

White frothy head settles relatively quick, and laces. Honey colored, and more clear than I expected. The nose is sweetening up, and turning malty. Great bitterness up front, grapefruit hops and caramel malt in the dry finish. Resinous slick hop oils coat the mouth. A crisp bubbly bite marks the mouthfeel. Bitterness lingers, and leaves a grain & honeycomb note behind. Yeasts and malt come out as it warms. There's no denying this is 10%!  This is a greap DIPA, and one I would drink regularly, were it available in these parts. Admittedly, this beer was very hyped up for me, and didn't live up to my unrealistic expectation entirely, however, I feel satisfied to know that I can find DIPA's of this caliber from New England.  Hopslam is, however, worthy of the hype.  A good lesson learned with this one.

287,17112,WastingFreetime,4.13,"Served to me on tap. Incidentally, I find that it perfectly complements my rather spicy Sichuan take out. (I'm lucky enough to have a local bar that allows outside food to be brought in)  A. Slightly toasted straw color. Very impressive head that leaves behind one of the most intricate and beautiful lacing patterns I have ever seen in a tap beer.  S. Orange peel, grapefruit peel, some mango and pine aromas, but not quite as much mango and pine as Dreadnaught on tap. I don't smell any honey, but I do definitely smell the booziness of the 10% ABV. That part, I could do without. Everything else, however, is spot on for my tastes.  T. One of the great things I love about IPAs is taking a mouthful of super spicy food, feeling the burn, and taking a swallow of those hops to wash it down. The fun thing about this trick I have found is that it AMPLIFIES both the sensation of the chile burn and the resinous nature of the hops. But the beer, the beer does indeed have honey character in the taste which I was missing in the nose. Its just that, for me, it doesn't show up until the finish. In the start it is a bitter resinous punch which dissolves into that honeyed sweetness so rapidly that the contrast is quite enjoyable. Lovely  M. Now I have a slight problem, this is too heavy and thick on the tongue. Oh well, you can't have everything.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",Imperial IPA,98

Smells like citrus fruit and sweet floral hops. Strong grapefruit aroma, a little pine, and just a touch of alcohol.  Tastes sweet with a smooth maltiness. I think I do pick up a little honey in there that blends well with the malt. Still amazingly hoppy even being quite a few months old. Only a slight bitter aftertaste.  Mouthfeel is medium and and maybe just a little thick with great carbonation.

The pour was really nice, a solid orange color with a fair amount of head and a wonderfully hoppy smell, just like the name promises.  The taste of the beer isn't as much of a kick in the face as I expected, and that was good for me.

The smell -- oh, the smell -- is springtime in paradise, all tropical fruits, mango and papaya, with just a hint of very mellow hoppiness.

287,17112,jefferz5000,4.5,"Mega thanks to Scoot1969 for tossing this into an amazing box of goodies for me.  This pours beautifully into my Spiegelau tulip. A soft, slightly hazy, amber gold hue with a pretty white head that hangs out as I sip away.  Aroma is of fresh citrus fruits and tropical pineapple scents. I think some honey may be coming through along with the hoppiness. This is a surprisingly good aroma.  Taste follows the nose and brings some pretty extreme hop bitterness, but not overwhelming (well sorta to my dad). The fruitiness is such a pleasant surprise. This is the kind of DIPA that I hope for. Alcohol presence makes itself somewhat known, but not in a bad way.  Mouthfeel is really nice. It's got a creaminess to it that I find quite pleasant. Just the right amount of carbonation.  I know people love to discuss freshness and how beers like this are worthless after a day, but this is quite delicious and I'm so glad I've had the opportunity to try it. If this is seriously better when seconds old, I'll certainly have to seek some out next year.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",Imperial IPA,98
287,17112,Dope,4.8,"5/18/11 review, approximately 5 month old bottle.  A: A nice light amber color, pretty typical of a double IPA.  S: Very citrusy and sweet smelling. Not as flowery or strong as some other DIPAs but still very respectable.  T: Very nice hop bitterness up front that rounds out with some delicious honey flavor. Extremely well balanced and extremely smooth all the way through. Tastes good chilled from the fridge or at room temperature. No indication of alcohol at all, honestly I was shocked when I read it was 10% - I figured maybe 7% at most.  M: Full bodied - this is where you can tell it's a bit bigger than I initially expected. Fairly heavy and almost feels like your mouth is coated with sticky honey.  D: Top notch for the style. Obviously it's a pretty big beer with a lot of alcohol and sweetness but nothing is overpowering. I could drink a bunch of these no problem.  Overall I think this is the best DIPA I've ever had (no, I haven't had any of the Plinys). Stellar beer, just too bad Bell's doesn't distribute out here :(  1/24/12 review, bottle dated 12/30/11.  A: A cloudy golden orange pour. Big frothy white head atop it. Head retention is excellent. Lacing is as well.  S: Lots of citrus, grapefruit and honey. Nice grainy caramel malt to back it up. Resinous pine shows up once it warms. Maybe a touch of pineapple?  T: Big pine and grapefruit bitterness punch up front. Sweet caramel malt kicks in with the honey to round it out PERFECTLY. Honey lingers nicely in the aftertaste with the pine.  M: Pretty heavy but not as bad as you would expect. Almost a little sticky. Carbonation is dead on.  O: This is the pinnacle of IPAs in my opinion. Since my first review I've had some PtE and other notables but they don't surpass hopslam. Great beer, wish it were year-round (and available in MA!).

Hopslam poured with a finger of creamy white head that very quickly dissipated and left thick thick lacing on the sides of the glass. It was a golden orange color and fairly clear. FANTASTIC smell; orangy citrus sweetness beautifully blended with hops. The taste was equally enjoyable; I definitely tasted honey and citrus sweetness, and the bitterness of hops delightfully punched through without either end of the spectrum overpowering the other. Extremely well-balanced. Some hints of booziness were just barely present, but overall the taste masked the high ABV deceivingly well. Medium weight in the mouth, with some stickiness, but like every other aspect of this beer, juuust right. Very drinkable- you could easily knock back a few of these without batting an eye (if it weren't for the pricetag!).  Overall, I can easily see why this beer is so highly regarded.

Upon drinking, the head reduces to irregular surface coat and leaves splotchy, sticky lacing. Excellent calrity  Highly aromatic, with seemingly fresh and rather strong hoppy aroma. Fruity (citrus) and floral, with hints of high ABV.  Very strong flavor with ample bitter and noticeable sweet components. Slightly dry finish with less bitterness than expected; IBU, reported as 106, seems lower. The high ABV seemed partly hidden but became more evident with warming. Hints of orange peel, honey brandy, pine and grapefruit lie within the complex mix of hop flavors.  M - good carbonation; fairly smooth; a little 'bite' from high ABV and hops. Warming.  O - simply a great sipper for hopheads, and I do recommend sipping for both reasons of flavor and ABV. Not quite over the top, the huge hop load is pungent but seems less challenging than it might be, perhaps due to the honey; perhaps due to the ""generous malt bill"".

O: This is a top 3 DIPA for me and I have had a bunch of them. I always look forward to the release of this one. I have had this on draft, cask and bottled and I would say bottled is the best.

The color shows a lack of caramel color, therefore, a lack of caramel flavor (which I like in DIAP). Small white head leaves minimal lacing.  Aroma is very grapefruity, grassy, and quite piney as well. Loads of overall citrus with minimal malt aromas.  Awesome flavor and exactly what a DIPA should be like. Slight sweetness immediately, then leaves immediately, with some more bitterness up front and more in the back. Loads of grapefruit with the grass being a little more subdued in flavor as compared to aroma. Bitter but in no way out of balance. Absolutely perfect.  Perhaps a touch thin for most but I really like the thinness. Without the chewy maltiness, this is one perfect DIPA. Perhaps this and Pliny the Elder are tops in my book.

T: Grassy, piney hops in the initial are balanced by sweet malts, followed by a lingering hop aftertaste. Tempered by some citrus and honey notes, though mostly a ""hopslam"".

287,17112,LairdChisholm,4.79,"I've had this one for a while, but I just cracked it open.  A - Pours a nice clear golden color with a one finger off white head. The head does not leave that much lacing but it does have good retention. A good amount of carbonation is also coming to the top.  S - You can smell this one right when you pour it out of the bottle. It mostly smells of pine hops, but when given a bit of time to settle, the citrus hops add a perfect balance.  T - There is a reason why they call this Hopslam. There are some great pine and citrus hops that make a perfect balance. There are some great fruit notes such as pear, lemon and orange but the one that sticks out is pineapple. Incredible.  M - Great balance for a DIPA. While the ABV is high, the mouthfeel lets the flavors dominate and you don't even notice the alcohol.

The flavor starts light and sweet, but not for long! Shortly thereafter the hops move in, and not subtely either. This is a big beer with big flavor. I like to pair Hopslam with grilled venison chops topped with crumbled bleu cheese or BBQ ribs, as the big flavors compliment each other.

The pour resulted in a two finger head of medium thick slightly off white foam with moderate clinging lace. The color was a 6 on the SRM beer color chart and a bit hazy. The smell blew me away, not what I was expecting. Aromas of honey, flowers, citrus, a hint of toffee, and caramel. Taste is a wonderful shock. Sort of sweet to start with, flavors of honey, and caramel, then the hops come to bear with the grapefruit, lime, and pine. While I was focused on the flavor, the alcohol ambushed me like a mugger. Wow, I don't think I would drink a six of these, even though the taste would let me.

287,17112,Nugganooch,3.83,4/20 - Hopslam review and why the hells not. Perfect way to complement the day. Thanks for the trade Shuggy!  A: Pours a very clear bright straw pale color with some tiny tiny bubbles that tried their best to mature into foam. But that faded quickly swirling back into the glass. Lace struggling to hang on.  S: Some nice fresh apricot and peach notes are trounced pretty quickly by sweet malt aromas. Alcohol a bit evident here.  T: Some very considerable IBU's present. Peppers the tongue nicely. Hints of some fresh citrus and fruit flavors but mostly spice and piney resin hops. But the big sweet and chewy malts really come through and it finishes on the warmer side. ABV definite on the exhalation. Dont really taste the honey but considerably on the sweeter side of DIPA's.  M: Nice overall creaminess that finishes on the warmer side.  D: On the lower side of the spectrum but this one does definitely grow on you considering it is up at 10% ABV. Definitely a bigger brew with big hops and chewy malts. Very filling. Not too shabby.  Considering this bad boy comes available in a little 12oz bottle is pretty cool. A bit on the sweeter side for me to consider Outstanding. I suppose the hype is over its limited availability. A good brew none the less that I wouldnt mind recieveing again.  Now...where's my Pliny and a lighter?,Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",Imperial IPA,98
287,17112,richkrull,3.22,"Poured a dark orangish color with a good amount of white head on it. Smell is very heavy citrus with some honey and floral notes coming through - this is a very good smelling beer. The taste however left a bit to be desired for me. Nice bitterness from the hops but the honey and grapefruit flavor really turned me off. I don't know if it was too much sweetness for me or what. Mouthfeel was alright, light-medium. Overall I was pretty disappointed in this beer. After reading all the hype about it on this site, I was really excited to try it. I've had a few other IIPAs that I think are a lot better than this. I'd give it another shot down the road but until my taste changes, I won't be buying another 6-pack, that's for sure.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",Imperial IPA,98
287,17112,dmsohyea,3.08,"Bottle courtesy from Kadonny, thanks! Poured from 12 oz bottle into pint glass.  Appearance is dark yellow with half finger off-white head. Significantly lighter than an average DIPA.  Smell is of strong honey and brown sugar. Some bready malt is noticeable with some east coast hops in the background.  Taste is pure honey, I'm not sure this isn't a hoppy mead beer. Some piny bitterness mid palate, with an alcoholic finish.  Mouthfeel is soupy and somewhat astringent. Feels like an iced tea that had too much honey added. I would have preferred a more dry mouthfeel.  Overall I feel like I either got a bad bottle, or maybe this beer is a bit over rated. I can think of many IIPA's I would rather have over this one. Too sweet for me, maybe I'll be able to try this fresh off the tap some day.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",Imperial IPA,98
287,17112,Phelps,4.32,"Received from hophead101 in the Blind Beers BIF, and reviewed as such. This one was poured into a tulip.  Nice dark tangerine color, slightly hazy and topped with a one-finger head of frothy cream-colored foam. The bubbles recede quickly, leaving a medium ring and some nice horizontal trails of lace.  The nose is both hoppy and rather malty-sweet. I get mild orange peel, juicyfruit and mango along with honey and a mild breadiness.  The flavor follows the nose, with fruity hops leading the charge. Juicyfruit, mango, pineapple, light mint, honey. Notes of grapefruit sit on the tongue between sips. Nice, complex blend of hops. There's a heavy, sugary quality here mingling with the hot flavor of alcohol.  The body is a hefty medium, almost liqueur-like, with moderate, peppery carbonation prickling the tongue before the beer fizzes up softly as it moves around. The bitterness grips the sides of the tongue snugly but not with too much force, and the alcohol is noticeable as a beefy warming in the throat.  Hopslam is one of the sweeter hop bombs out there and I really like that about it. It's heavy, but heavy with flavor!",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",Imperial IPA,98

Great lacing on the snifter walls.  S: Beautiful, fruity hop aroma on the nose here! Some late malt sits below, but a amazingly fruity nose.  T: This is a hop head's dream beer! A nice mouth pucker'er. I actually drank one a little while after this one that mellowed a little bit, but this fresh one was awesome. Floral hops up from with that malt backbone that I smelled from the sniff. Strong pucker finish that lingers.  M: Total mouth coater! Really chewy!  D: This is a powerful beer. It's great that it is a seasonal surprise to have. This isn't a sessionable brew. I think this is a start your evening beer before you move on to lesser ABV brews.

Golden orange color with about 1 1/2 fingers worth of head. Not too clear, some hop haze in there.  S: Wow. I've never smelled a beer like this. Pure pineapple up front. It seriously smelled like I was in a Dole factory. Fresh pineapple juice, followed by a bevy of citrus fruits, with a nice malty backbone to hold it all together. World class.  T: The taste follows the smell. Huge pineapple/citrus notes with a hearty maltiness that kicks it towards the middle of the tongue. On the finish I got kind of a sweet hoppyness (which I suppose is from the honey) followed by a crushing bitterness. This thing made my tongue tingle. Outstanding  M: Full bodied. Very heavy and syrupy. Mouthfeel reminded me of Avery's Maharaja. Very thick and delicious. Coats the tongue with it's syrupy sweetness.

287,17112,CrookedStill,3.39,"Batch 10196, bottled Feb. 8, '11.  Pours a light amber with a finger thick white head.  Lots of citrus upfront. Grapefruit. There's a sweetness to it behind the citrus that's heavy of honey. Really enjoyable aroma.  Sweetness really takes hold first. Can really taste honey (tons honey malt I'm guessing). Hops come towards the end but the sweetness doesn't leave much room for them to shine and ends slightly bitter but it's the sweetness that lingers. There's a small amount of burn from the alcohol but overall the 10% is masked fairly well.  Pretty average for the the style. A medium body that's mildly carbonated.  I had my hopes up with this one. I've enjoyed many of Bell's offerings (Two Hearted and Expedition are at the top of my list) but this one just falls flat. The sweetness, near cloying, leaves this brew far off balanced and while I enjoyed parts of it, the sweetness was hard to get passed. The aroma is really were this beer shined and I wish it had carried into the taste. I'm glad I got to try it but if I had to choose between Hopslam or Two Hearted, it's Two Heated I'm buying.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",Imperial IPA,98

The hops aren't as in your face as some DIPAs, but the balance in this one is what really makes it stand out. Plenty of malt sweetness along with a lot of honey towards the middle.

Pours clear and golden, 1"" off white head dissipates rather quickly into a thin film, slight lacing left behind. Nose is too sweet for my preference in DIPA's, but considering the abv %, I was expecting something in these lines. Floral, citrus like hops shine through a bit, fighting the sweet residual malt character for the lead. Taste is of a hyped up Two Hearted, nothing more, nothing less. This beer is Two Hearted on steroids, boost the centennial's, boost the pale and crystal, and you've got HopSlam. Overall I'm not too impressed by this beer at all. Bell's has a cult following, and I honestly think they could wizz in a batch, label it PissSlam, then stick a $14.99 price tag on a 6'er, and everyone would harp about how good it is. It just doesn't live up to everyone's hype, but seeing as Ive got 17 bottles left after it hit GA three months ago, I'll be cellaring plenty! Overall, grab one or two if you see it @ a reasonable price, but I wouldn't go too far to find it. I'd rather rock a Lagunitas Hop-Stoopid for $3.49 a bomber.

The smell for me was too malty and not enough hops. Taste followed the aroma...way too sweet and malty for a good DIPA. The hops were not forward enough for me to enjoy this.

The flavor is piney, and very bitter. I'm surprised as this has the least IBUs of any DIPA I've had, paired to some of the most alcohol. And yet, to me, it tasted overwhelmingly bitter. Maybe it was served too cold, and didn't warm up enough, but I didn't get any honey sweetness from it.  The mouthfeel is very thick, and chewy.

Notes: Another great beer from this Kalamazoo area brewery.

The citrus is the most notable scent. It almost smells like oranges or peaches.  T: The taste is amazing. The first thing you notice is the intense hops and high alcohol content. The taste of hops is prominent and bitter but not overpowering. This is less balanced rather than highlighted by some sweet malts. The citrus flavors here as much more subdued than they are in the smell. The light fruity sweetness and mild malt flavors meld perfectly with the excessive amount of hops.

D- Overall, an outstanding brew. 10% alcohol, I finished 12oz in about five minutes, and I'm craving another. I only have one more, so I want to save it for another night. Definitely going to trade for this one again. I think this beer is a few months old, and it is tasting fantastic. I can't even imagine what it would be like fresh.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",Imperial IPA,98
287,17112,Ethan27,4.85,"Pours a slightly hazy, orange color. Minimal head but noticeable lacing as you drink. Delightfully sweet, citrusy hop smell. Taste is very hoppy and sweet with honey and citrus flavors. Also a tinge of alcohol sting. Slightly slow and sticky feel, stays on the tongue.  Hopslam, along with Dreadnaught and Pliny, is one of the three best DIPAs I have tasted. An outstanding, albeit pricey, delicious beer.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",Imperial IPA,98
287,17112,Lauthaha,4.8,"Poured from a 12-ounce bottle into a half-liter beer glass.  Appearance: Beer is a beautiful golden color with a slight amber tint to it. Head is initially about a finger and a half of creamy white goodness, and recedes to a light coating on the surface of the brew, leaving a pretty thick coating on the sides of the glass as it does so.  Smell: Mead-like. The floral hops are very well-balanced against a rich, malty backdrop replete with honey goodness. With a full face in the glass, a stinging but beautiful alcohol tendency punches through the flavor palette.  Taste/Mouthfeel: Sweet at first, the honey is quite pronounced. It sticks around for the entire sip. The hops (which are all floral) are there in abundance, but paradoxically mellow, and they blend perfectly with a sweet-bread malt foundation. Gentle carbonation throughout allows for a full taste without gassing you out. Rinses leaving a hop-remnant in the back of the mouth.  Overall: Great. You just can't get much better than this.  I paired it up with some spicy Mexican fare...another great combination. Definitely worth the slightly higher-than-average price tag.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",Imperial IPA,98
287,17112,mwa423,2,"a - pours a slightly hazy burnt orange with no head to speak of.  S -orange bitters, lots of alcohol and hints of hopslam's citrus glory.  T - incredibly barleywine like with overwhelming alcohol and a harsh biting bitterness that cloys to the back of the throat.  M - mouthfeel is overly rich, biting and slides down the throat like slime.  Overall, avoid the cask. What is amazing in bottles and life changing on tap is actually awful to drink.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",Imperial IPA,98
287,17112,chickenm,4.5,"Big thanks to Viggo for this one! Pours a copper orange color with a solid white head. Aroma has sweet honey and sugar with a whack of hops. Taste and mouthfeel are excellent! Great flavors of citrus, honey, caramel, and pine. Very good balance, this was not as bitter as I expected it to be. Drinkability is crazy good, I sure didn't notice the 10% abv until after I was finished!",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",Imperial IPA,98
287,17112,IronLover,4.12,"Sampled from a bottle with no freshness date. Bright orange-yellow in color with a slight haze. Poured with a thick white head with that reduces to islands of white foamy and thick sticky lacings on the glass. Huge cirus hop aroma, citris, orange, mango, and an underlying sweet aroma as well. Smooth, thick mouth feel. The fuller side of medium bodied which subdues the carbonation a bit. Intense citrus hop and sweet honey flavor. A bit alcohol burn toward the finish. Leaves a light lingering bitter aftertaste.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",Imperial IPA,98
287,17112,CZeman,5,"I have got to say that this is probably the best IPA that I have ever had. It starts off pouring a beautiful golden with orange highlights. The aroma is nothing but well thought out citrus characters. The Flavor is nothing shy of exceptional, as it first hits the tongue with a citrusy delight, and lingers for a while and finishes off with a floral quality that blends nicely with the subtle sweetness that the Honey in this master piece adds. The Body has been well designed to match the multitude of hop characteristics that mingle in this beer. Cheers to the brewers at Bell's for once again amazing me with this beer. Every year it never fails to please.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",Imperial IPA,98
287,17112,OddNotion,4.2,"Received in a trade with my buddy in Illinois. So excited to try this one! Batch 10093, bottles January 3, 2011. It is a little old but it is not available to me so I will review this now, and re-review if a fresh bottle next year is that much better.  Appearance: Poured into my Sierra Nevada 30th anniversary bulb glass. Transparent orange color with a 1 finger pure white head. The head recedes to half a finger but never falls below that amount.  Smell: Even at almost 3 months old the hop aroma is nice and pungent. It is very sweet and almost like fruit juice.  Taste: No bitterness but some very nice hop complexity. Very many fruity flavors from the hops and the malts completely take a back seat. It is like nothing I have ever tasted and for 10% is very smooth, no booziness to be found. I honestly would not mind if it were more bitter to back up all the sweetness.  Mouthfeel: I love the feel of this beer, it is very easy to drink, lighter body and the carbonation is prevalent but not over powering. As the beer is in the glass longer, the carbonation outdoes itself and the beer begins to fall a little flat.  Overall: I want to try this fresh very badly, I will make a better attempt next year. However, it is still delicious and I would recommend it to others.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",Imperial IPA,98
287,17112,milkbaby9,4.3,"12oz bottle (batch 10196 drank 18 Mar 2011) into Duvel tulip. 1 finger off-white head reduces quickly with spotty lacing left. A pretty honey and light-gold color with nice clarity.  Aroma - Ruby red grapefruit, mango, pineapple, just a hint of pine but mostly a nice fruity aroma.  Taste - Sweet caramel and toffee in the beginning. Then in the middle, tastes mirroring the aromas appear: ruby red grapefruit and accompanying citrus rind bitterness, mango, dried pineapple, very juicy and fruity. A bit of buttery toasty malt slips in, still pretty sweet. And then a bit of the honey comes through in the finish along with a bit of buttery toffee. Alcohol is superbly hidden for 10% ABV.  Carbonation is moderate, a bit more than medium bodied but not quite chewy mouthfeel.  The bitterness rises up gently through the middle and barely hangs in there as the finish is very sweetly malty, contrary to the back label stating, ""A biting, bitter, tongue bruiser of an ale"". This is a bit of a sweetheart - a hoppy fruity ale that also has nice balance.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",Imperial IPA,98
287,17112,d_hondo,4.99,"Bottle poured into snifter; packaged 12.29.2010  A: Hazy amber with a two finger off white head that dissipates in a few minutes. Awesome lacing leaves a film every time you take sip. For comparison, looks almost exactly like Pliny the Elder, which I had earlier tonight. However, Hopslam is a bit hazy, has slightly better head retention, and has much better lacing than PtE. S: Pine, resin and a small hint of honey. T: A balance of citrus and pine hops hit right away and stay throughout. One of the best parts about this beer is the subtle sweetness of honey that comes at the end. It's subtle, but its just enough to counteract the heavy hops a little bit. M: Smooth, medium body with perfect carbonation to compliment. O: An exceptional hop heavy DIPA with a unique balance of honey sweetness; my favorite DIPA.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",Imperial IPA,98
287,17112,azdback,4.25,"Thanks to CaptainNomihoda for this one. Poured into a pilsner glass. Medium orange a smidge cloudy, light bubbles. Head is bright white and very creamy looking. The lace is looking good so far, but falls off pretty bad by the end of the glass. You gotta love the hop slammed dude on the bottle.  Smell is sweet malts or maybe sweet hops. It's both. The hop is orange? A little earthy. No alcohol detected.  Sweet, Sweet, Sweet!! The hops hit first, but not the bitter hop bomb of a West Coast DIPA but a sweet hop taste. Like a sugar sprinkled orange wedge. This is closely followed by a sweet malt bill. There isn't much yeast taste which I don't mind at all. The alcohol comes to warm the tongue and belly at the end.  The mouth is very luxurious and silky. Carbonated well. Almost the feel of a Barleywine.  This one is a great DIPA but a little too sweet for the style for me. I like the bitter hop Doubles from the West. This bottle was marked batch 10115 which was bottled January 11th, 2011. I don't think this would lose that much bittering hop flavor in two and a half months. I do highly recommend this one though.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",Imperial IPA,98
287,17112,AmericanGothic,4.97,"Poured into a Unibroue tulip.  A: Clear golden honey color, one-finger off white head with excellent retention. Good lace, but not excellent-- really the only (tiny) fault I can find with this beer.  S: Fresh, ripe Missouri peaches, the most wonderful fruit of the year. Surreal quality.  T: Fresh grapefruit balanced by sweet malt. The flavor of the honey does not come through on its own, but blends with the malt to make something that is best described as ""magic."" Nothing else like it. The finish starts sweet, turns briefly to alcohol, then mild bitterness. Fantastic. Maintains this profile even as the beer warms.  M: Smooth and creamy, carbonation keeps the body right on target.  O: Almost certainly the best beer I've ever had. Absolutely top notch.  Hype, schmype-- this is the real thing. My quest for the next several months will be to see what comes closest to this, for when I don't have any left. So far, no luck, but the search makes life interesting. Lusting after this beer will probably lead me to finally take up homebrewing (family, forgive me.)",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",Imperial IPA,98
287,17112,wchollif,3.83,"Thanks Kingkong for the popping the mini-keg.  Started our DIPA night out with the Hopslam. This beer poured with much less carbonation and head than our other DIPA's, wonder if it was a mini-keg issue? That said, the color is beautiful, darkest of the tasting, hazy and brown-gold color. The aroma was super hopped pine, citrus and sweetness. The hop flavor was much more muted than the nose would indicate. I'm getting more sweet than pine or citrus hops. This beer isn't terribly bitter but just seems disjointed with the sweet vs. hops. This finished third to an amazing dreadnaught and good exponential hoppiness.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",Imperial IPA,98
287,17112,DangQuesadilla,4.95,"I had the pleasure of trying this on tap at my local establishment. Lucky for me, the company was buying and I splurged on a $9 a glass brew. I found this amazing.  The smell was fantastic... as the sweet aroma of peaches overwhelmed me. The carbonation was low. The mouthfeel exuded a strong content of alcohol, which I found out was 10%. I could not help but keeping swirling the glass like a fine wine and taking in the lovely aroma of the hops.  I am only sorry this is a seasonal beer and can't wait until next year when I can sample it again.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",Imperial IPA,98

287,17112,Mosley1212,4.38,"(Taken from notes over spring break)  Had this on draft at Deckard's American Tavern in Atlanta, GA while visiting my girlfriend. Beer was served at the proper temperature in a tulip.  A--Bright orange with slight carbonation bubbling up from the bottom. Thin white head that had a sticky retention throughout the drink.  S--Hops. The first sniff produced a waive of hops that washed over my entire nasal cavity. That was followed with the fresh scent of pine that was very reminiscent of freshly cut grass, or a forest. Points deducted because of the sweet, syrupy scent that was also detected when I smelled it.  T--One of the best DIPA that I have ever tried. Follows perfectly with the style. The hops wash over the palate first, followed by the piney taste, but the sweetness on the back of the tongue lasts a little too long for what I like. The final drink of the beer was almost undrinkable for me. It was so overly sweet and syrupy that I almost spit it out. That was the most unappealing trait of the beer, very disappointing.  M--Great for the style. The tongue was harshly beaten by the hops in this beer, but the sweet syrup finish placated the uncomfortable feeling the hops produce. Personally, I love the feeling of hops on the tongue, and to me that really made this beer.  O--This beer lived up to the hype for me, but it was not the best DIPA I have ever had. To be honest, I would not actively seek this out again, but I would never pass it up if it were available.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",Imperial IPA,98

287,17112,HattedClassic,4.42,Appearance: Two fingers worth of head when poured and diminished quite quickly while leaving lacing behind. The foam appears to be slightly creamy. The beer itself is a clear copper.  Smell: I can smell a mixture of hops and honey laced with some sweet malts. The hops border more on the piney while the honey adds a nice sweet touch to it  Taste: Mouthgasm. I like the mixture of the bitter hops and the sweetness of the honey. The hops hit the tongue first and finishes with the sweet honey.  Mouthfeel: Light carbonation on the tongue. A pretty smooth drink with a silky feel. I noticed how the beer is slightly heavier than other ones that I've had.  Overall: MOUTHGASM!!! Worth the money. Worth the hype. I'm thinking about aging this just to see what happens when the hops are gone. Or I may just drink it.,Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",Imperial IPA,98

S- Maybe my nose is off, but it smelled completely like grapefruit and peaches. Sorry, in my experience no pine, no floral notes. Fruit salad fun.  T- This beer is intoxicatingly mutliple personality. Its like drinking two completely different beers at once. Devil hop, and angel honey. 10% ABV? You must be kidding...No I feel suddenly VERY relaxed. They aren't kidding.

This beer is top-notch, although the hop-lover in me sheds a silent tear every time I enjoy one (and enjoy them I do), because the top-tier hops combination is slightly masked by the honey, which detracts ever so slightly from what makes me appreciate the best double ipa's.

Complex and inviting.  T: The honey is intense up front. Floral and fruity flavors follow and then the bite of the earthy hops. The hops lingers but isn't out of balance or control. An alcohol taste lingers at the back end at times that seems a bit out of balance as compared to other top tier craft brews.  M: Full bodied with the honey seemingly thickening this brew. Creamy, almost chewy at times. Dryness and an alcohol bite come in after the smooth, creamy honey.  O: I was looking forward to trying this based on all the hype it receives on BA, and I wasn't let down. The presence of the honey doesn't make this a particularly drinkable beer for me because my palate doesn't enjoy beers with much sweetness.

It's sweet, a little floral, not bitter at all.  The alcohol level (10%) is nonexistent. This is a consistently smooth beer, but at the same time, you know what you're drinking, so you don't get stupid drinking a ton of it.  Mouthfeel is wonderful.

Finished with some notes of orange peel. Very tasty.

Edited after finishing the 6 pack...I looked less and less forward to each beer in this 6-pack, anticipating the ever-present Yankee Candle Christmas Pine-Tree aroma.

Slight haze, but very translucent. Lacing is evident but fades quickly; however, spots of foam are present throughout.  Smell: I would like to extract this scent and have it surgically implanted into my nostrils. All kidding aside, one of the best scents that I've ever smelled. Floral, citrus, grapefruit hops abound. Can pick up some slight honey and malt. To smell this beer and not take a sip would be hellascious torture.  Taste: Perfectly balanced. Bitterness of hops is offset by the abundant honey presence. Hoppy up front, sweetness in the middle, both in the back. Slight bitter aftertaste. Absolutely delicious.  Mouthfeel: Medium bodied, coats the tongue. Slightly astringent.  Drinkability: Dangerous!

T- Mild Bitterness into sweetness. Starts on the tongue with a mild bitterness that quickly aided by honey that complement one another well. The 10% is hiden...it's there, but mild.  M- Medium bodied. Mildly bitter and crisp.  O- Great...period (or three periods)",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",Imperial IPA,98
287,17112,SteveGNC,5,"I probably can't add anything useful to what has already been written about this outstanding beer, but here goes. Pours a beautiful golden color with nice head and great lacing on the glass. The aroma is exceptional- very fruity, notes of peaches and of course hops. The taste is unbelievable. Without a doubt the most well balanced double IPA there is. Just the right amount of sweetness to offset the bitterness of the hops. I know this is an overly hyped beer, but in this case the accolades are true. If (god forbid) I could only drink one beer for the rest of my life, this would undoubtedly be my choice.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",Imperial IPA,98
287,17112,secondtooth,4.64,"Rich golden in appearance, with nice white foam. Superb lacing.  Aroma is breathtaking...floral, grapefruit citrus, a little pine. Absolutely appealing.  Flavor is sweet but with a sustained hop sharpness. Maybe the honey is the balance? Pine, sweet grapefruit, and really very enjoyable.  The high ABV is concealed well, too. This is a superior IPA, and one I'll definitely re-experience again.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",Imperial IPA,98
287,17112,gabedivision,4.49,"Got a 6 pack of this from the ABC Tavern in Cleveland Ohio last week. Poured from a 12oz bottle to a Dogfish Head Snifter glass.  A- Pours a nice copper amber with a a thin finger head that quickly fades.  S- A big sweet bang, followed by strong citrus flavors. Piny and grapefruit flavors dominate this sweet scent that i just cant get enough of.  T- Bitter/sweet. Starts on the tongue with a strong bitterness that quickly aided by the sweet sugary honey that melds to the two well. Citrusy hops and sweet malts with a small touch of that 10 percent abv shining through on the end.  M- Medium bodied. Very bitter and crisp.  D- This beer is a great DIPA that doesn't dominate in the boozy category. Highly drinkable, i can dig it!",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",Imperial IPA,98

287,17112,danielsonc,4.62,"My first review  Appearance: a light amber color with a relatively good head on top after a pour  Smell: definitely get the aroma of both strong hops with a bit of subtle sweetness to it  Taste: At first it doesn't seem like a typical strong punch of hops taste I was expecting, but after a couple of seconds that rush comes. You get progression from light, subtly sweet to a bash of hops taste  Drinkability: With an 10% ABV it doesn't pack a huge alcohol punch and is relatively drinkable.  Overall: for an IPA is great. I'm not one who really prefers an extremely hoppy beer, or maybe one thats just hops and nothing else. This beer has a nice equilibrium to it, honey and hops, sweet and bitter.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",Imperial IPA,98
287,17112,tehchunk,4.17,"A - Poured into a Bell's tulip glass. Gorgeous, off-white 1 finger head rests on top of a very clean, semi-transparent copper body with plenty of bubbles arising from the abyss to keep the head nice & pillowy. Great head retention & lacing throughout.  S - Piney, outdoorsy with pleasant notes of citrus, grapefruit and a faint sweetness. Not as aromatic as some other IPAs I've had.  T - Taste definitely compliments the smell very well. A lot of the same flavors but much more powerful. Pine & citrus that finishes with a smooth, sweet bitterness that leaves the palette waiting for the next sip. Not too much alcohol presence, just enough to remind you that it's 10%.  M - Mouthfeel is on the medium side for a double IPA. Sticky & almost oily but is accompanied nicely by the bite of the citrus.  D - Big fan of this brew. For a double IPA that rings in at 10%, you can't really go wrong with this one. Not highly drinkable but definitely good for a couple of bottles in one session.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",Imperial IPA,98

Taste is bitter hops and grapefruit at first that mellow out very smoothly into a nice sweet malty backbone. Very very good.  Mouthfeel is medium and sticky. It coats the mouth and tongue, leaving behind some bitterness and sweetness.  Drinkability is great. This is one of the best beers I've had, and hands down the best DIPA out there.

Finger length khaki color head. very nice retention. that should be expected with the higher abv. Smell of sweet hops. grapefruit, honey, and light floralness to it. overall smells sweet and citrusy. taste of pineapple and citrus fruits. the bitterness is present but masked well with all the warmth of the alcohol. slight malty and stickyness to this. the overall sweetness takes over in the beginning and the bitterness takes charge towards the end. mouthfeel is a sticky almost oily presence. the grapefruit taste makes this a little tart which kind of pokes and prods at the palate. overall enjoyable just a little sticky. as being called hopSLAM and claiming its a ""tongue bruiser"" is a little far fetched for what they were going for. but being as sweet as it is, makes this for an enjoyable and drinkable Imperial.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",Imperial IPA,98

It just looks luscious and commanding of respect.  Hopslam emits lots of citrus notes, some pear (like the canned pears we ate as kids), and some almost rosemary notes. This beer has a ton to smell and is quite potent.  My wife says it screams of grapefruit and tropical floral notes and I agree on the overall citrus/floral in the taste. The bitterness is very pleasant unlike some of the other heavily hopped beers on the market. The alcohol is warming in the throat as you would expect. Funny as it is, I burped and got a lot of pineyness haha.  The mouthfeel is slightly resiny and nicely carbonated. The bitterness on the tongue and back of throat is expected.

287,17112,Chico1985,4.2,"My first HopSlam, starting off what should be a pretty crazy weekend. Received 2 of these and many Surly goodies from a trade with surlytwinsfan, much thanks! This is batch 10100 which was bottled 1/5/11.  Pours glowing orange with very nice creamy white head, starts leaving lacing right away. Retains at a half finger.  The smell burst through upon cracking the cap. Pineapple and grapefruit, honey and caramel, all sprinkled with some sugar. Quite aromatic and probably 5 worthy at first, but seems to quickly lose strength.  Taste seems to differ a bit from the scent. Lots more of a pine/resin influence at work, still getting big pineapple, grapefruit and orange peel, and some tropical notes as well. I always wondered how the honey was integrated in this beer and it actually does seem to have a nice role, adding a nice flavor and subtle sweetness. Quite bitter but caramel malt does a good job of trying to balance it out.  Incredibly smooth, creamy mouthfeel. Carbonation seems to be on the low side, but it feels extremely light. Some booze noticeable but I'd say it's hidden for 10%.  A damn good DIPA. The smell beats out the taste for me, but for a 10% DIPA this is definitely among the smoothest, tastiest ones around.

Remarkably smooth.  D: Considering the 10% ABV, this goes down like water.  Comments: If you didn't tell me this beer was a 10% ABV. beer, I'd think it was just a very good IPA. I prefer the Two-Hearted Ale in terms of flavor and complexity. The drink on this bad boy, though, is where it stands out. It's a borderline session beer in terms of how easy it goes down . . .

Smell: Nothing but the freshest and most tropical hops ever; mango, peach, pineapple, pappaya. Like sitting in high tide and being washed away into euphoria. Just dares you to take a dive in.  Taste: Follows the aroma, but with a great fresh slice of ruby-red grapefruit thrown in with more tropical fruity hints at the middle and end of the sip. Bells could not of picked better hops (probably cascade) for this perfect brew. As it warms, the peach dominates as well as the strong caramel malt backbone. Well done.  Mouthfeel: Smooth as 10% will ever taste. The 106 IBU's hit you at the beginning of the tongue, then smoothed over with a mango steam roller. Everything from the ABV to the malt and hops is perfectedly balanced. Couldn't ask for more.  Drinkability: I've drank a whole growler by myself before without even noticing until feeling the slam the next morning.. It is like an prank on your senses. As soon as you set down the glass, you can't escape, you strive for another sip, its eggs you on until you stand up, fall down and attempt to get up once more.

287,17112,Spider889,3.74,"From the bottle, guess it was time I got this review up.  Love the label, love the (labeled) bottle cap.  Crystal clear golden honey color, which is appropriate given that honey is used in the recipe. The head is short and fluffy white. Retention is pretty much nil, and it recedes to some soapy looking bubbles circling the glass. Spotty lace is too gooey to stick.  The smell is amazing. Very floral, tons of citrus. Orange, grapefruit, lemon, and something like chamomile mingle with mild pine and astringent alcohol.  The flavor isn't as malty as the average Midwest DIPA, though it does have some light biscuitty malt flavor. The hops taste of bitter pine resin, and the alcohol is biting and sweet. The honey is subdued, but you can definitely tell they use it.  Boozy, prickly hop bitterness meet prickly carbonation. This beer stings my chapped lips. The beer is slick and sticky, the finish is very bitter and lingers on forever.  I get that this is a desirable brew, but I don't get the insane mega hype people raise over the beer either. Definitely not the best DIPA out there.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",Imperial IPA,98

A: Pour produces 1/2 inch of pure dense white foam atop a light orange body. Moderate lacing.  S: Aroma is primarily pine with some citrus (grapefruit/lemon) and peach and there's a sweetness that is probably the honey but is coming across a little like mint. Very nice!  T: The piney hoppiness come across very aggressively and the peach is very pronounced. It's all held up by a nice strong malt backbone. Not alot of reviewers have commented on this and it really surprises me but the taste of alcohol is very strong to me. It really stands out. It's not that shocking because it is a 10% beer but it's very prominent.  M: I love the thickness here. It's not RIS thick but it's got a nice heavy mouthfeel that alot of DIPA's have.

Taste: very crisp, though less hoppy than expected from the name and the description ""tongue bruiser."" Honey sweetness dulls the ""slam"" of the hops.  Mouthfeel: Swirls sweet and piney but a swallow lets the mouth dry quickly; back of the tongue is crisp. Carbonation is deceptively present.  Drinkability: very drinkable, though remarkably I could use more hops and less honey for the name.  I really loved this beer but I felt as though the name implies something that it isn't.

Overall a very solid DIPA, although the upfront sweetness is somewhat of an oddity for this style. IMO, Pliny beats it easily. It is not a ""conventional"" DIPA I believe, due to the flip in the flavor profile (honey sweetness upfront, followed by hops).

Fortunately, I was able to give one to itsfreeasinbeer for his birthday, so thanks guys!  A - Maybe it's because I know there's honey in this, but all I see is honey. It pours with a fairly meager head, but no points deducted for that. Gorgeous beer.  S - Fruity smelling. Mainly grapefruit and some other citrus. A bit of pine and honey comes through. I can tell it's gonna be an interesting brew, and I can smell the alcohol a bit.  T - Man, this is an intriguing beer. The honey sweetness comes out, but is balanced by the bitterness of the hops, which is balanced (not entirely, but mostly) by the malts. Cool, cool brew.  M - The perfect amount of syrupy to make the flavor last long enough. The malt backbone almost takes away the bitter kick at the finish, but it's just slightly lacking. The carbonation is spot on.

Taste and Mouthfeel - Still very hoppy-tasting, but not as bitter as I was expecting. I still taste something sweeter, but still slightly bitter throughout like grapefruit. Bitterness is most intense in the finish, but the aftertaste is mellow. Texture is very well-balanced.

287,17112,haazer,4.12,"So here it is, Hopslam. I was going to wait till next years release because I love hoppy beers, but I hate when they sit for a time and lose the hop aroma and flavor. I saw this at the bottle shop yesterday though and couldn't pass it up. No bottled date but this came out a little over a month ago. Served in a Weyerbacher tulip.  A- A bubbly orange marmelade brew pours into the tulip. Nice carbonation rising to meet a moon crater head. Some yellow and honey undertones in the color of this. As I fill the glass it becomes hazy and cloudy. Slight bits of spotty lacing are present.  S- The aroma seems to still be fairly present in a hoppy beer. Upfront is a great blend of citrus, sticky grapefruit, lemon, hop cones, and sweetness, most likely from the honey. Great smelling DIPA.  T- Taste follows the aroma somewhat, but I feel this has lost its hop kick. Taste is grapefruit in the beginning, then transitions into some flor hop flavors. A sweet honey pulls strongly as the flavors roll across the tongue, and the end is a blend of lemon and lime, and a tingey bitterness. Not as hop forward as 106 IBU's would suggest, but I think this lost freshness. Alcohol is almost non existent.  M- Mouthfeel is somewhat buttery. The aftertaste leaves a piney zesty feel on the tongue, along with the bitterness provided from the amount of hops. There is a slight amount of heat to hint at the abv.  D- Despite this having lost some of its hop freshness, or at least what I have concluded, this is still really drinkable. The abv is not tasted but felt a little in the mouth. I'd love to try this fresh and might re-review this next year. It's a drink now or forever your hops are weak if you wait too long with these beers. I'd like to chalk up a win for Nugget Nectar against this(even though not a DIPA) but I'll have to revisit this in the future when fresh.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",Imperial IPA,98
287,17112,Fluke828,4.03,"Batch Finder on Bell's Website says this was bottled on 1/3/2011 Finally getting to try this courtesy of AleLovinRuskie (thanks Adam) Poured from a 12oz bottle into a Cigar City Snifter. Half-finger head with some decent lacing, nothing too serious though. Color is a gorgeous burnt orange/pale copper.  Smell is of boozy citrusy hops, mild pine resin towards the back.  Taste is of stone fruits up front with hoppy citrus bitterness in the middle with the pine and resin as found in the nose along with some floral flavors and a kiss of honey that somehow adds a perfect amount of subtle sweetness to the malts towards the finish, complex yet simplistically balanced.  Very interesting mouth feel. Very lively flavors that linger well into the aftertaste. A symphony of carbonation and sweet/bitter balance that sings as it washes down.  This brew is dangerously drinkable. Bitterness covers up the heat even though I could smell a faint bit of it in the nose at first. Very well done. So glad I got to try this.  Side note: After the first few sips, I let this warm up considerably before really focusing on it for review. Although the flavors became more apparent, so did the heat to a minor extent.

Went into Paradiso and found they had it available in a cask, and had to give it a go.  Comparing it casked to bottled, it's pretty much what you'd think. Less carbonation and chill, and thus a little more flavor poking through. All the same, I prefer it bottled. The heaviness of the beer and the intensity of its honey-hopped notes lend themselves to some cooler-carbonated levity. I'm really glad I had the chance to grab this casked, since it really does allow you to get at some of those notes a little more accurately, but the trade off in drinkability I think sends the beer over the edge.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",Imperial IPA,98
287,17112,woodychandler,3.86,"I have long said that one of the best decisions of my life was founding The CANQuest (tm). The fact that they are CANning this beer ~ five years after my initial CANned beer review is telling. There was a LOT of discussion back then about what CANstituted a CAN, but it was determined that a 5L mini-keg would count as long as it was a) non-pressurized and b) gravity-driven. I was so happy then and even happier now, when I had begun to despair of FOMO, followed by a CANdiculous trade. I was visiting local Country Garden Six-Pack when I saw two six-packs on the shelf! Not being a beer greed-o, I bought one & traded most of the sixer for other cool CANs. Today (Su, 20 March 2016) is my turn!  From the CAN: ""Ale Brewed with Honey""; ""Unfiltered [-] Best Kept Refrigerated [-] Unpasteurized""; ""An exceptionally aromatic blend of hops combine in this balanced interpretation of the Double IPA style. Best enjoyed as fresh as possible."" The graphics look great on aluminum, BTW!  The Crack! tried to fight me, but eventually gave up & succumbed. I then caught a squirt across my fingertips & sat back in surprise! Hopslam is a squirter?!? OMFG! It settled to reveal a brimful craft CAN & my heart leapt! I gently stroked the exterior of the CAN before CANmencing a VERY gentle Glug. I want to draw this one out as long as possible & it seems to be on a hair-trigger. Even this generated a finger of dense, foamy, tawny head with great retention, leaving sticky lacing behind as it fell. Color was solidly Amber (SRM = > 7, < 9) with NE-quality clarity. Nose was simply dank, really green, sticky, earthy & even a little minty. I think that I will pour some into a Petri dish, dry it out and smoke it later. Mouthfeel was medium. The taste was ... Ahhh, ahhh, ahhh! It burns! It is like hydrofluoric acid on my poor, bruised tongue! It is shoving the weak, unsuspecting taste buds out of the way and worming its way into the interior of my tongue with an active flamethrower! Ahhhh! I'm back, following a visit from the local Fire Department & a trip to the ICU. Phew! The hops were, shall we say, intense, but cooling. In fact, as it warmed, the sweetness of the inherent honey began to peer through, like the first buds of spring. The taste was like a conglomeration of hops from wet to English (earthy) to PACNW (minty) to straight dank & then drizzled with honey. OMFG x 2! The finish was hot and minty, like a dragon had just flossed, brushed & rinsed with minty wash. Why, oh, why did I trade those others away? Oh, right, I'm a recovering hops addict & this does not help.  Oh damn, any regrets that I may have had in not going to Philly for the fest at the shipyard evaporated when I saw this on the table yesterday (Central PA Bottle Share, Sa, 05 Mar 2011). As the late Mickey Spillane would have said, ""I creamed my jeans""! I was so cowed by its presence that I had to ask ffejherb for permission to open it, to which he enthusiastically assented. I had to read the directions, because if I screwed the pooch, I would be a pariah and it was so early on. The big Q for me was the initial venting, but I remembered the pull, twist and pour from my Best Brown in the Fall.  I got a finger-and-a-half of soapy ecru head with decent retention off of my pour. Color was a solid amber with NE-quality clarity. BUPGOO! Yeah, give this to the kiddies. Nose was so piney that I began to swoon. It was, in my addled mind, like licking a pine tree. Mouthfeel was medium and the hops had already begun to mute, so the taste was heavier on caramel malt, but I still got some hops on the tongue. The finish was likewise caramel-like initially, but lingering with hops. Dang, but I would like to try this absolutely fresh! No matter, I CAN now die h(a/o)ppy, having had some. Did I mention the excellent lacing throughout? Glug!",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",Imperial IPA,98
287,17112,Gunslinger711,4.33,"Group tasting notes from 2-18-11 Poured out of a bottle. January release. Served in oversize wine glass.  A- Pours a hazy yellow/green color. Small about of head and lacing.  S- Citrus scents right off the bat, orange, grapefruit. This gives way to a good back end hop scent.  M - Light but carbonated mouthfeel, for the heavy scent it doesn't coat the mouth.  T- I had personally had some hopslam when it first came out back in January and I could definitely tell the hops had faded since then. That being said, still a hoppy beer. Just like the scent, you get the great citrus taste on the front, then you get the hoppiness.  Food pairing- We paired it with spicy pork tacos and spicy buffalo wings. The pork was too big for the hopslam, the wings really didn't do anything either.  Overall: The beer didn't convert our non-ipa fans that were good sports and participated. Those who did like it described it as a good summertime sipping beer. Others likened it to ""mixing Oberon with Two-Hearted.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",Imperial IPA,98
287,17112,Blanco,4.22,"golden/orange color with solid white head. excellent lacing. pretty much transparent with none of the particles I've read in the reviews.  The smell is intense from the moment I cracked the bottle and sitting 2 feet away from me (as I take a picture of the poured beer and it's bottle) I still smell the hops intensely. big fruity hops, with tropical fruits and citrus coming through.  The taste is sweet, with some nice hoppiness, but almost no bitterness at all. It's obvious the hops are potent in this, but the honey and sweetness seems to mellow it some.  mouthfeel is lively and light to medium bodied. some lingering aftertaste after each sip.  This is a very nice beer. The ABV is hidden fairly well though not entirely and the sweetness is welcome here. Reminiscent of a nugget nectar but with a stronger hop bill and bigger ABV. Still a true DIPA. Definitely happy I tried this. Only wish I had more than just the one bottle.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",Imperial IPA,98
287,17112,ngeunit1,4.62,"A - Pours a bright slightly hazy copper-orange color with a finger of white frothy head. The retention was okay, wit ha nice ring forming around the glass with some lacing.  S - Tons of citrus and hop flavor with lots of grapefruit and orange aromas. There is also some sweet honey and carmel malt flavors blended in as well.  T - Starts off with some building hop bitterness with some citrus flavors (lots of grapefruit) building alongside. Also some nice sweet honey and carmel malts flavors mixed in for a nice balanced. Through the middle some nice bitterness comes through alongside some more citrus flavor and some piney flavor. The finish is a very nice blend of the carmel malts, some citrus flavor, and some honey flavor which lingers nicely with some bitterness.  M - Medium-full bodied with moderate lively carbonation. Really smooth and crisp in the mouth. Finish leaves a really dry finish in the mouth alongside the bitterness which is really nice.  D - Very drinkable. The 10% abv here is nowhere to be found. The balance here is fantastic and the hop profile is really really nice.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",Imperial IPA,98

Could use a little bit more of a malt backbone, but still very balanced.  M- Smooth, crisp, refreshing  D- Very easy to drink and the 10% alcohol is only slightly noticeable in the smell.

287,17112,EricCioe,4.52,"On cask at Pints & Quarts in Muskegon during a Bell's Takeover the Taps event, 3 March 2011.  This pours orange peel orange with a slight haze, just a ring of head or so. The guy next to me was drinking the same thing, though, and he had a finger of frothy white head that left good lacing, so I think it was just the pour that wasn't great on mine. On the nose the two most prominent notes to me were oranges and honey. It wasn't overpowering in intensity. There was some dry malt backbone lingering under the honey, but it was mostly the citrus aromas coming through. In the mouth, there is citrus, mostly orange but some grapefruit, too. But the real kicker here was honey, an absolutely amazing honey note that hit the tongue right away and stuck around with the bitterness through the long finish. It was medium bodied, not quite as large as I thought it might be, and totally put-away-able. My pint disappeared quickly.  This on cask was one of the best beers I've ever had.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",Imperial IPA,98
287,17112,Gosox8787,4.65,"Presentation: 12 oz. bottle poured into a Sam Adams pint glass. Batch #10101, bottled January 4th, 2011.  Appearance: Light orange in color. Pours a nice two finger white head with above average retention.  Aroma: Pineapple, tropical fruit, and honey notes really make up the main flavors here. A touch of bitter pine in the background as well.  Taste: Tropical fruits (pineapple and mango) create a new backdrop. The honey adds a nice sweetness to enhance the fruit notes. A small bit of pine and bitter hops toward the end, but at this point in its shelf life, the fruit definitely overpowers it. A very slight malt presence, but it is not a main component.  Mouthfeel: Full bodied and lush. Nicely carbonated. Perfect for a double IPA in my opinion.  Drinkability: The balance of sweet and hoppy is perfect for me. The ABV is ridiculously well hidden. Definitely is not a chore to put down three or four bottles of this.  Overall, a great, balanced imperial IPA. I loved the tropical fruit notes and the prevailing sweetness. I can only imagine this is even more impressive fresh.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",Imperial IPA,98
287,17112,Mississipping,3.95,"12oz poured into a Lost Abbey snifter.  A: Pours a hazy golden/copper color with a one finger off-white head that quickly dissipates and settles to a sticky ring, leaving considerable lacing behind.  S: Grapefruit, pineapple, hops, and a slight caramel sweetness. That's about all that's there, but there's plenty of it and it smells amazing.  T: Grapefruit and a slight caramel sweetness right up front and then quickly shifts to a quite bitter hoppy/piney finish that really lingers. Much less complex and balanced than some of the other DIPAs I've had lately.  M: Thinner than expected, with only a slight, slight bit of creaminess. Bitter and drying with really no hint of alcohol anywhere.  D: Moderate drinkability, although the bitterness makes it a sipper. I could put a few of these down, but it might take a bit of time.  Overall, this was just mediocre in my opinion. I think I ruined this by having some really exceptional IPAs within the last couple of weeks, and this really didn't compare. Less complex, flavorful, and off balance a bit. Not bad, but I have no problem waiting another year for this one, and probably won't think about it much between now and then.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",Imperial IPA,98

Powerful, awesome. Incredible mouthfeel, smooth and creamy. Extraordinarily drinkable for such a high ABV. The alcohol is completely masked.  Hops hit you up front and then there's sweet malts too, and an amazing smooth honey finish.

287,17112,legalpete19340,4.2,A: Pours a clear honey colored orangish-yellow with a thick head that took its time leaving. Did a decent job of lacing the glass.  S: A dankness sits on top of strong pine notes. Could be my imagination from the label but I swear I get honey notes too. Some grapefruit but mostly pine.  T: Strong bite in this beer and a fizziness on the tongue. Lots of grapefruit and much more than the scent led on. The finish is quite sweet and again I swear I get honey. The bite is balanced by subdued pine and sweetness. I get the 10% ABV after letting a sip settle. Warm.  M: Medium. Not syrupy. Fizzy and full.  D: As a DIPA this is pretty drinkable for me. The sweetness doesnt offend and would order another.  No doubt this is a very well crafted beer but something was missing for me to set it apart as exceptional.,Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",Imperial IPA,98

Lots of tropical fruit, more tangerine, moderate bitterness, and sweet maltiness and honey in the finish.  M: Heavy mouthfeel and a little sticky.  D: An excellent DIPA.

287,17112,jonvan04,4.22,"Poured a light orange color with a thin amount of head. The nose was a mix of piney and citrusy hops, lots of hops. The taste was a ton of hop bitterness with a light amount of sweetness. It was nicely carbonated with a bunch of bubbles coating the toungue as it goes down. The alcohol was very well hidden as I had no clue that this was 10% until I glanced at the bottle again. However, there was also a lot of dryness to it that made it a little difficult to drink as I got farther down the class.  Overall this was definitely one of the better double ipas I've had, however even knowing that it's a big beer I wish it was still a little more drinkable.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",Imperial IPA,98
287,17112,KYBrewgrass,4.2,"A- 4.5 Hopslam is a pretty light orange color and can barely be seen through. It has lots of bubbles and a nice, sticky white head that clings to the glass. An aggressive pour gave it 1-2 fingers. There is high lacing with this one.  S- 4.5 Hops, hops, hops... And a sweet citrus. There's a hint of pine as well. It's a very intense but welcoming scent. It would be agonizing to smell this and not be able to try it!  T- 4 As it smells, the hops are dominant. However, they are balanced out considerably well by a honey and citrus blend. This is a good tasting powerfully-hopped ale. It can leave you puckering. It's also just slightly boozy on the finish (though not bad considering its 10% ABV).  M- 4.5 Great medium body and carbonation with this brew. It is velvety and smooth (once you forget about the taste for a second and concentrate on the feel it's quite good). Only a tinge of syrup as it goes down but this seems to fit.  D- 4 This beer is pretty drinkable for its style. This is a matter of personal preference for me; I'm not the biggest hop-head out there but as imperial IPAs go I could drink as many of these as any. It definitely has a 'kick' to it, though, so be careful! Always an annual treat worth picking up.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",Imperial IPA,98
287,17112,OrangeCharlie,2.7,"A: Poured a nice deep golden, almost copper color.  S: The nose is great...pretty much all hops. Good blend of earthy, pungent with a touch of citrusy strains in there too.  T: Way too dry for the hop level, way off balance. Bitterness is just harsh and overpowering. Very hot and boozy on the swallow. I know the beer is 10% ABV, but I really think you can brew a much smoother beer at this level. Too much honey...it doesn't add anything but dryness. And too much at that. I can see what they were trying to accomplish, but it was just too dry for the hop level. Overall, the beer just comes off as an overly bitter, one note flavor.  M: Nice body, good carbonation level. Everything is OK here.  D: Again, the booziness and bitterness make this beer tough to throw back. I like DIPA's...I've even had very quaffable ones that are around 9-10%.

A - golden, pleasant to look at, very little head that dissipates quickly  S - slightly fruity with a smell of honey, it is pleasant to the senses - unlike some other ""beers,"" Hopslam does not smell of alcohol despite its high ABV  T - Fruit to honey to hops, leaving you begging for more. The after-taste is great if you like hops or honey, but if you don't like either of those, then it's not for you.  M - Scintillating for the taste-buds, the spot-on mix of carbonation, alcohol, and honey is quite pleasant and most certainly doesn't turn your mouth.

I picked up a pretty significant dank aroma as well, somewhat of a sulfurous smell, like rotting plants.  T - Fruity, juicy hops hit first, grapefruit and mango. The honey is very prevalent, this one is quite sweet in the middle, lingering alcohol burn on the end. I actually felt like the booze hit pretty hard, but it wasn't overwhelming.  Mouthfeel- Plenty of body, oily hops, and chewiness here...it feels like a big beer.

No smell of alcohol. Smells refreshing.  T- Wonderful. Grapefruit punch accompanied by lemony tastes. Smooth honey finish that distinguishes Hopslam from other DIPAs. It is smooth throughout with enough bitterness to be pleasant, but not enough to dominate the taste profile.  M- Not much carbonation to a medium body. Seems thicker at times when I have had it in bottle.  D- I look forward to Hopslam every year and don't mind the price. Nice perk to living near Kzoo is Bell's addition of Hopslam during the summer.

287,17112,Soonami,4.07,"Outside of a handful of beers, such as PtE and Dark Lord, there are few beers that are as hyped as Hopslam. Though good, I just feel like it isn't deserving of the devotion this beer inspires. This is coming from someone that had friends drive 2 hours to a distributor to buy cases and a mini-keg from a distributor (I live in PA). I think that the beer has a very nice hoppy aroma, but is it better than most good, fresh DIPA (probably not). There are smells of wildflower meadow, spruce resin, grapefruit rind, and sweet orange. The beer is definitely hoppy, but the flavor doesn't jump out at me as the best I've ever had. The honey definitely is present in the flavor, but it has a bit of an artificial McDonald's ""honey"" tanginess. The beer is too thin with too much alcohol (probably from the added honey) that is definitely present on the tongue that contributes to the perceived bitterness of the beer. The beer is tasty and finishing 1 or 2 is not a problem. But you'll definitely suffer palate fatigue after about half a glass from the alcohol and hops and then you won't really know what you're tasting afterwards.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",Imperial IPA,98
287,17112,CMB2012,4,"12oz bottle packaged on January 11th, 2001. Poured into a 16oz stemless snifter.  A- Pours a mostly clear copper orange with small particles of sediment swirling around. One and a half finger white cap, very creamy, and dissipates pretty quick. Some lacing and a top coat of foam stick around for the show, especially when given a little agitation.  S- Citrus and pine, some fruity esters, bubble gum and some alcohol.  T- Bitter from start to finish. The variety of hops and the texture of the beer make the taste come out piney more so than citrusy in the end. I am reminded of freshly mown grass. Sweet and sticky up front, dry in the end. The astringency is close to too much, but acceptable.  M- The mouth is medium to medium-full bodied and starts out fairly juicy before the carbonation kicks in and tickles the taste buds, continuing down the throat. The carbonation is on the heavy side and when mixed with the bitter aspect of the hops leans towards distaste.  I certainly do not dislike this beer, and I would enjoy sharing another six pack with someone. However, the balance is a little off for me. I think a bit more malt would do this beer some good. If there were some way and someone willing to cask this beer I would be excited beyond belief!  If you can find it and afford it, buy it.

287,17112,Destral,4.57,"Doing a side by side of Pliny and Hopslam tonight. The Hopslam is batch 10094, but I'm basing most of my review off notes from a month ago when I first got the sixer.  Appearance: My Hopslam has a nice gold appearance, with a bit of orange, and a bit of cloudiness. Decent white head lingers throughout and has above average lacing.  Smell: I get a lot of citrus hops, grapefruit, and orange. One thing I get that's fairly unique to Hopslam is the sweet honey notes.  Taste: I get a bunch of grapefruit and orange up front. There is a lot of sweetness and honey as well. There is a mild resin bitterness on the finish but overall this feels very balanced. Not as aggressively bitter as a west coast beer, but I love the way the honey and malt balances it out.  Mouthfeel: Hopslam doesn't mess around. The beer feels as big as the 10% on the label. Its full bodies, sticky sweet, has lingering bitterness, and really coats my mouth.  Drinkability: One of my favorite parts of this beer is also one of the only things I can fault it for. The addition of honey really gives this a unique flavor profile, but the added alcohol percentage and the heavier mouthfeel makes this one slightly harder to be sessionable. I love the beer overall, but I would have to limit myself to probably 2 bottles in a night.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",Imperial IPA,98

A lot of grapefruit, a little orange, some piney resins. Great hop flavor! Just enough malt for balance -- but still nicely malty with some melonoidin complexity.  Mouthfeel is perfect for a DIPA -- not too syrupy/thick, not too thin. Well carbonated, too.

Head is also light but enough to display the beautiful aroma to follow.  When you take the first sniff you realize you have something special here. Grapefruit and orange notes jump from the glass with a hint of peach and pear. Sweet!  The taste is amazing! Everything you get in the aroma with a nice bitterness that emulates that of a white grapefruit; coats the back of your throat without dominating your entire pallet.  Again, the 10% brew does not have the mouth feel of one. It is light in body without the common ""syrup"" like feel of a beer with this amount of alcohol. Smooth and drinkable!

Printed up the nominee list and made some wagers... And, more importantly, finally cracked my minikeg!  Pale orange in color-- somewhere between dark gold and showing slight hints of copper. Off-white head of 3 sudsy fingers leaves nice thick streaky chunks and ringlets of lace behind.  Smells like Hopslam still-- grapefruit and pineapple! Little malt... Some orangey notes. Huge citrus hops. Me likey.  Taste is great. Just enough malt backbone to act as a solid delivery vessel for a mad hop attack. Some light sweetness early, but huge citrus hops towards the back lingering bitterness at the finish! Man is this good.  Body is pretty full. Strong assertive carbonation helps the beer feel prickly and punchy. Very nice. A light resin and oil feel after the swallow, but it is tasteful and well integrated.  I could drink this all day.... I guess it's cool I have a minikeg! I'm going back for more right now! Lots of people say this beer fades too fast- while it is true that it fades, I've enjoyed many a Hopslam through July!

287,17112,biggied,4.87,"Poured from a bottle into a snifter  A- pours a clear bright copper color, half finger white head appears and slowly dissipates down to a ring, pretty nice lacing  S- Smell is like a pine tree just like a DIPA should, a nice bouquet of hops and sweet honey, nice citrus, lemon and grapefruit, surprisingly I'm getting pineapple as well, sweet.  T- It's called hopslam for a reason, you get a big kick in the mouth from the hops, the sweetness of the honey mixed in with the citrus is a nice middle buffer between the initial hops and the ending hops, at times i find the hops to be well balanced and at other times it seems a little overbearing, not sure whats up with that  M- medium body, silky smooth, slightly high carbonation, i wish it would coat my palate a bit more but it is solid nonetheless  D- Drinkability is there with the alcohol being masked by the huge hops",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",Imperial IPA,98
287,17112,ronniebruner,4.46,"Wow! This is a great beer! Obviously, you will first encounter a sweetened hop taste, which is definitely ok! The beer itself is a beautiful creamy orange color, with minimal head and carbonation. The aroma too is ladened with a hops feel as it should be and is smooth going down. This beer is outstanding. The only downside to this beer is that its $20 for a 6 pack, but if there is any beer worth it, it would be Hopslam! If you have not tried it, you are missing out!",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",Imperial IPA,98
287,17112,BretSikkink,4.67,"The bar poured a lovely clear orange glass of this for me, served with a bare minimum of foam. Some white bubbles and a sticky lacing.  This is one of the most aromatic beers I can think of. So freshly hoppy! Citrics are the dominant force here, with a minty herbal backdrop. Tangerine, orange, grapefruit, mango, pineapple.  This might even ""pop"" more from the tap than the bottle. Definitely an experience. The caramel malt sweetness is an afterthought to this onslaught of fresh American C-hops. Up front it's firm enough to support the bitterness, and the finish tastes of those Danish cookies with the rock sugar on top.  Hops abound: very zesty and full-bodied, definitely not one-dimensional but keeping a good focus on ""bright citric hopping"". As mentioned, a slightly minty herbal-earth note toward the tail end. Body is full but well-attenuated, and the carbonation is low enough to promote a smooth mouthfeel without completely giving into bitterness.  Pretty fantastic if you ask me.

287,17112,dnolan36,3.18,"I was lucky that the beer buyer at a local store called me to let me know he was holding a 6-pack of it for me. I was excited to try it for the first time. However, I wish the hype on this beer was not so high as I do not think it completely lived up to my expectations.  When I opened it I poured it into my Bell's Tulip. It was a nice golden honey color in my glass with a decent fluffy head.  It had a very strong citrus note up front followed by a strong pine scent. The aroma was decent.  The citrus taste was very strong followed by a heavy malt character as well. It was very bitter up front with a smooth finish.  Overall I am glad I tried it. However, in the future I may not hunt it down like I did this time. It is a decent IIPA but by far not may favorite.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",Imperial IPA,98

This is unique.  a-It looks like a glass of honey. viscosity shows; it's thick looking. very deep brown-gold. a head like a root beer float that maintains itself almost throughout the glass.  s-aggressive hop aroma. aggressive. it smells most deeply of pine cones wrapped in flowers. deep, deep hop-induced phenol scent. intensity. hop-o-rama. i imagine extreme DIPAs to smell like this.  t/m-hop milkshake. this is a hop milkshake. it's thick, creamy, and milky. it's actually hop-milky. the honey is very present and off-sets the bitterness that all these hop varietals would produce. it's brilliant. the texture and consistency are unique. the honey aids the piney, syrupy earthiness and accentuates its presence. it's lusciously thick and rich. But the HOP SWEETNESS!  d-i could have another, but the flavor and the consistency are intense and a lot to palate for another or a session. one is plenty. it's so thick and sweet; it's like a dessert beer. i'd like some olive oil ice cream with this.  if i don't have this ever again, i will be sad, but i'd be ok with it, too, as it has such a unique grasp on the style.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",Imperial IPA,98
287,17112,GoGriz,3.66,"Into a sam perfect pint thanks to hayesez!  My first Hopslam and happy to try it. Pours a nice semi-translucent dark gold. Head is billowy and sticks around for a short time. Good lacing around the rim of the glass. The nose falls short for me; not bad by any means but nothing out of the ordinary. Good sweet, sugary pine but soft. Not overbearing. Taste is really nice but not as bracingly hoppy as the label states. In fact it is softer than I could've imagined but that could be due to freshness. The bitterness hits the side of the tongue for a moment but then leaves quickly. Not much sting afterward. There is a nice balance to this beer between malt and hop but I'd love more intense hop. Still good though. Mouthfeel is great. Fairly viscous but with good carbonation and makes me want another taste. I dunno how many of these I could drink as the alcohol is present and the mouthfeel, while great, could get taxing.

287,17112,Schnapsidee,4.65,"I am going to start this review by saying this beer is awesome. I have already burned through a 6 pack of this recently and just got another one as a trade extra (thanks DannyKelly) and decided to get around to reviewing it. Pours a golden yellow with amazing clarity and a crisp white head. My FW pint glass is happy to contain it. Head recedes after a few minutes into a ring that leaves mild lacing on the sides of the glass. This beer smells incredible, citrus fruits, pineapple are up front and do a great job representing the hops with a mild hop sweetness coming though at the end of each whif. Upon tasting this beer i expected it to be boozy for how light it is but instead you get a blast of hop flavor and a much needed malty backbone to hold the beer together, completely masking the alcohol. This beer is light and crisp, something you don't see with many Double IPA's. Where this beer lacks hop bitterness (what can i say i'm a Portland hophead) it makes up for in hip aroma and profile. I could drink this beer all day.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",Imperial IPA,98
287,17112,CooperEllis,4.35,"This was had in a side-by-side today w/ Pliny the Elder. Hopslam bottled 1/4/11 Pliny bottled 12/28/10  So this is as close as I'm going to get for freshness purposes. Just the Hopslam review is here and the Pliny review was from a different tasting. Hopslam was tasted and reviewed before trying the Pliny today.  Thanks to Sonoma01 and heyesez for the chance to do this!  Out of the bottle, very light amber. Feathering out to almost sunlight when the glass is tipped. Minimal head, quickly gone leaving a nice layer of lacing.  The aroma is more mild than I was expecting. But it is there, if faintly, and this is a bit of ruby red grapfruit. There are scant floral notes and a little malt as well.  There is a very strong booze note right up front. Damn, that is a bit strong. This is also a very dry finishing double. So much of this flavor is masked by the booze initially, but the follow-up is citrus pith, a lot of light floral and a bit of bitter. EDIT: after reading the batch description at Bell's I will attest to not tasting honey in this, but if that is what they're attributing to the overall balance, then it certainly did it's job.  Exceptionally light on the palate, well carbed, and a touch of bitter finish that is still crisp.  The upfront booze alerts you to the alcohol, but my goodness this is a easy easy brew to drink.

287,17112,websherpa,4.6,"Thanks ChadQuest for the bottles.  So I had Pliny earlier this week and I have to say these beers are very similar. They had the same grapefruit/pineapple hop profile. They both made a beer with few or no flaws. Both drink incredibly clean, and are quite refreshing despite their size.  Hopslam differs in that it is slightly more sweet and sticky no doubt from the honey. It also finishes a little quieter, which is a little disappointing.

287,17112,Miketwolf21,3.7,"This beer pours a nice golden color and a generous head was exposed for such a high gravity beer. The honey comes right through with the sweetness that perfectly blends with probably the most grapefruity hop profile of them all. There is also some nice freshly cut rose notes to it. The aroma reminds that this is for hop heads, but in my opinion its more of a gateway drug for them. Its easy to drink due to the sweetness and only medium body which is due to the use of honey. The taste is as expected. I wish there was a little more going on with the hop, malt interaction. Its too well calculated. The alcohol blends perfectly with the hop profile making it indistinguishable at a casual taste. The flavor of grapefruit and well hops are accented by a taste of lemon vodka. But the citrus fruits steal the show and the game is over. The finish is somewhat clean for the level of IBUs. There is some lasting bitterness that is a little unpolished. The sweetness and the hops are too much to have more than a couple. The mouthfeel is nice though. I like beer that is more multidimensional.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",Imperial IPA,98

Citrusy, piney goodness, with a touch of bitterness on the back end. First sip almost knocked me over. Strong floral hops that are quickly followed by a wave of intense bitterness. There's a nice sweetness lingering there behind the hops that makes the slam a bit more gentle. The impressive thing about this beer is the variety of hop flavors that come through. Though I suspect, based on others' descriptions, that it would be even more intense if it were fresher. Mouthfeel is a bit tingly, fairly light, but lingers in the mouth. This is a very intense, very hoppy DIPA.

The beer pours a orange color with a massive white head, 3-4 fingers worth. Hops up front, followed by a rush of citrus, and pine, prefect balance of the two. I expected this beer to be overwhelming with alcohol content but it wasn't even noticed even towards the bottom of the glass. Upset I haven't picked up more, I would have purchased a case at least.

Moderate to slow pour resulted in a half inch of bright white head that went to film pretty quickly. Good head retention as in swirling got a full finger that had more staying power. Little to no carbonation shown in this at all.  S-- Honey, fresh pine, ripe grapefruit. I got no smell of ABV in this at all.  T-- Massive hop punch right off the bat. Fresh pine, fresh grapefruit, and orange. Small amount of Carmel and some touches of honey.  M-- Very smooth after the taste. Hops do drop off some. Middle of palate is soft and honey. Finish is a big kick of grapefruit. Is a touch too sweet at times but also at times very crisp and clean. Honey is very apparent in the mouth. Big body and big feel.  D-- ABV is very apparent in the drinking. A slow sipper. Unique due to using honey but makes this stand out over other DIPA's due to that. Would be interested to see how this is without the honey.

When it first hits your tongue, you feel the hoppy bite, but then when it goes down, a smoothness transforms it in such a fashion like nothing else I've ever tasted. It's a treat and highlight to the beer year when it arrives at the local stores in town. But be careful - the ease at the finish is where you can mess yourself up.

Citrus hops dominate the initial taste and merge into a sweetness that seems to reflect the use of honey in the recipe. A pleasant, astringent hop bitterness shows on the finish and subsides into a lingering sweetness.  Juicy, round mouthfeel with a body that seems light for the alchohol content.

287,17112,ThreeWiseMen,4.05,"Got three bottles of this in a recent trade with hopsleeroy. Thanks Lee! Batch 10127 - bottled January 11, 2011.  Poured into a Cigar City snifter.  Appearance: A fine, white crown sits atop a crystal clear, pale orange-gold body. Head never amounts to more than a wispy cap, even when swirled vigorously. Head retains as a thin halo and drags moderate, web-like lacing.  Smell: Grapefruit, lemon, pine resin, honey, and even hints of bubblegum arise early on. As it warms I get lime, more honey and bubblegum, and mild alcohol. Fresh, hoppy, and unique. Solid.  Taste: Grapefruit, lemon-lime, and honey loom large. Floral hop esters, pine, and earth emerge in the finish and form a bitter, long-lasting aftertaste. Alcohol peeks through a bit, but melds pretty well with the hop flavors and honey. I still get some bubblegum - not sure what causing that/what I'm mistaking that for.  Mouthfeel: Medium-to-light in body, sweet, and prickly, with a touch of warmth and dryness. Hop resins cling to the palate and create a deep, lingering, bitter aftertaste.  Drinkability: I'd prefer something more fruitier and drier myself, but this made for a very nice sipper.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",Imperial IPA,98
287,17112,axeman9182,4.74,"12oz bottle, batch #10127 (meaning it was bottled on January 11th), and it was poured into my Duvel tulip.  The beer pours a just short of translucent tangerine in my glass. The foamy white crown rises to about three fingers in height. It quickly reduces in size by about a third before settling in and just sitting there. While the head retention is more than solid, lacing is a bit spotty. There's an incredibly pungent and perfumey aroma wafting up from the glass. A faint suggestion of honey is almost drowned out by the massive hop notes bombarding my nose. Waves of grapefruit, pineapple, mango, orange, and even a little peach crash over my olfactory sense. The flavor runs along similar lines, and is outstanding, but lacks a little bit of the oomph that the aroma has. The hop bitterness is fairly pronounced, but falls in line sandwiched between a beguilingly subtle, yet flavorful sweetness, and the array of powerful hop flavors. The mouthfeel is spot on, just enough heft in the body to support the massive hops, without getting in the way. At the same time the carbonation is active enough to really get the tropical hop flavors bursting on my palate, without giving too much of a bubbly sensation. There's not even a hint of alcohol, and it's absolutely mind boggling that a 10%, hopped out of its mind DIPA can be this easy to drink. A phenomenal beer from Bell's, and one of a very few that I would readily buy a whole case of at any time.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",Imperial IPA,98

Color is much more pale than one might expect from such a big beer.  S: I don't identify myself as a hophead, but this beer might convert me. The bouquet of hops and honey perfume into the nostrils. The hops are most exclusively citric. lots of pineapple and lemon. sort of smells like a freshly opened can of Del Monte Fruit Salad.  T: Hopslam lives up to its name for sure, but its not so over the top that it makes you pucker. This beer rides the threshold of taste and overbearing hop bitterness perfectly.  M: Slick, oily, but well carbonated. A little sticky, but a decent dry finish from the alcohol. Hop bitterness keeps you wanting to raise the glass as well.

The beer pours a medium orange in color with a nice fluffy white head. The smell is very intense and is of mostly citrusy hops. This is by far one of the most robust, quality smelling beers I've had of this style. The taste is definately hop forward, but the honey balanced it out nicely.

Smell: All I can say is, WOW!! A very unmistakable aroma. A very full, rich bouquet of hops, hops, and more hops, complemented by citrus and honey. I'm a real hop-head and this has an unmistakable aroma unlike any other beer in this family.  Taste: The perfect balance between bitter and sweet, the malt is just enough to balance out the hops. Finishes well with the honey which does a good job of balancing the overall citrus hoppy flavor. Again, a very unique, unmistakable taste.  Mouthfeel: Medium carbonation with a taste that lingers. The aftertaste mutes the drink quite well, due to the honey. It's not fruity at all, just hops and a smooth undertone which makes it quite drinkable  Drink: Smooth. Ultra-Smooth. If you're not careful you'll find yourself having put away a six-pack before you know it.  Conclusion: This is one beer that would not fail the blindfold test for either taste or smell.

287,17112,ms11781,3.88,"Thanks to sburrough. Batch #10127, bottled on January 11, 2011. Reviewed on 02/08/2011. 12oz bottle poured into a tulip glass.  Pours a clear, bright orange color. A stronger pour leaves a huge 3+finger head that quickly ends up as a decent sized white cap. Good foamy lacing left on the glass.  The nose reveals huge hop aromas right off the bat but they don't stick around long. Orange, grapefruit and other citrus aromas are very prominent for the short time that they appear but they are quickly overtaken by a very sweet, honey-like characteristic.  Taste is pretty much in line with the nose. Citrus hops lead the way again. Orange, pineapple, grapefruit and some other tropical fruits are present. A huge sweetness comes in and doesn't just balance out the hops but seems to completely take over at times. Definitely a sweetness from the honey rather than a malt characteristic. There are some piny hops at the finish along with some bitterness.  Medium/thick body with medium carbonation makes the beer feel slick on the tongue. Surprisingly smooth finish considering the amount of hops and bitterness in the taste.  Drinkability is good. Very sneaky at 10% ABV. There really is no hint of the alcohol at all, which is also surprising. At times the honey sweetness can be a bit much and even seem to outweigh the hops. Perhaps this wasn't as fresh as possible but should still be a good sample with it being bottled less than a month before consumption.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",Imperial IPA,98

At 10% alcohol this went down super easy. One of the smoothest and best IPA's I've had.,Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",Imperial IPA,98
287,17112,Bdc17,4.97,Poured into a Chimay goblet.  A: Amber color with a small head that goes away quickly.  S: Citrus hops and a hint of honey. Very strong smell overall.  T: The hops hit you right away. Finishes well with the honey which does a good job of balancing the overall citrus hoppy flavor.  M: Medium carbonation with the taste lingering for a while.  D: Dangerously high for a 10% beer. This goes down too easy.  Overall: An all-time favorite of mine. I'm very happy to be in an area they distribute to.  Serving type: Bottle.,Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",Imperial IPA,98
287,17112,knm,3.92,"This had a white head that left quickly, not many bubbles hung around. A very light colored IPA with minimal cloudiness. Smells very smooth for a name like Hopslam. The sour is there, but almost as fruity in smell. The taste is different though...only hops in the initial sip. The aftertaste tones down the drink perfectly, must be the honey. Its not fruity in taste at all, just hops and a smooth undertone which makes it quite drinkable. Just read the bottle cuz I was starting to realize it was high - at 10%ABV (holy crap) this is an amazingly smooth beer!",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",Imperial IPA,98
287,17112,carolinabeerguy,4.8,"2/17/11 (Draft) 5/5/5/4.5/5: Poured on tap into a Guinness pint glass at Ice House Pub in Punta Gorda, Florida on 2/17/11.  Appearance: Pours a clear light golden amber with orange highlights and a 2-3 finger frothy white head. Excellent head retention and lacing.  Smell: The most amazing bouquet of hops I’ve ever smelled. Grapefruit, orange, pineapple and pine all mixed perfectly with just a touch of honey. Simply amazing.  Taste: The perfect balance between bitter and sweet, the malt is just enough to balance out the hops. The hops run the gamut from floral to bitter and sweet citrus. There’s a nice bitterness to the aftertaste that lingers for what seems like forever. This is the nectar of the gods.  Mouthfeel: Medium-to-full-bodied with just the right amount of carbonation. Goes down very smooth.  Drinkability: Excellent drinkability. The alcohol doesn’t come through in the flavor at all. This is scarily drinkable.  Overall: There’s no better beer out there that I’ve tried (yet). I thought nothing would top Hopslam in the bottle, but this did it. If you see Hopslam on draft, buy a pint - at least one. This beer was as close to perfect as I can imagine any beer being.  1/23/11 (Bottle) 4.5/5/5/4.5/5:  2011 Edition  Poured from a 12 ounce bottle into a Duvel tulip. Batch code 10127 indicates bottling date of January 11, 2011.  Appearance: Pours a clear light golden amber with orange highlights and a perfect 2 finger creamy and foamy white head. Excellent head retention and lacing.  Smell: Perfect fruity aroma featuring orange, grapefruit and pineapple mixed with floral hops and pine. Hops are abundant. This has the best aroma of any beer I’ve ever smelled.  Taste: Excellent balance between bitter and sweet. There is just enough malt background to even out this hoppy concoction. The hop profile ranges from floral to sweet citrus to bitter citrus. Sweet citrus with a little caramel malt up front followed by a hint of pepper and pink grapefruit in the middle followed lemon zest at the finish. Aftertaste is quite bitter in a great way.  Mouthfeel: Medium-to-full-bodied with just the right amount of carbonation. Goes down very smooth.  Drinkability: Excellent drinkability. The alcohol is masked extremely well for a beer with 10% ABV. The only detractor is the price. I paid $19.99 plus tax for a 6 pack at Total Wine.  Overall: About as perfect a DIPA as you’ll ever find. There is nothing to complain about here (aside from the price). I really wish Bell’s would make this a year-round release and drop the price a bit. If they did, this would be my go to beer without a doubt. If you see it, buy it. Don’t let the sticker shock stop you from trying the perfection that is Hopslam.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",Imperial IPA,98
287,17112,brendan13,3.7,"A - Poured into a goblet a slightly hazy orange with a 3cm head that suprisingly falls away fairly quickly. Bit of lacing left behind. S - Big grapefruit citrus & piney hop character dominates with some spicy and earthy notes. Alcohol starts to come through as it warms. T - Hops also quite dominate in the taste with a bit of sweetness coming through. Couldn't really get a lot of honey. Also quite boozy in the taste. M - Medium bodied, medium to low carbonation. Even though there is a bit of sweetness in the taste it is never cloying and finishes quite dry. D - Got this in a BIF and I'm very happy I got to try this highly rated DIPA. It's a bit too boozy for my liking however.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",Imperial IPA,98
287,17112,RTJakarta,4.92,"From a bottle.  Pours a rich, beautiful amber with a good head.  The smell is so strong it's like the best possible punch to the nose. Strong hop and citrus. From the smell alone, I would expect a VERY strong taste from this.  Except, not at all. Yes, you get a good, solid taste from it. A nice citrus and hop bitterness, but the taste is WAY more balanced than you would think. Which to me, is a good thing. If the taste was as strong as the aroma, it would tough to drink a lot of this. Also, you would NEVER guess this is 10% ABV.  Mouthfeel is just a nice, medium carbonation to me.  Drinkability you would think would be iffy at 10% abv, but it masks it SO well. Before you know it, you'll be feeling it. A top flight beer. Revisiting this, it's tough to decide if this is my favorite IPA or not besides the great Ruination. Either way, absolutely would recommend this to any hop fanatic. A great beer!",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",Imperial IPA,98
287,17112,afksports,4.55,"I've been lucky and gotten hopslam through a couple different trades. This Imperial IPA from Bell's brewery is just freakin' fantastic. I poured some, took a pic, then came on to review it before I forget Mr. Hopslam's glory.  The appearance is a bright amber, clear as day with an amazing and robust head. Those bubbles smell grand. Totally citrus, sweet, aromatic for sure. The taste is hop-malt-hop. The first hops are sweet, followed by a truly well-built malt characteristic that has everything from honey to toffee in it, and ended with a lovely piney and grapefruit bite in the back of the palate.  Hopslam is full of hops, and it's medium-bodied is full of alcohol too. 10% alcohol by volume? Seriously? Those malts make this baby REALLY easy to drink.  2 for 1... Just remember... 2 beers = 1 hopslam. 2 for 1...  It's funny. Hopslam is receiving a really high rating here from me, and when I had it side by side with Abrasive from Surly, Abrasive carried the day. But on its own, Hopslam has some wonderfully subtle characteristics. I highly recommend you get some while it's still fresh.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",Imperial IPA,98
287,17112,amccormi,4.19,"Thanks to my man Mark for giving me a second to try, much obliged.  Poured from a bottle to pint glass releasing 1 inch of white head which sank to a very thin but persistent layer. Very light amber somewhere between gold and orange color with a suprising level of clarity for such a hopped up beer.  The aroma is very vibrant citrus, then a more herbal undertone.  Taste is fairly sweet upfront, but I was expecting it this time, so not as overpowering. Moves into a bit of fruityness, then finishes with a fiarly clean pithy citrus bitterness (Kumquats anyone?). The bitterness lingers, quite a while.  Mouth feel is average, possibly a tad thin, but nothing to really detract.  This is an incredibly drinkable beer for being 10%. Once I got used to the honey sweetness it really has a nice balance that I can see why people are fond of it.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",Imperial IPA,98
287,17112,Gmann,4.4,"Pours a slightly hazy golden color with some orange hues. The head is dense and fairly big, leaving some webby lacing on the glass.  The aroma has a beautiful grapefruit hop scent. Some light tropical notes and pepper round out the hop aroma. Some honey and light bready notes support the hop profile. The hops dominate the aroma.  The flavor is much more balanced than the aroma. The first flavor that hits is a tropical fruit hop flavor, some peppery, piney and grassy flavors as well. The hops are equally matched by a sweet, bready honey malt. The malt isn't too big where it feels thick and syrupy, it seems to be in perfect balance with the hop flavor. I would like to see a touch more citrusy hop flavor but you can't beat the balance.  The beer as a moderate to full body with soft carbonation that leads to a smooth feel. Some light asprin bitterness stings the tongue and it finishes with a touch of stickiness. Really nice balance in this beer. ABV no where near to be found.  A delightful DIPA, perfect balance and awfully drinkable.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",Imperial IPA,98
287,17112,oline73,4.51,"Poured from a bottle into a Chimay goblet.  Appearance: Pours a clear amber color with one finger of off white head which goes away just leaving a very small layer.  Smell: Sweet citrus hops dominate. I thought there would be more of a smell than there is.  Taste: Initially there is a strong citrus hop bitterness. Next I'm picking up quite a bit of malt sweetness and some honey, which complements the bitterness quite nicely. At the end there is still some bitterness and also some alcohol.  Mouthfeel: Medium body with delicate and smooth carbonation. There could have been a little bit more carbonation. The finish is dry.  Drinkability: I've had this several times and it's always wonderful. I'll definitely be having more in the future.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",Imperial IPA,98

A nice hop wallop on top of a good caramel malt backbone with some honey sweetness that helps to round out the flavors.  M.

Heavenly apricot and grapefruit, citris hop aroma floods my nostrils. Sweet, sour, spicy and intensly seductive. I almost don't want to drink it, the smell is that good.  Hops are unrelenting from the get go with apricot, grapefruit and pine bitterness that leaves me speechless. Fruity, nectar-like sweetness creeps in mid-drink and blends perfectly with the hops. Alcohol lies in the background with an almost indetectable spicy tone. Finishes with a dry, bitter and satisfying aftertaste which lasts forever.  Medium to slightly full consistency. Drying on the palate. Sticky on the lips.  All I have to say is, WOW!!! This is a true masterpiece in brewing. It felt like a sin to drink something so perfect.

The smell of this particular brew is one Of lemony hops with honey mixed into them it is extremely pleasant on the nose. The taste of this one Is a SLAM of hops on the mouth followed by a slight cool down period of honey flavor followed by another one two punch of hops to the mouth. The taste then fades off to a nice piney flavor. The mouth feel of this one is extremely crisp with some nice bubbles tickling the palate. This one is extremely pleasurable and I could see myself drinking a pool of this beautiful honey liquid.

287,17112,camel92,4.57,"Pours out a hazy golden color. A half finger head emerges from the liquid that is white in color. Texture is frothy and settles to a very thin foam and mostly a ring around the glass. Held to the light it is a very bright golden color yet still hazy. Some foam is left on the sides of the wall but the lacing isn't thick by any standards.  As expected it is very hoppy. Nice herbal hop aroma springs right up the nose. There is also some nice citrus notes that comes though as well. It isn't dominated one way or another for which hop aroma stands out more.  Same as the smell. Huge hop presence in this one. For the taste it is bit more herbal hop. A bit of citrus flavor comes out as the beer is swallowed and this is followed up by some alcohol. There really isn't any malt taste to this to balance this and that is just fine with me. I love IPAs and DIPAs that are very hop forward. As expected there is a hop bitterness that lingers in the mouth after the beer is swallowed.  Medium bodied that is a bit toward the heavier side but it isn't as syrupy as some other DIPAs that I've had before. I really like this. Carbonation is pretty low. Even though there is some alcohol present in the taste, it really doesn't detract from the experience at all.  Well this is a pretty damn drinkable beer. I really enjoyed it being a hop forward beer and am really glad I got to try it again (I had it two years ago or so and don't remember it at all). Is it worth all the hype?

With over an inch of sticky head that has a remarkable amount of lacing, the head on this one shows no signs of going away.  S-WOW! This one smells like a hop bomb, has a good smell of citrus nodes, maybe a tad of lemon, and a good amount of honey to boot.  T-Hits you in the mouth with an extreme hop flavor, citrus flavors come towards the end, and has a honey flavor at the end.  M- This beer by far has the best mouthfeel of any beer I have ever had. It starts out with the bitter hop blast that makes your mouth feel tangy, then goes smooth at the end with the honey flavor. Extremely crisp at the end, surprisingly light and one of the most well balanced beers I have ever had.  D- the drinkability on this beer is second to none and at 10% ABV this one is scary because it will sneak up on you and leave you passed out on the floor in a hurry.

However, I definitely taste notes of (obviously) alcohol and (not so obviously) apple. Good spicey pepper notes as well. Definitely top notch.

Took more time and effort to be in the right place at the right time for this one than I would have liked.  A - Beautiful golden coloring, one-finger creamy head that sticks around for a while.  S - Tons of light citrus and acidity. Backend is largely sweet malt grains and light floral notes.  T - Great malt/hop balance on the frontend, getting a lot more floral notes than even the smell let on. Hops kick in more in the mid and backends. Vast amount of honey and malt sweetness from front to back. I can imagine this being overly-sweet for a DIPA fan looking for more hop kick, but my Midwestern palate buys what Bell's is selling here.  M - Appropriate crispness that improves through the drink. Medium body, some smoothness.  D - Gotta give it props for no trace of alcohol despite that abv. Worthy of the hype? I'm not quite sure. Kind of wishing I had this opportunity earlier and closer to its release last month, because I definitely feel that the hoppiness was more reserved than I expected. Still enjoyed the balance though.  Edit - another year = another release, and this time I was able to crack a much fresher 12 oz. with my friend in Lincoln Park. This is very solid within the first month of bottling and I am satisfied.  Edit #2 - 2013 not as kind for this. Three separate on-tap experiences of this year's release all left me underwhelmed.

287,17112,micromaniac129,4.24,Pours a honey orange color. Clear with low carbonation. A vigorous pour produced about a fingers worth of foamy head which in turn receeds quickly to surface film inside a foam ring. Good lacing. Hops are definitely the main event here with aromas of pineapple. Citus hops follow. This is the best part of the beer. The taste is balanced nicely with a solid malt backbone. Sweet malts and honey make for a very sweet tasting beer which you'll need for this is guite a bitter bite. Hops have a taste of citrus and floral but there not very aggressive. This is a bitter beer with the flavor of the hops being in a secondary roll. With everything going on with this beer it presents itself as being thin and even watery. I would expect a fuller beer. Finishs dry and bitter with the bitterness lingering well into the aftertaste. A big bold beer with a big bold alcohol presence that would limit the amount one could drink at any one sitting. I like hop flavor more then the just hop bitterness so personally I would like to see the flavor raised a bit to complement the bitterness and sweet malts.

287,17112,kraken6100,4.64,"So here's the deal. I had 2011 fresh, and I also had it 4 weeks later. SO BAD, SO PEDESTRIAN. WHO DOES THAT.  A: Analogous more to a goldenrod than amber or strictly golden. Beautiful head, roughly 1.5 finger in a 25cl Boulevard tulip.  S: Honestly, the part that REALLY excites. The sweetness (the alluded to honey) is there, and certainly doesn't disappoint. A faint piney, northwest hoppiness, but goodness... so much sweetness in the aroma NOT from the malt or a sugary-ness. It WANTS you to drink it. I wasn't going to say no.  T: Immediate sweet citrus, met with the expected piney hoppiness. For a DIPA, I'm certain you could be intimidated by others, but this is very inviting. You don't know upon initial taste that the abv exceeds 10%. You really don't.  M: A faint bit of cloying in the hind quarters of my tongue, but stimulating sweetness as we work from fore-to-rear. The cloying isn't a disqualifier by any means. Wonderful balance of sweetness and hoppiness. Didn't wait/age long enough to see if that maltiness came to the fore. I hate to say that this beer lived up to the hype, but it did. It absolutely, unequivocally did.  D: For what it's worth, I've heard the 5L kegs don't last too long, nor do the 6pks, but the ABV should give it a bit of time, and if you can find it, you absolutely should buy it. It isn't going to be the super hophead dream beer, but by golly, the flavor and dichotomy of sweet and hoppy is prevalent, and just such a wonderful purchase. 10.5abv seems like a total cocktease.

Pours a slightly cloudy deep golden amber color with a thinnish white head that dissipates too quickly. Smells of pine resin and citrus up front. Hints of sweet fruit, grass and honey lie deep underneath the resinous onslaught. Taste is sweeter than the aroma leads you to believe. There's a solid malt backbone here with a sweet honey taste that drives this brew. Pine, citrus and tropical fruits add to a spicy/herbal taste in the fairy sweet finish. Medium body and carbonation level, sweet less than syrupy mouthfeel. I've sampled a couple of IPA's tonight and this one is the sweetest. Very flavorful, very tasty, Matt should get me some more.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",Imperial IPA,98
287,17112,NittanyBeerFan,4.29,"Poured into an oversized wine glass at Silhouettes in Media. Got the next to last pours before the kegs kicked.  The body is a crystal clear light straw amber color, capped by a typical DIPA head...thick and sticky, leaving solid lacing all over the glass at every swirl, sip or movement. Not that it doesn't look inviting, it just doesn't outdo every other imperial IPA that I've tried.  The nose is absolutely phenomenal. Easily the best part of the beer, in my opinion. Grapefruit is the first aroma, and then come pineapple, stone fruits, and orange and lemon zest. A slight bittering quality to it as well, but mainly just full of fruity hops. The flavor is again full of tropical fruits. All of the same come through and in full force. Even when a little cooler than room temperature, there are warm notes of ethanol that come through. No malts to speak of, and a nice flavor enhancement from the honey that was used. Not cloying or sweet. This must have been stored well, because it doesn't seem to have faded at all.  Slightly thinner than many of my favorite imperial IPAs, the carbonation is well balanced with the consistency of the brew. A phenomenally enjoyable, drinkable, and misleadingly high in alcohol beer. Approach this one carefully, as the 10% will definitely sneak up on you. Definitely one of the best Jan-Feb seasonals that are widely available, I will be seeking it out again, though it doesn't sit in my top 5 ever.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",Imperial IPA,98
287,17112,pmlondrigan,3.71,"Major thanks to given2flybrewing for these. Poured into an mason jar with a wide mouth and it looks good. Puffy white head that clings onto the glass adrift on a light honey golden liquid. The aroma is where my journey to slight disappointment begins. Yes there are nice tropical fruit notes, mango, pinapple, and citrus along with light pine...but it is not so pungent and less then wowing. I also find the flavor to be muted. The components are there, nice honey note accents well citrus, tropical fruit and zesty earth tones the hops bring to the beer. Mouthfeel is not cloying and easy sipping for such a large beer, possibly the biggest success of the beer. So I am willing to admit that perhaps I didn't get the freshest bottle of hopslam, but until I taste it fresher I am underwhelmed and believe this beer is overhyped.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",Imperial IPA,98

S: Sweet and pungent fruit, Pineapple Mango and Peach almost remind me of del monte fruit cocktail. Citrusy hops whisper between the honey sweetness  T: wow! I am impressed. The honey notes pull all of the fruit components together. There is a very definitive hop presence not bitter but very botanical and citrusy... I am impressed! Coming from a SD hophead thats saying something. Honeyed and carmel malts play a good background roll giving a flavor that harmonizes but never over steps the hops  M: Light on the palate, though there is a honey sweetness it is neither cloying nor thick... there is a very dry quality in this which is a must for a good IPA. I had to do a double take on the 10%abv...  D: Too drinkable... I could down another 5 of these in a heartbeat  Bell's, You have restored my faith...

Aroma is hop dominated (really??) - to me, the citrus notes seem to lean more toward orange than grapefruit. Tons of pineapple and other tropical fruits. There's also a little pine in there. A hint of sweetness is detected.  Taste is hoppy-deliciousness. The citrus rind hop flavor is immediately noticeable, followed by touches of pine. There is a little sweetness that briefly offsets the powerful hop bite on the finish.  Being 10% abv, its not as heavy as I was expecting. Medium-bodied, and not as oily as some other IIPA's I've tried.

287,17112,veinless,4.57,"Shoutout to my main man Buddha22 for this, got it in a trade with him. Poured a cloudy, semitransparent golden amber, with plenty of foamy, pure white head that laced very well and retained not as well. Left a perfect swirl in the middle of the beer that was gorgeous...that was probably dumb luck, but it was still kind of cool.  Aroma was what I was expecting and then some. Started with lots and lots of citrus and tropical fruit, before moving to caramel and brown sugar. Probably the stickiest aroma in a beer I've ever had the pleasure of smelling.  Taste followed suit, with a tropical hop bomb to wake you up. Pineapple and mango dominate, before giving way to that sticky-sweet caramel/brown sugar malt. Honey also rears its head quite slyly right about here. The malt sweetens the fruit flavors and, combined, are dangerously close to becoming candy like - and then the hops save the day, offering up a soft, yet strong, bitterness that perfectly balances the beer. Clean and herbal, the hops finally give in to a slightly sticky finish that leaves you smacking your lips. A tiny bit of booze caps it all off. I like a clean and dry finish as much as the next guy, but this sweet finish is just so good.  Drinkability is EXCEPTIONAL for the 10% abv, as you don't even notice it until the end, when it is simply a welcome taste and feeling. This beer balances itself out, and although you may not be able to taste anything else for while, this on its own goes down as easy as just about any beer out there, regardless of style.

The hops hit you up front then the it mellows in the middle where you the some of the honey flavor. The finish is slightly dry and lightly bitter with some honey sweetness lingering.

D: I feel like I could sit down and drink a 6-pack in an hour as if I was drinking a light beer.  I was really skeptical that I would like this beer that much.

The taste followed the nose straight off. Good stuff. A little sweet for the my taste but there a definitely a ton of hops here, but it's not bitter. The honey, however, is a little distracting. If this is what Bell's wants to do to set itself apart, that's cool. But I'm wondering what their DIPA recipe would produce without the honey?  Medium to full bodied for a DIPA. Good carbonation.

287,17112,stakem,4.15,"Review from notes taken on 1/27/11. On tap at Al's of Hampden.  Served in a stemmed tulip glass, this brew appears a clear golden color of copper. A thin whisp of white film lays across the top of the brew which is all it has to offer reminiscent of a head. Swirls release some bubbles and create patches of leggy lace.  The aroma of this brew has a bold presence of hoppy goodness that is readily apparent before you even bring the glass to your face. It includes an aroma of pine, citrus, floral notes, rinds, pineapple and overall sweet indications with a light alcohol tingle to the back of the nose.  The taste is rind-like tasting like bitter orange filled with herbal spiciness. Grass is evident along with a mild toasty malt backing. A solid astringent and solvent alcohol character runs through the body and into the finish which for the most part includes clingy bitter oils.  This is a medium bodied offering with a light amount of carbonation. Big abv warmth and taste yet balanced and very enjoyable and drinkable. The honey aspect to this brew gives my sense of taste mixed signals. There seems to be a sweetness about this brew mid palate that turns sharp and dry into the finish.

Thanks a million to awesome trader Brian44556 for this awesomeness!!!  Pours a beautiful golden amber, with only the slightest haze to it...Very nicely carbonated, just this side of medium carbonation. Head is short and soapy, and leaves a nice, yet sparse, lacing.  Aromas are very robust - lots of floral hop notes. I also get some overripe pineapple in there, along with some hints of maple and also Humboldt Green, but the latter is fleeting. A little mango in there too. Very wonderful and fresh smelling.  Flavor is off the charts. It's ultra robust. I almost don't know where to start with this. So much is going on, and all in unison, that it's hard to tell the parts apart. The initial burst is a very forward bitterness that is likely hop induced. Very few beers get this hoppy right upfront. This gives way to the nice carbonation that kind of washes the burst of bitterness away. The middle resounds with a plethora of different flavors: I get mango, pineapple, a sweetness induced by the honey, and some more hops, but in the back. What seems to be lacking is a big malt component. This beer rounds out with a slightly off bitterness and carries a very long time. This is exceptionally good beer, and very challenging for the palate. It's 10% ABV and I assume it's expensive. This beer is awesome and absolutely worth tracking down.  What I like most: The wonderful cavalcade of flavors in the complex profile.  What I like least: The slightly off bitterness in the finish and the lack of a complelmentary malt component.  Verdict: With only minor flaws, this is truly a wonderful and near-elitle ale worth tracking down.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",Imperial IPA,98

T: The bitterness with the rather distinct taste of grapefruit that is just straight up awesome. Only a hint of alcohol comes through. The bitterness is just the right amount without too being overpowering.  M: Medium body with a perfect amount of carbonation for the style.

287,17112,Jadjunk,4.59,"#88. Really couldn't wait until the big 100 to try this beer as I bought it a few weeks ago when it was distributed into the area. It's sold out already; does that drop any hints on the reputation this beer has? I've had a couple in the past in bottle and on tap; this one has been set aside for a professional review which I plan to write as critically as possible.  Poured from a 12 oz. bottle to a glass at room temp.  (Appearance) Beer pours a frothy, creamy two finger depth off- white color head. Retention is decent and the coating dissipates evenly over a short time. Sticky airy lacing streaks the side as the head recedes, but unfortunately doesn't carry to the drink as well. The color is a brilliant gold with light peach tones and mostly clear but with a slight hint of haziness to the clarity. Carbonation is surprisingly low, but still congregates in clusters in random areas. While the head quality wasn't outstanding, most other things about this beer were of top quality. A very satisfying treat to the eye. 4  (Smell) One of the greatest things about the smell is the incredibly potent aroma of grapefruit and citrusy, floral hops that I can gather from a good foot away from the glass. It is a very strong clean aroma of perfectly blended hops, honey and grapefruit that makes this beer smell classically delicious, for a lack of better words. The malt is also right underneath, subtle but enough to round out the bitterness with sweet and fruity tones to create a nose with ideal balance and quality. The smell is one of upmost perfection; I wouldn't begin to consider changing a thing about it. 5  (Taste) A very light burst of grapefruit flavor with a calm pairing of fresh, lightly bitter hops. The brew tastes very clean but the character is bold enough to not need any additional supplement. This is one beer that can carry through the flavor suggested by the nose, and I am especially pleased to note that this is the best presentation of fresh grapefruits in any beer I have ever had. It is brilliantly pronounced and integral to this beer's balance and complexity. As for the Hopslam's stars, the hops get to kick in full time at the finish, bringing one refreshingly pleasant bitter crisp finale. Alcohol peeks in once or twice throughout the drink and can likely be toned down, but the taste otherwise is the ideal balance of sweet and bitter that I am looking for in any IPA. Glorious. 4.5  (Mouthfeel) Crisp intro with a nice light smooth body and slightly dry, crisp finish. The alcohol presence comes in at places and makes the beer slightly ""spicier"" than it should be, but otherwise, this beer does a good job in the mouthfeel. 4.5  (Drinkability) It's really a shame that this is a January only release, as I'm always craving these wonderful seasonal brews in times like July or August when they're going to be long gone. The flavor is wonderfully balanced and the intensity is hardly draining on the palate, but that high ABV of 10% is going to make me certain that I should only have a couple of these to avoid sleeping ugly. Price is slightly deterring, but if you're dedicated enough to good beer versus average stuff, this is going to be worth every penny you're got. I'll be savoring my remaining 3 bottles and opening them on good days. Yes, the drinkability is quite high. There's no reason whatsoever to avoid this. 4.5  Verdict: So I'm determined that this may just well be the best damn beer I've reviewed thus far and I'll probably be getting a sixer of these every January for the rest of my days on earth. A wonderfully charismatic and exciting beer. Does well in nearly all respects. If I have to pick one bad thing out it is the ABV which is fine at high levels but isn't ""ideally"" concealed and still peeks through at times, most notably in the mouthfeel. Just wonderful, but you need to drink it when it's fresh to enjoy it best. This is one of those beers that doesn't age very well, so drink 'em while you've got 'em! And enjoy... you're one lucky bastard to have this worthy beer in your hand! A (4.5)",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",Imperial IPA,98
287,17112,mellowmark,4.72,"Poured from a 12 oz. brown bottle to an Oversized Wine glass. Batch number 10100, according to Bell's Batch Finder it was packaged on 1-5-11. $16.99 for a 6-pack.  Appearance: 2-finger off-white foamy head. Uniform lacing all around and down the glass for as long as the head will last. Not as much head retention as in Two Hearted, but that is most likely due to the higher ABV. Orange golden color. Beer is mostly transparent with just a slight haze. Great head regeneration.  Smell: You can smell this thing from several feet away. Strong honey aroma backed by a huge citrus hop presence. Extremely ripe tropical fruits. Unbelievably floral. The nose almost seems artificial, like a really good artificially flavored tropical fruit drink or candy. How they achieve this aroma naturally is absolutely beyond me. It's right up there with the best smelling beers in existence, if not the best. You just keep wanting to come back for more.  Taste: Huge sweetness up front with a citrus hop presence throughout, earthly hop bitterness towards the end. Surprisingly the hops don't linger very long after each sip. The prominent yet not cloying honey sweetness does wonders for keeping the whole thing balanced and really works at bringing out and accentuating the hop flavor.  Mouthfeel: Mouthfeel is full with medium carbonation. Juicy. Warming effect in the back of the throat and chest cavity after each sip.  Drinkability: Very High  Dangerously drinkable for it's high alcohol. I really tried to find some kind of flaw in this beer given all the hype around it, but I just couldn't find any.

287,17112,SkeeterHawk,4.17,"You know, I have had this beer for about 6 months now, and I can't for the life of me remember where I got it. I am thinking that it must have been from Knightly Spirits in Orlando, but I am not sure. Regardless, I know that I didn't pick it up here in Texas. Let's give it a go.  Appearance: Pours a pretty hazy orange golden color with a very small head of white bubbles that faded by the time I got done with the pour. There are numerous bubbles rising, but they don't maintain the head. The beer poured noticeably thick.  Aroma: Of course I get lots of hops with citrus being the most prominent giving grapefruit in particular, but there is still a solid amount of malt in this beer. Despite the hype written on the side of the bottle, there is actually some malt detectable.  Taste: The flavor is bold and bitter, but it isn't terribly far out of balance as the hype on the bottle. There is a solid malt backbone to this beer, and I am picking up some toasty notes and light crystal in particular. Though the hops are running this beer, it isn't dry and menacing on the palate to me, so they managed to keep the water in check as not to overly accentuate the hops as well. The beer itself is medium to slightly full bodied with ample carbonation.  Opinion: Well, I must say that I was pleasantly surprised by this beer. It is much more balanced than some of the brewery's ""Tribute to hops"" beers are. Mostly they are just stupidly hopped beer without regard to balance, but this beer is actually a good base to begin with and then they put a S**t load of hops in it. The result is very good. Even though I am a malt-head and don't drink hoppy beers much, I would definitely drink this beer again...and that is saying something. Give it a shot. If you like flavorful beer, this one won't disappoint you.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",Imperial IPA,98
287,17112,paulys55,4.54,"Finally got to try this one after hearing all the hype. Pours hazy orange with a nice two finger head. Aroma of sweet citrus, grapefruit, orange and honeysuckle. Nicely balanced leaning toward the sweeter, less floral side for me, definitely notice the honey. So easy to drink that the ABV makes this one quite dangerous for me. No alcohol until the very end and by the time I notice it I am taking another sip.

287,17112,surlytheduff,4.33,"The beer poured golden-honey, with two fingers of frothy foamy eggshell-white head. The foam clung tightly to the side of the glass, and after the head receded it left bubbly residue all over.  The aroma is piney sweet. There is some floral, citrusy notes but it isn't that intense. This may be due to the fact that it's a bit shy of a month old.  Taste is spectacular. The sweetness matches so well with the bitterness of the hops. There is a very slight alcohol flavor, but it is masked very well. The finish is bitter and refreshing.  The beer has a medium body, with a certain viscous element to it. It is well carbonated, and finishes dry. This is an incredibly drinkable double IPA.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",Imperial IPA,98

Aromas of, well, hops, but tropical fruit and honey as well. Tastes the same. Nice retention! The hoppiness really sticks around.  I'm a huge fan of the IPA's that don't have a huge malt profile, and this one tops them all. Excellent beer, and totally worth all of the hype.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",Imperial IPA,98

Slightly sweet under tones of citrus fruits, specifically grapefruit. Huge citrus hop flavor with a touch of maltyness. The finish is smooth, gradual and nothing like the handshake.  m: Slippery and viscous. The right amount of carbonation to pair with the blast of hops.

M - very creamy for a DIPA, turning to slightly oily in the middle and a nice lingering bitterness.  D - incredibly drinkable for the abv and the hoppiness; the malt backbone really counters the hops nicely to keep drinkability high.  One of my absolute favorites.

Very nice lacing along the glass that practically reads drink me.  S - I put the glass down for a quick second and the aromas started wafting throughout the room. The nose on this beer is in a word spectacular. Citrus aromas of all kinds bombard your nostrils. Grapefuit, pineapple, and tangerine up front. A dose of pine in there as well with a bit of honey aroma to boot. The smell of this brew alone is almost intoxicating.  T - Wow. Just plain amazing. I was expecting to be overwhelmed by hop bitterness but what I got was a perfect amount of hops up front followed by a wonderful tropical fruit sweetness. I think the honey might have something to do with it here as well. All the ingredients culminate for a very unique taste that I have never experienced before and don't think I ever will. A slight tinge of alcohol to remind you of the 10%.  M - Medium bodied with a spot on amount of carbonation. The creaminess coats your palate and never lets go.

287,17112,Brunite,5,"Preview: ""The Bell's Brewery batch number you searched '10115' is a Bell's Hopslam Ale and was packaged on January 11th, 2011."" The beer is a bit over 3 weeks old and was poured into a Duvel tulip glass.  Appearance: A gorgeous, clear, honey orange color with a nice off-white head. The foamy two inch head slowly collapses, etching the glass with permanent lace.  Smell: One word says it: Wow! This is the most amazingly and powerfully aromatic beer I have ever experienced. As soon as the bottle is opened, it starts. After it hits the glass....there is an aroma cloud that envelops a 2 ft area around the pour. The smell is incredible. Pineapple, mango, peach, honey, grapefruit, and pine. I could smell this all day.  Taste: The taste blows me away. A changing flavor profile throughout the experience is quite unique. The first taste is all pine and bitter. The next several sips highlight the honey and grapefruit. Then some malt. Each sip has flavors to savor. Flavors mellow and get more floral as it warms. Very complex.  Mouthfeel: Medium with a pleasant oily feeling left on the roof of the mouth from the hop resins.  Drinkability: Superb. You would never know this weighs in at 10% ABV. Each sip has me muttering things like ""ahhhh"", ""amazing"" and ""incredible"". Very few beers do that. Very few.  Overall: Despite all the hype....there is definitely a reason with this one. This has got to be my favorite beer...definitely in the top 2 no doubt. Bell's has done a great job here. If not for the ABV...I could drink these all day long. I was lucky enough to procure a case worth of these and will be spacing them out nicely over the next month or so. Even my wife (not a big beer fan) loved this one. Sadly, while I wish this was available year-round...at least there will be Bell's Two-Hearted Ale to fill in the gap.

287,17112,thetomG,4.5,"Mostly clear golden color with an impressive layer of bubbly foam head that leaves behind streaky, sticky lacing all around the glass.  Piney nose with some grapefruit and citrus undertones. Flavor is expectedly hoppy and bitter, but the bitterness is balanced out just enough by the malt backing and some subtle sweet fruit flavors that it doesn't detract much from the drinkability.  Mouthfeel is spot-on: an excellent blend of lively carbonation with just enough smoothness. The 10%ABV is remarkably well hidden, but nevertheless I wouldn't recommend tipping back too many of these in one sitting.  Unsurprisingly, hops are the clear & dominant aspect of this beer - they're the first thing you smell, first thing you taste, and last thing you notice as it finishes with a somewhat dry bitterness. If you're a hop lover you will not be disappointed. Delicious.  One of my all-time favorites and something I have no hesitation recommending to anyone. Phenomenal.

287,17112,eternaljester81,4.82,"New review from the 2011 batch:  When I tried Hopslam after its release last year, it was my first run with the legendary beer. I had only just begun getting into double IPAs, and my palate was anything but prepared for what awaited me. My original Hopslam review wasn't really negative, but in no way represents my thoughts on this beer now. So here goes review number two, one year later on the 2011 batch.  A - A brilliant, golden orange with a thin white head and lacing that clings forever. This is a hard brew to look away from.  S - Oh my, the smell is wonderful. Bell's could seriously turn this into a cologne, as it's a scent I'd happily wear. The nose would be hops overload, but is balanced out by sweet malts and a bit of fresh-squeezed orange juice. Heavenly.  T - If the smell is heavenly, than the taste is downright ready for saint-hood. Someone call the Vatican. No other beer tastes like Hopslam. It's bitter and sweet, floral with a touch of caramel. Hard to describe, and impossible to top.  M - Medium thick, slick and slightly oily. The stickiness coats the entire mouth with it's goodness, and lingers long after the swallow.  D - While the ABV is way up there, the deliciousness of Hopslam makes it hard to stop at one. Only it's limited availability keeps me from drinking more of this.  I can definitely say I'm happy I bought more Hopslam this year, even after being underwhelmed by it last year. My palate has obviously shifted enough to enjoy this beer in all its glory, and I couldn't be happier.  Original review from 1-18-2010 (a B grade):  As a self-proclaimed ""hophead"" forever on the quest to find my next hop nirvana, I was absolutely dying to try Hopslam. My local beer store had no plans to get any, so I called up the next closest (30 miles away), and they were due for a one-time shipment of five cases the next day! What luck. They agreed to hold two sixers for me, so my dad (a Natty Lite drinker that I'm working to convert) and I made the trip after work. Now, after four bottles over four days, I'm ready to unleash my thoughts on this coveted beer upon the masses.  A - The pour renders a thin white head that quickly subdues into a nice film, with each sip leaving a decent amount of lacing on the glass. The color is a clear gold, and surprisingly similar to Bell's regular IPA, Two Hearted Ale. In a horizontal tasting, the two beers were nearly identical. It's visually pleasing, but nothing outstanding.  S - One nose-full of Hopslam had me absolutely giddy. As mentioned above, I worship at the altar of the Hop-God, and this brew provided a nose full of bitter, pungent hops, backed by a lingering scent of sweet honey. I would happily splash this beer in the appropriate places in lieu of cologne before heading to work, as the scent is simply phenomenal.  T - After the awesome scent, I couldn't wait to taste this immaculate brew...only to take my first sip, and be slapped upside the head with booze. The hops and the honey are certainly in there, but the 10% alcohol simply overtakes everything else. The taste is definitely not bad, but simple disappointing considering the hype, and the notion that this is a hop-bomb. Unfortunately, as the brew warms, the alcohol only tastes stronger.  M - Semi-thick and oily is really the best descriptor for mouthfeel of this brew. Thicker than a normal IPA, but obviously not near the viscosity of an Imperial Stout, Hopslam is right where it needs to be in it's hop-influenced thickness.  D - Even attempting to overlook the alcohol burn in the taste, at 10% Hopslam is nearly the definition of anti-drinkablility. This is sipper, made to be enjoyed over a period of time, rather than a brew begging you to down a sixer over a couple of hours. I've enjoyed plenty of brews of similar strength, that did a wonderfully deceiving job of hiding the ABV, but Hopslam simply is not one of those beers.  As for my final comments, I have to first say that Hopslam may be my most disappointing beer since my inception in the world of craft beer. Don't get me wrong, I still enjoy it, and will have no problem finishing my two six-packs. However, for a beer that is regarded with near ""Holy Grail"" status, I expected something deliciously, and incredibly (kickass) hoppy, but instead got a beer with a dominating booze presence. You know, I may even age a bottle or two. This could develop into something resembling an awesome American-style barley wine.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",Imperial IPA,98
287,17112,MadHopz,5,"This is my first review. I found this site after buying a Dogfish Head 90-minute IPA and thinking I had quite possibly found the best beer ever made. I have not reviewed the DFH yet (that's next) but after spending hours reading the reviews here I set out to find Hopslam. Lucky for me that my discovery of IIPAs coincided with annual release of Hopslam. Doubly lucky for me apparently there aren't a lot of Beer Advocaters down here in Naples, FL as my local Total Wine had 5 sixes left on January 31st (my birthday). I bought them all without even trying it first.  Hopslam is a smooth, balanced, citrusey, hoppy perfection of a beer that might just be worth the ridiculous price. I'm not going to go into it's color, mouthfeel, drinkability, lacing etc. 2,000 people have already done that. What I will say is that, in my limited experience drinking IIPAs (I've had Racer X, Founder's Double Trouble, DFH 90, and Stone Ruination to date) this beer leaves all those in the dust. I figure it needs a few dozen more people to give it all 5s to make this one of the six A+ beers on this site.

The honey stands out along with awesome tropical fruits, mangos. Absolutely wonderful aroma. The honey sweetness begins the flavor profile, followed by those big tropical fruit flavors. Then a second kick of hops, this time of the floral, pine and citrus variety add a bit of bitterness, but a great blend with the honey sweetness to the last half of the beer.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",Imperial IPA,98
287,17112,FosterJM,3.88,230th review on BA Bottle to Tulip Bottle Code 10127- Bottled 1/11/11  App- A nice golden orange with some shimmering yellow/amber/golden highlights. A one finger head that dissapeared quickly. The lacing was very nice though.  Smell- I'm pretty sensitive to a honey product and I get a lot of it in this. Smells like a dough thats sweet like cinnamon rolls but without the cinnamon. Very little fruit but a nice hop aroma.  Taste- You can tell its a DIPA but its very sweet. I was thinking it would be but this was a bit too sweet IMO. At the back this has some weird peppery note to it. Tastes a bit malty at times.  Mouth- Medium bodied with a somewhat creamy medium/high carb level. Left a nice malty taste as well.  Drink- I hate to say it but I'm glad I traded for a bottle but I wouldn't pay the money that most people have to pay for this.,Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",Imperial IPA,98
287,17112,comfortablynumb1,4.3,"Received as an extra from Commis. Thanks again man...  A - Pours a golden honey with a two finger off white head. Head retention is decent and there is good amount of lacing to be had...  S - Lots of citrus fruits with some pine. Also pick up some sweeter notes from the honey and malt...  T - Honey and some malt up front followed by an onslaught of citrus fruit. Mango, grapefruit, and oranges. Finishes with some lingering grapefruit. Abv is well hidden. I see what all the hype is about now. This one is tasty...  M - Nice creamy feel. Sits on the higher end of the medium bodied spectrum with a decent amount of carbonation. This one is super smooth, and easy to drink...  D - This is a superb brew that is super smooth. The ten percent abv only adds to the allure. Bells comes through big time here with a big time brew...

287,17112,plfahey,4.87,"12 oz. bottle poured into a tulip glass.  Appearance-Medium yellow to gold in color with light haze. Moderate white head with good retention and some lacing.  Aroma-Holy hops! What an amazing hop bouquet-citrus, pine, pineapple, grapefruit, resin-this beer smells awesome. Some light bready malt peaks through the hops, and there's a faint whiff of alcohol as well.  Flavor-Smooth piney and resiny hop flavors take the forefront, with some citrusy hop flavors as well. Some slight bready, caramelly malt sweetness peeks through in the center, before being wiped from the palate by moderately high hop bitterness. The hop bitterness carries on far into the aftertaste, but is smooth and pleasant. Light hop flavors of resin linger as well. Truly delicious.  Mouthfeel-Moderate to moderately full body and moderate carbonation come together to give this a firm, yet silky smooth feel on the palate. Though there's definitely some bitterness here, at no point does it even verge on astringent. There is a very light alcohol warmth in the finish, which is the only hint you get that this is a 10% beer.  Bravo. I'm tempted to say that this is the best DIPA I've ever had. The hop aroma is great, but that can be said for several other great DIPAs. What truly sets this one apart is the smoothness of the flavor and bitterness-it's so refreshing that it almost begs you to drink more. This is a fucking awesome beer.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",Imperial IPA,98

Honey is not overpowering, subtle in the background and almost closer to beeswax. Lingering hops. m: A little too thin, almost satiny. d: Traded for this six from halfway across the country, and it is well worth it.

S: Hops of citrus orange, grapefruit, little pine, even a sweet note of malt and honey. Potent, easily detectable from a few feet away.  T: Sweet honey up front quickly, before caving to a main hop attraction. Complexingly hoppy, hard to denote any dominance between the citrus and more earthy tones. Alcohol peaks in just slightly without distracting, the malt only adds a quick caramel flavor to the finish.  M: Definitely on the heavier body side, thick like syrup. Still a decent dry finish to it however. Warming alcohol can be felt.  D: Hops and Honey, a match made in heaven. If Belgian will be famous for their big, spicey brown ales... America will be famous for complex hop-potent brews such as this.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",Imperial IPA,98

287,17112,MicroBeerMan1980,4.05,"A: Honey golden in color. Creamy light head that dissipates quickly. Fine lacy retention around the rim of the glass that continues and hangs on the whole time.  S: Very citrusy. Orange peel, essence of pine and some undertones of grapefruit. Malt profile is also very prevalent.  T: Wonderfully complex hop profile. Pine and citrus notes, intertwined, fall over the tongue, but it does not have a strong tannic bite. The malt body is bready and slightly caramel. Being a strongly hopped beer, the malt profile is ""slammed"" into submission. Naturally. There seems to be a lingering acidic after taste.  M: Full and round on the palate. It's almost as though the beer bends and falls off the sides of the tongue. It's like chewing on a slab of hops.  D: I thoroughly enjoy this beer. Definitely not a session beer, but an ale I enjoy none the less. This beer would pair well with a properly seasoned piece of meat or cold cut sandwich. Sorry vegetarians. I'm sure pastrami tofu would pair well??",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",Imperial IPA,98
287,17112,Bobbydigi,4.94,"I look forward to this beer more than just about any other seasonal release every year. One of my favorites.  Batch 10115. Bottled poured into my Bell's tulip.  A - An aggressive pour leaves a one inch eggshell white head with some nice lacing. The color is golden and very clear with a few bubbles rising to the top.  S - One of my favorite smelling beers and the aroma hits you the second you pop the cap. Lots of floral hops, also orange, grapefruit, pine and the honey is definitely present.  T - YUM. Everything in the nose comes together great and the honey and pine are a lot more forward. The aftertaste leaves a nice bitter and piny flavor. This is very hop forward but isn't overly bitter. After the beer warms some the malt comes through some.  M - Perfectly carbonated and silky smooth, almost too smooth.  D - I'll put it to you this way. The very first six pack I bought of Hopslam, I drank them all in one night (this lead to a very rough next day). Now I choose to start off my nights with them and move on after one or two so I don't run out so fast.  Well done Bell's! One of the best beers I've had.

A: Pours a bronze/amber color with a finger thick white head that slowly dissipates, leaving some nice lacing down the side of the glass.  S: The smell is major floral hops (piney and woodsy), followed with some citrus and a tad bit of honey.  T: The flavor has serious hops up front, both piney/oily hops and citrus/floral hops as well. In the middle is a nice sweetness from the honey and a bit of caramel malt follows. The finish is dry and bitter.  M: Medium bodied with a nice tingly carbonation. The feel is bitter (obviously with a name like HopSlam) and it linger throughout.  D: Even though this is a 10% ABV DIPA, there is virtually no trace of alcohol. The abundance of hops is nicely complimented by the sweetness of the honey and malts.

The lacing continues down my glass pretty well.  The smell is that of grapefruit and orange and woodsy. It's just awesome.  A nice sweet and bitter taste. Just a touch of the 10% ABV comes through at the end.  It has a nice creamy feel in my mouth.  The 10% ABV makes it such that one or two is enough for an evening.

287,17112,engagechad,4.09,"I received this bottle as a single from a BA ramseye4 in person in Richmond, VA (Thanks! :) )  This beer pours beautifully with an easy to manipulate head. Golden color with hints of amber, only slightly cloudy and perfect carb. In my opinion the smell on this beer is the MVP of the lineup. It was amazing.. So much so that I think I spent more time smelling the beer than drinking it. It smelled of fresh lemon zest and pine and as it warmed I got notes of warm brown sugar, like fresh cookies which was most likely a result of the honey used in the brewing. The beer tasted very good, bitter but also smooth however the mouthfeel got a bit harsh nearing the end with the ethanol burn.  Hype is for the most part justified but for a DIPA I would prefer a Ruinition. I would recommend anyone that hasn't had it to seek it out for the nose alone, Bells nailed it.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",Imperial IPA,98

Doesn't get much better than this.  T: Flavor is a huge, bitter pine and grapefruit assault on the tongue. A little apple and pear are evident midway through, followed by light caramel malt sweetness. Finish is long, bitter and slightly astringent.  M: Medium body with full carbonation and a crisp dry finish. On the lighter/crisper side for a DIPA.  I've enjoyed the flavor of this beer a little more in years past. Seems a little bit more astringent and alcoholic this year, but maybe it's more a result of my palate adjusting to all the fruity Citra IPAs/DIPAs out there these days. Still an outstanding beer with an unbelievable aroma.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",Imperial IPA,98
287,17112,Fieldzy27,4.74,"Appearance-Poured from a 12oz bottle into a Rogue pint glass. I could have put a little more gravity on this pour but i'm sure the beer wont suffer too much. The color of the beer is a fairly light copper with a completely white head. It fizzles away fairly fast but thats sort of expected from a beer thats fresh with a higher abv (this one rings in at 10% by the way). Lots of tiny bubbles running to the surface but unable to save the head from deflating. Looks stellar.  Smell- Right off the bat as soon as I poured this juicy sweet hoppy aromas jump out of the glass with full force. Citrus sweetness and tons of pine resins dominate. Oranges and grapefruit aren't far behind. All of these meld together and smell amazing. The balance in the nose is flawless. No off scents for miles. This smells like a true DIPA with hops all the way through but still a hint of sweetness to keep it all together. Perfect.  Taste- First and foremost hops hops and more hops. Bitter attacks the tongue with violent force and relents quickly followed by more pine and citrus. This then dies to the point of letting hints of sweetness come through only to reveal a hoppy zesty finish that coats the moth with an slightly bitter resinous feeling. Only to be described as a symphony of flavor the different tastes meld together sip after sip. My mouth literally waters after every taste. As it warms a small amount of sweet bready malt comes through and the hops open up even further. The sweetness attempts to create a little more balance only to be denied by the insane hop profile. Perfect.  Mouthfeel-This beer holds one of the best mouthfeels to style as any I have ever tasted. The carbonation is bubbly and full but not fizzy and overbearing. The body of the beer is thick and full but not too much to detract from drinkability. The beer coats your mouth with oils that fade quickly into a tingle that leaves you simply begging for more. Every sip bring you dangerously close to the last one yet you cant stop yourself.Im honestly running out of words here.  Overall- This is truly amazing beer. Bottom line this creation was crafted by the best in the business and it shows. I cant think of one thing to make an improvement on let alone a flaw. A truly welcome tongue lashing of hops that makes beg for another. It drinks like a hopped up 6% beer when it stands tall at 10%.

287,17112,gwguest,4.45,"Poured from a 12oz brown bottle into a 12oz Sam Adams Perfect Pint.  Pours a very pretty orange / amber which is darker than I was expecting. Foam is comprised of tightly packed small white bubbles. Foam sticks around for a sufficient length of time and size to enjoy it with the beer. Foam leaves a nice sticky, but thin lacing on the glass.  Aroma is strong of citrus with a ribbon of piney simcoish notes. There is a lot going on, but it's a well-crafted aroma. Objectively, it's quite good, and better than most DIPA out there, but I was expecting something more.  Taste is just a solid wall of hops being pushed along by a nice malty backbone. Bitterness, flavor and aroma all work together to really make this beer an enjoyable experience. The hop flavors from the nose are right there in the flavor as well. Some beers pull a bit of a bait and switch where the aroma is disjointed from the flavor, but Hopslam delivers both. The bitterness is spot on to deliver a nicely balanced, yet appropriately bitter beer for a DIPA. The focus is certainly on the hop flavors though. Bell's certainly isn't just throwing hops in the kettle and settling for whatever comes out; this is a well-crafted brew that has a lot of care in it.  The mouthfeel is a bit drier that you might expect, but it's just a bit thicker than a regular IPA which is right where I like 'em.  This beer is dangerously drinkable. I polished off two more after I'd made my tasting notes before taking a better look at the ABV on this one. I could have easily had several more and enjoyed every moment. I'm glad that I double checked the ABV before continuing my evening.  It gets a bit too much hype, but still a fantastic brew.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",Imperial IPA,98
287,17112,Lucklys,4.92,"Poured into my tumbler, it was a crystal clear, bright and sparkling honey-golden-amber color with virtually no visible carbonation. I managed to build a 3-finger head through a vigorous pour, but once it settled, it held a creamy 2-finger white head of fluffy soap bubbles with excellent retention. There was quite a surprising amount of lace that lined the glass in intricate sheets while a thick island of large soapy bubbles mingled with a thin covering of minuscule bubbles that covered the rest of the liquid. Hopslam carried a very nice head for such a huge Double IPA.  My nose was immediately vanquished by the aromas as I poured the beer from the bottle into the tumbler. As soon as I opened the bottle there was an enormous explosion (and I cannot stress how huge this was) of floral, grassy and citrus hops that bombarded my nostrils. The subsequent mushroom cloud offered a rich body of zesty grapefruit, sour orange, tart pineapple and even light melon notes near the edges. All of the hoppy-ness was beautifully rounded out with softer florals, fresh cut grass, and a sweet honey slathered over faint biscuity malts. Somewhere along the process of whiffing all this beer, some hints of pine managed to peek through, but they were far from consistent and stayed fairly well hidden. Overall, the scent was remarkably fresh and green - like walking through a botanical garden on a dry spring day. Even with all of huge aromas and the amount of hops that come out in the nose, nothing in the smell was overwhelming or burned. It may very well be on the best smelling beers I've ever had the pleasure of sniffing.  Once it was finally in my mouth (though, honestly, this was the third Hopslam I've had since it was released), there was a very bitter, tart, but crazy smooth wave of resiny pine flavor - or at least more than what was in the nose, though the zesty orange, grapefruit and even some lemon were definitely alive and kicking. Rather than being sharp and biting, like one might expect from a Double IPA packed with 6 different hop varietals, all of the hops were smoothed out fantastically with the sweet honey and light bready malts. Again, nothing was overwhelming or completely took out the other flavors; everything worked together perfectly, and in doing so, any trace of alcohol that might be expected from a beer with 10% ABV (holy wow) is obliterated. Due to the fact that the alcohol is so well hidden, Hopslam is very, very easy to drink, though being as smooth as it is and so well-rounded doesn't hurt either. I did find that when the drink first hit my lips, it started off dry, but by the time I swallowed, it almost felt slick across my tongue, ending only slightly dry and with a very light bitterness that gradually died away before the next sip. Holding a medium mouthfeel with light carbonation kept it from being spicy, and even though I found it difficult to pick out the alcohol, it definitely started hitting my brain after half the glass.  In complete honesty, if you aren't sure if you're a fan of DIPAs or even IPAs in general, this beer is something I would recommend to all of the fence-sitters. Regardless of the amount of alcohol, both the nose and flavor come together so ridiculously perfectly that you would be hard-pressed to find another beer that might convince you that these two categories are not all that scary.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",Imperial IPA,98
287,17112,alexonate,5,"All 5's my friends. I was fortunate enough to purchase 12 last year. Drank 6 stored the other 6.

287,17112,drewba,4.6,"A - This is shining see through gold with a fluffy, bubbly white head. The head sinks to big white bubbles with patches of sticky lacing.  S - Highly floral, highly citrus bouquet; lemon, mango, tangerine, orange. Hints of pine, caramel, bread and booze. Had the alcohol aroma not been there, it'd be perfect.  T - BUCKETS of pineapple, lemon, lime, mango, and tangerine wet, juicy, slightly sweet yet slightly bitter hop goodness. The finish brings semi bitter grapefruit, pine and a grass afterthought. All throughout the hop stages, a hint of honey, caramel and cracker is helping balance this one out. I hate to be that guy, but It's worth noting the huge citrus qualities have faded noticeably; there is more grapefruit and pine bitter and dryness now versus days old.  M - Creamy small bubbles are doing the trick. Very smooth, rich mouthfeel without having too much body makes me happy.  D - Crisp, refreshing, juicy body, hardly a hint of alcohol in the taste. At 10% this is a recipe for disaster, but damn is it drinkable.

287,17112,cosmicevan,4.12,"cracking my first taste of hopslam (thanks klevelandrocks for the amazing extra!!!)  A - Poured a sparkly deep honey orange with a single finger head into my oversized snifter. Looked like a nice rich IPA. Steady and even bubbling from the bottom.  S - HopSLAM!!!! Really amazing smelling beer. Nicely balanced, soft pine...not as sticky as I had expected. Candy, banana, bubblegum...all blended with a citric undertone. Could smell it all day.  T - Wow...super bitter. Starts with hops...almost like sucking on a pine cone. Finishes with a vanilla alcohol. Hopefully I won't be hunted down and strung up from the nearest tree, but I find the flavor good, but not great. The hops are so over the top, my palette hurts. Took me a while to get used to the intensity.  M - Alcohol bite with a cooling bittery aftertaste.  D - I'll be honest...it's a bit over the top for me. The way that this beer is praised and put side-by-side with much better balanced beers really made me expect another sublimely balanced hoppy IPA. The smell is there, but the rest is just kind of like a SN Pale Ale on steroids (and I quite like SNPA as it is). I enjoyed this and will probably look around for it when it hits shelves again next year...but I'm fine with the few bottles I got as extras. Not necessarily something I'd go nuts for.  *** ** * ** *** edit 2012-01-24 - first take on this years' bottle dated 12/29 (thanks Marti403 for hooking it up!)  a - poured a murkly cloudy deep amber orange with a finger of frothy ipa head into my urthel tulip. sticky streaky lacing. feel the same - 4.5  s - same amazing smell.  t - amazing what a year does to one's palette. i've definitely become more of a hophead. the flavors are the same, but the bitterness seems toned back (probably due to my palette developing to enjoy that more). this time, i'd give it a 4.5  m - 4  o - definitely more of an ipa fan this time around and this is a fantastic example of an amazing ipa. i don't think i would put this above pliny or even lunch, but it is a hell of a beer. - 4.5",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",Imperial IPA,98

Faint haze, but a bright pale yellow gold. Head settles down quickly. There is so much going on with the aromatics, very pleasant floral aromas with some (mango?) fruit notes. Fantastic and very unique juicy flavor rich with grapefruit hops. The malt character doesn't stand out, but is present and works with the honey to mellow out the boat load of hops.

Taste - Very smooth at first and a slight tingle going down the pipe. Tastes of grapefruit and honey on the tongue. Although high in alcohol, you wouldn't notice at first. Once you get into the more than one, you'll definitely feel this beer.

287,17112,champ103,4.25,"A big thanks to jenray for the bottle.  A: Pours a bright and golden/copper/orange color. A stunning clarity and brightness. A two finger white head forms with excellent retention. Especially considering the high alcohol. Some patchy lace is left behind. S: Incredibly fresh. A huge floral, grassy, and citrus aroma. A substantial sweetness in the nose as well. I assume from the honey. Tons of hops for the hop head, but also really well balanced. Which is a treat for me. T: Up front is plenty of floral and grassy hops. Lots of citrus as well. A great balance of sweetness, but it never takes over the hop presents. Some resiny bitterness lingers. M/D: A medium to full body. Very crisp and clean. I wish it was a bit more dry though. So easy to drink. No alcohol burn at all, for me anyway. For the high alcohol, and a big hop bomb to boot, I am finishing this in no time.  An excellent Double IPA. I am not a fan of the style, and I really think that Bell's is a bit overrated. Though this is an excellent beer. Highly recommended.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",Imperial IPA,98

287,17112,jakeaustin,4.16,"Ok here it is, in my glass, the legendary ad much hyped hopslam. Pours a slightly hazy amber into my snifter. No head whatsoever. Just a little lacing as it goes down.  Lots of grapefruit hops in the nose. No surprise there. There's also a decent amount if sweet malt. One of the more pleasant dipas I've smelled. Taste is similar but the hops are definitely overpowering the malt. I don't have a problem with that. Hop flavor is mostly grapefruit with a nice spiciness as well. After the hop flavor has faded from your palate the malt is left behind which keeps this one fairly well balanced despite the amount of hops. Bitterness is strong but not unbearable, at least not for the seasoned hop head.  Finish is pretty much perfect with just enough sweetness from the hop resin left behind after every sip. Carbonation seems a little low but doesn't bother me. Hhhhmmmm, drinkability, that's a tough one. Plenty of bitterness, plenty if alcohol, but still goes down fairly quick. Overall quite a nice dips. Worth the ridiculous hype? Maybe not. Absolutely glad I was able to get a sixer of this though.

A sweet orange slice dipped in honey aroma lingered also T: At first you get a rush of the hops, and the after taste is a nice honey and citrus linger followed by a little heat from the high abv.

Nice citrusy notes coming off the tongue; pineapple, mango, and orange.  M: Mouthfeel is very good in this beer. Carbonation isn't over the top, but just right.

This one was bottled on 1/4/2011 so this is a fair re-do, given both are being reviewed 26 days after bottling.  I guess my taste buds have evolved, because this is a beast of a brew.  Aggressively poured into my Duvel tulip, a billowing white head forms on top of a golden-peach color of a beer.  Smell and taste are unbelievable. The quintessential hop bomb, in smell and taste. Mouthful is also exceptional. Carbonation is barely detectable, but the hops live with every mouthful -- doing a heck of a job clearing my sinuses, too.  This is my second Hopslam tonite. Drinkability is amazing for a 10 percent ABV. Either my taste buds have evolved, or this is a better batch than the 2009 version.

Pours a light gold with a slight chill haze and a finger of fluffy white head. Good retention and lace. Piney, weedy, fresh big green hop nose. Somewhat similar to a DFH 60 on steroids, though bizarrely not all that much like DFH 90. Huge green hop flavour, fresh and vibrant. Pine, hop leaf, and then a huge sweet citric fruitiness, with mango and pineapple coming to the fore. A slight dry graininess in the background. Really nicely done, and it hides its alcohol astonishingly well. Moderate body and a creamy carbonation.  Ectremely well-balanced and crafted.

287,17112,MusicaleMike,3.86,"Consumed on 1-21-11.  I should start by saying that I review beers based on the category that they fall under, not personal preference. The Double IPA category is a competitive one though...  Served in a goblet. Small off-white head which does not have great head retention and dissipates to a wispy lacing. Under this head, a golden body with come cloudiness.  This smells incredible! Juicy hops waft off this beer and coat the entire room with their perfume. An extremely complex hop aroma, which deserves a solid ""5 Pints"" rating here. Piney, herbal, spearmint, grapefruit, with a sweet honey...and a touch of alcohol in the nose, which contributes its own mark with notes of tropical fruits.  The beers flavor is sort of a let down after the aroma. Very heavy taste of alcohol is the big upset here. The excessive bitterness isn't my thing without something to balance it out, and I am afraid that the combination of extreme bitterness and ethanol isn't what the Double IPA category is all about. Sure, the alcohol should be up there, and 10% is most definitely up there, but everything should be balanced out by the power of malt. To the beer's credit, the beer is not ""hot"". So it does not lose points for having any burn.  The mouthfeel is quite excellent. Very smooth, and very rich. Carbonation is at a good level for the style. The mouthfeel is certainly a strong point with this brew.  The most difficult part about making a huge beer is trying to make it so that someone is going to come back for more. I could only have one of these in a sitting, but maybe the trick with reviewing the drinkability of a high abv beer is that would you revisit this beer in the future if you had the opportunity? Yes, if it was at the bar where I was dining. Would I go to a bar just because they had it on tap? No.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",Imperial IPA,98
287,17112,kbanks13,4.57,"Got this as an extra from a recent LIF, thanks again Carl!  Poured into a tulip slightly chilled with a golden/honey colored body that had a huge white dense head with great retention and lacing. Smelled like mango and grapefruit, citra hops maybe? Also a good deal of pine and a decent malt bill in the aroma, slight twang of the honey it is brewed with. Taste was immediately resin and pine with citrus fruit cutting through here and there. Sweetness to balance the bitterness from the honey and malts. Surprisingly balanced, but definitely a hop bomb, though not entirely what I expected based on the nose. Slick oily mouthfeel that was coating but not syrupy. Medium to high carbonation. I really enjoyed this, but I think there are other DIPAs I would rather buy.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",Imperial IPA,98
287,17112,djmichaelk,4.7,"12oz bottle into a perfect pint. 2011 release. I'd had this last year, but wanted to review it when I could have it fresh.  A - Pours a brilliant straw yellow, with just the slightest haze. Big fluffy three fingers of head, receding to a nice cap after a minute or so. Lots of sticky lacing all over the glass. Great looking beer.  S - Wow, this smells great. The aroma explodes out of the glass and fills the room. Tons of fruity smells: grapefruit and mango dominate, but there's also some pine and a little orange. The honey is there, but it's not obvious. I'm impressed.  T - Fantastic. I'm a huge fan of citrusy hops, and this one's gor lots of citrusy hops all over the place. Huge grapefruit and orange flavors, and for some reason I'm getting a rosemary hit in there somewhere along with some pine. Not much in the malt department, which is fine for me. The honey lends a sweetness in the background that keeps the bitter hops from overwhelming the other flavors. All in all, everything melds together for a great blend.  M - The carbonation makes it seem maybe a little light to me. It's reasonably dry going down, but the 10% is fairly well hidden (until you try to walk after three or four bottles). But it could benefit from more aggressive carbonation.  D - Ordinarily I'd never rate a 10% beer this high in D, but this one warrants it. I can't say that I can honestly make it through a six-pack in a sitting, but I *want* to... and that's gotten me into trouble more than once.  O - Well, I can honestly say that this is one of the few beers I've had that have completely lived up to the hype. This is easily shoulder-to-shoulder with Pliny as the pinnacle of DIPAs for me. It's good enough to warrant the price, and I only wish that it was available year-round.

The beer is slightly cloudy golden with thin head. The aroma was a powerful citrus and pine...everything one would want from an Imperial IPA. The citrus/pine help to balance the 10% ABV....a few of these and one will be slammed!!!! The high alcohol and powerful flavor makes this a tough session beer!

287,17112,sophisticated,4.33,"First time trying this. Love the label - a lucky sob is getting body-slammed by a giant hop nugget. What a way to go. Hops + Honey...That's just smart.  The hopslam poured a beautiful orange-amber-honey color with a small fizzy white head and slow-moving carbonation, enjoying their journey through the liquid ambrosia. The smell was strong citrus hops with an underlying malt presence. And the taste - just like the picture. A bountiful hop nugget body slammed on my tongue which puckered in the delightful combination of bitterness, citrus, and honey. A little bit of floral notes too, and very little noticeable alcohol for 10% ABV. It was smooth sailing, a little bit of alcohol warmth, medium bodied, and very good drinkability for such a high level of alcohol.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",Imperial IPA,98

287,17112,TheQuietMan22,4.54,"Appearance: Straight pour into a tulip glass. The color is a slightly hazy honey color. One finger of slightly off-white head developed and dissipated quickly to leave a bubbly lacing and ring around the edge. There is some very minor carbonation: one or two bubbles float to the top.  Smell: An invigorating and pleasant grape fruit citrus socked me in the nose. It is mostly citrusy, but there are also aromas of pineapple, pine, caramel, and honey.  Taste: The wait to let it warm a little was agonizing; I could hardly resist the urge to lift the glass to my mouth and pour it in. My first sip was a mouthful of lovely bitterness -- major hop bitterness. It was, however, not overpowering; it let the flavors shine through: grapefruit citrus, pine spice, caramel, and honey. The pineapple element from the smell was there, but its presence was not as strong. A pleasant, bitter aftertaste left my tongue and cheeks tingling and lingered in my throat long after each swallow. The alcohol was completely masked.  Drinkability: Until now I did not think I was a big hophead. However, I wonder if my taste is evolving. Very tasty, good, and drinkable stuff.

287,17112,Bmoyer0301,4.5,"Appearance:  As I pulled the cap off the bottle I only heard a slight hiss from the carbonation gas. I decided to pour this into my Sam Adams perfect pint glass and was left with a thick and hearty one finger thick bone white head that hung around for the whole pint. As I hold my glass up to the light it appears to be a burnt orange almost honey color that is crystal clear. When I give a swirl the viscosity is pretty thick leaving lasting legs that are running down the walls of my glass.  Smell:  Sweet, bright citrus notes, honey, caramel, lots of pine and other sugars. The middle is filled with all kinds of mango and other tropical fruits which really bring out all that the beer as to offer. There is a tinge of the heat alcohol and strangely enough something that resembles a women s hair salon.  Taste:  Very hoppy but not sharp and bitey but rather smooth and waxy resin leaves a thick coating on your palate which is amazing! Loads of warming alcohol and honey which rounds out the sweetness very well. Caramel and toffee thick chewy malt, lemon skins and more evergreen tree round out the finish.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",Imperial IPA,98
287,17112,Bouleboubier,4.47,"This is a fine big hoppy IPA. I don't know what it is about many of these ""fresh"" hop strong ales I've had, but they all seem to share similar, if not the very same, hop flavors/aromas/characteristics. Hopslam is no exception. Same hops? - DFH 90 Min and Victory Hop Wallop are other examples I look to that seem nearly indistinguishable from a hop profile standpoint.  That said, the hops show tremendous depth and expanse in the smell - 3D! Flowery - as in nose-deep in a handful of hop flowers - with fairly pungent/spicy grapefruit tones. Blended quite nicely with that is the thick biscuity malt and more than a hint of honey. The honey may largely be responsible for the cruddy head and retention and sunny golden honey glow. Tiny chill haze (or just plain haze).  The taste pretty much closely mirrors the smell, but with the presence of the malts coming more into balance with the assertive bitterness of the hops. What I love about Hop Wallop is that it's somewhat clean and dry from start to finish - the feel of this is tipped quite in the other direction, however, not to its detriment. I'm even surprised how much I dug the thickish (but a bit short of viscous), silky-smooth roll this has on the palate.  By the end, though, the hoppy/malty goodness began to show signs of building to a fever pitch, not of extra goodness, but of cheap kiddie perfume and animal urine. Thus, it wouldn't be a stretch for me to guess that another bottle wouldn't have pleased. Plus, the 10% which is all but masked throughout, decides to kick in and pickle ya. Liked it all-in-all, though, and I'd try it again. Hopheads love it, I'm sure.  original scores (30 Jan 2011): 3.5, 4.5, 4, 4.5, 4  tasting of 16 oz can on 31 Aug 2022... scores have been updated... tasting this in an early-morning session trying to rid of several hoppy beer cans in my fridge... I've had this can for at least 6 months maybe and, damn, while the other cans taste rather crap, the overall quality of this has held up splendidly... maybe not of the dynamic impact of a fresher example but it's superbly enjoyable... actually drank the whole can (poured into my Sapwood Cellars gumdrop-shaped stemmed glass)... really just updating my ratings to my collective experience with this brew...

I bought a Sierra Nevada bomber Imperial IPA, Hopminium? Or something like that. First taste of Both was wow, but when it was Hopslam it was a bit of a more satisfied statement.  Great balance on it. Was afraid of the fact they brewed in honey from the start but they proved its worth. It's sweet, it's hoppy, it's bitter. Tastes like a good IPA and wouldnt expect it to be an imperial.

287,17112,coachdonovan,4.57,"My first foray into Hopslam Land. Thanks to Hawthorne's in South Philly for having it available fresh; this one was bottled on Dec 7, 2010 and poured into a tulip.  The look is a golden brassy copper. There is an ever-so-slight haze. Lace is two fingers thick and sticks around all day. Look, I know IPAs have a citrus aroma. But this is crazy. I've never had a beer that smells so much like a grapefruit- there's even a tartness there.  Taste is similarly zesty, but not quite like anything I've previously come across. As I make my way through the first few sips, this beer goes in directions I wasn't expecting. There's no overwhelming malt backbone to sugar things up, but somehow the hops don't run out of control. It's nice and juicy and a little oily but again, everything is in check. The finish is the only time when the bitterness lingers a bit too much, but I can't say it really affects the drinkability. The alcohol certainly doesn't, as I'd never guess 10% until the morning after.  I have to admit, I was turned off by all the BA buzz about this beer. I didn't expect to have any, and I figured I couldn't be missing all that much. Then I was fortunate to find some, but even then I assumed it couldn't live up to the hype.

287,17112,Pellinore1,4.74,"Pours light, clear amber with generous white head. This dissipates slowly, leaving a thin cap of lacing.  Some beers need to be swirled a bit and held right under the nose before you can smell them, while others make themselves known as soon as you open the bottle. Hopslam falls into that second category. Citrus hops, backed up by just a little sweetness, make for a fantastic smell.  The flavor opens with big, bright citrus and pine hops, then moves on to just a bit of sweet caramel or honey. The finish is long, lingering, and nicely bitter.  Medium-bodied with some nice carbonation, this has a fine mouthfeel.  The ABV is nearly undetectable in this beer. I feel like I could easily drink a few at a sitting, and only realize what I've done when I try to stand up.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",Imperial IPA,98
287,17112,Reaper16,4.44,"served on-tap at The Alcove, Tuscaloosa, AL, into a mason jar  Pours out exactly as HopSlam always does: a warm, melted caramel color with 1.5 fingers or more of sudsy, pearl-white head. Lacing managed to be pretty adequate in this mason jar I'm stuck drinking the beer out of.  I have a natural reaction that tells me if I think a given Double IPA is amongst the elite of the style: if upon the first sniff, I crack a wide smile and laugh. It's a reflexive action, like kicking your leg if you get tapped on the kneecap. Every first sniff of HopSlam is a grin and a guffaw for me. I love this lupulin. The pineapple husk is so immediate and strong and lovely. The papaya wafts up and around the pineapple with such a complimentary grace. The passionfruit, no scratch that, the passionfruit-flavored Starburst aroma is also very nice. Not very much pine at all on the nose. The smooth tropical fruits are backed up by HopSlam's hefty malt profile. This isn't East Coast; there isn't an overabundance of caramel malts. But the honeyed sweet spine of the beer is there for the smelling. Great, great aroma, as always.  The taste of this particular keg is just a hair under the quality that I get from a fresh bottle. Unfortunately, Alabama received their HopSlam about two weeks later than it needed too. Remember: when it comes to beers that are this intensely hoppy, they literally get worse each day after the minute they are bottled. This is still stellar, but the malt flavors are creeping up in the profile more than when this beer is super-fresh, and the tropical fruits are less distinct, less complex (but more rounded, which may be a positive for some palates) than when super-fresh. Still stellar, though. Lovely gushes of hoppy flavors. More pine and floral notes than the nose hinted at. Yummy.  This has got an East Coast-like mouthfeel. Usually, you never see me giving high mouthfeel scores to big, sticky Double IPAs, but HopSlam makes it work. I think the key is that they rely less on overpowering caramel malts and more on the honey sweetness. It's substantial without taking away from the hop flavors. Flavors which, by the way, are so good that I could drink this forever. But this beer being 10%ABV, that's a biological impossibility. 4.0 is as high as I can go given that this beer will get you tipsy with a quickness.  This is the third year that I've managed to do a HopSlam review. Having reviewed it out of the bottle, from a cask (!) and finally getting to an on-tap review, I'm running out of ways to review it. Maybe next year I'll get a mini-keg.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",Imperial IPA,98
287,17112,duece27,4.05,Another solid offering from Bells. I enjoy how the different liquor stores price this abv monster. Be careful an extra $6 can be ripped from your wallet for no good reason.  Light amber with clingy lace. ( it's so clear where is all the alcohol hiding)  A good nose with persistent hops. I expected a little more aggressive nose then this having recalled the memory of last years batch.  Lots of initial bitterness but with the third drink the honey punches through and sweetness starts to drag the hops under.

I definitely detect the honey as well as citrusy grapefruit. Some hop oil is present as well as floral notes. Really intoxicating stuff.   Bitter tinge as soon as it hits my palate, but the honey radiate through with a smoothness that is again followed by bite. A little grapefruit in the aftertaste as well. It really ends with some bone dry grass. The bitter bite really comes through in the after taste, as my ears start to ring after each sip.  A really nice combination that is really well balanced and interesting at every sip. It's really hot though. I can feel it burn all the way down into my stomach. This is obviously a beer that demands attention, not just by the mouth but all the way down to the stomach.     Carbonation is mild, there are some bubbles in the mix and they join well with the beating my palate is taking from the hops. Pretty lasting flavor after it's gone. I might not have eaten in a while, but I will be pretty buzzed after one of these. It's an easy one to drink because it's so good, but it will knock you on your ass.

287,17112,JayS2629,4.57,"Wow! This beer lives up to its name and accomplishes what it sets out to do...slam you with hops. However, its brewed with honey and this adds a nice sweet character that smooths out the balance and makes it very drinkable.  Not as much of a palette wrecker as it claims. Its bitterness gets balanced out with a sweet middle.  A- Transparant honey tone with a craggy white foam that recedes to an oily sea foam layer that leaves nice rings of lace.  S- Pungent pine, herbal and floral notes in front, plenty of citrus, orange peel zest, lemon, and grapefruit. Honey suckle.  T- Complex resiny hop forward, full of floral and citrus, grapefruit and a silky honey note that sits nicely in the middel. Very balanced with a good bitter aftertaste, grassy notes.  M- Slightly oily, nicely balanced, crisp and refreshing.  D- Surpringly easier to drink than I expected. I believe its a sipper for those not ready for hops, but it delivered what it said it would and therefore gets a high score. I give it extra points for the honey middle.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",Imperial IPA,98
287,17112,vkv822,4.52,"12oz bottle into snifter.  Pours fairly clear, beautiful golden orange with light rising carbonation and a craggy white head.  Aroma is of sweet, tropical fruit, with resiny pine and very nice citric, lemony, grapefruit notes.  The taste is again of tropical fruits upfront. There are also notes of resiny pine, along with a grapefruit, citric balance. I can definitely detect the honey sweetness towards the middle, though I probably would not have been able to pinpoint it as honey had I not known. Has a distinct bitter finish.  The mouthfeel is fairly medium to full-bodied with nice carbonation and leaves a faint oilyness. Very well done and really fits perfectly with the beer.  The honey really adds a nice balance to sweeten out any heavy bitterness and makes this is an very drinkable beer. I would never guess the ABV was this high. I dont' know that I would buy multiple cases as some do, but I am very happy I traded for a sixer and could probably go for one or two more.

S - Intensely fruity bouquet, smells like a canned fruit cocktail with sweet syrup. Strong supporting turn from piney, floral hops.  T - Very sweet, the honey asserts itself up front. Then the bitterness of the hops arrives in force, fresh grass and flower clippings. Finishes with sweet grapefruit.  M - Oily, medium body. The finish is dry, but understated. Exactly what I expect for the style.  D - The alcohol is well-masked at first, but becomes more noticeable near the midpoint. This isn't unpleasant at all, but it does slow the sipping considerably.

The taste is a sweeter ipa with citrus and the alcohol at first adds a great quality to the taste. But as its warming up the alcohol is becoming more and more present.

Intense citrus aroma with tons of tropical fruit; grapefruit, mango, pineapple, etc. Taste is more fruit, very citrusy. The preceived bitterness is only moderate. Not boozy at all considering the high ABV. Could pass it off as a regular IPA, other than the intense amounts of hop aroma and flavor.

The smell was one of strong orange and pineapple with a touch of grapefruit. My first thoughts on tasting were 'sweet' and 'orange', which was followed with a nice balance of bitterness. A moderate to heavy mouthfeel, perhaps because of the sweetness. Fairly drinkable, although it may take me a few to get used to the sweeter than normal taste of most of the brews I enjoy.

287,17112,ToAzwethinkweizm,4.44,"Date: 28 January 2011 Glass: Sierra Nevada XXX snifter Type: 12fl oz bottle  Review #100! Decided to drink a popular one. I haven't drank this beer in 3 years, and can't remember how it tasted.  Poured gently, 2-finger bubbly head, reduces to a thin film, light spider-web lacing, color is a clear light orange. Aroma is hoppy yet very sweet. I wonder if that can be attributed to the honey in the beer? The hops smell of a leathery (new-shoes-smell) citrus, favoring grapefruit, then orange, then lemon. Pine is there, but citrus comes first.  Taste is extremely smooth with a sweetness almost like mead. Taste of orange and grapefruit, ending with a bitter note on the palate. I'm not sure this beer lives up to all the hype, but for a sought after, small batch release, this is certainly worth every penny.  ADVICE: Don't let this beer warm up to more than 55 deg F.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",Imperial IPA,98

Shabang..fruit cocktail aroma: pineapple, mango, a little peach, a little orange, bit of floral aroma as well. Tastes of strong grapefruit, heavy citrus and big time bitterness, little bit of honey to sweeten the deal. Some pine influence as well. I love the difference in flavor and aroma of this beer.

287,17112,salvo,4.62,"This is a review of Hopslam on tap, for which I thank BlackSparrow Pub in Lafayette. Thanks for keeping us in wonderful beer, birdies. My bottle review should appear right below this one for those who wont get access to the kegs.  Pours a beautiful straw-towards-tawny yellow-brown with a foamy two inch head that slowly collapses, etching the glass. The liquid is very clear with little residue.  Wow, the aroma is amazing. Honey is very assertive at first, and then that fades and is replaced by piney, citrus, grapefruit aroma. Amazingly assertive nose.  First taste is all pine, which then dissipates, with a suggestion of peppery 10% alcohol burn, but well balanced. The finish is long, slow, and complex as it turns from hints of honey to raging citrus peel and back again to the sweet biscuit and honey where it started. Fade to pepper buzz and tea astringent, sip again. All pine, which dissipates. As it warms, more floral hints (from the honey?) and more tropical fruit are present. Almost worth putting up with ice and snow.  This year's Hopslam has a rich honey aroma with sweet biscuit malt in the nose; I've read some reports about changes to the honey they were using, and it seems most of the sugars were converted to alcohol, leaving only a fabulous flowery honey aroma that asserts itself over the rich piney and grapefruit nose. The hops are certainly there, but last year's was sweeter with hopper aroma and more honey in the mouth.  The taste is so worth waiting through bitter midwestern winters to access. The main difference in the bottled nectar is that the malts are stronger on the palate and mouthfeel is ever-so-slightly lighter, with the hops mildly subdued. Beautiful in any form.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",Imperial IPA,98
287,17112,GallowsThief,4.39,Poured into my Duvel out of a 12 oz bottle.  A - Pale and golden pour with just about a one inch head that quickly recedes. Very sticky lacing all over.  S - Big piney and citrusy smell. Fruity and floral as well. Hops all over it naturally. Just a huge smell. Traces of honey.  T - I expected a huge hop taste up front but I got a nice subtle sweetness. The big hops taste follows right through though with definite grapefruit flavors. Honey provides the mentioned sweetness. Tartness in the end makes this a great beer.  M - Creamy slick layer left on the tongue. Medium bodied and medium carbonation. Leaves the mouth dry (and wanting more!).  D - ABV be damned this is scarily drinkable. Thee alcohol is expertly hidden.,Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",Imperial IPA,98

Flavor is great as well. I gave a sample to a friend who isnt into craft much and he said ""holy shit. There's like 9 flavors in one sip!"" I'd have to agree. Starts out bursting with hop flavor. Orange, lemon, grapefruit, tropicals. Rounds into a touch of caramel followed by some honey sweetness. Leaves a mildy bitter aftertaste, but doesn't overdo it at all.

I'll end up drinking 2 more of these than I need to, and will be trying to find a ride home at 3am. This is one beer that has achieved perfect drinkability  I was skeptical about this beer's ability to live up to the hype. While it's not quite that good, it's definitely an amazing beer.

The clarity is pretty impressive considering that it is such a thick brew.  Smell: Honey and floral hops. Some phenols are present along with a bit of malt.  Taste: Flavor comes at the palate all at once and leaves in layers. Sweet honey, malts, layers of different hops and a bitter finish. Leaves the mouth bitter and a little dry... Exceptionally balanced.  Drinkability: I'm a hop-head and I just got my fix.

287,17112,mattgreger,4.9,"Got one of the last bottles from Eulogy, in Old City, Philadelphia.  This brew poured with an amazing golden orange color. It was decently clear, but had a slight haze. It had a great big, very sudsy off white head. There was some amazing lacing left on the glass, as I consumed the brew.  The grapefruit and pine notes at the front are very present. These are the strong flavors you smell as you pour from bottle to glass. At the end of the brew, there is a great honey aroma that finishes everything off very well.  The namesake of this brew is present, right after your first sip. Its a power slam of hops in the mouth. Its a huge punch of hops up front, with a great floral and citrus hop flavor. The malt follows, with and hits as the alcohol rushes around the taste buds and gives that wonderful warming feeling. The sweet flavors of the honey, balance out the hops and give the beer an incredible complexity.  The mouthful of this brew is amazing as well. This brew is so smooth and goes down so well. For a being a beer geek, as well as a hop head at heart, I love this beer. The touch of honey and alcohol punch, make the mouthful great. It also has a great carbonation. It leaves a wonderfully dry, piney aftertaste. Its great.  I loved the drinkability of this brew. The aroma/flavor of this brew is amazing and has me fishing for more. The down fall is more then two of these brews, would put you out fast at 10.0% ABV. Other then that, its amazing.

The head retention sinks into a thin, but constant layer and leaves large swaths of lacing. The body is a clear, bright orange body. The sigh of steady carbonation is present.  S: The aroma is a blend of piny, citrus blasts. A very floral aroma and one that projects and nice use of hops. A bit of fresh hops mask the aroma of any malts.  T/M: The front is a cutting bite of hops that have strong resin characters. The body opens up to a complex layer of hop flavor, I find this too be many different sweet, citrus hops, no real grapefruit or passion fruits. This is a long body, that has a piny zing on the mouthfeel. The finish is warm and pleasant and leave a waxy coat in the mouth.  D: This is an all around great IIPA, one that can be drank in session, but damn so good, best to savor. The first time I had this brew it was from a friend who had a year old one in the fridge, so good.

Has an off white two finger head and sheets of lacing down the sides. Small carbonation bubbles are released from the bottom.  S: Lots of hops as expected. A lot of pine/woodsy aroma while the citrus plays a lesser role. I do get some grapefruit and the honey used in brewing gives it a slight sweetness.  T: Less pine on the flavor profile than expected, much heavier with citrus (grapefruit and orange) and floral flavors. The honey adds a very nice sweetness. Extremely well balanced.  M/D: Medium bodied with nice carbonation. Has a very nice finish, slightly bitter and sweet at the same time. You get a hint that it is 10%, but its not a bad thing.

287,17112,Dhren1979,4.58,"Vintage (2011) Actually bottled on my birthday...perhaps a late present?  Serving Type: 12oz bottle poured into a tulip glass.  A: Pours a golden orange..almost apple juice-like in color. About 1/8'' head on this, but lacing is very strong with this brew.  S: Sweet, grapefuit aroma. Then hints of piney, bitterness kick in at the end.  T: Massively bitter when it hits my tongue...possibliy a slight burn(?) However, not a bad burn at all! Very interesting! So creamy; which, in my opinion, is what makes this beer stand alone as one of the great hop bombs of the craft beer world!  M: Feels much bigger than anticipated. Very creamy on my tongue! Love it!  D: Damn! Damn! I was dead wrong with this beer! I didn't want to believe the hype that preceded this but the other BA's were absolutely correct. I wish I had more than a 6'er!!",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",Imperial IPA,98
287,17112,BBP,4.66,"A- Pours a golden orange with decent carbonation and little to no head regardless of how I pour it. Laces well though.  S- Hop-damn.. Probably one of the nicest smelling DIPA's out there. It doesn't have the piercing bitterness to the nose that some do or potency if you will, but it does have a nice crisp hop aroma. The honey is great as well. It smells balanced somehow even with the heavy load of hops.  T- For the most part, pine comes out on top from the beginning. The honey seems to come out a little after the initial hop flavor even though I found that it subsided after a little bit. There's a ton of hop flavor to be found, but the honey seems to balance it all out. It's only after about 1/3-1/2 of the bottle before the hops really seem to take hold of the aftertaste. The honey is strong enough to provide balance, but strangely it never really takes the lead or falls behind. It blends pretty seamlessly. Sadly, I think the balance made me less of a fan of it. That being said, it still tastes like a superb DIPA.  M- On the full side. It's getting to the point where it's getting heavier and syrupy. If I hadn't had many DIPA's before, I'd almost think that the honey thickened it like this, but it's fairly common for brews of this ABV. The carbonation is spot on and works well for the drink, keeping the full body balanced. It has a slightly dry, slightly sticky finish.  D- Stupidly drinkable. I can really understand how people can go through cases so fast. I've heard that some people say they can taste ""heat"" in this from the alcohol, and I find the thought of this as boozy to be ridiculous. Perhaps there's a consistency issue. All in all, this is one of the easiest DIPA's to drink I've come across. The balance and smoothness to it all means that it could disappear quite fast. I can understand the hype, but I don't know whether I would go for a drive just to pick this up again. All in all another solid brew from Bell's.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",Imperial IPA,98
287,17112,walteez,4.94,"Served to me in a tulip straight out of the cask at Patton Alley Pub in Springfield, MO on 1/20/11  A: Similar to the bottle - a nice golden orange color, fairly clear but a little hazy. There wasn't much head to speak of but it was a busy night and I think it had more to do with the pour than the beer.  S: The piney and grapefruit notes are ever present - providing all the great smell I get when pouring from a bottle. The sweetness of the honey came through a lot more both in the smell and taste out of the cask.  T: If you think Hopslam out of the bottle is amazing, never miss an opportunity to have it out of a cask. The hops are still there but the honey is spot on perfect. It's much more present from the beginning of the taste all the way to the end. The beer is just a little sweeter all the way through and I loved it.  M: It doesn't fail to disappoint in this category either. The honey lends its sweetness well. It is INCREDIBLY smooth. A normal Hopslam has just enough astringency from the alcohol and hops to leave you feeling a bit dry at the end of the taste... from the cask its smooth seas all the way through.  D: In a packed bar with people lined out the door to get a glass... I managed to snag 3 (and had a Two-Hearted on tap while waiting for the cask to get tapped, just for good measure).

287,17112,Jeffo,3.81,"Got this at The Cracked Kettel in Amsterdam.  From a bottle into a snifter. Vintage: 2011 Drunk immediately after a Jan 2011 Pliny the Elder.  APPEARANCE: Pours a two finger medium off-white head with good retention. Medium carbonation evident. Color is a tawny orange, but more gamboge when held to the light. Head slowly recedes to a film and leaves some immediate lacing. A thin wisp remains and leaves some decent lacing down the glass. Really good looking brew.  SMELL: Milder nose on this one as well, but a nice one. Pale malts, with lots of citrus notes. Some pineapple, honeydew melon, and a slight grapefruit note. Light floral hops as well, but mostly very fruity. A hoppy creation for sure, but not as big as hoped.  TASTE: Some pale malts and a touch of honey or toffee at the front, along side some toasted malt and spicy notes. Citrus hops, some floral hops as well, and a good dose of alcohol at the finish. Big, bold and lingering aftertaste is full of floral and citrus hops, bitterness, and some spicy alcohol notes as well. From sweet, to bitter and boozy. Enjoyable for sure.  PALATE: Medium body, medium carbonation, and lighter on the palate. Creamy on the palate, though not overly smooth. Goes down fine with a bit of heat on the swallow, and finishes slightly mouth-coating. Pretty nice feel, though it is a little boozy for the style.  OVERALL: A solid DIPA with a somewhat unique profile. Hoppy and bitter enough, but also quite a strong alcohol presence that also gives it a spicy quality. Glad to have had the chance to try it, and enjoyed it quite a bit, but don't think this would be something I'd look forward to every year. Definitely worth trying if you have the chance, but not something I'd go on the hunt for.  Final Comparison: Both Hopslam and Pliny the Elder were decent brews. They both looked fantastic and were enjoyable in their own way. They were very different from each other as well. Hopslam was more balanced with a stronger malt presence, as well as a bigger alcohol punch, while Pliny was a straight up pine bomb. In the end, if I had to choose one, I think I'd chose Pliny, but there are others in the style I'd have first.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",Imperial IPA,98
287,17112,jfrank85,4.79,"Tried for the first time last night with a friend with similar beer tastes as myself. Figured id buy into all of the so called ""hype"" and try it out and im very glad i did! Out of the bottle it is a very clear tan straw color with a full head that slithers down to a thin line that leaves ample lacing down the glass, nothing too outstanding here, very common for this type of beer. This is where it gets exciting, this beer smells phonomenal! Catty whiffs mixed with tropical fruit and fresh cut grass that can be smelled from across the room. Now on to the taste portion of our trip. Fresh cut grapefruit and ripe tropical fruit makes your mouth water for more! Very crisp and refreshing, slight sweetness from the honey is found but malts are pushed back and hops take the stage. 10% is lost in traslation of bitterness, leaving the drinker to sip not because of its boozy nature but because it is so hopped up. Great beer well worth the ""hype""!",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",Imperial IPA,98

287,17112,dudemuskie,4.54,"Ahhhh Hopslam, how I love you...  Appearance- Pours a brilliant liquid gold color. Bubbles struggle to get to the top of this seemingly viscous brew to feed a creamy, tight, and persistent bone white head that laces beautifully.  Aroma- BRIGHT hops front and center with loads of zesty grapefruit, overripe pineapple, and a touch of light grassiness. Floral, candy-like sweetness with tickles of soft malt round out the mouthwatering nose.  Flavor- Honey-like sweetness has a delightful pillow fight with pungent, resinous hops all over the mouth. Similar to aroma at the start, but with more intense and pungent, almost grassy hop flavors into the middle. Viscous, resinous hop oils coat the mouth and a moderately strong bitterness creeps in from the back to the front of the tongue. Finishes sticky with resinous hops and a touch of sweet, biscuity maltiness. Intense, but in the best of ways.  Mouthfeel- Instantly feels bigger than it looks and the warming strength also reminds you that you are drinking a deceivingly strong beer. Medium bodied, but feels bigger with the hop resins coating every inch of my mouth. Just enough malt balance to keep it from being offensively hoppy. Feels like I just chewed on a fresh hop cone, right off the bine.  Overall- Incredible beer that really captures the flavor and aroma of bright, citrusy, fruity hops. The name is in no way misleading! The only thing misleading about this beer is its drinkability (for a 10% beer)!

F/M - Sweet malts, lightly bready with a big citrusy hop flavor. Moderately strong bitterness with a clean, dry finish. Light alcohol flavor is a little perfume-like. Medium bodied with moderate carbonation. Lingering sweet malty flavor with a touch of citrus.  D - This is a great, flavorful, easy drinking beer, but I was a little underwhelmed. I was expecting this to be a much more hop-forward beer, but it was a little weak compared to what I was expecting. Still a great beer though.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",Imperial IPA,98
287,17112,nataku00,4.32,"Bottle (2011 batch) poured into a tulip glass. Dark orange, mostly clear with just a slight amount of haze. Initial half a finger of large bubble white colored head dissipated to the surface of the beer, leaving a bit of lacing. No carbonation visible from the edge of the glass, though a little swirling forces some carbonation to move up before settling into nothing.  Nose is sweet citrus (tangerine and grapefruit), tropical fruit (mango and passion fruit), a bit of dank hops. Balanced by some bready malts.  Taking a sip, citrus and dank wet pine hops hits pretty hard initially, but fades into sweet fruits and biscuit, finishing with a bit of alcohol warmth. A light lingering hops bitterness on the back of the tongue.  Very little carbonation that barely tickles the tongue contributes to a slick sweet syrupy mouthfeel. Alcohol is definitely present in the taste and its warmth, reminding me to take it slow with this one.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",Imperial IPA,98
287,17112,pburland23,4.42,"Poured from a 12 ounce bottle into a snifter.  My first Hopslam experience. I'm sure Hopslam has been overhyped a touch, but I'm looking forward to drinking and reviewing this beer.  Beer pours a brilliant, but hazy dark golden amber with a very thin white head that did not recede to much lacing. The aroma is incredibly hoppy. It's piney and resinous, there is almost a locker room type of mustiness to it which actually smells really, really good.  The taste is aggressively hoppy, but not overly bitter. The hops are well balanced by the malt and I think the touch of honey the beer is brewed with. I love the piney, citrusy taste. It's smooth and delicious without being overpowering. It might be the best tasting and most balanced ""hop bomb"" I've ever had.  The mouthfeel is medium bodied and the light level of carbonation works really well. The drinkability is incredible. The alcohol is hidden so well, it makes Hopslam a very dangerous (and very delicious) beer.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",Imperial IPA,98
287,17112,MinnesotaRIS,4.3,"Bell's 2011 Hopslam from a bottle. Poured into glass gave a good amount of fine cell head that dissipated medium fast. Leaves clear head residue on glass. Thin white foam remains after.  Rich amber appearance, light with plenty of fine cloud that does not look heavy. Fine sediment from fresh hops on bottom of bottle that can go into glass.  Smells richly of hops - American varieties - grapefruit, citrus, some floral, banana. Not overpowering but pleasant to the nose.  Tastes of slight malt, full body. Fresh hops are evident, again American varieties but it is all bitter and balanced.  Mouthfeel is full and not thin. Aftertaste is bitter but overly so.  Very drinkable beer but I don't believe one would want to do so to extreme with this high ABV. It goes down smoothly. One would want to just absorb the full aroma of this beer. Bell's did a great job with this one.

S - hops, hops and more hops, but with a sweetness up front that is quite pleasing. I'm guessing that's the honey.  T - just as the smell indicated but with less sweetness as expected. I guess that shouldn't come as a surprise though considering the freshness and 10% abv. Really pleasant nonetheless.

Lacing is good while cold, but as it warms, lacing dissipates.  Smell is dominated by a pine hop profile. A nice honey sweet backing gives some balance, but this is all about the hops.  This one assualts your palate like none other. A strong, unforgiving DIPA. Piney hops from beginning to end. You get a nice sweet honey flavor in the foreflavor, and tries to follow through. The hop assault is only over after you get a return of hops from your gut. This baby bites hard.  A nice, somewhat creamy mouthfeel. Alcohol is super well hidden.  A great DIPA, and perhaps overhyped. Yet, it is quite good when fresh and well worth searching high and low.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",Imperial IPA,98

Aroma is goddamn heavenly, just ridiculous amounts of piney, resinous hops.  Taste is huge, juicy hops up front, hops in the middle, and bitter hops on the finish. This isn't called malt slam. But there is enough there to just stop this beer from going over the edge, and it definitely isn't unbalanced, as insane as that might sound.  Mouthfeel is full, good carbonation.

The head was creamy and off-white with 2 fingers. Strong aroma of crisp grapefruits in this, with a huge hop presence.  Taste follows the grapefruits that were in the aroma. Very bitter and strong with a boozy heft on the tail end. Tasted like a big carbonated grapefruit juice. I didn't taste the honey or any malts.  Mouthfeel was creamy and moderately carbonated, with a strong bitter aftertaste. I can appreciate what they've done in this beer but the massive bitter grapefruit taste and smell just really aren't too appealing to me.

287,17112,Wolfpack2005,4.41,"Poured into my Bell's tulip glass.  A-Pours bright amber color with a one finger head. Nothing really out of the ordinary for the style.  S-This beer has one of the most pleasant aromas that i have smelt in a long time. The grapefruit smell of the hops hits you right off the bat with small notes of pine.  T-The taste definitely follows the nose and opens up with a tropical fruity bouquet of hop flavor that seems to be dominated by notes of grapefruit and pineapple. That is balance with a light sweetness from the malts and honey. Leaves a slightly bitter alcohol aftertaste that you would expect a DIPA of this strength to leave.  M-Thin silky mouthfeel with a mild amount of carbonation that adds a subtle sharpness.  D-Pretty drinkable beer considering the 10% ABV. My palate says yes while my brain and body say slow down.  With as much hype as it received and how difficult it was to obtain it i was fully expecting to be let down, but surprise when i really enjoyed it. It's definitely a first class DIPA, however a bit overhyped (due to the ridiculous lack of supply). That being said i will still probably get up early and wait in line next year just to get me a 6-pack.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",Imperial IPA,98
287,17112,kk73,4.53,"Poured from a 5l mini keg into my glass. A huge thanks to dmunroe for this delicious elixir.  A - Pours a beautiful golden orange with a huge three finger off white creamy head. Head retention is very good and sticks to the side of the glass all the way down.  S - Lots of aroma when pouring from the mini keg. In the glass lots of tropical citrus hops combined with the malt and honey to give this beer a nice balance.  T - Taste is tropical and fruity, grapefruit, mango and orange rind and starts with a bitter hop bite. Balanced by the honey and malt sweetness. The move from bitter to sweet is sublime. Some slight alcohol detection, but thats good and lets you know its there.  M - This is a delightfully smooth and creamy DIPA. Medium bodied with an exceptionally smooth finish. Nice carbonation when poured from the mini keg. Not overly sticky and dry like some DIPAs can be.  D - This is no doubt a highly drinkable beer.

287,17112,ChugginOil,4.57,"This brew pours a cloudy, sunburnt orange with a fingers worth of head that rolls down the edges with each swirl. The nose brings a tropical hop jungle to your senses. Sweet fruits such as pineapple, grapefruit, and apricot are noted the most. The hop combination is blended so well that I'm now squirming, ready to take my first sip. The taste follows the nose like a shadow. Sweet fruits are awesomely blended together to create a mouthwatering taste that leaves just enough bitter ""crisp"" at the end. This brew is very well balanced and has a very well hidden ABV. HopSlam is truly the nectar of the gods!!

287,17112,Bonis,4.24,"A - Golden with a slight haze. Pillowy white head which takes forever to fade. A nice sticky lace coats the glass as I drink.  S - Loads of hops, as the name implies. Most are citrusy with an emphasis on graipfruit. I also get some tropical fruit aromas, maybe a little pineapple. Just a rich beer to smell overall, the malts even come out quite a bit. A touch of honey is notable. Ot's one of those beers that I just want to keep smelling.  T - I really don't know what to say here. This beer just has me baffled. I am normally not a BIG fan of the DIPA style and this one had me scared, but I really love this beer. It is not too bitter at all. The hops are huge in this one, but they're very fruity and have been wonderfully blended in the crafting of this ale. Additionally, the balance of this beer makes for a super tasty treat. It's sweet and malty and VERY hoppy and remarkably refreshing and delicious at 10% (which is well masked). I'm still curious as to why this is a winter release... I could dig having a couple of these during warmer weather.  M - Crisp, clean, refreshing. Sure it's a tad bitter, but it doesn't leave all of that in the mouth. Feels almost like an IPA. Take it for what it's worth.  D - This is one of those that you have to watch. If you plan on having multiple Hopslams in succession, you'll start feeling silly in a hurry. Very drinkable as a DIPA.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",Imperial IPA,98
287,17112,BucketBoy,3.94,"My 3rd BA Review!  L - Brilliant golden, transparent beer flows freely into my Southern Tier tulip. Capped by a three-finger foam head from the hard pour, with plenty of sticky, thick lacing that holds its form throughout the drinking experience, this beer could not look better. Just gorgeous!  S - Mostly light pine, sharp floral notes, and orange blossom honey. Undertones are a nice mix of lemon, sweet tropical fruits, cut grass, spearmint, and light malts. A bit of alcohol is perceptible.  T - This really is a damn tasty DIPA. Uber-balanced with plenty of depth and character to keep the mind working. Sweet light malts start with floral and pine hops, a subtle hint of grapefruit rind, orange blossom honey, a hint of sweet tropical fruit, and then a long, sharp, piney hop finish. I'd rate this a 4.5 if not for the alcohol coming through a bit too much.  M - Smooth, creamy carbonation that starts medium and finishes thin and a bit dry, upping the drinkability factor.  D - I could knock these back all day if not for a bit too much alcohol in the taste that also affects the feel. The 10% ABV also lowers this score.  Overall, one of the best DIPAs out there, primarily because it is so balanced - there is a lot to like and little not to like. No wonder people grab this while they can upon its yearly release, and I suspect that if it were made year-round, this would be a go-to DIPA for many BAs.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",Imperial IPA,98

Balanced relatively nicely with a bit of honey sweetness. Medium mouth and carb. Very drinkable, despite the lingering hop bitterness. 10%? Where?  Drinkability bumped when enjoyed in the back room before standing up in a friends wedding out of the minikeg.

287,17112,ibbjamin,3.1,"REVIEW FROM 01-26-2011 05:16:58 I last reviewed this in May of 2009, but later found that it was almost a half a year after bottling, so I attributed my high rDev to faded hops. I just didn't understand how everyone sweated this beer. Don't get me wrong, I love Bells, just didn't understand the Hopslam. Well I thank Dee from Bobby's Liquor in San Jose, CA for graciously hooking me up with a fresh 12oz bottle from the 2011 bottling. I'm tasting this one fresh and pouring into a large snifter to review.  Yields a small quarter inch head after a somewhat aggressive pour. The head dissipates quickly leaving little retention. Cloudy golden orange in color. Good lacing.  First smell impression: sweet, hoppy and balanced. Lots of hops with some grapefruit and pine, but these are held up with some hefty hops as well. Hinting towards an east coaster, but this one is a no-coaster! Honey sweetness also detected.  Taste is quite sweet with lots of balanced hoppy flavor. I do detect a bit of the booze from this 10% DIPA monster. I'm getting an almost off flavor of rubbing alcohol as well. Not so sure about this one, certainly overrated.  Medium body with good levels of carbonation. Long balanced hoppy and honey sweet finish.  I don't think the hops fade as quickly or noticeably as PtE for example. I also don't think it is fair to the best DIPAs to put this in the same discussion. They nailed it with their Two Hearted, but I'm in the minority to say they missed it with the Hopslam.  REVIEW FROM 05-20-2009 02:31:19 Paid $14.99 for a six pack of 12oz bottles from Discount Liquor in Milwaukee, WI. I'm reviewing on the last bottle of the second six pack I've drank in the last couple months, so I am rather familiar with this brew. My bottle has the numbers 8907 on it. I pour into a snifter.  Light, fizzy, off-white head of about a half inch after a fairly aggressive pour which dissipates very quickly. Cloudy deep orange/brown in color with some transparency. OK lacing.  Strong, boozy, hoppy, sweet and malty all at once. Sweetness of honey with a strong malt backbone and a healthy dose of somewhat subdued hops.  Sweet honey, light malts and resinous, oily hops dominate the mouth. Nothing is used lightly in this beer. As described on the back of the bottle; ""A biting, bitter, tongue bruiser of an ale.""  The mouth is thick and moderately creamy. Resinous oils from the hops lead to a long, long finish. Full bodied and very lightly carbonated. Goes down pretty smooth.  My main complaints are the lack of a real distinguishable hop character. The hops are overly balanced with sweet honey malt and the alcohol could be better contained. A good beer, but not at the top of its class which I am in the minority in saying. To me this would be a malt lover's DIPA of choice. At first I thought I did not have a fresh batch, but after purchasing a different pack from a different store that tasted similar, I ixnayed that idea. Ah well, to each his own.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",Imperial IPA,98
287,17112,Swimsum,4.3,"Got in a trade with DoesntMatter46, thanks again Mark. Bottled on 1/4/2011 so just under three weeks old. Poured into my Bruery tulip.  Pours out a hazy golden color. A half finger head emerges from the liquid that is white in color. Texture is frothy and settles to a very thin foam and mostly a ring around the glass. Held to the light it is a very bright golden color yet still hazy. Some foam is left on the sides of the wall but the lacing isn't thick by any standards.  As expected it is very hoppy. Nice herbal hop aroma springs right up the nose. There is also some nice citrus notes that comes though as well. It isn't dominated one way or another for which hop aroma stands out more.  Same as the smell. Huge hop presence in this one. For the taste it is bit more herbal hop. A bit of citrus flavor comes out as the beer is swallowed and this is followed up by some alcohol. There really isn't any malt taste to this to balance this and that is just fine with me. I love IPAs and DIPAs that are very hop forward. As expected there is a hop bitterness that lingers in the mouth after the beer is swallowed.  Medium bodied that is a bit toward the heavier side but it isn't as syrupy as some other DIPAs that I've had before. I really like this. Carbonation is pretty low. Even though there is some alcohol present in the taste, it really doesn't detract from the experience at all.  Well this is a pretty damn drinkable beer. I really enjoyed it being a hop forward beer and am really glad I got to try it again (I had it two years ago or so and don't remember it at all). Is it worth all the hype? That can only be answered by the individual drinker. For me, I really enjoyed it and would seek it out again next year.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",Imperial IPA,98
287,17112,vapodge,4.54,"Poured from 12 oz bottle into a snifter.  A - Nice amber color, thin head with moderate lacing. Had a few of these now, and can't seem to get as big a head as others say. Modesty, I guess.  S - Super fruity hops and very sweet.  T - Extremely hoppy, but not overly acidic - due to the honey perhaps? The honey is most present for me in the aftertaste which cuts down on the bitterness.  M - Not as much body as some other DIPAs I've had -- not good or bad, just sayin'.  D - Tasty, not the best I've ever had, but well worth tracking down once a year, just not every week -- too much hassle. Not too boozy while you drink (though the alcohol is there), but once you finish one you definitely feel it.

Seriously go slam your pecker in the door it's that hoppy. Grapefruit, piney, sprucey, feel like i'm consuming the forest here. It's a dry bitter end, the hops have nuked my taste buds, quite powerful. I like it and rather encouraged that it comes out once a year.

AROMA: From the second the cap cam off of this thing it was citrus! This beer is almost all hop with a touch, almost an afterthought, of malty sweetness.  FLAVOR: The first thing I taste is grapefruit and citrusy notes. A light honey sweetness and malt sweetness comes in to balance the beer out nicely, and a bit of a dryer finish. The shocker of this? Almost no alcohol heat from this 10% ABV hop-bomb.  PALATE: Definitely a full-bodied brew, but extremely well balanced.  MOUTHFEEL: Sweet, just a touch 'thick' like extremely thinned syrup, but very nice. Lightly carbonated, but the hops seem to just cling to every surface of your mouth.  NOTES: This beer is a sleeper.

287,17112,FernMaster,4.49,"Poured from the bottle into a tulip.  I can't believe I didn't review this beer last year. I had this for the first time last year and loved it, so when ""Hopslam day"" rolled around in Kansas City I was a glutton and purchased an entire case. Now I'm starting to rethink that decision, not for monetary reasons, it's just a lot of beer to drink when it's on a 24 style ticker. I have two bottles from last year I'm holding onto for another year before I try one and I'm saving two more (probably no more) from this year to do the same thing. If you're reading this review or any of these reviews, you're probably drinking or have just drank a Hopslam. You know how awesome it is. If you missed out this year, I'd bet you're not reading these reviews because why would you want to tease yourself?  I'm going to touch on smell first. When you pour this beer the first thing you notice is not the color, not the pour, but the freaking nose. Hopslam is strong! Several feet back you can smell this beer. This big bold flowery, grapes(!), pineapple, honey, hoppy grapefruit nose. It makes my eyes water if I sniff too hard. Weird sentence. I can pick up a hint of the alcohol on the nose, but siting at 10% I'm sure I'm not the only one.  Now to the appearance. Hopslam looks like pissed off apple juice. It has a very nice golden amber color. Amber seems right. There's some head, almost a finger that resides quickly but there's some very nice lacing on the glass as you drink it.  If you could taste the music while listening to Pink Floyd's album ""Animals,"" it would taste like Hopslam. I can't improve on that.  The mouthfeel is a little too thick for me, from what I want from an IPA. It is Imperial though, so that's more acceptable. I like it though, if this had a weaker body it'd be a total mess. I guess I'm complaining while not complaining. It's very drinkable, as it should be since I have a case. I knocked it down a little for the price, because it's a lot of money for this beer. Also it's annoying that stores play with the mrsp, ranging it from 16-22. I fortunately got it at the low end, but I have a buddy who paid the high end. Also it's very heavy so you can't drink too many of these in one night. If you do drink one of these, make sure that it's the last or your first of more because when you drink Hopslam your palate becomes Hopslam, all becomes Hopslam.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",Imperial IPA,98
287,17112,321jeff,4.26,"Single bottle from batch 10127 brought back by Michael, thanks!  Pours a clear golden color with copper hues... or maybe it's copper with golden hues... either way it looks nice with a finger worth of soapy white head that fades leaving LOTS of sticky lacing.  Aroma is loaded with sticky smelling pine resin and some notes of citrus and honey. Smells good, but not the best I've ever smelled.  Taste is much more interesting and unique. The sweet honey really does a lot to balance out and offset the hops. I've only had Hopslam once before, but I don't remember the honey being quite so prominent. There's also tons of piney resinous hops but surprisingly, it's not all that bitter.  Mouthfeel is fairly thick and sticky with moderate carbonation. Very highly drinkable and unique with all the honey.

287,17112,JAXSON,4.14,"Fresh 2011 bottle. Pours a clear golden orange with a fluffy white cap. Nose is huge on pine, some citrus rind perhaps a touch of sap. Effective hopping on the nose. Caramel malt on the front palate, then a large wash of piney hops that lasts for a good 40 seconds. Hot on the back end. As with previous batches, this has an awesome nose but the mouth is a bit off balance. The hot finish is akin to a splash of vodka.  As weird as it sounds, the best bottle of Hopslam I've had was a 2009 batch about 9 months after the release.

287,17112,airheadmtrcycle,4.72,"I'm pretty sure I got the last 6-pack of Hop Slam in metro Atlanta. Thanks to Smyrna World of Beverages and the special guy (you know who you are) who put the last 6-pack away until I recovered from surgery. You earned my loyalty. I wish Hop City treated their customers like that.  Nice looking pour with a about 2 inches of head over a golden/orange ale. Plenty of lacing left by the head and ale.  Aroma of hops, grapefruit, pine and sweet honey. Taste is similar with even more honey flavor and malt on the palate to balance the outstanding hop flavors. I like the multidimensional flavors that come from the hops. I had a Hop Stoopid a couple of days ago which is also very good, but the hops are not as diverse and lean too much on the pine flavor. Hop Slam's hop flavor is more balanced and interesting. The flavors remind me of Two Hearted Ale bumped up a level or two. However, Two Hearted Ale stands up pretty well and is a great everyday IPA.  Medium mouth feel. Nice carbonation. Way too drinkable! I could drink all 6 one right after the other. Almost lives up to the hype, which is tremendous.

287,17112,SlowCentury,4.42,"2 week fresh bottle poured into my Bell's tulip  A: Beautiful golden orange hue that looks like watery honey. A half finger of straight white head slowly settles and leaves some light, filmy lacing on the sides.  S: Lovely hop hit on the nose, light floral but mostly citrus and tropical fruit up front. I'm definitely getting the pineapple. Honey is there too, and as this warms the alcohol most certainly makes itself present.  T: Pretty similar, citrus and tropical fruit. Not getting much of the pine character some people talk about. Hit hard with hops, right before the malt and honey (tries to) tame the alcohol, then they all fall back into place very well leaving a pleasant (and surprisingly light) bittering on the back of my tongue.  M: Just divine. Moderate carbonation, chewy, lightly syrupy but not overly thick. Seriously perfect mouth for the style.  D: Certainly not a session beer but sweet Moses this stuff is dangerously drinkable. I have no problem putting 3 of these back, enough to be sufficiently ""hopslammed.""  I've always loved this beer, and this year seems more important than others since it's not as available to me as it used to be. Bell's has it spot on pairing that citrus fruit flavor with honey. Classic combo, and bravo.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",Imperial IPA,98

287,17112,BirdsandHops,4.85,"Poured from a bottle into a tulip  A: Beautiful honey orange with a finger and a half of foamy white head. Head dissipates into a filmy white layer but clings to the sides of the glass  S: A boquet of hops--citrusy grapefruit and pineapple up front with some pine and an underlying malty sweetness to balance it out. Smelling this beer is almost as good as drinking it. The grapefruit aromas are even more apparent as it warms.  T: Similar to the smell--grapefruit and pineapple flavors first and foremost. There's some pine flavors in there along with a strong malt backbone that helps balance the beer. Wonderfully balanced with only a little bitterness at the end accompanying the grapefruit flavors. Again, the grapefruit begins to come through more as it warms.  M: Medium body with medium carbonation that accents the grapefruit characteristics very well.  D: Definitely a sweeter IPA, but that sweetness brings balance to the bitterness, making it one of the most drinkable DIPAs out there. Despite being 10%, there's no alcohol anywhere to be found in the flavor, making it very smooth.  Overall and amazing beer and more worthy of hype than many other hyped beers.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",Imperial IPA,98
287,17112,StoutHunter,4.6,"I picked up a couple of these at the store last week. I have had this beer many times but I have never got to try it the same month it was released. So let's see if this brew live up to all the hype. Poured from a 12oz brown bottle into a pint glass.  A- I like the Label on this beer and I like the new matching cap. This beer poured a nice golden color with an orange tint. It had a finger and a half of white foam that died down to a thin lumpy ring that left lot of nice lacing.  S- The aroma is all about the hops, its full of grapefruits and mango's with some sweet honey at the end. This beer smells like a fruit basket of citrus fruits.  T- The taste is pretty similar to the smell. The Hops impart tons of citrus fruit flavors that come together really well. I get lots of grapefruit with some mango's and pineapples. Just like the aroma you get a little sweetness at the end from the honey which helps balance out some of the bitter flavors and ties everything together.  M- Crisp and medium bodied with perfect carbonation.  D- This is one dangerous brew. Alcohol is hidden really well, it says it's 10% but it sure as hell doesn't taste like it. There is tons of great flavors in this beer that makes me want to keep drinking it all night long.  Overall I thought this was one kick ass brew and the best DIPA I have ever had. The flavors were super good and citrusy. Usually I find lots of DIPA's to be overly bitter, but this one was not. This brew did a fantastic job at hiding it's alcohol, but be careful this beer will quickly put you on your ass. Great job Bell's, this beer truly does live up to all the hype. With beers like this, Bells really shows why it is one of the best breweries in the country.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",Imperial IPA,98
287,17112,zhanson88,4.52,"Got this one as a extra from Dreadnaught33. Many thanks, sir. I can't think of a better extra to be sending. Batch code translates to a bottled date of 12/29/10.  Appearance: Hopslam pours a golden, slightly hazy color with highlights of light tangerine. Slightly over a finger of eggshell white forms. Retention is pretty good, and the lacing clings nicely to the interior of the glass.  Smell: There is definite grapefruit and dank hops on the nose. I get a bit of citrus as well, and I can really start to smell some sweet malt too. Very nice smell, I'm definitely looking forward to the first swallow.  Taste: Very in-line with the smell. A lot of grapefruit with minor citrus notes. A ton of dank, piney hop character. Very nice overall, and a treat to drink. After a while I really start to taste the honey-like malt sweetness. It's not necessarily a bad thing, it really balances the beer out.  Mouthfeel/Drinkability: The feel in this beer is hands down my favorite part. It's every bit of medium bodied, with fairly low carbonation. One of the few IPAs/DIPAs that is truly creamy and smooth going down. Overall, I'd say it's definitely worth the hype that surrounds it.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",Imperial IPA,98
287,17112,BigBlacke,4.32,Hopslam pours a light golden copperish color with a nice .5 inch white foamy head.  Smells of of honey sweetness with grapefruit hops. I also pick up a grass scent.  Tastes nice and sweet with a fruity hop presence. Not overwhelmingly sweet though.  Mouthfeel is a crisp sting of carbonation with a oily hop residue. Leaves a long lasting aftertaste.  Drinkability is not the highest for me cause of its high alcohol content and sweetness.,Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",Imperial IPA,98
287,17112,beer2day,4.82,"Pours honey gold in color. Comparing it to the jar of honey in the kitchen and it comes up a very close match. 1-finger head with a hint of retention. Nice lace coverage over the back half of the glass.  Nose is very strong grapefruit and earthy resins. I get the honey underneath but also get an oily quality on top of that. Very sweet.  Extreme bitters right up front. Oily texture with citrus and herbal hops. Lots of grapefruit with a touch of pineapple. Very thick glass with substantial body to back up the intense bitters. Oily finish, not dry at all. Still leaves a dusty aftertaste, though. I'm getting more honey about 2/3 of the way through the glass.  Alcohol starts to come in more as the glass warms. Nice burn setting in, both from the hops and the abv.  Definitely deserves the hype. A really great beer.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",Imperial IPA,98
287,17112,RossCain,4.57,"Poured from a 12oz bottle into a snifter (bottled 1.11.2011)  A: Pours a translucent dark tangerine color with a bubbly, off-white head. Oily little bubbles form all around the sides of the glass and stick around in splotchy, tight webs around the glass.  S: Loads of clean citrus upon more loads of citrus. There is no question of the hop profile of this beer from an arms length. Dominant notes of grapefruit blended with sweet tangerine with a touch of earthy resin. IF you try hard, you can pick up on subtle hints of honey.  T: A well blended, full flavor beer all the way through. The load of hops upfront gives off a major bouquet of ruby red grapefruit with a touch of floral notes and a certain resin character. The finish transitions into a well balanced sweet caramel malt backbone which is dried out by the honey in a palate pleasing manner. I was expecting an extremely bitter, biting finish but I was very pleasantly surprised how the hops, malts, and honey complimented one another in the finish.  M: Slick and oily on the lips/in the mouth, medium bodied, and dry with very well done carbonation that keeps the beer lively as it dances across the palate. The ABV is entirely innocuous and the finish is one of the most palate pleasing ones I've had from a double India Pale Ale. It just delicately fades away teasingly waving ""goodbye"" to the tastebuds instead of overstaying its welcome.  D: As previously noted by a myriad of others, this is one dangerously drinkable beer. Full on flavor, remarkably balanced, and one heck of a well crafted beer. I wanted to find faults with this beer given the hype but I've really been pleased through and through. Bell's Hopslam is truly a standard bearer of its style and a damn good one at that.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",Imperial IPA,98
287,17112,STEG,4.62,"A big thanks to Deadm8 and IDateTheFormula for sending me a collective 11 bottles of this.  Pours a clear orange blossom honey colored hue into a portsmouth brewery snifter. A two finger fine bubbled head emerges and recedes after about 30 seconds leaving small splotchy lacing around the edges of the glass.  Smell is full of clean, fresh, hops, some moderate alcohol, pine, pineapple and light honey.  Taste starts off with tropical fruits like papaya and pineapple drizzled with honey, and garnished with fine grated pine needles. Some alcohol heat and flavor follow making it know that this isn't your average IPA.  Mouthfeel is slick and syrupy with ild carbonation but still very light and easy drinking given the alcohol content.  I could have roughly 3 of these before I could taste nothing other than hops for the rest of the night, and I'd almost be ok with that.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",Imperial IPA,98
287,17112,shand,4.69,"Poured from a 12 ounce bottle into a nonic.  This beer pours a fairly transparent amber color with a finger and a half of head. Retention is about average, and lacing is great. The smell of this is great! It jumps right out of the glass and assaults you with bright, juicy citrus, fresh floral hops, honey, and just a little bit of earthy aspect that reminds me of the fragrance ingredient vetiver. Just a bright, lively, delicious smelling beer. The first flavor that hits the tongue is the bright citrus and juicy hops. This part is very well done. Then, to my dismay, the honey comes on followed by a bit of an alcohol punch. The honey attempts to mellow out this burn, but isn't quite successful, which does hurt this beer a bit. The trick here is to keep your nose in the glass after your sip, the hop aroma helps to overpower the alcohol burn making it tasty all the way down. Other than that, this is a very good DIPA though. The juicy hop flavors and bright citrus are just super well done.  The mouthfeel is near-perfect, it's thick enough to say that this is a serious brew, but not too thick like some DIPAs can get. The drinkability is also great, this is probably the most drinkable 10% beer I've had. I can feel myself getting drunker as I drink this, yet it doesn't effect the drinkability at all! How marvelous. A great DIPA from Bell's, these guys know how to use their hops. Get it if you can.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",Imperial IPA,98
287,17112,titosupertramp,4.67,"Thanks to Chuck's in Bowling Green, KY for carrying Bell's.  A: Nice golden color. About a finger and a half of billowy white head. Splotchy, sticky head that coats the side of the glass.  S: Wonderful smell on this one. Sweet and citrusy are the two words that come to mind first. I never thought I would describe a smell as juicy, but that's the way Hopslam smells to me.  T: Follows the nose as you'd expect. Very grapefruity, but the sweetness of the honey balances it out well. Sweet, then bitter, then spicy. Wasn't expecting the spicy there at the end, but it's enjoyable.  M: To be honest, nothing spectacular here for me. There's just a little bite from the alcohol, but nothing signifcant..especially for a beer w/ 10.00%ABV. Not as dry as you'd expect such a hoppy beer to be.  D: Very high. If you served this to an unsuspecting drinker and did not tell them this was a high ABV beverage, they'd never know.  Is Hopslam worth all of the hype? Probably not, but this is still one of the premier DIPAs in the country and one that I would go great lengths to seek out.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",Imperial IPA,98
287,17112,DKMonroe,4.97,"Looks great, it is brewed with honey and pours with the same color. The head is smaller than I would think, though swirling it produces more as it is consumed. Taste is .. well.. of hops foremost. Kinda sweet and fruity and the piney american hops.  Such a great brew to have it limited to once a year at limited supply. This could be epic if it were just more available.  Got this at the local beer store, and could only get my hands on THREE bottles. Guess it's better than none.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",Imperial IPA,98
287,17112,Kegatron,4.18,"On tap @ Al's of Hampdem (Enola, PA) on 1/21/11. Served in a Bell's tulip glass.  Pours a crystal clear copper, with a thin ½ finger of cap of bright-white head. Swirling keeps this rich in the glass (to a near finger) and throw up some thick foamy swathes of lacing which slowly creep down the sides of the glass. This has a big floral and spicy feel to it which is layered on top of sharp notes of grapefruit and pine. Tropical fruit and sweet malt are pushed to the background, as the hops mostly control this. I'm also picking up some alcohol heat that runs through the middle of the nose and takes away from some of the sweeter aspects of this a bit as well.  Bright hop flavors explode in the mouth, with grapefruit, pine, and spice ripping the tongue before being tempered with notes juicy tropical fruits, honey, and toasted biscuits. As usual, the honey totally makes this beer, as it adds a sweet softness across the back of the profile that adds to the general deliciousness of this. The finish is fairly aggressive with a bitter rind and spice that linger with a steady forceful dryness. The mouthfeel is medium to fuller bodied, with an easy soft crisp creaminess that sits on top of some alcohol beef. There is some definitely warmth to the body and it never does quite reach that stinging point, but it does get a little borderline at times.  What can you say, it's Hopslam and it rocks! I've had this many, many times out of the bottle but I do believe that this is first time that I've bothered grabbing some on draft. My only real issue besides the heavy warmth of the feel but that the nose seemed a little hop and alcohol heavy this time around. Still though, if you're looking for a DIPA that offers a little more than just a hoppy fix, this is great beer.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",Imperial IPA,98
287,17112,SFLpunk,4.62,"Thanks to qspandrew for hooking this up! A generous soul if there ever was one! 5L mini keg.  Pours a crystal clear medium amber with slowly exploding off-white head. Got 2 fingers out of a gentle pour. Lots of staying power and almost stains the glass with lacing.  Nose is sticky and lush with lots of tropical fruit notes, some floral honey in there for sure and it just smells like sticky buds (hops and otherwise).  Palate is wide and full of juicy hop oils, pink grapefruit, mango, orange blossom honey, pale caramel, and guava puree. Really fruity and luscious. Gripping bitterness is balanced by sticky malt sweetness. Ridiculously drinkable despite being 10% ABV.  Notes: A friend of mine described the flavor as being like ""fresh, juicy"" hops instead of ""boiled, cooked"" hops. I agree 100%. I'm tasting similarities in the Mid-West IPAs and the VT IPAs lately. Loving every juicy sip.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",Imperial IPA,98
287,17112,KBomb,4.68,"Rich amber color. About two fingers of thick white foamy head that clings to the glass. Great appearance.  Smell is bursting with a bouquet of hops: floral and piney. Nearly balanced out by a caramel and honey sweetness (reminds me of a particular brand of ""blackberry honey""-- distinct).  At first sip I'm taken aback by the dominance of honey sweetness, yet as it passes over the pallet a myriad of bitter hop flavors begin a dance on the pallet. Starts off piney, moving towards peppery, followed again by malt sweetness and a tiny bit of medicinal flavors, ultimately finished with just a straight up bitter hop bite (notably delayed, inviting another sip at a tempered pace).  Mouthfeel is quite dry, not thin and not thick, yet just a little sticky.  The label says this is 10%abv but I'm feeling like I just drank at 12-13% barleywine. Yet for as high of alcohol content as this baby boasts, its flavor is nearly invisible save for the slightest bit of warmth in the esophagus. Drinks like an amber ale, yet has all the flavors of an Imperial IPA blended with a honey bock.  Hopslam will probably go somewhere in my top 5 of all time.

A: This pours a beautiful and glowing transluscent golden-orange color with a finger of egg shell white foam that is frothy for the most part but also features large bubbled carbonation, excellent retention, and phenomenal lacing.  S: Pungent spicy hop aroma, fresh grapefruit and orange, coriander, and a strong, resonating floral smell.  T: Spicy and floral whole-cone hops seem to melt into a deliciously sweet citrus taste before finishing with smooth caramel malt goodness; sublime.  M: Despite the alcohol strength and strong flavors, this seems to levitate atop the tongue, never becoming too heavy, and finishes mostly clean with a bit of creaminess.  D: This is as close to perfect as the style can get.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",Imperial IPA,98
287,17112,Thanby,4.2,"Here we go, the Holy Grail of IPAs.  Pours a pale honey/straw color, crystal clear, with a big foamy off-white head that hang around and sticks like glue.  Pungent aroma, dominated by the bouquet of hops, with some grapefruit bitterness and a little spice in the middle, the honey winds its way through and pulls it all together.  First taste opens up surprisingly sweet, rich pale malt with the honey dead-center, some brown sugar, and the citrusy overtones again bringing grapefruit to mind and conjuring some esters. As the malty sweetness slides away, it leaves a big coating of hops that oozes over the tongue. I can't pick out specific varieties, but I'm sure there's a dozen. Balanced hops bouquet and some ABV vapors linger for a while, with the honey sort-of sneaking back in, leaves things a little sticky and the hops never completely fade.  Medium body with a sticky finish but balanced and mature enough that it goes down smooth and is surprisingly easy to drink. This didn't ""kick me in the face"" as much as I was expecting, but it sure doesn't disappoint, and is not for the faint-of-palate. An IPA connoisseur's dream. Yet again, Bells shows how high their quality standards really are with this gem of a beer.

287,17112,MADhombrewer,4.05,"Appearance- Clear, light orange. Off white head sits on top, but ends in a film.  Smell- Sweet grapefruit with a bit of malt backbone.  Taste- Tastes like eating a grapefruit after a spoon full of honey. There is a small alcohol burn at the very end. This one gets more malty as it warms.  Mouthfeel- Very good. At 10% abv you would expect this to have a much thicker mouthfeel. It gets thicker as it warms up.  Drinkability- I would be able to have one maybe two but no more than that.  Hopsbreath, again, hooked me up with two of these. I have had this before, but didn't think much of it. I didn't really understand the hype. I can appreciate a good DIPA, but when the ABV gets to 9% and more I get turned off. I will say that out of all the big ABV DIPAs I have had, this is the best.

287,17112,UnDeadly,4.39,"12 oz bottle, DFH  Appearance - Golden-orange color with superior clarity. Moderate foam with decent bubbles. Head retention is good, with moderate lacing. Overall it's good, but I think the foam could be slightly better.  Smell - Just the way an IPA should smell. Lots of floral pine with a few sweet malty notes. Strong, but clean. Not cloying at all though, which is easy to do in an IPA this big.  Taste - Excellent. Hops start light and floral early on, and the bitterness ramps ups through the middle and well into the aftertaste. Piney notes kick in near the end, and lingers strongly in the aftertaste. A true palette destroyer, and it hurts so good. Very little sweetness, which never takes front stage. Definitely the bassist in this symphony of hops.  Mouth Feel - Slightly creamy mouthfeel that is very appropriate for the style. Carbonation is perfect, brings about a spritz that does not sting.  Drinkability - Could I drink it all night? Well, not all night, I would pass out quickly from the sneaky-high ABV. Also rather expensive at $20/6er around where I am. But smooth for the style, and of course, very delicious.  Could go toe-to-toe with Pliny, as has been stated by many. I personally think that is the cause of all the hype, because yeah, it is comparable to Pliny. Hell, I would like to blind taste the two and see what I think. Great beer, would love to see it around more often...at a lower price of course.

Deep gold body, big foaming head (forgot to bleed the keg second time), significant carbonation rising up glass, big lacing. Nose is pretty complex for such a hopbomb, the honey is fairly noticeable in the nose, dryish bready malts, and big citrus with guava tropical aromas. Taste is more hoppy than the aroma, piney up front, honey and bready malts in the middle leading to a sweetish resiny, not bitter, finish. Mouthfeel is medium full, good effervescence in light of funky packaging. I could have drank a lot of this, but, heh, there were about 100 stouts that were calling my name.

There is a 1.5 finger white head that has excellent retention and lacing. Perfect for the style in my opinion.  S: Perhaps the weakest point of this otherwise solid beer for me. There's a lot of lemon zest, and maybe a little honey, but this isn't all that complex or interesting of a smell.  T: The notion that this is a ""malt-bomb"" as some have recently suggested is far from the truth. The hops far and away define this beer, however the honey does balance out the aftertaste slightly and greatly increases the drinkability. Still, this is a very hop forward beer and is very bitter up front. I get mostly citrusy hop flavors of grapefruit and lemon mixed with the bitterness.  M: What a smooth finish this beer has. It has near perfect level of viscosity. I would have liked a tad, but not much, more carbonation.  D: The balance in this beers gives it a very high drinkability. The flavors meld together well and leave me wanting more after every sip.

This has a HUGE nose...I can smell this from a few feet away! Loads of citrus fruits, pineapple and mango, most notably. Hints of sweetness, probably from the honey, are also present. This is probably one of the best, if not the best, smelling DIPA I've ever had.  Like the nose, the taste is loaded with citrus fruits...hints of pineapple and grapefruit dominate. Again, there is a hint of sweetness and just enough malt to balance it out. There is a bit of alcohol heat on the tail end, but not enough to detract from this delicious brew.  Medium body with above average carbonation. Very smooth and enjoyable.  Ridiculously drinkable given the high ABV. As mentioned, a hint of alcohol heat is present on the back end, but other than that, the alcohol is hidden very well.

T Sweetness up front, low astringency that is a bit surprising based on the high hop aroma. Sweetness needs some additional drying to be balanced. Either less malt, or more honey/candi sugar would be in order to dry the sweetness. Otherwise a very good beer.

The beer was a little hazy but got clearer as it warmed up. A good looking beer that would look even better in a narrower glass, but nothing lets you enjoy the aroma like a big snifter!  Aroma 4/5 Hopslam smells of balance and complexity: The elder brother of Two Hearted, it is strikingly similar in its mango notes, but is clearly sweeter and deeper, and different. To me, this ale is very good, but nothing as spectacular in its hop aroma as it is generally regarded. However, considered independent of style, this ale can compete with any other when it comes to aroma. The strong tropical fruit and tangerine notes combined with the strong and rich sweet notes lend the impression of fruit itself! It is readily seen that even though Hopslam is a Double IPA, it is cellar worthy. A wee bit of alcohol is noted when the beer gets warm. Soft, fruity, sweet and complex, Hopslam is an excellent smelling ale.  Taste 4/5 Very very fruity with the tangy sweetness of tangerines and the bitterness of citrus. A mouth coating, viscous, overwhelming taste experience that engulfs you and leaves with a sweet bitterness; however, a little too sweet. Yes, Hopslam tastes a lot like honey but that is not the most desirable quality in a DIPA, in my very humble opinion. Hopslam is hoppy and bitter but with a deep malt character. It seems stuck between being a DIPA and barleywine. That said, it's very good!  Mouthfeel 4/5 Silky and decent bodied, and well carbonated, Hopslam feels like THE DIPA except for the overly sweet finish.  Drinkability 4.5/5 All things considered, it is damn smooth for a 10% ABV beer! I only wish it were more aggressive and ass kicking!",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",Imperial IPA,98
287,17112,jorg2619,4.3,"This legendary ale pours a crisp clear apple juice light amber topped by a cap of pure white fluffy head that quickly drops to a lacy skim on the edges of the glass. Smells amazing sweet tart citrus all the way. I get oranges, lemons, grapefruit very nice spicy aroma with a hint of booze. The taste is an adventure tart obvious booze in front, intense citrus hops in the middle and a super strong bitter ending that coats the mouth and demands another drink. A very pleasant mouthfeel acts a as a balanced maybe slighty thick but smooth hop delivery system. I could really drink many glasses of this top notch double IPA. I had it last year and thought I could detect some sweet honey last year perhaps this bottle is extra fresh which blocks out everything but the mainstage of hops.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",Imperial IPA,98
287,17112,mechler,4.67,"Poured slowly in to a tulip glass as a baritone delivers an aria in legato in my living room.  Appearance: Hopslam has a delightfully rich golden color that I've never seen before. The color varies so much with the light behind the glass, emulating the familiar palette of cornbread. 1.5 fingers of head appear and creep me out as I try to figure out how half a finger can make sense. I remember the creepy bus driver that scared me as a child with his cut-my-thumb-in-half trick. An angel sheds a single tear.  Smell: There is no question that this is the wildest smelling beer that I've ever sat behind. I feel like I'm frolicking through a meadow of tangerines. Instead of grass, tangerines are piled up to my knees as I struggle to trudge through the tender fruit. My lungs fill with a sweet bitterness that pulls the glass toward my lips. A parachute opens in Hungary.  Taste: The first line of defense that the beer employs is a stiff bitterness that reminds me of my first taste of an IPA as a young college student. This time, I don't shy away. The next thing that happens is a rich, honey-covered goddess of grapefruit takes my tongue without waiting to see if I'm willing. A pineapple shows up late to the party. He doesn't seem to mind. He cleans up before my parents get home. A panda speaks for the first time. It has learned French.  Mouth: A set of bubbles works me over like an early 20th century trench. The bubbles feel more numerous than I am used to, but they are smaller and less ready for the tactile battle. The fluid in which they swim is thinner and dissipates evenly from the dark red surfaces I've employed as it's prison. Though it vanishes like a ninja, the taste doesn't seem to chase after it. It lingers, singing sweetly to welcome the next battle in the war that we wage. A thousand fireflies spell words in cursive in front of a crowd. Just as they spell ""marble,"" they transform in to fish. The lack of space between them causes the transformation to violently kill many of the fish. A man pulls up in a locomotive.  Drinkability: This beer is light and drinks very easily. The higher alcohol content suggests that you might not want to have too many despite that fact, but fear not, I've done the work for you. You can have several. They don't get worse. The food goes away, though, so you have to drink it without biting in to a tasty grilled pineapple at some point, and the cheese begins to harden as the surrounding air caresses it. Press on. The bees inside your mouth will reward you. A bit of lace from your glass becomes real and clothes you as you forget that you are a creature motivated by fear. Across the street, your grandmother begins a career as an illustrator. The life that you had is now trapped forever at the back of a cupboard.  Bottom Line: This beer will give you hives in your mouth. In those hives will live a thousand bees that will weave a series of sculptures in honey. The sculptures will be of fruits comprised primarily of rinds. You will peel back the rinds only to discover of more rind. It will mysteriously fail to frustrate you. Instead, you will be left loving the chore of shaving your meal for the first time.  Good luck finding another bottle. Look behind the bottles at your regular spot. Chances are that people are hiding the bottles that they don't purchase. I have no idea how I would know that, either, but you'll thank me as you gently fold the parachute in preparation of another visit to the bottom of the glass.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",Imperial IPA,98

Nearly 2,000 freaking reviews of a beer with an 'A' rating....a beer that has people flocking to the store like kids after the next Pokemon?

287,17112,harrymel,3.57,"Thanks to Chaney for this one! 2011 Vintage Poured to NB Globe  A: Pours a dull golden ale. Excellent clarity and consistent ribbons rise to feed the central cap on a film of creamy haze. The initial head of maybe one finger falls quickly. Spotty lace clings to the glass.  S: Sour pineapple, cotton candy, sweet peaches, hints of pine and hemp. Some of the sweetness feels like it's coming from the alcohol. Lots of different citra play around in there too. A bit too ambitious IMO.  T: Very sweet - due to alcohol I believe. The beer converges on more cotton candy sweet and melds with a healthy (but not enough) amount of good hopped bitterness. The malts here are subdued and do not even reach the hop level here. I understand they call this Hopslam, but I would take SN's Hoptimum any day over this.  M: Medium body and medium carb, the beer allows decent attention to the flavor profile while dispersing the aromatics within the body. Good job here. The ABV numbs just enough to tickle a want for more.  D: For a beer that people are totally nuts for, I think the hype has outdone the quality of the beer. I can't speak for previous vintages, which I hope offer the quality IPA apparently leading to the popularity of the beer. It's the right price point I think, but nonetheless, I think there are much better, more inventive Impy IPA's for the average beer drinker.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",Imperial IPA,98
287,17112,RBassSFHOPit2ME,4.25,"I'll begin by stating this is the 2nd year in a row I've traded for this beer and I figured after 2 years, a review is finally justified being that ""enough experience"" with fresh Hopslam has been had.  A - Good, caramel looking copper color and for 10% looks very filtered. Not at all hazey. A swirl retains head OK but not as well as you'd think with the reputation it holds.  S - a bit muted but tropical fruits and Honey dominate - malts very evenly balanced with hops. Very well balanced  T - Hops there for sure at the fore-front but honey very apparent. Sweet...but not overly so, the bitterness at the end evens this beer out and makes it easy to put down a few. Tropical fruits dance along the palate but the honey keeps making it's presence known. I remember this beer being more complex last year. Pine shows itself some but not resiny like most of this style like most WC DIPAs. Solid DIPA but I'd never say I'd been slammed with hops. Just a very good DIPA and very well balanced. 10% not detectable at all.  M - Carbonation is near perfect. Not quite creamy but for 10%, drinks like a single IPA begging for another sip.  D - Perfect 5. What 10%? Whoever said this beer is hot is crazy. Easiest drinking 10% ever. I'm thinking the Honey might play a role in this,  Final Thoughts - There is a lot of hype behind this beer. Does it live up to it? For me...ehhhh, I won't say no but I won't say yes. Again, a very, very good beer and DIPA and great example a balance but the honey sweetness and flavor take away from the pure showcase of hops that other beers display better. I HATE when other reviewers state there are better beers out there but don't name them. So here it goes...better DIPA's than Hopslam for MY PALATE - taste is subjective so don't get butthurt.  PtY PtE Alpine's Bad Boy Fresh Dreadnaught Citra DIPA Knuckle Sandwich (arguably but I'll give Hopslam the edge) Fresh Sculpin and Dorado from Ballast Point not better but easily a tie.

Slight sweetness, honey in nature, but not too much. M: Hops do not linger around on the tongue, very smooth, but the citrus (especially the grapefruit) add the bitterness.

An avalanche of citrusy hops up front with grapefruit and orange. Juicy pine hops add to the profile with crunchy bitterness. The malt bill is on the lighter side with some caramel sweetness.

287,17112,weizenbob,4.15,"12 ounce bottle, batch 10127 (bottled 1/11/11). From the all around cool looking label: ""A biting, bitter, tongue bruiser of an ale."" Poured into a goblet. The pour yields two fingers of fluffy off-white head atop a copper colored ale. There is mild haziness. Head retention is decent, particularly for a brew with this high of an alcohol content. Sticky lacing lines the glass beautifully.  As soon as the cap came of with a whoosh the aromatics of this double IPA began making their escape. This continued throughout the pour. It smells malty and sweet, and the nose quickly fills with citrus. There's the obligatory IPA grapefruit fragrance, but there is also some tangerine. Trace amounts of caramel are detected. There is not a big variety of aromas here, but what is here is very strong and very pleasant.  Two things strike me right away as I put the goblet to my lips and take the first sip: Hopslam is very malty, and it has a high alcohol content. But this is a double IPA; shouldn't I be gagging on hop intensity? Well, that's there too. There is a lot of hoppiness actually. I've heard the word balance used a lot in describing Hopslam, but I'm thinking that it goes beyond that. I think Bells has swung the pendulum slightly off center toward the maltier side of the DIPA style.  This beer boasts a sweetness that won't quit. There is a syrupy quality that coats the rest of the flavors. And yes, beneath that sweet sugary goodness is a beer that is also quite hoppy. Grapefruit is most noticeable. Spruce touches the tongue. Subtle orange dances in and out. Alcohol is easily identifiable, but not in a way that suggests 10% abv. The taste finishes with the clean taste of citrus rind that cross-fades to a bitter hop massacre as hop oils coat the mouth and tongue.  In the mouth, this brew is thick to the point of resembling pine sap. It's incredibly malty, and the carbonation is effectively low, allowing all of the excesses of this beer to shine. The alcohol adds to the heaviness; it is recognizable in the flavor profile and it burns ever so slightly as it slides down the hatch.  As far as the DIPA style goes I've only had one other brew that was more drinkable than Hopslam, which shall remain unnamed in this review (okay, it was Pliny the Elder). Yes, Hopslam has a high alcohol content. Yes, it's a hop bomb. But covering those tracks is a sweet malty syrupy teddy bear of a beer. You will not be sessioning this beer; I'm sorry to burst your bubble. It may not taste like a 10% abv beer but as I reach the bottom of the goblet, I'm definitely beginning to notice the alcohol content. That will be enough for me. The final verdict is that Hopslam is a well-done DIPA, one of the best actually.  ---  The Two-Schlitz Scale: (see my profile for an explanation) This bottle of Hopslam cost me as much as three bottles of Schlitz, and it was worth every penny.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",Imperial IPA,98
287,17112,nhindian,4.19,"12oz bottle poured into a Dogfish Head Signature glass.  I called my distributor earlier this week about this beer, as for Bell's last seasonal (Expedition Stout), the local Wegmans didn't stock any 6-packs, and the only good to-go bottle shop around me was selling them for $24. They expected to get cases in later in the week, but wasn't sure how many, if any, they could allot to people just walking in. He asked for my name, and on Friday I got a call saying they have a case with my name on it!  Batch 10115, bottled on January 11, 2011. According to Bell's Batch Finder at this time, this is the newest batch of anything to come out of Bell's! Hard to get much fresher than this!  A - Pours a tangerine color in the glass, pretty clear throughout with a modest stream of carbonation rising from the etched bottom. A relatively hard pour unleashes 2.5-fingers of white head, bubbling and rocky before leaving the faintest of caps several minutes later. Lacing is scattered but twirls sporadically down the edge of the glass.  S - The cap flies off and the kitchen starts to swell with the aroma of a citrus playground. Overwhelming amounts of grapefruit, orange, mango and even some pineapple flood the nose and make themselves right at home. For a beer called 'Hopslam', however, there was also a very pronounced malt backbone here that adds some caramel as well.  T - The flavors give new life to the nose and it certainly does slam you. The hops are alive and kicking, assaulting the palate with a barrage of bitterness and fruitiness, clenching your mouth with no intentions of letting go. It's citrus lasts well after the sip is done, but along the way the malts do help in taming the hops while adding a bit of smoothness. As it warms it melds better, but the alcohol noticeable pops as well. Actually, the alcohol comes through a bit too much on the back end for my liking, but this seems to be varied. The first one I had last night didn't have as much heat, but I really notice it more in tonight's. Hard to make a judging on that, but this specific bottle has a scathing alcohol bite.  M - Mouthfeel is moderately heavy with good carbonation. This beer takes coating the palate to an entirely new level, and my tongue feels seriously heavier after drinking this beer. A new, but welcome experience.  D - Drinkability is moderately high. I absolutely love the nose and initial flavors on this one, but the alcohol presence just kind of detracted from the back-end a bit too much for my liking.  In terms of the Pliny v. Hopslam debate, I'm probably going to have to pick Pliny. I appreciate the balance Hopslam tries to bring, but for me personally, I really like the pine/hopbomb aspect that Pliny brings to the table. Hopslam is great and I'm happy I have a few sixers, but I'm hoping more bottles are like my first where the alcohol is a bit more tamed.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",Imperial IPA,98

The aroma is chock full of the familiar hoppy flavors of grapefruit and pine. The flavor is very interesting. The hops are definitely there, and huge, but the addition to honey adds a sweet finish. It's dry, the hops linger longer than the honey, and you won't find better lacing.  Bell's Hopslam does have a ton of hops, but I wouldn't say it's as overpowering as I expected.

Not much lacing as I continue to drink.  S - Lots of citrusy fruits and sweet honey play together very nicely. Lots of hops, of course, primarily citrus but some pine as well (which comes out more as the beer warms up). I really like the balance of this nose - I can pick things out by bringing them to the forefront, but they're always so well balanced by everything I'm not not to pay as close attention to.  T - I actually get a lot of malt at first, followed immediately by bitter hops honey and finishing with a lot of citrus and some bitterness. Lots of citrus notes from the hops throughout the whole taste, with a wonderfully bitter finish. I'm not really picking up on the alcohol at all for it being 10%  M - The mouthfeel is great and incredibly smooth while still being very well carbonated. The best way I can think of to explain it is that it feels like the carbonation is tons of incredibly small bubbles, resulting in a nice creaminess.  D - For a 10% ABV this is really something. It's really very drinkable, and I just love how the sweetness from the honey mixes with the hops. Extremely enjoyable, and the incredible balance of all the flavors is what really does it for me.

As a hophead, I am probably biased but this really is an outstanding brew. Last season was not as good current season or 2 years ago but I enjoyed it last year as well anyway. This would be a good time to commend Bell's Brewery on another superb brew.  a - for the alcohol content, outstanding. Pours a almost-clear deep amber with white, two-finger head, heavy lacing and champagne bubbles.  s - maybe one of the most aromatic beers I've ever seen. You don't have to stick your nose in the glass either. Smells like a grassy field with loads of citrusy hops, grapefruit, and apricots. In fact, I'm gonna go grab one out of the icebox now.  t - a closed-fist punch in the face of hops. A little peppery but hides the ABV perfectly well. Hops from start to finish with touches of honey, pine, and apricot all the way to the finish line.  d - I would have rated this even higher but the fact is, you'll be slurring your speech before you get enough of this brew. I can't even say that's a negative with a true DIPA such as this.  Demand is heavy this year so if you haven't already, you'll want to try this.

287,17112,ncvbc,4.62,"From a mini-keg. I drank it when I had a bit of a cold. But alas, it wasn't finished in that sitting. Pours with a lovely billowy head. Bright orange, active carbonation. Chunks of lacing down the glass. Not surprisingly, it looks better here than poured from a bottle. The magnificent smell is there and perhaps even more potent. Fresh and inviting. Green lies underneath throughout and is accompanied by a piney, resinous hop character. A sweetness atop it. Light bready, biscuity scent. Taste is the tongue number that has always been Hopslam. Good balance of bitter and sweet. Bitter is the clear winner but balanced perfectly. Hints of honey do wonders. The finish is dry and tingles the tongue with its bitterness. Somewhat sharp. Before this, a good sticky, resinous sweetness melds with the hops. I could drink it religiously. I only wish to see this beer produced year-round.

The cask ran dry in 42 minutes and served more than 200 locals enthusiastic about great craft beer.  The gravity pour of the cask yielded a bright amber color with a thin lacy top (you get a much rockier off-white head off a keg or bottle pour). The smell, taste, and drink off the cask are much more subtle off the cask. Off the aroma you get a beautiful citrus and floral bouquet, but honey is much more predominant than out of the keg or bottle. During the taste you get: honey, grapefruits, hop oil, and a slight hint of alcohol. The hop oil increasingly coats the pallet during the drink. The mouthfeel off the cask is creamy and preferable.

Served in a pint glass, Batch 10093 (just over 2 weeks old).  Poured a clear golden yellow, with a finger and a bit of off-white head, light retention and solid lace. Nose holds a shit-ton of honey, pine and citrus in the forms of orange, tangerine and mango among others. Yowzers, mouth watering indeed. Taste follows suit, with the honey sweetness leading the onslaught, with the citrus involved being similar to that of the nose. Warming feel and great interplay between the strong bitterness and honey sweetness. Great mouthfeel, and if anything, maybe a touch more bitterness would put this over the edge for me. Drinkability should be a 15/5, likely one of the most dangerous beverages I've ever encountered.

287,17112,cjacobsen,4.67,"Pours a hazy golden color with lighter edges where the light bends in the glass. Nice foamy white head that sits for a long while.  Smells of hops and honey. It's got a slight light fruit, citrus hint to it. Really, it smells amazing.  The taste is a lot like the nose. The hops are well balanced with the honey, as the honey actually comes out nicely and it doesn't allow the hops to get the better part of the taste ratio. The citrus is in the middle of the taste and has a lingering sense. Really nice malt character as well.  Well carbonated but still a smooth beer. There is little carbo bite and a its got a nice body to it.  This is a fantastic beer. Out of all the double IPAs that are out there, I must say that this is the one that I look forward to the most.

287,17112,julian,4.73,"Received as an extra in a trade - thanks FullObs!  This is my first time tasting this beer.  Right off the bat, I can't believe this is 10%! It's hidden exceptionally well, almost too well. This might be one of the best DIPA/IIPAs I've ever tasted, regardless of the hype (which is a lot). It's just a really, really great beer. Sadly, now there's another Bell's beer I can add to my ""wish I could buy locally"" list :(  A: Copper in color with a slight haze. Minimal fluffy white head, with an oily, sticky lacing.  S: Awesome aroma of citrus, hops, honey. Not overwhelming but enough to make you want to not only drink the beer, but eat the bottle too.  T: Wow. 10%? Amazing. A most sublime harmony of sweet maltiness, citrus, honey and hop bitterness. Almost on the sweeter side than bitter, but excellent flavor profile. I love it!  M: It's crisp, perfectly carbonated and dances on your tongue. Even for a novice IPA drinker, this would go down smooth.  D: Perfect drinkability. It's waaay too easy to drink this stuff, and if I didn't know it was 10%, I'd be hammered in no time. But I do know it's 10%, and that doesn't change any.

287,17112,birchstick,4.13,"2010 vintage  A - pours a nice faint amber color with a 2 finger head  S - smells predominately of pineapple, some tart apples, grapefruit, caramel malt, and honey  T - There is a reason the label claims this is a tongue bruiser. Very sweet caramel and pineapple on the front of the tongue. As it goes down, there is a load of sweet honey and caramel malt, blended with a ton of grapefruit hop. Ends with a honey and pine bitterness, albeit the sweet caramel and pineapple/citrus combo is still heavy on the palette. Exhale leaves pine. Overall very sweet - I agree with the tongue bruiser statement.  M - a little watery with a decent body - not bad.  D - I always look forward to this release.

287,17112,Sideswipe,5,"Sent to me by the ever awesome beerbeerbeerbeer. Thanks Kevin! 12oz bottle poured into my Sam Adams perfect pint glass.  A down the center pour yields a two finger head of dense foam which recedes quickly leaving a white film across the top of the beer. Decent lacing. The beer is a wonderful, clear golden orange color. Looks great!  The aroma hits me as I'm pouring the beer into the glass. The smell of hops permeates my kitchen. Citrus predominates. Orange, grapefruit, and mango are all showcased. I can barely detect some buiscuity malt presence but this is all about the hops. This beer is a joy to sniff!  Taste follows the nose with huge notes of grapefruit, orange, mango, and pineapple. The signature sweetness of honey is present. Hoppy bitterness plays across my palate. There is enough malt to balance the beer nicely, but make no mistake, this is an exercise in hop appreciation. The finish is sweet and bitter at the same time with more citrus and a bit of pine manifesting itself. Excellent!  Mouthfeel is medium bodied with an perfect level of carbonation. The beer isn't sticky or cloying like some DIPAs. Really nice.  Drinkability is phenomenal for a beer of this caliber. 10% ABV? Really? There is no trace of alcohol present in this delicious concoction. It seems to fade into the harmony of bitter citrus, pine and honey sweetness.  I really like this beer. I traded for a case last year, and plan on trading for at least that much again this year, maybe more!

A- The appearance is a light golden to amber colored ale that pours smooth. Gave rise to about 2-2.5"" of nice think and creamy white head that never seemed to die. Clear to see through showing medium signs of carbonation.  S- Amazing. Lots of fruity and grassy smells. The honey has such a great way of making the beer smell not so bitter; kind of evens the whole thing out. A nice grapefruit and citrusy aroma.  T- The taste is sweet and bitter mixed so well. I get a lot... a lot of citrusy almost resiny hops they coat my tongue. The honey is easily noticeable. Citrus plays almost as big of a role as the hops and honey i think. I think they add a third dimension to the brew.  M&D- The brew is a little think but perfect to drink. It actually keeps me right at pace with how a 10% ABV beer should be drank. It is too easy to drink this beer, the only thing that i hate is that it will soon be gone. Its a shame to drink it.  ""Its like killing a unicorn.. with a bomb!""

A: A nice golden light copper color with a 1/2 inch white head that fades at a decent pace. Very good.  S: Smells of a nice fruity citrus upfront with hints of hop and some sweet malts quickly followed. A nice earthy texture in the middle with some hints of grapefruit on the backend. Good.  T: I get some delayed super dry earthy bitter hop. Some grapefruit and hints of grape flavoring in the middle. Kind of a bready malt hidden on the back. This is definitely super bitter and dry, but good.  M: A very nice carbonation feel. A super dry yet creamy finish. Very refreshing!  D: Surprisingly, for the ABV, this is insane easy to drink! Very bitter so if you like hops, then yes, this is for you.  All in all, this is a great beer. Super hoppy so only try this if you like the hoppy, dry, grapefruit taste.

It yielded 1/2 inch of white head with decent retention and tons of lacing down to the last drop.  Huge hop nose on this as expected, being roughly a week old. Lots of citrus and tropical fruits (pineapple, grapefruit, mango, passion fruit). Also picking up some honey / caramel notes in the nose, but very much overshadowed by the hop presence. What a great tasting beer, a nice burst of pineapple / grapefruit upfront, with a nice balance of caramel and honey in the middle, rounded out with a nice bitter / dry finish.  Medium bodied, adequate carbonation, resiny, and somewhat dry (especially in the finish). I get only a slight hint of the big ABV this beer has so you really have to be careful - by the time you are done with it you are well aware of it though.

A: Pours a glowing light amber with a thick oily off-white head that slowly faded into thick greasy film that left chunks of sticky lacing down the glass. S: Smells of sweet honey-drenched juicy tropical fruits and bitter tangerine and grapefruit. T: Overall really sweet and a lot more malty than the nose. Exotic fruits are still there, and the citrus comes out in the finish with a pretty substantial bitterness that is partially counteracted by the honey. I can detect the presence of thick alcohol and honey underneath everything. Slight tea or tobacco in the aftertaste. M: On the thick side of medium bodied with a smooth and fairly wet and clean mouthfeel with only a touch of syrupy alcohol. D: Trust me, this is damn fine with little room for error, but it is definitely not worth the hype.

Big citrus grapefruit, honey, other citrus fruit, bitter hops and subtle grape skin round out the nose. Hops are front and center on the palate, honey comes in right after that followed by a faint malt presence. This is very complex with every sip and perfectly balanced. Mouthfeel is almost creamy, perfect amount of carbonation, medium to full in terms of weight. Very drinkable DIPA, the ABV is not noticeable at all.

287,17112,PDXHops,3.13,"12 ounce bottle poured into an oversized snifter. See-thru light amber with a thick and frothy head that settles down at a slow rate. Lacing mostly drips back into the beer, but some sticky patches are left behind.  Plentiful fresh citrus in the nose- think pineapples, tangerine, mango, not grapefruit. The honey lends a light sweetness. Not particularly aggressive smelling, but pleasant. The raw power of the hops seems to be somewhat tamed, even in the perfect glassware to show off a massive bouquet.  The alcohol was remarkably absent in the nose, but it tastes pretty boozy, especially as it warms up. Plentiful juicy citrus til the swallow, where the hops take a turn toward grassiness. The light nature of the balancing sweetness- honey, taffy and toffee- keep things about as nimble as you could hope for from a 10% beer.  Kind of an odd mouthfeel. While there's a fair amount of bitterness midswallow, it finishes weirdly clean other than some lingering booze.  Overall impression: Fresh and flavorful, but lacking the raw, aggressive nature of a top-notch DIPA. Certainly worth a try, though.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",Imperial IPA,98

Pours perfectly with a two finger thick cranium, and has a nice golden and copper colored body that is cleanly filtered.  Aroma wise it's piny to the core. There could be a hint of honey, but I may be fooling myself since I see this is brewed with honey.  In the taste it's initially hoppy like biting into an orange and then suddenly dissipates. Then comes the honey and slight toffee hints, then the hops return to finish me off with a sharp and tart grapefruit kick.  A bit chewy but not over the top for such a high ABV beer. Warming in the middle to the end, so this makes for a great beer today due to STL being a frozen tundra today.

287,17112,Pahn,4.62,"12oz bottle into Duvel tulip. Batch 10101, bottled on 1/4/11 (17 days ago). Thanks to extremely generous BA mob2332 for letting me try this!  Appearance: Free pour yields a one and a half inch, fluffy white head that dissipates slowly leaving a few swatches of lacing. Pours a semi-translucent light orange and leaves tight and sparse but long-lasting strands of lacing.  Smell: Grapefruit, along with apricot and pear, mild apple. Dank. Some biscuity malt underneath. As the beer warms, the fruit smells only get fresher and riper, and the malt expands a bit, providing a nice cookie/biscuit background. Has that trademark ""top notch IPA"" hop potency that keeps IPA lovers reaching for the glass.  Taste: First sip: piny hops up front, followed by a semi-strong hit of bitterness, leading to a mildly boozy finish, with the citrus from the smell returning in a big way for the long aftertaste. The second and subsequent sips have a more balanced hop flavor up front (pine, citrus, apricot), and a cookie malt background that fits the creamy feel perfectly.  This beer is excellently balanced. It's like the best possible combination of east and west coast DIPAs; huge, limited but potent and fresh hop flavor, deliciously contrasted with just-prominent-enough soft malty flavors.  All that keeps this beer from a 5.0 is the (very) mild solvent booziness and the somewhat limited complexity relative to, say, Pliny the Elder or Squall IPA (the pillars of each coast, for me). These are nitpicking criticisms though; the beer tastes excellent.  Mouthfeel: Full side of medium bodied, creamy and soft despite the heavy bitterness. Just enough carbonation. As a delivery system for these flavors, the mouthfeel could not be better. Apparently the honey advertised on the bottle is responsible for the body of this beer. Its usage is brilliant, as the feel is perfect.  Drinkability: At first I thought I'd give this a 4.5 since I would perhaps prefer a straight ahead west coast DIPA or a complexity bomb like Squall. Really though, this beer kills it for ""ease of consumption"". I would buy this with regularity, at the bottleshop or the bar, and could drink it all night. It would be disingenuous for me to give this beer below a 5 for drinkability, because I can't imagine saying no to a glass of this, or ever having even the slightest problem finishing that glass.  Hopslam is an easy beer to ""get""; huge west coast caliber hops with a full-ish body and a strong (but soft) malt counterpoint. An excellent idea, executed beautifully.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",Imperial IPA,98

The taste is hops, a bit of sweetness, probably from the honey, and that's about it. the taste is kind of simple but very good. The hops are, admittedly, delicious.  The mouthfeel is medium bodied, and the drinkability is limited by it's high alcohol content.  After hearing all the hype, I expected this to blow me away. It didn't but it is a very good beer.

Hops win, here, and win big.  T: Not as bitter as I was expecting, but with a beautiful, rounded hop character that matches the nose exceptionally well. It's actually like eating a whole Cascade hop cone, but without the lingering, too-intense bitterness that entails. Perhaps a touch grassy--not sure if they wet-hop this at all. The malt is there just enough to let you know this is beer and not hop tea, and the alcohol is non-existent.  M: Just about right.

I could smell this guy before I even tipped the bottle up to pour it into my glass. Huge smell of grapefruit, pine, and maybe a hint of a mango citrus going on as well. Just an amazing smelling beer.  T: Hop-heads rejoice. Grapefruit and citrus hops rush in at the start of this, and are quickly met by some dank bitterness in the middle. This gives way to a sweetened malt backbone which shows up at the end to say goodbye as this washes away. I'll be honest, I'm surprised by just how present that malt-sweetness is on the finish. I've had limited experiences with this brew in other releases, and I don't remember picking up on a such a malt sweetness on the back end.  The 10% ABV is completely hidden here.  M: Carbonation levels in this beer seemed perfectly tingly and delightful. This beer finishes with a big dry-hop presence and malt sweetness, leaving your mouth dry and wanting more.  D: This is an excellent brew. I love the hop presence here. The only knock I have is that the malt-sweetness on the finish is more pronounced than I'd like.

S: The absolute best part of this beer is the smell. Divinity. Mango's and peaches, dipped in honey, with a nice hop aroma. The best smelling beer ever in my opinion.  T: The fruit smell comes through in the flavor. Peaches and mangos, a nice sweetness from the honey...and a pleasant alcohol/hop bite in the finish. Super smooth, and easy to drink. Floral, mild (very mild) citrus notes. Grapefruit. Earthy. Complex to say the least.  M: Creamy. Smooth. Biting as it rolls over the tongue. After it goes down the tongue is in hop-shock for a few moments.  D: Overall, I love this beer - but who doesn't? It's Bell's, it's a DIPA, it's an American beer fully realized. A delicious beer...but there are better DIPA's. And frankly, standing in line for it is absurd.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",Imperial IPA,98

The head retains extremely well, and bubbles dance up from the bottom of the glass.  S- Clean, crisp, sweet hoppy smell. Not terribly strong or complex, but well balanced. Piney, and touches of honey. A little booze too.  T- Beautiful balance of hops, and honey. Again, not the hoppiest beer or the most complex, but it's just so smooth and balanced. I get the majority of the heavy hop flavor off the aftertaste.  M- Beautiful. One of the best mouthfeels on an DIPA. It has just enough body, and a kick ass flavor.  D- I just plow through this stuff. I can't even tell it's 10%, as it's so easy to take huge gulping sips of.  Hopslam is something I now look forward to every year.

Appearance: Pours a very nice dark, dirty orange color. A faint bit of light red colors poke through. Turns a great golden color when held up to the light. Very clear, very clean. A thin layer of eggshell colored head reluctantly fades to a few blobs of foam along with a ring hugging the glass.  Smell: Strong, strong hop aroma, (duh!) very overwhelming, but very pleasant. Definitely more of a piney hoppy smell, but there is also some sharp citrus notes in there. Mostly grapefruit. I think I can smell the bitterness coming!  Taste: Nice citrusy flavors lead the way, grapefruit and under-ripe orange to mellow it out a bit. A maltiness is there as well, fighting to be tasted, and they add somewhat of a balance, but they don't stand a chance. A definite smooth sweetness, then some alcohol, a little black pepper in there too. The hop flavor is there throughout, killing my tongue with bitterness.  Mouthfeel: Huge body with high carbonation level. This beer is very lively while in the mouth. The bubbles really compliment this one. The appearance, smell, and taste are all very lively, and the carbonation level fits as well. (My first perfect ""5"")  Overall: At 10%, this beer is scary drinkable. This is a hop bomb, but the sweetness and malts add a much needed (albeit small) dimension.

Also had a decent head of about roughly one finger's worth  S - Lots of citrus and hop, maybe some pine. I pickup some sweetness even on the nose.  T - My first impression of this is how smooth it is all around. It doesn't not have the bite of a dreadnaught and does not overpower you with sweetness. Obviously there is a lot of hop here but not as much as I was expecting. A good amount of tropical notes with a slight sweet malt finish. This years taste more sessioanlable and less hot than last year's  M - Medium Body, Carbonation just right and overall not too sticky like some DIPAs tend to be.

The taste is pretty in line with the aroma, in that it is hugely hoppy with out all the hoppy bitterness. A medley of tropical fruits; pineapple, tangerine, banana, and coconut.

Pours a deep gold color with a good three finger fluffy white head that stuck around for at least 15 minutes.  Aroma is fruity hops and a tinge of alcohol. Some nice floral hop aromas make their way through as well.  Taste, as might be expected, is hops hops hops. Mostly grapefruit hops up front fading to floral and last but not least, that nice hoppy tongue coating flavor. A little alcohol in the first sips fades as my tastebuds become numb to anything but hops. Worth noting that the lack of bitterness is a great catalyst for the enjoyment of hoppy flavors.

It smells of citrus and pine with a lot of honey. Remembering last year's via the smell made me smile, almost laugh. Oh...Hopslam. I don't know where people are getting pineapple and other random fruits. The flavor is honey upfront followed by an entire pine tree with a pitcher of orange juice. I'm a fan, obviously, but this was WAY BETTER last year. It's well carbonated and goes down smoothly. This beer is very drinkable for the content. It boasts excellent flavor but this was FAR BETTER last year. It's not as powerful or strong or something.

287,17112,cadaugherty,4.18,"Appearance- Bright glowing copper pour with 2 fingers of fluffy off-white head. Good lacing.  Aroma- The citrus come first, but underneath there is a fresh floral scent that really makes it smell bright. There is some sweetness here more sugar than malt.  Taste- Not the strong suit. There is the hop burst (albeit light), a nice sweetness that is not sticky or heavy but bright (I know that word again), and a crisp bitter finish. Overall there is a lack of flavor here, just not popping the way I feel it should based on previous vintages and other DIPAs.  Mouth- Good, it coats but doesn't stick.  Drink- Highly drinkable, I feel the lack of flavor is partially responsible for this.  Overall the word that describes this from soup to nuts is bright. It looks bright in the glass, it smells and tastes bright, and finishes light and crisp.

I've never seen it for sale and our local store, Beer Run had a limited supply. So, sitting at my miserable soul suckling corporate job at about 4:30, my wonderful wife asks if i saw the last part of the Decemberists live show on NPRs website because they asked Chris Funk what his favorite beer was. That's when it clicked: I forgot to call Beer Run to see if they had got some Hopslam in yesterday! I called. They had about two cases left. So, with $50 gift card in hand (thanks in-laws!) I shutdown my computer and explained to my co-workers, who would never understand, this desperate mission I was on. I showed up to Beer Run with lazer like focus on finding this before the other turdbags did. To my surprise, there were a couple of six packs sitting on top of a case, so I snagged the max I could, which was limited to two per customer. I was to busy chit chatting about how awesome this beer is while the girl rang me up and didn't even notice that it was $20 a six pack.

A very present honey mellows the powerful hops. Herbal and citrus play very well off each other. While it is a super hoppy beer all the flavors come off very well balanced. The bitterness reminds me almost of apple juice.  Wonderfully smooth and drinkable. Has just the right touch of alcohol to help provide a kick to the flavors. It is lightly carbonated.

287,17112,rrski198,4.66,"Just thought I would begin this review by telling everyone that I just poured the beer and was run over by the smell of fresh pineapple. I wasn't even trying to smell it!  Anyway, here we go...  A: Little to no head. Big huge bubbles collecting at the bottom of the glass. Nice dark golden color and fairly translucent.  S: Wow! Pineapple, pine trees, fresh cut grass, lemon. Hops galour. Can't say I smell the malt, however, there is a nice sweet touch in the nose. The smell is just amazing without burning your nose hairs. Booze is there for sure.  T: Earthy bitterness up front. Extremely creamy sweetness to balance it out but that bitterness is still kicking on the sides of my tongue. My teeth are coated in a perfect sweetness. The beer smells of fresh fruit but kicks of earth and pine needles. I have to say the only thing to pick apart here is the booze. I realize it's a 10% DIPA, but the booze is getting in the way. I do like that it is making my gums tingle with the beautiful spicyness of the hops.  M: Big time carbonation, the bitterness makes my mouth quiver. The sweetness just coats the mouth in an oily bitterness that is absolutely awesome.  D: Ok, the smell alone should give this beer an A. The scent is definately the best aspect of this beer, however it excells in every other aspect of the beer. I am amazed that after the smell, the malty sweetness can stand up to the overwhelming bitterness this beer packs. Thank you Bells.

287,17112,Bluetrekrider,4.63,"Poured into a tall pilsner glass from 12 oz. bottle. Poured at approximately 45 degrees.  A - Very nice clean amber appearance. Half inch head that leaves behind nice lacing on glass. Good, steady carbonation but not overly done.  S - Definite grapefruit and citrus aromas with a hint of pine coming through. Not at all overwhelming but very clean smell.  T - Very smooth and drinkable. Surprised that it's so smooth for such a high ABV content beer. Grapefruit and pine are present with a distinct grapefruit type of finish. Not as bitter as I would have thought but does have some bitterness at the finish; but not overwhelming. Very nice finish.  M - The word that comes to mind for mouthfeel is ""clean"". It doesn't cling but is very smooth and reminds me a bit of Pliny but probably not as strong.  D - Very drinkable for a 10% ABV. It is something to enjoy by taking your time and sipping.  I purchased this limited edition beer from my local party shoppe two days after being delivered. They offered it in mini-kegs, full 24 bottle cases ($63) and sixers. The store permitted mixing a sixer with any variety of singles at a 10% discount, so I popped in two Hopslams and other singles of my favorites. As for the Hopslam, I would have to say the hype is not overdone for this fine beverage as it is truly smoother, cleaner on the palate and so very drinkable over other Double IPAs that I've tried (similar to Pliny the Elder). The beer geek at the store indicated that this year's edition is improved over last year's.

It dies down to a nice white ring around the edges but still looks fairly thick. Nice golden amber color that is transparent. Sticky lacing and legs.  S - Nice fresh citrus hops and a bit bitter. Grapefruit, pineapple, mangos and a bit of melon. The pine comes in a bit but not as much as the citrus comes through. Smells delicious!  T - Pretty fresh tasting, but the whole citrus smells are a bit dulled in the taste. Still nice flavors of orange peel, a bit of lemon zest, pineapple and melon. The bitterness comes in toward the finish with nice, although slightly dulled, pine notes. A pretty solid DIPA but I kind of expected more citrus notes in the taste. If it tasted the way it smelled it would be just awesome.  M - A bit on the thicker side. This will come from the 10%. Its a little syrupy but still good. The hops in this one kind of dry out the mouth on the finish. The zest and carbonation are pretty well present and are quite nice.  D - A nice DIPA. I had this last year when it came out and thought it was awesome, but ever since then I've had a lot more DIPAs and have something to compare this to. Although I really like it, I think I was expecting a lot more. Don't get me wrong, this is a solid DIPA, its just that there might be some other ones out there that I might enjoy better (think Abrasive.)

A nice, fresh hop blast, floral/ycitrusy/grapefruity and incredibly pleasant, w/a hint of candy sweetness in there as well. T - Sweetness, but not overpoweringly so, right off the bat, quickly mixing with grapefruit/orange rind hops. The hop ""slam"" is surprisingly restrained, but oh so pleasant and extremely well-balanced. The alcohol only announces its presence at the end with a prickliness on the tongue - it's particularly noticeable when the beer warms. The honey is discernible at the end as well, but barely and is quite pleasant. M - A bit of prickliness as noted from the alcohol, but other than that quite smooth. D - 10%? Really? Only taste the alcohol when it warms, and when it's still chilled, I could seriously chug this beer, it's that easy to drink. Kudos to Bell's.

T - Substantial tropical fruit hop flavoring comes through up front with pineapple, with a rich honey malt backbone, and finishing with a blast of resinous pine hops. I'm not sure how this could really be improved in any way.  M - Close to a full body with ample carbonation. Smooth, creamy, slick mouthfeel with accumulating hop oils and honey coating the mouth.  D - Wow, I never even got a hint of the abv. The use and execution of the honey to create balance is both unique and performed perfectly. The hops provide an abundance of flavor and while the bitterness is there, it never becomes overwhelming.

Pours a dark golden color, with a moderate head and gobs of lacing. Hops hit the nose first, with some honey, a lot of pine, citrus. The hops comprise the majority of the smell but it is very well balanced. Hops also come to the forefront of the palate, with the honey becoming evident halfway through the tasting. The hops really shine, and instead of being a simple but tasty hop bomb like a lot of other IPAs, Hopslam's hops are well balanced and complex. Pine, citrus, and earthier hops all make an appearance, and the alcohol can be felt on the way down and it is damn good. Mouthfeel is full bodied and chewy. Drinkability is outstanding, with the elegant flavor, perfect bitterness, and alluring appearance combing to make this one I just can't get enough of.

Oh, and there's that underlying honey/orange sweetness like a touch of sunshine. Perfect DIPA 5.0, easy to drink, and very hard to believe it's 10% ABV, that is until 3 bottles later...  Mouthfeel: Smooth and medium bodied.  Drinkability: Legendary? Perhaps. Yes. Again, it's 10% ABV? Very, very good.

S - Not so much ""in your face"" hops smell but I did get pine and citrus with a very well placed honey.  T - I couldn't believe how light the flavor actually was. Harsh at first making me think the IBU's were around 70 or 80 my palate adjusted itself. After the second pour the honey and hops played a symphony on my tongue. The malt base being the most complex I ever seen I could barley detect the ABV unless warmed but in my experience it was best served cold. Amazing.  M - It was pretty hard to get a feel but mostly medium bodied even warmed it was still very drinkable.  D - Wow it was amazing and worth every penny (which I kept telling myself in a drunk state) I could never imagine killing off a mini-keg within a few days time because just 5 put me under.

T/M: Taste is really just great fresh hops all the way through. Some bits of sweet honey at times in this one. However, the freshness of the hops really makes this a killer beer. Love the smooth mouth feel with its scrubbing feeling on the tongue. Great semi-dry finish doesn't overpower or make this a hard drink.  D: Love this beer! First year I have had it, and thanks to a great trader, I got my hands on this gem. The fresh hop character is amazing.

A few have blown me away: Widmer Brothers Deadlift, Bell's Two Hearted, and Bell's HopSlam (of course, I've had maybe a dozen IPAs in my short beer life).  The appearance is as clear as water but golden. The head is white and doesn't last very long. The smell, oh goodness the smell. It's beautiful. Grapefruit, easily. Also some floral scents that I think are a bit also like honey. A very smooth scent. Speaking of smooth, the taste is incredible. Same as the scents, a bit like oak, too, somehow. It might be the warming feeling. Speaking of that warming feeling, I can't taste much if any alcohol, and this beer makes me feel slightly warm all over. It creeps on me, though, sneaking in, making me take another sip. After several sips, there is that bitey, tongue-scraping feeling, but balanced well with the taste and the rest of the mouthfeel.

Dissipates fairly quickly and leaves some sticky lacing along the glass. Mostly clear dark yellow body that looks awesome in the glass.  This aroma is beautiful, the best IPA/DIPA aroma I've had so far. Hoppy grapefruit, tangerine, orange. The citrus and floral hops are prominent. A little sweet malt in the background.  The bitter hops dominate enough to make the flavors pop. Such a great blend of hops, it's really one of the most complex and deep hop profiles I've ever had. Add in the grassy, pine resin bitterness and you near hop perfection. The sweetness of the malt and the hint of honey in the background are the perfect complement in the flavor.  The mouthfeel is smooth, not overly carbonated. Almost TOO easy to drink for the abv. What a fantastic beer. A must have. It has risen to the top of my personal list as my favorite DIPA.

287,17112,rigdont,4.32,"The elusive HopSlam, we finally meet again. It has been too long, since our last encounter and yet it is a new rendezvous as this is our first time in a bottle. Now, I divulge.  A- Poured into a pint glass and yields a finger thick head. It is golden with a small trace of sediment floating about.  S- From the time it hits the glass I knew that this would be a pleasant experience as the smells erupt into the room. A strong smell of grapefruit, piney, and floral hops are apparent in the nose, one of the better hop aromas known to man in this one.  T- Alright, the nose of this beer is not at all deceiving as the flavor explodes on the tongue with an initial grapefruit/citrus flavor followed by a piney and slightly resinous aspect. I would not quite say that this is balanced by its somewhat sweet characteristics, but these are present. After a couple minutes of taking a sip, the bitter, resinous hop flavor is still there. This is a treat for the tongue.  M- The mouthfeel is nice for this beer. After not taking any sips for a few minutes, there is certainly that sticky feel that I do appreciate that comes from a more balanced IPA. Not extremely dry.  D- It is somewhat surprising that this beer is 10%. This is a beer that would definitely creep up on me. I could have at least 2 of these, but I'm sure that I could go further.  Excellent beer.

But I was pleasantly surprised to crack open a very balanced, yet hop-forward, slightly sweet ale.  Pours a just slightly hazy gold with a pillowy head, that you hear as much as you smell as it bubbles and fizzes into your glass. None of the floaters that I associate with most Bell's beers. Tastes of well-balanced hops (not too floral, or on the other hand, earthy), with a sweet honey finish, that backs right up to a bitter hop aftertaste, that is dry enough not to bother. Very good mouthfeel, again, balanced carbonation and its dry enough to mask the high ABV.

Very slight notes of honey and pollen that meld with a bit of an alcohol ester. Not much else here but a little more residual sweetness and hop resin. Fairly one dimensional.  T - there is a decent pop of hop bitterness upfront, mostly grapefruit, pineapple, and touch of sweet orange. The flavor of the honey is fairly apparent with a nice flavor of wildflower honey that balances the bitterness very well. Bordering on slightly too sweet, the beer walks a thin line between a sweet boozy mess and a well-balanced masterpiece. I really enjoy the flavor, but i don't quite out this flavor up there with the better DIPAs I've had.  M&D - the mouth is nice and fairly slick, but not too oily. Might prefer it a touch drier in the finish. The drinkability is pretty high for a 10% beer, but i wouldn't want to see what happens in the morning if i drink a number of these.  Overall, a really nice beer, but there are plenty of other less hyped DIPAs with similar qualities that can be had. Not quite worth the chase in the end.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",Imperial IPA,98
287,17112,GehenHerzog,4.5,"Let me preface this by saying that I had this with a 2010 Hopslam as well as a 2011 Sierra Nevada Hoptimum.  Poured from a 12oz bottle (from Brawleys, A HUGE THANKS to Mike Brawley who has always been incredible to me) poured into a Delirium Tremens Snifter.  A- A golden, hazy, orange with a finger white head that doesn't stick around but leaves a decent lacing on the glass.  S- It smells like I just squeezed fresh grapefruit. Awesome smell that just screams ""DRINK ME.""  T- Right upfront its Grapefruit and pineapple. The citrus hops shine and the hop bitterness is there as well. A slight hint of sweet malts and slight honey round out this great taste. A phenomenal complex flavor that you can't really improve much on.  M- Medium bodied. Silky, smooth. Solid.  D-The alcohol is evident, yes but it's 10%abv and it seems as if it is a 5%ish abv. Phenomenal.  So this is the first time I have had the famous Hopslam. I thought for sure (as posted in the forums) that it couldn't possible live up to the hype but it did. I will be getting as much as I can tomorrow to stock up. This beer is exceptional and I can't wait to have more. This beer is head and shoulders above the SN Hoptimum I compared it to.

287,17112,BS68280,4.12,"This years batch poured from the bottle into my DFH signature glass. Had this one a couple times before and I've loved it every time. The price sucks but the beer is great.  A: A slightly hazy golden orange with about a quarter inch of white head that doesn't stay around long. Leaves lacing on the side that you would expect from a beer like this.  S: Mostly pineapple and grapefruit with some hints of the high ABV with some sweet malt notes.  T: Sweet malts, maybe a touch of honey, pineapple and a little grapefruit. A little heat from the alcohol. Leaves a nice bitter aftertaste that isn't really there as much as you would expect from a beer that calls itself biting, biter. I would say it is sweeter then expected.  M: Silky and oily.

Nose is huge on grapefruit, pine and citrus hops! Sweetness from the honey comes through too, brilliant. Taste is bitter upfront, a hopbomb of flavour with pine needles piercing the tounge. Citrus and grapefuit, surprisingly smooth in the finish balanced by a wonderful malt profile. Honey is a great addition. Medium bodied, creamy mouthfeel, plenty of carbonation. The smoothness and balance of the hops/malt make Hopslam incredibly drinkable. Not sure I would have too many in a session though based on the ABV and limited supply.

287,17112,rpardon7,4.34,Quite excited that our local beer bar The Beer Trappe had this on tap. Poured a nice bright orange/amber with a very soft and thick off white head that did not want to go away. Smell oh where to begin hops fruity citrus hops some pineapple and honey with a hint of alchohol. Taste is fantastic sweet upfront with fruity hops and honey followed by a small malt middle with plenty of hops to bite your tongue. Finishes dry and crisp with warming alchohol and a boat load of citrus and cut grass hops. Mouthfeel is silky smooth with a nice body and well balanced carbonation. Drinkability is scary with this beer as it carries a 10 percent abv with it but is so delicious I kept wanting more...and did!,Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",Imperial IPA,98
287,17112,brewski09,4.72,"Batch 2011 10093  a- The beer pours from a bottle into a pint glass with about 1/2 inch of head that quickly dissipates. there is some nice lacing around the edges with a very thin film of foam left now. There is a moderate amount of fine bubbles rising throughout the beer consistently. The color is just slightly darker than yellow, with a red/orange hue to it, like it has a small amount of amber malt in it.  s- The beer smells of floral citrus, mild alcohol, and a subtle peach. A very refreshing and rich aroma that is quite pleasant. The only thing that would really make it better is more of it.  t- The taste hits you first with a mild alcohol mingling with what appears to be some fresh hops maybe. There is a lot of hop flavor and a moderate amount of residual sweetness left over. This is all well balanced by a great bitterness that lingers on subtly. I get the peach taste everyone mentioned, but very mildly and heavily mixed with the alcohol flavor.  m- The beer feels maybe a little thinner than i would have preferred. The bitterness lingers on the tongue in a perfectly balanced, appropriate amount I think. There is a certain creamy or frothy quality to the beer that I am really enjoying right now. The CO2 bubbles play well on the palate.  d- This is an extremely drinkable beer that ranks at the top of my list with other great craft beers. The 10% will get you in trouble as I am only halfway through one right now and I can already start to feel the ABV a little bit. Smooth, clean flavors, and a complexity from all those hops and grains make this a knockout that will be enjoyed to the last drop.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",Imperial IPA,98
287,17112,rembrant,4.54,"Hopslam's in town. Take a vacation day.  This does not quite live up to the expectations or hype...yet it comes damn close.  Look is a handsome deep orange but with no head. Quite a lot of film on the glass. Hazy. Looks volatile.  Aroma, a rich ripe fruitbowl of fresh pineapple and grapefruit,a wee bit of apple,like the old style Grimes Goldens. Theres a bit of caramel too.  Flavor Yum! Definite weave of Pineapple and Grapefruit all crispy and fresh ( it just hit town a couple days ago) with traces of the malt side. The malts are slightly toasty,caramel-toffee but are the backup band here. The honey appears as a subtle element of the finish with a note of pine. Real interesting how the pine + honey are so delayed,then step forward as the fruit leaves the stage.  Mouthfeel This is real good for an IPA or DIPA,pretty full and creamy,enough heft to match the zip and zing of the hops Hopslam also wins for aftertaste which has a long linger yet is not too strong.  Drinkability...Maybe the ABV is a bit of a limit,and the price is rather high,plus there's availability,plus it's a beer best very fresh....but..it's a beer you don't want to quit.

S: lots of grapefruit, blood orange, honey, honeysuckle flower, the malt is very sweet and reminiscent of birthday cake. Wonderful and unique.  T: the first bit to hit the palate is honey, quickly followed by orange, grapefruit, and pineapple, the middle opens up lemon curd, and then a rising tide of bitter orange peel, juniper, a flash of alcohol, and then what can only be described as sweet grass, finally to be overtaken by a nicely bitter, slightly mineral finish, with flashes of sweet honey and floral notes, all wrapped in a alcoholic haze. Wonderful.  M: medium-bodied, super-silky, almost oily at times, low carbonation, palate-coating.  D: This is a beautiful beer, and worthy of the praise heaped upon it by its devotees.

287,17112,johnbjaeger,4.4,"It smells like honey and hops, as opposed to just hops, which is a nice change of pace from other hopocalptic brews. Like the rest of this beer, the smell is not overbearing.  The honey comes back in the taste. A little bit of citrus and plenty (but, again, not overwhelming) of hops.  This is probably the most dangerously drinkable 10% beer I've ever had. That's probably the most exceptional thing about it, not to diminish the deliciousness of this beer. I just drained a bottle like it was a PBR. I am pretty sure I could clear a mini-keg of this before being rushed to the hospital for hop overdose.  This beer is a snake in the grass. It's that guy who wants to date your daughter and calls you sir, but you know what's on his mind. This beer will smile at you as it is stealing your wallet. This beer lied to me.

Thick foam head after pouring that capped quickly. Maintained a nice light head through out the entire drinking experience.  S: The nose is extremely sharp on this beer, as it should be. The hops hit you right away. Really the smell of this beer is great. This is the best smelling hopped up beer I have experienced thus far.  T: For me, this beer is all about the finish: the taste you are left with after you swallow. I get the malts going into it. Right after swallowing the hops bite in. Its great.  M - Surprisingly light. Leaves a very thin, nice film on the tongue, that holds the taste, and dissipates shortly after swallowing. Feels great going down.  D: Dangerously drinkable. For 10.00 ABV you sure can't taste it. I finished my two bottles with ease. It sneaks up on you too. I didn't notice it until I stood up from the bar :)  This is definitely a nice beer. This is the first really hyped beer I have tried (I haven't tried Pliny, Dark Lord, etc yet) so I really can't say if it lives up to all the threads or not.

The bitterness is present, but very balanced with the sweetness of the beer's finish. After warming up a bit the 10% alcohol is very present. Not in a boozy, solvent way, just a 10% way.

This beer is not as smooth to the palate as some others, but at 10% it is still perfectly fine. I could drink this beer very quickly, but more than 2 and you will be out for the count.

T: Tons of juicy, fresh grapefruit, citrus and a bit of resinous, pine hops to start. There's some slight tropical fruits as well, mainly pineapple and a bit of mango. Its hoppy, but there is so much of a sweet malt backbone, that you don't get destroyed by the hops. I think the honey really helps here. Finishes with a sweet and bitter hop kick that lasts and lasts. I don't think I've ever had a more balanced double IPA.  M: About medium bodied. Moderate carbonation.

287,17112,Gorgoroth,4.6,"Minikeg, hot off the presses, shared with BA mermatinger and several other dudes. From notes taken on 01/14/11.  Presentation: The HopSlam artwork is cool; the particular green color used looks badass on the minikeg. ABV and a short description of the beer are also present as on the bottles.  Appearance: Poured rather vigorously from the minikeg into my 24oz oversize snifter, it is a deep honey/amber color with an immense, eggshell white, foamy head. It is dense with great retention and beautiful lacing. Light, floaty carbonation bubbles rise and the three-fingerwidth head gently begins to settle to a soapy foam.  Smell: Hoppy (obviously), grassy, citrusy, with a bit of honey and malt as well.  Taste: Citrusy, zesty hops over the palate with a nice, malty undercurrent and a touch of honey in the finish. Perfectly balanced and delicious.  Mouthfeel: Crisp, sweet, coating, and bitter; a harsh, glowing bitterness lingers on the back of the palate from the resinous hops.  Drinkability & Final Thoughts: The beer is superbly drinkable. You'd never be able to tell it yields a 10% ABV from its smooth mouthfeel and ease of drinking. While it is very hoppy, it is not overwhelmingly hoppy like some other fresh IPAs or Imperial IPAs, which often renders those beers much less drinkable. In fact, it's not the hoppiest beer I've ever had, but it is certainly very hoppy in its own right. The important thing is that the powerful zest of the hops is balanced extremely well with notes from the malts and honey used. I highly recommend the experience of sharing a minikeg with a few friends, but I also had a bottle the day after this review and it was also great.

Smell -- Lots of juicy citrus, pine resin, and leafy hops. Gentle honey and marmalade sweetness underlying the massive hop presence.  Taste -- Again, lots of bright and juicy citrus, along with apricot, nectarine, pine resin, and leafy vegetal bitterness. Malt backbone of honey and orange marmalade. Slightly sweet, but still well in balance.  Mouthfeel -- Body is just north of water with moderate carbonation. Very easy-drinking.  Drinkability -- I really do love this beer.

The smell of citrusy grapefruit and pine stayed throughout the entire experience until the bitter (no pun intended) end. The taste was not quite as impressive as the smell, but it follows the nose.

Some faint cloudiness but not much, with a nice golden dark brown color body. This is a decent looking beer.  Smell is a big but enjoyable surprise. It's all aromatic hops, but extremely grassy, like a fresh cut lawn. Big inhales really bring this out and you get almost a chlorophyll buzz going. Honey doesn't come out first on the nose until after you taste it.  Taste is a big surprise. Sweet front but not syrupy, of honey first, then a giant hop play in the mouth, with a bit of a tangerine finish. Mouthfeel is a little dry, with a rooftop palate dryness. The honey addition to this really balances out the bitterness and distinctly improves the beer. Feels carbonated to some extent but it isn't as if something is playing in your mouth with tingles or gas. I think if it didn't have the honey this would not be as good. Also the ABV on this for 10% is well hidden and you can't even notice it.  A well done tasting beer that doesn't taste like a gimmick or a stunt.

Incredible carbonation, nice one inch head that left my glass nice and sticky with a lot of remnants of the foam. It smells like hummingbird feeder food. Just this sweet nectar mixed with the fruit aisle at the grocery store. Tastes incredibly grapefruity and kind of piney. The honey is not that noticeable but it is there. I feel the other flavors really outshine it. Aftertaste is a subtle bitter slam of hops. Hopslam has an incredibly creamy mouthfeel and it just goes down so smooth. One of the most drinkable high abv beers ever. We each had at least 4 and change and could definitely feel the alcohol but it does not get to be a burden.

287,17112,cetherid,4.22,"poured into a tulip  A.  A clear gold colored beer. About 1 fingers worth of fluffy eggshell colored head. Nothing really exciting but the head does leave a nice lacing.  S.  A beautiful aroma. A large amount of citrus (grapefruit, orange, perhaps a little pineapple too). The hops smell very fresh out of a bottle, just like Pliny does. Perhaps a slight pine aroma but this is definitely citrus dominate.  T.  A very unique taste to this beer. I was expecting a huge amount of hops all the way through for this being a DIPA. Up front I get the bitterness which was expected, then a lot of sweetness (obviously the honey) from the middle to the end. I taste a lot of pine and malts in this beer, nothing like the aroma. If there is any citrus in the taste, it's more like the rind of a citrus fruit. A very sweet DIPA, more than I prefer, but still a good tasting beer.  M.  about medium bodied with perfect carbonation. A slightly sticky/resiny aftertaste in this beer.  D.  Pretty decent drinkablilty. This does not feel like 10% abv at all. It's dangerously drinkable in that respect. It's a pretty hyped up beer and surprisingly, easy to get in my area currently. A little pricey, but I'm definitely glad I got 2 sixers of this. A great beer, but honestly, I'd take dreadnaught, sculpin, or a pliny over this.  I must admit that I like dreadnaught on tap more than this however it's much butter than dreadnaught out of the bottle. (maybe I've just never had a freshly bottled Dreadnaught).

S: Wonderfully potent citrus hops... very biting, yet it's much deeper than that... there are several hops varieties at play, amarillo and cascade for sure, and a bit of sweetness (the honey?) can be found lurking underneath.  T: For a beer whose bitterness is so strongly stated on the packaging, I taste his brew as actually quite sweet. I can't say that I taste honey specifically, but there is definitely a big, sweet, creamy foundation underneath the heavy hopping. Speaking of the hops, it's all there from the nose... grapefruit, drying pine... quite a pleasant aftertaste. Alcohol is also tremendously well disguised... Id' swear I was drinking 6%, when the reality is 10%. All in all, a large, seamless continuum from sweet to bitter.  M: As big as this beer is, Bell's has managed to keep the body on the light side, which I really admire. Carbonation is also perfect, and really drives the flavors into the palate.

More below*  2011: From bottle to Bruges hybrid glass  A: Clean amber in color, like the tail end of a sunset. The head was pretty impressive up front, with an easy 1.5 finger retention. Sticky lacing coated the glass.  S: Easily one of the most inviting noses of any beer I've had the pleasure to consume from a bottle. Citrus through and through - complex notes of toasty, fresh hops and just peeled grapefruit.  T: Hops! Bitter, smoky hop oil immediately attacks the palate and assaults the buds. A hot sauce type of tingling follows, as if eating a raw hop pellet.  M: Nice carbonation, though I could have done with a slightly creamier presentation. Rich and weighty in the mouth and on the tounge.  D: I can't sit here and say I'd have more then one or two in a sitting, as is quite a big beer that deserves to be sipped and enjoyed over time. I let mine open up over a few hours and didn't feel the need for a second.  Overall: I really do look forward to this beer, and it again lived up to my expectations. It is certainly worth seeking out, though I do honestly believe I've had DIPA's that are just as good if not (possibly) better.  DRINK IT FRESH - see below  2010: From bottle to Bruges hybrid glass  A: Exceedingly cloudy and murky. Not what I was expecting in the slightest. The head certainly died a bit quicker then the 2011, and the lacing was sticky, but not as abundant.  S: By far the biggest difference between the two vintages. Orange soda and honey. Zero hops. If blindfolded, I might say it had the essence of a Canadian Ice wine.  T: Certainly maltier. The honey really comes out. Reasonable hints of hops considering it's a year old, but nowhere near the level of the 2011.  M: Oddly thick. I can tell it has lost some of it's carbonation over the last 365, though it is certainly not what I would call flat.  D: Slightly above average. To be honest, this came off like a mediorce Belgian style Tripel as it warmed. Now I love a good tripel, but this wouldn't be considered one of them.  Overall: I'm really glad I kept this one around for a year to compare.

287,17112,klikger,4.14,"12 oz bottle served in a Goose Island IPA tulip  A - Golden with a slight amount of haze, small white head which shrinks quickly, and good lacing  S - Grapefruit, pineapple, and honey --&gt; floral hops and a little orange  T - Orange peel, pine and floral hops --&gt; juicy, fresh grapefruit, smooth caramel --&gt; bitter citrus hops and sweet honey  M - Decent carb, thick mouthfeel for an IPA, and pretty sticky  D - A sipper of a DIPA, but more than one is probably doable given time.  This is a tasty beer and much different (and better) fresh vs. aged. Although there is a hop barrage no doubt, the malts hold their own, and keep this from being as bitter as it could be. For me, that negatively impacts the drinkability and mouthfeel. That having been said, this tastes great and is definitely worth an annual purchase, if only of a couple bottles.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",Imperial IPA,98
287,17112,Barleythenred,4.92,Wow what a drink. I never thought I would want a beer all the time until that is hopslam. i wish i could fall asleep with it and wake up to it. Even with its high gravity there is no alcohol flavor to it. I want this recipe to brew for myself and never look back so when in the off seasons i can grab me one and feel great again and not just disappointed that i have to stock up on it.,Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",Imperial IPA,98
287,17112,chicagobeerriot,3.49,"Starts out as an undeniably great looking beer: crystal-clear gold with a thick pillow of foam that looks like you could rest your head on it and take a nap. Great lacing is created as the foam patiently settles.  Pine, onion and garlic take the lead on the nose. Floral and citrus peel are there as well with a bit of honey and flan bringing up the rear.  Mouthfeel is right down the middle with vigorous carbonation for the style.  If you're looking for a pure hop bomb, look no further. Grass, pine and onion launch a sucker punch to your taste buds, with just a bit of honey in the background. A deep, prolonged bitterness (fueled in part by some of the alcohol emerging) finishes with some floral flavors finally surfacing once the initial hop assault fades. There is no hint of discipline or malt backbone which is what diminishes this beer in my eyes. I prefer DIPAs that have complexity on both the hop and malt side of the ledger (such as Dorado, Abrasive and Dreadnaught). I love hops as much as the next guy, and this is well worth a try if you believe in hops uber alles. Just don't expect some of the subtle depth you'll receive in others of the style.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",Imperial IPA,98

287,17112,bubbaoyster,4.5,Beautiful golden color with a nice head and carbonation. Notes of hops all over the place with a complex body in the middle. The great thing about this beer is you can get a great hop experience without the bitterness and dryness of the hops at the end. The honey in this brew compliments the hops in a nice way.  I'm not sure I've had a beer like this!  Almost a West Coast IPA ( think Green Flash ) but with a smoothness imparted by malt/honey.  This is an exceptional beer.

287,17112,bballmj2k,4.95,"2012 Batch  Not as hoppy - maybe tastes and experiences with some great DIPAs over the past year have affected me.  Dominated by citrus but not as much honey or as smooth as I recall. Reminds me more of Maharaja - sticky, boozy and heavy  Still good but not earth shattering like my first time.  --- 2011 Batch  Nothing like first taste of HopSlam for the first review...  Growler filled at the ridiculously awesome Greenville Beer Exchange in South Carolina.  Gorgeous, golden honey color, streams of carbonation continuously coming off the bottom of the glass. Minimal head and lacing.  Sweet, indescribably fresh hoppy smell. Hints of citrus and honey, blend so well together.  First impression is an awesome hoppy ""hit you in the mouth"" feeling. Can't compare it to any other beer I've had. Malty sweetness takes over as the beer moves towards the back of the tongue, akin to DFH 90 minute but so much better....  Mouthfeel is moderate. Honestly this can be a bit overwhelming. The hoppiness can overwhelm (or maybe a Growler was too much), as can the sweetness if too much is consumed. Perfect degree of carbonation but the heaviness of the flavor profile can wear you down.  Scary drinkable. In no way feels like a 10% beer until you've had 3... Split the growler with a couple buds and easily could've had 2 more.  Was concerned the hype wouldn't match the beer but it sure did. Picked up a couple 6-packs and don't see them lasting very long.

287,17112,Agold,4.12,"(1/16/2011)  HopSlam is a bright, beautiful golden color with great clearness and good lacing. The smell was super citrus insane grapefruit tropical hops. The taste follows with a bit touch of diacetyl. But the diacetyl really complements the citrus and grapefruit hops. The mouthfeel is medium bodied, but really light for a 10% beer, probably dried out by the honey. Also frighteningly drinkable. Where the hell did the rest of it go.  4/4.5/4.5/4/4.5  (1/16/2012)  Over the course of the year it seems my palate has changed quite a bit. While the appearance and aroma are the same and I enjoy them a lot, I tend to prefer a drier IIPA, and I think the 10%ABV hinders that light, dry mouthfeel. That is not to say that it is thick or heavy, just not as light as I would like. The flavor, while very citrusy and tropical with nice hints of grapefruit and perhaps pineapple, seems a bit dull instead of the sharp, crisp hops I like best. Still a world class beer that I like a lot, just not the same high grade.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",Imperial IPA,98
287,17112,Chaney,4.38,"A: Poured an orange, peach, pink(?) color, with a nice finger or so cloud white head that stayed afloat throughout the session. There was a mild murkiness under closer inspection.  S: Fruity, floral, and tons of citrus (orange, grapefruit.... the usual cast of characters). I didn't get much honey on the nose, but I definitely detected sweetness. Maybe some honey will slam my palate.  T: Definitely honey now... of the raw variety. In the middle of the taste profile, I got a bit of peach (ala Sculpin). The booze heated up as I got into the session, but it didn't bother me at all. About the hops...ahhh... they ""slammed"" my palate as the name of the brew suggests. However, for my tastes, the honey washed over it pretty well, creating kind of a ""fruit o' honey"" type of treat. Of course it's not balanced... but who wants that anyway?  M: A tad syrupy, but that is what honey is all about. The carbonation was fine, and the lacing was moderate. I got booze, but it was of the candy-coated variety.

The pour left a nice 3/4"" head that had a bit of staying power as well as some nice lacing grabing at the glass.  S: I could smeel the piney hops as soon as I popped the cap on the bottle. After the pour it was an amazing aroma or citrus and pine hops.  T: Nice pop of the floral hops right off with the citrus coming right behind. Jus the right amount of sweetness added from the honey to temper the finish. The malt is very subdued but supported by the honey. A little bit of dry grapefruit in the finish, but very pleasant.  M: Very light on th epalate without an overwhelming carbonation.  D: Very high drinkablitiy despite the high gravity. I could feel the 10% kicking more than I could taste it.

287,17112,damndirtyape,4.15,"Single bottle (batch 10101) poured into a milkshake pilsner glass.  Appearance: Slow pour to keep the sediment out yielded a clear golden-orange beer with a thin white head. The head actually grew a bit as I let it sit. Lacing is thin persistent strands and dots here and there. Very delicate lacing in spots as well. Lots of bubbles moving up slowly through the beer.  Smell: VERY piney. It's like a fresh cut pine tree. There is a hint of something sweeter and citrus like at the very beginning, but then the pine comes right back and dominates. Good thing I actually like the smell of fresh pine.  Taste: Citrus hops blending quickly into a sweetness that must be the honey as it's not quite a caramel-like malt. It's almost sugary, but the more I taste it I think it has a hint of mild clover honey in taste. This sweetness lasts a bit and then goes into a mild grapefruit like finish....and then there is a lingering piney hop bitterness that blooms in the mouth about 1 second after the swallow. I think you have to be a real hop-head to like this after-taste, it's like solid pine concentrate.  Mouthfeel: Very good carbonation, but thick and creamy as well after the carbonation passes. Lots of lingering oil on the teeth though.  Drinkability: Well, it's a hopslam allright. That 2nd bloom of hops does slam the senses. This is a beer for sipping, and for me....well, I think it's too much. The alcohol is well hidden so I'm not noticing a buzz due to drinking it too fast, but the hop bitterness wallop makes this one a slow sipper, and the most I could ever have in one sitting is one of these. It's an extreme beer worth trying but I could not have another one again. Well, maybe with the right meal.

287,17112,sportscrazed2,4.23,Appearance: Dark colored orange with a medium head that leaves great lacing. Aroma: Piney and Citrusy with a hint of honey Taste: Very sweet for what I expected to be a hop bomb. The honey they added is the dominant flavor in this beer imo. A little citrus comes through as well. I'm not getting very much bitterness in the finish (maybe i got a bad batch?). Expected a very bitter ipa with a hint of honey what i got is a very sweet and balanced beer where the hops play a supporting role. Don't know if this is desirable in an IPA but be warned Mouthfeel: The high alcohol content is very warming. The mouthfeel is greak Drinkability: This beer is suprisingly drinkable for a 10% beer. This is very dangerous. I could probably drain a 6 pack of these easily but then I would probably die.

The smell is like dipping my head in a plastic bag filled with hops. The piny citrusy aroma is rather pleasant, in fact there is so much hop I can't actually smell the malts in the beer. The taste is most akin to drinking liquefied hops. I've eaten a soak hop whole and aside from the (only slight stronger) extreme bitterness this has the same flavors. I now understand why hop heads the world over love having this fresh. I'm not one of them, but hey it's still pretty good. I tried to get malt out of this and all I got is a more grainy pilsner flavor in the background. I can see how the hops falling out of this would cause problems. It's actually much smoother than I would have guessed for beers of it's style and type. But I have this thing against certain bitternesses.

A- Golden with a slight haze with a huge white head that is leaving beautiful lace down the side of my glass.  S- Grapefruit, pine, and even my wife who doesn't like the smell of beer said that it smelled good in her opinion. Very citrus-like hop profile.  T- Hops shine through and weigh nicely against the malts... which are more to the light side on this beer.  M- Very smooth and creamy fine bubbles. I think it will be interesting to see how this bottle-conditioned ale changed over the next few weeks since the bottle I cracked is only 11 days old at this point.

The body is a golden honey color with just a bit of haze and about an inch of fluffy white head that retains pretty well and settles down to a thin layer of foam. This smells perfect. I want a cologne that smells like this. The aroma is kind of citrusy sweet with just a bit of honey in the aroma that blends nicely with grassy, piney, bitter hops. Outstanding dry aroma with just a touch of orange zest to round out the aroma. Really a dry flavor to this, with a sweet honey caramel undertone to the grassy hop flavor. The honey is balanced very nicely, adding only a touch of sweetness to this. Feels pretty good in the mouth, but as the bottle says, this is a tongue bruiser with easy carbonation and big hop flavor.

287,17112,andrewinski1,4.44,"Thanks to a great BA (browna71) for the chance to have this one super fresh! Poured into a tulip. Decent head on top of a nice caramel colored body. Pretty nice clarity to this one. Haze is very minimal. The head is very white, not too large, about one inch but the large bubbles tell me it won't last long. It does leave behind very sticky lacing.  Sweet glorious citrusy amazingness. There is a nice blend of sweet and citrusy in the smell. I would say oranges instead of grapefruit. Very enjoyable. Really deep examination into the smell reveals a bit of sharp cheddar cheese aroma, but just a touch.  The taste starts out sweet. The honey is very evident in the start. The finish maintains a nice balance of sweet with bitter. Not quite the tongue bruiser I was expecting. Instead just lots of orange citrus in the finish.  Nice soft carbonation. The drinkability is aided by the reduced astringency (relative to other DIPA's). This might not be my favorite DIPA, but it sure is very very good.

There is a lot of malty sweetness to this beer, I'm not sure when they add the honey in but it definitely does something to smooth this out more than any other DIPA I have tried. A total hop bomb, but yet balanced, a quandry that I choose to enjoy rather than dwell on. Mouthfeel is thick and sticky. Feels like it will chew the enamel off your teeth (in a good way). Drinkability is top notch. I'm not a major hop head, but even I could sip this all night long without batting an eye. Truly a work of art.

287,17112,Dave128,4.57,"Had this on-tap at Pazzo's pizza pub for 3.95 for a pint. Great price considering the sixer goes for 18-20.  A - Amber bronze with some lighter golden notes mixed in. A finger head that lasts just about forever in the glass. An apparent ring of lace for every drink I took. Outstanding.  S - Wonderful nose on this one. Very fruity and sweet smelling. Very citrusy and floral. A great fresh smelling beer.  T - Follows the nose quite precisely besides the touch of honey that comes in through the finish. Very fruity and yummy in the middle. Bitterness is pretty intense but its a damn good bitterness that is still on my palate 15 minutes after drinking. It also tastes like I just ate a bowl of pineapple and grapefruit. Great flavors pulled out of this beer. Sitting in class now after a lunch break and I am itching for more!  M - What I would expect from a DIPA. So glad to be drinking this fresh and on-tap.  D - 10% alcohol? what??? You have to search for the alcohol in this beer. You'll feel it before you can taste it. I hope this doesn't sell out fast, I will be back many times in the next couple weeks to get a taste of this sweet nectar.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",Imperial IPA,98
287,17112,JohnnyChicago,4.55,"Sampled from a fresh bottle first, but this is from a minikeg; poured it into a Duvel tulip.  A: Beautiful, really! This is as pretty as a DIPA can get: perfectly hazeless honey colored body with a fluffy white head.  S: Hop. Bomb. Just a ton of hops here: grassy, piney, lots of orange and pineapple, honey is also present.  T: Follows the nose. Just a plethora of hop sweetness, tang, and bitterness. There is a cornucopia of hop flavours and the sweetness balances it out perfectly.  D: Way too drinkable; I mean it! The mouthfeel is downright creamy and their is no dryness from the honey, just pure balance.  Overall: The definitive no-coast IPA and one of the greatest DIPAs in the world, without a doubt. The balance that the folks at bell's have achieved with this beer is proof of their skill. Highly recommended!",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",Imperial IPA,98
287,17112,beertooth,4.22,"A not quite 10oz gravity pour from a firkin into a Bell's tulip.  This beer is a deep golden yellow with a few large bubbles resting on the surface. I wish the bartender put some distance between the glass and the cask to give the beer some more foam.  The nose is full of juicy citrus and ripe tropical fruit. Grapefruit pith, mango, sweet pineapple juice, sliced oranges. Without the head it's more subdued than out of a bottle or on tap though. Still, it is a great smelling glass of beer.  The taste follows the nose with waves of bitter grapefruit, orange, acidic pineapple, mango. Very bright and loaded with citrus. The bitterness let's itself be known, but it does not overwhelm. The malt bill is sweet, but not cloying. The honey does a great job of drying out the finish. Alcohol is hard to pick up on, but it's there. The bitter grapefruit coats and lingers after the finish  The mouthfeel is slick and still. It's almost chewy and quite sticky on he lips.  This is a great DIPA and I was really excited to try it on cask, but I think it performs better out of a fresh bottle or on tap.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",Imperial IPA,98
287,17112,gopens44,4.47,"A - Thick, fun, frothy head. Slightly hazy in it's golden colored goodness. Gold color was a lot like Black Hills Gold.  S - Probably the most intimidating essence of hops I've ever let slip up my nose. Cleared my sinuses like Vick's does!  T - Like sucking on pine cones this one was! I couldn't taste anything but the massive hop presence. No alcohol presence at all despite having a high ABV.  M - Smooth, silky and low to medium carbonation  Not something to pound for sure! Great tasting and smelling beer that needs to be enjoyed in moderation. I could probably be convinced to throw 3 or 4 of these back in one sitting, but that would be dumb.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",Imperial IPA,98
287,17112,FreshHawk,4.92,"A - Very crisp, clear light tangerine color with a large, thick, creamy, smooth looking white head with tiny bubbles. Pretty good retention leaving a thin, whispy lace.  S - Amazing hop aroma. Juicy grapefruit, pine resin, citrus, and floral aroma all present and jumping out of my glass. Very juicy and mouthwatering - essentially hop juice. A touch of sweetness and spiciness. Such a lovely aroma pretty much making me drool just on the first whiff.  T - Just like the nose suggested, hop juice flavor. Starts out with a strong cutting bitterness with some pine and spicy flavors. Some floral hop flavor then starts to come out segueing the spicy hops to the slightly sweeter grapefruit and citrus flavors. Some tropical fruit hops also make an appearance (particularly pineapple but others as well). Mid sip some sweet pale malt and slight sweetness comes out. Very nice balance to the bitterness, but in now way will it beat the bitterness out. The bitterness lingers after the sip with an amazing hoppy finish that lingers. Exactly what I want out of a DIPA, huge hop flavors with plenty of bitterness but there is a slight sweet balance.  M - Medium body closing in on full body. Great level of carbonation. Goes down very smooth. It just lacks this full viscous feel that I wanted. Just a little off from being amazing, but how smooth and creamy it feels and goes down, I won't complain.  D - Waaaay too drinkable for a 10% DIPA. Goes down so smooth and easy. This is such a joy to drink. Alcohol is very well hidden although it peaks its head every now and then. Strong hop and bitter flavors, but they aren't overwhelming.  Notes: Batch 10094, bottled Jan. 04, 2011. Wow this is just what I want from a DIPA. Don't know what else I can add. Such a great hop flavor, it is like drinking a wonderful hop juice elixir. All different kinds of hop flavors all show up. Just the right balance and goes down so easy. Such a joy to drink, if only it were made year round. I also love that the flavor lingers long after the sip is finished. Simply, I love this beer.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",Imperial IPA,98
287,17112,grover37,4.64,"12oz bottle poured into a DFH signature snifter. Got the sixer at Cairo Liquors for $20 (pretty good for DC supply/demand).  Appearance (4): Good looking bottle with a new hopslam'd cap to match the label. Pours a clear, dark gold or light copper with yellowish orange around the edges. A finger and a half of head dissipates to an almost covering layer of medium sized bubbles. Decent lacing, but nothing special.  Aroma (5): Sweet caramel and honey balanced by very floral hops. Very citrusty with tropical fruits such as pineapple and grapefruit rind. No ethanol.  Taste (4.5): Sweet orange and grapefruit up front and maybe a bitter, piney note. The sweetness hits in the middle with the strong pineapple followed by a strong honey flavor. The finish is just how it smells with big floral hops lingering in the mouth and a little bit of the sweet caramel backbone (though not a match for the abundant hopping) sticks around. The bitterness is most apparent here which balances out the sweetness, but it is very smooth and nearly imperceptible throughout. The flavors are even bigger on draft and match the enormous aroma, although the bottle falls just short here.  Mouthfeel (4): Medium-low carbonation which is perfect for the style. Medium bodied, not too much residual sweetness, just the natural sweet flavors from the honey and pineapple notes. The hops leave a floral feel in the mouth as well. The finish isn't West Coast dry, but dry enough for a 10% beer.  Drinkability (5): This is unbelievably drinkable for a 10% DIPA. There is no apparent alcohol. I could drink this beer and love every second of it all night long. Or at least until I hit the floor (hopslam'd).",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",Imperial IPA,98

Poured into a tulip glass-has a 2 inch head that settles down to a whisp the aromas hits you squarely in the chin, heavy hops of course and citrus.  Citrus, and spice, and very smooth for a 10% ABV, which is better than many other offerings with that same ABV.

Pineapples, hops, pine, orange, citrus everywhere.  Taste a lot like it smells. Tons of pineapple and a great hop profile. This beer really is just awesome. I would drink this year round if it was made.  Mouthfeel is just like an IPA should be  10% and you wouldnt think it had more than 4.

287,17112,Dreadnaught33,4.11,"Heres another review of Hopslam, I've been exploring re-rating beers from different formats. It's very interesting. I gave the tap version a 4.75, this is lower in that it seems less open in smell and taste especially, a little more one Dimensional especially in the aroma. On tap its very open and huge in aroma and not out of the bottle. The taste is still great but not as good as on tap.  A: Nice semi clear, active carbonation orange. Nice small head and good lacing.  S: A fruity hop smell with some dry biscuit malt and a little pine. Some honey coated alcohol comes through as well. Faint aroma, especially compared to on tap, but still nice.  T: Very aggressive spicy hops that I remember from on tap but offset by Honey coated malt character. Biscuit dry notes come though (honey on top) and a little grapefruit in there thats nice (not as much as on tap though). Some pine as well. Good stuff, but the hops are much more 1-D than the tap.  M: This is still great. Smooth and slick, great carbonation level.  D: Good stuff.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",Imperial IPA,98
287,17112,MowryJC,4.57,"Poured from a 12 oz. bottle into a tulip glass.  A - Slightly hazy deep gold with a finger and a half head that settles into a thick fluffy foam. Leaves bands of webby lacing down the glass.  S - Floral honey and citrus, mostly grapefruit. Complexity that moves into resiny, but always with that nice honey backing.  T - Immediate orange citrus and caramelly maltiness, with a nice almost almond extract from the honey. Hops jump in and out of the spotlight, fantastic citrus with a light pepperiness. Again the complexity is fantastic.  M - Has this wonderful alcoholic heat to it that is very, very subtle, and tied to the honey and almond extract flavors. Chewy coating consistency that is never cloying, and finishes just dry enough to beg for another sip.  D - Easily the most dangerously drinkable strong beer I've ever had. I would ruin myself on this in a night.  I was worried about the hype, but I cannot argue that this is a thoroughly enjoyable beer. It's a shame the price and availability are not more accessible.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",Imperial IPA,98

M: Medium body, good carbonation. Surprisingly, not a lot in the finish - but perhaps that leaves you wanting more quickly. My pint went quickly, wanting another.  D: The 10% is not even noticable.

287,17112,johntangus,4.97,"This beer aches for me to grasp at my tastebuds and limited vocabulary.  I actually reused my duvel tulip glass (gasp!) from my last beer, a Nugget Nectar. But don't worry, I'm not a heathen. I hand washed it, rinsed thoroughly and salted, swirled, scrubbed and rinsed again thoroughly. Let air semi-dry. Poured vigorously.  A nice half-inch tall head formed and then left what can only be described as krausen-like foam and lacing. I will not be able to reuse this glass again without a nice soak. Especially if I drunkenly leave it in front of my computer overnight. It is a cloudy golden color. The Hopslam that I had last year I remember as being liquid gold. Maybe after rough handling I have disturbed the yeasties. I see sediment. I am not worried.  When applying the nose, this is where the magic begins. Ahh, HopSlam, how I remember thee. I tasted your golden goodness last winter and stalked you like a jilted lover. I even attempted to clone you, but fell short somehow.  Although I have disturbed the yeast, your taste is unfettered. Grapefruit and orange juice. I daydream about calling into work and staying home and drinking six of you at 9 AM. And then calling in work to quit and then growing my beard out (more) and shunning all human contact unless they are bringing me more HopSlam. Or are made of HopSlam somehow.  I don't understand where they hide your 10% ABV. Maybe in between the OJ and the grapefruit? Is that where your honey went? You are a mystery, wrapped in an enigma, wrapped in a mystery.  This beer may have lots of hype surrounding it, but unlike most others, it is totally justified. To say that I would drop out of society and ruin my body to enjoy it everyday would be an understatement.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",Imperial IPA,98
287,17112,mountsnow1010,4.42,"Trying to stay away from the hype train here. Will be as unbiased as possible.  Pours a hazy amber with a super fluffy white head that leaves thick lacing. Smells of grapefruit as soon as I open the bottle. After pouring, I get a burst of grapefruit and tangerine, followed by ""pine,"" but it's probably more accurately described as a spruce smell. Loving the combo of smells here. I have to admit, I pick up the ""cat piss"" odor as well- it is a slight turn off (I've lost a mattress to cat piss), but only because I own a cat and have smelled cat piss before. If I had never smelled cat piss, it would simply come off as a pine odor. Tastes of grapefruit and general citrus. Somewhat resiny, perhaps pine tar flavor as well. This is followed by a bit of malt. And I get a bit of marzipan right at the end. Very complex flavor profile - picking out tons of stuff. I'm very happy with the flavors. Shocking lack of bitterness...still there, but not as bitter as I would have expected. Mouthfeel - Coats the mouth but pleasantly. Tongue-tingling as well. DB - Could easily have several, alcohol is very well hidden.  I really like this beer. I have to admit I prefer the smell of Heady Topper- This is not quite there...the tastes however are equally pleasurable. However, I had HT on tap and this in a bottle...If I get the opportunity to have this on tap I may just have to re-review.  Also - as far as flavors go - the marzipan flavor (perhaps from the honey?) is something that I really really dig.

One of the best smelling beers I've had in a while. So fragrant. I get citrus, pine, and spicy hops. Loads of em! This is accompanied with a sweet aftertone, I'm guessing the honey's to blame. Smells smooth and like all the flavors that I'm about to get in the mouth are going to meld really well together.  T - Citrus and pine hops all the way with a touch of sweetness followed by a bit of malt. The hops are so pronounced and so flavorful. Its amazing. Loads of lingering bitterness that I'm loving as I drink more.  M - Lots of carbonation that hold up very well to the massive punch this beer has. A little soapy in the finish but exceptional.  D - Very high. Very much so worth the 17.99 per 6 pack price tag. A delicious beer that is very easy to drink and remarkably smooth for such a palatte wrecker of a beer.

287,17112,sprucetip,4.67,"Largely clear but vaguely hazy, golden orange, a finger or so of fluffy white foam that dissipates gradually, decent retention and patchy lacing. Good lookin' brew, but not amazing.  One of the most fragrant brews I've ever experienced (mom says ""the most fragrant""). She might be right. Just enough boozy heat to help clear out the sinuses lies beneath the prodigious bouquet of what appears to be a wide variety of hops. Grassy, flowery, citrusy hops are joined by some pointedly harsher ""cat piss"" aroma, likely the result of a boatload of Centennial. I like it, but mom is not into the ""cat piss"" character of the nose. It's just an element, not the defining characteristic. But if you've never noticed it, pay attention and you will. Malty sweetness is ever so barely evident.  Over the top hop hop flavor, but somehow without much bitterness. Some may even be disappointed by the relative lack of bitterness. But the hop flavors, grassy, flowery and citrusy, but without the cat piss, are amazing. Truly exceptional. And they are balanced well by the malty sweetness, with perhaps just a wee slight hint of caramel. Or maybe not? Buckeyenation surely loves this beer.  Perfect carbonation, no sting or burn. Gentle warming, medium/full body, some viscosity, and a fairly crisp finish that isn't dry (really dry IPA finish is a pet peeve for me), and only very mild lingering bitterness.  I try not to get caught up in the hype machine, and to review with objectivity. But I'd be arrogant to assume that I am totally unaffected by the hype. But this is an exceptionally good DIPA, likely the best I recall having had (to my taste buds of course). I haven't had PtY, but have had most of the other high profile IPA and DIPA, including a bunch of Midnight Sun, to which I am partial, and I don't recall any being this satisfying. Dad and I have so far put down 5 of 6, and we may not be finished.  Had my first ever (year old) Hop Slam just a few nights ago at a BA tasting. It was not aged purposefully, but it too was also very good. The hops were not as bright and sharp, but it was packed full of flavor just like the fresh stuff.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",Imperial IPA,98

There's some drying going on toward the end followed by a bitter finish. This beer is so balanced for being a huge DIPA, the bitterness is there but it's not so overwhelming that it makes it hard to drink. Mouthfeel is great, it's syrupy but the carbonation makes it seem lighter than it really is. Drinkability is out of this world, I can't even taste the 10% ABV.

The honey sweetness balances with the bitterness and citrus so well it's difficult to put the glass down long enough to keep writing.  Light mouthfeel with perfect carbonation. This is not syrupy by any means like some other DIPAs I've had. Feels great in the mouth and aftertaste is of sweet honey. Very inviting. Lingers well.  I could drink this all night.

287,17112,Maxxthepenguin,4.97,"Hopslam, concocted by god, put in six packs by the devil. This is no ordinary beer, this isn't even an ordinary DIPA. Utterly extraordinary in every way, Hopslam is legendary in its ability to floor even the most able beer drinkers. The secret is its ability to combine the purest, most potent hop flavor with an exceptional drinkability. Each Hopslam you drink goes down smooth as silk while tasting like a godly nectar, but once your glass is empty (which happens far too quickly), you yearn for another. No other brew makes it so hard to stop while being so incredibly potent, at 10%. Deadlier than the jungle juice at a frat party, the love this drink instills must be balanced by respect for what it can do, or you'll end up drinking four before you know it, leaving you in quite a state of inebriation that you never planned for. Seek hopslam out while you can, but don't approach lightly. You will not be the same after you drink it, and the yearlong wait for another batch has destroyed stronger men than myself.  A: Exactly what a DIPA should look like: golden with a finger of head. S: A glorious bouquet of hops, with highlights of grapefruit and a strong punch of tropical fruit and orange. T: Absolutely incredible. The hops in the nose appear in the taste and come together with a sweetness that really ties this beer together. Never approaching cloying, the sweetness helps balance the bitterness of the hops without lessening the impact of the hop flavor. The orange flavor of this year's batch is truly remarkable, nowhere else have I found a beer that has such distinct orange notes. M: Coats your mouth with oily goodness, but still goes down smooth as silk. A marvelous mouthfeel. D: Beyond comprehension for a 10% beer.

The smell is hops, sweet honey, citrus all well blended together giving a pleasant aroma that makes you want to take a drink. The taste is a nice honey taste followed by some floral hops and in the middle is the citrus tastes of grapefruit,orange and lemon. The ending taste has some hop bitterness and grapefruit aftertaste like many IPA's, but doesn't have the too strong of bitterness land hop aftertaste like Bell's Two Hearted Ale does. I know this is a double IPA and is stronger than a regular IPA, but this is really nicely balanced in taste and even though can taste some alcohol near the end, it isn't too strong to ruin it.

Poured a dark golden/light red amber hue appearance. Leaves very nice lace, although the foam head thins out very quickly. Smells of sweet hops and hints of honey. Very dangerously drinkable and quickly became one of my favortie Imperial IPAs where the sweet malt sits in your mouth rather than leaving a bitter taste off the top of your tongue. I feel like it's a combination of Pliny's smell, but a sweeter pine taste with Dreadnaught's maltiness and mouthfeel.

S: Tangerine, fresh-squeezed orange, toffee malt, perfect balance of pine, citrus, and slightly cinnamon-earthy cheese. T: Bitterness and gin woody alcohol linger in the back of the throat and nose, while the caramel and toffee malts give this one some backbone for the pineapple and citrus-fruity hops that linger as a gentle pine character. While Pliny has more of a Belgian or cheese, this one has more of a fruitiness. M: Thicker with a creamy frothy carbonation that is perfect.

287,17112,LiquidCucumber,4.77,"A - Deep, rich bronze with a finger high head of white foam which sticks all over the side of my glass.  S - I hear they added more hops... Ok maybe I am lying because this is the first year I've tried this sucker, but dag, hops. Peaches and pineapples were what came to mind first, but there is a distinct tinge of musty hop resin as well. The back end hides a small waft of malty toffee.  T - Brutally bitter hops that run the gamut in terms of variation of flavor. All the tropical fruits are there; pineapple, mango, peach, grapefruit. And the spicy, musty and earthy characteristics of the hops is also present. There's only a malt backbone so that you don't wet yourself with the intensity of the hops. And a touch of honey of course, but this is not a sweet beer, that stuff fermented all out leaving the flavor essences of the raw stuff... pretty cool.  M - Medium on the mouthfeel; there is some creaminess to this brew. Does not seem overly carbonated to me, pretty nice for the style.  D - Err, this is 10%? I should watch myself because I'm thinking the six pack will go in a day or two. The only downfall to this beer is price, but compared to many other DIPAs it's a bargain!",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",Imperial IPA,98
287,17112,phisigben,4.72,"Appearance- There was very little head (due to the bar tender) The rest of the beer is a deep dark orange color.  Smell- Nice grape fruit and pine as soon as you bring it to your nose, and there is a slight honey smell but hard to initially notice.  Taste- WOW I love this beer, I feel like it's a combination of Pliny's smell and piney taste with Dreadnaught's maltiness and mouthfeel. A lot of grapefruit, pine and honey just like the nose.  Mouthfeel - I love the mouthfeel for DIPA I tend to enjoy the maltier slicker mouthfeel. So this beer is right up my ally. The carbonation is there but not over the top like with some other DIPA, it coats the mouth very well.

Hazy golden orange on the pour, which produces a frothy off-white two finger head that has great retention and nice spongy lacing.  Smell is lots of pine, with equal parts citrus (mostly tangy orange). There is definitely an earthy sweet note from the honey which adds nicely to the malt backbone balance.  Lots of tangy, sweet oranges on the taste. That honey compliments the citrus semi-sweet tang very nicely. The finish is a spicy, bitter hop note.  The feel is creamy, medium in body, with a nice crispness to it. Definitely goes down easy, and has a nice coating quality.  Drinkability is great. This is a big ABV brew, but I couldn't notice it at all.  Great DIPA. Since this gem was en route to me before new years, I have to assume it is last years batch.

A nice fluffy white head about 1 finger thick forms that recedes to a collar of the same color.  S - HUGE hop aroma coming up front. Citrus, peppery, pine notes all come together in areally nice herbal and refreshing way. There is also a sweetness which I guess is coming from the malt backbone and the honey.  T - BAM! This one lives up to its name for sure. Citrus and pine hit you from all different angles on the palate. Get lots of pineapple and some slight graperuit presence mixed with slight pine flavors. Sweet, but not too much. Really well balanced and complex flavors here.  M - Hearty medium bodied DIPA without being too sticky or too thick. Really nice carbonation and a pretty spot on feel for this style. Very smooth and in a war refreshing.  D - You can feel the ABV after a certain point, and your palate takes a beating, but it really is worth it. Drinkable to a point.

Citrus, Bitter Grapefruit, sweet pine and pineapple with a little bit of alcohol on the finish, not overpowering through. Despite the redicoulous hoppiness it comes over pretty balanced.  Mouthfeel - Like the bottle says, this is a tounge bruiser of an ale! Think of the best Double IPA's you've ever had and this is it. Creamy, good carbonation and a great bitter bite.

287,17112,BeerAdvocate,4.2,"Review from BeerAdvocate magazine Vol. II Issue VIII:  So, given the name, we can probably assume this is going to slam our palates with hops and then twist our minds with that interesting honey addition. We're ready for this beer geek, hophead legend.  Bright amber in color, topped with a lively, foamy, off-white creaminess that rises high and settles to a good two-finger-thick head--sticking to the glass and not going anywhere anytime soon. The aroma? Massively aromatic with some raw honey and floral perfume that nearly intoxicates on the spot. Some caramel too. The taste? It sneaks up on you. It's light at first, opens up to some sweet honey, toffee candy, alcohol, and then come the hops. It begins with some hemp oil, little bit of ruby grapefruit, white pepper, and then intensifies as it coats the palate with a slickish consistency. Chewy. Fruity esters in the middle. Alcohol says hello and reminds us that we're being slammed, as it reintroduces the hops, which have made camp on our palates at this point. They hang out well into the linger. Finishes with a dried grass, hoppy finish, faint soapiness, and alcohol fumes on the breath.  We've been HopSlammed. There's no going back. The Alström Bros want more.

287,17112,TheHoppiest,4.12,"Poured from a bottle into an oversized snifter. Pours a honey-amber color, with a soapy white head providing excellent lacing on the sides. This bottle is about six months old or so, so I'm curious to see if the hops have mellowed at all.  Smell is piney hops, decent resin, and a touch of citrus. There's an underlying yeastiness - perhaps from the age? I don't recall this in the younger bottles.  Age has definitely tempered this hop monster. Still plenty hoppy and bitter, but that bitterness quickly fades for a floral honey taste. Still some astringency nipping at the tongue. Definitely tasty, just not a Hop Slam.  Mouthfeel is medium to full; this is still a DIPA, even if it is 6 mnths old!  Even aged this is a damn drinkable brew. Maybe there should be a second category for rating this more mellow, but not too mellow, version of Hop Slam. Don't be afraid to cellar this one for some time; just expect that the hops will fade and a clover honey taste will start to present.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",Imperial IPA,98

Aroma of citrus hops (mainly orange), and a large caramel back bone. Taste is very malty (drinking a winter bottle in the summer). and some slightly orange hops in the finish.

Smell is hops, hops, and more hops, guess that's why they call it Hopslam... Taste is incredible! Very strong hoppy taste, strong bite from the alcohol which subsides after a few sips, but the honey ties it all together. After a few sips, I stopped tasting the intensity of a alcohol and the bitterness and the complexity of the hops and honey flavor really came through.

A bit hazy and unassuming considering how much of a hopped up, high ABV DIPA this is.  Smell: Such an elegant blend of hoppy goodness. Juicy grapefruit and pineapple, with orange and a bit of honey in the background.  Taste: This is truly what I have been looking for in a double IPA since I was introduced to the style. It is tough for me to tell when the honey really impacts the flavor, but there is a distinct pale malt sweetness at the beginning of the sip. This malt really frames the hop profile well. Juicy pineapple and grapefruit, along with some other smoothly blended citrusy fruits. Such a fantastic hop profile. Finishes clean and smooth.  Mouthfeel: It would be hard to hide the grainy hop feel and oil, but this is tied together so well. A nice creamy feel, with a fuller than medium body. Finishes clean, with just a touch of hop residue, and it leaves me longing for the next sip.  Drinkability: Having this on tap was absolutely mind blowing.

Smell: hops, hops and more hops. Usual citrus notes for an IIPA  Taste: How can I describe this wonderful brew. It lives up to its name. Hops are in your face upfront. Grapefruit and other citrus notes follow and then the honey sweetness takes over. Finish is the alcohol burn that reminds you of the 10 percent alcohol level.  Mouthfeel: smooth with a dry finish that reminds me of other Bells products.  Drinkability: I try to session this puppy but my wife is getting upset with me stumbling around the house after a few. You just can't drink this beer as you would like.  Hopslam is by far the best IIPA out there; bar none. I'm moving to Dallas and will miss being able to drive to KY to pick this up early in the year.

I had off a keg earlier in the year at a brewfest so knew what I was getting into.  A - Poured a nice amber color. The head kept building as I let it sit. It was a very nice looking pour.  S - Definitely some fruits and some undertones of honey. The smell seemed to be a little faded, but I'm not complaining.  T - The hops immediately pop the beer gives off a great citrusy flavor. I wanted more, but could tell that it was a little mellowed out.  M - The maltiness of the beer was apparent not overwhelming though.  D - Highly drinkable.

Fresh citrus hops were apparent, as well as a tad of honey.  T: Not nearly as bitter as one would expect from a DIPA. Initially my mouth was swarmed with the powerful hop flavors (mostly citrus) and then topped off with the honey, which continued into the aftertaste. The alcohol is almost unnoticeable. Very well balanced; almost perfect.  M: Well-carbonated and medium-bodied. Good for the style, but nothing extraordinarily special here.  D: It is scary how drinkable this is, weighing in at 10% ABV. Each time I've had this on tap, I was tempted to order another but held myself back.  I had it out of the bottle a few times in January and March, but the bottle does not do this beer justice. If you get the chance, do yourself a favor and try it on-tap!",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",Imperial IPA,98

287,17112,stimulus,2.48,"12 ounce bottle. Batch #9470, bottled in December of 2009.  A: Pours a slightly hazy orange with light white lacing.  S: Aromas of melon and hops are prominent.  T: Melon and other citrus flavors show up, but they are absolutely dominated by the hop bitterness and alcohol burn, which linger.  M: Medium bodied and sticky with very high carbonation.  D: This is not a very drinkable brew, imo. Knowing this was a hop bomb, I tried aging it about 9 months, and it's been 8. That didn't help this brew one bit, as the hop profile STILL annihilates any semblance of a malty balance, and not to my liking. After having and enjoying beers like Ruination and Arrogant Bastard, and even any of the DFH DIPA's, I feel like all of them are very well balanced, but this was not. Bad batch perhaps, but I have been unable to find any indication of the sort. Note: compared side by side with DFH 90 Minute and Double Trouble, both of which showed balance in comparison.  2/26/11 Edit: After going through a fresh six pack, I feel like the beer was a bit past its prime when I initially rated it, but I feel like the beer still suffers from a lack of balance. I tasted a lot of honey rather than melon, but the honey never blends well with the hop character and the malt bill is just not enough to keep this beer from being overly harsh. At one point, I compared this to a Troegs Nugget Nectar, and the difference was remarkable: The NN tastes like a finished product while the Hopslam is still a mess.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",Imperial IPA,98
287,17112,beerdrifter,4.47,"Thanks to Eric and Doug for this one as part of a trade. Clear yellow-orange pour with quickly fading head and decent lacing. Really huge and bold, floral, perfumy, citrusy nose with a hint of caramel malt. The taste is also huge with the mouth puckering citrus hitting you from start to finish. With that said, it's very well balanced. Really nice resiny, chewy mouthfeel makes this highly drinkable and the alcohol is completely hidden. This could be dangerous. Expected it to be somewhat subdued since it's out of season, but was pleasantly surprised by how big it still was. Can't imagine what a fresh one would be like.

287,17112,siradmiralnelson,4.92,"Poured from 12oz bottle into Tulip. This is my intial review from the very first time I had Hopslam. Extremely fresh in January 2010.  A. Big 2 finger head. Excellent head retention. Very good lacing. Nice dark golden orange color.  S. Smell is all hops. Sweet delicous hops, Citrus and piney hops. smells very much like fresh hop oil, if you have ever crushed a hop cone or pellet in your hand, can detect some of the honey sweetness among the more biscuity than sweet tasting malt.  T. Taste might be the perfect balance between hop bitterness and a biscuity malt with the extra addition of honey sweetness. Tropical fruit, peach, orange. This is a truly delicous beer. The honey might not be apparent as the actual taste of honey, but it provides a sweetness that sets this beer over the top.  M. medium bodied. very smooth the 10%abv is almost not apparent. Just a hint of lingering bitterness from the hops.  D. Extremely drinkable. This beer does not drink like a DIPA. This is definitely one of the best DIPA's out there. What I like most is the balance of the sweetness from malt & honey and the huge hops. The only complaint about this beer is that it is seasonal.  *Hopslam is almost 2 different beers between fresh and aged. Fresh is one of the best DIPA's in the world. I myself think an aged Hopslam is still a very delicous beer, but it is definitely a different beer than fresh. Aged Hopslam is a sweet malty delicous beer.

T: The aroma kick starts the big citrus flavors the beer parades before you. Well balanced malt sweetness, and a strong lingering bitterness on the back end. Almost perfect.  M: Medium body with medium carbonation. A bit resiny on the tongue, but not too bad.  D: Great, easy drinking beer, and an amazing match for peperoni and pineapple pizza!  O: Amazing beer.

It is missing a lot of the floral and piney notes from the fresh batch as one would expect but it still has a nice pucker factor. Honey is hardly present on the 2010, even when fresh the 2009 was a much bigger beer. The 2009 has very little hop left, but the flavor is well integrated with a lengthy finish of honey and sweet malt. I have a lot of hop-head friends who criticize me for aging this beer, but anything with this kind of abv has some staying power. If you only drink this beer for the hops then drink it fresh. If you appreciate its complexity and richness you might think about saving one or two from next years batch to experiment with.

Smell was spicy, piney and citrusy hops with a great toasted malt undertone.  Taste is great hit of citrusy piney hops, with a slight spicyness and a great toasted malt finish.  Mouthfeel was way to smooth for this abv, great lingering flavors and just enough carbonation  Wonderfully drinkable, I just wish it was on draft in PA more.  Review from canned version (2018) on 2/13/2018: Poured into a small chalice: color is copper, transparent, some small bubbles in the liquid but not overly effervescent, head is off white with fine to small bubbles, great lacing and thin lingering top. (4)  Smell is a little neutral - light toasted malt, some hops come through with pine and resin, herbal and earthy. (4)  Taste comes through with light toasted malt sweetness, hint of honey, pine, resins, herbs and light earthiness, light citrus/tropical note as well. Just great flavor for a 10% beer with minor alcohol presence.

Aroma is still pretty impressive for being 6 months old, strong citrus and floral hops, not quite as strong as I was hoping but very nice. There is some lightly roasted caramel malt noticeable and the honey comes through a bit as well. There is a mild grass aroma. Really a pretty good nose for an ""aged"" IPA.  Taste is fairly sweet, the honey is very noticeable here. Starts with sweet caramel malt then transitions into honey and hop bitterness with some citrus. The finish has some alcohol warmth and a lingering hop bite, though not an unpleasant one.  Mouthfeel is medium/light with moderate carbonation.

Not very bitter at all, as the honey and malts overpower the hops a bit (to make such a unique balance). Not what I'm used to with my typical west coast IPAs.

Pours a clear copper, close to a light amber, with a thick frothy head that leaves some minor lacing as it dies away. The nose is grapefruit, mandarin oranges, pine, and lime. This hops-on-steroids smell is echoed in the taste, which showcases citrus, ruby red grapefruits, tart blood oranges, the basic essence of 50/50, and a deep backbone of light caramel and buttery toffee.

287,17112,adkirkish,4.95,"A: Pours a perfect clear golden yellow, w/ an extremely creamy and thick white head. Leaves excellent lacing patterns as consumed. Maintains head very well.  A: Floral and citrus hops are the focal point and make a great first impression. The rest of the aroma is complimented with subtle hints of pale malt. No esthers, no diacetyl.  F: Pale malts do a great job of complimenting the floral and citrus hops. The best way I can describe it is...imagine if you had a hop cone sitting on the very middle of your tongue inside your mouth. This beer is extremely balance between malt and hops, but leans toward hops which is appropriate for style. The beer doesn't linger too long like others do, rather is a short explosion of hop bitterness on the way down.  M: Creamy and smooth. Bubbly and tingly from the carbonation.  O: I enjoy this beer alot. This is an outstanding example for the style if not one of the best. The only recommendation I could give is to try and implement the creamy feeling from Bells Two Hearted.

The malts are much more noticeable after aging, however the hops still retain the dominanace in the nose.  T - The hops coat the palate but dont have the overpowering floral taste of a fresh pale ale. The malts come in after the hops, very well balanced, creating a nice caramel flavor before going back to the hops in the finish. Slightly harsh finish from the hops (which is not a bad thing at all).  M - Heavy bodied with a high amount of carbonation.  D - I absolutely love this beer!

I've since bought several cases...just to be on the safe side. ;-}  Color is a sort of a funky, pre-disco era 70's dirty orange..unfiltered and opaque. While the hops ""slam"" you hard upfront and linger throughout, the beer is amazingly smooth, albeit a bit heavier, after the initial hit.  The consistency is slightly thicker than a 90 minute or Maharaja....think Burton Baton.  The only reason I put ""drinkability"" at a 4 is simply because at 10% and it's overall lean towards heaviness, after 2 you're usually ready to move on to something else....but ohhh those two!!!

Front side is a lush chew on caramalts, peaches, pine and citrus. Mid palate some complexity builds then a slow balanced finish with a hop bite at the end and alpha after sting left in your throat.

Easily one of the most complex and flavorful IPAs you can get, it's amazing the sheer amount of flavor packed into this bottle.

It was definitely worth it--this is a classic citrus fruit hop-bomb of an American DIPA with a mellow honey touch that tones down the bitterness and amps up the sweetness and floral character enough to keep it interesting and pretty unique so far as I know. I suspect the honey gets stronger as the beer ages a bit--next year hopefully I'll get to try both a slightly fresher bottle and this lovely aged version.

I would love to smell this on tap from the brewery.  Hopslam finishes with a good amount of bitterness. There is a little bit of sweetness, that really balances the hops, but this is definitly heavy on the hops and I am really enjoying the flavor profile on this beer. Again, the sweet tropical fruit flavors are impressive.  There is definitely some weight and body on this beer. Med/low carbonation, works well.  Very drinkable DIPA. Just a well crafted beer.

287,17112,cbutova,4.37,"The second, and last, bottle that I brought back from Capone's with me when I was in the Philly area.  A- Pours into my snifter with an attractive golden yellow/orange color. The head builds up pretty well but does not show great retention at all. It dies down and leaves a frothy cloud on top of the beer as well as some spots of fine lacing. The color is great but the head was not.  S- Right as the bottle is opened I get hints of hops from several feet away. Upon closer inspection the aroma is a nice balance of hops and caramel malt, the malt I am used to in the Bell's beers that I have had. The hops lend notes of tropical sweets and citrus fruits. Orange, pineapple, apricot come into mind. The malt rounds out a great, balanced aroma. Sculpin is really the only hoppy beer that smells significantly better than this, to me.  T- The taste is different from the aroma but great as well. The malt is grainier and I want to say a bit rustier than it is in the nose. The caramel aspects are still there as well. The hops lend more peel flavors than in the aroma. Orange and grapefruit peel are huge here. The fruit sweetness carries over from the smell. It has a good hop malt balance but like Nugget Nectar, the smell beats out the taste. Alcohol does not make an appearance here. I almost forgot to mention the bitterness, a great moderate level is employed in this ale.  MF- Incredibly creamy. The body is great, on the lighter side but damn creamy. The carbonation is at a low to moderate level and feels nice for a DIPA. The beer is pretty damn warm but it feels nice. A coat of malty bitter orange peel coats the palate.  DB- The price was high but not crazier than many DIPAs out there today. I really like Bell's so far, the malt they use seems to be one of the more memorable ones I can think of. A bit more fruit flavor vs. peel would have been nice but I can't complain too much. Like PtY, the impressive thing here may be the fact that this is 10% and retains a DIPA flavor vs. that of a Barleywine/Strong Ale.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",Imperial IPA,98

Smooth as silk, yet still slamingly hoppy. Honey does things. Hops are sensitive, but that doesn't mean every hop bomb needs to be crushed young. HopSlam, like Ithaca AlphAlphA (another wonderful honey bitter), is terrific with 3-6 months of cold aging.

Surprise, surprise, the aroma is very hoppy with orange peel and orange blossom, some vanilla, and other white flower aromas. The front of the palate features the orange flavors, and is lightly honeyed. On the mid-palate, the honeyed characteristic continues, but there is also a biscuit flavor. On the back of the palate, the hoppy bitterness kicks in with the orange peel, but it is also quite nice with the vanilla flavor. The beer is full-bodied and coats the entire palate with a long finish. Overall, this is a great IPA. It is super balanced, I can hardly believe that it is ten percent alcohol.

287,17112,chickenflea,4.65,"On tap at Underground Bluz. Bell's is a brewery that offers very good beers while taking risks on unique formulas as well (Cherry Stout, for example). This is one of their best. And it just so happens to be in my favorite style.  Smell - Malty with caramel and apricot syrup. A bit bready as well. Citrus and peach also lurking.  Appearance - A beautiful pour with a thick white head and a rich amber color. A lot of lacing.  Mouthfeel - Thick and creamy on the palate. Medium-heavy body.  Taste - Surprisingly, very little alcohol burn for a 10.5ABV. The hoppiness of the beer is undeniable, but the bitterness is so moderated by the malty flavor up front that the bitter finish is welcome and necessary. Some pine with the citrus.  Drinkability - Drinkable and delicious. Give me a night with no where to go and I could get lost in this brew. One of the very best I've had.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",Imperial IPA,98
287,17112,rawthar,4.27,"A- Big-bubbled white headiness over a typical IPA colored body, with a very active carbonation profile. A universe of motion inside.  S- The name is no exaggeration. Every dimension of hops makes an appearance here: Grassiness, citrus, pine, florals, dry bitters all combine to form a powerful, rubbery assault. You can smell this one coming from a mile away.  T- This may be the one hop bomb whose flavor trumps its smell. For all its intense hoppiness, this is neither overly dry nor bitter, even if the malts disappear into the background. Not sure when this batch was bottled, but I imagine this is not what you would call fresh. Can't wait til next year to catch this beer at its peak.  M- The typical IPA liquid-turns-to-foam magic trick.

Smell: Extremely sweet aroma with piney hops and lemony herbal notes. Great balanced aroma, grapefruit, slight orange peel and honey.  Taste: Tastes a bit muted for what i was expecting, might be because of the december 2009 bottling. Solid hops bitter bite complimented with a sweet malty backbone that delivers honey and sweet tea like sweetness to balance.  Mouthfeel: nicely carbonated, not overly cloying but definately able to feel the strength of the beer. Hides the 10% well.  Drinkability: Solid. despite the high ABV this is a winner.

287,17112,BearsOnAcid,3.8,Great extra from mikesgroove. Thanks!  HopSlam poured somewhat vigorously into a pint glass.  About a one inch dense head formed on top. Soapy lacing. Liquid is a slightly hazy sunburst. Simple and elegant for a DIPA. Smell was sweet and fragrant with Simcoe hops. Small scent of alcohol. Little yeasty.  Taste is surprisingly not as sweet as the nose. You would think this would have more body to it as well. Theres a big punch of floral hops and grapefruit pith. Slightly sweet on the front of your palate. The honey ramps up the alcohol and thins out the mouthfeel. THERE IS NO HONEY FLAVOR!  Big burning sensation in my chest from quick consecutive sips. Decent amount of spiciness from the mix of strong alcohol and hops. Finishes mostly dry with a hint of astringent bitterness in the back of of your palate.  Alcohol is present and accounted for. Dangerously drinkable though. I went through half my glass in about 5 minutes.  This obviously isn't fresh but it holds up to still be a very good DIPA.,Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",Imperial IPA,98
287,17112,Beerandraiderfan,4.38,"Despite what some say, this beer is available well beyond January, I just bought some last week at Discount Liquors in Milwaukee and my brother just had some on tap in AZ a few weeks before that. Furthermore, El Bait Shop in Des Moines indicated they had just run out of a keg 2 weeks ago.  A dark yellow appearance, minimal head and lacing quickly dissolves. Aroma is a little sweet, and not as hop aromatic as something I would expect calling itself 'Hopslam'.  Taste, again, less hop feel, good honey, but extremely enjoyable. Many make more hay than necessary out of this beer's 'freshness'. Yes, it changes, but the impact on the beer's quality is minimal, if at all. Buy a 6'er, drink one per week, they'll all be different, but not to the degree some will try and convince you of. Big hops, and a substantial body, whether from the malt roasting or honey to give some counterbalance.  14.99 a 6'er = pricey, when you figure you can get PTE, a superior product, for less than $5 a 500ml bottle.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",Imperial IPA,98

It's got Pine and citrus hops, it has a fruity flavor from the hops. I can't say the word hops enough, but it's malted just right so as not to be super bitter.  M: good, carbonated, I could tell it was higher abv than a single ipa while I was drinking it. Sticky would be a good word to describe my mouth after.

Next you gte some sweetness trying to balance to frontal attack of the hops, but it doesn't last long. The hop taste lasts for many, I mean many minutes. Not for the faint of heart, or for those that don't crave this taste and sensation. Mouthfeel was very full and satisfying. Drinkability?

This is an attractive ale with a warm golden color and a descent, pale, golden head and good lacing.  What sets this style apart is the way in which the aroma just leaps out of the glass and grabs you by the scruff of the neck. Spectacular notes of passion-fruit, pineapple and grapefruit.  Wow, the taste is every bit as good as advertised by the nose. Tropical fruits and grapefruit, with a strong backbone of hops, just assault the senses. Doesn't step over the line into that piney, resinous back palate.  You would kind of think from the description, that this ale is some sort of ladies cocktail. Quite the opposite. While there are incredible fruit notes to this ale, the hops and well balanced bitterness make for a muscular ale. Just the thing for a guy to pound down a few of.  High ABV means you won't be drinking gobs of this ale. But it is certainly one to savor.

Pours a beautiful gold color with minimal head and only a slight bit of lacing lasting around the perimeter. Would have liked to see better head rentention.  Smell was pretty muted. Wife smelled blueberries though I really didn't. Maybe a bit of damp grass? Definitely not the fruit-filled nose that some describe.  Taste is sweet up front, honey coming through. Not overly hoppy but the hop jab is there through the middle and then a slight bitter finish. Taste is very balanced and not the hop bomb that I was expecting. More carbonation would help I think, its a bit ""syrupy"" as is.  Drinkability is high for me as the alcohol is pretty well hidden. Although, with the 10 percent abv, I could get in trouble fast. Wish I had more than just this one in any case!  Overall the muted nose and taste may just be from a beer thats not as fresh as it could be. Would love to try this super fresh sometime!

They are so fresh-tasting and intense that words almost fall short in describing them. The hops are very fruity, with tangerine and apricot flavors and a strong piney presence. The hop bitterness is intense upfront and rarely fades in the mouth. The malts are not meant to stand out here and they don't. They do, however, provide a strong grainy foundation for the hops to shine. This ale is why the good Lord made humulus lupulus. The mouthfeel is unlike most other DIPAs.

287,17112,zoso1967,4.67,"Pours a deep, slightly amber golden with a nice sticky ivory head that leaves equally sticky lacing.  The aroma is incredible. It is a grapefruit karate chop to my nose that is accentuated with candy malt sweetness as well as fresh pine, pineapple and other tropical fruits.  The flavor follows suit with the same great northwest citrus hop character. Pine, grapefruit, pineapple and a bitterness that I would describe as harsh, but in a good way. I have had this in years past and it remains as one of the sweeter double IPAs I have had, and if it has a weakness it is that it is perhaps a bit too sweet. That being said, I think part of this beer's brilliance is that the malt is almost transparent in character. This allows the hops to shine through, yet keeps the beer balanced. No caramel or toasted malt here, just a foil for the no holds barred hop attack. This is an incredible beer and superb take no prisoners example of the style. I keep alternating between sipping and smelling that wonderful aroma.  Mouthfeel is on the fuller side of medium and despite the overall sweetness of the beer, it is not too sticky and the finish is well balanced, leaving a nice tingly bitterness on my tongue.  Due to the ABV, I have a hard time drinking more than a couple of these in a sitting, but this is a treat to savor and I think for style it is nicely drinkable. Another top notch beer from one of the pioneering craft breweries.  Update: 1-20-11  After moving back to Michigan and drinking a ton of fresh HopSlam out of the bottle, minikeg and on draft, I had to bump up my score.

287,17112,brewerburgundy,3.9,"12oz bottle, goblet, coded 9552 on the bottom of the rear label. Huge thank you to farrago for making my first trade awesome.  Pours out a very nice honey gold that tends towards orange and seems slightly chill hazed. Worthwhile off-white head with pretty good retention.  I began smelling the sweet hoppiness as soon as the bottle was popped. This has definitely faded, no doubt, but retains significant tropical (mango, passion fruit, pineapple) and sweet orange zest in the nose. The malt and what I'm sure lots of people perceive as honey is very potent, very sweet. Candied orange peel comes to mind.  Sweet honey-like malt backed up by solid but not pounding bitterness that is in the vane of orange and grapefruit pith. When this warms much at all some solvent alcohol shows up and enhances the bitterness with orange oil and pepper components. This is a solid beer even after three months.  I'll concur with a review several people below me and say that the carbonation could use a boost. The prickle would help nucleate the lupulin goodness.  The warming is there and I find the exposed malt/honey profile pretty nice. I'm glad that I've at least gotten to try such a buzzed beer once, but couldn't justify the $16 plus sixer every season.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",Imperial IPA,98

Taste: Sweet and fruity hops punch from the front all the way to the finish. Its also bitter throughout, but that's well balanced with the big and sweet maltiness. So much hops but so well put together that its never the least bit unpleasant.  Mouthfeel: Pretty full here. Not quite as heavy as a barleywine, but pretty big and sticky. Good carbonation.  Drinkability: This is a great beer. Extreme hops flavor without mouth raping bitterness, huge sweet malt backbone, sneaky 10% abv.

Nice and hazy. The pour creates a finger of fluffy white head that dissipates quickly and leaves some lacing. Purty.  S: This is not the freshest sample in the world, but it is still in the few best smelling beers I've ever had. I suspect a brand new Hopslam could send men to war. It's a big bouquet of hop deliciousness. Tropical. I'll go with pineapple, mango, and orange. Plenty of pine, too. Good god.  T/M: It's not fair to say that the smell wrote a check the taste couldn't cash, since I'm not sure anything could taste as good as Hopslam smells. There's a lot more malt in the taste. Nice balance. Of course, the hops don't go down without a fight. No trace of the 10% ABV. The body's medium for the style, with medium, active carbonation. Killer bitter finish, and pretty dry.  D: Pretty much lives up to the hype. It joins the vaunted ranks of DFH 90 Minute, Avery Maharaja and Captain Lawrence IIPA as my favorite examples of my favorite style.

D: Do I really have to wait until next February to get more fresh Hopslam?",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",Imperial IPA,98
287,17112,Drazzamatazz,4.08,"Been finishing a six pack I picked up while in Florida for spring break, its interesting to see how quickly this beer has changed in the month I'd had them. Bottle # 9502 Poured into Sam Adams Perfect Pint.  A - Light amber, comes through as clear in certain areas when held up to a light. Moderate head that resides quickly.  S - Pineapple, fresh pine, papaya, and many floral notes. A clear hint of honey in every whiff. Of course it lives up to its name, there's hops through-and-through.  T - This isn't what I'd imagined it taste like, but I might say it's better. There's a lot more balance going on here then I would have expected given it's moniker. Sure there's hops, but the honey lends a balancing sweetness. Plenty of lemongrass and grapefruit upfront, which slowly go to floral and then lastly honeycomb. No alcohol to note for a 10% alcohol beer.  M - Medium bodied with medium carbonation. For the sweet taste it is still quite dry in the mouth.  D - This doesn't drink like a 10% alcohol beer. I had three one night, and while I certainly felt the affects I never noticed them.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",Imperial IPA,98
287,17112,organicbrewer,3.38,"Batch 9470  A-Full gold. Huge cloudlike head, fairly compact bubbles. slight haze.  S-Candied orange. Slight honey aroma. Not too much else. Maybe this is past its prime.  T-Farily bitter, but the malt sweetness balances it off. Moderate pine and citrus.  M-Fairly thick for an IIPA. I like mine a bit drier. Medium carbonation.  D-at 3.5 or so months old this seems to have lost its hop punch. Still has some citrus aroma with the hop flavor, but it isn't ""a bruiser of an ale."" Also would like this a bit drier, the beer lingers on the palate too long.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",Imperial IPA,98
287,17112,bigmike55,4.6,"Had this beer on tap at The Stem & Stein in Madison, AL. It was from a very fresh keg. I was surprised at how good it is.  It poured a golden color with a small head.  I found the taste to be very balanced for a high ABV, hoppy beer. The high alcohol was not obvious.  This is a very drinkable beer, and I found myself wanting another.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",Imperial IPA,98
287,17112,DmanGTR,4.12,"A huge thanks to RocPorterFanatic (Chad) for hooking me up with a 6 pack! Bottle #9478.  A - Crystal clear golden honey with a well formed white fluffy head. Retained as a bubbly cap that left some islands of lace. 4.0  S - Hop galore, the nose is a wonderful mix of pineapple, pine resin, guava, and pungent earth, but more fruity than earthy. Honey is very faint, as expected due to it being fully fermented out. 4.5  T - Sweet and citrusy flavors are in the forefront, bringing grapefruit, lemon zest, and a light undertone of passionfruit before letting the bitter and earthy lemongrass flavors take over into a long lasting, herbal finish. Malt character is more in the background, providing ample balance to the intense hop profile. I don't taste as much honey as I thought I would; instead I find a bit of caramel sweetness present. Alcohol is barely noticeable. 4.0  M - Medium bodied with a crisp and refreshing palate. Carbonation is ample but not overdone. Texture isn't completely smooth, but the mild roughness fits the overall profile. 4.0  D - For a 10% beer, this drinks wonderfully. I barely noticed the heat, if any. For a pricier beer, however, I will probably only make this an occasional (or seasonal) drink. 4.0",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",Imperial IPA,98
287,17112,jhoban19,4.74,"12oz. bottle poured into a tulip.  A: deep orange, bright, with almost 2 fingers of airy white head. Foam settles quickly into a thin ring of bubbles around the glass. Lacing holds its position pretty well but is confined to a small area on the sip side of the glass.  S: loads of tropical fruits- mango, peach, guava, pineapple and some strawberry. A good dash of honey as well. The aromas bring me back to a recent trip to Maui, specifically the Road to Hana, where smells of mangos, guava and wild ginger fill the air. Only a slight malt backbone, almost like pie crust. In fact, memories of strawberry pie baking in my grandmother's kitchen come to mind upon taking the first whiff of HopSlam. As it warms, toasted malts emerge, along with subtle hints of caramel. The smell of fresh hops also comes through.  T: Taste follows the aroma- lots of tropical fruits right off the bat. The fruit is quickly overtaken by a wonderful bitterness that lingers into the next sip. As HopSlam warms, toasted malts make their way onto the palate, much like the aromas. Still, the initial fruit blast and linger hop bitterness of the star of this show.  M: light-to-medium bodied with a long, dry and bitter finish that provides a wonderful balance to the wallop of fruit at the outset. Smooth, with just a touch of creaminess toward the end of the glass.  D: Far too drinkable for 10% ABV! I find myself taking bigger sips than I really should, particularly for a beer I likely won't be able to drink for another year. The biggest problem I'm having right now is that I want to have another beer tonight, but I can't imagine what I might follow up with. Guess I'll have to take my chances. Maybe Bell's will one day decide to make HopSlam available year-round, but for now I'll have to settle for this belated Christmas present. I might also run down to my local bottle shop to see if they have any left- and if they have any left on the shelf, I'm taking it all with me!",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",Imperial IPA,98

S-Very fragant citrusy malty smell that was in the air before my nose got near the glass. T-Sour citrus malt flavor with honey afternotes and a bitter hoppy finish. M-Smooth and somewhat creamy with the alcohol and hops reminding you at the swallow this is a 10% hopped up brew. D-Very drinkable but potentially dangerous given the ABV, but overall a very nice beer.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",Imperial IPA,98
287,17112,ToasterChef,4.45,"Reviewed from my notes, based on a bottle provided by sigma23 and also split with deltatauhobbit. It has a pretty golden color and a thin, white, bubbly head. The clear body lets me see all sorts of rising and clinging carbonation. It has a big sweet citrus aroma. I taste woodsy hops up front. The hops in the finish are all bitter. There is just a hint of the 10% ABV. It's hard to believe this is a double IPA. The finish is very dry, which is pleasant. The amount of coating is as expected. The body is heavier and carbonation lighter that I thought it would be. All of this makes it so drinkable. I might get knocked over if I have too many, but the alcohol taste will never become a limiting factor, it's just too subtle. The same goes for the bitterness. It's not subtle, but it's never overpowering. The hops are perfectly balanced.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",Imperial IPA,98
287,17112,ChrisPro,4.14,"12 oz bottle probably about 8 months old. Pours hazy dark gold with very little head. Aroma of honey and lavender. Incredibly sweet caramel and honey flavor followed by an almost stinging bitter finsh. Medium body with quite a bit of activity on the tongue. Very complex and almost reminiscent of a west coast barley wine. Would love to taste it fresh. ABV is hidden extremely well!  Rerate on 1/21/10 for 2010 12oz bottle batch 9470. Ppurs clear golden yellow, small white head, fantastic lacing. Aroma is dominated by pineapple with hints of peach, vanilla, and a little raspberry. Definitely the fruitiest non-citrus aroma I've ever smelled from an ipa. Taste is just mild sweetness, then a huge clean bitterness, with a feeling of a bitter tea finish. Good carb with great effervescence and incredibly drinkable for the ABV. Definitely way better fresh.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",Imperial IPA,98
287,17112,deapokid,4.08,"Pours a nice, off-white foamy head. Glass is covered in beautiful lacing and the beer itself is a crisp golden color with moderate carbonation. Visually, it's pretty unique for a DIPA.  Aromatically, hop stink is the big deal here, with strong and citrusy hops standing at the forefront. Unfortunately, the honey mentioned on the bottle isn't evident in the scent, which would have acted as a nice balance.  Ooh, here comes that honey sweetness I was dying for. I really love how this beer bucks conventions and allows the hop flavor to take on a more subdued roll. It plays well alongside the honey and a slight maltiness shows up on the backend, adding body to the brew.  Being a subdued hop brew, the dry scratchy conclusion isn't on display, which is usually the draw, but wouldn't work well with that big honey flavor. It's a rather smooth brew with a fizzly carbonated conclusion that dances on the tastebuds.  As for drinkability, I seriously don't believe that this is 10% alcohol. If so, this stuff is positively dangerous. It's not heavy whatsoever and the addition of honey totally levels out any hop bitterness that would hint at the profound booziness.  This is definitely a big league effort from Bell's and will please the hop head seeking originality over brute force.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",Imperial IPA,98
287,17112,femALEist,4.54,"Had this on tap at 1702 in Tucson. I had it on draft and it poured a clear tangerine yellow. It smelled of grass, hops, citrus and sweet ripe grapefruit. Talk about a nose- I could smell this beer as our server was heading over to our table! It tasted sweet, some honey, citrus, grapefruit and it was definitely bitter. It reminded me of the bitterness off a grapefruit rind. This beer has the most grapefruit bitterness flavor from hops that I have ever tasted. It was quite amazing. I highly recommend this one!",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",Imperial IPA,98
287,17112,ElGallo,4.42,"Thanks VanillaMike for hooking me up with a bottle. I tried this just a few weeks after trying Pliny the Elder for the first time. I can see why BAs love comparing the two beers, because they are among the top hoppy beers on the market. I can't say I liked one more than the other because they are both superb. The honey in the HopSlam provides a subtle sweetness but does not take away from the citrus and pine notes that one craves in a hopped-up beer. I live in New England, and HopSlam cannot be found any closer than PA, so I am glad I got to try this excellent beer. It went well with some beer brats, onions, and peppers (all cooked in pale ale) by the highly underrated beer chef chowdahead.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",Imperial IPA,98
287,17112,Ragingbull,3.87,"Orange tinted gold color similar to honey of a sort. Thick and frothy head that I would call at least a centimeter thick. It clings to the glass some, but not all that stubbornly. The hops dominates the nose, but there is certainly a sweetness to it as well. Sweet and light, really. Perhaps a bit of honey? Very hoppy attack and flavor, but not really a bitter beer. I guess its consistent with the DIPA style. The finish smoothes out with a little sweetness that I would swear it wildflower honey. The aftertaste allows the punch of the hops to shine. The mouthfeel is on the thick side, which is to be expected for the style. I would say that the flavors are more interesting than they are drinkable. I enjoyed it, but its probably its unique nature that grabs me more than thinking ""I need to keep a case of this on hand."" Not an everyday beer. A special occasion type.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",Imperial IPA,98

Smell: Tons of grapefruit notes, hoppy also. Hence the name I reckon! A sweet smell is also present, probably all the honey they use.  Taste: Very sweet at first, almost too sweet. Then the sweetness dissipates with a strong hop 'slam' (yeah I went there) Pretty well balanced, though the sweetness might be a bit much for some.  Mouth feel: Left a stickiness to my mouth, pretty heavily carbonated also.  Drinkability: Pretty drinkable for being a 10% ABV beer. You'd probably only want 1 or 2 of these at a time due to the sticky feeling and high ABV.  Overall: A pretty good IPA, worthy of the title HopSlam. If I had one complaint it would be the sweetness.

Floral piney hops with some caramel malts and a slight fruitiness. Also some delicious smelling honey and maybe some white grapes. Also as it warms the alcohol becomes very apparent.  T- Wow this brew is crazy. Along side of a pretty strong alcohol fullness is some great tasing piney and earthy hops that blend greatly with the caramel malt body. Also bursts of honey come through with a slight fruity sweetness.  M- Medium bodied with a pretty strong bitter dry finish. Makes you want to drink more and more.

A small one finger bright white head forms and dissipates fairly quickly. A thin cap of white film lasts for most of the drink, a bit of lacing as well...  Smell is very sweet, fruity hops, pineapple, general citrus aromas. A bit of pine from the hops and a very oily/resin aroma. Very complex, very sweet and very nice. A bit of caramel malt smell sits in there somewhere as well...  Initial blast of sweetness, tropical fruit flavor from the hops. Bitters mid drink with a nice piny hop onslaught, but still remains very smooth and easy drinking. Good malt backing balances the beer out and makes for the best tasting DIPA I have sampled to date...  Mouthfeel is thick and oily, chewy, nice carbonation and very coating...Alcohol adds a nice little zing as well...  Excellent excellent beer.

The aroma, well, it's hop heaven to keep it simple... moderate notes of honey and citrus; absolutely fantastic!  The overall experience of this beer is amazingly smooth for an Imperial IPA, the citrus elements of sweetness offset the massive hops and create a wonderful balance. The carbonation is minimal and its light-to moderate in heaviness. Session, session, session if you can afford it, the growler is an amazing experience!

No cap, barely any lacing.  S: Wow. I can smell how sweet this is going to be. Must be the honey? I just have my nose buried in the glass, great aroma. Little bit of citrus bust mostly a pine forest and sweet malts. I got the most nose out of this after letting it warm, and swishing it around the glass. Excellent!  T: Huge hops up front, what did you expect from something called ""Hopslam""? Taste follows the nose, walking through a pine forest while eating an orange. This thing finishes malty and sweet, a dinner biscuit with honey drizzled on top.  M: Nice and thick, just what I expect from a DIPA. Medium carbonation.  D: Easy to drink for a 10% DIPA. On the other hand, I might find the second one cloying given how sweet this finishes. Drinkability suffers slightly because of that.  Overall, one of the best DIPAs I've had. As far as Hopslam VS Pliny, they are different. This is bready bready and sweet, Id put Hopslam up against DFH 90 min instead.

287,17112,Prostman81,4.64,"I can't contribute any more than what's already been said about this beer, but it is truly a great beer. The hop aroma and flavor is where this shines. A great blend of citrus, although I detect more on the orange side of things in my batch. This was the first year I've had this so I can't say if this is normal/abnormal for this beer.  The beer isn't one dimensional as I was first expecting. Sure, there's plenty of hop notes going on, but there's also a good blend of malt along with a small honey note. I know honey can dry out a beer when used, so Bell's did a good job adding the honey to boost the ABV while still adding the honey taste, not an easy thing to do. Only a slight alcohol taste to this, but what do you expect, it's 10%. Not enough to detract from all the other positives this has going on.  This is an outstanding beer from a brewery that has created a superb lineup of beers. For me, this is a pretty strong beer, so I can only drink 1 during a sitting, and I generally look for and buy beers that I can enjoy more of.

The aroma of this beer is heavenly. It is super fruity, sweet, caramely. There are hints of bubblegum, oily hops, lavender, and more hops. The aroma is surprisingly sweet for a beer with such a name...I assumed it would have given off a slightly more astringent smell.  The taste is a bit alcoholic. Flavors seem to be well balanced, though. The bitter and the sweet dance in perfect alignment here. This is a creamy, chewy IPA...and I'm loving it. Notes of bubblegum, bitter hops, earthy granola, rye, and caramel in the balance.  Overall this is a sweet beer.

287,17112,seedsofchaos,4.69,"Bought a growler filled with this nectar of the gods at Roof Brother's Spirits in Paducah, Kentucky. We promptly finished the entire growler in one evening. :P  A: Appearance isn't this brew's strong suit but that's not to say that it doesn't look great. Pours a classic amber with some heavier hints of oranges and reds. Carbonation is pretty spot on and active but this was predictable as we just had it bottled from the tap only hours earlier. Head was small with decent retention and lacing but I believe the head only suffered due to the pour from the growler itself.  S: The smell is of grassy, piney and DEFINITELY grapefruit/citrus hops. This is a grapefruit bomb in the nose. The scent is clean and to the point with carbonation showing off and pushing this hop perfume into your nostrils. Very nice!  T: One of the crispest beers I've ever had... It's clean and the malt backbone is in place just enough for the hops not to overwhelm. Low on the side of bittering hops, the taste is as if one squeezed the fresh juices of a just ripened hop cone into their mouth: Truly a blessing for a hophead! On tap (like in this growler), the honey is not as present which I attribute to the honey (sugar) not being allowed to ferment as much as it would during the bottle-conditioning of shipping... It's there, it's just not overstaying it's welcome. All in all, this is a fantastic tasting beer that every beer geek should drink whenever possible.  MF: Again, this is a clean and crisp beer with spot on carbonation. Smooth is the word of the day but ""Nectar of the Gods"" is the phrase of the day. :P  D: Not sessionable, unfortunately. If this thing was 7% ABV and not 10%, I would drink this non-stop... One of these on tap, though, already had given me a nice buzz... By three in I was floating and rearranging my entire livingroom.

Not an overwhelming number of carbonation bubbles in the glass but when I unscrewed the lid it had a nice pop. A decent amount of head given the low number of bubbles. Pretty good lacing after the first few drinks.  The hops scent boils up out of the glass upon pouring. It smells mostly like grapefruit to me. I like that.  First drink, more carbonation that I initially assumed based on the appearance. Pretty smooth for the amount of hops and I definitely get a little sweetness.

Its potent but not overwhelming at all. Also has hints of pine, honey, and hemp.  Has very flavorful hops, honey, pine, and grapefruit. The sweetness hides bitterness from the intense hops. A slight peeper taste helps the hops bounce off your tongue.  Medium-bodied with decent carbonation.  Pretty smooth and sweet fro a hoppy IPA with a high ABV like this. I look forward to Hopslam every January. I was lucky enough to have some on draft in late summer at the Brewpup. It was leftover from a private party batch.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",Imperial IPA,98
287,17112,billshmeinke,4.27,"Obtained through a trade with StormKing47. Bottle into my Lost Abbey tulip.  Pours mid way between honey and amber in color. Somewhat clear brew with tiny bubbles skirting their way to the top. One and a half finger white head composed of tiny bubbles dies down to a very thin layer of foam that is concentrated around the edge of the glass. Tons of lacing left behind.  The nose is incredible. All I can smell is hop based fruit scents. I get apricots, peach, apple juice, pineapple, and mango in no particular order. No trace of alcohol in the nose. Some honey in there as well. As it warms the scent of this beer screams peach and apricots.  The flavor starts off sweet like apple juice or honey with bread and barley in the middle giving way to an onslaught of hop flavor in the form of apricots, peach, pineapple and mango. As the hops begin to slam your palate, the flavors seems more bitter yet balanced by the fruit flavors mentioned above. The finish is quite balanced between bread like flavor, honey sweetness and hop bitterness. Pine and dank resin begin to become more apparent towards the end of the palate as the beer warms. Lingering bitter hops. My only complaint is that the bread and honey/apple juice flavors are a little too strong and somewhat distracting.  Mouthfeel is surprisingly light. I would call it medium bodied. Smooth, not very syrupy as other 10% range DIPAs can become. Tiny bubbles, but not so carbonated as to become prickly.  The drinkability is exceptional for the abv. Drinks like a much lighter beer.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",Imperial IPA,98
287,17112,beejayud,4.85,"HopSlam is a very nice combination of flavors. Instantly you notice the extreme hoppy character and then it mellows off into a sweeter honey flavor. I compair all IPA's to Dogfish 90 min, as being from Milton, DE that is the standard. It would be a nice compliment to a 90 min. Slightly hoppier than the 90 min. and a lot sweeter ending. Overall a very drinkable beer, and I enjoyed every drop.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",Imperial IPA,98
287,17112,OaktownFunk,4.7,"A: Clear, bright, golden orange. Very small off white head that fades quickly. Lots of tiny bubbles.  S: Piney and slightly floral. I also get what I perceive as a ""sweet"" aroma, could be the honey.  T: Hop bitterness smacks the taste buds initially, but fades to a nice sweet finish. Not overly sweet, but leaves a pleasant sweetness on the palate.  M: This beer coats your mouth with what I would describe as ""slickery"". Maybe slightly oily mouth feel. There is some nice bite from the carbonation as well.  D: Very drinkable for a 10% beer. The alcohol leaves you with a nice warming sensation in the belly. I would be happy downing a couple over lunch on the ski slopes.  Overall: This is a VERY good beer. One that I have wanted to try to quite some time and was lucky enough to get my hands on it via trade. I consider Pliny as the standard for all Imperial IPA's and Hopslam more than holds it's own in comparison.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",Imperial IPA,98
287,17112,SiepJones,4.48,"Served from a bottle into a snifter.  The appearance is a copper color that you can see right through. There is an inch of head on this beer.  After putting my nose to the snifter I get a strong scent of floral hops, slightly sweet to the smell.  Upon taking a sip I notice a strong upfront flavor of floral hop that bites the tongue and a slight alcohol tingle. The after taste is somewhat sweet with honey but then changes to an astringent and earthy flavor.  The mouthfeel is very slippery and slick with plenty of carbonation, which tickles the roof of my mouth.  Hopslam has a strong flavor and aftertaste. There is also no hiding the 10% abv which one can feel on their tongue.

This beer is just dripping with fresh juice of mango, pineapple, and grapefruit. One of the most beautiful well rounded beers I have ever tried.

It just looks delicious.  Smell-Aroma is initially full of hops as one would expect from an American IPA, citrus is ever-present (grapefruit & pineapple), but eventually it melts into honey & caramel.  Taste -I wasnt ready for the taste of this, especially because the style of an American Double IPA hides well the sweetness that this beer provides.  I cant wait until next year for its re-release.

A finger collar lasts all the way to the end. Aroma is initially a hop assault, citric, piney, lots of grapefruits, but eventually some honey, caramel and cookie notes provide some balance. Firm on the palate, bitter and hoppy, fruity, with some caramel notes. Honey, cookie round up the taste. Fresh this beer is just amazing. Every time I have it I like it a bit more.

A floral hoppiness lingers in the aftertase.  M: Pretty light bodied with lots of bitterness. Smooth with little spice or heat.  D: It's bitter and has relatively high ABV. However, drinkability is pretty good considering this.  Overall, this is a MUST try for hop lovers.

Floral, citrus, pine, check check check.  T: Powerful hop citrus taste, hint of sweetness. Nice and bitter on the palate as well, slight bit of alcohol burn that I just love.  M: Good carbonation with a hint of syrup.  D: You could get into trouble quick with this beer. Highly drinkable for a 10% IPA.  I still remember how big my eyes got the first time I had this beer. It's been one of those things I only get to try every couple of years because we can't get it in Oregon.

Floral, citrusy, piney, and those hops definitely are pronounced. Absolutely wonderful.  The taste is the best aspect of this beer. It's definitely bold, but not overwhelming. The hops are hard-hitting, but again not overwhelming. It has some bitterness, but it is a good bitterness. Unbelievably well-balanced.  The drinkability is the only thing I can mark this beer down a bit for. But that's not to say it's bad, it's quite great. It's unbelievably drinkable for a hoppy double IPA. Not the most drinkable beer out there, but very drinkable nonetheless.  Overall, the best beer I've ever had. It's great in every department, especially taste. So well balanced.

287,17112,berkey,4.17,"12oz bottle poured into a tulip. No Freshness date listed but it just arrived in a trade Saturday so I'm drinking it as fresh as I possibly can. From notes 03/09/10.  Nice bright orange body is topped by a bright white head that dies down after a few minutes but leaves some nice sticky lacing.  Strong floral nose with some underlying pine aroma. The malt sweetness of the honey is fairly easy to pick out but it's simple, clean, and well integrated considering the ABV.  Honey is a little more obvious than I'd prefer but better applied than many other honey beers. Hops seem slightly more citric than on the aroma. There's a nice bitterness in the aftertaste but as it warms the honey becomes a bigger and bigger part of the overall flavor.  I prefer a cleaner, drier, finish on my DIPA than I'm getting from this beer. The ABV is well masked by the hop profile and by the honey which keeps drinkability very high for the style.  Altogether a very unique and interesting take on the style. Although not exactly to my tastes, I can see why so many enjoy this beer so much.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",Imperial IPA,98

Rocky head slowly fades into a more manageable entity. Very attractive golden straw color with hints of copper.  S: Beautiful. This is right up there with my other favorite aromatic beer, Nugget Nectar. Pungent piney hops all around. This bottle is a couple months old but still smells delicious...I almost forgot about actually drinking it, that's how wonderful it smells.  T: Sweet and sticky. I didn't notice it in the aroma, but as far as taste goes this has faded a bit. Still has a nice hop profile, just not as aggressive as I remember.  M: prickly with a medium body. leaves the mouth rather dry...yearning for the next sip, which is a good thing.  D: I've always felt that Hopslam is WAY too drinkable for 10% abv. I could drink several of these,quickly... if I didn't know better.  A top notch beer. If you've never had it get some, but make sure it is fresh. This beer is amazing, but it fades maybe faster than anything else out there.

M: Slightly syrupy with crisp carbonation from ultrafine bubbles. Like a subdued version of fine champagne.  D: This beer is dangerously drinkable for 10% alcohol. It is very smooth, and I would have no problem drinking several, though I may regret it come the following morning.  Overall, this beer is my favorite double IPA to date.(Admittedly I'm pretty young) It follows the character of the Two Hearted Ale which is probably my favorite standard American IPA with citrus-hop dominating the smell and taste.

287,17112,AVDeuph,4.83,"I can't believe I haven't reviewed this beer yet...  Prior to this 2010 bottle it already stands as my favorite (D)IPA, so please bear in mind the completely unabashed brew-crush I have on this beer.  A- This is a damn fine looking beer. It has one of the most inviting colors in any beer I've seen. Darker than you might expect, with lots of copper, pink, red grapefruit...it's essentially a Florida sunset.  S- I poured this bottle into a DFH snifter....a ton of grapefruit aroma with a steady and astringent alcohol backbone.  T- Where did that alcohol go? If I didn't know any better I would definitely place this beer in the 7% range. The taste of Hopslam is very encompassing....it fills your mouth with a decently sweet citrus bomb that is overbalanced (appropriately) by the actual hop slam that you knew was coming.  M- Thick and just a little syrupy. I imagine the honey has a bit to do with that. I wouldn't mind a touch more carbonation but it isn't a problem by any means. Just a little more life would be nice.  D: Ridiculously good for a 10% beer. Okay, maybe not if you don't like IPAs. But if you do, this is the cleanest, least imposing high gravity beer that I've had. If it wasn't $16 for a six-pack I could make this a session beer.

287,17112,StoneTSR,4.75,"EDIT: Adding updated rating for 2/9/2020. This one is in the can, not bottle, and was canned one month ago on 1/9/2020. No changes to my initial review below. Also, not changing my initial rating numbers, this is just for comparison almost a full decade later - February 2020 vs. March 2010. Wow. I've been on here a long time.  NEW RATING:  A: 4.5 S: 4 - Would describe it the same, but I think the aroma was more unique and seemed stronger in 2010 than now T: 4.75 - Craft and DIPAs have evolved a lot since 2010. Still tastes as originally described, but I have had some better beers since. I completely understand why I gave it a 5 back then. It's still world-class and better than 95% of other DIPAs out there. Impressive. F: 4.75 - This mouthfeel is actually quite incredible. I'm surprised I only gave it a 4. Lighter body that makes this insanely drinkable for a 10% beer O: 4.75 - Yeah, I stand by every word of the original beer. I don't think this beer has changed a bit, if anything it may have been tweaked for the modern palate, but either way, it still stands out as a legit classic at the top of it's class. Not sure what the overall score would be with these new ratings, but it'd still be pretty close to my original.  ORIGINAL REVIEW:  After trailing Hopslam throughout the Chicago Area for about a month, I finally ran into at the bar next door to the bar I work at. I was shocked - it had been there the for weeks and I had no idea. I guess that's what I get for not going to see my friends who work there often enough. Anyhow, the one session I was able to have there, I got...well...a bit out of hand. I didn't realize that it was a 10%er. Fortunately, I found a six pack at my local grocery store and had the opportunity to come home and review it under far more responsible circumstances.  APPEARANCE: Golden, honey color with a foamy half inch head. Hundreds of tiny bubbles continued racing towards the surface even several minutes after the pour. Solid, thick lacing throughout the glass.  SMELL: A hint of honey gives way to a strong hop aroma. The smell almost seems as if it is designed to be a warning to some while also being a welcoming beacon to others. The first sniff heightens the anticipation of the first sip even further.  TASTE: One thing I generally don't like about intensely hoppy beers is how sweet they can get. Sure, some stay on the dry side, but many turn into almost a candy flavored beer. In Hopslam's case, the honey notes are certainly present, but the sweetness of the honey is not overwhelming - it blends nicely with the strong hop flavor.  FEEL: The mouth feel only adds to Hopslam's spectacular drink ability. Tiny bubbles hit the tongue right off the bat and continue to stay lively throughout the entire taste, but the bubbles don't bite.  OVERALL: One of the most drinkable and delicious beers I've had. Hopslam is somehow, intense, smooth, sweet, dry, bitter and delicious all at he same time. As one of my fellow bartenders put it - ""it's like they tried to fit two beers into that one bottle and somehow they fit.""",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",Imperial IPA,98

What a difference. The 2009 had been stored dark, cool (cellar) and was VERY GOOD. BUT contrasted with the FRESH Hopslam it was considerably mellower with a smoother body, lower head and was of a flatter carbonation. The fresh Hopslam had a face slapping citrus bouquet and from the first sip it had a sharp and stringent smack of grapefruit right into the aftertaste.

Medium body, moderate carbonation, sticky, oily and resinny on the tongue with a nice dry finish.  What can i say, this is a very drinkable beer, but I'm finding myself a bit tipsy, so i don't think its very sessionable.

287,17112,augustgarage,4.57,"Big thanks to Brian for bringing a case of this back to share from his recent trip. Poured from a 12oz bottle into a generic wide mouth tulip. Batch #9502  Liquid is a hazy golden orange with amber highlights. A solid yet rocky ivory collar rings around a bonsai-like design of surface bubbles. Fine lacing and faint legs.  Fresh, potent hops assault the senses: hemp, evergreen, mint, sweat, clove, along with faint tropical and citrus notes. The honey coes through next, adding a sweet fruity counterpoint.  Intensely flavorful - pine, tangelo, persimmon, and earth on the palate. The bitterness is well balanced by sugars - but the hops maintain a certain clarity with the sweetness coming from honey rather than malt. Peppery, zesty finish with lingering fruit and hops.  Medium-bodied, creamy, yet the bitterness leaves the gums tingling. Average carbonation which works well for this beer. The alcohol is disguised making this dangerous in the drinkability category.  Quite bitter, but the balance draws you back again and again.

287,17112,tjinohio,4.44,"The initial thing that hits you is the aroma. There is a strong ester of mango as soon as you pour this ale into your glass. That aroma only intensifies as the beer airs. However, there is no mistaking the strong scent of alcohol also. Not surprising, considering the 10% abv of this American Double IPA.  The color is a beautiful orange like that of a maple leaf in the Fall. The head to this beer has been consistently smaller than I would like (this is the fourth out of a 6 pack), but is the delectable color of toasted meringue.  The taste is completion of the aroma- strong esters and alcohol, but with it the wonderful bitterness of the hops. Surprisingly though, with a name like Hopslam, I don't find the hops as dramatic as some other American IPAs. The ale is brewed with honey and, though I don't find the taste of honey pronounced, the sweetness of the honey balances the bitterness of the hops. The aftertaste is almost floral.  The mouthfeel is pleasing. A nice bite blended with an understated carbonation and slight chewiness.  Overall, this is a great drinking experience.

It started off sweet, like honey, but then the hops started to kick in as it went down. The alcohol isn't that strong, could barely taste it. Kind of surprising for a 10% ABV. Good thickness and carbonation. Since the alcohol wasn't that strong, I would almost recommend this as an anytime beer.

Not over whelming at all, but still stands out as a typical IPA. Hazy orange color with a nice thin white head. Exactly what one would expect from a high quality DIPA. Smell and taste is of super citrus hops, but where this one delivers is that taste portion. Not overly bitter, smooth finish with a perfectly sweet aftertaste.

I'll be honest, I kept expecting more, and wasn't getting it, but then it hit me when I was about halfway through that it was tasting great and quenching my desire for a hop flavor. I wasn't slammed with hops, which is a testament to its drinkability.

It's all in the balance of bitter and sweet. Punches you in the mouth with hop, grapefruit, and let's you down easy with a sweet bit of citrus and honey.  Mouthfeel: Strong at first, dryer in the end.  Drinkability: I normally space out the number I have in a night just since it is more scarce than most beers, but it tastes too good not to want one after another and another.

There is all kinds of citris and hops in the aroma and the taste. It is like an explosion of citris and bitterness at the same time, and I like it.  The mouthfeel is quite good.

287,17112,adamette,4.34,"Review from notes. Enjoyed last night from tap into a standard pint glass at Ballantines in Willoughby as a part of their ""IPAlooza"" program (28 IPA's in 28 days).  A Translucent, light caramel body which might be lighter than the bottle version. I seem to recall that it was a bit more cloudy. Reasonable light brown creamy head but this might have been minimized by the bartender. 3.5  S Tart hops and malt goodness. A classic smell of a great beer. Inviting, interesting, potent. 4.5  T Floral hops with a significant malt sweetness and a warmth of alcohol that is all presented really nicely. This beer is sweet, sour and is bold in its tastes. 4.5  M Syrupy thickness along with that hops tartness, big, bold feel. 4.5  D This is a delicious beer that I cannot have too much of since it is so big with big ABV. 4.0",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",Imperial IPA,98
287,17112,jeffthecheff,3.21,"Thanks Greg for the bottle.  Poured in to a tulip, its medium gold in color and quite hazy. On top sits a white head with good consistency. It starts off as one finger large and then recedes into a solid cap.  The aroma is weaker than I expected. It really isn't that intense at all. It has a general citrus and pine aroma, I would guess it uses Centennial and Simcoe in the hop bill. It's balanced more towards the pine, with just a touch of peach. It's a nice aroma, but it's on the weak side as far as DIPA's go.  The flavor of the beer is mostly focused on being brutally bitter. It is similar to licking the peel of a very bitter grapefruit. It's a bit harsh, but in a way that makes me want more. The sweetness to this beer is vague. There is no caramel, and the honey doesn't add enough for it to be recognized blindly. I can tell however that this beer uses highly fermentable sugars like honey, because the malt has no impact and lets the hops do their thing. Besides bitterness, the hops add a slight grapefruit flavor and some pine and menthol notes on the finish. There is also a touch of alcohol.  The palate is medium bodied with a relatively high carbonation. As it went on, I felt it was too much. I enjoyed the beer, but it needs more hop aroma and flavor....which isn't a good thing to be saying about a DIPA. I usually prefer aromatic DIPA's, and can care less about bitterness, so this isn't a favorite of mine.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",Imperial IPA,98

287,17112,MrDanno96,3.99,"A: Pours a slightly hazy golden-amber color with about a finger of fluffy white head. The head dissipated a little fast than I would have liked, though. Lots of sticky lace on the sides of the glass.  S: A pretty incredible sweet nose on this one. Tons of fragrant grapefruit dominates the nose. A mix of pine and a little honey is also detectable.  T: Sweet tropical fruit dominates the flavor as well: pineapple and grapefruit. These flavors sit atop a malty backbone that transitions into a somewhat grainy (but not bitter) finish. Some honey comes trough in the finish too. Hop bitterness really takes a back seat and is almost nonexistent. The flavor is good, but it's almost too sweet (especially as the brew warms). I would have liked to see a little more bitterness to balance out the impressive array of sweet flavors.  M: A nice medium body with an appropriate amount of carbonation. The 10% abv is well hidden in the flavor, but you can feel it warming on the way down.  D: Definitely a good DIPA, but I don't agree with the majority that this is an amazing quaff. The flavor lacked the hop bitterness necessary to balance the high level of sweetness. I think perhaps ""Grapefruit Slam"" would be a more appropriate name. I would be interested to taste this without any honey added - I bet the flavor would have better balance.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",Imperial IPA,98
287,17112,BeerGodz,4.97,"On Tap @ The POPE  Look: Golden amber, clear, with a a medium head and decent lacing (perhaps it was the glass?)  Smell: Massive citrus hop aroma! Malt and a slight amount of honey also present  Taste: Up Front: Sweet malt and hops do battle, grapefruit, apricot. Finish: Honey, with malt and hops still duking it out  Mouthfeel: Medium body, incredibly smooth and balanced!  Drinkability: Alcohol is well hidden, uber-drinkable, but watch out, it's a shit kicker!  Overall Impression: I started and ended my session with the mighty HopSlam. This is the best Double IPA I've had to date! That may not last though, because Pliny the Elder and Pliny the Younger are coming to Philly on March 1. (Edit: as it turns out, I actually preferred Hopslam to Younger, making this the 2nd best Double IPA, second only to Elder)  This beer reminds me of Boulder's Mojo in that it has honey and apricot flavors in addition to the typical grapefruit. Of course it's much higher octane, and the flavors are significantly more intense. Truly Nectar of the Godz!",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",Imperial IPA,98
287,17112,indiapaleale,4.32,"Pour - a beautiful shade of orangish auburn with some bright hues and a big fluffy white head. Looks fairly innocent although it pours a bit viscous.  Aroma - hops, hops galo re. Along with a boat load of sticky, resiny hops there is a good amount of sweet malt aroma. Its a bit skunky and syrupy as well. Its smells big.  Taste - my tongue is numbed and my stomach is warmed. Hopslam does both simultaneously. Big chewy hop flavors combine extremely well with a ton of malt sweetness which boosts that ABV to double digits. Plenty of citrus bitterness and astringent hop flavors to satisfy even the most staunch of hopheads.  Overall - a behemoth of an IPA that probably should leave you satisfied after one but more than likely pushes you to have another. There is a lot of hype that is for sure but it definitely delivers what it promises. The fact that a beer of this strength is as smooth and balanced as it is really makes this a standout offering from Bell's.  Would I buy more of it? - yes.

Hints of sweet malts are also present.  T: Taste is out-freaking-standing. Sweetness hits up front, not honey or sweet malts, but some fruitiness, possibly mango. Then the hops take over with a sharp citrus flare. Grapefruit and some pineapple are present. Honey mingles in and blends ridiculously well.

The head doesn't last, but it does leave behind some lacing.  S - Hands down the best aspect of the beer. One of the best smelling beers I've ever had. Huge, gushing pineapple notes lead the charge, followed by some pine notes. Some pale malt notes in the background.  T - Follows the smell pretty well. The pineapple is still pretty dominant, but not quite as much. Some other citrus notes follow with just a little bit of pine. Pale malts provide a light and barely lingering sweetness. There is a bit of evident alcohol, but it doesn't really intrude.  MF - Pretty high carbonation, and it works really well. The body isn't really light, but the carbonation makes it feel almost so. Makes for a nice slick feel. Finish is pretty sticky. Does a lot for drinkability.  D - See above. Really good. It's hard to knock the evident alcohol since it's not strong or intrusive. Hopslam sure doesn't taste like 10%, but it naturally does catch up.  Edit: In my review of Founders Double Trouble last week, I said it wasn't as good as Hopslam.

287,17112,UglyBaby,4.82,"I just found a lil store by the house that has a great selection of craft beer and if they don't have they will get it. I walked into the store I had never been in before with no real plan I knew I wanted an IPA but could have gone with a good stout. In picking the owners brain and talking beer with the guy he suggested this hoppy lil number. So on with the review.  This Yummy lil number poured from the bottle, no date that I could find, into a Sam Adams glass with an attractive orange copper colour to it. A nice fat head of dusty white billowed early but fell to a layer of spitty skim in short time. Gobs of lace clinged to my glass in the aftermath. The carbonation is moderate and persistent. This looks like a good one. Clear and clean as well.  As soon as I popped the top it hit me in the nose with a great fresh citrus fresh ripe sweet ruby red grapefruit/passion fruit punch aroma that I love so much in an DIPA. The nose is rife with green hoppy aromatics like holding a hand full of fresh hop pellets to your nose. At any rate the nose is succulent. Grassy and herbal. Fruity. Pines. Resin. Sap. You can almost smell the dryness.  The taste is Grrreat! Ahhhh! It is dry from the jump. Citrus flavours abound. I almost feel like putting an umbrella in this one. I would surely say there is some grapefruit, pineapple and mango impression here, but the aforementioned fruit that I am so hard pressed to identify lends its presence to the mix as well, maybe apricot. The alcohol is almost completely obscured and it works so well in tandem with the hop properties. This is an amazing beer expereince.  The mouthfeel is smooth and comes in at a medium level. The flavours morph and twist making this thing a magic act in its own right.  The drinkability is easy for me. I live for a beer like this. A total sensory bludgeoning with precision and complexity. The feeling of well being that has settled upon me is wonderous. This is easily my favorite beer from Bell's. Is this going to be an annual release or a one off? Please, keep it coming!

There's also a good deal of alcohol.  Taste: the sweet malts fighting with the bitter hops is great.

Every citrus you could think of with a hint of honey in the middle.  [T:] A close to perfection balance of sweet to bitter I think. Fruits and the honey really shine.

Lively grapefruit, bright citrus notes abound. If only this could be bottled and sold as ambrosia. What a lovely burst of pineapple and fruit aromas. So very inviting.  Taste - Resin and oily entry, coating the tongue with the expected presence of hops to the max. Suprisingly the ABV is exceedingly well hidden. I almost (almost!) taste some sweet malt backbone here. Perhaps I'm reaching, however there is a relief here from the hop onslaught.  Mouthfeel - Slick and coating, as you would expect from a hop-bomb. There is a density here with ample carbonation assisting.  Drinkability - The ABV is well-hidden here, giving the feeling that you could continue enjoying these one after another.

287,17112,Morey,4.53,"This inviting brew pours a very pale orange color when held up to the light. There is a slight haze to it, but otherwise, it's pretty clear. Head has settle to a thin lace with some areas of bubbles. Good head retention, especially for being so high in alcohol.  Smells of hops and honey with slight earthy notes also making themselves known.  Taste- The combination of hops and the honey make this a unique tasting DIPA. You get the bitterness, and then in comes the honey (and perhaps a little malt too) to round this beer out.  Mouthfeel is spot on. The way the honey coates the mouth after the hops is really what makes this beer. And there's very little carbonation to get in the way.  VERY drinkable for 10%. Hopslam hides the alcohol as well as Unearthly (which is 11%). If getting wasted wouldn't get it the way, I could session this beer no problem.  Morey's Bottom Line: I know that there's a lot of hype around this beer, but it lives up to it. If it weren't a limited seasonal the hype wouldn't be so blown up. Plus, I think that it's fun to get excited about beer. Right now, this is definitely my favorite beer.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",Imperial IPA,98

The honey is clearly there to soothe the soul of the hops and give you a smooth sweet finish. As much as I hate cliches, the best way i could put this...This beer is like drinking flowers dipped in honey. Mouthfeel and Drinkability: The carbonation and tang of the hops really make your mouth water. The honey smoothing out the hops really makes this beer very drinkable.

A very tasty DIPA.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",Imperial IPA,98
287,17112,civilizedpsycho,3.95,"Appearance: Has a beautiful pale amber color that is very clear. Has a nice head that provided some decent lacing.  Smell: Has a nice aroma of peaches/pineapple. These smells really masked the hop aroma and alcohol aroma.  Taste: Has a bit of a generic fruit flavor that might be leaning toward pineapple. Has a very strong hop kick which I loved. Very good.  Mouthfeel: Has a decent body from the carbonation. Feels as if there's a bit more to it than just water.  Drinkability: The alcohol content brings this down a notch for me. The taste is fantastic and if it had an ABV of 5%, I would probably give this a 5 in drinkability. However, the high ABV keeps me from drinking fair portions of this beer.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",Imperial IPA,98
287,17112,jdflyer06,4.32,"Poured from a 12 oz. bottle into a pint glass.  A: Golden honey in color. Clear with a modest amount of bubbles rising from the bottom. Even after an agressive pour the head doesn't last very long. Some moderate lacing but pretty light as well.  S: Very piney up front with some citrus/grapefruit notes that impart a bitter character in the nose. Some sweet malt tones make their way through accentuated by the honey. This certainly has all the makings of a hop monster.  M: Fairly smooth in character with a dry finish. Not overly sticky or cloying like many other Imperial/Double IPA's. A bit of carbonated bite. The alcohol is there but is pretty well hidden considering it tops out at 10%. The hop oils and alcohol do dry out the palate a bit but that's to be expected.  T: The bitterness from the hops hits you up front with some nice piney and citrus notes as it settles. Malty and sweet but not overly so. This beer is just about perfectly balanced. Some breadiness as it warms  O: Drinkability is fairly high on this one although I wouldn't recommend it. At $16.99 per six, this one is meant to be enjoyed, not sessioned. It's very good, but it's not the best and the price is a bit of a turn-off, but it's worth it, once. I'm drinking three and cellaring the rest. A very good offering from Bell's.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",Imperial IPA,98
287,17112,blivingston1985,4.35,"Hopslam, Hopslam, Hopslam. We've heard so much about you over the last months. Your production, being limited, makes you a rare commodity even before you hit the marketplace. It gives your fans that extra little bit of satisfaction knowing that they hold in their steins, their goblets, their Solo cups a delicious, golden slice of ""Hop Heaven""(no relation to the beer) that can only be quaffed, but once a year.  You also get a little bit hyped up...  Don't get me wrong. This is a delightful beer. Strong, yet smooth. A wonderful high quality craft brew. Yet I can't help but feel a little disappointment. And it has nothing to do with the beer itself. It IS the hype around this ale and others like it that gives me this disappointment. Sometimes you go into trying a beer you have read about with expectations. Expectations gives you an unrealistic bar to measure by. All beers need to be reviewed with a lack of expectations. Now... On to the goods.  Purchased 6-Pack for $16.99 @ Liquor Depot in Tampa.  Poured in a glass pint. Color is a copper/gold. Very nive release of carbination as it is poured forming a good creamy head(over 1/4 inch) that slowly breaks down to a superb lacing.  The smell is just like it says it tastes like. lots of hops. Lots of honey. Slight alcohol. Well hidden buy the overpowering hops.  Taste is quite good. High quality hops hit up front like a bitter punch in the mouth, only to be quickly quelled by the sweet richness of the dark honey. Finish is much like the first taste. Starts bitter then fades to a mellow honey. The honey gives an almost oily characteristic to the ale. Like a drop of pure honey on the tongue. Very nice. Quite drinkable for a bitter Double IPA.  Bell's is one of my top picks for Michigan breweries. Hopslam Ale is a Top DIPA. Brewed in Comstock. Not Kalamazoo.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",Imperial IPA,98
287,17112,JMC_TM,4.62,"Had this great beer in the bottle and on draft at the Flying Saucer in Charlotte, NC  This big beer is an Imperial or a double IPA. It pours a hazy orange with a nice head frothy white head that leave lacing going down the glass, assuming you can drink it slow enough! The nose is full of juicy pineapple and citrusy hops that seem to jump out of the glass at you. A bitter ale for the most part, but somewhat smooth with some lingering sweetness from a decent malt backbone. Leaves you a bit dry and certainly takes the edge off after a hard day! It weighs in at a strong 9.5% abv.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",Imperial IPA,98
287,17112,mjn5036,4.42,"Poured from 12 oz bottle into a large snifter. Pours a radiant golden orange/yellow color, like the color of raw honey. Large white head grows and then dies, leaving decent lacing clingy to the glass for dear life. Decent appearance. Initial smell is inviting...hoppy bitterness, citrusy sweetness and pine and citrus hops all dominate. Amazing smell. The taste virtually lives up to the nose. It is super hoppy, nice and bitter and warming. The lack of maltiness is a nice change from some other brews. This beer doesn't need it to balance it out, it is just plain delicious on its own. The grapefruit and citrus reign supreme on my taste buds. Honeydew and honey dance gingerly on my palate. Mmmm. A decent body and well hidden alcohol content make this beer very drinkable. A truly great beer.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",Imperial IPA,98
287,17112,noduckla,4.27,"I had this on tap in St Louis at a pizza joint. It poured beautifully with about an 1.5' of head with OK lacing. The smell was hops, pine, and citirus and lasted well after the initial few sips. It really had a wonderful aroma that lasted well through the first half of the pint. Taste was close to smell - citrus and hops with a clean dry finish. It did not have a strong alcohol taste familiar with lesser IPAs and that would normally tire the pallet. It was a well carbonated beer with good drinkability. The pine/citrusy taste would be a little over-powering after more than a couple.  I would definitely need to have this again. Would be great with something spicey - crawfish or chicken wings.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",Imperial IPA,98
287,17112,mrandypandy,4.35,"12oz bottle from Hop City in Atlanta.  A- Pours a crystal clear orange/gold. Lively carbonation and a frothy white head. Very nice lacing. S- An assault of citrus hops. If an IIPA could smell ""juicy"", then this would be it. Grapefruit dominates, some pine. T- The hop assault continues into the taste. Heavy citrus hops with a bit of dry sweetness in the finish. The alcohol is well hidden. Tasty. M- Medium body, finishes a bit dry. D- Pretty high, especially for the style and high ABV. Goes down super smooth and the lack of an alcohol presence makes this decievingly easy to drink.  Overall - A top ten IIPA and worthy of all the praise that comes it's way.

The first one I had was only 10 days old when I got ahold of it. The nose was insane amounts of citrus, in particular pineapple. The taste; WOW! Sweet floral hops, pineapple, fresh white bread, clean sugars, and very little malt. Minimal lacing but this is a 10% alcohol beer.

Aroma is awesome. Lots of fruity aroma hops with a slight malti sweetness. Pineapple, peach. Smells really good.  Taste is great. It's sweet but not overly thick. More like a sugar sweetness. Great hop flavor and bitterness. Really great balance.  Mouthfeel is great. I like the maltiness without the viscosity. Great carb.

A massive, frothy white head left great lacing throughout.  The smell is insane! Citrus is dominant, primarily grapefruit, with honey and a pine like spice.  Taste lives up to the smell. The grapefruit comes through, the hops give a huge bite, but the honey seems to keep the zing from becoming too much.  Thick, but smooth in the mouth. The carbonation keeps it crisp and lively.

Some alcohol is present but it's masked by the aforementioned aromas.  T- OH MY! Just str8 goodness! The citrus is sooo fresh. A grapefruit/orange taste mixed with a pine flavor and a hint of honey to throw in the mix. OH did I mention HOPS. There is a bit of a spice at the end but there is not a burn, just a hint of spice as if the beer gods are reminding me that this one is 10+ ABV.

I feel the hops and citrus dancing on my pallet coupled with the perfect amount of carbonation. SMOOTH!!!!  D- I'm almost glad (not really) I can only get this beer a few months out of the year. If it was available any longer I would be broke. I don't think twice b4 spending $57.00 on a case of this beer. It must be noted that this beer is extremely dangerous. It is so smooth that I could drink it alll night long. As a matter of fact, I have. I indeed was slammed. This beer just makes me happy!

Honey tones down the hops and is just a great compliment. Man this is just heaven and I am not a IPA/DIPA fan at all either.  M - Seems like the honey coats my tongue a bit.

M: This area is lacking a little bit, but it's surprising that they get it to be so light-bodied for a 10% ABV beer.  D: The best feature of this beer.

Aroma is strongly hoppy with gratuitous grapefruit, orange peel, spicy and floral hops, and an underlying malt sweetness. Tastes hopped up with pine, oranges, lemon, and grapefruit. Spicy hops on the midpalate with a big earthy hops, alcohol, and cookie finish. Medium bodied with a full but not quite prickly amount of carbonation, sticky with flora and earth. Quite a tasty DIPA, though a bit spicy for me, with alcohol and caramel malt standing out a bit too much on the finish to make this one of my favorites.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",Imperial IPA,98

A little on the sweet side for a 10% ABV, but that's not necessarily a bad thing. Honey, nutty, citrusy...a beautiful blend of hops. I wouldn't drink more than 2 of these at a time, although you easily could.  The price and availability are obvious downfalls. I think it's ridiculous to pay $19 for a 6-pack (going rate around here, if you even had a chance to buy), but I realize this is a blossoming business, so obviously breweries are going to take advantage of the opportunity.

A nice, clear golden orange with healthy carbonation levels. It's one of those thick, dense looking beers where the carbonation slowly creeps out. Quite nice, though.  S: Insanely huge aroma, with sweet fruits and honey, citrus zest, cherries, floral and resinous notes... phenomenal.  T: Candied maraschino cherries, resinous hops, with a bit of bite combined with an overwhelming sweetness that smooths it all out. There might be some mild tart apple in there, too. It was better on draft, but still so good in the bottle.  M: Ideal - good density and carbonation, nice, mouth-filling consistency.  D: One of the most famous beers around, and for good reason.

It's an almost bright yellow color with sediments dancing like $2.00 Sea Monkeys. Oddly, this almost smells like a pina colada to me. It was really surprising and really unique. This is an extremely smooth beer. Unlike many IPAs, the bitterness hides underneath the sweetness. Boy, a guy could get use to drinking these. 10% ABV? These will get you in trouble fast.

287,17112,mdcrouser,4.47,"Pours orange-gold - a definite beacon of unique color in a world of beers that all too often look alike. A full finger of head is reduced to a thin cap of carbonation.  The smell might remind you of a glass of orange juice - so fruity, and even juicy. Seems like you could squeeze the glass and get more than just the 12 oz.  Hop bomb to the utmost, though it remains incredibly juicy, sweet, and with only a mildly trailing bitterness toward the end.  A spark of carbonation touches on the tongue, paving the way for the introduction of the hops, which then stick around for a long time, warm and lingering.  Really enjoyable in that it's completely unique and wholly consuming, moreso than almost anything else on the market - that makes it highly drinkable, but to a point given that it is so big - two beers is that point.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",Imperial IPA,98

Again more pine than citrus, but tons of both.

EDIT: I don't know whatever possessed me to give this brew an ""A"". Someone should have kicked my ass. After sampling, & sampling, & sampling this again & again, this might be the best IIPA on the planet.

Had this from a bottle numerous times and have already managed to find myself bellied up to the bar at Sonka Irish Pub multiple times this week. Sweet nectar!  Pours a light amber color with a very thin white head. Slightly cloudy but this quickly becomes nearly clear. A good looking beer!  What a nose on this guy! Definitely one of the best smelling beers around. Loads and loads of citrusy fruits. And hops - a quick whiff lets you know this thing is just loaded with them! I find myself stuffing my nose into my pint glass every single time I take a drink!  An outstanding beer. Very sweet to start off...not honey sweet, but fruit sweet. Then the hoppiness begins. A small amount of the piney hops are certainly in there along with a grapefruit / orange peel blast that really smacks you. How wonderful to have a lingering taste that is both sweet and bitter. Long after a drink has been swallowed, I'm able to dig some more sweet-bitter out of the corners of my mouth. This beer is truly a prize for hopheads. The malt is virtually non-existent as the power of the hops is obviously the focus of this brew. This is quite a mouthful too - smooth for sure, with the alcohol fairly well masked.  Overall, this is a phenomenal beer. I'll keep heading to the pub to try and get my fill before the last keg runs dry.

Before this year's batch came out, I found a 6-pack of last year's in a local deli and bought it. I was PSYCHED, as I hadn't had it in a year and remembered it being one of the best around. Maybe it was that particular batch, but it did NOT age well.  Essentially, the honey that the beer is brewed with came through, full force, and it just tasted like a honey beer.

287,17112,JoshRadTxist,4.94,"Manna from heaven drank from a clay mug.  A: Ample head (&gt; 1 cm) subsides after a few minutes / pulls. A thin archipelago of well-sized bubbles remains through the life of the glass (20 minutes tops). Shine flashlight down the mug and it's golden, almost clear.  S: Grapefruit-tangerine, honey, pine.  T: First to mention: the sweet honey aftertaste, echoing off the everpresent hops. The hops are surprisingly subtle for a beer named, Hopslam. For me it's not as hop-centric as Sierra Nevada ( a go-to)--much more complex. Bread is in there, a heartiness, a healthiness.  M: Thick and effervescent. I think my breath is pretty good after drinking this!  D: Nectar of the gods! Belches reminiscent of the drink. Logical evolution of Two-Hearted Ale. I like it better than competitors I've tasted.

287,17112,Duhast500,5,"My 325th review, I have wait some time to finally have a Hopslam.  Poured from a 12oz. bottle into a stemmed glass.  The color is a hazy orange with three fingers of white foamy head and some really nice lacing.  The smell is HOPPY, a great floral flavor is up fount and gives me visions of the first day of spring. A garden with the flowers blooming. Some nice citrus, juicy flavor in the background that makes me a bit thirsty.  The taste is serious hops, better than the smell, the taste of the hops on your tongue is bitter but well tooled to keep you interested for the next go round. Fruits come out to wash the tongue with the bitter hops and first this beer some amazing depth beyond it's namesake hops. Some apple, orange, and tease of banana comes out slightly within the hops and is wash into the storm of hops.  This feel of this beer is a pleasant medium body. It had some nice carbonation that gave this beer a bit of a zing. It is one of the best beers I have had and I really want to have this year round but I know my pleasure is only limited.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",Imperial IPA,98
287,17112,dborginis,4.47,"Picked this up on a business trip. With the high ABV, the little hotel glass worked perfectly! Pours with just about no head. Very clear copper. Could be confused for a similar amount of whiskey.  Smell is of sweet citrusy hops and metal. First sips is very welcome. I needed a hop fix and this hit the spot. Citrus hops flavor is first and strongest. Also in there is the strictly bitter hop flavor, in the aftertaste, or if you really pay attention past the citrus. Rounding it out is the sugary honey flavor. Even though there was no head, carbonation is spot on.  Drinkability: I may be getting a false sense of comfort here because I had a big dinner, but not feeling it too badly yet. Even with all this flavor, I'd like a lower ABV. A few bottles are great, but I'd rather stock up on Nugget Nectar since it has a lower ABV.  Is it better than Pliny the Younger? As far as I can remember, very similar to me.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",Imperial IPA,98
287,17112,mutterfudder,4.72,"Before I review this beer, I have to give a shoutout to hayesez. If not for his generosity, I wouldn't have had a chance to try this amazing beer. Thanks so much Erik!  Poured from a 12-oz bottle into a Stone IPA tulip.  A - Copper color with a lightly hazy body. The head pours rocky white and crawls its way down the glass.  S - Erik had said this beer was one of the best he'd smelled. He wasn't lying! Floral and piney hop notes with a touch of sweetness in the background. It really is one of the best smelling beers I've experienced. The smell died down in intensity as the head dissipated.  T - The wonderful flavor mimics the nose. The biggest surprise is how there is quite a malty flavor that goes on with the hop and honey notes. The malts dance nice with the pine notes and a mellow honey sweetness that ties back to the malts.  M / D - The mouthfeel is sharp and coating. The beer is incredibly drinkable, and I was sad that I only had one bottle to drink.  Hopslam is a serious contender to some of the big-name IPA/DIPA's out there. It shows incredible balance and has an interesting chameleon flavor profile that can highlight any key flavor of the beer on a given sip. Very tasty.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",Imperial IPA,98
287,17112,marvin213,4.49,"A darker tint of straw-colored, the head forms decently enough. Lacing along the glass sides indicates a hop presence. ;^) Though this isn't my inaugural Hopslam experience, I must acknowledge the beverage looks ordinary enough....  Whoa! With the aroma, the beer begins to become distinguished. The nose is bittersweet honey-hop happiness. Though it smells so hoppily bitter, the honey has appeal like the Winnie the Pooh. The vapor smells strong enough to dissuade some novices, but I detect a craft beer lover's dream!  As the label suggests, it's what you'd expect from a brew dubbed Hopslam. It's bitter, biting badassness. I'd like to drink this straight from the vessel because--like most hop bombs--it'll deteriorate quickly with age. Not only will the hops fade, but the leftover maltiness will neutralize honey influence. It's not a complicated beverage, and perhaps that's what makes it so special. A real hop bomb with a near-perfect complement. It's an outstanding concoction.  The potency and biting bitters seem to force a mouthhold. I've seen the YouTube fools chug a 120, but I think the Hopslam might prove even more challenging. I know they're out there (I have yet to search), but this is a brew meant to sip and to savor. It tingles bittersweetness, and it's a shame that it's affect is absent (even if you keep the bottles) by March.  Aside from the 10%, the oh-so-brief availability most hampers drinkability. Brilliant marketing and economics perhaps (and maybe it relates to the natural hop-growth process), but why is this beer available only in January? Great to start the year, certainly, but what about spring sippers? Summer sloshers? Autumn audibles? Winter...well, we should simply enjoy why we have it--great beer!",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",Imperial IPA,98

Aroma is reserved but nice, lots of citrus, tangerine and hop oils. Taste is smooth, unreasonable smooth, no overwhelming alcohol burn or lip-puckering bitterness. This is a very smooth, hoppy beer, almost like a regular IPA, which is good as a lot of IPAs are far too overwhelming. This is a well-crafted brew. Lots or citrus, grapefruit mixing with a leafy hoppiness and honey to produce a very good beer. Finishes with a reserved but fresh bitterness to end the brew perfectly.

T: That is soooo good! Full of citrus, orange, tangerine, faint lemon, slightly sweet with a nice malt profile, a hint of honey, very floral and a little grassy on the finish.

Looks good for the style. The complete opposite of the last beer I reviewed.  Citrus, pine, earth, grass (not like shitty crab grass, the good stuff!), with a little sweet toasty in the way back. No yeast character. Very clean smelling.  Fruit (apricot, pineapple), tart, resinous pine. A smidge of something like Victory or something very low kilned, yet toastier than pale or two-row. A warm alcohol devoid of astringent, solvent-like harshness, which I believe the honey adjunct to be responsible for. Pine in the finish and while a little sticky, fine for the example. Big, bold, and balanced.&lt;----alliteration, check it!  Light and puckering, deceivingly refreshing and questionably quaffable.&lt;--- #2, that's what you call killing  Extremely drinkable, yet so high in alcohol. How much is a pliny, again? Could this one come down in alcohol a little, or have something related yet easier on the liver? Then again, I've never had it aged, so I might have to change my tune.

Spotty lacing and very clear with some surface foam and a nice collar of carbonation. The nose is all tropical fruits with a touch of the alcohol and malt making itself known. Tastes like the nose with the tropical hops just blasting your tongue. As I drink the hops later show some dank/piney/earthy flavors as well. Very nice flavor. There's some mild bitterness in there too with the malt presence really hitting you for a second on the finish and then just fades out with everything else. Its got a touch of sweetness as well. The carbonation seemed a tad low perhaps on this bottle. Other bottles were fine. Nice and full bodied. The drinkability is great and I could easily knock down a couple. Very smooth and memorable.

Poured from a 12oz. bottle.  Appearance: Bright orange body, slightly hazy with a thick and fluffy head that won't let up. The lacing left behind on the glass is thick and gorgeous.  Smell: Tangerine, melon, pine and juicy hops. Very fresh smelling. Smells delicious.  Taste: Tastes like it smells. More melon than citrus with a touch of sweetness. The piney hops are felt more in the finish and aftertaste. I was expecting a more aggressive hops presence but found it to be quite reserved. The main flavor is the fresh and ripe fruit.  Mouthfeel: Incredibly well-balanced and very smooth. Palate pleasing for sure.  Drinkabilty: This is 10%? No heat whatsoever in the taste. Drinks remarkably well and could have easily had the whole bottle to myself :)  Overall: I must admit to being a little let down as i had it pegged as more of a hop monster (the name kind of leads you along that way) but it is a very tasty DIPA and worth seeking out.

287,17112,ricke,4.51,"Pours a rather murky orange color with a medium-sized head that leaves some lacings. The color of the beer is surprisingly reminiscent of exotic fruit juice...  ...and so is the smell. This is almost ridiculous, so much hops and exotic fruit aromas. Grapefruit, mango, passion fruit, you name it. Some notes of pine-needles and a honey-like smoothness that seems to blend everything together and round everything off to a fantastic hoppy juicy whole. This is one of the most impressive aromas I've ever come across in a beer.  And the flavor is no disappointment either. I could easily describe this simply as hop juice. Grapefruit, mango, passion fruit, all kinds of exotic fruits come together in a beautiful combination that is really reminiscent of tropical fruit juice or nectar. The sweet and fresh malty backbone that isn't as ""caramelly"" as most malt profiles in Double IPAs are, really adds to this. Perhaps a note of nettles and tobacco. The finish is smooth with a prominent bitterness (again, much more restrained than most Double IPAs), pine-needle hops, grass and more juicy hops.  It's rather full-bodied and very smooth for the style, but still dry enough in the finish. This one drinks dangerously easy.  This is one of the coolest beers I've had the pleasure to drink.

The smell is...but hop and malt, and surprisingly balanced. There's a rich hop character that's just mixed in with this but sweet malt presence. If I say so...the whole thing smells thick, but not in a bad way...just very full flavored.  Glug glug glug  A mellow sweetness hit and is very quickly over taken by an array of hop flavors. Much more herbal than sweet IMO. There is definitely a clover honey kind of taste from both the malt (for the sweetness) and the hops (for the clover/floral flavor). Over all this is a big DIPA that I already know gets better as it warms and the hops begin to flourish more distinctly. Possibly a bit of fruitiness towards the end of the flavor.

If you like hops, this one is for you... it is a delicious and super hoppy... you will also know that you just drank something that was more than a regular beer in alcoholic percentage... however, you want another... the taste is strong of citrus and hops (of course) and I couldn't help but want more...

287,17112,cooncat,4.4,"Poured at fridge temp into a std. pint glass. On a vigorous pour, you get a tangerine yellow colored brew, with a creamy firm head of decent size. Head retention is impressive for a beer of 10% abv. Small splashes of lacing decorate the glass if you give it a swirl.  Nose is a hop lover's delight. Absolutely huge in citrus and pineapple hop aromas. If you took some fresh hop cones and rubbed them in your hand and took a whiff, you'd get something like the aroma of this DIPA.  Taste follows the nose in that the hop onslaught is up front and in your face. There is a bit of malt sweetness, but just enough to balance things out. Lots of grapefruit mainly, with some tangerine and pineapple in the back ground. Mouthfeel is medium-full. I don't know if I can give a high drinkability to a 10% brew, as that would be irresponsible. However, if you just wanted to have a night of in your face hops, who am I to argue. You might be totalled after 3 of these though, so enjoy responsibly. (besides, a sixer of this will set you back about twice the price of a regular craft beer sixer)  Unlike Two Hearted, this isn't a single hop brew. Not being a fan of a straight Centennial IPA, I'm not a fan Two Hearted, but this Hopslam could be addicting .. in a good way. Looking for a good DIPA? Look no further.

287,17112,Ranbot,4.3,"There are 1,500+ reviews about this beer so I'm going to slack a little on the details of my tasting experience, but here are the basics: It's hard to believe that a 10% Imperial IPA goes down so smoothly. The hops are mostly of the citrusy and floral variety, and they seem to pop out the most when it's cold. As it warms up the the sweetness of the pale malt body really opens up. There is easily recognizable an alcohol hotness to it that builds as the beer warms up too. As far as drinkability goes it's a bit of both worlds. When it's cold and the citrusy hops are in the forefront it down really fast, but when it warms up the alcohol becomes really apparent and I find myself sipping very slowly at it. At 10% people probably shouldn't be drinking too many Hopslams in a sitting anyway.  Overall, I have to agree with the masses that for the style this brew is excellent and I rated it as such. However, I don't feel slammed by hops as much I feel slammed by alcohol and malt. I'm sure Bells threw a lot of hops into the brew kettle for this, but I think they are still having some difficulty overcoming the very sweet malts and high alcohol content. If you're fan of high ABV beers and hops, I have no doubt that you're going to like the Hopslam. But if you like your IPAs to showcase hops, like I do, then I think there are better options out there. For my money, I think Bell's Two Hearted IPA makes a better use of hops and is a better beer, in general, but the brews are different styles, so maybe I shouldn't be making the comparison. Do yourself a favor and try the Hopslam yourself.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",Imperial IPA,98
287,17112,babaracas,4.31,"2010 - Bottled 1/5/2010 (boo FL distro). Pours a mostly clear amber, two finger offwhite head settles to a quarter inch, some lacing. Smell: sweet tropical fruit and a little citrus, resinous, very nice if not a bit straightforward. Taste: tropical fruit, herbal and a little spicy, a little citrus zest. Medium bodied, juicy, bitter, and sweet. The sweetness has a little honey aspect, though it might have been suggested... more (lots of) sugary pale than caramel/toffee. This is quite good, but I'm glad I didn't pay $20+/6er... would like to try it super fresh though.  2011 - Wow, much harder to find this year. But got here fast - 10 day old Hopslam. Nose is grapefruit rind and pineapple, resinous, pine tinged, more sweet tropical fruit in the back. Taste: grapefruit and lemon zest, tropical fruit, spicy with a slight spruce character. Sweet, but the body is lightened with the honey addition, some of which comes across at the end of the sip.

It's a perfectly crisp bite. It's a very sharp hop taste that is complemented by the smell you get when you take a drink. The mouthfeel is very light and crisp.  It has a great finish and honestly, you don't feel like you're drinking a 10% ABV beer.  I think that's what sets this beer apart from any other. It's a double IPA but it drinks like a standard IPA.

Appealing deep honey color with a massive white head. Impressive retention for a high-abv brew, very good lacing.  Aroma is brilliant and vibrant, full of citrus hops and apricot. Nice.  Flavor was pretty hot and hoppy. Sort of sweet and not incredibly bitter. Hop flavor seemed kind of nondescriptly tangy and incomplete. Mouthfeel was oily from the hops and creamy from the ample carbonation.  I feel like this beer gets a lot of its reputation from its warming character. The kick-- likely a result of the honey added during brewing-- is nice and smooth, but it doesn't do much for the flavors of this beer. Good stuff, if over-hyped. Didn't really slam me.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",Imperial IPA,98

S: Unbelievable aroma...citrus, pine, grapefruit, some malt...crazy good!!!!  T: Citric, malty, and a hidden sweetness that comes around the palate to round things off.  M: Full bodied, creamy and stingy on the front to middle palate, guessing due to the alcohol content.  D: Amazingly easy to drink considering the beer's strength.  Note: I accompanied this beer with a huge plate of German food and after 3 pints I was comatose!  Salud!",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",Imperial IPA,98

287,17112,kegger22,4.42,"Bell's HopSlam is a brilliant orange Imperial IPA with a moderate off white head than reduced to a collar.  As the name would imply, the aroma has a huge hop presence.  Citrus hops also dominate the taste buds, but the honey also make itself known with a moderating sweetness. There is a pine after taste.  The mouth feel is medium bodied with amply carbonation.  Drinkability is good for a 10.00 ABV. I want another right now. In fact, I think I will.  Maybe not quite up to the hype, but close enough and a very good beer. This bottle was from a sixer purchase almost two months ago and it has already mellowed. The fresh stuff was even more of a ""HopSlam"".",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",Imperial IPA,98
287,17112,ugaterrapin,4.49,"Poured into a pint glass. It has a pure clear golden color. About a finger of white head that leaves some excellent lacing on the sides of the glass. It has an incredible clean floral hop aroma with hints of citrus. One of the best noses I have encountered on a beer. The hops are definitely present on the front of the sip. They match the floral notes in the aroma. It is surprisingly smooth. I expected much more bitterness. This is probably the least bitter double IPA I have ever had. The hops are still there just not so abrupt. I am not sure if the honey is responsible for the subdued bitterness or not. The honey is noted in some sweetness at the tail end of the taste and probably adds to the oily mouthfeel along with the hops. This is very smooth and the alcohol is masked making the alcohol content seem to be in the 6%-7% range. Overall and excellent beer. One of the best DIPA I have experienced. Although an excellent beer, I was disappointed slightly. I think the hype raised my expectations too high.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",Imperial IPA,98
287,17112,zimm421,4.56,"A - Pours a dark, clear gold with a nice, thick head that dissipates slowly, leaving great lacing.  S - Very strong scents of pine, citrus and honey. The hops and honey mixed together make an incredible smell.  T - Follows the nose well with citrus, more specifically grapefruit, piney hops, and honey. The three work together incredibly. This starts out sweet and finishes with a very nice bitterness. The alcohol stands out in the taste too, but the rest is so rich that it blends very well.  M - There is a good amount of carbonation, but still feels creamy and very smooth. Again, the alcohol stands out but it fits in well.  D - Fairly easy to drink, but it is very thick making it slightly difficult to go for more than a few at a time.

287,17112,woosterbill,4.78,"12 oz bottle, batch 9470 (Dec. 23), into a Duvel tulip in a side-by-side tasting with Founders Double Trouble.  A: Clear, bright amber body sits placidly beneath an inch and a half of rich, creamy white head. Excellent retention and lots of nice, very sticky lace. Truly a paragon of DIPA looks.  S: Tons of citrus hop aroma swirls up from the tulip, engulfing me in ripe orange, bitter grapefruit, and some mild tropical fruit (mango?). No malt to be distinguished, just layer after layer of hoppy goodness. Perhaps not quite as intense and multifaceted as Pliny (the standard to which I now have to compare all DIPAs), but a truly excellent-smelling beer (and distinctly superior to DT).  T: Wow. On the palate, this is right up there with PtE. Creamy orange at first, then some subtle spiciness comes through along with the more intense bitterness of grapefruit pith. Just a bit of light malt sweetness balances things out momentarily, but is quickly subsumed in the richly bitter finish. This finish is immense both in flavor and duration, cycling through warm tropical fruit, bitter grapefruit, and finally a bit of alcohol warmth. Definitely not as bitter overall as the DT, and almost infinitely more complex. This is an amazing beer.  M: Silk. Smooth medium body with just the right amount of velvety effervescence to make this nectar flow with unparalleled ease.  D: While I'll be crying all too soon when my sixpack is gone, each individual bottle is so packed with flavor that it takes a while to ease through it - despite its name, this is definitely not a ""slammable"" beer. Certainly moreso than the DT, though.  Notes: This one lives up to the hype, and then some. The comparisons to Pliny are entirely just, although the beers are really on opposite ends of the DIPA spectrum - Hopslam is all about the bright, fruity, citrus side of hops, while Pliny balances that with a generous dose of dank piney goodness as well. I checked, and I've scored them identically (with the only difference being that Hopslam outscores Pliny on mouthfeel, and it's reversed for drinkability). I wish so much that this were a year-round release, and that it was distributed to CT. C'est la vie. I'll just have to have my buddy in Chicago ship me two sixers next year. Oh, and it kicked DT's ass, great as that beer is. Hopslam is amazing.  Cheers!",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",Imperial IPA,98
287,17112,boatshoes,4.2,"Picked on of these up for the first time recently on a trip down to Columbus. Excited as I absolutely loved the Oracle.  Appearance- Pours out of the bottle into my New Belgium snifter with a massive, rocky white head on top of a sparkling, deep golden-amber body. Lots of active carbonation in the body, great head retention, and a lot of thick lacing left as I drink. Quite a looker.  Smell- Wow, a whole lot of tropical fruit going on here. Great big notes of hoppy grapefruit, mango, and pineapple with mango being predominant. Really fruity on the nose without much pine or resin that I was expecting to pick up on.  Taste- Actually, not quite what I was expecting from the nose. I had heard this one was quite fruity on the palate and given the nose it was what I expected to be predominant. Although there remained notes of mango and pineapple in the taste profile, it was dominated more by bitter grapefruit and pine. Much more forward in the way of pine needles and resin rather than tropical hop flavors I felt, though this isn't meant in a negative way. In fact, I felt that The Oracle was much fruitier in the flavor profile. In addition there is a noticeable rich sweetness backing up the hops and making this much more balanced than I was expecting given the bitter hop punch.  Mouthfeel/Drinkability- Great rich mouthfeel on this beer and drinkability is quite good for the style despite the heavy bitterness and high abv.  Overall, an excellent DIPA. Interesting flavor profile that is held together quite well despite the level of hop bitterness. Thus far, this is my third favorite DIPA after The Oracle (1st) and Pliny the Elder (2nd). Well worth a try.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",Imperial IPA,98
287,17112,zac16125,4.74,"Appearance: B , pours a dark golden color with a 1/2 finger width white head that quicky disappaites to a film which stays for the remainder of the drink and leaves very slight lacing.  Smell: A+ , As soon as I opened the bottle I caught an amazing hoppy aroma, that intensified after the pour. If you've even handled fresh whole hops, that is what this beer smell like. Great aroma.  Taste: A , I expected an overhopped, overly bitter ale, but I was plesently surprised. This beer brought strong hop characters but has the malt characters that allowed it to maintain a great balance and a bitterness that was strong but not overwhelming. It also did a great job of hiding its high ABV, I was surprised when I looked it up and saw it is in the double digits. I've had hoppier IPAs, I've had more bitter IPAs but I may have never had a better IPA. This is really a gem of a beer.  Mouthfeel: A+ , Well bodied, but not too heavy with just the right amount of carbonation.  Drinkability: A+ , For its strong flavors and high ABV it was incredibley easy to drink and left me wanting another one as soon as I could get it.  Overall this beer was fantastic.

287,17112,weatherdog,4.37,"On tap at Brixies in Brookfield IL; served in a 10oz. snifter  A hazy bright amber/orange with a lingering white head. Heavy lacing down the snifters walls.  The nose is an absolute explosion of pineapple and some grapefruit. Its so juicy it's like there is pineapple juice in my glass.  There is a huge pineapple hop flavor. The bitterness is subdued and smooth maybe by the addition of the honey. I can't get over how much tropical fruit hop flavor this beer has, I've never tasted anything like it and it blows the bottled version out of the water. This is probably the best DIPA I've had. There is absolutely no hint of any alcohol flavor.  The honey addition really provides a silky smooth mouthfeel which kind of clashes with the high carbonation. I think a lower carbonation would compliment the smoothness and increase drinkability.

287,17112,OldSchoolGamer,4.12,"This is easily one of the highest rated and most raved about IPAs. This is the third year I have had Hopslam, and my reaction is always the same. Its good, but not great. Here is my review:  A: Pours a nice golden amber color. Pretty hazy. Head is rather minimal, but there is some nice, thick lacing present.  S/T: The aroma is very grapefruit dominant. Pretty sweet, and citric. Taste is very nice. Loads of grapefruit and pineapple upfront. Pretty sweet as well. Essentially a sweet grapefruit juice. The finish is bitter, sweet, bready, boozy, and has an almost musty earthyness. I wish there was more complexity in the hop flavoring, but whats wrong with a grapefruit hop bomb?  M/D: Mouthfeel is medium to full bodied. Slightly syrupy. Very crisp and slightly dry. Bitter finish with quite a bit of alcohol burn and prickly sensation. Drinkability is good. Very balanced and tasty, but 10% ABV is nothing to take lightly. Only one or two a night, tops.  After recently having Founders Double Trouble, I think this has more in common with Three Floyds Dreadnaught. Comparing the two, Dreadnaught is vastly superior. It is much more complex and is akin to having a tropical fruit hop explosion in your mouth. This is a little too heavy on grapefruit, and the bready malts come through a little more than you might expect. Very good IPA, just not worthy of the hype, or price.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",Imperial IPA,98
287,17112,Beejay,4.2,"Tis the season right?  A: Clear sweet golden amber. Beautiful full white head on top, which seems to be sticking around for a bit.  S: Hops. Major Grapefruit scent in there. As well as some grassy notes, quite sweet smelling as well. Almost a carmel scent in the end.  T: Not nearly as sweet as the smell would lead you to believe. Quite aggressive hop flavor, strong and earthy. There is a bit of the caramel flavor in the end as well as a bite from the considerable amount of booze in this thing. As this warms a little bit, some more of the sweetness comes out, which I like a lot.  M: Slick, and slightly oily on the tongue. Carbonation is nice, if just a little much.  D: Good for sure, but the hops are a little more aggressive than I would like. Then again, I am not a hop head. This is a new style that I am really starting to enjoy, and unfortunately this is not my favorite take on the style. For the price, and all the hype I think I would rather have a DFH 90Min.

The body is mild and mouth filling with a touch of malt sweetness to complement the big hop citrus flavors. Very fresh and fruity as well as very well balanced.

287,17112,OneDropSoup,4.64,"Poured into a shaker: a clear honey gold with a finger of creamy head. A few tiny, pilsner-like bubbles. Beautiful lacing, a lot more than I'd expect for 10% ABV.  Knock-out hop smell! Pineapple, lemon, grapefruit, pine, just a tiiiiny bit catty. Not slammin' me in the face, but definitely jumping out & saying hello. Not aggressive, but pleasant & forward.  Great citrus & pineapple flavors, but gripped by a woody/piney bitterness. And booze -- yeah, the booze is there in a big way. Ends dry & bitter on the back of the tongue, but there's a real nice residual sweetness at the sides of the mouth. Bitterness mellows after about a quarter glass, revealing that honey, but the booze is still there.  Mouthfeel is prickly at first, but also nice & foamy, evening out. Pretty full, & the alcohol leaves some heat. I can feel it in my nose.  This is better than I remember. One of the best hop smells out there, & the honey helps not just to make it a bitter-bomb (less & less appealing to me). The booze makes it a little formidable, & you can feel it, which is good because otherwise I could down one after another.

287,17112,Mavajo,4.83,"Had on tap.  This beer came to me sporting an orange/amber color with perfect clarity - pretty much identical to the bottle serving I'd previously enjoyed. Head seemed a bit more tenacious this time, with a bit more lacing. I give the tap appearance a clear nod over the bottle appearance.  Aroma and taste are pure joy - just like the bottle. The nose brings out the hops, citrus grapefruit, and estery with notes of grass and pine. I tried to figure out which I smelled more of (grass or pine), but it seemed like my perception vacillated with every sniff.  If the aroma seemed good, the taste will blow you away. This is, hands down, the best IPA/DIPA I've ever tasted. There's hops to be sure, but the bitterness is wonderfully balanced with a smooth sweetness. All the notes from the aroma again appear in the taste - hops, grapefruit, grass/pine. The hops are much fresher and dominant on tap, but the bitterness is still remarkably tame and balanced. Once again, I'm completely amazed that this brew weighs in at 10%.  The mouthfeel is par for the course - smooth, appropriate carbonation. Just as well crafted as the aroma and taste. It just dances around in your mouth like smooth velvet.  This brew was beer bliss when I had it for the first time from the bottle. It's even better on tap.

Smells of hops, tastes of hops, specifically a big dose of grapefruit with a tangy aftertaste. Excellent IPA flavor, but a bit light on the mouthfeel for a DIPA.

287,17112,superdedooperboy,4.26,"Poured from a 12 oz. bottle into a tulip glass. Served at cellar temperature, 45 degrees F.  Pours a beautiful deep golden hue with spectacular clarity. There's a faint haziness to it, but otherwise it's almost suggestive of lagering. Issues a giant billowing off-white head that falls away at a bit of a trot, showing nice retention and sticking in big, fat clumpy rings to the sides of the glass.  The nose is a big, bright, fresh burst of Cascade hop notes. Evidence of dry-hopping for sure. Bold and citrusy, lightly floral and juicy. Very fragrant and very inviting.  Surprisingly lighter in body than anticipated of a 10% ABV double IPA. Medium-bodied and middling in carbonation, somewhat slick and very dry in the finish. A base of sweet, honeyish malt is somewhat detectable, underpinning a huge burst of hop notes, ranging from grapefruit to orange to apple to lemon to a touch of grass. Mostly citrusy, and with a middle that is bracingly bitter and carries over into the finish, imparting the heavy dryness that begs for another quaff. Some notes of grapefruit and honey linger. As it warms, a little bit of warming alcohol can be detected on the way down.  This is one heck of a drinkable double IPA. It is powerful, for sure, but it drinks like a nice West Coast-style IPA. At temperatures below 45 degrees, this would undoubtedly be a dangerous fellow. A few of these could go down easily, and put you down with just as much ease.

Glorious aromas of hops on top of hops on top of hops: fresh cut grapefruit, orange marmalade, lime zest, and earthy pine resin. Light toasted malt lingers in the background, but this is definitely a hop lover's beer.  Maltier on the palate than expected, with the toasted and lightly bready note out front alongside a touch of caramel sweetness. But not to be cast aside, the hops quickly butt in and steal the show. Bittersweet orange zest and pith, oily resin, and a mildly pungent peppery spiciness abound. Fades into a sweet but earthy honey flavor, toasted almonds, and bitter pine needles, with a lingering finish that just keeps going, evolving all the way. In a word, dynamic.

The combination of honey and hop aroma smacks me in the face from the second I open the bottle, like if one of those plastic bears from the grocery store came to life, climbed a pine tree, walked through a field of wildflowers, and then started mauling my sinuses with his sticky, sweet, sap-covered paws. Although the aroma is packed with both the honey sweetness and the piney and floral hops, the flavor is much more hop-forward, showcasing the resinous pine and a bit of orange, and with the honey providing a sweet balance. And the flavor and aroma from the honey is wonderfully natural, rather than an artificial, syrupy sweetness. The potency of the flavors deftly masks the 10% alcohol, and although the label claims that this is ""a biting, bitter, tongue bruiser"", this one is remarkably drinkable.

A: pours a nice orange or golden yellow into a tulip glass. S: big citrus flavors. Orange and grapefruit, big hops throughout with just a little bit of that green 'piney' flavor that makes Pliny the king. T: hops carry through from the smell, but with a little bit of sweetness. Okay, the sweetness continues maybe a little too much and then dies off right at the end to a fairly bitter finish. High alcohol is hidden nicely - maybe too nicely. M: the mouth feel is a little sticky-sweet for me. A little heavy on the tongue, this beer falls down a notch here. D: this is a strong contender in the DIPA category and a very enjoyable beer.

287,17112,BrewIndy,5,"This may be my first perfect rating. I'm not sure :)  Appearance: This is one beautiful beer! Crystal clear, orange coloring. Almost like the color of honey this beer is brewed with if it was clear. Has a small amount of head on toop and leaves some great lacing. If only all beers could look like this. A piece of art really.  Smell: Piney, and citrusy hops right up front. Perhaps it's because it says it on the bottle but I can also smell the honey leaving a pleasurable sticky feeling in the old nostrils.  Taste: Bam! This one is definitely hoppy! At least up front. The great thing about this though is it is very balanced. Someone that would say they don't normally like hoppy beers should at least pick up a single of Hopslam because it is great. The malt and honeys sweeten this beer up nicely leaving the finish to be more sticky sweet than bitter like you get with most hoppy beers. Of course with an ABV of 10% you'd expect it to be sweet. This beer is pretty complex too. Throughout the glass I got different tastes and flavors between being super bitter to being super sweet and everything in between.  Mouthfeel: Smooth and sticky! Up front this beer makes your mouth feel refreshed with the bitter hops cleaning (or stripping away) your palate and then it leaves you with the sticky sweet feeling.  Drinkability: Who cares about the 10% ABV?! I say the drinkability on Bell's Hopslam is way better than par. In other words, this is one you can sit and sip and enjoy all night long.

WAY too drinakble for a beer of this strength! This is lethal. I really have to focus and sip this one.  (This tastes what a barelywine version of Troegs Nugget nectar should taste like. I mean flying Mouflan was okay but this raped my face.)  Drink it as soon as its released. It starts to change after a month!!! (i've experimented).",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",Imperial IPA,98
287,17112,schanker21,4.55,"A- Very slightly hazy orange with a decent white head. It's actually pretty clear for an IPA, almost lager-like in appearance. Head remains throughout the glass with lots of lacing.  S- Citrusy, piney, IPA-like. Smells inviting and strong, strong, strong.  T- Citrus is the first taste to hit the palette. Well-balance by the malts with a late bit of alcohol on the aftertaste. After a couple more sips pine tastes are noticeable, typical IPA tastes, but with the quality you would expect from Bell's.  M- Quite delightful. Perfect amount of carbonation. Crisp, refreshing. Don't know that I've had another IPA with such a great mouthfeel.  D- Very drinkable.  Wow, another great beer from Bell's. I've yet to have anything from them that disappoints. As a midwesterner, I don't know of another brewery that comes close to their overall consistently great beers (maybe Founder's). I was lucky to grab the last six pack of this at the liquor store I frequent and I hope to find it again.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",Imperial IPA,98
287,17112,GJ40,4.62,"Sampled on tap at Tyler's in Apex.  This beer starts great with a nice light golden color, great clarity and a sturdy white head. The aroma is fantastic with lots of citrus and tropical fruit. The flavor is all about the hops with loads of grapefruit, pineapple and mango. The malt backs it up well enough and the alcohol sneaks in and out of the picture.  This is one beer that always sneaks up on me. It's so flavorful and appealing I tend to forget the punch it packs.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",Imperial IPA,98
287,17112,alpinebryant,4.23,"Pours a marigold orange yellow with a large white head of tiny bubbles. Smell is tons of grapefruit, and abundance of pine, pineapple and citrus. There is so much IBU aroma that it smells dankish and similar to the sticky icky. Some may even venture to say that there is some barnyard aroma because of the huge hop presence.  Taste is very good - there is largely a huge pineapple flavor with a large pine presence and a decent malt body . I never would have known it was a 10% abv had I not seen it in the description, and based on that, I had to give it a pretty decent drinkability score. Good brew, not surprising this has a huge following and it is readily available / able to sell out.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",Imperial IPA,98
287,17112,firkinhophead,4.03,"Had this on cask last year at BSP, then on tap last week in VA. Now for a bottle in the relative quiet of home for a review.  Pours crystal clear and honey gold into a tulip glass. Tight off-white head that dissipates to a ring of spittly foam that leaves a spotty lace. Slowly rising bubbles in the center indicate the gravity (so to speak) of the contents. Beautiful.  Nose is mostly citrus with some floral notes and a bit of sugary bubble gum. Not particularly dank like its west coast breathren, but potent nonetheless. Not really picking up any alcohol, which is remarkable.  Juicy Fruit, grapefruit, pine, and mint on the tongue, with a powdery astringency. Alcohol warmth infuses the modest cereal grains for the only hint of malt. ints of honey, tart apple, pear, and white wine add some dimension beyond the hops, as well.  Surprising light body with a slick mouthfeel yields to a dry finish. Grapefruit rind bitterness lingers well after the last drop. Flush of carbonation in the swallow leaves the mouth clean and ready for another sip. Nicely put together.  After all the hype, HopSlam measures up well, although not a grand slam for me. A bit too astringent and lacking in malt character, although I realize that's what it's all about. Occasionally suggests toothpaste, which is refreshing, but not exactly something I want to sip on.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",Imperial IPA,98

287,17112,cavedave,4.52,"Thanks to kzoobrew who knew I would love this, and made it possible.  A thin white head gives way to persistent ring and islands atop a golden beauty of a brew. It is cloudy with fine yeast, and has that shimmery look of a thick beer. A gentle swirl leaves thick slabs and arms of lace. One of the better looking DIPA's I've seen, for sure.  The nose is a medium to full aroma of bright citrus essence (grapefruit, orange peel), floral notes, light bready sweetness, hints of earthy bitter. The balanced brightness in the aroma is outstanding. No trace of alcohol in this baby's bouquet. Most excellent and tempting.  WowwwwW this is delicious. Very full flavored. It starts with a cannonade of citrus and bitter, some resinous and delicious piney notes quickly join the assault. Hints of neutral grainy sweetness guard the flanks of the sip as it presses on to a finish of exceptionally clean flavors of grapefruit rind, earth, very light herbal florality, and that fleeting sweet touch. It's a ghost of sweet in the sip, really, keeping it from exploding on itself. The bright, clean flavors, the balance, and the very light alcohol presence (10%ABV seems impossible) make this a fantastic beer, a work of art.  I may have had finer DIPA's in every other category, but I'm not sure I've had one with better mouthfeel, drinks very light. This is a full bodied beer, no mistake, but it is creamy despite having a dry, long finish. Low carb., perfect. Viscous, but none of the cloying or medicine of some in this category. No, Hopslam gets a cleaner, and brighter, and longer finish as it warms. Flavors sparkle in the spotlight of this mouthfeel.  Drinkability is red flag warning dangerous. If I had two cases of this, instead of these few bottles, prudence would lead me to download emergency alcohol overdose info.  Impression: Lotta hype, this one walks the walk. If you are a lover of this style, do what it takes, get some of this.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",Imperial IPA,98
287,17112,SpdKilz,4.47,"New Beer Friday! A huge thanks goes out to kzoobrew for this awesome beer! Cheers friend!  Appearance - Pours a tangerine color into my SA Perfect Pint with about an inch of fluffy, billowy head that slowly recedes to a thin layer, leaving beautiful lacing on the sides of the glass.  Smell - Tropical fruits, ripe grapefruit, pineapple, passion fruit. After the immediate burst of citrus a light but noticeable piney/hoppy smell drifts up toward me. The more I let this sit and warm up, the more robust the smells become. My mouth is literally watering waiting to taste this beer.  Taste - An immediate burst of citrus flavors, tasting similar to the nose. These flavors dissipate more quickly than I would have thought given the smell, and is followed by a huge hit of piney, hoppy goodness. All the while when these flavors are interacting, there is a sweet, malty backbone which is prominent with honey. I doubted that the honey would bode well with this beer, but my god, it is so amazing. I am sitting here typing, not having taken a sip for about thirty seconds and I can still taste the honey. The taste is so utterly balanced. The citrus, bitter, malty, honey...all come together to create a very elegant, complex DIPA.  Mouthfeel - Medium mouthfeel, decently carbonated, and very creamy. Leaves you with a nice ""clean"" finish after each sip unlike some other DIPAs.  Drinkability - Let's just say that it is a good thing these are not available around me. If I had this, The Oracle, and Pliny the Elder all available all the time by me, I would probably never drink anything different. All three are very different in my opinion, yet all three represent the style extremely well. Hopslam is a very balanced beer. I would say The Oracle is a bit of a sweeter DIPA, Hopslam well balanced, and PtE a bit on the bitter side. I feel like I could have one or two of either The Oracle or PtE and then perhaps move on to something else because the style was a bit too sweet or bitter. But with Hopslam, with the nice notes of citrus and pine/hops then balanced by a slight malty backbone which finishes up with a taste of honey...I could session these until I passed out. Better than I was expecting and I fear from now on I will have to bug kzoobrew every year to send me out a few of these!",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",Imperial IPA,98
287,17112,Heavenisbeer,4.7,"Poured into a pint glass.  A: Backlit glowing honey. You could light your house with this beer. Robust, full, and tempting. Extremely heady off the pour, possibly four fingers, gradually fading gently to a two cm cloudy pillow of a head. Sporadic tendril legs. The carbonation is mean, and appears to be anticipating a near-future bite. I'm ready.  S: From whence to commence. Hyperbole required. Just overflowing with pungent brilliance. A bouquet of hops and Great Plain flowers and citrus and hops and tropical fruits and corner store candy and hops. ""Honey, you are there too."" The nose kicks, even after the head is chopped off, continuing until the last drop, and sticks to the glass in one last dash effort to render you eternally conscious of its previous divine glory. Just wonderfully well balanced.  T: Suppose you dropped a tray loaded with jugs of fresh squeezed lemonade, orange and grapefruit juices, in a dank pine forest with a fresh covering of needles underfoot, but were then chased by a bear who had very recently dipped his paws in a honeycomb, and in the process of chasing you had dripped the honey upon the citrus-y spill. Now, throw some alcohol onto the puddle of now trampled citrus pine. And now lick it. Okay, it's a lot better than that. I really appreciate that the hops constantly punch, but are restrained enough as to not create an overabundance of bitterness. Very tasty IPA indeed.  M: I truly cannot see how it could get much better--not too heavy, not too syrupy, not too bubbly, not too oily, not too feathery, not too anything...But everything that you'd ever expect from an IPA.  D: Man oh man. In terms of the mouthfeel and the taste, this beer is extremely drinkable. Yet, the alcohol (10% abv) is skillfully inconspicuous. After two I am filling toasty, and I have a hefty tolerance. Drinking six is easy, but don't stand up too quickly. Be careful, this one's a creeper.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",Imperial IPA,98

287,17112,timski346,3.92,"Excellent DIPA. First sips are a bit harsh, but flavor smooths out as the beer warms. You would never guess that this is a 10% ABV beer. The balance of hops/malt/alcohol is very good at hiding the alcohol taste. Simcoe hop profile as predominat hop is very apparent to me. Overall great beer!  (A) Appearance - Orangish with white head that is not very thick and is not retained very long.  (S) Smell - Citrus/fruity with Simcoe hop aroma.  (T) Taste - Predominantly hoppy, but not overpowering, although hop profile is probably more complex than it taste. Background malt character absent of strong alcohol tatse that you would expect from a 10% beer.  (M) Mouthfeel - Moderate carbonation. Just right for this beer.

287,17112,Daniellobo,4.32,"A very nice, if slightly overhyped, DIPA  Presentation: 12 oz bottle. Simple and somewhat cartoonish front label design with the illustration of a person literally slammed under hops over a green color palette. Back label includes a minimal, and rhetorical narrative, and cellaring ability. Shows bell batch number (9471, which as per their website is bottled on December 21, 2009). Notes Alc. by Vol. (10%) Served into a tulip glass.  A - Deep amber pour with a good head, medium retention, and some lacing with a nice surface memory.  S - Very rich and complex hoppy nose. Citrus, grapefruit, resin, pineapple... But scent of good ripe melon emerges too. Might be the hops coated with the honey, but can´t help to get out of certain type of ripe toad type melon.  T - Taste follows the nose with rich hoppy sweetness, grapefruit, pine, pineapple but above all a final lingering touch of... melon. No honey as such but this melon thing feels like the honey touching the hops. A bit weird but very nice.  M - ""Tongue bruiser"" like the label suggest this isn't by far, at least not on this incarnation. Medium body, even medium to light at times, but working pretty well with a rather smooth, even creamy feel, and a small finishing bite.  D - Works very well, the alcohol is very well integrated and barely noticeable. In fact rather given the ABV one may need to be reminded of it. Overall a very pleasing one.  Notes: It's not half as assertive or spectacular as the hype would have one believe. But it is a pretty tasty and delicate hoppy brew nevertheless. And even if a tad overpriced, it is rather nice to have around, and remains very recommendable.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",Imperial IPA,98

Smell is light and citrusy, all hops in the nose, not really an assault but very pleasing.  Flavor starts out with citrus bitterness and some balancing malt flavor, again not quite the hop assault I was expecting, very well balanced the hop flavors fill your mouth and there is a little backend bitterness that leaves a tingle on the tongue.

287,17112,vishneda,4.43,12 oz bottle into an oversized wine glass.  This was the first DIPA for me and I was very impressed with it. Great balance. There is a distinct fruitiness found in the combination of the malt backbone and the high hop use. Bell's really focused on bringing the flavor of the hop out... not just hitting high IBUs. Scary drinkability for a 10% beer.  I've got a few other DIPAs to explore and I may come back and revise the ratings based on my experiences with this style.,Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",Imperial IPA,98

It finishes clean and refreshing.  M-Seemed very syrupy with a touch of carbonation. It was like drinking heaven's nectar.  D-Through the roof, I don't care if it is 10% I could drink this all day.  Overall, I was glad I got to try this on tap, it was delicious. I think its more syrupy and not as full bodied as it is out of the bottle giving it a slight edge in drinkability.

287,17112,icetraxx,4.21,"A: Looks like Two Hearted in both a mug and oversized wine glass, this means this beer needs a bit more lacing and head retention as it is fairly poor compared to other examples of the D/IPA style.  S: Smells like liquid hops (pineapple + grapefruit + piney resin + lemon citrus), as well as a hint of alcohol. The aroma builds quite nicely in my oversized wine glass, it is aromatic like a hop air-freshner.  T: Tastes like Two Hearted on steroids, though quite a bit less balanced. Surprisingly there is no taste of alcohol. There is a hint of malt on the crisp finish, otherwise it's all hops, all the time. The hop flavor follows the smell (though grapefruit is dominate). A great example of the style, as DIPAs are inherently unbalanced as far as I know (I prefer regular balanced IPAs like Two Hearted). Complexity only consists of different hop flavors, but there is a dynamic bitterness to the hops that is very interesting.  M: I felt this was less creamy and a bit thinner than Two Hearted, which is a shame. Perfectly carbonated.  D: With 10% alcohol and hops that kick you in the pants, this is definitely a slow sipper. I wouldn't drink as many of these as a Two Hearted, but I could drink a second one.  O: As an experiment, I fed HopSlam to my friend that normally *doesn't drink any kind of beer*. As I expected, the intensity of the hop bitterness of HopSlam gave a priceless facial expression. My recommendations for this brew are simple: if DIPAs are your thing, you need to pick up some HopSlam NOW. If you dislike DIPAs, don't pick up HopSlam.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",Imperial IPA,98
287,17112,glid02,4.62,"On-tap at the Porter Beer Bar in Atlanta.  Pours a clear light copper color with a two-finger slightly off-white head. The head recedes into a patchy layer on top leaving thick lacing.  Smells of bright tropical fruit first and foremost, with good amounts of citrus and lighter amounts of adjunct sweetness from the honey.  Tastes similar to how it smells. Pale malt flavors up front are overtaken almost immediately by loads of tropical fruit and citrus flavors. The honey doesn't really stand out as a flavor, instead adding a bit of sweetness and lightening up the bitterness. The ending is mildly bitter and a bit of residual sweetness if left lingering on the palate.  Mouthfeel is very good. It's got a solid thickness with smooth carbonation.  Drinkability is very good. I finished my glass quickly and could have another.  Overall I didn't think Hopslam lost a step over last year's. The honey adds a bit more body however the sweetness detracts from the drinkability by just a tad.

287,17112,mdwalsh,4,"A: Dark golden, no active carbonation. Poured a razor thin head that vanished pretty quickly.  S: Hops, obivously. A little citrusy, perhaps grapefruity? The complexity is very nice. Compared to Bell's Amber, which I thought was over hopped, this is very nice in terms of hop flavor and aroma.  T: Not as strong as I was expecting (perhaps I just braced myself too much). Hops dominate the flavor, I can taste it on every part of my tongue. I get a little honey in the aftertaste  M: Biting at first, but smooth. Slightly creamy even.  D: Not bad, I will most likely finish the 6er in my fridge, but overall not that impressed.  Redo: January 26, 2010.  A: Big off white head on a golden body, lots of active carbonation. Very clean and clear. Great Lacing.  S: A complex blend of hops but the malt/honey come through as well. No smell of alcohol at all. I think though there is too much going on in the smell though and it's all just shouting at me. I get a little grassy-ness, some pine, maybe a citrus-zest smell, but not a clean citrus like I would from a Centennial hoped beer.  T: There's a lot of flavor in here, even in the foam of the head there's as much flavor as some macro beers I've tasted. But is it all that great? Hopslam is one of those beers that just has so much going on that you remember it, and fondly, and fondness grows over the year. Again, like the smell, there's a lot going on. I get some grain here, which wasn't in the nose, but still a ton of different hop-related flavors. Maybe a little fruitiness. It's a biting bitterness all over, but a very mild bite. It's just too full.  M: Very full bodied and creamy, just as I remembered it. Creamy enough (and sweet enough) in fact to outweigh the bitterness that you get in a regular IPA that makes it taste lighter than it is.  D: Again, drinkable, not something I would pass up, but not something I'm going to get as excited about in the future.

Holy cow the hops on this beer! Almost overwhelmingly aromatic. My wife could smell it all the way in the next room! Bursting with a bright citrus pop, the smell is incredibly bright and cheery, like wind blowing over an orange tree. The carbonation is perfectly balanced, mixing well with the bright, white grapefruit taste that seems to almost float in your mouth. The finish has a slight bitterness to it not unlike that of citrus zest. Though this beer is INCREDIBLY drinkable, watch out because the 10% ABV will knock you on your ass if you're not careful. This would be a perfect beer to enjoy on your deck in the summertime, and it may very well be my favorite offering from Bell's at this point.

Hops dominate the nose...it is like sticking you face into a christmas tree decorated with citrus fruits. I can also smell something almost tropical in the background...papayas perhaps? Making my mouth water...  Waves of flavors wash over your palate. First you get a sweet, honey character. This is followed by a citrus-hop pop. The finish is a little more on the piney side.

The smell was a seductive mix of grapefruit, pine resin, and herbs. The taste was very citric and juicy to the core, almost hard candy like in its sweetness until smacking you down with a spicy hop finish. I also detected a touch of mint in the taste and faint notes of vanilla. The bitterness was quite low, but otherwise hops drove the show.

Pours a golden honey-orange with a frothy white head. Tipping back the tulip glass leaves some nice lacing.  Wow, lots of sticky, piney, grapefruit-laden hops on top of a sweet malt base. This beer smells exceptionally good.  The flavor again has a huge does of bitter, piney hops, but its so smooth at the same time. Nice, chewy, sweet malts mix with juicy grapefruit flavors in this delicious honey-like nectar. This is what a DIPA should be.  Mouthfeel is somewhat sticky and resiny at first, but then finishes super smooth. It doesn't get much better than this.  Drinkability is very good. I could easily have more than one of these, even with the 10% ABV; which is essentially unnoticeable to the taste buds. I really need to pick up more.  Overall, this is the first brew I've had from Bell's and it is phenomenal. Without a doubt, the best DIPA I have ever had. Sticky, hoppy, citrusy with a very smooth body.

I love this combination.  MmmmMmm! Tastes bitter and acacia honey sweet and a little bready. Great citrus rind character without being overwhelming. Light malty aftertaste. Light body. Carbonation is piercy-tingling and mouthfilling at first, giving way to smooth, silky body. This has got to be one of the most drinkable Imperial IPAs I've ever had. It goes down so easy.

Appears like many other DIPAs but the smell is exceptional, smells like a cross between grapefruit and pine resin, if grapefruit grew on a resinous tree this is what the resin would smell like. (Upon re-reading the last sentence it seems weird that that would be appealing, but then I was thinking of the possibilities of grapefruit wood aged beers...anyway, moving on).  Taste is a bit bitter citrus hoppy (but hardly the tongue bruiser the back of the bottle warns me about), a little sweet, and ever so slightly boozy.  Mouthfeel is about where I'd like it for a DIPA, a little creamy, and leaves my tongue slightly parched, yet not overwhelming.  Overall an excellent DIPA, my new favorite of the style. Drinkability ranks pretty high for DIPAs in my opinion, as I will crack another b/c it's delicious, but the 10% ABV is gonna stop me after a second.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",Imperial IPA,98

I could drink a few of these in a sitting and be just fine, although I'd imagine my palate might get a little burnt after that",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",Imperial IPA,98
287,17112,ktrillionaire,4.63,"The legendary Hopslam. It is all its cracked up to be. As good as the style gets.  A - Pours the clearest, glassiest golden color, with a big head that subsides into some serious lacing.  S - A vague harbinger of the hoppiness to ensue; less intense than the flavor. Orangey-citric hop, not a huge nose  T - The taste is astounding. The hops taste so fresh and vibrant; initial impressions of bitter grapefruit rind which segues into piney and cedar, dank and resiny earthy finish  M - Medium-bodied and light enough to be refreshing; sharp carbonation enhances and highlights the bitter hop profile.  D - There is a reason this beer inspires shelf-clearing lunacy.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",Imperial IPA,98

It's pure liquid gold -- only way to describe this beautiful beer. Fluffy head along the rim with concentrated lacing  S: a rounded musk that's softenedd by this odd sulfur-like quality that reminds me a bit of hard-boiled egg yolk -- in the best possible way!  T: definitely hoppy, but toned down by the honey  M: INCREDIBLE how the hop heaviness just lifts off your tongue and finishes so cleanly  D: I could have this all day -- or until I fall over  Had this side by side with Pliny the Elder.

287,17112,AdamBsweetwater,3.82,"A: Slightly orange color and very clear with just a slight haze which indicates unfiltered beer. An aggressive pour didn't make more than a one finger head with large bubbles which dissipates fairly quickly.  S: Melon and pineapple with a serious pungency. Definitely lots of Simcoe in there and I get Columbus as well. After a while I also noticed some lime zest and cattiness.  T: A dramatic cascade of flavor has been developed in this beer. The brightest hop flavors sing simultaneously with the darkest, most pungent, brooding lows. A cantaloupe and lemon/grapefruit punch is juxtaposed to an intense hoppiness with a slight onion edge. The alcohol is front and center especially as the beer warms up. It tastes a bit woody and is strong enough to have a numbing effect on the tongue. I think the beer could have been more appealing at 8%. I'd loose the adjunct if it were me.  M: The texture is appropriate for the style. Very light for a 10% abv beer but generally medium bodied. Carbonation is restrained.  D: Big knock here for the overabundance of booze. I know its a DIPA but there was no effort taken to mask the harsh alcohol heat. Its too unapologetic and obviously at this level drinkability suffers.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",Imperial IPA,98
287,17112,Kaiser81,4.3,"Generously given to me by Hayesez for no other reason then he loves sharing good beer.  2010 release poured from a 12 oz bottle into a pint glass.  A - Pours a hazy golden (almost lite copper) color) with two fingers worth of soft cream colored head. There are tons of visible carbonation bubbles. Lots of lacing is left on my glass.  S - Floral and grassy notes at first (with just a touch of pine) balanced by a lot of sweetness on the back end. Once it opens up, there are lots of fruits; oranges and tropical tend to come out mostly.  T - Earthy and pine notes are present with a bit of malt on the back end. Kind of a boozy aftertaste. It's tasty.  M - Light to medium body with plenty of carbonation. Very nicely done on the style.  D - The boozy aftertaste is the major thing that brings this score down, but I could drink a few of these, and then take a nap. It is a pretty good brew. Not quite to Sculpin or Pliny the Elder levels, but it's the closest I've seen for any midwest or east coast based DIPAs.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",Imperial IPA,98
287,17112,portia99,4.52,"12oz bottle received in trade with SirSketch...Thanks Zach! Batch 9470 - about 3-4 weeks since bottling. Poured into a Bruery tulip.  A - Pours a beautifully clear, amber gold color with a cap of dense off-white foam, about 1 finger high. Good retention, holding for a minute, eventually falling to a thin layer with a nice, thick collar.  S - Tons of fruity citrus in there. Bright and citrusy. Tons of fresh oranges, some tropical fruits, a touch of grapefruit and a some on the fringes. Not much for malt in the aroma. Great smelling beer.  T - As expected, lots of fruity hop flavors. More grapefruity in the flavor than the aroma. Still a good amount of orange and tropical fruits. Not much in the way of pine flavors. A distinct honey sweetness is everywhere in the flavor...doesn't overpower the hops, but adds a nice twist to the usual DIPA. Definitely a bitter beer, but again, it isn't really an all out assault on the taste buds...really pretty well ""balanced""...hard to say as this is such a hoppy beer, but the hops just stand out above everything else, but also have a way of blending to create an overall appeal.  M - Very light in body for a beer this high in alcohol...actually seems to be close to watery in feel. Carbonation is medium...seems just right for this beer. Bitterness from the hops leaves a little bit of a tingly feeling behind after the swallow.  D - Every time I drink this beer, I think...""there is no way this is a 10% beer""...and I still say that. This is just such a full flavored, citrusy, hoppy beer - and combined with the thin body, just goes down so fast and easy. Feels like a regular IPA...never had many of these back to back, or I might change my opinion, but this just might be the easiest drinking high alcohol beer I've ever had.

Incredibly fragrant aromas of citrus fruit, pine and fresh grass, balanced by a bready sweetness.  Nearly perfect blend of flavors- an incredible hop character with grapefruit and pine. Malt is evident in background alongside a nice sweetness from the honey that helps balance perfectly. Aftertaste is of pleasant lingering citrus.  Perfectly creamy body with appropriate carbonation.  Only the ABV takes away from the drinkability of this delicious brew.

Poured a nice golden honey color into the glass with a nice white two finger head that slowly dissipated leaving lacing all the way down the glass.The nose is citrus, hoppy and honey. There is a faint smell in the nose that is a little reminiscent of cheese. The taste is solid. Delicious citrus hops that open up more with each sip. Hints of honey, grapefruit, pine and hop resin come through early. There's a bit of bite in the initial taste that is smoothed over by honey in the finish. The beer rolls over your tongue and kind of coats your mouth. The honey really balances this out and keeps the hops in check, making it very, very drinkable. I wish they made this year round, this would be the perfect beer to have on hand in your fridge at all times.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",Imperial IPA,98
287,17112,CrestwoodG,4.95,"This is HopSlam's first appearance in Alabama. I picked up a 6-pack yesterday, but rushed out today and find more. My first tastes of this beer were yesterday. My review reflects a second taste.  Appearance: Beautiful golden-orange color. Very clear. You can almost read a newspaper through it. Not much head on this pour.  Smell: Unbelievable! You just want to dive right into this beer. I have a gardenia bush in my front yard, and this smells just like the flowers in the spring. Hints of orange/citrus.  Taste: Such a smooth first impression. Definitely taste the fruity hops. Dry of course on the palette. Definitely taste the honey. Barely a hint of alcohol. Some are speculating this batch is over 10%. If so, you'd never know it. Seems very fresh.  Mouthful: Again, very smooth. Fruity hop taste turns delightfully bitter. Not much of an aftertaste that I find with SW IPA. Similar to Mojo Risin in my opinion, but smoother and better. So tasty!  Drinkability: I could drink gallons of this stuff! Wonderful aftertaste that lingers with honey and citrus. Again, very smooth.  This is one of the top 5 deers I've ever tasted. It's absolutely delicious! Similar smell and first taste to SW IPA, but better. Smoother than any other DIPA I've tried, save 90-minute. My first taste was yesterday, and I rushed out today to pick up some more. Although you can't taste the alcohol, it's definitely potent. I can believe the claims of 10%+. But, it's so delicious! Didn't try it with food (yet), but I'm sure it would be great with spicy wings, BBQ or a good burger.  All-in-all, it's fantastic. I wish Bell's offered it year-round. But, at $18+/6-pack, I doubt I could drink it every weekend. There are lots of great beers available in Alabama now, but this one is exceptional.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",Imperial IPA,98
287,17112,ocelot2500,4.85,"Pours a clear golden orange color with a small white head that leaves enough lacing.  Smells of pure hops. Citrus and pine notes abound.  Tastes of a very big dose of hops. Again, citrus hops dominate with a pine resin note underneath. Some pale malt sweetness backs everything up. Alcohol is hidden very well.  Mouthfeel is medium full and smooth with a crisp finish.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",Imperial IPA,98
287,17112,mmva321,4.57,"Poured into a tulip.  It looks like liquid amber or nectar. That's a good sign. It pours a beautifully smooth golden/yeloow color. It's gloriously carbonated and takes on a reddish tint once in the glass. I usually hate carbonation, both in appearance and feel, but the light, bubbly look is terrific here. Couple fingers of frothy head with good retention and some nice lacing.  The smell is so potent that it travels a little, but it isn't overbearing or offensive at all. There's a very great balance of grapefruit and pine with a little citrus. Simple but so well refined.  You would expect a beer named 'Hopslam' to be brutally bitter, and this beer is, but it is also subdued enough to make it delicious and pleasurable. The grapefruit is also very apparent. The taste is very consistent, very strong and very well refined.  A little watery, but I say that about almost every beer without the consistency of motor oil, so maybe this is perfect. Still, the lightness of the drink is complimented by the carbonation very well.  The drinkability is terrific. Especially when considered how strong the hops are, it's impressive that the beer is such a pleasurable experience and in no way a laboring one.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",Imperial IPA,98

Smell: Smells like Grapefruit and Biscuit malt.  Taste. Tastes like a Bell's Two Hearted Ale (best ever) and grapefruit)  Mouthfeel: Very clean and not very thick. Very silky.  Drink-ability: So drinkable. Too drinkable actually. You will have a hard time stopping even though it is 10% abv.  Notes: Tastes like Bell's Two Hearted Ale with the bitterness and aroma of grapefruit added. Love it.,Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",Imperial IPA,98
287,17112,pasdachuri,3.77,"Pours a golden yellow, slightly cloudy, an holding a solid head.  Citrus and Pine....Just Citrus and Pine.  Not as hoppy (at first) as anticipated. Smooth honey upfront but gives way to a strong hops after taste. Strong hops lingers for awhile and is a bit too strong for my opinion, but what else should I expect with a name like Hopslam.  A nice balance of smooth, silky texture with just enough carbonation.  If this beer is 10%ABV I can't tell. If you enjoy this style drink with caution.  Very nicely done for the style, just not one that appeals to me. I've heard hops is an acquired taste, and if so, this one would take a decade to get used to.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",Imperial IPA,98
287,17112,teovaldi,4.77,"On-tap at CK Diggs, served in a 10 oz snifter.  Apperance is a golden straw yellow that is very clear with little carbination. Not much of a head on this one, probably attributed to the pour by the tender as I have got quite a head from all bottles of Hopslam I've tried.  The smell is like citrus heaven. I really expected to be able to notice the 10% in the nose but this wasn't the case at all. I probably stuck my nose in the glass at least 5 times before I even took my first sip.  The taste is very citrusy and piney. The finish is quite smooth from the malts with a nice slight honey end. I only wish that this beer was a bit more unbalanced and the hops came through more, hence the 4.5  Even the slightest of sips and this monster is coating and walloping every taste bud on your tongue. Definitely full bodied with just the right amount of carbonation. The finish is quite long but also very gentle and ends with just a hint of honey that brings you back for more.  Overall on tap I could keep drinkin em as long as they would keep servin em. Hopslam is great in the bottle but it opens up so much more on tap and anyone who can get a chance to try it most definitely should.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",Imperial IPA,98
287,17112,djbreezy,4.62,"Appearance - Pours a nice golden color with tiny beautiful carbonated bubbles. Some medium to light lacing that looks excellent on the glass.  Smell - If you haven't smelled this beer and you love an IPA, you absolutely need to. Has a very fresh and hoppy smell. Some of the honey comes through at times in its sweetness.  Taste - The beer tastes like hops with a hint of honey that laces the palate. The taste punches a bit then lingers with a bit of acidity that fades. What I could only describe as ""what one looks for in an IPA.""  Mouthfeel - The mouthfeel has a medium thickness to it with a bit of carbonation that almost bubbles lightly in the mouth and on the tongue.  Drinkability - Not a session beer, but definitely an amazing beer to sit down and enjoy slowly. It has a unique taste profile with great hop complexity.  Living on the west coast, I don't have regular access to this. However, I have a kind buddy (squaremile) who picks me up a bottle or two during his travels over to the great lakes.

287,17112,mondegreen,4.59,"12oz. Bottle poured into a DFH Signature Glass.  A: Wonderful golden color with a very small head. Leaves a decent amount of lace.  S: The smell is what makes this beer. The most crisp, clean hop aroma I have ever experienced. I pick up a light sweetness as well, probably from the honey.  T: Much like the nose, the hops are enormous and very crisp. The honey is more prominent in the mouth than in the nose, and it pairs very well with the hops. A stellar DIPA.  M: Thick. Carbonation is nice. Feels like liquid silk.  D: 11%? Really? I might pick up a touch of alcohol, but not much. As with most very hoppy beers, I worry about palate fatigue, but as DIPAs go, this is as drinkable as I have had.  At $15.99 a six pack, Hopslam is cheaper than Manu DIPAs that are bomber only. Sure, its alot for a six pack, but this isn't just any beer here. It is as solid of a DIPA as I have had, and I would put it next to any of the East/West Coast Giants any day.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",Imperial IPA,98

Batch 9505 (packaged Jan 5, 2010, drank Jan 22, 2010) from a 12oz bottle into a Rouge pint glass.  Pours a fairly gold-to-amber color with a orange tint. For some reason I had remembered this being unfiltered, which I prefer, but this is clear with only a faint haze. No matter. Decent looking beer I guess.  Oh, God. Just the nose is arousing me. I would buy a Hopslam scented cologne. Probably the very best smelling beer I have ever smelled. Founders Harvest might be the runner up for that ""award"". Makes me want to dive headlong into it. Tons of fresh juicy grapefruit on the nose, a little pine in there too. Slight bit of alcohol on the nose, but not that much, esp. considering this is 10 percent.  Rich mouthfeel, some sweetness and a lil more prickly alcohol than the nose had. What has always made Hopslam interesting, to me, is that it isn't just another OMG REALLY HOPPY DIPA!. Everyone makes one of those. Hopslam is a really hoppy beer that has other stuff going on too. Hop character on the palate is good, but not quite all that the nose promises. I don't want to be ""that guy"" but I kind of feel like it was a little sharper last year. It obviously still provides plenty of hop character though. Not quite as grapefruity on the palate as the nose is, maybe a little more herbal character. Still pretty juicy though.

Light golden colored with a moderate amount of head poured into a snifter now, pint glass at dinner.  Amazing mango,peach,pinapple, and sweetnesss. Great smelling DIPA. inhaling this aroma before every sip is alone enough of a reason to buy it for me.  Great taste that mirrors the smell with a kick of piney hops rounding out the fruity sweetness, the tropical notes are really what does it for me, and this one is king in that regards. that pineapple and mango, tangerine....ah man its amazing what they do to this beer.  Smooth for this big a DIPA,light brisk carbination.  This is probally the most drinkable DIPA i've ever had along with PTE. Keep thinking it'd be way to easy to have at least 4 of these and get your butt kicked. Amazing Drinkability has been both friends immediate response.  So drinkable and tasty i'd love to have 3-4 of these at a time while it's available, and that's totally doable.

Average head retention with very minimal lacing left sticking to the sides of my glass. Slight foam stays on the edge of the beer.  Smell is very sweet and consistent of hops and the honey. Pineapple comes to mind with some grapefruit, lemon, and a very clean soap like smell. Take it its from the pine resin.  Taste is sweet with the citrus flavor coming up forward with pineapple, dominate honey, some lemon and then resides with a medium pine bitterness and herbal feel. Something about the taste, taste artificial(bust be the honey throwing me off).  Mouthfeel is full bodied with medium to high carbonation. Sticky and resiny, with a lot of flavor in the aftertaste.

Sheets of chunky soapy white lacing are left coating the glass.  Dank oily earthy hop aroma that's bursting with sweet citrus notes. There's also a prominent earthy pine presence as well as a bit of honey alongside a subtle malt profile in the nose.  Chewy resinous medium body that's on the fuller end of the spectrum with an explosion of juicy luscious dank hops. The hops are uber fresh and provide a slightly bitter dryness that lingers troughout into a slightly hot finish. There is a very prominent citrus fruit presence with hints of mango, pineapple, lemon and orange peel. A sweet honey character comes through mid-palate, complimenting the sweetness of the citrus notes and adding to the fullness of the palate. The sweetness is balanced by a dry earthy pine presence. Maltiness is very subtle but contributes to the amazing complexity and balance of this excellent beer.

It tastes almost like grapefruit juice and honey in fact. The hop flavor is really all grapefruit here, big juicy grapefruit.

Nice hazy golden hue and a nose that if was made into a perfume, i would fall in love with any girl wearing it. Tons of citrus, like every type of citrus fruit was squeezed into this fine brew. Not overly bitter, but just enough to make you want to pucker a little bit, very smooth and packed with more fresh hop taste than one could hope for. This is definately a beer i could sit down a pound a lot of, the only problem is the 10% ABV, which isnt a problem as much as an obstacle. wish this was more readily available throughout the year so i wouldnt have to stockpile so much at once, but i'll take it when i can get it and in as much quantity as possible!",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",Imperial IPA,98

Smells like its going to be very bitter.  T: Big hop bite right away, but is quickly mellowed out but a slight honey taste. Bitterness and very faint taste honey sit on the tong during aftertaste.  M: Very interesting mouth feel, I think this is where the honey stands out the most. Has a similar mouth feel to honey, if you could imagine a very, very watered down honey. Feels like it is coating my mouth.  Summary: Very cool beer, if you're a hop head, you will love the hop bite right away and the hoppy nose.

Appearance: The pour is the definition of the amber color. There's a finger of head, but it recedes quickly. There isn't much lace, just a few small macaroni size streams on the side of my glass. The beer is slightly effervescent; there's a nice medium sized stream of bubbles continually rising to the top of the glass. There's also very little yeast in the bottom of the bottle. The last pour into my glass doesn't present any yeast.  Smell: The nose is a blast of hops. A lovely blend of citrus and earthy hops. There's mango, white grapefruit, a little lemon, orange, pine and fresh grass. There's some sweetness in the background from the honey, but otherwise the pale malt is there merely to support the level of hops dropped into this.  Taste: First up to bat is the supportive pale malt. It doesn't last long. The hops quickly take over. More tropical, citrus and earthy notes show up. More mango, lemon, pine, grapefruit and grass. This lovely blend of hop flavors finishes the tasting off until the aftertaste in which some honey flavor starts to creep out. The aftertaste becomes a mixture of grapefruit and honey.  Mouthfeel: A medium body, slightly on the full side. The carbonation is lovely, nice and gentle on the palate. Hop oils are coating my teeth and gums.  Drinkability: I'm really glad I gave this another shot. My views of Hop Slam are much brighter now. The 12 ounce bottle makes it easy to drink on a weeknight given it's a ten percent beer. Looks like I'll be picking this up again next season.  Review #1 - 4/14/2009  Poured In: Pint Glass. Bought From: Ron's Castle Foods (Eau Claire, WI)  Appearance: Amber orange.  Smell: A nice hop aroma, but not quite as strong as I was expecting.  Taste: Crisp and bitter, although you can taste the sweet honey on the aftertaste.  Mouthfeel: Medium body. I suppose the tongue bruiser of an ale was the approach they were going for, but like someone else mentioned, I thought the carbonation was a bit much.  Drinkability: I'm reviewing HopSlam in April, so it's a few months old. The hop characteristics have probably faded, and now the alcohol taste might be starting to creep out a bit more. It's a good beer, without a doubt. I plan on buying it again during the next season of brewing, although I still think Two Hearted Ale keeps its place for the top beer from Bell's for me.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",Imperial IPA,98
287,17112,bbeane,4.27,"A- Poured into my favorite snifter... a light somewhat fizzy 1/4 inch head appears and disappears leaving some spotted lacing. Beer is light amber color and slightly cloudy  S- At first, has a mellow citrus nectar aroma. After some swirls of the glass a bitter skunkiness combines with the citrusy honey smell... delicious  T- At first sip, wasn't getting a lot of the honey... but as the beer warms a pleasant yet subtle honey flavor accompanies the awesome bitter hop flavor... superb!  M- Light medium body with light medium carbonation  D- I wish I had been able to get more. Wasn't expensive, but would have been worth every penny had it been more  CHEERS!!",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",Imperial IPA,98
287,17112,weasbri,4.39,"Light orange color, just okay head and lacing. Here comes the good part: one sniff and your senses start to light up. Bright and citrusy are the words that come to mind. I mean, even my sorry excuse for a nose can pick up the grapefruit and pineapple aromas. The flavor is much more pine resin laden. Not a bad thing, just very different from what you pick up in the smell. Definitely lots of bitterness. Like many other people, I wonder how this could possibly be a 10% ABV beer. It's big on the hops, but nothing like an imperial stout where you get a lot of vinous qualities from the alcohol. Very smooth and goes down easy. Dangerously drinkable.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",Imperial IPA,98
287,17112,OttoBomb,4.7,"12 oz. bottle poured into a Dogfish Head signature glass (January 20, 2010). Batch ""9470"" is printed on real label, which according to the website was packaged on Dec 23, 2009.  Eyes: Pours a hazy amber with a nice fluffy head. Not much lacing though.  Nose: Boom to the nose. A nice, strong hoppy, honey-grapefruit aroma erupts from the glass. Some pine, but an overwhelmimg grapefruit citrus smell dominates.  Tongue: A powerfully bitter hop punch hits, but is perfectly balanced by malty sweet grapefruit/pineapple punch. The bitterness in inescapable, but dissipates nicely under the weight of the sweet malt. Some bitterness lingers, but not close to the original punch.  Mouth: Some lively carbonation, but not too much that it overwhelms the palate. Just enough bubbles here to balance the smooth syrupy texture.  Libation: Christ, this is a good beer. I've had Hopslam in previous years and this is probably the best yet. Save for the 10% ABV, it is eminently drinkable. This brew appears simple but is surprisingly complex when you stop this analyse the taste. It has a complex honey and hop base, but strikes you with all kinds of floral aromas: fruity, spicy, and interesting. It is crisp and smooth, but mostly umami overall. I rarely drink just one, simply superb.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",Imperial IPA,98
287,17112,BillyBoysPie,4.72,"From a growler into a flute. I had a small portion at lunch - the rest is for some friends.  Transparent copper-gold with an eggshell colored head. Lots of lacing.  Rich hops - grapefruit, lemon, and a touch of the honey it's brewed with. A little bit of clean bitterness and pine. I can't wait to taste it.  Well balanced beer. The strong hop flavors aren't out of control and contain a great depth, and the honey keeps the hop flavors from being too bitter but doesn't make the beer cloying. Grapefruit, and lemon zest begin the beer, moving into honey flavors. The pine and traditional hop flavors finish the beer with a clean bitterness.  Spot on for a really well balanced DIPA. There are other beers trying to be stronger and more meaty, but this beer passes these up by far - and raises the bar on them. I'd say skip beers like the 120 IPA and stick with this. It's loads better.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",Imperial IPA,98
287,17112,Slatetank,4.65,"I had this on tap last evening at Brass Rail Deli in Campbelltown, PA. Served in a pint glass.  A - A slightly burnished golden shade w/ mild haziness - still able to see carbonation rising somewhat rapidly in the liquid. The head is approx 1 inch and snowy colored. The bead is very fine and a film of lace holds on the glass  S - lots of hop fruitiness w/ tropical, citrus and slight herbal notes. There is a mellow malt sweetness as well as interesting floral note in the background.  M- The feel is great - bitter up front w/ spicy hops and resinous floral character w/ a moderately high level of bitterness throughout and more than medium body w/ mild sweetness to anchor the hops w/ a significant yet well placed alcohol texture and semi dry finish  T - The taste is a blend of all things hoppy-pine and citrus like tangerine with a tinge of lychee, and grapefruity bitter tastes. The beer is slightly herbal, bordering on grassy, but clean with lemony tang that leads to a sweet honey tinge of malt much like green tea with the honey soaked sweet edge. The flavor has plenty of citrus peel which also seems to give off a piney aspect with a moderate alcohol taste in the finish  D - A well rounded IIPA, so tasty yet not extremely drinkable since by the end of the pint you feel, well...hopslammed. The beer is great fresh and I prefer it to the bottle, but should be approached with a reasonable amount of caution as it tastes similar to many beers well below its level of abv",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",Imperial IPA,98
287,17112,EehaiCJ,4.45,"This is the first time I've felt compelled to review a beer. My first notes date back to 12/30/06, and each year Hopslam never fails to satisfy. This might be the best batch yet.  Batch #9470 - Pours a clear orange with a frothy, soapy head that recedes to a thick ring that's easily revived, with intricate but messy lacing. Big, bright aroma of fresh grapefruit and piney hops with underlying floral notes. Quite sweet up front, followed by a medium-to-full and resinous body, finishing with an acidic and juicy punch of fresh grapefruit and tangerine. Transitions quickly into a piney hop aftertaste mixed with more tangerine and pineapple accompanied by a strong bitterness that builds and lingers. Drinkability is superb - this is a dangerous beer at 10%, it keeps begging for another sip, and eventually another bottle. Despite the sweetness I wouldn't call it balanced, it's definitely hop dominant.  Easy drinking, big fresh hop flavors, with a strong mouthfeel from front to back. Great stuff, and a very consistent seasonal. We might miss out on a lot of quality west coast offerings, but Hopslam isn't a bad consolation prize.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",Imperial IPA,98
287,17112,Kelp,4.47,"Thanks to Hayesez. A nice coppery color, decent lacing and a bit of a head to the beer.  Smells overwhelmingly of hops and more hops. Then pine and citrus follow.  The taste is well shockingly not overly hoppy. It has a nice balance of straight hops, crisp pine and just a hint of grapefruit at the end. Disappears nicely making you want to have another sip right away.  It has a slight carbonation to it. A dry aftertaste is left after a bit if you don't have more.  I could have a few of these which is saying a lot since i don't usually enjoy IPA's of any sorts. This however is an exceptional IPA no matter how you look at it.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",Imperial IPA,98
287,17112,travduke,4.7,"Thanks Bill for throwing this in as an extra. Poured into a pint glass.  Appearance: 2 finger head, copper body, nice lacing. This beer looks perfect.  Smell: Amazing! Hops, hops, hops! Piney, citrus, floral.  Taste: Taste is even better than the smell. I see why they call this HopSlam. Very well balanced with the amount of hop flavor.  Drinkability: This is 10%? I could drink 6 of these if I didn't know. There is no alcohol smell at all. Its true brewing genius.  Side Notes: I am very happy with this, definitely going to search for more of it.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",Imperial IPA,98
287,17112,afausser,4.72,"Picked up a couple bottles at Beer Run in Charlottesville, and paired with Teriyaki tofu stir fry, which by the way worked excellently.  A: Pours a dark honey with a fluffy finger of bubbly fluffy head. A bit of glittery lacing slinks down the side of the glass after each sip, with little bits sticking to the side of the glass. Wispy on top and hazy throughout with very tiny bubbles slowly making their way to the top in a fine stream, leaving the thinnest of rings around the glass.  S: Smells like walking into a garden. Sweet honey, yeast/bread and heavy floral scents as well as cinnamon and some nice spicy notes--and tropical fruit-pineapple is present, and passion fruit almost predominates. As expected, a ton of bitter hops which nicely are complemented by the floral, grassy, and sweet apple notes. As it warms, has a nice peppermint (and ground black pepper) addition.  T: Tastes quite similar to the smell, though 10 times hoppier. The bitter notes blend nicely with the floral ones, and the light (but strong) hoppy aftertaste has a hint of honey as it disappears. There's a bit of tropical fruits here too, especially as it warms, but not nearly as obvious as in the smell. There's a bit of mango and passion fruit but not really the pineapple that was in the nose. Piney and minty, with peppermints and spearmints. Bitter and strong, but never biting. Slight sweet caramel notes in the background, and a bit of fresh orange and the slightest amount of lemon peel. I would have expected far more grapefruit out of this one considering the amount of hops, especially as it warms. However, the most citrusy note I get from the taste is lemon.  M: Medium bodied with nice, tiny dancing carbonation bubbles. A slight hoppy and floral aftertaste, but it's light and unintimidating. A little warmth, but it's minuscule for a 10%. At times dry, but at other points comes across also as juicy at the same time. It's cool going down but a little warm in the aftertaste.  D: One of this beer's best features is appearing simple but surprising you at every turn with complexities. It has a solid honey and hops base, but with all kinds of floral scents, tropical fruits, and spices. Its smooth yet crisp, and cold but finishes warm. Excellent.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",Imperial IPA,98
287,17112,biggred1,4.47,Hazy copper with a small eggshell cap that leaves sticky rings of lace on the glass. The smell is pretty hop forward with dank and fruity pineapple and grapefruit rind hop notes with just a touch of honey. The flavor on this one is like drinking fresh hops straight up with just enough malt backbone and light honey sweetness to keep it in check. The alcohol is well hidden. Mild carbonation and medium bodied. Hopslam actually almost lives up to it's hype. This is what I look for in a DIPA. This beer is pretty darn hard to beat when served fresh.,Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",Imperial IPA,98
287,17112,MURF0320,4.62,"I was so excited, and extremely suprised, to see this on-tap in the crappy little town I work in. Poured an almost clear, bright, orange-honey with nearly an inch of white creamy head. Good rentention and lacing throughout. Smell is amazing...crisp floral hops, fresh citrus and pine. Taste lets the hops explode. The bitterness is so crisp and fresh and is perfectly balanced with smooth honey and a very light malt presence. Ever so slight alcohol presence that actually compliments the total balance and adds a bit of warmth. Mouthfeel is very nice. Very smooth, nice amount of carbonation while still having an almost creamy feel on the tongue. Semi-dry finish that lets an almost perfect bitterness, that begs for the next sip, linger on the tongue. It's amazing how quickly you will find yourself at the bottom of this 10% abv. I really had to resist the urge to have another, which was probably a good idea. There's always tomorrow. Highly recommended, especially for a draught that you can get on the east coast.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",Imperial IPA,98
287,17112,ghostee,4.92,"Poured from a 12 oz bottle into a pint glass.  Pours a hazy light orange color with about one finger of creamy white head.  Smell is HOPS! Just taking a sniff I can tell this will be nice and hoppy. The smell of hops is slightly sweet.  Taste starts off sweet with honey and sugar and some hoppiness. The sweetness dulls a bit and the hops get more intense. The finish is hoppy and bitter, and lingers, with a taste of grapefruit.  This does not taste like it's 10%, it's very tasty and drinkable. I could definitely see having a few of these in a night. However after finishing a couple I quickly came to the realization that this is a 10% beer.  While this is bitter and hoppy it is just so darn enjoyable. I can definitely see why people track this down every winter.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",Imperial IPA,98
287,17112,SpeedwayJim,4.48,"Poured from a 12oz. bottle into an Ithaca tulip.  A: Gentle pour creates a 1.5 finger coarse white head with moderate retention. Beer is a semi-clear orange. Great lacing, like a crown at the top of the glass.  S: Honey is strong in this one. Citrus, cane sugar, grapefruit, subtle piney hops. Nose is overall very crisp and pure though the honey sweetness can be a bit overpowering.  T: Grassy, pine hops, honey, malty backbone. Hops build in the middle but it's well balanced by the honey flavor. Finish is slightly hoppy but not overwhelming. An incredibly balanced beer with no real overpowering flavor. A bit of a citrus sourness at the end also. How this beer can be 10% I have no idea... no booziness in the nose or taste whatsoever... just pure deliciousness all the way!  M: Light to medium bodied, coarse, cabonated, and crisp. Very clean and easy to drink. Finish is quick and lingers just the right amount... a subtle twinge of hoppiness.  D: I can't imagine a beer more drinkable than this. Flavor is fantastic. Mouthfeel is excellent, helping me enjoy the balance of this beer. Clean, crisp, and incredibly refreshing, though this is a seasonal, its a beer for every occasion and weather. Hot, cold, mild, whatever you're doing and however the weather outside, you just can't go wrong with Hopslam.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",Imperial IPA,98
287,17112,TheFightfan1,4.83,"I bought the last case at Bound beverage in Bensalem PA. Poured into a tulip. Pours a slightly hazy apricot with a very fluffy soapy looking white heading. Leaves a mess of lacing everywhere.  Smell to my surprise is extremely fruity.Bubblegum,pear, and nice floral aroma to kind of bind thing's together.  Taste is amazing. Again tastes of bubblegum and pear and some nice fruitiness. The only thing I got wrong was the hops. They are in full force and is light but it is like drinking hop juice. The slightest bit of biscuity malt that matches well with the sweeter side of this beer that I can only think is honey.  Mouth is medium bodied but with a little warmth on the tongue. Very bitter on the palate and a lingering but very nice lingering of hops. Super smooth green hop juice is what I think of.  Drink is excellent. I have never found a IIPA that tastes this good yet. I am not a heavy drinker but when I drank this I found myself four deep without even realizing. The 10% ABV is very well hidden and this stuff literally goes down like water. EXCELLENT !!!

287,17112,EighchBrews,4.52,"This was my first experience with Hopslam. I enjoy cask beers in general so this was definitely a treat. Thanks to the Flying Saucer in KC for this opportunity.  As I approached the firkin, I was picking up the aroma from those who passed by me with their full glasses of Hopslam. So before really getting to examine the appearance I was struck with smells of sweet citrusy fruit. As the bartender handed me my Bell's tulip, I gazed deep into the hazy golden-orange elixir. Being a cask beer their was no head, but only a few soap-like bubbles lingering on the surface. With the beer in hand I began to pick up more of the sweet malty characteristics in the aroma.  The first taste was, of course, exceptional. I immediately knew this beer deserves all the hype it gets. Hops! and a lot of them, but not just the bitterness. Tropical fruit along with some piney resinous flavors. From what I have heard about hopslam is that it contains honey. It is definitely apparent and along with the malt provides the perfect backbone to this wonderful beer.  Cask beer doesn't have the carbonation of other serving styles, but I am a big fan of cask beers so I like that. However, there was a bit of slickness to the beer as it warmed. This is definitely nit picking as it didn't deter me from drinking three of these.  Hopslam is everything I expected and more. For a 10% hop bomb this beer is SUPER drinkable. As I said, I had three of these and besides being a bit tipsy, I felt great. If I had more time and $$ I probably would have ordered another.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",Imperial IPA,98
287,17112,punkrkr27,4.26,"Slightly hazy orange-gold pour with a small white head. Aroma is lots of citrusy hops and honey sweet malt with a little bit of noble hop spicinesses and a hint of orange zest. Tastes like a glass full of wet, juicy, piny hops with a little noble hop spice and a very slight malt background. Body is a bit on the thin side with a tingly carbonation. Note: Batch 8283 seems to have a sharper pine note to the hop profile.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",Imperial IPA,98

A- Poured into a Bell's tulip glass, the elixir was had an orange hue with a one inch white head, which left beautiful rings around the glass as I quaffed down the drink. It was very clear without much carbonation.  S- It's named HopSlam for a reason. My nostrils were overwhelmed by grapefruit, floral hops, and the slightest touch of honey and alcohol.  T- Wow. This was one tasty beer. Even my roommate, who detests my hoppy beers, found it appealing. This is definitely one hoppy beer with grapefruit and florals dominating the palate, and I did not pick up much piny flavors. The honey and alcohol are present in the finish, although they are not overwhelming, along with some wonderful bitterness.  M- It is a bit chewy, which I expect out of a great IIPA. I would have liked a little more carbonation but this was not a real drawback. It had a wonderful feel on the tongue.  D- Is this really 10%? The alcohol was well hidden and I could drink this all night. The hops were not overwhelming and the sweetness of the honey helped balance the finish.

287,17112,cassanoj,4.8,"Poured into a pint glass. Beautiful orange honey colored head with a big white head and a truckload of lacing.  Smells like ...SLAM! I swear a whole hop just smacked me in the face. Fresh, hoppy, a bit floral and tropical fruits burst onto the scene, grapefruit, pineapple, mango, the whole island. This is the hoppy, citrusy assault I look for when drinking a DIPA. Sweet, yet bitter.  The taste brings...ANOTHER SLAM! I'm getting my ass kicked by this one. Others have said it before, but I must reiterate - Like chewing on a hop. A bit of malt in the back keeps this monster together while hops and citrus dominate the forefront. This is 10% abv?! Prove it! Awesome, awesome, awesome.  My mouth is still numb from the beat down it just endured. Sticky, sweet, smooth, bitter. This beer is a paradox to my tongue.  I could drink HopSlam all night and then I would die a happy man. Some would argue that this beer is just loaded with hops without much complexity, but I dare those people to find many a tastier beverage.  *I have to drop the smell of HopSlam just a tad after getting a whif of Pliny the Younger on Monday.

Thank you Mr. Hoover for getting me a bottle while I am waiting impatiently for my own case to take it's good ol' time to get in my Beer Ark. So this being my first time to score a bottle...last year too little too late. I am pouring the only bottle I have. The hype machine is in full swing and the forums are abuzz with its overpriced, unavailable, overrated, not as good as anything brewed in Cali, gotta have it, can't get it Hopslam!  So it first glace she is a lovely mash of yellow with hues of gold. Amidst the beauteous body mad rushes of co2 race to the surface. I notice the fluffy cream colored head that has traces of lacing. I have brewed with honey and unless the brew has wheat the head retention is usually not this resilient.  The aroma is mostly hop forward in a piney grapefruit character. Stronger whiffs reveal a little alcohol along with faint traces of honey and grains. Well the first sip was quite a treat. I have been waiting for ever it seems for this moment to get here and I don't want to be let down. I am not disappointed. I find this to be quite unique in my experience with beers of this style. Tastes of honey with grapefruit pounding my tongue a slight heat from the 10% ABV. This is a solid ale. I can take large quaffs and I can sip it just the same. The hop flavors range from pine, grapefruit, minty, a tad of funky/skunky. The grain bill while seeming to be much more simplistic with only a trace of caramel, this body allows the honey to take on the other profiles of sweet.  With this many flavors going on at once it would tend to be a ale with a giant carry over of after tatse. i find this not to be the case at all. Hopslam finishes cleanly for an ale of this style.

Color is a reddish-amber tone.  First sip has some very deep flavors. The hops are definitely there and are in full force. Aftertaste is very bitter, with a sense of the oily residue from the hops evaporating off of your pallet. That in itself makes it distinctive from other types of DIPA's out on the market.

287,17112,bigdonniebrasco,4.62,"I traveled 90 minutes, and showed up 3 hours early to try this....  Served in a Bell's tulip at Flying Saucer, Kansas City, MO.  I had waited (not so patiently) for this release for a LONG time! Appearance was a bright amber/orange, with almost no head. I think the previous reviewer stated that ""all cask beers suffer from a nonexistent head"". I will agree that there was no head on it, but I hesitate to say this golden elixir ""suffered"" from it.  This is a beer drinking experience that begins with a fruity waft as far away as arms length. The aroma is more reminiscent of a tropical fruit smoothy, than that of a beer.... but then again this is no ordinary beer! Without the punch of added C02 the nose is a little different, heavier on the fruit and lighter on the grass/pine, but like it was said before, just different, not detrimental.  The mouthfeel on this cask version is, in a word ""slippery"". The hoppy oils are there in spades, along with the hop bite we all showed up for. You WILL notice the malt and honey sweetness more in this ""flatter"" version than you will from draft or bottle. I actually preferred the cask serving over the draft serving that I tried immediately after, although only marginally.  For me the drinkability of this amazing brew is actually enhanced when served from a cask. Not something that you necessarily need when talking about a 10% ABV hop-bomb.  I too, would like to thank the flying sauce for getting two of only THREE firkins in the entire state of KS! I'll keep coming back!

Beer left a strong lacing for the first sips, but began to weaken as I drank more of the beer.  Smell - Very strong hops, with a slightly sweet, malty background. You can faintly smell the presence of the honey they say is brewed in.  Taste - Hops, hops and more hops! What a great first impression. A mixture of piney, and grapefruit hoppy taste hit me first. As I drank more, I could begin to taste a subtle hint of honey. I was surprised this beer has 10% abv, I could really hardly smell, or taste that much alcohol.  Mouthfeel - Nice medium body. Not overly heavy like some IPA's with this much alcohol can be.  Drinkability - What a great beer! Something I will look forward to at the beginning of every year. A really pleasant beer.

D- Again this beer is intgralling! At 10% alcohol, you expect nothing but booziness. Couldn't be more wrong! I could drink this beer at anytime of year at anytime of day. It's smooth hoppy flavor goes down all right! Extremely drinkable and a great beer!",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",Imperial IPA,98
287,17112,jzeilinger,4.04,"Updated on 2/8/16 and rating adjusted accordingly.  A - One of the strong points of this beer. Very clear, vibrant honey gold color with a very nice thick, creamy, white head that's very sticky on the glass. (As it's always been.)  S - Honey malt sweetness with some faint citrus and alcohol effervescence.  T - Sweet honey with balanced citrus and booze from start to finish. The citrus resin starts to build as it gets closer to the end of the can. Citrus: lemon, orange, and grapefruit with some lingering resin and spice.  M - Medium heavy body, velvety, silky carbonation, exquisite texture on the tongue.  O - Had to re-visit my previous review and although it's good, it's not what I remember this to be in the past. Falls way short on the nose but shines on the look and feel. ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------  Previous review:  Pours a hazy bright golden orange color with mild amounts of carbonation, with a thick, creamy white head into my Bell's snifter. It's not totally clear because there are particulates in the glass which give it a slightly cloudy appearance. The lacing sticks to the side of the glass.  The smell of this stuff is absolutely amazing: thick, acrid, resinous, oily hops - it's euphoric in smell. The hops alo exhibit a strong citrus aroma blended with pine and a little bit of pineapple and mandarin orange.  The taste has a very distinct pungent, tart and acrid, citrus character. The only other beer I've gotten this big of acrid tartness is the Smuttynose Big A. (but we're not here to review that) Also pick up hints of honey in the taste but the citrus fruit dominates on such a level that it's off the scale. There's a touch of malty sweetness to offset the massive amounts of hops and adds just the right amount of offsetting balance. I've always been surprised that more honey doesn't come through in the nose, it's only on the tongue when it finally reveals itself.  Mouthfeel is atringent, a little sticky, medium body, and surprisingly finishes more on a citrus note than a bitter one. The hop aftertaste is mixed with sweet citrus, a little metallic-like, finishes in an amazing way. There's (in my own interpretation), no alcohol detection at all in the taste - it's absolutely amazing.  The funny thing, I wonder how many of you are actually reading this review since there's 1300 other ones and if you're checking a BA score on this one, chances are you already know something about its mystique. -----------------------------------------------------------------",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",Imperial IPA,98
287,17112,BDLbrewster,4.54,"Pours a crystal clear amber color with honey highlights and lots of visible carbonation. Has a small fizzy head that dissipates pretty quickly leaving some ropey lacing.  The smell is full of sweet honey infused vegetative green goodness. Honey, sweet citrus, some fruity esters and candied grapefruit show through here. Kind of smells like the inside of a fresh bag of gummy candy.  The taste shines with green tasting flavorful hop oils, the kind that lend tons of fresh herbal flavor and not a tongue ripping bitterness. Some notes of honey, sugary grapefruit and non-astringent lime combine with a subtle alcohol warmth and a fair level of leafy bitterness. Amazingly balanced DIPA.  The mouthfeel is smooth, on the thin side of medium bodied and appropriately carbonated.  Overall a very well hidden high ABV, balanced non-cloying flavors and a less than syrupy texture make Hopslam seem heaven sent. This gives any DIPA a run for its money in the strength vs. drinkability category.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",Imperial IPA,98
287,17112,jdg204,4.5,"On my latest outing to Abe's Cold Beer in Bethlehem, I was thrilled to find several ""rare birds"" of the beer world. Topping the hit list was Bell's HopSlam, a legend in it's own time.  A: Pours a transparent amber color with a fair sized, white head that left decent lacing.  S: Citrus, grapefruit, and honey aromas fill the glass.  T: A nice blend of citrus, grapefruit, and honey lead the charge. The up-front sweetness is quickly balanced by a serious biting hop flavor that is not for the faint of heart. A pretty nice blend of malt and hops, pretty excited about the balance.  M: Medium body with solid carbonation .  D: A terrific brew that is well deserving of it's accolades, a hardy well done to Bell's! the brewer's did a great job distinguishing themselves from the ""west coast"" DIPA style and still achieving a beer with serious bite and good balance. That being said, I was a tad disappointed, expecting this brew to crack the top 10 of my tastings, but then I quickly realized you can never be disappointed when you try a brew of this quality. This is clearly a must try, a classic well deserving of praise.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",Imperial IPA,98
287,17112,Brenden,4.67,"To be honest, I've seen negative reviews of this one along with the hype. Let me just say to begin that I've never met a food or drink critic (several of whom I know well) who didn't agree with my assessment. Just a disclaimer.  The color is a deep, slightly clouded amber-copper. A sturdy, dense two fingers of white head sit atop this brew, leaving plenteous lacing in thick patches on the glass. The aroma is pure, fresh, clean, and raw. An abundance of hops brings out all the subtleties of pine, flora, and, primarily, grapefruit, with just the lightest touch of honey sweetness balanced by a caramel malt that's at a perfect level to allow the hops to take precedence without drowning out anything else. This brew possesses a thoroughly impressive poignancy and balance. The taste is absolutely as balanced and just as pure, fresh, clean and raw. I've never had a beer that, while having such a flavorful hops presence up front, has absolutely no astringency or acidity to mar it. This is as good as balance gets, and I can't imagine a cleaner flavor. This beer is a masterpiece of brewing and a testament to the subtleties and intricacies of the art. The mouthfeel is smooth, with a light nip to begin that gives way to a nice, not quite creamy texture. Carbonation is light to moderate and the body is medium to full. I'd drink a dozen of these in a a sitting if I could, but the ABV forces me to be satiisfied with a couple at a time at most.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",Imperial IPA,98
287,17112,natelocc787,4.24,"Apricot golden body, tiny hop flecks visible and a classic ivory creamy, spritzy cap. The nose is very aromatic like a freshly prepped bowl of ambrosia. Lots of ripe citrus in the nose, specifically tangerine and ruby red grapefruit. Small pine character in the background. The taste is crisp, hoppy and I could tell upon first drink the mouthfeel is superb. The label claims this beer was brewed with honey and I think I could tell that for myself even if they didn't help out with that bit of information. Hops, hops and more hops, well balanced though with a good sized malt backbone,pale and caramel malts try to balance the hop onslaught and do, almost, lots of honey encrusted tangerine, resinous, pithy hops buds, the honey gives a sweet, sugary parity to the beer along with notes of dried apricots. Mouthfeel is sharp, nectary and crisp. The taste is big but not great. I appreciate the boldness, bitterness, balance and power of the hops, it's just not amazing. I'll say it, it's overrated a little. Change the name from Hopslam to Bells Double IPA and this beer averages to an A- and doesn't crack the top 100 or garner as much hype.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",Imperial IPA,98
287,17112,cratez,4.72,"355ml bottle purchased by my girlfriend at Beer World in Largo, Florida.  Appearance: bright amber-orange hue with a solid white cap and several dots of lacing on the tulip glass.  Smell: grapefruit, pineapple, flowery hops, lychee, tangelo, honey, and mango. The Centennial, Simcoe, and Crystal hops just smack you in the face. Simply the most pungent and aromatic beer that I've encountered.  Taste: big citric, bitter and pithy hop flavours with orange zest, grapefruit, lemon peel, lime, and a pleasant, tropical fruitiness (passion fruit, pineapple) upfront. Malt profile imparts caramel and honey with a bit of cookie dough mid-palate. Strong bitterness lingers in the finish, but it's kept in check by a malty sweetness. A truly beautiful symmetry of bold, balanced flavours.  Mouthfeel is juicy, smooth, and oily with mild carbonation. Sharp hop bite hits midway with a clean bitterness and some alcoholic warmth going down.  Overall, Bell's HopSlam is one of those special beers that you only come across once in a while. An unusually drinkable DIPA with way more character than the vast majority of beers that I normally drink. Pure deliciousness.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",Imperial IPA,98
287,17112,DAllspaw,4.14,"Poured from bottle into tulip. Lighter golden color and white head, certainly lighter than expected. The aroma was unlike anything I've had before. The sheer volume of citrus, esp. grapefruit, and pine is truly unbelievable. I'm talking grapefruit smoothie. Great taste, the honey helps round out the malt, perhaps too much and just a bit too sweet for my liking, but nonetheless a pretty special beer.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",Imperial IPA,98
287,17112,MetalHopHead6,4.49,"Bell's HopSlam poured a very light straw-like color with a thick white head. It left good amount of lace on the glass.  A sweet citric aroma exploded from the bottle during the pour. The flavor matched the promise of the smell with honey and grapefruit dominating. The feel of this ale was remarkable, blasting the mouth with bitterness. It feels so crisp and clean that the alcohol content is barely noticeable, though it does sneak up.  My one beef with HopSlam is the color, which is similar to an every-day Lager. Otherwise, it can best be described as a perfect balance of sweet and bitter with each characteristic existing in the extreme.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",Imperial IPA,98

Poured from a 12oz. bottle into a snifter:  Appearance and Smell:poured a bright translucent golden orange with a nice 1/4"" foamy head without much force. Smelled of citrus and mango with a definite looming heavy sweetness which was probably the added honey. Mostly grassy and piney notes coming through from heavy hopping.  Taste and Mouthfeel:Very interesting mouthfeel to this thing. Pretty thick and creamy with plenty of initial sweetness.Tasted of grapefruit, citrus, and subtle caramel malt. Finished fairly dry due to how heavily hopped it was but most likely the added honey is what stuck around the mouth along with some biting bitterness.  Drinkability:I was craving an IPA and this satisfied my needs and then some. This was a unique one from what I've tried. This would be very intense if not for the added honey I'd have to think. I drank this nice and fresh and it let me know. Outside of the strange finish which turned me off quite a bit this was a thoroughly enjoyable beer.

Beer poured orange with a nice white head that is leaving lacing behind-4.5. Nose is perfect, totally perfumed by citrus hops, even halfway into the bottle-5.0! Taste is sweet, citrus hops greet you kindly with sweet honey lingering nicely in the background. Strong malt backbone blends in to keep things nicely balanced-4.5. Mouthfeel is silky smooth from the honey and malts, a full bodied brew that glides nicely across the palate-5.0. Drinkability is perfect, the high abv is well hidden. The honey makes this a sweet brew but also makes it dangerously drinkable! There has been a lot of chatter about this brew in the forums lately and i can definitely see why it is highly touted-5.0! Overall average 4.77.  Re-review 3-2-2019: Beer poured orange with a solid white head that has some great hang time - 4.5. Nose is citrus forward with a touch of dankness - 4.25. Taste is citrusy with a nice infusion of pine - very dank. Finish is light to moderate hop bitterness - 4.25. Mouthfeel is full bodied and very smooth-4.5.

287,17112,billab914,4.74,"It's finally Hopslam release month, and it's time to review this beast. Poured from a 12 oz bottle into my Dogfish snifter. Poured amber, slightly gold in color with a thin white layer covering the top. It laced nicely on the sides of the glass as I drank it,.  Aroma is sweet and hoppy. It's very sweet smelling presumably from the honey and the hops are very citrusy with some grapefruit and orange. Really, a blast of sweet hoppiness is a great way to describe the aroma from this beer.  Taste is a lot like the nose, very sweet and hoppy. The hops give it a nice floral citrusness with some grapefruit, orange and a little pine flavor. The sweetness definitely sets this apart from a lot of DIPA's. The bitterness is pretty mild for all the hops in it.  Mouthfeel is medium bodied with moderate carbonation. Drinkability is very good, especially for the abv%. it's very good tasting and easy drinking. I could drink this all year long if they made it.  Overall this deserves to be one of the top rated DIPA's in the world.

287,17112,TKEbeerman,4.82,"A: I've seen better and I've seen worse, but I have to say, Hopslam has a better then average look. This brew pours a golden yellow with a thick off white head. I wish I had poured this into my tulip to really get a good appreciation for the burlyness of the head.  S: Sweet hoppy goodness, it's like an explosion of tasty, mouth watering hops in your nose. Piny and fresh citrus fruity notes, with hints of sweetness that I'm sure the honey adds.  T: As far as DIPA's go, this one is one of the most palatable, yet complex and pleasing examples of the style I've ever had. IPA's present a problem of balance. Start your beer journey off with a bad example of this style, and you may never drink another IPA again. Start your journey off with a hopslam, however,DIPA's may quickly become a style of choice. It's obvious that the addition of honey gives this beer it's balance without disturbing it's hop characteristics.  M:The label claims that Hopslam is a tongue bruiser of an ale. I'd have to disagree. I'd say Hopslam is more like that lovely lady you meet at the bar that caresses you to buy her a drink or two. As far as my tongue goes, I've had hops that totally destroy my pallet, this brew leaves it begging for more. A silky smooth, medium body brew is such a delightful characteristic of the huge DIPA.  D: 10% alcohol normally makes me slow my drinking down to a sip and a crawl, this isn't the case with Hopslam. My pallet is in good shape, my taste buds are in awe, my buzz is in check, and I'll be happy to crack open another.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",Imperial IPA,98
287,17112,livewire78,4.34,"Poured a nice golden hazy cloudy color with a nice fluffy white head that stuck around just long enough and left beautiful white lacing the entire way down the glass.  When I opened the bottle , tho ol' lady in the NEXT ROOM asked what the hell I had just opened. Can you say hops?. Holy crap in a dump truck, how is it poossible to have that much hops in just the aroma?  The taste is intense to say the least and I love it. There is some malt in there but nothing in comparison to the hops. The hops are like an Angus Young riff in the front row at an AC/DC concert while the malt bill is like some guy playing a kazoo in a locked closet in their dressing room. Kablam!!  Mouthfeel is adequate, however, for me I wish it was just a tad bit more oily to match the hop profile.  If you like hops then this is just the beer for you but to have more than a couple you would seriously have palate fatigue. This ain't no session beer. Also have it fresh!! It will blow you away fresh but it seriously will fade over time.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",Imperial IPA,98

T: Sweet honey up front followed by a citrus/pineapple attack finished with a suprisingly light bitterness (relative to the style of DIPA). The honey sweetness weaves in and out of the flavor.  M: Heavy at first, but finishing a little light. Not an enamel stripper, but leaves a gritty feeling on the teeth.  Drinkability: Good.

The head takes a good couple of minutes to dissipate and leaves good lacing on the sides of the glass. Good carbonation coming up from the bottom of the glass.  Smell: One of the best smelling DIPAs out there. Grapefruit and pine aromas abound, as well as bright floral hops and a hint of what smells like pineapple. Mmmm...yummy.  Taste: As the name suggests, there is a decent punch of hop flavor, but it is surprisingly well balanced between the hoppy bitterness and malty sweetness; probably due in part to the honey/malt combo in the recipe. While some DIPAs finish a bit harshly, the balanced character of this beer lasts throughout the drinking experience. Just a great, crisp, smooth taste.  Mouthfeel: Medium bodied; good carbonation and hops offset the high ABV/malt character.  Drinkability: Probably one of the most drinkable DIPAs out there. The 10 percent ABV is hardly discernible and there is no boozy flavor to speak of. This is so smooth in fact that if you're not careful, it might pull the old sneak-attack on you!  This is definitely one of my favorites.

287,17112,LoveMeAGoodBeer,4.85,"I tried this beer in bottled form from a six pack that I purchased.  This beer pours with a very lovely color similar in tint to that of pineapple juice (due to lighting it may appear brighter or darker depending on the room).  The effervescent aroma of hops hits both the nose and the palate with a ""slam"" very indicative of its namesake.  Though quite bitter through the immediate tasting, its sweet counterbalance, with the help of honey as an ingredient, replenishes the initial hop effect with a very accommodating smoothness.  This gracious transition allows this particular beer to be both robust, and yet, also extremely drinkable because of the subtle and smooth juxtaposition of the intense hops proportionally balanced by a sweet merger of honey and malt, flourishing with this brew's ability to transcend from a very intense hop distinction to a sweet, almost nectar-like effect in its final palate effects. Simply put, this is a ""must-have beer"" for any hop head or anyone who wants to try a great beer!",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",Imperial IPA,98

I'm drinking on Jan. 15.  A: Poured into a Founders pint, it's a bright orange-honey color with a slightly pillowy head that leaves good lacing throughout.  S: Hard to beat this in the DIPA category. I've heard folks call this ""Four-Hearted,"" as in, a doubled version of Bell's Two-Hearted. The nose makes the best argument for this. It's like the pineapple and orange aromas from the Two-Hearted are amplified here. Really huge citrus-fruit aromas. Lovely.  T: If I didn't know there was honey brewed into this beer, I'd realize it right now. Instead of being walloped by hops or alcohol, the first wave over the mouth is a clean honey sweetness, which goes a long way in preparing the mouth from the hop onslaught that's coming. The hop bitterness comes out big time, and then the honey reveals itself again on the finish.  M: Good carbonation -- beer feels neither creamy nor prickly in the mouth.  D: Incredibly drinkable for a 10% DIPA. Wow.

Pours a very bright orangey-amber color with medium sized white cap that receds nicely to a good rim layer, with plenty of residual lace.  Nose is very bright with fresh fruit. Literally those nose on this compared to other DIPA's is like comparing fresh squeezed OJ to some generic brand made from concentrate. Fresh, citrusy, floral, a delight... While I get mostly orange and grapefruit there's also some miscellaneous tropical fruit that I can't nail down - maybe mango, pineapple, apricot perhaps.  On the palate I'm amazed at the honeyed & gently sweet flavors that start things off for the big hop flavors that follow. Although they're full-flavored, they're not overwhelming like a Double Bastard, for example. Just right for this style, IMO. Alcohol is masked relatively well and this is a delight to drink.

It begins with a sweet grainy taste followed by a strong citric but equally sweet grapefruit sweetness. There is also some hints of almond and of course the sweet honey. The malty grain is definitely present and there is some biscuit and bready taste midway through the beer hidden behind the sweetness and citrusy character. Hop character can be felt throughout the beer. It finishes with a biscuity taste and the characteristics dry, bitter and citric hop tastes. As the beer warms the ABV is definitely perceivable but is very well hidden with the honey and the rest of the beer.  M - medium-light, with good CO2 balance and very complex flavors.  D - High aside from the ABV. Plus, the fact that its a limited release makes you want to make it last.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",Imperial IPA,98
287,17112,olympuszymurgus,4.8,"Thanks to khumbard for the fine box today. I couldn't help but open a hopslam immediately.  Golden amber, barley fields coated in fine wildflower honey, the finest days on a sunny farm. Citrus and pine, muted behind a rosy wink of delight. Smooth and crisp, who said it is 10% I do not believe! 5 or 6, sure, but no this cannot be that big.

287,17112,FreshmanPour77,4.42,"Reviewed on 01-14-10 Cold from a bottle to a glass  A - Golden amber color, 2 fingers of foam with lots of carbonation present throughout the glass, great head retention with a ring of lacing  S - Sweet citrus hop smell followed with a piney smell.  T - I just received a Chuck Norris type round house kick to the face of hops! Followed by a karate chop of pine. For a second I thought I was deep in the northern woods of Minnesota with the pine aftertaste. For such a harsh reality of a brew it turned smooth pretty quick. This to me made it very enjoyable  M/D - Not that I have had that many but this by far is the hoppiest brew that I have enjoyed to date. Being pretty fresh though I couldn't do that many in one sitting but very much so worth it. I enjoyed a one year old HopSlam at New Years and of course lighter on the hop kick but still very enjoyable. A for sure brew to drink fresh or with some age on it, I had bought a sixer so I plan to update and add to this review with some added notes as time goes by!",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",Imperial IPA,98
287,17112,Burl41,4.97,"Appearance- Golden and honey is color, with a great firm two finger head. It is cleanly filtered with no haze.  Smell- Wow, hops normally do not have this aroma. A citrus smell, without any resiny or sharp bitter notes. unique and pleasing to say the least.  Taste- I don't know of a way to discribe this brew as other than exceptional. There is an amazing hop pressence but it is tempered by the slight very slight sweetness of the honey. What comes through is an amazingly smooth and delightful DIPA. Citrus, hop notes abound, with a very small amount of carmal malt sneaking in.  Mouthfeel- Again, perfectly balance.  Drinkability- Most DIPA's have such a punch of bitterness, that they become a beer to be slowly sipped. Much like a cup of coffee that was hot enough to sue over. But this is so smooth and delightful, one cannot taste the alchohal even though it is 10%. I have had many beers at the 7.5% mark that where much more noticble. A great session beer, however you might end up on the floor if you attempt it.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",Imperial IPA,98
287,17112,Dsb3350,4.25,"Bell's hopslam. What can you say that hasn't already been said. I bought this beer in bottle form for a decent price, $4 a bottle. Poured the beer into a standard American pint and it held a great frothy head. Immediate overwhelming hop presence in the nose. I could smell this beer all evening. This beer taste of a hop plant, check the label. It starts strong and finish's like a 12 round heavy weight champion. It's mouthfeel is a like a lingering hangover sitting on your tongue. I feel that if you drink more than two you will not be able to drink anything else for the rest of the night...and I would be totally fine with that.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",Imperial IPA,98
287,17112,drtth,4.3,"Served in a 12oz snifter. Glass of cold water on the side to sip from periodically.  Appearance: As served the beer is a nice dark tangerine color with a 1/8"" white head that receded to a ring and an irregular shaped film of foam on the surface of the liquid. Throughout the beer sipping left some nice, but sparse lacing.  Smell: The aroma has a soft pleasant almost floral citric character that mingles together some orange, tangerine and lemon flower with some hints of malt and honey.  Taste: Much as expected from the nose, the complex flavor of the beer is almost sweet with honey and malt backbone and it is almost bitter with the flavors of orange zest and tangerine. But the flavor is also unexpected from the nose as there are some tropical fruits thrown in for good measure.  Mouthfeel: The mouth feel is full to medium bodied and smooth, with moderate but persistent carbonation that lasts throughout the beer. The finish is long and gentle with hop flavors riding on the sweetness until they gradually fade away leaving a slight dryness that invites the next sip.  Drinkability: This is a first rate DIPA that is well made and very very drinkable. I could easily have another right now but will pass because of the ABV. I'm sure I'll be having this again. One particularly nice thing about this beer is that one can taste the hops without the tongue rasping that characterizes many DIPAs. But that being said, for me this is not at the top of my short list simply because out of the bottle and with a bit more age I can pick up traces of the honey which is something I prefer more hidden or not in the beer at all. I like this one much better on tap.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",Imperial IPA,98
287,17112,nkersten,3.62,"A- Light golden, honey color with minimal head. Very little lacing. S- Aroma is very good, dominated by complex hops, mostly tropical fruit with some piney hops crammed in there somewhere. T- After such an impressive aroma, the taste is a bit of a let down. Not nearly as much hop flavor as there is in the smell. Still, tropical hop flavors, some pale malt but nothing interesting, a bit on the sweet side. Some alcohol in the aftertaste as well, but the sweetness of the beer does a decent job at covering it up. Not overly bitter but still plenty of hop character. M- Medium body and carbonation, like most midwest DIPAs this one seems to be a bit heavier then it needs to be. D- With the high abv I dont think I could have more then a couple of these before I moved on to something else. A bit disappointing, not my favorite imperial IPA.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",Imperial IPA,98
287,17112,ShogoKawada,4.41,"From my first BIF.. thanks a billion, MbpBugeye!!!  The only other Bell's I had was The Oracle. Interesting to see how this compares.  A- Beautiful. Glowing amber/orangey with ruby highlights. Snow-white head that settles to two fingers and laces immediately. Great, dense head with good retention. Looks like damn near the best DIPA I've ever seen.  S- Reminds me of PtE.. sweet, floral, citrus, not sure if I'm picking up on the honey or if it's just the sweet floral hops.  T- OK, I can taste the honey. Citrus, sweet citrus fruit, not overripe but darn close (not that that's a bad thing). A bit of bitter/pine that I didn't get in the nose comes through at the end, but it is very mild and helps cut through the sweetness. Malt is a bit bready but really playing second fiddle to the hops here.  M- Where's the ABV? Incredible. A hop head's dream.  D- High, ABV in mind... I could get into some serious trouble with this one. One of the better third coast offerings. Worth seeking out if you like your hops.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",Imperial IPA,98
287,17112,Minotaur,4.64,"I don't buy into hype. I expected to go to the Bell's Dinner at Spinnerstown Hotel in PA and SLAM hopslam as another over-hopped, over-hyped burly man brew.  Wrong!  The color was a pleasant orange-amber with some darkness at the center. The head seemed solid and full, and hung around for quite a while.  I took my first sniff and it was an explosion of aromatic citrus, sweetness, pine, grasses and herbs - all in the hops and honey.  The flavor is an amazingly complex, balanced and tantalizing. It is juicy and sweet with honey and grainy malt. Toasted bread and jam-like grapefruit and orange. Each sip also fills the nose with more intense but not upsetting hop fragrance.  The mouthfeel is full, smooth and satisfying. As you drink down the glass the flavors seem to become deeper, smoother and heavier with the bitterness increasing but never becoming overwhelming. The alcohol presence is subdued for the huge amount hidden in this brew.  It is extremely, dangerously drinkable.  I don't normally like IPA/DIPA blends but I feel this is a beer that not only exemplifies but help to set the standards of a beer.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",Imperial IPA,98
287,17112,05Harley,4.8,"Bottle # 9501 (12/09)  Purchased through West lakeview Liquors, Chicago  Price - $17.49/6-pack  Appearance: It pours a hazy golden color with fines in suspension. After a few minutes the head disappears to just a ring around the glass.  Smell: Hops! Hops! Hops! So damn good. Pine and citrus round it out.  Taste: WOW! This beer is amazing. Bitter (but not overwhelming) with a slite taste of honey which is just enough to balance out the massive burn one would expect from a hop bomb. Grapefruit coming through in the backround. Alcohol is well hidden at 10%.  Mouthfeel: Low carbonation. Goes down smooth with a thin body and leaves a slite bitter after taste.  Drinkability: Oh yeah!! My problem is I didn't buy enough of it. I'm kicking myself in the ass for not biting the bullet. Do yourself a favor and stock up. Good job Bell""s!!",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",Imperial IPA,98
287,17112,Buebie,4.51,"taken from notes, had ontap a few nights ago.  Poured into a pub glass, producing a solid 1+ inches of frothy white head. Receding to leave thick lace coverage and a good collar of white. Transparent filtered look, color is a darker gold.  Aroma is quite fruit forward with pineapple, pine, grapefruit, malt still comes through though with hints at caramel and biscuits.  Taste is an amalgamation of flavors and aromas coming together to form one badass beer. All aroma's transferred into taste, pineapple and mango coming through swinging in a sweet nectar. Hops do bitter up through the swallow with pine and lingering grapefruit. Pineapple sings through all flavors lingering amongst the bitters in a semi sweet caramel filled delight. Mouthfeel is terrific as usual with an abundance of soft carbonation and a semi creamy feel to it. Alcohol in heat is not present in aroma or taste, making this one dangerous brew!  Awsome as always.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",Imperial IPA,98
287,17112,CaptMurdock,4.69,"Poured from a tap into a 12 oz snifter.  Appearance: A very relaxed amber with hazy undertones. There is a very small head which vanishes quickly and leaves minimal lacing.  Smell: Wow. As I was talking to the bartender I could smell the hops wafting up to me. The complexity of the aroma was off the charts. I was first hit with the citrus and then the pine and finally the scent of farm fresh wet hops. Simply spectacular.  Taste: Again the complexities of the hops really stand out. The fruity hops present themselves first but the one works its way into the flavor all while there is a sense of freshness involved. A gorgeous symphony of the different hops which is complimented nicely by some bitterness and s very mild malt backbone. The beer is so strong with flavor but some how really invites you take another sip immediately.  Mouthfeel: Most IPA's this complex leave me feeling worn out. Not HopSlam. The intense flavors have more of a relaxing sensation as they wash over your tongue with just the right body, carbonation and bitterness.  Drinkability: A dangerously drinkable brew. I could easily have four or five without thinking.  This may be my new benchmark for IPA's. Well done Bell's!",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",Imperial IPA,98
287,17112,Mistofminn,4.72,"Finally...the last time this came around I was unsure of my hopheadedness...but not this time...  Pours a slightly hazy golden color into a pint glass. It has an ever so subtle tint of copper to it. A nice, two finger off-white head is produced with decent retention. It leaves some nice lacing all over the glass.  The nose is intense floral and citrus hops. I get lemon and grapefruit, orange and pineapple. This is some really good smelling stuff. I'm sure there is a strong malt backbone under all this, but I sure can't pick it up.  The taste is just like the nose, but this time I get a more defined piney and resiny hop note. Still the typical floral and citrus notes apply, even more so as the brew warms. An ever so subtle hint of alcohol is noticed near the finish, as is a spicey hop character that doesn't come into play anywhere else except the aftertaste.  Lighter than I expected, between light and medium. A nice bite from the hops, with an appropriate carbonation level. Drinkability is amazing.  This was totally worth the wait. I realized I made another mistake though...I should have bought much more than the two sixers that I did...because I'm already done with one and I'm not ready to wait another year to have this again!",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",Imperial IPA,98

287,17112,mbudner,4.92,"Batch 9470. Bottled 12/22/09. Poured into a pint glass.  A- Golden-orange with a nice 3-finger off-white head. There are HUGE bubbles (relative to other beers) that have not stopped rising to the service since I poured it roughly 2 minutes ago (very unique.)  S- Huge, juicy citrusy hops aroma. The major player is orange with a little bit of grapefruit mixed in and a wonderful sweetness, which I have to assume is imparted by the honey (duh). I feel like I have my have nuzzled in a handful of fresh hops. I also get some other fruity aromas that I would not associate with citrus; these seem a bit more floral.  T- Starts off a with a bit of sweet citrus quickly followed by a phenomenal dose of bitter hops. I get a bit of bubble gum in the finish as well (original bubbalicious, not juicy fruit.) There's a definite piney characteristic in the bitterness that I did not pick up on in the aroma. Basically, what I'm trying to say, is this beer is what it would taste like if you brought a sack full of fresh, glorious hops to a juice bar/smoothie stand and made them run it through their juicer (obviously the carbonation and honey are not accounted for in this scenario.) The honey in the finish really ties the whole thing together.  M- Coats the mouth without lingering in an unwanted fashion. Something really different is going on with the carbonation here as well (as I alluded to in the appearance section). The bubbles feel like they are popping on the tongue in a delayed fashion.  D- This section isn't even fair. Hopslam is one of the best drinking beers that I have ever had. Couple that with the fact that it is an astonishing 10% DIPA and there is no contest. I would put drinkability at 5 if it were a 6% IPA. The only negative (which I refused to adjust the score for as it is not a fault of Bell's, but rather the absurd distribution structure in Philadelphia) is the absurd price tag ($93...it retails for $60 at the brewery. Like I said, no bearing on score.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",Imperial IPA,98
287,17112,FeDUBBELFIST,4.87,"Served in a snifter. Finally.  A: Pours with a very white head, average size and decent retention. Streamers of carbonation from the bottom of the glass to the top. Very good lacing. The body has a beautiful clementine-orange color, medium value, rich & vibrant at the same time. While mostly clear, there is just a bit of haze which adds to the overall richness and appeal.  S & T: The HopSlam doesn't just meet DIPA flavor/aroma expectations, it blows them away. The hops are omnipresent. Huge grapefruit is backed by orange and other big, juicy citrusy fruits, plus a small touch of pine. Simply amazing. Additional suggestions of mango, peach, papaya and pineapple flavors/aromas. The malts are present enough but weren't allowed to inject any particular aromas.  M: The mouthfeel was spot on. Medium body with a mineral-ly gritty texture and a big lively carbonation that prickles the tongue and keeps the alcohol presence at bay.  D: Top-notch drinkability.

The Hopslam has a nice golden color to it. On draft it appeared to be a bit more hazy than out of the bottle.  S: Strong citrus/grapefruit aromas. The draft version smelled a little bit more piney to me. I can definitely detect the presence of honey.  T: A true hopbomb, yet very smooth and balanced. Nice citrus and some tropical flavors. Draft was a little more ""hoppy.""  MF: A little bit resiny, nice levels of carbonation.  D: What else can I say, it is Hopslam...Never know it was 10% abv, I could definitely sit here and drink a few of them, yet I want to savor these.

287,17112,generalnotsew,4.64,"Moment of truth has arrived for me. First timer here been waiting and wanting for months.  A: 2 finger head that isn't all that thick. Not fluffy like a lot of IPA's have. Color is lighter than I expected. It is like a harvest moon. Not sure if the floaties are normal here. They had just been put on the shelf 2 hours before I got it maybe the yeast not had the time to settle yet?  S: Smell is out of this world! I am getting some nice hops upfront with sweet citrus and honey in the background. Really reminds of a really sweet strawberry with a touch of tartness. Honestly I would compare the smell to strawberry pie more than anything. Never would have guessed what this would smell like.  T: Nice! Never been hit with hops, citrus and sweetness all at the same time. It all carries through to the end. And it does pack quite a hop punch. I was a tad worried the sweetness would dummy it down too much. Not much of the earthy and piney notes although they are there.  M: Pretty much flawless. Carbonated just right and a bit syrupy.  D: This is going to be one easy drinking tasty brew. That 10% will creep up fast though.  First impression is that it is well worth the wait. Can't wait to see what happens when it warms a bit. I do believe I may pop in next week and just pick up a case. Hopefully I can drink it before the hops fade. Too bad I don't know anyone personally I can share with. This is by far the best DIPA I have ever had!  Edit: I just have to bump up the taste score. Blake assured me that by the third one I would be worshiping this beer. And he was right.

I smell orange, grapefruit, papaya, mango, and lemon. Beneath the tropical aroma are sweet malts with a presence of honey. This smells fantastic.  T: While the nose is primarily an onslaught of hops, the palate provides everything the nose offers plus much more. All of the citric notes that were on the nose with some sourdough bread, some piney bitterness, and a sweet finish. Very complex and full of flavor. This is possibly the best DIPA out there.  MF: high carbonation, some stickiness  D: this has it all... a huge hop profile that is well balanced (read not overly bitter), a nice malt backbone that adds depth to the experience, and a dangerously well hidden high ABV.

A little carbonation and a little head, but not very much; gone after 45 seconds or so.  s - Smells strongly of citrus hops, as well as some light pine. Also got a little honey and sweet fruit here. Fantastic.  t - Great taste. At first it was not nearly as bitter as I was expecting. The more of it I drank, the more bitterness I tasted. Again, lots of citrus hops, pine, fruit, and honey.  m - Very little carbonation, light body, very smooth. For 10% ABV very easy to drink.  d - Very drinkable.

The bubbles are rising more slowly than normal it seems; almost like a reverse snowfall. Moderately thick lacing, except at the crown where the head originally died down, outline traces of smaller bubbles. Halfway down the glass the walls are painted with foam.  S - Heavy pine and hops. Ammonia? Sorry if that's harsh. Not impressed here.  T - Yum. Grapefruity citrus, pine, pepper, and a background sweetness that becomes more apparent as the beer warms. Obviously a huge hop explosion. More than I expected in this department, and my expectations were high.  M - Perfection, I love the way this feels. For as much carbonation as there is ascending in my glass, it's not so apparent when it first pours in which I like. Tastes and feels very fresh and crisp. Bubbles start to bite at your tongue after a few seconds, but until then, it's one of the smoothest beers I've come across.  D/Overall - Excellent beer here.

A bit too sweet smelling in my opinion.  T- Better than the smell. The hops are more present with a good amount of bitterness. A lot of grapefruit and other citrus fruits come to mind, blending well with a sweet backbone that can be attributed to the honey.  M- A solid medium-light body with good amounts of carbonation.

287,17112,SpinachEater,2.5,"Batch # 9471. I am not sure what is going on with this batch. My local store usually carries outdated beer so I had to double check the batch number on Bell's site to make sure this wasn't last years batch. It is fresh...packaged on 21 of Dec 09.  Huh...the reason why I checked was because this batch has no bitterness to it. None. I have been a huge fan of Hopslam but it seems like it has been getting weeker and weeker over the years. Twohearted is way more hoppier than what I am drinking right now. This seems to be roughly the same bitterness level as a Sam Adams (~32 IBU)...enough to dry the palate but not enough to produce any bite.  A few years back this beer was thick, dark orange, malty as fudge, and supercharged with IBUs. You seriously felt like the dude in the picture when the hops kicked your butt. Last year it seems like they backed off on the IBUs (perhaps because of the hops shortage?) but it still filled the room with hops aroma.  This year I get only a small hint of hops in the nose. It is mostly just honey that I smell. The taste is really sweet as well. Way too much honey and residual sweetness for my ideal DIPA. This is more of a mead than an IPA, for sure not a double IPA/Imperial IPA.  I am pretty disappointed with this batch. I honestly think that I have a batch that they forgot to add the bittering hops to. So sorry Bells...I wouldn't recommend Hopslam to anyone if they are looking for a good DIPA.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",Imperial IPA,98

The hops are the star here, but some of the sweet malt comes through, as well as the honey, pineapple, grapefruit, and oranges.  Medium bodied, nice carbonation, and almost insanely drinkable. The ten percent alcohol is so well hidden that I barely know it is present. I have been waiting for a long time to try this one, and was not disappointed.

287,17112,pmccallum86,4.67,"Bottled on 12/30/09, drank on 1/11/10, yum.  This glorious hop bomb pours a transparent amber golden color with a head that bubbles up quickly leaving lacing on the glass as it subsides.  The smell is absolutely terrific, rich hop citrus notes bombard the nose accompanied by a sweet crisp honey scent.  Taste is phenomenal, the hype on this beer is well justifed. The citrus and grapefruit hops bite first, followed by a wonderful sweet malt finish, definitely due to the honey. A first rate example of the DIPA style.  Mouthfeel is smooth, silky and crisp. Hard to improve on this section.  Very drinkable, almost too much so for a DIPA of this magnitude (10% ABV).",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",Imperial IPA,98
287,17112,kiddynamite920,4.77,"On tap at Union Jacks HopSlam night. MY LORD.  A: Poured into a 10 oz or so tulip glass. Beautiful copper/orange with a good fingers worth of head. Fresh HopSlam is something to behold.  S: Full of grapefruit and bitter hops. Very sweet and super hoppy, full of citrus and grassy notes. Smell is outstanding.  T: Wham. Flavor bomb. Huge grapefruit presence with a very nice sweet note. Honey, citrus, grapefruit, lemon, some sort of banana sweetness. Never had anything like this. Hops are so prevalent, but not dominating. Sweetness smooths everything out.  M: Not too thin, a bit thick actually possibly from the sweetness. Burns and numbs the tongue just enough, malts calm it all down.  D: I could drink this beer all day and all night. The rep from Bells was at the bar, we talked to him for a bit and he bought the 4 of us another round as well as giving us glasses that were meant for the bar.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",Imperial IPA,98
287,17112,Chronofied,4.4,"Rather chilled when poured, warmed slightly before tasted, in a pint glass.  Appearance - Very crisp and clear gold, to the point of being transluscent, consistent throughout. Visible but relaxed carbonation.  Smell - Immediate smell of grapefruit, followed by less pungent citrus and hops. A crisp, tart, refreshing aroma that promises hops and fruit.  Taste - Hops as soon as it hits your tongue, then makes way for a bubbly fruitiness with a precursor of honey, then the hops is back, stronger than ever for the finish. The hops bites a little, but not bad - at first. There is a citrus taste, like grapefruit or bitter lemon. When the hops comes back, it bites much more, and the aftertaste leaves bitter grapefruit lingering for quite some time.  Mouthfeel - Quite viscous, but stickier than expected. The label calls it a ""tongue-bruiser"" and it's pretty accurate; makes the beer feel more substantial.  Drinkability - In context, it is drinkable. Overly hoppy beers, as a general rule, are lower in drinkability, but the fruitiness and light honey in this beer, and the snappiness of it, make it easier to drink than many in the category. Still, I'd say a single bottle is about as much as I'd care to have in a sitting.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",Imperial IPA,98
287,17112,Pecorasc,4.52,"A biting, bitter, tongue bruiser of an ale. With a name like Hopslam, what did you expect?  Put the batch number into Bell's website: packaged on December 21, 2009. 20 days from bottling to my glass. 12 oz bottle poured into an oversized tulip glass.  A- Pours a deep gold with a tiny bit of haze. The haze was probably from the pour- there is some sediment in the bottle. Frothy white head with good retention, especially near sides of glass. Rorschach test-like lacing.  S- This is the freshest I have had this beer, and wow does it make a difference. Intense pine and citrus hop aroma. You know this one is going to beat up the palate before you take a sip. Bready malt and alcohol can barely be perceived behind the hop onslaught.  T- Very intense bitterness. Pine tree, grapefruit, orange, tangerine, and flower petals. Bitterness is balanced slightly by malt sweetness in the aftertaste. Leaves a tiny burning sensation in the chest... is that the alcohol or the IBUs??  M- Tough to describe the mouth feel when your palate just took a beating. Dry enough that it really accentuates the bitterness and hop flavor, yet big enough and sweet enough to handle the same.  D- At first it seems like I could drink this all night. Great hop flavors leave me craving more, but after one bottle, the reality of the alcohol content bring me back to earth.

Appearance: Poured a dark honey/copper color, left a 1-cm white head. Absolutely clear.  Smell: Hops right in your face! I smelled a slight grapefruit fruity smell with a lot of other citrus to it.  Taste: Again, hops in your face! I taste a lot of citrus, slight honey and a little malt.  Mouthtaste: On the back of the palate is where I get the bitterness of the hops. It was the only beer that I would drink that night, because it ruined my tastebuds for the rest of the night.  Drinkability: Very drinkable for me. Bigger the beer that better. 10% ABV hit the spot and made me hungery for more. Three of them goes into my cellar!  Notes: Had not had a good beer from Bells in a while.

The aroma is intensely hoppy, slap you in the face American hops, tangerine and apricot aromas come to my mind. The flavor is like the smell, very very hoppy with a solid yet not overpowering hop bitterness. There is a bit of sweet malt and a warming quality from the high ABV, although that is appreciated and is not harsh. The carbonation is medium and body medium as well. Overall an intense, well crafted, very enjoyable beer.

Its pungent and overpowering but just beckons my lips to the glass. The taste, the name says it all. Its as if all the hops off the vine gathered their might together to just pop me in the mouth.

287,17112,jampics2,4.52,"2010 vintage, batch 9471, bottled 12/21/09, sampled 17 days later. Each year, I get my first bottles of the season and rush home to sample.  12oz bottle poured into my Buckeye 'Bling Bling' 420 hop fest pint glass. Looks amazing - a clear golden orange beer with a white head that settles to a ring, nay, a halo around this angelic brew.  Smell is like nothing else. An incomparable citrus aroma dominates. It's pineapple and orange and a touch of pine sap. Amazing! When I put my nose right up to the beer, I get honey and a touch of alcohol as well.  Taste is wonderful. A beautiful boquet of hops presents a few different impressions on my palatte. The dominant taste is citrus hops - specifically grapefruit and some orange and pineapple. So, the late hop additions are kicking ass on this one, but there's more lurking beneath the surface. A tolerable but intense bitterness follows that can only be described as ""dank"". And there's a beautiful river of honey and light malt that runs beneath the bitter slam. Such a well rounded and enjoyable beer - I think Bells nailed the fact that honey can provide a bit of depth to compliment the grain bill and help to balance things. Mild alcohol in the aftertaste, but most is hidden by the hops. Fantastic.  I'm scoring the mouthfeel a bit short of perfection due to the fact it doesn't exactly sparkle and dance across the tongue. But the viscosity is perfect for the style, not watery as much as light. Carbonation is medium for the style, not prickly and also not too creamy. Well done.  Finally, the toughest aspect to rate for this beer, drinkability. This beer is so hoppy, sticky, and strong that it can be intimidating. It's not a beer that ""goes down easy"". It's more that there's SO much flavor that you want to sip and savor, and I don't think there's anything wrong with that. When I think about drinkable beers, this one doesn't get top billing in my memory, but it is such a joy - not exceptional but certainly a lot better than average.  I wish Hopslam day was every year. This is truly a world-class beer. Just like some of the most famed figures in history, this beer isn't perfect. But it's so memorable (especially when this fresh) that it deserves it's place on any list of legendary American beers.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",Imperial IPA,98

Beer is dark yellow and hazy (maybe from sediment), carbonation moderate and a moderate white head of small and medium bubbles forms, lots of lacing on the glass.  Aroma is mostly malt with a secondary aroma of some hops. It smells sweet, overall good.  This beer is still quite the hop bomb. Full bodied, great hop flavor in the midpalate, a slight aftertaste. There is a nice malt flavor in the front of the mouth. Second taste, rather cleansing. I really am enjoying this beer. The aftertaste grows as you drink, does not really affect drinkability.

S- With a name like Hopslam, there is one thing you can expect, hops. And that is what you get, plenty of hops. Also there is that touch of honey with a little bit of the alcohol peaking through but nothing terrible.  T- It's is like I just bit into a hop cone. With a nice bit of bitterness to follow. Like the label says, there is some honey which I think helps give it a touch of sweetness to compliment the hops. I can get a little bit of the alcohol when I hold the beer in my mouth for a while.  M- Just a small amount of bitterness and a touch of sweetness make for a pretty good beer. A fair amount of carbonation, this is a nice medium bodied beer.  D- For being a pretty good beer, I could have a few of these. It doesn't kill the taste buds like some DIPAs.

I have some 2009's sitting up too. I'll hang on to them.  What's not perfect here? It's pretty rich and strong, so you can only drink so much. It's too expensive. It's best to wait a year or two before you drink it. These are all big negatives! It's just TOO good. These are pretty murky, even after almost two years. Of course I will be sure to seek out more when it becomes available (in February?). This may be my favorite brew. Definitely in the top few.  January 18, 2022 My taste has changed in 12 years. While this is still great, I'm not sure it's even the same ale. It's in a can now, and I wouldn't consider aging it (I aged an IPA?). Nice color, lacing. Aroma isn't that strong as isn't the taste, but it has a certain burn and obvious extra strength that are more than redeeming.

287,17112,alysmith4,4.84,"I think this is my favorite beer of all time. I'm not sure if it's because it's released only once a year, or if it's because it really is so good. I also can't tell if I'd get sick of it if I was able to have it all the time, or if part of it's appeal is because of it's limit.  Anyway, it poured well - typical IPA color with a small, half-inch head. Smell is out of this world! It smells like the freshest, hoppiest juice I have ever experienced. This is what I imagine raw hops would taste like if you pressed them and drank them. And if I thought the smell was outstanding, the taste is even more ridiculous! So fresh and delicious! It takes a minute to get used to as the taste can be overwhelming at first, which is probably a good thing at 10% ABV.

This beer is really hoppy, which is great. There is a subtle honey flavor, which adds a hint of sweetness, but not too much. It is a nice balance to the citrus flavor of the hops. Each sip is an explosion of hops that pelt the tongue but that is a good thing. It finishes with the sweetness of the honey and the nice bitter finish of the hops.

There's a nice amount of pine in there as well. The sweetness is more developed than with the aroma and serves as a nice counterbalance to the bitterness of the hops. Not sure if it's the honey or the malt. Whatever it is, the taste is absolutely phenomenal. A nice dry finish leaves me refreshed yet wanting more. It's easy to forget this is 10% ABV as it's very drinkable. I think Hopslam is an appropriate name. I could see myself slamming these back all night.

The taste is similar to the smell in that it is well balanced with an assertive hop character, perhaps a bit mellowed out with time.

287,17112,chinabeergeek,4.15,"this poor bottle had a protracted wait, as it took FOREVER for my trade with jnn4v to come through (was originally expecting arrival in early march, but ended up having to wait until MID-MAY). some of his reasons were understandable, some not as much. supposedly it was kept in the fridge most of the time though.  12oz bottle w batch code 8913. tasted in mid/late may 2009.  orangey honey amber. slightly hazy despite decanting. 1.5-finger foamy off-white head, gradually fades to constant thin wispy layer. great lacing, curtain-like in the 2nd half.  aroma: piney, citrus rind hops, still decently fresh, with citrus fruit notes, although starting to get dull and resinous. caramelized malt underneath but focus remain on the hops, even now.  taste: still quite hoppy and relatively fresh, just not uber-fresh like i remember from the tap. a bit more towards the resinous side of the spectrum, with pine and citrus rind, and less of the floral and citrus zest characters. doesn't blend as well with the honey and caramelized malt as a result, the way the fresh draft version did. moderate to boldly bitter, with resinous tones. hints of apple esters.  medium body, smooth, almost syrupy. punctuated by resinous astringency. prickly, moderate carbonation helps with creamy texture.  part of this score will be influenced by my impressions of the draft keg i had multiple samples of at EBF 09. one of the highlights of that event, actually.  a shame that the hops are so fragile. will have to seek a more timely trade next year.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",Imperial IPA,98

287,17112,jlindros,4.12,"Thanks to COBeerBuff for this gem. Poured from bottle into oversized snifter.  A: Golden orange amber copper color, slight reddish hue, very hazy, slight head that slowly fades.  N: Nose has some nice noble hops, some floral and grassy aromas, slight citrus, an interesting crystal malt and touch of honey finish off the light nose  T: Starts pretty sweet, some crystal malt but lots of honey, a grassy floral hops taste adds more character, a slight spicey and chewy hop, the sweetness and honey is very prevalent, a very slight alcohol as it hides it pretty well, it has a somewhat candy bar taste with the sweet honey, caramel malts, and floral chewy hops which build the more I drink  M: A little chewy and stick, pretty light otherwise, light carbonation, a little creamy  F: It gets pretty bitter but not huge. It starts sweet and honey taste but finishes pretty dry. The bitter hops fade pretty quickly leaving the candy bar taste as well as a biscuity malt taste and slight earthiness making it pretty drinkable, and nice fresh hop taste on the finish as well. It also seems to leave a metallic taste in the mouth  Final thoughts: This beer seems to be pretty highly acclaimed but I'm a little disappointed. Its a pretty big hop bomb with a slight malt base and lots of sweet honey. The candybar taste adds a nice touch but its a little too much honey and sweet taste for me, and the hops don't come through the way I would have expected.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",Imperial IPA,98

S: Faint alcohol sweetness with a little bit of hops and roses.  T: An unexpected sweetness up front, followed by tons of hops. Some grapefruit notes, with a lingering bitter finish.  M: Medium body with moderate to light carbonation. A little syrupy, but characteristic for a double IPA.

287,17112,pentathlete,4.57,"Pours into the goblet with a slightly hazy gold and a thick foam. The tiny tight bubbles are layered with a few larger ones. They collapse from nearly an inch thick to an eighth inch table. Good, but noting exceptional.  Smell is citrus hop dominated with that mead-like honey aroma floating underneath. The taste matches the smell perfectly, with a strong hop bite from start to the startlingly meadish finish. (It does have kind of a hoppy mead flavor, like a braggot, but overblended with an IPA.)  I love the way this feels, the malts surround the palate and the hops strike like a sword on the tongue. The honey notes linger for a very long finish.  I've had this on draft and have had many bottles. It never ceases to shock me to find that I have quaffed a 12 oz brew clocking in at 10% in less than five minutes. It is that drinkable.

287,17112,rfgetz,4.57,"A: Orangy-Amber in color. Slightly cloudy. Thin head, good lacing.  S: Citrusy hops (orange, grapefruit) and sweet honey  T: Complex yet perfectly balanced. First taste is sweet clover honey moving into the citrus (grapefruit, lemon) with a bitter zing to follow. Finished amazingly clean and dry.  M: Medium-heavy body. good carbonation that doesnt get in the way but helps aide in the balance. slightly viscous and oily without being sticky.  D: Amazingly complex yet balanced brew. A lot of extreme flavors in here that do not overpower, yet they compliment eachother exceptionally well.  Notes: Obviously out of season, but that doesnt diminish the overall excellent quality of this beer. It's a different animal.  Update 1: Had a fresh bottle in February of 2010. Very different hop bitterness obviously but still earns the marks from its previous sampling.  Update 2: Had on draft for the first time on 1/26/11. Still an exceptional beer - A little less honey in the taste due to the uber freshness of the hops and also slightly lighter body but still smooth and oily.

Had a batch number code on back label that you can look up on the web. This one is from 12/21/09 so fresh. It was a slightly hazy golden honey color with light carb bubbles. It had a good sized white head that settled into a thick collar and central wisps. Good sliding lace with some sticky spots.  The aroma was exceptional. Grapefruit, citric and pine hops dominating up-front with a great honey sweet malt back. Is that pineapple as well? Great balance. Very pleasing. The taste followed the aroma. Starts out sweet from the honey and then the hops build to a great hoppy finish. Not sure I'd call it a hopslam but still excellent. Mouthfeel is medium with good carb levels and great balance. Nice after-taste.  Overall, an excellent ADIAP that is worthy of the rank and hype. Most highly recommend. Great non-bitter hop aroma and flavor that shows excellent balance with the honey tinged malt. Very easy drinker. Just wish it was easier to get some.

This beer pours a very light color with nice head and immediate floral and hop nose without even getting close the the glass.  Taste is not as strong in the hop character as others, but that is OK.

It's a beautiful orange hue that is nicely transparent with a two finger white head.  Big hoppy aromas of all sort, citrus, piney, earthy followed by the honey and some caramel in the background. I can only imagine how aromatic this would be when fresh.  The citrus hops are the most dominant of all the flavors with grapefruit leading the way. While drinking this i continued to have the sense that I was eating a ruby red grapefruit. It was still quite well balanced between the sweetness and the hoppiness. There is some burning alcohol flavors but they are not unpleasant.  In terms of drinkability I could easily put back a few of these despite the high abv.

S: At first whiff, I get white grapefruit juice, orange blossom, honey, and a hint of the sea.  T: The flavors start with bitter lemon rind, then evolve into black tea with vanilla, creme fraiche, and a slight herbal funk. The bitter and sweet flavors seem to flip flop several times, giving it a long and complex finish.  M: This is weighty and viscous, but a little slippery as well. The finish is dry, but not bone.  D: A yummy brew. I think that the honey, which is often overlooked, blanaces the bitter hops and smooths out the mouthfeel.  Notes: This review is for a bottle that some would say was past its prime. I do remember more sweetness in the flavor and smoothness in the finish when I had it on tap back in February. I remember being very, very impressed.

Good appearance for a DIPA, but not a world-beater.  S: The aroma, however, is pretty awesome. The honey is detectable as a background element, but the main attractions are the juicy citrus and tropical fruit aromas that explode out of my glass.  T&M: Tons of tropical fruit, citrus, and slightly piney hop flavors here. Absolutely explosive flavor, even now in June. A delicate sweetness from the honey is what really masks the alcohol to me. The maltiness is lightly sweet and cookie-like, though it serves as a light background for the insane hop flavor. The finish is long, drying, and makes me salivate for more. Body is medium to full with a silky feel that's not syrupy or overly resinous and sticky. Very smooth feel.  D: By far the most drinkable DIPA I've had. In fact, this would be quaffable for a standard IPA. Despite its 10% ABV, this beer goes down incredibly easily. Hopslam satisfies hopheads, but will also likely convert many ""non-believers"" to the incredible potential of highly hopped beers.

T: It's certainly not as dominatingly bitter as I expected, but the flavor is still very nice! The malt backbone is very hidden, which is fine by me.

287,17112,KBoudreau66,4.55,"Received a 6 pack plus 2 via trade with Kiefdog(an excellent trader I may add).  Poured into a snifter. Has a beautiful looking dark orange color with a golden tint. About one finger of slightly off white head that dissipates into a thin layer that will last throughout. This brew left an impressive looking thin layer of soapy lacing down the entire glass.  The nose consists of piney, citrus hops up front with an enticing sweet honey aroma that compliments the hops. There are hints of bready malts in the undertone. Alcohol phenols will be present, but well hidden for a big DIPA with a strong 10% ABV.  Wow... That's the first thought that came to my mind as this beer hit my tongue. It has the strong hop profile that I expect from a DIPA; however, this brew manages to avoid an overpowering bitterness and replace that somewhat mundane taste with an admirable sweet honey, and bready malt flavor.  The mouthfeel is creamy and smooth yet has a light carbonation that creates an excellent feel on the pallet.  I know that it is controversial to rate a DIPA, or any IPA for that matter that may or may not have a hop profile that has been deemed ""faded"". Some BA's have argued that it would be unfair to rate a DIPA/IPA that is considered faded. However, I personally feel that this should only hold true for beers that could be rated unfairly based on that fact alone. Although Hopslam may be considered faded at this point, I still saw past that and thoroughly enjoyed it. IMO this brew still had a strong hop profile, albeit, faded, and although other BA's may disagree with this, I still feel that a potentially ""faded"" Hopslam was still one of the best DIPA's I have managed to get my hands on, and would like to get my hands on again ASAP(doesn't distribute to Massachusetts).",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",Imperial IPA,98

A sticky, curvy lace is revealed as the froth slowly drifts away, leaving a thick covering atop. Subdued and pleasant citrusy hops float to the nose. Tastes fruity, citrusy and malty upfront with the hops coming at the end, adding to, and not overpowering the palate. Spice and pine exist, as does some butterscotch or other such candy. The honey comes in and adds a nice texture to the whole experience. Equanimity is achieved across the board. The alcohol heat bites at the throat just a bit, but is welcomed, not at all bothersome, but demands care. The mouth-feel is a perfect medium, as it doesn't weigh you down; demands sipping, but also has a certain hint of fluff that allows you stay in for the long haul.

287,17112,Jmoore50,4.68,"So I got this gem from a buddy who got it in a trade. Saying that much, it makes the bottle somewhat old. It was in the 8911 batch which was bottled on January 20 2009. This will make a difference to my reviewing, I am sure.  The appearance is amazing. The beautiful golden amber color is stunning to look at. It pours smooth, and surprisingly enough it is somewhat translucent for being ten percent. It pours with a great two finger sticky white head that just sticks around. When you drink the brew the head just clings to all parts of the glass, just holding on for dear life.  The smell is great. Has a great honey smell that resonates with the nostrils. Has a great hop character that also brings out a citrus smell that is stunning.  The taste is awesome. The thing about this review is that I taste the amazing-ness that is this brew, but I also can taste the potential for a perfect brew. I wish I had a fresh one, maybe next year. Really amazing though, the citrus hops gives such a great mouthfeel, its unreal.  When drinking this brew, just count your blessings. This thing makes me believe in brewery perfection. The mouthfeel is awesome, just outstanding. The palate is hit with the hops bitterness but its smoothed out by the honey taste. Just overall mind blowing. I could drink this until I exploded. There is a reason it has gotten such high reviews and so much press. Lovely, absolutely lovely. J",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",Imperial IPA,98
287,17112,WPRebelFan,4.33,"Batch #8907 poured into a pint glass  Appearance: Poured light amber with a white fluffy head. A good deal of lacing included.  Smell: Strong citrus and grapefruit notes with a bit of floral.  Taste: Grapefruit is obvious here, along with a ton of hops! And with just the right amount of honey to balance it all out.  Mouthfeel: Light carbonation with a crisp, clean finish.  Drinkability: Very drinkable and horribly refreshing.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",Imperial IPA,98
287,17112,Metalmonk,4.7,"Thanks to BDLbrewster for hooking me up with a couple bottles of this. A fairly elusive beer for me, as the timing has never been right for me to score it. Thanks dude!  Looks the quintessential double IPA: hazed sunset/copper/gold, not as much rust tint as some others in the style. Creamy head begins big and fluffy, and leaves a lot of lace as it thins out. Head never totally disappears.  Aroma is fantastic, a perfect mingling of sticky pine elements and fresh citrus. Big orange burst meets the smell of a pine forest after a fresh rain. A mere hint of alcohol, at best, and that signals good things for the flavor (ie. not too boozy, I hope...)  Sure enough, the 10% alcohol is incredibly well incorporated in the flavor, giving only a slightly medicinal edge to a flavor that is top-notch in its style category. Taste favors fresh orange slices, grapefruit peel, pine resin, orange-blossom honey, fresh-cut grass. Mild saltiness in the finish, which keeps the citrus riding high. Bitterness comes with depth and spreads out over a variety of levels and taste impressions. Malt offers the perfect balance, not too much or too little, lightly toasted vibe, laying out a clean earthy/sweet base for the hops to do their thing.  As with every other aspect of Hopslam, its texture is just about perfect. Round and creamy, yet with just enough bite from the bubbles. Not quite heavy in body, having some buoyancy in the medium-bodied area of the spectrum. But also somehow pretty syrupy, which is partly the big flavor itself giving the impression of big weight.  Love the label, which pretty much says it all, although this isn't one of those hop-drenched experiences that wipes out the tastebuds for a whole day (hi Hopsickle!). You'll get up from getting slammed by mutant hops only wanting more. Go ahead, indulge. Drinkable? From where I'm sitting, oh hell yeah.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",Imperial IPA,98
287,17112,DavoleBomb,4.81,"Poured into a snifter.  3.5 A: Opaque darkish orange color. One finger of creamy head has surprisingly bad retention but leaves lots of lacing. Must be the 10% ABV, though plenty of other big IPAs have pulled it off.  5.0 S: Big burst of citrus hops. Grapefruit, pineapple, and orange. There's a good pungency to it that I just can't get enough of.  5.0 T: Tons of fruity and piney hop flavor. The perceived sweetness in the fruitiness is thankfully balanced out with a strong bitter backbone to make this one hell of a sipper. The alcohol is essentially non-existent. The malts play a supporting role and do their job without demanding too much credit.  4.0 M: Medium body. Good carbonation, which is a bit surprising considering the lack of head (or perhaps the lack of head is why there is good carbonation). Bitter and sweet finish and aftertaste. I prefer a shitload of hops AND a good creamy body for a DIPA, but the creamy body is not to be found.  5.0 D: I am so glad I finally got to try this beer.

The taste is a nice hoppy feeling, not overwhelming. Mouthfeel is a good taste with the 10% abv not being strong to overtake the taste. The drinkability is good enough that I can drink a few more Hopslams now. Nice. Overall, a good beer to enjoy.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",Imperial IPA,98
287,17112,CMitchell,3.55,"Served in a Pilsner Glass. Typed in batch # on Bell's website and found it was was packaged on January 6, 2009. (I did this after tasting the beer).  A: Golden, orange and slightly hazy, nice white head that disappeared after a few minutes (and sips)  S: Nice and hoppy, not quite the punch of hops I was expecting. Slight pine and citrus, with some flower notes.  T&M: Slightly malty, some honey notes, sticky with hops, but again does not live up to the name Hopslam.  D: I would try this again, but only if I knew it was fresh. Was disappointed and slightly pissed that this beer is 5 plus months old.  If you're going to take the time to stamp the bottle with a number, might as well stamp the freaking date. . .or is this just a ploy to hide the freshness of the beer to sell more. . . .",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",Imperial IPA,98
287,17112,MithosYggdrasil,4.37,"I've been told that this beer is very susceptible to going bad if it sits on the shelf at the liquor store for too long. Thankfully, I was able to get a fresh 12oz bottle and thoroughly enjoy it. It's a shame I bought but a single 12oz bottle of it!  Appearance: Upon being completely poured, I noted a foggy golden orange color as well as a thin head resembling flour.  Smell: Notable hop presence, pineapple, pine, honey and caramel all reside in the smell.  Taste: Bitter and hoppy with the flavor matching up to the aroma. This is an Imperial IPA, alright!  Mouthfeel: Thick, great hoppiness that slams you right frm the get go and somewhat heavy. Moderate carbonation, and the alcohol is hidden quite well.  Drinkability: It's incredible tasting and I'm sure if you're a hophead, you'll love it.

287,17112,thryn,4.8,"I love HopSlam. I love it fresh, and I love it now, nearly five months later. Bottled Jan. 5, 2009.  It's a golden honey-amber color, slightly cloudy, with a finger of eggshell-colored head that drops to a thin but resilient layer of foam atop the brew. Sticky lace throughout.  Nose is all citrusy and piney hops, with some malt and honey sweetness to back it up.  It's definitely mellower than it was fresh, and I'm giving it a five because I know how killer it is fresh. Even, now, it's a 4.5 easy. The pine and citrus notes of the hops cut through, the honey makes an appearance, and then it finishes nicely bitter. Alcohol is not very forward at all.  A solidly medium body -- not too heavy and decent carbonation makes it refreshing in warmer weather.  I bought a case this year, if that tells you anything about drinkability. The only reason there is any left is that I was saving some for when my friend vsited last week ... and then I bought another sixer.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",Imperial IPA,98
287,17112,semihobo,4.15,"From batch 8911, bottled in January 09. Already had the first four from the pack.  Pours with a solid ginger-peach head, beautifully minute creamy bubbles, vigorous bubbling. Great lacing.  Smell is wonderful, grapefruit candy and flowers, a fresh spring rain, with a bit of pine resin. It's all there.  Very balanced taste. You have the delicate flavor of hops vs. a moderately (for the style) bitter finish, the bitterness swallowing up the alcohol, and an adequate malt presence that starts sweet before heading off to biscuit land. Nice pine, resin, and citrus. Not overboard on the bitterness or resin. Smooth out of the fridge, less so as it warmed. After having a few of these, I feel comfortable saying this: drink this one a little colder than you would think is appropriate... you'll be rewarded.  Creamy mouthfeel, gentle carbonation. Finish is a little too sticky and prolonged.  Lived up to most of the hype -- this is tasty. Have felt differently as I've worked my way through the six pack, from time to time, but very nuanced and quite drinkable. As regards the debate about drinking Hopslam as fresh as possible... I can't say anything about 2 days vs. 2 months but 2 months vs. 4 months did not show any deterioration. $17.99 for a 6 pack after shopping around though... that is a lot of money.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",Imperial IPA,98

Hops linger.  D: Great for a slow sipping beer.  Solid atmosphere. Nice appearance and sharp, profound nose. Flavor is not complex, but is 'full'. . . the subtle sweetness adds a bit, though.

287,17112,beerindex,2.81,"Pours a hazy orange-brown color (almost cider-like) with a modest and quickly fleeting white head that left a respectable lace behind. Smell though was this beer's best selling point. The aroma was heavenly, perhaps the best I've come across of any beer. The smell was of citrus fruits, mostly lemon and pineapple, with a bit of honey too.  With respect to the beer's taste, it wasn't anything to write home about. I picked up a bottle because it is cheap and local, and most people seem to love it. As much of a hops fan as I am, this simply didn't do anything for me. I couldn't detect the honey it was supposedly brewed with. Instead, it had an odd medicinal sort of taste that was bitter in a way I don't expect with this style.  Not something I'd care to drink again, especially when Bell's has much better beers in their line-up, and even better locals brews exist (see: most stuff from Founders).",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",Imperial IPA,98

287,17112,PerzentRizen,4.85,"Poured into a Duvel glass around 48 degrees this beer is copper to dark straw in color. The head is white and frothy and the lacing resides for the entire session. This is around the 27th Hopslam I've had - but never reveiwed it until now. I know the hops have faded from when I first had it and I know the progression that this beer takes over a three month period.  The aroma is an amazing bouquet of floral hops, intense honey-like malt, and a grapefruit citrus smell that begs for a sip. Amazing!!!  The flavor is intense. There is an overwhelming of the senses as the hops kick your tongue's ass. The malt backs it up by balancing the flavors nicely. The alcohol is there but makes a small appearance compared to the rest of the flavors. Hops come back to recede to malt sweetness - probably impacted by the honey.  The mouthfeel is full and viscous. It's a bit more than I was expecting but great non-the-less. I love a nice round feel from my double IPA's and this one does not dissapoint.  Some beers at 10% with this much flavor would push you away rather than suck you in but I've had almost 30 of these and I'm ready for more!

Nice vibrant orange color, a bit richer and deeper than the first pour. Little carbonation, its a cask. Lovely floral and citrus hop aroma. This second pint was far better in the hop flavor department. I get a much more pronounced bitterness, but I think the honey sweetness helps balance it out. Also make is incredible easy to drink. Too easy really. I think the middle of this cask was amazing, but also a testament to how cask settle, there is definitely a sweet spot.

Fruity esters also on the nose. T/M: Bready, toasted malts. Hops are earthy and citrusy (grapefruit zest comes to mind). A kick of florals in the sip as well. Medium to full-bodied, creamy mouthfeel.

287,17112,callmescraps,4.65,"Got this one kind of magically. A little elf told me of a store where it existed in SoCal. So even though it's not super-fresh, I'm super-amped.  Appearance - A nice deep copper color. About an inch of soapy off-white head. Great lacing.  Smell - Oooh! Nice citrus hops right up front. Lots of grapefruit, and even some mango. Real nice citrus. Maybe apricot? A tiny hint of caramel malt on the back, but just a hint. Can only imagine the punch when fresh.  Taste - Wow. Hot damn. That is some good shit. Lots of nice citrus up front. The apricot/mango really comes with it. Pineapple? Yes, pineapple. I think I can pick up on the honey. It's pretty sweet, but bitterness of the hops really mellow it out. Not much malt (a good thing in my book). No hint of the booze. Just incredibly well balanced. The taste lingers hauntingly.  Mouthfeel - Very nice. A little thin perhaps. I was expecting a little more thickness and syrup.  Drinkability - Very good. It's a little on the sweet side, but that hop bitter balances it well. The high abv is absolutely nowhere to be seen. It would be very easy to get into trouble with these.  Wow. That was an absolutely fantastic beer. It's only the second DIPA the lady-friend has ever really liked. The first? Pliny the Younger.

S - Sweet citrus, more pineapple than grapefruit, faint spices, sort of reminds me of the liqueur Cuarenta y Tres.  T - Very potent honey flavor here that sweetens and caps the myriad citrus flavors present. The hop bite is almost more potent in the finish than the initial flavor.

287,17112,photomike,3.82,"I realize this bottle is several months old, so read this review with that in mind. Hey, people want to know what its like with a little age on it, right?!  Will re-review next year when fresh.  Pours a golden yellow with a surprisingly unimpressive head. Not a lot of lacing, and kinda weak retention.  Smell is very sweet tropical fruit and a good amount citrusy hops.  Taste is, as I feared, very sweet. Honey sweetness with major tropical fruits and almost-sickly malts. It has that sort of taste that oldish, huge IPAs tend to have where you can tell the hops you taste are just a shell of what they were before. The nice, hoppy aroma does not match up with the taste, and it is ultimately disappointing. The flavors that are here are nice though; the sweetness is a bit overpowering, but that is mostly detrimental to this beers drinkability rather than its flavor.  Mouthfeel is really nice. Slick and smooth, medium bodied and well carbonated. A slight alcohol burn gives up the otherwise very well hidden ABV.  Too sweet to drink too much for me.  Overall, I'm sure this is a MUCH better beer fresh, but I can't exactly get my hands on a fresh bottle for a little while. Given the lack of availability where I live, I really have to search it out. Even at its current age, it is an above average DIPA, but as it stands, I will take a Pliny 98 times out of 100 over this.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",Imperial IPA,98

Nice golden rusty amber color with a little offwhite head that faded away pretty quickly. Lacing sticks lightly to the sides of the glass. I have always liked the look of this beer.  S- Nice big fruity hop nose from the get go (pineapple). Smells a little sweet which I can tell is from the honey. Also, a slight biscuity malty smell.  T- This still after a couple of years of having it taste like it was made from some other wonderful place and not Bells! Nice tart and hop bite to it leaving a sweet pineapple taste rushing toward a honey biscuity finish. The hops in this are bitter at first but seem to calm down before it goes down. I like the taste of this beer a lot.  M- This has a nice medium to heavier mouthfeel to it. Good carbination lets the beer slide over the tounge leaving a nice hoppy resin over the tounge. This beer overall has a lot of what I look for in the mouthfeel.  D- I could drink this all day long if I had the chance.

287,17112,bulletrain76,3.88,"12oz bottle, batch 8907. Mostly clear deep gold-orange color with a small white head that leaves some spotty lace. Citrus, melon rind, alcohol, sweet honey, and spicy herbal hop aroma. Quite sweet, with a touch of honey and bread. Some fruity, citrucy hop flavor and a finish that almost gets dry and bitter until the sweetness comes back in and sticks to the back of the tongue. Medium bodied and rather light feel overall, which helps to partially mitigate the sweetness. This could use either a ton more hops, or a much dryer finish. I'll stick to two hearted.  Rerate: Same batch, a couple more bottles have been mused over. Impressions: The aroma is a nice citric-fruity hop and sweet honey malt combo, though it's a bit light for a double IPA. The flavor, while still falling more on the sweet side, is dryer than I had previously thought. It's not the residual sugar so much as the lack of stronger bittering hops that set the balance this way. I think that the fruity hop flavor and more modest bitterness combine to give a sweet, fruity overall impression. It is growing on me. A balanced and very drinkable IIPA. The body is about as light as I can imagine a 10%abv beer being. If it weren't for the alcohol presence, this could be almost a regular IPA. While I more intense and complex overall hop character could transform this beer into something amazing, it is still enjoyable and deserves a couple more points. Rerate: on tap at Brickskeller. More bitterness and assertive hop flavors, still very drinkable. Freshness seems to be the world in this beer.

What a great & well-balanced palate consisting of the same grassy hops, honey, and citrus fruit or melon, like a combination of grapefruit and honeydew, but very faint, just enough of the sweetness to offset the hop bitterness.  Medium in body with a slightly aggressive carbonation character, but also a bit dry.  Excellent brew, and the abv is absolutely hidden in the palate characteristics of this well-balanced ""ale"".

Smell: Slightly toasted malt backbone supports strongly grassy and grapefruity hops with a bit of sweetness reminiscent of honey.  Taste/Mouthfeel: Taste is really well-balanced for the style. Sweet ruby red grapefruit pairs with a grassy, bitter hoppiness and honey-sweet maltiness that's a little toasty. Mouthfeel is filling, light and refreshing, and a stick film covers the palate after drinking. Alcohol is only slightly present in the aftertaste.  Drinkability: Really high.

287,17112,eberkman,4.57,"Pours a brilliant, glowing, crystalline golden orange -- the hue of a brand new penny with an incredibly delicate look to it. Cream-colored head that didn't froth up much and reduced to a ring and surface flotsam in moments -- I would have liked more head volume and stickiness, but what a beautiful body to the liquid itself. The second pour is somewhat darker with more haziness, but still gorgeous.  Unbelievably fragrant nose of, dare I say, pineapple? At first I detected pine needles and luscious ruby-red grapefruit, but the unique, inviting pineapple notes seem to take control.  The taste is ridiculously smooth for the style -- nice. honeystung sweetness from the fruity hops giving way to a powerful but not overwhelming or astringent hoppiness from the more bitter little cones. Hoppy as hell but not particularly bitter.  Mouthfeel is delicate with a small bite -- not as much carbonation as I'd expect. Some real oiliness from the hops, but overall a suprisingly light-bodied beer.  This is 10 percent? Well I'd better be careful because you sure as heck don't taste it. I'd love more of these.  Really a classic -- the DIPA I've been looking for. I wish I had some more of these. When I was in Michigan in April, they were nowhere to be found -- they went that fast.

287,17112,akahn,4.38,"(Sent in the mail from a co-worker who lives in D.C. Thanks dude.)  Golden amber honey tone with thick luscious head (hard pour). The head lasts, lots of carbonation floating up.  Rich, big resinous nose, with an ample hit of sweetness.  On the palate the sweetness leads -- the honey flavor is not pronounced but I think it's there. Sweetness immediately gives way to lively bitterness. Assertive but not overpowering. Hoppy prickles mesh with small bubbles that evaporate from the palate.  Very smooth and nuanced mouthfeel. Broad and all-encompassing; rich but not cloying.  Dangerously drinkable -- I had no idea this was 10% until I checked the label.  Glad I had a chance to sample this one. Imperial IPA is not my favorite style, but this is a very nice one.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",Imperial IPA,98
287,17112,lordofthewiens,4.5,"I can't get this beer in Maine, but did find it on a trip to Tampa. It certainly lives up to it's reputation. In a pint glass it has that slightly hazy orange color I expect from IIPAs. The aroma is just wonderful, a nice balance of sweet honey and tart citrus. Taste followed form, sweet malt and grapefruit. A nicely balanced, incredibly smooth beer. The alcohol is well-hidden, but I think two of these at a time are my limit.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",Imperial IPA,98
287,17112,John_M,4.22,"Reviewed this previously, but not out of the bottle.  The beer pours the prototypical peachy orange DIPA color, with good head retention and lacing. With several months of bottle age, this beer has become positively exotic on the nose, displaying mandarin orange, grapefruit, cherry and even cotton candy. There is much more of a tropical fruit flavor to the aroma then there was when it was first released (or the times I've had it on tap), and I confess it's really quite attractive. The flavors on the palate replicate the nose, and I have to say that even after several months in the bottle, this is still an absolutely delicious beer. The beer comes across as more of a strong ale now, but with a decidedly noticeable underlying hoppy presence. It's a bit sweeter and maltier tasting then it once was, but with enough hops to still carry the day and keep it from tasting overly heavy or tiring on the palate. I suspect that won't last much longer however, which is why I'm glad I'm down to my last couple of bottles. Mouthfeel is still medium to full bodied, though it has an underlying richness I didn't get before. Drinkability is the only area where this beer seems to have been noticeably hurt by the extra bottle age. The alcohol is now showing a bit, and the increasing sweetness is also a detraction/distraction.  Granted, this beer is absolutely at its best when super fresh, but even after 2 or 3 months of bottle age, it is still an impressive beer... a very solid DIPA.  Edit from 1/21/11. Sampled very fresh bottle the other day. Would raise drinkability to 5, but would otherwise keep everything else the same. Fresh HS is dangerously drinkable... the beer comes across as very light, with the honey flavor in this beer masking the alchohol completely. It's the sort of beer you almost want to keep on drinking till you're comatose.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",Imperial IPA,98
287,17112,aglose45,4.6,"Poured from a bottle during an Imperial IPA ""competition""; faced off against DFH 90 Minute IPA.  A: Light copper to dark yellow, some goodies floating around in the beer. Off-white/ yellow-cream head. Good head retention, and great lacing left on the glass.  S: PINEAPPLE with a bit of honey sweetness. Picked up some other citrus flavors, orange and lemon, as well. In addition to the citrus bang I have already listed, I was pleasantly surprised to pick up some grapefruit too! Man, I love citrus hops in my IPA's/ IIPA's...  M: Light to medium bodied. There was some stickiness/ oiliness from the hops. Carbonation is great - lower which allows for more surface area of beer (flavor) hitting your taste buds.  D: If I was left with one beer in this world, and this was it, I would be a very happy man.

287,17112,pweis909,3.43,"Bottle, batch # 8912, which was born of Jan 13, according to the website. So, over three months. The beer is underwhelming. Aroma is hoppy, possibly a little solventy/resiny. Taste is sweet, almost to the point of cloying. There is a bitter grapefruit rind finish. I believe this is my first DIPA and I find it oddly disappointing. Given my anticipation of bitterness, I thought I would welcome a sweet malty backbone more. But it might actually be too sweet. 10% alcohol?

287,17112,twelvsies,3.38,"Batch #8907, bottled in January according to the website, drank in April. Had high hopes for this one but not initially floored as I thought I might be. It's only 3 months old, but perhaps it's starting to fade a bit. My question is, should a beer lose it's quality that quickly? I dunno... but I will definitely seek out an uber fresh sample of this when available and compare it with these notes. As is this beer pours a sturdy looking amber color, darkish, with a small head fading pretty quickly. Smell is hoppy, citrus mostly, orange peel, but then dominated by a sweet maltyness. Very heavy on the malt as well in the taste. I'm not getting destroyed by the hops here. A vanilla sweetness and an orange citrus flavor prevail over everything else. Perhaps a little too sweet from the added honey. And a little boozy to be honest. If there was a bigger hop presence this may be covered up but it's just not holding up. Malty, sweet, sticky, chewy, kind of clumsy. Not trying to knock this beer as I may not have the freshest example (but I did have three bottles to make sure) but it isn't world class in my book.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",Imperial IPA,98
287,17112,sevopie,4.31,"Yellow/Golden with a sizable off-white/tan head. Laces moderately well.  A bit of citrusy hops, with honey dominating. Also, the slightest soap smell, but its very barely noticable.  A blast of hops greets you with the first sip, complimented well by the honey. Grapefruit and grassy notes abound.  Fairly oily, with a mild carbonation.  The hops start to overwhelm as it warms, but this is still quite sippable throughout. Great brew, but not quite at the top as far as IPAs go.

287,17112,krisandajt,4.32,"I've been meaning to review this bad boy for a while now...finally got the chance.  Appearance: Pours a nice clear, golden color. Head foams up nice, about two finger widths. Settles slowly with some nice lacing left behind.  Smell: Hoppy, just a bit of pine, nice! Not overwhelming either...it actually has a slight bit of sweetness to it.  Taste: Smooth and hoppy. I was expecting more of a hoppy punch at the end, but it is actually finishes off nicely. Bitter but not overwhelming, with just a little bit of pine. Delicious!  Mouthfeel: Mouthfeel was okay. I was expecting a little more carbonation and a heavier feel to it. Regardless, it was smooth and refreshing.  Drinkability: Highly drinkable if you like hops (which I do). High ABV makes this less of a session brew and more of a one-timer, atleast for me. Still, I will definitely be drinking more of these in the future.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",Imperial IPA,98
287,17112,barnzy78,4.86,"12oz. Usually I carefully decant Bell's products, but not this one. Poured a cloudy but bright amber color with a rocky, off-white head with good retention and a nice lacing. Huge floral hop and pine aroma coupled with grapefruit and some tropical mango and pineapple. Mouth-feel is thick and juicy, some carbonation that allows the flavors to cover the entire palate. Juicy ripened pineapple and grapefruit explode on the first sip, it's sweet like fresh honey, but the bitter piny hop finish is fantastically balanced with the malty sweetness. Alcohol is well concealed. This is an amazing ale. Always a favorite of mine.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",Imperial IPA,98

A real winner.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",Imperial IPA,98
287,17112,BeerImmediately,4.31,"Poured a 2f white head, with nice lacing. Fairly clear, amber/orange color and light carbonation present.  Smell is simply awesome - like a buttery biscuit drizzled in honey, sitting in the middle of a pine forest. Oh, and a glass of pineapple juice sitting next to it.  Taste was quite well balanced - high on the hops, yes, but nearly equally rich maltiness. Grapefruit, resin, sweet apricots, and a hint of smoke as it warmed.  MF was rich, as expected. Juicy hops, with a lingering film on the tongue, and slight burn of alcohol on the throat.  Amazingly drinkable for the ABV, and this is how the beer becomes dangerous.

287,17112,Thorpe429,4.15,"On tap in Bloomington, IN. Had this some time in January 2009.  A: Bright orange and slightly cloudy. A white head with glimmers of the beer in it.  S: Simply put, this is the most amazing nose I've ever encountered. An overabundance of hops combined with a clear scent of honey, and a powerful malt base to back it all up. I know this scent will be good in a month or so, so I really need to savor it while it's fresh.  T: Much like the nose, this is utterly without parallel (sorry to Mr. Pliny, I haven't had the opportunity yet). This is how every DIPA should be made. The malt is certainly there, but does nothing to even content with the luscious hops that come on. Simply brilliant. The honey is certainly a nice touch, too.  M: Medium bodied with good carbonation.  D: Could be the only beer I'd ever drink again, if Bell's were so gracious as to devote 50% of their capacity to this one.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",Imperial IPA,98
287,17112,pokesbeerdude,4.25,"Thanks to DoctorDog for this one in a trade. 12 oz Single.  A: Light amber color with about half an inch of dense creamy looking off white head. Slightly hazy. Gobs of lacing all around. Fair amount of carbonation moving around in this one. Very nice looking DIPA.  S: Hops, and a fair amount of them, but a fair amount of sweetness too, which is interesting for the style. Lots of honey, caramel, and candy like sugar smells in this one to go along with the hops. Hops are earth, and strong, some citrus and pine too, lots of different hop smells pulling my nose in a few directions. Very nice though.  T: Not what I expected at all. Extremely balanced is the first thing that comes to mind. Not a flaming hop bomb like I expected. Hops are there, and definitely in abundance, but there is a huge malt profile to match it. Hops are bitter, and earthy, but not overwhelming. Malt profile is honey, caramel, and sweet. Really the epitome of balance in a DIPA. Lots of hop flavors and resins, but a solid malt backbone to hang with it. Not a hint of booze either. Impressive. I'm thoroughly impressed.  M: Medium thickness and carbonation. Quite dry, and slightly puckering from the hop characteristic. Slight alcohol heat once it hits my gut, but not really terrible. Spot on for the style.  D: Well...for what it is, this is one of the more drinkable DIPA's. It doesn't burninate the tongue like others with hop dominance, and it has great balance. If there is such a thing is a session DIPA, this would be it. Really a great beer, and I wish it were more readily available out West. I'd really like to try this beer on tap.  Thanks Ben!

287,17112,projectflam86,4.92,"A- Pours beautiful golden/amber color with a thin off-white head that leaves great lacing.  S- Strong piney hop nose. Some delicate floral and citrus (mostly grapefruit, orange peel, and lemon). There is the slightest bit of honey detectable.  T- Wonderful hop flavor initially with a strong pine and grapefruit taste. There is a sweet malt honey flavor that attempts to balance the bitter hops. The hops eventually win that battle but the sweetness gave a respectable effort.  M- Medium bodied and crisp. Way more balanced in terms of bitter hops/sweet malt than I expected.  D- Superbly drinkable, could easily become one of my favorites.  Notes: This batch was brewed about 4 months ago (Jan 09). I have heard that the hops fade quickly which may be why I perceived a much better balance of malt and hops than expected. If this is the case, I will most certainly be looking to try a fresh one next time around.  ReReviewed on Jan 10, 2010 with a fresh (2 week old) batch:  A- Slightly hazy orange amber pour with plenty of white lace - 4.5  S- Massive aroma of tropical citrus hops and honey - 5.0  T- Huge hop explosion with flavors of pineapple, orange, ruby red grapefruit, kiwi, lemon, and passion fruit. A prominent yet delicate honey flavor helps out for a balanced finish but this baby is all hops. Absolutely amazing - 5.0  M- Medium bodied with great carbonation. The alcohol is hidden incredibly well - 4.5  D- One of the easiest drinking IPA/DIPAs out there. Huge hop flavor with the alcohol being exceptionally well hidden.

Smells of sweet hay and citrus, with some brown sugar sweetness. A concentrated grassy hopslam it is. It has a strong citrus, I'd say grapefruit flavor, yet a balanced sweetness level. Most of the taste comes out at the beginning. Though concentrated, it is a well balanced beer. The mouthfeel is light and refreshing.

287,17112,Larrytown,4.12,"This is one appropriately named beer. Pours a hazy golden-orange and the nose is, well, hoppy. Lots of citrus right in your face. This is one you can smell across the room. In my book, that's a good thing.  The taste has a lot to live up to after that smell and, for the most part, it does. It's definitely typical of your citrus-y IPA with, if anything, a bit more fruity than I expected.  I split a sixer with a friend and they went quickly, but it's definitely a palate-cleanser. Not sure I could transition from this to something else, but hey, it's good enough that you don't need to.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",Imperial IPA,98
287,17112,alovesupreme,4.37,"Poured into a Maudite Snifter yielded a Honey color with a tall white head that dissapated to a thin layer rather quickly. Every variation of pineapple is obvious. By this I mean, Fresh pineapple, canned pineapple, candied pineapple etc. Honey is also a dominating factor. Alcohol is also very prominent. Once again I feel as though i a drinking a less acidic high alcohol pineapple juice. Hops are strong but balanced by a honey/ caramel bready malt backbone extremely well. Alcohol is the only factor preventing a perfect 5. Syrupy thick, well carbonated and an extremely full body. A fantastic Double IPA. The only downside to this beer is the high abv. I understand its a double but it is a little overwhelming at times. But none the less a fantastic beer.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",Imperial IPA,98

The only imperial IPA with more citrus and robust hops smell that I have had is Pliny. After the amazing smell that didn't hold back a bit I was expecting more from the taste. I have a bottle back from an early January batch and i have heard that the taste is better with freshness on this one. Citrus fruits, hops, and honey dominate the beginning and middle but the end of the flavor is pretty big on malt and alcohol.

Flavor is too sweet for me. Balance is close to what it should be, but sweetness of malt (honey?) is too much for the style. Hops are great both in aroma and flavor. Fairly light feel for the style. Not too cloying or syrupy. Easy-to-drink for such a big beer, but sweetness prohibits slows things down.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",Imperial IPA,98

Blended well together.  M: Leaves a nice dry hoppy finish on the palate.

Mouthfeel, well with the sediment its not exactly A+, but could be my fault from an over excited pour. Laces the tongue with an almost sour taste.  Drink, decent. I can only imagine how much better this would be fresh, but until than, this is what I have to go off of.

I'm guessing several types of hops were used here, with a surplus being put on the aromatic hops. The flavor is extremely balanced well. The hop flavor profile seems to lean on the citric side, and it isn't nearly as imposing as I anticipated, which is not a bad thing here. I wouldn't guess this was any where near 10%.

The first smell I got was hops, then citrus and pineapple ,and the taste was the same. The first flavor is the citrusy hops, then a little sweetness and then the alcohol. Although it's a strong 10% the alcohol blends right in and the beer is quite deceiving in this respect. Lastly the hop bitterness lingers, but in a good way. The feel in the mouth is oily and the carbonation is quite noticeable but not overbearing. All in all a great balance of all the flavors.

The smell is very sweet, citrus hops and honey for sure. There is a little pine and floral hops as you investigate further, but the citrus and honey dominate.  The beer tastes exactly how it smells, bitter citrus hops burst over the tongue and the honey follows it up for a very nice balance. The honey sweetness adds a nice balance and masks the 10% abv very nicely.  The beer is carbonated perfectly and feels great, nice and smooth, not too much alcohol flavor present making it very drinkable. I have been drinking the Harpoon Leviathon lately but this beer blows it out of the water.

This beer poured a bright, mildly opaque orange/tan body with a nice sized white head. The head was surprisingly large for a 10% ABV monster.  Nose is thick and present with resin, citrus hops but with an overall honey like sweetness. Touches of caramel, some other sweet notes and even some pine needles. There's a nice herbal flowery smell as well. A really nice nose.  Taste is very thick with an immediate big hit of BOTH strong resin bitter citrus hops and a huge flavor of honey that work PERFECTLY together. The honey is a nice natural honeycomb type flavor and gives this beer a honey slick syrupy mouthfeel. Nice strong bitter citrus, pine, potpourri, resin hop flavor. Extremely bitter from start to finish. The honey just works so perfectly. The 10% is hidden at first, but really sneaks up on you.  Wow!!! What a cool beer. Honey and hops? Who would have known?

The flavor is much the same. Such a bold, spicy and citrus hop flavor. There is also some good malt sweetness and you can definitely taste the honey that was added. It is sufficiently bitter for a DIPA. It has a full flavor and medium body.

Smells very floral and piney. I only catch a whiff of the honey, but the hops dominate.  Tastes first of sweet malts followed by the hop bite with a good bitter followup.  The feel is nice and light with a good bit of carbonation.  The twelve ounces went down incredibly easy. I couldn't believe how quick I drank the one bottle without even trying.  I previously had this beer from another trade but didn't review it because it had been in the bottle too long. I'm glad I waited for a fresher sample because age tends to make the honey dominate and it becomes a hoppy mead. If had fresh enough, the honey really helps to lighten the body and accentuate the hops. Very well done.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",Imperial IPA,98
287,17112,spycow,4.23,"12 ounce bottle poured into a Duvel Tulip.  A: Pours a copper color with a slight haze. Leaves a small head with a nice lacing in the glass.  S: Unbelievable smell. No doubt the hoppiness is there. Strong smell of fruits and herbals. Something tropical, citricy and slightly sour (but pleasant).  T: Absolutely lives up to its name. You can really taste the earthy hops, the citrus and tropical notes, with a hint of a nuttiness. Tastes complex but very smooth and the strong alcohol does not overwhelm the taste. Typical of a good hoppy IPA it leaves an unbelievable aftertaste after each sip getting better and better.  M&D: It really coats your mouth with a smooth, oily like feel. Excellent feeling as its not that carbonated and really just right. For an imperial IPA it is very drinkable. You could easily drink several but the strong alcohol could sneak up on you if you are not careful. Easily that good.  An excellent version of the imperial IPA. A little pricy $15.99 for a 6-pack but well worth the price if you like a hoppy IPA. Highly recommended.

Grapefruit hops as well.  Taste is hoppy and sweet, very rich. Pretty decent hop flavor without a ton of bitterness, more spicy, and really heavy on the malt and honey (which almost seems like it was added after fermentation). I'd prefer a more floral then spicy pine hop flavor, overall it's a bit spicy for my taste in the style, a bit to rich as well. Oddly though, it seemed to get even more pungent as it warmed from fridge temp, and really started to grow on me. A nice beer that I'm glad I got to try, thanks again John!  Mouthfeel is oily, chewy and dry.  Drinkability is pretty good, it's a hefty, malt forward DIPA, but the hops are pungent no doubt. The high ABV is well hidden, mainly just coming through in the dry, spicy finish. At the end of the day it just wasn't quite my taste in the style, but I enjoyed it, more so when it warmed up a ton (which isn't normally the case with DIPAs for me).",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",Imperial IPA,98
287,17112,meatmallet,4.77,"Appearance: A deep golden color with light carbonation rising from the bottom. A medium white foamy head stuck around the edges for some time.  Smell: The hopp aroma hits me first followed by sweet grapefruit and a light malt.  Taste: Very complex. It begins like a grapefruit peel, a little bitter and earthy. It then gets more sweet but the slight sour taste lingers. The aftertaste stays with you for some time. Awesome.  Mouthfeel/drinkability: The carbonation and body are light. One of my favorite beers ever.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",Imperial IPA,98
287,17112,Livelaughlovep,4.82,"No freakin' kidding!! I can see why it is so loved. This stuff is amazing. The tag is never a cheap one, but I can see a budding romance starting with this stuff. Out of the bottle, poured into my pint glass... the color is just lovely. A somewhat hazy soft orange, and then a nice tall fluffy head. As you bring it to your nose, scents of citrus are apparent, and then warm summer day - the exact smell of a warm summer day. The hay, mown grass, warmth. The fluffy head retreats to some appreciable lacing. First sip.... Essence of grass, hay, lemons!!! LEMONS!!! and grapefruit. As you swish, and then swallow, more grass comes through, hitting you in the back of the throat with one helluva bitter swallow. That is what brings you back for another swig. I don't taste honey as much as perceive it. The mouthfeel is medium-bodied, rich and slightly oily on the tongue - it is silky. No real carbonation to speak of. This evokes summertime fun, with is grassy, citrusy explosion. The ABV is a shocker: You don't taste it. It goes down lovely and smooth.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",Imperial IPA,98
287,17112,Martin2D,4.43,"A - Amber with a huge head that retained quite well and laced as it receded  S - Hop notes with some floralness  T - Distinct hop presence with a slight malt accompaniment. Hops are a mix of grapefruit and other bitter florals.  M - Perfect carbonation and mouthfeel.  D - I could easily pound these all night. Not an absolute hop bomb, but great hop presence. After having Two Hearted first, I was not expecting much, but this beer is exponentially better and completely different.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",Imperial IPA,98
287,17112,alcstradamus,4.47,"A--Pours a golden/copper color with a slight bit of murkiness. Near white head was about a finger tall, although I don't think I gave it a very good pour. It recedes but doesn't disappear. Good lacing down the glass.  S--Simply amazing. Pineapple is the dominant scent, but there really is a whole mixed bag of tropical fruits present. With a tad bit of warmth pine notes begin to come through.  T--Very tropical hop profile. Not overwhelming yet still very bitter and flavorful. A bit of honey sweetness.  M--So oily that it glides down the throat and coats the whole mouth in the process. After it is swallowed a piney bitterness charges back up the throat and if you are lucky you get to have the most amazing hop burps!!  D--How in the hell this is 10% ABV I have no clue. Because of the high alcohol content I would have to force myself to drink no more than 2 at a time. 3 if its all I'm having. I could drink it all night based on the beer itself though.  Hopslam is unquestionably a world class beer and one of my favorites. It would make a great introduction to DIPA's as well since it is so easy drinking.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",Imperial IPA,98
287,17112,badmoon,4.92,"Served in a tulip from a 12oz. bottle.  A: Nice amber/orange color. I got about one finger of head but nice lacing remained.  S: Unbelievable nose on this one! Hints of pineapple and other fruits. I've never smelled anything quite like this.  T: If you love hops, and I mean LOVE hops, this is the beer for you! This is one of the most complex brews I've ever tasted. Very well balanced.  M: This is a little on the sweet side but just barely. There is a slight hint of alcohol at the finish but nothing to worry about. Nothing unusual for this style.  D: It would be very easy to pound several of these very quickly but at this price, they are strictly a treat for me. And yes, it's that good.  Overall: This may be my favorite beer right now, overtaking Surly Coffee Bender. Hopslam is drying up around my area so I may have to find a sixer to hide away for a rainy day. Excellent!",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",Imperial IPA,98
287,17112,DarbyOGill,4.64,"A: Pours a golden amber, I only got about a pinkys worth of head, but there's some pretty decent lacing. This beer has high turbidity.  S: All I pick up is some delicious smelling piney hops. I also get a hint of orange, but I don't pick up any malt. Just what I'm looking for in a DIPA.  T: Really hoppy start, I mean, REALLY HOPPY. I get a lot of the orange and pines I smelled, but there was one flavor I picked up that was kind of surprising. I got a hint of Pineapple which I've never tasted before in a beer. After the initial, hop slam, I get a faint smooth burn of alcohol, and it finishes with a strong malty finish. This is probably the finest beer I've ever tasted.  M: Pretty standard for an IPA/DIPA. Nothing surprising about the mouthfeel.  D: I couldn't see me drinking a lot of these, but at 10% ABV, I probably wouldn't need to.  Overall: This beer is rocks, I strongly suggest picking up a sixer.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",Imperial IPA,98

The smell is of strong hops and grapefruit. Very citrusy, I couldn't wait to drink it.  The alcohol is very present but goes down easy with the hops falvor followed by that citrus. A great taste.

Very nice lacing as well.  S - Pineapple and citrus. It was overwhelming and very inviting.  T - Definately a potent brew - I could taste the alcohol in this as well as the bitterness throughout the front and the back. Then agani, it's called Hopslam so I wasn't expecting to lack bitterness. The Taste of citrus comes through as well some muted sweet tones.  Mouthfeel - Just the right carbonation for my tastes.  Drinkability- I would rate this higher if I believe I could tolerate the bitterness beyond a few as well as the 10% ABV.

287,17112,goatxpower,4.28,"Drinking as I write this. Just received in the mail.  A- Clear and golden orange, with very little head to speak of  S- A big shot of hops, and then nothing. It's as if the hops evaporated or something. It doesn't smell bad, it just doesn't smell like anything anymore. Maybe I should have gotten it colder (it's at ""belgian"" temperature right now). I just a trace of hops and some floral aromatics from the malt. I want to believe that I can smell the honey.  T- This is fantastic. There is obviously a ton of hops in this thing, but they work together very well. I get peach and apricot flavors. Pineapple. Some rum and honey flavor. I guessing that there are either some English or Noble hops in here somewhere, because I'm getting a little bit of grassy, earthyness on the tail-end. But in a good way. The flavor lingers for a long time. I'm sold.  M- The body is totally standard, if not a little light for this style.  D- This is a fantastic, easy drinking hop-bomb. complex and flavorful, but not as harsh as many lower ABV IPAs out there (Lagunitas, I'm looking at you, pal). I could probably drink six of these easy... which is a frightening prospect at 10%.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",Imperial IPA,98

The smell is so full of grapefruit and citrus is incredible. Very nice sweetness in the back too. This is my favorite taste in the world. Lovely hop oil provides a strong bitter citrus, but right behind that is sweetness from the honey that is brewed in this one. This has a great sticky mouthfeel, but goes down easy.

287,17112,mjl21,4.03,"Acquired in a trade with alleykatking...thanks Josh!  12 ounce bottle with that great artwork poured into a snifter. This is Batch 8911 and according to the Bell's batch finder, it was packaged on 1/20/09. Comes in at 10%.  A-Pours a clear, glowing orange-honey color. Has a very minimal white heasd that dissipates into a small frothy ring. A nice oil slick of head remains in the middle of the glass. Has a nice stream of bubbles continuosly pouring up from the middle. Not a ton of lacing.  S-Pineapple. This is without a doubt the most pineapply smelling beer that has ever hit my nose. Would like to see what it smells like 2 months earlier.  T-That pineapple taste hits fast followed by sweet malt and honey. On the back there is a nice hop bitterness that lingers.  M-Definitely veers toward the sweet side rather than the dry side. I found it to be fuller bodied than most IIPA's that I drink. The carbonation level was good. Leaves a really nice coating in the mouth.  D-I had no problem taking out the 12 ounce bottle, but the sweetness and high ABV would limit this one for me.  It was great to finally try not only this beer, but also this brewery that I have heard so much about from my buddy who grew up in Grand Rapids, MI, as well as fellow BA'ers. In fairness to this beer, I did try it 2 months after it was bottled. I look forward to trying one of these when the 2010 batch is first released.

287,17112,rhinos00,4.68,"Was fortunate enough to catch this beer on cask @ the Buckeye Brew Engine. Poured into a snifter.  A- Compared to the bottled and on-tap version, this was one of the more notable differences. Had an absolutely amazing head that just laced the sides of the glass as it was consumed. There was a clear line of distinction as the head sat on top of the body of the beer, almost like someone had a straight edge and just plopped the head right on there. Of course the color was wonderful with nice amber hues.  S- Great scent that resembled a bouquet of piney and citrus hops.  T- Tastes were similar to the on-tap version. Followed the nose with a nice mixture of bitter pine hops and citrus fruit feel.  M- By far the difference maker in this beer. Unlike other versions, this beer on cask had an amazing creamy, full mouthfeel that is wonderfully complimented by its great taste. Just a completely different experience and vastly improved the beer in my opinion.  D- Hmmm....I drank 3 snifter in under a 45 mintues. Probably the most drinkable DIPA I have ever had.  If you get the opportunity, try this beer on cask! It's a completely different experience and puts it in the ranks of PtE and PtY, maybe even better.

The beer has a nice dark gold colour with a nice centimeter head. The flavour of the beer is immense; there is a huge bitterness with a great citrus/grapefruit flavour. The fruity flavours are balanced with a sweetness that comes from the honey. These flavours come through initially, but the end of the beer flavours is quite spicy/resiny. There is a great balance between the flavours.  The mouthfeel is a bit thin for a IIPA, but the beer is okay in the drinkability aspect. Since the mouthfeel is a bit thin, the beer is a bit too watery, which takes away from the awesome flavour of the beer.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",Imperial IPA,98
287,17112,GatorBeerNerd,4.89,"12 oz bottle purchased as part of a 6 pack by my friend that we split. It was purchased in Bowling Green, KY and poured into a Hennepin Tulip to help concentrate the aroma.  A: A nice clear light yellow with orange tinting. Not much head to speak of. There is just a wispy covering of bubbles. No real lacing to speak of. Not a big surprise based on the ABV.  S: Pineapple, Grapefruit, and many other citrus aromas slap you in the face when you get close to the glass. What a beautiful hop aroma.  T: See the smell category! Just an absolute explosion of hop flavor in the mouth. Pineapple and grapefruit flavors are the most prevalent. There is also a bit of a sweetness that I assume comes from the honey. This one lives up to the hype. I am so glad that next year we should be able to buy this excellent brew in GA.  M: It is a bit of thinner that I would typically like, but it works well with the rest of the parts of this one. It is incredibly smooth due to an excellent in mouth carbonation level.  D: There is no reason why this one should be this drinkable. You would think the ABV and truck load of hops would make it a sipper. With that said, it might be the most drinkable DIPA I have ever had. It is like alcoholic fruit juice.

When you sip this one you know you are tasting something special. An excellent ale that has just become one of my favorites.  M - A good hop bite on the sides of the tongue with a hint of honey sweetness on the tip of the tongue.

A bit of sweetness enhanced by the honey.  Mouthfeel: Smooth, moderate carbonation. The ABV gives a little bit of a kick as well.  As noted in the taste section, I was quite wowed by this beer.

287,17112,drizzam,4.35,"Reviewing this brew at 6:00 pm on 3/27/09 for the nation-wide toast of the beer hunter, Michael Jackson, in honor of his birthday. (He passed way too early, and is now in that micro-brewery in the sky.)  Thanks to Bells Batch identifier at bellsbeer.com, I found out my individual bottle was packaged on January 13th, 2009.  Appearance - Poured into my favorite european beer glass...gorgeous off white head with marvelous retention. Billowy and fluffy, it doesn't want to go away, and leaves excellent lacing. The brew itself is a cloudy dark orange color.  Smell - Smells like I took a pineapple right out of the produce section of the supermarket and squeezed it into my mug. also, it seems like I get a whiff of grapefruit rind as well. The grapefruit actually comes out even more as it warms. Very nice bouquet.  Taste - The initial taste I get is that of grapefruit rind, followed by an intense piney, hoppy afterbite. This is my first IIPA and it isn't as bitter as I expected it to be. I'm glad it isn't actually. There is an excellent balance between the fruit and the hop... they play nicely together.  Mouthfeel - Silky smooth and medium bodied. Leaves a hoppy aftertaste, but not as bitter as expected.  Drinkability - This is a tasty selection from Bells. The $15 for a sixer seemed a little high at first, but you get what you pay for. 10% ABV will preclude this from being a session brew, but it is quite the tasty number when taken in moderation. Very impressed!",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",Imperial IPA,98
287,17112,johnmichael712,4.82,"The back label of this bottle tells me I'm in for ""a biting, bitter, tongue bruiser of an ale"". I can't wait.  Appearance: Poured out of a 12 oz. bottle into a snifter. There is no freshness date on the bottle, but there is a batch code (8949) along with a clever picture of a man being crushed by hop cones that is very reminiscent of the Wicked Witch of the West after she got owned by a house. This beer pours a dark, golden-amber color that has incredible clarity when held up to a light. A large, off-white head appears on the surface of the beer and is supplemented by very small, but frequent, bubbles rising from the bottom of the glass. The head has incredible staying power and a thin layer covers the surface of the beer all the way down.  Smell: This beer smells like walking through a hop farm. It has an intensely aromatic, citrusy nose with punch-you-in-the-face aromas of orange, grapefruit, pineapple, mango, papaya, and other tropical fruits. Bell's Hopslam Ale smells like a super rich and acid tropical punch, and has enough aromatic qualities to make Hawaiian Punch and Hi-C go cry to their mommies. I won't be surprised if I never smell an Imperial IPA better than this.  Taste: My first thought was, 106 IBU's? I don't believe it. Followed by, wow, what an absolutely incredible Imperial IPA. This beer starts off with a wonderful honey flavored sweetness and soft, pillowy texture akin to eating a fresh sugar cookie drenched in honey. I have the malt to thank for that. After that, however, the hops kick it into high gear and really bring this one home with an intense hop flavor that screams Pacific Northwest and C-hops. As in the aroma there are notes of orange, grapefruit, and pineapple, and this leads to a sweet, citrusy, and bitter finish. The grapefruit taste is perhaps the strongest, and it brings back fond memories of drinking Ruby Red Grapefruit juice and my grandparent's house during my summers in Florida.  Mouthfeel: This is a very smooth, robust, and full-bodied Imperial IPA. Medium carbonation, but the bubbles are so small and soft that it's really quite pleasant to swirl them around the mouth. No astringency, no watery-ness, nothing bad to say about the mouthfeel of this beer.  Drinkability: Obviously Imperial IPA's aren't the most drinkable beers out there, but this beer still manages to be much more drinkable than some of the others on the market. The honey imparts a smoothness and sweetness that does wonders for the overall character of this brew, and this is one fine, and highly-drinkable, Imperial IPA.  Notes: BJCP style guidelines for an Imperial IPA inform me that this is a ""showcase for hops"", and I have to agree. Never before, however, have I had hops that have been showcased with this much finesse and beauty. Don't get me wrong, this is still an Imperial IPA that can compete with the best of them in terms of bitterness, but Bell's Hopslam Ale also has enough of a sweetness and smoothness to keep me coming back for bottle after bottle. For a huge malt fan like me, that's saying quite a lot.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",Imperial IPA,98

I drank this one straight out of the bottle as i was too anxious to try after all the good things i've heard about it. I was a bit underwhelmed by it though. It didn't excite my tongue as much as it excited me to try it. It was extremely hoppy but didn't give me the west coast grapefruity and piney taste that i love. It may be a little too syrupy (too malty) for my taste.

No clash at all just a slow transition from one to the other. Finish is crisp and clean without any oily hop aftertaste just the heat of the alcohol. No unpleasant alcohol aftertaste just the heat.  M- Medium bodied and carbonated. For a DIPA this has a crispness and lightness to it that is hard to find.  D- No hint of the 10% ABV other that the heat in the finish.

The tropical fruits dominate. Grapefruit and piney hops. Distinct honey flavors on the mid-palate. Mouthfeel is sugary, almost like I'm drinking tropical hopfruit candy. Delicious.  D: Given that this is 10%, this one is dangerous.  Anyone who loves IPAs must seek this one out. I'll take this any day over the SoCal bitter-bombs that taste like condensed hop oil.

287,17112,sarahspat,4.14,"For my first real beer review, I'm taking pains to make sure I get everything right: correct glassware (properly cleaned and air dried), right temperature (approximated as best as I can), and an earnest attempt to completely cleanse my palate before I start. I have had some very good experiences with this beer in the past, and I want to do it justice and write the best review I can. I'm nervous and excited to get to work!  Thanks to the handy ""batch search"" on bellsbeer.com, I was able to deduce that this particular bottle of Hopslam was brewed on January 20, 2009, which is almost exactly 2 months prior to today's date.  Upon opening the bottle, I am immediately greeted (treated) to whiffs of sweet candied pineapple. There is a huge bone white head that prevents me from pouring the whole bottle into my tulip glass at once. The appearance of the beer is a beautiful light/medium light orange; it's not what I would call incredibly cloudy, but not it's really not transparent either, just in between.  The nose is amazing, almost overpoweringly fruity, but in a good way. I love fruit! Candied pineapple and grapefruit, mostly, with a little caramel to round it out, and a nice floral undercurrent. A lot of beers have these kinds of aromas, but none to the degree of Hopslam. I mean, you cannot miss the bouquet of fruit here, due simply to its sheer force. I have to say, the smell is my favorite part of this beer. Every time I go in for another sip (and consequently have to stick my nose in the glass), almost want to exclaim ""Oh my dear Lord!"" out loud. It just smells that good, even towards the end of the glass!  Spice hits the tongue hard. At the start of the sip, bitterness is predominant. After the swallow, you can finally taste that sought after sweet, sweet pineapple, citrus and a bit of caramel, then the floral flavor and more bitterness on the finish and a bit of a bite from the alcohol. This beer asserts itself and lets you know who you're dealing with. This is a nice, complex ale. Hopslam is right up there with the best DIPAs I've ever tried, however it seems that with this sampling, the smell is better than the taste for me. I don't remember the alcohol flavor being this strong in previous Hopslams I've enjoyed. Then again, I don't think I've ever had it at the proper temperature before. At about the halfway mark, this thing is hitting me pretty hard. This is a serious beer! I would not recommend drinking it on a day when you have something important to do. And, when drinking it, be sure to keep a glass of water close at hand, because this little guy's gonna make you very thirsty. And you better pace yourself if you're planning on drinking 12 oz. or more!  Medium mouthfeel: not too weak, but not too chewy, seems just about right for the style.  I've had more ""drinkable"" Hopslams in the past, but that was probably because it was served at too cold of a temperature. You can really feel the 10% ABV at 55 degrees Fahrenheit. The strong alcohol flavor is the only thing that is compelling me to deduct a couple of points for drinkability, but it's making a good argument. But, oh! Those sweet, sweet pineapples!

287,17112,TheNightbird,4.37,"A- Bright orange/amber. With good head retention, turning into a thin ring.  S- Pine and honey dominates the smell. With a pleasant citrus and slight floral aroma. Followed by nice sweet malt.  T- Very upfront with a piney bitterness that flows into a sweet malt. At the end honey and alcohol takes over the aftertaste.  M- A crisp full body beer that has a nice carbonation.  D- Good drinkability.

287,17112,Sean9689,4.38,"Updated review, 01/22/11, 12oz bottle into Portsmouth tulip.  A - Pours a copper orange/red, a fingers-worth of off-white head which reduces to a thin film on top and a small ring of foam around the glass. There's some nice lacing along the sides of the glass.  S - A quick swirl reveals a piney/citrus bomb, some malt sweetness, lots of bitter hops, perhaps some slight floral notes in their as well. Very light alcohol note, barley detectable.  T - A swift punch in the face if hops, pine, and citrus. Following the huge bitter notes is nice sweet malts which almost brings some relief, that is, until you take the next sip. Slighty sweet/floral finish.  M - Medium, smooth and refreshing, perfect carbonation for the style, oily hoppy finish.  D - I had to review this one again with an uber-fresh bottle. This beer is just straight-up awesome. I could pound this like a 3% session ale until I would up passed out on the floor for underestimating this beast of a DIPA. World-class.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",Imperial IPA,98
287,17112,turnblom79,4.97,"Very interesting and delicious double. The aroma was very citrusy and you could even smell the sweetness before tasting. While drinking, you are hit with all of the hop flavor right away, but because of the added sweetness, the bitterness at the end is much less than you would expect from the up front taste. Probably not the best beer to drink multiples of, but great for sipping and great overall.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",Imperial IPA,98
287,17112,CampusCrew,4.65,"Classic double with an intresting twist.  appearance: golden amber and reddish hues, decent lacing residue  smell: loaded loaded hops, very plesant for a hop fans. Extreme freshness  taste: Very strong hops aroma, this beer is loaded, overhelming pineapple taste because of the sweet honey, actually got annoying as i went ob with the beer.  mouthfeel: high carbonation and very tasty  drinkability: really strong double and i will have it again. Unsure if I could have multis becaus eof the sweetness",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",Imperial IPA,98
287,17112,jgap,4.23,"Big thanks to psychohops bob for sending me this as an extra. I love the label. Pours a brilliant orange with a frothy egg-white head. Smell is strong of grapefruit and pine. It's hard to sense much else until halfway through the glass at which point hints of sweetness can be slightly detected. At first the taste is almost entirely masked by a vigorous carbonation. However once the beer has calmed down and your tounge acclimated, the taste is grapefruit up front fading to a lingering, strong pine. Traces of the sweet honey show itself but it's never in control of the taste. Good beer.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",Imperial IPA,98
287,17112,Rchap1,3.11,"Had on tap at Bell's in Kalamazoo.  A: Looked about like you'd expect a DIPA to look, deep gold color, not a huge head on it, nor did the head stick around for very long. Minimal lacing. S: Again, about like you'd expect; strong floral hop tones, very minimal malt, maybe a hint of juniper in there. Made me think of gin. T: To be very honest, this just didn't do it for me. It hardly tasted like a DIPA in my opinion. I suppose to the beer's credit, the alcohol is very well hidden, but otherwise it just seemed like a run of the mill IPA. Started with a little malt, moved into a sweet hop range, and finished with some decent bitterness. M: Fairly full, the bitterness definitely stuck around a bit. D: Again, with the alcohol being fairly hidden, I would bet that you could put a couple of these down at a time. But for me, at $6 for a 12 oz. glass, just not worth it.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",Imperial IPA,98
287,17112,Gyle41386,4.68,"Poured from a 12 oz bottle into a tulip. Huge thanks to the fine folks at Brawley's for hooking me up with a bottle.  Pours a light orange amber color. Huge four finger head. Great retention, took a while to pour this one. Loads of bubbles, tons of sticky lacing. Amazing looking beer.  Strong hop nose. Grapefruit, pineapple, orange. Big pine as well.  Wow. This is one tasty beer. It's a full-on hop assault. The malt backbone is there, but it gladly takes the backseat. The orange, grapefruit, and pineapple are huge, and I absolutely LOVE a citrus-heavy IPA. Like in the nose, there is some pine, but in no way is HopSlam like a glass of liquefied pine needles. I really love the sweet honey.  Medium body. Super smooth feel. Creamy with some nice prickly carbonation. There is absolutely no way you can tell this beer is 10%. It very well could be TOO drinkable.  As a relatively new member of the craft beer scene, I've tried to tell myself to not get sucked into the hype surrounding certain beers, and I feel I've done a pretty good job of that so far. HopSlam is one I was slightly worried about. However, this beer blows any expectations I had of it out of the water.

287,17112,Hokies,4.51,"Thanks to Uwftke26 for the trade on this one. 12oz bottle poured into a tulip. Pours an orange light amber color with a thin white head and a light sticky lace left on the glass.  A wonderful aroma, as the beer warms the honey becomes more noticeable but the hops provide most of the aroma. The hops give off a tremendous aroma of grapefruit and pineapple, it is quite nice.  The taste is not as hoppy as one would think from the aroma. The honey and sweet malt makes its presence throughout the taste to mellow out the hops. The grapefruit taste takes over in the middle but then the honey comes back and balances out the bitterness from the hops. Their is a nice bitterness that does linger from this one.  This is a very drinkable IIPA for sure, not my favorite style but this is IIPA that I would go back to.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",Imperial IPA,98
287,17112,Durge,4.15,"A hazy amber color with a very nice white fuzz cap and decent lacing. The aroma is heavy flowery hops with some sweet malt hiding in the background. The flavor confirms the intense floral hops but a few mouthfuls eventually reveal the attempt to balance this brew with a touch of brown sugar and salty malt. Full bodied and lightly carbonated. I don't see this as a session beer with such thick constitution and heavy hops. But this a quality hop concoction. This was pretty heavy handed in the hops so it might take a couple tries to entirely warm up to it, a price I am happy to pay. Don't miss giving it a try!",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",Imperial IPA,98
287,17112,theghost3,4.49,"HopSlam pours an amber/light orange with a thin white-gold head. Minimal lacing.  The smell is overwhelmingly strong of grapefruit hops, but there are also floral & sweet scents.  The flavor is again, strong of grapefruity hops but not as bitter as I expected. There's a sweet butterscotch quality with honey and a hint of pine. The feel is rather smooth at first but then some acidity creeps up towards the end.  This is a very drinkable beer. The taste isn't as hoppy as the smell would make you think, but it's still delicious.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",Imperial IPA,98

Pours a lovely pale golden amber, mine very clear for Bell's so I must not have stirred up the bottle much, with a creamy white head leaving nice curtains of oily lacing.  Wow, the smell is incredible, the finest nose I believe I've experienced yet. Juicy is the first thing that comes to mind, juicy clean hop smell of pineapple, orange and grapefruit. A little grassy and very clean and fresh.  The taste is exceptional too, there is a muted malt presence, just enough to allow the hops to shine but more than sweet enough to balance the hops. Luscious citrus and pine flavors in equal amounts, with a taste of honey and just a touch of alcohol warmth on the nicely bitter finish. Lord, the glass is half empty already!  Mouthfeel is also perhaps the finest I've encountered so far. Smooth, smooth smooth, medium bodied and creamy with moderate carbonation.  Drinkability, well for a 10% abv beer I can't believe the glass is dissapearing so fast. This is awesomely drinkable and highly recomended.

The bottle says 10% ABV and after a few sips I want to question that.  a- I very nice burt orange color with tons of bubbles coming from the bottom of the glass. Little to no head with very heavy lacing.  s- Citrus and Grapefruit, mainly grapefruit and some honey sweetness. I wish they could make this into a air freshener.  t- Sweet tartness of what I guess is the honey with a nice refreshing hop character that tastes like grapefruit and orange or tangerine. the 10% ABV is no where to be tasted in this beer!  m- Wonderful sticky an oily with a very light syrupy taste that goes down easy.  d- I could drink this beer till I am completely stupid. Like I keep saying I can't believe that this beer is 10%.

Bitter/tart overall. The 10% ABV is hidden fairly well.. just a slight sting from it at the end.. it meshes well with the bitter hops.  M - Thick bodied, low carbonation.

The aroma isn't very powerful and I'm not sure if it's because the beer is a couple months old. Definitely has a decent hop bitterness bite, lacks in hop flavor. It's there but I'm not very impressed with it. The alcohol is subdued, which is nice and it has a nice mouthfeel and not too heavy in body. There is a balance of some malt sweetness there that helps out.  Overall, I think it's a hyped up beer and I definitely don't think it's worth the money.

There's a very slight alcoholic hit in the end, but beer is an alcoholic drink and I don't think the alcohol always needs to be completely hidden. The caramel malt really shines. This one is definitely hop nectar.  T: Delicious caramel malt and honey flavors provide an excellent backdrop for the huge hop flavor. The sweetness is there, and there's very, very little alcohol in the flavor for a 10% abv beer. The hop flavors are tangerine, grapefruit and a bit of wildflowers.  M: The mouthfeel is excellent. It's smooth and syrupy in a good way. It has that great hop oiliness of big DIPAs.  D: It's an easy to drink 10% abv, but it's still a big beer and you feel that to some extent.

A wonderful hazy copper color with a fluffy white had that subsides leaving a single horizontal rim with vertical spokes. A very unusually consistent pattern  The aroma is best described as sweet. I'm pulling for some of that citrus/pine/floral/grapefruit that I look for in hop bombs but all I come up with is sweetness. A little swirling and I get a touch of malt and fruit.

287,17112,rasta16ry,4.5,"Most of the reviews here seem to agree that HopSlam is awesome, but I'm going to review this anyway so I can remember it since I can't get my hands on this that often.  I cooled this off and then poured it in one of those Sam Adams bubble glasses. It had a nice light head and really looked like a great beer sitting in the glass. The smell was very hoppy and had a little alcohol to it, and not much sweetness at all. Maybe a little fruit in there as well. With the picture on the bottle, I was pretty much ready to have my face hopped off (!).  Well it is definitely good. I think that maybe it is a great beer. The hops hit you nicely at the beginning, followed by some further bitterness and a little kind of alcohol taste, and at the end I get some more hops and even a little sweetness. There is also some fruit in the taste, but I didn't really sense any pine but some other sweetness. It's not really a malty kind of sweetness but a bit of honey, like the description says, and I think it really compliments the hops quite well.  This is not an overly complex beer, but it is executed I think almost as well as it could be. I really super enjoyed drinking this; I had it with homemade linguine and white clam sauce, and it paired really well (despite the fact that I know nothing about pairing). It is crisp, with a good body but not heavy, a nice palate transition and overall just a great feel to it.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",Imperial IPA,98
287,17112,jminsc76,2.83,"And that friend alex3891 is referring to (i.e., me) gives the HopSlam a comparable rating and review.  It pours a very impressive, large head - thick and bubbly - giving one the impression they may be about to experience something spectacular. The hops swirl and dance as you pour. Excellent lacing down the glass as the head dissipates. The body is a slightly reddish orange and quite attractive. The carbonation dances as you open it up.  The taste anticipation is heightened as the smell is fresh and hoppy, with hints of vanilla and butterscotch. Malty aromas as well. But then I taste it, and, well, not much. As I continue sipping, I hope more will come through than the slightly hoppy and malty flavors that match the characteristics of the aromas, but not the aromas' intensity. It's hoppy, it's bitter, but there isn't a lot of oomph! to it. The taste exists, and that's all it does. There's no punch-in-the mouth the way an Imperial IPA typically delivers.  The sight is exceptional, the smell is as well, but the taste is, well, nada mucho. The only thing truly redeeming this beer from total disappointment is how I feel from its 10% ABV. That makes me rather feel rather benign. And similar to alex3891's review, I too am trying to understand how this beer received the ratings it did.

287,17112,ommegoose,4.05,"Batch 8912, which puts this at roughly 2 months.  Orange, some haze. Busy carbonation. Half inch of head sticking at the top. Even sheets of lace. Well done.  Bright citrus aroma. Sweet, with light fruit. A lot of hops, but they don't have their edge right now.  Very citric flavor. Sweet at first with lots of fruitiness, sweet grapefruit, pineapple. Decently malty. Bitterness and pure hop flavor seem quite a bit muted already. It's not puckering in the slightest. Not what I would call a hop bomb at this point. Piney notes not to be found. Herbal/grassy aftertaste. Just a little dryness in the finish, along with what must be honey. Alcohol is masked decently. You won't mistake it for a sessionable brew, as it doesn't take long to hit home. Had another bottle, and found that the warmer served, the better.  A bit tingly, but pretty smooth. Nice.  Well, this is good and all. The hype was so overwhelming, though. For a beer that costs this much, I feel like I should be getting something a bit more special. 90 Minute is a better value, and a better beer, imo. If I need to get this within a few weeks to fully enjoy it, that kind of sucks. Can I drink it? For sure. I'm underwhelmed, but in the minority.

287,17112,CrellMoset,4.15,"On tap at Beer Run. Always nice to try a beer like this on tap and see how it stacks up to the bottled version. Served in a 10 oz. brandy snifter.  Appearance: Pours a clear, crisp, golden orange bodied brew, capped by a slightly off-white, foamy head of above-average retention. Fine bubbled and sparse carbonation is evident if you hold it up to the light, creeping slowly upwards. The lacing is similarly impressive, spongy and sheetlike, and very attractive.  Aroma: Huge hops, but did you expect anything different? Enormous, juicy pineapple and ruby red grapefruit notes, backed up by gigantic spicy pine, hints of mint and earthy herbal notes, and a sweet, earthy, syrupy malt backbone. The honey definitely comes through, complete with hints of a clove-like spice. A faint kiss of darker roast in the finish.  Taste: Moderate to moderately-heavy bitterness, in case you were wondering what 100+ IBUs tastes like. A beautiful spicy pine and lightly tart grapefruit zest combo, honey-like and pale malts, a faint bready, doughy roast, orange zest, and other miscellaneous tart notes round it out. Delicious.  Mouthfeel: Not as thick as it probably should be, given that it's made with enough honey and malt to back up the hop schedule while still being drinkable. There's plenty of prickly, light effervescence, too, resulting in a slightly crisp but slightly uneven mouth.  Drinkability: At 10.0% abv, this one's (of course) not one to take lightly, but no need for me to tell you that - the flavors make that known easily enough. One of the classics, and deservedly - it's a tasty, aromatic hop monster, surprisingly quaffable, gorgeous, and a delight to the senses.

The head dissapates fairly quickly. There is medium carbonation.  S - Smells like a ripe grapefruit. Very hoppy but subtle hints of citrus sweetness, not the typical pine smell of a west coast IPA.  T - Very balanced. The hops are ever-present but letting the beer sit in your mouth a bit, you notice that the malt is there as well. There is no bitter aftertaste, finishes clean and slightly sweet.  M - Just the right amount of carbonation for a beer this big. It is thick, borderline syrupy.  D - Extremely drinkable.

Halfway through the head was almost completely gone along with the lacing. The final product looked like a glass of honey.  Wow... extremely pungent floral hops are the predominant scent. There is a slight sweetness. The hops are mouth-watering.  The taste is equally impressive. Citrus bitterness and floral hops are kept in check with sweet honey. It's a great balance of over-the-top hops without being overly bitter.  The mouthfeel is a medium body and chewy. There's a slightly bitter grapefruit finish. It leaves the palate feeling clean and fresh, but I definitely won't be tasting anything else tonight.  There is a slight burn of alcohol, but who can blame them with this weighing in at 10%. For such a high abv it's hidden well enough and considering that, it's drinkability is impressive.  Simply put, this is a phenomenal example of an IIPA. Honestly, I can only think of one IIPA that I'd put ahead of this, but I'm not going to mention it's name out of respect for the Hopslam.

However, it left a good coating of lacing on the side of the glass.  Aroma is all hops. Very fragrant. Floral with the scent of apricots.  The taste is of aggressive, flowery hops. Finishes with a good bit of bitterness. I can definitely taste the high alcohol content, but alcohol is not overly predominant.  Mouthfeel is tricky on this one. The beer has a medium body, but the bitterness from the hops coats my mouth to the point where this beer gives the perception of being much heavier than it really is. Taking another sip actually seems to clean the palate.  Overall, a very pleasant beer. I've read much about Hopslam, but have not yet had the opportunity to try it. Now that I have, I can say the reviews are correct.

287,17112,DannyS,4.42,"Aquired via the amazing graciousness of the clerks at the Foodery in North Philadelphia.  Served in a tulip glass, poured from a 12 oz. bottle.  A - A medium amber with a thin head that goes away quick. Seems unassuming from the look.  S - Whoo...fruity, floral, sweet, supremely hoppy. One of the strongest smelling beers I've ever had. The malty sweet smell even reminded me of that pink amoxicillin liquid i had as a kid when i got sick...I loved that pink stuff.  T - My first sip was subtly hoppy. My second sip whacked me in the mouth with a hop grenade. Subsequent sips are yeilding one of the most balanced IPA's I've had yet. It's very sweet and floral-hoppy on the palate, but the bitterness goes away quick. Absolutely crazy.  M - medium weight on the tongue, smooth carbonation. works well for a double IPA.  D - Scary. Duvel-like in drinkability. This beast hides the alcohol so well i could barely taste it. The only thing holding this back from perfect 5 is the bitterness. Either way, if I wanted to get wasted quick, I could easily have one or two of these. More than that might dry my mouth out too much, and I would never disrespect this beer by not taking the time to savor it.  overall - Truly an experience in of itself. I'm so glad I got a chance to taste this gem. I was impressed by the masterful hoppyness, but I was even more impressed by how well the alcohol is masked.

287,17112,ahalloin,4.51,"The first of a long line of great cask beers at the ""Casks of March"" event at Rustico in Northern VA. Had to get it quick because it was gone in 40 minutes!  Poured a cloudy dark golden color with little to no head of only large bubbles. Very opaque in nature, in that it didn't reflect light in the traditional way most beers do.  For a hophead, the aroma was the epitome of a greatness. It was almost like to I rounded up a few varieties of hop plants and then picked off the flowers and mashed them in the palm of my hand while inhaling. Positively breathtaking! Heavy citrus and pine notes, with doses of light toffee as a background. Somewhat medicinal. Almost a peach peel sweet and tart mixture.  The mouthfeel was understandably smooth. Virtually no carbonation. Am I drinking grapefruit juice mashed with pine sap? I mean that in the best way possible!! The taste had that peachy quality, citrus, and a bitter burning sensation through the finish.  Awesome beer!",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",Imperial IPA,98
287,17112,bwd110,4.17,"Batch #8908  Poured into Sam Adams Perfect Pint Glass  A - Light, murky golden brown, aggressive pour only yielded .5"" off white head. Head sustained a little while and faded.... Nice lacing throughout. This beer even looks like its going to slam you with hops  S - Honey, sweet fruits, some malt, and holy hops! Very floral and citrusy presence  T - Love this flavor, hops hit you immediately with large floral presentation followed immediately by the honey. Only a hint of the malt backbone then quickly fades into a citrus hops bitter ending. Definitely a lot of alcohol warming going on here.  M - This one has some body to it and certainly covers the tongue. Certainly not unpleasant. A little carbonation zap on the tongue, but not too bad.  D - Because of the balance of the honey and malt against the extreme hoppiness, this one is surprisingly drinkable. Be careful!  Terrifically brewed beer, this is one of the ones you keep going back to year after year,",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",Imperial IPA,98
287,17112,jlb307,4.77,"HopSlam? Ought to be called HotDamn!!! Poured from the 12 oz. bottle into an oversized wine glass.  A: It was like looking at a glass full of clover honey. Clear for the most part, with just a hint of cloudiness. Had about 1/2 inch of head which was nice, white, and thick. Beautifully laced the glass.  S: What can I say that hasn't already been said. Full of hops, pine, and sweet fruit. Just enough maltiness for balance. I could smell it the second I cracked it open. Hint of the alcohol, but not too much.  T: Just like it smells which is why it didn't disappoint. Almost no aftertaste with a smooth clean finish. Just as you take a sip, you get a hit of how floral this brew can be. I found tastebuds I didn't even know I had!  M: A bit thicker than I was hoping for, on the syrupy side. Not too much carbonation made it very comfortable, for lack of a better term.  D: So easy to drink, you forget just how much a six pack would cost!

287,17112,Pencible,4.17,"Just had this on cask at Rustico last night for their Glassware Giveaway event. Poured with no head, and was a hazy brushed gold color. Smelled fantastic. Ultra fresh hops, super clean, pineapple dominates, but also hints of pine and sour apple, solid honey sweetness. Taste is along the same lines as the smell. Definitely pure and clean hops, but not the exact flavor I enjoy best in a 2IPA. That's what kills this beer vs the hype for me. It's brewed excellently and tastes great, but just isn't my favorite flavor. Sweet honey malt helps balance the bitterness and makes it easier to drink, but it's still more of a sipping beer. Body was a little thick, but not as much as I was expecting from the cask. Basically no carbonation, and lasting bitterness in the aftertaste. Alcohol is nicely hidden, almost too well. Not sure if cask is worth the hype over regular tap? Overall, this was a pleasure to drink, but still not my favorite beer in the world.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",Imperial IPA,98
287,17112,DefenCorps,4.82,"On cask last night at Rustico.  Cask Hopslam pours a suffuse orange with a mild haze and not much head, surprisingly so. That, though, is the only disappointing about this beer. On the nose, there's a brilliant hop character, prominent and complex with pine and tropical fruit - pineapple, orange, mango. Just brilliant. On the palate, this beer is just brilliant. All the hops come through spectacularly. Light in body with a bit of sweetness that balances the hops really well, this beer is a treat. The cask conditioning of this beer really takes it to another level with a soft and creamy mouthfeel. And the drinkability? My first pint lasted 10 minutes.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",Imperial IPA,98
287,17112,cowens22,4.44,"Bottle poured into Duvel snifter. Poured a murky golden copper color with a one finger quickly diminishing head. Smell of citrusy hops with some floral and small malt undertones that almost leaves a sweet taste on the back of your tongue. Quite possibly the best nose that I have ever experienced. For a double IPA, the mouthfeel is a little thin for my expectations. Taste of a normal double IPA, citrusy hops a thin malt body that leaves a sweet aftertaste maybe a little caramel is in there. Very drinkable beer.  This is my first experience with Hopslam and to be honest, with all of the build up and rave reviews on message boards and from word of mouth, I was underwhelmed by this one. I am not saying that this is a bad beer by no stretch of the imagination. I am just saying that I felt that it didn't live up to the hype that is hovering around this one. The aromas that this one gives off is a reason to fall in love with this beer. It is by and far the best smelling beer that I have had the privilege of experienced. There are other double/imperial IPA's that I would choose over this one despite the incredible nose that this creates.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",Imperial IPA,98
287,17112,macktbone,4.58,"A- a thicker than normal IPA. Little head.  S- Crisp blend of hops that combine well. Citrus, pineapple.  T- Grain, caramel, complicated total package. I can't figure it out but the complexity is alluring.  M- Creamy and thick...much closer to what one would expect from a much darker beer.  D- I'm done and where did it go? I will have more when I get the chance.  So busy trying to recover some points from not catching the flavors right away that I drank all my HopSlam.

Light amber in color, this beer surprises you with its complexity. The aroma is of very fresh hops. You don't so much smell the grapefruit, citrus, and pine as you do the perfect blend of hop goodness.  As ridiculous as this sounds, this is a ""balanced"" DIPA. Of course, the hops dominate, but you can taste the rest of the beer as well, the base malt and a hint of caramel. You can feel the alcohol warmth but don't really taste it. Dangerous.  The freshness of the hop flavor is amazing. I can imagine what this beer is like freshly tapped. Once again, the freshness of the hops overwhelms the distinct ""types"" of hop flavors.

It's a beautiful honey-golden color with a thick dark white head that sticks to the glass the whole way down. It reeks of floral hops and citrus in the best possible way. A little sweetness and alcohol in the smell as well. The taste is remarkabley smooth considering the alcohol content. Grapefruity, hoppy, pine tree, and a touch of sweetness come together to form the best IPA I've ever had. Its medium body and texture is close to perfect and it's quite easy to drink.

S: Man, this smells so hoppy and bright. Full of grapefruit, pine, pineapple. The aroma just bursts from the bottle when the cap is popped.  T: Very similar to the aroma, but amped up about a thousand notches. Just so juicy, and full of hoppy goodness. The flavors absolutely explode once they hit the taste buds.  M: Thick and creamy, coats the inside of mny mouth and won't let me forget how good it tastes. Carbonation is spot on.  D: Drinkable? Uh, yea. Very. 10%? Can't taste it.

287,17112,JohnQVegas,4.42,"4-22-10 (rating)  Bottle into Sam Adams sensory glass. Another thanks to Jeff (AleWatcher) for yet another hoppy treat!  Pours slightly pale golden-copper, off-white creamy head that settles into a creamy thin cap with nice lacing.  Nose is big and hugely floral, lots of pungent tropical fruit and citrus rind, noticeable boozy alcohol as well. No malt to speak of breaking through; this one feels like it held up well. About a 4.3, tone down the booze and it's solidly in the 4.5 range.  Taste follow the nose - big time floral hops, loads and loads of pungent tropical fruit with a sharp bitterness that never overwhelms, just wheelbarrow loads of hop flavor. You sense the malt body more than you actual detect it, with just a bit of light caramel sweetness peeking out towards the finish. Finish itself is long, pungent, with the same array of hop flavors lingering like shadows. Quite tasty, and much improved over my experience with last year's edition. Jeff stored this from day 1 in a refrigerator, which seems to have made a big difference - this could be a fresh release and I would never have known the difference.  Mouthfeel is inline with last year - just a bit syrupy with plenty of carbonation. Big finish, plenty of booze, very tasty. Holds up very favorably despite the syrupy-ness.  Drinkability gets reevaluated, though - even with all the booze, the flavor level on this one delivers. Delicious beer that rose and surprised me with how fresh and vibrant it was. Top notch!  3-9-09  Bottle into red wine glass. Thanks Uwftke26!  Pours the color of polished copper, a glowing hazy gold-orange, with foamy moderate off-white head that fades quickly.  Nose is grapefruit rinds and a big floral note, almost herbal. All hops, with a bit of sweet caramel malt behind trying to break through. A bit of piney astringency as well.  Big and bold on the tongue, carbonation may be a touch aggressive. Some caramel up front, underneath a slightly astringent big, heavy rind-like citrus bitterness. both aspects seem to grow towards the finish, the caramel getting bigger and more intense and the astringent hop note pairing with the citrus to really explode on the swallow. A bit of alcohol heat comes through as well. Finish is long, bitter.  Mouthfeel is fairly sharply carbonated, a bit syrupy.  Overall, disappointed in this one. Granted, this one isn't quite fresh - but the big flavors seemed a bit disjointed, and lacking in complexity and subtlety. The huge sweetness coupled with the piney astringency was a bit much in this one. Would have like for the massive sweetness to have been toned down just a bit.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",Imperial IPA,98
287,17112,lincoln44,4.85,"A- Like the label but the pour could have been more impressive. Color is similar to two heated ale; pale straw color yellow. Very little head with the pour but may be attributed to the temp of my refrigerator.  S- Heaven. Bell's has done a great job of balancing this beer. The hops are an obvious nose filling aroma but the malt is worthy of mention as well. Makes me smile when I know I will soon be drinking this olfactory stimulating elixir.  Taste- As worthy as the smell. This beer is balanced between pine, citrus, and floral hops. The honey addition to the fermentation leaves its own sweetness to the taste of the beer. I think the sweetness of the honey makes the bitterness even more enjoyable. The beer is initially sweet when it hits the tongue but quickly gives way to the hops and slight warmth of alcohol. Not a hot alcohol taste but ever so slightly warming on the finish.  M- Seems to be sweet and slightly thick at first but the hops and carbonation come through with an enjoyable bitterness and effervescent cleaning of the palate.  D- Exceptional drinkability for a beer of this style. I am going to enjoy my six pack while it lasts but at $16 a sixer I will not be drinking this on a regular basis, even though I would really like to.

287,17112,Baileyuk,4.44,"Reviewed from notes so sorry if brief.  A - Good head although it dissapeared fairly fast. Lacing was weak at first but improved dramatically as the beer warmed a little.  S - Sweet fruity hops, maybe some summits although I have just started to pick up varieties. A slight pineness in the nose also.  T - A piney smell of the bat, developed into a sweeter finish, then back to pine. Very pleasant. An intense hop tast for sure but not as overpowering as I was expecting ((which I was happy about)  M - Heavy on the pallette, lingering taste from the hops.  D - Its 10%, but maybe good for 2.

A- Yellow in color with a beautiful off white head that sticks around and leaves lacing all the way down. I was a bit upset a whole hop cone didn't come out:)  S- This beer smells so amazing, the instant I cracked the top the smell hops came pouring into my nose. Just beautiful, by far the most enjoyable smelling beer I've had. I can't smell anything besides the hops, no alcohol aroma what so ever.  T- Probably the best tasting Imp IPA I've ever had. The spring to life when they hit the tounge, and they never let go in the after taste. The honey is noticeable, and really does a great job balancing the beer, but in all the hops win that battle. I havent tried too many Imp IPA's I must say that it's not my favorite sytle but this beer is delicious.  D- It's surprisingly drinkable, the alcohol content is high and it sneaks up on you. This is a beer where one is enough for me, which is a good thing in my opinion.  Hopslam is a great beer but it makes my wallet ache. I'm more partial to regular IPA's so I'd probably only buy this once a year.

T- Grapefruit, sweet, finishes with a moderate hop bitterness. Not nearly as shocking or harsh as other DIPAs I've had. Just a hint of malt in there. Very good. Hardly any alcohol.  M- Creamier than I thought it would be, still smooth and clean. Slightly prickly from the hops and alcohol--refreshing almost.  D- Couldn't drink a ton of these with the high ABV, but definitely could have more than one.  This is great.

287,17112,Domingo,4.33,"Thanks to kirok1999 for this one. I've been waiting to try this for some time. Pours a dark golden color with a big fluffy head. For a 10% brew, the lacing and head are pretty amazing. Smells like a hop bomb...as expected. However, it's far more reminiscent of the west coast pineapple/grapefruit hops. Taste starts off a little sweet, like more DIPAs, with all of the hops taking on the sweetness and showcasing their flavors. Lots of tropical fruits, citrus, and a little pine. As the finish kicks in, the sweetness carries through the whole time. I bet we have the honey to thank for that. It surprisingly doesn't end up as being too sweet and it really just holds everything together. For a 10% abv beer, you'd never know it. The sweetness comes across as more of the honey flavor than a high alcohol booziness, and the texture is just great. I polished off a bottle and could've easily had 2 or more. My wife finished hers inside 10 minutes. One of the most drinkable beers of it's strength that you'll ever encounter.  Cheers to Bell's with this one!

As soon as you open the bottle you get smacked in the face with the hops (hence the cool picture on the bottle).  It pours a clear, golden color and produces an average white head and decent lacing.  First taste is extreme bitterness and then strangely enough, grapefruits of all things.  It fades pretty quickly and finishes pretty smooth with an impressive aftertaste/mouthfeel.  The alcohol is well hidden and much appreciated after a couple of these. I plan on grabbing another six pack for some cellaring.  Nice beer!

It goes down extremely well, better than I thought it would. The alcohol is there, but hidden very well for the 10% ABV. Mouthfeel is prtty bitter and acidy, in a good way.

Considering the ABV, I'm impressed by how many flavors are present. The primary taste is of grapefruit and citrus. Hints of honey as well.

I am from Oregon, and can't get this stuff anywhere... so I sent off some Hop Henge and Slipknot among others for this tasty number. 12 oz. bottle. Got more than I expected, and I appreciate that.  At first, I couldn't smell much when I opened the bottle.. but after I poured it into my tumbler glass...  Nice cloudy unfiltered appearance.. mild yellow/orange almost like a hefe.. great lacing all over..  Smell is of pungent hops, a bit of bread and rye.. not so much malt... I love that.. less malt, more hop... the better. That's why I especially like rye's I guess. Does have some sweet honey scent too... they must actually use a lot of the stuff! Save the bee's!  Taste is a robust honey hop delight, a bit chewy and sweet... but perfectly blended with some fine hops that caught me off guard. I though no beer could touch what we have over here in the great pacific northwest.. but this is good. I couldn't imagine what this ale would taste like though once towards the bottom of a keg... it's right at that point.

I'm from Michigan (although I've never been to Bell's), and it makes me proud that beer is one thing my state does right. It stands up well to all other IPAs that I've been able to drink, including my all-time favourite, Deuchar's IPA. It's a shame this beer is only available in January and February. I personally have stocked up.  Appearance - beautiful amber colour. Exactly as an IPA should be. Not as dark as some IPAs, but it really looks like a beer that begs to be drunk immediately.  Smell - fantastic. Grapefruit, hops, a touch of honey. You have to appreciate the smell of this beer with each sip you take, or else you aren't doing it justice.  Taste - amazing for the win. I'm a bit of a hophead, but this beer makes me wonder if I should ever drink lagers again. Plain and simple. It has an extremely hoppy bite at first, but the finish is sweet in just the right way - not overpowering, but not too bitter at all, either.  Mouthfeel - creamy and smooth. When poured right, you get the perfect head and foam consistency. It should be served at optimum beer temperature, not ice cold - if you have one in your fridge, be sure to let it sit out for 20-30 minutes before pouring.  Drinkability - you will be surprised for a beer that's 10% abv. You can't even taste alcohol at all. It drinks more like a 12%, though, in terms of intoxicating effect. I swear - this beer hits you hard. Haha, but in a good way. Proceed with caution if using for a session.  Basically, if it's available, drink it and enjoy it. You won't be disappointed.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",Imperial IPA,98

287,17112,goatgoat,4.5,"Pours a clear sunflower gold, with slight orange highlights. Head is a full 3 fingers of perfectly white foam. Head retention is moderate. Leaves sticky lace all over. Aroma is thick with pineapple. Lighter citrus and a little floral and resinous. Taste is big hops. Sweet malt body is very well done, light but enough to prevent any harshness in the bitter character. It even hits the back of the palette during the finish. But this is really all hops. Hops up front, in the middle and a nice clean bitterness that lingers. Medium light mouth with good amounts of carbonation. Lighter than other DIPAs I've had, very nice. But still has that oily hop character which I enjoy.  For me, what sets this DIPA apart from the rest is the malt balance (just enough) and mouthfeel (light). It's a very easy to drink DIPA.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",Imperial IPA,98
287,17112,bluemoonswoon,4.69,"12oz bottle poured into a tulip glass.  One of the absolute most beautifully crafted beers available today, the smell alone is enough to make a case for this being the best thing in the world. The mouthfeel is smooth and silky that belies the bitterness and is further offset by the honey sweetness added into this beer, which while it adds an interesting element to the beer, takes a bit away from the overall hop experience. Still though, this is one of the most astounding beers I've ever had the pleasure to cross my palate. And drinks far far lower than the 10% would ever indicate, be careful or you could see a six pack of this disappear in a night, even without a friend.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",Imperial IPA,98
287,17112,Jerzdevil1116,4.79,"12 oz bottle purchased at Capone's in Norristown, PA. Drank from a pint glass.  A: Clear golden body with two fingers of fluffy white head. Steady stream of bubbles rising in the glass. Left some lacing on the glass.  S: Smell is a bouquet of hops. Notes of citrus, pine, florals and a surprise: pineapple. Maybe the faintest caramel malt presence.  T: Just as I expected; full of hops. Pretty bitter with a mild honey sweetness. Also has a noticible alcohol presence.  M: Medium to full body. Smoothe.  D: Very enjoyable. Although full of hops, it never became overly bitter. I liked the unique hint of honey that offset the hops. There is a definite alsohol presence, but never overwhelming. I would have given the drinkability a five if not for the 10% alcohol content that started to creep up on me.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",Imperial IPA,98
287,17112,taylorhamrick,4.06,"Pours out an orange color, almost amber. Very perfectly clear, with a 1cm white head, with minimal lacing. Looks just to style, I like the appearance. The smell is filled with fruity hops, and the honey sweetness is very present. There's also the entire range of hoppy smells in there, which is nice: orange zest, herbal, floral, earthy, leafy. Very nice, but not the most completely overwhelming nose of hops. The taste is very rich. I get loads of fruity hops with quite a nice grapefruit sweetness. The bitterness isn't actually overpowering - I can find some balance here, and there is plenty of hop flavor. I love the late hops. The taste of the honey on my tongue is really nice, adds a bit of complexity to go with the hops. The mouthfeel is right about what you'd expect, full of hops, nice carbonation, not much of an alcohol burn. I found myself diving back for sip after sip, and the 10% didn't hit me until the end. I wish I could've gotten my hands on it back in January, but more than happy to have it now.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",Imperial IPA,98
287,17112,1fastz28,4.47,"pours a nice honey color without much of a head. it doesn't have a lot of carbonation, and the small head dissipates quickly, sort of anti-IPA of it. smell is great, has a wonderful piney hop aroma to it, maybe even a hint of mango to it, according to my fiancee. taste is really good, has a distinct bitterness to it of course but also has a strange mild maltiness to it, the higher alcohol content definitely warms me up. we just started to get bells in this area so i look forward to trying their other beers.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",Imperial IPA,98
287,17112,Jekster,4.92,"Appearance: This beer pours a beautiful crystal clear amber with a pure white white fluffy head. The head settles rather quickly to a nice contrasting white lacing.  Smell: The aroma is of beautifully sticky citrus: grapefruit, star fruit, lemon, and orange. There are notes of floral spice of pine resin and dried orange zest. Along with these components is a beautifully balance sharp sweet aroma of fresh honeycomb. The aroma has beautiful depth and is pleasant to take in huge lung filling breaths.  Taste: Taste begins with a subtle but present clover honey sweetness that fades into a sticky hop presence on the mid palette. Flavors of bitter pine are accompanied by light sweet and tart citrus bite. As you swallow you are hit with a second wave of savory honey and a lingering hop bitterness that is firm but not overpowering. As the flavors begin to fade you are left with a satisfying alcohol warmth as the beer trickles down your throat.  Mouthfeel: This beer is medium to full bodied with a creamy slickness. The beer ends with a remarkably dry finish given the body and does linger or feel heavy on your palette.  Drinkability: This is a fine beer meant to be slowly sipped and enjoyed throughout the evening. That being said, it does not feel heavy on my palette despite strong flavors and body. I could easily sit around on the weekend and drink quite a few of these as I talked with some good friends.  Overall Impression: This is a fine beer that provides a wonderful balance between sweetness and boisterous hop character. The hops are definitely showcased which is nice to see in an IIPA. Yet, the induction of honey provides a level of depth and mouthfeel that adds to the complexity of the beer without taking away from the pungent hop character. This is without a doubt my favorite IIPA to date and I would recommend it to any beer lover, hop head or not, simply because of the fine craftsmanship that must be involved in creating such a fine product.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",Imperial IPA,98
287,17112,TLove,4.25,"The smell and initial taste is similar to eating a good, pungent French cheese. The hops hit you up front and finishes sweet and runny, as opposed to the initial subtlety of the Stone Ruination IPA, which finishes more peppery and bitter.  The color does not impress, but the beyond the hopslam (pun intended) there are a bit more hints of grapefruit, pine, and honey. They run perpendicular to the promise made in the back of the bottle to be a ""biting, tongue-brusier of an ale"".  The alcohol is well disguised in the rewarding finish as well, concealing a 10% ABV with class.  Recommended for anyone who likes a powerful hop punch up front, but a smooth, honey-ale finish.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",Imperial IPA,98
287,17112,largecar73,4.69,"Poured from a 12oz bottle into a tulip, batch # 8911.  A: Golden amber in color with some carbonation bubbles streaming up. Got about a one finger head that didn't stick around long, lacing was decent.  S: Wow what a smell! Piny with citrus fruits, and some caramel malt in the background, but mostly hops.  T: Another wow here! The hops grab you and pull you in, but that's not all this beer has going on. I do detect the honey, and the malt is here too. This is a fairly balanced DIPA.  M: Nice mouthfeel that's pretty similar to other DIPA's. Creamy, and a little oily but not overly thick.  D: Although I don't detect alcohol in the taste, at 10% this wouldn't be considered highly drinkable.  All in all this is an outstanding beer. Bell's hasn't let me down yet, and this one doesn't disappoint either. I'm glad I got a case so I can cellar some of this for a rainy day! So does this beer live up to the hype? In my opinion yes without question.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",Imperial IPA,98
287,17112,brewintheLou,4.67,"Wow... this was great. I had this one at Stable in St. Louis and it did not dissappoint. I have had out of a bottle and on tap. This, in my opinion was not too different. Like any beer out of a cask it was less carbonated, which is very good, and the flavor were more prevelant. Definitely had the grapefruit hop, and the honey finish on the end. I was lucky enough to get in on the ass end of the cask and the pour, and I do mean pour as the spout had been removed at that point, was like a blond mud. It was an experience that I thoroughly enjoyed and hope to get the same next year.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",Imperial IPA,98
287,17112,gameface23,4.72,"Bottle in the mail courtesy of my best friend.  A: Pours a hazy honeyed gold with a pillow-like head. Lacing prevails.  S: Dank, resinous hop aroma with pineapple/grapefruit, some malt and honey sweetness and alcohol.  T: I picked up a lot of sweetness in this from the honey, but it was far from cloying. It's interesting drinking a beer that doesn't really solely on caramel malts for it's sweetness. The hops hold their own against the sweetness. They counteract the sweetness perfectly.  M: Creamy, & smooth. This is one of the more full-bodied IIPA's I have ever drank.  D: This is 10% ABV??

287,17112,khiasmus,4.15,"A long time in coming, this one. I wish the ground would look like the top of this beer in the morning, but one can always wish, it's been the same since childhood. I've seen snow but a few times in my life. It reminds me though. The thick sheet of lacing, like the window from inside a car. A cloudy orange, the glow from our wood stove as I was growing up. A ranch-style house, I think it sucked more heat out, that was the only warm room. It drops off after a couple minutes, looks like soap-bubble-jello, wiggling in the glass as I tap on the keyboard. And there it is, an immensely piney aroma, the christmas trees back before flame retardants, they used to crackle and pop merrily, looking for all the world like this glowing liquid in front of me, and the smell... so green, so pure... there's some citrus there, but mostly just that intense christmas-tree green, a note of soft alcohol and some sweetness in the back... honey, like the herbal tea as we watched dad shove the branches in. Funny how the house gets more cozy as the air outside cools. Were it this temperature in the summer, I would be hot. As it is, I'm happy... But the flavor disappoints a little after the nose. The hops arent as balanced... they come out as an intense bitterness, a flash of resin, but the alcohol is hotter than the nose suggested, it takes over the finish. The honey is sweeter as well, lending an imbalance in flavors (though not impressions). Thick. Thick and syrupy-sweet as it rolls down the throat and gives way to a warm, almost sickly finish. It's just too much. The ten percent is far too obvious. The honey is too in your face. The hops are imbalanced. I've had this beer three times, and each time I've been disappointed. Unearthly, as a strong IPA, destroys this oh-so-highly-rated beer. I don't dislike strong flavors, but this one does not come together well. It's not going to snow. I'm going to wake up to just another bleary day with some specks of ice on the bushes. And go to work.  EDITED after drinking a 9 day old bottle. I must say that she comes together much better. Still a little high on the sweetness and alcohol both, but it is a much more drinkable brew. Still not a 4.4 beer though. Adjusted score accordingly.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",Imperial IPA,98
287,17112,fosterific,4.29,"Had the traditional pale color of hazy golden blond with a nice 2 fingers of creamy white head that stayed around for the entire beer and left quite a bit of lacing. The smell is why I ordered the beer, I could seriously smell the beer from a meter away...So of course I have to inquire into this beer. Up close your nose is bombarded by citrusy hops, and it is hard to pick any other smells out. With that thick creamy foam still on top I dived in, who doesn't look cool with a beer foam mustache? The flavor had that sweet citrus flavor that I was expecting but was balanced with some bitter hops that made for a complex hop battle between bittering and aroma hops. The hopslam has a full bodied feel, very nice. Drinkablitiy is a little on the low end, cause I need to be able to function after...10%!

Sadly, a smokie environ impaired an already weak sniffer, but in between whaffs, the citusy hops came through. A fairly clear golden color with nairy a hint of carb but sticky lace clings to the glass throughout. Nice hop bite yet creamy mouthfeel. The hops are piney yet the citrusy aspect and smooth mouthfeel make for a harmonic convergence of flavor. That was lame, but its accurate.

Nose is pungent: orange, grapefruit, pineapple, and piny all at once with a hint of caramel malts.  This brew delivers both sweet and bitter hop aromas and flavors--partly citric, but mostly bitter. Smooth mouthfeel resulting from the creamy/oily texture and low carbonation. And in addition to the light malt backbone, this beer can be easily consumed despite the 10% ABV.  Definitely a topnotch DIPA, but is it good enough to justify the ridiculous amounts of hype surrounding this beer?  Maybe.  There are many other DIPA's on the same level that are far more accessible.

Pours a light amber golden color with a half finger of frothy head that leaves gobs of retention on the sides of the glass. Smell is all grapefruit. I don't know how else to describe it but grapefruit citrus smell with maybe a hint of biscuitlike malt hidden deep. Taste is citrus hops up front(grapefruit, hints of banana and orange peel) followed seemlessly by smooth biscuitlike malts. Mouthfeel is medium bodied and not as dry as most DIPAs are. Drinkability is amazing for such a high ABV beer. Alcohol is perfectly hidden and kind of scary this could be so easy drinking. This is the best DIPA I've ever had, ever. This beer deserves a perfect 5. If this were available year round I'd stop trying new beers and this is all I would drink(at least for this style). In my opinion a perfect DIPA.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",Imperial IPA,98

With a fully hopped nose I smelled this three times before sipping because it really did fill the senses.  Taste and mouthfeel were fantastic, smooth, extreme hop just as expected and as experienced with both bottled and on-tap sessions. The cask/firkin pour was exceptional though and one to remember!! The smoothness and drinkability of this glass was certainly noteworthy and the full 12% ABV (don't believe the 10% on the bottle...), can surely be felt but not necessarily tasted and by no means overpowering the drink.  I felt fortunate to have this on cask, apparently only three will be served in a two state region and this happened to be just down the street; complete with a representative from Bell's to swing the mallet!

Taste: Very sweet with honey on the first sit, with a heavy dose of hops on the back-end. Very dry on the finish. Very sugary, strongly flavored with grapefruit. High astringency due to alcohol.  Mouthfeel: Thick but smooth, goes down clean. Moderate carbonation.  Drinkability: Not my all-time favorite DIPA, but I'm really curious to see how these age over time.

287,17112,PirateUlf73,4.32,"Poured into a tulip glass.  A: Slightly hazy golden-orange color with a bright white head. Retained pretty well and laced very nicely.  S: Do I have to say it. Very hoopy, mostly of a citrus variety, but I detect some sweet grassy notes as well. Also some notes of granny smith apples. Just a smidgen of malty sweetness manages to penetrate the wall of hops.  T: Surprisingly, not quite as hoppy as I expected, but that's just fine. Notes of citrus fruits, sweet grassy heather, puckering pine and a hint of caramel backbone. Definitely a hop bomb, but with a substantial malt taste to boot.  M: Heavy and thick, with moderately low carbonation. The beer massages the tongue nicely and finishes fairly clean, save a very bitter aftertaste.  D: A sipper that rewards taking it slow. May go well with a rich dinner dish.  This beer achieves a rare feat: being a balanced hop bomb. Yes, the hops are very much running the show, but I appreciated the strong malt character, which kept things from getting too crazy.

I've had this on tap a few times and always was extremely impressed although usually not in any condition to be reviewing anything.  First we see a golden reddish body with snowy, off-white head and impressive lace. The grapefruit and honey melange in the notice is exquisite, and unique enough, particularly for the style. Despite the name, this isn't a simple mushroom cloud of hops.  Wow, the honey is real powerful here, almost masking the hops and alcohol both, which would otherwise seem difficult to do. The aftertaste is strong grapefruit but not completely withering. The booze is understated but does still take a toll if you don't sip.

Malty base with accompanying tropical fruit notes - notably mango and peach.  Taste is similar to the nose. Grapefruit hops have a leafy green feel. Excellent citrus character with orange, apricot, and peach. Surprising amount of caramel malt and brown sugar sweetness for a DIPA. Finish is only modestly bitter, along with lingering citrus fruit.  Mouthfeel is medium bodied. Soft, and slick with hop oil.  A balanced beer that has a great deal of sweetness for the style. The high ABV is very well concealed. Drinks like an IPA, missing the aggressive nature I would expect from a DIPA. This does not taste like a hop monster or a 'big' beer.

It goes down extremely well, better than I thought it would. The alcohol is there, but hidden very well for the 10% ABV. Mouthfeel is prtty bitter and acidy, in a good way.

No sediment and fizz is noted in the transparent gold color.  The aroma is a amazing mix of grapefruit and pine, which is a testament to the hops. Some mild sweet grass notes are also present.  The taste is, as the aroma. There is a significant amount of citrus fruits and pine from the hops with a sweet malt hint present early. I am also picking up the grass clippings in the taste and it is good. The alcohol is well hidden.  The mouthfeel is a fairly full bodied beverage with a significant level of bitterness and dryness that sits on the palate. The carbonation highlights the flavor very well. It is smooth and goes down very well.  Overall, this is a very good beer.

Nothing pure hop bliss. Pine and citrus all the way. Taste? Well, what can I say? It's delicious. So much orange, grapefruit, and various citrus flavors backed up by some pine resin and a very solid, very sweet backbone. Do I like it better on tap? Well, probably not. The first time I had it out of the bottle (which my bottle review implies) was just magical. I can't see that first experience being topped. The only difference was lighter carbonation from the tap than from the bottle. Still fantastic, nonetheless.

T - Some malt of front but this is soon washed away but citrusy hops. Small amount of warming alcohol in the finish.  M - Very creamy and the carbonation is not overpowering.

Love it with the exception of the overly sweet aftertaste.  M: This guy is medium built, 5'8"", good.  D: Too many of these and I'd get slammed drunk.

The nose is so tremendous, I just had to share it with those sitting at the table with me, and all agreed - very hoppy and floral, with notes of fruit, especially pineapple. The taste didn't disappoint, with a great deal of fruity hops on the tongue right off the bat. Finishes off so smoothly that you'd never know about the high ABV.

The color was a deep reddish amber color with about an inch head. The nose was strong of hops and fruits. The taste was outstanding and tastes as good as it smells. It is often compared to Russian River's Pliny the Elder but Bells has been more consistent with flavor and appearance. The drink ability was excellent and I ended up having 3 glasses :). A highly recommended double IPA!",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",Imperial IPA,98

The white crown rises 1 finger high and is not quite as thick & creamy as other top-flight DIPA's, but still looks good. It was gone quickly, though, and settled to form a chunky halo while leaving loads of sticky lace behind.  A: Whoa! Aromatics just explode out of the bottle upon opening. One of the most explosively tropical-smelling DIPA's I've come across. Smells like sweet oranges, clementines, lots of peaches, melon, pineapple and caramel.  T: Triple IPA? Yeah, I'll go with that, wholeheartedly! Hopslam delivers a tsunami of citrus & tropical-flavored hops that brings tears to this hopheads' eyes. I swear, the malt is hardly even detectable underneath the onslaught of humulus lupulus. Seems to be more citrusy-sweet in the start with oranges, clementines, and tangerines. Then, tropical flavors burst onto the scene with peaches, melons, papayas, and pineapples. Caramel and a touch of honey lay underneath in supporting roles to help offset the intense hop attack. The IBU's have to be over 100, but somehow manage to be pretty gentle to the poor imbiber's tongue. It's more sweet in the start, but features a bitter dry finish that tingles the bitter region of the taste buds. Best of all, that whopping 10% ABV is undetectable aside from the slight warmth it provides to the back of the throat.  M & D: Medium-full bodied, thick & rich, and syrupy smooth. Drinkability is great, but that ABV is no joke!  Notes: This just may be the best DIPA that I've ever had the pleasure of drinking! I would stock up on this if I were in their distribution channels, for sure. In terms of DIPA's, they don't get any better than this. The sheer, unbridled brilliance that Hopslam delivers is absolutely amazing! Highly recommended",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",Imperial IPA,98
287,17112,Evan87,4.85,"Had this on cask at Uncle Mike's. Thanks Bells!  I love this beer on draft but I am in love with this beer on cask.  A - This beer is probably a little prettier on draft, but still a great lookig beer on cask.  S - Smells sweet and citrusy. Love the smell.  T - The cask version seems to mute the hop twang a little, but also hides the alcohol as well. Maybe hides it a little too much, if you know what I mean.  M - Smooth and creamy.  D - This exceptional beer was a delight to have on cask.

Taste starts with honey follows up with lemon and pineapple. The bitter's a little lower than I had hoped for. Not hot, but alcohol is there. Excellent body. Fine carb, well done. I seriously want more. Only thing against it is a slight taste of alcohol.  Overall: This is my favorite IPA at the moment. The pineapple is really awesome.

287,17112,schellsbeer,3.28,"Thanks to my friend Jim for buying me a pint at WB's this evening. Nice to find on tap here in our home town. Now, to the review...  A - Very nice. Pale yellow in coloring with a nice head.  S - Fruit and hops. Sweet smelling. A nice IPA but not the best.  T - Fruit with hops. I like a bitter IPA and this was a sweet IPA. Double IPA???? Not sure. According to BA, it is a double IPA but only because of the ABV was very high...not because of the flavor. Fruit dominates this beer. Bananas and Pineapple are very noticeable. Too much so if you ask me. Also, hops was not up to par. Hop Slam....not for me. More like a hop spittle. Was on tap so it was ultra fresh but not something that was over the top like most Imperial IPAs for sure.  M - Clean and refreshing but other than that....just good in my book.  D - High ABV and not that much hops, just average for me. Also, since this is only brewed on a seasonal level, not that impressive. I have had better. Sorry.  Now, before I get slammed from other BAs, remember this review is my opinion and not any one elses. I love bitter IPAs and this was not that bitter. Good at best. Will I seek this out? No, especially since I can get better IPAs at a much lower price. Just average in my book.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",Imperial IPA,98

287,17112,Brewno8it,4.97,"I have only had this wonderful beer on tap. Not complaining, the best way to get it if you can. The beer was poured in a classic Imperial Pint glass. The color was golden amber with a hint of a cherry color hue with a thick creamy head that clings to the glassware.  The smell is what I would describe as addictive. I wish I could find a candle to burn that smells as hoppy and complex as this brew. The beer smells of citrus and grapefruit with a nice whiff of sweetness.  The taste is so balanced of grapefruit, citrus, and honey. It has deep body and malty balance to blend with the herbal overtones.  The mouth has a feel of something so flavorful, balanced, and lightly carbonated that you want to hold it there forever. But swallowing does allow you to have a second pint!  It is hard to believe that this brew can be 10.2% alcohol. It is masterfully balanced and easy to drink. The aroma and feel are so wonderful that you can keep drinking. BE CAREFUL, it will sneak up on you because the alcohol is so ""disguised"" by the artistry within.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",Imperial IPA,98

I greatly enjoyed the smell with a nice bit of lemony hops, white pepper, and some buiscuity malt.  The flavor had a mild sweet biscuit and bready malt body with hints of pepper and alcohol finishing with a lightly minty and lemony bit of hops.  The mouthfeel was suprisingly thin for a beer of this strength and lacked a bit in the oily viscous quality that usually comes with a good double IPA.  I liked the flavor and found it extremely balanced and drinkable for such a big IPA, but I thought it was a bit underwhelming overall. I expected it to have a bit more pop to it and definitely more hops.

Almost no lacing, which was surprising.  S - Smells of delicious hops with a little citrus and a hint of pine. I thought it hid the 10% ABV well (though I was feeling it).  T - Delicious. A great citrus-hop flavor.  M - Fairly light beer with light carbonation. Lightly coated my mouth with its delicious flavor.  D - Save for the high ABV, this could nearly be a session beer for me.

Taste is a bitter sweet, a nice sweet flavor at first for me followed by a grapefruit bite in the end. Mouth feel is somewhat creamy, just the right amount of carbonation, and a lingering but pleasant oily feel. May be due to the very fine carbonation caused from swirling & the glass itself.

Tastes like sugar cookies dipped in hop oil. Plenty of sweetness and plenty of bitterness. Full juicy hop flavor, mainly pineapple, fruit salad, pine, and grass.

Smells like it will be crisp and clean.  T - Remniscient of three-month old Elder, so maybe it's even better fresh? It's citrusy, piney, slightly smoky, and sweet. The citrus is grapefruit and ripe orange rind.  M - Medium carbonation, full-bodied, with a clean finish. The alcohol burn is apparent, but forgiveable as this brew is at 10% abv.

287,17112,ahpark,4.42,"Got this in a trade with a buddy of mine. Poured into a pint glass, the appearance is a very tempting golden opaque color, exactly like that of expensive honey.  Smell is absolutely mouthwatering as well; notes of grapefruit, lemon, honey, and pine abound in this one. If I didn't know better, I'd think this was a piping hot cup of lemon tea with honey.  Taste was surprising; as this is a DIPA, I expected it to be an absolute hop-bomb, with an extreme hoppy aftertaste. However that's not the case, as this is one of the most balanced beers I've tasted. The sweet taste of honey and citrus plays off the hop aftertaste to create a beer that isn't overpowering in its hoppiness, yet isn't completely flavorless in that aspect. Honestly, it tastes more like a grapefruit spritzer or a soda rather than a beer. Amazing.  Mouthfeel is good as well, as there's a nice astringency that gives off a hint of grape skins at the end. Carbonation perfectly accentuates said astringency as well.  Drinkability is off the charts on this one; for a 10% ABV DIPA with supposed 130+ IBUs, I could see myself downing an entire sixer of these, easy.  Overall, very impressive beer.

Unfortunately in a plastic cup that appearance cannot really be appreciated, so if you want to know how great this beer looks check out some of the other reviews.

D- The first time I had this beer about a year ago I could barely make it through one, now I can fully appreciate what this beer is.

I can't remember the last time I saw so many smiles around one beer.  Hopslam, the seasonal Imperial IPA from Bell's, is freakishly fragrant. Lots of pineapple, grapefruit, and pine hit you in the face before you can even fully get your nose into the glass. Pineapple Express baby! The beer pours a warm sunshine orange and is mostly clear. With a solid one-finger head and some impressive lacing, Hopslam's aroma shoots right out of the glass upon swirling.  In terms of flavor, it tastes just like it smells - heavenly! Considering its name and bottle label (a man is seen being crushed by a hop flower) it is surprisingly smoother on the palate than you would think. This is in no way to insinuate a lack of flavor, either. In fact, this has more flavor than just about any other beer I've had. It stood up to the spicy nachos I was eating, so I imagine it will stand up to just about anything.  Overall impression is that my mouth is enormously happy every time I take a sip of this amazing IPA. I can assure you that it lives up to all the hype it's receiving, and I don't think it'd be too hard to say this is definitely my new favorite beer. The only drawback is its limited release, so get it fast and share it with a friend.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",Imperial IPA,98

Overall: The the mouth feel in the beer is medium body with carbonation and a bit of dryness. The finish is medium to light with some bitterness. This beer compared to a Stone Ruination, this big is its little sister. This beer is more like a big IPA, than a DIPA. Sorely disappointed, when I think of a DIPA is suppose to have strong intense hop flavor with a subtle malt backbone. This beer is no where near it. The hype to me is false.

287,17112,AKBelgianBeast,4.42,"Huge thanks goes out to a BA among BAs, joe1510 for sending these my way.  Pours a nice hazy orange cloudy color with a stark white head that retains pretty well and leaves nice lacing.  Nose is flat out west coast C hops. The honey does make its presence known with a slight sweetness, mixed in with the malt profile here in the nose.  Hmmm. A mighty fine ale, let me start with that. Taste starts our with some good malt sweetness that mixes well with the honey. The hops bitterness rises strong toward the finish. Big grapefruit and pine, more citrus and citrus zest. The honey adds a thickness to this im not sure of yet. Making its presence known mostly through the middle before the hops start to take the reigns, but the honey is not too much, just right. A nice bitter finish, good dryness. Hops and honey linger in the aftertaste, but again, hop dominant here.  Mouthfeel is very interesting. All around it is quite good, but there is a slight thickness through the middle, right where the honey comes out in the taste that is just slightly offputting, but really a minor flaw in a great beer. Carbonation is just right, and good dryness on the finish.  Drinkability is second to very few with the abv this one has it drinks far too easily. quite dangerous for us hopheads :)  Overall a very fine ale from Bell's. Defenitely one of the best mid west DIPAs, and probably in the top 10 or 15 in the nation/world. I like the honey presence aside from a slight thickness through the middle, but I really think it ads more to the beer than it takes away. Drinkability is defenitely where this one shines.

I could tell I was in for a citrusy hops explosion. I totally got it. This is the citrusy DIPA from my dreams. If it gets better than this then I have yet to see it. Totally worth the shipping costs.,Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",Imperial IPA,98
287,17112,baggio,4.4,"Bottle@home  Big thanks to Traquairlover for sending me a 6-pack of this much sought-after beer!  A: Golden orange with a big, white, head and lots of lacing.  S: Citric notes (lemon & grapefruit), caramel, Pine.  T: Citric notes, Honey, Caramel, Hint of exotic fruit, Pine, Hops.  M: Lots of bitterness upfront but ends with a nice touch of sweetness from the honey and malt. Balanced to perfection. Alcohol is extremely well hidden.  Not quite the fantastic beer i remembered it to be but still damn tasty. Extremely well balanced and quite sessionable despite it's 10%.

287,17112,BZero007,4.87,"I was at my local beer and wine store picking up some well known and great tasting IPA's when the clerk mentioned the Hopslam and how they sold out in hours. It was then my mission to find this beer that was so sought after in the NOVA area. A Total Wine in the area had one case that someone had just canceled. After picking up two six packs and letting it chill over night, i savored this gift from the beer gods and it made me sing.  A- Was a lovely glow of a Golden Amber and Orange, with a cloudiness that looked to carry much flavor.  S- Smell was of a allot of Hops and a strong background of Honey and citrus.  T- A taste you will not forget, literally. Strong tastes of Honey, Citrus, and Hops mix. Also fruit flavors that linger in the background. The first sip had me sign out loud of great beers. The next morning I still had the taste of the beer lingering in my mind.  Overall- This is up there on my top 3 IPA's. This beer honestly has such a personal flavor to it that you will remember it's flavor long after you are done.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",Imperial IPA,98
287,17112,adamhdv,4.5,"12 oz bottle into sniffer...  Pours a very bright golden orange with a cloudiness. Great 1.5 finger white head that thins to about .5 head. Lacing is perfect, top to bottle of glass, soapy like.  Smell, wow, reminds me a lot of FFF Alpha King in aroma. Citrus, grapefruit, hops are strong, not too strong though- about perfect.  Flavor is sweet grapefruit, perfect balance of strong pine hops and malt.Thought this would be more bitter, however its great how it is...clean and crisp on the palette.  Mouthful seems medium bodied and carbonated- smooth.  Refreshing and a easy to drink. At 10% ABV, watch out, its hidden very well...but I'm not complaining, it's very nice.  Props to Bells on this complex brew!",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",Imperial IPA,98
287,17112,coalcracker,4.62,"New review: 2011 batch Appearance: Medium gold in appearance with good head retention and lacing. Smell: A base of piney hops but peaches and pineapple also prevalent and well-defined. Honey more noticeable in aroma this time. Taste: Hops burst through andbuild slowly. Citric and grassy elements go along for the ride. Hops then again reappear and linger a bit through the end. Malts are a bit bready. Finish mildly bitter and just a tad soapy, but pleasant. Alcohol warmth presents but is deceptive. Mouthfeel: Medium to a bit on the thick side. Very smooth and a bit slick. Drinkability: Very deceptive ABV. Hop bitterness well-balanced. Overall- just a great beer- nothing lost in quality over the last tasting. Complex and tasty!  Appearance: Pours a medium gold color with fuzzy head that dissipates not long after the pour. Smell: Crisp and sharp aroma immediately after opening bottle. Quite 'piney' in nature. A degree of malt and honey also peek through. Taste: A well-balance strike between the hops and malt here, with a slight nod to the hops. Hops jump at the onset- not as bitter as I had imagined- displaying piney and citrus-like elements. A mild sweetness then pulls though- carrying a taste of caramel malts and honey at the end. Not at all cloying. Fantastic, complex, yet clean. Mouthfeel: Medium feels with a bit of a slickness on the tongue. Drinkability: I could easily have several in one sitting, but the ABV would probably put the brakes on that idea.  Overall- lives up to the hype. This beer has all the attributes I seek in a great DIPA. This beer may have just outshined my previous DIPA king- Dogfish Head 90-Minute. Complex and delicious!",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",Imperial IPA,98

287,17112,CaptCleveland,4.68,"Bottle from 6-pack packaged on January 12, 2009 poured into pint glass.  Saffron-colored body with thick head of white foam, settles to a fingerbreadth throughout tasting.  Pleasing grass, earth, grapefruit combination.  To quote from the bottle: "" A biting, bitter, tongue bruiser of an ale"", but in actuality a rather smooth, hop-filled warmth descends upon the buds with a bit of after-swallow tingle.  Smooth, no oily resin here.  Clean, hop-filled ale goes down easy. The 10% ABV well cloaked. Recent tasting of Victory Hop Wallop and DFH 90 minute completes the triumvirate with Bell's DIPA the clear favorite. If there is a better DIPA I haven't had the pleasure. Highly recommended.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",Imperial IPA,98
287,17112,wheatyweiss,4.32,"Poured from a bottle into a standard pint.  Pours a slightly cloudy light orange, with a towering rocky head that leaves ample lacing.  Aroma is fresh citrus hops, floral and bright. Malt is lighter roast and the balance is nice. Hop aroma is strong, but not overpowering. Boozey aromas eminate.  Flavor is sweet malt with fresh hops in the middle finishing slightly bitter and dry with a nice malt roll. Hops are grapefruit and floral and go beautifully with this particular malt roast. Biscuity and bready with a soda cracker like pop. light booze hit on the finish, but very well disguised.  Mouthfeel is medium and chewy with the malt giving a nice body.  Drinkability is dangerously high for a beer with this ABV.  (2010 batch)  This year it's pineapple! Sweeter than last batch, I swear I'm chewing a hop cone and pineapple at the same time.  (2011 batch)  This is a very astringent version, less pineapple but more than the first I tried. The alcohol and hops don't play as well together this year.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",Imperial IPA,98
287,17112,HardTarget,4.76,"Bottle Inspection: Great label! Dude getting the hop body slam, sign me up. Honey! This just keeps getting better. 10% abv.! Talk dirty to me. Indecipherable date code?!! I take back half the fantasies I've had about you.  Aroma: Flowers, you shouldn't have. They smell green and fresh with a definite Rose aroma. Juicy grapefruits too, with some key lime and apricot, hop oils just dripping. Ok, you've got my attention.  Appearance: Murky glass shows a tan blonde body leaving wavy white lace as it passes that forms a thin curtain.  Flavor: Pretty much what it shows on the label. There's a real ""wow"" to the amount of big bodied hops that fall on you. The stunningly great thing here is there is so little bitter, just a twist of lime peel at the end. The hop flavor is just massive! West Coast kind, all citric. There is a flash of malt in the finish, which is really holding the package together. Scary, I just remembered the abv, but only after feeling the alcohol hit my system after 3 greedy pulls. There is a green tea aspect here too, which may be my association with the honey. A pithy Orange Juice flavor comes in once I start to acclimate.  Mouthfeel: Body is medium/light, carbonation medium and at an enjoyable level, the texture slick and the beer goes very dry in the finish where I'm starting to catch a little alcohol tastes.  Overall Impression: Scary. There must be an entire 17 ft. hop plant in this bottle. The flavor is just amazing; I'm reminded of Two Hearted Ale. Takes that hard to scratch alpha acid spot and leaves it raw and satisfied. Seek: consume fresh.

287,17112,raoulduke37,4.92,"Oh good lord, what a beer. I can see why this is talked about so much and even compared to Pliney. It is worthy of that comparison. Thanks very much to psunate for the trade. This one will not be taken off my want list anytime soon. Whoever gave this one a D- must have had a bad bottle or something. This beer is objectively superb.  Appearance is a beautiful orange, almost apple juice color, with light yellow highlights. Beautiful off-white head, that doesn't stick around for too long, but lacing does. The smell hit me like a punch in the face, if that could ever be considered a positive experience. Strong, unmistakable scent of fresh pineapple, with other citrusy highlights in the background. Taste wise, this is a phenomenal IIPA. It claims to be ""biting and bitter"" but this is balanced so well that the most harsh IPA critic would even enjoy this brew. It's hard for me to discern the initial flavor, but afterwards you get a nice kick of hops all the way down. So so good. This one is creamy, smooth, tasty, well balanced, and perfectly crafted. Kudos to Bells Brewery, those gents are alright. Keep these coming.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",Imperial IPA,98
287,17112,dismal,4.6,"I've heard a lot of great things about this beer so I was excited to try it. Ended up picking it up while on a trip to see a friend. It poured a hazy orangish, light amber, off gold color. Had about a one finger head that faded not to long after pouring. The smell is great! Very hoppy and piney. After taking a sip the mouthfeel is good, not light at all but not heavy just right really. The taste is very sweet because of the honey and the hops stand out nicely, piiney and a bit citrusy. The flavor is very good. With a 10% ABV it's hidden very well making this beer very very drinkable. I could easily drink these! In the end I'm glad I went out of my way to grab a six pack of Hopslam up. Very well worth the $17 I paid for it.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",Imperial IPA,98
287,17112,BenJames1984,5,"To start off, I am very fortunate to live in Mid-Michigan, as the Bell's Brewery is only about two hours away.  What's there to say? This is the first year I've had this delectable seasonal beer from Bell's, and was very impressed. I've always enjoyed their Two-Hearted IPA, and I had an intuition that Hopslam wouldn't be a let-down. I was right.  First impressions are important. As a hop-lover, seeing a label depicting a guy being crushed under the weight of an over-sized hop was enough to sell me. However, the wonderful taste around this beer didn't stem from it's hoppy-ness. It was the combination of a sweet honey flavor AND the hops, with a ten percent ABV to boot; very smooth and drinkable. Considering a six pack is nearly twenty dollars with tax + deposit, it's worth the ticket.  HopSlam is currently in my top five, and probably won't be going anywhere for a while.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",Imperial IPA,98
287,17112,Ineedabeerhere,4.4,"Big Thanks to Hophead101 for the hookup on this. Can't believe this is the first time I've tried this brew.  Pours a slightly hazy amber with a slow rising head helped by the shape of my tulip to build to a one and a half finger size.  Nice aroma- not as strong or forward as Pliny or Capt. Lawrence's DIPA. Solid hop flavors in the aroma. Some deep piney, resinous hops- some citrus I suppose but not as apparent as some other IPAs. The flavor is a great complex formulation of hop flavors. I can't say that I pick up honey per se, but there is some sweetness through the back that you can tell isn't necessarily coming from the malt.  Nice substance to the mouthfeel- I can't comprehend that this is 10%. Extremely drinkable- the alcohol never crossed my mind once. The hop flavors did a great job to cover this up. Overall this beer was not really what I was expecting, but its delicious regardless. A must for IPA and hop fans.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",Imperial IPA,98

S: Hops!! I love this smell, if I would love this in a car air freshener!! Citrus and Pine definitely stand out as far as what I smell.  T: You get that Grapefruit/citrus taste along with the pine, and sweetness from the honey.  M: Medium bodies with just the right amount of carbonation.  D: Even though it's a 10% I could have a few of these at a time. I want more, putting the order in now :)",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",Imperial IPA,98

287,17112,evantwomey,4.1,"12 oz bottle, thanks to Cindirene's in Ayden, NC. Served at around 45 F. Poured into a big snifter. Pours an amber-gold with about 1/2 an inch of head, which dissipates slowly and leaves spotty lacing. Aroma heavy on the citrus - grapefruit mostly. But its not as intense as I was hoping. Some honey and alcohol aroma as it warms. Taste is very nice - the first thing that hits you is a massive amount of hop flavor, again very citrusy. The finish is actually pretty sweet, mostly what comes through is the honey (which is an awesome addition to this beer). Surprisingly, I found this beer to be not that bitter at all, and the honey really helps smooth everything out. The drinkability is off the charts for a 10% beer, I could easily burn through a 6-pack of this in a night.  Overall, a very solid beer. I definitely wouldn't call it my favorite DIPA, but it is one of the most quirky beers I've had in a while and they pull it off.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",Imperial IPA,98
287,17112,JamesS,3.72,"Pours a nice, if light, copper color, with some good initial head (quickly fading) and a wee bit of lacing. Nice strong hoppy scent, floral and citrus (extreme amounts of grapefruit, which I honestly don't care for as a melon). Nice deep hoppy taste from beginning to end, although the pine and the grapefruit battle a bit, with the grapefruit winning out. Goes down fine for a higher ABV beer, although there's a little roughness in it. A nice double IPA, there are better and worse.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",Imperial IPA,98
287,17112,Strix,4.92,"Pale golden-orange, fairly decent head, decent lacing.  Smells fantastic - citrusy, green, and crisp. Blindfolded, I'd say it's a blend of citrus juices.  Grapefruity citrus in front of a bready base, honey, and some malty sweetness. Hints of tropical fruits and pineapple. A bit of a piney aftertaste. Taste is fairly balanced, yet complex. No hint of alcohol - this doesn't feel like 10% at all.  Mouthfeel smooth, slightly viscous.  Wow, this is phenomenal, and dangerously drinkable. This is a great beer, and another great one from Bell's. The best IPA I've ever had for sure.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",Imperial IPA,98
287,17112,gonzo46and2,4.4,On tap at World of Beer in Westchase.  Pours a copper color with a relatively small head that dissipated pretty quickly. (It was a generous pour from the tap)  Aroma wasn't huge but was very pleasant. Mostly citrus in the nose with bits of pine and spruce resin.  Taste was mostly pine and spruce. Good maltiness and sweetness balances things out. A bit of warmth from the ABV but no offensive alchohol flavors.  Mouthfeel was surprising. It wasn't as bitter as I'd expected. Very well balanced. It has a quick finish.  Very good DIPA. Would like to find some bottles of this and compare to draft.,Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",Imperial IPA,98

The finish is purely bitter followed by a slight burning acidity in my throat. M: Sticky, medium bodied, right amount of carbonation D: Just average. I bought a 6 pack last year, and thought it was good, not great. I went for the single bottle this year, and am glad I didn't spend the extra $12.

Some piney hops, but a really strong smell of lemon zest and some very noticeable grapefruit notes. There is something else in the nose that sets the smell apart, but I can't quite place it. Taste is bitter upfront before the honey-like sweetness balances on the mid-palate. Ultimately the hop bitterness reappears and lingers, and the alcohol becomes very evident. This is a winner. Very much enjoying this beer and like the fact that while it is a great IPA, it is slightly more unique than many other IPAs that are out there. I wish this was available in my area.

287,17112,bcm119,4.37,"Pours a hazy peach/orange color, which is the color of most of my favorite IPA's. Thin lacing around the edge. Ripe tropical fruit hops in the aroma, with a hint of alcohol. Plush, juicy hops-- dried apricot, ripe citrus and a gently drying, leafy green bitterness. A light malt profile with a soft sweetness brings some floral hints to the hops, but stays in the background and is well integrated. Hops are mostly on the flavoring end of the spectrum; bittering is on the light side for the amount of hop flavor in here. Finishes fairly dry with a fresh, citrus pith aftertaste.  A nice double IPA done spot-on in the San Diego style. My only gripe is the ABV-- you can often taste and smell the alcohol. If this was attenuated to the same degree and 8%, I think it would be even better. Still, this would be a regular if it was available around here.

Nose: A gamut of citrus fruits; grapefruit, clemintine, mandarin orange all intermingling with spruce and honey lingering in the background of a sapid nose.  Body: Creamy and medium.  Palate: Quickly sweet and intensely hoppy with the aforementioned fruits translating in great balance. The honey makes itself known after the hop wave subsides revealing a trickle of malt. The finish is appealingly extensive.  Comment: An ideal imperial IPA.

Each sip is just as profound as the previous.  M: Medium bodied, with a slightly dry bitter finish. Ideal carbonation makes this one a keeper.

There is tons of lacing left in the glass, its probably more like frosting in my glass.  There are tons of sweet mouth watering hops in the bouquet. A very fragrant beer to say the least. Fruity aromas of red pears, apples, and ruby red grapefruit. I wish my fruit juices smelled like this growing up. It may just be me, but I also picked up some patchouli, damn I love that smell. My mouth continues to water in anticipation. Just a touch of alcohol can be picked up by the nose.  This great crafted ale is sweet with loads of bitterness. Reminds me so much of ruby red grapefruit juice. There is a subtle sweetness in the background that is simply delicious. Can't determine if it is from the honey or the malts, either way it is outstanding.  Medium bodied and jaw clinching bitter. It fully coats my mouth and leaves it feeling stickey. The carbonation is perfect and it is so smooth. There is a slight drying on the finish.  This is definitely one of ,if not my, favorite beers. Extremely enjoyable and highly drinkable. Its not for the weak palate, this baby is a hop head's Kool Aid. It beats your tastebuds into submission and I continued to ask for more.

287,17112,BigJim5021,4.28,"Two Hearted's bastard of an older brother pours an impeccably clear orange/copper with a big white head that settles into a nice ring. Wads of lacing. Beautiful beer.  The smell is huge, juicy hops. I except nothing more of an IIPA. Like the hops used in TH, they're citrusy and floral. Dear Glade, get your asses in gear and make some Hopslam air freshener. Sincerely, Jim V.  Flavor is all hops, all the time. The first time I ever had this beer, it lived up to the claim that it was a ""tongue bruising"" ale. Years later, I don't find it to be as such. Don't get me wrong, it's one of the hoppiest beers I've ever had. My taste buds are apparently just adapted to take a beating at this point. Either way, this stuff is really delicious.  Mouthfeel is fantastic. The alcohol gives it a little more weight than TH, so it's not quite as sharp and crisp. However, you don't really expect an IIPA to be quite so crisp. That said, the body is spot-on for the style. Quality carbonation and tipping the scales at a near-full body. Drier than a sun-baked turd, too.  Drinkablitly is tricky. At 10%, I can't detect even a hint of the alcohol in the flavor. None. I can, however, detect it all up in my business after a couple glasses. On the other hand, the price is ballooning something fierce. I paid $14 (after tax) for the stuff last year. This year, it's $17.99 (before tax). I lucked out. The store at which I purchased it sold it to me at cost due to the fact that I spend a lot of money there, despite being employed by a competing liquor store. The damage was $13.30. Not bad, but who's to say it won't be over $20 next year? Aw, who am I kidding? I'd fucking pay it.

Pours exceptionally clear with a new little head; lacing seems to last the entire time I was drinking the beer. A nice amber deviation from the dark stouts of winter.  Smell is just wonderful. Very hoppy (obviously) with a bit of a citrus smell to it. Kind of an odd season in my mind; this beer makes me think late spring / early summer but perhaps that would be competing with Oberon.  Taste backs up everything that the smell sets up for you. The alcohol isn't that hidden, you know it's there about 1/2 way through the beer.

287,17112,t0rin0,3.9,"12 oz bottle brought by azagthoth yesterday.  Pours a very pale color and moderately hazy, not a good start. Also, nice tall white head, decent retention and lacing.  Aroma is very nice but at the same time a bit offensive. There is a ton of grapefruit but also a good amount of alcohol in the nose. Also, some sugary smells are apparent but I don't think that's malt.  Flavor was interesting for sure. Very sweet and hoppy but moderately boozy as well. I'm guessing the sweetness is pale malt and honey but when you get that much hops in a beer it can be sweet as well. Lots of grapefruit again, medium/high bitterness for a DIPA.  Body was reasonably heavy and sticky, medium carbonation, drinkabale because of the good taste but very boozy.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",Imperial IPA,98
287,17112,everetends,4.44,"12 oz bottle thanks again to hwwty4 and served up in that DFH shaped pint. Well, been hearing quite a bit about this guy and now I have the honor. Lets do this.  A: Off to a not so good start. Pours a crystal clear amber that has some nice carbonation movement to it. Held to the light, a pretty nice golden yellow. The head is the bad part. Got a little less than a finge of white head, but it had pretty much zero retention. Fell to a thin white ring that left a bit of sloppy lacig on the glass. Problem is that it is not very sticky at all. Oh no!!!!  S: Smell is quite fantastic. Big turn around from the look for sure. The hops come out and in a big way. The heavy grapefruit presence is very nice. Then behind that comes a whole pine forest. The pine is oh so nice. Sometimes the pine can be too much but this is real mild but real present at the same time. There is a slight honey sweetness going on in the background but the hops are all over this nose. Nice.  T: Good Christ, HOPS. The hops go down pretty much the same way as in the nose. Big time pineapple goodness coming out with flesh, rind, and skin all over it. The pine cuts that with a sweet resin presence that is damned near perfect in the mix. The last bit of hops is a nice floral touch that rounds out all these flavors and really attaches well to the malt and honey flavors. Malt is light and this beer is no where near balanced, but the malt does push up nicely and tries to add some sweetness to this hop bomb. Very good flavor.  M: Medium bodied brew that has some nice carbonation to it, making this pretty big DIPA easy drinking. ABV, for being so high, is pretty damned nonexistant. Nice touch of hops bitterness and resin sits on the palate in the aftertaste. Sticky and oily slick.  D: For such a big ass beer, this is highly drinkable. The look was the only let down this beer produces. That smell, taste, and feel is damned near perfect and makes this a fine beer that stands with and higher than most DIPA I have ever had. God this is good.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",Imperial IPA,98
287,17112,chaz410,4.77,"Had this beer on tap at the always impressive Common Market in Charlotte NC. The golden color is consistant with a beautiful white head that you just know is going to smell amazing. No surprises here in the smell, just bliss. Super hoppy, very very floral. Notes of grapefruit, pine, and honey are brightly obvious. The smell is sweet and zesty with hops, can't wait for the taste! The taste is so crisp and hoppy. The hops are very floral, sweet and not too bitter. This IPA doesn't numb up your tongue which I'm happy to report. The honey used in the wort cuts a lot of what would be very bitter flavorings and allows you to get all the flavor subtleness and clean floral character. Finishes with a great honey malt sweetness that lingers in the top of your palate along with a fantastic but not overpowering hop crisp pine and grapefruit sharpness. Huge fan of this beer, grab it while you can and get it off tap if you can find it!",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",Imperial IPA,98
287,17112,bamadog,4.84,"Well, I could only justify buying a single of these bad boys and I've heard great things (albeit kind of scary things too. You know, things like, ""After I drank a pint all I could taste was hops for the next two hours...""). I'm looking forward to it, but let's see if I would actually considering paying 17 plus dollars for a sixer. Here goes...  Appearance: A nice golden/light coppery color. A fairly thin 3/4 finger head (well, to the best of my judgment anyway) and it's fafdiing quickly. Looks very sticky though and as it dwindles I can see it sticking tight to the sides of the pint glass. Very light carbonation bubbling throughout.  Smell: Hops. Go figure. Smells very bitter and piney - overpowering as I would expect.  Taste: OK, definitely not what I expected. I really expected to be overwhelmed by hoppy bitterness, but am pleasantly surprised by how balanced this is with the honey sweetness. The hops are present, and you feel like they're trying to take over your whole mouth, but again, the balance is there. You can taste a slight pine in there as well. Simply amazing.  Mouthfeel: Sticky and oily - thoroughly coats your mouth. A very lively beer on the palate as well - feels almost prickly on the tongue. The stickiness seems to trail down the throat.  Drinkability: I'm convinced that this is an extremely exceptional beer. I now understand all the hype behind it. I don't know if I could justify paying the amount of money they want for it, but I honestly don't doubt that it is worth it. To those that can afford it, congratulations. I may have to pick up one or two more singles though before it disappears until next year. I'm a little concerned about the 10% ABV, so I definitely wouldn't drink more than one in an evening (but then again, I'm really a lightweight, so take that for what it's worth).",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",Imperial IPA,98
287,17112,brewmudgeon,4.22,"notes from 1/20/2011: won't change any ratings, still an excellent beer. just noting the nose while very good does not blow a person away and, more importantly, the pale malty sweetness is so intense it makes me wish for more bitterness to balance it out. back to back against double trouble, the founders offering seemed to bring enough bitterness to give it the edge in drinkability.  a 4 clear light golden apricot. almost no head, quickly to a ring, scattered spots of lace.  s 4.5 fresh green herbal citrusy hops. grassy/piney/fresh parsley-like. some sweetness is noticeable too. yeast rolls, water crackers. the sweet malts are becoming more predominant the more i inhale. the smell is similar to a 90 minute when you can find a 90 minute in good shape--but this smells better, fuller, fresher and less green. the hops also have that noble quality, so it's also reminiscent a SA imperial pilsner, but less one-dimensional and far less alcohol presence despite the higher abv.  t 4 this is one malty iipa. thick, smooth, and sweet. the hops are there in good quantity but are barely a match for the residual sugars. at first i detect no bitterness whatsoever, then a few little bites--nibbles really, until the beer starts to warm. (it better hurry up with the warming though, as every sip demands another, bigger sip.) in intensity, the hop aroma is like a 9, the flavor a 7, the bitterness a 3 or 4.  m 4 med-full bodied, syrupy, moderate carbonation.  d 4-4.5 insanely drinkable for 10% abv! i haven't had many beers this strong, but this is easily the most drinkable of any over 9%, even of any over 8%, that i've experienced. the back of the bottle says this is a ""biting, bitter, tongue bruiser of an ale."" don't think i can agree. it's more a sinful, sticky, hop candy of a dessert.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",Imperial IPA,98

Bar now the best nose of any beer i have ever had, i get tangerines, grapefruit, oranges, and lemon and lime, but sweet too, like citrus mixed with sugar. Tastes the same as the nose but maybe a touch less intense, less sweet, more bitter and pithy. Don't get em wrongs its up there with the best dipas i have hod. I get the malt a bit, a sweetness that shows up mid-pallete, but its minimimal and i am fine with that. overall a great beer, smooth mouthfeel, and drinkalble as hell. once again bells brings the thunder.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",Imperial IPA,98
287,17112,JonathanL7890,4.64,This is my 99th beer review. YAY! Thanks to Bgthang for letting us raid your stock of Hopslam. Maybe I'll share one of my beers sometime.. Pours a 3 finger billowy head. Color is a nice orangey straw color. Aroma: super delicious! Smells like sweet hop candy. I wish they made cologne like this. Wow! But wait it gets better! The taste is awe inspiring. Super smooth easy drinking elixir. Just the right balance of malt sweetness and hops. The mouthfeel is great. Just the right amount of carbonation and the malt backbone gives a silky mouthfeel. Drinkability. incredible. In the dangerous territory. I'm kind of glad it's not available in Texas so I cant buy cases of this stuff and die of alcohol poisoning.  I though Pliny was the best but I think we have a new king in the DIPA category.,Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",Imperial IPA,98
287,17112,Boehemyth,4.7,"Reviewed out of a 12 oz. longneck bottle from the 2009 release and poured carefully into a 18oz. snifter. Translucent orange in color with a small head. Leaves ring of lacing on the glass. A surprisingly sweet smell for an IPA. The hops are only just detectable next to the grapefruit/honey aroma. Sweet on the nose and seems to oscillate between the sweetness of the honey and the bitterness of the hops. As you swallow, it slides smoothly down your throat and that sweet taste sets in for a few seconds, after which the hop taste takes over for good. This is one of the most flavor packed beers I have ever had, and I'm not just talking about hops! This is a perfectly balanced IPA on a level of greatness I didn't even think was possible. This will easily be one of my favorite brews of the year.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",Imperial IPA,98
287,17112,neenerzig,4.45,"Doing a side by side vertical tasting here of a bottle of the winter 2009 batch and also a bottle of the fall 2007 batch that has been sitting in my cellar for about 13 months or so now Both were poured out of 12 oz bottles into mugs. The appearance of both are identical. Both pour a slightly hazy golden/copper color with a bit of an orangish tint. Has a nice foamy white head that doesn't stick around for long. Both settled to a nice surface coating within 5 minutes of being poured. Both had very good lacing. The 2009 one had aromas of hops are that were strongly present followed by some citrus and a bit of malt. The 2007 one had a very similar aroma, but the hops were aroma was not quite as dominant and a bit more caramel malt aroma came through. For the 2009 one, tastewise this bad baby is dominated by hops, followed by orange and a bit of lemon, rounded out by some toasted caramel malt. The 2007 one has a fairly similar flavor. Obviously the hop bitterness isn't nearly as present as in the 2009, instead the caramel malt flavor is upfront, followed by a citrus flavor and is rounded out with hops. The hops still make their presence know though. Both have a crisp, full bodied mouth feel with moderate carbonation. Easy to drink in a good way. Everyone should try this beer at least once! Can't say that one is better than the other here, they are both great, but a hop head will probably like a fresh one more than an aged one.

Head leaves as soon as it came, but the lace sticks around for the long haul. Smell is just pure citrus hops, just with deeper fruiter notes than we get here out west. Taste is nothing short of outstanding, If your like me; and in love w/these wet coast hop-bombs you don't want to miss a chance to get your hands on the mid-west's version of this style.

287,17112,AdmiralDiaz,4.62,"Poured from a 12oz bottle to my Rogue pint glass.  A: Messed up my pour and got a little too aggressive, lucky for me Natasharai poured one along with me so I could judge what the true head should have looked like. The positive thing that came out of my sloppy pour was that the head rose about an inch over the rim of the glass and held up wonderfully. From the correctly poured on there was about a one-finger off-white head on top of a copper semi-opaque body. Head has pretty good retention and some lacing. On my second review here, I got a great two-finger head with amazing retention and nice lacing.  S: Very strong scented, grapefruit, citrus, strong hops and a strong amount of pine.  T: Strong citrus hops upfront with a bit of honey that turns into a sharp grapefruit with a very flowery dry/bitter finish. Easily the strongest hopped IPA I've had. There's a small trace of malt but very little. I'm extremely amazed at how well the alcohol is masked in this 10%'er...I never would have guessed, there's only an alcohol trace in the last ounce or two.  Overall: Very happy that this lived up to the hype! Not too thick (in comparison to Maharaja and Unearthly) Very drinkable for the alcohol content, the most drinkable DIPA I've ever had. If you can get a trade for this It's worth it and if you're able to buy it, also worth the $15-18.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",Imperial IPA,98
287,17112,abents,4.42,"Pours a slightly cloudy reddish orange with a nice white head that laces fairly well. Smells of, guess what?, hops. Huge floral and citrus, lemon, orange, grapefruit and pineapple. Tastes likes hops, but in a pretty balanced way. The fruity sweetness works well with the bitterness of hops. I can pick out grapefruit, pine trees, pineapple and honey. Got a nice tang to it that makes this normally incredibly bitter style a nice refreshing quality to it. Very easy to drink for its abv and hop bomb qualities. Very nice brew, I'm not really that much of a hophead, but this is one I can easily enjoy. Wish it was cheaper.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",Imperial IPA,98
287,17112,kasper,4.77,"A: Pours a thick, murky amber with a short but tight orange-tinted off-white head that peels down slowly leaving sticky sheets of lacing.  S: Woah, loads of sweet citrus flavors -- almost smells like a wicked orange Tang. Some tangerine, butter shortening, orange rings, and tiny bit of pine. Underlying aromas are similarly sweet, and creamy akin cake shortening. The smell remains intense through the entire beer!  T: This is without a doubt the smoothest, most balanced, big IPA I've had to date. Rich and buttery malts up front with some sweet citrus, but these flavors implode down to a dry, piney finish that leaves your tastes buts with no question as to what kind of brew your drinking.  M: Smooth and silky with mild carbonation. Somewhat biscuity and rather palette coating. Quite enjoyable.  D: This is a huge find for me. This one really lives up to its hype. I think it's smoother than Pliny. Certainly a world class beer for its style. I have 5 left...

287,17112,TheMistler,4.25,"Poured a slightly hazy amber orange. White creamy head displays great, sticky lacing. Whispy but substantial cap is settled on after nice retention.  Some sweet and malt notes hover in the background of the nose, with bright grapefruit leaping the fore. Biscuit malt. Honey.  Grapefruit is the primary hop flavor - or flavor in general, in fact. Some pine comes in, riding resin. Dough malt. While obviously weighted towards the hops, the sweet well balances the perfusion of fruity and bitter hop flavors. Some spice, grass.  A creamy feel, with some chewiness. Moderately thick, but with the spice working with the sustained if middling carbonation prickliness to keep things crisp. Oh, and when I heard that this brew is 10% I was floored. ABV is completely and utterly hidden.  So, the times being what they are, I couldn't justify dropping $18 for a sixer of a beer I'd never had, though I've heard good things. Now that I've had the opportunity to try it on draft, I might have drop the money for a sixer... and price a lot of places beforehand.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",Imperial IPA,98
287,17112,sonicdescent,4.57,"Thanks to vwcraig for this one.  Pours a golden/copper color. Relatively clear. Off white head rather thin but does stick around.  Aroma is intense hops; as it should be. The hop scent is so intense that the citrus almost comes off as sweet smelling. Alcohol is well masked.  Tastes amazingly clean, while still being strong and pronounced. Not overly bitter and while it is obviously balanced toward the hoppier side of things, malt is present and this is not a bomb in any sense of the word. As for specific flavors, citrus hops are present (orange, pineapple), maybe some other fruits and resiny flavor. Very tasty and the alcohol is very well masked.  Mouthfeel is smooth with a light/medium body and medium carbonation. Not a particularly dry finish or really any alcohol warming.  Drinkability; I came in expecting a hop bomb or something akin to carbonated grapefruit pulp, but got a rather tasty brew. Shame it's so limited this year.

I kept hearing about grapefruit in this beer and there is definitely grapefruit notes coming from the hops, for a drying yet also semi-sweet sensation.

Yes, ma'am, this is a hoppy beer. So much hop flavor that I really don't know what to do.

Fantastic hop flavor which is well balanced by the honey. You still get a nice citrus/grapefruit flavor and a nice splash of pine.  Moderately carbonated which makes for a smooth mouthfeel.

T = Rich complex flavor, with strong bitterness but also lots of sweet flavors so it's not just simple hops bitterness.

287,17112,SteveO1231,4.92,"Received a 6 pack of Hop Slam in a trade with HopHobo. 12 oz. long-neck with a green label featuring an image of some pour bastard who has just been pounded in a gigantic hop cone avalanche of some sort.  The brew pours a bright orange-amber with a nice chunks of foam that look like packing peanuts. Lacing looks as if spider-man has his way with my beer glass. Millions of super-tiny bubbles cascade to the surface. The aroma is absolutely beautiful, it covers the complete range of hop aroma one can think of. Tons of citrus, light pungent, and a bunch of pine. A bit of a fruity, sweet-tart aroma that reminds me of strawberry rhubarb pie. The medium-bodied brew has a fluffy texture when swished around on the palate. At this point the ABV makes itself known with some heat that numbs the palate like a shot of novocain. That strawberry-rhubarb pie character found in the aroma is found in the initial flavor of the beer. The rest of the beers flavor is a hopfest, full of lush, juicy, grassy-as-hell hoppiness, citrus peel and pine. I was expecting much more in term of a palate shredding bitterness with the finish but it is surprisingly crisp and refreshing. Don't get me wrong its grassy as all hell but the palate is left with a light grassy dryness and belly warm with booze. Sips way too easy for 10%!

287,17112,nickfl,4.67,"A - One and a half fingers of bone white head on top of a slightly hazy, copper colored body. The head settles slowly and leaves a thick layer of lace clinging to the glass.  S - Strong mint, citrus, licorice hop aroma, very juicy and sweet. With some effort, one can detect a strong, sweet malt backbone behind the hops.  T - Intense tropical fruit flavors from the hops, complimented by the fruity sweetness from the malt and yeast. Spicy hop notes surface in the middle and help to balance out the immense malt sweetness that imparts light grape notes and darker plum like sweetness. Strong, but not overwhelming, bitterness appears in the finish and darkens the character of the hops with notes of cedar and tobacco.  M - Thick body, medium-high carbonation, and a somewhat sweet finish.  D - A huge, yet quite drinkable beer. This is a very well balanced beer, which is quite a feat considering the huge loads of hop flavor and malt sweetness that had to be carefully kept in check.

Poured a very orange tinged clear gold, almost yellow at the bottom, darker orange at the top. 1 1/2 fingers of pillowy white to off-white head that fades over the course of 3-4 minutes and leaves an absolutely gorgeous lacing that clings voraciously to the glass. The brew seems to go from clear to slightly pale as the head recedes. Gorgeous!!!  S: Grapefruit! That's the first thing that strikes my nose, citrus, citrus and more citrus. There's some grassy, herbal and floral notes in there for sure, but the citrus hop aroma reins supreme!  T: Once again, grapefruit right off the bat, but more of a clean lemon twinge in the background. I taste hints of honey and melon. Very floral, very aromatic , the flavor sticks with you well after the last sip. The alcohol only makes itself apparent in the belly, dangerously well hidden alcohol content.  M: Not nearly as bitter as I was expecting from a DIPA, but still enough to leave my tastebuds screaming. Medium bodied, albeit a little watery. A very very light amount of carbonation rounds it out and leaves me feeling refreshed.  D: If it wasn't for the alcohol content and the bitterness, I think I could sit down and drink 10 of these. The aroma and flavor are incredible, and completely new to me as a beer drinker. I will gladly crack open another... after about an hour. It's not nearly as bitter as you would think, but it's enough to make you think twice about having a second one too quickly.  Notes: I have to say I'm mildly disappointed regarding the price tag. If this were available more often, and at maybe 10-12 dollars for a 6-pack, I would drink it all the time. Sadly, this is not the case.  A rockin DIPA, but a little over hyped if you ask me.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",Imperial IPA,98
287,17112,waldoiverson,4.32,"12 oz into Nonic  A: light orange with full, fluffy offwhite head (1.5 fingers) with solid lacing  S: very sweet citrus, clementine orange, and very little alcohol given the ABV, smells smooth  T: breadiness and clean citrus hops that are suprisingly well balanced then a strong blast of warming alcohol.  M: Smooth but good carbonation. Fairly dry with lingering warmth from alcohol  D: this is excellent and makes for a nice treat on a cold winter day. The flavor of summer the warmth of a scotch(maybe not quite as much but you get the idea.)",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",Imperial IPA,98
287,17112,natasharai,4.45,"Appearance: poured with 2cm off white slightly fluffy head, that dissipated to a thin layer within 3 minutes and left a little lacing. The beer is a hazy golden color.  Smell: Very strong smell of grapefruit and a scent of lemon and flowers.  Taste: Strong citrusy hops full of grapefruit. Some herbal bitterness is detectable and lemons. All followed by a barley backbone to balance out the hops. A nice slightly sweet taste is left in my mouth.  Mouthfeel: Medium bodied, very nice amount of carbonation, slightly oily... from the hops leaving a thing film in my mouth. Has a sharp bitterness tingle on the tip of the tongue.  Overall: Pretty east to drink, well balanced, but still far more hops than anything else going on in this beer. The alcohol taste not as detectable as you would think for 10% ABV... but you end up feeling it :)",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",Imperial IPA,98
287,17112,sgoodship,4.79,"Purchased at EV1 Liquors in Evanston. Poured from a 12oz bottle into an imperial pint glass. The batch number 8913 tells me that this was packaged on Jan 12th - pretty fresh.  A: Nice soft and creamy, yellowy orange one finger head. Amber color liquid with haziness. Some random carbonation rising from the bottom of the glass. Good head retention and great lacing.  S: Big bold hop of course but it is really really strong. The grapefruit is there but there is a more crisp lemon along with a sweeter melon and apple. Really lovely.  T: Much like the smell to my delight. You get the nice grapefruit which has a more lemony citrus bite but rather than the caramel malt inserting itself to balance it, the sweetness is reflected in a more honey dew melon type taste. Really delicious. The alcohol is a no show excpet for the warmth on your cheeks. I can't understand how you can't taste 10% - really well masked. The danger with this brew is that it is so delicious that you want to session it but you can't unless you are a hardened drinker. It's strong.  M: The overt syrupy nature of the liquid makes it feel the full side of medium. Smooth but then there is a crisp bitterness at the finish.  D: I can't drink one of these slowly. I wish there was a little bit less alcohol because you pay the price if you don't respect he potency of this brew. If you are addicted to hops, this is a beer you have to try. I'm in love with this beer. Must... get... more...",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",Imperial IPA,98
287,17112,Bung,4.2,"12 oz bottle. A bright barely cloudy dark gold pour. Smallish white head. Very floral aroma, fresh hops with just a hint of honey and malt. Pretty straight forward very hoppy, but there is some sweet malt with the honey, and some citrus and apple. Finishes real clean, for those that like a hop belch, this will do it for you. Tastes like a really really good pale ale. I was expecting this to be just a bite in the rear bitter beer, but it was quite well balanced and dangerously drinkable. The most drinkable double I've had. Was not an earth shattering experience, but I'm glad I tried it. Not sure it was worth the 15 for the sixer, but hopefully I can trade some of this.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",Imperial IPA,98
287,17112,cbros,4,"Serving type- 12 ounce bottled poured into a Pisgah pint glass.  A- Pours a straw yellow with hints of an orange tint. Small white lace that stays present througout the beer. No activity present on beer after the pour.  S- Strong flavors of hops, also a pungent smell of citrus mainly grapefruit. These smells are very prevalent as you bring the beer up to your nose.  T- Beautiful combination of hops and citrus. The grapefruit comes back again as you begin your taste. This blends well with the hops and strong alcohol flavor. It finishes smooth and strong, you can taste the high ABV as the beer runs down your throat.  After reading everythiny about this beer, both positive and negative, I finally decided to break down and buy a six pack. This is a very good Imperial IPA and even though I am not sure it totally lived up to the hype this is still a very good beer. To me the price is not a huge factor, I have had other Imperial IPA's with a similar price tag and found them to be just as good, if not better. It was a pleasure to drink this beer and if the price was a little better I would certainly get this again, but I think I can get similar or better stuff for a little less price. Definatley a great beer but just a hair out of my price range, especially for a sixer. Added to the fact that this is a seasonal offering it makes it less tempting to send that money.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",Imperial IPA,98

S: Muted hop aromas with some honey-sweetness. Smells like candy made of hops.  T: The sweetness is rather pronounced here. The hop flavors are present in abundance, but with none of the bitterness I would expect from a DIPA. Tastes of honey and juniper.  M: Somewhat syrupy, with the right amount of carbonation. Could use some more in the way of bittering hops to enhance the crispness.  D: Hides the alcohol very well, and goes down very smoothly. Not as crisp as I normally like from a DIPA, but oddly enough, it works in this case. Probably the most easy drinking DIPA I have ever had. I feel like I could drink several of these before realizing the potentially ruinous effect of all the alcohol.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",Imperial IPA,98
287,17112,BeerSox,4.6,"12oz bottle into nonic.  Clear honey amber hue with just a bit of haze. The head is light tan and slowly settles to a thin cap with bubbly islands. The head leaves behind a wall of webby lacing.  Very sweet aromas, including honey (probably from the honey). The hops give off an herbal aroma, along with some sharp spiciness.  Slightly toasty malts with plenty of citrusy and spicy hops. The honey is detectable and adds a bit of sweetness. The alcohol is very well hidden. The overall tone of the beer is very sweet. Full bodied.  It doesn't get more drinkable than this DIPA. The alcohol isn't even noticeable and the hops add some great flavor. This gets a great score because of its drinkability. It's a DIPA but it drinks like a regular Pale Ale. The mix of hop varieties along with the honey seem to match well.

287,17112,Chad_Benson,4.52,"Well, this is my first beer review here, and an excellent one to start with. After reading everyone elses reviews I half expected to see God with my first drink...my first drink was lacking, but after I let it settle a bit it was, well, exceptional. I'm a big Bell's fan anyways, heavy hops usually don't do alot for me, but I did really love this beer...and for over $17 for the 6 pack I should...think the review taped to the door added a few dollars to the price. Loved it? Yes Best beer ever? No....but pretty damn good. I'd suggest trying to find it somewhere and give it a try, I'm more of a stout person myself, but you can never go wrong with any of the Bell's selection.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",Imperial IPA,98
287,17112,icefisherman,4.53,First one of the year as I snagged almost the last case the store had. Upon poping the bottle wow I mean holy hops. Citrusy delicious hops. On the poor nice head good lacing and a beautiful slightly hazy amber gold. Taste fully of hops what did one expect good malt presence can taste the honey in the middle.

287,17112,cedricwarner,4.44,"I can smell 'em from across the table, those lovely hops. The aroma is rich, almost sexual, grapefruit and musk, honey sweetness. The taste is more of the same, but with the citrus bite really coming through on the front of the palate, and the honey notes lingering on. Lick your lips a couple of seconds after a sip, and I swear it's just like like you've been in the honey jar.  Good lord.

287,17112,VaTechHopHead,4.49,"A - Pours a nice golden hue with an offwhite/light yellow head. If you look closely you can see traces of suspended yeast from being slightly unfiltered.  S - You couldn't get closer to a fresh hop smell if you were walking through a hop farm in Yakima, Washington at harvest time.  T- Now I fancy myself a Hop Head and wow does this satisfy my idea of a hoppy beer. It's almost as if you were biting into a fresh hop flower right off the plant and sucking out all the alpha acids. Surprisingly not as bitter as I thought though which just adds to the mind boggling concoction of this brew.  M/D - If it wasn't so expensive I would trade in my water filtration system and run this through every tap in my house. It's that easy to drink and addicting.  This was my first experience with Hopslam and I now understand the hype behind it....wow",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",Imperial IPA,98
287,17112,budsboy,4.8,"This is my fifth go at this beer. Not in a row. But now I feel like I can review it.  Pours a brilliant orange with a big, healthy bone white head. Very pretty.  Aroma is a knockout. Grapefruit dominates, alcohol, raisin, pine resin and a warm, floral scent that I can't quite put my finger on. Like a wafting perfume from a passing woman.  Taste is a juicy, puckering alcoholic grapefruit. Juicy, juicy and juicy. Almost all hop flavors. Slam, indeed. A little sweet malt is in there, but it's hard to tell where the hop juice ends and the sweet malt begins. What a marvel.  Oily smooth mouthfeel, leaning toward full-bodied.  For me, it's too drinkable. One that can get me in trouble in a hurry. I tend to gulp this beer, despite my best efforts to relax. I've taken to following this one with several glasses of water.  Now, one other thing. The price. It is expensive, yes. It is good, yes. But, I have never tasted anythiing quite like it.

Smell - floral, vanilla, citrus. it smelled exceptionally fresh.  Taste - Amazingly balanced. the 10% is very well hidden. Wonderful citrus hoppy character balanced out by the honey (I assume). Really complex.  Mouthfeel - medium body. just the right amount of carbonation.  Drinkability - incredibly smooth. Just a brilliant beer. I am so glad I got to get some on tap.

287,17112,LoRezDave,4.64,"HopSlam lives up to it's hype. I picked up a 12-pack from Chicago's south-loop Binny's. The bottle says ""brewed with honey"" and the influence is noticeable....in a very good and balancing way...more on that below.  Appearance - Medium head, dissipates to nothing, no lacing (kinda a bummer on the head/lacing). The color is a beautiful rich gold - almost brassy. Clear as a Bell.  Smell - Immediate aroma of sweet malt and honey, followed by an onslaught of rich piney, resinous, hop smells. When I popped the bottle open, I paused briefly (since I was in mid conversation with someone about who knows what), and the aroma engulfed my head. Yum.  Taste - So the taste was interesting, it wasn't a taste-bud-violating-hop-explosion, but more like a heavy weight of hops was dumped into my mouth. Lots of hop citrus and pine and resin. But also nicely balanced with sweet malt and honey.  Mouthfeel - Very full and round mouthfeel, alcohol on the finish.  Drinkability - Huge drinkability considering it's 10% and a hop-party.  Over all, this is some great stuff. Don't cellar this, be sure to drink it fresh.

I have been a huge DFH 90 minute fan for a long time, and it has been my IPA go to. This has just beat the 90 unmercifully out of first position.  A - Nice frothy, yet quickly dissipating head. Deep golden, and nicely cloudy (unfiltered) color and consistency.  S - Holy nose full of flowers! This brew smells so lovely, and sweet. The full hops smell, matched with the honey is quite a unique aromatic experience.  T - Amazing flavors abound in this brew. I have not the vocabulary nor the palate to describe everything I am tasting, but I can assure you that all of them are delicious. Hoppiness that could so easily be bitter, but that trails off into subtle sweetness of the honey. This beer is perfectly balanced.  M - There is certainly some texture to this brew.

Lots of fruity hops. It also has a very unique nose-stinging chemical like hop aroma that hits me as pull the beer away from my nose. Maybe it's the dankness of the hops coming through. Whatever this smell is, the other DIPAs I've tried don't have it. The taste is like putting marijuana and citrus fruits together in a blender and serving it as a drink. The dankness of the beer is very pronounced. It definitely has a good deal of malts too and balances well. After my first sip my saliva became much more viscous due to the balancing malts. Mild/medium bittering aftertaste. Mouth feel is medium light with just the right amount of carbonation. Drinkablity is remarkable for a 10% ABV beer.

287,17112,farrago,4.73,"Super whipped-up, agitated head of white froth, very sticky lacing. Brightly hued orange to yellow throughout, not fully transparent but clean and quite pretty. The nose is a citrus fest of pink grapefruit, tangerine, lime, if you can adjust to this you might be able to tease out pine resin, rose hips, nectarine, papaya and pineapple fruit scents, not much discernible malt-wise but doesn't feel out of balance, very credible lift in the nostrils. Medium-bodied, isn't bitter at all, more stings or pinches the palate than bites it. Same gargantuan element of pink grapefruit, tangelo, lime citrus, equally sweet and sour. The floral dimension a touch stronger, aided by the honey accents. On the other hand, any pine or charcoal flavors step back. Texturally, it's crisp and lively and built for speed, glides down the chute. No grassy nor herbaceous pucker, the hops taste fresh like you could wring them out with your hands. Carbonation shows a gentle but persistent hand. Real fun to throw back.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",Imperial IPA,98
287,17112,TonyBrew,4.47,I love the hops and when I tied this beer my taste buds said HOLY CRAP!! The aroma when I opened it was a lot like grapefruit and hops. Then I poured it to see an orange haze which I expected more golden. I also expected to see the nice head but it teneded to recede quicker then expected. A nice semi-crisp medium bodied with a bit of oiliness resin. I expected a major bitterness but was surprised on how smooth it was for having so much hops. Don't get me wrong this is a very hoppy beer that made me pucker up like most IPAs and DIPAs. However it is still pretty smooth especially for having a 10% abv. Very well balanced and surprising smoother then expected. This is definitely one hellava great IPA.

287,17112,darklordlager,4.27,"Hopslam 2010--1/10/10  A: The overpowering tropical fruit character (Pineapple, mango) attacks my nostrils as it is poured into a DFH snifter. Beautiful bright golden-copper colour with 1/2"" head that recedes after a few minutes (this snifter is something of a head-killer I have realized though). Thin oily coating. 4.5 S: Fantastic--Like a whole bunch of Cascade hops mixed into a pineapple fruit cup. Pineapple, grapefruit, mango, a bit of hop skunkiness that I do not recall from last year. Base malt and caramel malt (honey malt) if you really dig, I guess--but their role is strictly in supporting the plethora of hops and blends with them so well that they are difficult to distinguish. Not too much from the honey addition, perhaps a light floral scent. Juicy. 5 T: Sweet, sweet citrus up front (pineapple primarily, with some grapefruit), a bit of alcohol character. Sweet honey, light caramel. Moves in stages from being sweet citrus up front, malty sweet in the middle, then fading into a piney bittersweet finish--not extremely mouth puckeringly bitter on the finish as some DIPA's can be (but I tend to like that character). Aside from the bitterness, the aftertaste comes across very much like unfermented honey. Alcohol is a little more noticeable than I would like, but I suppose is to be expected to a degree. As it warms it becomes sweeter and hides the alcohol a little better (a trade-off I suppose, as it ends up being a little too sweet). 4 M: First thing noticed as I took the first taste. Well carbonated, with a slightly syrupy body that comes across as ""resiny"" (a good thing for hopheads). 4 D: A bit more alcohol bite than I prefer. While the smell was off the charts, the taste didn't quite deliver, and was less complex. Aside from the skunkiness of the hops, I would say that this year's is very similar to the last. A great beer from Bells, although not my favourite double IPA. 4  2009--1/29/09 6 pack acquired at Coffee Grounds in Eau Claire for $15.99 A: Pours into a Chimay chalice (DFH Snifters are on the way!). Great light orange colour, with a 1"" bright white head with tiny bubbles. Sticks to the sides of the glass magnificently...Looks great! S: Smell is HUGE pineapple up front! Almost overpowering, but when you dig a bit deeper you can get some other citrus scents-some grapefruit. Smells crisp and fresh. M: I notice the mouthfeel before the taste even! Very creamy and extra smooth. Slips right down with a bit of warming afterwards...great! T:Taste is of pineapple (more subdued than the smell though), very herbal, with an intense bitterness that kicks in at the end to disguise this enormous abv. Pineapple, grapefruit, citric orange. A hint of alcohol. Fresh hops, with a bitter but pleasant aftertaste. As it warms, the alcohol becomes much more evident, but pairs great with the hops. The pineapple dissapears quite a bit with the temperature increase, and the bitterness really comes out from the dark. D:Drinkability- Disguises the alcohol content masterfully, with a very smooth mouthfeel.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",Imperial IPA,98
287,17112,Jettanbass9,4.2,"The first time a had a bottle of this, it must have been 2 years old... needless to say there was no hop aroma or flavor, I thought i may had gotten a bad bottle.... With all the fuss about hopslam this year i thought id give it another go. Damn, Im glad i did.  A - Golden, honey color, slightly hazy from the bad pour that didnt decant off of the bottle conditioned yeast, light fluffy head.  S - it seems ass backwards, but i pick up on wort like aromas backed by some bicuity toastiness. This all pairs alongside sweet grapefruit, pineapple, some pine and a vague aroma of tulips. Good aroma that is well balanced inbetween the malt, though an 'MO' of the style, It's nice to have some malt character pair along side a healthy dose of hops.  T - A balanced bitterness that barely makes me pucker, sweet wort like flavors (honey malt?) and toasted bread mix in between a floral hoppiness, grapefruit and pine. The alcohol is barely noticeable until you get that warming sensation as you breath out. At 10%, this beer is very well crafted in balance.  M - medium bodied, low carbonation, sweetness is almost cloying, but brought back to balance by the abundance of hops. In one word, balanced.  D - Extremely... even as i try to pace myself, im starting to see the bottom of the glass in less than a half hour. 10% would dictate, to me, a sipper, however, this beer keeps telling me, 'go on, have another.'

Not noticing much hoppiness in the nose.  T - Not as hop-dominated as I expected, there's quite a bit going on and it has a surprising amount of balance. The honeyed hops are quite unique, unlike anything else I've had. The progression in the mouth as you stop to taste it seems to be sweet citrus, then dry bitter hops then an alcohol burning. The balance shifts towards sweetness at about 50F, and then tilts back towards hops closer to room temp.  M - Has a nice fizzy carbonation, one of the first things I noticed on tasting. Aftertaste is hops and booze; what were you expecting? Not too heavy for what it is, it goes down quite smooth.  D/O - This beer seems to be at it's most drinkable slightly below room temperature. It's a DIPA, if you're tossing down a sixer in one sitting something's gone terribly wrong.

Taste: Not as bitter as I expected from reputation and aroma. But make no mistake, this is a hoppy beer. There is that trademark pucker reaction from the first sip, so common among BIG IPAs. The high alcohol content is well-hidden and despite the initial bitterness, it mellows quickly and is ultimately pretty well-balanced for the style. The flavors are predominantly and distinctly grapefruit. There is some bready malts in the finish which leaves the bitterness on the back of the tongue presenting a pleasant aftertaste.  Overall Impressions: Well-balanced for the style and extremely deceptive in the alcohol department. I prefer a bit more complexity, but if you love big grapefruit flavors in your IPAs, you'll love this beer.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",Imperial IPA,98
287,17112,biker30x,4.4,"Are there hops in this?  '08 ($18 a six at Sam's HP) version. Opens with a massive malty grapefruit scent, pours into a pint with a surprisingly clear amber color and light head that dissipates quickly, some light lacing. The nose of grapefruit falls away after a few minutes and the following scent is of pine and resin (my sense of smell isn't the best). The taste is almost pure hops as it hits your mouth, spice and carbonation. Resin bites my tongue, I'm looking for the citrus or sweet malt. the mouthfeel is satisfyingly viscous. At the back, a very burnt malty sweetness was a pleasant addition. the alcohol ads a welcome burn. When it's gone the hops stick around to kick my tongue for a while longer...and I like it.  This is a huge hop-bomb of a beer where the hops are leading a Sherman-esque scorched earth march on the Atlanta of my mouth. The alcohol alone says you don't drink this one all night. It's unbalanced in the best sense of the word.  These big DIPAs are my thing. This is among the best. I found the lack of malt and citrus (at least on my palate) kept this one from being my go-to DIPA. Sorry to all the Hopslam-ers out there. This beer is better than really good, I just like a flavor profile that features a bit more over-the-top citrus to war against the beyond-belief hops. I think it is worth the $18 and I'm glad to have tried it, but there are a couple others that cost less that I like better.  Going to MI soon, maybe I'll find it on tap.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",Imperial IPA,98

Once the beer warms up a bit you do get the alcohol warming.  D: Medium body with medium carbonation. Smooth and crisp. Alcohol warming once it is swallowed.  O: A True ""Hop Bomb""!

287,17112,stockingcpl,4.13,"Appearance: This brew pours beautifully. A medium amber color with a tanish-almost-light-green foamy head. The hue is a little different, but it evokes the feeling that hops are literally force infused into this brew. Lacings are plentiful. Very interesting! I'm impressed.  Smell: Yep. Hops exude from this selection. The aroma fills the nose and is very pleasant. To a non-hop lover this may be oppressive, but to an experienced beer lover, this is truely perfume. Ahhh...wonderful!  Taste: This selection is definitely a hop heavy brew. The honey provenance of this brew is very mellow and compliments the thin malt flavor. Hops however are the namesake of this type of brew, and this particular selection meets and exceeds all expectations. This is an excellent brew for pure hops lovers. The hops used are very high alpha content selections. This appears to contain American hops. I was not able to detect English or European presence in any of the flavor components.  Mouthfeel: The bitterness of the hops immediately jumps out. I was impressed with the clean snap of flavor onset. There is a little lingering that leaves the palate a little crouded, but that would be expected from an Imperial IPA. This selection would not be acceptable to a novice drinker.  Drinkability: The flavor curve on this brew is huge. The bitterness lingers but is not really an aftertaste in character. I zoomed through this 6-pack, so I guess the drinkability is high for an experienced drinker. However....this is NOT not novice drinkers. An experienced drinker, sitting by the pool on a hot August afternoon will love this!!!! GET THIS SELECTION IF YOU SEE IT!!!!  Prosit!

287,17112,ffejherb,4.52,"On tap at Brass Rail Deli in Campbelltown, PA on 1/26/09.  A - Poured a sparkling clear amber-colored body with modest carbonation and one-finger creamy off-white head that retained very well and left a web of sticky lace around the glass.  S - Hopslam opens with a pungent smack of pine with plenty of sticky, juicy citrus notes. Grapefruit in particular really jumps out. Malt? Hmmmm... sweet caramel perhaps, but it is buried under an veritable mountain of hop goodness! Subtle alcohol notes also creep out in the mix.  T - Initial taste features an abundance of juicy, bittersweet citrus with an equal amount of sticky pine. Some sweet caramel malt makes an appearance in the middle to provide a bit of relief from the onslaught of hops, followed by a a moderate alcohol sting. Finishes with a warm surge of hop bitterness featuring more pine and citrus notes, if you can believe it!  M - Medium bodied with a part oily/part syrupy texture, yet still retains quite a creamy mouthfeel overall. Hopslam is moderately carbonated, resulting in some tongue prickle, and also emits plenty of alcohol warmth across the palate. Finish is unabashedly bitter with a long-lasting duration. It's almost like getting your tongue pricked with pine needles and then sprinkled with grapefruit juice!  D - Hopslam on draft. I've been waiting for the better part of two weeks to finally try this on draft, and it did not disappoint! Simply one of the best DIPAs out there. The alcohol presence knocks the drinkability down just a tad, but otherwise it drinks pretty good for 10%, don't it?!",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",Imperial IPA,98

Great fruit is the most detectable sent also some oranges and lemon. This beer smells like a pine tree that grows oranges, lemons and great fruit. I want the tree that this juice came from. Also lots of caramel sweetness and hints of honey.  T- Waves of honey and citrus juice play on the tongue. Oranges, great fruit and lemons, also some piny bitterness. This is a very hoppy beer but the sweet malt gives it a great balance. Lots of caramel sweetness comes through but then is overtaken by hops, but tries to come through again. Its like a battle between Hops and sweet malty flavors in my mouth and I can't tell which side I want to win. In the end the hops win and I am left with some nice piny bitterness and holds on to each taste bud. Go Hops!  M- This is a mouth coating beer the maltiness coats your mouth then the hop oil clings on. Pretty thick every part of your mouth will feel this beer, perfectly carbonated.

287,17112,coldmeat23,4.2,"Ratings posted are for BATCH #8277 ___  GLASS: Tulip Glass TEMP: Cellared @ approx 50 degrees BATCH #9505 (01-05-10) 4 Months old at review (05-11-10)  Appearance is the same as the one-year old bottle, reviewed below. Still beautiful and impressive.  The nose has a bit more piney hops presence, but that's about the only real difference. Still has a big, sweet, malty presence to back up all of that hoppiness.  Yes, this is quite a bit hoppier than the year-old bottle that I previously had. Lots of big notes of pine tar blend in with the big malty sweetness. At this point though, the hops are still overpowering the sweetness, quite a bit.  I find this body to be not as thick and sticky as my previous bottle. I don't know if that's because of the aging or if it's a recipe tweak. Still medium-bodied and Medium-to-high level of carbonation, which gives it a nice touch of creaminess.  This is nicely drinkable. It is a slight bit too out of balance for me to enjoy all of the time though. Honestly, I think that I prefer the one-year old version a bit more. It has more balance and is easier to drink. Looks like I'll be leaving my other couple of bottles in the cellar! ___  BATCH #8277(01-09-08) This one is a year old. I'll review a fresh one, once I can track down a bottle. Someday....  Nice, hazy, dark golden honey colored liquid. Two-finger head of thick off-white colored foam. Great retention and thick, sticky lacing.  Nice citrus hops are still big with this one. Orange and grapefruit, mostly. Hint of pine. Nice caramel malt presence, now. Nice floral quality.  Hops have definitely mellowed out. Quite abit, I'd guess. Still has a nice piney/grapefruity quality. Also has quite the caramel malt backbone, now. It's really a very balanced beer, right at this point. The honey is easily detectable, also, and I find it to be a very nice component in this brew.  Good solid medium body. Almost sticky, the way it coats your mouth. Traces of it stay there, even after you swallow, then slowly make their way down your throat.  At this age, I find this to be a super drinkable beer. Very well balanced and all around tasty.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",Imperial IPA,98
287,17112,BARFLYB,4.32,"12oz fresh bottle into the flying fish brewing glass. I wanted to dive right into this one and not waste any time or hops.  A- Bells Hopslam comes out of the bottle a light tan color and settles into the glass with a impressive medium orange with gold & bronze highlights. It appears very transparent and upon a closer view small microdots of sediment are seen floating throughout. The one inch deep white head was impressive and creamy causing much foam & dense lacing.  S- Is out of the world piney and citrusy hops up front with honey and a slightly bittering charm. Grapefruit smells explode into the nostrils as well as grassy scents. A pleasure to smell for some time to allow some warming.  T- Hops on top of hops and so forth giving off some floral aspects. Picking up a nice amount of the honey used in this as well. This beer lives up to it's name. Some malts to combine with that honey. As with many DIPA's the grapefruits, mangos and other fruits are also leading the pack. Hopslam gets a bit sweeter with time resulting in more honey. This beer deserves all the accolades it gets.  M- This goes down smooth throughout the 12oz and finishes on the dry side.The honey helps the slight lack of malt to help offset the hops without drowning them. A bit of a slick oily presence to it. Very drinkable at 10% & a hop profile this huge. Alcohol is a non-factor in this case. Medium bodied with good carbonation ad every sip is an eye-opener.  D- I would go through a few of these before it caught up with me but it would be a beautiful ride. A bit on the pricey side but what isn't these days. I would love to drink this occasionally throughout the year but that's impossible without the hops fading after 6 months. Perhaps brewing this twice a year would be a solution.

287,17112,jpiper,4.42,"Golden with orange tinge. 3cm off-white head.  Lots of citrus on the nose and some pine. Not as much floral notes as many west coasters, but very nice. Well, perhaps it is floral... But not in the same way. Light, bright, citrus fruits.  Coats the palate nicely. Some malt backbone and a bit of a grainy taste, but the citrus hops dominate with a little bitterness at the end. Much less than expected. There is sweetness, even beyond what's suggested from the malts. Not a super clean flavor as with Pliny the Elder, but still very nice.  A bit sticky. Medium-bodied. Well-carbonated with medium-sized bubbles.  This is rather drinkable. Very inviting hop profile, but the lack of a clean palate limits its refreshing qualities. The sweetness and lack of a bitter bite make it even more drinkable.  An impressive brew. I think I like it more than the Dreadnaught IPA from Three Floyds, but there is likely to be a side-by-side (maybe with Buckeye '76) in the future. Plenty of interesting hop character, but I think the slight over-reliance on sweetness detracts from the beer - makes it a bit too accessible at the expense of excellence.

S - Very pungent orangey hoppiness, slightly smoky brown sugar malts.  T - Taste starts out with an oily hoppiness and sweet brown sugary malts. Hops get much sweeter and get a more orangey and citrusy flavor, along with a dryer, toastier, smokier malt flavor. Finish leaves an orangey bitterness with a bit of brown sugar.

Two fingers of head, that leaves some lacing.  S - Lots of grapefruit. I mean lots. Pine and resin round out the big hops. American pale malt keeps the aroma light and focused on the fruits. Quite the celebration of hops.  T - If you like hops, this is the beer for you. Hop bite kicks my ass from start to finish. The honey seems to be doing a good job keeping the malt profile dry, with only a small amount of toastiness coming through. Strong grapefruit seems to dominate every flavor in this beer, whether sweet, tart or bitter. Burn in the finish reminds me that this is in fact a 10% APV brew.  M/D - The body is light enough to drink more than one.. as long as you don't have anywhere to do... This is what it is, a big celebration of hops.

Both the grapefruit sweetness and the bitterness of the hops linger for quite a while, providing a nice balance to the beer. The two flavors complement eachother exceptionally well.  Mouthfeel: Feels thick for an IPA, which is good. Body is heavy enough to stand up to the strong flavors. Nicely carbonated as well. Perfect.  Drinkability: This beer absolutely surpasses the hype. It is an absolutely phenomenal beer, and has become my favorite IPA. I don't know if this is supposed to be part of the review or not, but the *only* thing knocking down the drinkability is the price. 18 dollars for a six-pack is a bit prohibitive, despite how good the beer is.

Unfortunately, there really isn't any distinct fruits available in the nose, like with so many Diva's. The flavor is amazing. This beers flavor sums up what I'm always looking for on the first sip of a DIPA. Huge blasts of mango and peaches with some grapefruit trying to wiggle its way forward in the flavor profile. Absolutely magnificent. Also the malt backbone really adds a subtle sweetness the background of the hops. The mouthfeel is everything I want in a DIPA.

The hops are HUGE! Pine and citrus explode in the mouth leaving behind a detritus of sweet honey creamy malt.  This is a great beer, so I feel almost guilty when I want the mouthfeel to be thicker. I understand that it isn't a stout, but because it is so freakin' good, I want it to be thicker and to linger on the tastebuds. Too bad...  I could drink these all day.

Pours pale yellow with rigorous, velvety head that stays intact. Nose is astringent, sweet, grassy, piney, citrusy hops. The honey is unmistakable. The taste is more honey, with an almost-soapy astringency and a candy sweetness. The bitterness is so well balanced by the honey; where so many good IPAs trail off into a metallic aftertaste, this one stays beautiful throughout. Feels thick and tasty, and leaves a bit of a sweet sticky film on your lips.  I've heard Dreadnaught comparisons and they are valid.

I get plenty of tropical fruit and some dank cannibus. The honey makes itself known and plays well with some alcohol which I normally dislike in this style but it compliments this beer nicely. This beer is unique for a DIPA and extremely well-crafted.  M - Creamy. Delicious. Perfect.  D - Very high. I don't know if the alcohol (10%) is well-hidden but the balance and sheer excellence of this beer make it plenty drinkable.  I don't mind that this beer only comes around once a year. It does not take age well and despite claims to the contrary the price is not outlandish at all for a beer with this much hop character. Plus, it comes in 12 oz. bottles rather than overpriced bombers.  Overall, up there with Short's Anniversary and Pliny in the DIPA style for me.

287,17112,UDbeernut,4.72,"6 pack picked up at Heinen's, a local grocery for $17.99.  Batch 8907 poured into a standard pint glass  a: clear amber/orange color. Foamy 1/2"" head with slight retention. Reduces to a lace cap, fair amount of carbonation.  s: nice floral and citrus hop aroma with hint of honey and grapefruit  t: bitterness from the grapfruit and hop dominated up front, finishes with sweatness from malt and honey. The alchohol is well hidden. Very tasty beer.  m&d: medium mouthfeel, the carbonation helps the mouth. The high ABV is not detectable which makes this an extremely drinkable beer.  This is a great beer, I don't know if its worth the extra $8-10 I would pay per six compared to GLBC Commodore Perry IPA, but certainly is one every hop head needs to try.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",Imperial IPA,98
287,17112,Ezekiel81923,4.72,"Purchased at the Beeryard, Batch #8913. Poured into my Sam Adams Perfect Pint from a 12oz bottle.  Appearance: Very nice orange/amber color. Clear. Semi-aggressive pour yields a 1 to 1.5 finger head. Decent head retention, but once its gone a swirl or two brings it all back.  Smell: Nice floral, citrusy, mild grapefruity aroma with a touch of honey. As the beer warms the honey smell becomes much more prevalent.  Taste: Wow. A beer well worth all the hype. A nice malty flavor with some citrus and a dash of grapefruit with a warm, honey aftertaste. No indication of the high alcohol ABV. Incredibly balanced brew. Like the smell, the honey flavor comes out more as the beer warms and lingers on the tongue with a touch of hoppy bitterness/dryness.  Mouthfeel: Smooth, with a drying aftertaste. Nice carbonation balances with bitterness and the honey. Despite my repetitive mention of the honey, it merely accentuates the strong malt character at the beginning and the bitterness at the end. Beautifully i might add.  Drinkability: Incredible. Absolutely no hint of alcohol, unless perhaps the beer is allowed to warm and flatten. I could drink these all day, but the alcohol hits you nonetheless, and is the only limiting factor.  A world-class brew worth the hype, the price, the case limits, everything. Find it, buy it, love it. Bell's HopSlam and Troeg's Nugget Nectar make January and February the most enjoyable winter months.

287,17112,cvstrickland,4.47,"Poured into my DFH shaped pint glass, the 2009 version of Bell's infamous HopSlam Ale is bright golden copper and topped with a couple of fingers of soft bright-white foam. The head hangs around quite a while, settling slowly by consolidating its smaller bubbles into a soapy foam that clings to the glass in thick webs and stringy ribbons.  The aroma of the drink doesn't flatten me like the (un?)fortunate character on the label, but it is quite huge and pungent, with notes of sugary pineapple grilled over spruce, sprinkled with candied lemon zest, then pureed with potent pine resin and sent to the bottling line.  The taste is crisp and honey-on-toast malty sweet, with a huge countering blast of a tangy lemon-juice infusion, bitter citrus zest and just the right amount of cleansing, warming alcohol. A mild malty oiliness laced with white grapefruit and navel orange rind coats the mouth, keeping the zippy, fruity sweetness in contact with the tastebuds, prolonging a refreshing fruity-hoppiness that finally winds down, terminating in a touch of lingering dryness that commands the drinker to have another sip. I obey without argument.  The drink is heavy-medium in body with great carbonation and feel. Though alcohol is a significant presence in the flavor and the belly-warming nature of the drink, HopSlam is a highly quaffable credit to the talented folks at Bell's.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",Imperial IPA,98

287,17112,PatrickJR,4.48,"Celebrating my 500th review with my first ever bottle of HopSlam!  Poured from a 12 oz bottle into oversized snifter.  A - Slightly hazy orangish copper. Two fingers of white head rise and hang around for a couple of minutes before falling to a thin cap. Some lacing. Lots of DIPAs have looked a lot better.  S - Fantastic smell here full of the entire spectrum of hop aromas. Almost simultaneously I get big hits of pine, tropical fruits (lychees and pineapple come to mind), and grass. Behind the scenes are a touch of orange juice and lemon peel a light whiff of alcohol. Herbal and tea-like aromas mildly compliment a pastry-like sweetness.  T - I've been bouncing between 4 and 5 this entire time, and I think I've finally settled on the current score. Initially there is a HUGE wash of pine flavor on the palate accompanied by moderate to strong fruity notes of apricot, apple, and pineapple. A hint of rosemary flavors melds with a simple, bready sweetness not unlike powdered sugar on baked bread. As the sweetness fades late palate the grapefruit pith bitterness grows to moderate to high levels but somehow keeps itself from being harsh or medicinal tasting. Small alcohol burn in the finish accentuates the bitterness. HopSlam ends on a bitter herbal and bark-like note.  M - Medium bodied with a moderate carbonation. Very smooth, but a little thinner that I would've expected.  D - For a huge, hopped up beer, HopSlam is deceptively drinkable. The alcohol, while noticable, doesn't detract but rather adds to the experience. There's a great level of sweetness to counteract some of the craziness from the hops but at no point does HopSlam become malt driven. I wouldn't ""slam"" these down but it has been quite pleasant to drink, especially considering a lowered malt presence. I'm nearly done with this one, and I unquestionably want another.  I'm not sure if this lives up to the hype or not but it is a great beer at the very least. In a lot of ways it probably wasn't what I was expecting but I've tried to review as if I'd simply seen this on a shelf during a stroll through the beer store one day. While this is nothing short of a great beer as I said earlier, it's perhaps not necessarily ground breaking in the world of DIPAs. HopSlam's most notable feature is it's interesting balance, which keeps things incredibly interesting and incredibly drinkable.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",Imperial IPA,98
287,17112,turamarth,4.32,"Poured into a new Belgium globe.  Appearance: Cloudy honey color. Poured a big white head that leaves really nice lacing.  Smell: Lots of hops....naturally. This is HopSlam. Very piney, some citrus, maybe some ""herbs"". Very hoppy. There might be a hint of sweetness from what malts are there and the honey in it.  Taste: Again, HOPS. Piney. Some grassy notes. There is a little malt sweetness to balance. This is very hoppy, but is not so bitterly unbalanced that it wants to turn my face inside out.  Mouth: Feels really smooth, and sweet. Goes down like a charm.  Drink: The smoothness of this is countered only by the 10% abv. Which is preasent only slightly. But, you do feel it. This could be a sneaky one!",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",Imperial IPA,98
287,17112,dza360,4.22,"Wow...  First the great story of how I got a bottle of this beer. I was talking to my local beer store guru about what brewerys were likely to make an entry into Kansas this year, and I inquired about Bell. I was told not very likely in the near future.... but I happen to have a single bottle of Hopslam from a friend and you can have it. I am loyal customer, but what a great gift to give up a favorite that you can't get in the state.  On to the beer. Balance! Pretty close to perfect balance for the style.  Wonderful golden color with a slight amber tinge. Head pours bone and thick, giving up to a lingering white top, some lacing.  Smell is grapefruit and floral, from the first whiff you know you have something great in your hands.  Taste, again almost perfect balance, all the expected hops but really not overwhelming on any front, maybe a little less complex than the smell would have you believe. I think the honey gives this almost a creamy finish.  Mouthfeel is just right for the style, again I think the honey is working here to beef up and keep the liquid a little heavy.  Drinkability... WTF the bottle says 10%? If this is true I would say hands down I have never had a beer that concealed the alcohol so completely. If this was available to me regularly I think I could put away a lot in a session. Probably good that I cant get it, because at 10% i would probably pay the price.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",Imperial IPA,98

Lots of grapefruity, citrusy, smells with some piney aromas as well. I am also getting a touch of sweetness as well. Maybe from the honey. Taste freakin awesome it's a shame the beer strore had a two six pack limit. This thing is loaded with hops but there not overpowering very citrusy with some grapefruit flavors as well. There is a slight bitter finish but doesn't leave a lingering aftertaste. I should be careful with this stuff it is way too drinkable. I can hardly detect any alcohol.

Not to fear.  Pours a nice orange color, decent head but not frothy. Nose is pink grapefruit.I was expecting a sweetish type Double; No way. Citrus taste is the 1st on tongue, nice bitterness, but not overly aggressive. Very nicely balanced, not overly anything but great. Not boozy and the 10% is completely hidden.I was slurping the bottom of the glass when I was done. Drink ability is down a fraction due to the high ABV, I could easily drink a six, but I'd be staggeringly shit faced.

287,17112,Reagan1984,4.54,"Three Cheers for iceicebaby for providing this in a recent trade. Thanks man!!!  Hop presence certainly lives up to its name.  About a finger of fizzy head forms atop the beer. It slowly fades a thin film sitting on the light honey colored beer with excellent clarity.. Really nice lacing.. Not a bubble of visible carbonation.  WOW, big fresh aroma.. Hopslam would be correct. Fresh, floral... And very pine like aroma.... Sometimes I play games with myself in grapefruit vs. Pine... This one is more pine like to me. And you can smell the layered malts here two. Very nice.  Wonderful malts for a moment... a touch of cracker then SLAM.... Pine resin.... A touch of alcohol and back to the pine...As it cools a little on the tongue you go back through the layers of malt again.... Similar malt flavors to Two Hearted... I guess that's not totally shocking.. Wonderful lingering bitterness.... That is still fresh all the way.  Mouthfeel is just shy of sticky and the flavor is full and powerful.... While this is a big beer it's still wonderfully drinkable. I can see why it's a classic.  Great Beer.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",Imperial IPA,98
287,17112,gibby,4.8,"On tap at TJ's. Figured I should stop by while the hop slam is still around. So good on draft. Thick soapy head with huge lacing left on glass. Very sweet smell to it, honey, hops, hops and more hops. Nice malt to it so its not a hop bomb by any means. Goes down insanely smooth for being 10% abv. I had 2 9oz pours @ $5.50 each but I could of easily had a couple more if I had a designated driver. I got buzzed farily quickly b/c I had no lunch. Fantastic brew and highly recommended. Cheers.  On a side note: Hop slam is great but the prices are getting crazy. A take out sixer was $26, other local places are around $20. Cases range from $60-74 bucks depending where you go. Hopslam is a great beer and I will buy a case this year, but if it goes much higher next year count me out.

Pours with &lt;1 finger of white head, which fades quickly into a thin, sporadic cap. Ample lacing.  S- Citrusy/grapefruit/pine-hop scents dominate. Hard to savor for long, as this aroma has me ready to dive right in...  T- Citrus/grapefruit and pine dominate, balanced by touch of malty sweetness. Bitterness level is borderline perfection. Big ABV% is expertly blended.  M- Carbonation is moderate. Slick and oily, goes down smooth.  D- Extraordinarily drinkable for its 10% ABV. Almost mind-bogglingly so....it would be easy to get carried away with this elixir and find yourself waking up groggily from a ditch alongside of some random highway...  Future outlook: Not sure about the hype of this one, but decided to dive in along with a fellow BA'er with similar hype-phobic misgivings...just as he was, I was blown away by this one. Dynamite.

287,17112,Joeynocturnum,4.07,"I would have to say this did not live up to the hype. In the last week I have sampled Pliny and Blind Pig on draft and have finished about 6 Nugget Nectars, and I feel that Slam has fallen well short of all three.  a= Average appearance, slightly cloudy with some good lacing. s= A mild aroma of hops overtaken by the smell of both honey and alcohol. t= I stuggled to find the Hops through the 10% ABV and the honey. It was good, but lacked the great taste of hops that I anticipated. m= Nothing really stood out in. Lacked some of the dryness that I have come to appreciate from great IPA.'s d= Was drinkable, don't think it could be a session beer for me, like I thought of the Pig and the Nugget.  (All in all, I was extremely disappointed. It is the first Bell's offering that I've sampled that has let me down. I will give it another try and hope that maybe I was just having an off day. In the mean time I am getting another case of Nugget.) Maybe my pallate has changed over the last year or I am becoming more of a hophead but I went back and edited my scores.

287,17112,Kadonny,4.35,"200th review!  Poured from tap into a snifter glass at TJs in Paoli. Fresh 2008/9 batch.  A: A cloudy medium orange color with a minimal off white head. Full glass lacing coats.  S: When cold my first smell was grapefruit and pine with a substantial malt sweetness.  T: Again, first sips when cold where grapefruit hops, pine, lemon and a bready malty backround. However, upon letting the beer warm up it changes quite a bit. On warming I get more floral piney hops with still a very strong malt sweet backbone and the alcohol comes slamming through. The more it warms, the more you taste the 10%. Finish is alcoholic with not a ton of bitterness.  M: Full and coating with lots of alcohol burn.  D: Medium. One from tap was enough for me. I had actually planned to have 2, but after one I needed to move on.  Overall still a great, great beer but it suffers a bit from the alcohol feel to it. Great hops flavors that really shine and this continues to be a top notch beer. I actully think I prefer it from a bottle as it is more drinkable.  Edited: Update on 2009/2010 version at TJs on 1/13/2010. Lots of grapefruit this year, when warming flavors turn to more orange citrus. Sweetness is very strong on finish with the bitterness getting pounded down. Alcohol is much LESS showing this year,even when warming and it allows you to enjoy more than one (if you can handle the alcohol). Great beer.  Overall this year is a terrific batch of Hopslam. So drinkable and so enjoyable it's crazy. Awesome.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",Imperial IPA,98
287,17112,MasterSki,4.43,"Batch 8912 (January 13th, 2009) - only 9 days old! Poured into my Kuhnhenn tulip.  A - The color of amber & gold - semi-transparent with a few tiny bubbles lazily rising upwards. Huge, frothy, two-fingered, foam that takes forever to dissipate (managed to eat a snack while waiting!) and leaves tons of intricate lacing. I'm not sure what else you could ask for visually.  S - Fresh hops, with a huge bouquet of citrus and floral scents. There's lemon, tangerine, grapefruit, pineapple, apricot, and a touch of honey. I can smell this inches away from the glass - delicious! Very well balanced as well!  T - The taste is significantly more bitter - there's a hoppy fierceness at the onset but it mellows a little as it moves through one's mouth letting the other flavors come out and play. The aftertaste isn't overwhelming, which is a pleasant surprise. There's the tiniest hint of booziness. It's really good, but not on par with the smell.  M - Crisp and refreshing. Surprisingly light-bodied for such a strong beer. Not over-carbonated, which is really nice. Leaves a resinous oily coating behind.  D - This is 10%? Really? Are you joking? I'd happily drink 2-3 of these, and I'd probably want more (even though I'd be stupid drunk). Damn I wish this available year-round - or that Bell's brought the San Diego Big Head during the summer.

Taste - the base of the caramel malt gets a fair start, but these hops are the main stage and prove it immediately. Sweet, almost syrupy, certainly boozy, but oh so tasty. The same citrusy components in the smell are here in force, as billed. The swallow removes the beer from the mouth but not the flavor.

Strong grapefruit and orange zest smell. Some honey as well.  Taste is like I am eating flowers (which I have not done). There is such an incredible hop flavor to it. There is such a grapefruit flavor to it. I would also say it has a slight bready malt flavor to it and honey.  Mouthfeel is bitter, but it is not even bad compared to any other ipa or iipa. The beer also gets smooth near the end. The one great part about this beer is that it doesn't leave a hardcore dry sticky aftertaste. The 10% abv is masked so well in this beer.

Then a more tamed wave of pine and grass. No noticeable alcohol either!  Taste - sometimes a great smelling beer can be a letdown on the palate. Not HopSlam. It tastes fantastic - grapefruit and pine hops, some balancing malt and a long, clean bitter finish that invites you back way too quickly for another swig. Good god this is well made beer.

The smell of this beer is absolutely out of this world - strong grapefruit and apricot citrusy is up front, with a subtle hint of hoppy piney-ness. Spectacular!  Taste is what I've been waiting for. This beer is so well balanced contrary to the smell. One might expect it to have a super bitter taste given the way it smells (plus the name), but this beer is all about major amounts of hops but enough malt and hops to make things very well balanced.

You can smell your glass from around 3 feet away, it is as pungent as it gets. Just delicious. Taste is stellar as well. It is a hop fest, with almost no malt, but somehow the finish is mellow. Where you expect an insane and almost overwhelming bitterness, you get a pleasant hint of sweetness instead. Could it be honey that causes this gentle finish? Whatever magic mojo they have working, who cares, it's darn good, probably the best DIPA I've had. Can't believe it is 10%, that could get you into trouble really quick. So drinkable, that smooth finish doesn't destroy your palate, encouraging you to have another.  Yes this is a pretty pricey beer and it is a limited release, but you know what, who cares?

287,17112,youngleo,3.97,"Poured to a one fingered head that didnt last long. Did have some big bubbles around the edges and left some lacing. Ale was yellowish brown in color. Head had a slight orange tint. Smelled like grapefruit, pine, and malt. No alcohol was detected. Had a strong grapefruit flavor. Along with that piney hops. Also hints of malt. Had a slight bitter aftertaste. Actually not as strong as I thought it would be. Felt good in the mouth. I thought the carbonation was right. Another ale that you would have to be carefull while enjoying. The taste is so good and smooth, all you want to do is gulp it down. With the higher alcohol content you would have to be carefull. I had a good buzz after two.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",Imperial IPA,98
287,17112,WakeandBake,4.64,"Clear orange poor with a small offwhite head and a little lacing. Aromas of grapefruit zest, oranges, peaches, pepper, pine, creamy caramel and hoppy. Sweet start but the bitter peppery bitterness hits you big time right at the end. Slightly sweeter than most IIPAs. Alcohol is present but far from overwhelming. Smooth, creamy and velvetty mouthfeel. Taste is very citrusy and very hoppy as well. Tastes amazingly fresh.As it warms the flavor changes to a very nice sugary grapefruit. Very Good.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",Imperial IPA,98
287,17112,midnite2sixman,4.47,"Pour: Light orange in color with a lot of lacing and a frothy head.  Smell: Citrus blast along with the obvious Hops. Lots of pine. A bit of fruitiness too.  T: Smooth and even despite being so hop heavy. Quite a delight to drink. Cannot get over how easy this is to drink.  M: Too easy, and too smooth for a beer this potent.  D: Heck yes. Drink it and drink it often.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",Imperial IPA,98
287,17112,optiontwo,4.5,"10oz. pour at the midnight release at Bryant Lake Bowl. Walked in to have a tasty app and a beer and found out this was happening so I had to stick around.  Appearance: Hazy dark orange with gold and red hues, quarter inch white head with decent retention, and medium lacing.  Smell: Resinous hops with all the citrus aroma you could ask for but more complexity than one would think. First the expected grapefruit and pine, but then some grassiness, and finally sweet malt smell. Can't wait to dive in.  Taste: This is truly one hoppy M F'er. It starts with a bitter bite, let's you taste some of those delicious fruit flavors the aroma promised, and then comes back to kick you with hop bitterness again, finishing with slight heat from the alcohol. Also in the background is the grassiness detected in the smell but it's hard to notice at first because of the initial hop attack. Candied grapefruit, orange, and lemon come to mind and are the dominant fruit flavors but for some reason I feel like I can taste grape or cherry in there, odd but delicious.  Mouthfeel: Plenty of carbonation, medium body (for a DIPA), bitter bite throughout, and alcohol heat at the end.  Drinkability: This is one to be careful with. It's so good that you'll want more and more but two glasses and you're easily past tipsy.  Overall: The way that Two Hearted opened my eyes to craft brew and IPAs, Hopslam opened my eyes to more extreme beers and DIPAs. I have plenty to thank Bell's for. I've had lots of DIPAs since my first Hopslam but it still sits as one of my favorites. Try this beer.  *Note: It's hard to recall but I feel like this tasted a little more earthy/grassy than last years. Maybe this is fresher than I had ever tried it last year, either way not a bad thing. I'd be curious to find out what kind of hops they use, if I had to guess a couple I'd say centennial is in there and maybe amarillo or cascade.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",Imperial IPA,98
287,17112,Itoclown,4.92,"Purchased in a six pack from Wayne's Deli in Muskegon. Drank out of a Duvel tulip. Waited 2 weeks to finally buy it.  Look: Orange/Light brown with a little frothy head. Foam stays around the edge of the glass until completely consumed. Smell: When I opened it, I could smell it from two feet away. This is the best smelling beer I've ever smelled. EVER. Smells heavy of hops and pine. Smooth smell. Taste/mouthfeel: Delicious hops that mirrors the smell. This is the best ""extreme"" hops beer I've ever had. Quenches your thirst. Also has hints of pine and citrus. You can't taste the alcohol at all.  Overall: Just as awesome as I remembered it last year. Unbelievable brew. Sucks that it's only out one month a year but I guess it makes the taste even more desired. If you haven't tried it. GET IT NOW! Get it fresh. This definitely holds up to its status as one of the top beers in the world. So lucky to come from Michigan.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",Imperial IPA,98

S: Smells of pine and grapefruit.  T: Tastes like it smells. The hops are not overpowering, though they make their presence known. The honey is difficult to taste but tames the hops for balance.  M: Medium mouthfeel, slightly oily that coats the tongue and keeps the taste in the back of your mouth.  D: Easy to drink more than one, but be careful.

Smells of brilliant grapefriut citrus hops with a touch of apricot and malt. Freshly cut citrus comes to mind. Absolutly the best smelling beer on earth. Tastes of citrusy grapefruit with a perfect touch of honey. Brilliantly balanced.

287,17112,jebert,4.75,"This is it...round two of a Grand Slam! Last year's batch, #8283 was my first encounter with this luxurious, liquid libation. This year's batch, #8908 is all about consistency, strength amid weakness, and forbearance against a long, cold winter. Following last year's release, I managed to round up the remaining several 6 packs in close proximity of La Crosse as well as 4 additional ones from Eau Claire. This year, I made a point to special order two cases of the Slam.  Last night, I opened on of my two remaining batch #8283's. This was 365 days from initial bottling. Today, #8908 awaits my unworthy lips. Packaged January 5th, it's a wonder it arrived in WI within days of bottling.  One unique aspects of this beer is the label. An all green (hoppy) background contains three giant hops concealing what must be a stallwart individual. Beneath the hops, laid out flat on his back is a brutus of a man. Check out the two arms. Not the hairs. Check out the feet. Size 12-13, to be sure. The batch number is conspicuously printed on the side of the label. Go out to www.bellsbeer.com and enter the batch number.  Original Gravity: 1.087 Alc. by Volume: 10.0% - 280 Calories  Get ready...this is a ""A biting, bitter, tongue bruiser of an ale. With a name like Hopslam, what did you expect?""  Presentation: Typical brown glass, 12 oz bottle. The cap tightly sealed, gasped as I popped it open, wondering why it's owner waited so long. I retain the Bell's impronted cap and added it to my wall of fame. This is a keeper.  Appearance: - This beer pours to a light orange pineapple colour with a delightfully busy swirl of hoppy bubbles. Perfect carbonation, as I've seen from mostinf not all of Bell's beer. A nice, 1.5"" dirty but thick creamy head lasts forever. Catching the light, a slight yellow hue glances at me, tempting a sudden engagement.  Smell - A stalwart grassy, citris nose, comprised mostly of watermelon, grapefruit and pineapple. a after scent of mango, perhaps sits just aside of the main rise. The tone of this beer is sensual, espeially considering the blast of hops that awaits the tase. I can't imagine a better nose.  Taste - This is the bomb. It starts semi-sweet, almost candy-like but quickly ascends to a much stronger, multi-dimensional flavourful hop-ness. The flavor is big and juicy and very fruitful. A bit peachy, not at all a dry bitter hop, but wet. Notes include grapefruit citrius. The hops build after the first sip for an interminable period of time, eventually softened by the honey intermingled with the hops. The balance is awesome, softly taking one from that bitter hop experience found in the height of Ashbury Park to the calm, solitude of Arlington. Fallen soldiers don't exist here, only satisfaction, pure and simple.  Mouthfeel - This beer has a great mouthfeel, just a tad past medium with a thick, but slippery texture. The malt firmness structures this beer perfectly to suspend the delivery of the hops in a steady blast from start to finish.  Drinkability - This beer's depth of flavor and beautiful hop flavor is so well balanced (did I say balanced?) that one wonders how the label can be so misleading. Unknown to the casual drinker, this ""biting, bitter, tongue bruiser"" can easiliy sneak up on the drinker, rendering them useless to operate any tpe of machinery. This occurs, not due to the hops, but the awesome drinkability, whilst the 10% alcohol hits. I've found that, two bottles per night means an early bed time, but a great time getting there.  I'm going to enjoy the two cases tucked away in a cool place. 48 bottles means one bottle per week until next January.  Thanks for sharing, Larry Bell.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",Imperial IPA,98
287,17112,DrewOSU,4.32,"12 ounce bottle, served in a tulip, purchased at Belmont Party Source in Dayton, OH. Batch 8913, bottled 1/12/2009. Fresh!!  A: Poured a darkish orange to a very light amber color. ¼ inch head on initial pour, disappearing quickly to almost non existent. A small amount of watery, thin, white lacing that does not stick very long. Glass is totally clear of lacing after finishing.  S: A very pale nose with loud citrus notes. Subtle pine and slightly sour fruit qualities as well.  T: Initial malt taste, followed by a ""slam"" of dry accented pine, hoppiness. The aftertaste is all oily, bitter hops on the tongue and roof of the mouth. There was a lighter alcohol presence than I expected for being a 10% APV, however you can definitely detect it in the aftertaste. The alcohol seems very balanced or just overpowered by the immense hop taste.  MF: Medium body, very wet and slightly oily.  D: With the big hops and the high APV, there is no way I could drink more than one of these in a sitting. However, the bottle I did have was excellent from start to finish.  I first had Hopslam on tap at Dilly Deli in Marimont, OH last year, but I was excited to sit down and actually analyze it deeper this time around. I found this beer to be surprisingly easy to drink, but a total pallet killer all the same. It has taken me a while to do this review as new things come to me each time I take a drink. This is a very complex beer for a ""hop bomb"".",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",Imperial IPA,98

Batch #8907, brewed on January 6, 2009 and sampled 10 days later.  Appearance: Pours with 1 1/2 fingers of nearly white head. Settles slowly into a very dense foam. Medium amount of lacing. Beer itself is golden with occasional bubble of activity. No sediment in the bottle.  Smell: Overwhelming floral hops with honey sweetness in the finish. More flower like than the traditional citrus or pine aromas from most dry-hopping.  Taste: Mouthfilling floral hops which fades almost imperceptibility into a strong hop bitterness. The full progression of hop flavors, from dry hopping ,through flavor hops, to the bitterness of isomerized humulone.  Mouthfeel: Average carbonation level. Body is great.  Drinkability: Awesome. Unlike any other IIPA/DIPA I have ever had. A truly unique experience.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",Imperial IPA,98

It might be through the power of suggestion, but I love the honey sweetness in this one. Some DIPAs have a ""rough"" sweetness. The honey, though, seems to smooth things out instead. I love this one.

That's a lot of hops. Too much for me, I think. Again, floral and citrusy.  M - it's a fresh Bells beer.  D - too many hops for me.

A= This ale poured a mildly hazed orange-gold color with a 3/4"" mostly white head that dropped to almost zero rather quickly. Decent web of thin lace down the glass.  S= Aromas of biscuity pale malt, a pinch of caramel malt, and loads of west coast hops (one or more of the 4 C's play a big part here). Hops provide the classic pine/citrus notes and blend incredibly well with a big alcohol presence that somehow doesn't ever seem ""hot"".  T= Simply sublime. Things start off with a rich and heady maly sweetness, followed by a drier biscuity note, then the hops came in and swept all hint of malt aside with a beautiful rush of bitter hop oils, tangy citrus, and puckering pine. The finish was mildly dry with an alcohol presence that was there but not unpleasant in any way.  MF= Medium bodied with a moderately crisp feel. Slightly slick and oily on the tongue.  D= Wow, this is every bit as fantastic as I remembered it. I could go on and on, but suffice it to say that this was delicious and I will drink as much as I can possibly attain while it is fresh.

Smell is so amazing, I wish I could give it a 6. Pineapple, grapefruit, green apple, with a component of dank, grassy kind bud.  Taste has a sweet counterbalance (must be the honey) to the hops that kick in immediately upon sipping. Floral, citrus hops with a Puckering bitter finale.  I believe the hype. This is truly a unique DIPA. Not the most bitter hop bomb but a truly well crafted ale.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",Imperial IPA,98
287,17112,cjgator3,4.92,"Pours a golden orange color with a white head. The aroma is hops, hops and more fresh hops with some malt and a touch of alcohol in the background. There is a lot of grapefruit and other citrus in the aroma from the hops. The taste like the aroma suggests is dominated by the fresh citrusy hop flavors. There is also a solid malt backbone, but it is overshadowed by the delicious hop profile. The drinkability is extremely high for a brew of this caliber, however it is probably not a good idea to drink more than a couple of these in one sitting.

Less hoppy than I had anticipated, but there is still a satisfying amount of it, as well as a great balance.  Taste of strong hops, honey, citrus, and a hint of alcohol. Finishes with a lasting hop flavor and a bit of grain. This is more like it, a very hoppy Imperial IPA that doesn't have too much hop punch or too much alcohol, I love it.

A: Pours a beautiful amber color with a 2 or 3 fingers of head.  S: Jesus. I don't know if it's the honey or what but this beer's smell is indescribable. It's similar to the smell of Nugget Nectar, only more intense and a bit sweeter.  T: ""Tastes just like it smells....DELICIOUS"" - Dave Chappelle. Unbelievable blend of hoppiness and sweetness, with almost no alcohol burn at all. As close to beer perfection as I've ever tasted.  M: Just the right amount of body. It's not so thin that you're wondering if you're drinking dasani with food coloring in it, but it's not so thick that you feel like you just liquified a turkey.  D: 10 percent?? Are you kidding? It drinks like a session beer, and as such is quite dangerous.  Overall, the best beer I've ever had period. I'm a mid atlantic guy, so my craft beer foray began with Troegs.

Nearly perfect visuals, a big and thick hazy copper orange that radiates beautifully with a contrasting creamy buff foam.  S. The age comes through hear a lot, as the hops are still present but are giving off an old tea-like smell. Has a wet hop scent to it, good caramel, a some sweetness to it. Showing some barleywine characteristics here.  T. Start off very smooth with some sweet caramel. The hops are still alive and kickin', but are definitely more subdued and come off much more smooth and conservatively. Ends with a slight off after taste, but it's not displeasing.

You can feel the honey  Drinkability: Tasty and enjoyable, I try to get some every year  ***  Tried fresh 2-12-09  Similar, with less complexity, more bitterness, less fruit and honey.

287,17112,chicagospots,4.89,"This has to be one of the hoppiest beers I have ever tasted. Bells Two Hearted Ale is my favorite beer in the hoppy category. Bells Hop Slam is a turbo-jolted version of the Two Hearted Ale with more alcohol and hop character.  This is a sipping beer. For me it's too powerful (10% ABV) to have more than one. I drink it from a snifter glass to get my big nose in the bowl and let the hops tickle my olfactory glands.  You'll find the usual citrus, grassy notes from the hops with just the right amount of bitters.  Hop Slam is only available in January and I believe most of the distribution is in or around the midwest so stock up.

Smells sweet more than hoppy, but pine comes through the malts. Taste is nice and balanced. It's creamy and sweet with a nice bitter aftertaste. A great beer that I would gladly take more of.  Edit: I received fresh bottles from the 09 release.  A much larger hop presence, smells of pineapple and citrus drenched in honey.

287,17112,ATPete,4.77,"12oz bottle  i was lucky enough to drink 7 of these in the past 3/4 months. took notes through out, and the conclusion is that this beer is absolutely killer. Beautiful orange brown color, small white head. Amazing pine notes in the nose, sweetened grapefruit and orange peel, lots of earthy grassy hops battle with the fresh, semi sweet citrusy hops, all of this is overseen by a very rugged malty backbone adding incredible balance. Coating but smooth, the 10% ABV is completely masked by the beers more than impressive flavor profile. Some say this beer is best fresh but i was equally impressed with every single bottle i cracked open, my most recent being 11/2/08. Cant wait to get some more this year.

287,17112,waltonc,4.87,"Acquired via trade with hrking, thanks very much.  I first had this a while ago, but didn't appreciate it nearly as much as I do now upon retasting. Appearance is a hazy amber color with substantial white head. Smell and taste is hoppy, but very well balanced by malts and honey. What a welcome break from west coast IPAs. This reminds me of Dogfish 90. Mouthfeel is medium, sticky, and well carbonated. Highly guzzleable, I'd put this up there with Dogfish 90 and Burton Baton as one of my favorite IPAs. Not surprising, coming from my favorite brewer.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",Imperial IPA,98
287,17112,marksto,4.08,"Pours a medium amber color, very cloudy and hazy. Small whitish head falls quickly. Aroma displays a honeyish sweetness followed by some hoppy, piney notes. Faint aromas of apricot and citrus are there too. I didn't find the aroma to be that big compared to other great DIPA's.  Flavor displays big malt and lots of hop flavor and bitterness. The honey does not come through here, it's in the nose but masked by the hop complexity in flavor. The usual american hop essences come through, pine and citrus.  I suspected this bottle might have a bit of age to it. Checking the Bell's website I see a feature allowing one to enter the batch number. How cool! This was brewed in January 08, so it's got a little under a year on it. Not as old as I thought it might be. This is certainly a good DIPA, but there are better ones out there.

Smell was pineapple/citrus smell with a malt scent that tells you this is a heavy hitter.  Taste was bitter throughout, very little alcohol bite for the 10%abv. Nice sweet finish. If someone told you this was a session beer they might believe you.Very well balanced.  This beer did not brooze my touge from the bitterness, like the label suggests. Iam used to west coast iipas so my touge may be different than some. If I could get this in my state I would buy it on occasion, but I wouldnt trade for it again. Awsome label. Glad to have tried.

287,17112,roadhouse,4.89,"Original tasting, 1/27/08, the one the ratings are for:  Poured from 12 oz. bottle into a snifter.  Appears a beautiful orange amber color with a one finger head. It doesn't leave a ton of lace, but not bad at all.  Aroma of piney hops and tropical fruit with a bit of citrus in the background. There's a big malty sweet backbone that makes this even better.  Flavors of piney hops and citrus with a tinge of alcohol. The honey it not detectable in the taste really, but there's definitely a malty sweetness that back up the hops well. Some tropical fruit taste comes through in the beginning. The hops are always front and center and very fresh tasting. The tropical fruitiness comes out right before the finish.  Medium-full mouthfeel. Finishes smoothly leaving a nice bitter aftertaste on the tongue.  This has to be the best DIPA that I've had, and nothing can beat it in drinkability. You might have trouble not being able to control yourself from finishing the six pack. It's just that good. Make sure you don't have anything to do the next morning after you start up on this one. Best DIPA in existence.  10/24/08 tasting, 9 months in: The aroma is much more mellow on the hops and now I can definitely pick up the honey that was covered up by the intense hops before. The taste is much weaker, the hops only coming through at about 30% of what they were before. Still tasty, but it doesn't even taste like the same beer.

287,17112,PatronWizard,3.97,Another score in an awesome trade box from Kadonny.  Looks like orange marmalade. I've been saying that a lot lately but so what: it does. White head.  Modest hop smell.

287,17112,scootny,4.47,"A 12 oz bottle, long neck. "" Ale brewed with honey"" . A honeyed amber in my tulip tumbler with a one finger off-white head. A gentle fade and a ring remains around the glass. Moderate carbonation and a bit of chill haze. Once warmed a little it goes clear.  Smell reveals the honey along with piney hops and a toffee tinged maltiness. Juicy grapefruit and tropical fruits as well.  Taste is not as bitter as advertised. Or maybe I'm in love. Don't get me wrong, the hops hit the back of the throat and fold the edges of your tongue with force but the big malt backbone gives superb balance. Major grapefruit and pine resin. The honey adds another dimension to the broad and somewhat bready malt structure. Finish is Wham Bam Hops with an earthy and a spicy edge leading to toasty breads and grahm. Where is the alcohol in this stuff, I feel it but it pulls a Claude Rains.  Mouthfeel is tingly and smooth with a light syrup consistency.  Drinkability is better than a 10 percent abv has a right to be. A sipper to be sure but it is so inviting that you take bigger ones than you should. A marvelous concoction.

Hints of tangerine and apricot, orange rind and a hint of alcohol.  In the mouth, the alcohol is quite apparent. Quite hot actually. It is quite sweet but the malt provides very little body to offset the copious amounts of bitingly bitter hops. The hops are pretty unpleasant actually without the malt to offset the spice. It comes off exceedingly harsh. And thin! Long hoppy aftertaste.  Wow, really lacking as a double IPA. It's kind of a mess. Horrendously overrated. A fantastic brewery (the best brewer of stouts in America in my estimation) but this is a beer that is surprisingly lacking in craftmanship and taste.

287,17112,stoutman,4.5,"A great awesome hoppy brew. Pours an orangeish amber, with a thick white head. Aroma of honey and very strong hops. The flavor is a delicious blend of citrusy hops with a honey sweetness unlike the typical maltiness of many imperial IPAs. The alcohol is also prominent, but not in a bad way. This is a favorite beer when in mood for hops.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",Imperial IPA,98

Interesting...I thought I would smell just a hop explosion, but I also get plenty of malts and the honey is readily apparent as well. Hints of clover, grapes, figs and grape-nuts cereal. Smells like a fresh grapefruity barleywine.  What crazy combination of hops is this? Awesome. Loads of alcohol, but it is hidden pretty well for 10%. Just the right amount of honey makes a great combination with the bitterness. Hints of raw carrots and figs.  Very unique, very strong and very tasty!

287,17112,kzoobrew,4.63,"Batch 9478 Rereview with a fresh bottle.  Poured into Duvel tulip. Moderately strong pour produces a two and a half finger fluffy white head. Slowly works its way back leaving plenty of sticky lacking around the perimeter of the glass. Retention is great, a cap roughly half a finger tall remains for the duration. Bright orange body not totally clear, slight haze. Nearly picture perfect.  Juicy citrus and resinous hop aromas are abundant. Sweet orange and pineapple smells, possible the freshest citrus smell that can be found in a DIPA. Fresh, the nose is dominated by the hops malt is completely overwhelmed.  Flavor is combination of sweet and bitterness. Sweet citric flavors roll on to the palate first. Bitterness more noted on the back of the palate and lingers. Pleasant sweetness compliments the citric hop flavors and balances out the bitterness. Some people seems to have a problem with this, can someone tell me where in the rule book it says a DIPA cannot be sweet? Malt becomes more apparent with age though fresh it is sure hard to find.  Medium bodied brew, for as big and sweet as Hopslam is there is not hint of a syrupy characteristic anywhere. Smooth and nearly creamy texture. Finish is slightly oily on the tongue.  Drinkability is ridiculous. A beer this big should not go down this easy. Alcohol is masked completely in the flavor. Does not get overly sweet or bitter, exceptional balance. One could easily drink more or at least faster than intended. Call me a homer but this is one of the best DIPA's made.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",Imperial IPA,98
287,17112,Lupe,4.59,"Acquired from monkeyknife in 80's BIF. Big thanks!!  Pours a slightly hazed bright amber color with a small off-white head. Head slowly dissipates to a thin sheet and leaves spotty lacing.  Very aromatic with loads of citrus, giving it a crisp and acidic characteristic. Lots of raw honey and floral perfume. Just an intoxicating aroma.  The flavor of this beer definitely sneaks up on you, starting light with sweet honey and caramel. Citrus starts building up with grapefruit before the hops are full unleashed. Alcohol makes it's presence known, pepper and grassy hops join the party, and the citrus hops become biting. Smooths out in the finish with honey sweetness returning to mingle with lingering hop bitterness.  Surprisingly soft on the tongue. Medium-full in body with a chewy and slick mouthfeel.  Great drinkability with a flavor that begs you to drink more. Just delicious and at 10% you better watch out before this really slams you. After finishing a bottle I really wanted another.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",Imperial IPA,98

Appearance - cloudy orange (Chill haze?), very little off-white head, but my pour may be the culprit.  Smell - Citrus, very crisp and acidic. Green and grapefruit.  Taste - Distinctive citrus hop taste. Cascades in this one? Words escape me when I encounter a beer of this caliber...then again maybe I'm seduced by the hops.  Mouthfeel - slight burn, but not overly dry or alcoholic. Thick but not unpleasant lingering.  Drinkability - Pleasantly bitter. This is one of my favorite styles, so perhaps I'm biased. I could drink this for weeks, and no, I'm not at all disparaged by the alcohol content.

The aroma isn't extremely fragrant, but it's quite nice. Sweet citrus, pine needles, honey, and a little bit of hay. The flavor is almost perplexing, with a powerful bitterness on the front of the tongue that disappears from the finish, with some oak, orange pith, and slightly medicinal alcohol dryness. Malt presence is negligible, but not insufficient to back the hops, and the body is thin enough to keep the beer as refreshing as a regular IPA.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",Imperial IPA,98
287,17112,katan,3.97,"undated 12 oz bottle, id 8285  A - Pours a light golden brown color with little haze. Carbonation is obviously present, but the head retention is very small. Maybe a mm which dissipated to a film.  S - Strong floral notes are quite apparent here. The obvious high hopping rate of noble hops is resulting in a citrus/grapefruit nose. Appealing and fits the style.  T - Starts with a grassy hard hop bite that transitions to a balance of sweet malt backbone, bitterness, and citrus hop flavors. Finishes with the hop slam as the name would lead you to think. The after taste is persistent and sweet.  M - A difficult mouthfeel to describe. It seems to be light and watery at times, while some tacky clinging in the aftertaste.  D - The fact that while this is a nice hoppy beer, but not a hop bomb, has me believing that it wouldn't be difficult to knock one back. The high ABV is a counter balance to this however.

Poured a dark amber-golden with medium clarity and medium to heavy carbonation with a slight white head. The hops are apparent at quite a distance, and once you actually put your nose in it, you've reached the motherland. On the tip of the tongue, the bitter hops are already being absorbed, and upon swallowing, the piney flavor melds with the monster hops to the most pleasurable blend imaginable. It's medium to heavy bodied and a true hop-SLAM, yet goes down smooth and remains extremely drinkable. This seasonal is one to definitely one to stock up on to enjoy sparingly at special moments throughout the year!

Poured rather aggresively, but only a 1 cm head that pulls back to a thin lace. Only an island of foam from the duvel etching.  Smells great! Citrus hops abound in this brew; lemony and orange type citrus. Sweet malts and fusel alcohol in the nose as well. Expecting to be slammed by hops - but not quite. Initial taste has a very smooth hop profile which gets stronger going down. Not quite as bitter as I expected, but still really good! The balance is phenomenal as the malts are equally represented. Sweet candy and caramel. Mouthfeel is quite thick and wet. Alcohol is hdden well in the taste but not in the nose.  Seems like the hops may be lower than what I expected, but I think this may be the result of a superbly balanced DIPA, one of the best I ever had.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",Imperial IPA,98
287,17112,johannasclimacus,4.4,"What a tasty and interesting brew! The appearance and smell both hint at a pretty typical, very hoppy IPA. The first taste that I got was citrus hops, but it wasn't as overpowering as I was anticipating. Then the complexity of the honey plus some kind of fruity taste set in, and finally the beer finished with a taste of bitterness. The finish is very smooth and clean as well.  If it were not for the high ABV, I could drink these all night. The beer didn't sit very heavily at all, and overall I would just say that this was an incredibly satisfying experience. One bottle is plenty enough, offering a complexity of flavors, a smooth medium body, and a brief head trip from the ABV to boot!

S: Intense amount of citrus hops along with a light malt backbone that does not combat the hops too well  T: Absolutely phenomenal. Very crisp...the first taste that hits you is the citrus hops. They are abundant, but by no means strong, nor too bitter for a DIPA. In fact, this is leaning more towards the Strong Ale category rather than a DIPA.

Dispite the hoppy assault on the senses, there is very little lingering bitterness that often overwhelms with other DIPAs.

This beer pours a wonderful golden honey color with a bit of chill haze. The head is ample enough to expell quite an impressive aroma of citrus-thick hops as notes of honey try their best to poke through. Head is nearly two fingers high and produces some nice lacing around the top of the glass.  The taste and mouthfeel is pretty darn exceptional. It seems the honey has added a nice bit of complexity to this one which mixes amazingly well with the massive hop dominance. Hops tend to lean towards the citrusy side of things and are brutal and unrelenting throughout the duration of the sip and aftertaste.  I would never have guessed that this one clocked in at 10% and for that this one gets major drinkability points, as I could drink this like any standard IPA.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",Imperial IPA,98
287,17112,GilGarp,4.65,Received in a generous trade from rnorgart. Thanks! I've been looking forward to it.  Batch #8285  Pours a hazy copper orange color with not much head but good lacing.  Aroma is sweet and hoppy with a definate presence of alcohol.  Flavor is obviously very bitter and very imperial IPA but the experience is unusual in that it goes from sweet to bitter and back to sweet with each small sip. I get the honey up front before the hops kick in and then it finishes malty. I figure this would be quite different if it was fresher. The hop character has probably gotten a bit muted but it's still a slam.  Mouthfeel is to be expected from an IIPA and it's drinkability is very good.  Overall its a great beer and one I look forward to trying at its peak when it's released in mid-winter.  Update:  Now enjoying a much fresher Hopslam a mere 6 weeks after bottling instead of 8 months. Thanks to jdoncbus for the awesome trade!  Batch #8907  Pours into a snifter glass with a hazy orange color and just a little bit of white head on top.  So appearance is about the same but the aroma is much improved. Lots more hops with a definate sweet fruity character and honey.  Flavor is also much more pronounced but still pretty balanced. The huge bitterness from the hops is equalled by what must have been impressive amounts of malt and honey. Lots of nice citrus fruits.  Mouthfeel is full bodied and smooth but the bitterness and alcohol keep it from getting a better score. Very enjoyable but nice and slowly is the way to go.  Overall much improved with nearly 7 fewer months on it than last time. Certainly a classic and worthy of such distinction.  Batch 10100 (bottled 1/5/11 and enjoying it 2/2/11)  Thanks to mn6 for the Hopslam.  Very fresh and very citrusy - I get the grapefruit more than I remember in the past. It's big in the nose and even more epic in the flavor. Such a massive hop hit but yet enough sweetness to not feel overpowered.

The taste....delicious. Just like the nose, it's an all out full court citrus hop press. The maltiness & sweetness from the honey is just enough to make it not taste like like hop juice.

Deep tropical fruits aroma's, red fruits, strawberies, watermelon, blood oranges with a mellow, spicey edge. There is an obvious heat tingle along with a semi-bitter, sweet tart candy scent way down. A very bold and complex aroma.**yep sweet fruits and malts pop right out.  My first impression: Huge depth and perfect balance. The malt and hop balance is amazing, a current of raw honey and caramel makes the malt heady and smooth, not buttery, but sweet. The hops kick in high gear with huge complexity as a tropical fruit storm rock's the tastebud's. Think: Blood oranges, pineapple and strawberries with an earthy, herbal, hit right at the end. The heat is warming but does not creat an overwhelming bitter hop/heat attack. The flavor's are bold and not bitter overall.  This is a full, heady feeling DIPA with an amamzing crisp bite and very smooth finish.**Crispy bite, herbal snap and super smooth, full bodied pull mouthfeel for sure.  A beautiful brew with massive complexity and a massive malt backbone to support the sweet, fruity hops.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",Imperial IPA,98
287,17112,DrunkenMaster,3.55,"Bottle at Coles. Hazy orange with a big grapefruit and pine aroma with some sweet pineapple. Not as hoppy as I expected. As it warms up it starts to get a bit hot and boozy towards the end. Meh, a decent example but there are much better DIPAs out there.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",Imperial IPA,98
287,17112,corey0212,4.21,"Thanks to moose3285 for including this as an extra in a trade!!  Pours a beautiful honey/orange color, it's nearly glowing in the glass, off-white head fades pretty fast, but leaves a good amount of lacing on the glass. Very sweet nose on this, lots of caramel aroma, plenty of citrus hop notes as well. This is just a fantastically balanced Imperial IPA...with a name like HopSlam, I was thinking ""wildly unbalanced"", which I'm generally fine with, love the hop bombs. But the balance between the sweet malts and the bitter/citric/floral hops is pretty much perfect. Slight chewiness on the tongue, subdued but lasting bitterness. I like that this is in a 12oz. bottle, keeps things from getting out of hand (with the high ABV). An excellent Imperial IPA!",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",Imperial IPA,98
287,17112,chemmie,4.48,"Special thanks to PaulTheBeerGuru for putting this on tap at Underground Bluz in Orlando.  It poured a beautiful golden honey color. If this was in a mason jar, you'd think it was some high-end bee nectar. Holding it to the light, you'd think the gods were shining down on this beer. It's pretty.  The smell is of nice, sweet, hops. Just a little bit of bitter hop smell mixed in with the sweet and citrus aromas. My nose is blessed.  The taste is amazing. The Bell's guys knew exactly what they were doing and balanced this thing perfectly. The super-hoppiness is there, but the bitter kick in the balls isn't. Instead, you're greeted with a delicate sweetness that just rolls right past the tongue and leaves a big smile on your face. The beer is smooth, light, flavorful, hoppy and refreshing, without being too much of anything. For hoppy beers, I would consider this one of the most well-balanced out there.  This is now one of my favorite beers. The drinkability is insane. All of the good things about a super-hoppy beer, but with the ability to drink it all night long. That's a good beer, my friends.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",Imperial IPA,98
287,17112,Jwale73,4.2,"Sampled this at the Eccentric back in May after partaking of several other offerings from Bell's; however, I'm thankful for the opportunity to try this as a standalone. Received this as a generous extra from bgramer (thanks Brendan). Batch 8277 printed on the bottle. Served in my Delirium Tremens tulip. Poured a hazy orange-gold with a one-inch loose head. Cap reduced to half its size within seconds before settling into a thin skim of foam and ringlets. Some strands of watery lacing adhered to the walls of the glass during the tasting. Scent off the cap pop was sweet; however, aromas in the glass yielded a predominantly floral hops nose, with a mead-like quality detectable in the background. Taste consistent with nose, with a very complex flavor profile; both sweet and bitter at the same time. Medium-bodied mouthfeel with a slightly viscous feeling and a light effervescence in the mouth. I'm generally not one for IPAs, but Hopslam is in a category all its own in my opinion.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",Imperial IPA,98

287,17112,Gtreid,4.72,"Reveiwed on 4-21-08  OH BABY! This beer is a monster! Appearance is almost the same color as a new penny. Poured one finger of head that wilted down to about an eighth of an inch and lasted the entire glass. Amazing retention. Smelled of thick orange and citrus hops, slight pine scent as well. Taste was out of this world, and finished with a sweet honey flavor. Smooth medium bodied beer, that just screams DRINK ME! At 10% ABV, I could not beleive how drinkable this beer was. If I had access to this beer year round, I would never be without one. This is a must try for all you hopheads. Cheers.  Re-review:  Ok, in honor of my 50th review, I am going to review HopSlam again. This has about 5 months age on it. Poured into a snifter.  A: Honey, copper color, that when poured straight down the center of the glass, produced one and a half fingers of sandy white head. When the head fades it leaves behind thick, very sticky lacing.  A: Citrus hops explode. Orange, grapefruit, mango, and tangerine. Sweet malts are hidden but present enough give it some balance.  T: Honey and citrus. Much like the nose. This is almost like drinking orange juice with alcohol. The hops are increadible. HopSlam finishes slightly dry with a very apperant alcohol heat.  M&D: Medium body, and the smoothest beer I ever had the pleasure of sipping. At 10% ABV this drinks just as well as any single IPA out there. With a little age, the hops are a somewhat more subdued than when fresh, but I think this is even better than a new bottle. I am a hophead, and this is exactlly what I want to be drinking. Supurb!

T: Nothing I can say to really encompass the taste, if I could use one word, it would be in-fucking-credible. this is what IPAs strive to be. incredibly balanced and crisp.

Two bottles from the same batch(8283), from two beautiful & generous traders. One man(artisanbrew), one woman(Dryzga), helping me test the limits of my gluttony... time to doublefist some HopSlam!  Alright, I'll allow a little civility; two tulips. The least I can do. :P  The bottles pour out an orange amber, just slightly murky, just a little irritated by all the commotion. Close to an inch of head across the board, with an uneven layer of pond scum left behind once they settle.  Greasy & yeasty, rich alcoholic fumes, cracker-ish, with of course... the rindy/green/dirty hops. A tingly note of pepper skims off the top as well.  The hops seem to be backloaded, as all the malt & sugar suckerpunches me first. ...& wah?, where did all the alcohol go? Oooh, I feel it in my esophagus... but not on my tongue(so much). A sharp crackermeal-ish, syrup sweetness like I said comes first. Then it gets pretty peppery in the middle. It quits toying around, & in the endgame, it just clamps down on your tongue with a weighted belt stuffed with grapefruit rind, arugula, & a seriously strong pinch of salt I didn't see coming.  I came in expecting something along the lines of Double Simcoe, but the texture is totally different. Very slippery, but very well carbonated. The alcohol doesn't come into play till it's halfway down, which was amazing. Body is no where as thick as Double Simcoe. Probably the only thing they have in common now is price. :P  Tasty. Who's still hoarding some? :)",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",Imperial IPA,98
287,17112,BrewerB,4.16,"Intense, knock you over the head hoppiness. Loaded with fruity hops - pineapple, candied orange, grapefruits. Clean fermentation and malt character.  Decent-sized white head, retains well. Lacing appears when swirled in the glass. Orange/yellow in color, clear.  Lots of pineapple-like hop flavor. Bitterness is strong but not overwhelming. The bitterness carries through into the dry finish. Some toasty malt character is noted but its mild and in the background. Excellent balance. Could benefit from a wee bit more complexity in the hop flavor.  Smooth, medium bodied. Not astringent. Expected a little more carbonation.  Overall it's a very smooth double IPA loaded with fruity (mostly pineapple) hop flavor. A great balancing act considering its strength, this one is suprisingly easy to drink. A bump in carbonation and more complexity in hop flavors would kick this into overdrive.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",Imperial IPA,98
287,17112,Biggness,4.44,"My wife brought me a 6 pack of this beer. I was definately looking forward to trying this beer. It pours amber with a slight white head. The smell of this beer is astounding... definately the best smelling beer I have smelled to date. You can smell citrus, hops and malt in a beautiful harmony. The flavor is wonderful for a dipa, borderline grapefruit juice :) the 9.3% alcohol is well hidden but it seems a little overcarbonated imo. Not something I could drink all night but certainly a great beer.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",Imperial IPA,98
287,17112,boralyl,4.54,"A - It pours one fingers worth of off white head. The beer is a clear orange copper color. There is a moderate amount of lacing as well.  S - Smells of honey followed by citrusy hops and some earthly hops at the end. A very inviting aroma. One of the best aromas i've smelled in awhile.  M - Smooth and wet, feels slightly thick.  T - This is a hops head's dream beer. The taste is full of hops, there is a grapefruit/citrus first followed with some sweet malts mixed in for balance. Then the earthy hops dominate the after taste leaving a nice bitter flavor. It leaves some alcohol heat after it goes down.  Very good. I'm a huge hops fan, and this one doesn't dissapoint at all. Could probably only have a few of these because of the high alcohol content. My only regret is that I didn't get a case, now I'm going to have to wait until next year.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",Imperial IPA,98

S: Intensely floral hop aromas, some citrus, not as much pine as other DIPAs. Sweet, caramel malt.  T: This beer is not as much as a hopbomb as I expected, but it packs quite a wallop. It is extremely well balanced between the various hop flavors and bitterness and the sweet caramel like malt that backs up the hops. There are very complex and distinguishable layers of hop aroma, bitterness, and malt that make this beer very enjoyable to sit and sip. Lots of grapefruit and citrus flavors, with some alcohol heat at the end.  M: Smooth and syrupy, but with decent carbonation to intensify the nose. Not as viscous as most stouts, but definitely has considerable body and residual sugars.  D: Not very high, but this beer is so darn delicious. It is very thick and hoppy, I wouldn't want more than a few per sitting.  I can definitely understand why this beer is so popular. It is hoppy and has substantial bitterness, but a great malty backbone and residual sweetness to support the hops.

Hopslam is an amazing beer by all accounts regardless of style, yet I will continue from now on with regards to its origin.  Let's disregard the appearance, you have almost +100 reviews that can tell the same story. This beer taste wise is delicious. Enough said. Easy to drink, amazing to enjoy, you get the hoppy of an IPA and the mellow of honey in the same sip.

287,17112,philberinghele,4.8,"Easily my favorite Double IPA. This is a highly complex beer that is well served by the addition of honey.  It pours an deep orange color with a floral aroma coming out of the thick head. The taste is all citrus, grass, and herbal hops. The honey is barely perceptible but definitely rounds out the taste.  I would give this a perfect score but its drinkability is limited by its high abv and me having to travel out of illinois to get it.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",Imperial IPA,98

Smell is out of this world citrus. I could smell this all day. I wonder if they make a cologne?  Taste is off the charts. Lots of citrus and hops. Not as bitter as you might think.  Mouthfeel is nice. Sticks to your tongue and mouth. You won't forget what you're drinking.  Drinkability is outstanding, which is dangerous for this high of an abv. Be careful with these.

Lots of sticky webbing and good head retention.  Smells like I just split a grapefruit in half, with notes of lemon zest and orange peel! There's a hint of sweet caramel and cookie dough as well.  Taste is a perfect balance between the malts and hops. A grapefruit bitter hop bite is balanced nicely with some sweet caramel malt. Some citrus sweetness leads into some creamy, doughy malts before a very long dry hop finish.  Mouthfeel is on the fuller side of medium. It starts out creamy but finishes crisp and dry.

T: Initially I really tasted the honey, but after it breathed it was only slightly noticeable in the aftertaste. I don't think there's quite as much hop flavour as their two hearted. Pine, grass, nectarine, appricot, toffee & honey. Assertive bitterness is smooth. Alcohol has a little warmth, but I wouldn't guess it was that high  M: Really well-attenuated moderate body is smooth with a little hop acidity.

Holding it up to the light, yellowish highlights with that deep hue in the middle of golden honey. Like a bee's wet dream.  Smells like the hops section at the homebrew store, a little sweetness and alcohol thrown in.  Tangy hops, not so much sweet as it is bitter. I guess I was expecting more sweetness, the bittering works just fine though. Lemony citrusy grapefruits come out halfway down the pint.  Resiny aftertaste that acts better than Paris Hilton in House of Wax. Some sweetness on the tongue. But mostly resiny hops, with more hops. The alcohol creeps in almost immediately, warms you up.

Thanks Brawley for hooking it up by the way!  appearance: pale in color with some hints of a strawberry or peach hue.  Aroma: Lots of fruit and juicy hop goodness, resiny and just sweet smelling. mystery fruit almost but certain hints of fresh berry and maybe some peach and mango. The honey is there along with the fruit as well which adds to the complex sweet aroma.  Taste: There is a quick sweetness that is immediately dominated by rich hop bitterness that is throughout the flavor and stings the tounge. complex and rich this is a kick ass beer and the alcohol is there but not overpowering or overwhelming as some high ABV beers can be. I believe this beer would be more bitter and less fruity if it were fresher but it is definitely still enjoyable if in a different way.  Overall: THis is one kickass beer and I do love my hops. Bottled in the fall and drank almost in June so that character has diminished but this beer is still awesome just different.

287,17112,errantnight,4.15,"Thanks abankovich!  This beer reminded me of my Anderson Valley 20th Drinking experience in that it started off with a bang but ended up with a little bit of a whimper. Different in that the bang was bigger and brighter and better, but also the whimper was more whiny at the end. Still... I'm dying to get more of this, as freshy mcfresh as I can.  Pours a cloudy, hazy orange-tinged golden hue with two frothy fingers of head that drift away into a nicely laced, thinly filmed brew. Love that hoppy oil haze.  Aroma is a bursting hop explosion of goodness. Not the most pungent, but no strain needed to pick up layers of aroma. Blooming flowers and honey and fresh grapefruit, some sold tangerine notes, a bit of a lemony finish. Great. There's definitely malt sweetness around the edges. This may be fading.  Taste is right out of the West Coast DIPA playbook... a juicy fruity ball of citrusy, floral sweetness backed by an extremely clean pale malt middle with only mild hints of bread or toast into a clean, dry finish that lets a hoppy bitterness linger expectantly.  Not sure just how old this is, but it tasted like it had lost a step from its heyday. The hop flavors which arrive in a burst start to drift off, and as it warms, when it should really be coming into its own, it starts to develop that post-DIPA flavor which starts to remind one of an American Barleywine without the deep malt complexity or roundness.  All of which would be find if it weren't for the hot alcohol that comes through in the final third. A note is certainly acceptable, but the final few drinks find it to be a bit obnoxious. If I had started this beer out warmer I'd have been pretty disappointed.  I'm certainly open to revising this upward, but for top-of-its-class DIPA it had a couple small marks against it. This is, really, faint criticism. I loved the beer, look forward to trying more, and can't wait to do so. That said, there's a perfectness about its little brother, Two Hearted Ale, which this fails to duplicate, and perhaps I'm overharsh by the steep comparison.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",Imperial IPA,98

Appearance - Pours a cloudy yellow gold. Not much of a head, just a thin layer of whiteness on the top to give it some character.  Smell - Big time in the nose. Citrus and more citrus! First thing that hit me was a melon smell with some grapefruit kicking in. Almost sensed some passion fruit too. Very much a spicy hopiness as well. Best nose on a beer that I can remember.  Taste & Mouthfeel - Same as the nose. A wonderful rush of sweet melon and citrusy hops. A spicy bitterness is present in the back. A crisp bite of warming alcohol comes through by the end too. Wonderfully crisp and smooth, but not overly harsh.  Drinkability - Loved the Oskar Blues Gordon. This baby just kicked it off its perch. One of the few beers that comes along and takes your breath away. Simply a marvelous creation.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",Imperial IPA,98
287,17112,Beaver13,4.88,"12 oz bottle, batch 8277 (1/9/08). Pours a hazy dark gold with a huge pillowy white head that retains well and laces the glass. There's tons of big yeasties in the bottom.  The aroma is piney citrusy spicy peppery hops! Yum! It is a little subdued.  The flavor is sweet, slightly sugary, caramel malts, melon and grapefruits with a nice big fruity, peppery hop bite in the finish. It's a little on the sweet side but this bottle is not quite so fresh. I've had it fresher with a bigger hop presence. The hop bitterness comes out more as it warms. The alcohol is very well hidden. The mouthfeel is medium to full with nice velvety carbonation.  Overall, this is fantastic! It's very well balanced and is so yummy it's almost seems sessionable. I wish I could get this regularly! This is right at the top of my list.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",Imperial IPA,98
287,17112,rudylaw,4.42,"Grapefruit, grapefruit, grapefruit!  OK, so if you like grapefruit, orange, honey and citrus in general, you'll wet yourself over this beer. This goes toe to toe with Alpha King.  The drinkability is amazing. Not too thick, not too light... right on the money. There is absolutely a chance of me polishing off six of these on a hot day.  Damn shame this isn't available all year round. Special thanks to my new friends met at DLD for the two bottles thrown my way. Bell's never disappoints and this is no exception.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",Imperial IPA,98
287,17112,a10t2,4.72,"A: Bright golden orange, with a slight chill haze that's nice to see. Like Bell's says, ""Live life unfiltered."" Thin stand of white head and a beautiful unbroken white lace remain all the way down the glass.  S: A big whiff of citrus, specifically grapefruit, from what I can only assume are Simcoe hops. Maybe a little spicy/earthy hop aroma underneath but the grapefruit is amazingly powerful.  T: Like a big glass of grapefruit juice, but in a good way. The hops are again overpowering, but the bitterness doesn't seem out of balance, so the malt must just be hiding. Some other fruit flavors (peach, mango?) come out in the aftertaste, finally followed by just a little lingering alcohol warmth.  M: Not as heavily carbonated as the Two-Hearted IPA, which is nice in the style, but still light enough to go down easily. Even at 10% ABV the alcohol doesn't detract from the experience.  D: Far too drinkable, this is a hophead's dream come true.  Note: 2008 release (batch 8278 - 9 Jan 2008), which from what I can remember is definitely different from the 2007. 10% ABV for 2008.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",Imperial IPA,98
287,17112,kenito799,3.82,"12 oz bottle poured into a pint glass. Thanks to tizzod, midwest beer guide!  Medium amber brew, a tan head is raised and fair amount of sticky lace is left.  The aroma is a wallop of piney grapefruity hoppy deliciousness...immediately I smell Two Hearted Ale, one of my favorite brews. The flavor definitely delivers full-on hoppiness, no doubt. The flavors are excellent, bitter, floral, citrus, bitter finish, no complaints there. There is honey in this beer, and that sweetness is apparent, attempting to balance the ramped-up alcohol. The resulting mouthfeel is a bit slick and oily, which IMO detracts from the intense deliciousness of the hops. Again I am left not understanding the need for DIPAs. For me, Two Hearted delivers the same mouth puckeringly delicious hop flavors and aromas in a much more drinkable beer. No doubt as DIPAs go, this is a great one, and I am unlikely to turn one of these down if offered, but I'll take a near perfect IPA over a DIPA any day.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",Imperial IPA,98
287,17112,jamie2dope,4.07,"Bell's Hopslam, I saved this beer for the end of the night so as to savor my taste buds for the hop slamming they are about to receive. Pours a somewhat hazy orange, with not too much heading, but a good enough white lacing. Smell is everything that you would want from a good Imperial IPA: resiny hops, citrus fruits, earthy hops...its got it all. I have to say that taste wasn't quite as good. The citrus notes came through well, with lots of pineapple, mango and orange along withe the hops, but I don't know, it felt as if something essential was missing....perhaps a bit more malt balance? Mouthfeel is viscous and sweet, yet bitter. One is more than enough for me in one night, but still, I am glad I had the chance to try this brew from Bell's. Maybe not the best DIPA I have had, but certainly ranks among the better ones I have tasted recently. Cheers",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",Imperial IPA,98
287,17112,beavers,4.8,"Pours a magnificent burnt copper with a thin but creamy white covering. Beautiful lacing. Rich nose of fresh, grassy, juicy citrusy hops on top of a subtly sweet and spicy malt backbone. Hops have faded just barely over the last couple months as the bitterness has died down a little and the sweet and spicy maltiness is playing a larger role in the finish. Medium to full bodied, and the carbonation is on point for what I look for in IIPAs. If you told me this beer was 10% I would have laughed at you. I am loving this beer a few months old just as much as I did fresh. This balance is perfect for me, and the drinkability is absurd.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",Imperial IPA,98
287,17112,Gavage,4.47,"Appearance: dark orange in color with a 1"" head. Mild lacing develops during the session.  Smell: huge bitterness and citrus tones leap from the glass into the nose.  Taste: nice malt base with a huge bitterness blanket wrapped around it. Grapefruits and oranges are throughout, oh and did I mention some strong bitterness ? Some alcohol tones are well hidden but warming. Despite the big IBUs for this beer it is well balanced.  Mouthfeel: medium-heavy in body. Lightly crisp at the start and smoother and dry towards th finish. Super long aftertaste as the bitterness lingers in the mouth forever after swallowing.  Drinkability: well balanced and very drinkable. No means is this a session beer, but you can easily enjoy more than one. Definite hophead beer.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",Imperial IPA,98
287,17112,crookedhalo,3.67,"Pours up a nice orangy amber color with a short-lived off-white head. Some lacing left behind, but not really noteworthy. Some very nice piney and grapefruit rind aromas going on, a slight dose of spicy V-8 type veggie showing up as well. Hard to discern any malt or alcohol characteristics even though I'm sure they're going on in there. Nice balance between maltiness and hoppiness, but I'm sensing the same veggie V-8 type of flavor remotely in the aftertaste. I must say that this ale hides it's 10% ABV pretty well with an assortment of flavors. Some pale maltiness, short crystal malt, hoppy profile, some residual sugars in the aftertaste. Pretty solid, but I think I've had better. Very astringent and hoppy, yet somewhat lacking.  Not sure if I'd sampled an outdated bottle. Dot-matrix coded 8277 on the reverse label.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",Imperial IPA,98
287,17112,turbine2475,4.27,"A - Pours a nice copper with a dense two finger head that disipated slowly leaving a good lacing. S - Earthy hops with a touch of sweet citrus and a third hint that I'm at a loss to name. None the less very plesant. T - Nice hop bomb, sweet citrus and earthy hops fought agianst each other as they traveled across the tounge. Sweetened honey and syrup brought forward a nice balance in such a hop infused brew. M - Milky mouthfeel coming from the saturation of hops and a higher then normal carbonation. D - Awesome brew that I could drink several of, but the 10% ABV makes it hard to have too many.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",Imperial IPA,98
287,17112,shivtim,4.3,"Pours out a hazy golden color with red hints and a thin, dense white head. Nose is west coast floral hops, with dense syrupy honey. Taste is surprisingly malty, then the hops kick in and linger over dark honeycomb and bitter citrus. Slight alcohol on the end balances and mingles with the lingering hops. Mouthfeel is foamy and smooth. Good drinkability except for the ABV.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",Imperial IPA,98
287,17112,rtratzlaff,4.82,"Pours a orangy amber with a decent 1/2 inch head that settles and sticks some lacing to the glass.  Almost as soon as its cracked, the citrus smells are evident. Grapefruit and orange dominate. Some honey suckle in the aroma as well.  Taste is dominated by wonderful candied citrus fruit and pineapple flavors. A great tasting DIPA. Hop resins stick rather well to the tongue.  Mouthfeel is not thick, but right on.  This beer allows one to truly drink up some great hop flavor. I like the addition of the honey as well since it dries it out and isn't overly sticky sweet.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",Imperial IPA,98
287,17112,Med,4.49,"A - Pours a nice yellowish copper color with a light white head that unfortunately doesn't stick around. Lacing is fair.  S - Floral hops mingle with honey and caramel. Alcohol is present but well hidden. This is a wonderful aroma!  T - Incredibly well balanced between the citrusy hops, sweet honey, and caramel malts. My girlfriend isn't big on hops but tried to steal my glass. It's that good.  M - Medium bodied with slight carbonation. I'd like a few more bubbles here. The coating is decent though.  D - I need to buy a case of this. Tomorrow.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",Imperial IPA,98
287,17112,stlbeerguy,4.82,This beer has a great initial palate with tremendous fruitiness and gobbs of weight which is reflected in its dark yellow color. You taste the hops but do not experience any bitterness . What separates this beer from the others in this class is the finish. It is unique and very sweet almost like a very expensive dessert wine from France(Sauternes). What a luxury drink!!!!

That should hold me over for a while.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",Imperial IPA,98
287,17112,CaptainIPA,4.12,"Presented in a 12 oz., brown bottle with freshness code: 8285. Label illustration depicts dude flat on back after being slammed by giant hop mass. Nice visual metaphor.  Pours a light copper with a thin, creamy, egg-shell colored head. Minimal carbonation. Moderate lacing.  Initial nose of pineapple and lots of it, followed by notes of spruce, honey and cinnamon bread.  Starts off sweet - citrus, honey and brown sugar, moves on to a well-balanced amalgam of piney hops and malt. As it warms, Hopslam becomes bitter, yet never biting. Finishes dry and, at 10% Alc., somewhat hot.  Sticky, chewy mouthfeel. Very hard to believe this clocks in at 106 IBUs. Extremely drinkable for such a high ABV. Not all that sessionable, but worthy of slamming two.  Three Floyd's take note. This is what Dreadnaught should aspire to be.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",Imperial IPA,98
287,17112,markaberrant,4.42,"A - orange, not quite clear. Big off-white head. Leaves lots of sticky lace down the glass.  S - huge blast of sweet mango, very tropical  T - powerful mix of hop flavour, bitterness, maltiness, and alcohol. More mango goodness, but also lots of grapefruit. Aftertaste is incredible, hop flavour lingers forever.  M - somewhat sticky, but by the time you swallow, the bitterness and drying alcohol have more than cleansed your palette. Overall body is med-light. Alcohol is smooth, but it's tough to mask 10%, so it's pretty warm.  D - flavours and aromas are oustanding, and incredibly easy to drink  The few Bell's beers I have managed to sample have all been absolutely top notch, and this is no exception.

Smells of grapefruit, pine, honey, biscuit, grass, grapes, and oranges. Tastes of grass mixed with sweet honey with a light biscuit backbone and a finish of grapefruit, orange peel, and a juniper tasting dryness, definitely a slam of hops. Medium in body with good carbonation and semi-syrupy but still smooth and sweet with a sticky dry bitter finish. Very easy to drink and extremely pleasant for a hop lover with an appropriate name. A little high in ABV to session, but it'd be well worth dealing with the aftermath the next day.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",Imperial IPA,98

Aroma of sweet citrus hops, with a little resin and sweet malt underneath. A little tropical fruit too. Very nice smell. Taste hits you with bitter, resiny, hops at first, then a little citrus and bready malts. This beer has a medium body and is lively in the mouth.

287,17112,ndekke39,4.35,"Drank this from a 12 oz. bottle from batch 8277, bottled on January 9, 2008. Decanted into a pint glass.  Pours a clear honey yellow with a thick white head. Great retention - fair amount of lacing on the glass.  Bready and honey smell up front. Some leafy and citrus-y hints following. Overall, it reminds me of mead, which makes sense given the ""ale brewed with honey"" on the label.  Taste is really quite dynamic for something that's marketed as a being some tricked-out hop experience. This really doesn't compare to other DIPA's I've tried. But this isn't bad - the honey really balances the flavors. There's some pretty heavy hop flavors, but the bread, yeast, and honey makes the taste travel well.  Mouthfeel is heavier than expected. Feels like a mead. I like it.  I was really surprised by this beer. I expected just another over-hopped double IPA, but got something pretty dynamic instead. One of the best Bell's offerings I've tasted. I will definitely keep coming back to this one.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",Imperial IPA,98
287,17112,gunhaver,4.45,"Bottle. Batch 8277. Pours a sparkling murky cloudy pinkish amber. Lots of head, and a crazy amount of lacing. Aroma is spectacular; grapefruits and citrus out the ass. Hoppy as hell, incredibly vacuous and worthy of its own praise. Crazy good. Flavor is delectable: spicy hops and pleasant citrus interwoven with honey and ginger. Thick and syrupy, but with a nice watery and easy finish. Way too drinkable at 10%, but I feel overall it's not as striking of an IPA as Bells own Two Hearted Ale.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",Imperial IPA,98

Aroma is sweet, dank, citrusy, guave like with hints of acetone.  Taste is slightlty bitter, some notes of solvent. Nothing amazingly overpowering as I might have expected with this beer. I get some hints of honey, and residula sweetness. Finishes fairly dry.  Mouthfeel- Light to medium bodied. I gues the sugar and honey make this one of them IIPA's of the non-chewy variety.  Drinkability- Amazingly drinkable for a 10% beer. I could easily polish a coiuple of these off. It certainly is a sneaky beer, doesn't taste like the abv reports. Carefull with this one.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",Imperial IPA,98
287,17112,MiguelMandingo,4.52,"Got this as a gift from thickerfreakness. Thanks Charles! I appreciate it.  Poured a 12oz. bottle into a snifter.  Appearance - It pours a hazy transparent copper orange. It produced a 1/2 finger head that quickly dissipated to a thin spotty crown. A swirl of the snifter brought the head right back. It had much better head retention after the glass was swirled. It left behind a minimal bit of lacing.  Smell - Man this smells pretty damn good. It smells very sweet, with notes of heavy caramel mixed with honey. No DIPA would be complete without a heavy does of hops, and this beer is no exception. The hop notes bring about lots of fruit scents - orange, pineapple, a slight hint of grapefruit, and tangerine. It also has a nice bitter pine scent as well.  Taste - What a tasty beer. The beer opens with the flavors of grapefruit and pine which then meld with the honey and caramel component in the middle. The end of the flavor is awesome. Orange and tangerine citrus finish the flavor with the pine making a small appearance but then makes it presence felt in a lingering bitter aftertaste. Yummy.  Mouthfeel - It is medium bodied. It is very smooth and creamy. The carbonation level is fairly moderate. I would have liked a little more carbonation to keep the beer feeling lively.  Drinkability - This beer is awesome. I thought Bell's did an awesome job with Two Hearted, and they did an equally impressive job with this one. It is very easy drinking, and at 9.3% ABV it is also pretty dangerous - the ABV is hidden extremely well.  Thanks again Charles - I am cracking open my Dreadnaught next!",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",Imperial IPA,98
287,17112,0110x011,4.58,"Pours a cloudy coppery-orange with a full 3-finger head that just won't quit. Sticky lacing everywhere. I can smell the hops without even sticking my nose in the glass. Smell is heavenly. A veritable bouquet of every smell that makes a DIPA good. Grapefruit, tangerine, pine, grass, flowers, you name it its in here somewhere. I could keep my face in this glass for hours! The flavor is more on the earthy side of the hop spectrum, with a bit of tangerine & caramel showing through. The expected hoppy-bitter finish was more of a kick in the face than I was hoping for, which throws the balance for me, but nevertheless, this is one of the best examples of a DIPA that i've found. Mouthfeel is full-bodied, yet soft and creamy. A pleasure to drink, and a must for any hophead!

These flavors continued into the mouth along with some honey. The palate was dense but didn't come off as heavy leading into a dry, bitter, hoppy finish. Well done and especially enjoyable for people who enjoy the herbal side of hops.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",Imperial IPA,98
287,17112,wolffman17,4.3,"Thanks to wcudwight for this one!  Hopslam is deep gold. Slightly hazy. The head is big, thick, creamy, and sticky. Wonderful looking DIPA.  All hops in the aroma. Very inviting citrus and tropical fruits; mainly orange and pineapple. No denying what this hoppy delight is all about!  On to the taste and feel, no surprises here: this one's a big and crisp brew, intensely hoppy, and surprisingly smooth. Noticable grapefruit. There's a bit of alcohol towards the end and in exhale. Good tart aftertaste. I was looking for a sweeter counter-balance to the hops; nevertheless, this is a fine beer and worthy of high acclaim.  Highly drinkable for such a bomb. No problems there.  No doubt, Hopslam delivers! I'd love to see how it holds up in a blind tasting as one with a sweeter malt profile might win out (for me at least).",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",Imperial IPA,98

The head does stick to the side when the glass is tilted. S- Can you say Hops? Your nose obviously knows what is getting into before you even taste this beer. There is an overwhelming smell of hops with a slight citrus aroma. T- A little bitter up front, but to be expected with the ABV. After the initial hop taste it becomes creamy and smooth. But leaves a dry aftertaste making you want more. M- Very light for the ABV with a fair amount of carbonation. D-WATCH OUT, YOU CAN GET INTO TROUBLE WITH THIS BEER.

The smell is a mix of citrus, but not overwelming like some DIPAs. The taste is one of the most balanced I have ever had, of course it is very hoppy, but so smooth. The transition from one complex flavor to another is seamless, with not one element overpowering another. The alc is so hidden, you could definately get in trouble if you had a few.

287,17112,Foxman,4.7,"It pours a hazy lemony iced tea golden orange. A finger-plus of frothy slightly off-white head settles to bubbly islets. Mountainscapes of lacing scale the inside of the glass.  In the aroma, the malt is sweet and buttressed by honey, and grants caramel, berry, and vanilla. The hops are resplendent with orange, lemon, grapefruit, and resiny pine. The alcohol feels cool on the nose like ether.  Upon tasting, the hops take an assertive lead, swirling mandarin orange, lemon cream, and dusty dry grapefruit. Crisp pine carries on in a sly lubricated fashion as well. Underlying honey sweetness intros a toasted malt caramel note. The hops push again with an evergreen essence that spruces up a snaky warm waft of alcohol, pun intended. Residual grain sweetness bespeaks baked bread and berry jam but a dry lingering bitterness characterizes the finish. It balances like a gymnast, blends like an artist's masterpiece, and outright excels.  Medium bodied, the malt is creamy, and oily slick hops are sticky and smooth all at once.  The hops live up famously to the ""slam"" appellation, but the balance is an impressive accomplishment, as it could easily slide too heavily toward the hops, yet it never does. The top-notch grain bill, both in blend and quality, is an awesome asset as well. The ABV is less an obstacle than a warming plus, and it drinks like a sweet hop-bomb should...that is, it eats just the right amount enamel from your teeth while reminding you of the malt in play. No surprise, everything they say about this one is true, and I'm thrilled, because I still have five more to savor.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",Imperial IPA,98

The taste was again a ""hop slam"" to the face with a nice hint of sweet. Mouthfeel was a bit thick and carbonation was little. Overall a little too hoppy for me but still a great beer!  2nd review for Hopslam 2009:  Appearance: Pours a nice golden amber with an interesting head. It wasn't fluffy but rather rocky or even scaly? Yeah I know but it did look like scales.  Smell: Wonderfully piney aroma with hints of grapefruit and pine.  Taste: Like the nose this one is very hoppy with hints of grass, grapefruit, pine and pepper. Not overly sweet which I expected because of the honey.  Mouthfeel: Medium body with medium carbonation.

287,17112,hopsleeroy,4.35,"Poured orangey/caramel color with good white head that laced the glass for the whole 12 oz. Smelled of fruit hop grapefruit, orange citrus, and some sweet scents. Tasted great. With plenty of hop citrus and astringency and a balanced sweetness that was not bready or biscuity but very balanced. Where is the alcohol? Good feel in the mouth-slightly coating and a good level of carbonation. Very enjoyable beer. I don't tend to enjoy this style because it isn't balanced enough, but this one jas all of the right flavors. Thanks to Tilley4 for this treat.

287,17112,jdubjacket,4.37,"Holy Crap in a pita! A bold beast that is absolutely outstanding! The color was not what I was expecting. A little bit more orange and murky than what I'm used to, but not offsetting in any way. Smells like someone juiced a grapefruit on a pine tree. Taste is pretty dry with a bitter following. Overall, an oustanding beer that really hits the spot.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",Imperial IPA,98
287,17112,gford217,4.53,"Big thanks to sholland119 for sharing this one! 12oz bottle poured into a snifter.  A: Pours a hazy coppery orange with a dense white head that shows exceptional retention for beer of this ABV. The slightest swirl of the glass brings the head back quickly.  S: Floral and citrus hops dominate the aroma. Despite the hop dominance, there is a hint of sweet maltiness underneath.  T: Starts off with a hoppy bitterness with major grapefruit and orange overtones with a slight pine bite. But that gives way to pleasant sweetness before the crisp fruity hop finish takes over. Very nice and extremely well balanced for having such a hop profile.  M: Crisp but sill coats your mouth in a prickly hoppy goodness.  D: I was extremely impressed with the beer. I would definitely put it in the top few DIPAs I've tasted. This would be a staple in fridge if I had easier access to it.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",Imperial IPA,98
287,17112,budgood1,4.92,"pours out a slightly hazed copper colour, with a thin white head that sticks and stays leaving nice rings of lace. stupendous aroma of hops; all citrus all the time...think lemon-lime meets grapefruit punch with an fresh apple kick. a nice maltiness noses it's way in also...wow this smells great! the taste backs up all the lip smacking, juicy fruit hopping that this DIPA is known for. grapefruit rind, lemon zest, orange juice, lime, with an understated honey sweetened herbal tea note that really rounds out the hop profile. it's full of bitterness, but it melds so well into the background, that i almost dismissed the tremendous IBU's. oh yeah, i almost forgot that there is a nice, straightforward, sweet caramel maltiness that holds everything together beautifully. and the honey helps, too, if i already didn't mention that. it's a gorgeous combination. there are some yeasty notes prevalent, mostly due to the bottle conditioning, but i tried not to mix in the dregs. i'll save them until the end. while i can tell this is a big brew full of booze, i can't detect any alcohol related flavours, either. i can only say that this tastes fantastic. big bodied; full, albeit dry mouthfeel. drinks smaller than it should for a %10 ABV beer. finishes dry...thus, drinkability is dangerous. proceed with caution!  wow, what a great DIPA. certainly the best i've had the joy to drink. this particular brew is an absolute crowning achievement in the wide world of hop worship and brewing.  i loved it. so should you.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",Imperial IPA,98

Moving on to the highlights... bam-- what an explosion of citrusy, grapefruit hops in the nose and then again in the taste with bitterness that is very present but not overwhelming. Very light and present in the mouth, making it very enjoyable and present. For the ingredients and the alcohol the drinkability is incredible as well.

287,17112,RumRiverWorthog,4.42,"Well, I can't be as eloquent as others, and I'm new at this gig. Moving CD's to the IPOD while I type this.  Appearance - Orange/Golden hue, clear body, poured from bottle fairly quickly for a nice 1"" head that receded to a white ring over time.  Smell - floral, citrusy notes, like grapefruit  Taste - crisp, tart, with a sting at the back of the throat if you drink it too fast that quickly fades away. nice bitterness, but it's not unpleasant. Leaving the palate dry for awhile, it leaves a dull sensation that you know you've just had a tasty brew.  Mouthfeel - Not thick like a barleywine (my preferred beverage) but it's not watery either viscosity is present. Very drinkable.  Drinkability - last note said it, this is definitely a drinkable beer, if I had a case of this and an open weekend, I'd make sure I couldn't get to my car keys. 10% abv and you really don't realize it as it goes down.  Effect - this isn't a catagory, but I had only 1 bottle left for this review, wish I had another to sample, but I've already went through the rest of the 6pack over the past week.

287,17112,ElGrecoVerde,4.4,"It's bright, but murky. Harsh, yet comforting. Aggressive, and inviting. I don't know how one makes a beer like this, but Bell's has nailed it again.  Aromas pour out of the glass, everything from oranges to flowers. Sweet sugary flavors greet your mouth, followed by an insane hop presence. And yet, the flavors of honey and apples keep the harshness of the hops in check.  It's a perfectly blended Double IPA. And checking in at 10% abv, who cares if you can't drink them all night?",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",Imperial IPA,98
287,17112,Greggy,4.73,"Appearance- Pours a beautiful orange color, with some very cloudy sediment into a large wine glass, leaving a 2 finger head that slowly recedes to a smaller cap with some great clinging lace on the glass.  Smell- The main component I pick up is the grapefruit. Also, I pick up some aroma's reminiscent of a spring walk in the woods. I can't exactly put my finger on the precise scent, however. I pick up also what seems to be some honey. After a bit of swirling from the glass I get a waft of dole pineapple juice. This nose of this beer, tells me right off the bat that this has some seriously nice balance.  Taste- Initially the palate gets hit with the grapefruit but also some of the pineapple that was previously mentioned is there and a bit of honey/apple. This is probably the most balanced DIPA I have ever had. It has the nice malt backbone but the huge hopiness balances perfectly in my opinion. The finish is semi-dry hopiness with some residual grapefruit.  Mouthfeel- Light/medium carbonation that doesn't get in the way of the main act, the perfect balance of the beer. As mentioned above, this beer has an excellent finish as well.  Drinkability- If I were to guess on the ABV of this beer I would probably guess about 6-7% max, but this thing, being this drinkable at 10%, is dangerous. Not once did I pick up on big alcohol monster creeping in. Well done bells. All I can say is, I am glad I have 17 more bottles until next year.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",Imperial IPA,98

Very nice can't wait to taste it.  T- Great tasting. Amazing balance and the hops jump right out at me. Finishes nice and sweet very complex a lot going in this brew.  M- Very nice medium to a little heavy. Good carbonation on this one. Dangerously smooth for a 10% abv!  D- Easy to drink great look and taste. Only thing that is bad about this brew is the price at 15 for a six pack.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",Imperial IPA,98
287,17112,drunkmonk,4.62,"Finally getting around to review this, as my stash has dwindeled. Hate to see this go.  A- Honey amber, with a stiff rocky head that gives way rather quick. Wispy thin lace sticks around.  S- Pungent Grapefruit and peaches. Some sweet malts there as well.  T- Citric and fruity hops to start, about mid palate they fade to a nice sweet orange marmalade and then malts and honey come in to lend a nice caramel sweetness. Nice balence of bitteness and sweetness is left on the patlate. Fantastic.  M- Medium and somewhat sticky body, carbonation is on the soft side.  D- Extremely easy to drink given it's hefty abv. The only detection of alcohol is the warming feeling you get. This one is easy to get into trouble with.  A fantastic beer, and a must try for hopheads.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",Imperial IPA,98

S: Smells very hoppy, citrus mostly, the honey is evident adding some sugar sweetness.  T: Great flavour, the honey and then hops work really well together. Great light citrus, white grapefuit pith and orange oil, with honey sweetness, giving the counter to the hop bitterness a mead-like quality, just really good stuff.  M: Smooth, full-bodied, great carbonation feel, slightly oily.  D: A really good beer, I'm glad I finally got to try it. The honey really takes over the malt character and makes it light enough that the great hop flavour really shines through.

287,17112,Dukeofearl,4.02,"Part of a ""Michigan Double IPA"" 4-pack put together and sold by Merchant Wine in Dearborn Heights, MI. for $13.99; purchased and consumed late March-early April 2008.  Pours a moderate copper-amber with golden and reddish highlights. No head to speak of, but decent stickage.  Aroma is yummy. Not very descriptive, but spot on correct. Hops, fruity citrus sweetness, and tons of floral notes.  Flavor is very nice representation of the style, huge malt backbone standing up to the aromatics coming alive as flavor. Mandarin oranges and hops, hops, hops. Over the top bitterness in the end of the swallow bring the drinkability down.  Mouthfeel is a very solid rich, full DIPA mouth, but the alcohol burn detracts.  A good brew.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",Imperial IPA,98
287,17112,JEdmund,4.05,"Appearance Golden orange, 1/4"" head, good amount of carbonation bubbles, clear  Smell Pineapple! And then some orange juice, followed by something sharp--most likely a pine-like hop. It's hops through and through, but not quite as big and overpowering as I had anticipated.  Taste & Mouthfeel Hops and more hops, with the same flavors present as in the smell (no surprises). Surprisingly, the body is a bit thin, more like an IPA than a DIPA. I expected more of a luscious, creamy mouthfeel; however, the lightness of it makes it that much more drinkable, although the 10% ABV does not. Aftertaste is of apricots, and there's a dash of malt sweetness peeking its head around all the hops. Very tasty. The alcohol was hidden until the last two sips--then I felt just a bit of heat. Just looked at the label and it say's ""Ale brewed with honey"" which I didn't know until now. That may explain the bit of sweetness I detected.  Overall Hopslam is extremely tasty, but it didn't quite live up to the hype or my expectations (considering how flavorful their IPA is). It seemed like a huge IPA but a small DIPA. This brew has been sitting in the bottle for a few months now and people on this site have been remarking that it's toning down a bit already. So, to be fair, I guess I really need to try this the week it hits the shelves.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",Imperial IPA,98
287,17112,dnichols,4.32,"Thanks to abankovich for a great trade. I poured a capped 12 ounce bottle into a tulip.  A: It poured a light orange colored body with a slight half finger white head that didn't linger long but left a spotty lacing on the side of the glass.  S: It had a dominant aroma of floral hops including pine and citrus (grapefruit and pineapples). There were other ripe white fruits present (white grapes, pears) and some recessive malty aromas.  T: I love a glass of thick, tart and tangy fresh squeezed grapefruit juice for breakfast. This brew reminded me of grapefruit juice. It was tart and tangy without loosing its thick malt base. Well balanced and complex with hints of sweet citruses including oranges and tangerines. The alcohol is very well hidden until it provides a warm clean finish to a high powered brew.  M: It was medium-bodied, creamy and smooth with a warm and clean finish. Nice complexity and wonderful balance.  D: I am not a huge IPA fan but this beer is a great Imperial IPA.

As it warms it picked up a sweeter smell that I cant quite place. Smells like a candy I had as a kid, but cant remember what. Again, very piney.  T - Pine bitterness but a nice sweet balance to it as well. From the honey? Very even taste given the ridculous IBU's. Great taste.  M/D - Nice feel from the carbonation.

287,17112,Bubba83,4.53,"12oz bottle served at 45 degrees into a pint glass.  Excellent color, a dark chill hazed orange with bright orange highlights that runs a gradient to yellow towards the sides. 2 finger widths of head reside on top and seems pillowy in character. Nice spiderwebbed lacing from the rim of head that remains until the last drop.  Smells great, don't pick up much alcohol in the nose, but I pick up beautiful pine and spruce with a smidge of honey, and perhaps some clove as well.  Initially I taste some caramel sweetness which quickly turns into some tart citrus followed by copious amounts of pine. The honey plays nice with the rest of the components and seems there to kind of put everything together. I was worried when I saw it was brewed with honey at first, but the honey is utilized perfectly in the overall flavor profile.  Feels nice in the mouth too. The head is as creamy as it looks, but the beer retains a nice carbonation level as small bubbles run to the top the whole way through. A little prickly at first on the tongue that fades into a nice slick feel and ends wet, not dry.  How can this stuff seriously have 10% ABV? I did not taste the alcohol at all, not even on the swallow. Maybe it's the honey and pine that helps it go down so easy. There is some warming that is just impossible to mask with these higher ABV beers but that's about it...  My first Bell's offering and I am VERY pleased with it. Thanks go to Kegatron for the bottle.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",Imperial IPA,98
287,17112,jred98rt,4.64,"Honestly, this is my favorite beer. I was introduced to it early in my beer drinking career and still love it.  A: poured into a 0.4l pilsner glass. Head depends on the pour, aggressive pour results in a beautiful head, normal pour results in a minimal head, common to my experience with other IPAs. Rich golden color. Nice and clear if you can avoid getting the yeast in the glass.  S: To me, this beer smells happy. One whiff and all of the trials of a long day disappear and I relax into a semi-solid blob. I'd pay a lot for an air-freshener with this smell.  T: The happy doesn't end with the smell. Beautiful flavor of hops, balanced with a sweetish finish. I've found no other IPA to have this flavor, which is depressing since it is such a limited release. The bottle says ""brewed with honey,"" so I'm guessing that's the secret.  M: Very full mouthfeel. A bit bruising if you aren't used to the hops.  D: Exceptional for a double IPA. Not something you can slam, but with this quality, you want it to last.  I've had early release bottles, post release bottles (the liquor store stockpiles it) and tap, all are exceptional.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",Imperial IPA,98

287,17112,Godot,3.98,"From a fairly hard pour I got about a 2 inch head which dropped a little but doesn't really seem to be going anywhere. It is a gorgeous copper gold color, rich and beautiful. The smell is floral hoppiness, clean and fresh with a slight sticky sweet character. The flavor is sharp citrusy hoppiness up front, a sweetness develops, then drops right into a lingering hop biting bitterness. This is far from a balanced beer, more like unadulterated hopjuice, but with a name like Hopslam that is obviously what they were going for. The mouthfeel is average, and drinkability is good for a 10% tastebud peeler. The honey added does a little to mellow it out. If you are a hophead this beer is great. I wouldn't call it complex, but it is what it is and I like that.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",Imperial IPA,98
287,17112,jenbys2001,4.75,"Attractive amber color in the glass with a tiny bit of cream as the head. Earthy, pungent - but not overpowering scent. It reminded me of freshly moved glass. However, there was a distinct fruitiness to this brew. As I continued drinking it, I noticed it smelled exactly like a grapefruit. My husband remarked that it smelled like floral perfume. Super hoppy taste, which I expected, however it lacks that signature bite of many IPAs, making it quite drinkable. The finish is very clean and pleasantly bitter.

287,17112,RedBaron,4.67,"(Thanks to BA Marcobrau for the sample)  What can you say about this beer? It is what it is: a hop bomb in a bottle! Humulus Lupulus lovers unite!  Appearance: Fading California sunset orange; wonderful head retention. Good-lookin' beer. Smell: Wonderful resiny, piney and floral hop aromatics dance in the nose. Good lord does that smell excellent! Taste: Bittering hops play up front, a nice dose of honey and grapefruit have their turn in the middle, and, yes, an actual malty sweetness hits the back of the throat before yielding to a wonderfully dry finish. Mouthfeel: Ya know, for a beer seemingly all about the hops, I think the use of honey in this brew, giving an added sweetness to balance the acidity and dryness of the hops, works brilliantly. It claims to be 10%abv, and I'm sure it is, but it does sneak up on you. Very attenuated beer. Drinkability: High! I'm not sure if this is a fresh sample, but you could've fooled me if not.

A: for a 10% beer it holds the head wonderfully and its so sticky. its perfectly white and looks like little snow caps on top of the beer. the color itself is a hazy brown with a hint of rust red  S: floral, wonderful, amazing, best aroma ever... what else could i say. you crack a fresh one and whiff the aroma and you might cry i almost did. as it ages it tapers a bit but this is still the first beer that start to finish i have been able to enjoy the hop aroma even when the glass is empty  T: this is sex in liquid form its smooth clean, yet a little rough and sweet. to be more specific it has a wonderfully herbal think floral for the mouth, with a touch of piney citrusness, only a touch. the hops are so powerful yet completely under control. i often feel dipa's are too tame, or way too rough. this IS the dipa for me.  have i oversold this beer? maybe, but when i look back on this review, ill rem how i felt and when available go buy a case...",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",Imperial IPA,98

Clear amber dark tan but more reddish than brown. This is a very nice beer to look at.  S: Sweet juicy ripe red grapefruit! Very sweet and powerful like cutting open a fresh ripe fruit.  T: Sweet citrus is upfront and delicious. Definite grapefruit as the sweetness is replaced by the bitter hop bite. The bitterness is overpowering in a good way.  M: Thick and viscous, coats the mouth with a hop napalm that makes you want to chew as you drink. Carbonation is minimal as the syrupy goodness sticks to my mouth.  D: Amazingly smooth and easy to drink but the warming bitter finish slows the process. Sipping this is pure pleasure.

287,17112,younger35,4.47,"Received this beauty from both TheodorHertzle and Brent56K. I love Bells and have been excited to try this beauty. Drank from my Stone India Pale Ale tulip.  Appearance- Pours a bright orangeish/yellowish/red with a decent half finger bright white foamy head. The head recedes fairly slowly leaving a swirled cap and thin bubbly collar with a medium to small amount of lacing. Smell- Deliciously fruity with loads of pineapple, peaches and apricots. A bit of a bready, raw malt underneath but it's covered very well by the abundance of hops. Very fresh and summery, it reminds me a lot of Hop 15. Taste- Mmmm... Bitter but not excruciating like I was expecting after the nose. Loads of fruit including more of the pineapple and some juicy mango. A bit of dry goodness does cut into the bitterness a bit more. The alcohol is there but barely noticeable and it finishes with lingering fruity bitterness. Mouthfeel- Medium body with very light aggressive carbonation and a slightly dry, crisp finish. Drinkability- This is the best beer I've had since I've moved back to Chicago. It's a semi hop bomb, semi a fruity delight! The honey adds a nice touch of dryness in the finish that you really don't expect and it's an all around terrifically done beer.

Bottle is a year old at least, so not sure how much hops have faded, but the smell is more caramelly and of orange with lighter hop backing in the nose, but still nice. Sweet hopped flavor, and the bitterness is somewhat restrained. The flavor is fruity, orange, caramel and a touch of alcohol, and the body is rich and thick, but with prickly carbonation, making for an outstanding mouthfeel. Extremely drinkable DIPA, and one I look forward to trying fresh. Great beer!  Rerate of fresh bottle. Much more vibrant hop character, obviously, along with big fruity bittersweet apricot and floral flavors. Still very drinkable, and brimming with flavor.

The smell is very strong, mainly consisting of bright, citrussy hopes. Mostly grapefruit aromas with an underlying bit of honey. The taste starts with a very, very brief bit of sweetness followed a powerful punch of hop bitterness that knocks your socks off but slowly fades away to a soft bitter aftertaste. As the beer warms, the bitterness calms down, the alcohol starts to show up, and the flavors smooth out a bit. The mouthfeel is nice and medium-bodied.

287,17112,macster,4.49,"Pours from the botttle a slightly hazy, but bright orange/copper color under a creamy 1/2"" beige head. Retention is strong throughout the glass with just a few streaks of lacing noted.  The intial aromas were big-time essence of Juicy Fruit gum and freshly squeezed pink grapefruit juice. This was nicely supported with smells of sun-drenched fresh pine needles, lemon zest, tangerine and some faint sweet honey/floral notes. The 10% alcohol shows up faintly in the aroma serving to amplify the above. The aromas were basically all about the hops, but who's complaining? Fantastic!  Palate was very smooth, silky, creamy with a nicely subtle carbonation.  Flavor was extremely well balanced here between the hops, malts and honey. Yeah, it was definitely dominated by the hops; lots of citrus rind, honey drenched grapefruit and pine. But the late palate delivers a subtle, but balancing presence of orange blossom honey and light crystal malt sweetness. Finishes with a firm hop resin bitterness and a warming alcohol presence.  A very easy-drinking big DIPA. As the last swallow is consumed all you can think of is ""I'd love to do another!""

Beer is a hazy pale orange color with a thin one-finger head of off-white foam that quickly dissipates leaving a fine layer across the surface of the beer. Fine lacing clings to the side of the glass.  Smell: Strong nose of piney hops with floral and citrusy (grapefruit and orange) notes. A hint of mango peeks in here and there. I could smell this all day...  Taste: Hops, hops, and more hops. The malt body here is tough to find amid the pine and bittering hops, as is the honey this is supposedly brewed with. Surprisingly, the citrus and floral nose I detected isn't very apparent in the taste. If you search for them, you can find them, though. ""Tongue-bruising"" qualities diminish as beer warms. Finish is short with a bitter aftertaste.  Mouthfeel: Medium-bodied, thin, crisp, lively and carbonated.  Drinkability/Overall Impression: I actually liked this beer a LOT better when I had it on tap. I really wished this tasted as good as it smelled. I do enjoy my hops, but I prefer more balance between the bitter and floral/citrus varietals. Although I do enjoy this offering, I'm not sure how many I could have in one sitting before the 10% ABV caught up with me. That being said, would I have it again? Absolutely. I look forward to picking it up next year and working it in with my other IPA/DIPAs.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",Imperial IPA,98
287,17112,sinistrsam,4.25,"Bottle given to me as a gift from my fellow beer-enthusiast, Keith. I'd been dying to get my hands on one of these for the last year, so my expectations were perhaps a bit unrealistic.  It hada great orange/copper/gold color with a medium offwhite head and great lacing. The aroma was piney and floral hops, citrus and sweet malt, mild sweet fruits. The taste was good but not the excellent, hoppy and complex experience I was expecting. Not to say it wasn't good, but it wasn't anything outstanding. There was a good balance of floral hops with almost caramel malt and grain, but it was nothing groundbreaking. The mouthfeel was very good, with a good crisp hop bitter-sweetness, complimented by a heavy dose of bitting carbonation. Ultimately it ended up fading into a smooth and sweet aftertaste. Overall this was very drinkable and a hell of a good beer, and as some others have said, it may take more than one of these to realize some of the nuances, and fully appreciate the beer.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",Imperial IPA,98
287,17112,giblet,4.67,ok. first beer from Bell's i was disappointed. the second was better. this is the third.  Excellent!!! poured nicely. nice head and carbonation. some nice lace. the aroma is my opinion of a super nice citrus pine hoppy aroma. the flava? well i think this is one of the BEST double IPA beers i have had. i have had quite a few and this girl is top 3 for me!!!  suckem up and movem out!  giblet,Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",Imperial IPA,98
287,17112,flannelman808,4.32,"I had high expectations, as I love Bells two hearted...  Citrus, and grapefruit with strong underlying hop characteristics. Alcohol Is present in the finish but not overwhelming. This beer lives up to expectation.  It pours a golden amber and has decent head retention.  Floral hoppy character on the nose, with some spice coming through as well.

287,17112,TheBierBand,4.25,"Had on tap at the Heorot in Muncie, IN. Served in a tulip glass with a generous 1"" off-white head over a orangy colored beer. The head lasted quite a while and left lots of clumpy lace as I drank.  Aroma: I could pick up lots of citrusy hops... like orange peel. But this was balanced off by a generous helping on toasted malt too.  Taste: Quite good! a rich, robust dose of citrusy hops that is well-balanced witha sweet caramel and grainy flavor.  Mouthfeel: Smooth and with good body. Carbonation is medium and provides a nice body and weight to this beer.  Drinkability: Excellent. Could enjoy a few of these.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",Imperial IPA,98
287,17112,mfhlucky13,4.35,"A: Deep gold with just a small amount of head, no lace.  S: Hops abound with a sweet floral backing, crystallized ginger.  T: Lots of hops and citrus, but the honey sweetens it up so that there is balance.  M: Plenty of carbonation to keep your tongue interested, while the hops spoil your palate.  D: Very drinkable DIPA !!!",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",Imperial IPA,98
287,17112,ASymon13,4.32,"It looks like a thick copper, just like most doube IPA's, with a nice off-white head. The head is solid at first but dissipates relatively quick with minimal lacing.  The smell is very reminiscent of Two Hearted Ale, only there are added pine notes to go with the floral style. Centennial hops still appear to to be the dry-hop of choice here, according to the smell alone.  Hops are everywhere in the taste. Flowers are in the opening, and also rise in the closing, with some pine and a dash of citrus in the middle. Very nice, the malt definitely takes a back seat as expected.  It is medium to full bodied, and due to the strength of it, it is not the most drinkable, but that is expected with the style. The carbonation is low, probably due to the strength of it. Overall, it is an awesome DIPA. It lives up to the style beautifully, and will always give me the blast of hops I often crave. Too bad it is only brewed once a year.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",Imperial IPA,98
287,17112,tmitch75,4.63,"Nice amber color with a light pink tint. Solid head drops to a thin covering and leaves solid lacing. I couldn't even see through the lacing at one point, it was like a sheet.  Sweet smell with floral hops and a full citrus smell.  Uniquely sweet taste. First IPA I've had with honey in it, I didn't know what that sweetness until half way through. Hops are awesome - tons of citrus and some exotic fruit. I think it's mango. Alcohol is well hidden - no taste of the 10% ABV at all.  Medium to full body - solid. Body is full like the flavor.  This is a strong, well-balanced beer. Awesome. It fully deserves any and all hype that it gets.  Tasted 3/18/08.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",Imperial IPA,98
287,17112,tpd975,4.7,"I have had this one in the bottle several times. Today was my first time on draft.  A: A cloudy orange brillant orange color with an ample head. The head dies down but sheet after sheet of lacing is left behind. Beautiful.  S: There is alot of citrus hops and a sweetness coming from the glass. Tons of fresh squeezed FLORIDA orange juice, along with a bit of ruby red grapefruit and a touch of pine. Wow, I can't wait to taste this one on draft.  T: Absoultely Wonderful! I have been pounding bottles of this on since its release, but HOLY SHIT, this is even better on draft. Tons of big bold sweet flavors come bursting at you. If you want juicy this is it. There are so many different citrus flavors your body goes into sensory overload. The hops rush in somewhere in the middle and just sit and mingle with the sweetness. I absoluetly love this beer. There is no hint of the ABV that is one packs.  M: A perfect match of medium body with full carbonation. The hops sting my tounge with each drink only to be mellowed out by a wonderful citrus sweetness.  D: I will once again proclaim this the most drinkable DIPA on the market. I realize it is only a 12 oz when many of the other greats come in bombers, but I could drink these until I pass out. (which would not be long by the way).  Overall: Are you suprised Bell's has made another great beer, I'm not. It's a true DIPA that drinks like an IPA. It is sooo smooth it goes down like water, eh, more like nectar. It is a wonderful brew that should be sought out. It truly is in a class of its own.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",Imperial IPA,98
287,17112,jsgpu90,4.74,"Stopped into a local bar after work that had this on tap. On top of that the rep from Bells was on site who was wonderful to talk to.  This is unlike other big hopped beers. It has more floral overtones and citrus flavors than other hopped up beers. The smell is wonderful, it's as if I died and went to hop heaven. After trying this I called the distributors in the area to see who had a case (got to love Pennsylvaia where you have to buy a case). While the bottles are very good, they pale (no pun intended) in comparison to the draft.  I fear that I may miss this beer as the hop shortage continues.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",Imperial IPA,98
287,17112,Wheeble,4.12,"Got a recommendation of this brew from another member  Pours a good color, but for most ""big beer"" IPA's not as nice as I expected, had a mediocre head regardless of a vigorous pour and dissapeared rather quickly  Smell was amazing. Amazing aroma of citrus fruits, lemon, a hint of orange peels, and a rush of hops to finish it off.  Taste was great as well. Definitely a great IPA, but from what I was expecting was not as I imagined  I was comparing this beer to Troegs Nugget Nectar, as that was what I was told this tasted closest to, but in all honesty it wasnt.  I could definitely drink this brew year round, but I would place 90 Minute IPA as well as Nugget Nectar above this beer.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",Imperial IPA,98
287,17112,SurlyDuff,4.1,"Orange amber with a sticky ipa-style head.  Passion/tropical hops, bright citrus and weak pine in the nose.  Fresh flavor with the sweetest hop profile i've tasted in an IPA. Sticky resiny pineapple and papaya. Sugary grapefruit in there too.  Mouthfeel is medium to full, with a great balance from begining to finish. There is a sweetness that makes the drinkability pretty high, which balances the bitterness of the hops. An attempt to control the bitterness with the sweetness doesn't really rub me the right way.  Good beer. A fine IPA, and original/unique flavors. It was just a bit sweet and tropical for my ipa tastes.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",Imperial IPA,98
287,17112,bassmantin,4.61,"Pours a fairly transparent orange/red with a nice thick fine white head.  Smell is very floral and hoppy and sweet. Taste is extremely hoppy, with a nice bitter finish and a decent alcohol burn. This is the essence of hops, highly concentrated yet very tasty. There's a bit of sweetness, too, that balances the hoppiness well.  This is a great beer. What a joy for hop heads. Bell's has managed to bottle pure hop extract.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",Imperial IPA,98
287,17112,Andrewtherooster,4.51,"Appearance- Poured into a pint glass, I got a great two finger head. Thick, creamy foam that looked just heavenly. Huge bubble lacing that sticks to the glass in great rings. I love it.  Smell- This beer smells incredible. I can smell the sweetness of the honey and pineapple along with the hops.  Taste- Whew. I love it. The pineapple that I smelled is still there, but there is such a complexity of flavors here. The hops are the body of this beer, but there is an outstanding moment in every sip where there's this great transition from bitterness to sweetness to the finish. And the finish is a memorable one. I can taste that slow burn of alcohol, but it's not such a bad thing.  Mouthfeel- Very carbonated, but that's to be expected. Not watery and not too thick. Goes down smooth.  Drinkability- This is a very noteworthy beer. It's something to be appreciated and treated right. It's great to slow down and enjoy a beer that is a work of art. That being said, I couldn't have more than one or two in a night. It's 10% ABV is not lost on me.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",Imperial IPA,98
287,17112,VikingBeer,4.67,"12 oz. bottle from Greenwood Spirits (Bowling Green), poured into a Unibroue ""tulip.""  Pours a slightly hazy, tangerine-tinged honey gold, with a finger-and-a-half of pillowy head. that dissipates slowly to a persistent quarter-inch, leaving stubborn lacing as the beer is consumed.  A blast of citrus greets my first sniff, smelling of grapefruit rind without any pithy funkiness. The citrus is quickly cut by floral esters, which in turn lead to a smell I can only describe as ""green"" or ""spring-ish"" (gotta love highly specific technical terms). Surprisingly, there is a slight yeasty malt aroma underneath the whirlwind of hops. The smell is so complex that I wish I was reviewing this on a clearer palate (this is my ""nightcap"" beer for today).  My first sip is rewarded with an instant blast of hops to follow the aroma: wonderful fresh grapefruit oil, kumquats, fresh apricot, a hint of white pepper and other spices (nutmeg, mace, perhaps a touch of allspice). The honey mentioned on the label appears in the surprising malt sweetness that enters on the tail of the other flavors; nothing unpleasant, just enough for a delicious, winey balance. The 9.3% alcohol is almost undetectable until the beer nears room temperature, and even then it is barely detectable against the other flavors.  Mouthfeel is just about dead on: medium-full, slightly oily body that leaves a surprisingly pleasant slickness that begs for another sip. Carbonation is just sufficient to keep things a bit lively without turning too frothy in the mouth.  DANGEROUSLY DRINKABLE. This beer is more complex than merely huge. Aroma and taste are like a palette of hop flavors, making me wonder what varieties were used. The best characteristic of this beer is that I taste the best aspects of hops without the drawbacks (extreme bitterness, pith flavor, etc.), and that the subtle sweetness perfectly tempers the rawness of the hops. I only have this bottle at the moment, or I would be sorely tempted to crack another. I only dock half a point from the drinkability because more than a couple might knock one off one's barstool. Highly recommended.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",Imperial IPA,98
287,17112,edmedina,4.92,"Wow what a great beer here. One of the characteristics of an IPA is the strong presence of hops. This beer has them in there. It pours an amber color and has very little head. The first thing you will notice with this beer is aroma. My god it is a heavenly smell. It is very much a flowery bouquet in there. Now I have not yet learned my hops by smell but I am sure more experienced beer lovers could pick out the hops used in this brew just based on the smell. It has a smooth and sweet taste. One that makes drinking more than one very easy to take down. However, that is not good as it 10% ABV. So it's pretty easy to get drunk off this beer, which is a shame. This is a beer that should be enjoyed slowly to savor all that is have to offer.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",Imperial IPA,98

Pours off yellowish bright orange, frothy white head and some cloudy yeast dust, laces nicely, exellent looker, just pour it out slower and colder if you prefer a clearer product.  Monstrous aroma of apple, pear, apricot grapefruit and juicy fruit. Intense! Flavor is a big bunch of those same perceived in aromas blended with a melanoidin rich tasting malt backbone. Medicinal, grepfuit-like bitteness in the finale and in the mouthfeel is not puckering like some hop-centered ales can become. Bravo!

Lots of citrus and even some floral hops. I also detect quite a bit of spice. My mouth is watering just smelling this! The taste is wonderful; the malts are more upfront than I remember, not that it's a bad thing, but I distinctly remember the hops being the focus on the last one I had. My palate could be messed up so who knows. Had it not have been for the 10% ABV I could drink this beer all night.

It's hugely floral and hoppy - so sweet and the body has good balance - mouthfeel isn't overpowering yet full, and the finish is dry and bitter.  This is a VERY drinkable beer. If it wasn't for the high ABV, I'd dare say this should be a session beer.

287,17112,Philabeerphia,4.62,"From Notes: on tap at Eulogy - ""Leftover"" from Sat. night w/ Larry Bell. Poured into a 5lb chalice. Glad I made it in for a Monday tasting in this nutty place.  APPEARANCE&gt;During pour this quickly achieved a 2 finger head, puffy soft and creamy white, slowly and steadily dissipated into a dense sliver of a cap on the beer below. Medium lacing that lasts only for seconds...The beer in the low light of the bar appeared very cloudy, full of particulates, organic, golden and copper. Looks good. SMELL&gt; vanilla, milk, deep heavy floral notes, lightens a bit into melon&gt; cantaloupe, keeps going into pine and cannabis as the hoppy undertone begins to shine with warmth... TASTE&gt; up front bananas and melon backed by the candy caramel malt. Very surprised at this. This is warm and 'easy' on the palette. More intense in the middle and back, sweet pine, fresh grass & greens, now its bitter pine, pockets of growing bittery intensity, resiney and becoming somewhat intense bitterness that hurts the throat and hangs in thick drips. MOUTHFEEL&gt; Just enough carbonation to lighten up the creamy and buttery MF. diacetyl qualities, gliding down the throat. Never do I pucker from this (good/bad?). DRINKABILITY&gt; Not an monstrous hop bomb, but one of the more extreme beers I've tasted nonetheless. warm and 'exotic'.

287,17112,PBRstreetgang,4.52,"2008 version (10% ABV) Pours a golden bronze with a thick, creamy two and a half finger head. Dull clarity with excellent retention and spectacular spiderweb lacing. The nose is truly amazing- heavy pine needle scent with robust tangerine/mango tropical hop oil aroma, some orange and grapefruit rind in the background; and a soild caramel malt backing. There is another sweet aroma here I could not place, but when I noticed that the label says it is brewed with honey, I found that to be a likely culprit. The first sip reveals the honey further- like clover with a touch of orange blossom- the malt tastes like a medium roast crystal with some two-row thrown in for good measure. Thankfully, the sweetness carries over into the aftertaste and attempts some kind of balance. The first wave of hop flavor is a pungent mix of pine sap-tangy ripe fruit; followed by fresh cut grass and oranges, and finally grapefruit and resinous earthy hop oils and cling to the tounge but in a very soft- low cohumulone sort of way. This beer is bursting with both malt and hop flavor- especially american ""C"" varieties like Cascade, Chinook, Columbus and Centennial; yet is does not overwhelm the taste buds with boistrious alpha acids or astringent bitterness like some other hop bombs. This beer presents a unique and charismatic malt profile set against a showcase of west coast hop volatiles. The body is full and the carbonation light- just enough to prevent cloying and lift some of the more stubborn hop residues. It finishes flashy and saturated with the taste of fresh hop cones dipped in honey and copper-colored malt. The flavor is balanced enough to achive a good drinkability despite the heavy mouthfeel and lingering flavors. This limited availability seasonal is elite amongst it's D.I.P.A. bretheren, but still not worth the $16.00 a six pack price tag- hop crisis be damned.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",Imperial IPA,98

Beer pours an orange, copper color with a small white, bubbly head. Very soft carbonation and moderate lacing around the glass.  Aroma is pretty sweet for a DIPA, but also immense floral and citrus hops. Traces of honey are hidden in the background.  Taste starts out with a big, bitter hop bite, moves to a sweet malt, lemon and honey flavor and finally leaves you with a long, bitter and citrus finish. Quite nice and complex.  Mouthfeel is thick and oily. This is probably an easy drinker for most hopheads. Maybe too easy, considering it weighs in at 10%. Check this one out.

Pours a reddish-gold with a nice frothy head that dissolved and left a nice layer of bubbles on the top. I'm sitting about 2 feet away from the beer, looking at its color and I can already smell the pungent hops. Nice and floral in the nose with a grapefruity tint. Bring your nose closer to the beer and you can smell the bitterness. The first sip starts out very sweet, but then your tounge gets attacked by the amazing hoppiness of the beer. The tounge is then cleansed and warmed with the 9.3% abv of the beer. It is a bit heavier than I thought it would be, and I could have gone for some more carbination.

And the taste! and the smell! strong resins predominate, a lemony piney, citrusy balm that lingers in the nose and contributes to a most amazing taste. You are drinking a wonderfully balanced but strong, nuanced but powerful beer. One of the best beers that I have had so far in 2008. Wonderful.

287,17112,kkipple,4.16,"A. Clear, still orange with a fat 3 finger head that fades over time. No lacing, decent retention.  S. Big grapefruit and piney hops, then sweet malt and the advertised honey, clean, some oranges and flowers. Mostly just hop juice. Citrus and pure. If you like hops, you'll love this.  T. A fine blend of citrusy hops and sweet lightly toasted grain, with an orangey, alcoholic dry finish and some sappy, sticky pine notes. Hopslam is quite basic, simply variations on hops and grain sugars, but is wonderfully balanced and tasty. Think a less aggressive Double Dog or a hoppier, less sweet 90 minute and you're getting there.  M. Decent carbonation, finish is bitter and hoppy with an eventual sweet note. Alcohol is warming and certainly seems like the proclaimed 10%.  Hopslam is good, and drinkable, but ultimately doesn't bring a lot new to the table. It's simply a good Double IPA; but there's nothing wrong with that, either.

I was drinking with some friends and the lady next to me said thats a hopslam eh? Just by the smell, quite potent  Taste: The taste is really amazing, citrusy at first and surprisingly smooth. For the amount of hops not much of an after taste you would think that would come along with it.  Mouthfeel: Again suprisingly smooth, almost thick mouth feel, goes down great for a 10% abv...unfortunatly  Drinkability: Well, two or three pints of this will get you where you need to be really fast, I would start with one then move on to something a little less intense on the Abv...all around excellent beers.

A full nose of floral and fruity hops, some slight sweet-fruit aroma in there too.  Up front a lot of hop sweetness that reminds me of citrus fruit; it has the hop flavors without a lot of bitterness. Some malt undertones are noticeable too, providing just a touch of balance to the sweetness. Next I notice some floral flavors that are probably from the honey. The honey doesn't add any sweetness (does it ever?), but it is still noticeable. Finishes with more hops and some dryness. All kinds of hops actually, with grapefruit, pine resin and some bitterness. I would never have guessed that this beer was over 9% ABV.  A good mouthfeel typical to the style, but fairly light and effervescent. The honey leaves just a touch of a coating on the mouth.  Excellent drinkability, not too dry, too strong or too sweet. Lots of hops. The balance in this one makes me want to drink it all night, but at the same time the hops are huge. Well done Bell's, too bad I can't afford much of this stuff.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",Imperial IPA,98
287,17112,CrazyMacHarris99,4.02,Poured a slightly hazy orange color with a one finger white head. The smell hits you as you pour. Smells of pine and citrus hops with a sweet fruity scent somewhat like white wine. The taste is again pine and citrus hops but the sweetness is very strong. Taste of grape and honey that really balances out the hops. There is some alcohol burn in the finish but isn't unpleasant. The mouthfeel is light to medium with good carbonation. Overall I really liked this one even though I usually don't like big hops. This one was balanced well and really impressed me.,Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",Imperial IPA,98
287,17112,SafeAtFirst,4.57,"The pour is a bright orange tinged copper color with a fluffy white head.  The aroma hits right away, huge hop aromas are a mix of citrus and tropical fruits, like a mix between a mango and a grapefruit. Pine needle aromas sneak out as it warms.  On the tongue it's more of the same hop flavors, a little more pine flavor with plenty of grapefruit and orange and plenty tongue burning hop bitterness. Honey and biscuit flavors make an attempt at balance, they mostly fail. The finish is dry and bitter with a spicy burn form the 10.5% ABV.  If you call yourself a hop head then you must seek out this big, brutally bitter beer. I have yet to try a beer that comes closer to capturing the essence of American hops.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",Imperial IPA,98
287,17112,jeffmonarch,4.45,"12 oz. bottle in a snifter.  A - Really nice copper orange color, slightly cloudy with little white head that disappears quickly.  S - Really strong piney hops.

Enjoy!",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",Imperial IPA,98
287,17112,JustinOSU99,4.39,"A: Pours a nice goldenrod color with a good amount of head.  S: Smells amazing! Hops immediately hit the nose and give you a first-hand experience of why it is called ""hopslam"". I'm really looking forward to drinking this. Hiding behind the hops is a little aroma of raisin, honey, grapefruit and molasses.  T: Holy cow. Hops come up and smack you right in the face. Definite alcohol warmth follows along with some citrus and raisin hitting the palate.  M: Warm and fuzzy in the mouth. A bit heavy but that is to be expected. Dry and tart in the end.  D: Don't drink too many of these at 9.3 abv, but definitely a treat to be had once in awhile.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",Imperial IPA,98

Flowery hop bitterness with sweet honey aroma and perfumy alcohol burn on back of nostrils.  Taste brings a little grapefruit but primarily a nice blend of flowers, alcohol, honey and apple. This is nice stuff.  Slightly syrupy but clean on the mouth - tough to gauge if served a little cold.  This is easily drinkable for 1-2 - gets a little heavy on the back end.

287,17112,EStreet20,4.82,"Got my hands on some. Please Bell's come to NJ.  12 ounce bottle, shaker pint glass.  A - Pours out a pale golden color. Tiny bubbles rush up to a fairly sizable white head. Head stays nicely (thank you hops).  S - Big grapefruit on the nose. Some sweet fruit smell as well. Underneath all the fruitiness is a subtle pine tone.  T - Wow. What a great tasting DIPA. The hops are of course taking charge here, but a nice fruity sweetness is there too. This is a big flavored DIPA with citrus/tropical fruit flavors all over the place. Subtle alcohol flavor on the finish, but it's mostly well hidden. A great, fruity DIPA that ends with a rush of dry bitterness.  M - Nice, coating sticky mouthfell to a medium bodied beer.  D - Loving it. The many mixed fruit flavors mix seamlessly with the hops. A very well put together DIPA that brings all the vrashness one expects from the style, but does have a unique feature that almost resembles balance which we all know is not a benchmark characteristic for the style. Just makes you want more.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",Imperial IPA,98

S: You can smell this one in the next room. Delicious. A nice balance of citrus, mango and papaya, with extreme hops. The nose on this is fantastic. T: It's hoppy, but not overly bitter like some others. Again, this beer delivers. The balance is unbelievable. Citrus and hops up front with a slight malty sweetness, a faint trace of honey, and a slow finish that leaves you wanting more. Not overdone on thealcohol either, which is hard to believe at 10%. M: Medium body with moderate carbonation. Lingers a little which I enjoy in this one. D: Yes please! The whole package delivers, a nice brew (or two) to cap off a work week. Just full of flavor.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",Imperial IPA,98
287,17112,babyhobbes,4.32,"Another delicious Bells offering. I want to thank my neighbor for this thank you for dog-watching beer. I'm drinking it with her (the dog) right now!  Small, off-white head with a nice amber color. Looks like beer...Smells like grapefruit and hops...or perhaps that is grapefruity hops, eh?  The taste is surprisingly hoppy without being overly bitter. This is even more true when having this on-tap.  This is far too easy drinking and yet, it is so delicious. I could easily have too many, and too many would probably be two. So, it's a good thing I am at home.  If you have a chance to try this on-tap, definitely do so. In the bottle it is great but on-tap it is much different. I found it much more hop scented with less bitterness. (It's funny how sometimes bitterness and hoppiness are not the same.) It's much smoother on-tap, too.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",Imperial IPA,98

The hops seem to linger on the palate for a while. No taste of alcohol either shockingly.  M-Just enough carbonation, has a slight bite to it, medium bodied.  D-If you're a hophead check this one out, tastes great and smells great also.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",Imperial IPA,98
287,17112,asabreed,4.79,"12 oz. bottle into a pint glass.  Appearance: A lighter copper color with some amber highlights, bubbles shooting toward the top, and a head that leaves some chaotic lacing throughout the glass, like little spiderwebs in circular layers, which happens more toward the pour and less throughout.  Smell: Easily one of the best hop aromas from any semblance of an IPA. Huge malt sweetness, enormous citrus punch, dripping pine sap, and complete balance through and through. Seriously, if this were a candle, and the aroma could come through as well as this, I'd be lighting them up all over the place. Wonderful and almost ineffably effervescent.  Taste: At 10%, I don't understand how the balance is this good. Toffee, caramel, lemon zest, earthiness, pine, grapefruit rind, bread crust. Visceral, balanced, malty, with the extremely balanced and drippingly resonant, piney, and citrus hops. Just awesome and something I want to return to over and over.  Mouthfeel: Creamy, medium-bodied, and nothing to complain about, with carbonation that makes its presence known from the ongoing of the first sip to the last of the swallow, all the while contributing to the flavors making their way across the vastness of what the palate proves to be able to recognize.  Drinkability: I don't know if Bell's needs to just do the worthwhile brews or not, but lately those have been the best for me. And this may be their best. A deliciously balanced hop attack, with way too much to admire, and much to look forward to, at least from my end, when it's released each year. It's pretty expensive for a 6-pack, from around $12 to $15, but it's worth it, and I'll continue to buy it when it's available. Does anyone else think it's time for Bell's to start releasing some vintage and special bombers?

287,17112,JohnnyDuvel,4.54,"This may be the best smelling beer I've ever had! The grapefruit aromas could be detected several feet away. Pours a golden, almost orange color - small head. Taste is fruity and hops, hops, hops. Lives up to it's name. Ultimately, it's on the bitter side, but quite drinkable nonetheless. This is a terrific beer (made by a terrific brewery). Keep 'em coming to SW Fl., Bells!",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",Imperial IPA,98
287,17112,dancinwillie,4.02,"a: slightly darker than your average peach. 1 finger white head that seems to be holding up pretty well.  s: grapefruit, with slight pine and spice. also hints of floral aroma.  t: floral and citrus up front, and perhaps a bit o' honey. good flavor from the hops, but I am not picking up much malt. It doesn't seem unbalanced, though I would'nt mind just a bit more backbone. picking up an almost minty taste towards the end, although very slight. I love tasting grapefruit in ipa's and iipa's.  m: it almost seemed a little flat for the first few sips, but then the carbonation seemed to kick in. mouthfeel seems a little heavy in a good way, but not quite thick.  d: overall, a pretty high drinkability. my bottle says 10% abv, and I really taste no alcohol.

I get some citrus and flower flavors up front. I'm pretty sure I can taste some malt even, maybe caramel. The hop punch is there, but not so bad I can't drink it. Very well balanced with the malt flavor that I wasn't expecting to be there. This is the first IIPA that I have had where it isn't a struggle to tolerate the bitterness. Either I am developing a taste for it, or it's well done.  m - smooth texture with a decent amount of carbonation. I've never had a high abv beer with good carbonation, but this is pretty good.  d - this is high abv and intense in flavor. I was expecting something that was going to be hard to drink, but I think I'm getting used to hoppy beers.

287,17112,sjohansen,4.55,"Pours a ruby colored amber. Hazy with a one finger cream colored head. Disappears quickly, but leaves sticky lace all over.  If you're a hop head, this is what heaven smells like. Piney, citrusy hops. As it warms, there are rubbing alcohol notes, which you have to expect with a 10% abv kick.  I had this on draft and it was slightly different. Definitely more sweetness and honey notes from the draft, the bottle is all hop kick. As it warms, the true balance comes out. It gets extra sweet on the front of the palate, but remains chokingly bitter on the finish. The sweetness, definitely from the honey, battles valiantly against the punch of the hops. It loses the battle, but is effective in creating a combination of sweet and bitter not seen since General Tso's Chicken.  The mouthfeel is not syrupy or slimy like other strong DIPA's. It is excited, and smooth.  I love this one. Surprisingly it was not ruined by all of the hype (and there certainly is enough of it.) As far as pushing limits, this is a winner for finding some way to balance the generally overpowering hop characteristics of other DIPA's.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",Imperial IPA,98
287,17112,Sconnie,4.62,"This is a serious beer. Smells like strong citrus hops with a bit of sweetness. Initial hop bitterness gives way to a bit of sweetness at the end to balance things out and give a nice aftertaste of not-overly-bitter hop flavor. Really good stuff. You can sense the honey. Very balanced for an imperial IPA. The alcohol is well hidden (I had no idea this was 10% abv until I read the label), but with alcohol that high, this is a once an evening drink. I truly believe that Bells is one of the best breweries in the country right now, and this beer helps prove my theory.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",Imperial IPA,98
287,17112,GRPunk,4.54,"Bottle (Batch ID 8277) poured into a tulip glass.  A- It poured golden/peach color with about a 1/2 finger off-white head that became a good lace that left some nice sticky spots and a medium-heavy carbonation.  S- The aroma was complex. It was sweet and floral with citrus tones that reminded me of grapefruit. As it warmed, the scent became something of a ripe peach. Very different than other beers I've experienced.  T- There was more complexity in the flavor. It had plenty of sweet malt to stand up to the oily and earthy hops.  M- It had a medium foamy carbonation with a pleasant hop tingle.  D- It's a nice smooth sipper. The 10% ABV is well hidden. If it wasn't for the dizzying effects, I couldn't have been convinced it was so strong.  Overall- It's a more balanced beer than the name would suggest.

287,17112,Shaw,4.92,"It's great that we're getting such heralded beers as Hopslam in Florida. At about $17 a six-pack, it better be worth it! ;-)  Pours a light amber in color, typical of the style, with a thick off-white head that doesn't disappear. This head stays about a half-inch thick in my glass.  The smell is phenomenal. Incredible aromas of citrus hops mix with an aroma that I can only compare to pineapple. This is the hoppiest-smelling beer yet and one of the best-smelling beers I've had.  The taste is fantastic. It's like liquid hops. The citrus and vegetable flavors mix with a nice sweetness from the malt. There's a honey flavor, too, which is easy to credit to the honey, except that my homebrewing experience with honey is that it adds dryness, not a honey flavor. I'm surprised that the IBUs are so high. This actually doesn't taste harshly bitter. This beer is more about hop flavor than hop bitterness.  The aftertaste is all about hops. It's like having a hop pellet rolling around in my mouth. I almost feel like I could blow a hop smoke ring after a sip of Hopslam.  There is a nice warming alcohol effect after swallowing. This beer is obviously strong, but not a fusel alcohol bomb.  The body is glassy, thanks to the high alcohol, but there's plenty to chew on.  West Coast brewers, watch out!  This is easily one of the best beers I've ever had and shoots right into my top five. (Currently tied for No. 1 with Rogue Imperial India Pale Ale.)

287,17112,shadow1961,3.87,"Bell's Hopslam Double India Pale Ale pours two creamy fingers of foam over a cloudy peach colored brew. The nose is big juicy grapefruit. The flavor is big fruity malts up against those citrusy hops. It finishes smooth but a grapefruit rind aftertaste lingers. Mouthfeel is round-ish and crisp due to those hop additions, and all that malt and hop action completely covers up the 10% alcohol by volume- which only makes itself known as a warming sensation. If you like Bell' s Two-Hearted, you really need to try the Hopslam- it's bigger, and more West Coast.

287,17112,PittBeerGirl,3.84,"A- Body is transparent bright amber and pours with a very small foamy white head that dissipates almost immediately after the pour. A thin collar remains the whole way down. No lacing is left behind in the glass.  S-Nose is bright and blooming with citrus (mostly grapefruit) hops. Behind the citrus hops is a less prominent character of refreshing piny hops. Deep in the background is smooth caramel malt to balance out the hops.  T- I wish this brew tasted exactly as it smelled. Initial flavor is somewhat subtle and consists of mostly citrus hop flavor though both piny hops and caramel malt can be detected in the background. The citrus piny hop flavors strengthen for the finish. What is left to linger is some piny hop flavor, a very subtle flavor of caramel and a residual rind bitterness that is greater than moderate. The residual bitterness-to me- is borderline cloying.  M-Medium carbonation and smooth oily body that is full of hops. This is the kind of mouthfeel I wish were in every DIPA.  D- This is a very enjoyable DIPA but it didn't do anything magical for me. It would be near perfect if it tasted exactly how it smells-but it doesn't. The flavor is pretty good but didn't blow me away. The ABV is very well hidden here. The strengths definitely lie in the smell and mouthfeel of this one. Pretty good brew overall and one I will have again.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",Imperial IPA,98
287,17112,bboven,4.81,"Wow. Wow. Wow. Wow.  The only un-great part of this beer is the appearance. I realize that there is an enormous dry hop addition, which I thoroughly enjoy later, but The beer loks like a half-pound of light caramel candy melted into a pint glass. I'm looking at it ad thinking there is no way I can stomach this beer. But the finger-high, wicked-consistent head and thick lacing remind me that it is indeed a beer.  The aroma is high alpha hops, Chinook, maybe Warrior, that earthy, dirty hop aroma that is so indicative of that northwest hop circle.  They say it's brewed wit honey, though I'd love to believe they achieved the sweet maltiness with barley alone. That's upfront. You would think with such a high hop aroma, this one would twist your throat with bitterness, but it doesn't. There's a little jab on the way down to remind you that hop is in the name, but, it doesn't fight.  The carbonation on this is so great I'd swear it was casked if you gave it to me at 55 degrees. Sticky and drying at the same time, but did I mention the carbonation? I'm a proper carbonation nut, and this beer has it.

I smelled the hops from two feet away. I can't remember a beer with this strong of a hoppy aroma. Once it settles a bit, the aroma is sweet and citrusy with very pleasant bitterness.  T - The flavor of this beer, and one would hope and expect, is dominated by the hops. It's wonderfully bitter, starting with citrus (orange peel, mostly) and running though a bit of sweetness to a nice floral, piney finish. A hop-lovers dream.

Hoppy (standard citrusy/piney American hops).  Taste-- Sweet god, hops! It's almost like I got slammed with them... weird. For a very short period of time sweet flavors dance around on the tip of the tongue before getting obliterated by the oncoming Bitter Train. Leaves extremely pleasing hop flavors all over my mouth... citrus, sticky pine, etc... The carbonation certainly enhances the impact. Sticky malt backbone (barely) keeps things in check.

Also a slight sweetness in the aroma.  Taste was great as well. Bitter hoppiness nicely balanced by a complementary malty sweetness. This beer tastes good!  Mouthfeel is very smooth. The hops hit first but you get a nicely cleaned palate after each sip.  Overall, this beer goes down far too easily for its high ABV. Be careful!

S: Sweet floral hop abundance! The aroma coming out of this mug was awesome!  T: Hops dominate this brew through and through, but not necessarily all bitter. The initial hit to the senses is definitely a hoppy bitterness, but there was a short burst of identifiable maltiness before it swings hard to a bitter floral hop finish with a wonderfully long hop linger.

But that's what happens when we expand our palets, tastes change.  Anyway, this poured a nice pale amber color with a thick white head atop the brew. Smelled of pine and wildflowers.  Very hoppy, as to be expected. I split it with my wife and she liked it a lot, but for me the hops were almost too much and took on an almost soapy characteristic.  I get what all the ravings are about though, for hop heads this is like a dream beer. I'm a fan of hops, but not to the extent that I'd be seeking this out again... though maybe.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",Imperial IPA,98
287,17112,InsolublePancake,4.02,"Quick note before reviewing: I went to the website and entered the batch number just for kicks (I know this beer is fairly recent because it hasn't been long since I bought it), and the number came up as invalid. I noticed the site has been revamped recently, so maybe they're still having some issues with it. Either that, or this is a counterfeit beer, and my whole review is a lie. I'm hoping for the former.  A- Golden orange with a decent yellowish-white head after a vigorous pour.  S- The aroma hit as soon as the bottle was opened. Fantastic hop smell of oranges and flowers with a nice underlying sweetness.  T- Nice resiny hop flavor backed by a substantial malt presence. The hops are huge, but they are balanced out by the underlying honey-like sweetness. Of course, the hops still clearly have the upper hand. The bitterness is substantial, but not overwhelming. The only thing that mars the flavor a bit is the alcohol, which seems quite strong at times. The ABV is a little over 9%, but if I didn't know better, I'd guess it was closer to 11 or maybe even 12%.  M- Pretty full-bodied; you can tell you're drinking something substantial. Carbonation is fairly low, but still present.  D- The drinkability takes a bit of a hit because of the alcohol and the overall richness. Some people I've talked to said they finished bottles of this beer in just a few minutes and that the alcohol was well-hidden, but that hasn't been my experience. It takes me a while to finish one, and I typically wouldn't want another after that (although there are definitely exceptions to that).  This is a very good beer and a great example of a Double IPA. It's just not the best one I've ever had. The flavor and aroma are very good, but it doesn't hide its alcohol well, and that hurt it some, in my opinion. Still a great example of the style, and I would suggest buying some if you get the chance. Recommended.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",Imperial IPA,98

Semi dry. Starts off with some carmel malt and brown sugar. Then hops explode, though not out of balance. Hops very piney with grapefruit and a pineapple note. Again, very clean finish with almost no perception of alcohol. Caremel malt comes ut as it warms and hops fade slightly.  D: Off the charts. You could down a sixer of this without even thinking. And then you'd be out of commision for a few days. This is the most drinkable 9% abv beer I've ever had.  Ovr: I'm a big fan of DIPA's. I love the carmel quality the malt and alcohol add to balance the hop attack. This beer is very straight ahead.

The bottle lists it at 10% ABV, so he's right on at least one part.  Poured an orange-amber color, with about a finger and a half of head that quickly dissipated. Intense smell of hops, very fresh and smells crisp.  The taste is of even more hops. VERY hoppy beer, probably the hoppiest beer I've had. Store guy is 2/2 now. Light citrus taste, but overpowered by the hops. Low to medium carbonation, very bitter, and I can taste the alcohol. Drinkability is alright, but definitely not something I could drink more than one of.  I'm not usually one for overly hoppy beers, but for what it is, this one is pretty decent.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",Imperial IPA,98
287,17112,Gehrig,4.97,"I broke down and coughed up the $14 for a sixer of this, and believe me, it's a steal. This beer is so incredibly good, it's rocketed to one of my top 3 DIPAs without question. This beer is incredible.  HopSlam pours a thin finger of off-white head on a clear burnt orange body with slight cloudiness. I'd normally lower the ""appearance"" rating for the thin head but, after a cursory glance at the lacing left on the glass, this beer indicates it has gravitas. Its might starts with the nose, which is just magestic. This might be the most citrusy DIPA I've ever had; it's oozing grapefruit and pineapple. Unbelievable!  So is the taste, an ideal blend of hops bite and citrus smoothness. While heavily hopped, this is easy on the taste buds, in no small part because of the ample citrus component, as well as the honey permeating the brew. Positively remarkable. This is so drinkable that I am fighting the urge to slam HopSlam. It's honestly not hard to imagine destroying a bottle of this in several minutes, though hardly advisable given its high ABV (9.3%). But it's just that delicious and smooth.  Just phenomenal, HopSlam is exhausting my cache of superlatives, a bolder presentation away from perfection in my esteem, and even that is somewhat cosmetic.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",Imperial IPA,98
287,17112,BoitSansSoif,4.5,"I'm a big fan. A-Poured a honey-amber with a nice, thick head.  S-Mango, hops, honey, hint of pine.  T-Mango, grapefruit, hops. The malts and hops are perfectly balanced throughout. This is one of the hoppiest brews I've had that still retained a nice bouquet of characters that balanced the bitterness with sweet, fruity nectar throughout the experience.  M-Nice consistency and body. The texture has the balls to carry this bold flavor, and the gallantry not to overshadow the finer details that make it special.  D-Top notch. This stuff was the hit at a tasting tonight where we experimented w/pairings. Try this stuff with some aged cheddar. Each one makes you want more of the other. You will get fat and drunk.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",Imperial IPA,98
287,17112,McDiddyPop,4.32,"Well, it finally happened. I cracked open my first HopSlam..  I had a 12oz bottle poured into my nifty Dogfish Head glass.  It poured a rich golden copper color with a thick massive head that slowly dwindled into a quarter-inch ring of foam with lacing all over the glass. It was a bit cloudy as well.  The smell was at first all hoppy bitterness, finished off by the sweet smell of malt and honey and a slight hint of the alcohol.  It was bitter from the start with a sweet finish. As I got closer to the end, the 10% alcohol became more apparent. This beer is delicious.  I will definitely be buying more of this soon. As I have a newly-realized love for hops, this ranks high on my list.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",Imperial IPA,98
287,17112,csmiley,4.42,"A - Pours copper with hints of gold. Ended up with a little less than one inch of white head. Retention was good. Lacing was also good.  S - Fruity hop aromas dominate (grapefruit and a sweeter fruit like kiwi). On the end there is an earthy aroma mixed with alcohol. Intense but not too powerful.  T - More fruity hops in the flavor. Sweet fruit falls away and citrus really stands out. Earthy flavors mix with sugar and honey mid sip. The distant background has a distinct bitterness and alcohol presence.  M - Medium bodied with good carbonation. Finish is bitter and dry. Smooth for a beer this big.  D - Drinkability is good. I am impressed with what they have done with this beer. The alcohol is hidden fairly well. If I could avoid passing out, I would definitely have several of these.

287,17112,stewart124,4.07,"Even with a slow pour this one has some considerable head. A white head sits atop this fairly blonde Double Imperial Pale Ale with very slight amber notes. The head doesn't last long but it leaves nice traces along the sides of the glass  Strong smells of sweet pineapple, grapefruit, and potent evergreen spices.  Very strong bitterness with a tart bite that finishes bone dry. Long lasting hoppiness but that is to be expected from something with the name of Hopslam.  Slight warming feeling from the high alcohol but I'm sure it is hard to hide the alcohol in this DIPA.  Nice mellow sweetness in this beer but the hops don't seem to balance with the malts. These strong pacific northwest hops really blast the taste buds! It is a delicious blend of hops and adds quite a hop character throughout the beer. I'd like to see it a bit maltier. I'd also like.

Huge hop aroma along with some fruit. I get strawberries for some reason. That's a first for me. There is a good amount of malt, but immediately the hops jump out at you. Long, lingering hop pucker. There is more fruit in the finish. Hops are slightly vegetal. Alcohol is warming.  A little over the top, but that is good sometimes!

I nice solid color for a DIPA; not too dark but not too light. a head that signals its hoppy nature. An explosion of flavor highlighted by the typical piney nature of an IPA but with a vibrant fruity taste. Four of these and I was inebriated! I had another IPA right before this and the stark difference was amazing. If you haven't had this beer....you have not had a Double IPA.,Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",Imperial IPA,98
287,17112,sweetkness,4.92,"A-Nice pale golden color, creamy head with nice lacing.  S-WOW, what an aroma! Hops, hops, and more hops. Fantastic citrusy aroma. Slight alcohol warmth in the background.  T-Perfectly balanced bitterness hits your tongue at first, followed by the same wonderful citrusy hop character in the flavor that was noticed in the aroma. Hop character finishes a little grassy. As much as the hops dominate, there is malt in there, giving the beer a nice sweetness to balance out the hop bitterness/flavor.  M-Just about perfectly carbonated, which is nice because it allows hop character to show through more. Good medium/full body.  D-This is one of those beers that could be classified as ""dangerously"" drinkable. I could easily put down six of these, which is rare for me and a beer of this strength. I have to try hard to hold myself to one (maybe two).",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",Imperial IPA,98

There is a bitterness I didn't like up front that was a little piney, but this brief taste is followed a very nice citrus and some sweetness finishing with a subtle bitter that is nice.

Tastes are sweet from the honey. Strong hop character; smokey hop flavors. Amazing DIPA! Great mouthfeel, smooth, and very palate pleasing, also a little creamy.

Not clear but not cloudy either. I likened it to apple juice. Not much head at all and it dissipated very quickly. The beer did not have much lacing either.  S - Smell is fantastic - very strong citrus smell, with some flowers.  T - A little sweet - then hops, hops, and more hops. A strong kick of bitterness in the back of the mouth after you swallow. As the beer warmed, that kick at the end was less apparent.  M - Almost creamy, but not thick. Lots of carbonation early, even prickly on the tongue, but by the end it was again not longer apparent too.  D - Found the beer to be more drinkable after it warmed a bit. I could have another, but no more than that in one sitting. I will seek this out every year it is released.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",Imperial IPA,98

The smell was mostly citrusy hops, but my smell is not refined enough to tell which. The taste was rather amazing. I expected this beer to be much hoppier than it seemed, but the hop flavor was indeed quite pronounced, and was balanced with a very sweet malt flavor. To contradict the reviewers below, it did indeed taste rather alcoholic to me, but then again, well, it is!

I traded for a sixpack of this and of Nugget Nectar, and while the Nectar was good I thought this blew it away. So friggin' delicious that I almost sucked the first on straight down.  Pours amber with a thin head but a constant stream of tiny bubbles. I'm not worried about a big head for a strong beer like this, I'm more concerned about what the beer tastes like and how fresh it is. This is one fresh beer! The smell is surprisingly malty and a tad sweet with big citrusy hops following. The taste is amazing! Delicious blend of citrusy and piney hops with a spicy oiliness that coats the tongue and has a flavor almost of cinnamon in its intensity. More pine, grapefruit, and orange follow. The sweet malt and honey play a supporting role that beautifully props up the hops, and there is almost a peach flavor at the end that makes me want to guzzle the beer. Great body, balance, and finish. I know this is 9.3% abv, but you can't tell. Something about this beer makes me want another and nothing else as soon as I finish the first, Uber delicious and almost addictive.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",Imperial IPA,98

Also detected a citrusy, flowery smell, but man those grapefruits!  Very smooth and drinkable, still more sweet grapefruit and flowery hops taste. I wouldn't put this beer at almost 10% ABV. It tastes strong but not from the alcohol. It's very well balanced.  I couldn't imagine drinking more than two of these and still be coherent.

Nice copper-amber color with a finger of white head on top that leaves a touch of lacing as the beer drains. Nose is incredible. Tons of piney hops hit you first, then a good bit of candy sweet malt as well. Unlike a lot of DIPAs, this one is definitely hop leaning; Bell's didn't seem to pour on the malt to balance it out, but really allowed the hops to dominate the flavor. But in a good way. Taste is amazing. Tons of piney hops again, some sweet caramel malt, grapefruit, and a touch of decidedly biting sweetness (some reviewers called it pineapple). The ABV is incredibly well hidden - not even noticeable in the least. Body is perfect for the style. Not syrupy, but thick and full bodied with perfect carbonation. Overall, an incredible beer. One of the best DIPAs I've had, along with Southern Tier's Unearthly Imperial IPA and Dogfish Head's 120 (which is a much sweeter beer).

Tons of intense, juicy fruit hop flavors with a moderate kick of bitterness. The 10% abv is very well hidden. Bittersweet finish with a lingering tropical fruitiness.  Mouthfeel: Medium-bodied.

Taste: Hops are extremely strong and bitter. They predominate, but citrus sweet flavors and a bit of caramel malts are noticeable. Alcohol blends very well and barely noticeable in taste. Nice, dry finish.  Mouthfeel/Drinkability: It's medium bodied and carbonation is very good. At nearly 10% abv, it's strong, but extremely smooth and drinkable.

Besides, I was a DIPA noob when I reviewed this three years ago. Proceed...  --- Original review 02-18-2008:  Pours a nice golden-orange color from the bottle, with a nice head which quickly dissipates.  Smells sour (in a good way) and citric, closely resembling lime. Also smells very grainy, likely from the hops. Very interesting & inviting.  The first taste is a powerful twang of grapefruit, with hops creeping in slowly but surely. I expected the hops to overwhelm the brew, but they merely make themselves the star with a solid backing by other fresh flavors.  Tho the head is not retained, it stays highly carbonated, and the extreme bite from the hops keeps the brew very lively in the mouth.  Despite not being the biggest hop fan, I found this surprisingly smooth & drinkable. The hops bounce off the tongue without killing you with their presence. I much prefer this hop-head beer to, for example, the Sierra Harvest Ale, which I found hard to drink.

I consider myself a big fan of super hoppy beers and figured that it was definitely worth a review.  It poured well into my crystal snifter a copper read with about an inch of foamy white head. There was evidence of lacing on the inside of the glass. The nose was sharp with an over-abundance of hops and citrus notes. The taste was bitter, but not over-whelming and sweet with the addition of honey. With an ABV of 10% this is definitely not a session beer, but more adequately a night cap.

Every little nuance is part of it's charm). The smell is VERY sweet and sour citrusy tang, one of those marihootchie strains that's got it's own name, a walk in a northern Michigan woods on a nice late spring day and a understated malt backbone. Upfront in the taste grapefruit. Before I go any farther if you don't like grapefruit-this isn't for you. Personally though, they're part of my breakfast at least twice a week so I'm right at home having this as the evenings night cap. That dry sour that gives you pucker power. There's definitely a combination of at least a few different hops given this a distinct character. Crisp with a nice medium body in the mouth. Leaves a slight sting on the tongue that lingers but down the throat is smooths all out with the honey and the malt giving a warm sweetness in the finish with a bit of alcohol burn to remind you that this is over 9% abv and 106 IBU's.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",Imperial IPA,98

A - Pale tangerine coloration which settled to a murky golden orangle with a slight glow. Thin head, decent retention and lacing. Looks like some sort of potion.  S - Gorgeous aroma of peaches, apricots, and hops. You could turn this into a perfume scent Bell's!  T - Addicting hop blast and I do mean addicting. Nice citrusy backing with tons of different fruit notes; apple, grape, peach, grapefruits, and probably more. All of this carries over into a sweet aftertaste. There is a good malt backbone but it doesn't (thankfully) interfere with the hop potency.  M - Warming full body, which is the only part of this brew that even hints to the abv, low carbonation level, dry finish, sweet aftertaste.  D - Anytime anywhere.

Maybe 29 is the year I get serious about type face reviews and no more scratchy notes.  This is a beautiful color, honey in a clear jar, the turbidity is aweinspiring. Topping in a nice lace, the aroma of the ripest yellow pineapple makes me think of an awsome spicy pulled pork sandwich I don't have.  It seems less intense than the five I had before it(as the weeks progressed)but bitter. I like the lasting smooth edge. It has a tidy an neat package in store; warm alcohol, sweet malt, and a nice blunt hop. It's a bit aggressive.

Hopslam is an exceptional beer, and one of the best, if not the best DIPA out there.  2008 batch, bottled, poured into a tulip.  Golden orange, with a thick bodied pour. 2 Finger, slightly quickly receding bright white head.  Smell is of piney, pineapple hops. Not a ton of grapefruit  Hugely complex DIPA with tons of hops holding through the entire drink. A slightly sweet finish is what lets you know the malts/honey existed in the brewing process. Piney refreshment! A big bodied, perfectly carbonated offering from Bell's.  Drinkabilty is THROUGH THE ROOF. Holy hell I could pound these if it weren't for the high, and unnoticeable ABV.

While being assaulted by pine needles, fruit and floral notes, a balancing clover honey malt bill does its best to reign in the hops. The aromatics are awesome and fill the atmosphere w/ hop aromas. Some light phenolic notes and tropical fruit as well.  M: Light-med. body, med. carbonation. A little slick, smooth and light, moreso than most DIPAs.  T: An initial burst of sweet honey malts hit the tip of the tongue along with biscuit. Then come the hops, and they are nicely, assertively hoppy.

From the smell, you expect to be overpowered with hops flavor, but it is surprisingly smooth and had a slight caramel taste.

I need to comapare this head to head with 90 minute IPA,Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",Imperial IPA,98
287,17112,srandycarter,4.5,"A -Pretty light honey copper with big head and coating persistent lacing.  S - HOPS, a bit skunky feel, thats about it. It's a good thing.  T- Says it is made with honey, but I don't taste it. Sweet malt up front, followed by domineering hops to a bitter, but balanced end.  M - Good coating, hitting all the buttons, good carb.  D - Thank god I don't have a chilled 6 pack of this one...LOL.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",Imperial IPA,98
287,17112,pacothrash,4.75,"This beer poured copper color with a .5"" head which thinned quickly. The smell is very nice with with fruitiness and some of alcohol. The taste is great with hints of grapefruit and orange. This is now my favorite high alcohol (10%) beer mainly because it hides the higher alcohol with the intense hop citrus flavor. This beer is very good!",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",Imperial IPA,98
287,17112,charlesw,3.74,"First off... A big thanks to, sigh. OK, fine. I mean, my name ends up in these, too, I guess. So thanks to spacecoyote for the bottle. There. I said it. Happy? And in the future I'll try to do better and acknowledge traders. Really. Honest. (No, this diatribe has nothing to do with spacecoyote - just with those who think it good to give credit for sources.)  Anyway, it's beer. It's decent beer, really. Pale color, good and lasting lacing, smells sweet and bitter. Tastes sweet and bitter but, well, frankly, not balanced. Way too sweet for way too little bitter. The too sweet then comes across as too thick for the carbonation level and all of that leads to low drinkability.  How is this different than the double bastard I had right before it? Well... The DB has more bitter to balance the sweetness. It also has a much much darker color. And the bitterness... Has a different quality to it. This one is like drinking fuggles. Which is fine, and all, but tastes like an IPA. The DB... Has a deeper feeling to it - more breadth and a better bitter quality. I guess... IMO... The DB comes across like an American barleywine should. This one comes across as an IPA.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",Imperial IPA,98
287,17112,deltatauhobbit,4.85,"Thanks to dyan for the trade and ncvbc for the extra.  Once again, my Bell's product has a different ABV. Bottle says 10% ABV (whoo! for once it's actually stronger, haha).  Pours a slightly hazy golden/orange color, not too much head, only a decent level but leaves some lacing.  Smell has a hop aroma for sure, but it is quite a bit sweeter smelling than I imagined, some sort of fruity aroma (possibly grapefruit?) accompanied with a very piney hop scent and citrus elements. Can't make out any of the honey that's mentioned though.  Taste has a good hop kick to it right off the bat that lingers and slowly changes to a slight sweetness, still can't make out any honey but it probably contributes to the balance at the end.  A very well balanced DIPA, I can't even make out that it's 10% alcohol, so that bodes quite well for this beer.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",Imperial IPA,98
287,17112,IPADAN,5,"12oz. bottle.  A - Amber/orange cloudy body with 1/2 inch white head that quickly diminished. Lots of lacings around the glass as you drink.  S - Smell is AMAZING!!! Amazing hop nose bursting with juicy citrus fruits (grapefruit and pineapple and pine needles?.  T - Sweet and citrusy up front, then a bit of honey flavor in the middle, then huge hop explosion at the end which is deliciously bitter.  M - Smooth, creamy texture with a medium bodied mouthfeel. Nice and hoppy.  D - Highly drinkable DIPA. Goes down very easy for 10%. Got to love Bells, got to love Hopslam. Can't find a single thing to fault. Favorite beer to date.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",Imperial IPA,98
287,17112,NCBeernut,4.81,"Light golden orange, not a huge head, but it leaves at least some lacing.  S: fruity with lots of citrusy hops, slightly piney.  T: Burst of fresh juicy strawberries, fruity esters, citrusy hops, and some lingering grapefruit. Definitely fruity, but also clean. Some piney flavors hang in the background. However, there is also a touch of honey-like sweetness, even though honey is highly fermentable and the attenuation on this beer is reaching 85% - the beauty of Hopslam. Fresh, the alcohol is almost undetecteable, but with a month or so it pokes its head out a little bit. Great amount carbonation, suprisingly smooth and creamy, but there is still a little bit of a bite, which I kind of enjoy.Definitely not a ""tongue bruiser.""

287,17112,sfoley333,4.3,Poured from 12oz bottle into a New Belgium snifter. Poured a golden color with orangish hue and foamy white head nice lacing. Smell is dominated by citrus and pine hint of pineapple. Taste is dominated by grapefruit with some pine resin but not as bitter as a lot of DIPA because of its sweet malt base. Mouthfeel is creamy and a low carbonation feel but still carbonated. A pretty drinkable double IPA.,Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",Imperial IPA,98

S - Hops hit the nose with a bit of honey sweetness in the background.  T - Juicy citrus explosion! I was tempted to wipe my chin as if I had just bit into a huge grapefruit! Pine overtones quickly fill in for the juiciness. Hops are out front on this one.  M - Velvety and creamy with little prickles of carbonation to the tongue. Very balanced on the exhale.  D - This is a remarkable brew. It's a shame it is a seasonal...umm...maybe it's a good thing as I would love to drink these often.

287,17112,marcpal,4.85,"Thank you monkeyknife for sending this one eastward.  12oz bottle poured into one of those fancy sam adams uber glasses.  A: Orange with running carbonation. Spidery, patchy lacing was stuck on the glass after the initial inch or so of head.  S: Not sure if the sams glass actually pronouced the aroma more but man it is pure bitter hops. Sweet citrus fruits, grapefruit mainly, and the malty sugar/honey balance for the alcohol fitting.  T: Nothing short of great. There arent many beers out there like this one. nothing short of wow! True feat of balance.  M: Nice mouthfeel that drops the oil texture right away and knocks you out from really wanting anything else to follow this one up. Leaves a zing on the tongue and the throat in a good way.  D: Doesnt get much better than this for a hophead. Truly delicious and unbelieveably drinkable with the hidden abv for the most part. As much as I was a bit let down by the wallop, this one was all the bells and whistles it was played up to be.  Im eager as hell to get my hands on some more of these bad boys.

Head isn't very large but there is already lace reaching to the top of my glass, not to mention the big yummy bubbles. Aroma is packed full of sweet candy orange-tangerine, creamy peaches, apricots, sweet berries/soft aromatic flowers....dank. Taste is a pile of happy hoppy. Mmmmm. Candy-like, not cloying, fresh and fruity with just the right amount of bitterness. Malts have a presence but the hops are certainly at the front. Nice smooth, grainy/resiny texture are quite nice.

Pours a surprisingly pale amber .. almost as much yellow as orange. Big white foam head settled down quickly to a thin crust. Superb mouthfeel: oily, viscous, and perfect. Smells like grapefruit and a hint of pine; no real malt or tropical fruit in the smell.  Taste is abundantly rich with grapefruity and piney hops, some caramel malt sweetness, and something a bit more tropically sweet. Just an absolutely superb DIPA.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",Imperial IPA,98
287,17112,jwc215,4.41,"Thanks to Wasatch for this one...  Pours clouded amber with a thin white head.  The smell is of - well - plenty of hops - Pacific NW hops dominate - a plethora of citrus/grapefruit with resiny pine and some tea-leaf. A touch of caramel indicates that this is going to be a super-hoppy beer with some balance. This is what an Imp. IPA should smell like!  The taste holds true to the smell with alcohol mixing in. Bitterness tackles the palate with just a hint of rounding caramelish malt and honey sweetness . Alcohol interferes just slightly - if it were even a tad bit tamer - this would be a perfect ""5"" in my book. As it is, though, I'm far from complaining about. This is just loaded with hops, but with a nod from the malt to keep things together.  Medium-bodied with alcohol sharpness, it could be a bit chewier/fuller, but, again, no complaints. It holds up just fine, though alcohol washes out some of the aftertaste.  This puckering brew is bold and daring. The alcohol makes itself known, but still holds up on drinkability for the sheer pleasure of it all. A hop-head's delight!",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",Imperial IPA,98
287,17112,dondeez21,4.53,I traveled nearly 200 miles round trip for a case of this beer. Overall I feel the trip was worth every second. Hopslam has an aroma that is compared to none. IT packs a nice punch but at the same time it has an equal hop/malt profile. One sip is not enough. Enjoy!!!,Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",Imperial IPA,98
287,17112,jeonseh,4.6,"Finally caved in and bought some. I actually broke my promise not to buy anymore beer for awhile until I bought this one. The big sign at the liquor store saying Yes, we have hopslam was too much for me.  A - Really a beautiful beer to look at as it sits in my goose island tlip glass. Color is a clear golden orange that has a nice sheen to it that makes it rather attractive to look at. When i first poured i, it has a huge foamy, fluffy head that made this beer rather beautiful but have to take away a half of a point because it faded away kinda quick and did not leave the kind of lacing that I expected.  S - Smell is a lot of the bitter hops which i found rather surprising. Also thought the fruity aspect tended more towards the grapefruit line of fruit also with a bit of lemon in there as well. There iis also a slight mixture of sweeter mango flavors as well which is typical given a DIPA and its big malt background.  T - now this is one heck of a beer. it is a nice mixture of sweet and hops but on the whole the hops dominate. The mango, sweet fruit flavors are there but they are more of a compliment to keep the hops from being overpowering. Leaves a nice bitter aftertaste in the mouth that just lingers and you can feel it just attacking your taste buds. will definitely need to refresh before drinking something else especially if I want to really taste it. Have to say they also do a very good job at hiding the alcohol in this one as you can't even taste it's existence.  MF - a nice mixture of carbonation and cloying sweetness that mixes in well with the flavor profile of the beer. it is not to thick for this type of beer and I hope how the carbonation goes well with the hoppy flavor of this one and just like how the hop flavor sticks around so does the carbonation. After drinking one is left with a slight tingly feeling in the mouth.  D - really one of the better DIPAs I've ever had and especially drinkable given the price for the style. Definitely a beer worth 14 bucks a six pack and like having one of this style in a small bottle since I don't have to think hard about whether I want to drink a whole bomber or not. Really a beer I would reach more over and over again and thinking maybe I should have bought a whole case if I didn't have so much beer already. If you can find some definitely worth picking up a sixer and enjoying it as soon as possible so that you get the full hop profile.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",Imperial IPA,98
287,17112,association330,4.33,"A - Pours a orange-golden color with a light-golden, two-finger head that fades to a cap and leaves nice rings of lacing around the glass.  S - Citrus (mostly grapefruit) and pine. A little alcohol, which is to be expected given the 10% ABV.  T - Grapefruit, with a bit of a pine finish. Given the name, I was expecting an extremely bitter hops profile, but it is incredibly well-balanced with just the right level on the finish. Alcoholic burn is well-hidden, and you are left with only a nice warming effect.  M - Oily and moderate. Perfect amount of carbonation.  D - ABV is high, so I knocked off half a point, but these are so perfectly balanced, I could easily drink a few of them.  Probably the best IPA/DIPA I've had the pleasure of trying.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",Imperial IPA,98
287,17112,dsigmon,4,"I was not sure of all the hype when I was luckily able to try this on tap. This definitely did not dissapoint.  A: Poured ruby orange (low lit bar) with perfect hazy white head. Lacing was very apparent after each sip.  S: Very fruity/pine scent up front, sweet honey and fruit cake like aroma to follow.  T: This guy hit the spot..then so did the next, then the third. Starts off with a the hoppy fruit and dissapates into the yummy sweet but not too sweet fruit cake in the smell. Ends with the honey and malts balanced with the pine/fruit.  M: This was bar none the best mouthfeel of an IPA I have ever experienced...atleast that I can remember to this point. Very oily and thick in the mouth with the perfect amount of carbonation so as not to induce a large belch after each sip but not flat, just perfect.  D: Top notch. I was exposed to many differnt options of amazing beer on tap and could not leave this one.

287,17112,ShiftyCapone,4.92,"I've often walked right past this beer at my local beer store. For some reason I blindly thought that this beer wouldn't really be worth a try. Well, was I pleasantly surprised when I had a chance to sample this beer on tap at Ashley's in Westland.  After ordering a Dogfish Head 90-minute IPA, the waitress suggested we try a Bell's Hopslam. Being someone who wouldn't imagine passing up a chance at a free beer sample, I politely agreed.  This beer has a fairly cloudy golden-yellow look to it. Head was minimal to non-existant. Aroma was very strong and hop flavors were very well pronounced. Ended up finishing off 4 pints of this and didn't regret it one bit. Each sip was as good as the last. And with a 10% abv, I sure was glad I had a DD...  *note* Have not tried this beer out of a bottle yet.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",Imperial IPA,98

Good lacing.  S - Very hoppy aroma. Citrus/grapefruit aromas are dominant. Some spruce at the end also.very nice clean smell  T - Citrus hop flavors are the showcase. There is some pine with a slight sweetness,like honey I guess. Wonderful hop flavor. Big flavor with no overpowering bitterness of other DIPAs. M -Very thick almost oily from the hops.

Taste is incredible. Huge hop flavor, with a big grapefruity citrus taking the lead. Also a nice caramel sweetness. Only slightly bitter.  Mouthfeel is medium to full bodied with perfect carbonation.  Drinkability is great for such high alcohol. Alcohol is hidden well, flavors are great and mouthfeel just bumps it that much further. An incredibly drinkable double IPA.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",Imperial IPA,98
287,17112,elmore,4.37,"Picked this up as a single from a Wild Oats Market. Labeled at 10% ABV. Poured a golden orange into a tulip. A 1 finger off-white head with great retention. Carbonation is moderately active. Decent amount of thick lace left on the glass.  Smells of piney, citrusy hops with a bit of sweetness.  Great hops profile. Not nearly as bitter as I expected (for 109 IBU). Hops impart a primarily citrus taste. Definitely grapefruit. A clean aftertaste - bitterness stays around, but doesn't linger excessively. Malt is subdued, but slightly sweet. Bottle claims it is brewed with honey, but I don't specifically taste this, but there definitely is a sweetness.  Somewhat thick with oily hops presence. Moderate carbonation. Alcohol not apparent in the taste. Doesn't have the usual warming effect of a 10% ABV brew IMO.  Great DIPA. Will probably pick up a 6 pack of this.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",Imperial IPA,98
287,17112,Proteus93,4.6,"A: Clean, golden/amber pour with a rich and foamy pale orange head.  S: A lot of citrus hops, predominantly grapefruit. Sweet aromas, like other soft fruits or floral scents.  T: A huge hops flavour, a lot of evergreen taste that doesn't come out so much in the smell. Citrus notes, and a dash of sweetness, presumably from the honey comes through.  M & D: Thick and slick... quite an oily consistency that leaves its residue like a thin film before slipping into a clean finish. Makes it very easy to drink, but the alcohol is amazingly well hidden, so restraint needs to be exercised to avoid getting clobbered by it. Respect it, and it will treat you very well.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",Imperial IPA,98

Fairly one dimensional, but very nice regardless.  T - Citrus hop flavors are the showcase. There is some pine with a nice sweetness, from the honey I would guess. Wonderful hop flavor. Big flavor withouth the overpowering bitterness of other DIPAs. Good malt backbone but the highlight is the hops.  M - Sticky/oily from the big hops. Good body with a nice alcohol warmth.  D - The most drikable DIPA I have ever had. Big alcohol which is hard to even detect, so you couldn't have too many.  Overall, this is one of the best DIPAs I have had.

M - Nice and smooth, like a marble at first, then some sharpness from the carbonation. A little bit of puckering.  D - A very good double IPA, but I wouldn't want to drink this all the time, as it is a bit much.

287,17112,Duffman,4.72,"On tap at grumpy's.  Pours a beautiful and complex peachy hue into a pint glass.  An amazing bouquet of scents--incredibly fruity and floral. Citrusy, grapefruit most of all. Fresh flowers and the faintest wiff of sweet pine. One of the more complex and refreshing aromas of any beer, or scotch, I have ever had the pleasure of drinking.  Brilliant taste, once again the citrus comes to the forefront, and delightfully so. Grapefruit, even the subtle medicinal taste of airborne grapefruit cold dissolvable tablets. Only the faintest taste of alcohol.  Enchanting mouthfeel, a medium-light body with a subtle firm dryness and bitterness to it.  Incredibly drinkable, especially for a 9.3 percent brew. The alcohol is an afterthought: the taste, mouthfeel and resfreshing experience beckon for more. Truly an exceptional Imperial IPA and another fine effort from the folks at Bells.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",Imperial IPA,98
287,17112,JayQue,4.5,"Another great beer from Bells. Pours a slightly hazy orange color with a medium white head. Average head retention / good lacing. Smell is awesome. Floral hops and citrusy. Taste is great. This is the hophead's version of balanced: piney hops, citrusy hops and floral hops. None of the flavors are over the top and there is no hint of the alcohol (the bottle says 10%).  Mouthfeel is rich and crisp - no harshness and the bitterness is well within the hophead range. Drinkability is good for a beer of this strength. The effect would be the only drawback to having a few.  I will be getting more of next year's version!!!",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",Imperial IPA,98

Smell - Honey-like sweetness mixed with pungent, boozy tropical fruit and citrus.  Taste and mouthfeel - Very balanced and actually fairly sweet, especially compared to the West Coast IPAs I'm used to. Medium-bodied. I wouldn't have thought to add honey to an IPA, but it actually works wonderfully; the subtle sweetness of the honey blends perfectly with the grapefruit-like bitterness from the hops. Bittering hops appear more in the finish, coating the palate but not entirely overpowering the malt. A hint of alcohol is present as well, reminding me that this is strong stuff.  Notes - I find it very hard to fault this beer in any way. Exceptional stuff.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",Imperial IPA,98

S-Amazing smell to this beer with hints of pineapple, apricot, brown sugar and grapefruit. T-Faint notes of buttery brown sugar and honey-caramel that are quickly and absolutely crushed by a wave of pineapple, pine resin, mango, apricot and a finishing assault of dry grapefruit pith. M-Nicely carbonated with a medium body that coats the mouth but isn't too thick. D-When something is this delicious, it's all too easy to drink a couple but with this ABV you'd pay the price...

287,17112,jbphoto88,4.97,"Poured into a wide mouth mug to maximize the scent. Appearance is a nice honey color with a soft head that fades quickly leaving some delicate lacing on the edge of the glass.  The smell to me is nothing short of exceptional. It is of sweet citrus grapefruits, glorious hops and even a little honey. The honey might be all in my head because I accidently read on the bottle that it is ale with honey. Once seen its hard for me to not think about it.  Taste is amazing. It starts out like the best grapefruit I've ever had and quickly moves into lovely malts and a super hop finish. A nice above average bitterness that totally makes this beer. Mouthfeel is a smooth and silky with that honey rearing its head again. Tastes like there is just enough to smooth out the bitterness in from the hops. I can compare it to grandma adding some sugar to her spaghetti sauce thus cutting the bitterness.  This is now my new favorite beer. So sad I only have three from a trade and none to buy.

Pine tree and newly cut grass. Incredibly good smell. The flavor is reminiscent of dipping a cluster of hop cones in a jar of honey and sticking it in your mouth. Absolutely great taste, intense without being too much. Very sweet and very hoppy with great balance. Mellow and smooth especially considering the hop presence. Good coating and slick on the tongue.

A: It pours a nice rich golden color, with a fairly larger head than most other Imperial IPA's that Ive had.  S: Immediate hop blast right through your senses. Will wake you up if you are have asleep thats for sure.  T: Very bitter, but in a good way. Doesnt seem as sweet as DFH 90 Min. After a few bottles, it seems to destroy your palate, here the next morning I still don't have much left on the old tongue. Slight notes of grapefruit and honey hit the back of your tongue.  M: See Above  D: For 10% ABV, its highly drinkable. However as I said above, the hops overload prevents this from being more than two pints or bottles at a time.  One of my favorite releases. The first time I had it was on draft, but this review was from this years release in a bottle poured into a pilsner glass. Im a hophead, so I am a tad biased. Very well done for a DIPA, so you match this up with Two-Hearted and Bell's could go toe to toe with Dogfish Head for my favorite IPAs.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",Imperial IPA,98

This beer really lives up to the Bells reputation. The taste is exceptional and it goes down smooth. There aren't a lot of bubbles, but what there are tickles the tongue. It's flavor is of course hoppy (is that a word?) and a little like pine with an aftertaste similar to grapefruit.

Some small bubble floating around. Head goes away quickly.  S- Piney and Citrus hops big time! Smells like I'm sitting in the woods near a Pine tree. Exceptional!  T- Sweet, citrus, piney and finishes with some heat. Certainly warms the body on this raw/rainy night. Pine gets a little stronger as it warms. Just down right tasty!  M- Thick and full bodied. Mild carbonation gets lost in its warmth.  D- No doubt about it, this is a big beer. I put this up there with Double Simcoe, Pliney, and Hop Wallop. Perfect for a winter release.

287,17112,rodrot,4.42,"I'd been wondering when this beer was going to make it to NC and it finally did. It poured a bright gold color with a small head that stuck around. Aroma was hops, hops and more hops. This is a hophead's dream come true. I could pick up a good bit pf pine, citrus and even a hint of mango in the aroma as well. Taste was bitter up front with some alcoholic warmth mixed in. The finish was also bitter. The sweetness of the malt was there, but the high level of hop bitterness overwhelmed it at every turn, which was fine with me. Mouthfeel was light to medium. Drinkability was excellent, however, non-hopheads would probably find this beer undrinkable. Anyone who favors Double IPA's should seek this one out.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",Imperial IPA,98
287,17112,wedge,4.67,"Clear, thick orange color with a creamy sheet of a head; sticky bubbles making a ring around the edges and leaving some drippy lacing. The aroma is bursting with pungent citrus, peach, and tropically fruity hops. Some sweetness, pine sap, sugar cookies, and stinky weed. Citrus, peach, and apricot continue in the flavor, but in a very fresh, real fruit kind of way. A nice sweetness in the middle compliments the citrus perfectly, finishing with some orange rind. Its all fresh, oily hop juice...and its delicious. There's a little warmth in the throat, but this is very easy to drink for its ABV. Bitter, though not obscenely so, medium-plus body and smooth. Surprisingly drinkable.  Mmmm...freshly squeezed hop juice.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",Imperial IPA,98
287,17112,RblWthACoz,4.15,"Pours a murky orange with a decent off white head. Nose is strong citrus hops. Flavor is so much grapefruit, it took me back a bit. Those thick citrus flavors are combined with firm hop tones. Feel is smooth on liquid and carbonation and it goes down easy. Nice to drink, though the citrus is a bit high. I am not sure if I remember it being like this when I had it on bottles a while ago.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",Imperial IPA,98
287,17112,cokes,4.97,"De-bottles a lightly smoky golden amber stacked with a wet and sticky mess of ivory suds. Octopus tentacles of gooey, pink grapefruit and apricots writhe their way up the nose and slap a suction cup right on the pleasure receptor. There are backing pine resin, ganja, and metallic grassy hop traits. But purely and simply, this is loud hop fruit-juice, and beyond delicious. I can think of more complex smelling beers, but not a better smelling one. Malt is laid down first inside the mouth with honey and graham crackers and pear jelly. That's all quickly dismantled as a twinge of vanilla precedes a sticky hop bath. All those apricot and pink grapefruit juices form the nose follow-through tastewise. But here, larger roles are given to the smoky rasta vapors, pine tar, lime peels, quinine, and juniper. These last things mingle with a partially cloaked ABV to give it a decided gin and tonic impression on the swallow. But those juicy fruited hops still linger over everything, and will for quite some time. Oily bodied but its heft is masked with a persistent trickling CO2. It's also worth noting the this is the least yeasty Bells I can recall, and that's a good thing, especially here. This is simply gulpable, and I have had to slow myself down every single time I've drank it. It's almost straightforward and simple in a way, but when everything is this right, I can't see how a Double IPA could get any better.  Note as of 5/9/08: Get this as fresh as you possibly can. There is some notable atrophy in the hop zestiness even after 3 -4 months. It's still a killer, but it has fallen off a step.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",Imperial IPA,98
287,17112,OWSLEY069,4.33,"Pours a clean orange-ish/ yellow color with a white head. In the aroma, a mixture of pine and citrusy hops. In the taste, primarily piney hops and just a hint of citrusy hops. A small bite, yet a mostly smooth mouthfeel, and a dry piney hop aftertaste. Big on piney hops and actually not as bitter as anticipated. Hides the alcohol and very, very good.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",Imperial IPA,98

Tongue: Some sweet malt that carries thru and is a nice vessel for the onslaught of hops that is primarialy flavor vs. bitter. Perhaps the spicey dinner I had affected that perception.  Texture: Full bodied...oily from the hops. A nice velvety roll over the tongue.  Overall experience: It's a nice treat. It's a simple concept beer. One done well.

287,17112,hellcatsjg,4.55,"Appearance: Dark golden/amber brew with a finger of head that quickly disappears. Decent amount of lacing as you go.  Smell: Citrus and grapefruit hop aromas are front and center here. Not complex but very nice and strong.  Taste: Citrus hops up front in a big way with a bit of spices present. Hop character then becomes somewhat piney while a sweetness creeps in thanks to the honey. Mouth is left with a very nice combo of those flavors at the end. Very nice. Important to note that while very hoppy, the flavor is complex and balanced and not obnoxious and one dimensional like some DIPAs can be.  Mouthfeel: Nice and sticky but smooth and easy to drink at the same time. Definitely more of a sipping beer but not because it is too strong, which is a problem with some big beers. Nice warmth is present as well thanks to the 10% ABV.  Drinkability: Very high. This is one of the best DIPA's I have had. Very strong and tasty but very easy to drink at the same time.

287,17112,dreadnatty08,4.72,"Batch 8283 Pours a medium amber color with some lighter highlights; just a tad hazy with a slim amount of huge bubbled head. Aroma is just out of this world, how the hell do they get this many hops in it? A complex range of everything from lemon, oregano, sage, rose, a little pine, just all over the place. Basically no malt in the aroma, but who cares, this one is about the hops! On the palate it just explodes. The bitterness of the hops is really explosive, there's just enough malty sweetness to keep it from being a real bruiser. The alcohol is quite noticeable, and it also enhances the bitterness. Carbonation is appropriate, and there is no slickness in this brew, body is rather low, a bit over attenuated perhaps?

Color is a slightly hazy apricot golden orange. Nice bright color.  As soon as the cap is popped, the citrus smell erupts from the bottle. It has a sweet citrus smell like grapefruits mixed with tangerines. The pour lets the smell explode. there is a sweet flowery and almost sugary smell blended in the background. Taste is strong with the grapefruit, but theere is a pine resin bitterness present. Still sweet and flowery. The label says it will bruise your tongue, but I guess I like this kind of abuse.  The mouthfeel is very smooth for a DIPA. A lot are very raw and harsh. This is almost too easy to drink, and at 10% I was done for the night after two.

Sometimes greed is permissable. So, how is the 'o8 batch? Let's begin. Pours burnt gold into the chalice. The head, while it is there, serves as a nice marshmallow contrast to the rich hues of the beer's body. Immeadiately I can smell this sucka'. A good foot and a half and it is still unmistakable and plain as day. Yup, this is the Hopslam I remember. Deep floral aromatics with a sweet underpining of succulant malt. And yeah, even the honey notes dance around. Ugh, just delicious. And I haven't even tasted it yet. Wow, the hops literally race all around the perimeter of the tongue with spicy, resinous pitchforks, prodding at the sides and back of my buds while the heavy malt body cooly slides down the middle of the mouth. The balance on this bottle of jet fuel is stunning. It's drinkability is surely many a mother's ruin. THough a raging 10% a.b.v. it is nowhere to be found. Mmmmm, must buy more. I wonder how much blood I need to sell on a weekly basis to keep this in the fridge while supplies last? If you just skipped down to the end of this review, the bottom line is this is GOOD.

Pours a slightly cloudy orange amber color with a thick and creamy two inches of light beige head. Retains a thin lace and leaves a good amount of stick on the sides.  Smell is very fruity and sweet, with notes lots of citrus, some peach, maybe some pineapple, pine, and some honey sweetness.  Taste is quite fruity, as well, with lots of citrusy hop flavor, some pine, a honey and malt sweetness that gives some pretty good balance, and then substantial but not overpowering bitterness. Alcohol is apparent but doesn't detract, although there is a slight harshness to the mouthfeel that takes away just a tad. Nice and slick hefty medium body otherwise.  This is a damn fine beer.

287,17112,letsgopens,4.92,"This huge Imperial IPA pours a rich orange amber color with a steady stream of fine carbonation rising from the heart of the brew. The super frothy, almost creamy off-white head refuses to recede and leaves some towering walls of uniform lace. What an attractive brew!  Unbelievable. One of the most amazing smelling brews I've ever had the pleasure of experiencing. Lush tropical fruit: tons of pineapple, ruby red grapefruit, sweet/tangy tangerine, and all types of citrus hop character. A bit floral and bitter sweet. Some mild, sweet malt but mostly just overwhelmingly appetizing citrus hops. I wish I could somehow have this smell surgically implanted in my brain forever. Ridiculously aromatic to say the least. Ugh...  The flavor does not disappoint either. Tons of massive citrus hop flavor. Super fruity with more tropical fruit: pineapple, tangerine, and grapefruit. Bitter and mouthwatering with juicy, floral hops and a sweet honey character. Just a hint of booze warmth despite the higher abv. Bright and indulgent. Very few beers I've had celebrate those beloved little green cones as well as this one does. The lingering bitterness just doesn't give up. Absolutely delicious.  Smooth, velvety and thick with moderate but super fine carbonation. Bright yet creamy mouthfeel. The tang of citrus accompanies the semidry bitter hops insanely well. I feel like I'm understating how amazing the mouthfeel is as well.  The best citrus oriented hop brew out there in my opinion and one of the best overall beers as well. I look forward to this stuff coming out every year with a feverish enthusiasm. One of the best beers out there period. If you've never tried it, make it a point to buy/trade for it ASAP.

Bitter hops in the aroma promise that this beer will live up to its name, and the flavor doesn't disappoint. This is one shredder of a beer. Bitter piney and citrus hop bite with a plenty of sweet malt and honey to provide a good balance. Before my palate had evolved, I would have found this beer to be too hoppy. Now I think it's just fine, a beautiful example of a DIPA. Two Hearted Ale on steroids wouldn't be a bad description, but this beer is all its own. This is the best DIPA I have ever tasted. Mouthfeel is just right, some coating of the tongue with hop oils hanging around for a good while. Very easy to drink, but I doubt I could do more than two of these in a session. The alcohol is not obvious at all. Another wonderful beer from Bell's.

The body is clear and pale orange in color, with rising traces of bubbles. Foam slowly recedes to a bone-colored, thin layer and the lacing is good. The aroma is one of the best you'll find in a IIPA: pungent/abundant hops bring floral, pine, grapefruit, and kief notes balanced with a delicate, sweet backbone of honey malts. Flat-out perfect in my book.  The flavor doesn't disappoint, either. Sticky, bitterly sharp hops coat the mouth and deliver a puckering blow to the back of the palate. Mouthfeel is perfectly carbonated and heavy, but not so thick or viscious that it's hard to consume or stomach. The bitter finish is the bread-winner here -- this is what hop-lovers crave. (Oh man, even my burps smell good...nice and hoppy.) The alcohol pairs well with the greenery to give the aftertaste a memorable bite. Although I had no qualms about paying $11.99 for a six pack of Hopslam, a little voice in the back of my mind had its doubts about the hype.

The citrus-like hops are amazing. There is a nice subtle biscuity and buttery aroma in there too, but when you put your nose all the way down in the glass, you get the alcohol warming all the way in the nose and down to the chest.  T- Nice sweet honey taste with the hops beating down the door! Very citrusy and fruity. Sweet tastes initally, but bitter on the end. Perfect!  M- High on carbonation and medium mouthfeel.  D- Very high for a high ABV brew.  Overall- Unreal. I actually think this has cracked into my top 5 (top 2?!?). It is amazing that the sweetness mixes so well with the bitter hops. It is usually one way or the exact opposite. I loved it, but it is a shame that I cannot buy it here.

287,17112,udubdawg,3.95,"12 oz bottle, batch 8283  Decanted as instructed on the bottle, the pour is a light coppery orange, quite clear, with three quarters of an inch of off-white foam. Lacing is decent. I've seen better lacing from this beer, but only when warmer, and from experience I like this one a little colder than the 50-55F serving temperature listed on this site. An uneven cap remains for most of the glass.  The nose isn't my favorite, but it is excellent nonetheless, and keeping to style I'd call it the quintessential DIPA. It is hard to believe after sniffing this beer that I haven't dipped my nose in a vat of various oily citrusy hop juices. (wow, that doesn't sound half bad - bucket list is filling up!) I can't say that the ample malt backbone or the honey show up here, but again this is at about 45 degrees.  Fairly tasty beer. Again glad that I chilled this one in the regular fridge. I had this at 60-65 degrees the other day to confirm my previous thoughts - when warm the sweet malt, honey, and alcohol make for a really full, sticky, hot, nearly hard-to-drink beverage, with the ample bitterness not blending well but showing up in strange fashion in the finish. Yeah, I think I'll make sure I've got these pretty cool from now on. (If you like this at 55 degrees, great - to each their own) Anyway, when a little cooler the hops shine brightly, citrusy with a little pine. The malt is restrained (in fact the entire body seems a bit thinner), the alcohol beaten into near invisibility by the hop profile, and the honey a vague pleasant sweetness. The overall bitterness isn't TOO high, and lingers at a pleasant level. A hop-head delight!  The body is full and a bit sticky. Appropriate carbonation, and very drinkable for the strength. Perhaps it is because of experience with this beer, but I find myself usually only having one. Maybe I am subconsciously trying to help out the hop shortage, as I could easily see myself having another one or two of these before losing my ability to type. Highly recommended.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",Imperial IPA,98
287,17112,blackie,4.49,"a: Pours a moderate off-white head with modest retention. The beer is a bright copper-amber in color.  s: Sweet, dripping Centennial? hops comprise the bulk of the nose, and bring aromas of a wide range of cut tropical fruits (mango, grapefruit, big passionfruit, cotton candy...). Nice, sweet ethanol spice. Clean grain sweetness gives notes of light caramel. Like sticking your head in a barrel of whole leaf hops. Comparisons to a kicked-up Two Hearted ring true.  m: Medium, smooth carbonation with a slightly slick medium-full body.  t: Bursting with juicy, fresh tropical hops with a body of clean light caramel malts with a medium-high sweetness. Medium-high bitterness in the finish along with some grain husk notes. Not too much alcohol heat, but I certainly feel the effects pretty quickly. Would benefit from some more range in the malt flavor, which imo would accentuate the huge hopping a bit more.

Clean finish, with a bit of citrus after taste. Not an overwhelming punch like other IIPA, but very tasty. Feel is good, not to thick, not thin, just about right. I like them a little thicker, but that is personal preferance.  Yes this is a good beer. This worth buying a sixer if you are a singles buyer.

I wasn't sure if I was drinking a beer or grapefruit juice until the 9.5% alcohol crept up.  I do like this beer, It hits the spot if you have a hop craving, but in truth it is not that much of a brewing accomplishment if you ask me, very one-dimensional, and for the price there are better DIPAs out there.

The taste is awesome as well. I feel like I'm hit over the head w/ hops. This beer is bitter, but not too bitter. The aroma and flavoring hops seem to predominate. Very citrusy and fruity flavors here. I'm amazed at what this little flower can do. My only problem is the lack of malts. THey are there, but just not as present as I would like. The mouthfeel is nice, but a little thinner than I would expect for a DIPA.  Overall, an outstanding beer. It's positives are the strong aromas and fabulous hoppy flavors.

This one has that wonderful aroma of light and sweet grapefruit captured for sure with just a light and hot streak of alcohol running through it.  This one hits that mouth with but an instant of light sweetness and heads right down the path to hoppiness. A quick twang that expands very quickly and slowly thins out to but a dry bitterness - into cottonmouth for sure. A bit of alcohol shines through here and there that makes this one a bit hot to an extent - but highly drinkable for the ABV with a light-moderate body.

287,17112,grandq,3.97,"Popping the top - grapefruit, pine and canteloupe. I'm used to the other scents but canteloupe is a new one. This pours a shade of amber I associate with the containment of prehistoric bugs. The taste is heavy on the grapefruit - and I like that end of the DIPA spectrum - with plenty of apricot, orange peel and a nice hot spicy background that reminds of Belgian IPA's. Not much of a malty body to start, but becomes a bit more prominent as this warms up and helps prop up the fruity bitterness. This finishes a bit dry for my liking and is a little lacking in layers. It's also a little medicinal on the very tail end, which is unfortunately what lingers. Even so, I keep coming back for another smell and sip. And another. If it weren't for the slightly unpleasant notes creeping in at the 11th hour, this might be toward the top of my DIPA list.

287,17112,Phocion,4.5,"A local bar got a case of this stuff in last night and since I haven't been able to find it anywhere else I decided to try a bottle. Expertly poured by the bartender into a Unibroue tulip. Bright cloudy orangish-tangerine color with a massive white head that took its time to fade away into a thin crown that stayed until the last sip.  Massive nose that wasn't as bitter as I had expected, but nonetheless was very pleasant. Definite billing of citric hops; thick fruity aromas such as apricot, peaches, oranges, grapefruit, and pineapple with a tiny hint of pine as well. Nice malt base for the balance; caramel and honey.  Very bittersweet flavor from the citric fruit-salad with just a touch of sweet malts to keep them in check. Very dry finish.  Excellent carbonation and definitely quite a bit of body to this one. Strangely I have never had a beer that could feel so creamy yet so dry and crisp at the same time. For a DIPA approaching 10% I had absolutely no problems finishing this and the only reason I decided on a Two-Hearted afterwards was that I still had to drive home.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",Imperial IPA,98
287,17112,Lordsloth,3.65,"Poured from a 12 oz bottle.  Appearance was a slightly cloudy orange/amber, with a finger-high white head which hung around for a few minutes. Smell is good- fruity, hop-filled nose. Taste suprised me a bit, didn't seem like a strong Imperial-style IPA- maybe the honey sweetness hid some of the hop bite? Mouthfeel smooth, a bit oily. Balanced. Drinkability is all right, but something about the taste threw me off, maybe the honey.  Apparently, I didn't like it as much as most. Still a tasty beer.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",Imperial IPA,98
287,17112,genog,4.59,"12 oz glass served at mad mex.  Arrived in a tumbler style glass with very little white head resting on top. Burnt orange color that is a little cloudy. Aroma is pure hoppy goodness. Plenty of citrus with grapefruit punching my nostrils followed by a little pineapple and mango, with maybe a little of pine, spicy hops. Taste is extremely balanced. I get a bitter aftertaste but that is first met with a strong malty sweetness. Moutfeeling is just right for this style. Not a lot of carbonation, but not flat at all. Had this beer with some spicy wings, it was perfect.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",Imperial IPA,98
287,17112,bobhits,4.38,"Appearance. Nice orangy cloudy color. I poured to quickly but it's got a nice thick off white head and leaves a nice lacing on the glass.  Smell. Wow...this stuff is strong! Often I only can smell a beer the first few times I take a sniff, but this stuff is POWERFUL. I have a very fruity smell. Perhaps orange and grapefruit?  Taste. The first taste I got just seemed weak. Not really sure why, but definitely bitter and hoppy. The second taste really brought out the hops. It's got that grapefruit flavor that hop heads seem to debate over. Personally, not for me in general though this beer has something else going on there that makes it enjoyable as opposed to be just drinkable. There doesn't seem to be much of a malt back to this. There is a nice sweet start to it, but it doesn't last long and isn't very strong. It might be the honey but it seems to have a bit of an orange flavor in there which is probably why I like this more than other grapefruity beers. Mouthfeel. Without much malt backing it's somewhat weak in that department. I like my double IPA's oily and almost sticky with the hops. This fall a little short in that area. It could also be the alchol slipping through that adds a bit of roughness to this other wise solid mouthfeel.  Edit a few years later. This one grows on me and is just great stuff. A touch too much alcohol and not the best carbonation and body, but that doesn't hurt this one at all.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",Imperial IPA,98
287,17112,atrus138,4.74,"Poured this from a 12 oz brown bottle into my tulip glass. Appearance is solid, though not exceptional. Pure amber color with a minimal head and lacing. However, its unexceptional look is deceiving. Upon raising the tulip to my nose, I am greeted with one of the most sensational aromas my two nostrils have ever beheld. Absolutely unadulterated hops. Delicious fruity smells such as grapefruit, pineapple, and mango. Crisp pine smells also sing their songs. Lying underneath all of this is honey. Rarely does a beer leave me in such awe before even taking my first sip. Taste does not disappoint. Hops like crazy. Super unbalanced, but really, a malt presence would just get in the way here. Mouthfeel is surprisingly perfect for this. It's nice and light considering the punch it packs. Great carbonation. Really, I wouldn't change this one bit. Extremely drinkable.

S: The hops hit me when I took the cap off the bottle. Huge leafy hops, huge on grapefruit with a definite tropical twang and some pine. A biscuity malt backbone is there as well.  T: Surprise, big on hops throughout. Citrus with some hints of honey, alcohol is apparent in the finish and is slightly drying but can't overcome the big, but balanced, bitterness.  M/D: Carbonation is there but in appropriate quantities, slight creaminess to a light to medium body and some big hop oiliness that coats the mouth. Drinkability is good on this one. A very fine example of the style.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",Imperial IPA,98
287,17112,morimech,4.22,"Pours a cloudy amber with a slow forming one-fingered white head that slowly recedes to a small cap. Some sticky lacing is left behind.  Pop the cap off the bottle and your nose is assaulted with the citrus and piney hops. That is about all I can smell in the room now. It does fade after the pour in a few minutes.  As another reviewer has said, it is like biting into a grapefruit. The malt does slightly balance the hops but let's face it, the hops are the star of this show. I sense alcohol in the taste as well the warming affect. I think it adds another dimension in this beer. A cleansing action to the hops. I can feel the carbonation is low but it is like the hops just make the beer ""pop"" on the tongue and makes it tingle. Medium body and a slight oily feel. The first beer goes down nicely, the second is slower, and then you suffer from palate fatigue and you might as well stop drinking this one for the day(not to mention the ABV).

Poured an orange/copper color with a nice foamy head that settled to a ring that laced nice.  Smell is overwhelming pine and citrus hops.  Taste is pine hops and citrus hops with a background of light malt sweetness. surprisingly there was enough malt to keep the bitterness in check for me. I didnt realize it was 9.3% until i looked. it warms some on the way down, but i would have said 6-7%. the hops leave an oily residue on the back of my tongue i cant get rid of and it makes me what to clear my throat over and over.

287,17112,wheelinshirt,4.61,"12 oz brown longneck bottle from Abe's. Haven't had a chance to try this yet, so i was excited to crack it open. Poured into a wide tulip.  Nice copper color, a little cloudy, modest head with okay retention but left no lacing.  Smell was dominated by citrus hops. Very bold and strong. As it warmed i started to swirl it and got a lot of booze in there too, which really added a nice touch. Taste is bitter, with lots of citric and piney hop flavors and sweetness which i supsect is from the honey. A lot of really good stuff going on here, but i find that with most IIPA's that, if they are using a huge amount of hops, they tend to smell better than they taste.  Mouthfeel is a bit thick from all the malt they had to use to get this one up over 9%, but the drinkability on this one is excellent.

287,17112,Upgrayedd,4.44,"One can not write a review of this beer without mentioning the citrus hoppiness. The first time I sampled this brew last year I was knocked on my ass by how fruity it was. This year's batch is most welcome in my small collection. One thing I noticed, and this might just be me, but this year it seems a little more bitter, which seems to hide some of the citrus the more I drink. Maybe it's just palate fatigue, but by the end of the beer I don't get as much hop flavor as I would like, and thus the bitterness and the alcohol start coming through.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",Imperial IPA,98

The smell bombards your nose with hops and citrus undertones and a touch of malts. The taste slams your toungue with bitter hop tones that consist of grapefruit, pine, coriander, pineapple and a small backstop of malts. Wonderfully strong, great mouthfeel, and I would conclude that the drinkablitly for this beer (for me) is high.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",Imperial IPA,98

Immensely drinkable. I say to ""drink it until you can't go get another one"". Yes, the ABV is high but so what.

287,17112,trem0lo,4.89,"Just picked up a case of this amazing brew. I got one six pack last year (it's a limited release) and loved every sip. When I went back to get more, it was gone!  The appearance is nothing to write home about--a little lighter than Bell's Two Hearted (another favorite of mine)--an attractive dark peach color with a small, cream head.  The beer smells amazing. As you pour it, wafts of spicy citrus make themselves known even at two feet's distance. Stick your nose into the glass and you're rewarded with a wonderful bouquet of candied grapefruit and orange. It is deep and intense. Bell's should make this beer into a scented candle.  This is when you realize it's gonna be good.  Taste is like biting into a sweet, juicy grapefruit. Unlike other hoppy beers, Hopslam has a strong malt backbone that balances out the bitterness of the hops. They are balanced in such a way that it not only hides the 10% ABV, but makes it extremely delicious!  Mouthfeel is not too thick and contributes positively to the drinkability. It feels only slightly thicker than the Two Hearted in my mouth.  The drinkabliity on this beer is off the charts. I would guess it 6-8% as opposed to 10. Most 10% beers have a substantial alcohol twang in the aftertaste but this has none. That fact, combined with it's deceiving mouthfeel, will always make you drink this brew too fast!  If you love hops you will absolutely fall in love with this beer and the great balance it achieves.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",Imperial IPA,98
287,17112,malty,4.47,"Batch 8283  Pours a very slightly hazed golden orange color with visible suspended (almost micro) particles. The loose 1"" cream-colored head sit atop sparse and larger than m=normal carbonation bubbles. Sparse spatterings of lace and lace smudges.  This baby smells like a freshly opened can on DelMonte fruit cocktail from 1 foot away. As I draw the glass nearer, this first impression of smell is galvanized. Then theres a sugar coated fresh lemon slice right below the fruit cocktail scent. I swirl my Sam Adams bulbous glass that emits powdered sugar and grapefruit scents all over the place. The malts are obviously up for the task to take on the awaited hop barrage that I suspect is to some next.  Just like the back label says...'biting and bitter' - yes it's very true. The tropical fruits I smelled at the beginning translate nicely in the taste with a well-balanced malt backbone that never steals the show in the least, but supplies enough bracing for the hops to conduct their well-coordinated trapeze act. There is an interesting vegetal component that's hard to put my finger on, but it reminds me of Brussels sprouts. Not in a bad way, just in an interesting kinda way. Hey, I happen to like Brussels sprouts (especially dilled!).  Mouthfeel is very kinetic and playful. The carbonation is fine with enough spritz factor to produce belches after 1/4 of a bottle. Medium bodied with a well-tuned flavorful finish.  Drinkability is very good. I most definitely would save room for 1 or 2 of these at the end of my session due to its hearty hop attack.  Overall a great double IPA that brings a neat vegetal slant to the show. The flavors are not the (soon to be) typical Dbl. IPA 'big grapefruit' and fusel alcohol that seem to be coming out of the woodwork these days. Bell's wasn't one of the first micros to brew a dbl. IPA, but it seems as if they were waiting for the market to get used to this big IPA frenzy, THEN introduce HopSlam and disrupt the blanket perception of what this stuff is really supposed to taste like. I guess I'm trying to say this is a very original, BALANCED but very bitter/hoppy IPA with world class written all over it. I really want to pair this with a rustic salmon and field greens salad.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",Imperial IPA,98

It is actually a little clearer than Two-Hearted which I find a little surprising. I can smell this beer as I pour it. It smells like I have hop cones under my nose. Pink grapefruit and resinous pine hit my nose with the power of a Roy Jones Jr. punch. There is a decent smell of pineapple coming though as well. Fresh citrus fruit and a deep pine flavor hit your palate up-front with a dry sweetness finishing off the beer on the back of the mouth. There is some slight sweet malt coming to the palate, but is pushed around by the heavy hop flavors and takes a back seat in the flavor profile. The mouthfeel is very smooth and medium bodied. The high carbonation leaves a very dry sensation on your tongue. The drinkability is a little hampered by the high ABV and dry sensation, but is very high for just a beer or two.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",Imperial IPA,98

I suspect it's just in my imagination, and glance over at the half grapefruit on the other counter. The grapefruit is embarrassed. It's all about the nose on this one. HOPS!  I love big beers, but more RIS than double IPAs--with IPA, I usually prefer singles to doubles, as doubles often seem like over-hopped singles so hopped up they taste like nothing. Not so with this one. This is a special beer. I have eleven more to confirm this, thankfully.  Just to clarify, ""drinkability"" is the subjective appeal of a beer, not to be mistaken for ""chuggability."" One of these is plenty, but I love drinking this outstanding beer.

Some tight carbonation continues to rise in streams to the surface.  Has a clean hop-driven nose full of big grapefruit and pine scents. Sweet smelling peach, mandarin orange, and pineapple fill out the bigness of the smell.  Taste is attacking with full on bitterness awash throughout the palate. The taste is somewhere between eating a pine cone and some juicy pieces of fruit, grapefruit, pineapple, etc. The taste is bright and bold from the beginning, with striking middle tones of lighter earthy grain and intense hops. Fills with fruit, then warms up at the finish with a bitter bite and some alcohol heat. Some balanced low end, but pretty submissive to the hop.  Sticky, but with an intense bitter hold and dry-washed finish. Dances on the tongue with hop oil and alcohol sort of swirling around, very nice if you like the style.  Extremely enjoyable and drinkable for the style, with a nice dry quality and intense hoppy, relatively balanced taste. Not so drinkable if you plan on consuming more than one or two, and definitely not if you don't like bitterness and hops.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",Imperial IPA,98

287,17112,Blybloke,4.69,"Recently purchased a six-pack of this fine ale at the Liquor Barrel in Golden Valley, MN.  I'm a big fan of Bell's beers; Two Hearted Ale is my favorite beer of all time. So last year (OK, technically 2006) when I heard they were mass-producing a Double IPA, HopSlam was easily the most anticipated beer on my radar. It turned out to be one of those rare instances where the anticipation was surpassed by the experience. I didn't review it though. Now that it's back, I'm going to put it through it's paces.  Poured into the new Sam Adams Pint Glass. It's a dull orange, ever-so-slightly cloudy with about an inch of tight white cap. Medium-heavy lace after a couple minutes.  I could smell this beer all day. Just like its older brother, Two Hearted Ale, the smell alone is worth the money you pay. Heavy pineapple syrup, red grapefruit, with a little pinch of alcohol. Very little malt comes through to me, which is fine, since this fine creation is all about the hops.  Taste is exceptional. The hops step up and never leave. Again, I don't notice much malt other than a faint sweetness, which in a way makes this beer even more impressive. It manages to be ultra hoppy (as the name suggests) but not overly bitter. Not to sound too over-the-top, but I liken the malt here to the strings on a puppet - or rather the piece of wood that holds the strings on a puppet (I'm sure there's a name for it). You don't see it, but the puppet wouldn't shine with out it. Of course you need someone to control it. So, in that regard, Larry Bell is an artist. Anyway, you'll notice the heavy hops. There is pineapple up front and in back, and I'll agree with another reviewer that a definite apple/pear flavor shows up as well along with a blink of alcohol. Just marvelous flavor.  Nice heavy mouthfeel, not quite perfect, but darn close. A nice, sticky, hoppy film covers my tongue and soft palate.  Drinkability isn't perfect due to the high alcohol content and relatively heavy mouthfeel. Besides, I think you would do yourself a disservice by having more than two of these at a sitting. This is a beer to savor, not session imo.  Overall this is probably my favorite Double IPA. I've had a couple dozen different ones and this one might just take the cake. Highly, highly recommended.

Very large, tight off white head with nice retention and lacing. S: Very strong, fresh floral/piney, grapefruity smell. Slight touch of sweetness, perhaps the honey the bottle mentions. T: Sweeter than I expect for a DIPA and I like it. Starts with sweet honey/grapefruit flavor and then hops take over and give it a nice dry, tart taste. Perhaps there could be more of a malt presence for balance, otherwise no complaints. M: Medium bodied, some sips I think it might be bordering on being slightly thin however. Nice amount of carbonation and a very pleasant, dry, tart aftertaste. D: For 10% abv did not taste any alcohol but certainly felt it as I drank the bottle. I may have served this a little too cool at first as the flavors became much stronger as the beer warmed (and became more enjoyable).  When I consider every aspect of this beer separately, they are all great but in the end I'm left feeling like it all doesn't quite add up for me and I can't place what it is.

287,17112,malcontent,3.54,"A somewhat cloudy, brilliant orange color with minimal white head and above average lacing.  Only the faintest hop aroma peeks out from behind a yeasty, malty, almost doughy beer. I had this problem with Oberon recently and I hope it hasn't crossed over to Hopslam.  Nope, it hasn't. Luckily the hops translate into the taste beautifully. Big spicy start with a fair amount of grapefruit pith to the finish and a rounded sweet malt body sandwiched in between. Bitter aftertaste lingers with an underlying candy sweetness vaguely reminiscent of marshmallows.  Solid body with biting but not overdone carbonation. Hop resin is detectable but is still acceptable for a brew with this type of IBUs. Delicious but the tongue-punishing hop level limits the drinkability.

Mouth feel- average, not quite as viscous as 2007 and that isn't a good thing.  The lacing or legs that the beer presented last year are also missing.  All in all HopSlam 08 is very good but the bar was set so high that it does not measure up to last years offering. I expected the same beer Bells offered up last year and that did not happen.

T: Lots of grapefruit and citrus hops with some piny hops. Caramel sort of sweetness nicely backs this up. Bitterness at the end is nice as well and lasts for a bit. This is one of the few DIPAs not from the West Coast that can stand up in flavor to the best of the San Diego DIPAs. Nicely done.  M: Nice and rich with low to medium carbonation.  D: Very good.  Highly recommended. One very good DIPA.,Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",Imperial IPA,98

This was a mouthwatering, cheek puckering experience in a bottle. Nothing packs more hops than this thing. A little bitter, but in a terrific sort of way. Creamy kind of feeling.

Hops do not attack the nose. I can smell some crystal and caramel malt, but overally the nose is weak. Slight perfumyness as the beer warms. Alcohol is strong on the smell.  Nice hoppy backbone to balance a nice rich maltiness. Hoppy astringenncy and alcohol astringency. way too boozy. Fruty plum and grapes come out as the beer warms.  Some alcohol astringency comes out, but the body of the beer is full and smooth.  A little astringent, but still good.

So fresh hops aroma & taste... love this beer.  January 2007...This was the beer that got me hooked on IPAs in general, let alone imperial/double. Got a case for my birthday and treasured it. Only around a few months in winter will certainly build up anticipation for this beer year after year. This was my favorite IPA in general up until I met a serious homebrewer with some serious hop skills.  Flavors and alcohol nicely rounded together.

This sample was served to me at the Spinnerstown Hotel in Spinnerstown (outside of Quakertown, PA) right by the haunted graveyard. This brew is very hoppy with a small malt backbone of caramel and spice in the background. The various American hops really shine through in the aroma of this beer and the taste holds true as well. A spicy, snappy, hoppy treat of a beer with a sweeter hop note up front and a bitter, resiny bite in the back. This one is kinda the balls. The mouthfeel is medium bodied and well served to repeated drinking which lends a great drinkability to this hoppy yet extremely refreshing and smooth brew...",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",Imperial IPA,98

It's a nice orange color with a cloudy appearance. The taste is not what I was expecting. It has a caramel taste. I'm guessing the hops have died down a bit which is a shame. However, the beer that Im drinking has developed into an amazing beer. Its super drinkable with a fantastic mouthfeel.  Overall, I like this beer. I would have given my left arm to try this fresh.

The bottle I drank was a year old and tasted nothing like the newest batch)  #8283 - poured from bottle into a snifter resulting into a smallish head but with big bubbles moving upwards that reduce in size & remain active. Golden, amber color with an oily appearance that sticks to the glass.  Pungent aroma resinates from the glass smelling of big hops on the nose: grapefruit, pineapple, pine, etc. Carmel malt also present with a honey fragerance.  An oily goodness loaded with hops that attack the taste buds with a hop blast seldom seen from many DIPA. What you smell is essentially what you taste. Also has a grassy low-end to it that rests heavily on the palate followed by a nice crisp finish leaving a fruity, musky dryness.  Exrememly drinkable. The 10% is present and it's a wonderful beverage to sit back, sip, and enjoy its all around presentation. Tastes much better then the aged one I ran across a month ago.

Pours with a scrod chunker sediment loaded golden peach hued pour topped with a quickly settled khaki off-white head cap leaving a tight collar ring.  Bright effervescent nose of bitter lemon rind, tart candy malt met up with a slightly boozy aspect.  First swigs: Mouth pucker bitter lemon peel front. Rips up the palate with sandpaper dry sizzle. Unrelenting dry middle and dry finish. Searching and not finding much vestige of malt backing. Actually awl-kee-hawl bozzy warmth. Try drinking grapefruit orange marmalade and that would rival this Hop the Ripper!  Damn hot and bottered but delicious at the same time. Medium bodied with crisp effervesence. So dry that a tumbleweed fell out of my mouth.  Last swigs: Bright bitter sizzle 2IPA with a light malt backing to showcase a huge hop front. The 9.3% ABV is slightly evident yet somewhat hidden.

T: And damn, this is tasty to drink. Those big citrus hops are right there and with you from start to finish. A bit of malt is there to add balance, which is a nice touch. This beer may be all about the hops, but it's got enough malt and a bit of alcohol warmth to provide some counterpoint.  M: Smooth with a nice crisp bite at the end. Stays with you for a while, due to the hops.  D: If I could get this around here regularly, it would likely have a regular spot in my fridge.

287,17112,blakesell,4.47,"Poured from a 12oz bottle into a standard pint glass.  Appearance- This is slightly different than when it was fresh. A hazy off-orange with a decent 1.5 finger head that quickly dissapates to a foamy film over the top of the glass. Lacing is considerable.  Smell- Wow this is a nice double IPA. Citrus and grapefruit all thru this beer with a bit of malt balance peeking in. Not to say this beer smells balanced, far from it. The hops are clearly over the top on this one. The way it should be really in my opinion.  Taste- Big citrus and grapefruit on the taste just like in the smell. Enough malt to give it a good fullness and a touch of the alcohol that probably could not be avoided.  Mouthfeel- Slightly sticky and warming. Carbonation is low and even. There is a lot of sweetness from the malt that isn't noticed until well into the mouthfeel. Also, that warming from the 9.3%ABV really smacks you in the face soon afterward.  Drinkability- Despite the strong ABV, this beer is deciptively drinkable. On tap it is amazing as well as in the bottle. It looks to be bottle conditioned, but I don't know just how well it will hold up with further aging. I will hold on to a couple bottles, but I have a feeling it's at it's best before those hops mellow out on it.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",Imperial IPA,98

Smells powerfully of orange juice and tangerines with a powdered sugar amplifying its fruity sweetness. There's also a touch of rye crisp that rounds this one out nicely.  There's a big hop punch to start this one off that is pleasantly aggressive. The citrus fruitiness is there, but there's a dry woody pine that steals the show along with a touch of grapefruit rind. A slight alcohol sting sneaks in with this dryness. It finishes out a little mossy and dirty.  Feels huge with a nice crisp body but a huge swarm of tiny bubbles that thicken it up quite a bit.

287,17112,KRMBeerGuy,4.92,"Very large mouth feel, excellent obsessive hop flavor. This is quite possibly the perfect American Double IPA. Serious flavor up front, smacks you like your dad's belt... then a long lingering floral hop experience through the finish. Wonderful mixture of some very organic flavors. This is my favorite beer of any that I have tried, and believe me, I've tried A LOT! Any serious hophead should hunt down a few bottles of this one and savor it for all it's worth...  UPDATE: Saved some 2007 Hopslam and consumed in Spring of 2008. This beer ages extremely well! The edge of the fresh bottles is now much more mellow on the start, and the alcohol flavor is more subdued as well. It seems that even more of the hop flavor comes out in it now.

287,17112,GreenWBush,4.39,"Rejoice; Midwestern classic microbrewery in need of I2pa finally releases one and goes all the way, releasing it in six-pack damage the head format. The wait for this has been long in the making. I remember drooling over early reviews when it was served on draft at the Eccentric café. This ended up setting me back $15 for this sixer, a bit steep when you consider that works out to be about $4.50 a bomber. Still, this is a big beer that demands your attention, so what are you going to say, no?  The appearance of this is true to type and actually pale, on its way to peach in color. Globules and flecks of yeast slurry are all over the pour  interesting. Calm head that cascades slowly is not a surprise for a ~10% ABV beer.  Nose is amazing; the hop synergized. Layers of hoppy goodness from pine to grapefruit and back again. The twang of muskmelon. Impression of high-test cannabis, a body/sock funk, and a piney-heat. Yummy, superfresh.  Taste is gorgeous and instantly recalls Dreadnaught and Ruination. Peach cream-savers are also dredged up from the memory banks. Somewhat dry in character, sweet at times but ends up bittersweet. Malt/hop character goes off the trail late into the swallow and on repeat performance. Very good, but not great. Needs just a little bit more of a bitter punch, especially to hold true to the bottles designation.  Not necessarily the world-endingly-awesome brew some were hoping for, but close to divine regardless.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",Imperial IPA,98
287,17112,seaoflament,4.37,"Got this one courtesy of SPLITGRIN with a number 7690 on the back of the label.  Pours a golden orange color with a thin white lace of bubbles around the glass. The aroma is of juicy citrus and pine hops with a nice malt backbone. The taste is excellent with some good bitterness upfront, slightly alcoholic, but very balanced and drinkable. The mouthfeel is refreshing and the finish is dry with a clean taste. A very solid example of a DIPA and one I wouldn't mind drinking again.  *Updated review with a fresh bottle--Feb. 2, 2008. Batch # 8277  A big thanks to ncvbc for this fresh bottle.  Pours brownish, orange color with an inch of foam which leaves some lacing as it settles to a thin layer. (4)  Big citrus aroma upfront, lots of grapefruit, lemon, orange, pineapple, and nectarine. A touch of honey in the background but very faint; then the toasted malts and bready notes come through the assault of hops. Some caramel and toffee aromas. Very hoppy yet with a strong malt presence to keep this one balanced. For some odd reason I'm getting some cheesy aroma as it warms up. (4)  Taste is of bitter citrus zest with some toast and caramel following close by. Somewhat grainy and dry in the finish. I'm also picking up a slight presence of alcohol in the aftertaste. Some lingering bitterness in the finish, along with bitter grapefruit, lemon and toast. The alcohol is a little more noticeable as it warms up. (4)  Mostly smooth on the tongue with just enough carbonation to clean the palate, well done.

Smell: It smells like hop harvest time in Idaho. Thick piney, fruity aroma that sticks to your clothes. It almost smelled good enough to smoke if you know what I mean.  Taste: Hops and more hops. A good balance of bitterness and flavor. Its a little thing considering the 9.3% ABV. Sweet citrus fruits accentuate the bitter character. I wouldn't believe that it is 100IBU but it definitely has some bite.  Mouthfeel: Alcohol burn and slight mouthcoating stickyness. Bitterness is slightly lingering with a slight astringency/tartness. Carbonation is medium and helps cleanse the palate but also tends to dry.  Drinkability: I think this beer would be a perfect hop head session beer. Its flavorful yet not overpoweringly bitter.

287,17112,bditty187,4.82,"Cloudy, bright peachy-yellow gold in hue; what a lovely color! It is like a tropical sunrise or something. Off-white foam, at the apex the head was almost two fingers tall. The bubbles quickly fell to a fizzy, soapy cap. Surprisingly there wasnt much lacing. The color of the liquid drives the attractiveness of the appearance; I do wish the head attributes were better. Still, this is a lovely looking beer.  The nose is hoppy. (Understatement is intended.) Big citrus aromas, grapefruit fresh, orange zest, pineapples too. Plus pine needles in the background. There is an amazing array of tropical fruit aromas! Wow. Not much malt. Quite alcohol too. But there are plenty of freaking hops. This is a hop bomb loaded with shrapnel. Watch out this is one complex DIPA. Inviting, to say the least; I cant wait any longer to take a sip!  The nose is hoppy. (Understatement is intended. There is no emotion on the Internet.) Damn bitter. Damn flavorful. Grapefruit rinds, hints of citrus flesh, mangos, oranges, pineapple, apricots, pine needles, spruce tree (honestly, I havent actually tasted the latter two). While the malt isnt talkative it does provide a solid foundation for the hops to spring off of. Minimal alcohol heat; moderate sweetness. Im graced with a long, bitter finish and aftertaste with a cheesy hop taste that I like in small amounts (as found in this beer). I am very impressed with the entire flavor profile. Kudos to Bells!  Medium/medium-full in body, low but natural carbonation, the mouthfeel is ideal and is very supportive. I cant see how it could be improve upon.  Oh my this is one amazing beer. This might be the best DIPA I have ever tasted. If not the best it is number 1-A. I could drink this by the gallon. I would bathe in HopSlam. My idea of heaven is a hamburger buffet with loads of gourmet cheeses and other toppings and an endless supply of HopSlam. Simply stated: I am so impressed. Is it love? Oddly, I thought I reviewed HopSlam. Hell, I also thought I had notes on this beer. They seemed to be misplaced. Luckily I have two bottles left (I wont after tonight!).

287,17112,jspruit,4.12,"Found a cold bottle of this at Martha's Vineyard-a bit of a surprise this time of year and something that I was looking to try.  Smelled great right after opening the bottle and poured with a great strong scent into the pint glass. Didnt pour as murky as I thought that it would be but rather a orange gold with a white 2-finger head with large bubbles. Some sweet floral hints along with the strong hops arose after the pour-my taste buds were watering by then.  The hops are the most evident tastes to me and they are pretty consistent throughout. The floral hints I smelled early definitely come through in the beer too-and there is carbonation throughout as well. There seems to be a alcohol taste at the end of each sip-not quite to my liking really as I think that my tongue is a bit numb now.  I think that that this beer definitely is hoppy enough for me, perhaps a bit too much for my liking.

Head almost instantly faded into a ring of bright white lace in the glass. Smell: Smooth , somewhat aggressive herbal hop aroma, tons of biscuity malt aroma, pears, citrus fruits, and pine all rose from the glass.

An interesting orangey hop flavor concomitant with some oily piney hops as well. Doughy malt provides stability and balance. Mouthwatering, delicious beer.  Medium body, appropriate carbonation. Very smooth.  The alcohol is entirely unapparent and a 12 oz bottle leaves me wanting more. Very deserving of its high rating.  Rerate: Oh how young I was when I wrote this!

Minimal alcohol is noticed, but I can detect some mouthwatering fruits such as grapefruit and nectarines. Very inviting.  Taste: This beer has a good amount "" hop slam "" qualities thou I believe it may also have some dull qualities. I'm getting some mildly sweet fruits, mild citrus, almost seems like a small IPA with that big beer bang. Not bad by any means just not living up to its name in my opinion. This more "" hop balanced "" than a hop slam. :Referr : Lagunitas Maximus for "" hop slam "" aka 75ish ibus!!  Mouthfeel: This is medium bodied with a good amount of carbonation.

Only thing I guess im knocking is not commanding it's namesake.    Cheers2Beers",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",Imperial IPA,98
287,17112,greenbeaner,4.7,"It's taken me a long time to get around to reviewing this one despite how many times I've had it, but that should tell you something :) This may just be my favorite American Double IPA.  Deep deep copper color, frothy one finger head that dissipates to a ring with a quiet lacing.  Smells of heavy hops and citrus up front...mostly grapefruit, lots of malt in the finish.  The heavens have truly graced my tastebuds. Such a perfect balance in this brew. The hops are huge but the citrus keeps them in check, as the strength of the hops almost rise and fall again throughout. The finish is smooth and malty.  Medium bodied in the mouth...it's smooth and creamy but is still able to finish dry, crisp, and clean. Soo good.  I love this beer. I'd drink lots if I could. Normally I would rate drinkability down a bit for higher alcohol percentage....but, personal opinion: I'd rather drink a few strong ones than a bunch of weak ones, so I'm gonna go with my gut and give it a good rating all around. Thank you Bell's.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",Imperial IPA,98
287,17112,orbitalr0x,4.49,"From notes. Pours from the 12oz bottle a nice clear golden orange color with a half inch of bubbly white foam on top that leaves spots of lacing on the glass. Real nice clarity. Aromas are a blast of dense hops with an amalgamation of scents...floral, pine and big on the citric side as well with grapefruit standing out. Sorta sweet caramel in the background but the hop bouquet dominates here and really shines. One of the best aromas I've come across in awhile.  First sip brings a rush of dense hop oils swimming with big citrus, floral and pine resin flavors. Sweet caramel malts in the background that do their best to stand up to the onslaught of the bitter hops. The hop flavors and so vibrant and the profile is a nearly perfect mix. It flows down with a nice hit of bitterness and only a faint hint of alcohol. This is simply a damn fine brew and a standout for the style.  Mouthfeel is medium bodied and on the heavier side. This makes itself known as you drink it for sure. Good carbonation. This is just a freakin awesome double IPA and I cannot wait until they release this again. I've had this on tap as well and it's been phenomenal. Another feather in the hat for Bell's...easily one of my favorite midwest brewers. I'm patiently awaiting the day they distribute in IL again!",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",Imperial IPA,98
287,17112,jjayjaye,4.42,"Pours a slightly hazy amber color with a full finger off white head that fades quickly. Spotty lacing observed.  Need to let it warm up quite a bit to enjoy the flat out grapefruit citrus aroma.  Medium bodied, the mouth feel is immediately bitter with a nicely balanced malt character.  The flavor is quite like the smell. A nice tart blast of grapefruit and it tends to linger in the finish.  Drinkability - Another great IIPA; this one being one of the hoppiest flavored. The 9.3% ABV provides a warmth to the mix. Recommended.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",Imperial IPA,98
287,17112,scoobybrew,4.72,"This was poured from the bottle into a pint glass. It has a hazy light copper color with a decent head that has good retention. The aroma is wonderfully hoppy and malty, blending to produce a pineapple like scent that is just fantastic. The flavor is strongly hoppy but balanced very well with the sweet malt so that the hop bitterness is noticed on the finish, but is not overwhelming. It has a medium body with moderate carbonation.  This is a wonderful beer. I'm not as familiar with the double IPA style as I would like to be as most of the double IPAs I've tried have really turned me off, either incredibly bitter or sweet and a balance between the two extremes just isn't there. This is definitely not the case with this example. It's very enjoyable. Of course, would I expect less from one of my favorite breweries?",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",Imperial IPA,98
287,17112,Toddv29424,4.01,"This beer pours a hazy golden color like most IPA's. There is not a huge amount of bubbles that come up, but a generous amount. The smell of this beer is really terrific, lots of floral hops and special arrangements that I have never smelt before. The taste has five or six distinct hop tastes to it, but unfortunately never really develops any of them. You can tell that great time and energy went into this beer, but it seems like less time went into studying how the hops would react to each other, and whether or not they would all form together. I would still say this beer kicks ass, but the taste gets knocked as they forget that more is not always better. I'll definitely enjoy this again though.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",Imperial IPA,98
287,17112,plaid75,4.2,Poured a medium hazy copper hue with a one finger creamy white head. There was good retention and sticky lacing.  The smell featured an upfront sweet orange hop with accents of pine and pepper.  The taste consisted of an upfront spicy and resiny hop with a robust doughy malt. Some mild warming alcohol appeared at the finish.  The mouthfeel was full with a warm finish.  Overall a superior DIPA. Very drinkable considering the ABV.

287,17112,crwills,3.7,"I think I am at the rapidly declining end of a love-hate hop relationship. I used to love these hop bombs, and now I often find them one-dimensional and hard to drink. This one, regardless of its high rating and great aroma/flavour, didn't really do it for me. What can I say about it? Massive grapefruit and pine hops all over the place. Balance is OK, but it's still a bitter beast. No astringency or soapy flavours, which is good, but not a whole lot of depth. Alcohol is very well-hidden. Refreshing, definitely a palate killer, and hopheads will (and obviously do) love it.  That said, I'd love to try this on tap or cask and see how it compares.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",Imperial IPA,98
287,17112,xgrigorix,3.13,"Twelve ounce brown bottle. Batch # on back label, which yields a bottling date when punched into Bell's online dB.  Pale amber, thin creamy white head.  Notes of lemon & grapefruit make up the nose.  Sweet with a touch of biscuit. Finishes with big bold grapefruit flavour.  Medium bodies, moderate carbonation.  No real depth of flavour. Unremarkable.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",Imperial IPA,98
287,17112,CharlieMopps,4.79,"A: Two and a half fingers of billowing head that dissipated ever so slowly, leaving in its wake a foamy lace. The beer itself was a transparent deep amber and burnt-orange.  S: Could smell it as soon as I opened the bottle. There was a big floral bouquet that had a sweetness to it. Also in the mix were an array of citrus fruit smells; grapefruit, lemon, orange.  T: Lipsmacking good. Very smooth transition of flavor with a bit of a sweet introduction, immediately followed by a strong but pleasing hop presence. Honestly, although the hops are huge in this beer, I didn't find it as much of a ""biting, bitter, tongue bruiser"" as advertised on the label. And because of that, I think the beer's flavor is all the better for it. It doesn't go way over the top with hops, and fades nicely leaving that sweet, lingering, and somewhat bitter but refreshing aftertaste.  M: Well carbonated for a creamy and silky mouthfeel. A nice body to this that makes it enjoyably thick.  D: Due to the well-managed hop presence, this one can easily be enjoyed in succession, I think.. especially for any hop-heads out there. Also, the refreshing aspect keeps you wanting more, as it won't blow you out of the frame with bitterness, despite its 106 IBU rating.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",Imperial IPA,98
287,17112,wcudwight,4.7,"Pours a hazy tangerine color with a sticky but thin off-white head. Carbonation bubbles rise to the top. Fresh hop cone aroma. Nothing more, nothing less. The flavor really shines as the hops take the taste buds through the whole gamut of hop flavors. Citrus, piney prickles the mouth. Amazingly it's not over-bitter and is still very drinkable. The alcohol is completely covered by the oh so bold hop flavors. Mouthfeel is sticky and tingly. The hops prickle the tongue. I could session this. It's THAT good. The best tasting big hop beer yet!!

287,17112,BeerTruth,4.3,"Thanks to hoppymeal and limesmut for this beast.  12 oz. bottle poured into a nonic.  Pours a burnt oragne hue with a fluffy white head that dies down a bit after pour. Stickiness is here and there, not a whole lot but it's present. Dirty, oily, citrus hops beat the crap outta my nose...but I love it. I also detect a stale bread scent in there as well, maybe this comes from the tiny bit of malt in this brew. Taste is not what I expected at all. Yeah the hops are there, but it's not that bitter at all. The malt displays itself quite well in the taste, very bready. A pale tasting malt, but perfect for this style. Hops seem to switch to a pine taste, but very pleasant. This is one complex tasting beer! Mouthfeel is very thick and chewy with little carbonation. Drinkability is pretty good, the alcohol is quite hidden. Wow, love this one. Definitely do what you can to get this beer.

Body is thick and rich. I love a good chewin' beer!  This is quite a beverage. Thick syrupy. good. It is unique in its ultra sweetness and bitterness at the same time.

Huge grapefruity hops in the nose, along with a touch of sweet malt. Medium-bodied with a rich hoppy character that is full of zesty citrus and some pine. The alcolhol is well-hidden but you can tell it is there. Some sweet malt and fruit flavors are underneath as well. The finish is nicely bitter and lasting, retaining the citrusy hops feel.

The smell is massive amounts of citrus hops with some pine aromas. The taste is all hops, it does not have an overt malt prescense. Of course there must be a ton of malts to balance out all these hops. The hops add lots of bitterness (like you would expect) but, there is an amazing amount of ""aroma"" hops in the taste. The mouthfeel is just right, not to light, not to thick, great balance. This is one of my favorite IPAs. As a hop head, I think this is perfectly balanced between the malt backbone and the hops. Of course, if you are not a fan of overtop IPAs, then this probably is not for you :)",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",Imperial IPA,98
287,17112,longarm,4.25,"I had this first at a Larry hosted event recently in D.C. (incidentally, go if you ever have the chance. Larry Bell is a great host.) I was most impressed with this beer during the tasting and wanted to get my hands on some again. Here's are my thoughts on a bottle provided by a friend from Virginia.  Light orange with huge, fluffy head. Exceptional.  I can smell the grapefruit-esque hops, wafting from the glass sitting 6 feet away. Delightful citrus aroma. Not much malt, but I could stuff my head inside of a glass and bask in the delight of pure, fresh grapefruit. Maybe a bit one-dimensional, but who's complaining?  Flavor is fairly well balanced for an AIPA. Initially sweet, but this doesn't linger and the hops move-in to balance without being too bitter. Enough malt to stand-up to the hops, but nothing cloys. Nothing about hops overwhelms on the side of bitter as the name would suggest. The hop-""slam"" seems all in the nose and this is just fine with me. Nice crisp finish.  Don't let the name worry you. This is an exceptionally drinkable beer, likely to be enjoyed by both hopheads and beer drinkers even a little afraid to try hoppy beers. Thanks to Mr. Bell for bringing another great AIPA into an already crowded market. I think this one has staying power.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",Imperial IPA,98

The head is 2 fingers of off white thick fluff, It leave quite a bit on nice lace.  The smell is a powerful grassy aroma, with alcohol and pine needles. Nice.  The taste follows, very grassy with lots of pine, a little thin on the citrus, could use a bit.  The mouthfeel was good but a bigger thicker malt would be welcome and up the body some.  The drinkability was great, quite enjoyable from the tap. Prosit, MK",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",Imperial IPA,98
287,17112,Duster72,4.02,"Pours a clear copper color with nice big head that takes a few moments to dissipate. Big grapefruit aromas when you pop the cap with some pine notes lurking. Taste is relatively smooth citrus and pine hops with plenty of malts to give a sweet body. As it gets older the hops die off more quickly than I would have thought and it becomes a boozy sweet beer that does not reflect the fresh beer much at all. Mouthfeel is nice. A little too much alcohol to get a high drinkability score. A great DIPA, up there with my favorites. Fresh on draft must be excellent!",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",Imperial IPA,98
287,17112,IntriqKen,3.81,"Man, what a beautiful head. Full, dense craggy bubbles that melt slowly to very sticky lacing and top covering white. Light, cloudy golden orange liquid.  Aromas are all about the pine and citrus hops.  Taste is sweet pale malt, some candy sugar flavors, and then pine hops that finish to grapefruit cleansing.  Aftertaste is surprisingly light and mild..only a hint of the citrus hops sweetened to the point of reminding me of pink grapefruit.  I'm afraid you would never realize the ABV you are ingesting in this brew...it could be very dangerous....it's very drinkable. *** I don't know what to say. I've a new 6'r this year and honestly can't drink it. I can't finish a single bottle. I guess my tastes have changed drastically, but I do not like this beer at all.

Taste - Obviously a big hop flavor. Quite a bit of pine, grapefruit, and pineapple. Nice malt backbone to balance out the hops.  Mouth - Light to medium bodied with the same carbonation.  Drinkability - The beer is dangerously drinkable for 9.5%. Better watch out with this one cause it will creep up on you if you are not careful.

287,17112,Luchman,4.45,"12oz bottle poured into a tulip.  A: A nice clear, amber color with a small, creamy, off white head that dissipates quickly.  S: Strong, sharp pine needle at first. At second whiff I get a handful of other fruits. Grapefruit, orange, pineapple, apricot, and lemon. Granted, all of these are minimal compared to the pine/grapefruit, but the smell is awesome. Not too much malt here, which is a tad disappointment, but it does have some slight sweetness to it.  T: Nice and quite refreshing for something called a Hop Slam. Hops are, of course, the winner here with pine and grapefruit/orange as the leaders. Other fruits, the lemon, apricot, and pineapple, are around as well. Some slight evidence of alcohol is found, but does not distract at all. Malts are more present than the smell and give a nice sweet, bready note to the taste in the back. Slight bitterness ends with the tongue numb from the hops. Awesome.  M: Mouth feel is not as full or thick or sticky as I would have liked, but is still good. Light/medium body with a low/medium carbonation that makes this beer go down easy and clean.  D: Insanely drinkable for the ABV. This stuff is awesome. Definitely will have to get my hands on this again.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",Imperial IPA,98
287,17112,BlindPig,4.5,"A- About a inch thick white (or JUST off) head on a cloudy darker orange body. S- Huge hops up front. Citrus, lemon grass, grapefruit, pine, and hints of orange. There is a sweet malt in there to help balance it out. T- Big hop flavor right off the bat then some malt creeps in then the tickle of alcohol on the tongue and then the warming from the alcohol. All this is going on while the hops are just stuck in the mouth. All the aromas above come in to make the hop flavor. The malt comes through and kind of helps balance it out by adding touches of sweetness. The bitterness is all over the tongue and stays for a long time. M- Full body with low/medium carbonation. D- It is very good. Huge amount of hops so for any hop head this would be a great beer.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",Imperial IPA,98
287,17112,MuddyFeet,4.47,Loved this beer.  Poured a murky off-orange in color. I noticed some sediment in the bottom of the bottle but a bit snuck past my careful pour and hung in the beer. Thin head resting on top. Nose is malty with just a slight hop tang that belies what lies underneath.  Flavor is perfectly balanced. Hops are fruity and citrus. Like biting into a ripe orange. The first sip grabbed my attention. Malts never rise to the top but are consistently present throughout each sip providing a perfect balance. Hop oils linger around the edges of the tongue. Mouthfeel is a bit watery but concealed well behind all the hops. A nice beer to enjoy a bottle or two at a time because after a couple my tongue would get numb.,Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",Imperial IPA,98

The hops do linger on the tongue but are not overpowering.  Mouthfeel: Good Mouthfeel with the right amount of carbonation.  Drinkability: TI think I could have a few of these in a sitting. The hops are well balanced with malt sweetness.  Yet another great beer from Bells Brewing.

The only reason I didn't give the appearance a perfect score, I have seen larger more intense heads on other dbl. ipa's. The taste had multiple levels of flavors. First wave of pine resin to coat your palate for the second wave of intense grapefruit then a huge fruit basket of fresh oranges,pinapple,lemon,apricots.

Served in a snifter, the beer pours an amber/orange color with about a half inch white head which goes away pretty quickly. With a name like HopSlam, of course it smells like hops. Citrus (grapefruit) and piney hops dominate, with some malt in there. It tastes pretty much the same, but the citrus taste is stronger, with grapefruit, lemon and some orange in the taste, along with a piney/floral taste and some grain/malt. Mouthfeel is nice and full, with it being creamy and oily. Just the right amount of carbonation, too. The relatively high ABV isn't very noticable, and it's very, very drinkable.

287,17112,ddarden,4.37,"12oz bottle (I am assuming this a 2006 release) poured into a pint glass. It is copper in color with a small white head that recedes fairly quickly into a light covering. Also there is quite a bit of yeast from the bottom of the bottle that got stired up in the pour. The smell is very nice for a DIPA, hops and more hops. It is good mix of pine and grapefruit that yields a sweet bready malt smell through it all. The first sip is not as hoppy as the smell but very well balanced. It has an initial kick of pine but quickly turns to the malt and alcohol and finishes with a very nice bitter. It also has a slight medicinal flavor to it, but not overly strong. This is a good double ipa and doesn't get too sweet like some do in this style. The alcohol is just a tad warm for me, but not enough to say it is distracting. The mouthfeel is medium to thick and coats the mouth nicely. The overall drinkability is good for 9.3 abv beer. This is an excellent example of the style, not the best, but in the mid to top of the pack.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",Imperial IPA,98
287,17112,Crosling,4.1,"Sampled a few different batches thusfar. Lovely hints of grapefruit and lemon on the palate. My only complaint is its a bit medicinal and herbal and I just dont like Double IPAs with that character. But, it has a lovely malt character. Wish it was a tad bit brighter, but its a lovely DIPA.

287,17112,RedHaze,4.13,"Thanks to bditty187 for this bottle.  Pours a hazy bright orange with a fluffy two finger head that fades slowly to a thick cap. tha lacing is very sticky, as you would expect from a very hoppy beer.  Smell; initially this is on the floral side, but then a ton of citric aromas come wafting out of the glass, with grapefruit, oranges and lemons. I can also can detect a nice sweet malty backbone, that should help offset those hops.  Taste; as with the smell this starts out floral on the first couple of sips. Then the citrus dominates with the oranges, grapefruits and just a touch of lemon thrown in. The malts are definitely there, and provide a sweet undercurrent to the hops. On the finish I can feel the alcohol a bit in my nose, and a bit in my throat, but it never becomes distracting.  Mouthfeel is a touch on the full side, and the drinkability on this is just great. I could drink a few of these without feeling completely pummeled by the hops, but I think the alcohol would definitely knock me out.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",Imperial IPA,98

Pineapple and papaya dominates the nose, with lesser hints of melon and citrus. The hops almost obscure the malty aroma of bread crust and caramel. Im starting to drool, and really looking forward to how something that smells this good tastes.  Taste Another wow. Huge tropical blast of tangy pineapple and papaya, hint of honeydew, that transforms into a resinous bitterness similar to grapefruit peal, almost with a pine resin character. This hopslam occurs overtop of the rich malts, with their bread crustiness and a good slam of caramel sweetness.  Mouthfeel A big, bad assed rich brew. Lingering hop bitterness and oiliness, almost strips the tongue and the roof of my mouth and goes all the way back to my throat. Not overpowering, as is almost balanced by the rich malts with noticeable caramel sweetness and full body. Enough fine and lively carbonation to keep this one from being cloying. Some alcohol warmth soothes the stripping hop bitterness.  Drinkability Pretty easy and enjoyable to drink this one. More than one might be a challenge, but if this is the first beer of the night theres not much point moving on to something else. A good, maybe even ideal session brew for the IIPA loving hopheads. Not for those who dont like hops, this one definitely packs a hop slam! Glad i found this one, have been looking for it for a while. Will definitely drink again!",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",Imperial IPA,98
287,17112,theGroove,4.3,"The quality of Bell's is delivered again. Perhaps Bell's best beer,! This is an excellent double IPA. If you love hops, you'll love this stuff. A great citrus aroma.

287,17112,SaCkErZ9,4.35,"Served on tap in a 10oz flute styled glass at Flying Saucer in Charlotte, NC. Pours a murky rust orange hue with minimal head. No lacing.  Aroma is orange juice with some lemon rinds on the rim of the glass. Toss in some freshly mowed grass and you got yourself a nice smellin beer.  Taste is wonderful. Compared to the bottled version, this is much smoother and the hops have seemed to take a little hiatus, which was perfect as I thought the bottled version was too astringent and bitter. This one is nearly perfect.  Full mouthfeel and great drinkability for 9.5abv.

287,17112,Talisker,3.5,"12oz bottle received from grynder33 in a great trade.  A remarkable beer - certainly an extreme hop showcase. But focuses on the (to me) less pleasant bitter, puckering characteristics at the expense of the juicy citrus that California IPAs and DIPAs tend to highlight.  Pours a clear brownish orange. Minimal head. Nose is hop-dominated - very dry, remarkably clean for such a heavy beer - with some refreshing malt in the background. Taste is very nicely integrated - bitter American hops followed by more bitter American hops, then some more bitter American hops drying you out a little more, but all on top of a relatively dry malt bed. A tiny bit of ash on the finish here - not a pleasant wrapup. But they've managed to kepe this mammoth beer away from the sticky syrup that so many extreme beers fall into.  I don't favor the overly drying bitterness without much balance from citrus or pine. And certainly this is no session beer - one is likely to do it for you no matter how much you like it. But if you want to explore this aspect of Centennial hops, there's probably no better-made beer to do it with.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",Imperial IPA,98
287,17112,mynie,4.22,"Sampled at the Lava Lounge in Waterloo, Iowa.  Pours cherry amber with a nice white head. A very clear and sparkly pour, uncharacertistic from a Double IPA.  Smells of hops hops hops and more hops. Primarily dry hops, entirely American. Solid nodes of citrus fruit, pine, and potting soil. Very little malt presence.  Tastes like hops, hops, and more hops. Citrus fruit up front, moving into sticky, resiny pine, and ending on a more earthen, dry hop with the slightest malt breadiness at the end to cut into the bitterness.  It's a tasty beer that does a good job of messing you up, but it's completely unbalanced. Unlike Dreadnaught or Rogue's x2 IPA, Hop Wallop, and Ruination there's no yeastiness to cut into the hops, no interplay between flavors. I only bring up these great beers from 1st class breweries beacuse Bell's is a first class brewery and they're charging first-class prices for HopSlam. If I'm paying seven bucks a bottle at a bar to have a beer, it better be almost perfectly crafted.  Good, but not as good as it could have been.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",Imperial IPA,98
287,17112,Boppar,4.75,"From a bottle into an over-sized wine glass.  Thick, great head, with exceptional lacing. Rich golden hues. Frothy. I really couldn't help swirling it in my glass to play with the lace.  This beer smells incredible. Tropical fruity hops. Pineapple leads the charge with hoppy spice in hot pursuit.  This beer tastes almost as good as it smells. Definite pineapple taste. Mango and/or papaya are there as well in a more subdued background kind of way. Something creamy, possibly coconut is there as well.  Exquisite mouthfeel. Creamy, frothy, uninhibited bliss.  I could drink these all day. And with the non-evident 9.3% ABV, the hangover the next morning would only serve as a constant, friendly reminder of how thoroughly happy I had been the day before.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",Imperial IPA,98

A slight sweet maltiness added to the hops.  T- Delicious- If you want to taste hops this is it. Same as the nose. Balanced with a good amount of malt, adding some vanilla and grain.  M- Pretty bitter. A reasonable cover of the alcohol level, but not the best of had. But all in all, goes down smooth.  D- This beer is so flavorful I wouldn't mind having a lot of it, but I wouldn't say it's the most sessionable beer.

Appearance: Golden orange, translucent enough to make it glow. Big rocky head that stuck around and chatted awhile.  Smell: Super fresh Centennial-style huff off of this libation...almost smell some mango piney-ness.  Taste: Surprisingly smooth for such an alkie %. Caramel maltiness balances the IBUs and citrousity. Super hoppy, and well balanced.  Mouthfeel: When I tried this stuff I exclaimed, ""Just like Hop Gravy."". It had a rich mouthfeel that did not mess with the balance of malt and hops.  Drinkability: In my case...INFINITE.

For the big hop presence this beer is very well balanced with adaquate malt to make it a very smooth taste. The alcohol content is masked well.

Predominant grapefruit with a bit of pine in the nose and flavor. Body is decent. Looong hoppy finish that later turns a bit sweet or turns on the saliva glands. Very good beer!

The head is about 1 finger and dissipates quickly leaving some heavy lacing and stickiness all over the sides of the glass. Smell is floral at first - there is also some pine and a little bit of an almost pineapple like sweet smell, very interesting. This is an excellent tasting beer, even better than it's brother Two-Hearted, IMO. There's some grapefruit flavor up front which gives way to pineapple sweetness and it all ends with a bitter, dry hop kick. This is by no means the hoppiest beer ever, but it is incredibly well balanced for a double IPA. Mouthfeel is syrupy and delicious - the carbonation amount is just right. An incredible beer from my home state - this is an easy beer to drink, which might be dangerous since this baby clocks in at around 10%.

Great looking orange body with a white head that fell pretty fast.Alot of bubbles streaming to the top of the glass.  Alot of citrusy and pine smells in there.Like grapefruit and pineapple.  The taste is pineappley but toned down.I would have expected more of a hop bite from the name of the beer.  The mouthful is syrpy and thick but very good and sweet.  I would have liked more hops but we cant have what we want everytime.While this beer isnt as hoppy as some of the double ipa monsters.It is tasty and worth checking out.I plan on having it again.Good job Bells!,Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",Imperial IPA,98
287,17112,Mattysox,3.48,"Was very excited to try this on draft at Rustico in Alexandria. It pours a deep, bright and very hazy orange color with a rocky two-finger bright white head that dissipates a little quickly. It settles into a fine foamy ring and leaves hints of sticky lacing throughout.  The nose is dominated by citrus hop aromas, as well as a hint of sweetness from the alcohol. There is a faint piney aroma, and tinges of candied fruit. The aroma was not as overpoweringly hoppy as I expected. Certainly not as in your face as Hercules or Ruination. It was pleasant, but not remarkable.  The taste was pretty well balanced between the hops (again, not as omnipresent as you would expect from a beer called Hopslam) and the loads of malt they must use to make this. The finish is where, to me, this beer goes astray. Instead of leaving that really resiny, floral hoppiness to linger, the finish is dominated by a cloyingly sweet, candied malt flavor. This, coupled with the high ABV, makes for a ""one and done"" kind of beer- not a sessionable brew at all.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",Imperial IPA,98

The head fades quickly, but sticks to the glass like flies on a spider's web.  Smells of floral hops and citrus, particularly grapefruit. Also bits of pine. Very aromatic.  Taste is definitely hops, but not exceptionally bitter. There is absolutely citrus flavors in the works; grapefruit, orange and tangerine. I also noticed honey. Alcohol is well hidden, but noticeable in the finish if you're looking for it.  It feels fairly carbonated, sparkling on my tongue, but goes down easily. I could drink a hundred of these.

287,17112,travelfrog,4.12,"Ultra-hoppy ""Double IPAs"" such as this appear to be all the rage in the USA nowadays. To my surprise, I rather enjoy this fad. I tried this fine example on tap at my favorite pizza pub, paired with a spicy pizza. The bitterness set off the spiciness quite well.  Appearance was pale yellow, a bit cloudy, with a good, albeit not very long-lasting, head.  Smell was quite noticeable; not surprising in a double IPA. Lots of hops and yeast to enjoy.  Taste was an explosion of noble bitterness, as well as a hint of crystal malt and an unusual piney aftertaste.  Mouthfeel was just fine, with the concentrated hoppiness detracting just slightly from the enjoyable texture.  As for drinkability, this brew will never be confused with Rolling Rock. But given its 9.3% ABV, a slight markdown in this category is almost an act of professional responsibility. :)",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",Imperial IPA,98
287,17112,surlysober,4.32,"FOURTH TRIAL: This is a great beer for any hop-lover, although I have to admit that it's tasted a bit different each time I've had it. This time it was great, other times it's a bit too sweet for my taste. It pours a golden yellow with very little head (there is a good bit of lacing though). The aroma is slightly peachy with a lot of nice, clean hoppy citrus. The taste is similar, but there's a definite warming and you can taste the alcohol (not in a bad way). This beer is less malty that some of the recent DIPAs I've had, but the little malt flavor it does have is a nice caramel. The mouthfeel is full and smooth and it leaves a nice sticky bitterness on the back of the tongue. Overall, a great Double IPA.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",Imperial IPA,98
287,17112,SwillBilly,4.52,"Poured from 12 oz bottle:  Appearance: Pours a light amber with a nice 2 finger off white head that fades fairly slowly to a sheer lacing on the glass. Big, thick sheets of lacing line the glass as the beer empties the glass.  Aroma: Big and juicy with plenty of grapefruit rind and orange peel dominating the aroma with hints of sugar candy and fresh herbs.  Taste: Fantastic !! The nose is a precurser to things to come with the flavor profile. Starts with a big hop bang with juicy grapefruit and oranges with just a hint of pine. The middle transitions Hopslam to a nicely balanced maltiness with flavors of sugar coated grapefruit slices. The finish is all hops as those citrusy hops linger long on the tongue well after the swallow. Alcohol is very well hidden especially for a 9% abv beer.  Mouthfeel: Medium and nicely carbonated with a lively tingling in the mouth.  Drinkability: Hopslam is dangerously drinkable for a DIPA. A hopheads delight with big, juicy citrusy hops dominating the aroma and flavor profile but is still balanced with a good nice amount of malt. Alcohol is very well hidden in the flavor, though a nice warming of the face takes place after putting one of these back. If it wasn't for the 9%abv I could see making a session of these, instead I'll enjoy a couple and call it a night. A fantastic DIPA from the folks at Bell's.

287,17112,GnomeKing,4.59,"This beer should be served in a juice box (Buster Bluth, beware), it's so fruity and sweet and candy-like. Every sip is pure indulgence. The hop oil is so unami and rich that it's like bacon grease and kobe steak.  The aroma is confectioner's sugar and even cotton candy, but mostly deep red juice...I'm at a carnival.

The mouthfeel is airy and medium-bodied with prickly carbonation upfront. Resiny hoppy front. Citrusy hops and bitterness abound. An inhale reveals malt and an ample supply of alcohol on the tongue. There's some malt underneath all the hop bitterness in the flavor but it's severly overshadowed by the impressive amount of hops utilized. Juicy hop burps ensue.

According to the BJCP, slight haziness is allowable if it is dry hopped, but this is a bit more than that. It doesn't seem to clear with time either. There is a huge hop bouquet even from a distance. Very strong citrus aromas, especially grapefruit, but slightly more bitter. The flavor is amazing though. It is not nearly as bitter as the flavor would have led me to believe. It is a dead ringer for actual grapefruit flavoring. The bitterness is only in the background, and there is enough sweetness to back it up. This is a great example of an Imperial IPA (except the cloudiness); perhaps one of the best i've had.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",Imperial IPA,98

Big in your face slam of citrusy hops. Nothing too piney going on here. Not at all cloyingly sweet like some DIPA's I've had, but the sweetness is there. Taste is simple, yet fresh and inviting.  Thankfully, the mouthfeel and drinkablity of this beer are just as good. Served at the right temperature, this is the perfect blend of smooth body and light carbonation. Drinks much easier than the DFH 90, and less bitter than BBC's Professor Gesser. Eager to try this one out of the bottle.

287,17112,mjd83goblue,4.8,"12 oz bottle. Been getting 6pks for around $13-14. Pricey, but definitely worth it.  A: Pours a beautiful hazy orange with hints of amber, complete with Bell's patented suspended yeast bits. I dunno, just seems that they are the only brewer that has this look.  S: The freshest juiciest grapefruit I have ever smelled in a beer. Unlike anything else, SO fresh!  T: Once again slapped with sweet grapefruits. A touch of pine, but not as much as expected. A totally different beast than the west coast piney DIPAs. The sweetness from the malt base negate the typical bitterness you'd get from a grapefruit. A biting hop finish. Lingering bitter hops, but not overbearing. Just fantastic.  M: Creamy and smooth, nice carbonation. Not sticky at all. Quite crisp for the style.  D: Get excited every time I see more of it in the store. I had 5 of these last night, which is impressive for the style. Sometimes they get so sweet and sticky that I can't have more than 1 or 2. This one isn't like that. The booze catches up to you though. Ah well.  Even my girlfriend, who is usually a straight macro girl, liked this.

All-in-all, I would recommend, but it is definitely not the best DIPA I've had lately; both Leinenkugel's Big Eddy DIPA and Smuttynose Big A are better.  It poured a dark amber with acres of fluffy white head. Aroma is extremely hoppy and citrus-y. However, flavor was a bit different. It was somewhat grassy and astringent. While the flavor has some citrus-ness to it, it was quite dry. Think citrusness without sweetness.

It's like a piney citrus explosion in my nose, and I can't get enough of it. Truly a delicious scent. Reminds me of the 120 Minute in a way. Large and in charge. More beers should smell like this. The taste is great too. Fresh and hoppy, with pine, grapefruit, and pepper flavors. Noticeable alcohol presence here as well. Quite tasty indeed. Nice, smooth mouthfeel. Hoppy bitterness all down the back of the mouth and throat. Nicely done. I'm not surprised that it's over 9% ABV, but I wouldn't have guessed it. The alcohol is noticeable, as I said, but not overwhelming. This would pair nicely with a spicy Thai or Indian dish, and might even match up well with a strong blue cheese like Stilton.

But that doesn't mean this beer isn't out-and-out amazing. The nose is a wonderful mix of hops. That distinctive fruitiness of english hops, a strong earthy presence, and a blast of citrus. The taste follows the smell . . . but they are balanced. It isn't slap-you-in-the-face. This is absolutely fantastic.  Yeah, one of the best DIPAs I've ever had, and the only one I would classify as sessionable.

Mouthfeel: The beer feels heavy on the palate and that citric hop burst just sticks to the back of your mouth.  Drinkability: For the high ABV it is deceiving. I would definitely have Hopslam again.

The result is a golden-amber hued beer with minimal carbonation streams and a vibrant, sudsy head of just-this-side-of-white foam, sticky and thick. Juniper-infused citrus juice blend in the nose: grapefruit, satsuma, blood orange. A coy sugary sweet scent sneaks around underfoot. The taste of this IPA is B-I-G: big candied orange peel malts and big citric hop bitterness. Grapefruit pith and pinetar candy in the middle. Sweetroll breadiness at the finish. Substantial mouthfeel, slippery but not yet syrupy -- always a plus in my book -- with a slight pepperiness all around. Not bitter enough to be outstanding (I'm picky about this style), but this is without a doubt an extremely fine DIPA. Would buy again.

This is gonna wallop (er, slam) Taste isn't as big as I thought it would be, but that's a good thing. Smooth transition from citrus, to pine, to a bit of sweetness, to dry and crisp. The citrus is mostly pomelo, some lemon and grapefruit, a bit of orange perhaps. This slam isn't as menacing as it seems. Unlike the DFH 120, this one is plenty drinkable.

Good frothy white head and decent lacing. Taste matches the aroma- just an assault of fruits and hop flavour. No astringent bitterness whatsover. Just amazing- trust Bells to accomplish that. Along with the hops is a sweet malt back bone that gives a rich mouthfeel. I would say that this is a balanced DIIPA despite the hops. Exceptionally drinkable which would be very dangerous. I would love to try this on tap one day. Alcohol is absolutely hidden. Finish is a bit spritzy from the caronation but finishes clean somewhat bitter.

Body was medium-full with medium carbonation levels, and the beer coated the tongue.  HopSlam is Bell's hop concerto. As hop-centric as this ale is, it's still incredibly drinkable.

Forms an ample cream-colored head with massive amounts of lacing. A beaut!  S: Smells delicious too, you can tell there are centennial hops in this brew (and at 100+ IBUs, a lot of them). Strong sweet floral & grapefruit aromas, HopSlam makes my mouth water.  T/M: Not for the faint of heart, this is a massive DIPA, both in body, ABV & taste. Loads of sweet malts massage the tongue up front, only to quickly give way to a bruising level of juicy, bitter hoppiness. HopSlam is at once both thirst-quenching and hangover-inducing.  D: If I were say, inhuman, I would drink these all day and all night. Since I'm not, I'll say the reasonable limit is about 3-4 per night. Beyond that and you're risking severe intoxication, as this beer is far too easy to drink given it's 9.3-10% ABV.  Highly recommended, one of the few beers that absolutely lives up to its massive hype.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",Imperial IPA,98
287,17112,ArrogantB,4.23,12 oz bottle split with a buddy and poured into pint glasses. The color was a hazy orange with a small head. The smell was fruity and inviting. The taste was jam-packed with hops(what a surprise) but they were more fruity than bitter. The alcohol was perfectly hidden which made this go down quick. Very nice beer but I wouldn't buy it at $14 a sixer  01/23/2008 2008 batch  Excellent fruity flavors that dance across the tongue. This has a really awesome hop aroma and flavor.

Can't wait to taste it...  Ta: Huge hop flavor! Grapefruity in flavor as in aroma. Bold malt profile supports the huge hop blast. Finishes clean without being overly bitter. Good balance!  Mo: Medium bodied. Crisp & not at all cloying which I sometimes find in highly hopped beers. Carbonation perfect.  Dr: High. Not too cloyingly sweet or bitter. This has excellent balance which makes it highly drinkable.  Comments: I wish I had a case of this! Too bad Bell's doesn't distribute in MA. Truly well balanced DIPA.

287,17112,Chaz,4.42,"Poured into a Duvel tulip at below-ambient temperature. Two-fingered head is rocky, pale tan in color, and exhibits both good retention and ample lacing. Nose is all but phenomenal, with yeast, citrus, and ripe fruit notes (pineapple, cherry, plum). There's definitely a hint of alcohol on the nose as well, but it is all but overrun by the rich, oily lupulin qualities. Appears in the glass as a hazey, golden amber in color, with just a hint or auburn - this ale looks better than most beers taste! There's plenty of suspended yeast here, too, and this never bothers me (I'm particular that way I guess). The first sip is like an epiphany, with sweet pale and rich caramel malts coating the tongue, followed by the bittersweet interplay of hop and malt, an even sharper yet-aromatic hop bite, a dose of mildly pungent yeast, with a palate-searing bitterness capping off the brief encounter. The alcohol bite is all but obscured by the juicy, fruity malt and sharp, bitter, and herbaceous hops. The finish is quite dry, yet here the alcohol plays a part, elevating the aromatics and adding some heat to the ale's considerable body. The herbaceous quality of the hops is somewhat unyielding, and this tends to introduce a very tangible vegetal character into a style that can sometimes be rather refined. The citrus notes of the hops are grapefruit, orange, and lemon peel. There's some green grapeskin and a very light touch of mint as well. The alcohol becomes more prominent and warming about halfway through the pour, becoming hot and spicy. Mouthfeel is medium-full, with the body being just about perfect (at least to me), not too full with viscous malt ala a barleywine but full enough to give the warming alcohol and blazing hops a solid oak-tree of a backbone. Drinkability is likewise exceptional: a beer this strong, bitter, and insistent could be a real turn-off for those who prefer milder ales and pale lagers, but there's tremendous balance and finesse exhibited here, which is everything I'd expect from Bell's. Very much a sipping beer, and not one I'd care to drink more of two of in a sitting, but probably one that I'd like to stock a lot of in my cellar!  HopSlam is true to its name, and is among my top three favorites in the American Double IPA style.

287,17112,Schwarzbart,4.67,"Appearance: On draft at Kclinger's Tavern in Hanover, PA. It's like apricot nectar with a big, white, creamy head and awesome lacing.  Smell: Fruity, floral and hoppy. Fruits of grapefruit, apricot, lemon, lime and tangerine.  Taste: A nice fruit flavor of apricots and tangerine. The more I drink the more distinct a grapefruit flavor becomes. Great hops that are floral and slightly piney and the malts are mild. Alcohol is warm and is apparent, but not bad for 9.3%  Mouthfeel: Medium bodied and creamy.  Drinkability: Awesome for a double IPA.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",Imperial IPA,98
287,17112,AlexJ,5,"A very rare all 5-er for me, but this beers deserves that and more. A pale, hazed apricot colored pour wears a frothy white cap that lasts forever and leaves a thick crusting of lace on my goblet.  The aroma is like you are meditating in a Zen garden high in the crisp mountain air filled with fresh flowers and honeysuckle, all around you are tangerine, orange, lemon, and grapefruit trees, their leaves rustling gently in the breeze. Beneath their branches heavy with fruit grows a fragrent marijuana plant, it's buds bejeweled with powerdy crystals.  With the flavor continues the transcendent experience that is HopSlam. A complex and expertly assembled blend of magically complimentary flavors just explodes across your palate. It's aggressive hop character is tamed by the complex citrus, wildflower, golden malt toast, wildflower honey, and pungent yet fruity marijuana notes. I LOVE Double IPA's and there are very few that are on this level.  Body is perfectly medium with a soft mouthfeel like smooth flower petals with a creamy texture and lasting finish of complex hops. Insanely drinkable due to it's severe deliciousness and well hidden alcohol content.

287,17112,arguemaniac,4.1,"Pours an attractive, slightly hazy orange amber. The aroma reminds me of taking a whiff of a generous handful of citrusy hop pellets, but the nose also features a nice touch of slightly fruity malt sweetness as well. Hop bitterness and grapefruit citrus hop flavor dominate the palate from beginning to end, though its never to overbearing (at least not for a double IPA anyhow). But there is a good deal of malt sweetness, with definate notes of grain and fruit, to balance. The bitterness is particularly aggressive in the finish. The body is fairly full with a slight, but sharp carbonation tang. Quite drinkable for how rich it is, not to mention the 9% ABV.  Not the absolute best Double IPA out there, but its certainly up there. One thing that does stand out about this beer however is how well balanced everything; there is firm malty backbone to stand up against the intense hop profile, the sweetness of the malt itself isnt to sugary and the body is just thick enough to give the beer an extra rich character but not so thick that it diminishes the drinkability. Overall, highly recommended.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",Imperial IPA,98
287,17112,Risser09,4.16,"2006 Vintage - 12 oz bottle poured into a big wine glass at cellar temperature - About 45 degrees  Appearance: Vigorous pour yields a respectable bubbly, white head that stands 2 inches tall. Hazy golden orange beer is somewhat cloudy with some floating yeast. 5 minutes pass before the head receeds to a drinkable state. The lace won't let go of its grip on the side of my glass. No apparent carbonation from the bottom of the glass.  Smell: Bulbous and bursting with aroma. Perfect balance of pine and grapefruit. Swirling gives way to a shot of lupulin bitterness. Not as floral as other DIPAs.  Taste: Balanced and complex. Not as big of a hop bomb as I expected. There are malt backings in there. Pine hits me first and then fades into grapefruity bitterness. Mild earthiness and alcohol enter my nasal passages. They must have used several hop varieties for this handsome brew.  Mouthfeel: Sticky and sweet makes way for an alcohol burn and belly warmth. Carbonation is harsh and quickly fades. Smoothe and not drying.  Drinkability: Very good. Not the most impressive DIPA I've had, but a damn good one. I love the stillness and suspension of the floating particles. This is certainly worth enjoying whenever available, especially for hop heads. I'd say it's also worth buying a case per year upon release to take full advantage of the freshness.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",Imperial IPA,98

Appearance: Golden, crystal clear moderately carbonated ale with a well retained white head.  Scent: Almost pure grapefruit  I assume from a healthy dose of Cascade in the aroma addition. Only way to improve this would be to add a bit more complexity to the smell.  Taste: Fruity notes atop a delicious hop bitterness. The finish is clean with just enough residual bitterness lingering on the palate. The malts are indiscernible.  Mouthfeel: A bit thin when compared to the hop flavor, but this can be improved by resuspending the yeast into the beer.  Drinkability: Wonderful. I love the fact that this beer is like two in one. Without resuspending the yeast, it is a light bodied, heavily hopped intense IPA.

287,17112,weeare138,3.62,"I paid $16 for a 6 pack... Appears a glowing golden orange with a creamy, 1 finger white head that slowly fades into a mild cap. Lots of streaky lacing is left around the glass. What's this other mess going on? Tons of yeasty proteins and hop residuals floating in suspension with no visible signs of CO2. That doesn't look overly appealling. Smell is extremely herbal up front with hints of skunky mary jane, flowers, tea leaves, black pepper, citrus zest, pineapple, grapefruit, along with some biscuit. Taste...again, this strikes me as a very herbal brew moreso than a citrusy one. Flavors are highlighted by bitter herbs & spices, pine resin, grass, sweet citrus...hmmm. Mouthfeel is medium bodied, bitter, sweet up front, grassy, herbal... dare I say medicinal, or solvent? Alcohol is evident. Wow...based on this bottle, I'd be willing to vote this one as the most over-rated beer that I've had in '07. Last year, my vote went to Stone Oaked Bastard. This certainly isn't a terrible beer, it's just very overly hyped IMO and I'm not feeling the love. It sort of reminds me of a recent homebrew that I did, where I used a boat load of 6-7 different hops and hoped for the best. It turned out alright but a bit muddled, much like this with every aspect of hops being represented from herbal, to skunky, to citrus, etc. I just don't get it.

Aroma is a really nice blend of sweet, syrupy fruitiness with a resinous pine and floral hop aroma. The honey comes through a little, along with tropical fruit, lychee, etc.  Taste is also sweet and a touch malty at first but quickly turns into citrus, tropical fruit and pine hop flavors with some decent bitterness towards the end. Finishes fairly balanced, though.  This is a very drinkable beer, and hugely deceptive of its 9.3% ABV. I would certainly love to have a couple at a sitting.

287,17112,hammer09,4.25,"Being a hophead, I had high expectations for this beer. However, as I started to review the characteristics of Bell's Hopslam, I grew a little concerned.  Bell's Hopslam poured a very cloudy amber with little head development in my pint glass. The beer's cloudiness, looking like a dark version of a hefeweizen, seriously detracted from its overall appearance and the lack of any head development is too far from this beer's style.  Smell is SUPER hoppy and very astringent, almost ammonia-like. While I enjoy very hoppy beers, this was just too overpowering.  Given its aroma, I expected a harsh, bitter taste. However, this is where Hopslam changes in character, for the better. Overall taste is sweet with a major hop impact. While exhibiting a bitter hop character, the sweet, maltiness serves to balance the flavor of this beer. This is the perfect example where the sum of its parts (hops and malt) are greater than the whole.  Mouthfeel is strong, bitter, and dry, with excellent carbonation. Very satisfying.  While my initial reaction to appearance and smell was somewhat disturbing, this beer's flavor more than makes up for these other shortfalls. This is an excellent beer that I will purchase again without a second thought.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",Imperial IPA,98
287,17112,BEERchitect,4.63,"Icredibly smooth yet deceptively powerful, the beer's highly aromatic hops are balanced with honey for a true Midwest-style IPA, dressed up in imperial clothes. Its ease to see why Hopslam is among the best of all American beers.  Hopslam pours with a bright golden hue and the slightest of haze. The beer nearly sparkles in the glass. A very foamy head caps the beer with a white whipped topping, looking nearly like a meringue dessert. Strong retention and broken lace reaffirms the beer's substantial appearance.  Grapefruit and honey rise to the nose in such a scent that it seems like an array of citrus fruit has been dipped in honey. Savory and mouth whetting, the ale is rich and inviting throughout. Oranges, strawberries, and caramel malt play into the highly aromatic mix.  It's outrageous taste starts sweet with thin caramel malt and complex honey flavor. Citrusy ruby red grapefruit and tangerines begin to poke through the malty veil and adds a brightly flavored fruit note to the candied sweetness. Mild cannabis, marmalade, pine needles, and strawberry jam notes provide a slightly herbal and rosy taste that rides along side of the sharper citrus notes. The finish of honey and citrus bitterness is even keel and very very smooth. Its balanced taste a far cry from the usually preferred drier versions, but the honey-dipped notion here is something magical.  With the honey flavor on the palate, the beer provides a medium weighted texture to the mouth, but only a medium body because the honey plays lighter on the palate than malts do. Embedded carbonation gives a creamy feel early on. But as the carbonation settles out, the citrus infused malts saturate the middle palate and allows the hops to develop a deeply resinous dryness without gripping the throat with bitterness, excessive alcohol heat, or hop-derived astringency.  Hopslam is a culprit of many of the pitfalls that I warn against when it comes to hoppy American ales- its balance should not render the IPA-forward flavors in this positive of a manner. But its intangibles in taste and textures far exceed what's expected for the style and its overall flavor profile cannot be ignored.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",Imperial IPA,98
287,17112,Bitterbill,4.5,"Pours from 12oz bottle a cloudy orange with a smallish head of foam that quickly shrank and then left no trace.  The smell is a very hoppy with big notes of grapefruit.  The taste on first sip is certainly hoppy. Plenty of grapefruit hitting my palate and hitting it in a good way. I note a good malt presence that gives it a nice sweet counter to the hops. It seems to be in perfect balance.  Man, a few more sips in as it warms up a bit and the hops are now in almost total control and..I'm loving it. Oh wait, there goes that malt presence again; dang, just when you think the hop bitterness is going to take over completely, that malt comes back and yells at you. ;^) Even the finish, at various times, seems to alternate between hop bitterness and malt sweetness. I shake my head on how this could be so...  I appreciate DIPAs that are hop dominated and ones that have a good hop/malt balance and this one is an excellent example of the latter. I wouldn't hesitate to try HopSlam again. Not for a second. ;^)  Bottom line: Absolutely delicious.

Smell is strong and wild hop fist to the nose. Lots of sweetness and pineapple and pine in the aroma. This is quite spicy smelling with a lot of citrus and just plain fresh hop leaf aroma to it.  The taste begins strong and very hoppy with a strong melon flavor. Quite spicy and strong the strong melon taste hangs around. Lots of floral flavors in the aftertaste here it is almost perfumed. Through out this is a Super IPA that does not become harsh at all.  Mouthfeel is good.  Highly drinkable for the hopheads of the world. Very strongly hopped but very tasty.

Mouthfeel is also fantastic, thick and syrupy it coats the palate and you can still taste it long after.  Drinkability is good, if you like DIPAs, although it's pretty intense.

287,17112,Damian,4.5,"Drank from a 12 fl. oz. bottle  Thanks to my girlfriend Nari for bringing this one back from Ohio.  Poured a murky, glowing amber with a small, fizzy, off-white head that quickly faded. Some spotty drips of lacing trickled down the glass.  Smell was mild and had an almost medicinal-like quality initially. As the beer warmed, other aromas came out. Juicy, fruity, piney, grapefruit-like cascade hops along with sweet malts (a nice balance between bitter and sweet.) Some candi and brown sugars were also detectable.  The taste was also amazingly well balanced. Hoppy from start to finish with a solid malt backbone. Sweet, creamy malts up front before the hops kicked in. Intense, citrusy hops later took on a rich and potent grapefruit-like quality on the back end. Finish was clean, crisp and moderately dry, yet refreshing.  Body was medium to full for the style, with a super rich and creamy mouthfeel that felt like a blanket on my tongue.  Drinkability of this beer was outstanding. Unlike most DIPA's, the aromas and flavors in this one did not slap me in the face. Additionally, the 9.3% ABV was barely noticeable.

Aromatics are fairly pungent with a big grassy, mossy note preluding the bursting citrus profile. The earthy, leafy accent is almost funky and hints at a heavy dose of dry-hopping. A heavy tangerine wave followed by pear juice and candied grapefruit round out the nose. The mouthfeel is lightish but still sticky and crisp. The palate is fairly dry, with loads of zesty citrus and hints of spruce. Mangoes, orange zest, apricots, and melons come to mind, and a extremely light malt character is key to the balance.

The hops start slowly with a light citrus flavor, it then it gradually becomes more pronounced as it reaches every taste bud on the palate. A light feel on the tip of the tongue, but it gains heftiness as it flows towrds the back of the throat.

The beer is hazy, with lots of floaties. You can practically see the hop oil in this one, boy am I pumped!  The aroma is nothing short of a pungent hop bomb. Citrus, pine, fresh earthy pine, grass and sweet pineapple barely allow a bit of malt character creep through. This is a hop head delight!  Pink grapefruit and pineapple flirt with the sweet malt backbone. Again, the senses are treated to an abundance of pine and hop bitterness. The hop flavors are so fresh and poignant that one would think this to be a product of Randall The Enamel Animal. Amazingly, this gem comes from a bottle.

287,17112,neonbrown82,4.79,"Holy crap! I absolutely love this beer! Without a doubt the best IPA I've had. I can't wait until it hits Iowa City, if indeed it does (it's supposed to). Many thanks to my roommate, Dave (Hoptongue) for bringing this back home from his most recent beer excursion. Even though he probably isn't reading this... douche.  Anyways... The beer pours to a nice clear golden yellow color, only a slight haze to it. Nice pillowy white head with a spotty lace. Carbonation is moderate, as is head retention.  I can smell the hops in this beer from a mile away. That being said, there is plenty of malt to bring it back to balance without being overly sticky and sweet, such as something like Goose Island IIPA. A boatload of centennial, plus maybe amarillo or one or more of the newer high alpha strains such as simcoe. In any case, it has a huge grapefruit, orange, and tangerine aroma. Quite floral as well. Plenty of specialty malt behind it. Caramel, aromatic and pale. A bit bready. Even a hint of lemon zest. Reminds me of Two Hearted on crack, acid, and speed, and probably some other drugs I've never heard of.  The taste is every bit as satisfying. Has the same elements of the nose, but it is neither too sweet and sticky nor too bitter. Just the P-E-R-F-E-C-T balance. It's almost like drinking a carbonated Naked/Odwalla juice, but much dryer and thinner, and definitely more crisp. The aftertaste lingers forever with the perfect hop flavor.  The body is quite thick, though fairly dry and crisp. The carbonation is gentle on the palate, however. If this beer is really 9.3% it doesn't even come close to drinking like it. More like 6% in terms of drinkability. I could easily put down a six pack of this in a night, but it would be quite expensive, and I'm sure the alcohol would eventually catch up with me despite it seeming so easy to drink.

287,17112,ColForbinBC,4.35,"Presentation: 12 oz bottle, batch 7690  A slightly cloudy golden color. Little bits of yeast floating. Thick white head, over an inch thick that settles to leave a prominent lace.  Big time grapefruit, pineapple, and pine needles.  Very heavy grapefruit, pineapple flavor. Big and bold hop presence. Waves and waves of juicy tropical fruit. Some dry pine needles in the finish, but really just uppercuts of hops with each sip.  Medium feel, smooth but with chewy hops. Enjoyable.  The 9% is not to be taken lightly. This is easily drinkable, but the abv can sneak up on you.  A very well-crafted dipa that really introduced me to the big boys of the style.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",Imperial IPA,98
287,17112,westweasel,4.37,"This beer pours out an attractive apricot-straw color that is likely cloudy from all of the hop resins. It was covered with about a half-inch of white head, that left belgian lace all the way down the glass.  This beer has a wonderful hop nose with intense scents of lemon and grapefruit. The taste is an excellent example of a double IPA with a strong malt backbone holding up under strong bitterness. There is a strong lemon and grapefruit taste mixed in with caramel and a bready, buttermilk biscuit flavor.  The mouthfeel is definitely full with a bitter finish.  This beer is pretty drinkable - even with the strong bitterness. It might be hard to drink more than two though.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",Imperial IPA,98
287,17112,kmcnair,4.47,"Aroma - Huge sharp citrus hops jump right out of the glass. Tangerine, grapefruit, orange, very well established hop character. Well done, very pleasant and meets all the marks for an Imperial IPA  Appearance - Slightly cloudy, pale coppery hue, makes a faint offwhite persistent head.  Flavor - American hops are dominant with citrus fruity hop esters. Bitterness is assertive yet balanced. Malt character is subdued, yet strong enough to not be completely drowned out by the hop intensity. Clean, dry finish with a long lasting pleasant hop bitterness.  Mouthfeel - Medium-light bodied, mildly astringent, medium-high carbonation. Smooth alcohol warming on the palate.  Overall Impression - This is a well crafted imperial IPA. The malty backbone is appropriately overshadowed by intense citrusy hop character. This is crisp, well attenuated and refreshing. Nicely done!",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",Imperial IPA,98

S: Big, heady sweet malt aroma, followed by loads of citrusy/spicy hops. A wonderfully sweet & completely appetizing smell...  T: Yes, loads of piney & citrusy hops, but with ample sweet barley/grain malty sweetness. Oh man, so well balanced - a juicy citrus burst of oranges & grapefruit wrapped within a caramel malt blanket. Really wonderful.  M: Has some syrupy sweetness and a little bit of stickiness, but a full & carbonated mouthfeel, minimal clinging hop bitterness, and overall a rounded fullness. Overall, this is rich, full and somewhat viscous.  D; Fantastic brew overall. This is a Double IPA I could come back to again & again. Highly recommended!

287,17112,FtownThrowDown,4.15,"I can't believe I haven't reviewed this yet. I've drank so much of this stuff! Poured into my Dogfish Head pint glass. Pours a golden amber color with a slight 1/2 inch head. Plenty of suspended ""flakies"" in the glass. Plenty of very good lacing is left on the glass. Smell is of citrus hops and just a tad of piney hops. Taste is incredibly juicy. A refreshing taste that has plenty of hop presence. It's just a tad bitter, but it's so juicy that it's balanced well. This is a very easy drinking beer. You don't even notice the alcohol at all. This is a highly sessionable beer. As I've drank many of these on several occasions. This is another great beer from Bells. This is worth seeking out.

287,17112,beermanbrian,3.99,"Cloudy golden color with white head and modest amount of carbonation. Smell is a burst (or slam) of hops and as expected the taste follows suit. Lots of pine is noticable at first. Very resinous mouthfeel, almost sticky. Finished with grapefruit bitterness and some burn from the ABV hops combination. Not what i would call highly drinkable but certainly fits the bill for a DIPA.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",Imperial IPA,98
287,17112,phisig137,4.19,"Pours a slightly hazy 18 karat gold color, with a thin one finger head. Decent retention leaves behind a bit of lacing. Looks innocent, and doesn't prepare you at all for the...  Aroma, which is massively hoppy, dominated by huge citrus scented hops, a bit of piney hops, and more citrusy hops. It smells so hoppy that you can almost sense the bitterness in your nose.  Flavor here is again, purely hoppy. This brew tastes almost devoid of malt, although you know it's there from the 9.3%. Hops are the showcase, somewhat piney up front, and then pure grapefruit bitterness on the finish. Once you've swallowed, the grapefruit sears the tip of your tongue, and lasts for a LONG time. Mouthfeel is creamy, and fairly light, with medium carbonation. Drinkability is quite good.... you don't sense that 9.3% until the last few sips of the glass.  Another solid beer from Bell's. This reminds me of a more grapefuity version of Ruination. Personally, for a DIPA, I'd like to have a little more crystal malt flavor/body, but this is just fine the way it is. I'll be buying this again, assuming that I can still find it around town. Highly recommended.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",Imperial IPA,98
287,17112,treedoctor5002,5,"Two thoughts:Nectar of the Gods and Grapefruit Juice from heaven. That is what this beer is like. I love the total package. Very artfully crafted. The hops are HUGE! But, they're hidden behind a masterfully built malt base. Lots of citrus, pine and honey flavors going on here. What a great combination. A hopheads dream? I think so! The finest beer that I've tasted so far to date.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",Imperial IPA,98
287,17112,Budlum,3.93,"Pouring this beer produces a huge, foamy white head of about two inches in a pint glass. Head rentention is excellent throughout the entire glass. The body is a very hazy amber color with a ton of what I assume are hop particles floating around.  The smells is all delicious hops. The aromas start sharp and bitter but soon open up with a pleasant sweetness. The smell is strong with citrus, pineapple and pine sap throughout.  A brief rush of honey flavored sweetness gaces the tongue before an atomic bomb of hop flavors hit. The hop flavors are very sharp and bite at the tongue with a hot pepper feel. The hops do include a very balanced, earthy flavor where most of this style goes overboard. The finish is very long with lingering hop bitterness. This beer is definitely not for the rookie.  The mouthfeel is slightly buttery but leans more towars a syrup-like feel. Carbonation would be greatly appreciated and add a very unique feel for this beer.  Drinkability is good. The explosion of hop flavors is enjoyable and easy enough to drink quickly but I still think one of these per session would be enough. I just wish I could've found this closer to its release.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",Imperial IPA,98
287,17112,jmalex,4.53,"I bought a single bottle of this and brought it home only to find it was just half full. After swapping it back at the store, I brought a full one back to drink and review.  APPEARANCE: Pours a very hazy golden orange color with a small head that dissipates quickly. A small collar and a few patches of lace last until the end. A great deal of suspended sediment is seen floating all throughout the glass.  SMELL: Surprisingly not too intense. The nose is full of a sweet floral hop aroma. Not much else is detectable. Somewhat underwhelming for a double IPA.  TASTE: Wow! The taste, on the other hand, is very intense and complex, yet amazingly not overbearing. It starts out with a nice malt presence, but piny, citrusy, and floral hops quickly begin to dominate. Amazing hopiness! These flavors last through the entire taste and even intensify and become more pronounced until it's gone. The aftertaste is very clean and leaves no offensive flavors behind.  MOUTHFEEL: Smooth and goes down easy. Medium to light bodied and pretty much spot on.  DRINKABILITY: Exceptional. I should've gotten a 6 pack, because I'd definitely have another. And at 9.3% ABV, this beer can definitely be considered ""dangerously drinkable"".  This beer surprised me a lot. I expected a thick, malty, over-the-top beer like I'm used to with double IPA's. But instead I got a balanced, flavorful, and easy drinking beer that I'll be seeking out again. Thankfully I have all 12 ounces to enjoy tonight.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",Imperial IPA,98
287,17112,Vancer,4.48,"Reflecting on the $12 price for a sixer ($2 bucks a bottle), this really is not an overpriced brew. This puppy is loaded with a quality taste, and packs an alcohol punch.  Hazy amber orange pour with a creamy, thick, and lacey ivory head. Aromas chock full of pine, grapefruit, and floral citrus. Very sharp and crisp hopsicle goodness in every sip. Lots of dead yeasty solders at the bottom - they were tasty.  The dryness surprised me, expected more oils in the texture. The old age Beamster cheese from Amsterdam paired like a champ with this one.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",Imperial IPA,98
287,17112,MICAMD,4.97,"There was a lot of hype surrounding the release of this beer, and for good reason. This has quickly become one of my top beers and it never disappoints.  A- Quite a bit of sediment in the bottle. Trying to decant this beer leaving the sediment in would be almost pointless due to the immense amount of floaties. The beer is luminiscent, almost seeming to glow a little bit. Beautiful orange and coppery looking with a perfect thin head that leaves lacing down the entire glass.  S- The best smelling beer I have ever encountered. Grapefruit, orange, pineapple. Sweet, but not too much. Good malt backing. This is not just hopwater. Much like the Two Hearted, I wish this came in an air freshener.  T- Wow. Just like the smell, but a little bit more kick in the end. Very complex. One of those beers you just want to keep in your mouth for awhile before swallowing it. The beer improves greatly as it gets closer to room temperature.  M- Very creamy and smooth, until the end where the bitterness of the hops makes its presence. There is a little bit of kick to it, but not like you would expect from a typical DIPA. A little dry in the finish, but nothing feels out of place.  D- Amazing. 9+%? This beer has ruined me for other DIPA's. Nothing else stands up anymore.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",Imperial IPA,98
287,17112,WeisGuy,4.4,"Finally getting around to putting my review into the system.  a - amber color, good deal of haze/sediment, two-to-three finger white head with decent retentino and great lacing  s - lots of tropical/citrus fruits, pineapple, grapefruit, some piney hops as well, only slight hint of alcohol  t - big hop flavor up front with sweet pineapple and grapefuit, not one dimensional as there is a slight malt backbone, but the hops are on showcase here, finish is big, long, and bitter, not much evidence of alcohol  m - medium-bodied, moderate carbonation, pretty dry finish from all the IBUs  d - if not for the higher abv, this would be supremely drinkable, you don't really notice the alcohol until you get up after drinking a few  This brew lived up to all the hype for me, and more. I didn't expect it to be as drinkable as it was, and while hops are the main character, this definitely isn't a one trick pony. While this isn't quite on the level of Dreadnaught, it certainly is one of the top DIPAs I have tried.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",Imperial IPA,98
287,17112,RonfromJersey,4.8,"Hazy, cloudy orangey sunset body, slowly drifting carbonation streams, topped by three fingers of various assorted sized bubbles. Excellent lacing.  Incredibly inviting enticing aroma of pineapple, grapefruit, pine trees, and oranges. A beer you can sniff without picking it up.  A good solid chewy malt blockhouse, something forgotten in some DIPAs, gets the taste buds started. Quickly though, its juicy hops exploding all around. Bitter, bracing, cleansing, fruity, tingly - just about everything you could ask for, all melded into a solidly constructed though naturally unbalanced beer.  Mouthfeel is just fine - big but not too thick, it rolls through nicely.  Drinkability is good as it gets. Beer's gone way too fast.  An exception DIPA - malt, tons of hops, and the alcohol never intrudes...until maybe later. Highly recommended. No regrets buying this by the case.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",Imperial IPA,98
287,17112,zeff80,4.87,"A - Pours out a copper color with a large, foamy white head. Leaves lacing.  S - Smells of grapefruit, some honey, pine and bubblegum sweetness. There is a mild caramel nose, too.  T - Big hoppy bitterness but not puckering because the honey mellows things out. It has a great grapefruit taste from the hops and some sweet caramel maltiness to accompany it.  M - It is crisp and sharp. A medium-bodied DIPA that is SO easy to drink..  D - An amazing beer. I've never had a beer with such a strong hop preence matched by a strong sweet presence until now.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",Imperial IPA,98

Smell is amazing... I can smell it from two feet away. Definitely all hops, mostly citrus (grapefruit) and slightly of pine. The taste is similar to the nose, obviously mostly hops. I have to disagree with those who say the alcohol isn't noticeable. Don't get me wrong, it is a great tasting beer for 9.3%, but it is noticeable. The mouthfeel is actually quite a bit lighter than I had anticipated and has a creamy consistency. This is a wonderful beer by Bell's and aside from the fact that it does have a substantial ABV, it is a very drinkable beer.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",Imperial IPA,98
287,17112,Monkeyknife,4.36,"Poured in to a pint glass. A hazy, coppery-orange with a small head which quickly fades.  The aroma hits you right away with lots of floral hops and grapefruit.  Hops, more hops, and grapefruit are wonderfully balanced.  Carbonated to the point of almost being fizzy.  What a great beer. Very easy to enjoy.

287,17112,adammills,3.42,"I poured this beer into a pint glass to find a body copper in color and cloudy. It is capped with a two finger head that had some staying power. It leaves chunks of foam on the sides of the glass as you drink. The aroma is outrageous, truly amazing. At first it was all strawberry to me, then some mango and other citrusy notes. Complex and wonderful in aroma. It is a great tasting beer! A citrusy sweetness backed with solid bittering hops. A tad acidic in its bitterness in the end. It is well carbonated and smooth in the mouth. There may be the slightest alcohol warming going on at the end, but I tend to think that it is the spiciness from the hops. Very drinkable, very crisp. Amazing the way the 9% is hidden, very. Excellent beer.  Edit 2/5/09  A: Deep golden to copper. 3/4 inch off white head with fine bubbles that form a rather rocky cap.  S: Grapefruit, sweet almost strawberry, with a touch of grassyness that is appropriate to style. Classic American hop aroma, excellent.  T: Clean hop bitterness is the initial driving force. Following that is what seems to me to be a sweetness that is not quite cloying, but gets in the way of the hop showcase. Citrusy hop flavor coats the mouth. Hop resins coat the mouth.  M: Medium light body, alcohol is present it helps to balance the beer. Another balancing agent is the resinous hops. Appropriate moderate carbonation levels.  D: This beers only drawback is that the impression of too much residual sugar dings this beer in its drinkablity.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",Imperial IPA,98
287,17112,Imstillthegman,4.77,"Pours out a semi-cloudy orange with some floaties. Fingers worth of white head that leaves just faint lacing. Those particles stay suspended until I drink them...only a few have settled on the bottom.  Aroma of fresh citrus hops only gets better as it warms up. I'm picking up some fruits I have never really noticed in hoppy beers like pineapple and papaya. It reminds me of tropical fruit salad.  This is a DIPA all the way. No cloying sweetness as some others have. Just enough malt to barely notice it in the background. Nicely bitter but not ""squint you eyes and pucker up"" bitter. I find all the fruits I noticed in the aroma making an appearance in the flavor. Citrus stand hops are present from beginning to end.  Very smooth and easy to drink for a DIPA. The abv , although it's over 9%, isn't noticeable and that's impressive. Larry did one hell of a job on this one. Now, can we get him to make this one a bit more frequently?",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",Imperial IPA,98
287,17112,BuckeyeNation,4.89,"Radiant ripe tangerine with a sparse cloud of fine particulates and a few larger flakes that I hope are hop leaves (the beer murks up considerably with the final pour). The tight-bubbled cap is ivory in color with a faint orange tint picked up from the beer beneath. While there's nothing spectacular about the appearance, it's definitely solid.  The nose is amazing! How in the world does Bell's create beer that smells like hop juice? The aroma is one of the brightest and most purely citric that I've ever experienced in a beer of this style. In addition to orange and grapefruit, pineapple and other assorted tropical fruits burst out of the glass. I'm betting that Amarillo and/or Simcoe are members of the hop bill, along with one or more of the C-hops.  HopSlam is a DIPA as DIPAs were meant to be. In other words, it's a jacked-up, hopped to the gills, high-ABV IPA. There's no caramel malt to contend with and no way to confuse what's in my glass with an American barleywine. I knew Larry wouldn't let us hopheads down. As Two Hearted has proved for years, the man knows his way around a hop cone.  Where to start? The sugar cookie-like pale malt backbone is just big enough and no bigger. It provides a firmness and a solidity that is barely able to withstand the lupulin assault. I think fresh Two Hearted is more witheringly hoppy, but it's a close call. Even so, the 106 IBUs are easy to believe. How can a beer this powerful be this mellow?  Whatever the hop bill consists of, I approve in a big way. I tried my best to determine which varieties are used, to no avail. I don't care if Mr. Bell wants to keep the specific ingredients a secret, as long as he continues to brew this hop nectar; year-round would be preferable. Bitter orange zest, white grapefruit pith, pineapple... they're all still present and accounted for. I haven't had a more drinkable DIPA in a very long time.  The mouthfeel isn't quite as full or as viscous as one might expect for an ale that weighs in at nearly 10%. It's amazingly velvety smooth, though, and I think I prefer it just as it is. In fact, the mouthfeel is one of the biggest reasons why the beer is so damn downable. It's hard to believe that 10 of the 12 ounces have disappeared so far.  HopSlam is a grand slam of a DIPA. It may not be the biggest, the hoppiest, or the most bitter version that I've ever let flood my taste buds, but it's one of the most drinkable. Anyone who considers hops to be the soul of beer, as I do, owes it to himself to seek this one out. I am in awe.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",Imperial IPA,98
287,17112,kajerm,4.7,"tasted from what may be my last bottle of hopslam ever while watching the playoff game, brewing a batch of hazelnut brown, and tasting with friends. I'm deeply grateful my friend was willing to sacrifice two bottles of hopslam for the tasting-- bell's is becoming precious here in illinois...  pours a semi-opaque orange-brown with an unremarkable head. it looks nice but it smells nicer, pounding your face in with hops-- in a good way. I couldn't pick out individual aromas because the whole place smelled like beer, but I was definitely impressed with the unique tropical, fruity hop selection-- it's nice to smell (and taste) something besides Cascade.  flavor is outstanding; this is the American Double IPA style done right, and it ties with Goose Island's Imperial IPA for the best I've ever tasted. it's bitter as hell, of course, but not wincingly so and larry bell has managed to bring out more subtle flavors from the hops than pure alpha acids. fruity hops dominate, but you knew what you were buying when you read the label, right?  it has a nice light mouthfeel which, along with the neatly-balanced fruit and bitterness serves to hide the alcohol and make this beer a certifiable public health risk at 9%ABV.  fantastic beer, I'm thrilled it's become a seasonal.  RERATE: OK, so I managed to score another bottle-- thanks, Capone's. Unremarkable head? What the ass was I thinking?!

287,17112,terrabyte,4.38,"Pours a heavily clouded, dark orange-amber color with a small white head that quickly disappears.  Aroma is an understated, grapefruit-hop smell. There is a small amount of sweet lemon that lends a light, airy texture to the aroma.  Flavor is definitely based on a grapefruit hop taste. A nice, stinging bite of bitterness expands in the aftertaste also. Other than that, though, this beer is not over the top. It is well balanced, and quite enjoyable.  Mouthful is slightly over-carbonated, but crisp, cold and refreshing. Only a slight amount of stickiness and thickness from the hops. Impossible to guess the high ABV, it seems completely masked.  Drinkability is high for such a highly hopped, high ABV beer. It also doesn't make your tongue feel stripped-wax from the grapefruit hops either, like many others showcasing this style do.  Although this is an enjoyable beer, I'm not sure it's worth the premium price. I could just as easily enjoy Lake Louie's Kiss the Lips for less money, or pay even more to enjoy the ultimate IPA in Goose Island's Imperial IPA. Your mileage may vary, however, since I usually don't seek out over-hopped beers.

Aroma is hops right away mostly west coast citrus bursting thru, floral that is probably more so the sweet caramel malts I smell under the hops then floral hops. Also hints of pine appear after the pour settles some. After yeast is dumped some earthiness appears in the aroma.  Taste is nice carbonation hitting with plenty of bitterness and hop oil mixed in for instant Humulus Lupulus fix. Sweet malts are also noted from the start and last thru out until the finish trying to balance the hops but not quite getting there. Nice I2PA decent malt backdrop for loads of hops one of the better ones I have had but then again hard for me to knock a big IPA as I love hops. What one would expect form Bell's a great brew, now why can't I buy this in NC. Finish with yeast is lingering hops bitterness along with nice dry dirt and sweet hints of malt.  Mouthfeel is a solid medium might be a touch more seems that lots of carbonation to aide the hop bite on my tongue but not fizzy.

Loads of grassy hops up front. Some citrus flavor, grapefruit and lemon. As with the aroma, this beer is rather sweet.  This beer is full bodied and aggressive. It goes down surprisingly smooth, leaving a sweet grassy aftertaste. Carbonation is right on.  This beer would probably not be the best session beer. It is high in alcohol, and aggressive.

Poured into a Rogue pint glass  Appearance is good. Dark orange color with haziness. Small amount of yeast on the bottom of the glass. Barely any head or lacing.  Smell is very good. Citrus hops and semi-sweet tangarine. Images of walking through a field of hops and citrus fruits come to mind.  Taste is very good. Same as the smell but much more intense. The hop bill is extremely well done in this DIPA. Bittering and citrus hops are everywhere here. The malts give off a great semi-sweet after-taste. Well balanced yet the hops dominate, which is how a DIPA should be, imo.  Mouthfeel is very good. This beer dances over the tongue and cheeks like a thing of beauty. Carbonation is almost perfect.  Drinkability is very good, as well. I can kill at least 3 bottles in one sitting.  Overall: An amazing beer from an amazing brewery. Right up there with some of the best West Coast DIPA's. Highly recommended.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",Imperial IPA,98

S- Sweet citrus with piney hops  T- Holy sh!t this is what I want in a DIPA, hops that tear my tastebuds out and body slam them. Its been a while since I've had an IPA that could do that, thought I had grown some sort of tolerance, guess thats not so.  M- Oily with almost no carbonation.  D- I could make this my everyday beer, but I might be limited to 2. Really this is an amazing beer which I wish was available in my area.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",Imperial IPA,98
287,17112,Tyrawlings,4.25,Poured from the tap and into a pint glass.  A: Hazy deep orange beer with a white half fingered head that quickly dissolves into a beautiful sticky lacing that crawls all over the glass.  S: Huge juicy floral hop bouquet. Citrus and pine sap.Caramel or toffee undertones.  T: Juicy hops dominate the fisrt sip. Fresh grapefruit and the sweet taste of peaches are followed by a puckering hop bite. Pine resin and caramel malts try to give your tongue a break but are beaten back by more hops.  M: Thick and syrupy. Minimal carbination. Slick or oily finish.  T: Juicy hop heaven. There is alot going on in this brew but it tasty none the less. Even though the hops dominate this beer it is balanced enough to enjoy. A savory treat!,Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",Imperial IPA,98

If you are not a fan of DIPAs but want to increase your ability to judge other styles of beers this is a DIPA to start with. No doubt about the hops in this beer.

287,17112,kcillini77,4.54,"I've been trolling the site for a couple of years and am a founding member of the magazine, but only my second review. Forgive me if amateur in nature  A - Pours a pale color with a creamy, large head in my Duvel glass  S - Smells of hops, hops, and more hops. Heaven in a glass.  T - First notes are of apricot, grapefruit, and bitter hops, followed by a warming, semi-sweet alcohol taste. Alcohol is not overwhelming, but noted. Citrus is prominent but not out of place.  M - Slightly syrupy, but not sticky. Feels smooth, and goes down that way too.  D - The alcohol content and syrupy nature prevent this from being sessionable, but still a very fine beer to drink.  Most expensive sixer I have ever purchased, but a bargain compared to $3.50-$5 for a pint of semi-decent beer at a bar.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",Imperial IPA,98
287,17112,Grundle20,4.6,"Appearance: A big sticky white head crowns off a slightly hazy copper pour. The head displays some rather good retention with patchy lacing.  Smell: HOPSLAM!!! The scent of this beer should be a Street Fighter character, because it kicks ass and makes its presence known. It's simply ripe with oily pine and apricot hop notes with a mild candy sweetness. Superb scent to me.  Taste and Mouthfeel: The HOPSLAM!!! exits out a bit here to usher in more of a malt balance which is great for both the mouthfeel and the flavor. The hops are slick and resinous as they wash over the back of my palette but surprisingly mostly devoid of bitterness. The alcohol perks up a little mid drink after an initial malt sweetness. The hopping here is superb since there is a maximization of flavor vs. bitterness, something which I have found to be rare in DIPA. The malt body mixes well with the oily hop quality to create a very full and smooth mouthfeel overall. The finish is a little piney but the aftertaste is pretty clean given the amount of oomph packed in to this beer.  Drinkability: The only thing against this beer is that it's a DIPA and thus it's a 4-pack kind of beer since the ABV is getting up there. It's certainly not made for extended drinking. This one's a highly enjoyable sipper though.  Bottom Line: I see this compared to things such as the Dreadnaught, GI IIPA, and Ruination and I really find it to be considerably different from those fine offerings. It's more oily and certainly packing more hop flavor vs. a malt sweetness. I tell you what though, Bell's knows how to brew an American IPA.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",Imperial IPA,98
287,17112,blitz134,3.55,"Interesting color, kinda breaks away from the typical DIPA look. Pale yellow color (not quite as pale as Victory's HopWallop). Slightly cloudy, but was clear before the dregs came out. Now it has large chunks of yeast in it. White head, 1/2"" initially, now a sporadic mess on top. Lace grabs the glass.  Pine, pine resin, and grapefruit. I like this aroma profile, hints at lots of true bitterness and not the sweet floral aromas many DIPAs have. Also has an certain strange aromatic that I'm not quite used to, kind of a musty straw perhaps. Overall lots of hops and really no hints at any malts.  Interesting flavor, kinda similar to HopWallop again. Definately lacks a malty undertone and is mostly hops. A good bit of resiny pine and that same musty straw again. This is all okay to me, definately a different take on a DIPA that most brewers don't go for. I just don't care for this one quite as much. Overall unbalanced.  Lacks body in my opinion, probably due to the lack of malting. Kinda thin overall. Okay drinkability. This one just doesn't do it for me, and I'm not quite sure why it is garnering the reviews it is getting.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",Imperial IPA,98
287,17112,badbeer,4.18,"Excellent looking beer here, blonde color with a white head that has great retention and leaves plenty of lacing. Smell is very nice too, plenty of pine and fresh grapefruit to treat your nose. Taste was very hoppy, as expected. Flavors of grapefruit, pine, various other citrus flavors were also noticed. Bitterness was certainly present, but not a harsh bitterness, was more about hop flavor than IBU's. Medium body with a medium carbonation pair quite well with this one. Very solid beer, I would definitely have another, wish I picked up more than a single.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",Imperial IPA,98
287,17112,bjohnson,4.92,"Big thanks to hoppymeal for this initial stock.  A: Pours a very cloudy amber peach color with a half finger white head. Dissipates quickly leaving retention around the edges of the tulip glass. Excellent lacing down the glass. S: Extra big pine and fresh grapefruit notes. Its as if I just stuck my nose in a grapefruit rind and ran through a pine sap forest. Accentuating notes of peach and apricot. A hop bomb if Ive ever seen one. Good level of sweet malt notes when you swirl the glass around. Chewy and resiny. Big and bold. I cant stop smelling this beer and smiling. T/M: Grapefruit, apricot, orange peel flavors all splash across the tongue. Chewy and oily on the palate as if hop juice was squeezed right onto my tongue. Bitterness across the palate, but not overly pronounced and it only slightly lingers in the aftertaste with a bit of sourness. Maltyness is there, but is lapped by the hops--the malt smooths everything out. Very nice mouth feel on this brew with a slightly dry aftertaste. Medium to above average body. D: Wow. Amazingly drinkable and smooth for the high abv that this brew toutsabv goes unnoticed and is masked completely by the huge hop flavors. Bitterness could be a bit more pronounced and the sourness in the aftertaste was a bit surprising.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",Imperial IPA,98

287,17112,AltBock,4.4,"12 oz. bottle with a green label that makes it quite noticeable on your local beer store shelves. The picture on the label is that of a man wearing blue jeans and sneakers being crushed by 3 big green hop buds. I bet when he woke up that morning that he didn't think he was going to get crushed by giant hops that day. You'll also notice that the man has very hairy arms. That got me thinking that the man under the giant hops is either Robin Williams or Tony Shalhoub. Bell's isn't going to say because then they would have to pay rights to them for using their picture, even though more than half of their body is under giant hops. On the back is another green label with a mini paragraph about the beer and a Batch ID #. Mine was 7690 and that means according to Bell's website that it was packaged on October 25, 2006. It's initial release was October 20th, 2006. That might mean that mine was one of the first or second batches of HopSlam bottled.  Appearance: The color of this beer is very interesting. It is an orange color no doubt, but it's more of a light cloudy tangerine orange color. I think I came close to the color of this beer by calling it a cloudy tangerine orange color. You have to see it for yourself. The head of foam was a little bit more desired, but I don't care, I like the color. All I got was just a small plume of white foam that dissipated into a small trace of white rings and lace around the glass. Every time I look at it just sitting there in my Great Lakes Christmas Ale Snifter, I just can't help but notice it's wonderful tangerine orange color.  Smell: It had a pleasant aroma of citrus fruits, citrus hops, and at the end was a jumble of tropical fruits. It was hard to tell what type of tropical fruits or even citrus fruits for that matter. They blended in nicely with the citrus hops. No malt in this aroma party, this is strictly a hoppy/fruity aroma party. So get out of here malts!  Taste: Bell's called this beer Hop Slam, so I kinda expected to be bombarded with hops, hops, and even more hops. That wasn't the case with this beer. It had plenty of citrus fruits and citrus hops in the beginning, but that then gave way to tropical fruits. Unlike the aroma, I could actually pick out the varieties of tropical fruits. The 2 tropical fruits I could pick out that I knew what they were was pineapple and mangos. Yes, even Pineapple! I believe there were more tropical fruits, but I am unfamiliar with those types. It was more of a fruit slam than hop slam, but that's OK, I like good surprises when it come to beer.  Mouthfeel: Huh, 9.30% ABV for this beer? Where was it? I couldn't smell, taste, or even feel it for that matter. Besides that, there was little aftertaste to this beer. I guess the tropical/citrus fruit party was over. It was time that they all just get and leave without a trace or even goodbye.  Drinkability: It was so good, that I don't care (maybe a little for the sake of my cash flow) that it costs $15 for a six pack. You pay the money for a top notch quality brew. Instead IMO they should have called this fruit slam or fruit explosion. There was more fruit than hops in this beer. This is another beer that seems to disappear into thin air because it's so good. This is another (I know there are many) Bell's beer you should try at least once.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",Imperial IPA,98
287,17112,NoLiberty,4.23,"App: Pours from a 12 oz. bottle with a delightfully playful and vibrant label, truly representative of the unique characteristics of this double IPA. The body is clear and bright, tangerine, orange in color and topped by a chunky white head that clings to the edges of the glass. Beautiful. Obviously nice carbonation before ever putting glass to mouth.  Aroma: Damn, almost more like tropical fruit punch more than IPA - pineapple, orange, pine, quince, apple. Nice. Big nose but certainly not too overpowering. Some slight malt character and alcohol, but only as background notes.  Taste: Incredibly powerful front burst of bitter-sweet hops, bigger and more intense than the nose would let on. I can't distinguish what hops were used, but they were certainly chosen for their rounded hop sweetness with challenging edges of bitterness. Hop oily but fruity sweet. Sweetness doesn't come from the malt and hence the alcohol also resides as a very background. I'd like a bit more malt presence. The middle palate contains a malt profile which finishes out with a dry piney bitterness that lingers into a fine aftertaste. From front to back: more pineapple, orange, sweet alcohol, pine, tangerine, estringency, grapes, lychee, champagne finish. Interesting. A new variety of double IPA and I applaud Bells effort.  Mouth: Big, full, bubbly-lively, and clean. Nice full-bodied and dry, slightly oily but an okay addition to this beer.

287,17112,geexploitation,4.84,"Pours cloudy, with a bright gold color and a voluminous head that fades to a collar while leaving some sticky lacing on the glass. Incredible aroma packed full of different hoppy notes, such as grapefruit and mint. The aroma also has a nice bottom end to it, with honeyish, doughy malts right up front. The palate is huge and juicy, it's so substantial you could think it's solid food. Big, brash bitterness first off, which leaves active pinpricks on the tongue long after swallowing. Doughy malts form the base of the mid-palate, with grapefruits and hints of metals coming through as well. Some sweetness comes through (from the malts and the alcohol, I expect), but it succeeds in being delectable rather than cloying. Fine-bubbled carbonation moves things along the tongue. Very bitter finish that coats the mouth for a long time after drinking.  This is what a double IPA should be. It's very bitter, very flavorful, but also balanced with a massive malt payload that skirts the line between being overly sweet and too insubstantial to stand up to the hops. In other words, this beer is awesome.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",Imperial IPA,98

Otherwise, it was a light copper color with a little off-white head. Upon smelling - PINE! Wow, hops in abundance, and a little floral. Hard to detect anything beyond the hoppy smell. Good, but that's it. Of course, the flavor was similar, with very little sweetness. A little oily and yeasty, and the finish lingered all day. In the mouth it was very pleasant - surprisingly smooth, and gently carbonated. Overall, this was a good brew, and I didn't notice the alcohol until I got a little loopy later. The hops definitely quashed the alcohol presence. Pretty good...",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",Imperial IPA,98
287,17112,TheManiacalOne,4.59,"Acquired via trade from northertimber, so a big Thank you goes out to him. Poured from a 12oz. bottle into a US tumbler pint glass.  A: The beer is a light gold color with a thin white head that fades quickly and leaves a thin lace on the glass.  S: The aroma is an excellent blend of intense hops and extra sweet citrus, very pleasant smell.  T: A heavy hops burst starts out and is abruptly followed a sweet citrus malt flavor. Both of the flavors alternate for dominance as a mild alcohol burn washes over you. The after-taste has the hops bitterness winning out, but the citrus sweetness sticks around as well.  M: Very crisp and very smooth, medium body, medium carbonation, clean finish.  D: Very tasty, goes down easy for a beer with 9.30% ABV, not too filling, its a little too intense to be a good pounder, I could still put a away few rather quickly and enjoy it quite a bit. I got exactly what I expected from this beer which was Two Hearted Ale with more hops and more alcohol. However, more doesnt necessarily mean better. Two Hearted Ale is one of the best beers Ive ever had and the extra hops and alcohol dont make this beer better than Two Hearted Ale, just more hardcore. This is an excellent beer overall though.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",Imperial IPA,98
287,17112,joe1510,4.14,"12oz. Bottle $14.99 6-pack Big Red Bloomington  Hopslam is one of those beers you can smell from a couple feet away when it's opened. Pure fruitiness. Poured this into a snifter upon opening and got myself a semi-clear copper colored hop-bomb. Not much head to speak of and there's a huge amount of floating particles. I'm guessing proteins. This is my fourth bottle from this 6-pack and the first two I don't remember seeing this but the last one I did. I also remember better heads but this one just wasn't there. Maybe a little too cold? Big and little carbonation bubbles rising from random points throughout. The head there is does leave small drink history lines though. The particles and lack of head hurt the appearence of this beer.  The smell does make up for the lack of appearence. Starts with big juicy pineapple and grapefruit. I can just picture them squeezing the juice into each bottle. Maybe that's where the particles came from, pulp. Anyways, There is even a nice spattering of pine oil. The pine comes through after all the fruit juiciness. There's the smallest amount of malt and booze coming through but the hops knock it all back. One of the beers that will make your mouth water.  Big hop bitterness. Just the way I like things. The fruitiness in the flavor leans more toward the grapefruit side. Sweetened grapfruit but with the bittering effects of unsweetened. There is a caramel malt backbone that tames things down slightly but stays where it should, in the back. The pine needle hoppiness comes back a little on the finish but it's accompanied by a slightly astringent alcohol bite that dries things out. This is something else I don't remember from the first couple bottles but was more evident in the last. Not bad but does detract slightly from the flavor.  The mouthfeel is really well done on Hopslam. It's medium bodied and in no way viscous like many other IIPAs. The pure hoppiness gives a pleasant numbing effect on the tongue and lips. Leaves a decent coating as it slides through.  This is one to sit down and sip but the sipping could last quite awhile. tastes good with a nice body to sit and enjoy a couple at a time. Just watch out for the abv.  This is a quality made beer and another winner from Bell's. Like I said throughout the review the first couple bottles from the 6-pack were better in almost every aspect. I picked this up about two weeks ago and it's been in the fridge so aging shouldn't be it. I still really enjoy this but the first couple bottles were exceptional. I still think the price is solid for such a nicely made beer and that it was available in Illinois.

The nose was dominated by an explosive burst of resiny and citrusy hops with prominent notes of tropical fruits. A light and sweet maltiness poked through at the end. The aroma also gave away it's 9.3% ABV.  The flavor of the beer was primarily that of citrusy and resiny hops with a light caramel maltiness to help round things out. The hops were powerful, but the beer was very smooth. It was well attenuated and wasn't too sweet, which is were many double IPAs can loose points. The beer had a nice tropical fruitiness in the flavor.  The mouthfeel was crisp and the carbonation seemed dialed in just right.

Slam is right for the taste; multiple levels of hop bitterness, maltyness in a thick body. It lights up sweet and bitter at the outset, levelling off to a creamy sweetness, and leaving a bitter tang at the end.

The head fell somewhat, leaving some lacing behind. Throughout the glass there was a constant renewal of lace. Intense hop aroma. Grapefruit and pineapple give it a sweet-tart quality and pine resin keeps things interesting. It's a little powdery, floral and smells very fresh. Strong bitterness is kept in check by significant malt sweetness. The malt isn't really complex, but that's not the point. The hops are the point - and there are plenty in here. Grapefruit, tangerine, and pine dominate from start to finish. Quite fruity, actually. Bitterness lingers and there's alcohol warmth from the mid through the finish. Medium/full bodied with moderate carbonation. Creamy texture. This stuff is great. Too many brewers forget about balance in this style, but Bell's has done a great job here.

287,17112,scorched,5,"I was apprehensive about this beer, namely because of its price, $14.99 for a sixer. I was rewarded, however when I cracked the cap open on my wall-mounted gem of a bottle opened. I got out a fine pint glass and began the pour.  I was cooking at the time, and I could STILL smell the hoppiness of the brew. FANTASTIC. Wonderfully balanced aroma, with hoppiness and maltiness. Once the brew settled, the head was a nice 3/4 white cap. I took in the smell by diving my nose right down the center of the glass and taking a gigantic whiff. Once again, fantastic. I couldn't wait to taste it.  The appearance is what you would expect from a double IPA, and was a rich amber gem.  This beer is aptly-named hopslam, because it assaults your taste buds with the produce of the gods... hops. Instantly, the amount of alcohol in the brew is evident, being a double ipa. The mouthfeel is extraordinary, and has an extremely well-balanced flavor. Hints of grapefruit are abound.  If you're an IPA fan, this is the brew for you, just not your wallet.

287,17112,froggyfrog,4.06,"From a twelve-ounce bottle packaged on October 25, 2006. This beer came into my possession via my highly trained local elite ninja underground case-splitting network. Thanks guys, you know who you are. Beer served in my ""Mondial de la Bière"" stange/flute/mug-type glass, a gift from Canadian BA Goldorak.  OK now to the beer: Appearance is trendy and hip, all golden-orange with off-centered columns of shooting bubbles complimented by an attractive sticky-ass lacing.  Aroma is catty with tons of citrus in a juicy orange, tangerine kind-of-way. I like the sweetness coming off this glass, like a promise of rock sugar-coated pine trees.  The taste delivers a one-two punch, the cattiness still evident here with a delightfully thick oily humulene - um... slam? The hops on the tongue manage to simultaneously invoke the herbal, piney, citrus and even flowery perceptions all at once. This is a nice sweet, well-balanced DIPA, a refreshing take on an often palate-numbing style.  My second pour creates an incredibly cloudy turbulent storm in the glass like a perpetually active glass bulb snow globe filled not with water and ""snow"" but with all-natural pure squeezed high pulp orange juice. The taste amazingly doesn't seem to be changed much by the huge flakes of yeaties running rampant in my glass.  Bell's produces another winner. I might as well stop reviewing beers from these guys and just say there all freaking good. Cheers.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",Imperial IPA,98
287,17112,JohnnyM2002,4.65,"Sampled from tap, poured into an unfrosted pint glass.  A - Pours a cloudy oranage/golden color with a medium off-white head. Good retention and lacing.  S - Smells of sweet hops with a citrus background. Sweeter than other DIPAs.  T - Wow. The hop punch is there, but not the expected super-hoppy/super-bitter taste. Hops are quickly met by a honey-lemon/orange combination. Finishes on the sweet side, which counters the bitterness. Probably the most unique DIPA I've ever had.  M - Plentiful carbonation with a medium body that finishes on the crisp and creamy side. No alcohol sensation on the finish, either.  D - I just now noticed the high ABV...wow! I honestly had no idea when I was drinking this. Anyway though...this ranks very firmly in my top 3 DIPA's and I want to have this on hand at all times. Compared to others, $45/case sounds great to me. Amazing, just amazing.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",Imperial IPA,98
287,17112,BeerRun13,4.27,"First pour produced a slightly hazy golden tone, while the second pour really clouded things up. A creamy and thick off white head stuck around and left some decent wavy lacing. Resiny piney and sharp citrus hops. Some toasty malt hints. Pine and orange citrus flavors combine niceley. Combined with a pleasing maltiness. Pleasant and bittering finish. Good malty body and nice carbonation. Another very drinkable DIPA in what seams to be a string of good ones.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",Imperial IPA,98
287,17112,MikefromDormont,4.24,"I like the Bell's Two Hearted Ale and when I spotted a single case of Bell's Hopslam in my neighborhood beer distributor, I had to purchase the case  Served into a shaker pint glass.  A: Pours an opaque gold color with an off white head that quickly fades to a thin coating over the beer.  S: The most amazing aspect of this beer is the smell. I detect a mix of grapefruit, orange and pineapple aromas.  T: For a beer whose label declares it to be a ""biting, bitter, tongue bruiser"", it has a nice sweet malt backbone. The taste starts out citrus bitter and is followed by sweetness. The finish is dry.  M: Medium body with an appropiate level of carbonation.  D: Due to the 9.3% ABV rating, I would drink only of these beers in a session. The alcohol is very well hidden.  Notes: This is a pricy beer, but a must try for any hop head.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",Imperial IPA,98
287,17112,tempest,4.12,"On-tap at the Blue Nile. Served in a 12 oz goblet.  106 IBUs? Where? Don't get me wrong, there were some amazing aspects to this beer, but bitter it wasn't. This beer was very reminiscent of grapefruit juice. There was some good complexity in the hops flavor, but it was overly juicy to the point of getting away from beer. This made for an amazing aroma, but the taste couldn't quite deliver all the way.  Although the taste didn't exactly do it for me, I was impressed by how drinkable the 9.3% was. The bitterness, or lack of, kind of let me down, but this was still a pretty good DIPA. Worth a try at the least.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",Imperial IPA,98
287,17112,w5baron,4.78,"This beer, wow. The hops brings your taste buds alive. This high ibu beer does an excellent job of bringing a full body taste well rounded. To all that hops, and bells has done a great job with this hopslam. The aroma of the beer brings a strong fruity smell, but dont be scared this is not what you taste. Try the beer and let the hops take you away.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",Imperial IPA,98
287,17112,flexabull,4.45,"Beer courtesy of Loki. Thanks again.  Pours a bright cloudy gold color, with a a nice looking head.  Beer smells resiny, sweet, citrus like, and with a nice pine touch. Very nice aromas.  Beer is quite tasty, and interesting. A bit tea like on the front, but with a great creamy yet hoppy citrus bite on the finish. Alcohol is very well controlled on this one. I would have never guessed that this was over 9% ABV.  Mouthfeel is good. Very rounded flavors, but maybe a bit lean on the front.  Probably the best East Coast DIPA I have had. Very drinkable and enjoyable. I tend to prefer really hoppy DIPAs, and this one can certainly hold a candle to some of my other favs. Hoppy, yet nicely balanced and drinkable. I'd love to drink another.  Great job Bell's Brewery, I am impressed!",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",Imperial IPA,98
287,17112,far333,4.29,"Cloudy honey-apricot colored with particulate matter gyrating within, and a fine mist of bubbles rising up to a thin but mottled off-white and uneven head.  Heady aroma of sticky pine needles and sweet tangerines, very fresh and inviting, even slightly reminiscent of that baby aspirin I almost OD'd on as a child. A bit resinous, a bit musty.  Flavor starts off not as sweet as the aroma leads me to expect, it's more of a hop bitter orange peel and pine at first, but moves to the sweeter citrus hops as it finishes. A little burn in the cheeks from the ABV, but not too bad considering the octane rating. A butterscotchy malt base rides beneath, but pokes through only slightly. Hops are fresh and bright, tingly and satisfying.  Mouthfeel is smooth and even, highly drinkable for such a powerful brew. Thank you Brent for sharing yet another fantastic selection.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",Imperial IPA,98
287,17112,Phatz,4.45,"Thanks to akorsak for hooking me up with two of these. I love it so much I almost regret passing one along to another friend =) I guess that is what advocacy is all about... sharing, right? ...  Allowed to warm significantly to just a slight chill on it. Served in my snifter glass.  Appearance: Pours a gorgeous orange golden color with some haze in the body and a large off-white head a top.  Smell: The sweet candy sugar the spicy orange rind hops and the hint or warming alcohol meld together perfectly, so harmoniously that they create an aroma that is divine.  Taste & Mouthfeel: It starts off with bold hops that I almost disciple as share but that is not quite right because they are not rough. It is like the sharp hops have been smooth (tamed) just enough that it is easy and the sweet malt flows right over around and through all the bold hop almost prickles spikes I imagine in the mouth. There is clearly a vanilla and honey attribute next to the big orange. This is Two Hearted on Steroids. Seriously. It is a beefed up 2H IMO. Finally the alcohol plays a significant role in this beer. It warms and dulls the palate and adds to the dryness I fell and the, almost, prickly hops slide down the throat. What an awesome experience!  Drinkability: The alcohol shows through in a pleasant way and all the attributes are ratcheted back one notch from extreme making this beer almost extremely drinkable but it'd lay you flat after a few. I still say, I drink as many as I could stand through. =) This is good stuff.  Hope this is helpful. Cheers!",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",Imperial IPA,98
287,17112,vwcraig,4.69,"Pours a dark golden color with a bright white head. Had some kind of floaties in it as well that never settled. Unbelievable smell of pineapple juice and possibly grapefruit but on the sweeter side. Initial taste of sweet pineapple taste switching to a bitterness that was less than expected. The sweetness then kinda works it's way back in. Perfect carbonation, medium-light mouthfeel. Awesome drinkability for something this potent. Possibly my favorite in this style and only wish I would have bought more when I had the chance.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",Imperial IPA,98
287,17112,mmcave,4.4,"Batch 7741 picked up at corner beverage store. 14.99 for a sixer. Poured into big wine glass, nice white head, that dissipates and lingers around edges, descent, but thin lacing. The body is a beautiful hazy tea like red orange with good gradation. The color is quite enticing. Smells of wonderful hop aromatics, tons of fruit, citrus, grapefruit, mango, pine, it is pungent, yet there is still a very round sequence of aroma. The malt is there too, except it seems to be more of a backbone than a showcase. Honestly little really gets through the mammoth hop aroma, but if you search you will find. The taste is wonderful smooth yet bitey, the bittering hops really do good work, the malt is there yet not really sweet, but still they keep the hops on the just the right path, not too bitter or too over bearing. The alcohol makes it a dangerously tasty treat, you can only really have one or two. I love this stuff, for me it is another wonderful Double IPA, I'd love to add to my fridge's permanent collection.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",Imperial IPA,98

Leaves nice little rings on the inside of my glass.  S: What can I say? It smells like hops, hops, and more hops. Smells of pine, lemon, lime, and grapefruit. I'm guessing all of these hops or from the northwest. No real malt aromas make it through the amazin hop bouquet.  T: Incredibly smooth for an iipa. Bitter bite to start, moves to citrus, then pine, and leaves the mouth with a sweet hint of ethanol. The name Hopslam fits well.  M: Medium bodied. Rolls off the tongue nicely. Leaves no residue on the palate.  D: If only this were a part of Bell's normal line-up. I would definitely fit this beer in to my rotation. Amazingly drinkable for the immense flavor.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",Imperial IPA,98
287,17112,TheBungyo,4.65,"Another beer courtesy of the generous Melbatoast93.  Jeez, this is so golden and cloudy it blows my mind! It just screams HOPS at the top of it's lungs. There's a nice head. It looks like fresh cream.  I don't think the nose could smell more like fresh grapefruit if someone waved one next to my face. It dominates everything but a bit of sweet malt manages to shine through. Damn, I can just SMELL the bitterness. Before this beer, I never would have said bitter was a smell but it surely is here. Amazing.Theres also some pinapple and orange.  Taste starts as orange, grapefruit and pine and segues into more sweet caramel. I just love this. It's like oozey juicey hops layered over the tongue. Good IPA's are a dime a dozen here in WA but this is truly great. The hops just murder the taste buds.  Mouth is super rich. It's like comparing generic chocolate to rich dark chocolate. It reminds me of cream.  Wow, this is a great double IPA. I'm so glad I had a chance to try this.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",Imperial IPA,98
287,17112,mentor,4.33,"Batch 7690, obtained in Dexter Michigan in December 2006 and consumed that same evening. Pours a strong finger of yellowish head over a clear crown-golden liquid. Sediment retained in the bottle. Smells of pink grapefruit meat and oranges. Quite potent hops with a sugary sweetness playing minor support.  Tastes...woof! Potent hop flavor with some hop bitter countered by a non-descript sugary sweet. Hop flavor is pink grapefruit meat with some pith. Pine is present, as is a touch of lemon. Oranges and woody dry with some ethanol flavor (more ethanol flavor than ethanol burn). Hop bitter is strong, but quite clean, which is nice, because the alcohol is a touch rough (a mistake avoided is that the hop bitter and alcohol can sometimes combine in an unpleasant manner). Malt sweet is a touch of caramel. More, now, I get some fruity esters...pear mostly but some apricot. Dry finish that allows the alcohol to rise and stand noticed. Aftertaste is dry with the apricot hanging to fight the alcohol and dry. Very interesting. At this point the creamy mouthfeel really steals the show.  Mouthfeel is stunning. Thick mouthfeel, but super creamy...like a properly done oatmeal stout. Amazing. I've never had an IPA with this kind of hop-oily mouthfeel. Moderate carbonation and some lacing on the inside of the glass.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",Imperial IPA,98

Frothy head fades slowly, with ample lacing. Aroma is dominated by pungeant fresh hopiness. Taste is malty sweet upfront, and segues nicely into the intensely fruity and piney hops character. Mouthfeel is incredible for a DIPA, so smooth, not allout bitterness just for bitterness' sake, and drinkability is great as well. Have to lookout on this one, with the substantial abv too.

287,17112,akorsak,4.37,"Served on-tap at the Brewhouse Grille in Camp Hill, PA. My comments on drinkability are taken from my comments on the bottled version.  A: The ale is an auburn orange color with a thick 1 finger head. The head is not too impressive by leaves a bit of lacing in the glass.  S: The aroma is a big, sweet piney hop. The fruity aroma of the hops are big and bold, leaving exciting hints of things to come.  T: The hops leap off the tastebuds like a harvest ale. They are so fresh-tasting and intense that words almost fall short in describing them. The hops are very fruity, with tangerine and apricot flavors and a strong piney presence. The hop bitterness is intense upfront and rarely fades in the mouth. The malts are not meant to stand out here and they don't. They do, however, provide a strong grainy foundation for the hops to shine. This ale is why the good Lord made humulus lupulus.  M: The mouthfeel is unlike most other DIPAs. The hops are do fresh, vibrant and intense that they are delicious from first sip to last.  D: The 9.3% abv is tough and those hops will strip your taste buds but you'll love every second of it.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",Imperial IPA,98

Pine-needles! All Pac northwest! One of the best, if not THE best, big-assed citrusy hop beers. Drinkability suffers a little bit, sure, but that's the trade-off for such a massively beautiful rendition of dripping, citrusy and piney hops in a glass. Hop-hazy as expected in the glass; dropping head. Alcohol can be inhibiting to drinkability, but never really exhibits itself throughout the first serving.

Loads of piney hop aroma and fresh oranges with other citrus fruit in the background. Very nice smell, reminds me of more west coast IPA's.  The flavor has less of a potent hoppiness than expected. The grassy hops carry a light citrus tang and are paired well with some light toasted malt flavors. The hop character is a bit spicy, and the finish is pleasantly bitter with only a hint of alcohol. Medium body with appropriate carbonation.  I wasn't wowed by this beer, but it was a fine selection that I would be glad to try again if I get the chance.

287,17112,northernbrews,4.52,"Can Larry Bell live up to the hype again?  12oz. bottle purchased from Top Shelf Liquor in Allen Park.  As soon as I pop the cap, the excellent aroma lets me know I'm in for something special.  Appearance: Pours a nice golden orange hue. This is slightly hazy due to the yeast that I poured into my Bell's snifter. Nice off-white head with nice lacing. Very inviting...  Smell: What an excellent aroma. Starts with a slight hop burn follow by grapefruit, pine, and citrus. You can almost taste the hops...My fricking mouth is watering.  Taste: Tastes just like the aroma. Nice hops up front with grapefruit, pine and citrus notes. Malts come to the party later on to add a beautiful balance to this masterpiece.  Mouthfeel: Nice smooth mouthfeel. The hops hang around for a bit and coat the tongue and roof of my mouth.  Drinkability: I could definitely put back a sixer of these, but I'd rather savor this bad ass Double IPA with one or two. Hoppy, malty, and exceptionally balanced.  The first time I tried this, I had it next to Rouge I2PA and DFH 90 min. IPA. This was exceptional compared to the other two. The Rouge wasn't too bad, but the 90 tasted like a malty barleywine. I used to think the 90 was a hop-bomb....not anymore. I would love to try this next to Dreadnaught...from memory, they are similar except for the fact the a 22oz of Dreadnaught was $9 and a sixer of Hopslam came out to be about $12.  Once again, Larry and the Bell's crew put out an excellent beer. If it's not the best double IPA, then it's definitely in the top five. This should be the new benchmark for the style. Hopefully Bell's decide to make this a more regular offering.

Fantastic hints of citrusy goodness and pine lusciousness with solid balance given to the malt profile. Pungent and tangy without being painfully so.

Lots of pine and grapefruit. Some sweet apples. Good and funky. There's a sweet, bready quality to the smell.  T: Hops. Glorious hops. Citrus, pine, and grass clippings. The hops are balanced wonderfully by a slightly sweet, bready, crackery malt flavor. There's also a tart bitterness (like green apples) to the finish.  M: Dry and bitter yet smooth.  D: Very drinkable for the style. Enough so that you could get in some serious trouble with this one.  Tempurature is the key with this one.

Mouthfeel is a bit black and dry but that is what you should expect from such a hoppy beer .

Pint glass with orange copper color and thick creamy ivory head that dissipated quickly to a few islands of lace and an edge ring.  Smell is sweet, with crisp hop accents.  Taste is crisp and citrus, but this isn't all Cascade and/or Amarillo, its more complex than that but BIG, clean and lingering. Balanced with the malt; the alcohol does not really present itself; masked I am sure by the hops. (I had a 9G Infidel last night, but this is smoother !)  Mouthfeel is full and satisfying. Not thin, but not viscous or syrupy.  Drinkability is; if you like big hoppy beers, excellent !",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",Imperial IPA,98

Piney, citrusy, grassy, fruity hops. A slight hint of maltiness in the background. So hoppy that it may be a bit unbalanced but it is a double ipa after all.  Again a slight hint of malt character but this is a bitter, sharp, bighting, carbonic hop attack on the taste buds.  Very drinkable, especially since I lean more toward maltier beers usually.

So much haze I really can't see any activity in the glass. Head started out fizzy but settled down into a 1/2 off white semi creamy mass and is showing some staying power.  S: Loads of fresh grapefruit juice, lemon tea, lime lifesavers and kind bud. This is one seriously great smelling beer. I've had my nose in it for a while now.  T: This beer is all about the grapefruit and honestly tastes exactly how it smells (or tastes exactly how I think its going to taste after I smell it, I should say). There is some subtle watery tangerine flavors with pungent lemon rind lurking about as well. Get a sense of sugary limes about half way through the process which play well with a bready caramel foundation. Finishes extremely alcoholic, almost like someone poured vodka straight into the bottle.  M: Medium body with a full mouthfeel. Bit fuzzy but I'm not complaining.  D: I say this about almost all DIPA's, but....it lacks some of the depth I'm looking for. Yes, this is a delicious and tremendous beer. Is there anything wrong with simplicity? Absolutely not.

287,17112,GregBrewski,4.69,"""A biting, bitter, tongue bruiser of an ale."" (From the label on back of bottle) A perfect explanation of this brew, can anyone give a better one. Well here is my attempt anyway.... A nice golden/copper color with a white head that maintains its presence most of the way, leaves nice lacing. Lots of yeast suspended in the liquid, which never settles b/c of the bubbles that create turbulence. It has a smell I always love to come back to...very hop-y, mostly citrus and floral aromas. The taste is just as pleasantly enjoyed, citrus hops, spice, and faint notes of alcohol. There are some hints of yeast in the finish, but the bitterness never fades and remains in the back for a good amount of time. Its actually quite smooth in the entry, but leaves a tang and burn in the finish. Becomes even more spicy and bitter when warm.

Smell is sweet and pungent. Piney. As it warmed the aroma developed a cat-piss like essence. Very well hidden alcohol.  Taste was sweet, resiny, oily bitterness. A hops marmalade. Maltiness and hops boldness work together, yet remain distinct. An interesting juxtaposition of juiciness and drying qualities. Very drinkable and never cloying.

287,17112,gmcfarre,4.49,"Poured from a 12oz bottle into a St. Bernardus Chalice (just because) Poured @ 45 degrees  A - Pours a hazy mandarin orange color with a very minimal head. Lacing (as you might expect) is minimal as well. The orange vibrancy has me intrigued. There is an abundance of yeast floaties in this brew, perhaps I should have poured more carefully. Oh well, it still looks great.  S - Gorgeous bouquet bursting with a sensory-overloading floral hopness. A biscuity fullness adds some power to the hop forefront. Can I drink this yet?  T - Strong floral hop essence that assaults the tongue in a most pleasant manner. Taste evolves into a spicy, almost-tripelesque grapefruity yeast flavor. Aftertaste is the traditional intense bitterness. Spice adds a nice twist to the DIPA and grows more apparent with warming, although the beer gets a bit more acidic and alcoholic at the same time.  M - Mouthfeel begins with a highly carbonated tingling sensation that confounds the tongue as it merges nicely with the dry bitter aftertaste. Pretty enjoyable.  D - Hmm, I almost like this beer better when its colder, but it develops more complexity as it warms. A good beer that is a real treat to drink, but it sure does smack your palate around.  As with most DIPAs, it would be nice to have access to this year round (and in Colorado). I'd say pick some up if you can and enjoy it while you can. Definitely worth a try as it throws a slight variation into the DIPA canon.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",Imperial IPA,98
287,17112,Gueuzedude,4.2,"Bottled October 2006, Sampled December 2006 Pours with a touch of yeast dustiness, but the beer is a lightly reddish hued, amber to copper color. It is topped by a frothy, almost two-finger thick, light tan colored head. The aroma is certainly quite hoppy; it is a mix of citrus, pine and even a more dank hop note similar to onions or perhaps even garlic. The hop aromatics are certainly an interesting mix. The predominant character is that of audaciously vibrant sweet citrus and exotic fruit aromas; notes of apricots, lychee, pineapple, candied orange peel, concentrated ruby-red-grapefruit, and other tropical fruit notes make up the dominant notes. Behind the upfront hop fruit though is a touch of more raw hop character; hints of pine, menthol and that onion-like almost garlic character lurk in the back ground, just enough to add a hint of complexity. Where is the malt? I couldn't tell you underneath all of the hops.  The taste is sweet with the fruity hop notes, in fact the sweet fruitiness just sticks around clinging to the palate even after the beer has left my mouth. The hop fruit notes are much the same as I noticed in the aroma, but here there is a touch of biting bitterness to add a touch of balance. You know it is a hop focused beer, when you need hop bitterness to balance other hop derived notes. The malt is buried here, playing only a supporting role, there is certainly enough malt to not allow the hops to be dominating and raw, but definitely not enough more my hop flagellated taste buds to notice. It has just enough mouthfeel / palate coating ability to help the dominant hop character along; I wouldn't say that this was a beer you wanted to pound, but it is dangerously quaffable.  The hop character here is so smooth & even soft (despite being amped up and loud overall); the brewer definitely took a heavy handed approach with smooth fruity hops like Simcoe and Amarillo when brewing this beer. The flavor does not have much, if anything, noticeable of the onion / garlic note that I experienced in the aroma, though perhaps there is a touch of it in the finish. Really the finish is dominated by a smooth, lingering bitterness that perhaps takes on a touch of mentholated pine. I really am a sucker for these smoothly fruity, over the top, one dimensional hop bombs. This is quite bitter, though I don't necessarily realize it most of the time. This is totally only comprises one dimension of the usual three that a beer can have (hop, malt and yeast), but it is so enjoyable in its expression of the hop.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",Imperial IPA,98
287,17112,carln26,4.19,"Hazy copper color with a bit of sediment. The beer is topped by a thick, fluffy off-white head. The nose is dominated by citrus hops. Nice blend of grapefruit and mandarin orange. Little malt in the aroma. The flavor? Citrus, citrus, and more citrus. I would not call it a hop bomb, as the bitterness is not overwhelming, but there is a load of mandarin and grapefruit citrus with just a touch of pine midway. The malt is a subtle sweetness that accentuates the hoppy character. The mouthfeel is light and slightly effervescent. Remarkably, and wonderfully drinakble. There was a nice thread between some friends of mine a while back as to how this compares with the Two Hearted Ale. Very different beer. I prefer Two Hearted. This is still a nice offering.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",Imperial IPA,98
287,17112,blsfreak,4.77,"I cannot say enough good things about this beer. It pours well, not much head, great color, a bit cloudy or thick looking. The aroma is amazing, fruity, hoppy, and very enticing. The taste blew me away. I was expecting a big beer, and got one...now I can't stop drinking it. It has a nice balance, not too bitter, but it will ruin your palate for anything else. I could drink this beer all day and am getting worried about what I will be drinking when it is gone....that will be a sad day.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",Imperial IPA,98
287,17112,scruffwhor,4.26,"Looks more like a plain jane pale ale than an INDIA pale ale. Some sediment floating around, mostly at the bottom. Dark gold to light amber in hue. The arom reeks of every kind of citrus. Very complex hop nose with a little malt in the background. The balance of flavor is tilting towards hop overlod. Only a special group of beer enthusiasts can handle it. Lemons, oranges, tangerines, grapefruits, nectarines, even some limes, lets not forget the light floral hint detected from this beer. The name sake is perfect for this beer. The palate is definetly cloying and syrupy and resiny. Just coats the tongue and lingers till it decides to leave.

287,17112,becktone,4.09,"Admist studying for exams(I've got three tomorrow/today-its midnight) I find I needed some relief. What better way to sojourn in the calm before the storm than with a Double Ipa?  To my eyes this beer is fairly attractive. It pours with a orange color, and is pretty clear. The beer appears to be alive with carbonation. The head pours to a little less than one finger's width. It then receeds to just a thin skin on the surface of the beer. Lacing is great and makes up for head retention and formation. Head retention and formation really brought this one down for me.  To the nose this beer is very floral and it should be! Oh yes a nice and strong pleasing floral aroma, also a bit of spiciness and some citrus notes as well. There is also a strong malty sweet backbone to support the hop aromas. Alcohol is a bit hot in the nose.  An assult of hops on the palate, that's how I'd describe this one. First characteristic of this beer that hits you is its bitterness, after that a somewhat balanced malt and hop flavor comes through and is in turn followed by a very potent hop flavor-floral and herbal. Alcohol is noticeable, and extremely upfront. All in all flavor is good but the alcohol is, in my opinion, way to extreme. Would be much better in my opinion if it were hidden a bit more.  Higher levels of carbonation help this brew out as it is heavy on the alcohol. Alcohol is evident and warms as it goes down and it somewhat lingers after swallowed in conjunction with a hop aftertaste. This beer is definitely something to be sipped, its too extreme to just quaff one after the other. I really don't think that I could drink a six of this in one sitting, the alcohol is just to upfront. The brew itself is good, but the alcohol ruins it for me. It'll be a long while till I come back to this one. I'd really like to try more DIPAs before coming back.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",Imperial IPA,98
287,17112,bigdeuce,4.2,"Wow, this one is sooo damn good! Fresh grapefruity hops on the nose, with some malty goodness to balance it out.. I actually have had hoppy brews, but this one is so well balanced and drinkable. Pours a clear golden color with a thick head and nice lacing. Smells of pine nuts and grapefruit. I could drink 6 of these and lose my mind in a heartbeat. A hop lover's ecstasy!",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",Imperial IPA,98
287,17112,hoppymeal,4.35,"Pours gold to peach in color and hazy with a medium white head that quickly fades back to a thin covering. Aroma is big citrusy hops, grapefruit and a little tropical fruit going on, some sweet pineapple juice. There is also a hint of grainy-grassiness. Taste follows with some sweet pineapple juice flavor up front that blends into some grapefruit bitterness. The bitterness is nice and even graduating into a citrus rind dryness. There is the hint of what could be an alcohol burn, but it never quite gets to a burn, just on the verge, and then warms the throat with the dry finish. Light to medium in body, the malts are plentiful enough to balance the hoppiness and accentuate the citrus and pineapple flavors, but not overpowering to make you think of a dipa-barleywine hybrid. The bitterness is not a huge kick in the teeth but is still large and nice and even from about mid-taste thru the finish. Very good beer easy to drink, deceptively strong.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",Imperial IPA,98
287,17112,sullysbeer,4.76,"Aroma: Like stepping into a hop field! HUGE I mean HUGE aromatics. The biggest whiff of the freshest hops I have ever smelled, seriously. Tons of chlorophyll. Like rubbing freshly cut grass between your hands when there turning green. Grape skin aroma with a ,now bare with me, a kinda body odor smell, yes like B-O. But not disgusting.  Appearance: Very clear. Golden in color with a slight off white head retention.  Flavor: Huge sweetness from the crystal malts balanced with a citrus hop flavor and smothered in a piney hop bitterness that dominates.  Mouthfeel: Medium-Full bodied ale.  Overall Impression: I've been waiting for this beer for a long time now. WOW! Huge hoppy beer. Not over done, though. Still perfectly balanced. FRESH HOPS!! I couldn't stop appreciating the aroma. This is why Bell's is my favorite. Now, go pick up a sixer and enjoy this amazing beer.

287,17112,sacrelicio,4.57,"Jumpin Jehoosefat! Someone swapped my Hopslam with ruby red grapefruit juice! The appearance not so much, but the smell and taste quite a bit. Appearance is fairly typical DIPA orange amber with rocky cream colored head and lace. The smell is grapefruit mostly, with some tomato and butter notes. Yeah, weird I know. Taste is ruby red grapefruit all the way. Crazy grapefruit. Soooo bitter. I'm a dyed in the wool hophead and this even puckers me a bit. God, it's almost like grapefruit candy or soda or something. Unreal. The tap version is sweeter and more of a pure pineapple juice, like a two hearted grandaddy from what I remember. This is just vicious grapefruit. One of the most bitter beers I have ever had.  Mouthfeel and drinkability? Both pretty good. Creamy mouthfeel with good weight. Drinkable to me, but I would eat hops if I lived in the Pacific Northwest, so I don't know if normal people could drink this realisitically. On tap this stuff is more approachable and palatable in its sweetness and balance.  Overall, fantastic.

Fine, fine stuff, god I love a world class DIPA like this one. Everything is in place here, nice job by Bells. Lots of citrus and hoppy goodness.

Pours a hazy brownish orange color with a large head and great lacing. The aroma is initially hoppy, but with an exceptionally sweet citrus element as well. The last reviewer who detected the cat urine is hilarious. I kind of pick up on that as well now that I read that, but wouldn't have otherwise. Apricot jelly is prominent as well.  The taste is initially restrained until you swallow. The aftertaste is an explosion of peach, pineapple, and apricot with some hop bitterness in the finish. That's right! A little hop bitterness in the finish. That's it. A veritable fruit basket, this one.  Mouthfeel is lively yet smooth and the drinkability is ridiculous.

The beer is so flavorful and great that it is difficult to think that there would be so much alcohol. The nose is very fruity...mango and passion fruit. Taste is phenomenal. The malts are sweet and they pair well with the citrus hops. For whatever reason, they have managed to isolate and remove the grapefruit taste that is common in double IPAs. This little trick makes for a unique DIPA. Mouthfeel is juicy. Drinkability is awesome...beware the high alcohol because it is definitely under the radar.

287,17112,mrasskicktastic,2.65,"A - Very hazy golden copper brew with about one finger of foamy white head that dissipates in about a minute leaving decent rings of lacing in its wake. Streaks of lacing up and down the glass. A pretty beer.  S - HOPS!!! Very strong. It practically fills teh room with hop aroma. Grapefruit pith and a strong, but soft pine (simcoe hops possibly, or one of its ancestors). The smell is strongly of resin. A bit of white peach. Alcohol is a little noticable at higher temperatures (If the mouthfeel wasn't so caustic, I would have drank this much faster and I never would have found this out).  T - The flavor is actually pretty mild. It has a bit of a pine and grapefruit flavor upfront that shifts into a mild pine bitterness aftertaset with a touch of grapefruit pith. The alcohol is very detectable in the back of the mouth. Pretty boozy. This isn't even very bitter really. Where are the 106 IBUs? I don't think this could be about 65. I really expected more flavor out of this beer.  M - Drying (partially from the alcohol) to the point of it being hard to swallow. I am having trouble drinking this with a glass of water. Seriously, this beer goes down about as smoothly as a shot of cheap vodka. Ridiculous. On top of that the carbonation makes it a bit harsh.  D - I love hops, but this mouthfeel is unbearable. A beer that I can barely choke down with a huge glass of water is not a drinkable beer by any standards. I don't think I will have this again. It is definitely not sessionable. It might go with some foods since it has a somewhat mild flavor. All and all a beer I don't care for - it makes your breath and burps smell very nice though.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",Imperial IPA,98
287,17112,TheLongBeachBum,4.62,"Presentation: Long neck, brown glass 12 ounce bottle sealed with a standard brass crown cap which has the Bells logo on it. The main label projects a hoppy theme with its fresh green background, in the middle of which is a dude laid out apparently floored by three giant Hops. No freshness date or strength listed but the reverse label has an inkjet code of 7690 on it. Described as A biting, bitter, tongue bruiser of an ale. With a name like Hopslam, what did you expect?  Appearance: Pours with an incandescent hazed nuclear barley sugar pineapple shine. The turbid body is literally stuffed full of feisty little hop floaters that dance around like dust particles in the sunlight, rising and falling with each mouthful. Dirty white head lines the top of the fluid with a 2 deep head that rises nicely and fluffs up like your favorite pillow. Conditioning is middling but has a fighting nature. Minimal sliding lacing and a cracking overall presentation.  Nose: A terrifically pungent organic nose to say the least! Awash with a tropical fruit punch which is heavy on mango and a luscious watermelon. Tangerines smoke the arena as fresh piney hops leap out and tug at those nasal hairs that peak out at the bottom of your nose. Fruity tones and fleshy hops are all welcome. Virulent strength really entices. Top marks here.  Taste: A strafing orangeness slides through and up to the middle from the beginning. Backed by apricot juice, peach halves and orange fleshed watermelon seeds - the finish starts to beef up with a freshly harvested hop dimension. The hops have bitterness but tend to exhibit much more of a juicy hoppy feel rather a dry bitterness as is often experienced, this aspect really appeals to me. Zingy orange pith and a citric punch mix with the pine hops and trail fresh hop oil on the tongue that lasts for some time.  Mouthfeel: Big body, viscous to the eye and equally thick to the palate. This has a deep rooted orange backbone with hops and a supporting malt frame that can handle itself in a fist fight.  Drinkability: If I had read the back label and been given this brew I would say that they were not for the same beer. This does not have any of the harshness that the label description projects, moreover it has a very charming and alluring demeanor which is fruity, healthily fleshed out and full of fresh hop bonus. Get a Case of this if you dare, you know you just may find yourself working through faster than you planned. Drinks like a ""regular"" IPA rather than a Double, though I am sure the alcohol will creep up on you if given the chance.  Overall: Superb, a lovely fruity fresh fleshy IPA which I found to be far from biting and bitter to be perfectly honest. Superb!!

Taste is moderately bitter with a clover honey aftertaste minus any sweetness. A touch boozy, sticky on the lips but not overly sweet at all. Overall seems a touch dialed down, but could be a fatigued palate. Will try again soon.  2016: Great as ever, punchy tropical pineapple flavor, light sweetness.  2011: 4.59 It's been over 4 years, time to re-review. How palate's have changed. This is pretty much hop crack, can't get enough. Sweet citrusy aroma, purely intoxicating... tropical hints of mango, and candied pineapple. Hugely resiny hop flavor, sweet and bitter with pineapple, mango, and cantaloupe notes. Firmly bitter aftertaste, very drying too from the 10%, yet no trace of the ABV in the taste. Dangerously drinkable for sure.  11-29-2006 A 4.1 Hazy yellow-orange pour, unfiltered with suspended particles. Lots of foam, which recedes to a frothy sheet on the sides of the glass. Smells potent, of concentrated pine and floral hops.  Taste is bracing at first, but not a whole lot more bitter than the Alpha King I just had. Hopslam feels a bit more slick and resiny, with notes of pine and bright grapefruit.  Overall, IPA's aren't the first thing i'll reach for, but this is very approachable.

287,17112,WVbeergeek,4.37,"Appears a slightly clouded apricot orange copper hue with a large white head leaves behind even streaks of lacing in my snifter glass. Aromatics have deep grapefruit peel explosions going on with a mild sugary malt presence with light grassy notes and mils biscuit malts with a huge alcohol presence in the nose. Flavor contains deep bitterness with the 109! IBUs bit at times each sip seemed to overwhelm me with the grapefruit peel oily feel to balance all I can detect is a very mild biscuit breadiness from a combonation of the yeast and malts complete coats the palate I just feel that it's a bit one dimensional with the citrus peel effect and boozy alcohol I'm down for a bit of some balance and I adore their Two Hearted so I figured they could pull off an incredible DIPA as well. Mouthfeel is medium to fuller bodied with strong carbonation and a sickingly oily texture tickles the nose with citrus pungency. Drinkability is mediocre for me an expressive and unique double IPA I'm just looking for more balance even within some huge hop bombs out there there's still a rediculous malt bill...after a bottle of this it would get hard to drink plus for 44 bucks a case I would pass on that quantity. I will continue to try I've already had it on draft side by side with Hop Wallop, kinda unimpressed with this supposed gem.  Update: bottled 12/29/11 released January 2012:  What can I say I'm burping up hop candy come and enjoy here's my review. I've drank this beer every year since it's release every year enjoying it a bit more...sadly I looked back at 2006 and didn't realize how low I had scored it then. Never re-reviewing to realize that I've definitely enjoyed it much more than that as a whole. Brewed 12-29-11 that's as fresh as a six of Hopslam gets, and I've got 3 six packs at about 17 bucks a pop. Appears a slightly hazed golden orange hue with a creamy white thicket of head forming thick with chunks of scattered lacing. Aroma is usually explosive with grapefruit peel in this beer, and it still is with a sugar coated layer of candied hops. So green so fresh with hops, I can't get enough of each smell no real booze coming out in the nose, but there's a deep ridden hop pungency that makes you recognize. Flavor wise this seems to have fermented out a good bit this year not much honey sweetness and the yeast ate the heavenly malts and honey to unleash the devilish ten percent alcohol, which is showing up a bit more than I've realized in the past. No big deal I'm warm in the chest and still enjoying one of the hoppiest beers around, get slammed by the hops. Mouthfeel is slick with hop oils carbonation really wraps itself around the palate, medium bodied flowing down.

Pours out to a slightly hazy golden peach, forming a nice rocky white head with very good retention and lacing. Carbonation is mild to moderate. Bottle-conditioned. The aroma is huge with hops...sticky, oily, resinous green Centennial hops with a touch of pungency and body odor twang. The thing that stands out most is the huge peach and pineapple notes...lovely. Cleanly fermented and sweet in the nose. Mouthfeel is slick and dextrinous with a medium-dense body and nice stickiness upon the tongue. Taste is all about the floral and citric hops, as described above with some nice crystal malt husk peeking through and a full residual sweetness. Slight musty oxidation note. Bitterness is medium and lingers long on the tongue. Slight alcoholic, boozy astringency and fusels in the aftertaste. Drinkability is quite good for a beer of this flavor and ABV due to it's excellent balance. IMO, this is better than current 2-Hearted, and is as almost as good as 2-Hearted used to be about 2-3 years ago.  A bit boozy and the hops/slight oxidation/slight fusels combo can be rough, especially as it warms, but overall, a decent DIPA.

Smells like grapefruit and melons, which reminds me of 3F's Dreadnaught. I am excited, Taste is very bitter on the first sip, in a citrusy kind of way. Alcohol is very had to detect underneath. Flavors of honeydew, grapefruit, hops (wait, no hopsLAM). It's really the grapefruit-iness that stands out. Not too heavy or syrupy, just full bodied and slightly fizzy on the tongue.

All the citric goodness of lemon rind and pink grapefruit pulp along with canabis and smokey pine resin. The taste translates all of that goodness from the nose onto the palate. The bright citric tones of grapefruit and lemon. And smokey, resinous, raw Mary Jane. Bitterness is not clean, but not real abrasive either. Kind of in between. Alcohol is barely noticeable. Body is a little better than medium. Toffeeish malt way in the background, but there nonetheless. A top notch IIPA no doubt.

Clarity is fantastic on this brew. This brew glows it is so brilliant. Aroma is thick with sweet grapefruity hop. Very sweet and luscious. The caramel malt underneath is sweet as well, but with a alcohol spiceyness in there that breaks the sweetness of the caramel and hop up. It is very juicy. Taking a sip, I get a combination of grapefruity hop and an alcholol spiceyness. The caramel malt hits after the initial taste as a mild sweetness. It finishes with a pepperyness from the hop, along with a more mild bitterness. I really like the major sweet hop flavors that dominate this one. Mouthfeel is thick, with a mild carbonation as well. It sits strong but is not syrupy or offensive. This one is really working well for me. I enjoy the fact that the hop manifests itself more as flavor than as bitterness. It really is a beer that doesn't need to be sipped, but should be due to the alcohol.

Smell can be summed up in two words: grassy hops! Damn! Taste is also dominated by grassy hops with citrus coming through in the middle. Splash of alcohol detected in the finish. Drying, light body mouth feel. You can feel the burn of bitter hops and alcohol all the way down to your gut. Out-f'n-standing beer!

287,17112,rayjay,4.54,"Via trade with akorsak, batch # 7690. Hazy wheat colored ale with a solid head that laced the glass. Extremely potent hop nose full of grapefruits and citrus rinds. The head is solid and it leaves a lace all over the glass. The range of flavors from the hops is quite extraordinary; ironically the only thing it lacks is extreme bitterness (which I don't seem to miss). Loads of dried fruit, citrus fruit, pine, leather, bug spray, and HOPS. Maybe zeus, tomahawk perhaps? The malts are there but play a minimal role; they kind of taste like light rye malts. The finish is clean, leaving you only with the intense smell of hops up your nose and down your throat; this is a beer that really makes you smell like beer. The way the hop bitterness fades away reminds me of a wet hopped beer. Alcohol is undetectable. This is one beautiful IPA. The burps from this one actually taste better than certain beers I've had! I was surprised to find it's rated at 106 ibu; I would have guessed down in the 70-80 range like Pliny the Elder. This may be the first 100+ ibu beer I really enjoyed.

287,17112,garymuchow,4.48,"Nice and pleasing hop aroma that initially began (and to some extent stayed) of softer resin. This was followed by a grassy quality and eventually settles with grapefruit. Additional hop qualities of flower. At times pick up a brief malt sweetness. No alcohol noted. Not overpoweringly strong, rather pleasant and soft, but there's an intensity (almost like body) to each whiff that feels powerful, and takes you back - like smelling ammonia. Pours with a slow developing 1/2 inch head of mostly white and settles from middle to the edge (which stays kinda' big before settling into a ring - never seen that way before). Lots of lacing that lingers firmly on the sides of the glass. Amber of gold/orange with a bit of a haze preventing true clarity. A lot of sediment on bottom of the bottle. Unique profile of hop bitterness and flavors. The malt adds a touch of sweetness up front, then makes a second appearance towards the finish that's made up of toast (toasted bread?). Everything else is hop based, but it's never out of hand, or excessive in any way. I really like the resiny flavors, that somehow never get too intense or biting. Also, I like the way the hoppy flavors grow throughout each sip (especially grapefruit), building in intensity from start to finish and then linger and slowly fade away during the long drawn out finish. Carbonation is done very well...small, very soft and fine. Medium body with a good amount of smoothness. Yet somehow it's thick without being heavy. In time some alcohol warmth (that creeps up). With all the hop intensity, it's somehow still has a cleanness to the feel. This is a pretty amazing beer. Somehow unique amongst the style in it's cleanness, different malt flavors, balance and lack of being intensely overwhelming. This isn't for everyone, but is should please the vast majority of hop heads. I worry about a hop hangover (I guess I'll know tomorrow). There is so much going on here that I'm glad I have several bottles to sample, as I believe each one might be a unique experience.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",Imperial IPA,98
287,17112,dhchatfield,4.92,"[edit] 12/3/06 I have re-visited this beer after enjoying a mini session (4) last night. I have determined that one must enjoy multiples of this beer to truly rate drinkability and taste. The initial hop assault needs to run its' course and ""condition"" ones tastebuds. Drinkability goes from a 4 to a 5. Taste was upgraded as well from 4 to 5. Do yourself a favor and set up 2 or more of these before reviewing. This was my personal experience.  A totally unexpected gift from feloniousmonk received today. Poured into my spankin' new Gavroche mini-tulip. This is the first beer I've had in a week, since splitting a Aecht Schlenkerla Helles Lagerbier with my lovely Wife at curbside outside Orlando airport.  A - A golden-amber, slightly cloudy hue. Decent carbonation. I poured fairly conservatively, so not much head.Good lacing.  S - WOW!! I almost jumped this to the front of appearance. The smell of this beer is fantastic. The first note I got was mango, which I quickly got a second opinion on from my 13 year old son....yep...Mango. Definate pineapple as well. The pine kicks in on the tail end of these, riding their coattails.  T- Quite different from other DIPA's I have enjoyed to date. The mango is up front here as well, along with an extremely resinous hop flush that spreads to all corners in a hurry. The alcohol makes its' presence known in a rush as well. A bitter oily, boozy fruit cocktail finish spreads down the gullet before the ABV depth charge is triggered. Very reminiscent of Two-Hearted at first, then morphing into another universe.  M - Quite a bit creamier than I had expected. I made a point NOT to read reviews of this one, as I have been actively pursuing it. (I hope to snag a case tomorrow) So I had no pre-dispositions or expectations. As things warm a bit, the malt becomes more tongue-coating.  D - This one is definately not a ""pounder"", say like a 90' or Hop Whore. I will savor every single one of these I am fortunate enough to get my hands on S L O W L Y, to the last drop.  All in all, another solid Bell's production. Much anticipated and VERY much appreciated. If you are a hopivore like myself, get you some. Thanks Al, for the pleasant surprise.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",Imperial IPA,98
287,17112,bucko,4.09,"This beer pours a light transparent orange color with a small white head that quickly diminished leaving fine lacing and a tiny head. Lots of suspended floaters in this one, even after a careful pour. The aroma is heavy with citrus, pine, punch and pineapple. Taste is more of the same with a huge hop/citrus punch. The bitterness is nice, but reasonable for a beer of this magnitude. Mouthfeel is nice... smooth, playful on the tongue. HopSlam is surprisingly drinkable for a beer this size. If it weren't for the alcohol, I could easily enjoy a few of these. Nice beer.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",Imperial IPA,98
287,17112,benito,3.38,"From the bottle, a recent (76--) batch.  A: Hazy amber with a thin head that laces well but doesn't show the rockiness I'd expect from this style. Still without any signs of carbonation.  S: From several feet away, the hop aromas are strong. Grapefruit and pine are especially predominant.  T: The back of the bottle says ""biting, bitter, and bruising"" and that it is. Grapefruit dominates, almost mercilessly, but is kept barely in check by a piney, resiny finish. Clear alcohol warming flavors as well.  M: An ode to the hop that forgets to back it up with a good malt sidekick. Though it's refreshing and actually fairly light bodied for a DIPA, it's ultimately too one-sided and the metallic 'alcohol' notes really go unchecked across the back of the tongue.  Overall, this is a strong and agressive beer with a few major flaws. I love that Bell's is going for something strong that isn't a stout, but they seem to have abandoned their golden rule (maximum realization of style, rather than experimentation with style) and ended up with a less stellar product than I would have expected.  Worth a look once or twice, but it's too much like spiked grapefruit juice to be a great beer.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",Imperial IPA,98
287,17112,rhoadsrage,4.45,"(Served in a tulip glass)  A- This beer has a warm orange body that is dense with lots of tiny bits swirling around like a hop snow globe. There is a good carbonation of tiny bubbles keeping everything stirred up. There is a thick creamy off-white head that last and last. It looks like there is a slight hop oil yellow hue to it but that might just be wishful thinking.  S- The smell of big green grassy hops has a bold pineapple smell with some smooth floral notes and a faint herbal tea hint. This smell is all about the hops but it has a great complexity.  T- The slightly sweet candy sugar hint at the beginning reminds me of a nice Triple but it is quickly overtaken by a big juicy green hop flavor. It has notes of fresh cut grass, grapefruit and a nice bitter pine hop finish. The bitterness keeps growing after the sip for a bit.  M- This beer has a medium mouthfeel with a slight slippery texture.  D- This beer has a great hop flavor with lots of depth and hop flavor is balanced by hop bitterness, while both are being enhanced by a slight sweet malt flavor. This taste like a splash of triple and a load of hops.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",Imperial IPA,98

Its a bitter, sucking the leaf sucking the lime hop delivery that works and is satisfying aftertaste, not in your face or substantial malting as in other DIPA. My tongue was frozen later on. Good carbonation. Good but overated.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",Imperial IPA,98

Smells of citrus hops, followed by piney hops, followed by floral hops, hops, hops, hops. Tastes just the same as the smell. Massive hops but not overly done. Huge citrus notes at first, grapefruit and orange. Nice piney, grassy flavors follow. Quite enough malt to bring this hop bomb into some type of balance. If you love citrus hops, this is the beer for you. Very drinkable and well crafted.  Had to bump it up a notch for the 08 batch. Many of the same characteristics as the 06 yet more rich and sweet.

A very hoppy nose,intense grapefruit aromas,very clean,piney,even smells a bit like pineapple. Strong grapefruitty tastes,very hoppy,a bit thin on the maltiness.A very hop oriented beer.Just a little sweet malty taste,the hops are just overpowering. A light,medium mouthfeel,a bit light for a double,a slight cloyingness. The lighter body makes it more drinkable,but the intense hop bite takes some of the drinkability away. A hopheads beer all the way. A good beer overall,the alcohol was not really detectable with all the hoppiness. I like the Two-Hearted a bit better.

287,17112,nlmartin,5,"I would like to shoot a special thanks to bax72 for this bottle of HopSlam. It is readily available in Cincinnati but I had drank my last bottle and was craving some more. This beer was served in my Imperial Pint glass.  Appearance: The beer has a orange coloration. The carbonation actively boils away in the glass. The off white colored head is two fingers high. The head has perfect retention during the session. Thick pancake like layers of lacing remain behind on my glass.  Smell: This beer is a celebration of hops! The beer is loaded with pine resin, pineapple, a citrus explosion of grapefruit, oranges, tangerines, peaches and apricot. The beer smells positively juicy. A complementing sweetness underlies the smell.  Taste: This beer may have one of the best hop attacks I have ever experienced. The hops come at me in layers. The beer is starts out with a oily pine resin. The beer then eases into a complex weave of fruit juicyness pineapple, grapefruit, peaches, apricot, tangerines. The beer then transitions to a herbal grassyness. The beer has a good malty backbone in the background. This is a hop driven beer but in no way unbalanced.  Mouthfeel: The beer is medium bodied. The active carbonation breaks it up a bit. The beer manages to have a creamy mouthfeel. This beer is very alcoholic but incorporates the alcohol well. The beer is easy to drink. I am hoping this one will be a yearly treat from Bell's. If you like strong hoppy beers this one is for you.

Some delicate sheet and patch lacing adorns the glass.  Aroma is a blast of juicy and wet citrus. Lots of orange and pink grapefruit pulp with some bready malt notes. Echoes of DFH 120 and Stone 10th here. An unusual note of cat urine bespeaks of some unusual esters, maybe more like composted grass.. Still, it doesn't work as an offnote here.  Mouthfeel is a full medium, creamy carbonation, and a tangy hops bite on the tongue.  Taste has a solid hop bitterness that is grapefruit and lemon rind, enhanced by a twist of freshly ground green pepper. Hints of pale malt sweetness add a note of old clover honey. Finishes with an old grass bitterness and a grapefruit rind aftertaste.  What an unusual ale this is. Bells Two Hearted Ale is my everyday beverage. Hop Slam is totally different, with a different hop and malt profile, and is one of the best DIPA's I've sampled.

287,17112,ZAP,5,"The best DIPA I have had....PERIOD...  Appearance: Light orange color....small white head..  Smell: Incredible aroma of newly cut christmas trees and fresh sweet citrus (grapefruit, oranges, pinneaples, and tangerines).  Taste: Sweet, fresh citrus hop flavor that is more tasty than bitter...a big grapefruit element but also the tangerines, oranges and pinneapples...A bit of the christmas tree taste as well....The malt is very much in the background but does the job perfectly because this never feels unbalanced or like hop water...  Mouthfeel: Perfect....medium bodied...smooth....9.3%?? No-where to be tasted....like a silent assassin...I am sure this is high in IBU's but it tastes more juicy sweet than bitter...a great example of how to use hops.  Drinkability: Like I stated at the top....the best there is...Two hearted is one of my favorites but I had no idea I would like this so much. Fuck the price, I will try to secure another case of this if possible. Truly the nectar of the gods..

287,17112,tavernjef,4.69,"Muted light golden brown. Very closely resembling the look of a brown beer bottle well lit from the back. Puffy white capping of foam sits a top for a bit, then crunches down to a good bubbley skim and a good amount of lacing tickles the glass with a pattern of a receeding bubble bath.  Beautiful aroma! Sweet, alive, pungent, and fresh-as-the-day-it-was picked hoppyness that has a remarkable tone of wet pine soaked with all sorts of tropical, musty, fresh fruityness seeping with mango, peach, pineapple, and green grape mush. You can smell it the second it pours into the glass....wonderfully forward and pungent with fresh hops.  Dullish tropical fruity sweetness superseeds over a sticky pine sap tone thats seemingly dark and deceptively light with a creamy centered bite and low toned bitterness of fluffy pine and orange oils. Great balance in the taste here. Hop Slam delivers a bold, yet yielding balance of hops and malts that creates one hell of a one two punch to the delight of the taste buds. One punch of hops that brings in pine and orangey oil stuff, two, malts are sweet and sticky with a semi creamyness providing a down slide for the hops in which to ride down and grab all sorts of mixtures within the tropical wellness of vitamin filled pith, oils, skins, and crushed fruit.  Light and fluffy, but somehow weighted and oily with a wonderfully smooth creamyness that hides behind a feathery dryness of toothened hop bite and tropical pithyness that lasts and floats; and floats and lasts. Again, the balance here is quite favorable and welcome. No ABV evident until late after the glass or two has emptied...  A very nice IPA2!! Bell's did their homework with this one. The balance is spectacular! I could, and can, drink this til' tomorrow. In a word...YUM!",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",Imperial IPA,98

Some bready, yeast notes as well.  Sweet and astringent citrus hoppiness up front. Turns into a melange of resiny pine tars, caramel sweetness and grapefruit midtongue. Leaves a long lasting bitter aftertaste.  Medium to full bodied, fairly rich.

287,17112,ahking,3.94,"Here is something nice. The best characteristic of this beer is the aroma. I poured this into one of those big Duvel glasses to get my nose right in there. Rich, earthy, fresh, grassy, citrus, are all words to describe the aroma. So classic and comforting a smell. Pours a rich autumnal orange, the color you only see in changing leaves and campfires. Decent head that dissipated quickly. I saw that this beer is at 106 IBU's and while I can believe it, it doesn't hit you over the head with hops as much as I expected. It has such a rich and creamy malt profile that it is very well balanced (as opposed to a beer like Hazed and Infused where it is essentially hop juice). Speaking of flavor, there is a lot going on here. I can taste tons of fruit character: pineapple, citrus; along with great hearty breadiness. Hops are majorly present in the taste as well. I suppose that this is worth the 17 dollars a six pack I paid (crazy, eh? but I love that local craft breweries are not afraid to take risks and make beers like this -- thus I must buy them and support the efforts to make American brewing even better).",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",Imperial IPA,98

Very piney on the hops side (I'd love to know what kind of hops are in here). Not much citrus or honey at all - all piney hops. The taste is very good. Very piney but not overly bitter like some DIPA's. The mouthfeel is great it bites at you all the way through. The only reason I didn't give it a 5 for drinkability is the 9% abv.

Impossible to get around the citrusy hops at first whiff, grapefruit and oranges, plus pineapple, tangerine, and you name it whatever else. Fresh and floral, and there was a distinct mustiness that under lied all of it. Oh yeah, there was some malt in there too evidently, you could start to smell some sweetness, then WOOMP! the hops are back in your face.  The taste was much the same as the aroma, and that is a good thing. Juicy fruits, orange, grapefruit, pineapple, apricot, mango. The malt is a bit more apparent in the flavor, sweet almost like apple cider, and is thick enough to support this massive dose of hops.

It is dominated by hoppy grapefruit smell ,and some pepper and pine is in the background.  T - Nowhere near as bitter as I was expecting. It is very balanced. Starts off witha nice citrusy flavor and then your mouth is bombarded with grapefruit and bitterness. Compared to the Stoudts DIPA, and even Celebration Ale this didnt seem as bitter, but much more balanced.  M - creamy and somwhat rough on the toungue. At the same time it is thin and not cloying.  D - very easy goin...this is a DIPA???? I could easily drink a few of these...if it wasnt for the abv that is. For being a DIPA and 9.3% abv, this drinks extremley smooth.  I was expecting a super complex hopbomb, but instead got a very smooth and balanced DIPA, which can be hard to find. Reminded me of 2 Hearted Ale on steriods. I was expecting a little more, but still very tasty and worth the hype. Bells is known for making smooth, balanced brews , and this is a great example of what they are capable of.  when i look back now , my taste buds might have been jaded from so many dipas ha, this is pretty bitter, but I still stand by my comments when I say its very balanced",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",Imperial IPA,98
287,17112,danielocean03,4.32,"2007 Release  From a 12oz brown bottle, Bell's Batch number 8278 Poured a semi-traslucent coppery hued orange with a quickly dissipating bone-white head of foam that leaves moderate sticky lacing. Aroma is primarily grassy and floral hop notes, sweet grapefruit and citrus notes, caramel malt undertones. Taste is very much of the same, big hoppiness right up front, juicy grapefruit, practically seamless transition into the malty backbone. Seems sweeter than the 2006 release, less brutal hoppiness overall. Leaves a slightly drying lightly bitter aftertaste. Medium bodied brew with lower levels of carbonation, washes down the gullet smooth and easy. Suprisingly well balanced, I had a few of these from last year's introductory batch and they seemed hoppier than this. Ovearall an outstanding IIPA at any rate.  2006 Release  Poured a slightly hazed coppery golden color with a full finger of bone white head that slowly fell back to a sticky lacing that coats the glass. Smell is grapefruity citrus, huge hoppy punch of hop resins and piney hops, also a big malty sweet backbone holding all of these huge aromas together. This beer is as hoppy as they come. Taste is much more of the same, starts sweet and of caramel maltiness before quickly becoming the grapefruity and citrusy flavors that lead onwards into the hoppy depths of this beast. Gargantuan hoppiness delivered with a bitterness and drying aftertaste to match. Mouthfeel is medium bodied with milder carbonation, slick and viscous brew. Drinkability is outstanding considering the 106 IBU's and 9.3% abv, staggering stats like that would make many beers undrinkable, yet Bell's has made this one enjoyable in a big way. The alcohol is hardly noticeable past the hoppiness, great bittering hop bite. Easily one of the best DIPA's I've ever had the pleasure of drinking.

The aroma reminds me a lot of Two Hearted Ale, but with some added pine. The taste is like drinking a pine tree. There is resin everywhere with some citrus balancing things out. There is no malt backbone to speak of; this is all hops. The mouthfeel is nearly full bodied, chewy, and has nice carbonation. Overall, I really like this beer, but I would choose THA over it anyday.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",Imperial IPA,98
287,17112,goodbyeohio,3.94,"thanks mr. wilson  cloudy first-piss-of-the-morning color with intricately sticky lacing. lots of melting mountains, thin beams, dots and some cascading bubblefalls. not much activity in the body here.  very fresh, botanical leafiness in the aroma. a faint hint of cheese and/or sex. earthy lime rind essence and the smallest dash of grapefruit juice concentrate. certainly different, but still powerful, complex, and very fresh.  tastes great, although a little boozy in the finish. ok, alot boozy. but the flavor is here. vegetal base, carrots, and a muted caramel finish. hops throughout, much more piney and citrusey than the hippie foot odor would lead you to believe. the hops run a little bit into the pine-sol region, but every sip (warmth) helps to even that out. oily bitterness up front which sticks around through the pineapple-grapefruit finish in a physically tongue-coating fashion. this is a double ipa for 2006, matching the similar success in uniqueness of beers like weyerbacher double simcoe and goose island iipa. this beer is a little confused and lacks focus. it still tastes good, and i can see it improving worlds with a batch #2.  drinkability? despite the booziness, it goes down quick and has a perfect level of carbonation. i will have no problem finishing six of these brews.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",Imperial IPA,98
287,17112,murrayswine,4.37,"Pours a beautiful pale golden into my crappy micro-light pint glass. The head on this beaut is solid and steady with sticky lacing.  The smell is piny and boozy all at once, which kinda leads to it being a bit over balanced. Think I'll let it warm up a dram, let some hops kick up.  WOW, warming it up a tad was a damn good Idea this bad boy gets sticky and power hopped, but, alas the booze still rears itself with this background creamed butter taste.  If you like hops with a balanced respectability, this beer is for you!",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",Imperial IPA,98
287,17112,proc,4.3,"Hoppy? Yes. Overly hoppy in a sprain your tongue kind of way? No.  This one pours out to a good-looking copperish color in the glass with a decent-sized head. The aroma is that of pine and citrus. The taste is solid as a rock, with the citrus aroma carrying over to the flavor profile. Traces of grapefruit, orange and lemon are present that give way to a very, easy to swallow finish. Its hard to believe the ABV of this is 9.3%. Its hidden very well.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",Imperial IPA,98

Look forward to getting a bunch of this in the bottle but the draft version is certainly nice...a juiced up 2 hearted, kind of  mouthfeel: medium body, moderate bitterness, sugary sweet, syrupy  drinkability: good",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",Imperial IPA,98
287,17112,beerphan,4.25,"12oz bottle -&gt; imperial pint batch 7690, brewed October 25, 2006  Pours a hazed lightly coppered orange, with gold highlights. A big frothy orange julius colored head settles to a soft pillow. Spiderweb lace up and down the glass but not very abundent. A few floaties on the pour settle to the bottom of the glass.  Nose: Huge pineapple blast off a citrus dominated nose. Intense.  Taste: Initial sweet citrus hop tingle along with a nice thick malt back. Bitterness is not overwhelming but refreshing and sweet on the palate while lingering for a bit. The taste is much more balanced than the nose.  Mouth: NIce creamy DIPA mouth.  Man, i could drink a ton of this stuff if it wasn't so pricey. Would of liked to seen this in a bomber where one would be nice and two would be a blast. Glad i got to try it.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",Imperial IPA,98
287,17112,Osiris9588,4.6,"12oz bottle, batch #7690, bottled on 10/25. Pours a honey color with orange and yellow accents. The white 2-finger head is creamy and forms into a stiff cap that stays around after several sips. Copious strands of fluffy, sticky lacing cling to the inside of the glass.  The aroma is domainated by dry, piney hops, very herbal. The flavor is all about the hops as well, yet is balanced, and the herby, piney, almost a little bit of tree bark, grapefruit, along with lemon and orange peel, comes out in the complex flavor as well.  The mouth is big and complex, great carbonation, well balance, dry and bitter on the end after a bright, citrusy middle. Extremely well balanced, and I think drinkable for even non-hop heads if they give it a chance to warm and their palates to adjust a bit. Phenomenal.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",Imperial IPA,98
287,17112,feloniousmonk,4.65,"Hazy orange hue, fine slice of bone white froth atop.  In the aroma, it's all pungent, spikey, in-your-face hoppitude! Tropical fruit on top, pineapple, lemon, grapefruit,mango, raw, pulpy and vibrant. Pine forest floor, and more. Slightly sweet citric feel, but bitter hop feel dominates.  Taste: once more, a charge of hops on the tongue, not delivered too lightly. Same citric flavor storms the palate, but a second after it boards, there's a nice, creamy relief. Rolls playfully on the tongue, like a cat on the rug preoccupied with string. Each new sip imparts this deliciousness, but despite the huge !BUs and way-up-there ABV, you 'd hardly know it.  Amazingly easy to drink, if you're a hop craver like me. Wow! Tangy, potent hoppy twang never quits the mouth. Incredibly full bodied, long-finished, and commendably created. Mmmm, delicious!  A pricey beer, (I paid $14 a 6-pack), but well worth it. One hell of an IPA, and a well-named one! Thanks for delivering the goods, Larry & co! Now, I just can't wait to tap a keg of it!",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",Imperial IPA,98
287,17112,adams82,4.47,"""The Batch ID that you entered '7690', is a Bell's HopSlam Ale. Your Bell's HopSlam Ale was packaged on October 25, 2006""  A super fresh hop-head delight! Not even two weeks old as of this review!  A: Pours a nice, bright and clear golden/orange color. Head is nice and creamy, fluffy and white. Leaves a nice lacing and remains throughout the entire glass.  S: Big nose here; smells like a freshly popped bag of hops! Slightly sweet and fruity floral notes surround the big hope aroma on this one. A good indication of things to come I'm sure!  T: HopSlam starts sweet, fruity and slightly toasty; the malts strike the first blow and lend a great balance to this beer. The middle and finish are huge as hops attack from all sides! The hops begin with a citric assault on your tongue and then finish a little on the fruity side. Not overpowering at all, this has struck a great balance. Awesome flavor... I've been sipping on it for the past few minutes and dreading the bottom of the glass!  M&D: Creamy, full bodied and just the right amount of carbonation make this a joy, feels like liquid silk. HopSlam is easy to drink down, smooth and very inviting. This is a wonderfully balanced DIPA and I for one wouldn't have a problem drinking this all the time!  Simply put, a great DIPA. This lends a great hop character without being intimidating. Bell's has hit this one out of the park! They keep the serious hop head satisfied instead of reaching for an insance amount of IBUs.  Larry, please tell us this one will be around every fall. HopSlam is truly exceptional!",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",Imperial IPA,98
287,17112,TastyTaste,4.54,"Appearance: Medium gold color, hazy. Doesn't look like many-a DIPA. Small white head fades slowly, leaving ok lace.  Smell: The fruitiest smelling beer that contains no fruit that I have ever encountered. Pineapple, strawberries, all verys ugary and delicious. I can tell this will be a hop bomb.  Taste: Rich and hoppy, the fruit flavors transfer over quite nicely. Alcohol bolsters the brash bitterness of the beer. The aftertaste is great, but initially there is something slightly off, but it's not bad, and leads into hop nirvana.  Drinkability: A fine addition to the strata of interesting DIPAs, fruity, highly hoppy, and very easy to drink, that is, if you like hops.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",Imperial IPA,98
287,17112,CortexBomb,4.6,"Deep orange with some cloudiness, a nice head on top, about an inch thick, white. Smell is mostly floral, strong and distinct.  Flavour starts off floral, from the nose, and maintains a sort of sweet, hoppy tang, a unique aspect that I've never noticed in another IPA or DIPA...in retrospect, this might be the honey. Malts are definitely more present than in most beers of this style though, and do a very nice job of balancing out the strong hop profile. Near the end, some mild pine notes also become evident and some nice back of the tongue bitters arrive with the swallow. I really like this one a lot.  Mouthfeel, decent but not amazing for the style. I do expect a bit more in the way of hop aggression on the tongue, and Hopslam was somewhat gentle in that regard. The drinkability was flat out exceptional though, this is a very easy drinking beer for its depth and heaviness.  The bottom line: This is a damn fine beer and one of the best in its style that I have had. The hop profile is strong and also unique, and the beer is remarkably well balanced in flavour for being as big as it is. I never thought Bell's would be able to outdo their Two Hearted Ale, but I definitely think they have with this one...hopefully it becomes a regular seasonal offering!",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",Imperial IPA,98
287,17112,mcallister,4.47,"Damn nice looking DIPA. A light copper/gold somewhat hard too see too the other side. Nice white frothy head of great length finally leaves some sticky scattered lace down the glass.  Awesome aromas abound. A smack in the face of piney sweet hops with hints of citrusy hops on the backside. A bit of lemon and grapefruit. Very fresh and fruity.  This is one of those DIPA's that I could sit and drink all day. Great flavor both in balance and complexity. A nice malt backbone is dominated by resiny piney hops, that lead into a grapefruit citrus long finish. There are some hints of alcohol both on the mid palate and in the chest but it does not deter me from wanting more and more.  The mouthfeel is what I expect from a grea DIPA. Medium non lingering or chunky. Just sweet bitter hops that fade and leave you wanting more. Did I mention this is easy drinking.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",Imperial IPA,98
287,17112,Mdog,4.48,"Appearance: Bright gold, good carbonation.  Smell: Citrus.  Taste: I was expecting a brutal hop assault, but was pleasantly surprised with the balance of this beer. Started with some sweetness then moved towards a resiny, grassy bitterness with less citrus than I thought there would be from the smell.  Mouthfeel: Crisp and refreshing.  Drinkability: Hides its strength well and doesn't leave your tongue numb after one bottle.  Going in, I thought this might be like Two-Hearted on steroids as far as bitterness, but this was a very well-balanced beer. It is hoppy, but is more balanced than many DIPAs. I know I'll get some more!",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",Imperial IPA,98
287,17112,Frozensoul327,4.6,"A: Slightly hazy orange golden apperance with a decent white foam head. Good lacing inside the glass. Medium level of carbonation.  S: Holy Hop load! Lots of hops and citrus notes, with the everpresent element of pine. Some sweet sugary notes mixed in as well. Very much like Two-Hearted, but pumped up to the next level, so to speak.  T: I had trouble putting this one down. Bitter hop oils attack the mouth, with a mild, yet present buttery malt note. The hops continue their trek and bloom into a citrusy sweet finish with a hint of green pine. Wow. Very little indication of the higher ABV.  M: Medium to full bodied. Dense, yet not choking. Oily and a touch syrupy. Nice.  D: Dangerously good, even at 9.3% ABV. This one will creep up and whack you over the head with a hearty dose of alcohol. Watch out.  Notes: A very good hoppy ale. One of the best i've had. My only complaint is the crappy limited production. This really should have a longer production run, if not year round availablity. What can I say? Larry Bell has one of his biggest hits yet, and it's gonna be gone in no time! That pisses me off, but in a good way!",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",Imperial IPA,98
287,17112,alexgash,4.79,"Glad to get my grubby hands on this! Slight haze in a brassy orange body. Tight finger of dirty, off-white head. Nose is pure liquid hop flowers. It seriously smells like a freshly opened package of Simcoe/Centennial/??? flowers. Since I love this smell, I am in heaven right now. But, there's also a solid sugar honey malt background, along with some fruity alcohol. Bitter, acidic, hopslaught up front. Assaultive, but delicious. Hop burn stays, as sugary, tropical fruit malt swells and provides a hint of balance. The hint gets shrugged off by a dry, resinous, ganja-infused, bitter finish. My tongue is ""bruised"" but happy. Medium-body, with a mouth-lacquering feel. Dry finish. This stuff is good and worth the wait!",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",Imperial IPA,98
287,17112,HellsBELLS24,5,Wow!   The much anticipated release of Bells Hopslam finally came on 11/3/06.  The smell of fresh hops is uncomparable to any other Double IPA. The aroma fills the air once you start to pour this brew. It has a nice goden color with a lightly colored head. The taste is awsome. It starts calm with a super slamming hop finish towards the end. There is a hint of citrus flavor as well. I believe that the abv is closer to 10% rather than the listed 9.3%  I recommend this Double IPA to any hop head. Another great brew by Larry.,Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",Imperial IPA,98
287,17112,Sephiroth,4.5,"Pours with moderate head, beautiful lacing, color is straw-like with a hint of orange. Smells incredibly fresh, which it is of course. A cacophony of citrus aromas combine with a sprinkling of pine, and a sweet booziness.  Taste is dry for the style, which is a good thing for me. Grapefruit is the dominant flavor, the finish is clean and bitter. Mouthfeel is quite resinous, great drinkability as usual from Bell's.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",Imperial IPA,98
287,17112,Wildman,4.37,"Always look forward to trying a new double IPA, especially when it's from Bell's. This beer poured a cloudy yellow color and formed a foamy white head the coated the glass with lace as it quickly subsided. A small amount of carbonation is present. An aroma of hops, both citrus styles-orange and grapefruit pointing to more hops than the Two Hearted. The flavor was of hops, citrus orange and grapefruit with a hint of caramel. The finish on this beer is a bit astrigent and the hops bitterness figure heavily as well, while adding a slightly creamy body. Similar to other double IPAs, but definately has that Bell style to it. A great beer, but at the alcohol level and price per 6 pack, probably still drink more Two Hearted than this. For these styles, I really wish they would make four paks or use bombers.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",Imperial IPA,98
287,17112,SupaCelt,4.27,"This exciting beverage emerged from the bottle with an attractive orange copper colour to it. A decent head of dusty white billowed early but fell to a layer of spitty skim in short time. Gobs of lace cling in the aftermath. The carbonation is moderate and persistent. This looks like a good one. Clear and clean as well.  The nose is rife with green hoppy aromatics. It reminds me of a couple of my favorites, but this one also carries with it a peculiar fruitiness that is hard for me to pin down. It could be apricot. It could be pear juice. It could be pink grapefruit. At any rate the nose is succulent. Grassy and herbal. Fruity. Pines. Resin. Sap. You can almost smell the dryness.  The taste is very nice. It is dry from the jump. Citrus flavours abound. I would surely say there is some grapefruit impression here, but the aforementioned fruit that I am so hard pressed to identify lends its presence to the mix as well. This is rather splendid. You have a profound dryness that is antagonized by this bizarre juiciness, and a bitterness that is totally deceptive and quite pleasant. This feels nearly anesthetic to my oropharynx and I think even my limbs are tingling with lupulin inluence as well. Hops are a drug. No doubt about it. The alcohol is almost completely obscured and it works so well in tandem with the hop properties. Anyone who says this style is boring and is lacking in complexity should try this beer. Every sip I taste flips the script on me. It is amazing.  The mouthfeel is smooth and comes in at a medium level. The flavours morph and twist making this thing a magic act in its own right.  The drinkability is easy for me. I live for a beer like this. A total sensory bludgeoning with precision and complexity. The feeling of well being that has settled upon me is wonderous. This is easily my favorite beer from Bell's. Is this going to be an annual release or a one off? Please, keep it coming! A great celebration ale. Call me immature and unrefined if you wish, but this beer needs to be felt.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",Imperial IPA,98
287,17112,beaglemac,4.57,"Kudos to Larry and the Bell's brewers. This is a great beer.  I blindly bought a case of this at the Bell's general store (as I love IPA's especially 2IPA). At $44 a case/$12 a 6er. I figured Bell's must know this is a good beer.  Poured into a pint glass from a bottle. Started clear, but quickly turned a clearish orange in color. Small head, which dissipated quickly.  Taste: at first a fruity taste hits yours tongue followed quickly by the bitterness you would expect from a DIPA. A little less harsh bitterness then I expected, but none-the-less it is present. As for the fruit taste, I cannot put my finger on it, as stated before, it could be grapefruit and apricot, but not sure. It sure is special.  Mouthfeel: As stated before, less harsh then most DIPAs, and quite smooth.  I will be enjoying this case and maybe a few more for many weeks.  GOOD WORK BELL'S!",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",Imperial IPA,98
287,17112,EvilKeith,4.32,"HopSlam started pouring into the tumbler crystal clear. As the last of the bottle emptied into the glass a yeast or sediment cloud formed, it had the appearance of an inverted lava lamp. So, Ill call it a cloudy burnt orange color with a frothy off-white head that fell to a cap. The lace began spotty, but as the beer warmed the coverage improved and remained thick and sticky. That was the first time I ever saw that happen. The smell was green leafy hops, grapefruit citrus, sweet apricot fruitiness, sweet malts and a faint whiff of alcohol. The taste began with a flash of sweetness that was overtaken by grapefruit citrus. This was immediately followed by hop bitterness and a citric acidity that seemed to numb the surface of my tongue. The fruity apricot made an appearance toward the end, with spicy, peppery alcohol and a dryness at the finish. The body was medium plus, fine bubbles made up the moderate carbonation. The mouthfeel was slick, but somehow still smooth. Another winner from Bells. My numbers could have been a little higher for the mouthfeel, but Im not sure about the numbness on my tongue.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",Imperial IPA,98
287,17112,hellfire,4.17,"Tried this beer at Bell's, sounded intriguing. Have to echo what others have said, the stupid plastic cup they served it in really bothered me for some reason.  The smell of this was incredible -- very strong and sweet. Looked cloudy and orange-tan. Taste was hoppy, hoppy, and hoppier. I don't know why I expected any different from a beer named ""Hop Slam!""  Very drinkable - I still prefer the Two Hearted for hop flavor but not overwhelmingly so. If you're a hop fan you'll love this beer!  I will certainly enjoy drinking this again, though.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",Imperial IPA,98
287,17112,CRJMellor,4.72,"Pours a hazy, cloudy pale maber with yellowish tints. Only produces a small ring of white head but does throw some lace onto the glassware. Aroma is hops, hops and more hops. Citrus and sweet pine hop aroma with some flowers, cut hay, resins and some bubblegum. Flavor is light caramel and pale malt undercurrent with a serious ass infusion of hops and hop oil. Imagine Two-Hearted on steroids ! The last beer I had the night before this was Hop Wallop (great beer) and IMHO this one put it to shame on the IBU chart. Mouthfeel actually starts with a sweet light citrus touch but then just absolutely slaughter of the tongue and tastebuds with a teeth numbing, eye watering bitterness. Not harsh in any sense, but very powerful. Actually left a somewhat sweet aftertaste as it finished with just a touch of an alcoholic hit. Drinkability - I never thought I would say this about beer but its almost to hoppy, ""almost"" is key word. Absolutely overwhelming with the palate coating bitterness, but I still want more.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",Imperial IPA,98
287,17112,beernbbq,4.5,"Had a HopSlam on my trip to the HomePort.  Appearance - Similar to Two-Hearted but even cloudier. Rich white head that stay's with the beer throughout, even in the plastic cup they serve 16oz beers in. Aroma - a citrus-y orange-grapefruit. Taste - powerful hop domination bu believe it or not, the malt still weighs in. Creamy on the mouth, and perilously drinkable as the alcohol weighs in after the glass is gone. Has a taste profile similar to DFH 90 min, but has that more citrusy taste, as opposed to DFH's gin-like taste. Great stuff, hope they put this in the bottle for all the hopheads.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",Imperial IPA,98
