22,30,DFred,4.25,"This Belgian Dark Strong Ale pours a deep, dusky brown with a massive tan head and aromas of Belgian yeast, caramel malts, and dark fruits including raisin, fig, plum, and black cherry. The flavor profile includes rich bread malt, caramel, dark fruit sweetness, Belgian yeast, and spices with a smooth, slightly sweet finish. Medium to heavier-bodied with strong carbonation, it's an authentic interpretation of the style that is exceptionally drinkable. The appearance is a dark brown with a fluffy tan head, good retention, and lacing. The taste is fruity with a mild spice note and finishes pretty dry. Overall, it's an excellent beer.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Belgian Dark Strong Ale,94

S: Red apple skin, wood, light vinegar, cherries, dark fruits, caramelized malts, a hint of brown bread, raisins, a suggestion of clove.

O: Much palate flavor to this exceptional Belgian-styled ale. It is a pleasure to drink this beer. Said bottle is from a variety 6pk. Each beer is simply outstanding. All have a common identity in taste & feel through a central axis of yeast which links them. Quite easy drinking and outstanding in its style.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Belgian Dark Strong Ale,94

Medium bodied with a thinnish, slick mouthfeel. Rum-soaked raisins on the palate with faint cocoa and dried figs. Finishes limp, a bit sweet and mildly boozy.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Belgian Dark Strong Ale,94
22,30,IvoryBilledWoodpecker,3.97,"Dark walnut brown, reddish when light shines through. Tall head with good retention and some lacing. Lots of malty aroma. Malty flavors evolve through different spices and eventually into light smoke late on the long finish. Phenolic. No real alcoholic flavor despite ABV. Good feel in mouth. Gets better the more you drink of it.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Belgian Dark Strong Ale,94
22,30,harrypowers,4.35,"Pours a dark brown with a run-away long lived tan head and a lot of lacing.  Smells of toasted malt and yeast with some sweet fruit.  Tastes of sweet, toasted malt, yeast, raisins, plumbs and spice with a warm alcohol finish.  Medium light body and light carbonation after the head recedes. Smooth mouthfeel.  This is one excellent, powerful sipper!",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Belgian Dark Strong Ale,94
22,30,timobkg,4.76,"Trois Pistoles pours a ruby red so dark as to be almost black with a thick off-white head that lasts forever.  The aroma brings to mind dark fruits such as cherries, plums, and strawberry jam, with a hint of dark chocolate underneath.  The flavour brings across all those dark fruit notes with just a hint of sweetness, and introduces the dark chocolate notes on the finish. There's a layered complexity and balance to the flavours that I only find in exceptional Belgian beers.  The carbonation is effervescent and gives the beer a really rich, decadent mouth feel. The 9% alcohol is very well hidden.  This is a truly fantastic beer! An awesome Belgian Dark ale, I think it compares very favourably against Quadruples as well. This is one of the tastiest, most complex and well balanced Belgians I've had, and everyone I've introduced this beer to has come away impressed. Unibroue has really outdone themselves here.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Belgian Dark Strong Ale,94
22,30,WunderLlama,4.22,"Bottle poured into a nonic  Brewers Notes: Drawing on Quebec folklore, Unibroue chose the name Trois Pistoles to honour the city’s historic importance and pay homage to the legend of the Black Horse. Conjured up by a priest to help build a new church, this incarnation of the devil ran off when its bridle was removed. Because construction was still underway when the horse vanished, a stone remains missing from the church to this day.  Dark cola like liquid capped by a foamy taupe foam which recedes to a thin layer  Aroma is malts, dark fruits , raisins, figs  Taste is dark fruits, figs, raisins , malts  Mouthfeel is soft , fizzy  Good beer",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Belgian Dark Strong Ale,94
22,30,robwired,4.39,"Poured a thundercloud of foam into a Gordon Biersch Maibock glass. The aroma was sweet malty with a hint of coriander. The taste has spice with stone fruit with a medium creamy mouthfeel that easily settles on the palate. Without a hint of the ABV, it's between sippable and crushable, though it's for sipping for flavor.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Belgian Dark Strong Ale,94
22,30,mnredsoxfan69,4.26,"A: Pours a deep brown with a brief 3 finger tan head that fades to a smooth cap. It leaves lots of soapy lacing on the sides.  S: Aromas of caramel and molasses. No hop aromas.  T: Taste follows the nose. And with only 15.5 IBUs, you're not going to taste any hops, either.  F: Smooth with tingling carbonation, moderately full bodied. At 9% it's strong, but it's not going to knock you on your butt.  O: Overall, it's a good value. An excellent take on Belgian-style strong dark, by a solid Canadian brewery. This and Maudite are probably my favorites from UniBroue.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Belgian Dark Strong Ale,94
22,30,Whyteboar,4.49,"I bought this for the Trippel tasting weekend, not sure why, but here we are. Obviously rating as a Belgian style Dark Ale. Poured dark, like reddish cola and managed to get about 5 mm of head of beige foam which pretty much stayed the whole time. The aroma was more dark fruits like raisins and prunes; not sweet at all, very pleasant. The taste followed, mouth-filling flavor of malty goodness. The feel was almost viscous, which considering all the flavor and the ABV, it made perfect sense. Excellent sipper. This one turned out to be a happy mistake, I'll definitely revisit it on purpose.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Belgian Dark Strong Ale,94
22,30,CBlack85,4.36,"Poured from a 12 oz bottle into a New Belgium Globe Glass  Pours a murky dark mahogany color with some reddish hues, and a medium tan head that recedes quickly leaving behind a moderate amount of lacing  The aroma is sweet; consisting of cherries, raisins, dates, brown sugar, a mild spiciness, and a pronounced booziness.  The flavor follows the nose closely, with a mix raisins, plums, cherries, brown sugar, molasses, and a hint of spiciness. Also, as with the nose, there is a strong booziness, but not overly strong, just enough to alert you to the 9% abv. Full bodied and moderately carbonated.  Overall, this is a very nice beer that I will be revisiting",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Belgian Dark Strong Ale,94
22,30,AlexandraDen,4.23,"Pours a cloudy, very dark brown with a finger thick head of tightly packed bubbles.  As with many of Unibroue’s offerings, they have a hallmark style with their Belgians — leans fruity, and leans on the subtler yet complex side of things. This is no different. Complex nose that is hard to pick apart the malty side, spiced fruitcake, gentle cloves, fresh dark fruits like cherry. Molasses and toffee.  Flavour follows the nose pretty tightly. Alcohol is well hidden but the warmth it has adds a dimension to the flavour profile, a woody sherry like flavour. More malt here than on the nose, especially on the finish which recalls toasted bread and spongy chocolate coffered toffee and sugared apples. Bits of yeastiness wax and wane throughout your palate as you sip it.  Incredible mouthfeel. It foams very, very hard in your mouth but the carbonation is not particularly prickly. This gives it a very foamy mouthfeel on the way down. Medium bodied beer that is relatively sweet, no real bitterness here. Medium-high level of carbonation, especially noticeable in that sip, but the carbonation is not overly biting. Nice subtle but long finish leaving a gentle sweetness, yeasty grains, and dark fruits on the palate.  As mentioned before, I find almost all of Unibroue’s offerings to be milder on the flavour strength than Belgian styles from Belgium itself. That doesn’t make it bad, but they lean towards a more mild and complex flavour profile. They also tend to be more fruity than malty, and that is the case here. They write that rum flavours abound in the nose and palate, my experience has been with the fruity side of the beer it has a strong port or sherry side rather than rum, but you can get a rum taste. It’s just not as strong as other Belgian styles or malty Eisbocks.  Overall it’s quite a formidable beer, just as good as anything out of Belgium, while carving out its own unique niche and noticeable flavour profile on its own. At the same time, mild enough to be enjoyed by any beer drinker, even though new to the style. Unibroue really does not tend to miss on any of their beers",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Belgian Dark Strong Ale,94

I’m gone.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Belgian Dark Strong Ale,94
22,30,milkshakebeersucks,4.36,"A real beauty to look at, from the dark brown body to the large, lasting tan head to the graceful lace. Layers of rich malts in the aroma where you can pick out dark fruit, pitted fruit, molasses, brown bread and probably a few other favorite descriptors. Just don't count on too many hop varieties. Taste leans the same way although the hops come into play a bit more. Spiciness is more noticeable, especially in the aftertaste. Sweetness is a factor while bitterness is minimal. Mouthfeel is full bodied and decently carbonated. Check the ABV before guzzling more than two.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Belgian Dark Strong Ale,94

22,30,Aleforge,4.18,"Thick creamy head that can runaway if not poured carefully. Good amount of lacing that doesn't have any intentions of leaving. Strong dark grainy, slightly sweet smell. Strong sour notes, light bitterness and classic Belgian taste. Somewhat astringent on the backend.  I love Unibroue's offerings and this one doesn't fail to impress. For sure in the top tier Belgians. You can tell it's strong however as the alcohol is present.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Belgian Dark Strong Ale,94

22,30,schoolboy,4.04,"It was nice to pick up three Unibroue singles a few weeks ago. This was the one new-to-me brew of the bunch. And what a great brew it is. Unibroue seems to always make very easy drinking versions of styles that are often not the easiest.  This pours a gorgeous deep brown with tons of fine foamy head. The aroma is subdued (my beer is warming), but appetizing and a bit boozy. The taste is delicious malts and yeast. I don't think this sample is very old, but this style would age well. I should get a sixer and put some up.  Recommended. I will be happy to have this again some time - it is a nice and easy version of the style while not being phony or wimpy.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Belgian Dark Strong Ale,94
22,30,TheRatCage,4.14,"L: Dark brown color, not quite black. Tan tall head that dissipates into a centimeter of coating on top. Moderate lacing that sticks.  S: Black cherries. Sweet malt. Undertones of alcohol. I might be crazy but it smells a little bit like coca-cola.  T: sweet and thick are the dominant characteristics. More dark fruit, cherry and raisin. Bitter/sharp on the back end that can make it feel not as heavy as it really is.  F: medium-full bodied. A nice level of carbonation.  O: close in profile to Belgian darks. Has some interesting qualities of fruit and tartness but still doesn’t top actually Belgian’s to me. Still very good.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Belgian Dark Strong Ale,94
22,30,DDiFran,4.6,Nothing to say that hasn’t already been said. Impeccably well crafted example of the style. Hard to believe it’s not made by monks in a Belgian Abby. Oh Canada!,Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Belgian Dark Strong Ale,94

22,30,Sigmund,4.24,"330 ml bottle, courtesy of Cardinal pub, Stavanger. Dark brown beer with a huge beige head. Very fine and complex aroma with vinous notes, also notes of oak, spices, cocoa, red berries and dark fruits, hints of barnyard and tobacco. The flavour is sweet, vinous and fruity, quite smooth for 9% ABV beer. Moderate hops. Many of the elements of the aroma stay with you through the flavour and aftertaste. An excellent beer!",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Belgian Dark Strong Ale,94
22,30,MonDak_Joe1953,4.29,"12oz bottle. Stamped on bottle neck is Best By date of '01-07-23'. Deep brown colored body, with a red/copper backlit body. Multi finger light beige colored head. Leaves some strings and partial walls of lacing. Aroma of the earthy, metallic yeast, along with apple, date, and cherry, with a little dark malt. Taste is cherry and date fruit, and some dark malt; this combo is sweet. Mainly at the end is the yeast, which dries out the palate through the after taste. Mouth feel is full. Some spiciness on the tongue. The higher ABV% does bring a boldness. Very good carbonation. Low bitterness. The dryness at the end entices another sip but be careful with the 9%; it will warm you up in the hurry. Would be a good food pairing with a sharp or strong cheese, or with a stew or lasagna.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Belgian Dark Strong Ale,94
22,30,dave_j_mke,4.37,"A: Dark brown with a light khaki head that dissipates quickly but leaves behind a fine lacing around the edge of the glass (tulip). S: Dried fruit (cherries and dates) up front followed by Belgian yeast, malt, and some alcohol. T: Sweet and full. More dried fruit and maybe even a little browned apple. It has a port wine character up front. The finish is classic Belgian phenolic yeast. Spices, fruits, a bit of hot alcohol on the exhale and a clean, lingering finish. M: Medium bodied with a lot of tingly carbonation.  A great beer to pair with a meal. It's not too sweet and not too dry. The carbonation clears you palate for the next bite or sip.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Belgian Dark Strong Ale,94

Tastes like their tripel with some dank spice added (shoutout to Gothic King Cobra). Kinda tastes like alcoholic coca cola, very sweet stuff. Little bit of spice and fruit and smoke. Give it time to warm and it shines  It's a little too sweet, but once in a while this makes for a nice experience. Good campfire beer",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Belgian Dark Strong Ale,94

I am not exactly sure what I am tasting but it is not my favorite flavor. I don't want to downgrade it too much as this is just my personal impression based upon my taste buds. It is not a bad Bel Strong Dark Ale, but I can't rate it higher than I did. Your mileage may vary!",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Belgian Dark Strong Ale,94
22,30,PathofChaos,4.25,"Appearance: Dark brown, through and through. Not black with a brown tint, not mocha, just good ole, plain ole dark brown. Sort of a rarity among the beers I’m acquainted with. Froths up a tremendous, beige-cream head that’s a full two finger-width’s deep. It dwindles down to a more manageable layer that laces like snow flurries on a window.  Bouquet: An unusual but enjoyable aroma of smokey raisins, orange zest, brown sugar, and Belgian yeast.  Feel: A medium body with confidence issues, compensating with vivid, peppery carbonation that’s surprisingly pleasurable. Has a dry linger that’s just a tad sticky.  Taste: Much like the scent, this ale’s flavor is complex and unorthodox, but tasty. Dark wheat dryness, candied orange peel, earthy prunes and baked banana chips, all wrapped up in a warming blanket of allspice.

22,30,Alexc11,4.38,"A lot is going on here. And in a good way. Beautiful rich looking appearance with thick, foamy head that recedes fairly quickly. Deep, brown color with reddish hue. The main characteristics for scent is in the fig, prune, molasses along with malt and caramel realm. Like I said pretty eclectic. Taste matches these aromas plus a touch of coffee bean I think. Definitely a nice spicy, peppery kick on the pallet and finish. High ABV is balance off nicely and doesn't feel heavy. I'd say it's a dry finish, elevated carbonation but little bitterness. Perfect for a s****y day like this in the middle of January while watching football here in the North east part of the continent (Quebec).",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Belgian Dark Strong Ale,94

Taste is and assault of dark fruits: plums, raisins, cherries and more with dark malt, coriander and a hint of floral hops rounding it out.

22,30,altstadt,4.1,"Opaque dark brown, almost black color. Head was about 1/3 the height of the beer in the glass. Head was tan, with medium sized bubbles. High flux of small bubbles rising to replenish the head from below. No lacing.  Sweet light caramel malt smell with a tiny bit of funky yeast. Swirling the glass changed the character of the caramel scents a bit and added a tiny barnyard.  Much darker caramel flavor than expected from the scent. Quickly adds in some dark, dried fruit flavor, like figs. Some bitters, which taste more like they came from the malt than any hops. There is a bit of a spicy burn. The aftertaste is mostly dark caramel with a little bitters.  Bursts into a huge foam, with tongue prickling, leaving almost no fluid. Carbonation is a bit overwhelming, but also typical for the style.  The high carbonation means this is not a casual sipper; one must pay attention when drinking this. Faithful representation of the style.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Belgian Dark Strong Ale,94

Transparency drops to null and the beer darkens a little when the final ounces of the bottle are poured into the glass. Head is two fingers of khaki foam and it retains remarkably well. Aroma is dark fruits, berries, grape jam, roasty, toasty, and nutty malts. Little pop of sweetness up front with a slightly more bitter, balanced finish. Flavor profile is grape jelly, dark fruits, berries, clove, a pinch of banana and nutty, toasty malts. It is sweet throughout, but never crosses the threshold into 'dessert' levels. Sweetness is waned away at the finish by the alcohol, which creates a soft and slow burn on the tongue and lips long after a sip. Mouth feel is thick with a frail graininess that breaks down into a soft, fuzzy carpet as the beer sits on the tongue. Overall, thick and lightly sweet with some nutty malts. It drinks something like a fermented peanut butter and jelly with presence.  Served in a 15.5oz Speigalau tulip from a 12oz bottle.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Belgian Dark Strong Ale,94

Could easily last beyond the printed best by date; I think I'll hold one 4-5 years just to see. Love the complex, dark fruity, spicy, yeasty aroma. I'm probably being a little reserved on the score; I admittedly enjoy but am not a frequent partaker in the style.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Belgian Dark Strong Ale,94
22,30,eberesford,4.35,"My favourite from the unibrou lineup. Pours a slightly hazy mid - dark brown with a rich creamy head. Aroma: caramel, spice, dried fruit. Flavour: on the tongue more chocolate - quite rich and full but the hop balance prevents it from being cloying. Really not a summer drink, but actually more quaffable than you’d expect from a belgian dark.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Belgian Dark Strong Ale,94
22,30,VoxRationis,4.76,"Decanted from a 12 oz (355 ml) bottle into a custom taster pint; best by 02/20/22. A: Pours a hazy, brown color with incredibly robust head formation. The glass was basically full of light brown foam. Surprisingly soapy lacing. S: Tangy/tart with aromas of molasses, cherry wood, berries, and orange. T: Tart and semisweet. Flavor follows the nose this the addition of at least clove and cardamom. Bitterness keeps the sweetness and spiciness in line. M: Medium bodied with insane carbonation. O: Wow! Just a delicious, flavor forward, Belgian dark ale. First became aware of and started drinking Unibroue beers in 2009 when I visited Québec. So happy I did.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Belgian Dark Strong Ale,94

I like everything about it. It smells, tastes, and feels great. My only problem was it poured with a thick head, but I don’t consider that a horrible feature. You won’t be disappointed in this beer.  Also, my Mom and Step Dad walked by when I poured this and wanted to try it so I gave them about a ¼ of the bottle. They raved about how good it was without me even saying anything.

Taste follows on with roasted malts, dark fruit, chocolate and spiciness. Extremely rich mouthfeel with perfect carbonation. Overall this is a great example of a strong ale.

Mellow peppery esters followed by dark malt and and dark fruit flavors, raisin, and fig. Medium light, acidic bitterness through the middle followed by sweet banana and dark malt flavors. Expanding booziness near the end. Finished semi-dryly with dark fruit and under-ripe banana notes and a lingering, drying tartness that slowly fades. Just a fantastic brew. Complex flavors and aromas with unpredictable estery character. ",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Belgian Dark Strong Ale,94

Smooth and sparkly to start off with but then it loses much of the sparkle; Rich flavor, tastes like it smells, but not strong, just the slight hint of the 9% ABV alcohol content.

The aroma offers hints of dark fruit and a subtle clovey Belgian yeast note. The taste is more clove, raisin, plum, sweet bread and spice.

22,30,Tomahock,3.2,"Flavor is a little thin for a strong ale. Considerably lighter than the maudite they brew. And carbonation overwhelms flavor to some extent. Carbonated to the point that you end up swallowing a fair amount of gas with each sip as it releases in the mouth (sorry, no other way to say it). By the time you swallow it your cheeks are puffed out like Gillespie at Newport. Finish is actually a bit sour. Meh.

Frothy, yet smooth O - A very solid Belgian dark ale, with an amazing appearance and great taste and mouthfeel, however compared to some more traditional Belgians, and some other non-Belgian brands such as Ommegang, I find that this offering from Unibroue is somewhat lacking in terms of overall flavor intensity as well as complexity.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Belgian Dark Strong Ale,94

22,30,qjholler,4.3,"A) Huge beige head which fades at a moderate rate and a beautiful dark brown body with hints of ruby toward the outer edges of the glass. S) Deep, sweet, and sharp, with fig and spices coming through most prominently. Pleasing and strong without being overpowering. T) Fig features even more than in the nose and is noticeable immediately. The malt blends well with this sweetness to give the beer a delicious first few moments on the tongue. This clean taste of dark fruit and malt gives way to warm spices to temper the strong initial bite before fading into a relatively salient aftertaste of alcohol. These flavors synergize well and combined create a taste that is beautifully reminiscent of autumn, despite the fact that I savored it on a warm spring evening. M) Not too thin, not too thick - it's just right, truth be told. Complements the taste while allowing it to maintain its leading role in the brew. O) A great beer that has more to offer than what I've included in this review, and a solid representative of its style.

Taste is similar with with fig, raisin, spice, some biscuit malt, caramel and yeastiness. Its cleaner/thinner/dryer than many of this style but the flavors pleasant and get better with warmth.

Lovely dark reddish-brown color. Small head that dissipates quickly, not much lacing, but don't let that fool you this is a complex beer with a heavy alcohol. Nose: dark fruit like cherry and grapes, dark chocolate, smokeyness, spice. Taste all the aforementioned plus a salty note and malt.

It had a very unique look with the dark brown, red highlights and thick but quickly dissipating head - enough remained for lacing to be visible. Unique in smell as it did not have that overpowering boozy tang to the nose and for that matter on the mouth. Though I will admit, it started chugging it almost and then it hit and I had to slow down (I think Imma gonna sleepa gooda tonight...)

I think there is just a little tart green apple, and earthiness, there. The flavor is really nice. All of those deep dark dried fruits, but not too sweet, by a long shot. On the finish, I get some pipe tobacco and a leather quality. The feel is full carbonation, which pushes the flavors around the palate, dry overall, and medium-ish body.

22,30,Lone_Freighter,3.85,"Reviewed from notes. This was poured into a chalice. The appearance was a nice ruddy brown color with a one finger white foamy head that died within about a minute. It left a nice stringy foamy lacing. The smell had a good amount of raisins, honey, and plums making it fairly sweet. The taste was basically sweet and allowing a decent amount of Belgian spices come in to start to take over as it warmed a bit. On the palate, it sat about a medium on the body and showing that this is more of a sipper and had a good smooth carbonation about it. Overall, I say this was a pretty good Belgian Strong ale well worthy of having again and quite possibly as a nice dessert by itself at the end of the day.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Belgian Dark Strong Ale,94
22,30,HoppingMadMonk,4.81,"Muddy red brown color with just a bit above average carbonation. Yeast,malt,and dried fruit aroma that comes off as very strong. Taste is identical to aroma with just a tiny but of bite from carbonation,high abv,and perhaps a small amount of hops. The only downfall of this beer is the muddy cloudy appearance which is a trivial problem. So many beers try to produce a complex flavor but this one does it so incredibly well. I always enjoy trying new beer and this is by far the best I've tried in some time",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Belgian Dark Strong Ale,94

Good looking beer, dark brown with off-white head that dissipates leaving nice lacing in the glass. Smell is candy sugar, Belgian yeast, dark fruit, and spices. Taste is mostly candy sugar, grapes, pears, apples, yeast, and spice that is very consistent thru the mouthful. Feel is very consistent, evenly carbonated, and finishes a little sticky with a pleasant fruit aftertaste.  Not sure if this is a quadrupel or a strong ale, Unibroue doesn't say-- but this beer is very complex and tasty. Highly recommended!",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Belgian Dark Strong Ale,94

Aroma is of caramel, dark malts, prunes, hard water/wet dog, and the more it warms I begin to get a faint note of black licorice or molasses.  Its flavor is reminiscent of toasted dark bread, with lots of fruity, estery, yeasty notes and some dark fruits. It's 9.0 is very well concealed.  Soft mouthfeel. It is well carbonated, but it's carbonation has more of a soft, lacy feeling than a bubbly, prickly one. I like it.

22,30,Poljazz22,4.37,"Very dark brown ale. Very bubbly brown head ending as a pale beige rim. Smells like a Belgian triple: spices and coriander. Tastes of dark malt, chocolate, cereal, cherries and dried prunes. Lots of carbonation with some sweetness. Also some sour red berry flavor and a presence of alcohol warmth. Just a great beer! Gets more complex as it warms up. Still thirst quenching at 9% ABV ! Amazing deal here in Quebec at $14 for six plus tax.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Belgian Dark Strong Ale,94
22,30,josanguapo,4,"From Saveur Biere. In Grimbergen glass. Watching Los Soprano 6x04. Lighter and more drinkable than usual in the style. The dark fruits profile is there but lower than i'd like, although improves as it warms up",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Belgian Dark Strong Ale,94
22,30,degueulasse,3.21,"I couldn't distinguish the smell of this from the stale smell of Keystone Light or other such frat party beers, but it seems to transform once it hits the tongue, its sweet caramel flavor coming through nicely. As it warms up, it takes on dark fruity notes as well, reminding me of currants. It's a burgundy brown beer that goes down rather well.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Belgian Dark Strong Ale,94
22,30,akolb,4.57,"Poured from a 335 mL bottle (love the small bottles!) Massive, billowing tan head that takes up most of the glass and forms a lovely mushroom cloud extending above the rim. Be careful when pouring this one! The beer itself is a murky raisin-like color. Aroma has brown sugar, funk, raisins, prunes, sweet rich malt, spice, and a bit of chocolate. The taste is well balanced, with yeasty esters, dark fruit, and a hint of roast. Sweet, filling malty aftertaste. Very prickly carbonation and a slight alcohol burn. This is a wonderful beer, both drinkable and flavorful. Worth buying just for the truly extraordinary head.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Belgian Dark Strong Ale,94
22,30,jmasher85,4.59,"Having gone almost all the way through the Unibroue lineup, I can still say that I don't know how the brewery's name is pronounced, but this is their best beer. As a Belgian-style tripel, this is about as good as it gets, with sweet, gentle malts, ripe stewed prune and raisin flavors, and a heavy whiff of baking spices like allspice, cardamom, clove, and nutmeg throughout. Delicious enough to be accessible to anyone, but complex and deep enough to be appreciated by connoisseurs too. A benchmark of the style.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Belgian Dark Strong Ale,94
22,30,dillybarrrrr,4.21,"Trois Pistoles, by Unibroue. 9% in a 750mL bomber, poured into a pint. Purchased for 6.99 Picked up because it has a reputation for being great beer. While also being dark but not overly chocolatey, or so I've heard. L: THE HEAD! Holy shit this beer has a massive head and it doesn't dissipate very quickly (stayed there until 3/4 done beer). The color is intriguing. Really dark but not opaque. Light does shine through. Not very much lacing. S: I pick up blueberries. The 9% can be faintly noticed. T: Raisins and blueberries. Slight tinge of cocoa. A faint sweetness F: The feel is unique, it almost has a soda-y bubbliness to it because the head never goes away. The sweetness that isn't very apparent in the taste, sticks around the mouth for awhile. OV: Very impressed. For a dark beer this is awesome. Gave some to a non-craft beer drinker and she thoroughly enjoyed. Well done. Will be looking for more from Unibroue.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Belgian Dark Strong Ale,94

The aroma is dark fruits, floral spiciness, chocolate malt sweetness, brown sugar and some nice estery yeast notes.  The tastes are sweet up front with dark fruits, bready malt sweetness, brown sugar and yeasty estery note. Also a nice floral spiciness.  The palate is medium plus with a substantial malt sweetness and alcohol spice lingering well. Nice and creamy finish.  Overall this is an awesome quadruple/ Belgian Strong Dark.

22,30,Holderness,4.23,"Wow this beer has some character! Poured out of a bomber, the head is easily four fingers, and with a stadium pour at that. Seriously, this rivals Duvel for robustness of head. Moderate lacing and fabulous retention. Ale itself is almost as dark as a porter, and has the smell of one, too: lots of sweet malts, chocolate, coffee, and a fruity yeastiness that makes it unmistakably Belgian in style. The taste largely follows the nose, and also highlights the many spices used in the brewing process, as well as some nuttiness. Perhaps a little too chocolatey for my liking, since it obscures that lovely sweet, bready yeastiness that draws me to the Belgian ales in the first place.  85/100",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Belgian Dark Strong Ale,94

Nose of dark raisin bread, brown sugars, light spices of clove and coriander, subtle cherry notes, and light yeast notes. Flavors surpass the nose with dark brown sugars and strong booze touched dark raisin bread with a dash of cocoa and clove with a light coriander dash on the rear mingling with a light herbal hop and a lightly tart cherry note on the finish.

22,30,SHDoyle,3.86,"Description: Dark brown to ruby appearance with a finger of light tan head and lacing which lingers on the glass. The aroma is more spice than anything else with maybe a touch of fruitiness. Flavor is, again, predominantly spice with clove and banana. This is much more ""tripel"" than ""quad"" or other Belgian variety. I do not get the rich, dark fruits that heavier Belgians usually show and I would describe this as somewhat delicate. Feel is a little on the thin side. Like the taste, it's somewhere between a tripel and a quad.  Suggested food pairing: Roasted pork or chicken  If you like this beer then you should also try: Fin du Monde. I know, it's the same brewery, but this is really what it reminded me of in the flavor profile.  Overall: 4 (This been is good and I may or may not have it again) Not bad by any means but nothing outstanding either. I was surprised how much this reminded me of Fin du Monde, given that they're different styles. if you like that style you should give this a shot.

22,30,Gajo74,4.47,"Pours a murky brown and mahogany color with a dense and gloriously tall bubbly and foamy head. It retains well and leaves nice semi sticky lace patterns. In the nose it consists of dark bread, a slight touch of cocoa, dark fruit such as prune, fig and dark grape, slight bubblegum, and finally, a generous helping of spices; cinnamon and clove are prominent. A nice bouquet of complexity. The taste and feel are a heavenly treat. Creamy, velvety and smooth. Medium to full but so fluffy and drinkable at the same time. Great complexity of flavor. Dark fruits, especially musty grape, provide a wine like texture. Their is a subtle coating of cocoa or dark malt creaminess, which is felt in the finish. The spices, particularly clove, are also felt in the finish. Mid palate, the brew becomes increasingly peppery. There is even the tiniest splash of hops that adds the most minimal bitterness possible. Oh yeah...I forgot...this has 9% ABV??!! I could not tell..it is that well masked. This one is delightful. Perhaps my favorite from Unibroue thus far.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Belgian Dark Strong Ale,94

Bread crumbs, pumpernickel bread, and toffee. A subtle spice note becomes more apparent with time.  First impression is of dried fruit and an incredibly rich bread crust/dark bread that drenches the palate. Raisins and white grape add complexity to the delicious malt. The deep richness and clean, almost juicy, fruit element make for quite an elaborate brew. Aftertaste is grape and satiating bread, with a light amount of pepper for sprite. Plum and more spice as the beer warms. Excellent mix of deep and light flavors.  Medium-full body. Creamy in the mouth, but dry on the finish. Perhaps a little sweet. Boozy warming starts in later.

Following that are flavors of chocolate covered raisins, sugarplums, cherries, caramel, fig wine and mild cinnamon.  Feel: Dry and bittersweet. Highly carbonated. Remarkably mellow for belgian strong ale, for better and for worse. I wish the beer had a more robust flavor but in exchange it seems to have traded it's machismo for dangerous levels of sessionability.  Overall: .

22,30,MrDell,4.15,"13.08.2016  Unibroue – Trois Pistoles Belgian Strong Dark Ale- 9% - 330ml Bottle- Bottling date Unknown– Best Before Unknown  Description: Trois Pistole is as dark a strong ale as can be, mellow in taste with an aroma of ripe fruits. It can be compared to an old port and is brewed from well roasted malt.  Appearance: Looks black with a tan head until held up to light, then it reveals a very deep burgundy hue. Tan coloured head with lots of activity above the nucleation site (served in a Duvel tulip glass). Excellent head retention and some nice lace-work.  Aroma: Lots of ripe banana on the nose, sweet malt aromas, lots of toffee and caramel. A very slight acidic note.  Taste: Reminds me very much of Chimay blue upfront but with a little extra dark fruit. It's quite boozy and sweet and there is a lot of banana in this one, also some plum I like it. The middle is like a very alcoholic Christmas pudding and the finish quite boozy with some bitter liquorice notes.  Mouthfeel: The carbonation is quite apparent in the mouth, it's full bodied and finishes dry. 4  Overall: I did enjoy this beer, it's a fairly good representation of one of my favourite styles and something a little ""different"" being French-Canadian, non-abbey etc. Do I like it enough to buy it again? Maybe; if it was on tap somewhere and I fancied it but it's not a beer that I would seek out as there are so many excellent (better) examples of this style that are readily available here in Europe and I cant help but feel that this one is lacking in some way.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Belgian Dark Strong Ale,94
22,30,ChrisCage,4.46,"A- Awesome masculine cork top bottle with great artwork on the label! The brew itself pours a robust dark brown with cola like tinges, and a caramel colored head that starts about two fingers thick....it has excellent retention and settles into a very thick layer over the beer....soapy in fact! Too hard to see the carbonation and as far as lacing goes, well, it does slowly creep back into the liquid, however, it is thick and picturesque! A fine looking Dark Ale!  S- Initial aromas of sweet malts, dark dried fruits, with balancing char, yeast, baking spices that are very much of rum cake, and right on the finish is some Belgian style funk and touches of alcohol.....its rich yet nothing in particular overpowers anything else on my nostrils. Smells heavenly!!  T- Flavors follow in the vein of the aromas with several added flavors throughout! Right away I pick up dark malty fruit, with mild hints of banana flesh....rich yeasty biscuit flavors and brown sugar/molasses type sweetness from the malts used. The finish is clean and with just a mild alcoholic tinge that hits the back of the throat at moments. Throughout, there is some Belgian funk....this very much reminds me of a Double....nice!  M/O- The carbonation is rather robust and scrubs the palate more than I thought it would at first for this style....the body is medium and drinkability factor is high....if I wasn't sharing this 750ml bottle, I would surely finish it myself! The alcohol is hidden generally well and I think this would be a kind dessert for the discerning, but, everyone should give this a go! Cheers!",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Belgian Dark Strong Ale,94

Smell has aromas of dates, prunes, red grapes, and raisins. Substantial undertone of funky belgian yeast comes through. As the smell develops you get some whiffs of a tart green apple.  Taste is initially dark fruits - dates, prunes and raisins, with a nice yeasty funk. As the flavor profile develops though, you get this interesting brown sugar sweetness that isn't overly sweet, but adds some depth. Additionally you start to get a real tartness to the beer that tastes like a granny smith apple. Really interesting and very nice.  Feel is medium carbonation with a decent tingle on the tongue and mouth. Beer is thin, but not watery. Drinkable especially for such a high ABV.  Overall a really nice offering.

Sweet, crunchy, dried dark fruit on the taste initially, accompanied by light notes of leather, chocolate, oak, organic spice, and bready, toasted malt. Quite complex, and very enjoyable.

Light tartness and even lighter funkiness up front, flavors increasing and melding towards fortified/aged/old wine by the finish. Not overly sweet or vinegary. Not very phenolic either. As the back label states, a mild dark, even in spite of grain/grape spirit booziness. A little peppery past the finish, and with retro-olfaction while drinking.

22,30,Pantalones,3.69,"Having this one for the second time. Best-by date on the bottle is May 25th, 2018. Yep, that would be two full years (and a couple months) from now.  Pours with a bit of a ""glug-glug-glug"" sound even though I'm not pouring awfully fast, and pretty soon a HUGE head of light-tan foam has billowed up from the surface of this beer with an audible fizzing sound. Really nice texture to the foam, too. I was only able to get a little over half the bottle into the glass before I had to stop for fear of overflow. The beer itself is incredibly dark, appearing almost black at a glance, though I can see some dark brown around the edges when I hold it up to a light. Seems to be a bit hazy, as my little LED flashlight doesn't penetrate all the way -- instead it lights up the entire glass bright red, with only the dots of the LEDs clearly visible (also red) through it all. Lots and lots of little bubbles rising up at all times. Foam leaves some lacing behind as it shrinks away, and more as I start drinking. Have to say this looks really nice!  Smell is Belgian-yeasty all the way. Seemed a little banana-ish at first, but as the giant head of foam recedes into a thinner layer on top, the banana-ness has faded and it's more just ""yeasty,"" with some sweetness and spice poking through (most recent sniff came across almost cinnamon-y.)  Taste is similar, but if anything it's fainter. Subtler? I dunno. Yeasty, some sweetness, maybe a tad of spice in there too. I am noticing a pretty nice aftertaste (malty, sweet, a bit yeasty) lingering in my mouth after a few sips, but it's a bit puzzling that I'm not tasting as much when the beer is actually still in my mouth. Oh wait, next couple sips I am starting to pick up a noticeable brown-sugar-like thing in the flavor. Burps are yeasty and a bit fruity, I almost want to say plum-like but not quite. Maybe starting to pick up a little hint of the cinnamon-y spice in the flavor at this point. After pouring the remaining beer into the glass I am noticing a bit of a ""tropical-fruit gum"" sort of yeast flavor popping in that wasn't there before -- that's interesting. Wonder if I may have ended up pouring the yeasty stuff from the bottom of the bottle in and this is a yeast-ester flavor that only the bottle-conditioning strain of yeast produced? It's a nice addition, but it does seem to kind of overpower the flavors I was picking up previously. It even takes over the flavors of burps. Fortunately, it seems to blend in with the other flavors a bit better a few minutes past the initial pouring, seeming to add a little ""oomph"" that was lacking previously. On the last few sips of the glass, I almost think I'm picking up a faint, tiny little bit of leafy-hop bitterness at the very end, but it's not enough to be 100% sure that's what it was.  Mouthfeel-wise this is really nice; seems a lot lighter than its color would indicate but still never even remotely close to being thin or watery (there is that little hint of stickiness to it that I really like in bigger beers), and pulls off ""fizzy but not prickly/uncomfortable"" pretty well. There was a whole lot of alcohol warmth in my mouth upon taking my first sip, but that seems to go away pretty quick on later sips.  Overall, I enjoyed this one significantly more than I did the first time I tried it, but I'm still left feeling like I may be missing something. Maybe just one you need to have a few times before you can fully appreciate it? Either way, it has at least left me with a very nice ""warm and fuzzy"" buzz and certainly wasn't unpleasant in any way (appearance and mouthfeel being the high points by a large margin), so I may end up picking up more of it in the future to test out my ""gets better every time you try it"" theory.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Belgian Dark Strong Ale,94

Unfortunately, I usually fail at keeping it long enough for the test.  2/28/17 I succeeded at cellaring until about the Best By Date. And amazingly, my hunch worked: there is less carbonation and I have increase Feel by .25. Less bubbles makes it work better with cheeses... which I am enjoying as I write... so a .25 increase. As this brew softens, it also sweetens...making it ideal for desserts with chocolate.  2/8/18 Confirmed a year later that not only does aging mollify the bubbles, but that they are still strong enough to cut through the grease of pizza. (If I'm having pizza other than dead-of-a-Chicago-winter, Trois Pistoles is not my choice.)  This beer is listed in one of three books comprising my classical beer education, ""1001 Beers To Taste Before You Die."" And it probably deserves to be on the list when it was made in 2012. But nine years later, other BSDAs could replace this... which makes me ask if Unibroue has it lost its edge to younger brewers ? At any rating..... Glad I continue to try Trois Pistoles (3 coins). Its depth continues to reveal itself. Patience was the key with me.  1/17/21 Still cellaring these guys. This copy's Best By date is a year from now. And that could be optimum as I really enjoyed this one. And after reviewing Unibroue's excellent website once again, I found I can pair Pistoles with my world famous ratatouilles. Can't wait. In the meantime, I'm keeping count over at UnTappd. A votre Sante' !",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Belgian Dark Strong Ale,94
22,30,CHickman,4.2,"2013 Bottle: Pours opaque brown color with a 1 finger beige head that was packed with very tiny bubbles that popped as it faded and left minimal spotty lacing and a creamy speckled layer on top.  Smells of dark fruit, toasted grains, black cherries, malt, mild spices like pepper and coriander, Belgian yeast, toffee and a bunch of bready/malty complexities. Simple, yet dynamic and very nice to inhale.  Tastes like it smells with dark fruit up front that brings dates, red grapes, black cherries, raisins and soft brown pear, followed by sweet malt, toasted grains, brown sugar, mild spices like pepper and coriander, Belgian yeast, red wine/merlot and a light boozy aspect. The sweetness is mild and the spices interact with the malts to produce a lot of complex flavors while suppressing the ABV. A Belgian via Canada with nice balance, incorporating the yeast and earthy notes for an interesting variety of flavors.  Mouthfeel is creamy and smooth, with mild carbonation, a medium to almost chewy body and a slightly tart and bitter aftertaste that releases some minor alcohol burn, but keeps this malty and on the good side of sweet. It's been a while since I drank this beer and it was very good once again.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Belgian Dark Strong Ale,94

Pours a dark hazy ruby brown with three fingers of finely foamy beige head that leaves stormy cloud top lace as it recedes.  Smells of raisins dusted with brown sugar, cocoa powder, candied dark fruit and spiced stewed mandarin oranges.  Tastes of caramel drizzled raisin tarts, more sugary dark orchard fruit, sweet red wine, faint cocoa powder and ominous warming alcohol.  Feels sturdy and frothy. Full bodied with lively, creamy carbonation. Finishes pleasantly sweet.  Verdict: Vigorously recommended. Easily one of Canada's best.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Belgian Dark Strong Ale,94

22,30,cjgiant,3.97,"Bottle best by 3/2018 (revisit 2/27): Pours a nice brown that becomes dark brown almost towards black in the glass, with a sort of burgundy hue to it. The white-tan head has structured bubbles low, and a nice foamy look on top. Sheets of lacing on each sip does cling here and there to the glass.  Nose is not overpowering. There are the classic notes of date and raisin, but combined with a red wine-like fruitiness. There a generic note of tartness in the background as well. In some sips I get a little cocoa - which is strangely at odds with the other notes. Revisit: dulled notes as I got before (except the cocoa, not getting that this time), but also a root beer thing going on this taste.  The taste opens light with a bit of Belgian yeast and a hint of banana bread. Light cola notes (accented by a medium high level of carbonation) follow. The date-like notes come in last, combining with the opening notes to again remind me of a breakfast/dessert bread. The alcohol makes a brief appearance near the end before the lingering taste takes over.  A solid beer that didn't have the depth of flavor I expected. This beer is actually sort of light, which makes it easy drinking despite a slight hint of alcohol heat. Revisit: seemed a bit lighter than even I expressed before. Only adjusted nose down a notch on this revisit.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Belgian Dark Strong Ale,94

22,30,kevanb,3.84,"12oz bottle, best before 8.19.18, poured into a Half Acre holiday snifter.  The beer pours a beautiful dark burgundy color, opaque and thick, with a bone colored head, billowing up to two fingers that has great retention and yields plenty of lace. The aroma is very nice, loads of stone fruit, rig, plum, raisin, cherry, brown sugar, huge amount of brown bread grain character, banana and clove yeast, perhaps a bit too sweet for me, but otherwise very traditional and to style. The flavors offer quite a lot of complexity, banana, prune fruit, brown sugar, toffee, rich grain, yeasty clove, fusel alcohol, a bit of pie spice as well, very deep, rich and complex, though I find the alcohol to be a bit overpowering as it warms and a bit on the sweet side. The mouthfeel is great, coating, rich, full bodied, lively, gentle with a delicate finish, lightly warming.  Verdict: A very nice Belgian Strong Dark Ale from Unibroue, certainly a classic beer by all accounts and while it's not QUITE what it's Belgian counterparts are, it's a well built beer that will satisfy nearly anyone who loves a good Belgian beer. I do find this one a bit sweet and the alcohol is a bit distracting, but when it's all said and done, a fine ale.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Belgian Dark Strong Ale,94

The beer itself is dark brown , a little on the murky side yet still translucent.  Smells of bonana, cloves, firm enter rich black earth, prunes, oak, leather. Quite the bouquet.  Taste is not quite as complex as the nose to me. A tangy oakiness with a touch of mild chocolate kicks off the taste. An earthy, musty leathery offers a strong midsection along with a strong caramel sweetness. An herbal tingly carbonated finish is the best part here, which nicely balanced the rich sweetness. I even detect a hint of heat on the back of the tongue along with the spicy peppery finish.  Mouthfeel is good. Nice and balanced and complex. The spiciness at the end quenches a lot of the sweetness, but caramel sweetness lingers a long time on the palate.  Overall, this is a great brew.

S -- Lots of fruitiness, plum and cherry and some associated tartness. The carbonation is strong enough that it seems to give off its own scent as well, but only briefly after pouring.  T -- Fruit and spice at the forefront with a strong malt base that comes off....roasted? I don't think that quite captures it though. The malt seems bready almost, but not quite. The malts keep hinting at something my novice palate can't place. Warmth provides a slight chocolate note, but weakly. The fruit and spice dominate throughout. I should make sure to say, the fruitiness is not like eating fresh fruit, but fruit in the context of beer flavors.  F -- Crip, very dry, medium body, and just a little tart.  O -- Very delicious.

[don’t answer that!]. So yeah, Trois Pistoles is the beer Dennis (I guy I know who sells beer and got me on to Rodenbach Grand Cru) says is THE BEST beer that Unibrow make. So yeah, go the unibrow... or shave off the bit in the middle... either way I’m looking forward to this epic brew.  Poured from a 355ml bottle into a Duvel tulip.  A: Dark chestnut brown hazy body with a dense packed 1 cm khaki head that reduces to a light lace cover on top... looks can be deceiving but this looks like one mighty tasty drop! I am, as you will see from my previous ratings, though more partial to dark beers. 10/10.  S: Botrytis (or ‘Noble rot’) grape big on the nose with lingering background notes of plum, dark cherry, macerated figs, a hit of brown sugar and sourdough yeast in the finish. The aroma is fragrant and moreish, however it is fully slanted towards sweet with little in the way of a balance noted here. 9/10.  T: Tasty and dry are the first things you notice, sweet as well but more restrained than expected, if I was going to describe a beer with colours this would be an aquamarine/purple mix with a touch of gold thrown in - it is one tasty drop. How would I compare it to Chimay Bleu? (it’s primary style combatant in the war for my affections) read on to find out as I’m describing the flavour here mister. Botrytis (though in lesser form), plum, fig, dark cherry, brown sugar, black pepper and sourdough yeast are balanced throughout with a finish that is fairly dry with sweetness that cuts the bitterness until the aftertaste - which is an ever so slight medicinal herb note. Damn. 9/10.  M: Medium bodied with a dense and light carbonation. Mouthfeel is spot on! 10/10.  D: Could I drink this all day? Yes. Is it as good as Chimay Bleu? It’s right up there with Chimay Bleu, in fact I think it’s a dead heat between the two, which is a surprise even for me: I never imagined that some upstart Quebec brewer would be able to compete on the same playing field as Chimay, and I think the texture of this brew is better than Bleu. Negative? The price - I can almost buy 2 Chimay Bleu 330ml bottles for the price of one of these, crazy! 9/10.

The flavour is sweet, finishing smooth like a port wine would. There is an abundant presence of cocoa, roasted malts, dark fruits- namely cherries, plums, prunes, figs, all bolstered by the dark spice notes. Fruity esters blend in nicely with caramel, muscovado sugar, and blackstrap molasses. The boozy, rum quality is warming and pleasurable, not astringent.  Powerful and well made BSDA.

A deep brown in hue with little head or lacing. The aroma is all fruity. Prunes, raisins & cherries, but those elements are well/under controll in the taste, but surely add to the wonderful texture.

Dry, spicy grain flavors especially on the finish punctuated by a dose of tartness. F: Very creamy Belgian bottle conditioned carbonation gives the beer a very soft texture. A big beer but surprisingly light on its feet – not heavy or cloying. O: A well composed and well balanced yeast driven Belgian style dark ale with big flavors.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Belgian Dark Strong Ale,94
22,30,Sirwootalot,4.55,"Served room-temperature, in a standard pint glass.  The nose from this brew hits right away - a swirling potion of estery goodness, evoking banana bread, dried berries, and even a hint of wild mushrooms. The head is ferociously chunky, and with even the most dainty of pours kept surging its way up.  The taste is an experience. It's initially thick, fruity, and slightly bitter, much like a raspberry cacao truffle - and then the aftertaste kicks in, almost defying description. It's an effervescent explosion of strange and delightful flavors; I was reminded of cinnamon, white pepper, galangal root, espresso foam, walnuts, blackberry syrup, and smoked brisket. This beer dominates every last cell in your mouth, but isn't even remotely astringent or sticky. It goes down disturbingly easy for how strong it is, in every sense of the word.  This is not the best beer I've ever had, but it's WAY up there. I imagine it would pair stupidly well with authentic barbecue, or with maple-syrup-heavy breakfast.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Belgian Dark Strong Ale,94

22,30,Bunman3,4.18,"Oh my. Dark, sweet, and yeasty...reminiscent of dark lovers and dangerous affairs. Even better, it shares a name with one of my favourite Tragically Hip songs.

22,30,E-McFarden,4.23,"Dark brown with creamy white head, looks to pour heavy. I get dried dark fruit and nutty scents with earthy aroma hops and alcohol. Getting my nose a little closer to the glass lends a scent comparable to Dr Pepper. The profile of scents is so complex and balanced that I could sit there and just smell this one for quite some time, however, I love drinking beer too much to do that. The taste brings forth more complex spices as well as that Belgian yeast profile. I still get some of the nutty dried fruit undertones on the palate. This one finishes wet and heavy on the palate, leaving me with the alcohol that matches up with the actual content. Good brew here",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Belgian Dark Strong Ale,94
22,30,milwaukee512,4.88,"It's a rare beer that makes this hop-lover enjoy a malty, dark Belgian like Trois Pistoles. As is typical for Unibroue, the mouthfeel and carbonation make this beer uniquely drinkable for the style. Drinks like a lighter, more manageable Gulden Draak, which is high praise. I would have never guessed that this beer is 9% ABV, but that's not to say it isn't substantial in flavor and feel. Everything this brewery makes is about as high-quality as you will find, and makes paying twice as much for true Belgian imports seem silly.

22,30,BradtheGreat7,4.28,"Review taken multiple times. This particular review was taken early summer 2014.  12oz brown bottle with the beautiful Unibroue shape, perfect silver foil covering the cap and neck. More great artwork from Unibroue with a winged horse over their famed castle like artwork. Poured into an authentic Unibroue stemmed tulip.  A - murky dark brown with hints of the darkest of amber in the light. Opaque character out of the light with a massive dark beige head that leaves sticky lace all over the glass.  S - dark fruits and sweet malt. Hints of chocolate, and bready yeast. Brown rum and Belgian style spices. A delicious and inviting aroma. A touch of roasted malt adds to the complex aroma.  T - sweet malts and rich ripened dark fruits. The brown rum character doesn't fade in the flavor. Dark Belgian spices with hints of dark cherry, chewy caramel, chocolate and cocoa. More light roasted malt notes contribute to the balance of the big dark fruit sweetness. A tasty flavor!  M - big medium body with an even bigger thickness and texture. This thing drinks like a dessert which is typically what I drink it as. Exceptional coating quality. Alcohol booze is there once it warms but only adds to its spices.  O - A sweeter strong dark ale but an exceptional offering. Another true craft beer classic from this great Canadian brewery. One of the breweries who just know belgian style beer and craft them with such quality it's truly remarkable. Trois Pistoles is one of my all time favorites and I'd advise anyone to get it a try.

22,30,BeerWatcher,3.83,"Pours murky, muddy brown. Raisins, and plum dominate the aromas. Palate is thick and slightly sticky. Tastes are the aforementioned raisins and plums, but some up front mint is on the tongue too. Maybe a bit of sweet molasses on the swallow. A good solid craft brew, but the hyperbole swirling around this one, exceeded the actual experience of drinking it.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Belgian Dark Strong Ale,94
22,30,dmgeng,4.57,"This beer has been recommended to me several times and finally tried it.  A - Deep brown color that is ruby in the light. Medium white head with fine bubbles that subsides quickly. Not as cloudy as most but still some yeast in suspension.  S - Pretty rich smell with lots of the typical Belgian yeast spice character (phenolic) and a very pleasant dark fruit character like raisin or prune. Just underneath that are the strong malt and caramel tones.  T - Very similar to the smell the Belgian character holds true but isn't the only player with lots of malty goodness sitting on a bed of the caramelized sugars. Has a lot of sweetness from the dark fruit and malt but the spice character helps and It's a complex beer that gets even more complex the more your tongue gets used to the Belgian flavors and it warms pulling you more in to the depths of this Belgian strong ale.  M - Full to medium mouth-feel. Has some light bitterness and finishes complex with an aftertaste that isn't exactly the same as the flavor but doesn't stick. Light carbonation.  Overall, a very delicious beer. Not the best beer I've had but the amplitude of the dark fruit character in compliment to the Belgian character is very flavorful. I would recommend this beer to anyone that likes Belgian beers or if you enjoy the dark fruit character of other beers.  Glass- Goblet",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Belgian Dark Strong Ale,94
22,30,Redneckwine,4.49,"12oz bottle into tulip  Appearance - That typical, fantastic BSDA look - murky dark brown with a huge, fluffy 2 finger tan head. Lacing is awesome, epic retension.  Smell - Spicy, musty dark fruits, a little funky, very ripe banana - that yeast is kickin' in a great way. Light grassy/herbal hops. Doughy sweet maltiness is hanging out too. Caramely and candy-like. Great smell, very complex.  Taste - Big-time flavor bomb: rum-raisin, loads of ripe dark fruitiness, subtle grassy/herbal hops, touch of cocoa, musty and pungent, spicy with clove and others, malty and bready, caramel sweetness, vanilla. Alcohol is very well integrated, but there is a boozy twang complete with a bit of burn in the back of the throat, just let you know this is 9%. Finish dries up quite nicely. Very complex and everything works together beautifully.  Feel - Creamy carbonation, smooth, fairly high carb complements the medium-full body nicely.  Overall - Just a really expertly put together BSDA. Very complex, very smooth and dangerously drinkable for its heft like any big Belgian worth its salt should be.

22,30,MisterGone,4.24,"This is listed as a Belgian Strong Dark Ale. However, it is a deceptively smooth one. (From a 12 into tulip... twice) this pours a deep copper brown with a quick ascending khaki head. The head then dissipates to hold a finger or so of head for quite a while.  The aroma is not unlike many (North) American Dubbels. Spice, dried fruits - especially raisin, and ripe plum. The flavor is that same palate, distributed. Spice and raisin up front, dried fruit across, and a finish with the ripe plum. The bottle mentions a port or sherry flavor on the finish and I wouldn't argue that.  So here's why i say deceptive. There is no real alcohol blast at the finish. This does not bring the Belgi-funk hard even though it is bottle conditioned. It may just be an ideal intro to the genre of Belgian Strong Dark - but beware. This smooth, drinkable brew sits at 9ABV, so perhaps have some poutine before hand.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Belgian Dark Strong Ale,94

Dissipated pretty quickly.  Smell: some dark fruits, tons of yeast, little bit of a cola smell. Mildly sweet.  Taste: It almost identical to the smell. Dark fruits with a lot of yeast. A touch of cola at the finsh.  Mouthfeel: medium body. Too carbonated in my opinion. Also somewhat acidic in the mouth.  Overall: Belgian beers have never been my favorite - probably because of the yeast and dark fruits. This is pretty much what this beer takes after.

This is a ""dark ale on lees"" (meaning the leftover sediment and dead yeast - don't let that turn you off) with spices. Smell is heavy with dark fruits, like prunes and raisins, and some pepper. Nearly pitch black color with nice head. Taste is smooth and heavily malty with the same dark fruits but minimal pepper. No hops detected here even though I know they're there.

Not as sour as the Dutches, more along the lines of the subtle sourness of Monk's Cafe. A very pleasant mild sourness that adds a nice complexity to finish and hides the abv well.  M: Medium body, high carbonation.  O: Outstanding Belgian dark ale. More session able (even at 9%) abv than most Belgian strong dark ales.

I'm surprised that the initial head seems more bubbly than I expect, but it fades quickly to a light cap of foam. Clean on the glass with no lace. Aroma is lacking. I get a hint of what I would expect from a BSDA, but little more. And the taste. If I were to do this blind I seriously doubt I could distinguish this from any of my favorite Belgian ales in this category. Perfect balance. Bready with dark fruit mixed in. Nice.

While this is very similar to the latter, it has a not terribly pleasant metallic note, as if it had been brewed with the silver foil on the cap. I thought it might be just the one beer from the four pack, but the second is the same. Not worth commenting on other (and admittedly, quite worthy) aspects of this brew. Maybe I bought a bad four pack, but still . . . .  UPDATE - Had this on tap at the Canadian popcorn stand (!) at Epcot in Disney World. I obviously had a queer four pack. This is a delectable BSDA, one not to be missed. And worth a trip to Epcot to drink a couple on tap.  FURTHER UPDATE - Another four pack yielded nothing but pure bliss. BSDA are probably my favorite style, and this is probably my favorite of that style. I had to bump my ratings up another .25.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Belgian Dark Strong Ale,94

It is just fantastic to go back to a beer like this after always trying to pursue the latest limited release. The yeast is fantastically complex, with both fruit, bread and cloves all coming to the forefront. Excellent beer.

22,30,taxandbeerguy,4.06,"341 ml bottle served cold into a pint glass. Purchased as part of the Unibroue taster's pack. Looking forward to this one. Awesome artwork on the label as with many of their other brews.  Appearance - Dark cola brown in color topped by a ridiculous multi finger head. Great retention and spidery lacing up and down the glass. Slightly hazy and sufficiently opaque to not be able to see the carbonation in the glass except for the edges.  Smell - Mmmm... plenty of cherry and caramel with just a pinch of dark chocolate through in. Plenty of the glorious Belgian yeastiness. Reminds me a lot of Chimay Blue on the nose, but also has some differences that can allow one to identify this as a Unibroue beer.  Taste - Delicious cherries, dipped in caramel then dipped in chocolate. Alcohol is nowhere to be found. Sweetness is present, but not overwhelming. The taste is delicious, but doesn't linger as long in the mouth as some other sin the style.  Mouthfeel - Carbonation felt surprisingly flat. It's ever so smooth, but can help thinking it could use some carbonation to liven it up. Some heat in the back of the mouth after a few sips, letting you know the potency of this beer. Realistically, a bit thinner than I thought it would be.  Overall - Still a world class beer, rich and full of flavor, however I had been expecting this to challenge La Fin Du Monde as my favorite Unibroue beer ever. Unfortunately, it can't quite live up to those expectations, however still something enjoyable that is perfect for a cold Sunday in November.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Belgian Dark Strong Ale,94

Of of the World class beer review So the look of it, well on the light it looks brown but out of it its look like dark as the night outside. The smell is gorgeous, dark fruit, raisin is first then you have that chocolate coming over. You have that 1 finger of head. Very exciting to try it. Now the taste is on the top of the competition. What u smell is there on the taste. The raisin, the dark fruit and that chocolate on the after taste is there. That 9% ABV, you won t feel it, it taste like a 6 % ABV, It goes down so easily. Very very impressive. The only complain that I have is the head doesn t stay on the glass. You don t have that presence after you drink it. So overall would I recommend it ? You know the answer.... Its a big yes. Hands down to that beer. Go grab one as soon as you can !",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Belgian Dark Strong Ale,94
22,30,fourstringer,3.98,"Poured from a corked and caged 750 mL bottle into a Brewer's Art goblet. Moderate hand. Best before 01/18/16.  A: Dark, ruby-red/brown body with 1 finger of mostly white head. Ok retention. Light lacing.  S: Dark fruit with notes of black cherry, raisin, date. Light roasted malt notes with elements of chocolate. Candi sugar. Molasses.  T: Spicy Belgian yeast starts things off. Dried fruit features prominently. Round dark malt with touches of oak, wood. Enough bittering hop gradually builds to finish semi-dry. Lingering dark chocolate bitterness and raisin in the aftertaste. Alcohol is well hidden for 9% ABV.  M: Moderate to high carbonation for the style with a medium body. A touch more effervescence than anticipated.  O: Drinks well. Typical Unibroue quality. Love their yeast strains. This one would have benefitted from a bit of time in the cellar to mellow the carbonation and bring out the full complexity lurking in there.  Prost!",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Belgian Dark Strong Ale,94

22,30,TimZebGir,4.3,A:Pours a dark brown with very thick foaming head that slowly dissipates(3/3) S: Strong apple and black pepper smell with a tinge of alcohol (10/12) T: Pretty solidly sweet malt taste with the same apple a little raisin and a little caramel or toffee (17/20) M: Very bubbly and wet with a surprisingly light body given the alcohol content (5/5) O: A good beer but I prefer the wheaty Fin du Monde. What this beer does well it does very well. Nothing overpowering just a solid strong ale. (8/10) 43/50,Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Belgian Dark Strong Ale,94
22,30,untitledeuphoria,4.51,"Best before 12.12.14. Drank 10.18.14. Poured from a cork and caged bomber into a 12oz Tulip after having warmed up for 15min or so.  A: Pours a dark rose brown, murky, like muddy lake water. One finger of tan head which crackles and fizzles away immediately. I can't say it is the most visually appealing beer in the world, but it has a certain amount of intrigue to it.  S: Oh baby, there it is, there is that Unibroue mastery. Dark fruits up front...raisin, plum, ripe pear, and cherry. If it stopped there that would be satisfying enough, but there is a walloping load of rum and dark chocolate lurking with a smattering of mellow winter spices and sweet malt. The aroma is out of this world, painstakingly complex, but in no way overwhelming.  T: Sweet, almost wine like in its layering and finish. Dark fruit once again, predominately raisin, plum, and fig. Malty, yeasty, with hearty winter spicing. So many strong flavors that the alcohol is nowhere worth giving a damn.  M: Dry and highly carbonated. Similar to a red wine that bounces along the tongue. Chewy, with a smooth, spiced finish. Lingering alcohol warmth, like wrapping up in one of grandma's quilts on a cold fall morning.  O: This beer is a spectacle. It has everything you could want out of the style, and then just shows off for good measure. Quite possibly the pinnacle of Unibroue.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Belgian Dark Strong Ale,94

Smell - sweet dark fruit, citrus fruit and spices; great aroma from both the bottle and the glass! Taste - very flavorful and easy to drink for a darker ale! Sweet, ripe, dark fruit; paired with yeast and spices. Feel - surprisingly light feel, nicely carbonated, 9% ABV is incredibly well hidden!

22,30,TheItalianStallion,4.33,"Poured from a 12oz. bottle into a Duvel tulip.  A: Pours an opaque brownish black with a 1 finger off white head. The head eventually dissipates to a thin collar and sticks around for the remainder of the beer. Not much lacing, only a few spots.  S: Smell is of raisins, grapes, figs and cherries. Predominately dark fruits with some yeasty esters. Alcohol is faintly present on the nose.  T: The taste is mainly of alcohol soaked dark fruits and yeasty esters. Some tastes of caramel and a bit of a cherry flavor also enter the mix as the beer warms, along with a varying mix of malt flavors. This beer is very complex with fruit, malt, and caramel flavors along with the typical spicy/yeastiness that exists with most Belgian styles.  M: This beer is very chewy on the palate with a nice dry/smooth finish. The finish has a bit of a lingering yeastiness to it. Alcohol is masked very well and hardly detectable even as the beer warms.  O: This is a very full bodied and complex beer. It has many different flavors from fruitiness to maltiness along with the typical spice and yeast notes that most Belgian styles usually possess. Alcohol is slightly detectable on the nose, but is masked very well when it comes to the taste and mouthfeel. An excellent representation of the style that I will surely be having again.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Belgian Dark Strong Ale,94

22,30,UrbanCaveman,4.73,"12 oz bottle, poured into a snifter at room temperature.  A: Pours a deep, dark, rich red-brown, rather like a well-buffed, well-aged cherry wood desk, while forming an impressively thick head of just barely off-white foam. Holding the beer to daylight reveals faint ruddy highlights in an otherwise cloudy brown delicious-looking mass. Even after minutes of dissipation, the head remains as a half-finger cap atop the brew.  S: Diabolically sweet, as one might expect from reading the side of the pack. Dark fruits swirl about a dance floor in the arms of candi sugar and that Unibroue yeast, to the background tune of sweet caramel malt. Plums, grapes, raisins, and cherries intermingle with one another, and there's no shortage of dark bready hints as well, from pumpernickel to rye.  T: Oh, a heady, heady brew this is for a malthead with a yen for yeast! The nose promised all and lied about none of it. The flavor profile explodes from the moment it passes the lips through the finish, all the various notes in harmony. The dark fruits swirl about a palate of sweet dark breads and candi sugars, with no one or even group of flavors taking center stage. The flavors remain balanced and strong through the finish, lingering sweet and sticky on the tongue.  M: Creamy and sticky, with a medium carbonation that fills it out nicely.  O: Unibroue knows its Belgian ales, that is indisputable. This is one of the finer offerings along those lines I've had, and I come back to it time and again. Should I ever get to Belgium itself to sample ales from the source, my opinion may change, but until then - bravo, Quebecois!",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Belgian Dark Strong Ale,94

Head quickly fades to a ring, a little swirl of the glass excites the brew causing some nice lacing. N: Aroma is of bread malts, plum, red grape and pears. P: The aroma accentuates the taste giving you a mildly carbonated dark fruit and malty smooth mouthful. Followed by a slight and pleasant alcohol after taste. O: I really enjoyed this brew. The flavors coming through make this almost like a dessert brew. It's not too filling so it's easy to drink.

22,30,generallee,4.5,"Presentation: It was poured from a brown 750 ml bottle into a tulip glass. The label lists the abv at 9% and there a brief description on the back label.  Appearance: The body has a dark brownish color with some lighter brownish amber highlights. It looks like it has a slight haze and it has lots of fine carbonation running up the sides of the glass. From the pour I got an inch of light tan foam. This foam fades slowly to ring of foam at the edge of the glass. A quick swirl excites the foam. Lacing is minimal.  Smell: It’s aroma is very inviting and full of deep fruity and yeasty notes. I gets notes of red grapes, raisins, plums and over ripe pears. These notes are surrounded by a pleasant sweet bready maltiness with just the very slightest hint of the 9% abv.  Taste / Palate: Like the aroma it’s flavor follows in its footsteps. The has a good full body with loads of malty, yeasty and dark fruitiness. I also get nice mild notes of vanilla extract along with some alcohol which adds another nice layer of complexity.

A medium tan head appears which subsides after a couple of minutes to a thin veil, sparse lacing.  Smell is pungent dark fruits up front - plums, cherries and raisins, mainly. The alcohol is also apparent, with some chocolate and a bit of an herbal quality.  Taste is exactly what you expect from the aroma. Lots of sweet, dark fruits up front, with a touch of chocolate and alcohol spiciness. Under that initial blast, you can taste some hops, which help to balance the sweetness of the beer and it does a good job. Reminded of dark chocolate on top of tart, dark cherries. This ends up being dry on the finish, despite the sweet smell and initial flavors. Very easy drinking for a strong dark. Mouthfeel is smooth and bubbly.

22,30,qwiksilvertrav,3.48,The main thing that ticks me off about this beer is if it gets shaken in the very slightest way in a bottle it'll foam like a volcano when you open it...wasting most of the beer. It foams like crazy too! A slight shaking in any manner will make it seem like you opened a bottle of beer you JUST vigorously shaked like crazy!

22,30,BuckyBeerBeaver,4.41,"Bucky bought a 6 pack of Unibroue's Trois Pistoles at The Beer Store for $14.95... about $2.50 per 341 ml bottle. Trois Pistoles was 9.0% alcohol by volume, with a production date of September 11, 2011 printed on the neck. This particular bottle has been sitting in my cold seller for about 14 months. A warning for those of you who have aged your Trois Pistoles for a while...about two seconds after you open the bottle a whole lot of foam will come gushing out of the bottle, so be ready with the glass. Trois Pistoles poured a dark mahogany colour, with about 2"" of fizzy beige head that faded to a thin cap and collar within 3-4 minutes, leaving a little spotting down the glass. Its aroma was fabulous...plums, powdered sugar, pink bubble gum and red wine. The beer's taste began with sweet ripe plums and raisins, which gave way to powdered sugar and pink bubble gum, ending with a red wine flavour which lingered for a few seconds as an aftertaste. There's very little bitterness here, but beer's sweetness is kept under control. The 9.0% alcohol is very well hidden, both in the aroma and the flavour. The mouth feel is smooth with the carbonation being much softer than previous Unibroue beer's that I've sampled...possibly as a function of being cellared? I'll have to try a fresh bottle some time for the answer to that question. Trois Pistoles is a medium bodied brew. The verdict...yet another winner from the good folks at Unibroue, and the price is not unreasonable. Looking forward to trying the remaining bottles after they have aged even more!",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Belgian Dark Strong Ale,94

22,30,JerseyHopHead,3.98,"Pours a burgundy brown with good head retention. The nose is dominated largely by notes of grape juice. Taste is sweet initially. It comes on subtle before sour grape flavors take over. There are notes of yeasty malt layered throughout that come through a bit more on the finish.  Another beer that drinks more like a wine. Belgian influence is clear. Though not my typical style, I enjoyed this beer.

The dark fruit is prominent in the taste as well. Finishes with dark chocolate and caramel. Has a cola taste when cold. As it warms the fruit mellows and vanilla becomes noticeable. Fizzy with a lingering carbonation. Appropriately dense to hold up to the intense flavors. A bit of alcohol burn as it goes down, even though it's not really noticeable in the taste.

The smell begins with Autumn-like spices up front followed by plum and dark cherry with a hint of toffee on the finish.  The taste is of dark fruit (plum, cherry and raisin) followed by molasses and dark malt with a hint of clove on the back end.  The texture is medium bodied with medium carbonation.

22,30,delta490,4.54,"Poured into a Chimay goblet, it came out a deep slightly cloudy ruddy brown. A small amount of light gets through towards the bottom. A nice thick off-white head settles in at about half a finger and lasts well throughout the beer. The aroma is rich with spices, alcohol esters, and dark fruit sweetness. The taste is a little less explosive, but mirrors the aroma closely, spice and fruit in the forefront and a little bit of alcohol in the background. It wasn't as heavy as I expected given its big aroma and taste, but it certainly isn't lacking. This is a delicious Belgian-style dark ale.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Belgian Dark Strong Ale,94

22,30,glass_house,4.42,"12 oz. bottle poured into a footed goblet  Pours a deep dark rosewood with a slightly translucent glow. When held to the light I can barely see my hand on the other side of the glass. One finger of soft cream-colored foam retains a consistent cap and light lacing. Aroma includes a lot of ripe fruit and roasted dark malt. Banana, dates, figs and tart grapes stand out. Unibroue's signature yeast makes its presence known as well.  The flavors deliver what the nose advertised. Soft dark fruit and a faint sournness of fermented grapes ride a smooth malt backbone to a crisp dry finish. Only a very mild earthy hop accent. Body is medium with a slick clean feel. Perhaps a bit on the fizzy side but the carbonation gives it a unique texture.  Probably my favorite dark Unibroue offering. Has some wine-like qualities and I love how it flirts with malty sweetness without getting syrupy or cloying. The smoothness is a little dangerous at 9%, but makes it a perfect after dinner beer or nightcap sipper.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Belgian Dark Strong Ale,94
22,30,ThisWangsChung,3.84,"750ml bottle into a tulip. From notes.  A: Pours a dark ruby color with some impressive carbonation. The head is two fingers high, and off-white in shade. Texture wise, it looks extremely fizzy (like soda) and has very poor retention. No lacing is left behind.  S: Wow, this is really spicy. While the yeast dominates, the subtle notes of chocolate and brown sugar help give it some depth. The more it warms up, the more I notice its impressive dark fruit notes, and the more I like it. Nitpick: the yeastiness could be toned down slightly.  T: It starts off very fruity - mostly dark fruits, but there are hints of cherries as well. Bready, spicy yeast builds up slightly in the middle before a caramel and chocolate finish. While a bit simple, it's also very pleasant and easy to enjoy. Actually, I shouldn't call it simple: pour in the dregs, and this becomes a richer, more complex offering, varying some of the malt and ester notes beyond caramel and dark fruits, respectively.  M: Holy frig, this is drinkable and light. Not only that, it's surprisingly clean, without a hint of the 9% coming through. The dry finish and healthy carbonation means one could be inclined to chug this - but why would you want to? With the dregs, the body becomes fuller, the cleanliness goes away, and the finish becomes a little sweeter.  O: A lot of people seem to dislike Unibroue's yeast profile - I'm not one of them. As always from Unibroue, the alcohol is concealed marvelously, without sacrificing anything in the way of richness or depth. Thank cripes this is very readily available, because I'll definitely drink this again.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Belgian Dark Strong Ale,94
22,30,Dsimenson,4.48,"Poured from a bottle into a plastic running water bottle--just fished a 5-mile training run and no glassware in sight. Develops a 2cm tan head, then thick clinging lacing. Te aroma is incredible--plums, figs, malt, a bit of hops. The flavor is very rich with dark roasted malt, fruit, and hops. The mouthfeel is the only part that I an not extatic about--it's a bit too foamy for me. Overall a truly outstanding ale that I am very glad to have sampled.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Belgian Dark Strong Ale,94
22,30,LambicPentameter,3.48,"Enjoyed out of a 11.5 oz brown bottle with silver foil covering the neck and cap and an obscure looking code right where the curve of the neck begins. A little internet sleuthing tells me that this code means mine was bottled March 8th, 2012, so about one year old. Poured into a Boulevard Smokestack Series chalice.  Appearance - Pours a deep, dark tree bark brown with just a hint of chestnut color around the very edges. Head is a half finger of ecru colored foam made of tight-knit microbubbles. Retention is excellent, maintaining that level of head for quite awhile before eventually subsiding as sparse film across the surface. Lace is watery and almost nonexistent.  Smell - The initial aroma isn't terribly good, with notes of generic dark fruit and some nondescript spices, like nutmeg that is too old to retain it's aromatic depth. There is a slight hint of fennel, but also a somewhat off-putting smell that reminds me of smoked meat or soy. That part does not seem like it's supposed to be part of the bottle, and although faint, it's discord is amplified by the fact that the other rich elements that you expect from the style are not strongly present.  Taste - After some warmth, the taste is considerably better than the smell, but not good enough to overcome that initial impression. Notes of dates, dried fig, and even a slight hint of raisin, along with the same faded spice notes that I picked up from the smell. On the positive side, the underlying hint of soy has gone by the wayside, and I'm not really sure how that would happen.  Mouthfeel - Medium-bodied and low-to-moderate carbonation. Slightly slick overall feel that makes me wish there was more carbonation to cut through.  Overall, this one just doesn't stack up to other BSDAs that I've had the chance to sample--not even Unibroue's other offering in the style, Maudite. Admittedly, they are very different takes on a somewhat broadly interpretable style, but I would choose that one over this one any day of the week. Luckily, they do enough other outstanding beers that this one doesn't bother me--you can't be perfect all of the time.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Belgian Dark Strong Ale,94
22,30,Copernicandream,3.78,"Poured from a 12oz bottle into a tulip. The bottle immediately began foaming upon uncapping, fizzing like a cola. Bad bottle?  A: Dark black with some deep red amber highlights to light. No head to speak of, it was like pouring a coca-a-cola, fizzy but no foam or head to speak of.  S: Dark fruit esters, figs, raisins. Dark malt. Clove. Subtle acetic acid.  T: Malt profile that seems way to sweet, otherwise pretty characterless. Ester overload. Dark fruit again, raisins, grapes, figs. After taste a lingering grape / grape seed. The esters really carry this beer...  M: Thin and over-carbonated. Maybe my bottle got a high dextrose load (is this done commercially?), I really can't explain this fizz, its awful.  O: Much too sweet for the style, the yeast esters are excellent but a little overpowering.

The head does quickly dissipate, but very nice to look at while it lasts. There the glass sits, dark brown, stoic, confident, patient.  S: Picked up the ripe fruits. Bananas, dates and figs come to the forefront. Various spices finish off the aroma.  T: 9% alcohol, but you would never know it. Very easy drinking, molasses and a sweetness in the front. The carbonation is present when you taste, which is unexpected. Dark fruits, bananas and spices present throughout.  M: Smooth, evenly coating the taste buds. The beer is effortless. It's doing a simple job and doing it well. No tricks or gimmicks, just consistent performance. It's the Rod Carew of beers.  O: I've had the La Fin Du Monde and now this from Unibroue and starting to form a very favorable opinion of their brewery. I love their straightforward approach and would recommend this beer should you come across it.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Belgian Dark Strong Ale,94
22,30,RusImpStoLuv,4.11,"12oz bottle into clean tulip glass, looks superb! Dark mohagany with a light brown-white head. Little spice on the nose, as well as the palate. Dark fruits as well as a little nuttiness throughout. Very smooth for the abv, Unibroue is very unique with the packaging which adds a little to the stigma of this Dark Ale. Great brew, cheers!",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Belgian Dark Strong Ale,94
22,30,MaximalC,4.49,"Pours the color of molasses with a bountiful head of tan froth. The invigorating aroma features clove, nutmeg, orchard fruit, and a hint of alcohol. Shark jaw lacing persists after each sip.  The taste is full and alive, with a bountiful melange of spices including the aforementioned clove, nutmeg, and possibly coriander. The malt profile offers raisin, prune, brown sugar, and bubblegum. Both spice and sweetness are there in abundance, but they're exquisitely balanced, making for an delicious, impactful brew with great staying power. A hint of alcohol finally begins to manifest in the finish as the beer warms. The lively carbonation accentuates the spices and brings a luscious, prickly mouthfeel, especially on the back end.  This is one of my all time favorite Belgian ales and was a gateway beer for me when it comes to the whole craft brewing phenomenon. To call any beer flawless is a tall order, but I must confess I have a really difficult time identifying any here.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Belgian Dark Strong Ale,94
22,30,TastyAdventure,4.1,"A - very dark, clear brown on edges. 1 1/2 finger head  S - mildly fruity, dark fruit.  T - mild dark fruit. smooth, sweet flavor with very mild small bitterness below for balance.  Overall, a pretty great beer. Carb is a litttle higher than most belgian darks. great for the price too.

22,30,precariouslydaniel,4.71,"Poured from a 12oz bottle into a snifter. Color is very dark cola, almost no light penetration with an insanely thick fluffy white head even with a gentle pour.  Smell is your standard quad notes-fig, raisin, plum and brown sugar with alcohol and spicy yeast phenols.  Taste is similar to the nose except it is more complex than many standard quads. I get notes of peach, melon and citrus as well as strong banana and confectioner's sugar. Amazing.  The mouth feel is full bodied and creamy but dissipates quickly on a sweet, sticky finish.  This is my personal favorite quad. In line with tradition but with a unique flair that allows it to stand out from the crowd.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Belgian Dark Strong Ale,94
22,30,pmarlowe,4.26,"Tulip glass.  A: Pours a dull, dark, dirt color with a finger of off white, foamy head. Superb retention and fat swaths of lacing.  S: Boozy fruit, waves upon waves of fruit. Raisin, cherry, loads of fig, plum. Pungent, but the flavors meld wonderfully. Really interesting aromas.  T: Same, lots of fruity malt and esters, with a little grape lingering on the off-dry finish.  M: Slightly milky, medium body, medium-high and sharp carbonation. Alcohol is not particularly noticeable.  O: Quite drinkable, super fruity, and interesting flavors which integrate very nicely. Not entirely unlike some sort of fruit cola. Very good stuff.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Belgian Dark Strong Ale,94
22,30,dar482,4.72,"The beer comes in a dark brown/black color with hues of reddish mahoghany in the light. A fluffy off white head.  The aroam has semi-dried raisins, slightly tart fig and plum, spices, caramel sweetness. Some phenolic nail polish.  The beer hits with caramel sweetness and light toffee in the front. It then moves onto white raisins, a bit of sweet dark raisins, dried plums, along with clove and pepper spiciness. There’s tons and tons of carbonation in the middle. There’s a hint of alcohol as well. The finish is of a gentle fruitiness and sweetness. The finish is dry, without much lingering flavor at all.  This is my favorite Unibroue brew. There’s complexity and everything works together. There’s nice fruit flavor, but not too much sweetness. Alcohol is extremely well hidden. The carbonation scrubs at the palate leaving a lighter body than what one may expect. This drinks easily, almost like a dark cherry soda. I would argue it stands up against classic Belgian brews and even better than Rochefort 8, comparable brew.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Belgian Dark Strong Ale,94

22,30,CraftyBeerDrinker,4.9,"I'll try not to be too giddy over this beer, but damn it's so good. The first time I tried it was an accidental pairing with a cajun bleu cheese burger in Coralville, IA, and I've been hooked ever since.  I'm not sure there is a better beer at hiding the ample alcohol content found in Trois. From start to finish it's impossible to find a flaw in this beer's characteristics. Distinct notes of plum and a satisfying body allow this beer to be drank with multiple foods, but I'll always remember my first time as the best.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Belgian Dark Strong Ale,94
22,30,BMMillsy,4.31,"12 oz. bottle from Gator Beverage in Gainesville. Pours a deep dark brownish purple with a nearly two finger creamy off white to khaki head. Big time dark fruit aroma , candy sugar, molasses, spicy Belgian yeast funk, as expected. Flavor is sweet and fruity up front with plums, cherries, pears, raisins. The finish ends with a good bit of spices that linger and play around with the sweet fruits on the tongue afterward. Medium heavy body with medium carbonation. Plenty of body but not chewy, which makes this plenty drinkable and pleasant. Nice for dessert or for anything else. Excellent BSA and there is a reason it is up there with the best of the style. Right on with all the flavors.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Belgian Dark Strong Ale,94
22,30,magictacosinus,4,"Poured out of a 12oz bottle into a tulip glass. Freshness date is ""02-27-15.""  Pours a dark, plum reddish color, complete with a foamy head at the top about two fingers high that fizzles down to a modest ring over the first minutes of consumption. Viscous in appearance, and cloudy as well. Isn't too showy, but looks good.  Contains a similar flavor profile at the front reminiscent to Maudite, with a larger focus on the spices, as well as dark fruits. For a year round offering, this flavor provides most seasonal winter warmers a run for their money: cinnamon, ginger, clove, and allspice, as well a load of black pepper at the finish. Dark fruits are very prominent, especially of the darker variety - raisins, prunes, and figs, to name a few. Finishes with a caramel/toffee flavor that melds with a mild bitterness to round out the spices and any potential sweetness. Slightly spicy, but nothing too intense. The alcohol is hidden rather well, especially at 9%. Really good - exactly what I'd expect from this brewery.  The flavor is a bit different, and is a little less heavy on the spices, as well as displaying a rigorous amount of maltiness and dried fruit character. Caramel is immediately at the front, followed by a little bit of chocolate. After, notes of raisins and prunes immediately wash away the sweetness, followed by a grainy bitterness, and a little bit of the spices mentioned earlier (cinnamon is the most predominant). The yeast is present here, especially with the bottle's age, and while the hops are faded, there is a mild herbal bitterness at the finish (which is close to black tea in flavor). Not too carbonated, but very full in character and comforting to drink. A solid dark Belgian-style ale.  This appeals to me with a bit of age as the sweetness is usually cut down dramatically with a bit of time. This delivers all the goods that a spiced, dark ale of this nature should have - dried, dark fruitiness, some spices, minimal sweetness, and little bit of that unique, wild Belgian yeasty character. This isn't even from Belgium and it's more enjoyable than half of the basic dark ales that come from there. I don't usually drink beers like this anymore but this is a very welcome addition to my cellar from time to time.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Belgian Dark Strong Ale,94
22,30,DaveBar,4.4,"Once again an excellent offering from Unibroue! Same price as many of the other offerings from this company in Canada.... $47.00/case of 24- 341ml bottles.  A- Excellent! Dark and cloudy. Opens with the typical Unibroue pop and high carbonation. Pours with a tremendous head which tapers down to a skim after a minute. Don't get me wrong, the carbonation on this girl is insane.  S- Very good. Enjoyable slightly sickly sweet aroma.  T- Excellent! Very good dark ale. Tons of malt and yeast. cinnamon touches. Heavy. Opens with a definite note of the 9%. Not hot but you know it's there.  M- A bit grainy but otherwise pretty good. As it warms that bite gets the middle of the tongue.  O- Excellent! NOT a daily drinker nor do you want to try more than one at a sitting. Excellent offering and will stock as a regular server to guests in my cellar.  Food Pairing  Trois Pistoles will match very well with... Beef Stew  The rich meaty nature of stew will match Trois Pistoles rather well.

Aroma: classic mix of Belgian yeast and cloves which comes off smelling like coca cola.

Notes: Perhaps the most authentic Belgian, not brewed in Belgium that I have had.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Belgian Dark Strong Ale,94
22,30,SpeedwayJim,4.14,"750ml corked and caged bottle into a Westvleteren XII chalice. Shared with schen9303.  Pours a foamy 1 finger light cream colored head that dissipates quickly. Beer is a clear, dark mahogany-brown. No lace. Below average considering the style.  Nose is sugary sweet. Grape, plum, and coca-cola. Molasses and spice too. Moderately aromatic. Solid.  Opens dark fruit. Plum, fig and grape. Some molasses, cocoa and nuttiness in the middle. Clove and other spices too. Brown sugar, honey, chocolate and more molasses at the end. Dark fruit mixed in the finish and aftertaste. Lightly boozy. Infinitely complex and very enjoyable.  Light bodied with ample carbonation. Prickly and bubbly in the mouth and goes down aggressive and crisp. Finishes accented with a lingering, pleasant finish.  This is certainly a very well made beer. Very complex with a feel that really supports the flavor. Worth trying and I'm curious to see what a bit of age does to this one.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Belgian Dark Strong Ale,94
22,30,thehyperduck,4.55,"First ticked in Dec 2013, but this review was not submitted until Nov 15 2014. 341 mL foil-capped bottle from the LCBO; from their Sommelier's Selection mixer. Bottled June 6 2014, and served slightly chilled.  Pours a deep brownish-copper colour, with a generous two fingers of frothy, light beige-coloured head seated atop. Good retention; it seeps away slowly over the next five minutes or so, eventually settling into a manageable half-cm cap and a wide, soapy collar. Nice lace too; this is an attractive beer all-around. The aroma is enticing too, including notes of raisin, fig, cherry, banana and plum, as well as slight hints of clove and their house yeast.  A fabulous Belgian dark. The malts are a little bready, with caramel and molasses soon being eclipsed by a nice range of dark, fruity flavours. More plum and raisin come through, as well as banana, cherry, chocolate and candi sugar. The finish is yeasty, spicy and somewhat earthy, lingering into the aftertaste and clinging to the palate. Medium-full in body, with assertive carbonation levels that give this strong ale a crisp, lively mouthfeel well into the glass. Dangerously drinkable, as is the case with all of these Unibroue BSDAs.  Final Grade: 4.55, an excellent A. This is the first time I've had the opportunity to try Trois Pistoles side-by-side with Maudite for comparison purposes. While I love Maudite, I think this one has a slight edge overall - the malt profile is a bit bolder, and the nice range of fruity flavours is guaranteed to satisfy Belgian dark ale fans the world over. One of the best beers in its style, bar none - you'd be a fool not to give this one a shot or two.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Belgian Dark Strong Ale,94
22,30,BeerWithMike,4.6,"Sampled last night on 12/4/13. Single bottle (12ounce?) was chilled down to 36 degrees F in my beer cooler. Poured into a pilsner glass.  Pours a very dark brown and is almost black in color. Has a 2-finger tan head that left some good lacing when sipped. The aroma is of cocoa with some dark fruits and some roasted malt. The taste was even better than the aroma and is very complex actually. Has a light smokey finish which is nice. No harsh or bitter aftertaste and goes down too easy. With the high alcohol, after a few of these you will be buzzin' real good. LOL! A great brew overall.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Belgian Dark Strong Ale,94
22,30,Braheem,4.94,I really like this beer. This one is very dark with almost no translucence. The head is a solid two fingers and is a devilish deep red color.  This brew is extremely good.

Smell: Underlying alcohol twinge, masked by heavy notes of dried fruit, mixed with other spices. Coriander, cinnamon, clove. Taste: Heavy sweet taste that lingers. Almost too sweet, syrupy flooding on first taste. Notes of raisin and raw wort. Caramelly malt flavors very present. Prunes, dates and pumpkin. Almost no hop acidity. Mouth: Pleasant, soft carbonation that is satisfying but not sharp. Balances the beer’s natural oiliness. Particular lingering heaviness that is enjoyable.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Belgian Dark Strong Ale,94

Chalky yeast baseline. Dark stonefruits. Cherry and plum, to be more specific. Cracked black pepper. Slightly herbal. Charcoal and smoke.  T: Medium char and dry bakers chocolate. Grape and cherry fruitiness. Chalky yeast. Black pepper and herbal phenols. Soot and a touch of smoke. Finish of yeasty spice, fading fruitiness, and hints of soot.  M: Medium bodied.

22,30,BeerDocT,4.4,"Appearance 4.0: Deep, dark, brownish black. Almost completely black. Opaque and mysterious. Head was average: 1/4"" and quickly dissipated.  Smell 4.0: Bouquet is subdued but very nice. Raisins, toasted grains, Belgian yeast and some pleasant caramel notes.  Taste 4.75: Front is somewhat sweet, but this fades quickly into a dry and pleasing middle. ""Dry "" is right: I detect lots of notes of dried and sweet fruits such as figs and raisins at this level. Finish is where slight hints of toasted grains and a very light hoppiness seep through. Aftertaste is short, smooth and entirely at the top of the palate, featuring a clean and refreshing light barley taste. No hint of the 9% ABV. Absolutely no indication of it at all.  Mouthfeel 4.0: Near-perfect complement to the beer. Just the right amount of carbonation.  Overall 4.5: Certainly the best Unibroue I have tasted so far. Refreshing, complex, smooth and dry. Flavor notes are nuanced and balanced rather than IN YOUR FACE. I have had many Belgian ""Strong Dark Ales"" and this is the best so far. Hint: do not drink it at fridge temp. Let it sit out for an hour at room temperature and then drink it. So many more of the dried fruit flavors come out when you do this; at least this is my experience.

22,30,1sophrosyne1,4.38,"Enjoyed over 20 dazzling minutes from a tulip glass. The pour is a deep chestnut hue that holds mist and barely allows light to pass. There's a creamy head with a tinge of lemon. Fairly thick lacing. The bouquet is complex--a smoky candy nose, pine and soft banana, cinnamon, with a lift of lemongrass. Spiced plums and toasty caramelized pears wrap around the yeasty core. Enters smooth with little initial taste…I sense cooling on the tongue with a hint of menthol. Then lively bubbles help lemon to carry in the standard (delayed) bloom of a Trappist...spicy (cinnamon & clove), dried steeped fruits, including golden raisin, cherry, orange, and plum. Earth and soft tannins, too, and caramelled banana. Syrupy and thick, with strong carbonation to match that enhances peppery end notes. The body is the best quality of this craft. A heavy, boozy beast with a festive but unsettling dose of methyl salicylate. This particular brew suffers in my review mainly because one of Unibroue's other offerings is even better!",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Belgian Dark Strong Ale,94

Smell: Spicy yeast, bready malts, tobacco, raisins, apple, pear, vanilla, plums, cherries, nice boozy alcohol, and caramel.  Taste: This is one beautifully tasting beer. Everything mentioned above is blended really well with a tad mild hop bitterness.  Mouthfeel: Silky smooth, a little chewy, low to medium carbonation, and medium bodied, and very delicious.

22,30,brurevu,4.41,It is a Belgian Style Strong Ale that pours a dark opaque brown with aromas of Belgian yeast and dark fruits. This is a beer you have to allow to warm a bit for all of the complex flavors and aromas to completely reveal themselves. Once it warms its deep rich dark fruit and roasted malt flavors come through the Belgian yeast tones. The very smooth and mellow flavors mask the high alcohol content and make this an easily quaffable brew.

22,30,Samuel906,4.03,"At first look, I was not too impressed with this beer. Average looking pour, dark muddy brown with golden tinge, and a very light head that dissipates quickly. Smell goes a long way for me with beer, and this one didn't really draw my attention. Belgian yeast, some earth tones and hints of apple make for a decent, but lackluster nose. But man, does this taste truly wonderful! Lots of fruits up front, green apple, cherries, grapes followed by darker dates, brown sugar, and figs. Lots of Belgian yeast, and clearly has some Tripel influence. No booze whatsoever. Body is damn near perfectly fitting, perhaps could use a touch more carbonation.

22,30,1000lbgrizzly,4.25,"A: Clear, but such a deep brown-red that all but the brightest background lights fails to permeate its body. Moderate brown head collapses to leave some froth at the surface, with long-lasting lacing- it clings. Aggressive bubbles rise along a quarter-circle of the glass opposite the direction I poured it in, only to vanish with the disruption of the first sip.  S: Sweet raisins and overripe fruit with some strong and varied spices. Something is really attacking my olfactory sense, a mixture of spice/sour, probably aided by the alcohol.  T: The sweet raisins dominate, but are accompanied by a banana and biscuit flavor. Exotic and warm spices are present throughout. Pretty complex, but very hard to pinpoint any particular spice. Finished like a good port; sweet, fruity, and alluring, with a whisper of alcohol warmth.  M: Strong carbonation on my lips while sipping it, but goes down smooth. Fairly thick and mouth-coating.  O: A very good beer, great balance, depth, and badass artwork. Unibroue always puts out beers that I crave again and again, this one chief among them.

22,30,Beric,4.38,"Serving: Bottle into tulip Served: 29 September 2013  Appearance: Magnificently dark, looks like black, dark-roasted coffee head on. Held near a light, notes of amber red surface near the edges. Not as dark as a stout, but pretty close. Huge three finger head that just keeps building for about two minutes after pouring due to an explosion of carbonation streaming from the bottom. Nice amount of bubbles stick around on the sides of the beer as its drunk despite the ABV.  Smell: Still some of that hefeweizen-like banana nose coming out of these Unibroue beers. Probably due to the yeast. Some faint date and raisin-like smells. Smells incredibly complex.  Taste: Magnificent. A truly exceptional beer, with the banana-like yeast notes complimented by dark fruit tastes (plums, dates, raisins). This is a great sipping beer with many complex flavors happening at once. ABV hidden in the taste, but certainly warming in the belly. Almost like a combination of a Dunkelweizen and Weizenbock (e.g. Aventinus)- you get the yeasty banana notes from a Dunkelweizen, but some of the dark fruit notes from Aventinus.  Mouthfeel: Silky smooth due to the high carbonation.  Overall: One of the best beers I've had, and a great beer to enjoy as the seasons change and the temperature drops and things get cold and damp. I would certainly buy this again.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Belgian Dark Strong Ale,94

Unique so far in my beer tasting experience.  m: Moderate and smooth, the heavy carbonation adds interest.  o: Unusual, not nearly as pleasant as La Fin du Monde.

22,30,CalgaryFMC,4.51,"Poured from 750 ml corked bottle at cellar temperature. Unique murky brown color, like dark chocolate syrup mixed with root beer and some tan froth. Aroma is a deep rich blast of dark fruits, cherries, strong Unibroue yeast, dark sugar, herbs, spice. Palate is also deep and dark, dates, raisins, dried cherries, brown spices, chocolate pudding, rum, molasses, and grassy hops. Sweeter and less spicy than Maudite. Finish is semi-dry with some hops like a Belgian dubbel; some sources consider this beer to be an example of this style. Some vanilla notes reveal themselves as the dark fruits recede. Some woody flavors recall a barrel-aged spirit but not overpowering. Stands with Maudite as one of the world's finest.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Belgian Dark Strong Ale,94
22,30,Kuaff,4.59,"Cellar temperature and in a snifter.  A very dark, ominously opaque color. A brown that's so murky and thick it appears quite black, honestly. The translucence that there IS betrays flashes of blood ruby. The head was about two-fingers of a festering bone white froth which was gone in no time. A memorable show. Leaves an attractive, soft-looking ring of froth around the surface. I love those evil-lookin' dark-red accents in this one.  Smells of grape juice, raisins, prunes, and other such alluring dark fruits. Maybe an ever-so-subtle hint of brandy and vanilla, too. I think there are also some cloves, ginger, and cinnamon in here. It's a SMOOTH aroma that is very sniffable, and suggests that this ale will be very drinkable as well.  The taste wraps up all the wonderful traits of the aroma in a package and then wraps a ribbon of sweet Belgian yeastiness around the whole thing. A slight bit of warm, cozy roasted earthiness adds the finishing touch... in the finish.  The feel is thick and viscous, but extremely effervescent. I love it when beers are simultaneously languid and lively like this.  A real stand-up example of a Belgian strong dark ale. Mmhmm.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Belgian Dark Strong Ale,94

S- Alcoholic notes arrive first, but dark malts and Belgian sugars come next. Definitely a funky Belgian smell with ample raisins.  T- Alcoholic and dark. Spicy and dark fruits. Some chocolate maybe from the malts? Spices and raisins are what I get most. Some Belgian sugars.  M- Slightly thicker than normal, wet. Well carbonated.  O- Tasty, aromatic and gorgeous. Wonderful beer. Thanks Canada.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Belgian Dark Strong Ale,94
22,30,BradMacMullin,4.96,Poured out of a bottle. Had a date on it - didn't care to look. This poured a deep dark caramely brown color. Little head and little lacing. The smell was a very pronounced fruity aroma - very strong. Smelled like raisins. The taste was great - the caramel and dark fruits seem to work well together on the palate - this is even better than Fin Du Monde. This is a smooth well balanced beer. A very strong Belgian Dark. Great stuff,Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Belgian Dark Strong Ale,94
22,30,BWED,4.17,"12 oz. bottle poured into a chalice.  A- Very dark brown body. Very turbid. Light tan head is dense and creamy, but only retains at about an 1/8"".  S- Sugary fruits and a little bit of chocolate. Some Belgian spice.  T- Big dark fruit flavor. The spices chimes in next, and there is just a tiny note of chocolate.  M- Zing of carbonation is the first thing to notice, but other than that the body is pretty delicate for a Belgian Strong Dark. The finish is sweet and spicy.  O- Great beer. Delicate but strong and every aspect of this beer blends harmoniously with the others.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Belgian Dark Strong Ale,94

A wonderful complex BSDA with a peppery finish that hides its ABV very well.  A – Pours a dark reddish brown, clear, but opaque in the glass. Small one-finger off-white head (but made a soft pour).  S – Spiciness dominates, followed by dark fruits of dried cherries and plums, some faint alcohol.  T – Rich malty sweetness, peppery spiciness in the finish. Low to zero bitterness.  MF – Medium bodied, well carbonated. An Abbey finish, not too sweet, but I would not call it medium dry either. Some alcohol, diacetyl slickness in the finish.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Belgian Dark Strong Ale,94
22,30,joe1510,3.93,"750ml. Bottle $7.49  Trois Pistoles poured dark dark mahogany into a snifter. When I hold it to the light there is a tremendous amount of big carbonation bubbles quickly rising to the 2 finger frothy antiqued white head. The head eventually falls to 1 finger and then much later to a cap. It's one of those beers that just looks packed with all sorts of deep flavors.  The smell is really nice. Starts with bread dough and a spicy yeast aroma. That is the backbone but there are many other aromas that compliment each other very nicely. Lots of fruit including plums and bing cherries along with remnants of brandy. There is a big layer of caramel sweetness as well. Very rich and deep.  The malts come strong with each sip including the sweet fruitness. Doughiness and caramel set the stage for the plum, cherries and possibly some black raspberries. Wonderful fruitiness. This is all intemingled with a spiciness from the yeast and a sprinkling of wite pepper. As it warms the alcohol comes through by warming my throat.  Mouthfeel is excellent. Prickly carbonation but in no way offensive. Coating medium body that allows the entire mouth the pleasure of this excellent brew.  Drinkability is really high on this one. Really easy going down because of the body and carbonation. The abv is nearly non-existent except for the warmth in the throat that is perfect for this time of year.  This is a really well made and enjoyable beer. I really try and sip these slowly when I have them but they taste so good and go down so easy it's tough. Trois Pistoles is one I go back to over and over.  Reviewed 12/24/06",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Belgian Dark Strong Ale,94

There is some of the roasted malt from the nose. Toasted grains  Feels slick and crisp with a tingly citrusy bite. Smooth and clean but coats the palate.

A: Has a massive beige-cream soapy head to it, takes up half the glass but dissipates within a few minutes. Is a complex burnt red- copper color, very murky, and has small amounts of lacing.  S: Very aromatic, smells of brown sugar, malts, plums, barley, cinnamon, spices, can smell little booze as well. Earthy, bold and complex.  T: Very balanced, very smooth as well. Tastes of barley, malts, Belgian yeast, a bit sweet as well, sugars, plums, other dark fruits, with a slight warm finish from the alcohol.  M: A very balanced and complex beer. Has a full body with lower levels of carbonation, giving it good thickness. Quite boozy and a slow sipper.  O: I've had quite a few brews from Unibroue and I have yet to be disappointed. On the pricey side, put well worth it, I felt I should've let it cooled a little bit more but in this situation I couldn't control myself.

It smells strongly of light fruits, bubblegum (very slight amounts), spritzy citrius, and a nice solid malty sweetness to round it all off. But none of the smells overpower the other. This is easily one of the best dark belgans ales I've ever smelled 5/5  Taste: big heavy matiness, with some VERY slight hop bitterness in the after taste. It has a scary drinkable character. (no booz can be detected at all) 4/5  Mouthfeel: The beer has a huge slick, heavy moughfeel, but its offest by a perfect level of carbonation that helps thin out the heavy mouthfeel. Its a fantastic combination. 4.5/5  Overall. I had this beer because it was canada day and I decided that it was as good an excuse as any for a beer. All they had from canada was Unibroue...and I can safely say that I made a good decision. This beer is a good decision even if it isn't Canada day.

22,30,Kooz,3.48,"Poured into a Guinness fluted pint glass. Half-inch head, light tan, still some left by the end of the glass. The beer is a dark, but not opaque, brown.  Smells sweet (molasses) and there's an undertone of alcohol, but not in a liquor-type way. It's enticing.  There's a warmth to this beer. It's a high ABV and that comes through, but not in an overpowering way. I get a sticky sweetness with every sip, which was nice at first but became overbearing by the end of the glass. I'd give this beer a higher score up front than in the aftertaste, but I'll round it out to 3.5.  Good body, would like it to be a bit creamier to let the flavors spread over the tongue a bit better, but it's good.  Make no mistake, this is a good beer.

Yeasty, fresh aroma. Flavor combines bright Belgian ale malt flavors with rich date, sour cherry, and plum fruit flavors. Spicy up front (cinnamon, clove).

There's also some malt but it's hidden beneath the other complex dark flavors.  The flavor is similar to the nose. Sweet dark fruits (apple and pears again) with some malts. Spicy belgian yeast dominates quickly after the initial flavor. Warming alcohol at the end.  Tons of prickly carbonation give this brew a good body.  Great beer.

22,30,stella77artois,4.05,"12 oz. bottle poured into pint glass.  A - Haven't seen many beers that have been more impressive to look at. Dark, dark brown, almost black. Thich looking. Not much a head, though. Some bubbly action visible.  S - Not a whole lot going on, but nothing negative. Malt and sweet dark berries is what I got. As the beer warmed, the sweet aroma became more prevalent. A hint of a roasty smell at times, too.  T - Pretty darn good. A bold, slightly sweet malt taste, along w/ aforementioned berries. As the beer warmed, the dark berry taste became a bit sour. Nothing bad, but that keeps this brew from being just a bit higher on my list. Very suprised that even when warmed a bit, the 9% ABV really isn't noticeable. Alcohol can be tasted, sure, but never offensive or hot.  F - Almost a perfect thickness. No need to chew, but you know it's there. Carbonation is noted, and am ok w/ the amount. Beer seems like, albeit dark, could still be refreshing on a hot day.

22,30,jlindros,4.23,"Ug, despite the awesome beers, still using a screw cap!  Pours a nice fizzy 1 finger head that fades semi quickly as the big bubbles pop, spotty lacing, over dark molasses mahogany murky beer with hints of ruby light sneaking through.  Nose is a nice Belgian beer aroma, typical Belgian yeast with light esters, fruity aromas, light spices like very faint cinnamon and nutmeg, fig and date like fruit, malts bring a faint molasses and candi sugar, with faint booze and touch of phenols, and even a touch of an apple pear like fruit.  Taste starts with big malts, fairly sweet but not really syrupy, with candy flavors, candi sugar, molasses, etc. Then fruits, a little raisin fig and date, as well as light fruity esters bringing apple and pear. More baking spices with faint cinnamon and nutmeg like. The sweetness brings some warming slightly tingly booze, as well as a touch of phenols. Overall a nice Belgian like taste profile, a nice Belgian strong ale. The booze gets a little anesthetizing as it goes almost with tingly feel. Finish is still semi sweet but drier, long lingering candy flavor with molasses and candi sugar, even a little nutty toffee, with more dark fruits, candied fig, and plenty of booze.  Mouth is med bodied, plenty of bubbly sharp carbonation, and plenty of tingly booze.  Overall nice, a long time favorite for me, nice dark malts and fruit flavors as well as sweet flavors and the Belgian characters, even the light spices were nice. the booze gets a little too strong overall and might be the only downfall.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Belgian Dark Strong Ale,94

22,30,THANAT0PSIS,4.24,"Unibroue Trois Pistoles  Appearance: A member of the catchall style that is “Belgian strong dark ale”, Trois Pistoles pours a dark brown with a ruby red tint. As seems to be the norm for Unibroue beers, the head requires a gentle touch in the pour to keep within the glass. Treating the bottle like a small child yields a gorgeous tan head three fingers in height. It is stubborn, sticking around for ages and leaving amazing lacing all over. The beer is also extremely effervescent, which is perhaps a factor in the staying power of the head. There are no alcohol legs, surprising for its 9% ABV.  Aroma: As expected, dark fruits abound. Figs, grapes, plums, cherries (slightly tart) are the dominant aromas, but there are also sweet caramel malts, honey, spiciness like black pepper, clove, and a touch of coriander. There is also a bready, yeasty smell, that seems characteristic of Unibroue beers. Alcohol is present in a slight tingle. Like La Fin du Monde, this one has a lot of nice things going on in the aroma (and smells true to style) but simply is too weak overall to really impress.  Taste: Praise be, it is much more flavorful than the nose would let on; in fact, it nearly follows the nose perfectly, but exponentially stronger tasting than it was smelling. The dark fruits are prominent, tasting mostly like plums and cherries, but with a fig sweetness. Then comes a great molasses/brown sugar component from the malts that really reigns in any sourness that the dark fruits may have given it. Cola is a prominent flavor as well, and there are even some lighter fruits like pears present toward the back of the taste. The very end of each sip brings the spicy yeast character that ties everything up in a nice, dry bow. This beer finishes very clean with only lingering earthiness. A really fantastic example of the style, if not quite on par with its Trappist colleagues.  Mouthfeel: Trois Pistoles is creamy, nice carbonation, medium-bodied, and exceedingly drinkable, especially for the style. Beers like this usually feel much heavier, but this one goes down smooth and is surprisingly refreshing. The alcohol is there, but sits at a comfortable warmth that builds as the beer goes down. The finish is reminiscent of red wine in its dryness. It is a bit odd for the style, but a little deviation here improves the drinkability (something that may be dangerous given the relatively high ABV).  Overall: This is a fantastic example of the Belgian strong dark ale style. For the most part, it is very classic, but the shift toward drinkability greatly benefits the beer overall. Based on this and La Fin du Monde alone, Unibroue is most deserving of its sterling reputation. This beer is up there, though not better than, the great examples of the style, and it is certainly cheaper. If you, like me, have been waiting to pull the trigger on this or other Unibroue beers, wait no longer: you are missing out. 17.5/20",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Belgian Dark Strong Ale,94

A normal pour produces about two fingers of dense, creamy, tan head that drops pretty quickly into a thick cap.  S-The smell is quite sweet and malt dominant. I smell lots of dark, candied fruit like plums and raisins. The alcohol is sweet and solvent-like, but it fits pretty well into the beer. Its a nice mixture, if not as complex as some.  T-The taste, although still sweet, is not quite a tooth-tingling as the smell would lead you to believe. I detect dark, sweet fruits, and some raisin and prune like the smell, but the taste has more spices like pepper, clove, and cinnamon. There is also some cocoa powder in there.  M-The feel is a real highlight. It is soft, lightly creamy, and medium to full bodied.  O-Along with La Fin du Monde, Trois Pistoles was one of my early craft beer experiences, so it is nice to get around to reviewing it. This is a big strong beer with lots of flavor and great mouthfeel. However, with lots of other big strong beers to compete against now, it may lack the complexity that the best examples of this style possess.

22,30,barczar,4.09,"Best before 2012.  Pours an almost opaque cola with garnet highlights and a foamy half inch khaki head that lingers.  Molasses, raisins, plums, dark cherries, and belgian yeast form the initial aroma. There's a buttery note and a bit of bready malt. There's slight vinous and musty character that emerges.  Belgian yeast is huge initially, along with dark fruit. Yeast esters of green apple and a vinous character dominate, eventually allowing prunes, dates, and raisins to surface. There's a bit of toasted caramel malt character and molasses sweetness. But esters really are prevalent. There's slight peppery notes at the finish. Becomes breadier and more buttery as it warms.  Body is slightly full and syrupy, with low carbonation and slight alcohol warmth.  Far more estery than I recall. Could be the age. Would prefer more dark fruit prudence and more malt character.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Belgian Dark Strong Ale,94
22,30,TheDoctor,3.92,"A: Pours a rich, murky red-amber with some gold when it's in the light. Has a thick head and mellows out to a nice consistent head with lots of lacing.  S: Immediate pungent hoppy aromas along with cloves and pine, has some malty sweetness too. Smells 'warm.'  T: Nice, round flavor. Tastes kind of earthy but defintiely has some vauge spicy-sweetness to it. The bottle says it stays in your mouth afterwards like port. It really does. It's quite enjoyable  M: Gentle warmness, with strong carbonation and a long-lingering afterburn.  O: Genuinely delicious beer. I am kind of at a loss of words for how to describe it. It is not super bitter, nor is it super sweet. It is warming and refreshing at once. Super good. I tried a couple of their beers before and wasn't really convinced about how good a lot of folks think they are. I am definitely starting to come around.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Belgian Dark Strong Ale,94
22,30,Lemke10,4.66,"This pours a medium brown color with a foamy, beige head. The aroma is slightly yeasty and malty with some dried fruit. The taste is very rich and bold with lots of complex flavors. There is mostly dried fruit and spices that finishes with a lingering yeast after taste. Gives off a good little alcohol warmth as well. Very well made!",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Belgian Dark Strong Ale,94
22,30,Braber,4.27,"A: A beautiful ruby red / mahogany that is just transparent enough to see through. Fairly tight white head that dissipates rather quickly.  S: Large dose of the Belgian yeast character right away. Transitions to fruit characters that are backed up by a little bread-like quality.  T: Sweetness of the malt blends really well with the high alcohol of this one. Dark fruit character that transitions to a bit of apricot and nectar quality.  M: The beer is thin due to the high ABV but holds quite a bit of mouthfeel, all things considered. For 9% this is about all the body one could ask for.  O: Great beer that gets me excited about Belgian dark's all over again. A beer of great quality that allows me to keep faith in traditional styles.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Belgian Dark Strong Ale,94
22,30,BaltimoreBeerLover,4.01,Poured from 12 oz. bottle into a wine glass.  Appearance: Dark red-brown that is opaque. Big fluffy white head that disappears fairly quickly. Some lacing.  Smell: Smells like a typical belgian dark ale with a very nice ripe fruit aroma.  Taste: No alcohol taste whatsoever is surprising for a 9% beer. Typical belgian dark ale taste plus a little spiciness like nutmeg and the ripe fruit aroma is present in the taste as well although not as pronounced. Tastes like La Fin Du Monde but not as flavorful.  Mouthfeel: Medium carbonation with a flavor that really coats the entire mouth and lingers for a while.  Overall: Great beer overall. I love the strong fruit aroma because it does not smell fake. 3.9/5.,Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Belgian Dark Strong Ale,94
22,30,thecheapies,3.98,"Pours a dark purple-red-brown with about a three-inch collar. Some light passes through. Nice retention.  Medicinal yeast blasts me upfront. Notes of plum, tobacco, dark bready malts, pear, phenols, pinot, and a dry cidery apple. Interestingly, not picking up much alcohol.  Super phenolic. Typical Unibroue yeast dryness and delicate nuttiness along with other dry notes of dark fruits. Plum, grape, and pear. Mild tobacco and some booze. Lots of hospital tray medicinal notes. Finishes long and musty.  Medium in body, maybe a little more. Piquant carbonation inhibits the swallow a tad. Headier now, works well as a sipper. Perhaps, as an aperitif, with that dryness and medium bitterness making me hungry.  Not my preference for this style, but it's strangely charming. Execution is primo. Has a unique signature.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Belgian Dark Strong Ale,94

Flavor: starts sweet, but the alcohol balances this off to bring in some nice fruity esters of dark fruits plum, dates. With the sweetness and dark fruit it is almost, almost port like.Very low bitterness.  Mouthfeel:creamy. Moderately low carbonation. Warms as it goes down.  Impression: a tad on the sweet side for me, but very drinkable for the strength.

22,30,DougT,4.45,"Poured bottle dated 11-14-14 into Rochefort chalice.  A: Clear very dark brown to nearly black. 1 finger tan head that quickly dissipated to nothing. No lace at all, and that's in an etched beer glass.  S: Yeast, spice and grains, a little fruit. Like a good bread but not as strong. Subtle scent of dates and flowers.  T: Smooth, not sweet but definitely not bitter. A little dark fruit, but subtle. A little bitter in the finish. Peppery. Not hoppy. I can detect a little alcohol. Not very complex, but a very nice dark ale flavor. Not as sweet as a Belgian, but the flavors remind me of some of the Trappist ales, just more subtle.  M: Very drinkable. Very smooth with a light-medium body. Not as heavy as the color would imply. Mostly involves the top of the tongue. Mellow and subtle. Plenty of fizz tingle even with no lace on top.  O: I find this a very versatile ale. I could drink this for refreshment on a hot day or sip a chalice sitting next to a warm fire on a cool winters eve.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Belgian Dark Strong Ale,94

The head settles to a thin cap and leaves behind some nice lacing.  S- There's a sense of Belgian spiciness to it, but the dark fruit really takes command here, but still not overbearing.  T- The taste is just delightful. Cherries and raisins blend wonderfully with innumerable other flavors that come out as the beer warms. The slight sweetness pulls everything together.  M- Nothing much wrong here. Creamy and well-carbonated.  O- Another solid offering from Unibroue. Just go get one.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Belgian Dark Strong Ale,94
22,30,Danno48,4.29,"Looks very dark... Like watered down chocolate milk. Nice white head that goes down pretty quickly and not a whole bunch of lacing.  Sweet smell of grapes and maybe a sort of balsamic note. Smells a bit woodsy and perhaps a hint of fruitcake.  As far as Belgian dark ales go... this one has the most pronounced dark fruit flavor ever. Prunes, figs, ripe cherries and a very slight hint of some spice. Mild alcohol burn throughout.  Very fizzy and velvety on the tongue.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Belgian Dark Strong Ale,94

S - Hay and bubblegum, Followed by some crisp apple and chocolate covered cherries. Brown and candied sugar come through as well.  T - Beef and chocolate covered cherries hit right away, Shortly followed by dated and brown sugar. The cirsp apples and candied sugar come through in the finish.  M - Medium bodied with almost no carbonation.  O - Overall, It was a solid Belgian style ale that is quite sessionable, although it has a bit of an off-sweetness. I'd have again.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Belgian Dark Strong Ale,94
22,30,stephenjmoore,4.22,"A- Dark brown body with little transparency. Thin, foamy white head that is not as prominent as most other Belgian-style beers.  S- Spicy Belgian yeast, dark dried fruits, a hint of cherry, slight nutty aroma as well. All in all, this of smells good.  T- Almost tastes like a dark tripel (if that was a style). A mix of tree fruits (pears, some apple), and the dark dried fruits (figs, some raisins). Belgian yeast comes through a lot to give a spiced bread flavor.  M- High carbonation, full bodied, creamy and bready with a sharp tingle.  O- Very interesting combination of flavors. Close to being muddled together, but it works.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Belgian Dark Strong Ale,94

The head breaks slowly leaving some nice lacing.  S: dark fruits, bananas and that lovely unibroue yeast. Molasses is there as well.  T: malty sweetness with the dark fruit profile coming up. Also the yeast mixes in nicely.  M: smooth with moderate carbonation. The alcohol is hidden nicely  O: I'm not afraid to say I have a soft spot for unibroue, and this beer is one of the reasons. It may have been the first craft type beer I had. The yeast profile and dark fruityness made me say ""wait what? There's more beers that taste like this"" and from there I was gone.

S- Wowsers. I hardly had to put my nose to the glass, the aroma jumps from this one. Big notes of candy sugar, figs, cherries, prunes, and a hint of cocoa. Smells pretty much fantastic.  T- Follows the nose perfectly, and it's just so darn good I can hardly stand it. An absolute harmony of dark fruits with a hint of cocoa. Sweet, but has a grassy hop component to lend just a touch of grassy hops.  M- Has the typical aggressive Belgian carbonation, fairly thick, medium to full bodied.

The nose is varied with cloves, dried fruits, raisin, banana, lemon, and sweet malts.  The taste and feel are smooth beyond belief, with warm dates, prunes, grape and grains. There's a bit of chocolate and fruity sugars, the taste is diverse and complex. I catch a mint like quality in amongst several fruity flavors but even a touch of pepper.

22,30,takemetothelion,3.96,"Picked up at Bootleggers after becoming addicted to the Unibroue collection. $7 such a good deal for a world class beer. Excited to be trying another dark ale, we shall see if it lives up to the other Quebec classics.  A- A finger and a half of head on this dark menace. Moderate to heavy carbonation and a ruby black coloration that is shrouded in mystery.  S- Subtle nose overall. Apricot and spice with other fruit elements, light yet balanced.  T- Fruity and sweet! well spiced quite drinkable as it is quite smooth. Alcohol hidden until right at the end where it kinda lingers. Lovin it  MF- carbonation lingers on after taste, not so suggestive at the introduction. Velvety smooth with a full mouthfeel though something missing as if diluted in a way.  Overall, not as good as the grand reserve 17 but an exceptional specimen and a dangerous drink due to drink ability and high alcohol content.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Belgian Dark Strong Ale,94
22,30,tectactoe,3.97,"Pours a very dark, murky, swampy brown color, completely opaque. Some very minor hints of ruby can be seen when held up to direct lighting. A very fine-bubbled, beige head forms with decent retention, though lacing is minimal at best. One whiff of this stuff and it's very clear that it's a Belgian style ale. Belgian yeast abound, hints of dark, fruity esters, light banana, spices, clove, plums, and mild phenol. The aroma isn't nearly as strong, sweet, or abundant as many other BSDAs, which is somewhat of a let down. Naturally, things get a little better as it warms up, but I was still expecting a bigger punch out of this one.  The taste matches the nose quite well - earthy esters, dirty, slightly musky hop bitterness, sweet prunes and dates, spicy yeast, clove, pumpernickel and rye toast, light caramel-like malts, very faint molasses and sugar. Some grape skin flavors are there as well, which mesh with the alcohol character to produce a wine-like sweetness that comes out at the end. Nice mix of yeasty-fruity with spicy-earthy; there isn't one flavor that severly overpowers any other, so if there's one thing this BSDA does extremely well - it's balance. Much like the aroma, I would've like the flavor to be a bit bigger and bolder. The body was even a little thinner than I would expect for this still, medium at best, with a high amount of carbonation. The aftertastes dies down with some spice grape and apple skin esters erring on the earthy side of things, maybe with a touch of clove and spice.  Maybe I was being a little too critical because I had such high hopes for this beer after many recommendations from friends and such high ratings on this sight. Don't get me wrong, this beer is damn good, balanced excellently, and certainly unique. But it doesn't quite hit ""blow-me-away"" status. Something I definitely wouldn't turn down if offered, and certainly not bad at only 8$ for a bomber.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Belgian Dark Strong Ale,94
22,30,jrzellerman,4.72,"A great Ale. I've been drinking Trois Pistoles for a while. A great price considering the quality. Whenever I drink this, I taste a lot of fruity notes.

So this is going to be short and to the point, but really what more do you need to know other than: it’s fantastic. Delicious. Drink it. For the price, the accessibility, and above all the quality this can’t be beat.  Pours a thick, dark ruby-burgundy with light foam. Wonderful bouquet with stone fruits dominating. The flavor shares an equal profile, with some plum and fig as well as a date-like sweetness standing out. What I find remarkable is how smooth (and smoothly sweet) this is. I mean, almost velvety. While not unusual I forget. (Belgian Strong Ale is not as clearly defined a category in my mind as say a dubble or triple and the wide variation is part of the reason.)

Light non descript fruity flavors and a touch of alcohol round out this out quite nicely. Medium body with a spirited level of carbonation and a sweet bubbly mouthfeel. I really liked this beer.

22,30,CBrotherton,4.03,"Appearance - First pour yielded little to no head, which seemed strange. Other reviews suggest this is atypical. Has low amount of bubbles on surface after head subsided. Low to moderate levels of bubbles rising to surface.  Smell - Strong aroma of raisins and plum. Sweet and fruity. Very bold, like biting into half a dozen plums at once.  Taste - Very sweet. Raisin and plum flavors. Very earthy taste. Very sweet. Almost too much taste in each sip.  Mouthfeel - Compared to the Le Fin du Monde (same brewery) that I recently rated, carbonation is lower than its sister, however, overall carbonation is medium and even across the tongue. 9% ABV is hidden slightly by the body, which is more subtle than expected for a high ABV content.  Overall - I confess that I was expecting a more direct and 'up-front' experience with this beer. Knowing my expectations, I can give a more accurate response on this beer. Having the fruit aroma and taste to it, I am at a loss as to what or how else the flavor/aroma could be altered to suit my 'ideal' taste of this beer. Though I, personally, cannot handle the aroma/taste for long (about half a bottle), it is enjoyable (for me) up to that point.  I still have three more bottles.

22,30,AmitC,4.45,"My second Unibroue. Did not know the reputation when i bought those bottles.  Poured from a 12 oz bottle into my snifter.  Brown color while pouring and in the light. Deep mahogany to slightly dark brown in the glass. A hell lot of bubbles. One finger thick off white colored head, that persists really well, not as thick but still. Some lacing is left on the sides while drinking.  Smell: A lot like a mix of Belgian and doppelbock. Belgian yeast smells are the first thing that enter nose along with the clove smell. Some dry nuts, roasted malts and slight sweetness. Alcohol is missing and at 9% it is an excellent thing.  Taste: Very Belgian, yeast like. Some minor cloves, less than as suggested by nose. Some sweet malts. No bitterness. Nothing really specific. Very fruity taste inside the mouth. Semi dry finish.  Mouth feel: Easy on palate, very soft yet has some astringency related to high carbonation. An easy drinking beer otherwise.  Overall, a good brew, as usual. One thing that is very well hidden is its alcohol strength. At 9.0% it never feels like one. Neither in taste, nor in nose. Kudos here.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Belgian Dark Strong Ale,94

S- Big belgian yeast and bubblegum aroma, clove, raisin, and cinnamon. Prominent yeast and spice notes in the nose  T- Big clove, belgian yeast, and bubblegum flavors at the forefront. Cinnamon, appleskin, and a rich maltiness.  M- Very high carbonation, nice alcohol warming on the finish, medium body, and a little sticky. Way too easy to drink.  O- This is an outstanding belgian strong dark ale and makes me wonder why I have not revisited Unibroue aside from La Fin Du Monde in such a long time.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Belgian Dark Strong Ale,94
22,30,Kremlock,4.3,"A: Pours a 1/2 inch off white head that quickly falls to very low lacing. Beer has the colour of prune juice (dark brown with violet hues)  S: Cloves, cinnamon, spicy, raisins. A bit of a ""Christmas"" scent.  T: Raisins, clovy esters, caramel malt backbone with balanced bitterness. Chocolate on the finish.  M: High carbonation that has a sharpness that cleans the palate. Good dry finish with residual sweetness yet still balanced with bitterness.  O: A great beer all and all. Not too over the top on flavours yet they are all very present and balanced.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Belgian Dark Strong Ale,94
22,30,bishopdc0,3.97,"Had in a trois pistols tulip at novare red  The beer is dark, brown In the light but otherwise black. The head is surprisingly light a offense which covers the top of the beer while lacing hangs to the side.  The nose is clearly Belgian, yeast, clove and other spices. The nose is much more aromatic as it warms.  The taste starts almost fruity which lingers and a big yeast clove and spice enter and dry the mouth. Not my favorite style but true and as good as any from Belgium.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Belgian Dark Strong Ale,94

Plums, raisins, grapes, bananas, red wine, sour, candi sugar, medicine, caramel malts  M- Oily, creamy body, crisp carbonation  O- A malty red wine. That's the easiest way to describe this.

It's as standard and as beautiful as it gets when it comes to Belgian Dark Ales.  HUGE yeasty fruitiness. It smells like a fresh batch of bananas with some raspberries and dark sugar thrown in; it's hard to describe.  This beer is so perfect. You get this strong yeast presence, followed by a nice fruity malt bill; and it goes down smooth. No taste of alcohol. You may ""feel"" some of it on the way down, but there really is zero detection.  There are many a nostalgic moment attached to this beer. Very small room for improvement. I honestly do not understand why this does not carry a higher score.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Belgian Dark Strong Ale,94
22,30,Quackershnoc,3.72,"12-ounce bottle, served in a tulip glass Appearance: it's pretty dark, kind of molasses colored; a thin, off-white head that has mostly disappeared after a minute or two, but some lacing remains all the way until the end Aroma: sweet; there are some pretty clear dark fruit notes, maybe raisin or plum, smells a little boozy Taste: kind of hard to describe; it's very smooth; despite its high ABV it does not taste much like alcohol; it starts very bright and moves more toward the dark fruit flavors; sweet throughout, but not overly so; finishes with a malty flavor that is quite nice and some chocolate; aftertaste is a little mixture of all the flavors; a nice hint of spice Mouthfeel: a lot of carbonation, more than I would like; fairly thick or syrupy, coats the mouth well Overall Impression: it gets much better as it warms up, the flavors come out more and the carbonation isn't as aggressive as it when it was colder; it is a nice fall beer, a little hearty and sure to warm you up some; it's got some layers of flavor in it that I cannot quite identify and had some trouble describing-a complex sipper (which seems to be something that Unibroue is known for); I think my favorite taste is the end, as all the flavors kind of come back together one last time as you swallow, but I think it smells even better than it tastes",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Belgian Dark Strong Ale,94

22,30,RussBecker1,4.52,"Trois Pistoles is one of the most interesting beers I have ever had the pleasure of tasting. The flavoring is absolutely massive in itself. There are big hits of chocolate and smokey coffee, but they are complimented by a big hit of cherry and grape. It is a dessert beer that stands as a meal in itself. There is a ton of alcohol however, which shapes the beer very differently than anything I have ever had. The alcohol pairs hand in and with the deeper fruit notes creating a sweet wine finish. Trois Pistoles tasted like a fine port mixed with a delicious quad, I have not had much like it.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Belgian Dark Strong Ale,94
22,30,NuclearDolphin,4.02,"Poured into a Tulip Glass  Appearance - Dark Brown with a brown fizzy 2 finger head. There's a slight crimson tinge around the edge of the glass but aside from that it's very dark  Smell - Caramel, Cloves, Figs, Plums, Spices, and Malts. This smells surprisingly fruity, especially with it's plum scent. Overall, it's also different from other strong ales I've had before in terms of scent; However the smell is at the very least pleasant if not tolerable.  Taste - Plums, Cloves, Spices, Figs, Yeasts and Roasted Malts. Much like the smell, this is very sweet smelling. It does warm you up a bit due to the alcohol, but the flavor itself comes off as very smooth and enjoyable.  Mouthfeel - Very Light & thin. There's also some mild carbonation, and thankfully it adds to the flavor itself. Another plus is that it feels very crisp and refreshing.  Overall - For a Strong Ale, it's different and unlike any I've tried before, which is good or bad depending on who you are. As a beer, it's a nice enjoyable ale that you should check out.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Belgian Dark Strong Ale,94

22,30,RonaldTheriot,4.12,"Unibroue Trois Pistoles has a thin, beige, cola-style fizzy head and a dark, murky, bubbly, dark-brown appearance with lots of beige chunks floating about. The aroma is of fruit-cake fruit, dark bread, fudge, and spice. Flavor is of the same, with low bitterness. Mouthfeel is light and watery (surprisingly), and Unibroue Trois Pistoles finishes dry and ice tea-like. This is a strange ale, and I was a bit underwhelmed by it. It’s worth checking out, though.

22,30,spokeydonkey,4,"Poured from a 12 bottle into a Duvel tulip glass.  A - Very dark brown (almost black) with a very minimal off-white head. Not nearly as much lacing as I'd expect from a Belgian dark.  S - Some roast notes and alcohol sharpness up front Pear and apple fruit behind that.  T - Surprising amount of roastiness all through, almost stout-like and smoky. Starts off sweet, followed up by fruitiness: apple and pear. Finishes with a lingering roast character.  M - Relatively low carbonation on this one. Medium body.  O - This one used to be one of my favorites. I haven't had it in a while and didn't review it. Having it again, it seems very roast-forward. Not sure if it's just this batch or if my tastes have changed, but the roast is a bit too dominant for me.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Belgian Dark Strong Ale,94
22,30,FrankyGee3,4.85,"Appearance: Ebony in glass with a deep cherry wood color when held to the light; bouncy, deep tan head that sat two fingers high (barkeep did a very slow pour from the tap, and a bottle pour would likely produce three fingers). Laced on glass well. Head dissipated quickly to 1 CM, then disappeared within a few minutes.  Smell: Fruit aromas (largely fig, plum) along with maltiness; some phenols which dissipate quickly. Others have mentioned chocolate but, after three separate tastings, fail to find much if any.  Taste: Rich, smooth, fruity with perhaps a touch of coriander/citrus. Sweeter than expected, but not overly so. Fruitiness balances well with the ale bitters - each side presents well.  Mouthfeel: Coats well, surprisingly light - crisp, no oiliness, but smooth and felt everywhere on the tongue. One of the best ever for me with a mellow alcohol tang. While not a very carbonated drink, what carbonation there is sparkles in the mouth when sipped and contributes to a lighter mouthfeel, even surprisingly light for an abbey ale, but with substance - a delightful blend.  Overall: While described as an ""Abbey Style Strong Dark Ale,"" it was not as strong tasting as expected. The lower alcohol warmth - especially for a 9% ABV ale - surprised me, as did the substantial fruit tastes. At times, the taste was a bit like a fortified digestif wine (say, a port or very fruity brandy) without the syrupy wine texture, but never lost it's beeriness; it also didn't have the nose-confusing, overwhelming alcohol delivery of a digestif. While not a fan of sweet beers, this is a nice blend of fruits and dark abbey ale which balances the best of both. Perhaps an all-time favorite for blending so many distinct flavors and characteristics in such a balanced way. In the end, I'd give it a 4.75 (I've yet to find a 5), but that's not an option here.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Belgian Dark Strong Ale,94

Nice smooth fruity note at first followed by malty, almost bready, sweetness. Even some flavors like chocolate on the aftertaste.  Mouthfeel: This is an exceptionally smooth beer. The carbonation is lower while the body is medium to high. The smooth flavors really coat the mouth well.  Overall: This is a great example of this style of beer, very well made and easy to get.

22,30,Dope,4.1,"Bottle states best before 08/27/12. Oh well!  A: A very dark brown pour with a bit of red in there. Large and fizzy light brown head. Fades at a moderate pace with good head retention, but minimal lacing.  S: Sweet dark fruits, mainly raisin, fig and grape. Some caramel and a hint of chocolate. Swear I get some oak but I'm not even if this oak-aged.  T: Super sweet and fruity up front. Loaded with grape, fig and raisin. A little apple and even melon in the middle. Sweetness fades away in the middle and it becomes almost borderline tart. It gets a little earthy and spicy at the same time. Ends a touch drying with more dark fruits. Maybe even some cherry in there?  M: Medium bodied, not as heavy as you'd expect. Fairly high carbonation cuts it a bit.  O: A super fruity BSDA. Most BSDAs are fruity to begin with, but this one is loaded with a variety of strong and sweet fruit flavors. Very complex, very nice balance and very tasty.

The smell has so many sweet dark fruits, its unreal. loads of burnt sugar, charred oak, brown rum, and molasses.  The taste is scary good. The carbonation is very prickly, much more than I expected after the flat look. Plums, prunes, and molasses come to mind. The slight hint of booze is like a sweet dark rum, but in a good way. Its sweet from the molasses and brown sugar flavors.

Faded rather quickly to a solid cover on the liquid. Leaves as little lacing.  Smell: Rich roasted malts, a touch of a sweetness to the smell as well. Aromas of dark fruits, a little plum, raisin. Some alcohol aroma sneaks through as the beer warms up.  Taste: Taste is somewhat complex, changing as the beer is consumed and warms a little. Simply put it is mostly malty, nothing really giving a hop bitterness. A little sweetness. Taste falls in line with aroma. This is a big beer with high ABV, yet the alcohol is well hidden.  Mouthfeel: Full bodied, limited natural carbonation. Smooth, a little slick going down. Alcohol warms me up, yet it does not burn the throat going down.  Overall: A very good beer. Got this bottle at a one time introductory deal of $7.99. Well worth the price. Would be better on a winter night. One bottle is enough for the night.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Belgian Dark Strong Ale,94

22,30,TheCondor,4.62,"Side poured from a bottle into a Chimay chalice with standard vigor.  Appearance - Cool packaging, with the dragon and all on the front. Plus, I think my country ass interprets the name as ""Three Pistols"" in French, which of course is cool. Anyway, pours a deep dark brown, possibly a black, that is not at all transparent. Although the head is small, it leaves wicked lacing throughout the drink and stays with the beer for the entire glass.  Smell - Are you kidding me? I smelled this thing and identified it as a Belgian Strong Dark while I was pouring it, the smell was so stout. The first thing I thought was ""wow that smells like Chimay Blue."" Dark fruits, some malts, and spicy yeasts are the main smells. Outstanding, could not be improved on.  Taste - I damn near gave this a 5. The dark fruits assault the palate first, with the malts and spices offering a nice counterpunch to the plums, raisins, black cherries, and more.  Mouthfeel - Creamy, rich, a stout spicy zing at the end with the alcohol to remind you that this is not a beginners beer. I really enjoyed this beer.  Overall - Excellent job. This beer belongs even higher than the #7 or whatever spot it occupies on the Belgian Strong Dark Ale top 100 list. It rivals Chimay, but falls just a hair short of that. I was rooting through my beer fridge wanting something dark to sip on, and I found a doozy in this beer. Very well put together.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Belgian Dark Strong Ale,94

Significant but not gigantic quantities of sediment at the bottom turn it somewhat cloudy. Lots of slow active carbonation. Smell is fruity. I think I smell a lot of dates with a little plum and cherry.  Taste is mild but complex. Maybe ""soft-spoken"" is better than ""mild"". There's lots of interesting fruit flavor and a little spice, a little yeast, but it's not too sweet and it doesn't taste boozy at all. Maybe the slightest hint of alcohol in the flavor.

22,30,jrenihan,4.17,"Bottled May 25, 2011.  It has taken me awhile to get around to reviewing this one.  Beer is a very dark ruby red, almost brown. Moderately-sized off-white head. Head fades fairly quickly, but not completely. A film stays.  Smell is full of the classic Unibroue yeast. Malty with rich dark fruit notes- cherry, raisin, plum. Good smell.  Taste is also typical Unibroue (which is not a bad thing). The yeast flavour is there, along with lots of dark fruit. Cherry, raisin, grape, plum. Some spice. Tastes a bit of candy, but not nearly as much as some other BSDAs. Good.  Full bodied, but lighter than expected or preferred. Perhaps due to the very low carbonation level, at least in this bottle. Feels a bit dead.  Overall, a very good beer. I prefer this one to Maudite, personally.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Belgian Dark Strong Ale,94
22,30,TheRealBigC,4.35,"Having not been particularly in love with some of the other beers from Unibroue which I've tried (particularly Maudite - just not for me), I found Trois Pistoles to be a rather delicious offering that has renewed my interest in the brewery. All of the great things I've heard about Unibroue make more sense now that I've tried this one. It's complex and remarkably tasty. The cherry notes are my particular favorite part.

S:  Sweet grapes, belgian spicy yeast, candied malts, chocolate covered cherries and sweet prunes.   T/M:  Zesty and spicy carbonation in a medium-full mouthfeel. Big spicy cherry bourbon flavors surround the palate. Candy malt sweetness, musky yeast, rye bread, dark fruits, burnt brown sugar and a touch of cinnamon.  Finishes dry and clean with a spicy alcohol sting in the back of the throat.  Once warned charred grass, rum soaked currants and plums. The alcohol is apparent but subtle and delicate with loads of fresh sweet grapes.  O:  Super spicy but delicately sweet. I recently reviewed Muadite and I'm having trouble picking my favorite. This delivers more raw spice and boozy flavors and not as much candy sweetness. The raw character creates a complex yet balanced brew. I will have to do a blind side by side tasting of these two.

Smell - Much like all Unibroue brews I've had, there's a definite heavy cream aroma, this one upfront, followed by notes of over-ripened banana  Taste - Sweet and creamy to start, with subtle hints of coconut and banana a touch of caramel on the back end. A sudden burst of dark, sugary fig. finishes very quickly.  Mouthfeel - Moderate to full body. Good carbonation. Really creamy mouthfeel, though I'm not quite sure it works as well with this beer as it does the others.  Overall - Good, but really not all that dark. Certainly not as dark as the advert would have one believe. A lot more on the sweet and creamy side.

Mostly clear with a minor haze from the yeast.  Smell: Sweet. Candi sugar, caramel malts, and even some caramel candy sweetness as well. Unibroue yeast strain comes through, but it's tempered by the sweetness. Dark fruit, cherries, figs, and plums. A beefier Belgian dubbel. some clove and banana.  Taste: Opening fruitiness is ripe cherry with some darker plum. Candi sugar in quantity. Yeast is chewy and loaded with apple, banana, and clove. Malty sweetness is mildly roasted and pushes hard on the sugars. Some caramel with some brown sugar leanings. As it warms the yeast takes over. Sweet. Lingering spiciness.  Mouthfeel: Smooth with a medium body and high side of moderate carbonation. Yeast dries it all out.  Overall: The best application of Unibroue house yeast. Incredibly sweet.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Belgian Dark Strong Ale,94
22,30,DannyDan,4.4,"A. Pours out a dark mahogany hue with a thick tan head that quickly disappears leaving some retention, moderate carbonation and sparse lacing. S. The aroma consists of raisins, cherries, prunes, dark chocolate. T. The taste starts out with some raisins, followed by some prunes, molasses, and finishes off with some cherries and hints of chocolate. Some bread (i'm thinking wheat) is present throughout taste and some alcohol, even though it does not taste like 9% ABV. M. A soft, but dry feel. The beer tend to melt in your mouth, it would be like how beer in Heaven would be like. O. A very yummy beer that is very well made and i'll be adding it to my regular rotation of beers.

22,30,phiberoptik,4.17,"Pours a deep maple brown with a burgundy hue and a bubbly off white head that dissipates quickly into just a cloudy layer on the top. The slightest agitation in the glass brings the bubbles back.  Notes of fig, dark fruits, faint molasses, and a nice alcohol heat.  Tastes of dark dried fruits, sweet maltiness, brown bread, winter spices, and a nice warmth in the throat.  Medium to full bodied, nice tongue coating effect with subtle bubbling in the mouth.  This is a warmer beer. One to be best had when you need a little inner warming. Definitely an enjoyable brew as many of the Unibroue beers are.

Some dried fruit and rising bread notes as well.  T- Rich malty goodness. Mild sweetness, dates and cloves. Slightly dry finish.  M- Medium body with smooth and full carbonation.  O- Rich and tasty, another winner from Unibroue. Easily beats many examples of this style that are priced at twice what I paid for this. It paired very well with some Pad Thai. The lime and tamarind balanced the malty sweetness nicely.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Belgian Dark Strong Ale,94

22,30,RppIII,5,"Appearance: This beer was purchased in the winter of 2009 and consumed in the summer of 2012. Poured from a 355 mL bottle with an expiration date of 02/10/12 into a chalice. Pours a dull fig color of brown. There is a fingers worth of creamy, evenly dispersed tan head. A very enticing appearance leaves one eager to explore its matte brown exterior further.  Smell: The smell is the essence of Christmas on a farm. It has a beautiful combination of liquored sweet fruit, molasses, a fresh essence of farm (grassy and floral), and a hint of spicy dark chocolate fondue.  Taste: Chewy, medicinal, very alcoholic tiramisu brownie dipped in spiced chocolate fondue. Firstly, an alcoholic soaked cherry flavor lays foundations for the onslaught of spiced chocolate. Grassy hops are balanced perfectly against the chocolate, which eventually subsides to leave an ethereal spiced, alcoholic cherry flavor that sticks around for the long haul.  Mouthfeel: Dry, a bit chewy but smooth. The alcohol, while present as an essential part of any beer seems too much a part of this beer’s flavour to actually be measured as an entity outside of the taste itself.  Drinkability: This beer not only puts a smile on your face, it enlightens you and warms your heart. This beer makes me yearn for Thanksgiving and Christmas dinners, snow falling outside, and endless bottles being shared by the crackling fire. Perhaps this is where it was conceived or the first test batch enjoyed. For some, chicken soup, mac n cheese, and ice cream are comfort foods; this beer is my comfort food.

22,30,Danny1217,4.45,"Pours a beautiful dark reddish brown color with a small tan head that quickly disappears. Smells quite fruity with some spice to it. Can smell the yeast too. Cherry flavor seems to dominate the taste. A bit of grape too, slightly reminiscent of a red wine. Also some plum, raisin, and caramel. Body is thick and carbonation is heavy. Some might say too heavy, but I found it to be a nice surprise. A good dark Belgian ale that I could see myself buying regularly.

Smell: Feels little like red wine with an overdose of yeast. Light scents of  Taste: This is smooth meets complex, I taste the sweetness of raisins I love the malt and a notch spicy but lightly and by the way did I mention the complexity.  Mouth: Medium and smooth, sharp texture coming from the bubbles.  Overall: This beer isn't perfect but it is incredibly well rounded, so smooth you will appreciate the quality as it is.

A moderate pour yields a 2 finger head that sticks around for a while. The head retains as a nice disc of foam on top of the body. Lacing is fair.  S - Smells of dark fruits and that ever-so-characteristic unibroue yeast.  T - Follows the nose. Starts out with a chocolate/fig note with just a tad of sourness from the yeast and finishes dry but not bitter. I often times taste the alcohol and a metallic offtaste, but it is rare.

Nice alcohol legs.  S- A big spiciness and Belgian yeast. A lot of wheat and a slight fruity zest. A dark malt profile showcasing a strong dark fruit character.  T- A smooth caramel feel to it but the flavor is a ton of dark fruits. This beer carries a heavy wheat influence and that comes with a spicy zesty fruit flavor. Super complex and a lot of bold character to this one. Tastes close to a quad. This beer has a heavy dark fruit flavor like figs and Raisins and prunes and it comes with a burnt sugar taste and feel. Its complemented perfectly by the light and zesty wheat flavor. Superb.  M- This is a big beer but not that hard to drink. It has high carbonation and a moderate aftertaste, its spicy and slightly bitter and that helps keep the palate fresh and ready for more.

22,30,Darkmagus82,4.14,"Served in a 10 oz chalice glass  Appearance – Served a dark brownish brew with a reddish tint. Upon serving there was a light white head that faded rapidly to give a medium level of lacing.  Smell – The aroma is heavy of dark fruits with notes of roasted malt and brown bread. It is mixed with a light yeast, spice and chocolate aroma. It is quite nice.  Taste – The taste starts out as dark fruit and cocoa. It’s a nice dark chocolate covered cherry and raisin taste mixed with a brown bread flavor. As the taste advances the fruit and the bread remain but the chocolate begins to fade. In the middle some tastes of yeast and a light spice come to the tongue. From there a lighter caramel and toffee sweetness mix. All these flavors persist to the end where they are met with a lighter alcohol flavor that leaves a warming sweet taste on the tongue.  Mouthfeel – The body is on the creamier side with a medium level of carbonation. Both are quite fitting for the sweeter complex flavors of the brew. The body provides enough thickness to where it can really permeate the tongue while the carbonation suits the sweeter flavors well.  Overall – A very nice tasting Belgian dark.

22,30,MortarPestle,4.05,Appearance: Pours a hazy amber brown with a thin head and little lacing. Aroma: Hints of toasted chocolate and cherries wrapped in fresh cut hay.

22,30,matttttYCE,4.39,"Head rises to about 1.5 fingers and is foamy, tan hot chocolate froth colored. Head recedes but still maintains a thin covering and a decent ring. The beers color is deep, dark burgundy and nearly opaque.  Wonderful dark fruit notes abound with layers of roasted malts, cocoa, chocolate covered cherries, and toffee. Behind that are some notes of spice, cinnamon and nutmeg, light belgian yeast, maybe hint of clove, lovely hints of vanilla, and maybe the tiniest twinge of green apple. Lovely smelling brew.  The taste is pretty similar to the aroma. Complex dark fruit notes of dates, raisins, chocolate covered cherries, with cocoa, toffee, light vanilla notes, light notes of belgian yeast and green apple, and light notes of the spices aforementioned. Nice taste. Not quite exactly similar to the aroma but just as good as it.  Mouthfeel is nice. Carbonation is medium-high, consistency is medium-round, body is medium-full, and the finish is a bit lengthy but that's a good thing. Lingering notes of the dark fruits and hints of chocolate/cocoa.  Overall this is an awesome brew that I can't believe I've passed over as many times as I have. I finally got a bottle because I looked at it and saw something in the stores description that it ""rivaled a fine port"" and I just happened to be in the mood for something. I'm definitely going to buy this again, and likely will age some too.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Belgian Dark Strong Ale,94

S- Complex and hard to quantify...sweet notes of toffee, chocolate and molasses along with dark dried fruits (raisins, dates, cherries) in addition to (those familiar Belgian esters) of green apple, pear and clove all are present on the nose.  T- Like all Unibroue beers, very complex, very pungent and similar to the nose but even more...cherry/chocolate sweetness along with those dark fruits dominate followed by some citrus rind bitterness attacks the palate.  M- Despite the modest head, there is a healthy amount of carbonation with which dances on the palate allowing for a rather dry finish.  O- A bit more slick on the palate and rich in the flavor than Maudite, it is another homerun from Unibroue.

The yeast takes over by the end of each sip for a yeasty, slightly bitter followthrough that balances the initial sweetness. The alcohol warms a bit on the way down but is otherwise well hidden.

T: Sweet molasses biscuits, with dried dark fruits and a bitter hops after taste giving way to a dry coco flavour. The sweet start and mildly bitter after taste is masterfully balanced. Some hints of the alcohol, which only serve to add to the complexity.  M: Medium bodied with minimal carbonation. A few swirls will reveal the brews ability to hold onto the glass, like pancake syrup.  O: My drinking partner says Trois Pistoles is like love in a bottle. Sweet but not too sweet, with a playful dark side that doesn't overwhelm. A good body and a beautiful blonde head on its shoulders.

Very dark but a dark reddish brown color comes out around the edges in my snifter. Foamed out of the bottle a little when I popped it but after I poured some it settled down in the glass.  Smells of cough syrup or some sort of medicine with a whiff of sweet dark malts. BLAM!!! The taste is just off the hook. It's my first beer of the night and damn it is smooth on the taste buds. None of the strong liquor or bitterness of a stout. None of the fragrant hops of an IPA. It's just like putting on you favorite pair of pants. Just feels right. So tasty and not overpowering.

Based ton my experience I can say that This is the best brewery in Canada. If there is better, than they probably aren't distributing to the US (at least not the Northeast part). Every different offering by them rates from very good to great.  This beer fits in the great category.  Trois is a very drinkable dark ale.

22,30,oliverwren,4.68,"I'm drinking a Trois Pistoles as I write this. When some may consider this beer world class, they are absolutely correct.  A - Really nice and chocolate-esque. The opaque coloration implies a powerful brew, which prepares the drinker in such a way that taste itself sweetens. Only the lack of head (from a 12 oz. bottle, I admit) seemed to limit the quality of appearance. In their defense, however, I poured it in such a way as to minimize head.  Sm - Quite sweet. I would only criticize that the aroma does carry a hint of alcohol.  T - ABSOLUTELY BRILLIANT! Hops and pure alcohol balance each other incredibly (in this particular mouth), but the sweetness (sometimes almost creamy taste) definitely wins the aftertaste, which is fantastic.  M - A bit thin, I admit, but it seems textured in just such a way that the taste becomes more important. It does, however, showcase the quality of the water that went into the initial brew.  O - In my personal opinion, Odin serves Trois Pistoles in the Halls of Valhalla. I have tried some of the Belgian Strong Dark Ales that rate higher than this one, and they are all quality so far, but I have never had any brew anywhere that I would prefer to Unibroue's Trois Pistoles...including their own Maudite or La Fin du Monde.

22,30,deadonhisfeet,4.15,"Poured from a small bottle into my beautiful Rochefort chalice. Appearance is clear and dark brown with a thin head that dissipates quickly. The nose offers sweet fruit, primarily currants and cherries, and a tiny hint of alcohol.  The flavor is something of an enigma and is difficult for me to describe. It doesn't quite follow the nose because there's very little (if any) sweetness. The best I can say is that it is very wine-like, but without being tannic or acidic. Carbonation hits the front of my tongue quite aggressively and kills whatever sweetness there might be. As the flavor develops across my palate, the mouthfeel softens a bit and I get some dried fruit (raisins?) and ``grapey'' wine-like flavors. On the finish there is a slight nip of alcohol which lingers in my mouth along with the dried fruit.  Overall, an excellent beer that fans of abbey-style ales should be sure to try. It's not the most drinkable beer, nor is it the best tasting, but the flavor is so complex and unique that it demands respect. I can't wait to try it again.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Belgian Dark Strong Ale,94

S: Spicy, with a little banana and some alcohol. Lots of sweet yeast with some rich bread smells – like just risen bread dough, not baked bread. There’s some dried fruit smell here too.  T: The aroma really captures a lot of the taste of this beer. All the aromas are present, but the banana is more pronounced and so are the dried fruit. Raisins, dates, with maybe a little oak and a pretty strong alcohol taste. The oak/vanilla finish is a little like a nice bourbon.  M: Creamy, smooth, with a medium carbonation.  O: A great beer.

Reviewed live. Expectations are very high given its current ratings, the brewery, and its noted similarity to Trader Joe's Vintage - which I rather enjoyed.  Served refrigerator cold and allowed to warm over the course of consumption. Side-poured with standard vigor as no carbonation issues are anticipated.  A: Pours a three finger head of nice beige cream, good thickness, and good retention for the 9.00% ABV. Colour is a very dark amber. Semitransparent. Translucent. No yeast particles are visible.  Sm: Biscuity yeast, apple, pear, fruit zest, and cream. Spice. Raisins - to a degree - sort of vague. Clean malts. Apple is dominant.  T: Yeast, dominant crisp apple (rather tangible, actually), pear, clean unobtrusive malts, raisiny lees, and subtle spice. Some cream. A very light chocolate note (probably just from chocolate malt) is present. No alcohol comes through. Layering is present but not extensive. Slightly subtle. Complex enough. Not unique or special, but quite pleasant and enjoyable for what it is. Balanced and built pretty well.  Mf: Smooth, wet, a bit creamy, and nicely thick. Adequately carbonated. Stays out of the way. Suits the flavour profile nicely.  Dr: Very drinkable for the well hidden ABV. It would age decently. I wouldn't get it again, but I have little bad to say about it. Another success from Unibroue. A bit pricey, but acceptable for an import. Good but not great. A good example of the style. Not refreshing, but it comes about as close as a beer of this ABV can.

Small to moderate light brown head, which dissipates rather quickly leaving a thick layer around the rim, and spotty bubbles in the center of the glass. Lots of yeast at the bottom of the bottle.  Taste: Sweet and bitter dark grapes, black cherry, just a bit smokey ad roasty. There's that odd alcohol taste I got from the aroma. Hops are mild and floral. Malts are grainy, no pilsner or Munich malts are obvious here. Not much yeast.  Mouthfeel: Dry but not overly so. A bit like a port wine. Medium body. Not a lot of carbonation, but what is there is a bit tangy.  Overall: Truly unique, even for the broad category that it belongs to. The red/port wine flavor, lack of yeast, and unique alcohol flavor make this one different. Like most Belgian ales, best served around 50-55 degrees F.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Belgian Dark Strong Ale,94
22,30,kbkayla,3.95,"A- Dark dark brown, hint of red in the light. Pours a nice cm head. Has been in glass for 3 mins now and still has nice coat of white over top of beer.  S- Strong banana and candy sugar.  T- Candied sugar is really sticks out to me. Big coriander taste. Complex but lacks huge depth.  M- Carbonation dances on tongue. Overall nice balance between dryness/sweetness.  O- Gets better as it warms. A bit stronger on the coriander then I would like. Is this beer 9%?  I couldn't tell. I'd like to age one of these for about 3 years to see what would happen.

22,30,BeerKangaroo,4.1,"Thanx from bth86 for the beer trade that allowed me to acquire this:  First had in a pint glass, later had in a borrowed chalice:  A: mostly black body with a brown tinges around the sides and bottom of the chalice, all black in the pint glass, light tan colored head that starts off incredibly large and even as it settles the head still stays a decent size  S: sharp yet fermented raisin, some plum and banana, but really one has to continue smelling as the beer warms  T: centered around the raisins again, the plum and banana become subdued in the taste but chocolate comes out as the beer warms  M: heavy, not sessionable, low amount of carbonation felt on the tongue, smooth and thick alcohol slightly felt, slightly dry aftertaste  O: I'm mostly impressed with this one, big wow, will come back to this again",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Belgian Dark Strong Ale,94
22,30,mactrail,4.23,"A remarkable amount of flavor. A showcase for that seemingly patented Unibroue yeasty, fruity, and bitter flavor.  Attractive reddish dark amber with foam galore. Makes a nice appearance in the Stella Artois chalice. Lacing is lovely. Coriander and cinnamon are the flavors that come to me. The alcohol is not at all obvious. Mouthfeel is so creamy with all of the suds. Burnt sugar and dried apricots. Raisins come to mind, but it's not so full of dark fruit as others in the style.  This stuff is kind of an acquired taste, but it's so interesting and complex it's worth trying. The four-pack of 12 oz bottles is great for getting people to taste and compare a few of their beers.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Belgian Dark Strong Ale,94
22,30,LiquidAmber,4.3,"Review from 1/2011 notes. Side by side tasting of a fresh 2011 bottle and a properly cellared two year old bottle. 2011: Poured into a Gulden Draak tulip. Pours a dark reddish brown. Moderate head with lots of lacing. Sweet malt, light and dark fruit and Unibroue Belgian spicing in the aroma. Sweet malt, some dark fruit, strong Unibroue spicing / yeast. Good mouth feel with some creaminess. A very nice dark Belgian style ale. 2009: Poured into a Nostradamus flute glass. Pours a dark reddish brown. Foamed out of the bottle, A huge half glass light tan head and massive lacing. Sweet and caramel malt, some dark fruits and mild spicing. Much mellower than the fresh bottle, spiciness much lower. Creamy and well integrated, a very tasty, mellow sweet malt and dark fruit ale. This has definitely improved with age. Two year old cellar aged bottle. Main scoring for the fresh bottle; 2009: 4/4/5/4.5/4.5 reflecting the mellow aged flavor and higher creaminess developed over the aging.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Belgian Dark Strong Ale,94
22,30,bryehn,4.32,"Pours a mostly opaque black with crimson tinges when held up to light. The light tan coloured head is of ample size and stays around as a collar while leaving spotty lace.  Sharp, fermented fruits like apple and grape stick out in the aroma, accented by plum, banana and chocolate. Smooth, yet quite complex.  Tastes of dark, ripened fruits and has a nice sour character. Plum, apple and grape are joined by a peppery and cinnamon-like spiciness. Solid, but unassuming malt backbone with a slight chocolate note.  Full-bodied with a low carbonation, but has a yeasty, fizzy pop on the tongue. Very much like a wine after that, it’s smooth, thick and rich throughout the finish and the aftertaste is dry and slightly sour.  An amazing, world class ale at a great price. Pairs well with salty and fried foods, red pasta sauce, sharp cheeses and wheat-based crackers.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Belgian Dark Strong Ale,94

T: Powerful sweet malt at first, then sour cherries. A hint of smoked pepper. A piney hops finish is medium-bitter, but not overpowering, and a little sweetness finds its way into the finish as well.  M: Richly carbonated, and dry. Just dry enough to make you want to take another sip, bordering on astringent. The alcohol is perceptible, but not powerful.  O: Quite tasty, an excellent and full-flavored example of the style. Definitely worth trying, and trying again.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Belgian Dark Strong Ale,94
22,30,KuehneBe,4.83,"Poured from a bomber into a snifter.  Appearance Quite black with an appealing red hue when held up into the light. It almost like a very, very dark wine.  + Bonus points for the fantastic label and packaging in general.  Smell Lots of dark fruit, dates, and raisins. Cherries and plums, possibly? Sweet molasses that is just right, and makes you excited to take the first sip.  Taste Incredible! Licorice. Again, lots of dark fruit and molasses. The alcohol is well hidden and serves to add some well-desired ""bite.""  Mouthfeel Just the right amount of carbonation, almost a bit more than expected. Extremely pleasant mouthfeel. The flavors stick around for a nice amount of time without being sirupy or sticky.  Overall If all Belgian Strong Dark Ales are comparable to this one, I really have to look further into this style. This is a beer that is quite close to being perfect. Definitely one of my new favorites.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Belgian Dark Strong Ale,94

Flavor is sweet as well with black cherry savories. Light fruity, ester tones. Hops are subdued and attempt at balancing with an earthy undertone. Alcohol is there but is kept well in check. Sweetness maintains til the end.  Medium body with a sharp carbonation. Finish is not too dry or wet. Good texture allows the flavors to linger on the tongue.  Great beer! Complex and delicious!",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Belgian Dark Strong Ale,94
22,30,MattSweatshirt,4.12,"750 ml bottle best before sometime in 2013. I tossed the bottle after glancing at the date. Thumbs up for a clearly printed best before date. Poured into a Trappist chalice glass.  Deep dark yet see through(gets a lot murkier the further down the bottle you get) ruby red/brown when up to the light otherwise it is black. Thin beige head that fizzles down even smaller rather quickly.  Smells of cherries, dark fruits, sweet caramel, spice, some alcohol and funk. The fruity cherry element seems to pop out a lot more.  First off the alcohol is well hidden and when it rears its head when warmed up goes along with the flavor so good. Cherry and dark fruit for the most part. Slightly sweet and chocolatey. Great little bready character in the aftertaste.  There is not much of a head on this thing yet you can still feel a good amount of carbonation on the tongue. Lighter body on this compared to other dark Belgian brews. Dry.  Such an easy drinker. Wow. The drinkability is insane on this. The subtle complexity of this beer makes it so good.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Belgian Dark Strong Ale,94
22,30,Bockrules,4,"poured from the bottle into snifter  A - Pours a rich a golden-brown with a frothy, off-white head. Head fizzles down to nothing quickly. Leaves behind only a small ring of bubbles.  S - Not much coming out of the bottle except some candied sugar. I poured some into an oversized wine glass to accentuate the aroma and got a nice amount of dark fruit and licorice.  T - A bit of licorice upfront. The body is surprisingly mellow given the ABV with plum,fig, and date flavors mingling with sugar cane and caramel malt. A bit of alcohol finally comes through as the beer passes over the back of the tonge. Dark plum and port wine finish.  M - On the lighter side of medium bodied with plenty of carbonation. The beer seems to expand and decrease in density the instant it hits the tongue.  Despite the lackluster head retention by any beers standards (let alone a Belgian Strong), and weak nose, Trois Pistoles is an excellent beer. The mouthfeel is amazingly delicate despite having 9% ABV. Although this ale is a little less complex than I was hoping for (perhaps my expectations are too high), it is nonetheless delicious and highly drinkable. Will definitely purchase again at world market.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Belgian Dark Strong Ale,94
22,30,grannaniwa,3.73,"Pours a nice deep brown (no reddish tint). Thin head dissipates quickly. Initial nose is full of fruit aromas and some yeast. There is also a hint of something acrid, like rubber.  Yeast dominates the first taste, from entry to aftertaste. Fruity sweetness is present throughout. High carbonation, like all of the Unibroues. Yeast becomes less prominent as you work your way through the bottle.  Overall: A-/B+",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Belgian Dark Strong Ale,94

Almost no sticky lacing to be had at first, but developed a little as the glass warmed. Faint grassy aroma with a sickly tan head. Nice foreboding cloudy appearance. Very unique.  - Smooth beginning flavor that quickly passes to a warming finish. Alcohol is present but by no means over powering. Not bitter at all, and very balanced.  - The bottle mentions it having a subtle lingering aftertaste like an old port wine, and I'm not one to disagree. As much as I love the finish, I wish the initial flavor stuck around longer. It's almost a flash in the pan in the overall experience.  - I've 3 other bottles of this in my possession and will hold onto them for a while to see what changes.

S - Windfall apples, straw, loam/not-smokey-peat. Very pleasant and intriguing.  T - Different than what I expected from the smell. I'm still tasting the windfall apples, some candied dates, molasses, some grassy hop tang and oak barrel. Starts off fairly dry and stays that way. Finishes with a spicy blend of date and molasses. Only mildly boozy, which did not deter from the beer.  M - Medium body and light carbonation. Creamy.  O - A very finely balanced brew with a pleasing smell and flavor.

Nose presents with a faceload of yeast first that is then complemented by dark fruit. Plenty of plum and some fig as well as clove. Slight cocoa and cola and I also get some cherry.  Taste presents similar to the nose but with much more forward cherry that gives a sweet balance to the yeast character. Cola is present on the back of my tongue and the spice character comes in just before the dry finish that features a lingering bready yeastiness.  Highly crisp carbonation that belies a smooth medium body.  Overall, quite impressed with this one. Great that the four pack unibroue tasters are going for 8 bucks...get some.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Belgian Dark Strong Ale,94

Taste - Sweetness of the dark fruits comes through initially, along with a flavour that reminds me of being oaked. A touch of spiciness and very slightly bitter in the finish.  Mouthfeel - Medium bodied with medium carbonation. Smooth quality with a pleasant dry finish.  Overall - A good Belgian strong dark ale from Unibroue. The dark fruit flavours are quite enjoyable, as well as the oaked quality to it. Definitely worth a try!",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Belgian Dark Strong Ale,94
22,30,BarryMFBurton,4.02,"It’s always beer-thirty on a Sunday. Here’s another Unibroue beer for the checklist: Trois Pistoles. Every beer I’ve had from them has been loveable, so here’s hoping for another great experience.  A: Thick, molasses brown, and wonderfully opaque. Looks like cola syrup, but lighter and less oily. A fizzy beige head sits about an inch high, then smoothes out to a paper-thin film with creamy, raised edges. Not a shining color on the body – looks earthy.  S: Starts smooth and fruity, a Belgian character that runneth over with pear, raisin, apple, and banana. Light citrus and clove swing in to diversify the nose, along with a sweet vinous grape aroma. Esters and alcohol are apparent but mild, simply adding more depth to this smooth-smelling brew.  T: Bold, viscous flavors! The malts form a rich, buttery profile of fruit pastries – apple pie, cherry tart, and just plain ol’ toast with grape jam – with a hint of straw alongside. It’s sweet, drinkable, and inviting, even as it makes its smooth transition to the more earthy tastes of the yeasts: bready spice, clove, coriander, a touch of baking chocolate, cinnamon bread, and dry red wine notes come out, it seems, in one moderately-intense taste. Finishes with smooth plum and raisin, Belgian candi sugars, and cherry cola. Tasty, complex, and easy-drinking.  M: This beer has a damn good body: it’s mostly thick, showcasing viscosity as the main player. There are, however, superb feelings of fizz on this beer’s back end; it gives it a profile like champagne, at times. Great character for this kind of beer – I’d say its feel is one of my favorite parts of the experience.  O: Trois Pistoles starts strong, hooking you with the savory power of its rich malt profile and mouthfeel. After a while, though, the novelty starts to wear off and it’s not as satisfying (though it’s a good drink the whole time). Another Unibroue win.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Belgian Dark Strong Ale,94

Head fizzles down to an 1/8"" and remains until the end of the glass.  S: Initial smell of bready yeast. Grassy hops, cherries, raisins. Notes of alcohol.  T: Taste of belgian yeast followed by sweet dark fruits, hints of orange. Slight oaky taste, roasted malts make up the backbone. Hints of a dry grape.  M: For how dark this beer is its fairly light on the palette. Lots of carbonation, minimal sticky resins on the tongue.  Overall a very good beer. Nothing astounding or new about it, other beers from the brewery are more enjoyable.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Belgian Dark Strong Ale,94
22,30,legalpete19340,4.3,"A: Poured a dark caramel brown with a big fizzy head that took forever to fall. Minimal coverage and lacing. Something about the appearance is disappointing even though it looks right.  S: Kind of mild with a pleasant grassy character. Mild hints of sweetness like prunes and dried apricots with a biscuit background.  T: Strong caramel malt with more herbal and grassy flavors supporting. The sweetness comes out to me with more dried fruit. The middle is definitely grainy but then almost has a spicy character with black pepper. The end is very dry with a smoothness.  M: Much thinner than I expected and very fizzy on the tongue.  O: Very good. Solid and interesting. The malt character was very pleasant. I dont know if a Belgian Strong Ale is done much better.

Tasting this beer, the front is a very complex Belgian yeast, and figs. The middle talks of dark fruits like plum and raisin. The beer just keeps building up the aroma.

22,30,cmq103,4.47,"Poured from a 12-oz. bottle into a Duvel Belgian Tulip glass. I picked up a six pack of this, along with a six pack of Maudite and La Fin de Monde with my Christmas gift certificate. I can’t imagine a better present, for a beer lover, than a gift certificate to The Beer Store in Southampton PA. I had $150 card to spend and don’t you know I still went $30 over that, filling my car trunk with ease. Now that’s a gift that keeps on giving.  Appearance: Initial soda-like carbonation, which is clearly heard during and after my semi-aggressive pour. The slightly off-white head was a generous two fingers in height at first, reducing to a thin semi-bubbly ring. Light lacing is present when my glass is tilted. The color was unique, sort of a combination of a cloudy dark brown and purple blended together.  Smell: Dark fruits, spices, rummy and sweet. Malts are present but take a back seat to the apple-like fruity esters. Unfiltered apple cider comes to mind with a refreshing hint of boozy warmth. I catch some Belgian yeast in the nose too. There is a light alcohol sting, followed by a wonderful blend of dark fruits, grapes, (almost port wine-like to be exact). The flavors are complex and exciting at the same time. There’s a lot going on with each and every sip. It simply attacks the palate from all directions. A sour blend of Belgian yeast in the background, finishing with a somewhat of a peppery spice and kiss of cherry.  Mouthfeel: A light to medium body beer with lively carbonation, which in my opinion, really brings out all of the flavors on the tongue. Alcohol is present, but not overwhelming, and very well hidden for a 9% beer. Carbonation decreases as the beer warms.  Overall: I love everything about this beer from the initial pour to the very last sip. I would be remiss if I didn’t mention how cool looking the label was too. A ""session beer"" this is not. If you’re looking to try something different and enjoy the dark Belgian style and want lots of flavor, then this is a “must try”. I will definitely buy this again. Heck, this is so good I’m going to commit to a 1/6th keg for the dual-tap kegerator @ my basement bar. Unibroue makes some tasty beers.

Very strong aroma.  T - Flavor starts with less sour notes than the aroma would lead on, but present and certainly not overpowering. The deep rich smooth fruit characteristics emerge, cherry and peach. The beer continues to meelos to slight hints of chocolate. Very powerful though not too warm. Really quite a pleasant surprise.

Some alcohol is perceived next along with some nutmeg like spiciness. This all leads into a dry, but fruity, finish.  Mouthfeel. Not a particularly thick body, but tons of carbonation to just coat the palate.  It has been a year or so since I last had this beer, and it really holds up to the pressures of a developing palate.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Belgian Dark Strong Ale,94
22,30,BEERMILER12,4.42,"Best by: 08-11-14 so bottled 08-11-11 at 11:25 am (code is H11125Q)  A: Pours a nice ruby red with a slight haze from the yeast. Has a nice 2 fingers worth of head that has nice retention  S: Spices, malts, fruits, and some chocolate. Maybe a twinge of alcohol  T: Same as the smell. Starts with the spices and dark fruits and then moves to roasty malts and chocolate, plus a little alcohol for good measure  M: Nice and full bodied with moderate carbonation. Great for these cold winter months because of the full, warming nature  O: A solid example of a BSDA, and one that is perfect for this time of the year. I'd love to try this aged some time",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Belgian Dark Strong Ale,94
22,30,ckollias,4.5,Enjoyed this 12oz bottle out of a large snifter glass.  A: Pours a dark brown almost black hue with a beige 2-finger head that quickly dissipates into a wispy lace.  S: Very sweet aroma with a heavy dose of dark fruits.  T: Similar to the smell this is a slightly sweet fruit dominated by dark fruits. There are hints of chocolate and toasted malts in the background. Alcohol is present but masked very nicely.  M: Very strong and boozy. Medium body and medium carbonation.  O: Awesome Strong Belgian ale. Nicely balanced and enough alcohol to make it interesting. Unibroue always has good brews.,Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Belgian Dark Strong Ale,94
22,30,projectflam86,4,"750ml bottle poured into a chalice.  A- Pours a slightly murky brown color with a thick white foam head that fades away to a thin ring. Leaves decent lacing.  S- Trois Pistoles has that signature Unibroue yeast aroma with some spices and bananas. Aside from that, some dark fruits and tobacco is noticeable.  T- Belgian yeast and spices with loads of fruit and sweetness. Lots of flavor complexity throughout with very little alcohol. Prunes, dates, raisins, banana, coriander, caramel, red wine, and white pepper all show themselves as it warms.  M- Medium bodied with spritzy carbonation. A little thin for a big BSDA but still nice.  O- A very solid brew and quite affordable.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Belgian Dark Strong Ale,94
22,30,imagoodboy1769,2.36,"Like most ppl, picked this up on a corked bottle.  A-great appearance, nice and dark. Head was nice and full on initial pour, but dissipated in about 5 mins, little lacing.  S-the smell was quite stronge. Very fruity with esters of cloves, cinnamon, and anise. If I didn't know better (and I might not), I think they use a heffiwizen yeast for this.  T-tastes just like it smells. Unfortunately, I do not like the way this tastes. I couldn't even come close to finishing it. The hops and even the malt seemed to be overpowered by the spice and fruit tastes. I cringed each sip.  Mouthfeel-great mouthfeel though. Smooth, full bodied. A little lighter than I was expecting for a whopping 9%, but the best part of this beer.  Overall, I hated it. And at $8 a bottle, I hated it even more. It might be great for some, but it is by far one of my least favorite beers. If I were at a party and there were only two beers (trois pistoles and PBR), I'd take the PBR.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Belgian Dark Strong Ale,94
22,30,tbern007,4.32,"Pours a caramel, hazy brown with some orange around the edges; initially a large head but it quickly disipates and there is little lacing. Scent is yeast, cherries, a bit of spice, grass. Dry, yeast/bread like, sweet cherries, a little sweet chocolate, caramel/malt, the hops make a grassy presence but are not overpowering. There is some spice there, and the alcohol provides a nice warmth. Pretty good flavors. Crisp and refreshing.

22,30,unclejazz,3.58,"Best by date was 8/17/13.  It poured nicely, but had a bit horse of horse blanket on top of dates and roasted malt. Taste was also a bit dank for me, but the mouthfeel was crisp and pleasant, which makes this more drinkable. It is a bit on the sweet end for me, and would not make a good session beer. A decent strong ale for the 410 four pack price, but I would not go out of my way to pick this up.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Belgian Dark Strong Ale,94
22,30,duckrabbitfan,4.47,"dark brown/red, a little sediment... some lacing.  cloves/dates very evident in the smell, plums, too, a bit of caramel. yum, says my nose.  very balanced and mellow, alcohol is slightly present but only slightly so, and it adds to the taste. more of the date/plum aspect from the smell.  fairly carbonated but smooth; just a touch of darkness makes it very enticing.  this is a favorite of mine and i'm thankful one of my two favorite watering holes has a constant supply of bottles.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Belgian Dark Strong Ale,94
22,30,Converge,4.35,"341ml bottle poured into a 16oz tulip.  A - Well, first off, this is the first Unibroue beer I've had in a while that didn't erupt in a violent gush of foam and lost beer upon opening, so a damn good start! Thick and bubbly head of light tan foam. The beer is a deep, dark body of mahogany and purple hues. Almost like the label art, but much darker. The head settles to a thin film that leaves spots of lacing here and there.  S - Tons of yeast upfront, which sort of surprised me. Dark fruits are present, but light. Not much roasted malt, chocolate, or dark aromas at all. More-so a light smell with yeast, bready malt and a slight hint of black cherries. Overall, very sweet, and quite intriguing. I somehow get the feeling I'm about to experience a totally unexpected flavor based on the aroma...  T - Lots of dark fruitiness, with yeast and bready malt. Really deep and rich, with black cherries, figs, molasses, plums and Belgian spices in the finish. The yeast character here still shines nicely through the dark flavors, which compliment one another well. Finishes with sweet candi sugar, light spices, and slight alcohol warmth. There's also some light chocolate malt that linger unmistakably in the finish. Overall, this flavor profile boasts a somewhat unique feel with a thoroughly drinkable taste.  M - Medium bodied feel, that definitely has some chew to it. Smooth carbonation, that gives the beer a nice drinkable quality here. The spice lingers in the finish, but doesn't overwhelm. A touch below Maudite, but still very good.  D - A sweet, dark, and fruity BSDA with a fair amount of complexities in the flavor profile. A tasty mixture of dark malt, dark fruits, and yeasty goodness makes this a deceptively easy beer to drink. Despite the big flavor and high ABV this ale is remarkably easy to drink. Overall, this is probably a touch above Maudite.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Belgian Dark Strong Ale,94
22,30,StJamesGate,4.19,"Leathery brown body with loose off white head. Chocolate, sweet cherry tobacco, clovey yeast, plum and pepper – a deep, floral nose. Cocoa, ginger cake, some date, a chocolate cherry hit and a peppery hop end. Christmas spice end and tingly linger. Medium, chewy, lively, some burn.  Sweet and brightly fruity BSDA. Very balanced and quaffable. Unibroue rules.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Belgian Dark Strong Ale,94
22,30,TrappistJohnMD,4.35,Very dark with light tan head. Good lacing down sides of glass.  Smell is of very ripe fruit including plums and banana.  Taste is sweet with lots of fruit and cinnamon. Very little bitterness.  Good carbonation. Very smooth and medium bodied.  Overall this is very nice. Easy to drink. Will definitely buy again.,Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Belgian Dark Strong Ale,94
22,30,Popp24,4.47,A - Very dark brown and very nice tan head that stays throughout the beer. The lacing coats the glass.  S - Very subtle but I get sweetness and breadiness. Not an overpowering smell.  T - Nice sweet breadiness and you get some carbonation and then a bit of tart flavor with an aftertaste of alcohol.  M - Creamy and very easy to drink. Smooth.  O - This is a great beer that is mmm.,Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Belgian Dark Strong Ale,94
22,30,tdm168,4.2,"Pours a deep amber bordering on dark brown that has a mountain of off white, dense head that has great retention. The nose has faint spice notes with fruity aromas including apples and dark fruit. The flavor reminds me of apple pie; delicious baked apples, mild spices, doughy malt. There are some alcohol esters and warmth throughout. It's medium bodied and very smooth with a good amount of carbonation.  This is a pretty good, drinkable Belgian. The alcohol is noticeable, but it doesn't really detract from the overall drinkability. This truly does drink like dessert with almost perfect apple pie like flavors. I would get this again.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Belgian Dark Strong Ale,94
22,30,superspak,4.3,"750 ml bottle into globe glass, best by 11/18/2013. Pours clear dark reddish brown color with a fairly dense 2 finger khaki head with good retention that reduces to a nice lacing cap that lasts. Some spotty lacing on the glass as well. Aromas of big raisin, molasses, fig, chocolate, caramel, tart cherry, and spicy yeast. Very nice aromas with good strength and complexity. Taste of big raisin, chocolate, fig, prune, molasses, caramel, tart roasted grain, and yeast spiciness. Lingering notes of raisin, prune, chocolate, caramel, molasses, and spicy yeast on the finish. Medium carbonation and medium-full bodied; with a fairly creamy, smooth, and lightly prickly mouthfeel. Alcohol presence is basically non-existent for being 9%; with only a slight warming on the finish. Overall this is an outstanding and highly enjoyable Belgian strong dark ale. Tons of fruitiness and complexity; with easy drinkability.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Belgian Dark Strong Ale,94

22,30,jtierney89,4,"Pours a very deep and hazy brown with a big off white head. Big dark cherry nose with other dark fruits, grassy hops and bready malts. Big and boozey smelling.  Taste has a big dark fruit presence up front with an alcohol soaked cherry presence somewhere in the middle. Finishes with a mild tartness that like the bottle says, does finish like a port. Aftertaste lingers but in a very nice way.  Alcohol presence becomes more apparent as the beer warms as well as some phenolic spice on the back end. Surprisingly crisp carbonation for such a strong beer.  In comparison to maudite id have to prefer maudite. Not that this beers bad in anyway at all, I just prefer maudite, the flavors in this are more all over the place and layered then they are in maudite.  Both great beers though",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Belgian Dark Strong Ale,94
22,30,phantomwyse,3.9,"A: Pours out a deep mahogany red hue with dark caramel highlights on the fringes. Billowy two finger head that rises quickly and then fades to an off-beige crown.  S: Dark fruits--figs, red apple, plums, cherries, and then sweet and malty with ginger and molasses cookies.  T: Taste profile is very similar to aroma -- dates, plums, cherries, cola syrup, molasses cookies. The end finishes with an alcoholic twist, that, like the label says, is port wine -- or rather, pineau des charentes.  M: Light bodied and crisp. Starts to finish dry, but there is a lingering slickness.  O: A fantastic late fall-winter beer. Like all Unibroue, intriguing but easy drinking -- always a dangerous combination.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Belgian Dark Strong Ale,94
22,30,BilbosNuts,3.42,"Poured from a 12oz bottle into a tulip glass.  A: Pours a dark garnet color that looks like it has some purple or violet in it too. It has a thin, light brown colored head that fades to a thin ring very quickly. It is somewhat cloudy, but bits of light come through here and there.  S: Dark fruits (prunes and dates) and belgian yeast are the main players. Some alcoholic spiciness, dark malts, and belgian sugars come through as well. There are also some noticeable phenolic aromas, creating a slight medicinal smell.  T: Very similar to the aroma with strong dark fruits consisting of plums and dates. I'm getting more of the medicinal phenols in the taste than in the aroma, which I don't really care for. I'd like to see more dark malts and spiciness come through, but they take a back seat here.  M: It is medium bodied with a carbonation level that is on the high end. For the high ABV, the alcohol is barely noticeable, which makes it quite drinkable.  O: I really enjoy Unibroue's offerings, but this one seemed a bit off. I wasn't a fan of the big medicinal and phenol attributes. With some cleaning up, this could be a great beer. As is though, it is just an average BSDA.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Belgian Dark Strong Ale,94
22,30,DavidST,4.03,"Poured from a 22 oz bottle into a tulip, best before 5-26-14. This pours a nice dark brown color, almost black with a massive light tan head. The smell is of rich malts, lots of dark ripe fruits. Feel is medium to light with very high carbonation. The taste is of the same, lots of sweet dark fruit, a little alcohol taste is obvious, this would probably be better with a little age.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Belgian Dark Strong Ale,94
22,30,FosterJM,4.2,"978th Review on BA Bottle to Goblet 12 oz  Best before 8/11/14 Purchased a single bottle from Total Wine, Brea, CA  App- The rich mixed browns of a mahogany stain in a glass. A bit lighter towards the bottom allowing more light to shine through. A good 1-1/2"" finger head starts and falls to a perfect layer of off white pond cover. No cling or lace on this.  Smell- The yeast strain that Unibroue uses is one of my favorites. Assertive, dominant, fuzzy and bubbly. Add the spices of the brew and it creates a very good aromtic blend which in turn is one of the better in the style.  Taste- The blend for Unibroue must be hard to resist straight from the fermenter. This beer is a sneaky little thing at 9% with a delicate balance of spice, yeast and a very small small bitter note. The spices are not overbearing in anyway for me, but I could see how some with think a large 750 of this would be too much.  Mouth- A bubbly and fizzy medium body with a lot of residual spice and a little bit of dark fruits, pressed cherry skins and a little plum. The carbonation is pretty spot on. Could dial it down just a notch.  Drink- I've had many a Unibroue beer and I can say I like their dark offerings better. The balance of malts, fruit, yeast and bitter is one of my favorites. I'll always come back to Unibroue.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Belgian Dark Strong Ale,94
22,30,Tearik,2.85,"This beer was a disappointment to me for a variety of reasons. I really love the Unibroue brewery and every other beer I've had from them thus far, so its safe to say I was pumped up to try Trois Pistoles when it found its way into our beer store.  It poured great, a dark red/brown color and headed up wonderfully.  The smell was very sweet and extremely fruity.  However, once I tasted it my excitement ended. In my opinion this tastes like an overspiced christmas ale. The spices absolutely cover the taste of the beer. One of the few beers I've been unable to finish.  It was very thick in the mouth and in combination with the taste, was very un-enjoyable.  Overall, I'm sure this beer will have a following, but I am afraid that I will not be counted in it.

The back comes in with a huge, almost cloying, spicy prune. Big big spice and maple syrup.  Thick mouth feel but luckily the carbonation pushes it down quick enough.  Overall a great beer.

Dark sweet fruit on nose, sweet and malty.  Typical trois taste [wish i would have described it more, i don't drink this beer often] but mellower, more fruit, slight alcohol warmth.

22,30,KAP1356,3.83,"750 ml bottle picked up at Giant Eagle the day after Thanksgiving. Poured into a cervoise...  A - Pours a nice dark brown color that reminds me of the shade of chocolate. Nice, finger thick, light tan head forms and dissipates quickly leaving a cap of the same color.  S - Dark malts and Belgian yeast come first along with some dark fruits. Plums, raisins, and prunes come out as the fruits. Smells sweet with some caramel coming out as well.  T - Sweet flavors of dark malts and dark fruits with Belgian yeast. Raisins, prunes and some plum mixed with some slight caramel flavors. Some nice flavors here and fnishes slightly like a port would.  M - Creamy feel on the tongue with a medium body. Moderate carbonation as well.  O - Only my second Unibroue beer and although I liked this less than La Fin du Monde, I still enjoyed sipping on it while sitting around with family. I might revisit this one again sometime.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Belgian Dark Strong Ale,94
22,30,LeoPanna,4.33,"A: poured into a Unibroue tulip. Dark red, almost black.. held against the light I see some bright red, pink bottom, hazy brown right under the head. the head started at one finger but noisily dissipated to a thin layer, bright creamy white...looks like a root beer.... after a while the head completely disappears.  S: Smells like alcohol, grass, black cherries. Can't really think of anything else, but it smells nice.  T: Wow! Heavy malts, black & maraschino cherries and a little chocolate... but not like the smell. it's much more intense.. a slight orange essence w the alcohol. aftertaste really brings out the chocolate tones while keeping the cherry flavors in tact. The aftertaste is crisp but the initial blast of flavor steals the show. This brew really makes you want to take another sip right away.  MF: Perfect carbonation level, it seems to balance the flavors. It's easy on the tongue but quite sharp on the back of the throat.  O: another great Ale from Unibroue. I could easily stick with Unibroue Ales if I had to choose a session beer. They're high in alcohol but extremely drinkable. This is a beautiful dark ale, unique flavor and easy to find in NYC. Definitely an 'A' in my book.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Belgian Dark Strong Ale,94
22,30,RickS95,4.44,"Pours an extremely dark brown, almost thickish, color. Strongly resembles spent oil. The head is about a finger in thickness, a light tan color and dissipates relatively quickly leaving a creamy film on top and a light ring of bubbles around the perimeter.  The smell is of dark, ripe fruits--almost like wine--lighter fruits like apple and pear, with an ever so slight hint of chocolate.  The dark fruits are prevalent in the taste as well, along with spices and a sweet malty flavor. The finish is more champagne like than wine like.  There's complexity on the palate. It's sweet, spicy, acidic and a bit carbonated. The finish is dry and it's more light to medium bodied than I'd have guessed from the color.  It's another enjoyable beer from Unibroue. Tastes a bit different than a lot of other Belgian strong dark ales, but it's a must try nonetheless.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Belgian Dark Strong Ale,94

Then big dark fruits, with cherries, plums, figs, raisins, and some cranberry. Spicy with cloves and Belgian yeast. Just a hint of alcohol in the finish.  M: Medium body. Medium carbonation.

Small but high-retention cream head, with messy lacing  S - Pretty much malt and that signature Unibroue yeast. This doesn't have the spice of, say, La Terrible, or the phenols of La Fin du Monde, but still smells much better than most.  T - Probably the defining characteristic, the taste is spicy, with a small alcohol bite. Almost smoky aftertaste, but still fairly sweet.  M - Creamy, low-medium body. Can hang in your mouth a while despite it's high ABV.  D - Other than La Terrible, this is probably the least drinkable Belgian Unibroue, and for good reason: it's spicy, sweet, dark and alcoholic.

Leaves some lacing, but not a whole lot.  S: Smells very sweet, its got a candy like sweetness to it. Also very fruity. I get cherry, cranberry, fig, sugar. It smells slightly tart and I get a touch of alcohol.  T: Surprisingly light, crisp, and mellow (my bottle has been cellared for a year and a half). Not nearly as sweet as it smells, I get mainly plum and cherries with a light cranberry tartness. Alcohol is masked fairly well, but you know it is there. Finishes on the sweeter side, but with a light tartness and remains slightly dry all the way through. Caramel starts to come out as it gets closer to room temperature. You start to notice the spiciness after the bottle is almost done. The clove seems to have a tongue numbing effect, really strange!  M: Light, but with medium-high carbonation.  This was overall good, but I expected something great. I think this one smells better than it tastes, but is still a fine brew.

Very vegtabley, not what I expected at all. Almost undrinkable, if I believed in drainpouring I would have done so  Mouthfeel: slimy and offputting  Overall: I do not know if there was something wrong with my bottle or if this is just what it tastes like.

Appearence-Seems to have a ruby red dark plum color. Like a dark purple. Didnt get too much head and the head i did get didnt last too long.  Smell-Sweet and sour at the same time. Belgian candy and sweet malts. Raisens and black licorice (sorry for the bad spelling)  Taste-Ok, little different from what i expected. A lot of black licorice, and plum flavors. Dark candies and seems like a good amount of hops.  Mouthfeel-Simple, light, nice carbonation. Lingers a little bit.  Overall-A good beer.

T: Dark fruit qualities (plums, cherries) upfront with a very pleasant caramel-like malt backbone. Faint sour balsamic element is just about right. This is balanced superbly between the malt and slightly bitter hop presence, delivering a very mellow and smooth flavour. Alcohol is very nicely hidden.

A good bit of head with no lacing.  Smell: Very malty with plum and raisin smell.  Taste: Delicious, excellent fruit taste, Belgians are beginning to become my favorite style beers. The raisin and plum flavors are distinct to me. The darker malt is sweet and adjust the mouthfeel to compliment a different style Belgian than the light whites I'm used to.

A bubbly tan head fizzes and fades to a collar and leaves a few spots of lace on the glass.  Smell: The nose is full of raisins, cherries, plums, and a bit of figs. Dark caramel malt is kind of light compared to the fruit. A little bit of ethyl alcohol is also noticeable in the back.  Taste: The flavor is full of dark and orchard fruit. Some light caramel and bready malt up front supports raisins, cherries, plums, and figs. A white grape note imparts a crisp tartness at the end of the sip.

22,30,keanex,4.67,"Poured from a 12 ounce bottle with a best before date 9-8-2013 into a tulip glass.  A: Deep garnet, which looks black unless seen through a light. Carbonation bubbles meet a thick foamy tan head.  S: Sweet cherry medicinal smell, very pleasant.  T: Very sweet and fruity, but in a syrupy way, but I mean that in the best way possible. Roasted malts and cherries make the flavor here with a slight spice.  M: Syrupy with good carbonation.  O: I love this from the first sip. A very flavorful beer with good malty taste mixed with fruit. I like this a lot.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Belgian Dark Strong Ale,94
22,30,Phelps,4.09,"Poured into a snifter at Tops.  Deep burgundy, dark enough to be almost opaque, though the thinner parts show some amber translucence. Head is half a finger tall, off-white and popping away pretty quickly, leaving not a trace of bubbles.  Fantastic nose. Brown sugar, lots of clove, prune, wood smoke. The smoke and spice adds a ton of interest. Bit of Belgian hops in the back. Piquant and spicy.  All of the above, and more. Clove, dried orange peel, prune, a hint of smoke, tangy raisins. The swallow brings a blast of spice and citrus. Kind of different from your average uber-sweet Belgian dark, but good nonetheless. Hint of licorice.  Lightly massaging bubbles die away quickly, expanding into soft fizz. The body is a hint under medium while it lasts. A good amount of fumes in the nose, but the heat is well-hidden overall.  Not bad. Trois Pistoles has more spice and citrus than I'm used to, and it’s a bit lacking in the complexity of established Belgians. But it’s different, at least.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Belgian Dark Strong Ale,94
22,30,BierStein711,4.34,"This thick elixir was poured into a snifter.  Jet black beer had excellent head retention, if poured correctly. Taste was of several fruits and alcohol. Overall, a solid beer. I recommend it to someone who wants to try Belgian style beers without busting their budget. I am more into wheat beers, but I like this ale.  I cannot wait to explore others like it!!!",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Belgian Dark Strong Ale,94
22,30,ChugginOil,4.12,"Pours a dark brown color and has a fingers worth of low retention head. The off-white head leaves some messy lacing along the glass.  The nose is full of dark fruits and Belgian yeast. Plums, cherries, and fig come to mind off the bat. Followed by the fruits comes a bit of that clove filled spicy yeast.  The taste is also infused with a nice amount of dark fruits. The cherries are there without any tartness, just lightly sweet cherries. The figs are also present and keep it mild as far as sweetness. Belgian yeasts are playing a tasty roll here as well. Spice and clove are noticed.  The mouthfeel is medium bodied with good carbonation to carry the flavors. A semi-dry finish is also quite nice.  Overall, this is a nice representation of this style and keeps it very traditional and tasty.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Belgian Dark Strong Ale,94
22,30,JTSbeerislife,4.45,"22 oz bottle, purchased 7/2011, from a reputable bottle shop, bottle code on bottle but undecipherable.  Poured into a Corsendunk Tulip.  Pours a big 2 finger head which slowly reduces to an 1/8” cap. Easily revived. Each pour produces another big head. This ale is alive! Very, very deep amber, almost black color. Has an old world ale look to it.  Wonderful, distinct, hit of yeast when first smelled, followed by candied, dark, rich malt and complex dried fruit. Each pour produces an explosion of yeast and malt aroma. As the ale warms the yeast becomes even more intense. Extremely enjoyable.  Very crisp, lively, carbonated entry on the palate. The carbonation is perfect and very much like a Belgium Ale. Very rich malt follows, still accented with that wonderful crispness. Distinct yeast and candied malt dominate the flavor throughout the pour. Complex dried fruit flavors. No noticeable hops, but they are not needed as there is so much else going on. Wow!  Long, long finish of malt and yeast. Very enjoyable.  Label states bottle fermented, and you can surely tell with the distinct yeast and champagne like carbonation. This big Belgium style ale is incredibly delicious and very complex. The 9% ABV is never noticed. Each sip invites you to have another, until the bottle is empty. If I had the money I would buy this by the case!",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Belgian Dark Strong Ale,94
22,30,afdempse,4.32,"Dark brown color with a large frothy light tan head of three fingers. Nice lacing.  Aroma: Heady notes of overripe fruits. Apples, plums, spiced pears, figs. Slight alcohol as it warms.  Flavor: Huge yeast esters, darkly roasted malts, brown sugar, dark sweet cherries, clove essence. Excellent layering of flavors; the balance is awesome.  Mouthfeel: Excellent carbonation. Body is medium to medium-light. Finishes very dry considering the sweetness present in the flavor. Exceedingly drinkable for a beer of this strength.  One of my favorites from Unibroue, and an amazing value for the price!",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Belgian Dark Strong Ale,94
22,30,optimistictour,4.4,"It looks dark as night with a thin crowny head that recedes immediately yet looks enticing and appropriately Belgian.  It smells like a good Belgian should - in fact, better and more honest than any North American examples of the style I can think of right now. There's wheat and yeast and some dark fruit & hint-of-coffee notes.  Tastes as advertised on the bottle with fresh fruit, bit of tang, and a warm winey aftertaste.  Mouthfeel is where this truly shines and tricks me into thinking it's an honest-to-balls Belgian import. Carbonation tickles the palate just right, viscosity is spot on, the way it works down is just magic, especially for its 9% abv. This is the point at which a good beer turns great.  In other words, try this if you have the chance. Skip over other Unibroue offerings and tap straight into their gold supply with Trois Pistoles.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Belgian Dark Strong Ale,94

T - Yeasty, doughy, musty and sweet. A strong bready malt backbone supporting vanilla and sultana flavours.  M - Rich and smooth with a slight warmth.  O - Complex and beautiful beer. Abv very well veiled by the cornucopia of Belgian flavours and aromas.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Belgian Dark Strong Ale,94
22,30,Nerudamann,3.83,"Poured from a bottle into a snifter glass.  Look – dark brown color with about two fingers’ worth of light khaki-colored foam that dissipates somewhat slowly.  Smell – malty smell with indeed hints of fresh fruit and maybe a bit of brown sugar.  Taste – dark and malty tasting. Fairly strong tasting, but not necessarily a strongly alcoholic taste. Unique taste in the middle that I can’t quite identify. It’s a bit of a musky quality, but pleasant. Almost a nut brown taste.  Mouthfeel – pretty well balanced, but leans slightly toward the watery side.  Overall – very interesting and good taste. Fun to think about an analyze as well as to enjoy.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Belgian Dark Strong Ale,94
22,30,carolinabeerguy,4.15,"Review from notes at World of Beer - Fort Myers on 9/29/11.  Poured on draft into a tulip.  Appearance: Pours a dark caramel brown with a light tan head. Excellent lacing.  Smell: Sweet light and dark fruit with a touch of Belgian yeast.  Taste: Sweet dark fruit with a touch of citrus up front followed by Belgian yeast in the middle before ending with a touch of alcohol. Bittersweet aftertaste.  Mouthfeel: Medium-bodied with a good amount of carbonation.  Drinkability: Very good drinkability. The elevated ABV% would keep you from drinking multiples, but the flavor is very good.  Overall: Very good beer overall. I love most everything Unibroue puts out, and I'm a big fan of Trois Pistoles in bottles. On draft, it's still very good.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Belgian Dark Strong Ale,94
22,30,Knapp85,3.83,"Poured out as a deep brown color with a nice looking tan head on top. The lacing is pretty good here. The smell of dark malts and fruits blend with the Belgian yeast aromas creating a slighty sweet aroma on the nose. The taste of the beer is lightly roasted, the sweetness of the fermented fruit flavors come through and leaves a dry finish in the mouth. The mouthfeel of this brew is a little creamy and had some light carobnation making this brew an easy going sipper that can be enjoyed for a while. Overall I found this to get better as it warmed up, this is a really nice brew.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Belgian Dark Strong Ale,94
22,30,Huhzubendah,4,"The beer is a dark hazelnut hue, with a half inch of beige head that leaves a decent amount of lacing on the glass. The aroma brings malt, yeast, caramels, dark fruit. The flavor is fairly sweet, with dark fruits and yeast. Alcohol warmth emerge in the finish. Lingering notes of sweet, dark fruits soaked in alcohol. Medium bodied with moderately high carbonation. While not as delectable as the upper tier beers of this genre, Trois Pistoles is ubiquitous and enjoyable.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Belgian Dark Strong Ale,94
22,30,linemanrt60,4.32,"It's been quite a while since I reviewed a beer, but this one just didn't give me the option to ignore it. Since I began to try exceptionally crafted beers, I have always served them as tolerably warm as possible. This beer was no exception, being served at just under room temperature in a large wine glass. Initially Trois Pistoles holds a nice white head with an off gray tint. The head fades relatively quickly, which may be due to both the alcohol content and the warmth of the bottle. The nose is a myriad of flavors in and of itself. The usual ever present scent of ripe bananas shows this beer to be true to its style but with a spice palate leaning heavily towards clove, nutmeg, and even some cinnamon. Some chocolate and and a creamy sweetness is also detectable in the nose. While some alcohol shows through, this is a beer meant to be savored and so the alcohol on display in the nose is not a factor to be concerned with.  On the flavor, it is a beer that I would recommend anyone try, beer lover or not, although for those who are not fond of alcohol's flavor and heat it may be prudent to chill the bottle a bit (JUST A BIT), before serving. As I just said alcohol does come through relatively quickly but not before the chocolate flavor and malt character shine through with wonderful balance. Banana esters and spice linger on the palate with a length and mouth feel, much like that of a good Bordeaux. The finish is extremely long and extremely well balanced with a nice alcohol warmth in the belly. Overall, if this beer is available try it, especially if the prices are comparable around the U.S. as my 750 ml bottle was just over $6.00 (which is a steal in my book). A beer as refreshing as returning to Beeradvocate to write a review!",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Belgian Dark Strong Ale,94
22,30,uawildcat,3.68,"Poured from a 12 oz bottle into an oversized Bordeaux glass. Nice dark slightly cloudy appearance with a nice cream colored head. It has a nice Belgian yeast smell, I am not sure how to describe this smell yet. It is like the smell of nail-polish remover, sweet dark fruits, and a hint of banana. Although written it doesn't sound pleasant, it actually some how does work.  The taste is slightly different from the smell. As it enters the mouth there is a slightly piercing bubbliness that yields to a more creamy mouth feel. It has the taste of a fig newton. It is sweet and fig like upfront. Then with a kind of pastry like flavor. The finish is dry with hints of banana and clove.  This is a good beer from Unibroue. I hope to try more of this style. The large flaw in my mind is the dry finish, it doesn't work well for this style.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Belgian Dark Strong Ale,94
22,30,papat444,4.2,"Poured from a 750ml. bottle (code L29102057Q) and split with my wife.  Appearance: Lots of beige head fills the flute and shows no signs of leaving. Body is a dark brown, like maple syrup and when held to the light i can see through certain parts.  Smell: Figs, fruits, an ever so slight tartness and very heady aroma.  Taste: Rich dark fruits including plums, dark cherries and raisins. Wood and a bit of port.  Mouthfeel: Strong carbonation, as with all their beers but it smooths out as it warms. Full body without feeling heavy. Really coats the mouth.  Overall: One of my favorites from Unibroue. Definitely worth a try.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Belgian Dark Strong Ale,94
22,30,JednoPivoProsim,4.09,"Poured from a 12 fl oz twist off bottle into a pint glass. Best before 03-08-14.  Appearance: Pours a thick dark cherry. Cloudy in the glass with a still beige head. This beer is solid, to say the least.  Smell: Sweet fruit, almost wine-like. The aroma reminds of a beer that I just can't put my finger on. This will drive me nuts for the rest of the evening.  Taste: Extremely flavorful. Tastes like a cherry wheat, with the slightest amount of tartness. One thing I do not taste is the alcohol.  Mouthfeel: Creamy, yet prickly (from the carbonation) and light at the same time. A lot lighter mouthfeel than the thick appearance would suggest.  Overall: Another style I would not reach for on a daily basis, but definitely a well crafted, great tasting beer. I'll give one away and cellar the other two!",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Belgian Dark Strong Ale,94

22,30,EricMichael,4.5,"Poured from bottle to snifter.  Appearance - Dark brown with amber hues with some yeast that was hard to see through the darkness. Good, light-brown head that lasted for a few minutes with some lacing.  Smell - Chocolate and peppercorn. Dark fruits and hints of a spice blend. Rum. Distinctly Unibroue yeast.  Taste & Mouthfeel - Chocolate malt and spiced rum. An amazing combination. Dark earthy flavors rolling along the tongue then riding a wave of yeast onto the back of the tongue and nose. Smooth, complex and spicy. Very dry finish with little aftertaste leaving you happy to come back for more. For how strong this was, the alcohol was very hidden. You could feel a faint warmth, but it was very well blended in.  Overall - Excellent Abbey Style Strong Dark Ale. Very good in all areas of what I look for in a brew.

T - Tastes of fig, very sweet. Belgian yeast and sweet cherry, as well as some molasses. There is almost a chocolate-covered banana flavor, with slight banana flavor coming from the yeast. The chocolate comes out a bit as it warms, and is very subtle at lower temps.  M - Medium body with lots of carbonation and a slightly sticky finish.  O - Overall I just don't love it the way I love most of their other beers. Not sure I can pick out why, but maybe the body doesn't quite match the flavor, and it tastes a bit... busy.

It's got a sweet and robust fruity aroma with some strong citrus aspects. Much more lively than expected for such a dark ale.  The flavour is smooth and balanced. Slightly tart to start, creamy mouthfeel leads into some strong, yet palatable dark fruit flavours. Some candy sweetness and The citrus and some spice come through towards the end.

Smells like Belgian &champagne yeasts, green apples, mild caramel malts & booze. This is the offspring of a cider & a Belgian.  Prickly carbonation hits the front of the tongue & apples & fruit just take over. Its dark, but damn - if one had their eyes closed, it would be imagined sipping a ultra light highly carbonated fruit funk ale.  Pretty light brew here, about a 4/10, which is a disappointment for the style its classified as. Was wanting & expecting a much thicker, fuller bodied, stronger ale. Wah fucking wah!  Its good - the girlfriend likes it which adds some points here & there. But overall, its really just not as heavy & strong as I was hoping for. I think Belgian Dark Ale fits the brew better than its given style, but hey - who the fuck am I to classify a beer?  $8.99 (-$1.00 coupon) = $7.99 at Total Wine & More.

The body is is a dark mahogany brown with a good amount of barely visible small carbonation bubbles. Some light lacing can be seen clinging to the glass throughout consumption.  Dark fruits aromas of plum and raisin are well-matched by dark roasted malts and a standard Belgian yeast aroma.  Just like the nose, the taste is packed with dark malts, dark fruits, and plenty of yeast. Notes of plum and cherry give this beer an almost medicinal quality. A rum-like alcohol warmth settles in the back of the throat at the end of each sip.  Medium bodied with excellent carbonation, this beer is very drinkable.

Plums, raisins, and figs all present with a candy sugar sweetness. Dark caramel and toffee as well. A touch of bread like yeast quality, which boosts the fruityness a bit and throws in a drying element to the aroma, if that's possible...  Big dark fruit sweetness in the foreground. Again, those candied dark fruits with plum and figs being the most prominent. A little bit of caramel and toffee in the background with a bready, drying yeast element in there. There's a nice roundness to the flavor as well, pretty balanced and probably the beer's strongest suit.  Thin and drying, with a touch more carbonation than what I prefer in a Belgian dark ale.

A lot more fruity with hints of plum, apple, cherries, and raisin in both taste and smell when at lower temperatures. While interesting to try cold, it's much more complex at a warmer temperature. I get lots of spice and confectioner's sugar in the nose. Taste starts out with dark, bitter malt, fades to a hint of cherries, and ends with hot alcohol and bitter hops. This beer is highly carbonated with small bubbles and a creamy feel in the mouth.  This is complex and a bit of a challenge. Spend some time with Trois Pistoles and you'll appreciate it better. I usually like the dark Belgians, but this one just came out of left field with all the fruit flavors and complexities. I feel the spices really throw off the balance, but the taste that lingers always begs me to take another sip.

Brown sugar and mission figs on the nose, baking spice and a bit of green fruity note almost like green raisins. Medium plus body with a nice bit of sweetness that is not the least bit overpowering. Caramel and deep toasted malts on the palate with more of the green grapes adding a tartness that keeps the sweetness in check. A really nice creamy carbonation that ties everything together. This is a beer that if you were tasting it blind, you would think it was most certainly an actual Belgian beer, not a Canadian one.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Belgian Dark Strong Ale,94

S- Licorice, grapes, brown sugar, and cloves come through fairly strong.  T- A warming mix of licorice, malt sweetness, and spiciness from the yeast dominate and come together nicely. A slight fruity aftertaste.  M- I think a thicker body would have accompanied the warming flavors a little better. A bit too bubbly.

Appearance-Dark purple with a two finger bubbly off white head that dissipates very quickly. Leaves little lacing.  Smell-Cherries, Prunes, brown sugar, vanilla, licorice. Molds well together and smells nice, just a tad bit subtle.  Taste-At first you get some tart cherries and other dark fruits along with some licorice. Like Maudite, very peppery towards the finish, this has some added Dunkleweizen feel towards the finish.  Mouthfeel-Medium bodied, medium carbonation. Just a little bit watery.  Overall- I feel like Unibroue can't make a bad beer. I definitely prefer Maudite over Trois Pistoles, but nonetheless a really good beer.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Belgian Dark Strong Ale,94
22,30,AlCaponeJunior,4,"Brown and cloudy with a tan head that had some staying power, lacing wasn't bad.  Smell was rather fruity, with Belgian type overtures. Banana, prunes, plums, figs, brown sugar.  Taste was similar to smell, yeasty with dark fruits primarily, plus a touch of banana and clove. Spicy.  Body was pretty full but not hard to drink considering the ABV.  It's another damn fine beer from Unibroue, one of the best beer brand values I've seen in the states, imported or not. This stuff isn't at all expensive, and I highly recommend you try stuff from these guys. Great job!",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Belgian Dark Strong Ale,94
22,30,DrewV,4.42,"Poured from a bottle out of the beer fridge at 45 degrees F into a Spiegelau Stemmed Pilsner (tulip) glass.  A: Solid cola-colored liquid in the glass with a 1.5-fingered light tan head. Spotty lacing clings to the glass until the very end.  S: Amazing balance of light and dark fruits. As with other Belgian Pale Ales, much apple and pear aromas blend with the darker cherry and plum aromas suited to Dark Ales.  T: Follows the nose with the same amalgam of light and dark fruits, followed by a substantial twang and eventually a full boozy kick as the beer warms. Belgian style? Check. Dark Ale? Check.  M: Sharp, well-carbonated and supported nicely by the booze. Moderately drying to the palate and the carbonation scrubs it nicely.  O: An oustanding Belgian Dark Ale. The vitrual dark ale equivalent of Duvel, except with the addition of some hot booziness. Even still, it is a fairly well balanced and powerfully flavored example of the style that comes with a warning: Beware the 9% ABV! My favorite dark ale thus far; a solid ""A"" brew.  NOTE: Frankly, I'm shocked at the number of reviews that claim the alcohol is ""well hidden"". This brew is fairly boozy and very warming to the body. There's no hiding those facts.

This is followed by ripe plum, fig, molasses, barnyard and maybe some candy sugar. Finishes with lingering spices, yeast and small traces of banana and bubblegum.  M: Medium-full bodied, smooth, clean and dry.  O: This is one robust beer! This is huge in the spice & yeast department so if you don't like clove, coriander, cinnamon, peppercorn or funky yeast you won't like this.

Pretty solid, but unspectacular.  S: Big, bold, and yeasty. Great mix of fruity esters + spicy phenols, backed up with some terrific dark fruits: grapes, plums, raisins. Very nice.  T: Follows the nose - super yeasty, with bubblegum, clove, pepper, and pear; chocolate and grape maltiness on the tail end; slight booze on the finish. Very tasty, but a bit more depth would have been welcome.  M: Substantial, smooth, and fully carbonated. Lovely.

22,30,Rijtjeshuis,4.22,"served in snifter.  LOOK (4/5) Pours a very dark, almost black mahogany brown - when held to the light, it shows itself to be almost 33*SRM. It's very opaque for the style. Two and a half fingers of off-white, mousy head is given off the pour. This lasts a long time, but fell with little lacing. Some nice carbonation was seen.  SMELL (4.5/5) The smell is dominated by yeast-aromatics with a lot of malt, but it has a drier finish to it. Melanoidin character is not as strong as others of this style and I get a bit more roasty or chocolate notes. Yeast aromatics are strong and they have a character that is hard to describe, but which is typical in Unibroue products. It has some of the following notes: spices (peepper, not clove); a hint of banana; a hint of grape; and a bit of bubblegum. In any event it sets of the melanoidins well. A bit of alcohol warmth.  TASTE (4.5/5) Similar to the smell. The maillard flavors are a bit stronger on the palate and it works well with the yeast. As for the yeast, the pepper is a bit stronger in the flavor than in the nose and this helps make a drier finish (maybe a hint of harder water?). Some alcoholic warmth on the finish.  FEEL (3.5/5) This was the only part that I had a problem with. The feel was a bit too light on both the body and carbonation fronts. A bit of a more substantial body might have worked well with the flavors.  DRINK (4/5) The lighter body makes this a bit more drinkable, though. I like the flavors so much, but they're a bit too dark for a good session. Really tasty, though!",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Belgian Dark Strong Ale,94

S: Dark Fruit explosion!! Figs, plums, raisins and black cherry are very pronounced in this beer. Belgian yeast is intertwined with a toffee malt character. Some alcohol coming off the beer as well.  T: Again, Figs, plums, raisins and black cherry are coming through combined with a small spice and candied sugar character. Toffee malts with hints of alcohol.  M: Medium bodied beer with plenty of carbonation for the style. Alcohol a little warm fresh, but this beer with some age would improve greatly.  O: Excellent beer that you can find just about anywhere, which makes me like this beer even more.

22,30,Thickfreakness,4.42,"Best by 01/14/13 on the bottle. I think that makes this a bottle from '09.  A- Black cherry soda appearance, lots of ruby highlights. Two finger tinged red head that dissapears rather quickly. Lots of carbonation hitting the surface and popping! No lacing at all, the foams just bubbles and fades.  S- Yeast and deep dark fruit hit the nose first. Fresh cut plums, dried figs, and sour cherry juice. Lots of unexpected banana, clove, star anise flavors that usually come from wheat beer. Sweet candy sugar and caramel notes, before the red wine and banana notes come rushing back in.  T- The fruit is still bright and fresh even after a couple of years sitting in the darkness of my cellar. Lots of banana-yeasty strains still alive and well. Time has been very generous to this ale. I've had this fresh, and it's really good... but after this long... it's superb!!!  M- Really nice carbonation, lingering deep cherry, leather, banana notes that stick to the tongue like their life depends on it. Light body, but full of flavors that burst in your mouth like Pop-Rocks! Slight sourness that makes you long for more.  O- I need to run out and try to find some more old stock of this brew. Really nice mouthfeel, amazing nose! This brew should be enjoyed any time that you'd drink a nice Cab!

22,30,zoso493,3.95,"Poured from a 12 oz bottle into a Chimay chalice.  Appearance: The head begins to be a big foamy, but eventually it recedes to a nice, thick, even eggshell-colored coating atop the brew. The color of the beer is just about dead on. It's a nice mahogany brown color with just the right amount of garnet being illuminated when held to the light.  Smell: The smell is a little on the subdued side, but it's enjoyable nonetheless. There are a lot of good estery and yeasty smells up front, followed by a tinge of fruitiness this is uncommon for the style, but a welcome addition.  Taste: The taste has a lot of very authentic belgian yeast, clove and estery goodness. It's a little too subtle for my taste, but this is a good beer.  Mouthfeel: Mouthfeel is where this beer struggles a bit. It's a little on the thin side, I think because it's just a tad overcarbonated.  All in all, this is a solid brew. I haven't had too many offerings of Unibroue, but I've never been overly impressed. They do tend to make some authentic Belgian imitations, though, and this one is no exception.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Belgian Dark Strong Ale,94

Viscous bubbles are rising through the head, and carbonation is very visible from the bottom of the glass. Head retention is excellent. Just a beautiful looking beer.  S: Smell at first is overwhelmingly dark fruits, such as raisins and figs or cherries, behind it, is a caramel and toffee malt presence. Perhaps some lighter fruits like apple or white grapes. Not the greatest, but as it warms improves a bit.  T: Wow, just a great tasting beer. At the forefront of the tongue is sweet dark fruits just like the smell, as it moves to the back, candy, fruits cross your palate, and there is an almost metallic taste as well. Aftertaste lingers on very sweet. I've never had port wine, but the bottle claims that this is similar to it.  M: The mouthfeel is creamy and silken, as it rushes across your palate with medium body and light-medium carbonation. Just a treat to have in your mouth. So smooth and tasty. Extremely drinkable.  O: Overall, just an amazing beer. For the price, I dont know of a better Belgian style beer. Stimulates your tongue and tastebuds with its amazing mouthfeel and flavors.

22,30,Daniellobo,4.07,"A nice and rich take on a Belgium Strong Dark Ale.  Presentation: 12 oz brown foiled and screw capped bottle. Front oval label framed in silver with the name of the brew and an ominous illustration of the winged horse flying over the church of Trois Pistoles representing the legend that names the brew. Back offers notes with general description of the brew, serving suggestions, best by date (12-22-13), and shows 9% Alc. by Vol. Served in a tulip glass.  A - Deep brown pour with ruby edges, rich frothy head, rather fizzy, moderate retention, short surface memory and minimal lacing.  S - The initial fruity yeast touch is long and reaches far away from the glass. A malty and fruity nose settles rather nicely. Figs, prunes.. Unfermented sugar..  T - Nice long palate, sweet and malty full of fruit touches. Ripe dark and dried fruit in the range, unfermented sugar... Light spicy touch in the tongue as it finishes.  M - Medium body with quickly settling medium carbonation offering a good finishing tingly sense.  O - Nice flow, rich and stimulating, a solid standard from Unibroue.  Notes: Long time since I had a Trois Pistoles. It was one of those that I bumped into years ago when I was expanding my interest in craft brewing and for some reason or another it faded away from the radar. This try rediscovers a brew richer than what I had stored in memory, maybe it is not for the ages, but it is quite pleasing and solid all around.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Belgian Dark Strong Ale,94

Lots of carbonation bubbles visible in the bottom of my Chimay goblet. Aroma is incredibly fruity, almost like juice and hardly reminiscent of beer. The taste is sweet and also fruity. Very good actually and not what I expected. It's light bodied and lively. Overall, this drinks very nicely. Reminds me a lot of what I liked about BSDA's when I first tried them and was introduced to what belgian beer can be all about. Classic taste.

T: Strong, juicy dark fruits up front, followed by Belgian yeast, brown sugar and sweet malts. Finishes with notes of licorice and semi-sweet chocolate; somewhat sour in the tail-end, with a touch of alcohol as well.  M: Medium-high carbonation. Very ""sharp"" as many BSDA-style beers tend to be. Doesn't cream up quite the way it should though, and drinks somewhat thin for the style.  O: At $6.99/750 ml bottle, Trois Pistoles is a very well put together BDSA. Nicely balanced and quite juicy on the tongue, this would match up nicely with grilled or roasted meats.

22,30,rickyleepotts,2,"It’s black… which immediately makes me think this is going to be a stout, or something similar. But the nose is more that of an ale. This is a Belgian strong ale, after all. (I still haven’t figured the difference between a regular ale and strong ale.) I do like that a lot of the beers we are drinking have a Belgian influence. Perhaps when we finish this project, we will take a trip to Belgium.  The beer isn’t very carbonated. It is actually quite smooth. There is an instant rush of sweetness, and a smooth dark aftertaste. But the aftertaste doesn’t stick around for long. It feels heavy on the tongue though. I am sure that is the 9% ABV. The head on this beer is pretty weak too. But after one drink… I find myself wanting a second almost immediately. The aftertaste leaves so quickly I want to see what else there is for my palate.  I worry that if this beer was easily accessible, it would get me in a lot of trouble. It doesn’t drink like a 9%. It’s so smooth. I like that though, as it allows me to drink a lot casually. That’s what this is… a casual beer. Imagine toasting with this at any given graduation, wedding, or funeral. (People drink at funerals, right?)  I like it… but I am not in love with it. It’s good, I would buy it again, but the most important part about this beer is the story.

Nice and tasty, but I'd prefer a fuller one. this one is above average, but nothing stellar.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Belgian Dark Strong Ale,94
22,30,jpro,4.38,"12oz bottle from the Unibroue Taster Pack. Poured into a Maudite snifter...  A: Pours a deep, molasses brown / black; tea-like on the edges, with a creamy, 1 inch almond head that shows some great retention and leaves a little lace.  S: Raisiny; molasses; ripe plum; some black cherry tartness along with some tannin notes that become more noticeable as the brew warms; maybe a scant hint of cocoa powder; just a small touch of alcohol on the nose, too.  T: Sweet, dark bread; figgy sweetness, too; dark fruit; a light, dry bitter on the finish; delicious.  M: Medium-full bodied, with a high carbonation; velvety and smooth. Wow.  O: Probably my favorite Unibroue ale... which is saying a lot. Its an interesting, enjoyable beer. Very drinkable. Complex without being over the top. 9%??!! Hard to believe -",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Belgian Dark Strong Ale,94
22,30,rundocrun,3.92,"A - Pours a deep, dark brown with some cloudiness and few highlights when held up to the light. Yields two fingers of white head that fades quickly to about a quarter inch.  S - Smells slightly of toasted barley but there is most definitely a strong fruity/boozy aroma evident as well. Minute amounts of floral hops are present too.  T - Sweet and malty up front with subtle bitterness and an interesting tang toward the finish. A spicy alcohol bitterness is also present. Aftertaste of brown bread and honey.  M - Slightly thin and watery, but with adequate carbonation. Has a sweet finish that leaves the mouth feeling sticky.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Belgian Dark Strong Ale,94
22,30,lawlerj,3.92,"Poured from a 12 oz. bottle into a tulip glass.  A - dark mahogany, almost black. One finger width head, disipates quickly, leaves a small collar. Looks to be about standard for the style.  S - Belgian yeast, bread, and dark raisins. Other fruit in there as well, but I can't pick it all out. No strong alcohol aroma though, which I like.  T - similar to the nose profile - yeasty/bready w/ some malt in the mix. Dark fruit abounds in the background along w/ some nice spiciness.  M - medium bodied, not as full as I had expected. Fair amount of carbonation.  O - overall, very nice. Not as good as a Rochefort or St. Bernardus but definitely delicious and can also be had for a very fair price considering the high quality.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Belgian Dark Strong Ale,94
22,30,gonzogrover,2.29,"Poured into a tulip. Pours a pretty dark and bold brown with a white head that disappears in a hurry. The scent is strong of fruits and spices. It also gives you the hint that it'll have a strong alcohol flavor. The taste is of strong spiciness, alcohol and some fruity sweetness. A combination that was hot, boozy and just didn't work at all for me. The mouthfeel was medium with more carbonation than I expect from this style. I typically really enjoy BSDAs and Quads but this is not one that I would recommend to my friends.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Belgian Dark Strong Ale,94
22,30,chinchill,4.31,"12 oz bottle -- ""best by 7-14-12"" -- served in a pint glass. [Revisited in July 2022].  Pours a hazy dark brown with orange highlights, and a surprisingly fizzy head like a soda. Like a soda the head dies to nothing rather quickly even though there is visible bubbling. [2022 version actually looks excellent - rating adjusted].  Complex aroma of ripe and dark fruits, bread, toasted malt, port wine and spices. Interesting, but I'm not sure what this will taste like. Alcohol becomes more evident with warning.  Taste - the flavor components one would infer from my description of the aroma are all there, yet the flavor is a bit different than I expected. More and richer malt flavor for one thing. More subtle spiciness for another. Not as bold or enticing as the premier Belgian counterparts (e.g., Rochefort 8), but a fine balanced brew that avoids the over-spicing or imbalance that too often characterize Belgian style ales. Enjoyable and lingering aftertaste with a striking dark fruit flavor. High ABV partially hidden.  M - medium body) and medium-high carbonation. Bordering on 3.75.  Overall. the exceptional aroma and flavor make this easy to recommend.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Belgian Dark Strong Ale,94
22,30,mdaschaf,3.95,"Review from notes. Had at Half Full in Lewes, DE.  A: Poured a hazy purple/brown color with a small egg colored head with nice retention. Decent lacing left on the sides. Some small bubbles at the top as well.  S: Very fruity. Lots of grapes and raisins with some plums and black currants hints as well. Some spicy yeast and a little bit of caramel round it out.  T: The same fruits from the nose come forward on the flavor profile. Lots of grape and raisins, some caramel and belgian yeast. There is also a little bit of bruised apple, vanilla, and a little bit of booze.  M: Medium bodied with a good bit of carbonation, somewhat prickly from the bubbles. A very sweet beer that hides the alcohol pretty well.  O: Pretty good beer that can be purchased at a relatively low price. Tastes similar to red wine in some ways actually. Extremely drinkable.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Belgian Dark Strong Ale,94
22,30,TMoney2591,4.15,"Served in a tumbler.  Back in the day, I was enticed to buy this beer by the lovely label and seemingly exotic cork-and-caged presentation. Now, I just remember it being damn tasty. It pours a dark burnt sienna topped by a nice finger of dirty off-white foam. The nose comprises clove, pumpernickel, black pepper, nutmeg, black cherry, cinnamon, candi sugar, and Belgian yeast. The taste brings in more of the same, along with some red apples, black grapes, raisins, figs, and rye bread. The body is an ephemerally light yet still pretty strong medium, with a very light moderate carbonation and a strangely crisp finish. Overall, a very nice BSDA, one I'll probably be returning to many times in the future.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Belgian Dark Strong Ale,94

Appearance: Dark, amber, hazy body. 3-finger off-white head dissipates a bit more quickly than I'd like, but remains on the inside of the glass.  Flavor: Clove, carmelized sugar, apple butter, brown sugar, and a very mild bitterness at the end. A sweet, yet clean finish.  Mouthfeel: High CO2 leads to crisp carbonation on the front. Medium-to-full body.  Overall: A spicy, tasty, carmelly, and enjoyable dark Belgian-style ale. Highly sessionable, but be careful.

Aroma of CLOVES then came some cherry and other fruit notes  Tasted of cloves then as it warmed up came the fruitiness and a wee bit of alcohol, some notes of toasted malts.

Quite pleasant aroma.  T - Low bitterness considering the abv content. Raisins, old grapes, apples and a little bit of yeast. Wine-like, but maybe a tad bit sweeter.  M - Average, medium bodied.

S: The smell was a little different then I was expecting, as it wasn't quite so overpowering as the ABV led me to believe. Dark fruit dominates the nose, but that's about it. Good, but not great.  T: Fruit fruit fruit. As a third party said, ""it tastes like rotting berries"". This isn't the knock it sounds like it could be, but it is strongly reminiscent of rotgut wine. It finishes with a nice sweet note, and a hint of hoppy bitterness. The Belgian runs underneath everything, providing good continuity through the taste.  M: Very smooth. No hint of alcohol. I actually really enjoy less heavy dark ales, so this hits the spot nicely. That said, it is a bit on the airy side.

S: Spices, sweet candy sugar, and some dark fruit aromas up front. There's a floral, ginger-like aroma to it as well along with some notes of cinnamon. Belgian yeast aromas bring up the finish.  T: Similar to the aroma, lots of spice notes like coriander and cinnamon. There are some dark fruits in there as well as a touch of molasses. The finish is of slightly bitter, hearty bread with a slight alcohol presence.  M: Medium-light body with medium carbonation, this beer is pretty well attenuated, giving it an overall crisp feel.  O: A pretty good beer, overall. Nicely attenuated, though the flavor doesn't quite live up to all the nose promises.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Belgian Dark Strong Ale,94

I seem to find all of unibroue's beer to smell the same, and if its all the same yeast then possibly thats what im getting (except for the ephemere's).  T-M: Also tasted somewhat distinctly different from the others which I have always had a sense of being too similar. This one was sweeter and richer with a heavyness to it in the throat. Hops came at the while the boozy quality was in the middle. The fruit and sweetmalts were in the nose. dont know why i did that backwards.  D: Very nice.

Aroma powerhouse. Malt, bread, yeast and dark fruit. Well balanced.  Nice malty flavor, brown sugar and a cider taste. Interesting, but good.  The body is a lot lighter than expected from the smell. Also light carbonation makes this an easy drink.  Overall a rich but not overpowering strong ale. A real nice balance between malty and lightness.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Belgian Dark Strong Ale,94

Great smell, slight Belgian yeast, almost like Cola.  The taste is sweetness and very fine carbonation up front, followed by Belgian sweet yeast and comforting warming from the alcohol. Quite impressive really.  Slight bitterness on the tail end, with figs and bready notes. Not overly malty but very rich. The warming lingers with a nice aftertaste. Such a fine beer, complex and refined. Excellent!  I've waited almost a year for this, absolutely fantastic!",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Belgian Dark Strong Ale,94
22,30,StoutHunter,4.12,"I got a bottle of Trois Pistoles for $3.29 at The Lager Mill the other day. I tried this brew a year ago and I thought it was pretty good so lets see what I think of it now. Best buy date of 12-03-12. Poured from a foiled 12oz brown bottle into a goblet.  A- I like the label a lot, it has a cool fantasy medieval look to it. It poured a nice hazy dark brown color with three fingers worth of off white head that died down to a thick layer that stayed till the end.  S- At first I pick up some medium roasted malts that have an earthy, grainy and sweet aroma to it. There is a large prescence of dark fruits in this beer, lots of figs, plums and a little bit of raisin. There is also some typical spice from the Belgian yeast, smells just as good as I remember it.  T- That taste has some moderate sweetness to it along with a slight bit of tart sourness. The malts impart a little bit of caramel but the main player in the flavor is the dark fruits, pretty much all of the ones I picked up in the aroma are in the taste along with the spices from the yeast. I pick up some candied sugar along with some slight bitterness and a presence of alcohol on the finish. It is balanced but not as complex as the nose led me to believe.  M- A little on the thick side for being medium bodied with a pretty dry finish. It had a nice amount of carbonation that suited this beer.  Overall this was a good Belgian Strong Dark Ale. I had Hell Hath No Fury yesterday and it was just about as good but this one was a lot more traditional and truer to it's style. Everything was pretty spot on for the style with the aroma being the highlight of this beer. This brew didn't disappoint and was about as good as I remember. I would for sure buy this beer again, its a nice beer to have on hand. If you like Belgian beer you will like this one. A good well rounded beer from Unibroue.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Belgian Dark Strong Ale,94
22,30,imprezawrxsti,4.5,"Found in a 750ml bottle at Argonaut in Denver's Capitol Hill.  Pours a nearly opaque plum colour, fuzzy with suspended yeast. Some head which fades but leaves behind noticeable lacing.  Smells delicious...all sorts of fruit and nut notes, very complex, almost overwhelming but in no way overpowering. One sniff only makes you want to tip your glass a little further back. Which I did...  Tastes quite like it smells, with well-balanced tastes from all over the spectrum...cinnamon, nutmeg, dried fruits and dates. Even a bit of licorice. Bottom line, it tastes very, very good, and feels adequately thick but again, not overwhelming on the palate.  This is one of my favourite beers of all time (so far haha). It's a sipping beer, layered and complex. And did I mention it's 9%? If you can find this beer, it's not one to miss.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Belgian Dark Strong Ale,94
22,30,Smakawhat,2.77,"Poured from the bottle into a tulip glass. Bottled dated best before date of 09-08-13 (9th Aug 2013? or is that 2009-Aug-13th??). If it's the latter, then this review might explain what happened.  Out of the bottle a stupid amount of carbonated noise. Head is a light tan but goes fast. The brew doesn't even leave a collar (there is one in my bottle though). Body is a real nice dark cherry it almost resembels wine, but that's because there is NO head on this or even a collar at all. Not that impressed here, looks like dead on arrival. But hey... best before 2013 so no excuses guys, so review is onward. Final pour on slow brings the collar finally!  Nose is small, box grape sweet Welches juice and powedered dry yeast. Doesn't seem too bad, after some smells and whiffs it's actually kind of nice, I feel like I am in wine mode here. I'll go with this yeah sure.  First taste... is gaseously awful and off putting. But strangely, another sip and it comes out much improved and that burn is never felt again. Sweet mild chocolate and that cheap Welches Concord like grape taste again. Mouthfeel has some coating quality and minor chewy-ness. Pricklyness and gas subsides and goes to an almost tannic dry mouth in the front. have to admit after some time this gets ALOT better...  What the heck is it with Unibroue and these beers sometimes? They seem either really great or incredibly.. bad isn't the word.. it's more as if they are dysfunctional. This one... hard to put into words, but I know I wont be having it again (except maybe on tap if I don't have a choice). Still... doesn't stop me from trying their goods!",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Belgian Dark Strong Ale,94

S: sweet on the nose with a bit of sourness. Cherries, caramel, raisins, and a bit of a wine like nose T: A whirlwind of flavors from this beer with some cherry like flavors and some sourness. Mostly fruity flavors from this one with a hint of caramel. Aftertaste leans toward the bitter side and doesn't linger for long leaving the mouth wanting another sip. M: Prickly carb with a silky smooth mouthfeel. Not too heavy and not too thin. O: A damn good beer from Unibroue. I could drink this until I passed out. It's a bit too high in ABV to session but it is most definitely pleasant to drink and the alcohol is hidden quite well.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Belgian Dark Strong Ale,94
22,30,Roke87,4.27,"341 ml bottle, chilled, and poured into a snifter.  Appearance- Pours a dark brown in colour, not completely black but on the darker side, has a good 2 fingers of light cream coloured head, which slowly dissipates to a good sized lace, leaving minimal spotting throughout the glass.  Smell- Is very interesting and there are a lot of different flavours going on here, right off the bat you get some licorice, definitely some dark fruit smell and spice in there.  Taste- Is definitely spice and licorice right away, minimal fruit flavours in the taste and finishes with more licorice.  Mouthfeel- Medium bodied on the pallet, with good carbonation, and finishes with more licorice taste that lingers till the end.  Overall- Haven’t had a beer yet from Unibroue that didn’t almost completely knock my socks off and this one is no different, a great smelling, great tasting dark ale that has all the qualities of a world renowned beer. If you’re a fan of darker ales and have this readily available, pick it up, you won’t be disappointed, and at the 9% ABV it goes down very smooth.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Belgian Dark Strong Ale,94

Doesn't look like it has much carbonation.  Smell - Delicious smell. Figs and dark fruit. Some caramel malts and the typical candi sugar smell. My friend smelled coffee, but I did not.  Taste - The taste isn't as impressive as the aroma. Some aromas translated into flavor: the figs and other fruits and the belgian candi sugar. A bit of licorice in the finish. Just not as complex as I was hoping.  Mouthfeel - Very light bodied for such a strong beer. Probably from the added sugar. Low carbonation and a very dry finish. I wish it had been a bit thicker.  Overall - Tasty, but nothing I'd order again (especially at $7.50 a glass...wow).

22,30,animalchin,4.5,"Poured in a chalice. Freshness date says good until 2013.  A - A complex and layered array of dark caramel brown with a nice lighter outline around the chalice. A nice thick head resides for sometime, but then dissipates into a mere layer with some sporadic and circular lacing about the glass.  S - Dark and fruity malty characteristics followed by a more sweeter, yet spicy action. The sweetness consists of raisin and caramel, with the spice being clove.  T - A bittersweet introduction (literally speaking) - definitely very aggressive upfront with all kind of malt and spice taking action. Hard to say where to begin with the characteristics; has all of the basis of a Belgian dark ale - plum, raisin and the stickiness of caramel with the bitterness of cocoa.  M - Very murky and chewy, with very minimal activity as far as carbonation is concerned.  O - Probably one of the finest beers I've ever reviewed. I admire a brewers ability to keep me guessing and finding new traits in their beers with each sip, and this one is no exception. This work speaks volumes about the style, and truly brings out characteristics that one may not often come across.  Excellent.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Belgian Dark Strong Ale,94

Smell- I can smell a huge amount of Cherries at first, and then there are notes of cinnamon and prunes possibly? Great!  Taste- Very fruity upfront taste, has a darker taste then with a prune type of taste and then has almost a grainy/sawdust finish. Such a complicated and complexed beer. Very good as well.  Mouthfeel- Light-Medium Bodied, High amount of carbonation and a warming feeling all the way through.  Overall- A very nice ale! I wouldn't be able to drink all night, but enjoyed thoroughly.

The aroma is of dark fruits, some spice, and perhaps a hint of alcohol. There isn't much aroma and it's hard to pick up anything here. Bland.  A somewhat complex mix of fruits, figs, raisins, brown sugar, molasses, and alcohol. That sounds good, but it's not overly flavorful and once again pretty bland.

Thin head, with nice swirling patterns on top.  S: Medicinal, herbal, grassy, a hint of menthol iciness, like a cough drop almost. A hint of tart cherries. A very earthy effervescent scent this has.

Overall, I am extremely impressed with this beer on what is my first tasting. Unibroue rules and this beer is no exception.

The malts have a nice sweet roasted/chocolaty character and the hops bring no bitterness. The spiciness of the beer also adds to the great taste and balance. The flavours are definetly very complex.  Mouthfeel: It has a high carbonation with an incredible balance of flavourrs. It has a nice smoothness to it and leaves your mouth full of numerous flavours.

First you taste fruits such as dates and plum, a smoothness washes over the tongue leaving a sweet, bready aftertaste. The beer is medium bodied with lots of soft carbonation, does not have a dry finish. This beer is a must dry, Unibroue has failed to disappoint so far.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Belgian Dark Strong Ale,94
22,30,Duckmancgy,4.58,"750ml bottle to snifter.  I don't know what to say except I have a new favorite. This beer is simply outstanding in my mind. More like a fine wine then a beer actually.  Upon opening the nose is treated with a slightly alcoholic smell paired with ripe fruit and spices. Pours a gorgeous dark brown with easily a 2 finger tan creamy foam head.  **be sure to try this slightly warm as the flavours truly develop when warmed**  First taste brings on spice and fruit, carries on a very warming feel to the mouth. The snifter, I think brings out a depth of flavour that would be lost in a normal pint glass. Simply delightful as I continued to drink the beer. If you hold it in your mouth a bit you find a caramel flavour enveloping the tongue with the small bubbles as they dissipate across the mouth.  Easily a drinkable beer with a meal or just sitting around enjoying the company of friends. The Unibroue site has a pairing section for this and their other beers, but really a good glass and some friendly conversation would work for me!!  Excellent.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Belgian Dark Strong Ale,94
22,30,ssuggs01,3.53,"Trois Pistoles is a deep brown color, almost black except for around the edges. Off-white head transitions nicely into a moderate head and patchy lacing. Smells of wet malts, some zesty citrus hops. Bitter yeast scents and dark fruits. Taste is spicy and alcoholic is hot. Some sweet plums and cherries but the bitter hops keep this under control. The hops are very zesty and herbal but the aftertaste is bitter.Mouthfeel could use to be a little smoother. The alcohol is very prevelent and this takes away from the drinkability. This is a belgian strong dark that represents the style very well although I did wish Trois Pistoles was a little more balanced.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Belgian Dark Strong Ale,94
22,30,Brunite,3.85,Appearance: Dark molasses colored with ruby edges. Lots of carbonation and a decent head.  Smell: The closest beer I've had that smells like sherry. Lots of dark fruit notes. Some spiciness and earthiness from the Belgian yeast strain.  Taste: Initially a bit fizzy but a few swirls and the carbonation lets up. There is a sherry-like quality to this one. Crisp yet complex.  Mouthfeel: Very good. A bit thinner than medium. Almost like a dubbel.  Drinkability: A definite sipper but the alcohol is well hidden. A pleasant drink. Will have again.,Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Belgian Dark Strong Ale,94

S: floral, kind like honeysuckle or jasmine nectar, Fabuloso cleaner (the Mexican one), plums and dark pit fruit  T: the familiar trappings of a Belgian: bubble gummy yeast, sweet sweet malt, a slight sourness, bananas, apricot, vanilla--a little like bourbon--red grapes, brown sugar.  M: medium body, smooth carbonation, though it does go a little flat, warming alcohol definitely matches up with that ABV.  D: a pretty delicious, though a little too sweet for my tastebuds, but it's definitely a legit BSA.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Belgian Dark Strong Ale,94
22,30,TCgoalie,4.13,"Pours a darkish brown with an off-white head. The best part of the appearance is the wonderful lacing. The bubbly lacing sticks to the glass with ease creating exciting patterns.  This smells of red grapes, funk, brown sugar, cat hair, and dark fruits.  The overall taste is that of mildly sour dark fruits, metal, brown sugar, and mild yeasts.  The highlight of the mouthfeel is the drying in the end. It feels light in the mouth despite the abv.  Overall, this is very drinkable and very tasty for the style.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Belgian Dark Strong Ale,94

22,30,damndirtyape,4.6,"12oz bottle (best by 11/24/13) poured into a Tulip glass.  Appearance: Dark and cloudy cola brown beer with a light tan head, a persistent 1/16"" thick after dying down from a 1/4"" start. Delicate but persistent and extensive lacing noted in islands and strands. Really surprised me with how dark it was upon pouring.  Smell: Yeasty, malty, and loaded with dark fruit smells (plums, prunes). Very appealing in that combination - makes me think of a plum danish.  Taste: Sweet malt dominates with more of the fruit flavors (plums, maybe sour cherries) and some caramel notes. Surprisingly crisp and clean finish with all that sweetness going on. Not cloying - just well on the sweet side of things but with my sweet tooth this is fantastic.  Mouthfeel: Crisp spicy carbonation on the tongue followed by a very smooth beer gliding over the tongue and down easily. The carbonation is lingering a bit on the tongue after the swallow, so while it cleanses the palate, it's maybe a bit too scouring. But that smoothness of the beer - wow that's good.  Drinkability: Oh man is this a dangerous one. The alcohol is so well hidden I could see having two of these in no time and then realizing how much alcohol I've just had. I could drink this all on its own but in this case, I had it with a meal, which it went really well with - cinnamon + curry beef stew over couscous. I could easily have this again and again. Amazing beer.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Belgian Dark Strong Ale,94

Pours pretty in line with all of Unibroues; Nice puffy carbonation producing a good head that dissipates moderately leaving a nice thin lace. Deep amber/purple, very nice looking though a little thin perhaps.  Lots of dark berry in the nose with a touch of the 9% on there.  Nice berries, banana, and some bread/sourness. It feels empty somewhere through a sip but there's nice carbonation at the end.  At no point is the 9% aggressive and the nice sweet balance of fruits and malts makes this a good compliment to a slightly spicy meal.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Belgian Dark Strong Ale,94

A: Dark, dark, dark, dark, dark... almost opaque amber color with a big massive mocha head that hung around for a bit.... then disipated.  S: Very dark, with every non-citrus or berry fruit under the sun and more: dates, raisons, black cherries, champagne, and red wine.... for starters.  T: Everything on the nose + more. The cherry element was particularly present on the end of the taste. Wow!  M: Thick enough for the style. Fruity as hell, but once again... dark, dark, DARK FRUIT. The carbonation was champagne-like, and (as with most Unibroue beers) the highlight of the session.  D: For a 9% ABV beer, this was fantastic and one of my favorites from the renowned brewery.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Belgian Dark Strong Ale,94
22,30,mklinger,4.17,"Extremely dark brown, with a tan head. It's darker than a lot of Belgian Strong Dark Ales, almost like a porter, but it pours thinner. Decent looking beer.  Aroma is that of overripe apples with a bit of lemon and floral hops -- just enough to brighten the ripe apple.  The predominant flavor is Belgian yeast phenols & esters, fruity spices. No roast flavors at all. Some brown sugar sweetness, and an assertive carbonation bite on the tongue. Little bit of alcohol at the end, but just barely there. Very drying at the end, too.  Mouthfeel is complex -- thin at first drinking with very high carbonation. Then you swish it round your mouth a bit and it foams up into a big, rich mouthfull of beer. A nice drinking beer -- both complex and highly drinkable.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Belgian Dark Strong Ale,94

Nice stuff.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Belgian Dark Strong Ale,94
22,30,Hellabeerguzzler,4.42,"Silver outlined label shows trois pitoles (three pistols) black on on crazy background. Very cool label. Always poured from a bottle into various glassware - this particular review based on a pilsener glass (sue me).  I found this beer has become one of my regulars. It's just outstanding to this reviewer's taste in every way and very drinkable.  The smell is just downright exceptional. It's bready, fruity, sweet and tart at the same time. It's a bit champagne but I just attribute that to the hints of dark fruits and spices. I did not think the head thin by any means and it pleasantly throws the aroma straight into my nose.  Taste does not disappoint and is noble and well done. It's dark enough but not heavy on the tongue. It tastes like it smells. Delicious and properly spiced, fruity breadiness.  Drinkability is very good as most belgian-style ales are.  The alcohol? It's present - but not enough to be remarkable in any way to this reviewer.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Belgian Dark Strong Ale,94

T - Mellow for a dark ale, but good malty-fruit flavor with a slight dry finish. Strong alcohol on the front. The Belgian yeast rounds out the flavor nicely, but with no real lingering finish like promised on the bottle.  M - Light-medium mouth feel. Very bubbley; almost champagne-like. I expected a little fuller mouthfeel from this dark ale.  D - It's a good beer, very drinkable, but it just seems like there's not enough there to make me wanna have another one.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Belgian Dark Strong Ale,94
22,30,rdilauro,3.95,"The more and more I try strong Belgium ales, the more I enjoy their complexity.  The initial pour was uneventful, it poured a nice dark brown/black with a good white creamy head. The aroma did not show any hops, but I got a strong pleasant amount of yeast. I might have detected a bit of orange and also some wooden oak.  The taste was very clean, no hops, just a good mouthful, a bit malty (or perhaps yeasty) What I found really great about this Ale, was the LOOONNNNG aftertaste. The taste lingered on and on, and it was something that you almost didnt need to take a second sip, since the first was was taking care of everything",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Belgian Dark Strong Ale,94
22,30,evanlarkin,3.97,"Appearance: Dark brown, similar to the color of the bottle. Through light more of a Dr. Pepper type color. That's also consistent with the head, which dissipated very quickly and left minimal lacing.  Smell: Belgian candy and a grapey flavor sticks out. It smells kind of like a dry champagne. I always find Belgian smells exciting, and this is no different.  Taste: Again, the flavor initially reminds me of a dry champagne. It gives way to dark fruit flavors and oranges. Lots of orange actually. Imagine a dry mimosa in a glass. Very different.  Mouthfeel: Bubbly and tingly. I have to make a champagne comparison for the 3rd category in a row.  Drinkability: Not 100% to my taste when I'm looking for beer, but I can certainly enjoy it. I see it as a solid Belgian style beer that lots of people who may not normally like beer could enjoy.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Belgian Dark Strong Ale,94
22,30,Dojima,4.09,"Poured into a tall wiezen glass. The beer actually looks a little darker than the bottle. Creamy, tan 2 finger head that never wanted to recede. Didn't think I could wait. Nice creamy lacing. Nose wafted of Belgian candy, brown sugar and of course a bit of alcohol at 9%. The taste was a hint of sweetness with a dark fruity taste that was similar to raisins and dates or figs. Carbonation spiraled from the bottom of the tall glass feeding bubbles in the head. At one point, this resembled a tan merangue head. I actually enjoyed this beer more than the other unibroue offerings. The taste wasn't too sweet and it dissipated soon after without leaving any funky after notes. I am a fan and think that there aren't too many other beers that hide the alcohol as well. I didn't really get a taste of alcohol even though I detected it in the nose. It would be easy to go overboard. I will continue to sample this one.

22,30,SkunkWorks,3.27,"Had on tap (or maybe cask, the menu wasn't clear) at Dek's in Rocky Point, NY. Served in a Trois Pistoles glass.  Look: reddish brown, almost purple, body. Its quite pretty but there's no head at all and consequently, no lacing. This might be an issue with the place but I'm not sure since a few other reviews I'm looking at indicate no head formation or lace.  Smell: caramel with some dark fruit, like fig, plum and dates. Bits of spiciness but that is subdued. The nose isn't as strong as I would like for a Belgian Strong Dark Ale. Its good but not great.  Taste: follows the nose. Dark fruit, plums, dates and figs, a bit sweet, dark caramel. Really, there's not a whole lot going on and those familiar, Belgian flavors I am looking for simply aren't there. A bit disappointed in this one. Not to say its bad but its certainly nothing impressive.  Feel: really, this is the biggest short coming of this beer. The body simply isn't style appropriate or pleasing in any way. It is way too thin, which is exacerbated by the fact that it isn't carbonated very well. Its way too light for the style. I understand that Belgian Dark Strong Ales aren't supposed to be big, thick or chewy, but this is thin even for the style. The body feels almost like its lightly carbonated fruit juice, not a beer.  Drink: I deliberately went slow on this, hoping to pick out some nuances as I went, but you could drink this easily if you wanted to. The light body helps with this. The question is, would you want to? For me, I wouldn't.  Overall, this was my first Unibroue beer and I was a bit disappointed. This beer just wasn't anything I look for in a Belgian Dark Strong. Maybe it was because it was on tap, but I've had BDSAs on tap before and loved them. Perhaps I'll give a bottle of this a try after I give some of Unibroue's other beers a chance, just going on Unibroue's reputation. Cheers!",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Belgian Dark Strong Ale,94
22,30,GarthDanielson,3.91,"Poured from a bottle into a tulip glass, the beer is an extremely dark, almost opaque amber-brown coloring with a bubbly, biege, airy head. On the nose, you get a whiff of the carbonation from the yeast in the bottle, as well as lots of dark fruit sweetness (plums and dates), and a little booze. The beer leaves a great lace along the glass as you move it around and drink. The beer is heavy, but crisp at the same time. Malty sweet flavors, with slight hints of spice to balance. Tastes like coriander, mostly, but it's too subtle for me to be sure. The fruit sweetness is a highlight along the molasses characteristics of the malt. Very heavy and robust flavors, but the light body does well to balance all of this. The aftertaste is extremely mild, with the slightest hint of spice and malt, but only a whisper. Clean, neat finish makes this one an easy drinker.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Belgian Dark Strong Ale,94

Its got that belgium banana, spice yeast thing going on as well. Has a nice malty and slightly buttery aftertaste just like La Fin Du Monde.  M: Medium to lighter body. Really high carbonation. It does have a decent, though light smooth/creamy feel going on.  D: Decent drinkability. Its good, but only something I can have once in awhile and that itch has been scratched after one.

Taste: Dark fruits right up front, raisen, plum and fig are all there. The Unibroue yeast strain is present in most of their Belgian dark ales and this is no different with a juicy fruit flavor.

The taste was complex with a clear roasted quality with a bit of sweetness, fruit and alcohol overtones.  Mouthfeel was a bit thin with the alcohol coming through more than it should, making me wonder if there should be a ""best consumed AFTER"" date on a beer like this. The ""best before"" date was early April 2013, 26 months off. Yeast flavors were also surprisingly subtle for a Belgian-style beer, making me wonder if the they were still not quite finished working (i.e. if this would have been better six months from now).  Drinkability was what really got to me on this, though.

It pours a coffee brown out of the bottle, not too dark, but darkens up considerably in the glass. The head was definitely not as big as I expected and attenuated fairly quickly. A complex malt in the nose, but not overwhelming...just well-balanced, with the above mentioned excellent yeast funkiness.  For the high alcohol, it's quite light and spritzy on the tongue, in fact surprisingly so, with earthy soft notes of caramel, but not too sweet. It's not an overly bitter beer, and the malt and yeast take a more dominant character than the hops, but that's about right for this style.  An excellent choice, will definitely drink again.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Belgian Dark Strong Ale,94
22,30,gabedivision,4.87,"Poured from 12oz bottle to a Duvel tulip glass. This beer pours dark very dark with a thin white head and white bubbles shooting to the top. Almost has the appearance of a dark cola or root beer, and has a nice crackling fizz . The smell on the nose is absolutely amazing, almost like fresh figs and berries chopped and sitting above your upper lip. Very rich,fruity and malty. Very strong spicy sweet, fruity taste with a nice presence of alcohol. This beer is extremely drinkable, delicious.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Belgian Dark Strong Ale,94
22,30,Gobzilla,4.08,"A: poured a dark brown in color with yellowish brown highlights that had a very thin head and left very little lacing sticking to the glass.  S: pretty weird but it smells like a flanders oud bruin consisting of tart qualities alongside oaky, vinegar, mild cherries, and slight citrus.  T: so the taste was of a BSDA with lots of belgian yeast flavors but had banana, dark fruitness, maple, brown sugar accents and a touch of caramel.  M: the brew was medium in body with nice bubbly carbonation which had a sweet, slight fruity, yeasty, and silky finish.  D: it was tasty drinking great and is probably my favorite offering from unibroue.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Belgian Dark Strong Ale,94
22,30,teromous,3.98,"A: Pours brown and quickly darkens to a black color in the glass. There is a very thick foamy white head that holds its own. Average lacing on the glass.  S: Smells a hint of vanilla and slightly floral. A little alcohol burn on the nose.  T: The flavor is simply amazing. It was very different from what I expected from the smell. It retained the slight vanilla flavor that was present in the scent, but the flavor is much more complex. There is a light malt flavor and a richness to the flavor. The aftertaste is great.  M: It's very smooth, almost like a beer made with oats. It fills every corner of the mouth and makes you want more.  D: This is very drinkable. It's subtle and very pleasant to drink. It's really that simple.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Belgian Dark Strong Ale,94
22,30,MoreThanWine,3.67,"Poured all head and took a long time to settle down. Very dark clear brown, kind of a VanDyke brown. Smell has yeast, a hint of smoke in my opinion, and dried fruits. Taste again is dried fruits with raisin and fig. Moderately rich body. To me this reminded me alot of DFH Raison D'Etre except that one's richer and cheaper.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Belgian Dark Strong Ale,94
22,30,Fenris244,4.22,"Stole a friends chalice(not literally) to pour this lovely beer into  Love the bottle, the art was really cool the foil wrapping not so much but it's what ever.  Nice 3 finger head that had decent retention leaves a thin lace. Due to the lighting it looked black but upon closer inspection it turned out to be dark red. Nice color I have to say  This was a very aromatic beer, right of the bat I could smell grapes, cherry, grains(wheat perhaps?) also could smell some of the alcohol. Very interesting  Sweet malt, cherry, almost like an over ripe sweetness as well. Not very bitter at all but just enough to balance the sweetness. I have a question though: where is the alcohol? They hide it remarkably well for the abv listed on the bottle.  Full in body and a little heavier than I would prefer but enjoyable nonetheless. This is most certainly a sipping beer and I'm fine with that.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Belgian Dark Strong Ale,94
22,30,veinless,4.2,"Poured a maroon/rust dark reddish brown with a solid amount of off white head that disappeared quickly.  Smells winy, with lots of dark fruit, a touch of chocolate, and that Belgian yeast yielding a tropical scent as well.  Taste is even better, as its an assortment of different fruit, but not exactly ""fruity"". Peach and currants are what I picked up, but there was a lot more too. Chocolate in there as well (although not the chocolate taste you normally expect).  Feel nice on palate, with the consistency of the beer (average/thick) allowing it to sit on your tongue and bring about a new flavor every couple of moments. Very drinkable beer, and a great offering from Unibroue overall.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Belgian Dark Strong Ale,94

D: This brew is divine and I continue to love this brewery. The alcohol is well hidden, often I split one of these with my father (he is NOT a beer drinker, but he agrees that this is amazing). This is mandatory pleasure for your palate.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Belgian Dark Strong Ale,94
22,30,tjsdomer2,4.25,"Appearance: Dark molasses. Very thick overall. Excellent lacing and it pours a fluffly, highly carbonated white head. Tempting to drink to say the least.  Smell: The closest beer I've had that smells like a strong red wine. Nice fruity acidity and definitely some black pepper. Very sophisticated and something that would tempt me to learn more about wine. The one difference with wine is that this that an earthy yeast smell as well. Extremely unique.  Taste/Mouthfeel: Initially there's a mild wine-like quality. As Three Pistols warms up, more distinct flavors of cherries and dark fruit come through. These fruity flavors balance well with a nice crisp bitterness as well. Mouthfeel is definitely exceptional. It transforms between creamy and bubbly and thin and acidic like wine. Extremely dynamic.  Drinkability: Strong like a nice wine and drinkable like a great beer.  Overall: Kind of a hybrid drink. 1 beer + 1 wine = 3 Pistoles.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Belgian Dark Strong Ale,94
22,30,miketyree24,3.24,"Probably my favorite from unibroue.  Pours very dark. Almost has the color of dark blood. Has a great fruity and slightly sour aroma of figs or raisens, possibly some peach. You can also get a very slight scent of alcohol. To be honest i kind of find the smell a bit overwhelming. So many smells and its kind of hard to pick out the individual hints of each. Tastes just as it smells. Alcohol does not hide itself from you and is very present from the beginning. After taste is fine as well. Easy to drink but wouldnt drink all the time. Really have to be in the mood to enjoy this beer.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Belgian Dark Strong Ale,94
22,30,henrysunset,4.28,"22oz bottle, unknown age  bottle had some settled sediment, but glass pored clean, extremely dark with moderate carbonation, huge head of medium bubbles.  scent is sour, sweet and powerful. True to belgian style this seems a bit wild.  flavor is rich and deep, smooth and a bit of peach and cherry, flavor mellows to that of chocolate nibs. not much to complain about here. This is taste.  mouthfeel is swooth and thick, coating the tongue with velvety flavor that lingers.  This is an excellent belgian dark. easier drinking than I expected, especially at 9%. No overwhelming alcohol tones, and I reviewed this on a clean palette.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Belgian Dark Strong Ale,94
22,30,jdg204,4.65,"Tried this a few weeks back on tap down in Texas and enjoyed it, so I was glad to get a second shot with my Unibroue mixed 6er from Wegmans.  A: Dark copper color with ruby highlights and a decent tan head that stuck around for a bit.  S: Dark caramel, pears, bananas, and a bit of cinnamon.  T: Starts with a caramel and fruity banana flavor from that Unibroue yeast. Next comes a range of dark fruit flavors, with a nice spiced finish.  M: Extremely smooth and easy to drink, you won't realize that this has 9% alc.  D: A lovely brew and the best of the style I've tried yet. Unibroue has an army of winners and this is amongst it's best, those French Canadians really know their Belgian brews. A must try, seek this one out.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Belgian Dark Strong Ale,94
22,30,JohnnyBarman,4.47,"750mL bottle brought back from a recent trip to Quebec. Though I've had Trois Pistoles many times before, this was one of the few opportunities I've had to enjoy this out of the corked bottle. As always, fantastic bottle artwork.  Poured into a Leffe chalice. A deep chestnut brew, almost the colour of a beer bottle. A slight ruby-auburn tinge when held to the light. A few chunks of yeasty sediment collect near the bottom of the class. The head isn't this brew's strong suit; after a few moments it dissolves into a thick ring, which creates some nice sheeted lacing.  Nose is yeasty and bready, with additional whiffs of cherry, chocolate, grape and spices.  Sweet, yet dry; rich, yet easily drinkable, Trois Pistoles is a brew full of wonderful contrasts. Begins with a bready, yeasty punch, followed by notes of dry white wine, caramel, chocolate, grape, cherry and spice. Finishes dry and tart.  Mouthfeel is creamy, slick, a touch watery, but still enjoyable. The carbonation crackles nicely on the tongue.  A bit thinner than Maudite, both in flavor and consistancy, but nevertheless, this is another fantastic offering from one of Quebec's finest breweries. Perhaps the most drinkable Belgian Strong you're ever going to encounter. While not as rich and hearty as others of the style, Trois Pistoles more than makes up for this in terms of sheer drinking pleasure.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Belgian Dark Strong Ale,94
22,30,FanofHefe,4.25,"Poured aggressively into a Chimay chalice. Nice two finger dark tan head over a dark brown body with some red tint. The head dissipates quickly leaving very little lacing.  Yeasty, spicy aroma, with sweet dark fruit notes, more plum and cherry than grape or raisin.  Delicious flavors following the aroma. Caramel and toffee tastes compliment to make it a rich tasting brew. Just enough tartness to balance the sweetness. Nice blend of flavors. Malt does not taste roasted or burnt opening up the other flavors nicely.  Mouthfeel is medium with a high level of carbonation in this pour. Fairly drinkable for the high abv. Dry finish like a good wine. Highly recommend this one.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Belgian Dark Strong Ale,94
22,30,bonkers,4.15,"I finally got around to reviewing this, 12 ounce bottle into a SA perfect pint glass. The pour is deep and dark, light fizzy white head, a bit of lacing. Lots of plums and sweet dark fruit on the nose. Taste like it smells, dark fruit, plums, dates, finishes with lingering sweetness. The body is medium, light carbonation. A good beer, would be better with a bit more body.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Belgian Dark Strong Ale,94
22,30,BigHeavy,4.4,"Poured from a 12 oz. bottle into a Rochefort goblet. Beer was served with Flemish Beef Stew (which used the beer as an ingredient).  A: Beer pours dark brown with some garnet around the edges when the light catches it. No real head formed, but there was a small tanish cap. Beer is fairly clear with limited particulate from the yeast. Incredibly pretty to look at in the glass.  S: Aroma is heavy on the dark fruits and caramel like sweetness. There is some pretty obvious alcohol in there as well. Maybe some faint spice as well?  T: Oh sweet Belgian-inspired elixir, just heavenly from the second it hits your tongue. Dark fruits, some roasted chocolaty notes, all balanced out with just enough herbal hops and alcohol. A little earthy. A delight to drink and savor.  M: Rich and creamy. A little bit chewy. The brew reaches all corners of your mouth.  D: While it is very easy to imbibe, you need to watch out as the ethanol will creep up on you. Most certainly a sipper, either with dinner, or a dessert beer.  O: Just a great Canadian interpretation of a Belgian Strong Dark Ale. Definitely in the top tier of BSDAs. A great compliment to Flemish Beef Stew. Trois Pistoles should be savored over about an hour, perhaps enjoying the Jayhawks pound some poor team.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Belgian Dark Strong Ale,94
22,30,DAllspaw,4.28,"poured from 12 oz bottle into Tulip. Eager to try and compare with Maudite, a big favorite.  great mahogany color with 2 inch head on pour which quickly dissipates.  taste is rich with raisins, figs, and caramel, very creamy finish as well, more so than Maudite. A bit reminiscent of Abt 12.  Alcohol is a bit too obvious, but doesn't detract, with any patience I will buy more and put away for a year. Another great from Unibroue.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Belgian Dark Strong Ale,94

Looks a bit more than mildly carbonated.  S - Smells of fruit and lots of sweet and carmely malts. I also get a slight nose of wood, oak and cherry maybe.  T - Lots of fruit and malts. Get a slight sour fruit taste and maye some peach and cherry.  M - Mouthfeel is light and carbonated. Leaves a good tingly feeling on my tounge. Has an almost wine feel.

22,30,Mora2000,4.12,"The beer pours a dark brown color with some nice red highlights and a huge tan head. The aroma is Belgian yeast, sugar, cherries, plums, alcohol and maybe a little bit of anise. The flavor is Belgian yeast and cherries, along with some candy sugar, raisins and some darker, but not roasted, malts. There is a little bit of spicyness in the flavor as well as some alcohol that is very warming. Very drinkable. Medium mouthfeel and medium carbonation. A classic Belgian-style ale that I could drink everyday.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Belgian Dark Strong Ale,94

Leaves some traces of lace on its way down.  S- Dark dried fruits... prunes and raison, and some yeastiness.  T & M- Im getting dark fruits and powdery, bready Belgian yeast. A bit of alcohol warmth on the way down, but overall well-masked. Medium-light body with nice smooth, crisp carbonation.  D- Body is light enough to drink a few, but i think the powdery yeastiness would have me limit this beer to one or two in a sitting.

The sweet smells makes it very appetizing.  T: Very excellent taste. Starts off with a sweet flavor of figs and dates maybe. The sweetness gives way to a more malty body and is followed up by a slight bitter finish. The bitter finish also has hints of the initial sweet flavor. Overall, it's a great balance of flavors.  M: Pretty thin beer. I was hoping for more, but when pooring, I pretty much expected a thin beer.  D: Very drinkable beer. Great taste, I could definitly drink a couple of these.

Taste- Lots the aforementioned fruit come through in the taste as well, a very malty, yeasty taste with a bit of alcohol and breadiness as well. Aftertaste is where alcohol comes through  Mouthfeel- Thick and almost chewy due to the bready malt, although not in an unpleasant way, dryness leaves me wanting more.

Sort of a yeasty funk, with some breadiness and sweetness.  Slightly yeasty tart at the start, moves to lots of dark fruits and malt sweetness. Chocolate dipped raisins would be a good descriptor.

The symbolism is confusing to say the least.  Appearance: From smoking *pop* to a turbulent, frothing head, this brew looks vicious. It settles down below an-off white cap; murky, reddish-brown under light.  Aroma: Grassy and a bit metallic, also spritzy.  Taste: Heavy toasted undertones slapped with a veneer of molten dark chocolate. It has a balanced spice profile, dark cherries, and caramel mid sip. The finish is sweet and slightly warming from the alcohol. Dry, chalky finish.  Mouthfeel: The deliciously chewy malt backbone is a pleasure to swish around my mouth. Medium to heavy-bodied.  Harmony: A very harmonious brew; zen almost. Flavors are rounded but not for lack of flavor. On the sweeter end of the spectrum.  Would I get it again?: Yes. It's very drinkable, but dense with flavor.  Bottled: ? (best before: 11-03-12) Served: December 18, 2010  Price = $7.99 at Witherspoon Wines",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Belgian Dark Strong Ale,94

The carbonation seemed decent but I opened a St. Bernardus afterwards and definately had the strong ""pop"" when pulling off the cork.  A: Pours like a Belgian, highly carb'd. Surprisingly tannish to whitish head, when swirled or poured it picks up more of the dark beer color then settles out whitish. The head has nice tight bubbles. Color dark brown bronze sides/miniscus turn yellowish when held up to a light.  S: Well-balanced, no overly candied smell, maybe a subtle fruit yeast tone. The smell is calm for a 9% dark ale, no overpowering tones to it.  T: Not high in sweet, malty, or hoppy flavors. Dry wine grape/fruit type flavor, slight earthy tone coupled with a little citrus on the finish. A thin beer, not thick, malty, sugary, or heavy on the stomach which is appreciated for a 9% ale.  M: Thin and smooth for 9% leaves my mouth very slightly dry ready for the next drink  D: I'm already halfway through the 750mL bottle and still studying the great characteristics of this beer. Highly drinkable  Post tasting note: I am a fan of Unibroue and Maudite is their #1 for me but this is a very close second.

Aroma wise, toasty malt, grape, and a hint of caramel. I also pick up stainless steel, or a copper note, basically metallic.  Taste is also white grape, yeast, metal, with a caramel finish. Also pick up some dry fruit.  Mouthfeel seems a bit thin for the style, but goes down easy, despite the abv, which is not really noticeable.  This was not the first time I've had this beer, and it could just be that my palate has changed, this was a bad keg, or just that the bottle is better (which I have also had)  Overall, while this may be harsh, I've had much better for the style, and this time around, I was not impressed.

22,30,TheBrewo,4.45,"This brew pours somewhere between deep maroon and dark brown. The head is one and a half fingers and is soft and cream colored. Not much light is let through, so carbonation and sedimentation is hard to assess. The aroma is fresh, with esters, ripe bananas, strawberries, clovey phenols, and light spicy malts doing most of the work. There is also the slightest alcohol vapor buzzing off of the surface. The esters are immediately apparent towards the front of the taste, with bitter red grapes as their mate. These mix through the middle with spice and heavy malts. This spice becomes more robust and more clove-dominant as it runs to the finish. Berries, fresh vanilla bean, and faint floral hops see the latter through to the bottom of the swallow. The aftertaste is clean, sweet, and a bit tart, as of fresh raspberries or some kind of citrus fruit. The carbonation is medium to high, but is not offensive. The body is medium, and the mouth is cooled but left slightly dry. It has a satisfying feel. The abv is higher and the beer is quite warming, but the beer drinks well.  Overall, what we liked best about this brew was the heavy esters and clovey phenols that are predominate in both the aroma and taste. It is highly complex with nice fruity inclusions, and is ultimately a great brew from a fantastic brewery.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Belgian Dark Strong Ale,94

A: Mahogany brown, enormous sudsy slightly off-white head, reddish hues in the light.  S: Dried dark fruits, alcohol esters overwhelm everything that is here, though. Nice subtle malty backbone with some peppery spice. Hops seem to be all but lost.  T: Burnt sugary crust, raisins, figs, overall very ""fruity"" (dark) profile here. Again, the hops are missing, though I'm not surprised. There's something about this that doesn't sit too well with me, though it may just be not my favorite style.  M: Pretty thin body, though the carbonation gives it a solid medium-bodied feel.  D: Not my style, I'm gathering. This flavor profile is overall too much for me -- the flavors seem balanced but they're not my preference.  I wouldn't buy this one again, but judging the beer for what it is, the mark is pretty dead on for a Belgian Strong Dark. I wish there was something else giving this a bit more depth than is displayed.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Belgian Dark Strong Ale,94
22,30,afinepilsner,4.17,12oz brown bottle  Trois Pistoles was dark brown with a beige head. The head was rather small and didn't last with very little lacing. The smell was dark malt and some dried fruit. The taste was full of dark malt and fruit flavors with a touch of peppery spice. It finished dry and throat warming.

Aroma is truly rank in that it smells like stale vomit.  Taste starts out on a bad note, specifically a metallic one. After that unpleasant introduction, flavors of dark fruit, raisins and plum begin to meld with caramel malts and bittering hops. Alcohol emerges with a decidedly bourbon-based character. Middle moves into suggestions of candied fruit and prunes. Finishes bitter and coarse with a scratch of husky grain.  Rich and full bodied with moderate carbonation.  Complex enough character once the ale eventually warmed, but too many strikes against it to fully embrace this offering.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Belgian Dark Strong Ale,94

S - Clove, signature unibroue yeast, plum, rum soaked raisin, fig, brown sugar, even more sweet candied fruits and maybe even a hint of chocolate covered cherry.  T - Spicy unibroue yeast with a rich maltiness, dark fruits that become over taken by a bitter/spicy combo. Toasted bread, candi sugar and more dark fruit. I think the unibroue yeast/carbonation actually take away from the flavor of this one.  M - Medium body with very prickly carbonation scrubbing the palette after each sip. Creamy but I think a touch less carbonation would help out hte flavor.  D - The carbonation makes it feel simpler than it is.

Alcohol smell is definitely present along with smells of dark fruit T: The alcohol on the nose is not present in the taste, but the fruits are also much less potent and only appear on the finish.  This is a solid beer with a great smell but the taste does not match up to it.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Belgian Dark Strong Ale,94
22,30,Erish,4.07,"I poured this 750 ml bottle into a Chimay goblet.  A: clear, dark mahogany color, fizzy tan head quickly falls into a persistent cap, good lacing.  S: clove, nutmeg, raisins, dates, plummy note, and a hint of Belgian funk.  T: dark fruits up front, quickly followed by spicy, ester-like middle, the finish is dry, spicy, and long lasting. I am glad I tasted this so soon after I tried the Rochefort 8. The Rochefort has the richness and the intangibles that make a perfect 5 for taste. Trois Pistoles is close, oh so close, but lacks just that little bit of depth and finesse that makes a good beer a great beer.  M: medium-bodied, silky, moderate carbonation.  D: This is a very good beer, but is not a bargain next to the real (Belgian) thing. I cannot see spending the same money for a lesser beer.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Belgian Dark Strong Ale,94
22,30,bylerteck,4.01,"341 mL bottle. Bottled M0309 which I assume is December 2009.  A - Almost black but appears a deep amber when held up to light. Thick, creamy, cloud like head that is going nowhere appears beige. Lot's of carbonation. Cloudy. Insane lacing going down leaving layers of foam all around the glass except where I've been drinking. Cap of half a finger of head remains throughout. Great, great, great looking beer.  S - Lot's of yeast. Sort of a molasses character. Lively aroma.  T - Molasses and dates I think. Yeast comes out right before the finish. Sweet in the finish. Lingering dark fruit flavours. Methodical almost.  M - Carbonation is appropriate. Medium bodied. I would expect more body for something like this.  D - I could rock this stuff as a session beer no problem. Delicious.

The beer itself is very dark auburn, however, does filter light. Hard to tell carbonation levels.  Smell - strong grape presents as well some nice earthy tones. This beer is a very distinct smell. You can also pick up some hints of spices and faint caramel.  Taste - nice tasting beer that leaves a warm feeling in your throat. The beer really brings fwd the dark fruits as well the earthy tones. There is a slight hint of sweetness, but you gotta go looking for it.  Mouthfeel - the carbonation adds a velvet feel to this beer, really takes over the mouth. The taste of dark fruits as well some burnt caramel comes fwd. The aftertaste remains the same with a warming feel.  Drinkability - This has been a great beer to end a decent beer drinking day!

22,30,hawks10,3.53,"12oz bottle - Best before January 16th, 2010 - Probably means this was bottled January 16th, 2009, almost two years old when I drink it - Poured into my Trois Pistoles chalice...  When poured, the beer appears black, but up to the light you see some dark ruby red and plum colors, very nice looking actually. Two fingers of light tan head forms and quickly recedes into a cap of haze, a bit of lacing is left behind...  Aroma is rich with dark ripe fruits, sweet and malty, caramel and toffee. Slightly surprised to smell some hints of chocolate and roasted malts, which cut slightly into the dark fruit/sweet aromas. Just the littlest amount of Belgian yeast spice shows up in the nose as well...  Taste follows nose, sweet, dark fruits and raisins. A little alcohol heat mixes with a strong spice at the tail end. Caramel and chocolate malts really show through in the middle of the drink, slightly bittering the beer a bit and cutting into the sweet (almost too much so) dark fruits upfront. Belgian yeast shows up after a few sips and alcohol starts to show through more and more...  Medium bodied, a bit thinner than I would like, with a good amount of prickly carbonation. Beer still drink slick. A bit of some booze burn towards the end and a slight, weird sweet fruit aftertaste...  Not bad, this used to be one of my favorite beers, haven't had it for about a year, until this review. Can't help but be a little let down by my old standby, sweetness was a bit too much with a weird lingering fruity aftertaste, too thin mouthfeel as well...",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Belgian Dark Strong Ale,94

22,30,mariposafan,4.67,"Pours a deep, super-dark brown - almost completely opaque - with a fluffy creamy head that dies down to moderate lacing over time.  The aroma is dark, fruity and spicy with Belgian yeast mixing in.  Taste is a little sweet, a little bitter, rich, fairly malty and somewhat spicy with a taste of cloves. There's also the taste of dried fruit - raisins and maybe figs.  The mouthfeel is medium, maybe a little lighter than that but with excess carbonation. Creamier would have been better.  It's pretty potent and pretty rich - definitely one a night for these.

Clean finish M: Silky from high carbonation. O: Well balanced. Neither the sweetness, fruitiness or spiciness is overwhelming. The best part about it is the clean finish, which is hard to find in beers of this style, and makes it delightfully drinkable.

22,30,UTCengOwl,3.53,"Had this from a 12 oz bottle from a four pack that my mom bought. Gotta love coming back for Thanksgiving. Served in a wine glass.  The beer appears dark at first, but when held up to he light, it shows itself to be clear and brown with some hints of pink and orange color coming through. The head is a homogeneous tan with small, tight bubbles. It's not as creamy as I'd like and it dies down a bit quickly, but it leaves a nice layer across the told and some lacing down the glass.  The nose is surprisingly sweet. Yes, there are the standard Belgian fruits and spices, but there's something strangely sweet here.  The taste is also sweet. There's some depth here... fruits, drier spices. Not as bold as their other BSDAs, but it's not an unwelcome change. The only real negative comment I hae here is that sometimes it leaves a strange aftertaste... something with the fruits.  The moufeel is ok, but not great. A bit thinner than I was expecting. It's definitely not magic on my palate.  The beer isn't all that drinkable. There's a reason that my mom wasn't able to finish the four pack and she's been getting interested in BSDAs. I may need to steer her back on course with a La Terrible.  I had high hopes for this beer, but it ended up being my least favorite Unibroue offering that I've sampled (aside from an Ephemere). I'm surprised the ratings were this high.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Belgian Dark Strong Ale,94

S - Yeast is most present but there are some great fruity notes here. Some sweet raspberries, with some dark plums. Very nice.  T - Yeast is up front followed by a great layer of flavors. There is some raspberries, blueberries, and plums. There are some slight citrus and grass notes followed by a subtle hop tingle that finishes this ale off wonderfully.

A Belgian spicy yeast tingle mingles in as well.  The mouthfeel is medium to full bodied with a nice carbonation bite and smooth finish. Alcohol is well hidden but apparent as it warms.  Overall this is a very good Belgian dark ale, but one of the lighter tasting versions I have experienced. A distinct apple/grape white wine qualities. Excellent nose, flavors, and mouthfeel.

Ripe dark fruits (cherries and red grapes) with an earthy musk.  Sweet cherries and red grapes that reminds me of port wine. Rich Belgian candi and malt with just enough spice and pepper to keep things interesting. I'm always impressed that a beer of this color, complexity and depth can come without roasted grains.  I'm surprised, but the mouthfeel is a little thin and the carbonation is strong.  This is a fantastic beer and once again I'm impressed with Unibroue! Such beauty and depth to this beer.

Smell is mild, mostly a fruity malt character. I'm putting my nose way down in the glass, but it is hard to get a strong impression. Taste brings in plums, raisins, and a hint of cherry. There is that distinctive Unibroue yeast flavor. Every Unibroue beer I have had has the same dry and estery yeast profile. To finish out the flavor there is a mild chocolaty malt.  Mouthfeel has a medium body, a little thick but not too heavy. Carbonation is mild, just enough to keep the body from being syrupy. Together it creates an image of Fall leaves.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Belgian Dark Strong Ale,94

This is followed up with a yeasty presence.  M - not too much here, other than it being of a highly carbonated nature with little aftertaste  I'm not a huge fan of the style, but every essence of this is a credit to the style itself",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Belgian Dark Strong Ale,94

The aroma is a great blend of dark cherries, bread, caramel, and banana.  The taste has a quick spiciness, cloves I think, followed by a caramel malt component and then the bread/yeasty tail. Some alcohol present as well.  Mouthfeel has a medium body and a effervescent carbonation that dulls quickly and leaves a solid dryness, particularly on the upper palate.  This beer is definitely drinkable but lacks something that makes it truly stand out or allows it to be a session beer.

I love the sweetness and am hopeing it comes through in the tastes.  T - Loving the taste of this. Lots of fruit and malts. Get a slight sour fruit taste and maye some peach and cherry.

S - Classic Belgian scents with cloves, cinnamon and all-spice coming through and finishes with fruity notes of apple and banana.  T - The spices dominate with cloves and cinnamon followed by caramel malts. The apple and banana mask the alcohol, which is nicely hidden. Definitely a complex flavour mix on this one, making for a memorable experience.  M - Nice medium body that finishes a tad dry. Nothing offensive here.

Lots of dark malt, fruits (plum, etc), brown sugar, a little medicinal.  M: Sparkling carbonation, hits pretty hard up front but mellows out to show the flavor complexity. Finishes very smooth and it's nice an dry. Just a bit viscous, enough to just coat the mouth.  D: The alcohol hits pretty hard but the after taste is pleasant (like a good red wine) enough to keep my sipping this all night.

Fruity sweetness. Slightly metallic aftertaste? -but very faint.  M: The sweetness gets a little sticky, but the carbonation is a nice contribution to the flavor.  D: Quite drinkable.

Also present were yeasty, dark dried fruits, spice, and malty notes.  T-Mild spice and dried fruits like dates. Also some caramel as this is sweeter rather than fruitier. Lighter taste than I expected for the BSDA style. Good, but not great.  M-Very smooth for 9.0% ABV but a little light. Not rich and creamy enough.

Bubbles srub the palate to some extent, but there's only so much lifting of the palate carbonation can do when there's so much flavor. The alcohol comes through strongly.

Lots of fruit, earthiness, black pepper, and grass. You can only hope that the taste is even half as big or complex as the aroma.  Taste: Unfortunately it's not. I'm not sure how there's such a large disconnect between the smell and taste but all at that wonderful fruit is not here and the spice is largely gone.

22,30,Reaper16,3.42,"12oz. bottle served into a globe glass  Pours a chestnut brown color that appears significantly lighter -- ochre, almost -- when held up to direct light. One finger of buttermilk head forms but not for very long. Not much lacing to speak of, which surprised me. All in all this is a very average looking BSDA. The BSDA I homebrewed recently looks better and I am not a good homebrewer.  Trois Pistoles is a sweetness bomb. Tons of caramel, brown sugar, earthy candies that are derived from cocoa but don't taste like chocolate. Some dark fruits but not nearly as many as I expected. There is an herbal element too. The taste of this beer follows the nose. That herbal, earthy smell manifests itself as a sort of peppermint & forest floor (to borrow a wine term) character. So much malt that I get flashbacks of malt extract. The finish has a rounded, oxidized sweet finish reminiscent of port. This is complex enough. Is it ""good?"" Not for me, perhaps. I think that it is missing something. I also don't appreciate the alcohol taste. It is very apparent and, frankly, harsh.  Too much carbonation for a beer this malty. It goes well beyond breaking up all the sweetness -- it forces a super-abrasive, super-bubbly effect not dissimilar to the mouthfeel of Dr. Pepper. The strength of the carbonation disrupts one's enjoyment of the malt sweetness. Still, the beer is a very decent sipper. It isn't taxing at 9%ABV.  I was really expecting more from this beer. This score seems harsh, but at the same time I really feel that this is barely above average in the Belgian Strong Dark Ale style.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Belgian Dark Strong Ale,94
22,30,wspscott,3.52,"750ml bottle in Duvel tulip best by 10/14/11  A: Pours with a thick almost pure white head that drops to a half finger surprisingly quickly given how thick it starts. When held up to a bright light, it is crystal clear and a very dark brown. Without the light, it appears completely black and is impossible to see through. Basically looks like a standard example of the style without the head retention. S: Definite Belgian spices combined with a little bit of sweetness, smells great. T: Lots of spices, some pepper, no hint of hops or malt, this is all yeast driven flavor. There is no hint of alcohol which is a little surprising. I would like a little more character from the malts, this is missing some of the ""darkness"" that I like. M: High carbonation and a low amount of residual sugars put this right in the middle of the style, i.e. almost too easy to drink, the only thing that slows me down is a hint of dryness on the tongue, make that a ton of dryness. D: This is an good example of the style, but I would like a little ""more"". From what I remember, I like Maudite better, going to open one of those next for comparison. Well worth trying for someone who likes Belgians.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Belgian Dark Strong Ale,94
22,30,OWSLEY069,3.7,"Pours a dark brown-ish color to almost black. In the aroma, roasty malt, white grape fruitiness, ad a caramel like hint. In the taste, white grape sweetness, and a bit boozy, and a caramel like end. A smooth and medium to bigger bodied mouthfeel, with a semi dry fruity aftertaste. A bit boozy, and a nice fruit presence. Not too shabby.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Belgian Dark Strong Ale,94
22,30,beerdrinker123,3.94,"It pours a dark, murky amber color with a nice amount of bubbly white head.  It has a dark fruit aroma followed by some other earthy undertones and spices, its not overpowering, but sweet and subtle.  It has a really complex flavor that is a combination of maltyness and dark fruit. It starts sweet and finishes on the bitter/sour side. The dry aftertaste is very pleasant.  It has a fair amount of carbonation that balances the alcoholic kick that this 9% abv puts out, but is still smooth and relatively drinkable.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Belgian Dark Strong Ale,94
22,30,SPThirtyThree,3.13,"Unibroue is always good with presentation, and Trois Pistoles is no exception, with its wicked label and printed foil on the cap. I've never bothered to try this one before, but it sounds enticing. The label claims that it's a ""remarkably mellow dark ale with the aroma of ripe fruit and a pleasant aftertaste that lingers like port wine.""  A: The bottle perfectly fills my snifter to the rim upon pouring. TP is a rich, espresso brown that lets just a glimmer of light through around the murky edges. A tan three-finger, frothy head sits atop. This brew looks great. It leaves a little lacing as the head falls to a mousse-like cream.  S: Trois pistoles' aroma is delicious. The label did not lie: blending with the spicy clove smells from the Belgian yeast are notes of raspberry, plum, orange, and banana. A delicate Belgian pils malt provides the backing for the fruit and spice, and a hint of chocolate malt lingers in the background.  T: Slightly sweet malts are quickly lost to flavors of pepper. No one spice stands out, but rather, a muddled, musty spice is all that is detectable. The three guns are sweet at first, but a dry and slightly sour finish follows. Overall, the flavor is surprisingly light, with a little caramel, pepper, some fig, and a touch of green apple. The flavors give way to a subtle, warming alcoholic heat. I must admit, the flavor falls well short of the aroma and appearance.  M: High carbonation causes burpage and makes the eyes water.  D: Medium. Nothing exceptional, but very drinkable. The bark was definitely bigger than the bite, as the flavor and mouthfeel missed their mark.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Belgian Dark Strong Ale,94

Good solid beer.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Belgian Dark Strong Ale,94
22,30,punkrkr27,4.16,"Dark mahogany colored pour with a massive, frothy, off-white head. Creamy dark fruit aroma with notes of toasted nuts, cocoa, raisin bread, clove, nutmeg, port, and some lightly floral funk. The flavor is a nice delicate balance of figs, plums, candi sugar, cocoa, almond, bread, raisins, and a little bit of alcohol with a floral spiced finish. Velvety medium body with moderate but soft carbonation.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Belgian Dark Strong Ale,94
22,30,BBP,4.45,"A- Thick dark brown with good carbonation and a good head which worked it's way down to a thin head/film.  S- Tons of Belgian yeast. Grape and plums as well.  T- Belgian yeast, and quite a bit of fruitiness. Plums and grapes for the most part. As much as the yeast was the heaviest aspect of the aroma, the fruits are very dominant in the taste. The aftertaste even reminded me of wine a little bit. More of a sweet beer, but in a very tasteful way. The yeast balances it quite well, and keeps it in check.  M- Full bodied, and relatively creamy. Finishes nice and dry.  D- Another excellent offering from Unibroue. As much as I gave a higher rating to LFDM, I think this one may have been tastier, just not as nice to smell. ABV is even more minute, and even seemingly un-existent, from the taste in this.  I plan to pick this up whenever I can get a hold of it.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Belgian Dark Strong Ale,94

S: I get a little bit of brown rum but in a good way.little chocolate. Touch of roast. Almost no esters which is unusual for the style. It also has this smell that I finally decided was like putting caramel in a sauce pan for 30 seconds. Little bit more spicy once it warms up.  T: Starts off with a nice sweetness. Only the slightest hint of the ABV. Candi sugar. Little bit of like 85% cocoa chocolate. Dry as part of the taste. Little bit of dark fruit in the finish.  M: Wonderful mouthfeel. Smooth. Creamy. All of their beers always have a great mouthfeel for the style.  D: It is a sipper in a lot of ways but it drinks like a champ. The body is so smooth and the ABV is well hidden.

22,30,joepais,4.65,"This is the brew that got me hooked on the style. The price point is right and availability is awesome. It is really great to see it get some props.  Bottle poured into its proper challis produced a wonderful off white head that trails to a perfect amount of lace. The body of the brew has some great colors the edge of the brew is almost orange and the body of the brew is dark brown to black. You get a huge amount of dark fruits coming from it. Dates, plums and raisins come to mind not only in the nose but in the flavor as well. This is the closest brew I have ever had that reminded me of a port wine. You get that complex sweet fruity taste the just get better as it warms. The mouthfeel even comes off like a good port, thick and rich.  Yup a great brew worth the time to try. It is a fantastic desert brew. The price cant get any better for the quality of the brew.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Belgian Dark Strong Ale,94
22,30,Ricelikesbeer,4.26,"One of my favorite strong darks. To me this is a standard as a brewer for this style.  A:Murky, almost purple in color. Dark Dark brown with faint ruby highlights. Murky from the yeast.  S: Dark rum, lots of plum aroma, and some boozy alcohol scent. Almost reminds me of a chocolate colored cherry or other fruit. Very fruity in the aroma.  T: Initial plum, fruit sweetness. Lots of layers here. This reminds me of drinking an aged port or even some dark rum. Also reminds me of eating a certain type of candy, can't put my finger on it exactly. Just a faint hint of chocolate or dark kilned malt.  M: Medium to full body, its somewhat chewy, but still goes down smooth. The high level of carbonation (as is typical of any Unibroue beer) helps this one to go down easy.  D: Despite the high alcohol, body, and huge carbonation, this one is very drinkable and smooth. No harsh bitterness or aftertaste. Coats the tongue and makes you want more and more.  Overall an excellent brew. Rivals any belgian strong dark I've had.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Belgian Dark Strong Ale,94

Strong malt body, very remiscent of plums, with a hint of chocolate in the background. Very sweet to the nose. Slight hop aroma with a touch of alcohol in the far background.  Strong grainy malt flavor throughout. Alcohol is present, but kept in the background behind the earthy malts. Bits of chocolate and toasted bread. Spicy character (pepper) from the alcohol.  Medium carbonation with a good mouthfeel.  Alcohol becomes more noticeable as it warms but is kept well hidden.  Very hearty and quite delicious throughout.

Not very sure about chocolate or caramel. Yet the aroma is decently complex, and nice. But nowhere close to exceptional!  Taste 3.5/5 Vinous taste that promptly gets covered by the prickly carbonation. The bitterness seems discordant, or the dark fruity sweetness is simply not enough. The aroma was certainly better than the taste: they are similar but the fruitiness of aroma was way higher. I would call this an average tasting beer. Finish is slightly sweet and long. Slightly warming.  Mouthfeel 4/5 Medium body and medium to high carbonation. Good.  Drinkability 4/5 While slightly disappointing considering the fame, very drinkable.

Medium bodied with moderate-to-high carbonation. Seemed a little overcarbonated to me; will have to give it a more vigorous pour next time.  9% ABV is hidden well with just a gentle warming finish.

Nose is of dark cherries, taste has cherry as well alongside some dates and faint barleywine taste. Mouthfeel is unassuming; not heavily carbonated, but there is enough present to keep it from being wine. Taste seems... watery? Could be that I failed to dry the glass after washing, but still. Dangerously 'drinkable,' even sessionable; flavor is not potent at all considering the ABV; curious. Flavor improves on the second pour; likely some slight agitation will improve flavor overall.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Belgian Dark Strong Ale,94
22,30,radioscooter,4.16,"I was introduced to this wonderful ale by a friend of mine who stumbled upon it at a bar. He knew I liked Belgians and told me about it. This was a few years ago.  Now, I don't know if you're like me - God help you if you are - but when a friend who I consider less of a beer aficionado than me tells me about a beer - I take it with a grain of salt. Ho ho, I think, what does the precious Coors drinker think is so special now?  Yes, I know. I'm generally an ass like this.  Anyway, my friend tells me this is a beer worth putting down whatever you are doing and seeking out. So I did.  Happily surprised that he was right and this is an excellent example of the breed. I haven't had this in a while and so hadn't reviewed it here and then last night I brought out a 750 of this and one of Westmalle (triple) for a campfire at a neighbor's house.  First off let me say - it kicked the Westmalle's ass. This is a good thing in many ways. Trois Pistoles is imminently more available and cheaper than many of the classic Belgian Strong Darks around here and so - it has become a bit if a 'go-to' beer for me.  But it's not perfect.  Poured from a 750 into a Chimay goblet.  A. Looks great, dark brown, translucent. Modest froth - unimpressive lacing.  S. Not much here. At least when cold it is not a strong fragrance.  T. Excellent taste. Immediate hints of apricot, coriander etc. Nice malty finish.  M. Just okay, though I will bring up here that I usually let Belgians warm up for 15 minutes and this one is excellent and better when it's cold. Warmer it loses its complexity and sheen.  D. Very drinkable. I had a keg of this for my annual family/friends party and it was never too heavy or crushing to keep drinking. it did put my bus. partner into a bit of a stupor coma, but nobody warned him.  If you love strong, dark Belgians and are looking for one that's more available and affordable - you can't do wrong with this Quebec brew. It outshines many a 'real' Belgian.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Belgian Dark Strong Ale,94

This beer had a sweeter taste comprised of cherries, sour grapes, Belgian sugars and figs.  Mouth: The mouth was a bit thinner than the beer's appearance would have you believe.

A clear, reddish tinged, dark hazelnut brown with a crown of dense head populated with a myriad of tiny bubbles.  Floral and herbal on the tongue with a fruity medley in the middle (juicy plums and nectarines come to mind) that signals a supple exit to a sweet yet drying finish; some nutmeg as well. The tongue drying just increases the desire for another sip.

22,30,bohemiandonut,4.13,"On appearance alone, this is a knockout. Dubbel dark wavelengths bordering on reddish/burnt orange. Absolutely creamy ochre head settles quickly from about three fingers height.  Smell is delightfully Old World Red, Chimay Blue and mellow spice. Some hint of banana and clove but generally black cherry, goji, and date. Dark honey sweetness. A hint of vodka is somewhat disconcerting, but I almost like it.  This is indeed what a good port wine should taste like. Slightly grassy/peppery, with the sweetness of strawberries soaked in brandy. A bit of oak appears, not extravagantly. Everything about this beer is subtle subtle subtle.  Mouthfeel is definitely where this beer excels. Smooth and creamy but not sticky, almost ""thin"" in a counterintuitive way. Carbonated half-n-half? I'm usually not a fan of minimally carbonated beers but this is almost too good to be true. Finishes quick but perfect. Such an accomplishment.  Unibroue often falls short for me when I pit it against the big boys, most notably with Fin du Monde. Trois Pistoles on the other hand is a welcome addition to the world of BSDAs. Less aggressive than Huyghe, smoother than Bernard. Not necessarily ""better"" mind you, but it fills a space that no other beer quite manages to fill. Prost!",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Belgian Dark Strong Ale,94

S - smells of dark fruits, especially black cherries, currants, and plums. Smells fresh and clean. Reminds me of some red wines.  T - Fruity notes like black cherries and grapes up front, with a nice malt backbone that contributes toasty brown bread and brown sugar flavors. Belgian yeast throughout. Musty red-wine like flavors at the end with a definite alcohol flavor.  M - good carbonation and body. The feel is not too oily, and the finish is a bit dry, which I like. The dry finish makes it more drinkable.  D - Quite drinkable for the ABV.  A solid offering from Unibroue. I enjoy their pale Belgians a bit more, but Trois Pistoles is a great beer if you're looking for something darker or to pair with dessert. I'd imagine this would be heavenly with some fruit-laden Crème Brulée.

22,30,DesMoinesMike,4.53,The body is nice and thick. It's a cloudy brown that's very hazy creating a boatload of head. This is certainly a complex with a lot of flavors mixing together. There is some banana bread and what seems like some plumb and a touch of lemon. Think of it as a slightly toned down version of Aventinus that doesn't require as much chewing.

Very roasted and toasted flavors. Not very sweet actually. Slight fruity twist to it. Finish has some sweetness to it, and the aftertaste is roasted with a blueberry syrupy chocolate flavor to it. M: Very airy mouthfeel, almost spongey carbonation. Medium body with a faint trace of alcohol in the finish, especially as the beer warms.

Smell: Malt, dark fruits, cherries, caramel and the slightest hint of booze.  Taste: Dark fruits and a bit of malt are evident up front. It has hints of pepper. On the back end you get cherries and sweetness.  Mouthfeel: This beer has an awesome soft mouthfeel. The carbonation is perfect. It leads to a slight peppery mouthfeel but not enough to be too much like other BSDAs that I've tried.  Drinkability: The alcohol in this beer does become evident, but in no way is it too much.

22,30,NODAK,3.7,"Aroma here is fairly sweet with dark fruit and perhaps a hint of spice.  Pours nearly black in the glass with little head.  Taste is mostly of dark fruit first, then a more citrus taste, reminicent of orange, upfront and through the body. There's some more fruit sweetness and molasses at the finish as well, along with a faint smattering of bitterness. Mouthfeel seems to be fairly thin considering style. Alcohol isn't all that noticeable, surprisingly. Looking at other reviews, I expected a boozier experience.  It's an interesting beer. Not my favorite within the Unibroue family, but a respectable one. For the ABV, it's very drinkable.

Quite sweet with just a hint of spice in there as well. M- Light initially but finishes more full bodied. Highish carbonation, which is something I'm not usually a fan of in this style, but for some reason it didn't detract much here. D- I really enjoyed this. Unibroue is one of those breweries that doesn't make a bad beer. While Maudite and Fin Du Monde are more towards my liking, this beer definitely has the goods in its own right. A bit of aging could help this one as it seemed pretty hot.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Belgian Dark Strong Ale,94
22,30,DavoleBomb,3.7,"Poured into an snifter.  3.5 A: Dark brown in color. One finger of frothy light tan head that falls fairly quickly and doesn't leave much lacing.  3.5 S: This one needed to warm up quite a bit before the aromas started poking out. Plenty of fruitiness: plum, grape, and raisin. There's even a touch of citrusy lime in there. Also a touch of solvent. Pleasant, but fairly weak.  4.0 T: Taste for the most part follows the nose. Dark fruitiness with plum, grape, raisin, and prune. Some toffee in there as well. The malts are okay, but somewhat boring. The good part about this beer, as in most Unibroue beers, is the yeast. They use a wonderful strain. Peppery and a unique yeastiness not really found anywhere else.  3.5 M: Lighter medium body. Perhaps a touch too much carbonation, but I do like the spritziness. This could use a bit more body. Otherwise very smooth.  3.5 D: This is a pretty tame beer overall and one that just about anyone could enjoy. Indeed, I enjoyed it, but it isn't mindblowing. I love the flavor of Unibroue yeast, but prefer it in a better application (such as Maudite).",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Belgian Dark Strong Ale,94

Dark fruit tastes dominate the palate, with some subtle malt flavors and mild hop bitterness. Finishes with a nice touch of alcohol spiciness.  M: Starts out lighter than expected, medium carbonation. Finishes with a bit of a thicker feel, lingers on your tongue.  D: Very easy and pleasant to drink. Doesn't need any accompaniments.

22,30,nataku00,4.18,"A 12 oz bottle poured into a tulip glass. A dark brown ale with an initial finger of tan head. Very little lacing of fairly persistent head while drinking it.  Nose is strong dark dried fruit (plums, raisins, dates), toasted malts, and dark brown sugar.  Taking a sip, the taste is dark fruit with the alcohol presence making itself known right away, but it melts into a yeasty sweetness mid tongue and finishes long on the back of the tongue with maltiness.  Medium body beer lingers on your tongue with the fruitiness, encouraging the next sip to reacquaint your tongue with the beer.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Belgian Dark Strong Ale,94
22,30,r0nyn,3.87,"Split with and courtesy of fellow BA infi. Poured into a Duvel snifter.  Appearance is a dark, dark reddish brown that just barely lets light in around the edges. A good pour creates a white frothy head that leaves a lot of sticky lacing. Yeast can be seen suspended in the brew if you look hard enough. Initial sniff yields a huge sugary and fruity smell right off the bat. Figs, dates and plums. Subsequent sniffs reveal some crisp maltiness along with some subdued alcohol. Really nice smell.  Taste is initially very subdued, which is surprising, given the fact that this is classified as a Strong Dark Ale. There's malts, then some very subtle fruit from the nose. Transitions into a boozy warmth that kind of creeps up on you, as there isn't an alcoholic bite. Pretty alcoholic, but there's no aftertaste and it finishes smooth enough. Mouthfeel is pretty light and clean, nothing to complain about, but not what I was expecting out of a beer like this.  Drinkability is pretty good, as it's a very nice-smelling beer with a decent taste follow-up. The booziness isn't masked all that much, but it's not an overpowering alcoholic quality, making Trois Pistoles easy to drink. Just be prepared to be a bit surprised. I know I wasn't.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Belgian Dark Strong Ale,94
22,30,infi,3.58,"12 oz. bottle, best before 12-03-12.  Poured into a snifter.  Appearance is a translucent maroon pour with moderate carbonation trails throughout the glass. On top formed a thin white head of fine bubbles that left a decent amount of ringed and speckled lacing around the middle of the glass. The smell was predominantly full of the candied Belgian sugars and boozy 9% heat with subtle hints of malt. Not too much overall on the nose.  Taste is fairly sweet and bready, notably from the malts, and on the back end is a substantial boozy heat. The alcohol truly makes its presence known - a bit too hot for me, compared to other BSDA's I've had. Overall, the flavor profile is very unilateral and not as complex as I'd like.  Mouthfeel is medium-bodied and silky. And drinkability is moderate and very easy to finish. The score suffers due to the slight muted flavors in the taste. Not bad, but not the best BSDA by Unibroue.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Belgian Dark Strong Ale,94

About average retention that settles into a sticky thin layer of lace.  S - Nice rum/port soaked dark fruit with plum, fig, date and some raisin. Hints of bubblegum as well. Fair amount of dark roasted malt and candi sugar. Some slightly burnt brown sugar and a bit of yeasty aroma.  T - Lighter flavors for the style, but similar to the nose. A good amount of dark fruit (see above with plum being strongest). Sweet, juicy taste with a good amount of sweetness. A fair amount of yeast flavor also comes out. Fair amount of roasted malt. Bitterness and sweetness mix together well with sweetness definitely winning. A touch of spiciness as well along with some alcohol heat.  M - Lighter medium body with about average carbonation. Light, spritzy feel for the style with a touch of stickiness on the finish.  D - Fairly drinkable with a good amount of flavor. A little on the light side, leaving me wanting of a little more substance.  Notes: Pretty good beer, but a little light (on both flavor and body) for the style. Nice rum/port like flavors in the background. Didn't taste extremely Belgian, but was tasty.

T - Flavors everywhere....starts out a little flat/tight but opens up to a strong raisin flavor, figs, and tart apple. Finishes with a warm spiced wine/port flavor.

Flavor is very fruity with berries on the tongue up front. There are some dark malt flavors and mild spices towards the middle as well as figs. The finish is a bit thin to me, it leaves some fruitiness, light sweetness, malt and yeast.  Mouthfeel is medium with medium carbonation, though I thought the feel could be a bit more substantial.

Alot of flavor, this is one intense beer.  Mouthfeel - Amazing. All the flavors drenched your mouth, letting you enjoy searching out all the beer has.

It's hazy can see some yeast bits floating around a little. Pretty thick head, lacing is nothing to really write home about but it's better than average I'd say. Smell is strong, mostly of Belgian malts and yeast, some dried fruit smell too. Taste is about on par with the taste, but I think I like it a little better, it's really strong, bold. Smells of dried fruit as well, figs, maybe cherries or cranberry it's tart as well. A little bready as well, would be a great deer around the holidays. Mouthfeel is pretty good, could be better. Has sort of a medium feel overall. The yeast makes it a little bigger in my opinion. Overall the drinkablility is good can easily polish off a bottle if in the mood for a Belgian. I'm actually still in the process of learning to like Belgian Beers, I've found a few that I enjoy and this one was pretty good.

I can't make out much carbonation due to the darkness of the beer. There is a great amount of web like lacing on the glass, and the head sticks around for a few minutes.  Smell - The beer has first and foremost a sweet caramel and brown sugar scent. Also notes of coffee and molasses. It also has a pepper spice mix and the medicine like scent found in the other unibroue beers.  Taste & Mouth - The beer has a perfect amount of carbonation; it has a great mouth feel. There is a velvety smooth sweetness at first, black forest cake comes to mind. The sweetness stays to the finish but also with a s slight bitterness. It also provides a great warming feels due the high alcohol content. The porter flavours add an amazing dimension to this beer.  Drink - Truly world class, and perhaps the best of the Unibroue's beers I have had thus far. I would glady purchase this beer again.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Belgian Dark Strong Ale,94

It has a bit of dark fruit to it and a bit of spice as well. Petty flavorful and appealing aroma overall.  The taste is malty sweet with a moderate amount of dark fruit coming through. A little bit of a brown sugar sweetness seems to come through a bit. The finish had some subtle spices to it that blended very nicely into the malty flavors. A little warming alcohol is also present in the finish.  The mouthfeel is on the thicker side with a nice creaminess. Carbonation is moderate to slightly above average.

But it is a solid offering from Unibrow.  Dark reddish-brown with a tan head that takes forever to go down (again, it was shaken up).  Aroma is cola, red wine, raisins, spices, and Belgian yeast.  Has a sweet Coke-like taste with some dark fruit flavors and spices, and the alcoholic kick that you expect from a Belgian strong ale.  Full palate with lively carbonation.

22,30,AgentMunky,3.95,"Poured from a 12 ounce bottle into a Rochefort goblet.  A: Pours a very dark brown with a wine-dark ruddy hue. When held up to the light, an opaque core is surrounded by light brown translucence. Some very pretty head clings to the edges of the glass, and intricate lacing decorates the side of the glass.  S: I smell yeast, gentle spice, and fermented grapes. The smell isn't phenomenal, but gets a 4.0 because it is deep and rewarding. A wine-like aroma overall, which I initially dismissed, but continue returning to.  T: Oh, goodness. Better than I had hoped. The smell manifests itself almost exactly in the main body of the beer -- a fruity, winey flavour is emboldened by spices and balanced by a carbonated yeastiness which sticks to the shadows but is definitely present. The aftertaste is light, sweet, and reminiscent of communion grape juice.  M: Slightly sticky on the sides of the mouth and in the throat. Not necessarily a detraction; although it is in the character of the beer, I do not see what it adds to it. Otherwise Trois Pistoles is smooth, with scattered bubbles to provoke the senses.  D: Sweet, but quite drinkable. The 9% is not obvious in the taste, but the similarities to wine foreshadow the blow to come...Trois Pistoles can easily sneak up on you, especially if drinking from a 750mL bottle.

T: Pretty subdued flavor profile, but respectable. Ripe red fruit, with a sweet caramel malt backbone. Only enough hop character to balance the sweetness.  M: Medium body and medium to high carbonation. Crisp. I would prefer a bit more body on this beer, and a bit less carbonation.  D: Great drinkability for a 9.0 abv brew.

The flavor is excellent and only gets better as it warms. This beer is really an exercise in subtlety, with notes of raisin, molasses and toasty, buttery caramel malt, but nothing overwhelming. Everything blends quite nicely here. The label correctly describes this beer as ""mellow"". The finish is somewhat yeasty and phenolic. The mouthfeel could have used a bit more weight, in my opinion, but the carbonation is right on, and the drinkability is very good: think dark Tripel.

Taste - Malty belgian yeasts and spices dominate the taste. As I proceed to drink, the dark fruits come out more and more with each warming drink. Alcohol is well masked in the flavor. This is truly a great tasting Belgian dark ale.  Mouthfeel - Seems to be medium-high carbonated but it sits in the mouth with a particular smoothness. Warm sugary alcohol coat my throat with each gulp. Not bad.  Drinkability - This one isn't as drinkable as many 9% abv beers I have tried, but it isn't bad at all.

The alcohol is masked well, adding just a hint of spice. Everything is balanced nicely. Rum cake and cloves in the finish.  Mouthfeel: Medium bodied with medium-low carbonation and a dry finish. Just a hint of warmth from the alcohol.  Drinkability: Surprisingly drinkable, especially given the alcohol content.  Verdict: Thoroughly satisfying, Trois Pistoles has lots of character and depth with surprisingly drinkability given the potency. It's just shy of earning top marks.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Belgian Dark Strong Ale,94
22,30,impending,3.97,"Petaluma Taps - into a Trois Pistoles chalice. Poured with a minor head leaving little lacing, a murky brown with caramel highlights.  Everything about the aroma is a strong dark belgian - dark ripe fruits, cherries and figs, roasted dark malts, burnt dark crystal sugar, typical yeast and a minor whiff of alcohol. Unibroue's signature yeast is on display.  Very fine flavor but I was hoping to like this more than a B+ but the sweets are too forward for me. Very nice minor hot finish. I wanted the taste to closer match the near perfect aroma but the sweets dominated beyond what the aroma leads you to expect. Best as an after dinner drink not to be served with a meal if the focus is the food. cheers jd",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Belgian Dark Strong Ale,94

Alcohol content is very prevalent. Bit of an odd aftertaste.  Mouthfeel: Initially quite clean, however finishes fairly sticky. Moderate carbonation.  Drinkability: Due to the uninhibited alcohol taste, and the sticky aftertaste, this beer is fairly difficult for me to get through. Have to drink slowly and leaves me wanting more.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Belgian Dark Strong Ale,94

Well when going to put some beer in the fridge I spy a bottle of Trois Pistoles. The bottle is sticky....been through some wars apparently....and I have no idea how old it is. Seems like it still might be better than the Miller Chill that I just drank.  a- Pours a very dark almost black hole colour that only lets minimal light through. Very short lasting head.  s-malty, caramel, suggestion of some fruit...  t-I was kinda scared to taste it...but figured at 9% it was probably still drinkable. Still holds up I think. The malts, and caramel present in the taste but the fruity taste(over ripe plum?).  m-thick and heavy as one might expect from a 9% beer.  d-Suprisingly drinkable for it's ABV.

22,30,gboy515duo,4.6,"12 oz bottle into a pint glass  Trois Pistoles pours an extremely dark body filled with brown and red undertones.  The aromas it gives off are fruity and strong, followed by spices that come in stages. Plums, Apricots, Basil, Cinnamon, Nutmeg are all things I smelled.  When you drink it, first the spices hit hard, basil hitting up front, followed by cinnamon and a lot of other spices. Following that is the taste of sweet fruit and sticky malts. Finally, the hops.  The mouthfeel of this beer is very sharp, and leaves the sticky taste on your lips and tongue. The brewer says it is similar to a port wine, and although I disagree on flavor, it pairs with similar foods perfectly.  The best part about this beer is the high ABV and the ability to drink it.

T - Very bready with mild cookie dough flavors upfront, and lots of yeast flavors dominating throughout.

However, i was happily surprised with the texture of the beer and the underlying flavors that ranged from a sweet malt to a wine-like finish with hints of fruits. However, not in the sense of a beer brewed with fruit, rather a more distinct character and texture that I have not seen replicated since then.  Its not my favorite, but would gain a recommendation for sure.

Not smelling much else.  T - taste is great, very complex with that champagne subtlety but much more like a beer (obviously), must be the natural carbonation.

D - with a 750ml it takes a while to drink with appreciation, i would say this is a great beer to have on a special day, not something to break open on any old night. i would definitely drink this again, but honestly i would not go out of my way to get a hold of another bottle.  overall this was a good beer, but not top notch and unfortunately i was slightly disappointed in it, i was expecting much more, but still this was a good drink, and i enjoyed it.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Belgian Dark Strong Ale,94

Head dissipates fairly quickly. 3.5  S: you do get the typical unibroue tropical fruits, but it's in the form of a more refined smell like that I get in white wine- minerally tropical fruits as in a Riesling or Semillon perhaps. There's a fruity element which reminds me of red wines also. As it warms, also get a sort of custard/tropical fruits combo like that my nanna used to make for dessert. Again, it ties in with the unibroue theme but has a unique twist. Of all the beers I've had, this is the one which has reminded me of wine the most so far. As I smell more, I get a sort of cocoa/tobacco in the nose. Strange milkiness also present in the nose. 4  T: get a strange taste I can't quite put my finger on- vaguely minerally, milky. The taste is kind of reminiscent of red wine, but hard to describe. I think it might be the way red wine portrays red fruit elements which I am thinking of. That sort of sharp alcoholic fermented and demented raspberry/cherry. 4  M: silky, thick, almost winey. 4  D: this one grows on me.

22,30,Ragedman,4.07,"Pours a very dark brown, VERY dark, nearly black but you can still easily see light through it. Very thin head, off white/light tan color, leaves some lacing on glass.  Smell is hard to hit. At first it smells like orange juice, but other fruits break through: cherries, raisins, dates or figs possible. Trois Pistoles smells wonderful.  Taste is great, nearly as it smells. Very light achohol taste breaks through at the end. Not much bitterness and the after taste is nice.  Mouthfeel set me off abit. Far too over carbonated. This is like warm 7-Up in the middle of summer carbonation. If this wasn't so carbonated it would have been the best Belgian strong ale out there, but like all the Belgian strong ales its far too carbonated. If you love carbonations though this is you ticket.  Easy to drink, once the carbonation is gone. Its a great beer, just for $9 a bottle (Albertsons) I won't frequent it often, too bad cause if it was cheaper I would by alot more of it.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Belgian Dark Strong Ale,94
22,30,Thorpe429,4.37,"A: Pours a very dark brown with hints of crimson. Nice off-white, tannish head.  S: Loads and loads of dark fruits and hints of cherry with some caramel and toffee in the background.  T: Creamy dark fruits overwhelm the palate. Raisins, figs, dates, and dried cherries.  M: Nice and creamy. Good medium body with excellent carbonation.  D: Highly drinkable. Big fan of this all around and have to say I enjoy it quite a bit more than La Fin du Monde.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Belgian Dark Strong Ale,94
22,30,TheSevenDuffs,3.88,"Poured in to Duvel snifter  A - Medium brown in colour with half a finger of light brown head  S - Dark fruit caramel and lightly roasted malts.  T - Dark fruit, caramel, light banana.  M - Light to medium body with the slightest bit of chew. Lightly carbonated.  D - Very drinkable for a 9% strong ale.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Belgian Dark Strong Ale,94
22,30,prg1976,4.02,"Pours a super-dark brown, almost black, but not quite. Smallish head dissipates quickly to a thin coating on the top of the beer.  Smells of fruit-raisiny, banana. A little of the spicy Belgian yeast smells.  Tastes like it smells. Raisiny, spicy. No alcohol taste at all.  Mouthfeel is good, not overly carbonated. Drinkablility is fair, I could see this one sneaking up on you pretty quickly.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Belgian Dark Strong Ale,94
22,30,drabmuh,4.35,"Poured into a tulip. Beer is dark brown / black. Forms a thin off white head of small bubbles. Leaves some lacing on the glass and carbonation is moderate to low and steady.  Aroma has more raisins but the same estery bready yeast aroma as most of their beers.  Beer is rather thin but really good. Sweet and bitter at the same time. It finishes cleanly with a light body but nice carbonation in the mouth. This beer is really good. not feeling very verbose tonight but I""m really enjoying it.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Belgian Dark Strong Ale,94
22,30,grittybrews,4.2,"Poured the color of French press coffee into a Chimay chalice. Around half a finger of light head.  Aroma not overpowering. Moderately sweet with just a hint of alcohol.  Mouthfeel lighter than expected with moderate carbonation and a flavor that really builds over a few seconds into an enjoyable chocolate, banana, and malt sweetness. Lingering toasty and nutty finish.  Wouldn't drink as regularly as La Fin du Monde, but still a great brew. Excellent pairing with dark chocolate.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Belgian Dark Strong Ale,94
22,30,Avagadro,4.75,"A: deep mahogany in color, Trois Pistoles is clear, but nearly opaque, full of vigorous lacing, and topped by a creamy head that rises above the rim of my goblet. It has the same appearance as a marshmallow.  S: bouquet is quite fragrant, with many players. Mostly spice with only a touch of fruit, black pepper, banana, and grapes are all noticeable.  T: unibroue does a remarkable job on this brew, creating a 9% ale that is not at all syrupy. There is a slight sweetness to this brew that is created by the complex cast of fermentation by-products. Banana, black pepper, and mangoes are all contributors to this amazing brew.  M: Unibroue has really captured what the greats, particularly Westmalle dubbel and Rochefort, possess; a super creamy mouthfeel. Trois Pistoles is amazingly soft, even through the heavy carbonation. The mouthfeel may be the most impressive aspect of this brew.  D: I've always been impressed with Unibroue, and currently have the impression that they are the only ones on this continent that really capture the style that the Trappists have created. This is definitely worth picking up.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Belgian Dark Strong Ale,94
22,30,Naugros,4.33,"Dark, with an off-white head that will sit there until you start to drink it. Spots  The smell is that of any other Belgian ale, with the yeast coming through with its floral accents.  There is a slight burn on the tip of the tongue that is not at all unpleasant and the toastiness cannot be denied. Dark cherry fruit that starts up front but moves to the center of the palate, tinged with dried fruits. The hops make themselves known with a spiciness on the back of the tongue...maybe a bit of cloves.  As with most of Unibroue's offerings, this beer this is smooth with the proper amount of carbonation. Not a lot of aftertaste and what is there is nice and not bitter.  This beer is 9% ABV so I caution against downing bomber after bomber. However, this is an easy-drinking beer despite its darkness and full body and you'll want to open another.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Belgian Dark Strong Ale,94
22,30,puboflyons,4.32,"From the 750 ml. bottle dated 06-12-10. Sampled on May 7, 2010. The cork pops off loudly with a good dose of mist filtering from the bottle. It pours just about black with a long lasting soapy beige head and light lacing. The aroma reminded me more of a wine with a kind of fermented fruitiness mixed in with the roasted malts and light hops. The taste is more akin to licorice and hard liquor than beer but I do get a hint of malts in the sharply bitter offering. Even though it is noit really my style, Unibroue continues to live up to its good name with this one.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Belgian Dark Strong Ale,94
22,30,Beerandraiderfan,3.44,"Brown liquid of thinner viscosity. Tan head. Lackluster lacing for my expectations. Maybe its the purple on the bottle, but smells of plums/raisins.  Caramel and alcohol. Sediment despite the careful pour. Fruity Imperial Newcastle? Have aged this a few years, is much better imho. BSDA is just not a style you should come to me looking for direction on. I'm not into them. This one was really no different, even though it was better than 90% of BSDA's I've ever had.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Belgian Dark Strong Ale,94

All I know is that I really enjoyed it and would drink this beer anytime.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Belgian Dark Strong Ale,94
22,30,bsp77,4.15,"Serving glass: Poured from bottle into Snifter.  Appearance: Opaque and near black, but a tiny glimmer of red comes through in the light. Bubbly head and legs. Looks more dark brown once it nears the bottom of the Snifter.  Smell: Dark fruit galore - plum, figs, raisins and various other sweet fruits which I can't identify. Some light banana as well.  Taste: Very nice mix of the semi-sweet and earthy. Plums and raisins are in full form, but notes of banana, clove and musty wood are apparent as well. Very complex, but surprisingly a little mild.  Feel: Low carbonation, full and chewy body that is pretty smooth. Finish is actually somewhat dry. Unfortunately, it is slightly watery; not sure how it can be both full bodied and watery, but there you go.  Drinkability: Very nice BSDA, with lots of complexity, but a little subdued and watery. Still great, just not the best of the best.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Belgian Dark Strong Ale,94
22,30,liamt07,4.57,"First review ever: Poured from 341ml bottle into my Duvel tulip.  A: Pours a deep red/mahoghany/purple, with about 2 fingers of head, settling down to a thin layer with some good lacing on the sides.  S: Lovely, dark fruits (currant, cherry, dark berries I'd say?), sweet malty, a bit of chocolate and smidgen of yeast.  T: Bit of alcohol, again the dark fruits are there, pretty similar to the smell, minimal heat and a bit of yeast at the end.  M: Heavy carbonation, but really goes with the beer in my opinion. Not overdone, but appropriate I think.  D: Too drinkable. Could probably clear a 6 pack of this stuff if I didn't pass out from the alcohol first. Really hides the ABV, great friggin' quad.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Belgian Dark Strong Ale,94
22,30,regspeir,4.32,"I have had this beer many times but am just getting around to reviewing it. It reminded me why I like quads and suggested that this may be the perfect cold, rainy-day beer. I would normally reach for a porter or stout but I think this is so much more than most of those could bring to the table. It pours a deep, cider like reddish-brown. There was a two-finger head which quickly settled, leaving only light lacing. The nose was a blend of alcohol, raisins, cherry, clove, sweet malt and a yeasty aroma I can't describe. Carbonation is heavy. The taste follows the nose perfectly with the addition of some slight bitterness to temper the sweetness - a lovely interplay that really works. At 9% I certainly couldn't drink this all day/night but I might want to. This isn't my favorite Unibroue beer, but it is a great one, nevertheless.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Belgian Dark Strong Ale,94
22,30,Ralphus,3.58,"Belgian Strong Dark Ales are not my favorite style but I can appreciate why people might like them. There's plenty of flavour, it just isn't my thing. I've had Trois Pistoles on tap and in bottle and I think I prefer the tap version. It's a little mellower.  Pours a dark brown with amber highlights. The head is off-white, aggressively carbonated and quickly falls to a ring of foam. Some lacing is left behind.  The smell is fairly soft, containing ripe fruits, clove and an earthy yeast smell. The taste is fuller and more complex. Lots of ripe fruit, clove spice and even a hint of cinnamon are present. The aftertaste is long and drawn out. Alcohol is well hidden.  Mouthfeel and drinkability are standard.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Belgian Dark Strong Ale,94
22,30,dtivp,4.29,"Enjoyed this beer on tap, served in a goblet. Poured a cloudy deep brown with a small tan head that disappeared very quickly.  Aroma of dark fruit, cherries and raisin with some sweet malts and yeast.  Taste followed the aroma with the sweet fruits dominating with a very slight bitterness at the end. Surprising that there was no taste of the alcohol.  Creamy, medium bodied beer with little carbonation.  Very smooth drinking beer and at 9% ABV be very careful, this one could sneak up on you. Highly recommend this beer.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Belgian Dark Strong Ale,94
22,30,FeDUBBELFIST,3.82,"Bottle to chalice. Best before date of 2/18/10. Review from notes.  A: The average size head is light brown and filled with big short lived bubbles causing the crown to deflate quickly. The body is a murky shade of dark brown walnut. Completely opaque except at the thinnest parts of the glass.  S: Roasted caramel malt character, backed by piney/resiny hops and a dank barnyard, musty earth yeast. The nose is fairly impressive and is this beer's best feature.  T: Fermented apple cider and red grape juice. Various dark fruit flavors of blackberry, currant, prune and date come through as well. Slightly woody. Also, anise and various spices. Unfortunately, there is a hint of paper and a slightly metallic edge. For what its worth, this bottle has exceeded it's best by date by two weeks.  M & D: There are several consistent qualities across Unibroue's spectrum of beers: The sound upon opening a bottle rivals a gunshot, the head fills the glass and fizzes out quickly, lacing will not happen, the taste lacks depth, the mouthfeel too light and thin, and then there is, of course, the trademark super fizzy effervescence which is almost always the highlight of the beer.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Belgian Dark Strong Ale,94
22,30,snpub540,3.97,"Poured an almost black hue with a very thin light brown head. No lacing left on the glass at all. Lively carbonation that I've come to expect from Unibroue.  Smell was of mostly dark fruits and some yeasty goodness.  Taste was more complex than the smell in that it had spice, sweetness, some alcohol bite, and an earthiness that all combined to be very pleasant. None of the tastes overwhelm each other and it makes for a smooth sipper.  Mouthfeel was medium bodied and it had some nice fizzy carbonation to it. Drinkability is good, definately not a brew to be chugged.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Belgian Dark Strong Ale,94

Was a perfect beer to break out the Tripel Karmeliet glass and get nice.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Belgian Dark Strong Ale,94
22,30,irisier,4.47,"Served from a 750 ml Belgian style bottle.  Appearance: Murky, tawny brown with a fizzy tan head.  Smell: Dark sugary fruit with some faint sourness.  Taste: Juicy and slightly sweet fruit with some caramel upfront. Finishing with some faint hop bitterness and alcohol twang to balance the malty sweetness. Also a faint chalky aftertaste, I'm guessing from the yeast.  Mouthfeel: Medium bodied and very dry, but not off putting at all.  Notes: Complex and very tasty. This is a dangerous brew, I could easily drink three or four glasses of this, but at 9% ABV you need to take it slow with this one.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Belgian Dark Strong Ale,94
22,30,endovelico,4.15,"Poured into dimpled stein.  Appearance: White head that collapses shortly after. Unperceived Effervescence. Dark reddish-brown color.  Aroma: Medium high intensity. Nose of spices, bubblegum, banana and dark fruit. Spices CLEARLY dominate the profile.No hop aroma.  Taste: Medium high intensity. The taste follows up on the nose: Coriander seeds, clove and generic spices upfront. Banana, bubblegum and dark fruit on the back. No hop flavor.  Mouthfeel: Medium full bodied. Light carbonation. Slight sourish twang. Low bitterness. The alcohol is extremely well hidden.  Drinkability: Very ""Drinkable"" as it's not to sweet nor does the alcohol show itself to much. Fits the style, it's complex and interesting but lacks an extra ""oomph"" in the nose and tongue to warrant a 4.5.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Belgian Dark Strong Ale,94

S - lots of fruity esters cherry and raisen are dominate. some spicy beligan yeastyness. lots of sweet malts as well as some mild roasty stort of aroma.  T - follows the nose. very malt forward. lots of dark cherry and raisen esque fruity flavor. and a nice roasty bitterness in the background to balance it out. long finish. top notch.  M - medium bodied. not much carb but deffinitly right for the style.

22,30,Flashsp2,4.34,"Trois Pistoles 12oz into Duvel tulip  Pours a murky brown with what appears to be deep purple highlighting, as well as some ruby and gold around the edges. Has a two finger lopsided-rocky head of tan bubbles that dissipates pretty quickly without leaving any real lacing. A couple dainty laces as you take a few sips.  Aroma is something that everyone should experience. It smells like grape soda and Flintstone vitamins. No kidding, those are the two most prominent and defines aromas pouring off of this beer. Sweet dark malts, figs, dry dark fruits, Unibroue house yeast, candi sugar. Very interesting to say the very least.  Sweet Belgian candi, rich dark malt, a long hit of dry dark fruits, a bit of that grape soda thing that was present on the nose, dry yeast. The palette is definitely a bit delicate for the style, by all the components are well integrated and flow into one another effortlessly.  Mouthfeel is light and fluffy with a big, boisterous carbonation. Good for the style, though it could be considered by some a bit too light.  Easy to quaff and overall unpretentious and inoffensive. This has a very well hidden alcohol and could likely be enjoyed by those who aren't beer savvy. My second favorite offering from them behind the great La Fin.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Belgian Dark Strong Ale,94
22,30,DavidSeanNJ,4.26,"Multiple pours into a Duvel Tulip....  A- Slow pour yielded a dark brown beer with some ruby hues. Massive creamy off white head with tons of bubbles. Throughout the duration of the beer, a thich lucious layer or white sediment was like a blanket.  S- Sweet and some sour notes. Most notable fruit presence was cherry. Sugary and sweet.  T- Dark rich fruits. Red Grapes. Cocoa and even some cinnamon. Banana and chocolate covered cherries.  M- High carbonation. Sleek mouthful. Very easy going down.  D- What an excellent beer.

S - Brown sugar mixed with sour/unripe fruits. There is also a bread/yeast essence. Smells extremely tasty.  T - Like a warm biscuit with sweet fruits on top.

Rich fruits, plums, figs, hints of rotten banana and apricot. Some spices, chocolate, and cream. Dense, but not too strong.  Creamy, dense, and fantastic carbonation. Gives depth just from the nearly velvety texture. Figs on the tongue, with hints of chocolate tying it up. Spices are next, the carbonation gives a nice bite along with the spices. Hints of the over-ripe banana next, then the carbonation gives a clean bite on the tail with gentle subdued hops cleaning off the palate.  Creamy, dense, flavorful.

22,30,zoso1967,4.42,"Pours dark, Brazilian rosewood brown with a nice parchment head with fine bubbles. The aroma is sweet, with the essence of dark fruits. Prunes, black sweet cherry and blackberry. Also has spice notes of clove and pepper. Flavors include plum, cherry, port wine and clove. Also sensing some musty character and alcoholic warmth. This beer has a tartness to it that I think really brings everything together and takes it to the next level of enjoyment. Body is medium with smoothness at the start and sticky dryness rounding out the finish. The tartness lingers on the palate long after one swallows, leading one to take another sip. This leads us to the drinkability, which I think is pretty damn good for this style of beer. The first beer I tried from this brewery, and still my favorite. If the taste wasn't enough it also has sweet bottle art with Pegasus seemingly emerging form a fiery sky. Badass.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Belgian Dark Strong Ale,94
22,30,Scrapss,4.82,"This is a moment I've been waiting for, Trois Pistoles.  Appearance: A dark undercurrent with thick one finger head that dies into lively carbonation. Very wispy, almost non-existent lacing.  Smell: dark, light sweet cherry. Kind of a spicy wood hint, like lightly toasted fruit (sour apple or crab apple) smoke. Lighly boozy, not strong. Very, very pleasant smells all around. Hops are slight if at all, undetectable to my unrefined palate. As it warms, it gives off coca-cola notes.  Taste: Unreal. This is the perfect balance that I feel that Ommegang Three Philosophers is missing. Where 3P is strong and fruity, this is much more subtle, like the difference between using a brad nailer and a full-on pnuematic hardwood floor nailer to apply a small trim piece. Vanilla oak-cask flavors wisper up on the finish. The carbonation and alcohol content gives this a hint of spicy notes, but nothing overpowering. After a few swigs it is very warming in the chest.  Mouthfeel: If you swish it around, it generates a huge frothy feel that is very fruity and filling. If you do not swish, it almost has a dry finish that dissipates slowly. Carbonation was apparent at pour, and alcohol is present, spicy yet mild. finish has sweet oak char and vanilla with dominant cherry notes.  Drinkability: even though it's strong in ABV, I discern that this is yet another brew that could sneak up on the unwitting. Smooth and rather potent, I would not recommend a lot of it. But it is extremely driknkable.  Overall, this is among my favorite beers ever.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Belgian Dark Strong Ale,94
22,30,jacobseyb,4.15,"Poured from the bottle, into my St. Bernadus goblet. Dark brown with an orangish-ruby tint. Head is ample, and tan in color. Laced slightly. Smell is greatly complex with the typical Belgian spice combined with some dark fruits and citrus. Taste is similar, with the various flavors molded together very well creating quite a smooth ale. Feel is lighter than expected and very smooth. Carbonation starts aggressively both smooths through the bottle.

22,30,brewerburgundy,4,"750ml bottle, wine glass, best before 08-27-12, shared with my brother and dad.  Large towers of lightly tan foam topping a body that scans from middlin' yellow to tiger orange to fudge brown in the middle. The middle is also opaque.  I smelt black cherry quickly, and I think there is green apple as well in terms of fruit. Smell the skin of a plum without biting and you would know at least half of what is in the nose of this beer.  This offering is very like Maudite. Lots of black cherry and a very effervescent mouth. Clove and the rest of the yeast fill in the middle. The ending is hop bitterness with surprising raisin sweetness.  There is the normal Unibroue fizz. I like Belgian Strong Darks now; Unibroue has helped with the approachable fruity, non-yeast dominated Maudite and now Trois Pistoles.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Belgian Dark Strong Ale,94
22,30,ThomasFeeney1,4.4,"I met Unibroue at an Oyster/Beer tasting ... the oysters were all Crassostreia Virginicas except for one Kumomota Crassostreia Sikameia. The concept was 12 oysters and 12 beers. 11 of the beers really sucked . . . Unibroue, on the other hand, was an interesting product ... and 3 Pistols was the best of the lot. Drinkability? I LIKE Imperial Stouts, Porters, etc. But I especially like versions that you can drink in some quantity, i.e., not excessively powerful. Ergo, I'm off to drink another 3 pistols ... except, BTW, the Unibroue La Fin de Monde is a slightly better oyster quaff for those who really dig the tasty bivalves!",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Belgian Dark Strong Ale,94

22,30,Ek0nomik,4.07,"Poured In: Snifter  Appearance: The pour unleashes an aggressive carbonation that results in three fingers of creamy head. The color is between a dark sienna and bistre and a light cocoa powder colored head. There isn't a lot of lace produced on the side of my glass; there's just a few wide streaks that occur after each sip, with the previous streaks disappears with each consecutive sip.  Smell: The nose on this is much more pleasant than the last Belgian dark ale I had. Belgian yeast is sticking its head out the most, including some clove and pepper notes. There's a slight toasted edge brought on from the dark roasted malt and alongside the malt comes a dash of sweetness including molasses and figs.  Taste: Just like the nose, the first thing I pick up on the palate is Belgian yeast. More spice notes of pepper and clove. Alcohol starts to shine through just a little, turning it into quite the warmful drink. More of the molasses comes in after the alcohol, followed by a blend of fruity notes including fig and plum.  Mouthfeel: Trois Pistoles comes in with a thin to medium body and highly carbonated. I actually think the beer could use just a little more body on it.  Drinkability: The last of my Unibroue bottles that I got in a sampler pack. I've really enjoyed all of the Unibroue beers, they have all been top notch and have turned me on to the Belgian style of beer even more.  This was a great beer to finish out the series. Really easy to sip on, and it had a nice fruity and spicy blend in the nose and on the palate.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Belgian Dark Strong Ale,94
22,30,Daktyls,4.13,"One of three birthday presents from my brother. Mmm, tasty presents.  A: Poured a deep, dark crimson-brown. Initially 1-1.5 finger head which dissolved fairly quickly. Lacing stuck around on the top afterwords.  S: Somewhat fruity smelling, some apple was detectable. Also smelled of malt and yeast. A slight hint of alcohol was detectable in the same way that wine smells of alcohol.  T: Very complex flavors. Starts sweet but ends a little bitter. Fruits were tasted, well balanced with a hint of alcohol.  M: Fair amount of carbonation, swallows smoothly with a bit of lingering aftertaste.  D: Very drinkable, alcohol is not very prominent so I'm sure it'd be easy to go overboard with this one. I intend on having the whole 750ml bottle though.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Belgian Dark Strong Ale,94
22,30,brystmar,3.8,"750ml bomber into my Kanne chalice.  A: deep, dark brown with a somewhat thick head that couldn't stand not being beer itself. Almost zero lacing, but a thin layer swirled atop the brew as I drank.  S: fruity (apples and pears) & yeasty aromas dominate the nose. Some malt too.  T: super complex -- everything from the nose is here, fruit up front with some interesting dark funk added by the yeast. Very bold and dry start to finish; sweetness is there but not in the limelight. Alcoholic warmth as it goes down, just enough to make you smile by the bottle's end.  M: very highly carbonated, but somehow turns creamy towards the end of the drink. I definitely prefer less carbonation in my brews so can't rave about this beer here.  D: decently easy drinking for a dark Belgian strong, but one bottle is plenty for me. An enjoyable drink for sure.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Belgian Dark Strong Ale,94
22,30,undeadozzy,4.87,"Got in a bottle at a local bar. Served in a goblet.  Appearance: Poured a deep crimson color, almost like blood. Had a nice thick cream colored head that lingered but dematerialized after a few minutes.  Smell: Very intriguing. Smelled more like a fine wine then a beer. Definitely attractive.  Taste: Delicious. The wine-like smells it emitted are instantly tasted upon the first sip. Fruity and bold, with a some sharp tones to make it noticed. Tastes great overall.  Mouth Feel: While it tastes great, it is a very thick beer. I normally drink stouts, so I'm used to thicker beers, but this was a different kind of thick. I can almost say it was ""syrupy"", but not in a bad way, it fit with the taste of the beer.  Drinkability: Definitely a dangerously drinkable beer because of it's fruity tones that hide its ABV make it a deceptively delectable brew.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Belgian Dark Strong Ale,94
22,30,ericj551,3.91,"Unibroue Trois Pistoles pours a bright deep red brown, with a nice creamy light brown head that lingers. The aroma is fruity, estery and slightly phenolic. Tons of dry yeast aroma and sweet dark fruit mingling nicely. The flavor is fruity and sweet upfront with the yeasty flavor giving way to a creamy, dairy like flavor. The dark raisin caramel maltiness comes through in the finish with a bit bit of bitterness. The alcohol is there, but pretty well masked.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Belgian Dark Strong Ale,94
22,30,ludachris,4.6,"Edit: I had this beer again the day after my first review, and discovered even more things going on, most notably in the taste. IMO, this speaks to the great complexity of this beer.  Pours a dark chestnut brown, that when put directly in front of light, changes into a gorgeous hue of marmalade red. Two fingers of off-white creamy head top this beer, displaying excellent retention and leaving large patches of creamy lace.  Citrus and apple juice tartness in the foreground that reminded me a bit of Orval, contributing to the somewhat vinous quality that is present throughout, with deep notes of raisons, figs, caramel, yeast, hints of cocoa, pepper, and various other spices in the back. Very, very complex.  The tart and slightly sour characters that seem to stem from apple and lemon hit the palate first and serve as an excellent balance for the sweet dark fruits and yeast that quickly come after. The 9% ABV only makes itself known only in the warming feel it gives off in the palate and chest.  Mouthfeel is rich, creamy, smooth, chewy, and full bodied. It took me awhile to figure out what was going on in here, and that's what makes it such a pleasure to drink, especially with the alcohol being so well disguised.  Another fantastic beer from Unibroue, making them one of my favorite, if not my favorite Canadian brewery. The wonderful appearance, combined with the layers of complexity in both the nose and palate, excellent mouthfeel, and dangerous drinkability makes this an exceptional brew. I enjoyed one of their other BSDA's, Maudite, just as much. Highly, highly recommended.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Belgian Dark Strong Ale,94

22,30,Jwale73,4,"12oz. bottle served at 50 degrees in a tulip. Best by 02-18-11 indicated on the bottle. Pours a hazy brownish-maroon with a one inch loose, off-white head that begins to dissipate form the center outwards. Head eventually disperses into a tight band and some swirls - some lacing, but weak legs. Nose reveals dark fruit with a hint of yeast and candi sugar - takes on a slightly vinous quality towards the back. Taste consistent with nose - some acidity and carbonation level makes it taste a little soda-pop like. Mouthfeel is light-medium with a fairly aggressive carbonation that weakens the body slightly and leaves a residual burn at the back of the throat. A very respectable Belgian Strong Dark. Maybe a little too much carbonation, but not gassy by any means - another solid offering from Unibroue",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Belgian Dark Strong Ale,94
22,30,TheQuietMan22,4.37,"Appearance: Poured an attractive dark, ruby brown. It might be purple, or a plumb color, but I can't see it. Two fingers of a thick, tan head developed and dissipated slowly to leave a nice lacing.  Smell: It smells a lot like a dunkelweizen. (I have a hard on.) Very yeasty, and ripe fruits like bananas, grapes, and apples dominate. Cloves, plumb, and raisins also play in the aroma.  Taste: This is where the dunkelweizen comparison stops. The taste is fruity; the plumb, grapes, and apple cider are most prevalent. There's also a hint of spice (maybe cinnamon?) which I don't really care for. The cloves are also noticeable in the taste, which, as it warms, once again reminds me of dunkelweizen. The port finish mentioned on the brewer website comes through. Also, I definitely noticed the higher than average ABV. There's a slight burn at the end, especially on the first sip.  Drinkability: This is definitely a sipper. Tasty, complex, and superb. It's a great brew.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Belgian Dark Strong Ale,94

The aroma is of sweet plum, clove, mild malt and some raisin. The taste follows a traditional Belgian style with a nice clove and almost cinnamon spice start, sweet plum and raisin, with a touch of cherry left on my tongue in the finish. This is smooth brew but not sure how many I could session.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Belgian Dark Strong Ale,94
22,30,gloriousglo2,4.4,"Poured this into my Taylor Guitars tulip glass. It had this kinda purplish color with a head that reminded me of the tops of the waves off the beach at Avalon, NJ. The bubbles tickled my nose. I could imagine myself breathing the clean air of Quebec as its fruity aroma stimulated every olfactory fiber in my rather ample proboscus. After the fourth one, I thought I was Robert Lansing in ""Twelve O'Clock High"", or maybe John Wayne. Seriously, it was freakin' excellent. Nice, slightly fruity taste, just the right level of sweetness. I got this as part of their sampler case (La Fin du Monde, Maudite, and that strange apple stuff-think the wit beer woulda been the better fourth beer) for about $45 US at that famous and very large beer distributor in Emmaus, PA.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Belgian Dark Strong Ale,94

22,30,GJ40,4.5,"Sampled from a 750ml bottle in a chalice.  This beer looks so inviting with a deep, dark brown color and a small beige head that dissipates quickly. It has some light coming through around the edges and a constant stream of fine bubbles flowing up from the bottom of the glass.  The aroma is very vibrant with cherries and raisins leading the charge and a hint of chocolate and brown sugar joining in.  The flavor is substantial but not overdone. It's fruity and slightly tart with cherries and brown sugar. Despite the color, there is little flavor you'd associate with such a dark beer.  The carbonation is high with very fine bubbles that mellow as you go on. The consistency is moderate and just right.  This is such a smooth, tasty and complex beer with everything you'd expect from a Belgian brew except for the price tag.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Belgian Dark Strong Ale,94
22,30,TonyReaves,4.69,"Poured into- what else?- a Trois Pistoles goblet. Yeah, I'm already a fan. Figured I should run a review of one of my absolute favorite beers.  Not much head, but I'm getting a lot of aromatics- cherries, figs. Whatever malts they used gave this a lot of fruitiness.  So much going on in this. Cherries and grapes and pears. Alcohol warmth. A bit spicy.  Despite all that malt, this still finishes pretty dry. High carbonation.  Drinkability? This is no session beer, but as a sipper it's beautiful. I'll take drinkability to mean I could spend an hour with this glass and be happy straight through.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Belgian Dark Strong Ale,94
22,30,Jmoore50,2.58,"The appearance is of a dark plumb. It has a dark brown heart with purple brown edges. The head is tan colored with huge fat bubbles that represent strong carbonation. This is the macro of Belgian ales.  The smell is of figs and clove with a melting pot of spices that I cannot really point out.  The taste has a strong Belgian yeast character to it that brings lots of spice and a bit of dryness. I think the clove in this is the specific spice that I cannot stand, plus there really is no strong flavor. This is Belgian Strong Dark Ale Light. This has some of the flavors of the style, but they need to be amplified by ten. Too watered down.  The mouthfeel is over carbonated for the style and a bit dry on the finish. The yeasts bring a positive aspect to the mouthfeel by bringing a type of spice complexity, but in the end it is muddled. The direction of this beer is unknown. It needs more body, more flavor and most of all, more balls. This is a safe, easy representation of a beautiful style. I would not age this beer. This is the Coors Light of Belgian Dark Ales.

Aroma has a nice spiciness with caramel and dark fruity malts.  The flavor is full of dark chocolatey malt, toasted pumpernickel, raisins, prunes and apricots. Nice spiciness, black pepper, capers and clove as well a a nice floral hoppiness. Alcohol is noted but not hot at all, blending and supporting the other flavors. Nicely complex becoming moreso with warming.  Mouthfeel is medium, creamy and a bit chalky and smooth with a bit of robust carbonation.  I believe this is my favorite Unibroue beer now!

It has a sense of some dark fruits, very similar to St. Bernardus ABT 12.  Taste: Not too strong, easy on the alcohol taste. It's a little sweet but not too sweet.  Mouthfeel: It's lovely; warm and smooth. The feel and taste linger on the back of the tongue.  Drinkability: Given the ABV of this beer it is very drinkable.

22,30,ChopperSmith,4.3,"Poured from 750ml bottle into a Unibroue tulip glass.  Appearance - Dark slightly hazy brown with a small tan head that retained about a half finger head throughout with some nice sticky lacing.  Smell - Slightly sweet with a nice roasted malt aroma and some nice fruity & spicy yeast phenols. Very welcoming aroma.  Taste - A great blend of dark roasted malts and fruity and spicy yeast phenols. A nice sweetness up front gives way to a slightly dry finish. A very well balanced beer and very similar in flavor to a good Belgian Dubbel, but slightly maltier. Nice.  Mouth feel - Medium-bodied and creamy carbonation. Has a great mouth feel for this style  Drinkability - I like this beer a lot, as I do most of the Unibroue beers. It's not my favorite Unibroue beer (that honor goes to 'Don De Dieu""), but it's a very close second and a good representation of the BPSA style with a little more emphasis on the malts. I would drink this again for sure.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Belgian Dark Strong Ale,94

T- Too fruity. Raisins, grapes, dates, sugar, all a little unbalanced for my taste. Not bad, but just a little overwhelming.  M- Decent. Maybe a little over-carbonated.  D- Overall not the most drinkable. The high amount of sweetness would make it tough to stomach a lot of this.  Overall, not a bad beer, but I'm still a little unimpressed with Unibroue.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Belgian Dark Strong Ale,94

The head has little retention, but loads of carbonation are constantly rising from above. The nose was overwhelming grape juice. There are other dark fruits like cherry and plum, but the grape dominates. You also get a hint of alcohol in the scent. Has a grape juice/wine blast at first. Then there are subtle hints of the Belgian influence. Lots of clove and a tiny banana note. The carbonation was just over the top for me.

Lovely, golden tan head that disappeared quickly to a very thin collar and very little lacing.  Nose was a bit closed (beer too cold?). Some dried fruits, prunes and alcohol sweetness.  First impression was the carbonation. I thought this one was a little too carbonated. However, the taste is right on for this style.

The dark fruits are sweet.  Prunes, raisins, caramel, a little funkiness, and a very very quaint chocolate aftertaste are the flavors.  Medium-heavy mouthfeel, well carbonated, and sweet.  You can taste the alcohol, no doubt, but is true to style.

22,30,TheFightfan1,3.55,Poured into my ommegang snifter. Pours a caramel color with ruby highlight's. Fizzy heading that fizzed out completely and left no lacing at all.  Smell is heavy with malt. Some undertones of tartness and cherries.  Taste is malty as hell then soothes out into a beautiful cherry middle. Finish into a dry hot booze on the breath a little heavy.  Mouth is full bodied and warms the palte with that warm boozy feel. Needs some swirling though to bring up some carbonation.  Drink is good. A little dissappointing seeing how this was such a highly rated beer. I wasn't all that impressed.,Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Belgian Dark Strong Ale,94
22,30,climax,4.27,"It pours a quick immediate head that quickly dissipates due to the high ABV. A real dark purple, almost black, looms in the snifter after the pour.  Nose was of obvious ripened fruit with substantial notes of yeast, pear, coriander, and spice. A bit more strength would have yielded a higher mark  The flavor is exceptionally smooth. Grape and tannin have a huge influence, but it isn't overly wine-like. The warmth of alcohol is apparent and sneakily looms throughout but never distracts. Coriander, sweet pear, and yeast make another appearance and give way to dark sugars in the clean finish.  Body is medium, yet it feels light and alive. The initial feel is good and sharp from the carbonation, it soon settles down to a smooth creaminess. Finish had a somewhat interesting slimy feel. Despite the 9% ABV the beer goes down really smoothly, better watch out after a few though.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Belgian Dark Strong Ale,94

This one was a little sweeter though, almost as though the fruit were slightly sweetened or barely dessicated. Very smooth and velvety in the mouth with a light carbonation that enhanced the sweetness of the fruit and allowed some spice to develop after.

At first the ring and patch of foam do leave a bit of foam on the sides of the glass but the lacing itself is pretty sparse to almost nothing. Later sipping, after the foam has reduced to a small ring around the liquid there is not much if any lacing or even speckles on the sides of the glass.  Smell: The aroma has some ripe dark fruits and a nice Belgian yeast character. Among other things the fruit basket seems to have in it some plums and dark cherries along with a trace of raisins, all sweetened by some dark caramel.  Taste: The flavor has more in it than appears in the nose. The ripe dark fruits, yeast and light touch of dark caramel sweetness blend with some dark berries, some ripe banana and some nice spices (e.g., traces of clove and pepper) and a barely detectable trace of alcohol  Mouthfeel: The mouth feel is light to medium bodied, and almost smooth and creamy but the carbonation is barely adequate to sustain this for the entire beer. The medium finish contains the mixed fruits in balance with some light bitterness and finishes with trace of dry spicy bitterness.  Drinkability: I've enjoyed this beer before, and will do so again in the future. It is well balanced and complex. While it doesn't rock you back on your heels the way some of the top Trappist BSDAs do, it is much more approachable and quite tasty. Definitely recommended.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Belgian Dark Strong Ale,94
22,30,BreworFerment,4.5,Fermented on the lees this dark ale has immensely enjoyable creamy mouthfeel. At 9% it doesn't taste like it. Aroma has a hint of grape and it pours dark with a hint of ruby which belies its port wine flavors in the finish. Great beer I enjoyed every drop and it was gone all too quickly.,Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Belgian Dark Strong Ale,94
22,30,kjyost,4.42,"Poured a deep brown with a large, although quickly disappearing head. The remaining head lasted for a good while about 1/8"" tall, with lacing down the sides of the glass.  Yum. Does this beer ever smell good. Floral, and complex on the nose with hints of citrus and spices, perhaps cloves & coriander.  Yum. Does this beer ever taste good. Not a hint of the strong alcohol content initially, and the beer seems to hit you in stages. First it leaves a some of that light citrus on your palate which is then followed up with the maltiness and it finishes with a light bitter note. Well balanced, as none overpowers the other over time. There is light carbonation and it flows nicely. As you continue to sip away at the beer the alcohol is more noticeable, but not in any negative sort of way, in fact pairing nicely with the flavours...  This is a great beer, one I would drink regularly if it were available to me in such a manner.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Belgian Dark Strong Ale,94

22,30,danetrain0101,3.9,"A amberish brown liquid with a very thin sprinkling of foam.  The smell was as unique as the labeling. A nice yeasty aroma with hints fruit.  Alcohol is very evident in this drink. Many spicy flavors are present with a peppery sweetness that moves into a grainy underlying taste.  It feels very thick, like a chocolate porter. It doesn't leave much left in the mouth.  For a drink with such high alcohol content, it does have a great drinkability to it.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Belgian Dark Strong Ale,94
22,30,donkeyrunner,3.81,"The horse on the bottle portrays a devil horse used to build the Trois Pistoles church. Between the satan horse, the damned canoers of Maudite, and a beer dubbed ""the end of the world,"" I'm not really sure how to feel about Unibroue.  Opaque black/dark brown with a large, dirty, off-white head. Solid retention kept me company for the whole glass.  Aroma is nice and fruity. Ripe fruit, spicy Belgian phenols and cola--but good, gourmet cola, like Stewart's, not Pepsi. Mildly port-ish but I blame that on Unibroue's power of suggestion.  Tastes is, again, ripe fruit, cassis, with a mildly licorice pumpernickel malt. Sneaky alcoholic. Not as effervescent as most Unibroues.  Good stuff but after hearing so much about this beer I was expecting to get my socks knocked off. Much to my chagrin, I am very much still apres socks. Regardless, $7 a bomber for good Belgian ale--I'll take it.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Belgian Dark Strong Ale,94
22,30,cagocubs,3.73,"A: Pours dark brown mahogany. Nice two finger ivory head that maintains. Leaves decent lacing on glass.  S: Dark Fruit was the first thing I noted. Dates/plum, bread (yeast) and some alcohol.  T: You can taste the dark fruit and sweetness close to banana. Some spice like clove, and you can taste the alcohol bite.  M: Medium bodied with surprising carbonation. Leaves nice aftertaste.  D: The alcohol content at 9% is evident with every sip. Luckily, the complexity of this beer mask it as much as it can. Great beer to drink slowly and enjoy, not one to crack open again and again.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Belgian Dark Strong Ale,94
22,30,PangaeaBeerFood,4.5,"Poured from a 12 ounce bottle into a St. Bernardus Chalice. Dark murdy brown, borderline black color that's translucent around the very edges and opaque in the center. Not much head retention, but I think that was my fault, not the beers. It dissipated in a way that makes me think someone in the house washed my beer glass with soap.  The smell is completely unexpected. From the color and description by Unibroue, I expected this to have a Stout-esque character, with lots of roasted aromatics. The roastiness is very faint. Initial sniff is almost Wit-esque, with a spicy, citrusy character at the front, which fades into notes of dark fruit and booze and allows a little bit of roasty, chocolatelyness in at the very end.  The taste matches the smell, with all of the aforementioned characters present, only with more emphasis on the dark fruit and booze than the spice and chocolate. Speaking of chocolate, that's what I'm eating with this beer (as per Unibroue's request) and it's an amazing pairing.  The mouthfeel is fantastic. It's slick and slippery, but has a ton of carbonation which stops it from feeling heavy.  Drinkability is initially very high. As the beer warms, the alcohol and strength of the brew become more present. This is a sipper.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Belgian Dark Strong Ale,94
22,30,whtguitarguy,4.62,This was delicious! But very alcoholic. Pours to a cloudy dark brown almost like coke but a little bit lighter. Alcohol shines through in the aroma with some sweet notes. Strong yeasty flavor and alcohol are most prevalent with some sweet notes that I couldn't place.,Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Belgian Dark Strong Ale,94
22,30,Kadonny,4.32,"Poured from my tap at home into a Chimay chalice glass.  A: A dark brownish with some hints of red, very cloudy and the head is a light brownish two finger. Minimal glass lacing.  S: Dark fruits with a yeasty spicy nose, alcohol is picked up. You get that classic Unibroue yeast smell.  T: Very nice flavor with dark fruits up front. Plum, red grape, raisins, fig maybe coupled with a full belgian yeasty flavor. Spices poke through with the bready sweetness that tries to turn sugary but never gets there. Some slight hints of darker chocolate and I guess I get the port flavors. Finish turns dry and spicy with the backround sweetness staying. Very complex beer, very enjoyable.  M: Full, coating, lingering, sweet but drying finish. Alcohol is evident but it is very well hidden. Enjoyable.  D: For the ABV, drinkability is high. I enjoyed two easily while at home one night.  Overall what can I say, another really great beer from Unibroue that is extremely enjoyable by itself or with a meal. This beer is best enjoyed a little slowly, but I prefer it with a bit of chill so don't let it sit too long. A great keg that I will enjoy.

It never disappears totally leaving some lacings  S: Sweet, spicy and a bit fruity in the nose. Toffee, caramel malts, earthy yeasts and coriander. Dry raisins, hops and a bit of alcohol in the end  T: Full of taste. Quite pleasant. Fruity and sweet upfront. Reminds dark dry fruits. Port wine. Spicy. There's something in this beer that gives a quite refreshing sensation in the mouth, I would guess coriander. Earthy yeasts and a delicate hoppy bitterness. A warmy beer  M: Medium creamy and molasses body. Reasonable carbonation  O: Extremely drinkable beer. Dispite of the Belgian influence, the Canadians of Unibroue were able to do it their own way.

Smelled of grass, strong bready yeast, unidentified spices  Taste of cherries, bread dough, cakey yeast, cocoa powder and a finish of brandy as stated on the bottle -  Light mouthfeel, but this is a Belgian, so expected with the crisp yeast flavors. Very well balanced though, and does not have the dry finish many other belgians have.  Very drinkable , glad I bought a four pack of 12 oz's instead of the 750 ml bottle for saving for later....",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Belgian Dark Strong Ale,94

Clean spice and fruit on the nose with hints of cinnamon, fig, light pepper, and warm pie crust.  The tasted is loaded with dark fruit notes and touches of light spice, malt, and just a bit of medicinal character from the yeast. Alcohol is virtually unnoticeable.

The taste is much like the smell, and I can pick up some bananas and cloves which I did not detect from the smell alone.  Medium bodied, high carbonation, and the alcohol is not hidden at all. A nice beer to drink all the same, and I can honestly say that so far every beer I have had from Unibroue has been a winner.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Belgian Dark Strong Ale,94
22,30,Arbitrator,2.51,"Chilled 750mL poured into a glass (two doses).  A: Pours a very dark, translucent brown with garnet translucence against the light. The head settles quickly and resolves into a ring. No lacing to speak of.  S: The signature Unibroue smell: yeast, dark fruits (raisins, figs, plums), a dash of caramel, and a strong burst of coriander.  T: The dark fruits come through first as a hefty mix of raisins, plums, and figs. There is some caramel and a light cherry cola flavor (including cinnamon) in the mid-taste. It's spicy, but not overly so; there is a murky coriander element that doesn't quite resolve into anything sharp. The finish is kind of watery. They refer to this beer as ""mellow"" on the label, but I think it's kind of weak, really.  M: Medium-bodied, with prickly carbonation. It's thin and airy on the palate, which is ok for most styles, but not for a BSDA, in my opinion. The ABV is well-disguised, though there is a light burn on the finishing end of this 1-year-old bottle.  D: I used to regard this one as the best Unibroue beer, but after having had it a few more times over the course of my palate evolution, I think it was more nostalgia than anything. This was one of my first gateway beers into the craft world, and sadly, it's not able to be much more than that. It's been relegated to my standard of an ""average"" BSDA.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Belgian Dark Strong Ale,94
22,30,irishking1977,4.28,"Grabbed one Trois Pistole as part of a mixed six pack. I haven't had this one in a while, but figured I'd reminisce and review.  A: Pours a jet black with a massive creamy beige head that leaves copious lacing. Yeast floaters somewhat noticeable. The head maintains itself for quite awhile, leaving the lacing.  S: The first thing that came to mind was malt, grapes and other dark fruit. A slight yeast funkiness as well, can be detected.  T: A trifecta of dark fruit, malt and slight bitter chocolate. I'd say this is probably the most unique Belgian dark ale I've had to date. Malt sweetness remains on the palette after every sip. The complex taste can make one forget this one is has an ABV of 9%.  M: Well carbonated with a creamy and mildly syrupy mouthfeel. If you're not thinking about the mouthfeel while sipping this one, that's probably a good thing.  D: Due to the complex flavors and high ABV, this is an excellent sipper but not exactly a session. Would make a great aperitif along with dark chocolate or sharp cheese.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Belgian Dark Strong Ale,94
22,30,davidf45,3.98,"I enjoyed this beer when I was able to try it at a beer tasting. I found it had more interesting flavor when aged for 1 year.

22,30,popery,4.17,"Good sweetness and fruit makes Trois Pistoles stand out from the already strong Unibroue lineup. Dark, nearly opaque burgundy liquid with a creamy off-white head. The aroma is maltier and doughier than most from Unibroue. With notes of raisins, plums, bananas and clove, there are many dark Belgian-style fruit flavors from the yeast and malt. The flavor is mildly sweet for the style but still right in the normal range for a good quad/BSDA. Mouthfeel is full and lively. All of Unibroue's beers are well-made. Trois Pistoles is a very nice BSDA. I have no real qualms with it, but I'm not sure how well it would stand out against a field of the top examples of the style.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Belgian Dark Strong Ale,94
22,30,aristeros,4.26,"Disclaimer: I am pretty heavily biased in favor of Unibroue.  Pours a darker amber from the bottle into my Chimay goblet. Once the glass is full, it's a black coffee brown, lighter cola brown in the light. A nice two fingers of off-white head that faded to a half finger after about two minutes, with thick lacing.  Smells boozy and yeasty. Dark fruit--black cherries and dates--over banana and spices.  Taste is subtler than I remember Maudite and Fin du Monde. Fairly sweet, with a strong alcohol presence throughout. Heavy dark fruit presence, similar to the nose. A maple syrup or brown sugar aspect to the sweetness on the back end, finishes with nutty flavors.  Fairly boozy. Slightly creamy mouthfeel, and the carbonation is lively and works overall with the flavors and aroma.  Superior. Not the best thing Unibroue has made, but not one to miss. If you've never had a beer from this brewer and like the dark Belgians, recommend trying one or two.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Belgian Dark Strong Ale,94

S- Very yeasty, lots of banana, caramelized sugars, dried figs, and definitely some booziness.  T- Banana-y esters, yeast, raisins, starts very sweet, but ends sort of dry on the palate, some heat from the alcohol in the finish, but not too much at all.  M- Nice prickly carbonation. As described in the taste, the finish is nice and dry on the back of my tongue.  D- It's a little sweet to drink a lot of, but I felt 12 oz was a very manageable portion.

Taste: Yeasty and bitter with a hint of nuts and a strong amount of booze. Quite tart as it stings the taste buds but drags you into the glass sip by sip. Interesting combination of flavors make up this great brew.  Mouthfeel: Crisp, warm and refreshing all at the same time. Bit on the boozy side but the carbonation helps for me at least.

22,30,Seanstoppable,4.03,"A recent pick up from Premier Wine and Spirits.  Pours a really dark broiwn, almost black when pouring into my goblet. A half finger of head is briefly retained, then dissipates.  Mild malt scent. Some alcohol is also slightly apparent, reminding me slightly of wine. Also something that reminds me slightly of molasses.  Taste initially rolls over the tongue. Some sweet malts are apparent, as are some darker fruits. Molasses/brown sugar like taste is slightly present. Alcohol is also apparent at the end, somewhat like a less strong barleywine in character. The taste has a pleasant lingering quality to it.  The alcohol character isn't as apparent as one would think, and is smoother than 9% ABV should really be. I wouldn't say this was an enjoyable 'surprise' given the average rating, but I can certainly see why it is so high and am definately glad I picked this up.  Something for a nice evening in winter around the fireplace, or a similar setting.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Belgian Dark Strong Ale,94
22,30,donniecuffs,4.35,"Poured a nice deep brown/black with two fingers of sepia-colored head that laced very well, into a snifter. The nose yielded molasses, caramel, cocoa powder, bittersweet chocolate, dark plum, and malt. The flavor yielded all of the above in copies amounts, but also revealed more sour/tart fruitiness..plum and cherry...which surfaced mid-palate through the finish. Furthermore, the finish also revealed the alcohol content, and left some alcohol-induced warmth afterwards. Silky, medium body; just a fantastically flavorful beer to sip appreciatively, or pair with a good meal. My only knock on this beer (if I was forced to pick something) is that when it warmed to room temperature, the sweetness was a little too much.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Belgian Dark Strong Ale,94

T - Starts out sweet and malty, with a strong yeast taste as well. Dark fruit notes start becoming more apparent. The chocolate undertone is very subtle, and I could also taste a little banana and a touch of clove-like spiciness. The finish definitely developed a port-like potent sweetness.  M - Medium-bodied, with moderate crisp carbonation. The alcohol is very well-masked, I wouldn't reckon this was a 9% beer if I didn't know it for a fact. Smooth, coats your mouth really nicely.  D - Drinks easily if you're accustomed to these kind of beers. But watch out, the alcohol will hit you if you don't stop before it's too late!",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Belgian Dark Strong Ale,94
22,30,Lunch,4.45,"Served from a 12oz. bottle into my Trois Pistoles goblet at cellar temperature (11/08/09).  A: Pours a vibrant mahogany brown with ruby highlights capped off with a finger of an active off-white head.  S: Dark fruits dominate the bouquet with highlights of plums, prunes, raisins, and a hint of brown sugar and cola.  T: The dark fruit theme continues with raisins, plums, prunes, and cherries along with banana, orange and sweet malt. Fruity esters and phenols develop leading to a cola and alcohol finish that is quite pleasing.  M: Medium-bodied with very active carbonation.  D: Rich flavors that are soothed with vibrant carbonation creates one of the most sessionable Belgian Strong Dark Ales around even though it is 9%abv.

T: Rich fruity malts are the dominant flavor in the beer mixed in a with faint herbal taste and powerful Belgian spices.

A ring of foam encircles the glass, within it lies a swirling film of foam--it retains this nicely to the end  The aroma is rich brown sugar and red grapes, prunes and an overall pleasing sweet fruitiness.  The taste is similar, with an abundance of plums and cherries, a tartness lurks at the edges, and an orangeyness pervades throughout. Has a medium-dry finish, with just a little residual still sugar kicking around. The alcohol is present but it plays nicely against the fruity sweetness.  This is full bodied and the carbonation does a great job of softening and melding the flavors together. Very smooth. Highly drinkable.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Belgian Dark Strong Ale,94
22,30,Whiteweasel,4.04,"Poured from a 12 oz bottle into a chalice. Labeled as best before 09-03-11  Appearance: Gorgeous. Pours into the glass like something a bit more viscous. Cloudy brown colour which is dark unless held up to the light, after which it shows a beautiful medium brown gradient througout the glass. Head retention leaves a lot to be desired, but most unibroue beers seem to be that way for whatever reason. Gets even more hazy after the second pour, to the point where there are swirling patterns of sediment.  Smell: Yeasty like a Don de Deau, but not as much so as a Chimay. Almost smells a little boozy. Spicyness comes out in the nose. A peppery clove scent with a hint of the sweetness of liquorish. Has a little bit of sourness which reminds me of grapes, or more specifically like a french Pinot Blanc.  Taste: A tartness not commonly tasted in such an ale. Sweet and pretty yeasty, I can definitely taste the Unibroue strain of yeast, especially easy if you know what youre looking for. Boozy and warm in the mouth even though I chilled it. Very noticable light grape flavour. Almost as pronounced as the clove and moreso than the weak banana flavour. Nuttiness comes into play after the second pour (obviously with the massive influx of sediment). Im not sure how I feel about the ridiculous amount of sediment in the bottle, but im sure it helps more than it hurts. Little floral element to it as well; not hoppy at all but some sweet flower that you might smell in the early summer when its sweltering outside. (I recognize the taste/smell of the flower specifically from where it used to grow outside my house but sadly I cant recall) This would be fantastic on a hot day in the early summertime.  Mouthfeel: Sharp and much more concentrated carbonation to the point where it bites the tongue (and even hurts a little!). Alcohol taste is very much present, not hidden like in the other Unibroues I've had. Carbonation is much more aggressive than in champagne but fits better with this beer. Warmth is a dominant trait once the beer has warmed up a little in your mouth. At least you know what youre drinking at 9%  Drinkability: Maybe I'm just a little full, but this beer isnt really something I'd love to have more than one or two of in a night. Although it is damn good and complex to boot. Not a perfect beer by any stretch, but still a fine brew which I would like to drink more often. Not a session beer....a bottle is an acceptable size, which has gotten me feeling a little silly (and i'm sure a bomber would get me acting outright goofy...)  Final Notes: It's an interesting, albeit not extremely inventive, take on the style. Probably my favourite of the Unibroues. Still theres something about the yeast that I just am not a huge fan of. Also, their beers never give enough head for my personal taste. But enough about that, this beer is pretty damn solid and is better than a lot of stuff Ive had.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Belgian Dark Strong Ale,94
22,30,clockwerk,4.51,"Poured from a 12oz bottle into a tulip.  A - Well, to be frank, it's pretty average looking. Cloudy, brown with little head or head retention. However, it does throw down some nice lacing. I should point out that the head formation, retention and lacing varied greatly in the 6 bottles in my 6 pack. A couple formed very nice heads/lacing, and a couple poured out like they were barely carbonated. The remaining 2 were somewhere in the middle. However, the carbonation was about equivalent in regards to mouthfeel in all of them.  S - Wow. Nice. One of the nicer beers I've smelled. Dark fruit character balanced by alcohol gives it a rich aroma. I have poor sense of smell, and this stuff smelled great.  T - Take ""La Fin Du Monde"" and swap out the cloves and spice for dark fruit and you've got Trois Pistoles. That's a good thing. There's a strong malty flavour (as I guess should be expected) with just a bit of earthy bitterness (and I mean a very little bit) that does enough to keep everything in check and leave a nice dry feeling on the palate. The aftertaste is outstanding as well. That clean, dry earthiness sticks around making sure each sip is as sweet as the last. Seems like a small deal, but for me personally, a beer this rich can wear on me fast, and this one does a great job of preventing that from getting overwhelming.  M - A little thinner than I would have liked, and I think a little thin for the style.  D - Conversely to it's mouthfeel, the lightness of it enhances it's drinkability. I could easily drink a few of these in a session. At 9% ABV, that's a little concerning!  Notes:  Damn. Unibroue is just killer. I want to drive out there and give them all a sincere hug. This beer to me really does seem like Fin's cousin. I guess that should be expected. I think it should also be appreciated. The fact that I can get it from ""The Beer Store"" in 6's makes it a highly rated ""go to"" beer for me now, because frankly, I couldn't care less about it's appearance.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Belgian Dark Strong Ale,94
22,30,corby112,4.8,"pours a deep dark brown, almost black color that is completely opaque with only the slightest bit of mahogany color in the edges when held to a light source. Massive 3 finger frothy dark tan head with excellent retention, only slowly fading to a lasting cap that leaves chunks of soapy lacing in it's wake.  Dark malty aroma with a lot of estery dark fruit and peppery spice. Silky chocolate and caramel malt as well as some toffee notes along with hints of raisin, plum, fig, sour dark cherries and fig.  Carbonated up front with some smooth roasted malt, sweet dark fruit, candy sugar body with a dry and bitter yet sweet roasted finish. Dangerously quaffable with the high ABV being very well masked. Only a very slight hint of alcohol warmth.  Nice chocolate malt flavor that is roasty, but not too much so. Lots of estery dark fruit notes, especially raisin, fig, plum and sour dark cherry along with sweet candy sugar notes. Very well balanced. Highly recommended!",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Belgian Dark Strong Ale,94
22,30,ryanonline,4.49,"dark deep amber appearance with traces of ruby. quickly dissipating thin, rocky head leaves no real lacing  amazing sweet aroma, a candied fruit smell makes itself well known with maybe a hint of fig and raisin. underneath it all is a definitive alcohol aroma.  moderately sweet, nice and malty. the fruit takes a backseat to a slightly more biscuity flavor. the finish has a complex sweet, almost caramel, and dry, biscuit again, combination.  Mouthfeel is really nice. Clean and lightly carbonated, just enough to be prickly, as well as a nice burn down the throat.  drinkability is good, though it can sit a little heavy and the carbonation may leave you feeling somewhat bloated.  overall a really great quality beer, the smell is really something else, and the taste is just complex enough to be interesting. Good stuff, definitely recommend it.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Belgian Dark Strong Ale,94
22,30,brewsky24,4.05,Very nice dark appearance. Has a near perfect mouth feel with just the right amount of carbonation. The smell is really nice and makes you excited to start drinking it. Has a very sweet bite at first that then dissipates into a mellow after taste that makes me feel like I just took a bite of an apple. I could probably drink this beer all day long and never get tired of it.,Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Belgian Dark Strong Ale,94

Poured dark brown, almost opaque with a 3 finger head that quickly decipated into a thin white film. Leaves no lacing.  S- Typical unibroue yeast, dark fruit, berries, a good mix of spice.  T- Dark fruits, candied sugar, clove, cinnamon, spice. You can detect the booze, but everything compliments eachother so well here, so it works.  M- Medium body, creamy feel. Medium carbonation.  D- This is a big beer given it's abv, but it's an absolute pleasure to drink. One 750ml is enough for me though.  When I first got in to craft beer I just didn't get any of unibroues offerings until I had this one. Now I enjoy them all, but this is the one that started it for me.

Almost too sweet at first, but is seems to mellow out as the beer settles.  Complex, but balanced taste overall. Definitely taste the sweetness, but it is very drinkable. Masks the alcohol very well and is very enjoyable. Label art is an added bonus.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Belgian Dark Strong Ale,94
22,30,curasowa,4.3,"Poured a dark, brown, cloudy color with 2 big fingers of head that faded slowely. Smells of roasted malt with some grape and yeast aroma in the mix. Taking a sip, the flavor fills the mouth with a chewy sweetness. A mild bitterness builds on the back end followed by a surprisingly clean finish that leaves you wanting more. The only downside is a slight medicinal note, probably due to the high alcohol content. Overall, a freakin' awesome beer!",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Belgian Dark Strong Ale,94
22,30,josiahschlender,4.1,"My first Unibroue try, Trois Pistoles pours an ambiguous murky brown with orange and amber highlights. Orange-brown tinted head isn't too impressive or long-lived for me. I love the hefty bottle and cork.  Very complex aromas, it seems like something different vies for attention with each whiff. Banana, cloves, dates, plus some alcoholic fruity sweetness that reminds me of a liqueur. While they're good, the smells aren't quite up to the intensity that I hoped.  Flavors are also very complex, something I love. Banana, dates and cloves are abundant at first, then give way to surprising bitterness and some sour notes at the end of a long dry finish. Medium-full body is adequate, maybe slightly too bubbly.  Overall a memorable and enjoyable beer. I got this in a very affordable Costco four-pack that only set me back a few bucks for the bottle. If I see them come up again, Trois Pistoles will be a good reason to snag that Unibroue mixed pack.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Belgian Dark Strong Ale,94

I'm having a lingering after taste of pear here. Maybe i'm crazy. Very nice beer though, easy to drink. Can't taste the alc. % at all. Very solid brew.  Had this again over a year later. Really enjoying it this time around. Have had a better appreciation for belgians lately, and this is quite delicious.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Belgian Dark Strong Ale,94
22,30,crnipeter,3.35,"Deep coppery brown with light tan head. Aromas of sour cherries, clove, sugar and alcohol. The flavor is governed by malty sweetness with reach fruity esters of sour cherries, quite cherry liquor alike. Generally on the sweet side but towards the finish sourish bitterness prevails with addition of palate-burning alcohol. Not particularly complex with alcohol to evident the beer is to sharp to go down smoothly. Anyway, this is a decent dark strong Belgian but only if none of the originals is available.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Belgian Dark Strong Ale,94

Good head retention.  S. Big smell of fruit. Dark fruit, berries, malt sweetness. Almost has a grape soda smell to it. Definitely one of the more unique smells that I have encountered, but it is very pleasant.  T. Complex flavors that are hard for me to describe. Dark fruit. Very fruity at times. Caramel, spices, alcohol. Some hops come out as it warms. That hard to describe ""grape"" flavor that I got from the nose.  M. Medium/full bodied. Well carbonated. Dry finish.  D. An elegant and uinque beer. Very delicous.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Belgian Dark Strong Ale,94
22,30,augustgarage,3.93,"Poured from a 750mL bottle into my Trappistes Rochefort goblet. Best before 05/05/2012.  Nearly opaque russet body revealing bronze highlights when peered down into from above. A wheat colored head dwindles quickly to a swirling archipelago, but then with tremendous crackling sounds builds itself back up to a creamy shoreline; an assymetrical sickle with good retention. Very unusual behavior. Lacing is uniform but somewhat thin, like a water-color wash.  Malt and dark fruit are the most pronounced aromatics, but the alcohol notes are somewhat incongruous, and borderline solventy/medicinal despite not being especially powerful.  The effervesence brings the flavors surging over the palate, with malt, plums, brazil nuts, and blueberries all suggested. Orange and lemon zest are hinted at as well, rounding out the profile. Brandy, cola, bread, and yeast form the finish, which won't commit to being sweet or dry.  Medium-bodied, spritzy and creamy all at once. Warming is pleasant and substantial.  A very good example of the style, but lacks the remarkable alchemical synergy of La Terrible. Perhaps a year or two in the cellar would be the remedy - I'll have to report back after concluding such an experiment.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Belgian Dark Strong Ale,94
22,30,Cs1987,3.98,"Appearance - Pretty much completely opaque and black. 2 fingers of head with good retention.  Smell - Dark fruits and sugar.  Taste - Very strong, sharp and biscuity. Surprisingly similar to St Bernardus Prior 8 (despite being a different style), but not quite as good. A little less complexity than I would expect from a Belgian style ale.  Mouthfeel - Very smooth, medium bodied.  Drinkability - Very good for the style.  Overall - This is not really one of my favourite Belgian style dark ales, but it is still very good.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Belgian Dark Strong Ale,94
22,30,patobandito,4.73,"My second attempt at a Unibroue brew.  Love the label on this, figured anything with that badass of a label had to be a badass beer.  Pours a magnificent dark brown with a thin head and some lacing. Smells of chocolate, vanilla, very sweet with a hint of some spices as well. The taste is incredibly complex. First it hits you with a bit of the spice, then it mellows out to a sweet, fruity blend, including apples. Extremely well balanced between the two. No hint of the alcohol, which is interesting considering its 9%. This makes it extremely drinkable.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Belgian Dark Strong Ale,94
22,30,GodOfBeer,4.69,"An old 2008 bottle. Pours a nice cloudy, very dark brown with a thick light brown head, decent retention, some lacing.  Magnificent smell, raisins, bananas, cloves, vanilla, chocolate, this has everything.  Taste is much like the smell, some dark fruits mixed with tropical fruits, caramel, vanilla, cloves and spices, chocolate cake, somewhat bitter with a perfect winey aftertaste. Wow what doesn't this beer have. The alcohol is very well hidden, watch out for it!  Exceptionally smooth, velvety mouthfeel. Highly drinkable for the amount of alcohol in there. By far one of the best Unibroue beers and the best BSDA I've had to date.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Belgian Dark Strong Ale,94
22,30,TexIndy,4.89,"Poured from a 12oz bottle into a snifter. The usual cool Unibroue artwork on the front label and a best by date (2-10-12) on the back label. Was a dark brown color with ruby edges. Had an averaged sized fizzy tan head that dissipated into a thin collar. Some carb streams but no lacing.  The aroma was amazing. Been at least 5 years since I last had this one and I had forgotten how great it smelled. Sweet fruit, spicy yeast and sweet malt with no real alcohol presence. I enjoyed that this one realized more on a banana and pear fruit than the dark fruit and raisin of most BSDA's. The spice also offset the sweetness perfectly. The taste was amazing as well and really followed the aroma. Spicy and fruity with a great balance and again no alcohol even though 9%. Very reminiscent of a great weizenbock. Mouthfeel had medium body with smooth finish. Good carb levels.  Overall, an exceptional beer. BSDA is a hit or miss style from me but this one knocked it out of the park. For me, this is the best BSDA by far. Outstanding. Rotation: avail here. Now that I've rediscovered it this one will be in the regular rotation.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Belgian Dark Strong Ale,94
22,30,Bugsey,4.57,"A beautiful beer to behold and to drink. Deep dark color with a thick creamy head. Smells like a plate of alchohol-soaked burned brownies (in a good way) with a leafy/grassy high note. Tastes is dry and clean, but thick and chewy going down. A bit of tightness, mineral aftertaste.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Belgian Dark Strong Ale,94
22,30,alcstradamus,3.71,"3 full fingers of head sitting atop an almost black body. Initial smell is a wave of musty yeast and spices. Some citrus character is also present, and a tiny bit of dark fruit.  The taste is spice and yeast forward. Unfortunately there is a bit of a metallic nature present. Hopefully that is just my bottle, because it is something that I will never accept in a beer. Apple peel and raisins round out the background flavors.  Mouthfeel is spot on for the style. This is a great beer other than that tiny bit of metal I tasted. It was a small enough amount though that I began to not even notice it after a while.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Belgian Dark Strong Ale,94

Yeasty  T: Ripe apples and fruit. Alcohol is masked very well. Very balanced flavor that evolves throughout the tastebuds.  M: Medium mouthfeel with medium carbonation  D: Very drinkable almost to a scary point due to the high alcohol content.

Not a particularly heavy mouthfeel - fairly medium bodied...a bit light considering the style. Pretty damn drinkable - I tore through this bottle before I realized it.  I can't say that I'm blown away by this beer in any way, but it doesn't do anything wrong either. It's just a very, very good beer all around.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Belgian Dark Strong Ale,94
22,30,DrinkyGuy,3.4,"I was shocked by the lightness of this beer, as a Belgian Strong ale.  Aroma- Very assertive scent of bing cherry, ripe dates and mild spice notes. Almost has a sarsparilla scent to it.  Appearance- Dark red-brownish color, reminds me of cherry cola. Light tan head that dissipates very quickly. No head retention, and very minimal lacing.  Taste- Over ripe cherry and bitter tasting fig and a slight hint of extremely ripe date fruit at the beginning. Very subtle baked bread in the middle. Finishes a bit warm, with the alcohol being higher, with a slight astringency to it.  Mouthfeel- Mid range, smooth and mildly juicy with a very dry finish.  Overall- Surprisingly easy on the palate for a Belgian strong ale, but a little too heavy on the fruit for me. I liked it as a break from the ales and lagers i've been tasting lately, but too sweet for me to drink more than one bottle back to back.  All in all, I think is a very good beer if your in to dark, fruit flavored ales and heavily alcoholed beers.  I liked how, even though it was a high gravity beer, it was uncharicteristically light and balanced, not EXTREMELY heavy on the fruit or the warmness of the alcohol, but a bit too much sweetness for my tastes.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Belgian Dark Strong Ale,94
22,30,TimDudley,3.84,"Poured - per instruction - into a snifter, the beer is an opaque cola. Big, fat bubbles rise and pop with almost no retention, even around the edge.  Smells of 'midrange' fruit. Cherries and figs. A swirl releases more carbonation (but still no sticking) and more aroma. Still fairly one-note, though, plus just a hint of spice on the fruit. Taste is uncharacteristically light. Sweet, malt, spice, and bitter mesh together in almost perfect harmony - to the point where it's hard to tell one from the other. Fruity sweetness, more cherry, some date, with some fresh-baked bread underneath. A hoppy spice, black pepper. Hints of allspice and nutmeg, maybe from the yeast. Trois Pistoles finishes clean and dry, with barely an aftertaste. Goes down clear and warm, the warmth being the sole hint at this beer's 9% alcohol content.  An increasing alcohol presence as the beer warms, particularly in the aftertaste. Much more spice towards the end, which makes the beer feel much more bubbly than it is.  Very long lasting carbonation, what one might expect from a bottle conditioned beer. Even with no noticeable head, the beer continues to feel bright and bubbly. On the other hand, it's very light on the mouth - almost watery. Not what I would anticipate (or desire) from a Belgian strong.  The one upside of such a thin feel is that - in concert with its balanced taste - this beer is dangerously easy to drink.  Light. light light light light light. For a dark strong ale, that's not the word that should come to mind, but it is. The flavor is spectacular, but it's a bit weak. The carbonation is perfect, but the feel is a little thin.

Huge pop of the cork, and some foam starts to gush out. Certainly did not lose any carbonation over the years. In the glass, it formed a huge head. But, it did look really good and fluffy. Dark brown color, with an amber glow. Smell was loaded with ripe fruit like plum and fig. Taste was exceptional. This rivals any Trappist dubbel I've had in a while. Fruity and sugary, but balance with a slight hint of alcohol. Very velvety mouthfeel. A pleasure to drink. Great pre-dinner drink paired with a wedge of blue cheese.

Very drinkable, this is an excellent Belgian Dark ale, I certainly plan on getting this again.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Belgian Dark Strong Ale,94
22,30,vishneda,3.81,"12 oz bottle poured into a chalice.  This is a great looking beer. Has a fantastic ruby red body, very dark and opaque like a stout. The dark tan head is solid and remains at one finger the entire time with ample lacing.  The aroma was a mix of very ripe dark fruits -- fresh raisins, plums, prunes -- and caramelized or brown sugar. It is a very sweet smell. Lighter notes of yeast, cinnamon and oranges are present as well.  It has the right flavor, with vine fruits and much of what was in the aroma coming through on the front part. In the middle there is a dark chocolate and perhaps nut mix that leads to the mild bitterness in the finish. As the beer warms a vanilla flavor also comes through lightly. The beer is sweet as the aroma announces, but there is a good balance in here.  The carbonation is very nice, even and not too intense, but lasting across the whole palate. Like the head, this beer held up nice throughout the session from a carbonation standpoint. I felt this beer finished a little hot with alcohol present in the close. I think this hurts the drinkability, though I am not sure you group a dark belgian ale if you want to knock back a few quick ones.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Belgian Dark Strong Ale,94

T- Ripe apples come through for me, fruity and a bit boozy. Pretty balanced flavor overall.  M- Smooth and plenty of carbonation. Sort of a sharp mouthfeel with the carbonation.

Smell: slight wheat aroma with notes of berries and with a chocolately atmosphere. Reminiscent of a cordial.  Taste: malty, slightly fruity with an alcohol bite. Not bitter. Has the same chocolate finish that was hinted at in the nose and it has the same characteristic: neither a slight note nor a principal component of the flavor, but a stage-setting atmospheric chocolate quality which is difficult to describe but awesome to drink.  Mouthfeel: medium body and well-integrated carbonation makes for a texture closer to creamy than to fizzy.  Drinkability: this is a sipper, if only to appreciate its qualities, notwithstanding its high alcohol content.

The pour in the Duvel tulip glass is a beautiful dark brown with a hint of red coming through in the light. Head is cream colored coming up quickly as I carefully poured (as with any corked beer bottle).  Very interesting smell. Grassy, malts, esters, alcohol.  This thing hits your tongue like pop rocks. Dry, champagne like feel. It melts in your mouth instantly leaving a foamy film of tight bubbles on the tongue and lips, very bizarre, but awesome.  There are many layers and stages of tastes here. Dry...metallic/sweet...spice/raison/dates...no..malts, or...wow! This is way to complex for me too descibe. It is a 3 second journey with every sip.  I noticed too when starring at the glass, the center of the now thin head is erupting with a small dime sized pool of recirculating bubbles. That is so cool. It forms a eye in the center of the glass.  This is my second Belgium strong. I still need to develop my palate for this style, but I am very intrigued by the feel and flavors.

Finishes a little dry with slight bitterness. I like a little more sweetness. Overall pretty good.  Mouthfeel: Its too thin. Almost watery. It is saved in part by being well carbonated, but remains not nearly full enough.  Drinkability: I like this one better than Maudite, which seems to be more highly regarded.

22,30,civilizedpsycho,4.42,"Poured bottle into goblet.  Appearance: Very dark brownish color that cannot be seen through. Mine poured with a very small head.  Smell: Strong malt base with much fruitiness throughout. Maybe hints of apple and mild citrus, perhaps. Very appealing.  Taste: Very sweet with a very smooth finish. Again, very fruity flavors throughout with the slightest hint of chocolate.  Mouthfeel: A fair body. Not thin by any means, but not thick or creamy; it's just right.  Drinkability: Excellent beer. Something I would like to get again...and again and again.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Belgian Dark Strong Ale,94
22,30,mdwalsh,4.37,"A: Two fingers of head with big bubbles. The beer is cola brown both as it pours and once it's in the glass. That is much lighter than expected. The head is tan/off white and leaves an ok lacing.  S: Chocolaty, raisiny, cherry smell, only slightly sour. No hops, no plain malt sweetness. Very good and inviting, not too strong.  T: Not ""typical"" at all, for Belgians or beer in general. Not too sour at all. No hops, but not too much candi sugar wither, which I think most Belgians have too much of. No alcohol taste, but plenty of complex malt tastes. A very solid aftertaste.  M: Creamy and not watery at all, which I expected a little from the color. Good amount of carbonation.  D: I don't know, even though the ABV isn't TOO high and it's not TOO heavy, I think this beer would get to me pretty fast. Too fast.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Belgian Dark Strong Ale,94

S - dark fruits(raisins, dates and figs)over-rippened bananas, brown sugar, tea-like spicy hops. also scents of red wine.  T - almost identical to the aroma. taste is quite complex, very sweet at first, but then opens up to a nice spicey and lingering tea flavor. this is slightly alcoholic, and makes for a nearly medicinal flavor. very interesting. the booze adds a little warth, but i would never call this beer ""hot""  MF - body is medium full, creamy feel and sharp carbonation, but not overly done IMHO.  D - goes down easy, this makes for a great after dinner beer. this reminds me of the months to come.

22,30,sisuspeed,3.43,"Trois Pistoles pours a nice dark color with a slightly reddish tint and a big foamy white head. The smell is lots of spice, possibly coriander, orange zest and the trademark Unibroue Belgian yeast smell that all of their beers posses.  The taste is fruity esters, grapes, kind of a vinous appeal. Almost tastes like carbonated wine with a little bit of malt base and bitterness. Some warming alcohol and flavor.  The mouthfeel is fairly smooth and creamy, but is then interrupted by a little too much carbonation and harsh wine like flavors. I feel like the drinkability and overall flavor of this beer could be enhanced if the malts were allowed to come through more. I've had other beers with a strong wine presence that I've liked but this one doesn't really do it for me. Not a bad beer, but not the first dark Belgian or Unibroue that I would go for.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Belgian Dark Strong Ale,94
22,30,ocelot2500,3.93,"Pours a deep, dark brown that is almost black with a small tan head that dies quickly. Not much lacing.  Smell is of funky spice with some dark fruit thrown in. Mostly the fruits are more figs, but not quite raisins and no apple.  Tastes of the dark fruit mostly. Again, not much in the way of apple, but there is some fig type notes in there. There is some spice, but not as much as others. There are also some chocolate flavors with the malt.  The mouthfeel is thinner than expected. It is not unenjoyable, but I would expect something a little more full given the style. Moderate carbonation with a slightly dry finish.  This is drinkable, and I would say it is more drinkable than others given the thinner feel.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Belgian Dark Strong Ale,94

The smell is a complex bouquet of earthy and grassy aromas mixed will vinous elements, dark fruits and maybe a hint of chocolate. The grassy and yeasty flavors are the most pronounced with undertones of the fruitier elements.  The taste is similar to the smell, with a sweet earthy flavor up front and a dry aftertaste. Definite earthy, grassy and grainy notes up front complimented by dark fruits. The finish is a bit vinous with a lingering yeasty or grassy aftertaste.  This is one hell of a beer.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Belgian Dark Strong Ale,94
22,30,kegger22,3.7,"Opaque brown with a respectable bubbly head that quickly dissipated. The aroma of aged dark fruit was there for me. It had slight cola taste to it, and also sour black cherries. No aftertaste. A little carbonation left even at the end for the tongue to play with, medium bodied. No discernable difference as it warmed up. I found it similar to Rochefort 8, which I was not impressed with. I will probably drink again, especially if I can find it on tap. I think it could be that I do not like the style Belgian strong dark ale.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Belgian Dark Strong Ale,94

Clear in the initial pour, but cloudy as the bottle goes down.  S-Belgian yeast, dark fruits (raisins, figs, dates, dried cherries, etc)  T-Nose carries through to the taste with a marked alcohol presence...not overwhelming, but definately there and warming. Some sweet chocolate covered cherry in the taste as well...delicious.  M-Well balanced mouthfeel with balanced carbonation and a medium full mouth.  D-Exceptionally drinkable. Another great beer from a brewery that has the whole Belgian thing down to a science.  This is damn near perfect. Now which is better, this or Brooklyn 2? My money is on this....",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Belgian Dark Strong Ale,94

Huge tan head parks on top refusing to give.  S - Grassy with Figs, raisins, and cloves in the initial pickup. Floral hop background and yeast round this one out.  T - Dark cherries and some chocolate with alcohol expected and only slightly noticed when it creates the belly warmth. Sweet with dark fruit and clean.  M - Classic Belgian mega-carbonation and yeasty body make this one a mouthful, literally.  D - @ 9% ABV it's moderate to low, but it isn't out of character for this style at all.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Belgian Dark Strong Ale,94

T- Bready and grassy malt flavors are blended in with some complex sugar notes. Nicely balanced with hops; also a nice tart flavor that reminds me of lime. Lingering sweet aftertaste.  M- Aggressive carbonation up front that really make the flavors jump. This mellows out into a smoother feel. Nice medium body overall.  D- Me second beer from Unibroue, and I enjoyed this one a lot more than the first. Really an amazing beer. I'm looking forward to trying some more from them.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Belgian Dark Strong Ale,94
22,30,joshuadlight,4.15,"Poured into a Chimay goblet which allowed the brownish plum colored brew to retain a small amount of head. The lacing was not there, but it was still a pretty beer. Dried fruits and great smelling spices and esters throughout. More raisins and old dried dark fruits in the tastes. It is supposed to be an old beer and it is. Taste like something that has tons of character. I love the diversity and complexities here. I didn't feel like I had 3/4 of a litre of 9% liquid either. Nice drinkability. I like this one much more than the Maudite I had the other day.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Belgian Dark Strong Ale,94
22,30,BamaBeerBuff,4.26,"A: Pours a deep and dark plum color with a very small, thin head. Zero lacing and poor retention. The color is rich and nice, but the lack of a quality head is a bit disappointing.  S: Rich and sweet dark fruit. Delicate spices like light cinnamon and clove. There's a light chocolate and faint toasted nuttiness. Very rich and bold.  T&M: Delightful flavor. Starts with notes of sweet dark fruit, burnt sugar, and dark spice that segue into a rush of raw sugar, rich fig-like fruitiness and cinnamon spice. Finish is long and sweet, but not cloying. Full bodied with a spicy carbonation. This displays a good bit of balance for how big it is.  D: Big, bold, and sweet, but it's still a pleasure to drink. An excellent strong dark ale, probably one of my favorites to date from Unibroue.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Belgian Dark Strong Ale,94
22,30,cbutova,4.42,"Pours a dark brown, almost black and opaque with a three finger head that recedes quickly to a coating on top of the beer. The head is very fizzy, light tan and not creamy at all, not lacing is left by it down the glass, this takes away from the appearance. The smell is good, belgian yeast, a good amount of fruits/citrus, maybe some raisins in there too. Tastes of belgian yeast, fruits, definately heavy raisins in here, good spice, alcohol comes in here but in a good way, malts, a very complex overall taste. The mouthfeel is good here too, smooth medium body with a PERFECT amount of alcohol warming on the tongue, mouth is coated with an aftertaste of raisins and dark fruits. Alcohol in this beer is great, it is used tastefully, there is presence but it does not taste chemically or over the top. Drinkability is good here too, it is not too heavy, the alcohol presence is good but not over the top, you get a good example of a dark belgian beer for a good price, have had this before and will continue to drink it and other Unibroue brews.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Belgian Dark Strong Ale,94

22,30,OnThenIn,4.92,"Appearance: A two inch tan head that dissipates surprisingly quickly in my DFH snifter. There is a tiny bit of lacing, but nothign truly remarkable. This beer initially looks black, but on further examination is a nice dark mahogany. Overall this beer is a looker.  Smell: This first sniff gave me this wonderful bready yeasty smell with some wonderful sweet malt aroma backing it. There is definitely a fruit smell to this beer that goes great with the malt. There is definitely some clove in there and somehow it just smells crisp. I can even smell some wonderful caramel to it. I also poured it in my signature DFH glass and holy shit there is a toffee a plenty. Totally different aroma going on here and the dark fruity I was getting earlier suddenly became rather tropical.  Taste: Definitely some strong spicy flavor in this beer, like black pepper. There are also dark fruit flavors swimming around in this beer like raisin, apple, and grape. Maybe even a hint of plums. There is a wonderful bready finish to this beer that I have never anything similar to. There is of course the sweet malt backbone to all of this just insane beauty. There is even molasses flavor in this beer. I am this beer has everything I could want from flavor and has showed a couple new flavors I was not expecting.  Mouthfeel: The carbonation is a little bit to high for me, but wow this beer is light and refreshing.Even though this beer feels so god damn light, due not get the impression that it is thin. This has a nice medium to full body. It finishes a little dry, but just slightly like a some of my favorite wines.  Drinkability: Because of how light this beer is, but yet so complex in taste and aroma I can drink this all day. I mean WOW I am in love with this beer. Also, even though I can feel the 9% alcohol there is no way I could tell from drinking this beer. I mean this beer is DEADLY. Deadly delicious that is.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Belgian Dark Strong Ale,94
22,30,CrazyDavros,4.12,"Gusher. Dark copper pour, lots of yeast floating round. Good head, nice persistence. Would have liked some lacing though. Aroma is lovely, with the Unibroue yeast, plums, prunes, blackberries, candi sugar, caramel, nougat, red wine and sweet sherry. Very perfumy/rose-like. Taste shows more of that classic yeast, lots of residual sweetness (candi sugar, I guess). Esters are reminiscent of lighter fruit than the aroma, namely pear and white grapes (more akin to a tripel!). Some alcohol, but reasonably well masked. Not as full a body as you'd expect, but it works well the the lighter flavours. Not too much carbonation (unlike a lot of the Unibroue beers). Very slight warming on the palate. Quite enjoyable. This seems to have a less dominant yeast character (than the other Unibroue beers), I'm pretty sure that's why I've rated it so much higher.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Belgian Dark Strong Ale,94
22,30,ToddT,4.37,"A- Deep brown color topped with a large tan head. Head dissipates quickly and leaves no lace on the glass.  S- Molasses , caramel, toffee, clove, banana, raisin, and spice are present in the nose. Very complex right out of the bottle, as it warms it becomes even more so.  T- Malt upfront, molasses and toffee in the middle. Complex notes of spice follow with cloves and pepper being the dominate ones. Semi-sweet dry finish with a warming presence of alcohol.  M- More than medium but not overly heavy, well carbonated for a crisp and refreshing beer.  D- Very drinkable, the 9.0% ABV shows up at the finish with it's warming effect. It's just enough to keep you from having one too many of these.  Another great beer from Unibroue.

22,30,JimsArcade,3.78,"Poured into a 12oz Sam Adams tulip/pint...  Pours a reddish-black into the glass with minimal head which dissipates quickly, gently lacing the inside of the glass.  Wow, I've heard of hop bombs and malt bombs, but this one I have to describe as a YEAST bomb. Underneath all the esters and phenols that are wafting from this brew, I smell dried fruits... mostly raisins and maybe a little prune. Still, it's nothing compared to the yeast.  Nowhere near as yeasty as it smells, it's surprisingly dry. Sure, there are the same dried fruits, witrh some black currant and blackberry, but the finish is quite clean.  This beer is silky-smooth, and I'd expect nothing less from Unibroue. Excellent Belgian yeast-like carbonation.  I could see myself having more than one of these, if I had a designated driver. Still, pretty drinkable for the style.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Belgian Dark Strong Ale,94
22,30,biegaman,4.62,"Black olive that, with enough light, reveals a very rich stain of burgundy. Although most remains a solid mass - and swirling makes restoration easy - parts of its head become decrepit; this gradual occurrence is well heard, the bubbles sizzle like meat hitting a hot pan. The constant resurgence of fresh bubbles, however, is equally as entertaining; their little crackles spew forth like lava and at hypersonic speed no less.  Sniff. Now pause. Now sniff again. Were you paying attention? Did you smell it? That's everything you can expect to find in a Belgian Strong Dark Ale. The lush dark fruits, any and all varieties, decomposing, musty and mature. The sweet, seemingly honey or port-soaked malts, their dark character almost evoking the thought of chocolate. Its phenols, amply spicy and intensely aromatic, tickle the nose with hints of pepper and clove.  We could do the same exercise with taste. Once again you'll note the pervasiveness of over-ripened dark fruits - plum, prune, red grape, raisin, both red and black current and, in particular, heavily bruised red apple, tart blueberry and wild blackberry. There is a definitively red-wine like character aroused by these hints of earthy, ripe dark berries as well as the strong herbal character (black pepper, nutmeg) as gifted by the yeast.  Trois Pistoles not only showcases the best qualities of a BSDA, it also displays many of the characteristics that we'd associate with a fine, aged red wine or expensive port. The presence of alcohol is respectfully noted but its potency wondrously concealed behind the complex interaction of phenols, esters and fine-grained nuances that come only with age.  The complexity of this beer is seemingly endless. All of a sudden the flavour seems to have shifted to chocolate and roasted red peppers, but still all the while maintaining its intricate port-like temperament. How can this be so supple and smooth, both warming and mellow, spicy yet sophisticated? Bordeaux, Chianti, Rioja, Madeira... what's missing? Chambly.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Belgian Dark Strong Ale,94

Smells lightly fruity and yeasty with a faint caramel sweetness in the background.  Taste starts with fruity notes of raisin and cherry and has lightly sweet notes of brown sugar in the back. A little yeasty and spicy in the finish.  Mouthfeel is mostly smooth with just a touch of prickly carbonation. Finish is somewhat dry. Pretty good stuff here, I never would have known this was 9% just by tasting it.

22,30,erz316,4.08,"750 ml corked bottle into duvel tulip glass, (damn! and I just bought the trois pistoles glass)  A - this is an extremely good looking beer, big head settles down to a good 3/4/ finger layer in the glass. colour is a very dark brown, like black but obviously not black. head is an off white colour, maintaining very well. the head looks amazing, like right off of a guinness draught. there are medium sized bubbles and then there are some at the top which are indefinitely small, which look like a cream of sorts.  S - the nose is good, but it isnt nearly as strong as it should be; there are no actively pervasive notes that jump right right out. a bit of cherry like swetnes and malt, some alcohol but not much; maybe some chocolate, but thats pushing it. definitely cherries though, that is one the only redeeming factor. the finish is extremely mild.  T -taste is good, but pales in comparison to the belgian versions of this brew; not a bad tasting beer by any means, not one that is living up to the hype either. a chewy malt palate is the most noticeable thing, really big malts and very creamy. initial tastes are of the malts and some fruity notes, dark fruit of course; currant and figs are what come to mind. then out comes the alcohol, there is no way around it. almost has a wine puckering tannin like flavour; if i wanted wine, i would go get some, give me the pure beer flavors. the finish is more of the same: malts, booze then some hop;s. not bad but the wholly lacking in relation to its belgian counter parts. the after taare is like brown sugar, alcohol, and fruit. a good beer, no doubt, but not crown ususrper.

Caramel in the finish with spicy yeast, light hop notes, and a hint of tobacco.  M - Medium-thick body, moderate carbonation, and a slightly sweet finish.  D - Very drinkable.

22,30,CoolJosh,3.71,"One of my first craft beers out of the safety walls I had built around my comfort zone. It is time to revisit.  Poured from a 12 oz glass, pours an opaque Deep dark brown with translucency around the edges. Poured no initial head, but a slight film has risen up as the beer warms.  Some chocolate is there but this smell is really mute. Belgian yeast and light sweetness. It smells like air, mostly.  The taste is typical to that of a belgian strong dark ale. Not nearly as complex as a Trappist ale, but the yeast strain is very smooth and really strings all of the flavors together. Nice rich dark cocoa, some vanilla, some sweet banana, belgian candied sugars, and clove. Really nicely done from the homies up north. Some nice fruit flavors rise out of the malt sweetness as the beer warms, mostly plum and raisin. The mouthfeel is a well carbonated and dances well on the palate. Would definitely go with this any day of the week.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Belgian Dark Strong Ale,94

Nose is characteristically Belgian with a nice fruity spice despite the dark hue. There's also a bit of chocolate aroma with a faint alcohol sweetness. This is a medium light bodied drink, which I always love in big dark beers. The taste is particularly fruity and spicy with a sweet malty finish. Hops are not in the forefront by any means, but there's a slight bitterness that really ties this whole thing together.

22,30,steveshields,4.63,"(For the record, I am probably DISGUSTINGLY biased toward this beer, only because I am a fan. I have NO affiliation with anyone who sells it or makes it.)  After Abita's Abbey and New Holland's Black Tulip today, I was not satisfied enough- I had to go back for some of Unibroue's Trois Pistoles.  This, I think, is my favorite, aside from St. Bernardus ABT 12.  Trois Pistoles is classic. It LOOKS amazing. DARK brown/black with very little transparency, with the exception of holding it directly under light. It froths up a bit on the pour and is heavily carbonated, which i love. Like a coke a cola but sooo much better. This is a beer you can HEAR.  It smells beautiful, with a PILE of clove scent that makes me weak. Seriously. I love this beer. It consistently smells fresh, malty, and is amazing.  The taste kills me. In the best way. This is my standby, and if a bar sells it in Chicago, I probably go there or would love to go there.  Mouth feel is exceptional. I am giving it a 4.5 hoping that there is something out there somewhere that tastes/feels better.  Super easy and delicious to drink. If you haven't tried this yet, you are missing out. It is easily my favorite beer, with St. Bernardus in a dead heat.  ENJOY.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Belgian Dark Strong Ale,94

(T)- Sweet berry flavors with bananna. Some yeasty bread amidst that almost liquorice flavor.  (M)- Smooth as silk. Spot on carbonation level. Rather refreshing and crisp despite its dark color :)  (D)- Despite its 9%abv, this brew certainly doesnt feel as such. However, I remember this beer to be much better than this.

The color was fantastic when held up to the light it had a beautiful black/red hue, I wish I knew some poetry to describe how much I like that color. There was a really weak head that disappeared quickly.  The smell was a little funky but not as weird as some of the other Belgian styles. The taste was both smooth and sweet, the 9% alcohol was barely detectable and this beer could be dangerous because of that. Fortunately it is filling as well so volume consumption was limited. The beer felt almost thick on the tongue but there was no burnt malt taste.  Unibroue, as usual, did a fantastic job with this beer and I will try it again when I can find it.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Belgian Dark Strong Ale,94
22,30,Wheelinb,4,Nice brown color with a tinge of red. When I first smelled it I got a nuttiness that reminded me almost of Amaretto then a fruit smell. The taste reminded me of fresh figs. I expected the beer to feel thicker than it was. I also found the carbonation to be nice. Everything I have tried from Unibroue has been different and interesting. This beer is certainly worth exploring.,Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Belgian Dark Strong Ale,94

22,30,argock,4,"Poured from 750mL brown bottle into an oversized wine glass. No bottling date. Purchased at Wine Warehouse (Charlottesville, VA) for $7.79.  A: Deep violet brown with ruby edges and root beer 2-3 finger head that disappears quickly and leaves a few specks of lace. A forboding appearance overall.  S: Dark fruits (figs, raisins, plums) and fruity yeast aromas dominate yet are accented by leafy, earthy hops aromas and a light spice and carob notes. Alcohol is faintly detectable.  T: The flavor is excellent with heaps of dark fruit maltiness, lightly toasted, with fruity Belgian yeast aromas and drying earthy, spicy, herbal hops. Very vinous and musty with a leathery, dry aftertaste. Alcohol flavors are nowhere to be found.  M: Feel is a bit light and more carbonated than expeted but not unpleasant. More chewiness would have enhanced the dark fruitiness and vinous qualities a bit more, although the lighter feel adds to the drinkability and sneakiness of the ABV.  D: A very fine Unibroue brew. Robust without being overly heavy with a dark, earthy quality that is inherent in Unibroue beers.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Belgian Dark Strong Ale,94
22,30,cavedave,4.54,"It pours a deeply dark reddish brown, almost opaque, topped by a creamy cap of foam that dissipates rapidly to floating islands and persistent ring. Certainly a less carbonated look than any of the four others from Unibroue I have enjoyed.  The aroma is orange zest, caramel, sweet Unibroue yeast, herbal and floral notes, and an effervescent feel to the bouquet in the nose. This is a wonderful smell. Additional inhales reveal some subtle spiciness.  The taste is a creamy seduction of dark fruit, yeast, candy, joined to muted floral sweetness, an undertow of citrus and earth, gentle herbosity, and mysterious undernotes that let the finish be long and juicy but still dry and clean enough to keep the flavors pure in the mouth. It is a dark and sweet flavor, and is wholly delicious. Taste-wise, the 9% ABV is MIA.  Mouthfeel is spectacular, as in above taste desc. Nuff said.  That this is a 9% ABV I find alarming.

Cinnamon notes are also there. Sweet malts and slightly tart and bitter as well. Not nearly as yeasty as the other ones from Unibroue I've had.  M: Medium-light body. The amount of carbonation is a bit too much for my tastes, though.  D: Probably my favorite out of the Unibroue's I've had, I could see myself drinking a couple of these without a doubt. I will most likely get this one again.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Belgian Dark Strong Ale,94
22,30,schmitter,4.38,"12 oz bottle into a tulip, poured a beautiful dark, brown with a nice head and great carbonation from the yeast. Smeeld malty, sweet and a bit like coffee. Coffee hints were presnt in the tase as well, along with notes of licorice and rich caramel. Deep fruits and banana scents also lingered. I loved this beer and would love to drink it all night.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Belgian Dark Strong Ale,94
22,30,mulder1010,3.63,"750, served in my Belle-Vue kriek glass.  A-- Looks like a very dark version of Coke. Head was a sand/ tan color. disappeared in about a minute or so. No real lacing. Good carbonation on it and it reappears quickly on swirling glass. S-- Like sweet coke but with some raisin and spices. Reminds me of the chimay blue in the smell department. Just a bit sweeter though. T-- Expected it to be a darker feel in the taste department. Sweet with Plum and rasin. Still has the coke sweetness to it which is odd. Mostly due to not expecting it. I want to think Chimay Blue with the taste. M- Pretty solid mouthfeel, except for the sweetness with this. More of the plum and rasin with the spices in the mouth. Kind of confusing because the beer is dark but tastes more like a hefeweisen in a lot of ways d- ABV creeps up quickly. Big time sipping beer, and one at that. Has a lot of character and is quite complex. Back of my mind so thinks Chimay blue in every respect but this is a dark ale. Biggest negative is the sweetness in this beer. Has a coke like quality to it in the sweentess. An excellent beer but in my mind a late fall/winter beer. Not nearly as good as La Fin Du Monde is but an excellent beer still.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Belgian Dark Strong Ale,94
22,30,bluemoonswoon,4.34,"Let's do it to it with some more from Unibroue. Breaking out my seldom used Duvel glass for this, really feel like cradling the aromas in the beer as much as I can.  A: Pours out like a Belgian Strong should, dark cola brown with a sandy fizzy head that does not stick around for long but comes back easily with a few swirls of the glass. Not much Belgian lace, maybe it's the ABV on this one.  S: Smells like a dark hefeweizen to begin with, ripe banana and clove but then transitions into a far fruitier complexity than it originally leads on. Cherry, raisins, plumb, cinnamon and sugar breadiness  T/MF: Rum raisin, caramel apple, nutmeg and cinnamon, plums, dates, almost nutty. Finish reopens the inital door of clove like spiciness mixed with a delicate sugary, ripe banana mix. I know that I'm not even coming close to nailing the complexity on this, with the alcohol so well hidden it makes each sip a pleasure, a fact finding mission to locate and discover new flavors in every sip. Mouthfeel is delicate, robust with a slightly dry, clingy finish. It's amazing how light a beer this big can taste.  D: A fantastic offering from a fantastic brewery, almost light enough to qualify as refreshing, if of course the alcohol were not factored in. A great sipper, though would probably be more fitting as a winter brew instead of a hot and heavy summer night sipper as it is at the moment of this review.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Belgian Dark Strong Ale,94
22,30,BeerImmediately,3.99,"Started off with a huge head, but dissipated very quickly; ruby and brown color, visible carbonation.  Sweet cola smell -&gt; like cherry coke, and maybe some dates.  Flavor was very nice - noticed cinnamon spice, sweet molasses, rich ripe dark fruits, and finishing with a light smokiness.  Unfortunately, the mouthfeel gets a bad score here - too thin in my book, and hardly any noticeable carbonation.  Overall, very easy to down this - even at 9%. Could easily have two in one sitting.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Belgian Dark Strong Ale,94
22,30,gatorbreath,4.61,"Got a 750mL, often do, often drink 1-2 or 1 of these and another unibroue offering...  Pours very dark with a lot of head, in a Duvel snifter, which sticks around and leaves some lacing for ya. The smell is good, lots of dark dried fruits, no hops to my knowledge. Taste is similar to smell very unique taste, and very good taste. Mouthfeel is very full, very complex beer. Leaves a taste of port wine on the tail end of the taste. Drinkability is great as the alcohol is hidden well.  A couple of these will have you feeling irie and I'd recommend the Don de Dieu, Trois Pistoles, and the 17.  Overall, one of my favorite offerings. Damn near perfect broue.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Belgian Dark Strong Ale,94
22,30,wl0307,4,"BB 13/06/2009, served cool in Tripel Karmeliet's branded long-stemmed, tulip-shaped goblet.  A: pours a very dark brown hue, nearly black as the yeast sediments do darken the colour a bit more; the beige beer head comes frothy, retreating slowly to a thin cap, while the carbonation is semi-lively and fine in texture. S: the nose is herbally-sweet malty upfront along with clear trace of rich dark candy-sugar, while densely-textured plumy flesh make up the second, fruity layer; perfumy flowery-esters along with a milder input of chocolatey malts, licorice and sweet nuts stay loyally in the background. Smelling like a true Belgian strong dark ale here in the glass~~ If anything, the licorice-ish black treacle notes are a bit too strong to allow for a finer balance - but tis just my preference, of course. T: a soothing and juicy entry of black prunes, black cherry preserve, candy sugar, sweet toasted nuts, and (mildly smoked?) black malts makes up the main theme, ensued by a slowly developing stream of semi-dry, semi-bitter herbs running underneath well into the very end of tasting, as witness to the good amount of hops used in the brew. M&D: at 9%abv., this full-bodied beer drinks very light indeed, as the carbonation level is most smooth and any alc. feel is kept at bay by the slightly lower serving temp. A delicious ale all round!",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Belgian Dark Strong Ale,94
22,30,cpmau11,4.2,"Unibroue Trois Pistoles 12 oz bottle silver foiled top  Poured into a snifter glass. Large two inch creamy head, brown body with rings forming around the glass. Smells very floral and malty. Taste is malty, carbonated, slightly roasty, not a strong alcoholic flavor. Mouthfeel is exceptional, warm and rich but not thick. Drinkability is good.  Overall I really like this one, its not the best unibroue beer but its definitely a good one. As far as Belgian Strong Dark ales, it fits the characteristics but its not breaking any barriers.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Belgian Dark Strong Ale,94
22,30,OtherShoe2,4.2,"Pours an opaque brown with some red/orange highlights peeking through. If the light is right, you can see a few carbonation bubbles trailing up from the bottom of the glass. The head, which was light tan/beige, dissipated to just a skim of a ring around the edge of the glass, leaves a ring of lace at every sip, but the ring disappears soon. Nice.  Good dark fruit/fermented fruit aromas, with some brown bread, darkened grain.  Some sweetness, but well hidden, kinda an alcohol-soaked dark cherry with brown bread. Lots of grain forward flavors. Alcohol, at 9% is hard to find in the flavor -- maybe a hint of chemical, but super smooth. Finishes with a little grainy yeastiness and fairly clean.  Decent body and some carbonation on the tongue. Perfect for this beer.  This onee is going down fast for 9%. Really easy to drink -- terrific stuff and by far my favorite from Unibroue.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Belgian Dark Strong Ale,94
22,30,LibraryTom,4.5,"It was a little cold and tight coming out of the cooler at the end of the party.  A ten minute hiatus, and she was ready to be drank. Tons of dark Belgian malt fruit, nuts, and dried fruits. True to its own style this beer doesn't particularly remind me of any of its brethren. Smooth burnt caramel, with a mellow sweetness that fades slowly into the background. A great one to finish off after the BBQ. Big enough to stand up, but not overly sweet or cloying. Low carbonation. Fantastic with the brownie I had on the side!  The yeasty character from the lees added later brought a fullness to the beer but did not overpower. I would enjoy with the lees at the end.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Belgian Dark Strong Ale,94
22,30,froghop,3.7,"pours a maroon with a huge beige head, lots of little bubbles, and good lacing.  smells of grapes, dark pitted fruit, some yeast, cocoa, and malt.  taste is fizzy, prunes, raisins, malt, cocoa powder, and a few hops in the back, ends dry and a little bitter.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Belgian Dark Strong Ale,94
22,30,ccrida,4.17,"Best before 10-14-11, I guess this bottles about 8 months old, 6 of which it's been in my cellar. Dark brown, like cola, with a loud fizzy noise and large light tan head that quickly settles to a thick creamy skim, leaving scattered lace.  Smell is very sweet, fruity esters, pretty classic Unibroue.  Taste is also super fruity and sweet, big grape notes, some fig and raisin as well, more so on the lingering finish. Spice from the abbey yeast.  Mouthfeel is smooth, a bit sugary of course, but light bodied, highly digestible.  Drinkability is pretty high if you like this style of beer. I've always been a big fan, although it's been awhile since I've had one of these classics, and admit it seems a bit simple.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Belgian Dark Strong Ale,94
22,30,mikesgroove,4,"Another goodie that I got to try on tap at Barleys last night. This one I had been wanting to try so what the hell right. Served in a goblet, this one was consumed on 06/11/2009.  The pour was very nicely done. Rich looking dark colors swirling around in my glass. A really nicely done looking head of off white comes climbing up and over the top settling down into a fine pillow. Lots of dark fruit on the nose here, prunes, raisins the biggest players by far. Light earthy notes and perhaps a touch of grain as well. Nice medium body,great carbonation here really letting the profile pop. Lots of grain and bready taste mid palate before it is washed away one last time by a nice touch of fruit and a hint of spice. Well hidden alcohol I have to say let this go down very smoothly.  Overall I have to admit this one was pretty damn good. Not the best, but very solid and I am glad I got a chance to try it on tap.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Belgian Dark Strong Ale,94
22,30,eat,4.29,"Poured from a 341ml bottle into an over-sized wine glass.  This pours a creamy, light-beige head which quickly settles down into a decent layer, but can't really be called a head. Deep, dark brown in colour with a blood-red tinge. This beer is as dark as some stouts I've seen.  The major aromas I can pick out are of caramel, blackberries and roasted malt presented in a fantastic balance. Faint smell of spices (cinnamon). This smells absolutely delicious.  Dark, roasted malt up front. Not as sweet as the smell would suggest, which could be a good thing since it essentially smells like a dessert. The flavours I would have expected from the smell aren't really coming out, which is too bad. If this would have tasted like a less sweet version of the smell it would be an easy 5 but I'm mostly just getting lots of roasted malt.  Maybe it's a bit too cold, I'm going to wait for it to warm up a bit...  Yeast and dark grains come out more as it warms. Still not as complex a flavour as I was anticipating. Bitter blackberries and raspberries on the finish. As with all the Unibroues, it seems, the high ABV is nowhere to be found.  Great mouthfeel. Medium-full bodied, creamy, nice medium carbonation.  Goes down smooth and smells real nice, but I'm really not picking up that much flavour here. It definitely doesn't taste bad, just doesn't taste like much. I would still buy this again though, as a good smooth, strong dark ale. I just wish it tasted like it smells.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Belgian Dark Strong Ale,94
22,30,OzarkElmo,4.38,"12 oz. bottle into tulip. Pours a very dark, murky brown with moderate beige head which mostly dissipates. Thin lacing throughout. Very, very pleasant aroma of dark fruit (raisin, fig, plums), slight caramel and vanilla, wood and hint of alcohol. Also well-carbonated throughout. Wonderful flavor and excellent finish of dark fruit. Yes, it has a kick but to me is well hidden. It is enticingly smooth & mellowfor its style and ABV. Yeast formations remain with head. Getting better as I partake of this great beer - a rival to the trappists IMO and cannot wait to have my 2nd - Cheers!",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Belgian Dark Strong Ale,94
22,30,DiabolikDUB,4.27,"Poured from Bottle into Snifter glass.  Pours a deep murky dark-brown with a booming slightly off-white head that is very bubbly and quickly dissolves to create a nice layer across the glass. The aroma is full of fresh berries with some yeast and a touch of alcohol. Flavor is sweet plums, slight bready malts and some dried fruits which I'm having a hard to naming. Its a very light beer and more than efficiently carbonated. Even before I knew what good beer was all about, this beer had me hooked from the first time. Extremely enjoyable.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Belgian Dark Strong Ale,94
22,30,MaxBrews,4.13,"Presentation: 355ml bottle poured into a large tulip glass  Appearance: Pours a opaque dark brown, only caramel color is coming from the bottom of the glass. Great head, made the mistake of getting yeast particles on top. Head retention is good, and dissolves into a great soapy lacing.  Smell: Yeasty, presence of alcohol, a slight caramel rustic charm, followed by a very slight floral and fruit note.  Taste: Slightly alcoholic although ABV is masked quite nicely. Yeasty, rustic, slighty caramel with an aftertaste of clove and a barrage of spice. Overall well balanced, not complex to the point of being mysterious, but too well balanced to be neutral and boring. Well balanced in an elegant way.  Mouthfeel: Perfect balance, not too carbonated, not bitter, not to smooth or sweet.  Drinkability: Absolutely great for a beer with a high ABV, you obviously couldn't drink many, but you'd want to. I think its less intense then la fin du monde so its a faster drinking beer. I still prefer la fin, but this is a different style. A great strong ale. Not complex enough for my palate to award an A+, but it is up there.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Belgian Dark Strong Ale,94
22,30,thirdeye11,3.48,"Presentation: poured from a tap at The Libertine into a Trois Pistoles goblet.  A: pours a darker brown with nice 1 finger head and tight bubbles. No lacing to speak of and head dissipates as it warms to nothing eventually.  S: vaguely of dark fruits like fig, belgian yeast and some alcohol in the nose.  T: very solid. Light chocolate notes and alcohol which doesn't burn; better as it warms. Over ripe bananas are quite predominant as well.  M: a little undercarbed maybe, and slightly on the thin side but barely.  D: I don't think I love it enough to drink all night but once warm its easy to drink!  Overall a recommended try for all Belgian lovers which I am myself!",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Belgian Dark Strong Ale,94
22,30,bfields4,4.2,Pours very dark with a reddish purple tint. Very nice full head.  Very sweet dark fruit smells with a little spice.  Dark fruits carry to the taste maybe coriander is the spice from the nose that also shows up in the taste. Cherries and a soft chocolate malt presence also provide for a nice complexity. The alcohol provides a nice little burn too.  Very smooth with a nice full carbonation. Unibroue very rarely disappoints.,Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Belgian Dark Strong Ale,94
22,30,bosco7,4.25,"Blackish brown with a nice white fluffy head.  Cola, pepper, coriander, brown sugar and yeasty funk in the nose.  Sweet cola and prune flavors hit the palate first followed by caramel and toffee. A bit of cherry and plum in the middle. Spicy pepper and coriander finishes the sample off. Flavors intensify as the liquid warms up. Nice.  The mouthfeel on this beer dances on the edges of being full and delicate. Very nice Strong Dark. Highly recommended.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Belgian Dark Strong Ale,94

22,30,walloon,4.47,"The nose of Moxie mixed with Coca-Cola and vanilla ice cream gives way to fairly dry chocolate, clove, and cinnamon on the taste buds. Sweetness comes back a little in the finish with notable orange citrus and a hint of anise just a hair too light to be called licorice.  The warm, spicy aftertaste is pleasant but lingers overlong. If Mr. Po-lice pulls you over half an hour after you've had one or two of these, he will want to know what you've been drinking.  Unibroue proves again that drinkability, complexity, high alcohol, and a reasonable price for the quality of the product may dwell in harmony in the same bottle. And yes, harmony can require a small sacrifice from everyone involved.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Belgian Dark Strong Ale,94
22,30,bum732,4.15,"Pours a dark, dark brown, nice creamy head, some lacing. Smells of heavy spicy clove, faint chocolate, some earthiness. Tastes of sweet clove followed by a nice spicy bitterness. Finishes with more clove and quite dry. Nice creamy body that feels great in the mouth (thats what she said).  A very nice beer, didn't really blow me away, but very solid belgian that is very drinkable and not overly sweet. Dry, spicy and delicious.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Belgian Dark Strong Ale,94
22,30,MetalHopHead6,4.1,"12oz bottle poured half into a wine glass and half into a small pub glass.  Trois Pistoles pours a dark chocolate brown with slight hints of red when held to the light. A light, bubbly two-finger head dissipates quickly, and lace fights a short losing battle to cling to the glass before falling to the body.  The smell is sweet and malty with the slightest hint of old fruit. The taste is also sweet, but with a more pleasant fruit (black cherry) dominance. The aftertaste is deliciously tart and sweet. The feel is bubbly and clean, with little-to-no bitterness.  Trois Pistoles is more delicious and refreshing than the smell and alcohol content would indicate. This would be good at the end of a long summer day or with a rich dessert after a winter holiday meal.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Belgian Dark Strong Ale,94
22,30,SirDrinxAlot,2.75,"Poured a very dark ruby brown with 1.5 finger head that dissipated quickly and left minimal lacing.  Smell was fruit, chocolate, fig, spice, and malt  Taste was malty and fruity with some light spice and malt. Sweet flavor in the finish.  Mouthfeel is thick with a strange carbonation. Almost like a sparkling wine fizz. Fairly smooth. Low drinkability.  This beer is described as an after dinner beer that pairs well with chocolate. Much too sweet for my taste and the carbonation was off to me. Wouldn't seek this out again. Sampler best before 9/3/11",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Belgian Dark Strong Ale,94
22,30,TLove,4.1,"750 ml bottle to Chimay goblet.  Appearance is dark blueish with a light head and a complex lacing.  Smell is ridden with those fermented dark berry flavors of blackberry and blueberry, which render so much to the flavor.  In addition to the dark fruits in the taste, there is a touch of cider, cherry wood, and caramel. Dark and complex and well-balanced.  Finish contains a grainy winterwheat finish with a touch of sweetness and yeasty sugars. Strong 9% ABV, but finishes remarkably well.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Belgian Dark Strong Ale,94
22,30,ByTor2112,4,"Poured to my Chimay Goblet. Pours a murky brown with a thin tan head that reduces to a film. Aroma-Dried fruits, cidery. Mouthfeel- rather vinous with some sweet flavors. Fruit flavors that bring out some of the cidery flavors/ some tartness. Good but nothing too complex, not bad. A froth on the palate releases the alcohol which is well-hidden. the label says it hints a port wine and that flavor is present to me at the finish. The grape comes through. I received a Unibroue sampler for my birthday. I have never really been drawn to their brews, but impressed so far.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Belgian Dark Strong Ale,94
22,30,seand,3.98,"Poured into an oversized red wine glass.  A: Pours a very dark brown, near black, with about a finger of light tan head. The head dies down fast, but leaves a layer on the surface and around the rim, which does stick around. Pretty good lacing.  S: Strong malt and fruits, with a touch of alcohol.  T: Sweet and pleasant, with a small hint of bitterness. Slightly tart on the finish.  M: Very carbonated, fairly full bodied and a little sticky. Almost has a bit of crispness, which I wouldn't expect from the style.  D: Would have no problem drinking more of this than would be a good idea, given the ABV.  This is a good beer, but certainly not my favorite from Unibroue. I'd probably grab a Maudite instead.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Belgian Dark Strong Ale,94
22,30,manchester81,4.43,"Poured into a tulip glass from a 750 ml corked bottle.  The beer is a dark brown, with a substantial, active, light brown head that leaves noticeable lacing. Beautiful beer! The smell is of sweet, rich fruit with a little bit of spice. The taste is balanced, sweet up front with a wonderful lingering aftertaste that I can't quite place. Mouthfeel is a bit on the thin side, but adequate. Drinkability is high for a strong beer. I will have no problem finishing the bottle.  Overall, this is a great interpretation of strong belgain ale.

Taste - An interesting balance to this beer. I like this one more than the other Unibroue beers I've tried. It still had plenty of spiciness but was more balanced with the rest of the beer.

Well controlled alcohol as expected for a dark belgian, no syrupy sweet, nothing crazy about it. Just nice.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Belgian Dark Strong Ale,94
22,30,Stavage,4.45,"Poured a very very dark brown. The head wasnt particularly large (noting it was poured into a fairly wide rimmed chalice) but who cares when a nice thick lacing completely covers your drink until the very last drop.  Very aromatic smell, very fruity, I'm thinking ripe wild berries and stone fruit with a nice malt undertone. Perhaps even an overripe/fermented smell but in a good way like a port or liqueur. Perhaps that liqueur scent is very very faintly of maraschino. With all this talk of fruitiness I feel like I should again mention the pleasant underpinning of burnt maltiness.  The taste is surprisingly light but complex. I generally dislike fruity estery flavours in my beer but this is different. I'm not sure how much that fermented berry taste is really just down to the smell. It is not at all too sweet, there is a suggestion of sweetness. Their is a very complex maltiness, almost a nice roasted flavour coming through, though this aspect isnt particularly strong. It's a fairly strong beer but the alcohol is well hidden other than it hits your head. There is a fruity spiciness too. I must say that the dark (80% cocoa) Lindt chocolate I had really complimented this beer well. It accentuated the musky qualities of the beer and the beer brought out an aromatic fruitiness in the chocolate.  A medium bodied drop but quite smooth and creamy and refreshingly dry.  A beautiful sipping beer that goes well with chocolate and I could imagine it going well with a nice wildberry compote.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Belgian Dark Strong Ale,94
22,30,OldSchoolGamer,3.8,"On to my second Unibroue review of the day. I've had this one before, and remember liking it. Well, here we go:  A: Pours alot like Coca-Cola. Brown, but light penetrates through the edges. Nice foamy head that is diminished due to the carbonation.  S: I get alot of cherry. Tart cherry, cherry pits. Maybe hints of currents and grapes.  T: Again, lots of tart cherry and cherry pits. Kinda sweet tasting. Other dark fruits like grapes and currents. Maybe a hint of roastiness. Pretty good overall.  M: Very prickly and very crisp. Medium to light bodied. Non-cloying finish. Yeah, not bad.  D: This one goes down easy, but coats the mouth and is pretty highly carbonated. Tastes good, but hard to drink alot of.  I haven't had alot of Unibroue brews, but this one is the best I have had. Its got a great dark fruit flavor and is very crisp and bubbly. 'I want to go to there' Liz from 30 Rock.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Belgian Dark Strong Ale,94
22,30,Brenden,4.4,"This one is black with deep chocolate brown highlights. A nice head forms and leaves a thin tan head liberally behind. Very complex aroma unlike anything I've smelled before. It's like a liquor, very much a whiskey alcohol smell with dark fruits, caramel, coffee, dark chocolate and toasted malts. There's also a touch of an herbal, grassy sort of earthiness. For something with such a high ABV, I'd expect the alcohol to be much more up front. It lurks and warms as you're sipping. Again, there's very much a whiskey element to this. There's a lot of dark fruits like cherry or plum, roasted malts, bittersweet cocoa, caramel and a biscuity note backed up by hops that leave a balancing bitterness that simply ties it all together. There's a very light spice that shows up more in the finish, which is also where I feel the alcohol the most. This one's dry and thick, almost chewy, with a big full body and moderate carbonation. This is like an expensive, very fine cigar. You don't chain smoke these things. Besides, you'd drop after a few. An exquisite brew.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Belgian Dark Strong Ale,94

22,30,gameface23,4.5,"Pours a muddy/murky brown with a nice looking tan head. Smell is sweet, with brown sugar dominating. The taste is great, with more brown sugar and plums. Not as much of a raisin flavor as other Belgian Strong Ales and I like this one better because of it. Drinkability is pretty damn good for a 9.00% Belgian Strong Dark Ale. I hadn't stopped wanting more even after finishing off the 750mL bottle.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Belgian Dark Strong Ale,94
22,30,Riccymon,3.6,"Pours from the bottle a deep brown with about half an inch of head that quickly boils away. Interestingly, I smell and taste the orange peel and coriander flavors I'd expect from a wit. Also present in both the aroma and taste are cherry and whiskey notes, with a bready flavor also in the taste. The spiciness in the taste and finish is strong and leaves my stomach a bit unsettled. Mouthfeel is quite carbonated, but on par for the style, and this is a pretty heavy hitter where the ABV is concerned. I enjoyed this bottle, but I think I'll save my Unibroue dollars for La Fin Du Monde in the future.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Belgian Dark Strong Ale,94
22,30,SleepyMonk,4.18,"75cl bottle corked and caged.  Poured into a chalice glass and it throws up a solid pale chocolate head that invokes thoughts of a strong latte. Speaking of coffee and chocolate - trois pistoles puts both to shame in terms of its darkness.  Smell brings the notes of dark fruits and roasted nuts.  The dark intimidating hues coupled with a fine nose promises a great taste and the drinker will not be disappointed. Complexity defines the taste of this beer. For the first second of holding this beer in the mouth there is a feeling of disappointment but that quickly builds into a toasty fruit taste coupled with a strong chocolate and molasses burst.  This explosion of contrasting, yet wonderful, flavors eventualy gives away and the drinker is almost left with a crispy feeling. The initial mouthfeel is heavy yet evenly weighted. The mid swing towards fruit et al and its a beautiful experience.  Not an all rounder and in no way a session beer. More like a late night sipper or a peaceful experience on a cold and rainy saturday afternoon - this is extremely drinkable.  Legendary beer!",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Belgian Dark Strong Ale,94
22,30,wesbrownyeah,4.31,This is a mean beer. Trois Pistoles... pistol in the face.  A- As dark as a beer comes almost stouty look on this one. Head turn in to a rim around glass no lacing.  S- Multi-complex scent of dark fruit and alcohol with massive hints of plums and more alcohol. Very alcohol smell...dangerous!  T- Smooth alcohol ester warm the buds with strong fruit flavors of dark dried fruits and sweet brown sugars.  M-D- Smooth enough mouthfeel for 9% alcohol and sticks to the tongue with massive estery alcohol notes. Nice change in flavor. Will drink again!,Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Belgian Dark Strong Ale,94
22,30,ritzkiss,4.15,"750ml, corked and caged pours into a chalice a dark, cola brown with big bubble head which quickly fizzes and cracks (quite the audio treat) and then leaves. Some bubbles coming up to leave a few on top of the beer.  Smell is lots of fruity esters, slight hints of molasses and brown sugar, some citrus.  Taste is smooth and balanced. Hints of cola, oranges, spices, citrus fruits, raisins. A little too carbonated for my liking, I think it would aid the smoothness and drinkability of the beer if it was dialed down a touch.  Really a nice beer from Unibroue (shocker). Their production is world class and this is certainly one of the better ones - my only complaint is the carbonation.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Belgian Dark Strong Ale,94
22,30,JMBSH,3.87,"A - A tan head almost instantly shrinks to barely a coating. So hazy that it almost looks a dark brown until held to direct light. Only then does a redness come out.  S - Very fruity. Reminds me of some candied fruit from around the holidays.  T - Again fruity. Cherries is the dominate flavor that comes to mind. The alcohol gives a warth and doesn't seem overpowering. After another sip, the spices really come out. I wish I had tried this beer closer to Christmas. It seems to fit for some reason.  M - Sweet and fairly carbonated.While the beer is strongly flavored, it doesn't linger long after swallowing. A hint os left but your mouth is ready for a sip to bring the flavors back.  D - Very drinkable though with the amount of spice and the high alcohol, I can't see being able to drink more then a couple.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Belgian Dark Strong Ale,94
22,30,daythree16,4.35,"Poured from a 750 ml bottle into a wine glass. Pours with an initial 3/4"" head that quickly fades to thin ring around the edges. Very dark brown in color.  Lots of dark fruit in the nose. The taste has those dark candied fruit qualities but there is a hint of sour cherry that really balances the heavy raisiny taste. The high ABV makes itself known only through the warm finish.  Mouthfeel is full and has plenty of carbonation. Drinkability is pretty awesome considering the 9% ABV and the heaviness that I usually associate with the style. This one definitely goes to the top of the list along with my Chimay Blue.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Belgian Dark Strong Ale,94
22,30,coalcracker,4.44,"Love Unibroue's artwork- depiction here is of a winged horse flying above some sort of castle.  Appearance: Pours a dark red/brown with a touch of head. Carbonating bubbles keep emanating from the bottom of the glass long after the pour. Smell: Spicy and very fruity aroma noted upon first opening. After the pour, sweet and ripe fruits (apple, fig, raisin) notable. Taste: Sweet and spicy initial taste- hops really well-balanced. Mid-taste brings out the fruity qualities as mentioned in 'smell', but also a touch of chocolate. Alcohol warmth pulls through by this point. Finishes quite dry with a long aftertaste. Mouthfeel: Medium-bodied and drying. The initial taste is also a little spicy and stings the tongue. Drinkability: preferable as a sipper to fully enjoy the taste complexities. A fairly high ABV will also limit you to less than a couple bottles. In pure terms of taste, not at all simple; a dream for beer advocates.  Overall- another pleasing beer by Unibroue. Well-crafted strong ale.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Belgian Dark Strong Ale,94
22,30,Buschyfor3,4.2,"Poured from a 12 oz bottle with silver foil wrapping into a 14 oz mug.  A: Pours a medium, nutty brown with deep amber hues around the edges of the mug; opaque with sediment in the glass (bottled conditioned). A light khaki, two finger thick head foams up but quickly vanishes. Leaves a very fine lacing (very tiny bubbles clinging to the side of the mug).  S: First note I get is a sweetness of dark fruits (dates, cherries). A spicy, peppery scent seems to dominate, likely from the alcohol. Then there is a hint of malts, creating an airy, freshly-baked bread note.  T: The first taste I get is from the malts, creating a grainy, nutty, bready taste, but not burnt or toasted in any sense - just tastes like doughy bread. Those bread flavors then give way to a bit of residual sweetness from ripe dark fruits, and a hint of molasses or caramel followed closely by a medicinal alcohol flavor - spicy and warming. In the finish, the yeasty, bready notes reappear, although drier with more emphasis on the grainy flavors.  M: Very crisp carbonation leaves a tingly, lightly ""powdery"" mouthfeel. Kind of what I came to expect from a Belgian strong dark ale with high ABV; definitely wasn't expecting something super thick and oily.  D: You can tell this is a high ABV beer - the 9% presents itself upfront in the aroma and fairly quickly in the taste. A couple sips in and I'm starting to get a warming feeling. Still, this a delicious strong dark ale and I would easily go for a second bottle, though I'm sure that would be enough to get me started on an evening-long buzz.  A delicious Belgian-style dark ale and another solid offering from Unibroue. The flavors are complex and yet not too in-your-face which I have heard is one issue new beer enthusiasts have with many Belgian strong ales. I would like to have this beer again, and I would also like to seek out other strong dark ales to see how the flavors compare, but this is a good first experience.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Belgian Dark Strong Ale,94
22,30,BeerFMAndy,4.74,"750ml bottle split. Poured into a Duvel Tulip. Best by date of 11/11/2011 as well as opening, glassware, and pouring instructions.  A - Almost opaque black with ruby highlights. Thick tan fluffy head that's got a good level of retention. Not much for lacing though.  S - A good delicate combination of esters, more specifically banana. Clay hints. Big yeast as well as some light sweet malts. Citrusy aroma pairs well with a very fruity smell and some bread.  T - Rich and bold yet delicate and complex. Fruity like crazy and yeasty as well as sweet with a superb citrusy balance. Slight spice. A mineral water hint is the only drawback to the flavor.  M - Smooth and rich, this velvety beer flows smoothly across the palate!  D - Easily drinkable despite its foreboding packaging and color. Totally awesome!",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Belgian Dark Strong Ale,94
22,30,IMincedTheKing,3.55,"Pours a cloudy chocolate with a beige head.  The nose is cidery yeast and dark fruits.  Tastes of sweet cherries and plums. A prominent yeast character, and an unexpectedly dry finish, but no real hop flavor.  It's a bit syrupy, and the ABV is quite high, so it's not exceptionally drinkable, but the prominence of the dark fruits (though, in my beer, they're not really my thing) make this warrant at least one try.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Belgian Dark Strong Ale,94
22,30,BBThunderbolt,4.2,"Poured into 10oz goblet. Poured a very deep mahogany color, almost black in the middle of the glass. Had about an inch of deep tan head that dissipated semi-quickly that left no lacing.  Deep, full aroma features a fruit aroma (cherries and a musky earth scent I couldn't identify). The flavors follow along nicely, with the fruit sweetness wonderfully countered by a slight, sharp tang on the finish.  Very good body, perhaps just a slight bit thin, that coats the tongue but doesn't cling. As smoothly drinkable as a 9% beer can be.  Overall a very good version of the style, worth seeking out if you haven't had it, and worth having again if you have.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Belgian Dark Strong Ale,94
22,30,roscoehnj,4.2,Dark brown to black. Nice head  Smells of dark fruit and Belgian style yeast.  Big dark fruit flavor with some spice and a nice long sweet lingering finish. A bit more carbonation than you might expect but pleasing.  Keeps you coming back for more. A very nice offering form Unibroue and quite a value as this can reasonably be compared to Chimay Blue.

22,30,juju7,4.47,"Poured with a weak, tan head. Very dark brown with ruby highlights. Great nose, chocolatey truffles and vanilla with some black fruits in the background. A fine, smooth drink with some nice liqourice and spice coming out with that Belgian yeast. Was lucky enough to enjoy this with some Belgian chocolates. Very tasty.

22,30,albern,4.35,"Unibroue is clearly the best brewery in Canada, and their Trois Pistoles is a very favorable offering. It pours a nice brown slightly mahogany color with a decent slightly efforvescent off white head, decent retention. The beer is bottle conditioned, but fairly clear in its pour. I didn't see tons of yeasty bits floating about. This is about the least boozy, well proportioned 9% ABV beer I think I've had. Wow, better watch out because this one is eminently drinkable. It is surprisingly light for what it is. The nose on the beer is raisin, orange, florals, spices, some sweet malts. Maybe a musty phenol in there too. There just is no alcohol in the nose, which is amazing for a 9% ABV.  The taste is very refreshing, quite light, not at all syrupy, very sweet. The beer has some caramels, some clove flavors, orange rind, some other vague florals. Boy, this is very smooth, with just a touch of the yeasty Belgian-esque prickliness underneath and the efforvescence to keep this more of a sipping type beer, but not by much. There is some hop presence, a slight brown sugar sweetness, with a dash of spices in the cardoman family. I'm enjoying this beer with each sip. This is truly an excellent option from the best brewery to our North.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Belgian Dark Strong Ale,94
22,30,joecast,4.7,"an imposing beer from the start. a sharp pfft and pours quite dark into the glass which gets slightly murky near the end. a decent off white frothy head sits above a near black beer with medium carbonation.  full on malty fruity aroma. classic bsda (at least from my limited experience). light belgian yeast character couples with some alcohol to hint at the strength of the beer. very gentle overall and begs you to take a sip.  taste exposes itself in layers across the palate. yeast character comes on a bit stronger here disguising itself as a much lighter wheat and yeast driven beer. another layer shows dark fruits and lightly sweet malts. alcohol never gets in the way with this beer wearing several masks to cover its true effect.  the best thing is, this gets smoother as it warms. seriously classy beer, well made and it shows. a pleasure to drink.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Belgian Dark Strong Ale,94
22,30,dacrza1,4.75,"Yet another treat from the October case... a fragrant yeast grabs the nostrils with that Belgian crispness distinctive to Unibroue... thick, dark body with an equally thick yet diminishing off-white head--substantial and worthy of its label... a mellow, even body--quite surprising--with a soft, retreating aftertaste that makes the drink that much more enjoyable.... a pleasant, refreshingly light mix of Belgian hops and something darker that makes this a perfect after dinner desertif. Something sweetly mingles with the beerish properties to bless Trois Pistoles with a light yet filling end. And where is the 9% alcohol? Perfectly placed somewhere, I believe...I could use the word ""perfect"" a few more times, but one gets the picture...",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Belgian Dark Strong Ale,94

T: Sweet again, with dark fruits and some brown sugar. Again some small tartness, hint of toasted malt. Very little bitterness. Very nice taste.  M/D: Full bodied, carbonation is just right. Drinability is exceptional. I could really drink this beer one after another. A very good example of the style.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Belgian Dark Strong Ale,94
22,30,bamadog,4.15,"Appearance: Pours a dark brownish/amber color; it appears a little cloudy; H-U-G-E 2 1/2 finger head is present and it's very fluffy and soft - does not linger long at all and fades to a thin, uneven layer of bubbles on the top; no lacing at all, just a thin oily residue hanging to the sides; On the swirl, the head finds new life and sprouts up again to just under one finger, but then quickly fades. Pretty cool to sit and watch :)  Smell: Smells like sweet, fermented dark fruits (prunes, raisins?); a rich dark maltiness is hidden beneath smell of the fruits, and a slight hint of burnt sugar; behind all of that is the scent of alcohol, but based on how it is worked into the smell and slightly hidden, I can only imagine that it is masked quite well in the taste.  Taste: Dark, sweet chocolatey malts really dominate the flavor spectrum, but right behind those would be the dark fruits, very sweet and almost candied; mild burn of alcohol, but as expected it is very well masked. There is a sweet spiciness to it as well... perhaps nutmeg?  Mouthfeel: A very nice body that is not too thick and not too thin; very smooth carbonation; slightly warming vapor from the alcohol that also leaves the mouth feeling a little dry.  Drinkability: Very nice, moderately high. I'm expecting the ABV to play into this though as I continue to drink it down. This is a tremendously enjoyable beer and great for a long night of sipping -- not sure if anyone would dare call that a session, but something that I am preferring to take my time with.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Belgian Dark Strong Ale,94
22,30,Riverwarrior,3.8,"S = A lot of dark fruit and some spicy elements in the background.  T = A semi-complex flavor of dark fruits (raisins mainly), caramel, and belgian yeast.

22,30,jnn4v,3.62,"A: Super foamy, very large head. The 12oz bottle didn't fit in my 16oz glass until I let it settle for 2-3 minutes and gently poured the rest. Not much sediment, but some haze. e.  S: Dried purple/brown fruits (ie. prunes, figs, etc), yeast, and possibly some spice. Not particularly pungent or sour, but not very sweet smelling either.  T: Yeasty, somewhat spicy, and overall fairly mellow. There were some hops in there to balance it and some minor sweetness as well once it warmed a bit. However, it's the bready, yeasty, dried figs/prunes tastes that dominate with a slight hint of mulling spices in the background.  M: Foamy, and foamy. Medium body once the carbonation dies down after 15-20 minutes.  D: According to everyone else tasting with me, this is a highly drinkable beer. In fact, we ran out of it almost immediately. That said, the alcohol was noticeable, and the lack of sweetness may turn off some.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Belgian Dark Strong Ale,94
22,30,amneziak,3.56,"Appearance: Seriously, there is just miles upon miles of off-white foamy head forming as I pour this one semi-gently into the glass. The retention afterwards is also very strong with a moderate amount of lacing. It then begins to blaze with loads of tight bubbles screaming their way to the top. This one has tons of carbonation and a slight cloudiness that runs through a beautiful dark ruby brown color. This looks like a really great beer.  Smell: Trois Pistoles runs very deep in its aromatic qualities. It smells really nice with some dark fruit components like figs and plums. There is also a heavy yeast aroma, too, which is prevalent in all of the Unibroue I've had. In the back of this beer comes an almost smoky and caramel-like backbone. As the beer warms in the glass there is also a presence of some earthy funk way down deep; almost like the inside of a deep dark cave.  Taste: This is quite nice, actually. The aromas carry over well into the glass and I'm getting the dark fruit components right up front. The yeast is still very apparent, but probably one of my least favorite things about this style of beer/brewery. There is not a lot sweetness here, which is good. There is, however, and good amount of bitterness that does not mute any of the flavors coming from the beer.  Mouthfeel: Trois has one of the driest finishes I've had in a beer. As I previously mentioned there is not a lot of sweetness, so there is not a lot coating the inside of my mouth. There is not as much acidity either, which is strange considering how much carbonation I got from the pour. There is a slight alcohol burn, but not enough to make this off-putting.  Overall: There are a lot of similarities here to most of the other Unibroue beers I've had. As someone who just can't get past the yeast in these beers, I'll say that this is not my favorite. That is not to say this is not enjoyable because I liked the entire bottle. I dig the fact that this one is dry and the flavors are still able to shine through, but I probably won't be knocking anyone over to get to this beer again.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Belgian Dark Strong Ale,94
22,30,dgilks,4.44,"341ml bottle poured into my La Fin du Monde tulip glass.  A - Pours a dark mahogany with a thin tan head. Looks very nice.  S - I like this, a nice rich smell, a little alcohol, plenty of spice and some fruit, maybe raisins. Very good.  T - Spicy and rich. The yeast lend some nice complexities to the taste, I'm getting coriander and raisins, maybe some other fruit as well.  M - A bit thinner than I expected, but better as it warms. A nice medium body with slightly below average carbonation but definitely enough to keep interest.  D - The ABV is far too high to make this a quaffable session brew, nonetheless it is tasty and goes down nicely. One or two of these will make it a night though.  Overall - Unibroue continues to impress with their brews. Trois Pistoles is a well rounded Belgian Strong Dark. Excellent!",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Belgian Dark Strong Ale,94
22,30,Kromes,4.05,Pours black with a very thin head. Smells yeasty and spicy. It had a rather unique flavor. The belgian yeasts and coriander spice with an alcohol warmth and black licorice flavor.

22,30,wheatyweiss,4.1,"Poured from a bomber into a chalice.  Pours a murky milk chocolate light cola color with a thin effervescent head that disappears quickly and leaves nice rings.  Aroma is of spicy banana bread and cloves. Malt comes through as sweet cake and is mixed with the yeast to make for a banana bread, fruitcake type aroma.  Flavor is malt and slightly metallic twang. Yeast is prominent and gives a fruity flavor. The grain seems like a darker roast on a lighter grain, like a roasted wheat? Alcohol is fairly well hidden and only shows upon the beer warming quite a bit.  Mouthfeel is surprisingly thin. La Fin Du Monde makes this look like water as far as thickness goes. Carbonation is very effervescent and bubbly, very active. Beer is very crisp and dry despite the sweet undertones on the flavor.

Mouthfeel: The carbonation is tingling on the tongue, the ABV gives a bit of a kick.  Notes: Yet another great Unibroue beer & highly recommended!

Dark fruits like grapes, cherries, among others... very complex.  T- Belgian spices, more grapes, cherries, raisins, plums, slight alcohol bite (gives it an almost chocolate-covered-apple-like finish). Dry finish. Smooth. Port aftertaste that sticks around for a while.  M- Smooth and creamy, while still light and refreshing.  D- Tastes great and goes down well, but I can't see me having more than one of these in a sitting. This is a great brew, but I wouldn't make a session out of it.

22,30,stagger,4.6,"First review: here goes.  A - Pours black or nearly so, lightening up just a bit as the lees are sent in (hey, you've gotta get your vitamins somehow). Fizzy 3/4"" head that dissipates within a minute leaving virtually no lacing. Lots of tiny bubbles (thanks, Don Ho!) making their way to the surface for another couple minutes.  S - My smeller ain't so hot (I busted it) but I do detect some fruit. The fact that I can smell anything at all on this beer means it's probably got some hefty nose.  T - Very nice! Moves through about a half dozen distinct flavours including lots of malt, caramel, and a surprising hit of - is that cherry? - on the exhale, before settling into something not cloyingly sweet, with notes of bitterness balancing it off, and just a hint of alcohol - the high ABV is well hidden. Nicely complex but not overwhelming.  M - As with most Unibroues, this one feels quite alive in the mouth. It's an active but pleasing carbonation with teeny-tiny bubbles. Sharp on the front of the mouth and softer in back.  D - Trois Pistoles is medium-bodied, slightly heavier than its little brother, Maudite, and very, very drinkable. Always disappears a little faster than I want it to; very more-ish.  This one has become my daily staple (hey, I'm getting my vitamin B fix) - and I always have some on hand nowadays. I do try to limit myself to one per session - that high ABV will sneak up on you something fierce. My favourite brew from one of my favourite breweries.

Medium to thin body. Nice on the palate until the end when it took on a bit of lingering bitter that lingers too long.  D = Alcohol is masked well.

Full of tiny bubbles rapidly pushing to the head saw it diminish to 1/2 finger and lace was medium in clinging. You could actually hear the fizz as these bubbles churned up, although in tasting, they did not seem present & definitely did not detract. The mouthfeel was smooth with a bitter plum skin flavor, with black coffee & hints of pear-banana-& lemon towards the end. Very interesting, to say the least! Slightly sour with enough bitter & sweet malts, it hinted at red wine-lambic in some respects. The 9% alcohol is not overwhelmingl, but definitely is warming.

Towards the end of the bottle when warmed up, theres a lot of black coffee and cherry flavors. great stuff.  Mouthfeel = a bit too fizzy. Loads of carbonation. Maybe too much here.

Spicy hops with smooth malt finish. No alcohol aftertaste despite 9% ABV. Excellent beer all around.,Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Belgian Dark Strong Ale,94
22,30,Thanby,4.3,"Dark amber with a thin tan head, but has decent retention. Not much lacing. Smells of cloves, malty, with some blending of citrus, raspberry and a little vanilla in the background. The taste is heavy on the malt, the fruit comes through well and mingles well with the cloves. Lighter than expected, a little estery and some butter keeping things mellow and smooth. Easy to drink, and that can be dangerous with the high ABV, but it's just hard to resist. Probably my favorite Canadian beer.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Belgian Dark Strong Ale,94
22,30,Beejay,4.14,"A: A very dark brown.. Nice creamy head on top, and a lot of sediment.. lots...  S: Ripe fruit, strawberries.. smells a little like sangria...  T: Very smooth and mellow.. fruity and delicious.. there is a hint of something sweet almost a caramel taste to it, rich and luscious with just a touch of tartness in the finish.  M: Possibly a little over carbonated, but still nice.  D: Totally, I first got this on tap, and wasn't overly impressed, but the second opinion proves that this is a beer that will last. Quite Delicious.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Belgian Dark Strong Ale,94
22,30,CMW,3.93,"A - Dark murky brown, almost black color with large off white head that has some serious retention. Lacing is fairly heavy.  S - Dark fruits, raisins and prunes. There is also some malt mixed in there.  T - Like others have said, it tastes similar to a red wine. Dark fruits mixed with some yeast notes. Alcohol is noticeable and finishes dry.  M - Medium bodied and slight creamy.  D - The sweetness is a little heavy but this is quite a beer. Not sure if I would drink more than one though.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Belgian Dark Strong Ale,94
22,30,GilGarp,4.42,"I just picked up a 12oz. bottle last week for $2.50. Considering the 750ml is almost $9, it's certainly a steal.  Foil wrapped top with a twist cap? That's strange...  Poured into the glass a very dark murky brown color with little head. It continues to rise to the top long after it's been poured.  Aroma is nice with that characteristic dried fruits and spice. Better than most in this respect.  Flavor is excellent with all sorts of fruitiness but subdued enough that it's not overwhelming. There's banana, fig, cherries, and dried apricot all up against an army of spice coming from all directions. Character and depth in spades.  Mouthfeel is full bodied and medium-high carbonation. Not over the top like some I've tried. Nicely done for a Belgian style. I could certainly have another or enjoy a 750ml over a long relaxing evening. It only gets better over time.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Belgian Dark Strong Ale,94
22,30,gciccarelli,4.37,"12oz bottle poured into snifter.  A - Pours a dark, near-black brown with a fluffy tan head. Lots of bubbles. Head dies somewhat quickly but a small amount of retention exists.  S - Lots going on here. Yeast and fruit - dark grape, hint of cherry perhaps? Hints of spice as well. Slight smell of alcohol.  T - Starts off fruity (dark cherry/blackberry), moving to a sweet malt taste and finishing slightly dry. Toasted malts. Reminds me of a wine almost...very similar finish. Impressive. Alcohol is slightly noticeable, just like the smell.  M - Medium body, high amount of carbonation. Leaves a syrupy coating behind.  D - Very complex, very tasty - great, but couldn't drink this all night.  Another excellent brew from Unibroue - very interesting beer. Reminds me of a fine wine...",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Belgian Dark Strong Ale,94
22,30,BigJim5021,4.28,"Pours a deep brown with a beige head that persists like a bad rash. Actually, it looks a hell of a lot like murky Coke. I know that might sound awful to the non-beer drinker, but it looks like money to me.  The aroma features the usual Belgian (style) components, with a nice whiff of tart fruit on the finish.  The flavor is plenty tart too. It's not a strong, puckering sourness or anything, but it's got a more sour bite than your average beer. The fruitiness plays really well against the malts and yeast. This stuff is damned good.  Mouthfeel is somewhere between medium and full bodied with a slightly prickly carbonation. The finish is bone dry. Really excellent.  Nine percent? You wouldn't know it from the way this stuff goes down. Like all of the Unibroue beers I've had, Trois Pistoles is immensely drinkable. I would give it a 4.5 if it wasn't for the abv. The price and overall quality of the brew is top notch. Why must the French Canadians be so good at brewing beer?",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Belgian Dark Strong Ale,94
22,30,williamherbert,4.3,"A 12oz bottle...  The head starts out tall like a cooking pot soaking in soap bubbles, but dies down. Deep, dark brown. Dark rose-black in the light. Thick and mega-cloudy; opaque.  The smell is thick and grainy like a dark barleywine. Hints of dark grape. Heavy alcohol and port wine aroma. Almost like a red wine in the nose.  The taste is lots of port wine and grainy sour malt flavors. Puckery and tart. Heavy alcohol finish. Dark stone fruits; grape and plum. Belgian spices at the end when it warms up.  The feel is smooth and buttery but a little thick. Not at all gritty. Milky but smooth. It's like a sour, ripe barleywine or strong ale. Tremendous to nurse for a long time. Great.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Belgian Dark Strong Ale,94
22,30,Mistofminn,3.89,"750 caged and corked bottle.  This Unibroue looks like a coca cola. Pours a mahogany like color. Produces a slightly brown off-white head. Decent amount of carbonation, no lacing present.  Smell is yeasty and fruity. I don't get fresh or ripe fruit, but more of a dried fruit smell. There is a definite sweetness, but not overpowering or unpleasant. Alcohol is present, but like the sweetness, it's not overpowering.  Very fruity and yeasty. There is a pronounced malt quality that I wasn't expecting, but pleasantly embraced. Too sweet for my liking. The alcohol is present, but well hidden. I am a huge fan of Belgians. But this one came up a little short in the taste department. Thats really my only knock.  Medium bodied. Very smooth. Has a kick from the alcohol.  Overall, a pretty good Belgian Strong Dark Ale. Although the taste isn't what I wanted it to be, it is still intriguing in it's own way. I enjoyed this, just not one of my favorites.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Belgian Dark Strong Ale,94
22,30,dougfir,4.23,"12oz bottle from a Unibroue sampler pack. It has a twist-off cap! Geeze... Anyway This beer pours a very dark amber..almost opaque in my chalice glass. Little head that quickly goes away leaving a nice, small foamy sliver of head for the duration of the drink. Smells slightly berry, definite malt, citrusy yeast. Tastes quite good. Starts off bright and fruity, quickly moving to a more malty, sweet mellowness. Finishes dry and yeasty. Very good. This tastes quite a bit like the Trader Joe's Vintage ale, which I believe is brewed by Unibroue as well. Mouthfeel is nice, good amount of carbonation and balance overall. Drinkability is good. I had the 12oz and wished for the 750ml. Given the high abv and fairly high maltiness though, it would be tough to drink a lot of this...it's pretty heavy. Overall it's a great beer and a very good dark ale. So far I've liked everything I've tried from Unibroue.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Belgian Dark Strong Ale,94
22,30,brewintheLou,4,Pours a very dark basically black. Head pretty much completely disappears.  I am getting a berry smell... I believe blackberry.  Dark berry flavors just like the smell. Almost like a black licorice. More carbonation than average and a thinner mouthfeel. Nice beer that I shouldn't pass up.,Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Belgian Dark Strong Ale,94
22,30,talkinghatrack,4.52,"a - rich brown with a creamy head and a few floaty bits of yeast that eventually settle in the glass  s - fragrant and fruity with yeast and a bit of inviting alcohol behind it. Some cinnamon. I know it sounds odd but it strikes me as a pleasant soap.  t - sweet, rich, fruity, toasted malts. Very deep. Tart and dry Winelike finish with warming sensation and slight mouth numbing.  m - full bodied and smooth all the way. Great medium carbonation.  d - thanks a lot, Unibroue. Just when I think Don De Dieu is my favorite I try this one. Now it's a toss-up. Highly drinkable at 9% ABV. A treat I will be sure to stock up on.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Belgian Dark Strong Ale,94
22,30,grayburn,4.28,"Dark amber with heavy lacing and 2 finger head  Bouquet of preserved fruit, nectarines, peaches, cinammon, alcohol.

22,30,BernardusHo,4.18,"This is a best value for those who like the style of Dark Belgians. Very dark in color and highly carbonated, this brew has a unique fruity taste that is hard to describe.

22,30,bskrtz,4.03,"Poured from 12 ounce bottle, served at approx. 39 degrees  A: Belgian dark ale.... enough said. A dark, cloudy brown ale lets little light pass  S: Sour yeasty mash. Bitter herbs & burnt caramel  T: Delicious -- almost Belgian.... tingly carbonation, sweet herbal tones, ginger bread & nuts  M: Dense, complex & balanced  D: Yes  This is another well crafted beer from our friends at Unibroue; made to mirror the Belgian Trappist style",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Belgian Dark Strong Ale,94
22,30,tmoneyba,4.18,"Poured a very dark brown with large tan head that lasted with excellent lacing. Aroma was complex of coffee, chocolate and citrus. Complex mouth full of flavors same as aroma with a complex finish with an alcohol bite and long duration.  Very good brew.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Belgian Dark Strong Ale,94
22,30,SeanRedd,4.3,"Blackish purple vacuum under a light beige head. Bottle exploded upon opening and poured an erupting volcano head that retains after. Aromas of blueberry, elderberry, strawberry, with a hint of dark chocolate. Powerful driving carbonation propelling an explosion of tart, fruity flavors tied together by tangy, bitter chocolate. Aggressive and brightfully complex. Crisp carbonation stings the palate, washing away the zest to usher in dry, cocoa, coffee, and rasberry. Excellent balance. An eloquent, explosive dessert.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Belgian Dark Strong Ale,94
22,30,JRed,4.25,"Pours an opaque plum color with enlivened off-white head. Strong scent of ripe dark fruit, grapes, plums, syrup. Light crisp in taste with notes of fresh plums, grapes, spices, slight alcoholic booze in the center that gets washed away by medicinal fruit tang. Very much like a good wine. Light oil on mouthfeel that slicks the tongue. Alcohol takes a back seat to the fruit while spice rides shotgun; a mystical potion of a brew.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Belgian Dark Strong Ale,94
22,30,jlb307,4.42,"Poured at room temp from the 750 ml bottle into a chalice.  A: Murky and black, but almost looked maroon in tone. Frothy one-finger head which dissipated quickly. No lacing. Almost looked like drinking a Dr. Pepper, just a little less red.  S: Very sweet, like ripened fruit. Even the wife liked it! Not overly sweet, as some of the 9% ABV was coming through. Pleasant aftertaste.  T: Like dark chocolate-covered cherries. Yeasty but nicely balanced. The alcohol was not overpowering.  M: Crisper than I was expecting. Really felt like drinking a cola, the carbonation was primarily coming off the sides of the glass. Lingering tingly feeling was left of the gums which I wasn't ready for, but kind of liked.  D: This was a great beer. I would happily keep a supply in my house. Be careful there, this sucker is dangerous. Another gem from Unibroue!",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Belgian Dark Strong Ale,94

Smell is really nice, some kind of fruit and spice.  Taste is really, really, really nice. In addition the mouthfeel is wonderful, creamy and smooth. Alcohol is hidden well in this one, but enough to warm you in the end. I can taste some kind of fruit and spice. Malt and hops are balanced really well in this one, not bitter at all.  Overall this is a great brew! Would definitely get this one again. Highly enjoyable.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Belgian Dark Strong Ale,94
22,30,KTCamm,3.56,"12 oz. bottle conditioned into a Duvel glass. Poured dark brown/black opaque with medium foam and lots of very small bubbles. No lacing.  Slight smell of fruit.  The taste is a complex mix of many things - I picked uo the bottle yeast of course, but also licorice, some coffee, some sour taste. Noticed the alcohol. The finish was strong and it left an aftertatse almost like a plum or hearty wine taste. Reminiscent of a port.  The carbination was lively in the mouthfeel.  Overall I liked this beer, though it was very filling. Not sure I could have a lot here, but enjoyed this one.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Belgian Dark Strong Ale,94
22,30,Bung,3.78,"Brown/amber pour, large lasting whitish head. Sweet aromas, some malt, yeast. Suprising amount of red fruit with caramel/toffee. Has a stick to it, but rather medium bodied. Quite a bit of carbonation, but it does not get in the way. Does improve as it warms. Not quite sure what to make of the Unibroue brews, it's like they're all the same beer with different flavorings added. Good but not great. This is my favorite however.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Belgian Dark Strong Ale,94
22,30,Rayek,3.84,"A: Deep copper with a fizzy orange tinged head that quickly disappears. Nice clarity for a bottle conditioned beer. Left no lace.  S: Heavy on the coriander, with prunes and raisins along for the trip. Alcohol adds an extra bite to the nose.  T: Dark fruits rule the day with flavors of black grapes and currants. Bitterness is mild, with a distinct pepper bite. Alcohol in the finish adds warmth. Finishes fairly clean for such a strong beer.  M: Medium body is quite undercarbonated; especially by Belgian standards.  D: This got better for me as I drank it. Right out of the gate, I found it to be pretty bland for a Belgian Strong Dark. Thankfully, it got more complex as I continued to drink it. The lack of much head and the watery mouthfeel makes me think that perhaps my bottle had a leaky cork. I might visit this again to see if I got a bad sample.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Belgian Dark Strong Ale,94
22,30,farrago,3.97,"Solid one finger head, active turnover of micro-bubbles, light brown in color, rapidly slides off the glass sides. Dark brown mahogany color with zinc orange accents. The nose is an avalanche of ginger, cumin, clove spice, spiced orange peel, caramelized brown sugar and attractive floral musk, as it normalizes in your nostrils the cherry, black raspberry scents come through, not anything here of note by way of hops. Medium-bodied, big foaminess which initially has your mouth as full as if an car safety airbag was activated in it. After that it becomes super-smooth and fluid, glides through the mouth. Huge inner mouth perfume of ginger, clove spice, swirls around unveiling orange peel, pine needles and chocolate covered raisins. The yeasty notes are like honey braised phyllo dough.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Belgian Dark Strong Ale,94

Spices and banana flavors along with sweet malts  M/D - decent carbonation, a good smooth beer, but there was something about the flavor that makes it not a completely pleasant experience. It was a good flavor, but maybe just a little too strong for me.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Belgian Dark Strong Ale,94
22,30,tzchandler,4.1,"Hello to the waitress in SFO who served me this beer at Rose Pistole. First of all it's not 2 pints it 750ml. That would be 1.59 pints. And another thing. Please don't pour the friggin sediment at the bottom of my glass. Thanks Micheal!  Ok, seriously. This is a pretty dam good brew considering it's not from Belgium but Quebec. (insert french joke here) It's very smooth, nice head but not extreme like Duval. The flavor is sweet and yummy but I can't help think it does not have the complexities of some of the brews from Belgium.  I'll definitely look to buy this again but I still feel it has a way to go to be at the table with it's Belgium brothers.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Belgian Dark Strong Ale,94
22,30,KentT,4.63,"Trois Pistoles is one of my favorite strong beers. It reminds me of caramel, grapes, figs, with malt thrown in for good measure. Has some hop character but doesn't beat you over the head with it. Has a nice brown appearance decanted. Smells wonderful with a a bakery appearance in the smell. Smells like Banana nut bread with some malty notes. Tastes like caramel, figs, bread, hops, and a smooth finish. This beer's alcohol content is very deceptive as it is so mellow. It's easy to drink for a high ABV beer and demands slow sipping to appreciate it's qualities. It grows on you in a quiet way. Subtle and powerful, feline in quality. Mellow and relaxing on the other hand. Complex and rich and better with experience. One of the finest ales extant.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Belgian Dark Strong Ale,94
22,30,AdmiralDiaz,4.56,"Poured from a 12oz bottle into a large snifter.  A: Pours a murky brown thats more on the dark side with a two finger light tan head with amazing retention but not much lacing.  S: Very bold smell. Smells malty with a small amount of hops noticeable. Other scents include a sweet caramel, toffee, date/figs, and possibly grapes.  T: A nice balance of malts and hops with almost no bitterness. A sweet caramel taste with complex fruit flavors dates, apples, and some sort of berries being the primary fruits. A small nutty taste I believe with a mild peppery finish. The alcohol becomes noticeable after a bit, but you wouldn't guess it was a 9% abv.  This was a wonderful beer that stays crisp and carbonated throughout the whole drink and doesn't reveal the alcohol it contains, very drinkable!....also I was lucky enough to get this in a 4-pack for $3.99!!! at Primo Cigars, Wine and Spirits in Woodbury, MN...the store should be listed here on BA soon!",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Belgian Dark Strong Ale,94
22,30,Stockfan42,4.47,"This beer was recomended to me by a co-worker of mine. Although that was a few months ago ive finally found a retailer in my area that carries this brew so here it is.  When I poured this beer into a glass there was not much I could point out as far as color other than the blackness it leaves in your glass. Its almost like pouring a can of soda, the head isnt really to present with its citrusy foam that fizz's all around the glass and its dark redish purple that barely gleams off the glass if givin the right amount of light.  A smell of cloves and or cinnamon (could be what stings my nostrols, cinnamon always does it for me) and there is a great sweet fruity smell present as well.  The Foam didnt hang around to long to give me a chance to get a good taste of it, but if its as sweet as the beer it coulda been good. My first sip I was overwhelmed by a sweet fruity, yet dark and malty flovour, there is much fizzing going on almost felt like I was drinking some hybrid fruit cola (as far as the feel of it went) but it went down pretty well not to heavy and pretty smooth. A little note of spices is left in the after taste, one I would let lingre a while before taking another sip.  My only dissapointment was finding out it was made in montreal. Me being a die hard bruins fan, I was not amused...Great beer though!",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Belgian Dark Strong Ale,94
22,30,StarlightSeraph,3.97,"Poured from a 12 oz bottle into a snifter.  Appearance: Pours dark, dark brown, almost black (I'd swear it almost looks deep deep purple in the right light), with a two-finger of slightly off-white head. The head subsided reasonably quickly. Surprisingly little lacing. A thin layer lingered for most of the glass.  Smell: Spices dominate (clove, cinnamon), with banana in the background. There is a sweetness behind it all. It just smells strong. Dark fruits come through.  Taste: I would never guess this is 9.00% ABV. The alcohol is barely present at all, only coming through slightly in the aftertaste as the beer warms. The tanginess of the spices and dark fruits come through in the forefront, then fade to a slight hoppy bitterness. Banana and honey notes linger in the background as well, contributing to a bubblegum sweetness. There's so many different flavors in this one, that each sip absolutely has to be swirled around the mouth to fully appreciate it.  Mouthfeel: Nice and creamy, perfect for this type of beer. High carbonation is a little bit harsh.  Drinkability: A thoroughly enjoyable brew, and one that must be savored over a long period of time. I don't know if it's one I would buy on a regular basis, but I'd definitely have it again.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Belgian Dark Strong Ale,94

Graphic novel worthy dark graphics: great expectations! APPEARANCE: Darker than expected. Cloudy due to too strong of a pour. The head settles to a 3mm ring that lives for the duration. Mild lacing coats the glass. SMELL: Yes, the expected dark fruits show up front and center. Raisins and figs. TASTE: Again, the raisens and figs. Maybe some plumbs as it warms. MOUTHFEEL: A flat but thick sticy-sweet tongue coating. DRINKABILITY: It is a shame to do any thing but sip (savor!) this one. It goes down fine with a little warming in the end.

S: Yeast, some fruit, maybe a bit of plum as well. Very restrained fruit smell.  T: Definite spice taste, a bit too much quite possibly without an additional counter. Finishes nicely, just a touch of warmth. Fruit is restrained.  M :Crisp feel, slight afterburn to the palate after swallowing.  D: A good tasting beer, I couldn't spend an evening with it but nice for a conversation. The warmth becomes more present after the first glass.

22,30,BARFLYB,3.77,12oz silver foiled bottle into a regular snifter carefully. Not sure of the date on this one.  A- Trois Pistoles has a red to dark mber color with traces of bronze and orange around the edges. A one inch deep white head with a medium build showed itself before leaving a thin sheet of lace. When it was full the white head was quite the sight resembling vanilla cream.  S- First wiffs I smell something resembling wine. After a while the dark fruits regular to this style come up some dates and figs as well as some pear and apple. Some weak spices as well. TP nose is somewhat weak compared to others in the style.  T- The dark fruits are first up including the dates and figs as well as an addition of licorice and raisins. A bunch a malt selections fight off an apparent hop punch trying to break through. Some spice including black pepper. The alcohol is a bit too up front and could of been hidden better. The alcohol really gets in the way.  M- A bit on the light side for this style and the amount of alcohol in it. Again the alcohol really stands out in the mouth. Would of liked this to be a bit bigger and bolder. A high amount of carbonation though.  D- At 9% two and through for me. This really doesen't warrant excessive amounts as the flavors are just not all together and integreated. The alcohol is also not masked too well. This is nice enough though to keep in the cellar from time to time.,Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Belgian Dark Strong Ale,94

22,30,marcpal,3.44,"Tasting notes on 2/4/09. After a hiatus away from Unibroue, number two in the sample pack that has got me converted. Not quite as good as LFDM, but tasty nonetheless.  12oz foiled bottle poured into Tremens goblet. Bottle Graphics: 1/10. Hideous.  A: Chestnut body, very low carbonation and a coffee colored head.  S: A tint of yeast, some fruity flavors, chocolate. Not really the same dried fruit that comes out through the flavors.  T: Not too sweet, especially for the style. There is some bitterness present, some spices, and plenty of chocolate and fruit flavors. The dominant character is dried fruit, specifically the taste of dried turkish apricots- those juicy brown ones. Just too dry.  M: Pretty full body and super dry in the finish. Lightly carbonated with a cotton mouth after effect.  D: Not the most drinkable and not its greatest aspect. A little heavy sitting but still a pleasure to sip on. Not something I reach for a second bottle of if I had it but something that I will lean on more often moving forward.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Belgian Dark Strong Ale,94
22,30,ncstateplaya,3.77,"It pours a very dark brown with nice tranluscent (clean motor oil glow) murky amber edges. The off-white head is a great contrast, unfortunately it dissipates very quickly and leaves no lacing in the glass.  The nose is dominated by dark fruit...mostly raisins and possibly figs. There is a mustiness that I think results from the yeast. There is also a little spiciness that demands your attention.  I thought the taste was similar to graphite and chalky. The chalky bubblegum flavor was between the hard ass stick of gum from 80's baseball cards and pepto bismal. There was definitely a sense of dark fruit although not as luscious as I would have hoped for.  Medium bodied ale that goes down smoothly with quite a bit of carbonation, leaving your mouth with a crisp feeling. There was a slight bitterness overshadowed by the chalky ""tongue thickening"" feeling.  Don't misinterpret my review, I thought this beer to be pretty enjoyable. The alcohol was almost unnoticeable and it has a spiciness that intrigues your tastebuds. A complex experience.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Belgian Dark Strong Ale,94
22,30,confer,4.34,"A- A hazy, carmelly brown appearance. One-finger light-brown head.  S- Dried dark fruit smell (prunes, and raisins), and a somewhat sweet smell.  T- Multiple flavor of dark fruits (prunes, raisins, plums), fills your mouth with bursts of immediate flavor which lingers for quite some time even after you swallow. The after taste is almost Cola-like.  M- Thick, smooth, creamy feel in your mouth.  D- For 9% ABV this beer is extremely drinkable, I would describe it as a 'Dessert Beer'.  Thanks to Don H. for this bottle.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Belgian Dark Strong Ale,94
22,30,droomyster,4.77,"Pours a cloudy, very dark mahogany with a light brown head. Smells of rich, dark fruits, sweet and tropical fruits, spices, and yeast. Taste is out of this world. Complex, dynamic interplay of dark fruits, Bazooka bubblegum, cloves, there's a LOT going on and it is all delicious. Medium body is packed with lively carbonation that lifts the liquid immediately off the tongue and fills the mouth.

22,30,TehAnkh,4.2,"A: Pours a dark, dark amber brown with single finger of off-white to tan head that disperses quickly. Fine lacing that seems to run away quickly. If you didn't hold it up to the light you'd think it was cola.  S: Grassy and little herbacous. I smell a little sweet cherry and a hint of milk chocolate.  T: Spicy and mildly sweet. Tastes faintly of cherry, some medicinal qualities come through that seem to throw it in to cough medicine territory. Hints of chocolate and light grassy hops. Esters are abound, and the alcoholic notes come through as if you car-bombed the glass with a shot of vodka.  M: Medium bodied and crisp. A lot more carbonated than the appearance in the glass would lead you to believe. Somewhat creamy, and slightly dry at the end.  D: I'm having trouble getting through my first one without getting buzzed. While it's medium bodied, I find it slightly less drinkable as the alcohol isn't quite as hidden as other offerings from Unibrou (such as La Fin Du Monde). However, it's crisp, refreshing, and I'd gladly crack open a second one... But that's it!  Notes: If it walks like a Belgian and talks like a Belgian, it may still may not necessarily be a Belgian. Like other Unibroue selections, it has surprised me with it's fantastic representation of the style. Dangerously drinkable, even if a tad strong.

A malty nose with dark fruits and light cherries, banana, and other yeast esters. A touch of alcohol.  Taste is malt with a big dark fruit component featuring rasins and figs. A light chocolate malt comes in with light fusel alcohol. Toasted dark malts layer in withthe chocolate malt. Finish is light hop florals. Dry and short with lingering bananas and dark toasted scones.  Feel is dry and grainy with light carbonation. Medium light weight.  An exceptionally drinkable beer for it's strength. Sneaky even though the alcohol does show itself a little is the taste. So well put together that you just keep on sipping and sipping.

22,30,biboergosum,4.03,"750ml bottle. All I can think of when I see this beer is another bit of Canadiana - 'Three Pistols' by the Tragically Hip. My native apophenia, I guess.  This beer pours a slightly hazy dark reddish cola amber colour, with three fingers of puffy, finely foamy pale beige head, which leaves broad swaths of undiscovered continent lace around the glass as things slip away.  It smells of yeasty, dark fruit - sweet raisins, figs, and cooked sour apples - a soft caramel malt, musty earthen cellar, a bit of candi sugar, and soft leafy, wooden hops. The taste is sweet caramel, toffee-tinted malt, softly tart black fruit, minor floral Belgian yeast, a twinge of metallic alcohol, and mildly spicy, leafy hops.  The carbonation is on the low side, yet pleasantly frothy, the body a sturdy medium weight, and decidedly smooth. It finishes off-dry, strangely, as the heady malt and yeast fruitiness is tempered somewhat by the booze and hop spice.  A rather enjoyable version of a BSDA, as there isn't any overly obvious astringency from the 9% ABV, which makes for surprisingly good (if slow and steady) drinkability. A pretty decent selection for the beverage component of the beer and pizza remuneration for an afternoon of helping friends move, I'd say.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Belgian Dark Strong Ale,94
22,30,ibbjamin,2.8,"Paid $7.49 for a 750ml bottle from BevMo in San Jose, CA. Poured into a goblet. There appears to be a date above the bar code on the back of the bottle; 01-15-11.  Pours moderately thick, leaving about a 3/4 inch creme colored fizzy head consisting of rather large sized bubbles after a standard pour. Very dark brown in color, it has dark ruby shades when held to a light. Much carbonation visually present. Some head retention and lacing.  Fruity nose of grapes mainly, along with some raisins. There is a yeast and sweet malt backing to balance things out. A bit too much on the sweet side for my liking.  The taste is also quite sweet as predicted by the nose. Dark fruits a la raisin, fig and grape varietal.  The mouth is somewhat overpowering. Quite crisp, watery and overcarbonated. The aftertaste is of grapes. Lacks the silky smooth characteristic I look for in a Belgian Dark.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Belgian Dark Strong Ale,94
22,30,jdklks,2.93,"not impressed. the beer pours dark brown, almost black, with a white head. smells of all different sorts of sweetness, but mostly black licorice. the taste is of malt, licorice, and the beligian yeast that haunts me so. ill admit that it is fairly complex, but this is not in a good way. it is overly carbonated, and has little drinkability.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Belgian Dark Strong Ale,94
22,30,FatCaster,4.37,"Poured into a mug and only then noticed the advisory on the bottle to use a snifter. OH WELL.  A--Dark brown, tan head, very little light allowed through the cloudy dark mass.  S--Fruity and rich, with a bit of caramel.  T--The smells transfer right into the tastes. Sweet but rich, with caramel type flavors running through and very little alcohol burn despite the content. No bitterness whatsoever.  M--Not heavy carbonation and pleasantly thick.  D--Not much to say. It goes down so easy that I am not sure exactly where mine went to. It appears to have disappeared.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Belgian Dark Strong Ale,94
22,30,aletales,4.18,"This beer poured the color of rich earth with a tight, caramel colored, well bubbled head that dissipated quickly. The aromas of licorice, and malt promised that the best was yet to come. On the palate it's vigorous carbonation was followed by a thick and smooth and creamy feel with a rich, roasted malt taste and a fruity finish. Certainly, the commercial description of a Port wine and ripe fruit is completely accurate. The complexity of this beer made every sip an adventure.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Belgian Dark Strong Ale,94
22,30,itcomesnpints,3.63,"Appearance: Brown, almost black with a nice head of foam. Smell: Caramel, dark fruits, molasses, raisins and yeast. Not as pungent as I expected. Taste: Initial sweetness of the malt followed by a surprisingly sour and tart finish. A little boring to be honest. Mouthfeel: Medium-Full body with nicely camouflaged abv. I expected great things from this brew after loving La Fin du Monde and Maudite, and was a bit let down. It doesn't offer the complexity I was looking for or the bold aromas and tastes that I've come to love from Unibroue.

22,30,mothman,4.19,"Poured into New Belgium Globe glass.  Color is a dark dark brown, nearly black. Pours a creamy, slight tan head. The head stays around for the entire time, however there is no lacing at all.  Aroma is very fruity and malty. There is a banana and clove smell that is dominate along with some carmel malts. Taste is very malty. There are a lot of flavors that seem to blend together. I taste the obvious bananas, along with cherries and raisins. There are slight grassy hops present as well.  Mouthfeel is rich and creamy. This is where the 9% abv sneaks out. The aftertaste is extremely clean; not sticky, dry or anything bad.  Overall, this is a solid beer. It is extremely easy to drink and the 9% abv is masked pretty well. I could definitely handle another, but that would probably be it. I highly recommend this beer.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Belgian Dark Strong Ale,94
22,30,discovolante65,4.15,"12oz from a four pack. poured into a chimay goblet.  Pours a caramel colored, cloudy brown with a good frog-eyed tan head with brief retention and some great lacing.  Smell is a good balance of yeast/bread dough with banana and alcohol. Maybe a touch of raisins in there.  Taste is roasted malts, sugary fruits, turkish figs are all I think of, when they're all crystallized. I get more raisins than in the nose and less banana, but it's there, towards the finish. I get some spice in there but cannot pin it down. Little bit of bitter cherries on the end. Has a wine-type finish.  Mouthfeel is just about the best. Creamy and fizzy. delicious.  Drinkability- This beer gets better the longer you sip it. It seems to balance itself out after it sits for 15-20 minutes. It is well-balanced to begin with, but really takes it up a notch as time passes. I grabbed this after a friend of mine got an assortment pack and broke the lone Trois. Good price on the 4 pack, so I went for it. I promised him he could have one, looks like I might have to ""break"" one too!!",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Belgian Dark Strong Ale,94

White sand colored head with great retention.  I smell cherries, port wine, chocolate, fruity berry and banana smells.  Tastes like ripe berries, cherries, and sweet wine.  Mouthfeel on this one is amazing. Leaves behind a bit of fruit and port wine taste on the tongue. No overpowering flavors, well balanced and well made.  This one is a keeper!",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Belgian Dark Strong Ale,94

A lot of yeast and alcohol in the nose too  The taste has a lot of fruitiness to it as well. Dark dried figs and raisins, fresh apples and pears, red grapes. The malt is sugary sweet and the hops are spicey and linger in the aftertaste. I drank this from a wine glass.  The mouthfeel is medium to thin bodied with a sharp carbonation.

22,30,CrellMoset,4.25,"Trois Pistoles, bottle from the Brickskeller, after 5 previous orders were met with ""We're out of that."" Wouldn't kill you to change your menu every once in a while then. But I digress. Supplied to me with a tulip glass.  Appearance: A pitch black brew (at least in this light), though close inspection reveals a few brown hues and overtones around the periphery. Atop sits a dull white though perhaps slightly off-white head of average retention. The inevitable recession leaves me with a bold but flat collar and a thick dusting of snow.  Aroma: Brown sugar and figs are the first to greet me, rather warmly too, though not due to any alcohol - the esters are instead largely fruity, grape-like, hints of cherry, other roasted, caramelized malt notes, and a handful of sweet and spicy earthy yeast notes. Quite the concoction I've got my face in.  Taste: Similar to the nose, but instead, in the mouth. Huzzah. Roasted malts, thick and sticky with overtones of caramel and light toffee, mingle with tons of dark fruits, raisins, more figs, cherries again, as well as your sweet, spicy cloves, your sweet, high-in-the-mouth bananas. Complex, yet somehow still formulaic. That's Belgium for you.  Mouthfeel: Huge sublimation effect, evaporating into a big even and full cloud as soon as it hits your tongue, though perhaps with some slight hesitation. Crisp yet creamy, on the whole very nice.  Drinkability: I'd been putting this one off far too long, and it was a pleasure to finally try it, even if it wasn't under the best of circumstances (I only picked it because it was directly in front of me, so I knew they had it in stock). Pretty much a classic Belgian dark, and though nothing here took me by surprise, I didn't want nor expect it to. I'm glad 750s of this are only $6.99 at Beer Run here in town.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Belgian Dark Strong Ale,94

Very dark red, not a whole lot of light passes through this beer. s : Sniffing reveals a slight fruit aroma, cherries, and a hint of alcohol. t : Taste reminds me of a red wine, has hints of dark fruits (cherries) and a slight alcohol taste afterwards. m : This beer coats the mouth well and leaves a nice tingly feeling after it has gone down. d : I would be able to drink a couple of these, but due to the high ABV it is not a good session beer. It however is not so heavy that it would be a bad beer to drink on a hot day (I know).",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Belgian Dark Strong Ale,94

Head has very little retention, but does develop a decent collar and a slight laciness. Very fruity aroma, reminds me of a wine, a lot of belgain sugars. Taste is very fruity, but sharp, and complex. Also a lot of belgain sugars in the taste. Light and thin texture, but beer sits very heavy. Overall this beer has good flavor and is enjoyable.

Appearance: Pours with 3 fingers of tan, dense head. This settles slowly, leaving behind a small amount of lacing and a thin coating of foam. The beer itself is opaque when full, but you can see the true reddish brown hints around the edges.  Smell: Smell of copper, dark candy sugar, figs, dark cherries and yeast.  Taste: Bready malt with a tart cherries and a long lingering sweetness. Slightly acidic bite.  Mouthfeel: Average to higher than average carbonation level, as expected for the style. Very creamy mouthfeel backed by excellent body.  Drinkability: I think I initially poured this one a little too cold, as the flavor and mouthfeel both improved significantly as the drink warmed.

22,30,DmanGTR,4.85,"Re-review: December 30, 2008 A - Gentle pour yielded a dark mahogany brown beer with a piling of off white head that retained beautifully in an Ommegang goblet. 4.5 S - Hints of mellow citrus with port, figs, and ripe plums. Some spiciness of coriander too. Excellent. 4.5 T - Initial sweetness of caramel malts metamorphs into a winelike taste of dark fruits. Toffee and a light roastedness becomes uncovered but is quickly finished with a bittersweet ending with grapefruit citrusiness. Aftertaste is abundant in alcoholic tones, port wine, and carob. 5 M - Full bodied and well carbonated. Quite smooth, sits well on the palate. 5 D - An extremely drinkable beer despite ABV. I can definitely do a few in an evening. 5 Overall - A most exquisite beer by a most exquisite brewery. This is an excellent beer to accompany sharp cheddar cheese or as an after-dinner dessert. Truly amazing. One of the finest Belgian Dark Ales I have ever had the pleasure to drink. --- Original March 19, 2008 A - poured dark brownish with garnet red hues in the light. Small bubbles make a 1"" head with excellent retention and decent lace. 4 S - Sweet fruits of figs, and raisins, caramel malts, some spiciness as well. 4.5 T - Caramel, raisins, plums, and spices. Balanced with a malty, portlike finish. I feel like I am doing this beer an injustice by trying to analyze it! 5 M - dark, heavier beer that sits well on the palate. Alcohol is well hidden and carbonation is very light. 5 D - a very good beer to enjoy over a conversation or with some currant cakes. 4.5 Overall - I don't even know what to say.

The taste is heavy on raisins, figs, dates, bread as well as yeast, sweet malts & apple. Slightly sour. The mouthfeel is crisp and acidic. Not as heavy as I anticipated.  This is a drinkable beer.

Leaves spotty lacing as you drink.  S: Roasted malt, raisin, and spice. Banana and a hint of apple.  T: Dark malt, yeast, and peat. Touch of sweet.  M: Robust. But does have a slightly diluted feel as well. Pungent malt starts and finishes. Dry finish.  D: It's a sipper for sure.  Robust and complex in flavor and nose. Strong alcohol taste and dry finish. This is not for everybody, but definitely something to sit and sip. The nose plays a big part in this experience.

Cherry cognac, with molasses, cedar, some leather and hint of sweet merlot wafts through the air.  The flavors closely follow the aroma, adding raisins, plums, followed by a sweet, slightly tart finish.

T: Big chocolate malts up front, with some ripe cherry notes. A spicy, somewhat peppery and medicinal character throughout. Overall, rather sweet in a sugary sense. Some grassy/herbal hops provide a bit of finishing bitterness. Alcohol is present throughout, although never cloying.  M: Chewy and on the dry side. Body is moderate. Carbonation is quite light.

Some of the other reviews could be similar to mine, but I would have areally hard time describing this beer as a strong dark ale. It was much more light and fruity. The beer had a strong yeast flavor and some hoppy fruitness that was very sour and citrusy in nature. I don't really like those flavors in my beer, so that's why I gave the beer a generally poor review. It wasn't awful, and I should say it had a really unique flavor. I will give it another try, but this time it wasn't that favorable in my mouth.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Belgian Dark Strong Ale,94

Unfortunately, this reminds me of a Romanian I know who would pour coke into his red-wine. Nice full bubbly head, that disappears after a little while, but the effervescence of the beer means there is always a small head lingering around.  Smells like a mixture of malt, port barrells, and Orange rind! The port/plum nasal quality really lingers nicely.  A taste of wheat, plum, and yeast, followed up by a warm port-like finish.

A: The beer is a dark brown color with a medium off-white head that fades very slowly and leaves a thick lace on the glass.  S: The aroma is of dark fruit, chocolate, Belgian yeast, some caramelized malts and a little bit of hops.  T: The taste starts with strong flavors of cherries, licorice and bourbon up front with some background flavors of chocolate, caramel and Belgian yeast. An alcohol sting seems to keep trying to poke its way through but gets blocked by the hearty malt character. There's a mild but complimentary hops presence that provides a good balance. The after-taste is slightly sweet.  M: Crisp and smooth, medium body, medium carbonation, pretty clean finish for a style that tends to be sticky.  D: Tasty, goes down easily, not too filling, strong kick, good representation of style, there are certain things that I've come to expect from Unibroue and at the same time I've come to know that they can throw a curve-ball once in a while. This beer has the Unibroue qualities I expected and also has the curve-ball with its fruity and candy-like taste.

22,30,strangemusic,4.11,"Pours a rich, very dark ruby/brown colour with an enormous, airy tan head into a wide snifter, the head settles down in time, but not until it lets you get a good look at this gorgeously-pouring beer.  The smell is not anything to rave about but not bad either: cherries and sugar mostly with a sort of toasty hint to it. This beer gets fantastic, however, once you take your first sip.  The taste is incredible and complex: a big hit of dark cherry in line with the aroma, with brown sugar and licorice tones moving on to that Unibroue signature alcoholic tang, mellowing and lasting long after each sip. I am fond of that particular element, as it certainly helps with savouring the beer. I tasted a bit of nut-like bitterness at the finish but it was very subtle.  In terms of mouthfeel, it's rich and carbonated but feels soft in the mouth. It's not too thick but still feels nice due to the carbonation.  The drinakbility is good for 9 percent ABV. Definitely a slow drinker. I wanted to keep sipping it over and over to experience the mouthfeel and big palette of flavours, but the potent alcohol lingering behind the fruit and sweetness served as a warning to take care.  Overall I would drink this whenever I could! Another Unibroue beer that stands out as a real winner.  I have to edit this review with one remark after the fact, as I tried Trois Pistoles from the smaller (regular-size, not 750ml) bottles a couple of days ago and it seemed to not be as good...

I wouldn't suggest it to many of my friends though I truly enjoy it because the complexity is likely over their heads. I have yet to run into a beer from Unibroue that I haven't deeply enjoyed.

However, over the holiday weenend, I found this in a make you own 6 pack for 8.99 and I couldn't pass it up. Here goes....  A - Cloudy tan to brown color with 1/2 inch head that slowly disappears. Appears somewhat thin. After sitting for several minutes, still cloudy with a little sediment forming at the bottom of my glass. Nice looking.  S - Wine. Grapes. Rasins. Prunes. Strong applesauce from Grandma's kitchen. Apples that have been laying under a apple tree. Fermenting. Fruit is very evident. Strong but pleasant. Reminds me of an apple orchard in late autumn with many different apples ripening on the ground. Earthy smell. Not my typical drinking beer but heard so many great things, I just had to.  T - Alcohol hits the nose and then disappears immediately. Very nice. Strong sense of apples and pears - like dark applebutter instead of regular applesauce. Some carbonination which is very nice. Besides the first sip, no alcohol present. Warms as it goes down. Crisp fall day. I really need to get out to the farm. Great around a fall campfire. Overall, very very good.  M - Thin but refreshing. Doesn't stick to anything. Light. Makes the cheeks and lips pucker somewhat. Can feel the beer all the way into the back part of the mouth.  D - Highly.

Not too sweet considering the type. Caramel, dark fruits, maybe a hint of chocolate, and the alcohol shows up at the end but not in an overpowering way.  The mouthfeel was fine. Appropriately smooth but not flat.  Overall the drinkabaility is fine. It came off as a bargain version of true Belgian dark ales but it was priced as such as well so I can't complain too much.

A: Fluffy yet slightly chunky 1/2 inch head that settles rather slowly down to a thin lace which remains for the duration of the beers enjoyment. The colour is deep dark amber.  S: Sweet dark over ripened fruits (plums, grapes and even a little bit of apple). The 9% alcohol can be detected but is masked quite well by the mouth watering scent of the ripe fruit.  T: Again with the dark over ripened fruits; however, I believe the taste of plums dominates. Alcohol is present but well masked. You can definitely feel the impression of the malt up front then as the finish approaches it is balanced out with subtle hops. The finish is long and involves caramel and port wine, very tasty.  M: Smooth with the perfect amount of carbonation that tickles the tongue but it still allows you to enjoy the full flavour of the beer.  D: Not in any way a session beer. Good for when you want to have just one full flavoured beer.  This is one of my first craft beers which I am revisiting and will do so again.

22,30,cwps48,4.7,"I took the 25 oz bottle out of the fridge for about 10 minutes before drinking. Obviously, the yeast was left in the bottom.  A: Poured into a tulip glass. Dark. Couldn't see through it, even with a light behind. I'm not a big fan of the head, so I try not to pour a significant one, but one was present regardless. It dissipated quickly.  S: Sweet. Very obvious fruity smell to it. Smelled of... figs and plums? It had a certain wine-y smell behind it.  T: Nothing really going on at the middle part of my tongue - only tingling from the carbonation. At the back of my tongue, that's when the magic happened. Very fruity. Sweetness from the fruits balanced nicely by a slight presence of the hops. Aftertaste similar to that of a wine - fermented grapes.  M: Very carbonated. At first at least. I had the whole bottle to myself, so it started to lose that carbonation. At which time the beer was much smoother.  D: I would definitely have this again. The food I was eating it with (something quite creamy) was probably not the best choice, but something tells me this beer would go very well with some kind of food...",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Belgian Dark Strong Ale,94
22,30,gouldnash,4.15,"This beer has many exceptional qualities. It has the brightness that is found in all Unibroue offerings. It hides its alcohol VERY well.  Most importantly this beer has the right balance of fruity SWEETNESS with fruity TARTNESS.  Pours an amber/brown color, with an effervescent white head. 750 ml bottle poured into a Chimay goblet.  Nose is predominantly cherry with some raisin and tart apple.  Mouthfeel is bright, like all Unibroue beers. I'm not overwhelmed by the sweet-tart fruit flavor or the alcohol. I find this beer to be particularly well-balanced.  Strong, tight lacing like a holey blanket in my glass.  I enjoy Unibroue's beers, and this beer is certainly shares strengths with the rest of Unibroue's line. A great beer, especially remarkable for its ability to hide its 9%.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Belgian Dark Strong Ale,94
22,30,WalrusJockey,3.82,"12oz bottle, poured into Duvel tulip.  Appearance- ruby/amber, darkened to near opaqueness. Head is nearly-white.  Smell- blackberries, spices, apples, cherries, alcohol and spring.  Taste- berries again, as in the nose, with a sweet into quite tart flavor, which retains its berry profile, while being mouth-drying tart. Swallow is yeasty into malty, with a malty fruit (every so slightly tart) aftertaste.  Mouthfeel- carbonation is on the lower end of normal, but feeds directly into the prickly tartness. Over-all texture is smooth, but not heavy.  Drinkability- Unibroue likens this beer to an aged port; and not for nothing. Like a good port, however, this is something to be enjoyed sparingly; you wouldn't want two glasses in the same night, probably not even in the same week,; but you will look forward to having it again, eventually, because it is very delicious.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Belgian Dark Strong Ale,94
22,30,yesyouam,4.18,"This beer pours into the glass as a cloudy dark leather-colored potion with a thick and fluffy off-white head. It has a rich lacing and the head is mostly diminishing. The clarity stops a couple centimeters into the glass. There are certainly living creatures in it. The aroma is a backdrop of a barn full of hay and the aroma of night-- of the flowers that were in bloom during the day but have closed up for now. At the forefront of the aroma is a big plump prune, tawny port and possibly black pepper and tamari. The initial flavor is moderately sweet and a barely detectable bitterness. the flavor becomes startlingly balanced-- lightly sweet, acidic, and bitter. the blast of flavor quickly recedes and the aftertaste is quite short. It has a soft and even mouth feel with a slight whiff of alcohol in the nose after swallowing. Very refined! (rated Jan 22, 2007)",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Belgian Dark Strong Ale,94
22,30,Tolnik,4.12,Poured this crude oil black colored beer into a pint glass. It came off with a nice amount of head and lacing after it settled.

Overall a great beer to enjoy.,Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Belgian Dark Strong Ale,94
22,30,cleeze,3.87,"Now this is quite dark if you ask me. Poured a hue black as night. It had a nice off white creamy head with more than decent lacing.  This lucious dark brew smells awful fruity. Dark fruits, maybe some raisons take over with some faint yeasty aromas  As soon as you sip this, the ripe fruits come out and bitch smack you right in the mouth. Also a bit sweet, maybe some brown sugar. Faint alcohol notes as well.  This is deffinaly a sipper at 9% but oh boy does this baby have some well balanced and complex flavors. ***tip*** let her warm up",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Belgian Dark Strong Ale,94

The colour is almost a deep opaque black almost plum shade.  A strong medicinal aroma with strong phenols and some spicy aroma accompanied by the yeast aroma.  Their is a strong alcohol taste with a sweet grape taste at the front. Their is a slight caramel sweetness to it and a medicinal cherry flavor as well with some added spice.

22,30,GatorBeerNerd,3.87,"12 oz bottle bought as part of a Unibroue mixed 8 pack from Whole Foods in Duluth, GA poured into a Hennepin glass.  A: Pours a very dark brown that has red highlights around the edges when held up to the light. Just a small covering of bubbles that tries to leave lacing behind, but the large bubbles don't stick.  S: Dark malt, Belgian yeast, and dark fruit aromas. Wonderful smell.  T: The initial taste is a very sweet fruit taste. Figs and raisin flavors seem to be the most prominent. Classic Belgian yeast and spicing are also mixed in. There is quite a bit of alcohol burn that I did not remember from previous tastings of this beer on tap.  M: The carbonation is a bit over the top. When added to the spice and alcohol in this one, it makes it seem almost astringent in the mouth. It seems a bit thin in body.  D: The spicing, carbonation, and alcohol cause this one to be a bit of a sipper for me. However, many in the style have that same characteristic.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Belgian Dark Strong Ale,94
22,30,magictrokini,3.66,"Wow, didn't expect it to be rated so high. Pours dark brown with a huge tan head. Aroma is full of malt and dark fruits. Lots of raisins and some apple. Taste was kind of thin. Almost nothing up front, then a burst of alcohol, sugar, spice, and grapes. As soon as these flavors appear, they disappear in the back. The aftertaste is nice and smooth, with malts and the port they advertised. I let it warm, and it was nearly the same. I just got tired of trying to appreciate this beer.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Belgian Dark Strong Ale,94
22,30,HalfFull,3.85,"From a 12 oz. capped bottle into a large wine glass, this beer pours a deep ruby/brown with a half inch of off white head. Head doesn't linger but lacing is reasonably strong.  Smell is of Belgian yeast, and some rich dried fruits combined with clean malt notes, and a touch of alcohol.  Tastes of ripe plum and dark chocolate covered cherries. Somewhat sweet but not overly so, a well balanced malt structure. Carbonation is a bit high thus shortening the finish of the beer, though the feel and finish do improve with a bit of warming and outgassing of the carbonation, thus yielding a slightly chewy malt finish. Decent drinkability for the style as the carbonation masks the sugar and alcohol reasonably well.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Belgian Dark Strong Ale,94
22,30,Fatduck,4.43,"Normally I try to pour all my reviews into the same glass, but I just couldn't resist the Duvel goblet for this one. Its a deep black with a massive bubbly head that fades down to a small layer. Smells like figs and sweet malt, taste follows smell and it tastes like figs, and a lot more, but my unrefined taste buds can only tell me that its good, and I like it, a lot.  It's bubbly and feels light in my mouth, perfect for a Belgian, this 750ml will be easy drinking... I'm glad its Sunday.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Belgian Dark Strong Ale,94
22,30,Stonebreaker,4.22,"Appearance: Very dark, with a good head though it quickly recedes and there is no lacing to speak of.  Smell: The aroma is dark fruit figs and maybe some sweet molasses rum.  Taste and mouthfeel: The taste is figs, nice herbal phenols, cola, no hops to speak of though they must be there since the finish is moderately dry. The mouthfeel is a little thin, acidic and fizzy but that is typical for the style.  Drinkability: Outstandingly drinkable for the abv, you can only feel it after the cumulative warming in the stomach.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Belgian Dark Strong Ale,94
22,30,LOCAL,4.4,"12oz into goblet  Appearance: Pours a dark dark brown with a one finger tan head that doesn't last too long.  Smell: Has that signature Unibroue yeast smell with hints of raisin, fig, and sweet malt.  Taste: The taste is big on ripe fruit, the raisin and fig and is balanced out by yeast and brown sugar on the back end.  Mouthfeel: Good carbonation. Very smooth and creamy. Extremely easy to drink.  Overall: Great beer, probably my favorite from Unibroue so far. For 9% ABV, the alcohol is very well hidden and it drinks with ease, so watch out. Could have a few of these... in fact I already have!",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Belgian Dark Strong Ale,94
22,30,oriolesfan4,3.94,"Another good, but not stellar, beer from Unibroue. From all the publicity this brewery gets I've almost been disappointed from them so far.. this is my 4th offering from them and nothing has really stood out. The positive thing about this one is how good it masks the alcohol... it's barely detectable but really knocks you back with the 9% ABV. Pours a cloudy brownish color with minimal head and a little bit of lacing down the glass. Smells of dark fruits and has a very spicy taste to it. Enjoyed it, but thought it could be better.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Belgian Dark Strong Ale,94

Light tan head rises to two inches and falls in a couple minutes to a 1/4 inch. Almost no lacing.  Smell: The aroma is very similar to another Unibroue beer, Maudite. Juicy fruitiness with a little bit of alcohol.  Taste: Flavor is also a lot like Maudite except that the alcohol is more hidden. Apples/pears, and some cloves as well.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Belgian Dark Strong Ale,94
22,30,TeamSeabass,3.7,"Pours a dark brown color with bubbles effervescing from the bottom. To borrow from an earlier review, it looks like Coke or root beer soda. The tiny bubbles on the head stay with the beer til the end.  Smell is yeast, pears, apples much like other offerings from Unibroue.  Taste is somewhat sweet, yeasty and fruity, but a little watered down for me. I think the alcohol has something to do with that. It finishes pretty clean.  Mouthfeel is nice as this is well-carbonated beer.  Drinkability is average for me. Its a good beer but it leaves me wanting, therefore I would probably not want more than 1 per.  I'm a big fan of the Unibroue offerings. Unfortunnatley for this beer, the distinguishing characteristic in my opinion is its a little watered down. The flavors are more subtle than what I'd prefer. Still a very good beer, though.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Belgian Dark Strong Ale,94
22,30,Ineedabeerhere,3.38,"Just picked up the new 4pk Unibroue sampler, I'm almost embarrassed to say that they were all new voyages for me.  This one poured a nice dark color with a light tan head and left beautiful lacing over the glass as the 1 finger head dissipated. The aroma was estery with some dark fruits- dates and cherries come to mind. This one didn't do too much for me overall- I can see the appeal but I wasn't getting too much in the taste other than a hefty mouthfeel with some molasses-like sweetness and dark fruits. This is a pretty heavy beer- both in ABV and in mouthfeel, I dont think I could tackle more than a 2 in a night.

22,30,sweetbrew82,4.42,"Poured from a 750 ML bottle into a snifter: freshness date clearly marked on back of bottle  P: Exits the elegant looking bottle a light leathery-brown with hints of dark red. Sits in the glass a deep brown while a shade of dark burgundy filters through the glass. Off-white head is sturdy, but doesn't stick around for long. Not much lacing is left behind after the head settles down to a halo on top.  A: Smells of bready malts, yeast, caramel, a dash of pepper, and ripe dark fruits reminiscent of plums, black cherries, and hints of raisins. Wonderful!  T: Really follows the nose. Bready, yeasty, and dark fruit flavors greet the palate with a hospitable welcome. Black cherries and plums dominate the fruit flavor, while dried figs and rum-soaked raisins pop up just enough to notice them about half-way through. The finish is quite dry and leaves the tongue begging for more as caramel shows up in the aftertase that lingers on and on. Quite sweet (but not at all overwhelming) from the onset to the mid-way point, but as the peppery alcohol warms the palate on the finish, a really nice balance is achieved. With every degree that the beer warms, more and more layers are unraveled on the tongue. Damn, this is tasty!  M: Unibroue Trois Pistoles has a medium-full body, leaning more towards full. It's really rich, smooth, nicely carbonated, and feels luscious on the tongue. Compliments the style and flavor nicely. Very pleasant.  D: Although the 9% ABV is beautifully camoflauged as being mellow, it does pack a wallop. I could see myself emptying two of these in a night's work just for the taste alone. But this is no session beer. I feel it's meant to be sipped on and marveled at for it's great craftsmanship.  Notes: This is a damn tasty brew! Mellow, rich, very complex, and extremely pleasant with a good alcohol punch as well. Looks good, smells great, and tastes even better. What a treat for the senses. Highly recommended!",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Belgian Dark Strong Ale,94

Finish is a pleasant pepper and a hint of caramel.  mouthfeel- Very carbonated, yet smooth and easy. Chewy, slightly creamy feel on the palate.  drinkability- Very drinkable. Perfect sipping beer on a cold night. Alcohol is well hidden for 9%, although detected in the warming aftertaste. High recommended.  My first hack at the Unibroue line. I'm pleasantly surprised.

Trois Pistoles tastes like it smells, only much more of all that same dark, lush fruit. As this warms up more complexity emerges, always remaining balanced enough to merit the highest possible score. I love it when a beer tastes even better than it smells.  M: Carbonation is ample and the body is medium to full. It leaves my mouth feeling very pleased with itself.  D: One 12ozER is not enough. While I am sipping this to make it last, I am confident that I could deal with whole champage bottle on my own. In fact, I seem to recall having done this sometime in the murky past...

22,30,PatrickJR,4.32,"Poured from an 11.2 oz bottle into red wine glass.  A - Very dark cola-brown, but there is a decent bit of light pulling through. A quarter inch of off white head rises with moderate retention, and falls to a very thin collar. No lacing.  S - Big yeasty fruitiness typical for dark Belgians/Beligan styles. Dark fruits are most obvious; everything from blackberries, currants, prunes, and raisins and some noticable fig and apple/pear characteristics. A touch of butterscotch holds things together behind the scenes. There might even be some banana hiding in here.  T - The fruits hit all at once in the mouth, like a quick combination of fig, berries, and apples immediately followed by chalky, dusty-tasting yeast element. This subsides and blends with an almost spicy element heavy on the cinnamon and clove. Slight bitterness in the finish with just a smidge of alcohol peeking through.  M - Medium bodied with a moderate carbonation. Decent. It serves it's purpose.  D - For a big ABV Belgian, this is quite an easy drinker. Not really for quaffing but not quite a sipper either. A complex and satisfying brew without being too intense or heavy.  This beer improves greatly upon warming.

This beer has a very nice, typical liquorice taste which a really like about this beer. Behind this you can feel dark fruits and berries. There's also nice notes of spices - especially I find clove when I taste it.

22,30,gueuzeonhigh,4.23,"Pours a turbid chestnut brown with a frothy sculptured head. The head didn't last long and collapsed back from whence it came leaving a few trace lacings and a minor atol floating around the surface. The nose wasn't exciting either-- in the very few seconds after the pour there was a bouquet of flowery yeast and hops, but shortly thereafter... this nose had flown.  The flavor redeemed all. No question a strong dark belgian style ale. A wonderful start to the flavor of yeast and hops, but this beer provided an almost three dimensional aspect to the flavor. No to be forgotten are malt notes and a certain sweetness but not cloying, that rounded out the almost bucolic nature of the brew. Mingled in with the three primary flavor notes were hits of citrus and a hair of caramel.  The flavor seemed nimble-- a strong presence up front and center on the flavor stage yet not like a stout.  The finish was an extension of the flavor that lingered in a linear way slowly signaling that it was time to take another sip.  Mouthfeel was very cordial-- the alcohol content was nicely disguised among the flavor's body and with enough effervescence to keep my palat stimulated and perky.  Drinkability made me get up and search through the beer larder for another bottle-- which I usually don't do-- so I'll give it an above average..  This beer captured the essence of a Belgian Dark ale without the flavor weight of a stout.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Belgian Dark Strong Ale,94
22,30,Dodo2step,4.27,P- Market Cross Pub in carlisle  A- a dark muddy and murky dark brown with shades of black. A nice lustrous head rises to the top of my pint. A nice burnt caramel lacing is left behind.  S- hints of dark chocolate but the dominant aroma is a grassy grainy smell. i also get hints of dark candied fruit as well. Interesting.  T- highly carbonated like a jones cream soda. A black pepperery taste with chocolate. It is very tasty. toasted as well....like bread. Somewhat sweet but is has some sourness to it as well.  M- bubbly like champagne. Craemy and smooth though.  D- This will kick your ass if you have more than 3 in sitting. Easy to throw back though but it fills you up.,Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Belgian Dark Strong Ale,94
22,30,everetends,4.03,"22 oz bomber purchased at Cheers Beverage in Carrolton, GA. Served up in a Mason jar. Yeah I said it. I drank a Belgian Strong Dark Ale out of Mason jar. Big whoop, wanna fight about it?  A: Pours a pretty nice dark brown that shoes soe really nice red highlights when held to the light. A really nice light tan head emerges quickly with just a light pour. The head has great retention and is incredibly fluffy and sticky. Nice chunky head just floats about and gets stuck in my beard. Very pretty and fun.  S: Smell is of some nice belgian yeast and malt characters. Then there are some really nice spiced bread notes coming out. The bread is very thick and appetizing. Plums and rasins come out as well along with some dark apples. Very nice smells that are warm and sweet. Diggin it.  T: Taste is much like the nose. Light in the belgian yeast category and the malt is smooth and sweet. The breadiness is nice with a rum raisin kind presence, but very subtle. Prunes, cherries and apple all show up as well but are a bit muted. This beer is very tasty, but it just seems a bit toned down. Stil very solid in the flavor department.  M: This beer is medium in body and is just a bit thinner than expected but this is not necessarily a bad thing here. It works for this brew. A high carbonation makes this beer very crisp, easy to drink and allows it to go down incredibly easy. Just a touch of fruit and spice remains in your mouth on the aftertaste. Very nice.  D: This is a pretty damned good brew. Unibroue has made some pretty solid beers in my opinion and this is one of them. Very nice and easy to drink. This is a very good looking brew to look at even when served in a Mason jar. All other categories are solid and this brew proves to be an enjoyable experience.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Belgian Dark Strong Ale,94
22,30,Kendo,3.97,"A: Poured from a 12 oz bottle into a Chimay chalice. Body is brown with crimson hues when backlit. A 1-finger tan head on top settles pretty fast.  S: Fruit -- I get grapes and apple skins -- along with an oaky or woody scent. Also candied sugar.  T: First impression is one of overall sweetness. I get that candied sugar from the nose, some ripe green apples and basic fruity malt -- maybe ripe plums. Heat isn't noted on the palate, but I feel it in the belly after a few sips.  M: Lighter in heft than expected. Somewhat fizzy feel, like a good Belgian-style ale should have.  D: Good but too sweet to be considered better.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Belgian Dark Strong Ale,94
22,30,Yesac,3.95,"Poured into Delirium tulip  A - Dark/solid brown with small white head that fades quickly into a ring around the glass with a small layer across the top. Could use more head in my opinion.  S - Fruits and toasted bread  T - Same with the smell.. rich dark fruits and some breadyness. The 9% is pretty well hidden.  M/D - Medium bodied, highly carbonated. Bubbles dance on the tongue. Sweet and bready makes it easy to drink and hard to put down.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Belgian Dark Strong Ale,94
22,30,JohnGalt1,3.77,"750 picked up over the weekend at Cost Plus for $7.... poured into my Smokestack Goblet.  1"" lite tan head dies fairly quickly over a dark brown beer that doesn't reveal any red until it is held to a bright light... little lacing.. but the cap is nice... sorta noisy.. like a quiet rice krispies.  Not as complex as I would have hoped for... still significant toasty maltiness... a little bit of toasted bread.. boozy dried cherries... a little peppery.  Flavor is very similar to the nose ... but with more of a spicy and fruity smack mid palate.. finish is fairly crisp and short... a little fizzy for the style... and mouthfeel is a little light... Overall... I will probably pick up this again... I've had it more than a few times before... but for the cash, there are better BSDA's out there.  3.5/4/4/3/3.5",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Belgian Dark Strong Ale,94
22,30,DefenCorps,4,"12oz bottle, best before 14th Dec 2010. Into my St. Bernardus goblet  A: Pours a dark reddish brown with brown highlights and a thin tan head with pretty solid retention. Tons of visible carbonation running up the side of the glass. Solid.  S: Smells fruity and rich, like a fruit cake with rum. Lots of dark fruit character with plums and raisins as well as some dark sugar like sweetness (dark honey-like).  T: Tastes like the nose suggests - pretty rich and fruity. Plenty of ripe fruit with a borderline over-ripe taste and the alcohol (which is very well hidden, btw) adds to that impression. Drying on the finish with a surprisingly metallic flavor with some fruity and yeasty flavors dominating. I've heard Unibroue beers have a characteristic yeasty flavor and i guess that's it  M: I initially thought this was thinner than I'd like, it works pretty well with the carbonation and the finish. Solid stuff  D: This is a great way to end a fun weekend, I'm enjoying this and will revisit",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Belgian Dark Strong Ale,94

22,30,nighthawk,4.7,"Pours a very dark brown with a thin tan head that has staying power. Notes of grass, malt, spices and alcohol in the nose. Taste is grass, spices like ginger and nutmeg, caramel, coffee, roast malts, and dark fruits to finish. Warming alcohol is felt throughout. Earthy notes come out as the beer warms. Mouthfeel is delightfully chewy, with smooth carbonation. Somewhat dry. With its high alcohol percentage, it's not a quaffer, but it's quite sippable over an evening. Wonderful, complex brew.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Belgian Dark Strong Ale,94
22,30,WHROO,4.07,"A: dark copper brown, full of suspended particles, could just see thru. Little carbs, although poured a 2 finger beige coloured head. S: very fruity, sweet raspberries & dark fruits with some port characteristics in aroma - quite strong. Also hints of florals T: Couldn't get past the feeling this had been infused with some kind of fruit - maybe raspberry. Very sweet, some floral, some cloves & no real bitterness. At 9%ABV, the alcohol is evident in taste & feel. M: Carbonation felt soft & a little moussey...medium mouthfeel, but nice & warming.

22,30,mnj21655,4.07,"12 oz. bottle poured into a chalice  Pours a very dark brown with a 1/4"" of light tan head that quickly dissipates. Aroma is quite nice although subdued, malts, fruity esters and some light phenols. Taste is like the aroma. There is a distinct caramel maltyness the supports the other flavors (and aromas). The esters are mostly of darker fruit, think dark cherries, etc. but there is also a touch of green apple that actually melded well with the other flavors here. The very light phenolic spicyness in the aroma is a bit more amplified in the flavor. There is a distinct alcohol presence in the flavor that I initially did not find in the aroma. However as I sip this brew I begin to detect some perfumes from the alcohol that are quite pleasant. I was looking for a bit more in the way of the esters here but this ""style"" is open to considerable interpretation. Mouthfeel is pretty good, maybe a bit too heavy (I prefer more highly attenuated trappist versions) with medium+ body and moderate carbonation. Drinkability is pretty darn good. This really wasn't quite what I was expecting (it seemed to lack some complexity) but I really enjoyed it none the less.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Belgian Dark Strong Ale,94
22,30,theboozecruise,3.88,"Had this one in a bottle poured into a chimay goblet.  A very dark color, thick enough to where not much light passes through, and an off-white finger of head. The head is slow to dissipate into creamy swirls on the surface of the beer.  The aroma is hard to really place too well... there's some fruit, a little chocolate maybe? It smells inviting for sure, and everything about it screams ALE!!!  The taste is malty, with that chocolate definitely present as well. A bit of an aftertaste similar to raisins. Definitely has a mouthfeel like I've been eating some fruit, but the alcohol is hardly present.  Not a bad beer at all, but this one is hard for me to place. Maybe I'm stuffed up too much right now or something, but I'm not catching all the flavor I know should be there.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Belgian Dark Strong Ale,94
22,30,ComradeK,4.32,"Ok, my first review here, on one of the first good non-mass produced beers I've ever tried, so I don't have much to compare to...Anyway, here goes:  Appearance: Nice and dark, poured thick, but not incredibly so. Head dissipated slowly. Bubbles struggled to the surface. Over all a good looking beer.  Smell: Like getting punched in the face by distinct fruitiness. The smell I pick up is raisin-ish, Also a bit of spiciness and sweetness. Whatever it may be, it smells damn good.  Taste: Wow. Maybe this is just my inexperience, but I've never tasted anything like this. Fruit, definite fruitiness. Doesn't taste like 9%, hops are there but hard to notice. Aftertaste of molasses or even something like dates or raisins, and maybe a hint of black licorice.  Mouthfeel: Carbonation is less than what I've experienced before. Feels thick, like it looks. Smooth.  Drinkability: Definitely not a session beer, but rather the kind you sit and enjoy for its complex flavours. Very easy to drink, even with it's 9% ABV. A keeper for sure.  And there you have it.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Belgian Dark Strong Ale,94
22,30,bjoyce12,4.27,"You know it when you have a Unibroue. There is a distinctness to their wares, much like the distinctness to a Dogfish or a Flying Dog. You just know it's one of theirs. For Unibroue, it's the aroma. Especially with Trois Pistoles, it packs a punch that reels back and hits you in the nose. To describe it as a bouquet doesn't do it justice. Spice and fruit and floral and citrus and sugars all wrapped up in one, and that's just the aroma. The taste doesn't disappoint either. Dark and rich with fruits and roasted malts, a slight burnt molasses undertone. 9% ABV but no burn at all. I'd say this is the closest to a North American St. Bernardus as one can get.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Belgian Dark Strong Ale,94
22,30,DoctorDog,4.3,"Presentation: 12 oz bottle poured into a wine glass.  A: A dark maple/coffee/cola appearance. Harsh pour produces 2 fingers of head, which dissipates to nothing in a flash.  S: A melange of fruits (from which I am unable to discern specifics), grains, and perhaps a hint of cocoa.  T: Others have explained the intricacies more precisely than I ever could, so I will offer my spin in more obtuse terms. Interestingly, the thought that leaps to mind is that this tastes like the aforementioned Coke Blak mixed with a port, though in an utterly palatable concoction. The high ABV is extraordinarily well concealed.  M: Fairly thin. Heavy carbonation is ever-present, though not in the least unpleasant.  D: Excellent. Would be easy to get carried away with this 9% brew, and pay the price before you realize it.  Future outlook: I can't wait to get my hands on another bottle of this.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Belgian Dark Strong Ale,94
22,30,kingothewoods,3.85,"a - This beer has a dark, almost black color but hints of red in the light. Carbonation is very prevalent with similarities to soda (thin head). There are lots of little bubbles that dissipate quickly.  s - Very strong fruity smells with some malt.  t - The fruits and maybe cloves are coming into play here.  m - Light and thin feel but tastes pretty good. You can feel the smoothness all the way to your stomach. Alcohol kick aftertaste.  d - I would have another but not too many - boy it's powerful on flavor, taste, and booze.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Belgian Dark Strong Ale,94

A: Pours a nice cola color, with a half finger head, and lots of carbonation  S: Smell is dominated with apple and cherry  T: Taste is tart with hints of a complex fruit basket of apple, peach, lemon lime. A wine and cranberry after taste is quite nice. Very well balanced and masking the high ABV.l  M: Biting carbonation lingers.  D: Great balanced - not sure if I'd want to turn this into a session beer as it is a bit too tart for my liking.  Notes: Will likely try a different service glass next time, likely oversized wine glass, as I have a few more from a four pack. In general a nice strong dark, but I prefer the Maudite from Unibroue.

A rush of fruit and chocolate storm the palate. Cherries, raisins, and apples with a spicy clove finish. A decent amount of warming as well.

22,30,ewright,4.29,"A: Somewhat disappointing lack of head given the vigorous pour into a snifter. The beer pours a dark brown that lets just a bit of light through.  S: The aroma more than makes up for the dull appearance! Hints of dark fruits, chamomile tea, dark brown sugar, dried spice (can't decide if that's nutmeg or not) and a slight alcohol burn. There's a lot going on in there, and it all blends sooo nicely.  T: Dark bread notes (think pumpernickel/rye blend), burnt toffee, faint hints of raisin all appear up front. Hop presence is muted, but enough to cut the sweet malts in the end. Alcohol is present, but blends nicely with the flavors.  M: Just a bit thin for such a malty brew. Good carbonation level leaves a prickling sensation on the tongue.  D: One of my favorite after-dinner sipping beers.

22,30,taylorhamrick,4.05,"I really liked this.  It pours brown, with a kind of thin head. It has this very deep, sweet smell, somewhere between roasted barley and sweet malts mixed with a hint of fruit. I really loved the taste. There is a bit of the typical sweetness of strong Belgian ales, but the darker malts help to subdue it so that it's not cloying. I found myself wanting to taste more and more, but I'm not so sure that I could drink more than one or two. I'll definitely try this again when I'm in the mood.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Belgian Dark Strong Ale,94

Smells of belgian yeast and spices, clove, ripened dark fruits, amaretto, slight alcohol fumes. Taste is huge sweet malts intertwined with the belgian yeast flare, spices ala clove, coriander, hints of caramel, those bright red dessert cherries whose name eludes me at the moment, and an alcohol bite/warming in the finish that is more noticeable on the first sip but blends in a bit more with each sip, leaving only the warming sensation in the chest. Plenty of carbonation of tiny bubbles that prick the tongue, medium bodied, wet. Very enjoyable but one is definitely enough for me.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Belgian Dark Strong Ale,94
22,30,PerzentRizen,4.28,"This is really a powerfully aromatic and fruity beer. I am fairly impressed. I heard some mediocre things about this one, but I have to say it is pretty good.  I poured this beer into a Kapittel Watou trappist glass. It pours a dark dark brown with a large puffy head and disappears into a light paper thin lacing that seems to boil back up to the top in three to four places in the glass. This is a great Belgian copy!  The aroma is fruity and amber malt. It smells like roasted grain and light fruit.  The taste is fruity and I am immediately brought back to the first time I tasted Chimay Trappist Ale (Red Label). It is light fruity and refreshing.  The mouthfeel is a little light and fizzy. I think this one is a bit overcarbonated. Perhaps I should have aged this one a year or two. It would have been good until 2011 - or so it says on the bottle.

I could sit around smelling this one for a while.  Taste: Wow! Where to begin? Cherries, no, chocolate covered cherries, bananas, vanilla, pumpkin/nutmeg, and a peppery kick to finish it. Almost reminds me of some merlots I've had lately. Really tasty.  Mouthfeel: Creamy and pretty highly carbonated. Seems like all Unibroue beers feel the same... and I like it. A lot of mouth numbing going on, probably due to the alcohol piggy-backing the carbonation. Carbonation stings at times.  Drinkability: Flavor is really pleasant, but I don't think I would last long drinking these pups. ABV is high and hits you quick. Other than that, a really solid beer.

Hint of apples and raisins, with a bit of a hoppy aftertaste.  M: Feel is decent, the pronounced fruit and carbonation make themselves known immediately. Still, I expected a bit more thickness from a beer that pours as dark as this one. Not thin, but felt it could be a little thicker.  D: I found this to be very drinkable. It's sweet, but not overly so. The fruit flavor to me sticks out the most, but it's not overdone like in some beers I've tried.

Soft aroma of figs and the so called 'horse blanket' mustiness. Bold flavors of dates, raisins and figs, rich malt in the middle, currants, hints of ginger and some alcohol esters. Very complex and layered . The high ALC% is well concealed by the sugars and the slap-you-around flavors. Light to medium carbonation and a rich mouthfeel.

Sweet caramel malts and an array of fruits such as plums and raisins. All flavors are very well balanced and squeezes in a scent of alcohol in the distance.  Mouthfeel is very smooth with decent bite because of the medium/high carbonation.  It is very possible that this brewery from Quebec is becoming my all time favorite.

Smell is about the same as other Unibroue belgians. Fruity, phenolic and malty with a slight note of hops.  Taste is good, not great. There are cidery notes present, and the high alcohol content is apparent. There is also a very present grain/malt flavor to this one. Hops are there, but not in the first row.

22,30,Goliath,3.62,"Pours a dark brown, black from a distance, with some red hues around the edges. A large one inch light tan foamy head forms and quickly dissipates leaving no lace behind.  Aroma is nice. Definitely some dark fruits, plums most noteably. A little bit of sugar and spice as well.  Taste is fine. Dark fruit, spice. Slightly bitter and metallic. Some alcohol warmth too.  Mouthfeel is thin to medium bodied with tons of carbonation.  Drinkability is moderate. Flavor is ok, but alcohol is high. I'm pretty indifferent on this one.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Belgian Dark Strong Ale,94
22,30,BWH3,4,"Appearance: Well done deep brown in color. Clarity is translucent not opaque. Pours an exceptionally well carbonated and heady beer. Champagne like fizz settles the beige head into a thin creamy ring that clings to the sides of the glass.  Smell: A mild scent of dark fruit/prune is most evident in this lightly sweat aroma. Some roast grain notes with a contribution of spice and esters as well as the solvent like quality of the high EtOH.  Taste: Approximates the aroma well. Neither the dark fruit nor roast grain flavors comes through in a bold way. In addition, a peppery spice hits the tongue and palate in the finish. Overall, nice dry clean finish without a lingering aftertaste. A mineral like hops bittern.  Mouthfeel: Exceptionally crisp, light medium body. Head retention is too poor for my liking. The carbonation does not seem as excessive as the other Unibroue beers.  Drinkability: The best of the Unibroue beers.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Belgian Dark Strong Ale,94
22,30,Reagan1984,4.1,"Was out to dinner last night for Boston Restaurant week and saw this on the menu at Pigale's on Charles Street. Figured we would give it a try.  The beer was served in a glass made specifically for the Unibroue Trois Pistoles glass.  The waiter poured the beer and did not provide as an aggressive pour as I would have desired. As a result, there was not that much of a head that formed atop the beer. What was there was a wispy off white thin foam that did fade rather quickly. The beer was a deep dark brown that looked pretty rich and intimidating (in a good way) There was no lacing to speak of as the beer was consumed.  Aroma was rather thick and rich and reminded me of dark fruits and immediately figs & dates came to mind. Additionally there was the typical spice note of a Belgian Ale that was the first indication of what was in store for you.  The taste was rather nice and followed suit with the aroma. Deep rich fruit flavors that included dates, figs, prunes and plums. A spice note that worked with these from front to back as well. I have to admit that these beers are growing on me. This reminded me of Ommegang Abbey Ale even though I believe they are different styles.  Mouth feel was almost full bodied and this was a rather rich beer. One that went very well with food. I had a chocolate & dark cherry dessert and wished I still had some of the beer left to go with it. I think it would have been a very nice match.  The beer really grew on me as I consumed it and I think this is a hint to the drinkability.  Not a session brew, but one to savor.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Belgian Dark Strong Ale,94
22,30,Romulus141,4.5,"Poured into a steep wine glass to approximate a chalice.  Appearance: Pours an intriguing deep, dark brown that blocks most any light that tries to pass through it. The brew produces a fluffy, manilla colored head that simply will not dissipate. Strong lacing is left behind on the sides. On the bottom of the glass, strong upward currents of carbonation rise to the surface. This beer makes a strong visual impression.  Smell: Fruit is the dominant characteristic, with notes of dark fruits being at the forefront. The smell is sweet and supple, yet strong and bold. The scent also has a flowery and yeasty character, which blends well with the fruit. A complex smell, which builds anticipation for the tasting to follow.  Taste: The initial flavor is a mellow blend of apple and raisins, which saturates my palette. This is mixed with a hopped bitterness, which balances out the sweetness of the fruit taste. The finish of the brew contains some alcoholic notes, which warm my chest. A pleasant aftertaste remains, reminding you of the experience. Unibroue once again has a winner here.  Mouthfeel: Medium bodied, with just the right amount of carbonation. This drink is silky smooth, and just glides around the mouth.  Drinkability: This is a great tasting brew which, despite its richness, goes down quite easily. I could sip on this for an entire evening. However, one must beware of the ABV, as it is high and could get you in trouble if you have too much.  Unibroue has not let me down yet, and consistently makes high quality Belgians. Highly recommended.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Belgian Dark Strong Ale,94
22,30,mrkc,4.43,"Dark Red, opaque. Pours slowly. Smells.... Cherries, almost like a glass of red wine. Pours into my chalice with a good head initially, which dissipates quickly. Tastes fruity, with a sweet taste that lingers. Very smooth and drinkable. I found myself drinking most of a 75cl bottle without realizing it. Given I'm not personally fond of red-wines, I found this beer slightly less than amazing, but for what it aspires to be, those who are looking for this sweet, edged flavour will not be disappointed. The Alcohol is deceptive, in that it doesn't seem to hit you for an hour before it rears its head all at once. It's worth noting that this bottle wasn't cellared at all, but bought and consumed on the same day. I strongly suspect this beer would benefit strongly from cellaring.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Belgian Dark Strong Ale,94
22,30,DIM,4.37,"a: This was a dark, murky brown. It pours with a medium sized, fizzy, light tan head that fades fairly quickly.  s: I smelled peaty, floral cherries with some raisin notes. Candied sugar, some alcoholic warmth, and just a hint of something spicy.  t: This was on the sweet side, but not at all cloying. Peaty cherry and raisin flavors with a little vanilla dominate. Just a touch of heat at the end as it warms.  m: As with most Unibroue brews, I thought the carbonation was too fizzy.  d: One of the best I've tried from these guys. Definitely on the list of beers to buy again.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Belgian Dark Strong Ale,94

22,30,kinger,4.38,"Wow, what can I say to best sum up the overall experience of this remarkable brew. Got it in a 750 ml bottle (which I will be keeping for my home brew). Poured into a wine glass a very dark reddish purple with a big foamy head that soon diminished. I allowed this one to warm up a little before sampling. The aroma consisted of sweet fruits perhaps grapes, cherries, and maybe even plums. Finally it was time to try a taste and the flavors burst inside of my mouth. This dark ale is very unique in that it drinks like a beer, but finishes almost like a red wine. Good carbonation and rather smooth to drink, I enjoyed sipping on this for a good while. The strong alcohol content is masked by all of the complex flavors in this beer. Wonderful experience, not an everyday selection but worth the price for a long cold night.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Belgian Dark Strong Ale,94

With a very thick head many small bubbles... smallest I've seen.  Smell - A tiny bit of chocolate, with a very strong sweet smell, much like raisins. No hint of the strong alcohol content... these guys are good.  Taste - Very complex. Tastes very breadlike with a hint of real cherries and a tiny bit spicy. Still can't tell the alcohol is there, besides a little warmth. This is good. A bit too sweet for most occasions, but it tastes good tonight. A tiny hint of yeast at the end. It's rich, somewhat raisiny and spicy... Tastes like a winter holiday. haha A meal in a bottle.  Mouthfeel - carbonation is tingly, strong but not a burning sensation. Ahhh theres the alcohol... just a warm tongue, thats it. Aftertaste is bad at first then becomes very pleasant, I think I want some cheese to accompany this one.  Drinkability - Really sweet at first then gets better, would go great with a huge meal or with like... turkey. Or for the alcohol content, a perfect nightcap drink. Great beer, but, of course, not for a beer session. (one bottle of this is equal to 3 and 1/2 BudLights, haha)",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Belgian Dark Strong Ale,94
22,30,glid02,4.3,"Got this one from Green's in Atlanta.  Pours a very dark brown with a good sized oatmeal colored head. The head thins out but remains, lacing is pretty good.  The smell is really good. It's tough to describe - the best I can come up with is some kind of fruit - not citrus, maybe figs or dates? - with malt undertones.  The taste is much like the smell, fruity with the sweetness of the malts. There's a lot of stuff going on, and it all plays well off each other.  The mouthfeel is good, there's a little bit of heaviness there and the carbonation is good, but maybe a bit too much of it. Somehow even with all of the carbonation it still seems a bit thin.  The drinkability is good, it goes down easily with little unwanted aftertaste.  Overall I would definitely recommend this beer, it has a very distinct flavor and for the price there's no reason not to give it a shot.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Belgian Dark Strong Ale,94
22,30,Trueant1,4.43,"Style Description: On the same path as the Belgian Dark Ale but obviously higher in alcohol with more of an all around character. The alcohol character can be deceivingly hidden or can be very bold and in your face. Look for lots of complexity within a delicate palate. Hop and malt character can vary, most are fruity and some many have mild dark malt flavors. Phenols will range from minimal to high and most will be light on the hops. All in all most are spicy and alcoholic.  Pours surprisinly dark. Looks like a natural root beer. Head is offwhite and thick. this beer is loaded with tons of suspended floaties! YUM.  Smell is unique. Extremly sweet malts that are not toasted too much. Raisons and other dried dark fruits are in here. Where is the 9% abv?? No hint at all. I can tell from the smell this is a special one in the taste department.  Ahhhh there is the alcohol! Boozeiness that is balanced out by the imense sweet malts. Ahhh what a balance! Taste is simply miraculous! Dark fruits and chewey bready malts come through all the alcohol. A dank, almost tart flavor comes through as well. Love it!  A bit too carbonated for me personally. Would like this one a little flat. This beer is bready and chewey to me. A full meal!  Drinks as a borderline sipper.  Love it!",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Belgian Dark Strong Ale,94

22,30,MusicaleMike,4.25,"The 12oz. bottle reads ""Best Before: 09-18-10"". I poured this complex beer into a tulip glass, hoping to make the most of the bouquet. I was listening to some Xiu Xiu at the time of consumption.  A: The thick cream colored head rises quickly on this one, only to crackle and pop away into a smaller, but more compact head. The body of this beer is very dark brown, with red highlights when held up to light. Streams of carbonation are visible on the edge of the glass.  S: Immediately I characterize this beer as having a deep fruity malt smell. Indeed, I can pick out notes of bananas, ripe melon, plums, and maybe a little bubblegum. Obviously, there is a sweet presence here. No hop aroma, which is accurate for the style. There is another aspect of this smell that is worth mentioning, and that is the crispness at first smell, which I have found in every other Unibroue beer. It is almost citrusy.  T: I must say that I found the taste to be a little weak for the style. I expected the flavors to be bolder. However, what was there was amazing and complex. The malts brought all the sweetness, with a mix of fruits and caramel, but that sweetness was countered by a mouth-puckering tartness. Not lambic tart, but something to give the tongue a shock. The alcohol, though 9%, was not too present, lending only its warmth. There is that signature Unibroue flavor that accompanies the Unibroue smell. The aftertaste is like delicious gingerbread, with some spices rearing their ugly (or beautiful) heads. Towards the end of the glass I started tasting some tart cherry flavors in the finish.  M: This beer has an amazing mouthfeel that really makes the beer. It is full-bodied and smooth, but the intense crisp carbonation makes this beer light in the mouth. If you let it sit on the tongue, it will foam up like crazy! It leaves the tongue prickly.  D: Definitely more of a night cap beer. It is not something I would want to drink all night long, but the alcohol is extremely well masked, and the flavors are delicious. This is one beer that is really worth trying.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Belgian Dark Strong Ale,94

22,30,wagenvolks,4.26,"Trois Pistoles will always hold a special place in my liver, as it was one of the beers instrumental to my introduction to the craft brewing world.  750 ml caged & corked bottle (2005) into a Unibroue tulip.  Bottle releases a dark brown, plum-colored body with tons of carbonation rising up from the bottom. A fizzy, effervescent head slowly recedes to a thick cap of khaki fluff. I remember this smelling alot better when I first stumbled upon it as a BMC drinker, but what wouldn't smell better at that juncture in my beer drinking life? Nevertheless, Trois packes dark cherries, currant, red grape rinds, and breaded malts atop an overriding mineral crispness.  The flavor starts out with a blast of sour, dark fruit, yeasty spice and sweetened booze before quickly mellowing to a bubbly, smooth vanilla note. Crisp mineral finish lingers effortlessly on the back of the palate with a fruity bitterness. The alcohol is a nice touch, complementing the flavors without heating the tongue. Mouthfeel starts out a bit overly carbonated, but give it time and Trois will mellow. Overall, a pleasing brew and one of the best that Unibroue makes. A classic that I will surely revisit.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Belgian Dark Strong Ale,94
22,30,cvstrickland,4.17,"12-ounce bottle poured into a chalice yields a deep ruddy brown body capped with a thin tan head that leaves the rarest flecks of lacing.

A refined bitterness and a mineral note plus caramel complement a juicy finish.

Ask people with me, couldn't smell definitely banana but found something else that they were not able to tell.  This, in my opinion, the less fruity beer from Unibroue. From the ones I've tasted. Almost all.  I like it, but would only drink one per night. Definitely not a beer that I would bring in a 6-pack format.  I have to try it again to be sure on my rating.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Belgian Dark Strong Ale,94
22,30,TheMistler,4.18,"The head of the Trois Pistoles seemed to oddly change, from just slightly off white to definitively tan. Maybe the yeast settling in? The brew itself was dark, dark brown. Nearly opaque. There was a reddish, maroon quality to it.  When cold, the Trois Pistoles had burnt caramel and brown sugar on the nose. When it warmed up a bit, I was surprised by some additional, seemingly buttery sniffs in the nose.  For taste and mouthfeel, the the beer was effervescent up front, with the nose and taste giving a hint of alcohol to come. Alcohol seems to hit upfront. It doesn't bite, which I appreciated, and instead seems to roll (allowing flavor to overtake it) throughout. There was a malty, fruity flavor, with e some - I detected - apple. Very full, well-rounded mouthfeel.  A pretty darn good brew. I'm (somewhat kidding here) a bit tired of Unibroue being so consistently good - will they ever be able to release a beer that truly, utterly stands out?",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Belgian Dark Strong Ale,94

T/M: Similar to nose, but stronger, very spicy and dark fruit (cherry, plums, etc) sweet with belgian yeast. Grainy, earthy background and alcohol finish. Very creamy, carbonated, chewy mouthfeel D: Very strong and a sipper but definitely my favorite Unibroue beer. In my experience tastes great freshed or aged for a year or two.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Belgian Dark Strong Ale,94
22,30,roadhouse,4.25,"Poured from 750 ml bottle into a snifter.  Pours a deep brown that appears a deep red when held up to the light with a light tan two finger head. Lively carbonation leaves a little bit of lacing down the side.  Aroma is spicy Belgian yeast, plum, and caramel. It's sweet kind of like bubble gum, yet the spiciness presides over it.  Flavors are basically the same as the aroma. Spicy yeasty flavors dominate with some tart plum and some bready malt. A little bit of sourness at the end along with a very light touch of hops.  Medium bodied. Carbonation level is good, it leaves a nice tingling finish on the tongue for the flavors to dance around on. Finishes nice and dry.  Overall, I thought it was quite good. It seems like it's hard to find anything bad from Unibroue. It's not top of the line, true Belgian, but it's also much cheaper.

Loads of yeast particulates present. The 1/4 inch tan head quickly dropped to nothing with very little lacing down the glass. Carbonation release was decent throughout.  S= The aromas off this ale were full of funky Belgian yeast, dark candy fruits, mollasses, and malty bread.  T= Much like the aroma, the tastes presented by this ale were of candied fruit, spice, sweet dark (unroasted) malts, and Belgian funk. Despite the ABV, there was little alcohol in the finish.

Not as complex as the Trappists but a very good example of the style.  M: fairly heavy, carbonation about average and not too fizzy, allowing the malt and fruit flavors to stand tall  D: while it didn't have the complexity of a Trappist, this was a very easy and good drinker, although at this abv one has to be careful.

Smooth hop and malt balance that is accentuated by an unsweetened fruit and caramel flavor along with a grainy, dry spiciness.  Every sip has a kick of lively carbonation in the front of the mouth that fills every inch from cheek to cheek. Very fizzy in the back of the throat. It is good. Not awesome but very good.

Looks like a ruby black, if that makes any sense. A pretty frothy head and a lot of bubbles along the side of the glass. Smells like dried fruit with hints of cocoa. Tastes like prunes, raisins, spices, not unlike port. A very effervescent mouthfeel. Not the most drinkable beer due to the higher ABV.

Lots of dark fruit, more like figs than dates as it lacks the unbridled sweetness. Spicy and herbal notes are also present. Should be interesting.  Lots of spicy fruit in the flavor, that's actually rather dry. Not much sweetness like I'm used to in style. The mouthfeel also lends the imagination to something that's a bit thinner and more watery than it really ought to be.  Hm. I remember this as being a little better.

The head dwindles down in my goblet to an extremely thin (read sparse) layering.  S: A sweet nose with lots of fruits and spice. Pear and coriander seem to be the most distinguishable. Earthy and grassy notes provide some balance.  T/M: The mouthfeel really jumps out of this one first. It's got a high carbonation that tingles the tongue, but it complements the creamy medium body by providing an additional texture. The palate again comes through with sugar and spice. Coriander and a bit of sweet cocoa goodness are first and foremost followed by a healthy dosing of alcohol. Extremely dry and warming.  D: My first exposure to this brewery. I'll be buying everything available from them. A great representation of the style, actually my favorite I've tried.

22,30,Folderol,3.02,"I haven't tasted many Belgian Strong Dark Ales, so I wasn't sure what to expect. I was so impressed with Maudite that I could only expect a darker version to be even better. That's usually the case with English ales, so why not Belgians? What a letdown. This beer looks so good, dark brown with a rocky tan head that filled my glass and never fully receded. But that's where the fun ends. This doesn't smell like something I want to drink. It's not inviting or malty, more a sort of twisted fruitiness that I can only describe as ""rotten flowers"". The taste follows the smell - it's sharp and dry in a way that defies description. I was hoping for some imperial stout-like dark fruit or chocolate or something, and all I get is... I don't know.

The feel is slightly dry in finish with some yeast notes and very proper carbonation.  Notes: Boy,oh Boy. This blew me away. So good to sip on even as it warmed. The balance was unbelievable.

T/M: Caramel malts with an almost molasses thickness completely covers the tongue. The lively carbonation and prickly, peppery, spicy, fruity yeast cut through to balance. Alcohol is sweet and warming with some drying effect in the finish. Body is on the lighter side.  D: Tasty and easy to drink. What more do ya need?",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Belgian Dark Strong Ale,94
22,30,gpogo,4.27,"A- Opaque dark brown, up to the light a slightly red brown tint. Off-white head which quickly goes thin, finally ending as a small ring with no lacing.  A- Raisins and cherries. A very dark fruity aroma.  T- Fruity sweetness similar to aroma with raisins and cherries. Finishes dry with a slight bit alcohol.  M- Medium bodied with high carbonation. Incredibly smooth  D- Definitely. Goes great with a meal. The alcohol is definitely there, but is rather hidden.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Belgian Dark Strong Ale,94
22,30,MrMonkey,4.2,"Pours an opaque dark brown with some lighter highlights when held to the light. A two-finger, creamy light-tan head fades slowly to a thin cap and then a ring. No lacing.  Smell is sweet dark fruits and Belgian yeast. Raisins, figs, plums and cherries all meld nicely with a faint toffee maltiness.  Taste is sweet and tart dark fruits up front; reminds me of carbonated cran-raspberry juice. There's some malty sweetness in the middle, with more dark fruits similar to the nose. Just a bit of mellow, earthy hops in the finish.  Medium-bodied, well carbonated mouthfeel.  A great beer that goes down smoothly.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Belgian Dark Strong Ale,94
22,30,soultrain19,4.4,"Poured a dark mahogany color with a quickly dissipating head. I was quickly hit with fruity esters which seemed to overwhelm a backdrop of maltiness. It has a sour aftertaste with no hop presence. Very crisp carbonation that settles nicely. For a dark ale it is not overpowered with malty sweetness but rather more subtle fruit essence. As the label says ""remarkably mellow"".",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Belgian Dark Strong Ale,94
22,30,santa109,4.67,"750ml bottle, corked and caged. Served at 55 degrees.  A: Pours an extremely dark brown with a medium sized head that doesn't stick around for very long. Settles in a thin film.  S: Plum, usual unibroue spices (tamer than their other brews), a bit of alcohol reminiscent of port. There are some other unidentifiable aromas. As it warms, plums fade away and only the spices and alcohol remain.  T: Wow, very refined sweetness, like plums. It's very complex, this bottle tastes smoother than usual, it's possibly aged already. There's some spices coming from Unibroue's typical yeast, but in a much tamer way than their ""Fin du monde"" and others. Flavors are meshed together, not separate. I love this. I've yet to come across another beer with a similar taste.  M: Interesting chewy mouthfeel that complements the taste very well.  D: Alcohol is present, yet in a tame way and it doesn't get in the way of the drinking experience. This is a beer that commands respect, a sipper.  Overall, this beer needs it's own category, I don't think I've tasted anything that comes close to it. In my opinion, Unibroue's best, not as in your face as the others, yet extremely complex. A dessert amongst beer!",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Belgian Dark Strong Ale,94
22,30,bloberglawp,3.36,"Pours a dark red-hued bronw, thick white head that sticks around nicely. Lacing is present and quite nice.  Aroma reminds me of a dubbel, a bit of wheat malt, a bit of yeast esters and phenols. Flavor is quite rich and malty, a bit of fruit and a smack of unibroue's signature yeast.  I remember being blow away by this ale, it seems to have been ""melowed"" down from what i remember... a good dubbel, but not a extraordinary one like it used to be.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Belgian Dark Strong Ale,94
22,30,BoitSansSoif,4.35,"Pours a dark reddish-brown with thick beige head. Retention is impressive, and there is an intricate lacing around my snifter. On the nose, dried, dark dried fruit and some cherries, faint spice, cocoa, and lightly sweetened dough. Taste is a rich, hearty blend of slightly sweet and toasted malt, raisin and faint dried papaya with uplifting spicy yeasts that carry the ale though a smooth finish. Nice, medium body and the carbonation picks at the tongue and soft palate just like a nice champagne, leaving the same dry mouthfeel at the end. The body is lighter than other varieties of this style, but it marries up perfectly with the spice and flavor. This is a delicious, well-balanced beverage. There is also a veil of mineral presence that lingers in the aftertaste along with some faint hops that cleanse the palate just enough to make you want to take another draw. The light sweetness lingers on.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Belgian Dark Strong Ale,94
22,30,Douglas14,4.65,"Pours what could be black, but black doesn't quite describe this color. Black is for stouts...this is more of an extremely dark wood? It has an incredible, thick, fluffy, beige head that seems to be sticking around for a while. No webbing on this one; a solid layer of head sticks to the walls of the chalice. An immense cotton candy-like essence radiates outwards and is followed by malty, fruity, and spicy undertones. Surprisingly floral as well. The taste is complex beyond belief. It starts out sugary (candied sugar) and spicy (cloves for sure) followed by some oak, vanilla, and earthy tones, and finishes with rich bread and malt characteristics. This brew has is full bodied and very rich. Trois Pistole is something else.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Belgian Dark Strong Ale,94
22,30,Strix,4.05,"Murky brown with orange edges and a good head.  Like the label says, smells like ripe fruit, with a bit of alcohol. A bit grassy as well.  Taste is fruity. Spicy dark fruit. Peach, plum, and grape and a finish of alcohol. Long aftertaste. Complex but very mellow.  Nice mouthfeel. Smooth and somewhat dense.  Not blown away, but this was pleasant and well done.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Belgian Dark Strong Ale,94
22,30,KeefD,3.67,"Poured from a 12oz bottle into a chilled imperial pint glass. Ran a hazy, dark brown to deep burnt orange color with a hefty 2 finger head and light lacing. Plenty of carbonation bubbles making their way up from the bottom. Head disappears quickly and leaves very little lacing.  Has a slight port wine smell. Alcohol is present with strong aromas of roasted malts, plum and slight hops.  Taste is sweet upfront. Hints of chocolate and dark fruit. A bit of licorice and medicinal taste lingers in the back.  Good mouthfeel, plenty of carbonation, as it goes with bottle conditioning. Full-bodied, lovely dark ale.  Good dark beer. I've had better, but I like this one. Maybe a bit too sweet for me, but the sugary taste drops as it's being consumed. Tastes a bit too much like wine for my preference, however. Another good Unibroue brew!",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Belgian Dark Strong Ale,94
22,30,mattster,3.92,"Opened 750ml bottle, poured into snifter glass.  Pours a nice thick head of 2"". Some lacing across top and sides of glass. Brew is a dark opaque brown brew.  Smells of malts and dark fruits, a hint of currants. Bubbles are strong, but as beer drinks, they become more sublte. Alcohol is well balance and brew finishes quite nicely.  Nice brew.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Belgian Dark Strong Ale,94
22,30,cswhitehorse,4.23,The Trois Pistoles pours a dark brown cloudy hue with a solid 1-2 finger foam head with some lovely sea wave lacing.  The aroma smells medicine like with a slight alcohol tinge.  The taste is unique and reminds me of a custom made root beer. The alcohol character is well hidden in the taste. It is sweet bready malt. In the mouth is mealy with a slight bitterness that goes away quickly. Overall a solid brew which I will definitely drink on a yearly basis.,Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Belgian Dark Strong Ale,94
22,30,SurlyDuff,4.27,"750ml bottle, caged and corked  Dark brown...dark umbar to be precise. Really nice silky head.  Unique aroma. Well, unique to unibroue I should say. They've got some sort of prorpetary yeast or something. It's really nice.  Grassy soggy stale hay aroma. I've heard it called horse blanket before... Not bad, it really isn't just different,  Chewy sweetness and the spicy alcohol is right up front. I've had 12%'s that have less alcohol presence in the taste. At 9%, this one is surprsingly spicy.  Grainy earthy flavors in there too. Really a treat.  I really like the mouthfeel and the aftertaste on this one. A real nice sipper. One of my favorite Unibroues.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Belgian Dark Strong Ale,94
22,30,ScottUCF84,4.13,"Bottle into a goblet. Wow, this one is different, and complex.  A- Very, very dark with hues of cola. A decent tan head that left scattered suds clinging to the glass.  S- Roasted malt, prunes, figs, and other dried fruit; a bit of chocolate, and some banana.  T- Very much matched the smell; lots of dried fruit dominate the flavor, along with alcohol, toffee, and roasted malt. The finish is what is the most interesting, which was reminiscent of a merlot or other type of red wine. Do I want my beer to taste like wine? Normally no... but this beer is an exception.  M- Medium to heavy body, with a generous amount of carbonation. Finishes very dry.  D- I could not drink this all the time, but when you are craving something that stands out in complexity, this one takes the cake.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Belgian Dark Strong Ale,94
22,30,GbVDave,4.5,"Poured from a 12oz bottle into a St. Feuillien chalice. Thanks to HeatherAnn for the assist!  Best before 10/11/10  A: Pours a deep, dark, cola-brown with a light tan head that leaves some draping sheets of lace in its' wake.  S: Aromas of roasted malt, fruity yeast, cocoa, cherry, cola nut, faintly grassy hops, chocolate, caramel, and tangy berry. Wonderful!  T: Spicy and fruity yeast, dark chocolate, roasted malt, cocoa dusted cherry, dark fruit, fudge brownies, grassy hops, tart cirtus, tangy berry, toffee, and a slightly metalllic flavor at the finish.  M: Slick and coating. Big sweet mouthfeel countered nicely by the peppery, cut-grass hops and spicy yeast flavors. Sweet, dry, and bitter chocolate-in that order.  D: Alcohol presence is virtually non-existant. Have two in a row of these and you'll certainly ""feel"" the alcohol, but never taste it. Awesome!",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Belgian Dark Strong Ale,94
22,30,WaveRebel51,4.42,"Pours out very dark, with a purplish hue under the light, almost like a very dark red wine. The aroma combination of malts and fruits is very pleasant and unique. The complexity of the flavors is something else -- the mix of malts and fruity esters is complemented by a nice bitter finish. The mix of sweetness, sourness and bitterness masks the alcohol pretty well and makes this very drinkable. A terrific and tasty beer.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Belgian Dark Strong Ale,94
22,30,LumpyGuitar,4.25,"This beer was amazing!  Poured a dark brown, head was cottony and extensive, smelled sweet and fruity.  Taste was sweet, again fruity, oaky, very complex, with a strong alcohol finish.  Mouthfeel was heavy, a bit thick, alot of carbonation, but very balanced.  Drinkability is good. I now pick up one or two of these everytime I go beer shoppin'. Not my favorite beer but my favorite from Unibroue.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Belgian Dark Strong Ale,94
22,30,biggmike,4.2,"Poured a dark brown color with fluffy white head that stayed for a while. Aroma was of sweet dark fruit. Flavor was dark fruit and sweet maltiness with a touch of spice. A bit of chocolate taste at the finish. Mouthfeel was pleasant, and this beer hid the 9% abv very well. Great beer.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Belgian Dark Strong Ale,94
22,30,hero27,4.13,"12 oz bottle 9% abv  Pours a dark chestnut brown, persistent off-white head forms on top. Vinous aroma of figs, raisin, and various dark fruits.. Flavor is sweet & spicy..plums, prunes, cherries, and raisin flavors sit on a blanket of wet barley. There's an alcoholic residue with every sip that leaves a slight burning behind, and a citrus zing accompanies it. Not a beer to be trifled with...this is a very good strong ale that will leave you pleading for more.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Belgian Dark Strong Ale,94
22,30,ryrust5301,4.8,"Poured into a Unibroue tulip glass from a 12oz brown bottle. 2007 vintage with a black winged horse set against an ominous sky on the label.  Appearance - Pours a dark dark brown with a 1 1/2 finger white bubbly head.  Smell - Smooth and sweet. Dark candied fruit smell, a little bit of cherry. Each swirl brings a treat to the nose.  Taste & Mouthfeel - Dry with a delicious spiciness at first taste. Dark fruits, and a sweet malt backbone explode after the first sip. Alcohol is well hidden, especially for 9.00% abv. Crisp mouthfell at first, but flows wonderfully into that smooth caramel malty finish. Touch of sweet chocolate in the back.  Drinkability - Great to taste this beer year after year. Keep it in my fridge at all times. It's a juggernaut of a brew! One of my favorite all time Belgians, and the best Unibroue has to offer. This beer was one of the treats that opened the window to the Belgian world for me. It truly belongs among the all time greats!",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Belgian Dark Strong Ale,94
22,30,GeoffW,4.31,"Poured from a 750ml bottle. Very, very dark color, almost black. Nice 1in head with good retention, also some nice lacing.  Smell is sweet and fruity but not too pungent. There's something here that I can't put my finger on, but I like it. ""Wild"" would be a good way to put it.  Taste is very sweet. Nice and complex, almost floral-like. Again, I don't really know how to put it with this one. Mouthfeel is surprisingly balanced for such a sweet beer, but this stuff has just the right amount of hop to even things out- or at least put a curb on the sweetness.  Drinkability is good, this beer has something special to it that I really like, but I wouldn't want to drink it like I would some others.  Overall a damn good beer, one that I will be buying in the future.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Belgian Dark Strong Ale,94
22,30,champ103,4.13,"A: A dark and cloudy ruby color. A large foamy head forms that eventually recedes to a rim. Lots of lace. This looks great. S: Pretty much all malt. Tons of dark fruit, plumbs, raisins, dates, ect. Complex and hard for me to describe. T: Follows the nose closely. Lots of malt and dark fruit and some peppery spices. M/D: This feels good in the mouth. Rich, creamy, and well carbonated. A nice change because I find some of the other Unibroue a bit watery. Not this beer. This is a sipping beer because of the high ABV, but the alcohol is well hidden. Very smooth and easy to drink.  An excellent beer, and my 100th review (yay). A malty, tasty treat that I would recommend.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Belgian Dark Strong Ale,94
22,30,charlzm,4.1,"From bottle marked 11-08-09. Consumed on 9/1/07.  Pours a dark, slightly cloudy raisin color. A big head quickly dissipates, leaving only a thin skin of off-white foam on the surface. Above-average, lively lacing keeps minimal head constantly replenished. Nose is fruity and sweet, full of malt character. Slightly thicker-than-water mouthfeel marked by a noticeable astringency (almost a pleasant burning). Goes down smoothly. Flavors of raisin/figs/dates and malt (as in the nose) mingle on the palate with a bit of vinous acidity. Sweet, but not overwhelmingly so with hints of spice (cinnamon?). Clean finish with fruity aftertaste is both agreeable and short-lived.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Belgian Dark Strong Ale,94
22,30,callmemickey,3.77,"A: Deep ruby brown with a thick tan head... healthy carbonation... good lacing...  S: Sweet candy like banana aroma with some pepper and alcohol...  T: The taste disappoints the expectations the aroma gave me... mostly sweet malts with black pepper... the banana candy isn't as prevalent as you'd like  M: Medium-full bodied.. you know you are drinking beer when this is in your mouth...  D: Good for a Belgian strong... not the top of the pack, but respectable effort from those Canadians",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Belgian Dark Strong Ale,94
22,30,bearrunner44,3.95,"Appearance: Deep, dark brown in color. Mostly opaque. Somewhat bourbon-colored in the few spots where light penetrates it. Big, foamy head, medium-tan in color.  Aroma: Smooth, mellow malt aroma. Vaguely fruity, bringing to mind bananas and orange peel. The alcohol is evident, helping lend a spicy overtone.  Taste: Toasty malt backbone; a little sweet, but not candy-like. It leaves a fruity aftertaste on the tongue, sort of citrus-like. The malt tastes a little dryer towards the finish. The combination of lively carbonation and a strong flourish of alcohol flavor lends a lively, spicy kick to the finish. The mouthfeel is somewhat unusual for the style, mostly due to the carbonation; it's almost fizzy.  Verdict: Though it's not my favorite Belgian-style ale, I admire this beer's individuality. It doesn't taste a whole lot like many of the other Belgians I've tried. Definitely worth a try for fans of good, strong ales.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Belgian Dark Strong Ale,94
22,30,clayrock81,4.22,"Poured this into my chalice and receive minimal head that stuck around and had lacings clinging to the glass. With a dense, dark brown body this beer has a very good smell. Dark currants and citric flavors like cherry give it a sour, hoppy smell although the yeat presence is strong. The first thing that hit my tongue is the malts, which seemed sweet and maybe a hint of rosting. There are traces fruits in the beer but more importantly there is caramel (it could be chocolate) in there that gives it a very smooth, almost slick driving force down your throat. There are some spices/pepper in there, natch, that give a slightly dry feel but they are not overpowering, and neither is the high ABV. If it weren't for that ABV I would session this in a second.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Belgian Dark Strong Ale,94
22,30,TCadillac,4.83,"What can I say? Poured this baby in an oversized wine glass with a 3 layer ripple bottom.  The pour leads to an immaculate browish/amber hue color with a slight minimal 1/8 inch head. I gave my Trois a furocious spin around the glass to reveale an aroma of raisin bread, cloves, nutmeg, unidenitiful herbs and spices, and a slight hint of banana bread. Taste....my god...Dark chocolate, rasberry, caramel, candied apples, chocolate covered cherries. Mouthful is somewhat cabornated, full bodied, smooth, gracious, velvety. Hell of a damn beer. Treat yourself to what is Trois Pistoles!",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Belgian Dark Strong Ale,94
22,30,triplecoil,4.67,"Served in a Unibroue glass at Publick House.  Poured a deep reddish-brownish-black with a moderate tan head that leaves a great lace. Smell is fruity and spicy, with chocolate and port, and just a tinge of belgian yeast/farmhouse to it. Taste is malty and herbal with dried fruit, chocolate, and pepper and leaves you with some tart/sourness (not too much). Mouthfeel is somewhat viscous with moderately reserved carbonation...does nothing more than lend itself to the flavor of the beer.  After having this a number of times from the bottle, this is my first time on tap (and my first review of it). I have never been disappointed by this brew, and I can probably say this is my favorite of the consistently excellent Unibroue selection. Fantastically complex beer that is easy to drink, despite it's high ABV. I whole-heartedly endorse this one.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Belgian Dark Strong Ale,94

Colour is deep dark burgundy red... Light mocha head poured pretty tight and thick but faded almost immediately to wispy covering with thick edging... very light lacing...  Aroma - Amazing deep rich alcohol soaked stewed fruits (dates, prunes, raisins, blackcurrent, light banana, orange), toasted bready malts, lots of dark treacle sweetness, spicy yeast, butterscotch, roasted nuttiness, alcohol is fairly noticeable with some red wine and port hints, rich fruit loaf / Christmas cake notes, light anise, decent amount of spicing - cinnamon, ginger, nutmeg all coming through...  Taste - Pretty much as above - an amazing mix of deep dark rich fruits, bready malts, spices and alcohol notes... outstanding..

22,30,BlackHaddock,3.62,"My first proper Canadian beer, even if it is a Belgian style offering.  The same brown 33cl bottle most people have reviewed (I think). Mine was bought in Brussels at a Canadian stall in the annual Christmas Market (2007).  Poured into a Corsendonk tulip shaped glass.  Very dark ruby red (deep purple in a different light) with a huge light biege head which falls away to a good covering.  Raisins and plums come to mind when you smell this, Christmas pudding with yeast and extra alcohol really.  Rich and strong, this is a sipping beer. The alcohol is there for all to find, but there is more to this brew than just alcohol.  Having had a few strong dark beers from Belgium, I can safely say this fits in well, not a leader, but OK. The flavours and smells stay within the feel. A sweetness comes into the mix as the beer warms up, which I don't like much, but all in all a fine beer.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Belgian Dark Strong Ale,94
22,30,mmmbeer,4.3,"12 oz. bottle, best by 12/13/09. The beer is a highly-carbonated, opaque, reddish-plum, topped with three fingers of khaki head that leaves decent lacing. Smells sweet and malty, with dark fruits, pear, apple and orange. On the palate, it's almost candy sweet, with caramel malts and a big nuttiness. Some yeast and banana in the mix, and fruity esters taste of green apple and melon, while the hops are spicy and peppery. The medium body is tingly at the beginning, but becomes smooth by the end, lingering nicely on the palate. A delicious, very easy to drink Belgian - I can't wait to see how it ages.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Belgian Dark Strong Ale,94
22,30,FtownThrowDown,3.97,"Served from a Growler Fill. Pours a dark brown with ruby highlights. Smell is wine like with lots of dark fruits. Plums, grapes, it's all in there.

There are definite port like qualitites with it.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Belgian Dark Strong Ale,94
22,30,GRPunk,3.85,"Bottle (dated best by 4-4-10) poured into a tulip glass.  A- There was a 2 finger light tan head on top of a chestnut brown liquid. Medium carbonation was apparent through the dark beer.  S- The aroma was quite sweet initially. At first it could have fooled me into thinking it was a hefe. I picked up some of the candied or over-ripe banana tones. There were a lot of spice tones that became more apparent as the beer warmed and a dash of alcohol aroma.  T- Again there was a lot of sweetness that melded with sour and spice flavors to create a complex flavor. The sweeter malts reminded me of some sort of whiskey mash. There were a myriad of spices, the strongest of which was pepper. The black pepper flavor was a little overwhelming for me.  M- It had a solid grainy feel that I expected of the style.  D- It's a slow sipper. Robust flavor and ABV quelch any hopes of chugging this beer. It's pretty solid. Although I didn't agree with some of the spicing, the complex flavor gave it a bit of a ""wow"" factor.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Belgian Dark Strong Ale,94
22,30,dsigmon,4.05,A: Ruby/brown in color with large head. Poured into my Unibroue tulip.  S: Strong citrus and fruit aroma with a little bready yeasty undertone.  T: Tastes of dark fruits and a little bitter citrus to pull it together. Somewhat spicy and bready in the finish.  M: Wonderfully carbonated with dry finish leaving a little oil on the palate.  D: Great brew to sip on for an afternoon.,Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Belgian Dark Strong Ale,94
22,30,steelcutoats,3.75,"Part two of the UNIBROUE review for tonight. Now is a time for a dark Belgian style brew. Trois Pistoles poured into my tasting snifter and deep darkness, with a small head that quickly vanished. I didn't notice much of a difference between this and the Maudite, except for two main instances. While the smell was similar, it wasn't as pronounced and second, the finish was a lot different. There isn't that ""champagne-like"" finish that you get, which I'm guessing has to do with the yeast used to ferment. It is still a very enjoyable beer, worthy of your time.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Belgian Dark Strong Ale,94
22,30,IBUnit63,4.15,"Pours like natural root beer - very well-carbonated. Head is thin and fades quickly.  Smell is powerful - caught whiff from eye level even when pouring. Carbonation makes the aroma travel well - good, sarasparilla (sic?) and coriander tones w/Belgian yeast; malt or hop tones are extremely subtle.  Nice molasses backbone with deep caramelized profile and additional yeast and underlying spice tones.  Heavy carbonation at outset makes this much lighter than expected, but still has that nice coating feeling.  Could drink more of this than expected; alcohol is there but hidden well.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Belgian Dark Strong Ale,94
22,30,Proteus93,4.38,"A: A magnificent pour with a huge, rocky & rolling light brown head. Big, soap bubbles in there. Dark ruby-brown with a deep murkiness going on.  S: Something of a tangerine citrus + spices blended into a mild sugary or caramel aroma.  T: Sweet... a somewhat fruity + sugary taste. A bit of a peppery alcohol adds additional flavour, and some raisin dark fruit flavours come through as it warms. Very nice.  M + D: Warm, rich, almost silky. Could be a LITTLE fuller on my palate, but that's certainly not to say it's light... and it's definitely delicious. Unibroue has managed an incredible brew each time I have tried them, and this is no exception... it makes it a little tough to pick a favourite.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Belgian Dark Strong Ale,94

Taste is actually pretty tame compared to the aroma,typical belgian yeast and ""spice, yet it is somehow subdued by a stronger malt base, again I get warm alcohol., sweet at the end.

I'd like to see an x-ray of myself after drinking this one.  The smell was excellent. Far from what I expected. Aromas were sweet, mostly red fruits like cherries and maybe some raspberries.  The taste was a bit too sweet for me. It was nice, but had a sugary taste to it. Cherries and caramel dominated. They tasted good, but it was a little over the top in my opinion.  Felt excellent. Crisp and dry, making the sweetness and high ABV very tolerable. Had a creamy feel too, maybe from the carbonation. Interesting and worked well.  Overall, the sweetness hurts drinkability. I'm glad I tried it, and I'm sure for some people this is a world class beer. But it didn't quite hit the spot for me.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Belgian Dark Strong Ale,94
22,30,srandycarter,4.13,"Into the tulip  A - Near black- dark brown with reddish hues. Off white, thick head, slow to disappear. Lacing is small bubbles and very persistent in coating.  S - The heavy perfume of dark fruit, some flower and spice. Hard to get past the fruits.  T - My God, heavy heavy pour of cooked for pastry dark fruit. Hard to remember it is barley, for sure. Nice neutral finish.  M - Medium, coating and good carb for the style.  D - Not your everyday suds.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Belgian Dark Strong Ale,94
22,30,Biscuit033,4.63,"A: Very dark mahogany, with light tan two finger head and nice lacing.  S: Dried dark fruit, molasses, dark sugars, and soicy yeast.  T: Raisin bread, dates and figs, coriander, pepper, and sweet dark sugars.  M: Champagne feel with a crisp and dry finish.  D: This is a great beer for drinking. It is very easy to drink considering the ABV. It is not too sweet or overpowering it is just a perfect balance of flavors.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Belgian Dark Strong Ale,94
22,30,avalon07,4.42,"I poured this one from a bottle to a goblet. Gave about a half inch of head that didn't last an overly long time. Had a brownish, cloudy appearance. Very rich looking.  The smell - to me at least - was dominated by fruit. It had a complex odor with a few smells jockeying for position.  As with most Unibroue's beers, the taste on the Trois Pistoles was excellent. It had a fruity texture, with apples and some pears apparent. There was also a smokiness to it that gave a bit of a bite.  Had a decent mouthfeel, highly carbonated but not ridiculously so.  This is an incredibly drinkable beer, one that goes down pretty easy and will warm you up.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Belgian Dark Strong Ale,94
22,30,ablaze,4.32,"Dark cola brown, good clarity with a nice tan head that settles swiftly in my beer chalice. Lacing is average.  Floral nose, dark fruits and spicy incense...lots of esters.  Initially a bit spicy and musty. Pretty complex with a nice outline of hops on a big woody malt base. Hint of lavender from the hops with nice serving of overripe dark fruits, faint smokiness. Yeast is prominent, big banana overtones but not too offensive, a bit tart in the finish.  Creamy, medium body with tight carbonation, clean dry finish, slightly astringent and cloying.  I love this beer and it's so tasty. Perfect after dinner sipper, especially on a freezing evening like this. Well made Belgian ale with an elegant nature.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Belgian Dark Strong Ale,94
22,30,rye726,4.18,"Nice dark cherry color with a tan head. Good lacing and retention.  Belgian yeast, dark ripe fruit and candy.  Sweet fruity malts and earthy belgian yeast. Peppery alcohols and more Belgian spices.  Full and thick with good carbonation.  Nice and sweet example of the style. Good stuff.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Belgian Dark Strong Ale,94
22,30,msubulldog25,4.08,"This poured to a pair of 'La Chouffe' tulips from a 750ml caged/corked bottle (dated best before: 02-28-10). My wife and I paired this with a terrific roasted pork loin, potatoes, brussels sprouts, & apples. Yum.  A: A tulip really showcases the billowing, fizzy ivory head atop this one. 3-fingers at least, even with a careful pour. Head drops to a denser foam, lace sticks randomly. Appearance is very dark brown, but shows a lovely ruby when held to light with plenty of rising carbonation.  S: Musty yeast, earthy and dry. Dark spiced fruit, figs or dates with a soda-like acidic tangy.  T: Juicy and fruit-filled, very dark and toasty. Evolves from sugary caramel to ripe, crisp fruit to a sultry bourbon woodsiness. Full-flavored, vinous with a touch of tartness.  M: A concentrated carbonation bristles across the tongue, with a tantalizing alcohol warmth in the finish. Softens, becoming more velvety as it warms. Body is medium, building towards heaviness as that malt and alcohol seems to thicken on the tongue.  D: Near the top of my BSDA list of favorites. A sipper for sure, and a solid performer...",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Belgian Dark Strong Ale,94
22,30,morimech,4.17,"Poured from a 750ml bottle with a best before date of 12/21/2009. It has a dark reddish brown tint with a large off-white head that grows slightly after the pour. Very little lacing.  The smell is very similar to a red wine. Red grapes, cherries, and other dark fruit. Some spices like cloves are noted. A slight hint of alcohol is detected.  Dark fruit flavors dominate the taste. It is very wine like. Some spiciness from the yeast adds to the flavor. A slight warming from the alcohol is also in place. Finishes semi-dry with a lingering fruity aftertaste. I would say it has a medium body, it holds the flavors really well. Carbonation is lively.  This is an interesting and quit tasty brew. It is a sipper and I may have trouble finishing the bottle. A glass would be enough.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Belgian Dark Strong Ale,94
22,30,Patrick999,4.47,"Pours from the little bottle a ruddy dark brown into my chalice. Head retention good, not much in the way of lace.  Smell is great, slightly boozy candied cherries, among other fruity aromas. That Unibroue yeast sure seems to want to throw out all kinds of esters at you - characteristically strong Unibroue nose.  T - A no-brainer. Nearly a perfect Belgian Strong Dark, well-integrated, nothing in particular jumps out at me other than that slightly sweet cherry flavor. I note that others have claimed a roasty taste; I'm a little disappointed to find that I don't really get that, but it's still a very tight beer. Dries out nicely to a couple fruity burps, not much of an aftertaste at all. Alcohol very concealed, moreso than the Chimay Blue, which (to me) likes to show off the alcohol a little  Feel is that nice airy, gentle typical Belgian feel, causing you to completely forget you're drinking a strong beer. Geez, this barely tastes like an alcoholic beverage to me.  Drinkability is very good - most of the heavy hitters in this style are quite drinkable for their strength, and this is no exception. This passed the test with flying colors; I'll pick up the 750 next.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Belgian Dark Strong Ale,94
22,30,Halcyondays,4.2,"12 oz. bottle,  A: Pours a dark brown with ruby highlights, with a thick off-white head, which recedes quickly into a thick rim, with very small bubbles.  S: Distinct smell of raisins, figs and Unibroue yeast character.  T: Taste is unique for a BSDA, it is very yeasty, but there is a certain quality in the taste that is markedly different from a brew made in Belgium. Quite malty on the first sip melding later into a heavy character of Mission fig, ending with some drying alcohol and carbonic acid.  M: Velvety mouthfeel, very soft and calming on the palate, light bite from the carbonation.  D: This is a very good beer, possibly my favourite from Unibroue, definitely one of the tops in the style, highly recommended.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Belgian Dark Strong Ale,94
22,30,Tballz420,4.28,"This thing is either a dark purple or completely black, some brown hues when held to the light. Very large tan head on the top leaves a fair amount of lace behind. Fruity scents, plum, spices, other dark fruits. Large malt presence on the taste, hints of chocolate. Spice with different fruit tones. Warming alcohol pops its head in as the beer warms. A nice treat indeed.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Belgian Dark Strong Ale,94
22,30,jmalex,4.69,"I think this might be my favorite beer. Maybe. I dunno, but this is one of the first beers that completely blew me away. My tasted have matured a lot since then, so we'll see.  APPEARANCE: Pours a very dark brown with some vague crimson highlights into my Trois Pistoles chalice. The off-white head starts out decent, but shrinks to a medium collar and large patch of bubbles floating on the surface.  SMELL: The smell is amazing and balanced between all the right aromas. The signature bready Unibroue yeast stands out as it does in all their beers. Dark fruits come out in cherry, plum, and raisin aromas. A slight alcohol accentuation comes with an all-spice-type spiciness.  TASTE: The flavor sneaks in, but comes through big time. The yeast works perfectly with the huge fruity flavors this beer brings. The finish starts out a bit sweet, but then drops out as stealthily as it came in. What you're left with is just a fleeting hint of what you just drank, demanding another sip.  MOUTHFEEL: Medium-bodied but it seems much lighter. The carbonation is just off the level of high and effervescent but still within acceptable levels.  DRINKABILITY: Off the charts. No alcohol is detectable whatsoever. This beer CANNOT possibly be 9%. I'm only drinking the 355mL bottle today, but I think all of my future Trois Pistoles purchases will be 750mL.  Yeah, what a fantastic beer. Is it my favorite? That's a tough call - one too tough to make. But let's just say that I'll be stocking up for as long as this beer exists.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Belgian Dark Strong Ale,94
22,30,DoubleJ,4,"Trois Pistoles is the finale here in the Unibroue ""Les Autres"" Invitational. This is one of the best reviewed beers to be involved in all my invites so far, but it has a huge peak to scale and get over if it wants to win. According to every sports movie ever made, this is going to take the crown. But not so fast, I want to see for myself, so on to the beer:  It pours a ruby brown into my chalice, providing a deep brown color with dark red hues on the edges and a good head. There's a sweet aroma of dark ripe fruits. Simple enough. Now I'm going ot put it on my tongue. Tasty. The yeast plays a mild role in the flavor which is dominated by dark fruits, ripe banana, and a shake of pepper for balance from the alcohol. Slight feel of wax. This is a fine beer, no doubt about that, but I'm not sure this will be enough to get over the peak in this invite.  The Unibroue ""Les Autres"" Invitational is offically over, so now it is time to announce the winner. And the winner is:  Don de Dieu!  What an invte this was, five of Unibroue's other beers, one which came out victorious here. I feel priviledged to try them all (yes, even Éphémère, which I disliked), and now I have more confidence for which ones I'll be going back for more of. You can check the previous results of the invite to see what you missed. Good night everyone!",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Belgian Dark Strong Ale,94
22,30,Hojaminbag,4.61,"Dark Brown/Red Color with about 2 fingers of head. Head laces glass as you drink.  Smells of a caramel/slight cherry malty aroma.  Taste, this beer is fantastic. As far as a Belgian Strong Dark goes, this beer is kind, even though it is from Canada. Strong Malty taste with a caramel/cherry hint. Aftertaste of alcohol warms.  Good thickness and easy to consume.  I Love this beer.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Belgian Dark Strong Ale,94
22,30,Gehrig,4.83,"Magnificent is the best way I can describe Trois Pistoles, a very smooth, very delicious BSDA. The presentation is first-rate, three fingers of slightly tan foam resting atop a dark mahogany body with faint reddish highlights, beautiful. Terrific nose, with lots of sweet fruit rising fast, with moderate spiciness following close behind.  The taste is an explosion of flavors--roasted malt, brown sugar, plum, pear, orange, a little caramel--just wonderful, a different flavor in every taste. The spicy finish is a great reminder of what the nose portends, with a good dash of pepper helping to finish a first-rate beer. Great mouthfeel, medium carbonation, smooth texture, and eminently drinkable, easily hiding the high ABV (9%).  Tremendous work from Unibroue, the first I've had from this Quebec brewery and certainly not the last of either Unibroue or Trois Pistoles. I'll be sure to grab a few more of these in the near future for another cold, snowy day. Don't pass this by.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Belgian Dark Strong Ale,94
22,30,dsa7783,4.4,"This is my third sample from Unibroue, and after already trying a couple, I must say that every beer I've had from this brewery has been world-class... Their Trois Pistoles failed to disappoint... top-notch flavor and quality that reeks from this brew... great dark-grape appearance with decent foamy, frothy head leads to a fig and prune aroma... great dark taste, full of caramel, malts, and slight cocoa flavor with underlying sweetness that truly satisfies... despite a hefty 9% ABV, you would never detect any strong alcohol behind a sweet, satisfying combination of ultra-rich, thick flavors that dominate the palate... definintely a top-contender brew, one of the best in my opinion, with a characteristic flavor that is truly unique... Definitely a must-try, a very unique representation of the style that really hits home... Definitely recommended...",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Belgian Dark Strong Ale,94
22,30,CrescentLake,4.52,"Absolutely one of my favorites... the milestone for all belgian beer, even though it's French-Canadian. The contrast of dark Belgian trippel-esk notes and almost bavarian wheat estery-hints add for a complex experience that is best paired with sweet duck or and rich non-chocolate desert... I'm salivating Oh, and by the way... it's 9 % Alchohol... The folks over at UNIBROUE are alcohol magicians. Definitely try the Trois Pistoles siblings who don't quite offer the fruit complexity, but can hide up to 12% ABV like it was a dirty magazine.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Belgian Dark Strong Ale,94
22,30,czechsaaz,4.32,"Big fruity fermentation character right off the bat on the nose. Also dark caramel malt aromas and just a very faint alcohol aroma.  Deep brown with red highlights when held up to the light. Smallish head but a persistant rim around the glass with a little bit of lacing.  Flavor is very nice. I get lots of dark dark crystal (like 100-120) and a hint of roast malt. There's also just a hint of treacle/butterscotch. Fermentation character includes huge amounts of fruity esters that come off as plums and raisins and baked apples. Hops are spot on for bitterness but otherwise the hops are kind of an afterthought in this malt complex beer. I do get a little bit of alcohol flavor which is the only thing that keeps me off a 5.  Big bodied with a pretty sharp carbonation level, higher than the head would lead you to expect.  On a quality/price/strength ratio this is a knockout. You could drink better at higher prices and you could find a lot of mediocre beer at the same price level. This is a damn fine beer that works as a sipper and as a food pairing with roast meat or spicy food.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Belgian Dark Strong Ale,94
22,30,BuffaloBill91,4.89,"I bought this one and have held on to it for maybe 3-4 months before drinking  A- nice red brown color - pretty cloudy with lots of yeast flakes floating around. I got a big head on a light pour- looks like this thing has a ton of carbonation. Head settled to a nice 1/2 finger thick head quickly...  S- Very fruity maybe apples and pear or grapes with some floral tones- suprisingly no hints of the alcohol in the smell, which i was expecting with a 9% brew.  T- Quite sweet, close to the smell pretty fruity with an almost wine like taste yet nicely retains the ale qualities and a nice yeasty and caramel flavor in the aftertaste -Tasted pretty close to a true Belgian quad I had before. Nice brew- nice job Unibroue. Top notch.  M- Smooth- somewhat medium bodied and actually a lot thinner than I would've expected which accounts for the great drinkability im sure. -good carbonation- looks highly carbonated but its not.  D- Amazingly drinkable for a 9% --i could down these better than any macro. This is one of the best tasting ales I have tried easily as good as some beers that are twice the price.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Belgian Dark Strong Ale,94
22,30,paulzy,3.8,"Poured from a 12 ounce bottle into a standard conical pilsner glass. Had to roll the yeast out of the bottom of the bottle to get it all into the glass.  Appearance: Rich brown color straight from the bottle, a little like root beer. Head was frothy right away, and took several moments to settle down to two fingers worth. After about 5 to 10 minutes and several sips, the foam finally settled down to a carpet above the brew.  Smell: Very malty with a thick syrupy sweetness, full of fruit. I expected darker fruit smells, but I got a citrus-like smell from this beer. You know how you can smell it when someone opens a bottle of Coca-cola? Like that.  Taste: Tastes very balanced for a beer that smelled as strong as this one did. I tasted something a little like brown sugar early in the beer, to finish with a thick sweet malt with hop-like balance late to dry out tongue. A satisfying flavor that doesn't let you be satisfied. The hole in the bottom of my glass was mighty large with this beer.  Mouthfeel: Gentle mouthfeel, not too thick, not too empty. Carbonation is mild and does not interfere.  Drinkability: Highly quaffable. This is one of the better offerings I've had from Unibroue, and I'm glad I picked up more than one. It's more drinkable than I'd like, frankly, for a beer with this character.  Overall: An interesting, if mild, brew for a beer drinker. It's to be savored.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Belgian Dark Strong Ale,94
22,30,Stimack,4.03,"Poured this brew into a chalice and it poured to a deep rusit brown color with a thick off white head that had very good retention and left a fair share of lacing down the side of the glass. The aroma has a lot of interesting smells to it, dark fruit of raisins, plum and maybe a hint of grapes? The flavors are very good as well, make this an easy sipper even at 9%. Has a nice sweet profile that lingers with a yeasty break near the mid section and lingers. Caramel notes seem to come to mind more and more. Spices coe out more and more as it warms. Overall this is a great brew, very sorry that I have not had more of this in the past but there are just to many brew out there. The majority of the time I am very impressed with Unibroue and this just shows why.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Belgian Dark Strong Ale,94
22,30,MMAJYK,4.08,"A- Dark and deep brown with 1 inch of tan head after a medium pour. Brew is non transparent. Lacing works its way down the glass for the duration of the drink.  S- Smells of citrus fruits, toffee and caramel, vanilla, and some woodsy and roasted malts satisfy the nose.  T- Chocolate, same roasty malts, and dark over-ripened fruits. Leaves the mouth bitter with slight alcohol warming sensation on the back of the throat and chest.  M- Medium thickness and high carbonation. There is a nice sting all over the surface of the tongue.  D- High. Smooth and soft to drink, but the alcohol tastes and feel takes away a little bit of the drinkability factor.  Overall- Nice beer that is true to style. Complex and very enjoyable as a stand alone or maybe have 2 or 3 to really catch a heck of a buzz. Solid.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Belgian Dark Strong Ale,94
22,30,Lukie,4.45,"Great pour. Dark with hints of fiery orange as you hold it up to the light. The lacing sticks well to the sides of the glass, which is what I expect from good quality beers.  Dark fruits dominate the nose. Dark plum, raisin, sultana, and some nice sweet figs. Hints of alcohol come through the finish, but hop notes are non-existent.  Soft dark fruits. Hints of dark red grape, blackberries, and a hint of raspberry in the finish. Plum and slight raising also make it's way into it, coupled with slight hints of dark chocolate in the finish.  Zesty carbonation gives this a great feel, while still not too heavy to sit down and enjoy. The alcohol is masked well, and this one is a great late night sipper.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Belgian Dark Strong Ale,94
22,30,JoeyBeerBelly,4.85,"750ml corked & caged bottle, served in a Chimay goblet. Slow pour, as I prefer to keep the yeast in the bottle.  A - dark brown color with a lot of carbonation evident in the glass. Tiny bubbles kept rising to form and maintain a steady ring.  S - raisin/date, malt and yeast aromas fill the nose.  T - delicious tasting brew, sweet malty flavors dance on the tongue with a finish that's dry and smooth leaving a sweet fig after taste.  M - medium/full bodied with delicately crisp, clean carbonation.  D - exceptional brew; it doesn't get much better than this.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Belgian Dark Strong Ale,94
22,30,RblWthACoz,3.81,"Pours a nearly opaque ruby with a tan head. Nose is yeasty with rubber tones. Flavor is robust with hearty tones, though not overdone. Sweet a fair bit, but also like a grapey caramel. Feel is decent. Smooth with a fairly good level of carbonation. Pretty good as far as drinkability goes, but for the style I think there are stronger examples. Seems to be a bit too sweet overall, which leads me to judge that it has a more immature overall profile. Nice to try, but not one I would return to most likely.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Belgian Dark Strong Ale,94

Very easy drinking.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Belgian Dark Strong Ale,94
22,30,AKBelgianBeast,3.98,"This is another good offering from those crazy french canadians. Pours blackish brown with a thin slightly tan head. The nose is of some spice and dark malts, but mostly grainy belgian yeast. this beer has the good flavor of a belgian, but as is common with unibroue (IMO) the mouthfeel is way too thin to be convincing. You do taste the belgian yeast and dark fruit flavors in the beer, but it does not hit you like it should. Too thin in the mouth. Not sugary enough to belgian. However, it is incredibly refreshing and is dangerously drinkable. possibly one of the most refreshing ""belgian styles"" there is. Very thirst quenching, not afraid to take fat-ass gulps. It has that classic unibroue taste, and is very drinkable. Any beer that has that is ok in my book.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Belgian Dark Strong Ale,94
22,30,stephens101,4.67,"Pours dark brown with some yeast dregs floating within. Has an almost immortal, prolific tan head that dares you not to destroy it with a drink. Smells of dark fruits and some chocolate in the background. Tastes slightly bitter up front then some breadiness, alcohol heat, coriander and white grapes to round things out, leaving things complex yet balanced to perfection. Fairly light-bodied and very drinkable with a unique residual alcohol heat that warms the palate throughout the session. I will be revisiting this one many times in the future.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Belgian Dark Strong Ale,94

Smells suprisingly fruity, alcohol very present, finishes with malty, doughy, mapley goodness, i'm exicted.  Sharp spicy/tart/dry fruitiness up front leads into malty/vanilla finish with a very present and a little overdominating alcohol burn.  Smooth and creamy in mouth, suprisingly light carbonation.

22,30,BeerLover729,3.82,"This beer is an opaque dark copper with a large fizzy head that fades to a light laceing. The smell is of dark almost burnt malt with a notablely strong phenol smell that seems to volitalize and dissipate after a short time. The remaining aroma's are fruity and spicey and are most closely described as clove-like. The taste is slightly dry with a malty, but not overpoweringly sweet, finish. Some fruityness-grape, plum, etc.- with phenol's coming through as well. Medium to light body with sharp carbonation and minimal cloyingness. Alcohol is hidden decently well, goes down easy.

Smells of fresh tart grape, Meyer lemon, tangerine, berries, yeasty spicy doughy malt, caramel, touches of milk and soy sauce, and slightly solventy alcohol.  Tastes of sweet doughy malt and fresh fruit, with savory roasty caramel, dried fruit/ raisin, leather, yeasty spice. Hints of alcohol and acidity. Cohesive and characterful, tasty, and supremely balanced.  Smooth texture, very nice but bordering on too fizzy. Superb drinkability.  Great beer. Plenty of character and a pleasure to drink.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Belgian Dark Strong Ale,94
22,30,BiereBlanche,4.8,"12 oz bottle poured half into a snifter. I love the presentation, as I do all of the Unibroue bottles.  Pours a dark, cola-colored brown with a bit of yeasty sediment. The cap is two fingers high of a delicate light-brown that descends slowly and leaves large, lingering lacing. The aroma is quite mellow and pleasant. Lots of yeasty breadiness with delicate notes of citrus, light fruits and a perfectly faint hint of alcohol. The taste is perfectly balanced, delicate, mellow. A harmonious blend of bready sweet and light citrus flavors, very little alcohol presence. The same characteristics linger on seemingly forever (and wonderfully) in the aftertaste. Medium and with enough carbonation to add a lightness. Trois Pistoles is a dangerously drinkable offering. It holds up to the bottle's claim of being ""remarkably mellow"" and is delicate and perfectly balanced. I am most impressed at how perfectly the alcohol is presented, hidden enough to be incredibly drinkable, yet present in both aroma and mouth just enough to let drinker know Trois Pistoles is a serious, sophisticated drink to be sipped and enjoyed.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Belgian Dark Strong Ale,94

D: A highly drinkable, highly enjoyable dark beer from Unibroue. Makes a great winter session ale given it surprisingly light body and hides the 9% ABV very well.

Dryness, tart cherries, apricot & just a hint oaky vanilla as this warms. Finishes with dates, booze warmth, caramel, jammy notes, more vanilla; & more cherry tartness & just a tinge of smokey peat  MF: Slick with low carbonation & medium body  Drinks okay, maybe with a year or three aging this would mellow out, just a little too hot alcohol-wise for me, you get every bit of the 9% abv along with some complexity.

The efforvescent bubbles kept feeding this ring through the duration. The beer is a cola color except when held to light it takes on a ruby red color.  The aroma is quite nice. The yeasty, fruity (like ripe cherries and plums and a whole bunch of fruits!... like a ripe fruit salad!) smells are prominent.  The taste is just a bit smokey, yeasty, and fruity all at once... very balanced. Almost wine-like. A well-hidden alcohol warming at the finish.  The mouthfeel is on the thin side.... but not too much so. Typical fizzy Belgian that I must get used to. Nice aftertaste that lingers.

Dark reddish-brown with a solid bubbly finger of dark tannish head which settles a little too quickly into a thin but appetizing layer with light a light and flimsy lace.  Aroma is very bold. Dark fruits such as apricot, raisin, and fig, along with sweet caramel/toffee, and extremely spicy scents.  Very dry with a definite alcohol flavor. Both sweet and spicy. Subtle hints of brandy.  This one is chewy but still a little thin for the style which actually lends to a bit of a crisp, refreshing character. I've always been a fan of La Fin du Monde but meant to try other Unibroues, but unfortunately have always ended up going back to an old favorite.

About two fingers thick on the pour, but reduces to a creamy covering after a few sips. Some brussels lace present, but not as much as I would have expected.  Smell- The primary theme here is just slightly over-ripened fruits. More specifically I can detect notes of grapes, prunes, apples, a bit of banana, and maybe... mango? The background is more herbal with underpinnings of grassy, straw-like smells. Overall, the smells are coming mostly from the yeast- very little is contributed from the malt, and hops are almost undetectable.  Taste- The malt does come through in the taste and serves as a nice backdrop for the same fruity flavors that were found in the smell. Just a hint of licorice, and very low bitterness- but there definitely are some mellow, low alpha acid hops present.  Mouthfeel- Pretty standard/expected/appropriate mouthfeel for the style. Pretty big and malty leaving a bit of a syrupy feel at the finish. The active carbonation adds a nice sensation throughout.  Drinkability- Overall a very good and balanced beer that's easily quaffable, but not something to be guzzled. Like most good belgian style beers it's meant to be enjoyed at a reasonable pace so that all the complexities reveal themselves as the beer warms.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Belgian Dark Strong Ale,94
22,30,largadeer,4,"Appearance - Dark brown, almost black. Pours with 2 inches of off-white head.  Smell - Dark dried fruits, a bit vinous and very spicy.  Taste - More sweet than dry. Chocolate and dark fruit; notes of date and fig. Mild hops but heavily spiced; difficult to pick out specific flavors (a bit of clove, possibly). Moderate carbonation. Medium-bodied; lighter in body than it looks.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Belgian Dark Strong Ale,94
22,30,skeetermoses,4.35,"Great beer, I had this over Turkey day and was very impressed. This was a beer I was very happy with, I do like the Chambley that Unibroue offers but this was a pleasent supprise. The first beer from this company was La fin du mond, or the end of the world. I did not like that beer all that much, very drinkable, but not that great, This and the Chambley, were definately beers I would purchase again.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Belgian Dark Strong Ale,94
22,30,biking4beer,4.12,"Poured into my Chimay goblet.  Deep brown in color. Almost looks like prune juice. Slight tan head from an aggressive pour that dissipates to a marshmallow like whisp.  Belgian yeast is the predominant aroma. Cherries, apples, and vanilla also make an apperance. Slight phenolic aroma.  First sip reminds me of a red wine. Slightly sour with many fruity tones. Apples in an almost cider like fashion.  I felt like the carbonation was too high, and it was also a touch too dry for my taste.  Good beer for certain. I think I could polish off a 750 by myself. Lay down your 3 gold coins and give this one a try.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Belgian Dark Strong Ale,94

22,30,Antilochus,4.17,"Poured chilled (big mistake!) from a 341mL bottle into a snifter. Colour is dark brown, almost black, almost with purple notes. Head is tan and of medium size with lots left on the glass. Swirling nicely rejuvenates the head and evens it out.  Aromas are immediately Unibroue yeast (spicy), metallic roasted malt, black currant, brandy-like grape qualities, cherries, molasses, burnt sugar, cinnamon, and alcohol. Waited 20 minutes with the glass in hand to warm it. As it warmed the alcohol & yeast became more apparent. Less complex than other Belgian strongs but still flavourful and accessible.  Mouthfeel was moderately chewy and smooth with little carbonation, lots of sweetness, perhaps a little too bitter in the finish for a BSDA. Hot finish, strong yeast, dark malt, and cherries, with hints of raisin, molasses, vinegar (winey?), and other dark fruits. Sticks around on the palate for a while.  Reminds me of port - neither easy nor hard to drink - but very easy to drink for a 9% abv.  We're getting 10cm of snow (in November) and I'm happy clutching a BSDA of this caliber. Excellent brew.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Belgian Dark Strong Ale,94
22,30,dnichols,4.28,"I poured a 750 ml capped and corked bottle into a chilled chalice.  A; It poured a murky brown body that when back lit was a dirty caramel. A moderately aggressive pour resulted in a one finger head consisting of moderately sized sticky bubbles that receded, after an initial stand, to a light cover. The head supported an even lacing that did not remain long as the drink progressed.  S: It had a strong dark roasted sweet malt aroma with hints of yeasty dark breads and dark overripe fruits (plumes and figs).  T: It began with a rich sweet dark molasses flavor that was strongly influenced by the deeply roasted sweet malts that also produced flavors of dark fruit slowly cooked in brown sugar and toffee.  M: It was a joy to every part of my mouth. The sweet malts coat the mouth. That is followed by a warmth that reminded me of a sip of dark hot chocolate on a cool fall night. There is a very clean finish with a bit of lingering sticky sweetness that makes the next swig a welcome event.  D: This is a solid BSDA. It has the complex flavors and warming ABV. I could work my way through a handful before realizing that I was ""working"". The sweetness and high ABV would eventually limit my consumption.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Belgian Dark Strong Ale,94
22,30,mat5175,3.57,"Good cloudy dark appearance. Pours a big thick head, that dissipates quickly leaving clean walls.  Great nose with mild fruit and bread notes.  Silky mouthfeel with an average carbonation, not too lively.  Great dessert beer. This is light in flavor, if not in ABV. That's not to say it doesn't have plenty of flavor because it does. Its just very balanced and refreshing. Could easily be substituted for the glass of port after dinner. The darkest of the Unibroue's that i have tried so far. Darker in color and more complex in flavor than either Don De Dieu and La Fin De Monde. Another great offering from this brewer.  Given the ABV i can't drink a ton of these, but it certaily isn't because the flavor either fatigues or gets boring. This is good all day, as long as you aren't going anywhere.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Belgian Dark Strong Ale,94
22,30,Jmamay22,3.95,"This Belgian Strong Dark Ale pours a very dark nearly opaque ruby red with a nice tan colored head. The head thins out to a small creamy looking cap. No lacing left behind.  Smells of the typical Unibroue yeast with hints of dark fruit and very sweet almost syrup like alcohol. No hints of hops, but only a light pleasant aroma. I almost bumped the score down to 3.5 due to the somewhat muted nose, but felt 4.0 was more deserving.  Very delicate taste, but the fruit taste is intensified. Hint of black currant and possibly dark cherries mixed among the other typical dark fruit and yeast. Finishes a little hot with the alcohol and spice. Almost bumped this up to 4.5, but left it at 4.0 due to some harshness of the alcohol finish.  Mouthfeel comes off as a little too thin, but has a proper amount of carbonation. Drinkability is neither exceptional nor difficult. One 12oz. is good for me, but it's enjoyable until the last drop. Not the most amazing BSDA, but a good example from a North American brewery.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Belgian Dark Strong Ale,94

And they all smell the same! I don't mean to be so harsh, it is a good beer, but I wish it had more of a dark fruit character, and the alcohol seems a little too warm. It does however go quite well with a nice piece of dark chocolate.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Belgian Dark Strong Ale,94
22,30,stormstarter28,4.52,"Pours a deep brown with an average tan head, little lacing. Rich smell of raisin/cherry, and slight smell of alcohol. Taste is not too bitter, not too malty, not too yeasty, not too alcoholic...just right on all flavors, and very balanced. Incredibly smooth for a 9% brew. A great brew, and one of my new favorites!",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Belgian Dark Strong Ale,94
22,30,LittleBreeze,4.28,Looks stunning in a tulip glass. Bold rich coloring. Brown with hints of ruby at the edges.  Tastes and smells slightly of dark candied fruits and cherry juice.

Surprised and delighted to find this beer for sale in Ireland; I have always had a high regard for Unibroue. Uncorked with a nice pop and a whiff of gunsmoke. Not over vigourous when poured into Chimay chalice, a dark brown cloudy brew with a generous thick cream head. Nice carbonation - a fizzy kick to it. Even though this bottle had been removed from the fridge for an hour, the smell was muted at first, but definitely improved as it warmed further. Tasted really great; my daughter identified ""berries"" in the taste (and I wouldn't dispute that) and I also definitely detected bread there.

Taste of sweet dark fruit, some candi sugar is prevalent. Belgian spices under the heavier yeast taste.

Overall there is so much flavor to love here.  M: One of the creamiest beers I've had, up there with three philosophers.  D: No harsh aftertaste, and delicious.

Good flavor variation here.  Mouthfeel: Very carbonated, which adds a bubbly bite to each sip. Medium thickness and very creamy.  Drinkability: Very good beer.

Nice fizzy off-white 2 finger head, leaving some lacing. Aroma is of malts, chocolate, caramel and some fruitiness a little miskiness detected. Tastes similar to smell, with some bananas, and lots of over-ripened fruits (raisins or prunes), maybe some fig flavors and a nice alcohol warmth in the belly. Mouthfeel is medium viscocity and mouthcoating, but as it moves back, a nice carbonated fizziness is felt on the tongue. Very pleasant indeed. Overall this is another excellent beer from Unibroue.

Dark fruit flavors (plums, raisins, apples) come through strongly, with only minor hints of Belgian spices. There is almost a red wine quality to this beer. The alcohol is masked almost completely, which makes it seem a bit more approachable. However there is a warming finish. Mouthfeel is medium to thick, and well carbonated. I found it to be quite similar to their other dark Belgians, but I can't say if it's better or worse. Just that you know you're getting a quality beer whichever way you go with Unibroue.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Belgian Dark Strong Ale,94

The smell was fruity with some bubblegum as well, I actually didnt like the smell compared to the other unibroues that i have had. The taste was similar, tasted a bit sweet. The alcohol isnt present in the taste but it does warm a bit which is nice. Carbonation was good but the beer was a bit too full-bodied for me. Overall a good beer but, at least for me, does not stack up to the rest of their lineup.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Belgian Dark Strong Ale,94

The smell is typical Unibroue with pronounced corriander aroma, not much else. It has a cola like base that is followed by spice, mainly corriander, with some dark fruit notes & semi-sweet chocolate. It almost has a cola mixed with red wine flavor, not awful like it sounds. The feel is kind of light and very fizzy. The carbonation probably takes away from the taste a bit. The brew starts off quite dry but finishes slick with some alcohol belly burn. A bit of a jumble going on there. All in all a good solid beer, not sure I'm sold on Unibroue. Good beers but they tend to taste similar.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Belgian Dark Strong Ale,94

Virtually no head despite an aggressive pour.  Aroma is malty and sweet. Hints of raisins, caramel, wood, Belgian candy sugar, white pepper, and other spices. Some very light floral hops are detectable as well.  Flavors of dark fruits, coco, Belgian spices, hints of the alcohol, and roasted malts. Hops hide around the corner barely peeking out to add subtle bitterness. The brewery's website suggests this as a desert beer paired with dark chocolate, so I decided to try it with some dark artisan nonpareils.  Unibroue is really turning out to be one of my new favorite breweries. I find myself simply loving everything they make.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Belgian Dark Strong Ale,94

Appearance - Pours a dark brown with a medium tan head. It resembles the look of a cola. The way the carbonation rises to the surface of the beer, the color, the head, not the bottle though.  Smell - The smell of fruit and malt. It has the sweet scent of a Belgian with an alcohol accent.  Taste - Clove, plum, alcohol. A complex and enjoyable and interesting brew.

22,30,kenito799,3.32,"750 ml bottle, poured into a Duvel glass. There is a date on the label, 11-08-09...expiration? At 9%, could likely age.  Pours a very dark hazy brown with off-white head that rises then fades to a ring. Little wisps of lace dot the glass as it is emptied, but not sticky (high ABV).  Aroma has the unmistakeably pleasant Unibroue Begian notes, fruity bubble gum, cola, nutmeg.  On the palate. At first mouthfeel is quite fizzy and creamy from active carbonation, but this eventually falls off and leaves a somewhat dextrinous liquid. The flavor is lightly spiced dark pruney fruit, discernable sweetness counterbalanced with a bitterness that comes from alcohol and...what? Not sure if it's spice or hops, if this were wine I would say there are bitter tannins but i don't know where they would come from. Maybe from roasted malt. The bitterness definitely lingers, but the overall effect lacks complexity and leaves me somewhat unsatisfied.  This is my second try with Trois Pistoles. The first time the beer was somewhat cooked and became overly sweet, so I didn't review it. This bottle was treated better but I still was not impressed. Unibroue tweaks its flavor profiles so subtly, is it remarkable how different the results are. For me this one is something of a miss, although it is by no means a bad beer. There are just more complex and tasty BSDAs out there.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Belgian Dark Strong Ale,94

Sweet aroma, darkly fruity and malty with only the slightest hint of floral hops. Chocolate, raisins, toffee, malted milk, coriander, pepper, all with a slightly sour-funk finish. Mmmmm, this smells delicious. Lots going on inside.  Taste is like the smell, only not quite as intense on the sweet, and more intense on the spicey sour-funk. Funk-lovers should get some of this.

S: Belgian candy sugar up front, this is going to be sweet, I can tell. A little yeasty goodness slowly follows up, accompanied by his buddy alcohol.  T: The sugar isn't as aggressive as I thought it would be, but it still makes it self known up front. Cherries and other dark fruits set the stage while some complex and warming spiced notes round it all out well. I think I might lay some down and see if some of that sugar will mellow.  M: Medium mouthfeel with some active bubbles, but not as sharp as I would expect. Still, I don't think I would change it, even if I could.  D: I give it a Lionel Richie... ""All night long"". Oh yeah, I went there.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Belgian Dark Strong Ale,94

Flavor has some grape notes, along with a slight oakey bite. Very nice. Mouthfeel is very smooth to start, but seemed to finish somewhat harsh. Not sure if that was the alcohol peeking thru or not.

Very dark purple/cola colored brew with a large soapy, sand-colored head that thins out after time to sit.  Smell is very good. Large sweet, dark fruity malt aroma, Belgian candy sugar, bakers chocolate, alcohol and guava.  Taste is good. Dark sweet fruits, Belgian yeast and alcohol. Mellow compared to the nose and a very clean finish. Time has definitely mellowed things out.  Mouthfeel is good. Fresh, most Unibroue beers usually have a huge amount of carbonation. This 2 year old bottle has substantially less carbonation but still enough to keep things interesting (my preference.) Medium bodied with a relatively clean finish.  Drinkability is very good. I could probably drink a four-pack of this stuff with easy. Goes down smooth and easy.  Overall: One of, if not, my favorite Unibroue beer. The dark fruit flavors and the drinkability is extremely well done here. I would recommended this brew to wine drinkers because of how similar the flavors are to wine.  I think I prefer this brew with about a year on it instead of this 2 year-old bottle. The flavor has mellowed almost too much. Still, a very nice brew.

Has some great retention though. The past few bottles of this stuff I had were way over-carbonated, but led to a massive head. Still menacing looking though with the dark red color of the liquid and the cool looking label.  S- Not all that complex, but very enjoyable. Some dark fruits... and light fruits. A good caramel and little bit of bready malt backing. A little bit of spice, alcohol, and mustiness. The Belgian yeast is very apparent.  T- Very sweet. The fruitiness and caramel are good. The mustiness makes is presence known as well. The Belgian yeast is very prominent. The alcohol is noticeable. Very tasty.  M- Very smooth but crisp on the finish.

T- tastin gmore like a fine aged wine than a beer, there was black cherry, dried cranberry, orange blossom honey, soft milk chocolate, and some unidentifiable spices maybe grains of paradise or allspice? herbal hops make a brief appearance toward the end with a bitter grassy leafy bite that mellows out into a sweet pleasant sherry/port aftertaste.

I will be buying this one again and recommend this one to anyone that can find one.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Belgian Dark Strong Ale,94
22,30,bunnyhustle,4.18,"Poured from 750 ml bottle. Pours a deep brown with nice tan-ish head. Thick head at first but quickly dissolves leaving behind a good layer that stays for the rest of the beer. Smell is of yeast, sour fruit (mainly green apple) and some alcohol. Taste is great. Tastes is of some fruits, some alcohol, and some chocolate. A very complex drink. High carbonation leaves a slightly creamy feel and a distinct after-taste. This is a tremendous beer, the only low marks are on the drinkability as this high alcohol content makes it hard to enjoy more than one or two without seeing double!",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Belgian Dark Strong Ale,94
22,30,Maracuja,4.2,"Another winner from our friends up north. Maltier than most of the other Unibroue creations. This makes the beer seem bigger than most of their other styles. Chewy and creamy. It pours a nice scarlet brown with a quickly diminishing, but not disappearing tan head. Fruity and spicy. Big time flavors every direction you turn. Alcohol is a major player here, especially in the finish. Wine like taste settles in late and passes out on your couch (i.e. sticks around for a long time). But not neccessarily the type of visitor you want to leave. (The bottle notes this as ""port"". Call me uncouth, but I don't know beans about wine, so I will just take their word). Quite an stellar brew in my book, and just a step below their some of their other offerings (Don, Fin and Maudite). Usually a ""second-tier"" beer in a brewery's repitoire is nothing to get overly excited about. But Unibroue is an exception to all rules. Everything they touch is gold.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Belgian Dark Strong Ale,94
22,30,jjayjaye,4.3,"Pours an opaque darkness with a thin wispy light tan head that is kept alive by small surface pools of tiny bubbles that are a give away to the immanent mouth feel. The smell is aggressive and interesting. There is a dark fruit base that is seriously 'kicked up' with something else. All i can associate it with right now is bubblegum which i know doesn't sound flattering, but it complements the flavor. Medium bodied, the tiny bubbles lend a silky creaminess to the entire experience. There are caramel notes in the nose and in the flavor as well. It finishes very clean. A really nice drinker; this one's a keeper..eh!",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Belgian Dark Strong Ale,94
22,30,becktone,4.76,"In a goblet:  Eye: This beer pours a very dark brown, maybe even black with dark brown highlights. head is stable, creamy and tan in color. Looks great all in all. Lacing is good looking too.  Nose: Spicy, with notes of alcohol right upfront. Dark fruit aromas as well. There is definitely a dominate aroma here, I just can't put it into words. It is definitely more from the yeast phenols and esters as opposed to malt characteristics. Overall rich aroma...Ahh.. after a taste there it is, banana and clove esters.  Tongue: Overall, as with most Belgian styles, this is a complex brew. Right upfront banana and clove. Lingering taste of clove after the brew has been swallowed. In between that there is a little bit of dark malt character, hard to detect over the phenols, but I think that I perceive it there. Huh, after two years of reviewing beers I feel that my palate is still not anywhere near being close to discern all that is going on. I just know that this is a little bit of heaven and strongly recommend it.  Mouthfeel and Drinkability: Well, I could drink this all night, in fact I plan to, its my first day off in a long while and I feel like getting wasted, and this beer will do that-at 9% it only takes a few. Anyway, the feel is medium-heavy with low carbonation, which befits the style. This beer is easy to drink, hell I just said I was going to drink it all night. Ha! This is a great brew, I recommend it for anyone who is interested in Belgian Strong Dark Ales. So far for me, its this and Chimay Blue. Rochefort 8 is also great, but one can get the to afore mentioned in larger bottles for a cheaper price/oz.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Belgian Dark Strong Ale,94
22,30,rafjr00,4.08,"12oz bottle into a tulip glass  Poured with a nice 3 finger head that stuck around for a short time then thined out to a film of small bubbles. Dark Red / Brownish color, reminded me of old copper that has no patina on it.  Smell was mainly of spice, clove and all spice, with a slight yeast odor.  Taste was nice with clove and spice and a hint of yeast. The aftertaste was of unfiltered apple cider and black cherries.  It was a little high in carbonation, but it help give it a nice mouth feel. I will be adding these ""three French coins"" to me fridge more often.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Belgian Dark Strong Ale,94
22,30,sstackho,4.47,"12oz bottle. Pours a dark brown with lots of head and carbonation. Aroma is divine - smells rather wheaty and yeasty, kind of like Unibroue's Maudite. Flavour is wonderful - again it feels somewhat like a weizenbock. Delicious stuff, with a bit of fruitiness creeping in. Maudite is a regular beverage in my fridge, but this one hasn't been. I'd like to taste them side by side to compare as I feel there are some similarities.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Belgian Dark Strong Ale,94

Lightly peppery. Nice balance of aromas.  T - Similar to a trippel in taste; sweet and citrusy. Some tartness, also.  M - Highly carbonated and with an alcoholic warmth sure to lead to some major heartburn. Sticky, yet crisp.  D - Easy to drink and refreshing on a warm summer day. Could easily consume more of this if it weren't such a strong beer.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Belgian Dark Strong Ale,94
22,30,MTNboy,3.85,"Appearance- A very dark brown, cloudy a slightly tan and off white head. The head was also thick leaving a beautiful lace.  Smell- A very sweet desert like scent. Resembled a the smell of a desert at a nice restaurant.  Taste- A little bit liquor like but not as much as thought it would be. A pretty complex flavor of spices, malt, fruity and a bit of hops.  Mouthfeel- Full bodied and thick but very smooth like an aged brandy.  Drinkability- A wonderful sipping and relaxing beer.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Belgian Dark Strong Ale,94
22,30,smttycty,3.57,"Dark brown, fairly opaque, with a monster light tan head. Lacing is heavy but not real sticky. Unbelievably wonderful nose of sweet vanilla custard and coffee.  A strong brandy-like flavor floods the taste buds in a thick wave that expands in your mouth. Over-ripe apricots and a little hop character in the background. Overly fizzy, almost harsh, yet sticky in the mouth.  A strange concoction that doesn't quite live up to the fantastic, dreamy aroma. It's big and bold, but interesting. Brace yourself for this one, but isn't that defeating the purpose?",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Belgian Dark Strong Ale,94
22,30,BravoTwo,4.8,"Great beer, although I have no idea what a pistoles is, but don't really care. This poured out a beautiful dark brown opaqueness with minimal tan head. Smell was very dark, and offered a hint of the taste.  Taste was exceptional. For a 9% beer, the alchohol was hidden very much in taste, which was reminiscent of dark melted brown sugar. Spice and malt was also highly present. Maybe some burnt butterscotch. Lots going on and all good.  Shared this bottle with a friend, and we both agreed that it was a shame that we only had one bottle. Will definitely drink more of this.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Belgian Dark Strong Ale,94
22,30,scottbrew4u,4.47,"On this blazing hot and humid evening, the condensation formed on the bottle almost immediately after I removed it from my fridge.  This beer poured out a bit heady but quickly settled down to a nice off-white head and not too thick. Color appears deep amber and a bit hazy but very appealing and ok for this style.  Aroma is malty and sweet on the front with some toffee and dried raisin notes. Some faint floral hop aroma is perceived but only behind the sweet and bready malts.  This beer begins sweet and smooth with a lot of dried fruit and candy sugar character. Noticeable breadiness and alcohol present as well. More in the background almost indistinguishable is a slight hop bitterness but it is quickly masked by the malts which are dominant in this beer.  This beer is medium in body with with the right amount of light carbonation and perceivable alcohol warmth at the finish. This is a strong one at 9% alcohol by volume.  It is a deliciously sweet beer so it is going quite well with tortilla chips and salsa right now. Try this one to start out the night with and be quite impressed by it's flavor and strength.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Belgian Dark Strong Ale,94

The head retention is phenomenal as well as the thick lace that accompanies it.  S - Dark woody malts and rich bready aromas as well as gentle tropical fruit and floral scents are present. A huge scent of fig with a vinous quality and a hint of nut bread.  M - A feel that is both sweet, vinous, rich and creamy. Totally delightful all the while .Finishes on the dry side w/ the alcoholic warmth leading into flavor remarks.  T - Spicy belgian yeast w/ a light metallic taste. A minor vegetal and pepper taste w/ nutty grainy malt flavors.. Sweet candy sugar in the creamy finish makes for a sweet full on Dark Belgian Ale w/ a mild currant aftertaste.  D - I drank the whole 750ml + was still craving more after the yeast was decanted w/ the last drops of ale.

Various carnations of sugars swirl around with Belgian malts and spicy, aged hops. A line of sweet cocoa runs throughout. Yes!  m: Lively mouth-filling carbonation, well on the high side of things but not overwhelming on the palate. Nice, satisfying medium body apparently lightened somewhat by the carbonation.  t: Easily a good BSDA. Plenty of dark, sweet fruits carried on lighter, bready malts with a nice note of papery, spicy hops. Nice sugars. Dry finish with a touch of yeast and earthy wood.

Either way I am happy.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Belgian Dark Strong Ale,94
22,30,socalde,4.68,"Picked up a 750mL bottle by chance at the local liquor store. Served in a hollow-based tulip glass.  Appearance- Dark and sinister as the label suggests. This beer pours with a intriguing, full-sized, light tan coloured head which dissipates quickly to leave a lingering epidermis of sinful bubbles ready to be pierced by the blade of your thirst.  Smell- I must admit, I was hoping for this beer to really enrapture that sense that is most strongly linked to memory. But, in years to come... I'm afraid I may forget the details of this well-crafted beer. I find it difficult to pin down exactly what I get out of the aroma here... A touch of hops, almost (but not entirely) smothered in an abundance of sweetness and a dark aroma unique to this beer. Although this ale is rated at a sobriety breaking 9% ABV, not a tinge of alcohol comes through on the nose.  Taste- If in heaven you drink fine wine, and in Hell you drink this.... Please, throw me into the fiery depths of Dante's Inferno because this brew is worth it. Sinister dark malts plague your taste buds, followed by a warmth of alcohol that doesn't even touch your palate... Nay! It only presents it's warmth after it has decended down your esophageas.  Mouthfeel- I feel that this is the area that most deserves improvement with this beer. It is a bit too tingly and carbonated for my taste, but it may have been exactly what the creators were aiming for. Who am I, but a mere mortal to judge the hellish intent of the brewmaster at Unibraue!?  Drinkability- Whilst writing this masterpiece of a beer review, I have become increasingly intoxicated by this furtive ale. A tribute that this is not a beer to be taken lightly. However, it is astonishingly refreshing and drinkable considering the complexity and evil intent of this beer.  If you can afford the $7.99 pricetag on this beautiful temptation of the underworld... Do so of your own accord, for I am forever indebted by the intoxicating hedonistic forbidden affair.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Belgian Dark Strong Ale,94
22,30,dickieb,4.25,"Poors dark but transparet brown, with a soda-like head that dissipates quickly. The smell is a bit lite, with some fruityness and malts. The taste is quite complex and enjoyable. The fruit that is apprent is subtle and compliments the malts and beligian yeast well. The mouthfeel is a bit lite, which in turn makes it a bit more drinkable for me. Very tasty, very good beer",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Belgian Dark Strong Ale,94
22,30,Overlord,4.4,"Great beer.  Dark, but not overpoweringly so. I'm a sucker for a strong, dark beer that has a light fruit aftertaste and with hints of sweetness (not too much, mind you). Perhaps the best of Unibroue's offerings...I will have to think on this.  Very drinkable for its potency, and with a great thick feeling that is pleasant rather than cloying.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Belgian Dark Strong Ale,94
22,30,manofmanners,4.53,"My father brought this down from Quebec for me. At first I didn't know what to think of it for the simple fact that it had a cork in it. But i chilled it down and popped the cork. I smelled the cork, even though it isn't a wine, and was pleased with the scent it gave off. It was a fruity scent put i couldn't place, but it tickled my nostrals. I poured it into a pint glass and to my surprise it had a color close to Guinness, but not to dark as to not light a little light through. It had a nice head to it, not to frizzy. When i took a sip, i know i was in for a pleasure. It had a taste that words can't do justice. It had at first the taste of your average Canadian beer, but the after taste was a fruity and enjoyable. It went down quickly and before I knew it i drank the 24 oz bottle in the matter of minutes. I had a good buzz for a while. I highly suggest it you try it for the first time, don't read the bottle. It gives away a lot of it's secerts.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Belgian Dark Strong Ale,94
22,30,drinkininthewood,3.7,"I have had this brew before and remember it being absolutely magnificent.  Served from another fancy 341ml Unibroue bottle into a Goblet.  A- Dark, dark brown with probably one of the nicest tan heads ive ever seen on a beer with very good lacing.  S- Tonnes of dark fruit aromas, roasted malts, hints of chocolate/cocoa, smells like a sherry wine.  T- As the beer warms, the flavors just come out beautifully. Very fruity, dark roasted malts, some wicked spices, with some cocoa,flavors of dark chocolate truffles, alcohol is noticed, it truly does have flavors of an decent port wine.  M- Slick,nice and creamy with a medium body and small amount of carbonation.  D- very very enjoyable beer. Easily one of the most drinkable beers ive had. 1 or 2 does the trick.  Overall what else is new. Another desirable beer from Unibroue. This truely is an admirable beer. Ive shown it to wine connoisseurs and they truly believe that it is one of the best beers in the world which in my opinion, is right on the money. Enjoy!",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Belgian Dark Strong Ale,94
22,30,Karyyk,3.78,"This one was very interesting for me. I've never had a beer like this (I realize I'm showing my inexperience with that statement, but hey, I'm being honest). When I read the label and noted the claim that it had a ""pleasant aftertaste that lingers like a port wine"" I knew I had to try it. At $6.99 for 750ml, the price is right.  Appearance is very good. Has nice head to begin with, that dissipates with a nice frothing effect. The color is very dark, and somewhat winey. All-in-all, before the first sip is taken, I was already impressed.  I found the smell more similar to wine really, fruity with some nuttiness. I didn't spend much time noting this, as I was ready to get to actually tasting it. The taste is unusual, but nice. Very complex, and again, more akin to a wine than what the usual drinker is accustomed to in beer, especially your average American beer drinker. The alcohol is definitely noticeable, but not overpowering, and if you're used to something like a port or sherry (usually in the 17% range), then this isn't particularly noteworthy overall. This would be the perfect beer to gift to a wine-drinker. The aforementioned claim about it lingering like a port are apparent and quite valid.  Mouthfeel and drinkability are quite good. I myself found myself sipping this rather than gulping, again bringing comparisons to wine. While carbonation is apparent, it's very mellow for a beer and soothing. This is a unique brew to be sure, and I can see those used to drinking macrobrews finding it a bit too strong. If you like good beer though, especially if you also can appreciate a good wine from time to time, Trois Pistoles will satisfy.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Belgian Dark Strong Ale,94
22,30,BucBasil,4.36,"Appearance: Amazingly beautiful bottle and labeling, as found on all Unibroue bottles. I feel like a bad ass opening and pouring this. The brew pretty much jumps out of the bottle as I slowly pour it into a goblet, leaving the yeast sediment in the bottom of the bottle, then pouring it separately into a shot glass and drinking it separately (it's good for you!). Appearance is cola dark, almost black but with deep ruby notes coming through at times. Tan head is large and foamy, but dissipates after a minute. Minimal lacing.  Smell: Weak smells of dark fruit, something citric, and perhaps licorice. Somewhat medicinal as well. Too weak for me to appreciate. Not a strong part of this brew in my opinion.  Taste: Very good, classic dark Belgian taste. Heavy. Very malty up fruit yielding to dark fruits - plums and raisins. Something citric in the middle, but not sour... more sugary... as if there were a piece of lime candy in my glass? Alcohol is very noticable in the finish.  Mouthfeel: Very little carbonation. Medium bodied. Coats the tongue, enveloping the entire mouth in flavor.  Drinkability: Very drinkable, and very accessible. I feel like I could put quite a few of these down. I may regret it a little after, but it's cheap enough (about 2$ a bottle) that I wouldn't feel like I was wasting something special. A more accessible (and cheaper!) version of a Trappist ale, I'll definitely pick this up again.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Belgian Dark Strong Ale,94

22,30,pmcadamis,4.77,"A - A big solid four finger khaki head rises over a dark mahogany brown brew with rootbeer highlights. The head eventually recedes to a half finger cap and leaves some nice spotty lace on my snifter. A swirl brings the head back up to a thick finger, and causes thick sheets of lace to slide down the glass. I started to notice reddish and peach-orange tints to the brew as the volume in the glass lessened....what a fascinating color!  S - Very fruity with aromas of kiwi, lime, peach, and a darker note of dates or prunes. Behind the fruitiness, and very nice yeast characteristic quickly identifies this as a Belgian style ale. Warm coconut cookies straight from the oven and a light whiff of alcohol come out as it warms. Overall, this smells much lighter and fruitier that I would have expected, but there is still a very dark and dusty undertone ....I like it!  T - Candy sugar coated dates with lime juice sprinkled on them. Initially sweet, then citric, then fading to a long warming finish after the swallow. Fruity with pear and peach juicy flavors and lightly toasted caramel malt undertones. This is damn good stuff!  M - Full bodied, rich, and exquisitely silky. Low levels of carbonation and a high level of alcohol add up to a very smooth and extremely creamy satiny mouthfeel. Outstanding!  D - Excellent. I could never get bored with this stuff. Its light and fruity enough to be refreshing in warm weather, and its rich and warming enough to enjoy in the winter months. This is a nearly flawless brew....the only downfall is that it could be a bit too sweet. But that's just nitpicking.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Belgian Dark Strong Ale,94

22,30,Clockwork420,2.91,"Got this one today for $6.99.  Bought it for a try at another ale, But a stronger one at that. Poured it into a glass, a small amount also I might add.  The Appearance is a medium dark brown, Reddish hues and a cloudy sort of appearance. 1 fingers worth of head, hello and goodbye. Light lacing.  Looked like sody pop. Smelled like flowery and fruity sweetness. And did not hide the alcohol content at all. This is not a bad thing though.  Taste was strong and lasting. Had a burning taste from the high alcohol content. Didnt feel this was a great thing but somthing different every once in a while is good. Taste like the smell. After a few glasses, I soon felt why it was such a good brew. I now really liked this one, but for the price I pass.  Mouthfeel was Vaporous. If thats a word. It was thinner than others. Not thick but and chewy at all. Sleek but harsh.  Drinkability was okay. I would save it and put it in the celler if possible. That could do wonders for this one. I dont favor this but it was good in a sense.  Strong.  I probably will buy this again. Next time I will drink colder I think. Had to go out and buy a cork for this one. HA HA HA.

22,30,LittleCreature,4.37,"Appearance - 4.0 Almost exactly like cola, from the colour to the rapidly rising bubbles. I am shocked how fizzy this beer looks. The two fingers of darkish brown head disappeared almost instantly.  Smell - 4.5 Although there is a high alcohol volume, this is just barely evident in the smell. It smells rather sweet, although not particularly strong. I can detect aromas of licorice, vanilla, and a malty sweetness. With a little warming there is a nice smell of overripe fruit.  Taste - 4.5 Yummy! The alcohol is immediately evident, and perhaps not as well masked as it could be, although this improves as the beer warms up. Most impressive is the aftertaste, which lingers in the mouth, leaving the taste of a good port.  Mouthfeel - 4.5 I am really relieved that the initial violent fizziness has gone away, leaving the beer only slightly fizzier than average for a dark ale. It feels relatively light for this kind of beer, and quite mellow.  Drinkability - 4.0 There are other strong Belgian beers that mask their alcohol better, but as this warms up it becomes smoother, tastier and more drinkable. As I am finishing the glass I could actually see myself wanting a second in one sitting.  OVERALL The longer I spent on this one the more it grew on me, which I think was largely due to starting it a little too cold. It was worth the money to try once, and it is certainly special, but I will probably not get it again. Very good beer, but there are better of its style. Edit: Second sampling of this beer bumped the score from 4 to 4.35. Definitely drank too cold first time around. Excellent.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Belgian Dark Strong Ale,94
22,30,Hawthorne,4.63,"This beer is truly special. The pour is nice leading to a robust head that is known for its long good-byes.

It smells spicy (as most Unibroue brews do). Perhaps it's a peppery smell. Definitely malty. Notes of dark fruit, molasses and brown sugar are present.  Taste: Initially, it's spicy. Certainly not overly so. It's a bit of a light spiciness. Actually a bit less than other Unibroue beers I've tried. Dark fruit tastes are certainly present and a sweet taste to it. Very nice malty flavor. On the outskirts are a molasses like taste. Very complex.  Mouthfeel/Drinkability: It's medium bodied and very smooth. Very well carbonated. At 9%, it's strong, but you really can't tell. It's masked very well and it's very drinkable. Certainly not a session, but very drinkable all the same.

22,30,basica,4.72,"I have been very curious about this beer for a while. After buying one to go from Brewerkz, I have had it sit in my fridge for a while and I finally got to tasting this fine beer one night. The Unibroue bottle is one of the more elegant looking bottles around, with a nice silver foil round the neck and top of the bottle and the words ""Unibroue"" printed on the foil. At the back of the bottle there is a silver printing which reads ""L044"". According to the Unibroue website this signifies the bottling date and L represents November, 04 means 4th and 4 means 2004. Therefore my bottle is bottled on November 4, 2004. Trois Pistoles is pronounced (Trwa-pee-stole) and is actually a place in Canada; I would not bore anyone with any more of the history. This beer is brewed in Quebec, Canada but it follows the Belgian Strong Dark Ale style of brewing leaving it with aromatic fruity notes. The Trois Pistole poured out with a mild head which disspitates very quickly leaving slight lacing. It smells subtlely of some dried or dark fruits and has a very strong taste of those fruits. The 9 ABV goes amazingly smooth and hardly feels heavy at all if taken slow; this strength, however, gives it great beer character on top of the great taste. The after taste is equally fantastic though not as long lasting as I may have liked it to be. I felt that the Trois Pistoles taste is similar to the Westmalle Dubbel, heavily fruity, but the fruity taste in the Westmalle Dubbel is definitely stronger and, at 7 ABV is less potent compared to the Trois Pistoles and, thus I still prefer the Westmalle Dubbel. BUt these 2 beers definitely have similarities, in my opinion. The Trois Pistole is a GREAT beer and fully lived up to my expectation. If I had not tried the Westmalle Dubbel before this one, I would probably be totally overwhelmed as this kind of matured, dark, very slightly sweet fruit taste turns out to be my favourite taste (for now) in Boutique Belgian Ales.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Belgian Dark Strong Ale,94
22,30,Cyberkedi,4.41,"Pours a deep, opaque brown with a thick and rich head. Aroma is nice, unusual, very fruity, more like that of a cider. Very pleasing flavor has strong pear overtones, is mostly malty with some smoky hints; in a way it tastes more like a cider than a beer. This is a brew to be sipped and savored by itself, rather than chugged or consumed with a meal. I strongly recommend this one.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Belgian Dark Strong Ale,94
22,30,khiasmus,4.32,"A- Dark brown with a creamy light tan head. pretty.  S- Smells dark and malty... peppery, earthy, herbal, vegetal, sweet sugar and molasses. A complex and thoroughly enjoyable nose.  T- Malty up front, with a lot of pepper and some herbal notes. A slight amount of pine and hops in the very back that comes to balance... taste is wonderful.  M- Smooth and low in carbonation.. almost buttery, but in a good way.  D- You could have a couple. It's very very good. mmmm.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Belgian Dark Strong Ale,94
22,30,cpn920,3.85,"This was my first Belgian Strong Dark Ale and it must be my immature beer palate because I only mildly enjoyed it. The appearance was spectacular with a champagne like head that dissipated fairly quickly. I could smell fruit, maybe cherries, that was pleasing. The taste was a little sweet for my liking and fairly light. The mouthfeel was one of high carbonation. I wouldn't want to drink more than one of these in a sitting. I want to try this style again now that I know what I should be expecting in this type of beer. I'm a stout and porter guy and this was far from those styles.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Belgian Dark Strong Ale,94
22,30,Brad007,4.13,"Beer pours dark with a reddish hue. Aroma is somewhat nutty with mostly alcohol showing through. Taste is interesting though. Tart and strong with an alcohol backbone. Mouthfeel is warm, almost too warm. Leaves a tartness on the tongue reminiscent of cherry. In fact, cherry is one of the flavors that seems to be in this beer. There's also some raisin hint. Overall, another quality Belgian Strong Ale from Unibroue. Definitely might go well with dessert.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Belgian Dark Strong Ale,94
22,30,seanyfo,4.5,"330ml bottle poured into a leffe chalice  I was not prepared for how good this beer would be.  Appearance - Dark mahogany, reminiscent of a scottish wee heavy.Thick syrupy looking head, that is everlasting. Almost so good to look at, you go blind! Oh yeah, brussels lace all over the place.  Smell - dark fruits, cherries and almonds. Toffee, christmas cake, all things sweet. No hops here.  Taste - Very sweet. Lots of cherries, caramel, treacle, roasted nuts, almonds again. Long lasting flavours well after swallowing.  Mouthfeel - Medium carbonation, very syrupy, a sipper if there ever was one.  Drinkability - Not one for everyday of course, but i can see this as a great dessert beer. Probably a good for Christmas. I liken this to Orkney Skullsplitter - another favourite of mine. Trois Pistoles is a fantastic beer.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Belgian Dark Strong Ale,94
22,30,slyke,4.28,"Trois Pistoles pours nearly black as night in the center with bit of brown on the edges. A thick finger of tan head tops it off. The aroma is sweet with notes of dark fruit and a bit of nuttiness.  The dark fruits and nutty tones are back for the taste with a slight tang of alcohol.  Mouthfeel is very good with carbonation dancing on the tongue at the beginning of things, then has a nice finish that is crisp yet leaves a enough of an aftertaste to encourage you to go back for more.  This beer is quite drinkable, but with 9% abv, I wouldn't want to sip more than one or two at a sitting. Highly recommended.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Belgian Dark Strong Ale,94
22,30,Contra,4.61,"Appearance - Absolutely stunning. I've never seen a beer so suitable for photographing. Dark as night, but under the right conditions, it appears more brownish and less thick.  Smell - Sweet, smoky, and inviting.  Taste - Wow! Flavor of black cherries, roasted nuts, almonds, dates... keeps me wanting more. Absolutely awesome.  Mouthfeel - Surprisingly carbonated when sipping it. I would have expected it to have a thick, heavy body... but somehow, it's more on the medium end.  Drinkability - Heavy on the sense, no doubt. But somehow, I could drink a ton of this.  I've been dying to try more Unibroue beers ever since I first had a sample of Maudite on tap, but the price has kept me from it. Now I know what I'm missing. Absolutely amazing.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Belgian Dark Strong Ale,94
22,30,normZurawski,4.23,"Gotta say this is some tasy stuff. I think this cements Belgian Strong Dark Ale as one of my favorite styles of beer. Real deep & rich beer, but not overly heavy on the verge of syrup tasting. Nice clean beer overall.

22,30,soupyman10,4.56,"A - Two finger ehad of fairly large bubbles that disappears very fast; deep brown color that appears opaque, although that could just be the darkness  S - Highlyspicy, aromas with lots of sweet caramel as well; deep raisin scents, dried or ripe fruits  T - Gorgeous, complex flavors; first you get sweet caramelmalts; a fairly strong alcohol taste; some hops in the middle; lots of raisin  M - Seems medium bodied, but with a strange light syrupy texture as well; great after taste that coats the mouth  D - An excellent beer, although the appearance didn't really show it off as such",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Belgian Dark Strong Ale,94
22,30,PittBeerGirl,3.32,A- deep brown body with thick tan head. bubbles rise to the top.  S- Whoa intense pungent smell of alcohol and grapes. Smell is similar to a strong port wine.  T- the taste is much lighter than the smell. Grapes and dark fruit at the beginning mixed with some malt. This is followed by a slight alcohol burn. The 9% isn't hidden as well here as in unibroue's other offerings. Sugar and grapes remain long after the alcohol burn is gone.  M- high carbonation and sticky body. goes down fairly smooth.  D- this has similar drinkability to a wine. Its not bad and its definately a different experience that is worth a try.,Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Belgian Dark Strong Ale,94
22,30,PhiloPsych,3.98,"Poured from a 12 oz. bottle into a pint glass. I allowed the bottle to warm for about half an hour before opening. The bottled bubbled over as soon as I popped it open. The beer looked very dark in the bottle. As I poured it, the color was coffee brown. There was a big active head at first, but it quickly faded down to almost nothing. Aroma was strong, alcoholic, fruity, and a little bit spicy. The mouthfeel was thick and smooth. Flavor was malty, fruity, and maybe just a little bit smokey. With some sips I got a slight solvent flavor in the aftertaste; I didn't like that so much. The first time I tried this beer, I found it overpowering; I am happy to have enjoyed it this time. It paired very nicely with the barbecue beef I was eating and held up against the strong flavor of the food. It also served nicely as a dessert afterward.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Belgian Dark Strong Ale,94
22,30,cktison,4.58,"Poured from 750mL cork top bottle to goblet. A: Dark brown, clear, huge foam head that subsides quickly. Nice lacing that sticks around. Amber, golden brown, beautiful. S: Sweet & spicy, not much there, but its pleasing. T: Sharp, chocolate brownie, cherries and spice and pepper. This is very good tasting. Alcohols and esters are there M: Highly carbonated, dry, sharp. Clean finish, a bit bitter. D: Goes down too smooth for 9%! Very nice, refreshing, powerful. Great, great beer.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Belgian Dark Strong Ale,94
22,30,John_M,4.47,"This is such a lovely beer. Had on tap at Max's the other night.  The beer pours a rich dark brown/black color, with hints of red. There is very good head retention with excellent lacing. On the nose one gets Belgium spice, interwoven with cherry, port and chocolate. Heavenly. The palate replicates the nose, but has a thick, rich, viscuous mouthfeel. The beer is sweet, but not excessivly so. There's even a touch of dryness, one would assume from the hops. Well balanced and not cloying, with hints of chocolate, cherries, prunes and port. The beer finishes very nicely, with a long finish.  Considering how rich this beer is, it's remarkably drinkable. One would never guess the 9% abv., at least not while drinking it. Another excellent beer from the folks at Unibroue.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Belgian Dark Strong Ale,94
22,30,sethmeister,4.32,"12oz into snifter  Pours dark caramel brown which appears black in the glass. Fizzy and fuzzy off white head drops quickly leaving no lace.  Scent is sour and vinous: port wine grapes, tart cherries, salty with a musky barnyard (the inimitable ""horse blanket"") funk.  Taste is delicious funky sour belgian yeast, sweet brown sugar, tart cherries and plums, tannic grapes and peppery spice. If that weren't enough there is even some chocolate hiding in here, not to mention caramel.  Mouthfeel, though somewhat light, is nicely coating and a bit chewy with a slight warming at the back of the throat. Prickly carbonation.  Drinkability is excellent and the 9% ABV is well hidden.  Another excellent beer from Unibroue.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Belgian Dark Strong Ale,94
22,30,joedon,3.83,"Foil wrapped bottle poured into a tulip glass. Lots of tan foam over a very dark brown beer; too dark to see through. Aroma is of spice, sour fruit and something metallic. Big flavor starting with orange and tangerine, citrusy tartness, sour fruit and dark brown sugar. This beer tends towards sourness but in a pleasant way. Aftertaste of more fruit and malt. Could be heavier on the body. Nice mouthfeel but a bit thin for a big beer. Excellent sipping beer. Gets better as it warms up.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Belgian Dark Strong Ale,94
22,30,fank2788,4.37,"12oz bottle marked best before 10/09 poured into a goblet A careful pour, my goblet only holds 12oz, reveals a deep mahogany brown to black beer with medium clarity and a thin layer of tight bubbles on top. The smell is of sweet dark fruits raisins and plums with a touch of an oaky and peppery character along with a slight cloviness and earthy smells from the yeast. In the taste the sweet dark fruit comes through up front along with a decent alcohol flavor and port wine like complexity and warmth. There is a bit of earthy grassy flavors in the taste as well that could possibly be attributed to the yeast, I'm not sure about that though. The mouthfeel is spot on, this beer is very full but has enough carbonation to keep it active on the tongue. The beer finishes very dry with a good deal of pepper and alcoholic spice. A sipping beer but yet dangerously drinkable, it has highly complex flavors but no single flavor or aspect of this beer comes through to overwhelm the senses and make it difficult to drink. I would like to see how this changes after some time in the cellar.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Belgian Dark Strong Ale,94
22,30,rec,3.7,"Wow, I'll start by saying this is my second from Unibroue, and it's far better than my first; Maudite.  Once again the pour was impressive, despite the lack of lacing. The opaque dark brown body is definately something to appreciate.  Rich sweet malt, cloves and spice as well as mixed fruits (both dark and light) stream through in the deliciously complex aroma.  On the tounge I first register strong spice and citrus - I might also say there's even a dash of vanilla here which creates a smooth taste. It's quickly followed by alchohol warmth and the lingering taste of sweet malt. The alchohol is perhaps a little harsh, but overall it's balanced rather well.  From a mouthfeel perspective it feels a little overcarbonated and definately adds to the harshness of the drink when paired with the spice and alchohol - this is probably my only real complaint.  Due to that issue, I could hardly say it's a session beer, but I could easily knock back a couple without too much trouble. A must try for any Belgian beer fans - I dare say Unibroue is as close as you'll get to the real deal!",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Belgian Dark Strong Ale,94
22,30,MMansfield,4.06,"Picked up a single at Premier Wine & Spirits.  Appearance: Pours a dark cola like brown in my Leffe chalice. Fizzy light brown head dissolves quickly, leaves some lace.  Aroma: Sweet fruit, plums, banannas, very herbal, some cloves. Very very nice. Possible the most pleasant smelling beer I've had.  Taste: Complex spices in here. Plenty of cloves and prunes. Plenty of alchohol warmth with some underlying vanilla notes. This has winter written all over it.  Mouthfeel: A nice fizzyness, rich. A sipping beer for sure.  Final Statement: My second run at Unibroue is much more enjoyable. My palette has really developed over the last 6 months or so, and I find myself really enjoying this one. It's a sipper best suited for winter months. Tonights cold rain is welcomed as well. I think I found my beer for next christmas eve.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Belgian Dark Strong Ale,94
22,30,Shadman,4.17,"some of the local stores are carring this so maybe Sleeman's owning them isn't such a bad thing. Otherwise I'd never see the stuff 'outwest'.  beer poured a dark brown that was cloudy. Noticed translucence on the sides of the glass. I found the head and lacing to be poor for some reason, hence a few points lost for appearance.   hints of banana, spice, and some light vanilla.  spicey and fruit filled flavours in the front end. Middle is quite clove spiced and the back end has a that port wine taste as advertised. The alcohol is warming, but well disguised here.  smooth, full-bodied mouthfeel. Found it to be slightly creamy. All in all a nice beer experience.  for a beer so strong it is very nice. A brew to be sipped slowly due to the ABV and the overall sweetness, not to mention the complexity in it's flavours.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Belgian Dark Strong Ale,94
22,30,chrhowe,4.27,"Poures into a goblet a very dark, porter like with a one finger head. Smells great, like a port or barley wine? Definitely comes from the alcohol. There's also a good bit of plum as well. Taste is heavy, but good. Dark fruits like plum. Mouthfeel is really good! Very creamy. Once poured it seem to froth somewhat and become twice what it is. If that makes sense. I say because of the cream feel it definitely is quite drinkable. This beer provides a great experience! The head is pretty much perpetual until the end. As it continues to warm it continues to get creamier and more frothy. Definitely a warm feel. I really like this beer.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Belgian Dark Strong Ale,94
22,30,Georgiabeer,3.68,"Pours a dark brown thats somewhat translucent with a decent head and lacing. Aroma is pretty typical strong dark, with light toffee, fig, banana,and clove. Fairly light, though. The flavor is more of the same,somewhat subtle flavors.There are also some vanilla notes and some dark fruit flavors. The mouthfeel is creamy and medium bodied- the creaminess is delicious and makes it worth drinking.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Belgian Dark Strong Ale,94
22,30,udubdawg,4.32,"Another favorite of the style, although I usually prefer a little age on this beer. This bottle is pretty fresh, so we'll see.  Pours a dark amber/brown. Clarity is low. As with La Fin Du Monde, the yeast that has made it into the glass is no problem - it settles out quickly. I can't see the lines of bubbles rising through the beer, but there they are breaking on the surface. Without this continual bubbling at the surface the retention of the light tan head is otherwise low.  Intoxicating port-line aroma, with just a bit of spice. Fruity, lots of alcohol. This beer is going to be warming.  Tasty. Roasty but not overly so. I love this sort of orange/raisin/plum flavor. Warming alcohol. Aftertaste is fruity sweet but I also get my first hit of bitter. This makes it like a really nice orange peel lingering flavor, and anything but cloying.  Really nice mouthfeel that I nonetheless find underwhelming. Perhaps I've had too many world-class beers lately to appreciate something that is simply great? Hmm. Anyway, the initial high carbonation dies down quite quickly, but a perfect bite remains.  This particular bottle is still pretty hot and I find myself taking small sips. I won't have any trouble finishing it, but I find I still prefer it aged.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Belgian Dark Strong Ale,94
22,30,crwills,4.65,"My favourite of the Unibroue line. I've had this many times, but finally decided to review the bottle I just shared with my brother and Dad for Easter. Great stuff!  Pours a cloudy, slightly grainy reddish brown into our crystal sampling glasses. A good half-finger head, white, if poured correctly. Smell is excellent -- that famous Unibroue yeast, mixed with some fruitiness (cherry and other field berry), sourdough bread, caramel, and a hint of molasses. Taste is mildly fruity but very yeasty, especially if you pour some of the ""lees"" in with it. Very mild combination and an excellent moderate mouthfeel make this an incredibly drinkable beer. Were it not for the 9% alcohol, I would love to drink this all day! Wish it were more easily locatable in Ontario!",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Belgian Dark Strong Ale,94

22,30,MurphysIrish,3.48,"Sweet smelling and pruney tasting, this ""strong dark ale"" certainly lives up to its billing in the alcohol department but loses some points in its body (carbonation, for example, is lost and the beer seems just a little too thin on the palate). Hops are missing in all the syrupiness making it seem a bit medicinal on the aftertaste.  Still, it is lovely to look at as it pours to a caramel color that is nearly red. Most definitely an after dinner beer: I wouldn't imagine including it in a session.  Not bad, but I won't readily seek it out.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Belgian Dark Strong Ale,94
22,30,paleoplant,4.48,"The taste of this beer was fabulous. Always a fan of Unibroue products it a rare treat when i see this in a store. I can't find many strong dark ales in my neighborhood but this is a wonderful example. The smell initiailly has a strong yeast smell but it settles to hints of fruit but I can't discern what. It almost has a cedar-like scent. Flavor, mouthfeel and drinkability are all rated highly by me.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Belgian Dark Strong Ale,94
22,30,dogger6253,4.49,"Trois Pistoles flows from the bottle like a muddy river quickly forming a large, tan head that falls quickly, lots of carbonation.  I found lots of citrus in the aroma, oranges and grapefruit. Raisins and figs come into play as well. I also noted a cashew smell alongside a grainy, peppery scent I couldn't pin down for sure.  The taste is impressive, massive complexity. Malty and yeasty sweetness hit you for sure, with oranges, cherries and almonds taking the floor soon after. There is a slight hops presence. Hinted in the alcohol are the dark fruits, raisins, figs, and licorice. Also bits of caramel and molasses, all in perfect balance.  Highly carbonated and medium bodied, coats the tongue in pleasant way. Highly tasty, but high alcohol and high carbonation make it hard for me to drink a lot in a sitting.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Belgian Dark Strong Ale,94
22,30,Redwood21,3.53,"The head on this beer when poured is immense. Its a dark colored beer, with a tan color head. The smell is of faint fruit. the taste confirms this. I bought a 4 pack a couple of months ago, and am just now revisitng this beer. I do not know if the age has dulled the intensity or not, but i enjoy this beer more now than i remember. I could have also just changed taste, but holding one back for a while might be worth trying. The flavors are layered, but im not sensative enough to figure out what they all are. it is a great beer considering the strength and easy to enjoy. I would suggest giving ths beer a try.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Belgian Dark Strong Ale,94
22,30,geexploitation,4.6,"Pours very dark, pretty much black, with only the slightest russet highlights poking through at the edges. Initially the head is thick and off-white, but it fades quickly and leaves little lacing. Aroma is thick with spices and fruits: coriander, anise, maybe some cardamom(?), dried dates. On the palate, a sharp, lightly sweet blast of fruits hits first off, along with a blast of juicy carbonation. Sweet, smooth malts kick up at the mid-palate, then the spices come out before things dry out a bit toward the finish. A final flash of fruit crops up at the very end, then there's a long, dry, buzzy finish that lasts for 30 seconds or so. Mouthfeel is medium bodied, with big carbonation -- it's pleasingly un-syrupy and un-chewy. Overall, this is a fabulous strong dark ale -- one of the best, in my opinion. Great spicing, very good fruit character, and that wonderful Belgian sweet-but-dry character. Wonderful.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Belgian Dark Strong Ale,94
22,30,Shiredave,4.28,"Best before date: 3-09 - corked bottle. A huge frothy head of tan foam billows above a deep, mohagony brown liguid. Backlighting shows effusive streams of carbonation supporting an ever present cap of Guinness-like foam that sheets the glass in lace. Big Dubbel aromas of plums, chocolate and cherries. Very sweet scents of candy sugar and hints of smoke or burning coco. Wonderfull yeasty / fruity smells. The flavors are multi layered and mirror the aromas. Lush and full bodied up front, it sort of "" lightens "" midway through and allows the roasted grain and hop bitterness to come forward. Chocolate covered cherries steeped in brandy with a great dry, warmly bitter aftertaste. Excellent after dinner or dessert beer, with rich game or roasted red meat. Hell - this would be great with sloppy joes and oreo cookies!",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Belgian Dark Strong Ale,94

Taste is spicy, some ripe fruitiness is apparent with quite an alcohol bite. The 9% ABV in this beer is pretty apparent, but is pleasant and warming. Medium body and carbonation make the mouthfeel very nice.  Strong is definitely an apt name for this beer, but it is very enjoyable. I definitely wouldn't recommend drinking many of these in one night, unless you want to be on your ass. Recommended.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Belgian Dark Strong Ale,94
22,30,wcudwight,4.25,"Pours a dark brown almost black with some deep purple hues when held up to the light. Nice 3 finger tan head receded quickly to near nothing. Spotty drippy wet lacing. Nice earthy spicy alcoholic aroma. Very pleasent in the nose. Caramel, brown sugar, molassas and dark ripe fruits dominate the flavors. The alcohol gives it kind of a smooth spicy finish. Or it may be the hops. Either way it has a nice pleasent lasting finish that lingers until the next sip. Nice smooth medium bodied mouthfeel. The medium body lends to a more drinkable beer than some others of it's style. This is a great beer that I recommend. Best before 9/8/2008.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Belgian Dark Strong Ale,94

Great brewery that Unibroue.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Belgian Dark Strong Ale,94
22,30,Absumaster,4.27,"This beer is dark brown with a small head and no visible carbonation.  Smell is malty and roasted with some caramel notes. The yeast give this beer a meaty, stock-like smell which fits the beer.  Taste is mild burned and roasted, with some chocolate. The burned malts give the beer a nice maltbitter, which is not sharp. The body of the beer is medium, which makes the malt and roast taste come out really good. I think I also taste the use of coloring agents. To round things of, hops are present on the background and add an extra dimension.  This is truly one of the best beers I have tasted from Unibroue. The other beers appear to use the same yeast, which basically give all beers the same yeast profile. I did not taste any of these flavors in this beer.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Belgian Dark Strong Ale,94

Beautiful looking dark beer, with a fomay tan head that, although small, lasts almost forever. The complex smell starts with what I like to call Unibroue yeast, being a smell that is on almost all of their beers, although I am not sure it is really from yeasts. This is followed by a rich malt smell, a mixture of caramels, chocolate, roasting bread and alcohol. Full-bodied, it has a rich taste that includes the same caramel, bittersweet chocolate, warming alcohol and a dry finish that leaves you wanting more... Ridiculously easy to drink, another Unibroue masterpiece. Will be getting a lot of this.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Belgian Dark Strong Ale,94
22,30,NEhophead,4.35,"12 fl oz brown bottle; served in an oversized wine glass. Best before 11.17.2008.  Murky, deep maple in color. Creamy, carbonation-filled tan head that lines the wine glass' rim and leaves a whispy sheet. Ridged, delicate lacing recedes as the glass comes to rest.  Bright, ripe fruit; slightly tart but fresh in aroma: apple, grapefruit, lemon. Mildly creamy chocolate undertones. Faint hints of corriander.  Creamy chocolate and caramel-tinged malt character that doesn't touch upon richness. Ripe fruity esters bring a nice balance to the creamy qualities: apple, grape, orange, and grapefruit. An underlying spice of corriander and clove spike at the finish.  Medium in body; creamy, earthen, but light as a result of the ripe fruit flavors. Well rounded and balanced in texture.  Good balance in flavor and mouthfeel. The 9% abv is hardly noticed. Probably my favorite Unibroue offering to date.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Belgian Dark Strong Ale,94
22,30,MCDuhamel,3.97,"Poured from a 12 ounce bottle into a Westmalle chalice, at fridge temperature.  A: Poured a nice, dark ruby to brown with large bubbles and active carbonation. Head developed quickly into a tight, 1 inch cap, but then faded quickly to a ring around the chalice. No lacing to speak of.  S: Aroma is of raisins, dried fruit, toffee and the characteristic Unibroue house yeast. Some clovelike notes.  T: Fruity first presentation yielding to a dried fruit and burnt sugar finish. Carbonation, surprisingly, is not really noticeable despite its presence in the appearance. Finish lingers in the center of the tongue in a rather pleasant way.  M: Light to medium mouthfeel.  D: Highly drinkable. The alcohol content is undetectable, and the light body and smooth flavor make it a quick glass.  Overall: This is a very good interpretation of a Belgian-style dark ale. I prefer the La Fin du Monde, but this is a very nice beer. I won't weigh in on the debate as to whether this is a strong dubbel, a quad, or a ""strong dark ale,"" mostly because I don't think it matters.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Belgian Dark Strong Ale,94
22,30,BuckSpin,4.13,"Presentation: 12oz conditioned bottle, cellared for 9 months, in a tulip glass.  A noisy lil' bottle. When the cap was popped it slowly vented and the crackle of newfound life via carbonation was very audible. Poured crisp, noisily, the dull light mocha stained head crackling with life, filled with tight, crisp bubbles and foam. I had to pour slowly to prevent the head from overpowering the glass, still the head was a solid fat finger but didn't lace or linger more than a few minutes. Its almost champagne like as a volcanic-like eruption of glass bottom bubbles rises thru the most intense, claret-ruby stained cherry stained mahoghany, slightly warm in hue as well as slightly hazy.  The nose is wonderfully fruited - cherry, currant, warm raisins, with a cracker/biscuit quality just underneath. The malts are subtle, playing a supporting role to the fruits. As the bottle is emptied there is some nice tannins, fall leaves and a wisp of blond coffee as well as some ripe banana.  Like most of the genre, there is a wonderful spice quality on the tongue as you first sip. Clove is most noticable, light pepper, a pleasing bittersweetness. The spiciness withdraws on the pallete as the tastes meld, malts becoming more apparent but softly. The finish is warming as the alcohol rises, well masked until now. More sweet than bitter to say its bittersweet, the finish is nice as the banana quality is more noticable, leaving a coating behind that is pleasing to the tongue, yet not filmy, and a nice tingle on the teeth.  This is a very good example of the genre, and another great offering of the Belgian style ales from Unibroue. I have yet to have any I did enjoy very much, and would definitely drink this again as well as recommend it. It should pair well with about any red blooded meat based meal, as well as a strong, creamy cheese like a good gorgonzola.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Belgian Dark Strong Ale,94
22,30,BlindPig,4,"A- Dark brown body with a tan head. S- Light toffee, hints of spice, some dryer hops, and a hint of yeast. T- Tad hint of alcohol comes through. There is a balance of malts (caramel and toffee), and dry hops. It leaves your mouth pretty dry and also leaves a medium bitterness in the aftertaste. M- Medium body with medium carbonation. D- Very complex and a great balance to this brew. It is one of my favorites from them.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Belgian Dark Strong Ale,94
22,30,rattech,4.4,"Poured into a Trois Pistoles goblet, a beer I have had many times.  Appearance: A rich dark brown, dark enough so I cannot see through it with a gleam of red. A rich 1 inch formed at the top of the beer that slowly begins to subside.  Smell: A very natural sweet smell comes off of it, definite yeastiness with a touch of roasted malt.  Taste: Sweet with a touch of tartness. There is some bitterness in the beer but it not the first thing I taste. This beer has a wonderful balance; there is a good hint of roasted malt with a tiny bit of alcohol.  Mouthfeel: Thick, mild carbonation. I enjoy it.  Drinkability: The alcohol makes this beer unsessionable and it is heavy enough where drinking more then one in an evening starts to become a chore. Finishing the first one is quite easy.  This is one of my favorite beers, the one that really got me into trying Belgian beer.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Belgian Dark Strong Ale,94
22,30,RidiculedDisplay,4.07,"Trois Pistoles is, arguably, the beer that got me into craft beer (well, that and maybe Shakespeare Stout by Rogue, as I drank both in the same day some years ago. However, I drank Trois Pistoles first :D). That being said, I thought I owed it a review, and besides, it's been some time since I've had one.  Appearance: The body is an eighth-finger slightly tan foam or so. The lacing, unfortunately, is not that impressive nor existent, just sheets of tan foam that slide down the class back to the body after swirling. Body makes up for the lacing slightly - an above-average super dark brown, bordering on a light stout color with amber brown bordering.  Smell: Wow, I remember why I was so turned on by this beer. Trois Pistoles maintains an incredible amount of fruity esterness appropriate to Belgians, while, at the same time, being quite refined about the whole affair. The individual esters do not pronounce themselves overly, but maintain a great sense of balance with simultaneous strength. This balanced but simultaneously individually nuanced quality is second only, for Belgian SDA's, to Brasserie des Rocs Triple Imperiale, in my opinion. A corky woodiness and yeasty funk on the front end. Over ripe banana, apples, figs, port, and candy sugar. Blueberries, strawberries, raspberries. Thick sundae caramel. Great.  Taste: Corkiness again, banana, blueberries, slight alcohol nose, apples, kiwi, yeast, bread, crackers, slight fig and prune. Some candy sugar. Not quite as big as the nose, but still very nice.  Mouthfeel: Over carbonated and even a little watery, in my opinion. However, it has a nice astringency that imparts the idea of a big Belgian brew well.  Drinkability: Trois Pistoles is an excellent example of the BDA style that has a tremendous amount of complexity. That being said, it does a fantastic job at hiding that complexity when you want it to, and you could drink it for hours on end if not for the ABV. An achievement.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Belgian Dark Strong Ale,94
22,30,ClockworkOrange,4.32,"Poured from a 750ml bottle into my Duvel tulip glass. Appears a dark mahogany brown with a huge two fingers of dense light tan head. Aromas of sweet dried fruits, possibly apricots and caramel malt. Tastes of spicy dried cherry, sweet caramel malts, slight citrus and melon notes. Medium to full bodied with moderate carbonation. Quite refreshing, tasty and very drinkable, but the 9% could sneak up on you. Excellent.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Belgian Dark Strong Ale,94
22,30,TheSarge,4.06,"Pours with a vast amount of CO2. Produces a beautiful light tan head that sticks around forever. The body is dark amner in color. Gives off aromas of fresh baked bread. Slight hints of sweet molasses and bubble gum. This has a sweet pretzel kind of taste to it, without the salt. Feels a little warm and inviting too. This is an outstanding beer. One of the best I've had from Unibroue.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Belgian Dark Strong Ale,94
22,30,hckyfn9999,4.07,"Pours a very dark brown with some reddish hues into a snifter. There is a nice tan head that has decent retention. Aroma is of cocoa, raisins, bananas, yeast, spice, brown sugar, and alcohol with the taste more of the same. Mouthfeel is a little more thin than I want from this beer, although this may lend to its drinkability. Pretty solid beer.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Belgian Dark Strong Ale,94
22,30,jim102864,4.32,"I enjoyed this on tap so I thought I'd give it a try from a 750ml bottle. I wasn't disappointed. A rush of ripe fruit as I removed the cork. Even a short-lived wispy cloud eminates from the bottle...very spooky. Poured this into my Duvel tulip glass. The appearance was deep burgandy; a suprising level of carbonation in the head which is not viscous and disappears shortly after your first few sips. The aroma is fruity from raisens, plumbs, dried apricots. Licorice too. Undertones of dates, raisens in the initial taste with carbonation in the finish...not a bad thing but unexpected. Thick, chewy yet smooth mouthfeel. This is a very drinkable Belgian.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Belgian Dark Strong Ale,94
22,30,meadhead,4.25,good solidly good! Almost champagne - port wine feel to the traditional Belgian yeast phenomena- dark plum fig spice with an effervescence: unique. (Unibroue-ish)  but seriously...  Pours dark purple brownish with a well hidden ABV and a complex savory taste  Good stuff.,Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Belgian Dark Strong Ale,94
22,30,jmbranum,4.48,"Beautiful dark brownish-black beer with a massive slightly tan very dense head.  The aroma is on the malty side, fairly subtle but nice.  The flavor is surprising. The 9% alcoholic warmth is there but not overpowering. Much more drinkable than I expected and the mouthfeel is quite pleasant.  Very well-balanced match of malt with a tiny bit of spices and a little bit of tang that fits its style of a Belgian dark ale.  On the negative, this beer was almost too-balanced. I kinda wished it had a bit more umph in the flavor department with some flavor characteristics kicking it up a notch or two.  Overall this is a nice smooth drinking strong ale. Definitely worth giving it a try.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Belgian Dark Strong Ale,94
22,30,AustinSommelier,5,"Purchased a 12 oz bottle at GrapeVine Market in Austin, TX. As a dark Belgian fanatic, this is easily my favorite beer. I won't bore w/ details, since that's already been done many times over. All I'll say is it has an incredibly complex flavor profile, it's very smooth, and can be enjoyed again & again w/o getting boring.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Belgian Dark Strong Ale,94
22,30,RunawayJim,4.3,"Poured a 12 oz bottle into a pint glass (that's all i got). The head on this beer is huge and it sticks around for a bit. While pouring I get some fruity aromas from the enormous head. Also get a little champagne-like scents coming through after head settles a bit. Can't wait for the taste. Pours a dark reddish brown color with a tan head.  First sip feels like champagne with lots of carbonation, but yet not too much. Taste has a bit of a winey champagney flavor to it. Definitely notice some white grape in there. There is no noticeable taste of alcohol for a 9% ABV beer. The flavor is fruity most of the way, still with that taste of champagne grapes. As I get about halfway through, the taste turns a bit more bitter and feels a bit thicker in the mouth, almost syrupy. Carbonation is still going strong, head almost non-existent. Very little lacing. Still getting that champagney/grapey scent. About 2/3 of the way down, the alcohol starts to hit, but it's still not noticeable in the taste. It also starts to feel a bit heavier than the average beer. Some malt flavors start to come through near the end, but the lingering flavor is still the slight flavor of champagne.  It's a quite drinkable beer, although I'm giving it a bit of a hit there compared to the other scores mainly because it does start to feel quite heavy towards the end. Can't drink more than one of these in a session, but that in no way makes it a bad beer. This is truly an excellent beer. I'm glad I have another waiting for me for a future date.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Belgian Dark Strong Ale,94
22,30,Torchiest,4.92,"Poured a 12oz bottle into a Unibroue goblet.  Deep mahogany color, a solid inch of pale tan head which slowly collapsed.  Smells absolutely fantastic, dark sweet fruit with noticeable maltiness.  Quite sweet, plum and other fruit all over the place, alcohol is nice and warming, but not overbearing for a 9% beer. Mild bitterness, finishes estery and tasting like port.  Smooth, almost creamy, full of carbonation with keeps it from feeling heavy as it slides through the mouth effortlessly.  Absolutely delicious, and perhaps my favorite beer ever. I'd drink it all the time if I could, but it's strong and a little on the expensive side.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Belgian Dark Strong Ale,94
22,30,soulgrowl,4.1,"Appearance: This is dark and opaque, but having just drank a Sam Adams Triple Bock, it just doesn't seem THAT dark and opaque. Chocolatey blackish brown. Tall, foamy beige-tan head with good retention.  Smell: Gingerbread, bubble gum, baked apples, cassis, bready yeast, citric notes, brown sugar. Nice.  Taste: Mmm, good stuff. Berry-like fruity sweetness is the first thing I notice. Cola notes are also present, with a light citric edge, vaguely cinnamony or clovey spice, and a drop of vanilla. Tangy and a little bit funky from the yeast. Alcohol is very well-covered. Overall, sort of reminiscent of a rum and coke.  Mouthfeel: Soft and silky, with a medium body and moderate carbonation.  Drinkability: A unique, interesting, and tasty beer. Very drinkable despite the strength.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Belgian Dark Strong Ale,94
22,30,flexabull,4.13,"Pours a dark brownish amber color, and with what I am finding out is an unofficial trademark of Unibroue, that HUGE head!  Smells like sweet baked apples. And a touch of alcohol.  Flavor is surprisingly on the light side to me. But still quite tasty. A crisp apple flavor is the first thing I notice, the beer then settles into a creamy and dry finish. Quite nice.  Mouthfeel is good, nice carbonation and finish.  Drinkable is excellent. Unibroue scores again. I have yet to have a beer from them that wasn't good.  Thanks for these Wasatch!",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Belgian Dark Strong Ale,94
22,30,SaucyA,4.22,"Wow.  I say it after every sip of this complex, wonderful beer.  It's a VERY dark amber brown, with a heavy white head that retains throughout the entire glass. Only during the last few sips did the head even think about dissapating.  It smells wonderful, like Unibroue yeast, alcohol, caramel malts, and a major fruity overtone.  It's an absolutely superb taste that can't be beaten. Warm, malty, sweet, fruity, chocolatey, alcohol, yeast, light hops... I can't even begin to describe all the tastes happening with every sip. It's a fantastic beer that must be experienced.  It's medium body with heavy carbonation... which helps to hide the high abv. I seriously have a hard time believing it's so strong.  I would no doubt revisit this offering from Unibroue. It just can't be beat. It goes down easy, and is just... amazing.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Belgian Dark Strong Ale,94
22,30,tommy78,4.23,"Like a previous reviewer, brought a four pack from Quebec and poured it into a Trois Pistoles glass. A very dark, brown colour with serious head filled the glass. The head quickly dissolved, but it revealed an intense, yeast aroma. I also noticed a slight odor of fruit. The taste is is my favorite: quick and to the point. The taste of malt, fruit, and spices did not hang around in my mouth as some other Belgian types tend to do. It left a sweet taste on the palate. This beer goes well with any poultry-based dinners. One of my favorites from Unibroue.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Belgian Dark Strong Ale,94
22,30,atsprings,4.62,"Had this for the first time the other night at Flying Saucer. had a decent sized head that lasted a good while in the goblet they provided. Very easy to drink for a beer that strong. Had a very complex taste, fruit and raisins. Over all, very enjoyable. A little pricey, but for complex beers such as this, it's to be expected.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Belgian Dark Strong Ale,94

An outstanding strong warming dark ale.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Belgian Dark Strong Ale,94
22,30,alexskovan,4,"Poured hazy dark brown (deep amber if you hold it up to the light) with the usual gigantic Unibroue head. Aroma was yeasty, rich, ripe, funky, citrus underneath, and possibly unappealing, though you have to keep on inhaling while you try to make up your mind. Taste was bready and deep, toasted malt with a caramel middle and citrus finish.  Unibroue wants to drive me crazy. They brew strong, complex, challenging beer, that I still don't know if I LIKE.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Belgian Dark Strong Ale,94
22,30,Greenfloyd,3.85,"As usual, incredible artwork on the bottle from Unibroue. This beer poured into a snifter with a menacing dark raisin color, topped off with a foamy light cola colored head. This beer emanated smells of yeast, currant, and subtle alcohol tones. The flavor was a malty dark fruit combo, that drifts into a mild finish of spice. Medium bodied at best, but not a session type beer. Paired great with an assortment of strong flavored cheeses and fresh figs (not the newtons)...Enjoy",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Belgian Dark Strong Ale,94
22,30,rkuhnel,4.2,"From the Northcoast Coop here in Eureka, CA. I paid $6.49 for a 750 ml bottle corked & caged. It poured an opaque and cloudy brown with large off-white head that diminished slowly with average lacing. The nose was of burnt caramel with overtones of plum and berries. Flavors were simply explosive in the mouth and were sweet malts, caramel, citrus like touches of oranges and grapefruits, grapes, tantalizing spices, berries and chocolate. Mouthfeel was smooth and rich. Finish was great with just the slightest hoppy and dry bitterness. If it didnt cost quite so much I would drink this all the time",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Belgian Dark Strong Ale,94
22,30,eberkman,4.25,"Poured a dark reddish-brown with golden highlights, producing a one-finger tan head that dissipated fairly quickly, but left a tiny film of head floating like an island on the surface.  The smell was of sweet spices and alcohol, but with some odd but very pleasing leathery notes as well.  It tasted of dark, ripe fruits -- figs, raisins, prunes -- with a very apparent pepperiness and hints of a sort of licorice or anise. Seemed almost like spice cake at times, but with a little bit of a bite at the end. The alcohol was pretty apparent in a pleasant way. Kind of a medicinal finish, but a warming one at that.  The mouthfeel was crisp, carbonated and full-bodied. Pretty drinkable for such a high-alcohol beer.  I enjoyed this, as I've enjoyed just about everything from Unibroue. I may have even enjoyed this one more. A great strong dark ale at a great price. $6.49 at TJs for a wonderful evening. Can't beat that.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Belgian Dark Strong Ale,94
22,30,Drew966,4.12,"Trois Pistoles pours a very dark brown with an off white head that fades to a circle around the edge quickly from a brown 12 ounce bottle. The aroma is ripe dark fruit and is quite good. Dark fruit is dominant in the flavor, but there is defintely carmel that is noticeable too. Definitely worth a try.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Belgian Dark Strong Ale,94
22,30,mattpetti,4.28,"4/8/06 from notes  A:Deep brown with red highlights. Has a large, fluffy off white head that displaces incredible resilience throughout my entire drinking experience.  S: Forward fruit(grape, berries, plum), yeast, slight alcohol, maybe anise....cocao?  T/M/D: Tastes is up front fruit, with what i think is unibroue's unique yeast flavor, subtle clensing hops in the finish. It is dry with ample sharp carbonation keeping your tongue going nuts. High abv is disturbingly hidden. The complexity of this beer is amazing and almost too much for the palate to handle. Nevertheless it is an amazing brew and statement that great belgian beers can be made outside the country.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Belgian Dark Strong Ale,94
22,30,vickersspitfire,4.01,"I poured this ale into a snifter, it came out a very nice dark amber that almost looked black - even when held up to the light.this was nicely contrasted by lovely light tan head and very little lacing. Trois Pistoles has a sweet slightly woody smell to it and goes down pretty smooth with a mild alcohol after taste. It doesn't have a drisp mouthfeel to it but it is refreshing and has a warming feel to it.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Belgian Dark Strong Ale,94
22,30,BobThomas,1.84,"Bottle pours dark almost reddish brown. Pretty highly carbonated.  Smells, fruity, but overwhelmingly like chewable vitamins.  The initial taste on the front of the palate starts off like a good belgian style ale, but as it goes to the middle and back of the palate, the chewable vitamin flavor is again overwhelming. What is that?  Feels fairly heavy although bubbly in mouth. Finishes with a dry with a chalky vitamin flavor. A most perplexing beer, but I had trouble finishing my glass, and would not seek to try again. I keep thinking my bottle went bad, but i really don't think that's the case.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Belgian Dark Strong Ale,94
22,30,Bitterbill,3.9,"Poured from 12oz bottle, uh, whoa there! After a couple of seconds, it shot out of the bottle like crazy but I didn't lose much. ;^)  The colour is a dark brown with, um, a huge head of foam that shrank slowly throughout the session leaving a fine broken layer with lots of lacing.  The smell is partly dark fruit(plum), yeast, and sweet malt that quite pleasant to the nose.  The taste is quite fruity up front, the plum I mentioned, a bit of banana, then there's some clove moving in with some nice yeasty flavour. Nice. The alcohol is noticeable but not objectionable and I get a nice tart smack right at the finish. A very nice sipper to have, for sure.  Bottom line: A nice tasty example of the style that does pack some punch so sip on it at your leisure. ;^)  Thanks go out to Wasatch for providing this!",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Belgian Dark Strong Ale,94
22,30,Musky,3.91,"Lots of bubbles with this one, had it sitting in the fridge about 2 months and when it was opened the beer acted like a volcano. A nice deep red color this beer is with an aroma of vienna malt and alcohol. Being bottle conditioned it pours much like one of my homebrews, a little yeast sediment on the bottom. Very tingle on tongue with a high carbonation. Has a dry finish with hints of fruit, a complex beer all in all.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Belgian Dark Strong Ale,94
22,30,techdiver,4.92,"Pours a deep dense crimson that looks black unless held to light. In daylight shows more as a crimson brown. Substantial head that dissipates slowly, leaving a quarter inch cap.  Raisins and figs almost overwhelm the malt, just a great smelling brew.  Taste is complex, fruity, smooth, delicious; with a finish like a fine dessert wine.  Smooth and creamy in the mouth, not a lot of carbonation.  Frighteningly drinkable for the alcohol content.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Belgian Dark Strong Ale,94
22,30,Globetrotter,4.14,"Purchased in August at the Rosslyn, VA Whole Foods Market, I cellared this baby until Christmas afternoon. Special beer for a special occasion. Tall corked 750ml brown bottle features an oval silver and black label featuring a pegasus soaring through a dark and stormy sky above some abbey or church. No useful ingredient information. Best before 1/2/09, I opened it on 12/25/06.  Pours a cloudy dark burgundy, with murky orange-amber emerging when held up to very bright light. The head is two fingers high and slightly purplish beige, settling a wee bit too quickly and quite evenly, generating no lace, contour or stickiness at all. The nose is strong and lovely, of plumbs and yeast, plus a bit of indeterminate spice. The mouth is a bit too light, and a bit too well carbonated. The tongue is bombarded with taste sensations, full of fruit and spice. There are no sour notes, neither is it sweet. Rather, the fruit and spice blend nicely and smoothly, complemented by a very subdued hops presence. Coriander determines the aftertaste, which lingers nice and long. A good, solid, drinkable brew worth seeking out. I expected my world to be shaken, but will settle for a very pleasant experience.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Belgian Dark Strong Ale,94

The carbonation seems pretty energetic, and the nose is of berries and a little malt. Mouthfeel is tingly and round, flavor is of grapes, blackberries, and malt. There's a definite warming effect from the 9% alcohol by volume. Aftertaste is light and fruity, and just the tiniest bit tannic.

M: Good carbonation, not too much, smooth and creamy, leaves a lingering taste/feeling like sherry or port.  D: Nice in small amounts, slightly too strong to drink too many.

However, in the beer store I was at today, the only items of interest were this and its stable mate La Fin Du Monde.  As I predicted, there was absolutely no surprise with this beer at all. I expected it to be superb and it is. This is a really fine Belgian Strong Dark Ale and I have to award top marks for drinkability.  If I had to be picky, I would say the mouthfeel is just fractionally short by a hair, but that's probably why I'm throwing it down my neck like there's no tomorrow.

Deep, expressive nose of mixed ripe and dried fruits, with some sweet malt, a whiff of nutmeg, and even some oxidative notes.  Carbonation level is high, giving the body fullness but also making it lively on the tongue. Acetic acid also is there. Flavor profile is a bit exotic, with grapy/berry fruitiness, spice, and molasses. Thins out on the smooth and moderately brief finish.

Lots of dark fruits [plums, raisins, figs, dark cherry] and malt. Nice light spices. Alcohol at the back end. Nicely warming. Somewhat winey.  Mouthfeel is medium bodied and wonderfully cleansing.

Huge, four-finger, foamy, light tan head faded to nice swirls of lace with a thick ring around the edge of the glass. Large chunks of spotty lacing.  Smell was intense. Yeasty and fruity (alcohol soaked raisins and dates) with a musty/oakiness.  Taste was rich, sweet and fruity. Malty and spicy with hints of apples, pears and dried fruits. Clean finish that was both sweet and slightly dry - similar to port wine. Alcohol was somewhat noticeable up front and slightly more so in the finish.  Mouthfeel was a bit thinner than expected and slightly overcarbonated initially (but the beer settled down later). Very smooth drinking overall.

Lovely in appearance, the head is a mix between off white and tan. The dark body is cloudy in appearance, with no transparency.  Smell: Coriander, spices, yeast, some barnyard and phenols emerge.  Taste & mouthfeel: First thing to hit your tongue is carbonation. Followed by a strong presence of alcohol. The beer is rounded out with a delicate medly of spices, yeast, and fruits. Some hop character lingers in a toasted malt background. Coriander, apples, orange peels, a touch of chocolate covered berries. Very nice. and the flavours linger.  Drinkability: One of those beers that I'd save for a nice special occassion, and open up a bomber between friends. For now the 12 oz version was enough for me. A good solid beer, certainly along the lines I expect from Unibroue.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Belgian Dark Strong Ale,94
22,30,Budlum,4.42,"Pouring this ale produces huge amounts of foamy, tan head. The head is retained very nicely leaving a quarter inch layer on top of the beer. The body is a deep mahogany with black and red colors showing when held to light.  The nose of this ale starts off very fruity with apples, pears and sweet melon. A peppery spice mixes with a black licorice smell to add some deeper complexity. Alcohol content is noticeable but not by much. Wonderfully fresh and complex.  Much like the smell, this ale presents a myriad of fruit flavors at the start of a sip. Apples, pears, blood oranges and watermelon flavors are all represented well. The spice flavor of this beer is strong with black pepper and coriander. A delicious, roasted malt quality adds just the right amount of sweetness. The finish is long with the classic Unibroue yeast flavor.  Mouthfeel is nicely carbonated, rich in texture and slightly creamy.  Drinkability is excellent. This ale is deliciously balanced in flavor and presentation. Sessionability is limited only by the ABV.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Belgian Dark Strong Ale,94
22,30,JOaikido,3.47,"341 ml bottle.  A- Foamy beige head of large bubbles. Very dark red-brown colour, like an especially dark cola with a purple tinge. Head decreases rapidly leaving very little of anything.  S- Musty fruit. Malt. Touch of roasted aroma.  T- Dried fruit (prunes). Spices, including some anise. Alcohol character present but not overwhelming considering the ABV. Dlight bitter hops aftertaste.  MF- Full bodied. Alcohol heat noticeable. Carbonation OK.  D- Goes down smoothly for such a high ABV beer, but I find some of its character a little odd.  I didn't like this the first time I had it years ago. Despite the fact that I have grown to like dark beers and strong ales, this one still doesn't do it for me. Not worth the relatively high price.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Belgian Dark Strong Ale,94
22,30,BeerSox,4.75,"12oz bottle into snifter.  Extremely deep ruby red that is almost black and opaque. Ruby edges. A fizzy light tan head evaporates to a thin cap and a thin rim along the glass. Stringy lacing along the glass.  Strong berry aromas along with warming alcohol. There isn't much else to the aroma, but it's very nice.  Dark fruit along with soft alcohol flavors. A bit of creaminess in the aftertaste along with the drying alcohol. Phenols are minimal. Medium body with a considerable amount of carbonation that lends a little bite. It's not a strech to say that this tastes similar to wine. Suprisingly clean finish considering the amount of alcohol, but still a little bit of drying quality to it.  Bit more of a fruitier and sweeter variety of a Belgian Strong Dark Ale from Unibroue, and still enjoyable.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Belgian Dark Strong Ale,94
22,30,InsolublePancake,3.86,"A- Pours a very dark brown into my oversized wine glass. Huge, light tan-colored head forms and then diminishes to about half an inch, where it stays forever. Tons of bubbles rise rapidly throughout the beer.  S- Very vinous with a tart, white wine-like aroma. Some bright citrus aromas are also present.  T- Much sweeter than the nose would indicate. Sweet dark fruits abound (raisins, dates, figs) with a ginger-like spiciness also in the mix. A slight bitterness appears on the finish but is gone in a flash. Alcohol is not really perceptible in the taste, but is evident on the finish with a little bit of a ""sinus clearing"" quality.  M- Medium-full body and nicely carbonated. Also has a syrupy quality that leaves the tongue feeling coated even after the beer is gone. High marks here.  D- Too rich and alcoholic to be overly drinkable. Finishing the whole 750 ml bottle may be a stretch, but I'm not going anywhere tonight, so I think I can manage. It would definitely be better to split a bottle of this, though.  Definitely a good ale from Unibroue. Perhaps not as complex as some other versions I've had (including its sibling Maudite), but very nice nonetheless.

Aromas of spicy molasses  sweet yet the alcohol is trying to bust through.  A rich deep sweetness consumes my tongue, smooth and silky. The carbonation cleanses the tongue as it rolls on through.

Huge almost overflowing tan head settles within a minute or so to a solid 1/4"".  Complex smells of ripe, dark fruits. Raisins and sweet doughy bread. Really smells like you should eat this stuff.  Taste every bit as delicious as the smells.  Creamy mouthfeel with an excellent finish. Crisper finish than expected.  Only bitter and dry enough to force you to raise the glass again. Unbelievable drinkability for the content of alochol. Hands down my favorite accessable dark Belgian. Can't say enough about this beer.

22,30,thelagerheads,4,"$7.99 for a mixed 6 12 oz bottle Good Time Party Store Northville, MI  Three pistols eh? Maybe that's not what it means and why would it? But I'm sticking with my ignorant observation in lieu of something more intelligent and learned sounding. All of the Unibroue selections that I have tasted make me think of hefeweizen to some extent and this one is no exception. Normally I say that with a thumb downturned, a nose upturned(as if!) and no glory whatsoever but not this time. Not my favorite type of beer but this is quality like all of their brews are. There's a bockish caramel-wort taste and a little licorice? Root? Something with a black hand grabbing the tongue and stretching it to places unknown. There are minor flotilla which seem to be little more than garnish, but hell maybe they are giving off all the taste. Anyway lots of leafy and minty essence here. Almost like an icy hot peppermint stick with a candy bar rhythm jumping through a mist of alcohol sprinkler and sliding all the way to the edges of the boneyard invigorating even the dead.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Belgian Dark Strong Ale,94

For the high alcohol content this is a very good beer.  ¡Salud!",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Belgian Dark Strong Ale,94
22,30,Grundle20,4.13,"Appearance: Black as night. A minor head with a lack of retention.  Smell: Prodominantly floral ester with underlying caramel malt notes. Pretty mild but pleasant none the less.  Taste and Mouthfeel: Wow! I was not expecting that. This beer is incredibly complex. Starts off with strong banana bready malt character then travels on to slight caramel notes and finishes with the most fantastic kick of honey suckle. It's nice and smooth with the exception of a pretty aggressive carbonated bitterness in the fore. My only qualm is I wish there was less of an aftertaste.  Drinkability: I'm not one to give darker beers a good rating here simply because they usually are session or dinner beers to me, but this beer has shattered that mold. Incredible and surprising tastes have absolutely sold me on this beer and heres the best part, you can't taste a bit of the alcohol.  Bottom Line: Thus far this is the best beer I have had from Unibroue which is saying a lot. If you haven't checked this one out yet please do. A fantastic interpretation of the style.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Belgian Dark Strong Ale,94

Great, thick head that lasts and lasts, even in a wide glass like I used.  S - Didn't get the brandied raisins that others had, but plenty of malty notes in there, along with just hint a of sourness.  T - Just gorgeous. Everything that I like about Belgian dark ales is here from the malts to the spices and herbal flavours. Unbelievably smooth, and the 9% alcohol is very understated.  M - Thick and creamy. I wouldn't have minded just a touch more effervescence, but that's more personal taste.  D - Highly drinkable, as the alcohol flavour is so understated. It soon caught up to me though, so two of these would be plenty.

22,30,RichThatchr,3.65,"I picked this up at Whole Foods this evening as I was looking for something new and this was suggested to me as most like the dubbel-style. I was thinking of my current favorite of this style, the Westmalle Dubbel, which needs no introduction to the BA.  I poured the tall black bottle into my 50cl glass after chilling it for a 1/2 hour and a great spongy head appeared and settled down easily. The first impression I got from the smell was that of a famous Irish ale with coffee and chocolate nuances eminating from the heavy glass.  My first taste was simply duplicating what I had inhaled, but there was a thin body of burnt malts and funky raisins. Okay, so I kept drinking it to gather something else from it. After the ale warmed up, it seemed a little better in taste, but I thought that I might return another time to this ale, which is so highly thought of by the BA.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Belgian Dark Strong Ale,94

The head recedes quickly into a foamy ring around the perimeter but with little lacing to speak of. That last point is the only thing keeping it from a perfect appearance score.  Smells of brandied raisons, malt and a touch of alcohol.  Dark, herbal flavors mingle with plum and malt themes. Deliciously creamy finish follows a tongue-tingling mouthfeel. A rich, sweet aftertaste fades to a clean ending. Beautiful.  Mentioned previously, the mouthfeel is great and the alcohol is not immediately noticeable, making this (at 9% ABV) a dastardly drinkable concoction.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Belgian Dark Strong Ale,94

There seems to be a minimal hop presence up front, which I like. The alcohol is a big factor at the end. M&D: A bit too carbonated, but does not detract too much from the taste. Medium-bodied but lighter for the style. The alcohol kick at the end takes away from the drinkability, but still a nicely balanced brew.

Carbonation is excellent as well. The looks are perfect for this one folks. Smell is strong of bananas, sweet candied malt, and various spices. Spicy with fruity esters. Taste is delicious. Lots of dark fruit, banana rind, and sweet phenols. Pure malt based, slightly caramelized, yet earthy. Taste is overall well balanced, dark and fruity. Full-bodied. Mouthfeel is creamy.

The smell was heavy in a complex fig and date scent with a slight hint of hop spice in the rear of the nose.  The drink started with a kick of figs and complex fruits the middle was more of the same. The finish was heavy and lingering yeast and fruit.  This is a very good beer that would be a good example of the style. Quite drinkable and refreshing. Heavy and chewy but not over the top.

T: Dark, sweet roastiness with hints of chestnuts, clove and spice. Lemon and orange fruit notes, that mix with the peppery alcohol. Excellent blending, really very well brewed.  M: Thick and rich in consistency, but light on the tongue and palate.  D: Let's just say that I bought the 12 oz. bottle this time. I'll be looking for the 750mL size next time.

Left lacing behind that was sticky and tan. The beer is a deep burgandy color with small bubbles of carbonation shooting up throughout.  S- Raisens, slight alcohol, burnt cherry, earthy.  T- Starts out with a dark cherry, burnt caramel, and piney taste. Ends with a bittersweet citrus taste and a tinge of alcohol.  M- Dry and bold. The bubbles work good on the tongue.

I have built up too much beer-knowledge, and, I'd like to share. No better way than with one of the best beers out there, Trois Pistoles. I must admit that I love Unibroue, and many of their creations. Their style seems to suit my palate very well, and Trois Pistoles comes in at their very best. I used to love Eau Benite the most, but, since they no longer export it to the USA, I may have forgotten what it tastes like! But, trust me, it's awesome. Trois Pistoles is excellent in it's own right. It's pretty smooth, medium carbonation. Above average carbonation for a belgian style, but, it doesn't hinder it's drinkability. The 9% APV is pretty well hidden, but, your brain will certainly know it after a nice 750ml bottle, but, pleasantly so. I'd be hardpressed to ever rate a beer above this one I think, but, it is my never ending search to do so of course! Trois Pistoles moves to the head of the class. With a great, dried fruit taste, and all the smoothness you can expect for the style, it's one of the best ales out there. Enjoy!  PS- No, I'm not a shill for Unibroue, though I may sound like it. The Blanche de Chambly is too weak for me, and I really didn't care a lot for their 15th Anniversary Ale, but, I don't think you can go wrong with 90% of their other offerings.

The smell is not powerful, but hints at phenolic spices and a leatheriness that I often find in belgian ales, with some noticeble malt and a definite yeasty breadiness.  It is sweetish to the taste, but lightly so, with the high alcohol balancing the malt. No hoppy flavors.  For the high alcohol content it is easy to drink, going down smoothly.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Belgian Dark Strong Ale,94

Pours a dark dark brown with reddish highlights and a large mocha head which lasts only briefly. It does look nice.  Smell is...not what I was expecting. I'm not getting the spice or the dark fruits. What I am getting is...bannana? Bready, biscuity, yes.  I assume that this is more from my expectations after that aroma, but this tastes like a dunkelweizen to me. A flat, bland one. Not bad, but if I want this taste, I have 3 dunkelweizens I'd take over this any day.  Mouthfeel is OK. Low carbination and a bit thin, but the alcohol is completely masked, making the drinkability of this quite good.  Well, this was my second offering from Unibroue, and while I did like this much more than the Fin du Monde, it will probably be my last. I'm just not feeling what makes these beers so desireable to most. Again, not bad, just not my thing.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Belgian Dark Strong Ale,94

While pouring I was able to pick up on the fruitiness of the beer right away. The smell also appeared to contain some spice maybe pepper or cinnamon.  As expected the taste corresponds to the smell. The taste is well balanced and the alcohol is hidden.  The carbonation is moderate and is pleasant on the mouth.

Sweet caramel and molasses is first to hit the tongue, and is then rounded out with some dark candied fruit and spiciness in the middle.

The pour was very nice, a beautiful copper hue color with a nice thick head. It is high in carbonation with helps with head retention and also has a good lace to it.  There is some belgian candi flavor taste which presents itself as sweet but also has some kind of spiciness to it, like pepper corns. It's extremely dry and there is a prominent taste of alcohol. Even after two years the alcohol was both there in the nose and in the taste.  Upon first tasting it went like this: Sweet -&gt; dry -&gt;sweet -&gt; dry.  It's a nice sipping beer which can possibly be paired with a dessert. It almost tastes like a scotch, too.

Spices, similar to those in a winter warmer.  Taste is a little bland. I was expecting more. Typical dark fruit, rummy, candy sugar tastes but not much complexity. There seems to be some spices added but they don't really compliment the style.  Mouthfeel is full but kind of flat and bland.  Drinkability is okay. I'm not saying this is a bad beer. I just think I had high expectations for it that weren't met.

Still, some lacing on the edges that cling to the glass when sipped.  Nose-- really interesting-- smoky prune with some other alluring characteristics.  Taste-- very nice, slightly tart and dusty but very nice. Not much in the way of hops that I've found, yet. Reminds me of an herbal potpourri of sorts. Almost a brandy-esque effect to the taste.  This was fun. It's something that I might buy again on rare occasion, or with an appropriate complementing meal. Or maybe for an interesting carbonated apertif'. Otherwise, not really in my ""drinking beer"" category.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Belgian Dark Strong Ale,94

The aroma featured spicy yeast, coffee, chocolate, and plenty of jammy, plumy, grapey, fruit. The taste delivered gentle clove, plum, cherry, cocoa, coffee, and red wine--the overall effect resembling the flavor of warm Dr. Pepper, if warm Dr. Pepper tasted good.  Mouth is light, sweet, and fruity with a drizzle of syrup. Very bright, dancing all over the tongue. This beer is sweet, but in a such an elegant way. For a 9% beer the alcohol is well disguised. The only thing out of personal preference I might ask for would be more spice. A delicious concoction for sure.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Belgian Dark Strong Ale,94

22,30,Metalmonk,4.5,"Outstanding indeed. While some of the Unibroue stuff seems to be slightly overrated (don't get your knickers up in a bunch, I said ""slightly""), Trois Pistoles is a world-class beer, real close to the best Belgian dark ales that it emulates.  It certainly doesn't look out of place in a large Gulden Draak glass, and not many beers are worthy of such an honor. The head is tan and tight, a lot like nougat. The color is an opaque ultra-dark brown. Makes the drinker anxious to dive right in.  The aroma is wonderful, full of big juicy dark raisins, cocoa powder, nutty yeast, candy sugar and toasty grains.  Flavor is a well-balanced combination of all those aromas, with milk chocolate (think Tootsie Rolls) also coming through, a grape-y feel in the finish and a similarly slick mouthfeel that delivers enough tingle to keep the tastebuds dancing. A dry hops element and sweet spiciness popped up as the beer warmed. The well-hidden alcohol isn't entirely absent, as there's a light warming sensation as the sipping goes on. [I lowered the taste score from 5 to 4.5 a few days later, as several more glasses revealed the sweetness to be a tad too dominant...still, this beer is no slouch in any way.]  Damn, what's not to like? Plenty of depth, great balance of the sweets and bitters, even a cool label. Bravo.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Belgian Dark Strong Ale,94

The liquid is pitch black until you hold it up to a strong light, then you can see that it is a very dark reddish copper (mostly red). It is quite clear as long as you don't accidently pour a large amount of the yeast which has settled at the bottom of the bottle for refermentation. One wicked looking Belgian-style ale.  Smell - As per the style, there are strong aromas of dark ripe fruits, with a very dominant scent of straight-from-the-vine wine grape. There are plently of spice notes, from cinnamon to clove, and they are easily noticeable. The hop aroma is in the background and smells somewhat dry and not too bitter. The malt is slightly bready and earthy, with a nice richness and presence. There is little alcohol aroma.  Taste - The most outstanding taste of rich bready maltiness hits you immediately. Accompanying this is an equally flavorful taste of the dark ripe fruits along with the clove and cinnamon notes. The grape flavor is much less than the smell. The finish has medium notes of dry hop flavors, along with an earthy flavor which follows through to the aftertaste. Also in the aftertaste is a nice alcohol burn as you exhale after a taste, but not overdone.  Mouthfeel - There is a medium carbonation bite when the liquid first hits your tongue and mouth, but it quickly levels off and you are left with a nicely ""bubbly"" brew. The beer is medium-bodied (although on the lighter end of ""medium"") and is very smooth in your mouth.  Drinkability - What can I say? It's a Unibroue, I could drink these all day. For such a flavor and dark brew, this stuff is so well put together and gives your tongue and mouth such a pleasing sensation that it's easy to sip a few of these throughout a nice evening.  Overall...again...it's a Unibroue, which means quality, flavor, and attention to detail. Just another example of their fantastic skill as a brewery. Simply, this beer is phenomenal. A definite MUST have (several times).",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Belgian Dark Strong Ale,94
22,30,GratefulBeerGuy,4.25,"12 oz into a brandy snifter.  Poured Dark/mahagony brown with deep red hues. Thick, bubbly 2"" head, dissipated to a thin amount of lace and circular covering. The most active point was the very center on the head(the eye!), bubbling up like a gyser.  Smelled spicey, herbal, sweet malt, red wine sourness, wheaty and yeasty.Veggie style greens like green peppers and cucumbers. Rather complex nose.  Taste is also amazingly complex, ultra fruity including,red grapes and banana. Black pepper and spices. olives and black licorice. Mild to bitter hop taste at the end. Alcohol is also present.  Feels crispy and clean on the tongue. Feels active all the way down! very champagne-ish feel.  This is pretty strong brew and is meant to be savored over an extended period of time. The amazingly complex taste keeps you wanting more despite the alcohol content.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Belgian Dark Strong Ale,94
22,30,Lnedrive14,4.13,"Shared with HurricaneMo (thanks):  Thin, but extremely dark brown brew (almost opaque). HUGE white head.  Very malty, mildest bit of hops. Tasted some cane sugar, apricots, dark fruits. Highly carbonated (somewhat of a surprise). Bubbles on the tongue.  Drinkability is very high. Although, i felt as though the flavors were not quite long enough on the palate. Would have been nice if the flavors had lasted a bit longer.  A great brew and my favorite from Unibroue thus far.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Belgian Dark Strong Ale,94
22,30,bwyker,4.79,"Right away, I knew I was in for a treat. Powerful carbonation , which formed a huge golden-brown tinted head. The head (very) slowly became a swirling island of foam in the middle of the glass, leaving behind sticky lacing along the way. Raisins and toffee in the nose, with undertones of estery-banana and bread. Tastes of rich chocolate, caramel malts and very subtle alcohol. Banana in the finish. Smooth and bubbly mouthfeel. A highly drinkable, yet full bodied brew. This beer is outstanding.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Belgian Dark Strong Ale,94
22,30,kmudrick,3.97,"Poured from a bottle in a Chimay chalice. A: Very dark, lucious with an overwhelmingly creamy head that settles into a beautiful lacing that stuck throughout the entire tasting. Almost caramel in richness and depth, a few shades below a cola with a developing tinge of deep orange as the chalice narrows into the stem. S: Very much lacking. A few sniffs reveals some hints of yeast and malts but nothing else jumps out. T: Delicious. A slight hinge of bitterness hits the front of my mouth but that completely gets washed out by the incredible complexities. Warming and flavorful without the overwhelming taste of alcohol. M: Very smooth and airy for a beer this heavy. Dances around my tongue. Slightly tingly. D: For a beer this high in alcohol, I was pleasantly surprised at how drinkable this was. As it settled a bit and I got nearer the bottom of my chalice, it felt a little heavier, but it was still a real treat for my mouth.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Belgian Dark Strong Ale,94
22,30,doppelmeup,4.65,"This was an exceptional beer. I don't know if I have all the adjectives to describe the beer, other than to say it was delicious.  Very dark, ruby colored pour into an oversized wine glass. Nicely balanced aromas, followed by an exceptionally smooth taste. Extremely balanced.  Mouthfeel was like velvet. This went down very easily. I'd give it a 5 on drinkability except the ABV would limit how much you could drink in one sitting. Overall an exceptional beer.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Belgian Dark Strong Ale,94
22,30,peabody,4.25,"Dark tea color with a hint of ornage. The head has a light brown tint. Two fingers on the pour and took a while to subside leaving some nice lacing. Yeast and plum or mabey apple are the first to hit the nose. In the back are the dark malt and the slight hop aromas. Overall, very fruity smells. Taste is exceptional. There is a slight toffee taste but the fruit and dark malt flavors are very overpowering. (a good thing) Very bubbly and the flavors dance around the tounge. Very clean finish that leaves the alcohol feel in the back of your throat. This is a great beer that one could drink three or four at one sitting.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Belgian Dark Strong Ale,94
22,30,stouty1,3.88,"Poured into my chalice a beautiful dark coppery caramel color. Very nice caramel head that reformed with a swirl of the glass. Laced out within the entire beer and not just around the rim.  Smells of fruit. Apple, pear, some berries. Jumps right out at you with every sip.  No taste on the tip of tongue but oh so sweet once it rolls to the back. Slight fruity bitterness hides the alchol, but leaves a nice warming sensation.  Good beer, not the best but I could enjoy another of these. It went down fast tonight, but I don't think I would reach for a nother just yet, unless it was all I had. Unibroue hasn't disappointed me yet!",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Belgian Dark Strong Ale,94
22,30,sevenredrabbits,4.87,"750ml Bottle. Poured into goblet style glass. 3 finger head developed but quickly dissipated into lacing that lasts until finished. Smell: Plums. Definitely plummy. Taste: Cannot describe. Palate not refined enough, but...Very damned good. Mouthfeel: I'd agree that it's harsh. Not bad though. I'd definitely bring a few bottles of this to a family gathering.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Belgian Dark Strong Ale,94
22,30,expatsteve,4.97,"Appearance: Black, with a few mahogany notes and decent visibility for a dark beer. 1/2 inch head that settles into sticky thick lacing and nice suds cover. Characteristic Unibroue viscosity - low/medium.  Aroma: Raisins, plums, molasses, and some nice cantaloupe undertones. Some boozy wisps, sourdough breadiness and yeasty notes makes this an amazingly complex and impressive nose.  Taste: Creamy malt front palate, with raisins and apricots - almost a bread pudding hint to it. Toffee malt and yeast finish. An amazing set of developments in this one - molasses, dried plums, strawberries, brown sugar, a little booze and a good yeasty finish. Wow. One of the best balanced and developed beers I've ever had.  Mouthfeel: Lighter than might seem appropriate for such a complex strong beer. Booze is well masked, and the maltiness of the beer keeps it drinkable while the fruity notes add a cleansing quality. Exceptional.  Drinkability: Eminently drinkable beer that stacks up well against other beers in the style - this really should be the jewel in Unibroue's crown. Exceptional. I can't say enough good things about this beer, so I'll stop.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Belgian Dark Strong Ale,94
22,30,EPICAC,4.33,"Appearance: Pours a deep black that is a cloudy, deep red against the light. A foamy beige head tops the beer, with good retention and patchy lace.  Smell: Yeasty, tart fruitiness, spicy alcohol and light roasted malts.  Taste: Tart fruit, spicy alcohol, subtle roasted malts with hints of caramel.  Mouthfeel: Tingly carbonation, light to medium-bodied, and smooth.  Drinkability: Flavorful, with evident but not overpowering alcohol.  Overall: My comments for this beer are similar to those for Maudite.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Belgian Dark Strong Ale,94
22,30,DaveFL1976,4.27,"What a pretty beer. Bark mahogany brown body, sort of murky, topped by a light and fluffy off-white head. The head sticks around for quite a while and clings to the side of the glass.  The nose is sweet, caramel, toffee, and maybe a bit of dark fruits. Plums and dates. It smells really nice, and quite Belgium-like.  Taste is smooth, and -again- plummy. Sweet toffee taste with a slightly warming swallow. Nice, flavorful-sweet aftertaste.  Mouthfeel is a little harsh, I believe. The beer could benefit from a lighter carbonation. Drinkability is good - the taste is great, but the mouthfeel could use some work, I think.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Belgian Dark Strong Ale,94
22,30,haz77,4,"A - Pours a murky dark brown with an inch of fizzy tan head. This drops to a fingers worth after 30 seconds. Can't see the carbonation through the dark body, but the head suggests that there is plenty there.  S - Rum, ripe plums, raisins, toffee, spicy alcohol  T - Spicy rum-like notes up front. Massive burst of sweet, ripe dark fruit in the middle. Alcohol come through towards the end, but well masked. Toffee aftertaste.  M - Medium body and medium-high carbonation.  D - Very nice overall, although I found the carbonation a bit much for the style. Recommended.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Belgian Dark Strong Ale,94
22,30,mithrascruor,4.82,"750 ml. bottle poured into an oversized wine glass.  Appearance: Pours a dark ruby-brown (slightly hazy) with a thick creamy off-white/tan head which becomes a constant foam.  Smell: The beer has a beautiful aroma of rich fruits (cherry, plum, etc.) and a hint of chocolate.  Taste: Very intense! Caramel with ripe, dark fruits, spices, and hops. Complex and well-balanced. Mildly bitter aftertaste from the hops. Also has a bit of alcohol in the taste, but it's not very noticable.  Mouthfeel: Has a fairly constant but not intense carbonation. Medium- to heavy-bodied and very smooth.  Drinkability: The high alcohol is noticable, but not too difficult to manage. The strong flavor can be a bit overwhelming after a while, so be sure to drink it slow.  Something about the smell & taste is very mysterious & dark -- in a very good way! An imaginitive, tasy, and exciting beer. Unibroue does it again! Great for a special occasion on it's own, or with a somewhat heavier meal. Lovers of both Belgian beers and great, unique-tasting beers will enjoy this.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Belgian Dark Strong Ale,94
22,30,Mandrake,4.3,"This beer might have the best presentation that I've ever seen. The artwork on the bottle and foil top make for a very appealing package. With that out of the way, this beer pours a deep and cloudy brown with reddish hints glinting around the edges. Extraordinarily effervescent, I'm caught by surprise as the head erupts out of the bottle and all over me and the chair I'm sitting in. In the glass, the head is a light tan, and builds to a quite substantial hight before settling in, thick and fluffy. Smell is sickly sweet, with loads of grapes and berries, along with yeast and spices. Taste is better balanced, with the grapes and plum still playing a prominent role, but supplemented with vinous notes and a spicy alcohol bite. Finish lasts well, dry and woody, thanks to the spectacular mouthfeel. Clinging and thick, with just the right amount of carbonation. Drinkability is good, a nice brew to savour and appreciate. A real winner from Unibroue.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Belgian Dark Strong Ale,94
22,30,mcallister,3.87,"Hazey brick brown with a white head that has retention and leaves little lacing.  Big bold belgian spice and yeast aromas. Corriander, anise, fig, and other fruits complex aromas. The nose on this is enormous.  As in the nose big and complex. Somewhat feminine in style. The belgian spice and yeast totally dominate this one. Not much hops at all but a very fruity, slightly sweet, tight mouthfeel.  Too much spice for me too drink more than 1 or 2 but a damn solid brew.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Belgian Dark Strong Ale,94
22,30,roblowther,4.52,"Who says that Belgian beer has to be brewed in Belgium? These guys do a great job and this is one of their best. Poured from the small bottle, pours almost black with a frothy, light tan head that quickly dissipates and leaves very little lace. The bubbles aren't the microscopic, persistent ones of some of the trappists and the dissappearing head is probably the beer's achiles heel. Beyond that, though, very few complaints. Smell is sweet, with notes of bananas and...figs? Taste is fruity, then notes of chocolate, with a warming alcohol finish and those figs again. Very smooth, satisfying mouthfeel, really lets you know you're drinking a beer without making you feel you have to chew it. Drinkability is excellent, I could sip these all night. Sip. They are 9%.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Belgian Dark Strong Ale,94

22,30,Estarrio,4,"Poured dark, almost blood-red with a frothy, white head. Aroma of malt and pine with floral undertones. Medium carbonation with light frothy retention.  Thick, carbonated texture with a slightly bittersweet bite.  Flavors of pine, raisons, malt and slightly bitter hops mingle well with a presence of alcohol. The high content is masked well with the balanced flavor. The lingering aftertaste is poignant and citrusy, while the malt undertone remains throughout.  This was my second Unibroue sampling and Im looking forward to trying more!",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Belgian Dark Strong Ale,94
22,30,kimcgolf,3.98,"Aroma of ripe, dark fruit....mostly plums and grapes. Very carbonated taste at first, warms to a very tasty, thick bodied beer. The alcohol becomes more noticeable late in the glass, and leads to a very warming finish.

22,30,karst,4.5,"After 500 reviews I decided to go through the top 100 and see what I was missing. Finding a few like this one from Unibroue that I have tried a few time and missed reviewing. With the help on notes and memory here goes nothing.  Pours a cloudy violet plum with big tan head and showy sheets of lace sticking to the glass. Aroma of malt mix with hints of ripe darj fruit - raisins, plums soaked in alcohol. Very satisfying dextrinous mouthfeel but the sweetness is well balanced. Malt gives way to an acidic finish as hop IBUs kick in and hold up to the big malts, dry aftertaste hangs on.  Always seem to be having this after I have tried several others - this is worthy of trying solo to allow you to fully enjoy its complexity.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Belgian Dark Strong Ale,94
22,30,Iguana,4.73,"I've been hesitant to try Unibroue beer's. I wasnt the biggest fan of Belgian-style ales when I first got into craft beer. That coupled with the fact that I can find their beers at both the major beer stores in town led me to other beers first. But wow, this beer is amazing.  Appearence - Poured a dark chestnut color, borderline black, into my goblet, pretty decent head on it that settles into a nice thin layer of foam.  Smell - Yeasty, hints of banana/clove. Once it warmed up clove scent is more prominent.  Taste - Simply amazing. Banana, clove, toasted brown sugar, ripened dark fruit. Very sweet.  Mouthfeel - Sweet, syrupy, crisp, everything I could want.  Drinkability - Dangerous. 9% ABV in a smooth, refreshing, sweet beer. I could drink this all night till I am no longer standing. This is among the best beers I have ever had.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Belgian Dark Strong Ale,94

Also a hint of caramel smells. T - you can definitly taste the alcohol, but not in an offensive way. Sweet maltiness with little bitterness. Many fruity esters present much like the aroma counterpart. M - good carbonation (it popped when I opened it). Very full bodied, much more than I expected and there is a definite warmth from the alcohol. D - mmm, delicious! I think if it were 60 degrees cooler outside and I was by the fire I would not mind enjoying this again. Pretty heavy and potent beer so don't look for to be refreshing but absolutly delicious none the less.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Belgian Dark Strong Ale,94
22,30,dfried,4.58,"Very dark, almost black in the center with a redish-purple hue close to the center and around the edges. Good sized caramel colored head that lasted as a 1/2 cm thick film throughout the beer. The aroma was of Belgian yeast, thick and syrupy, lots of esters, a bit like a hefes banana/clove smell, with some brambles in the background. The taste was of course very Belgian, yeasty and bready, but very sweet as well. You can tell it's a toasted malt, but the malt is not really a bitter toast, it stays very sweet and fruity, I really like the hint of rasberry I got in the finish. The mouthfeel is very light, sweet tingle, much like a wine. This beer is so very drinkable, the bottle went down easy and fast.

22,30,hunteraw,3.87,"This one came in a bit under my expectations. Sampled at Brickskeller in DC.  Appearance: Very dark brown pour, with purple hues, nice head but leaving not much lace.  Smell: malt and Belgian yeast aroma dominate.  Taste: malt is the dominant flavor here, with dark fruit and an aftertaste that is all belgian yeast. Finishes fairly dry. Not overly sweet. Alcohol present in the background.  Mouthfeel: thinner than I expected for such a dark beer. no complaints on carbonation.  Drinkability: one was enough. I had high expectations for this one, and maybe they were too high. It was good, don't get me wrong, and more drinkable than a lot of Belgian-style ales because it's not overly sweet, but I just didn't get the complexity out of this one that a lot of other reviewers seem to have - maybe I'll have to come back to it sometime.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Belgian Dark Strong Ale,94

22,30,denjen,4.08,"Dennis: For some unknown reason to me, my first sip reminded me of when I was a kid eating a grape tootsie roll pop (damn I still love those things). The taste and aroma are classic Unibroue, but there's a certain fruity tart bitterness that really adds something special. You can really taste the alcohol compared to other brews (9% alcohol). I think this time they laid off the Belgian sugars and let the bitter come through...with good results. Jen: For Unibroue, this seems to have very few bubbles in it, although, it does have a very smooth flavor. The color of this beer is a rich and dark. I get a nice warm feel from the slight alcohol twinge in it. There is a mild presence of some fruits and sugar with a mild spiciness to it that leaves a tingle on my tongue. Other than their Ephemere, this is my most liked Unibroue's.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Belgian Dark Strong Ale,94
22,30,EvilKeith,3.75,"Pours into the goblet a lightly hazed rich mahogany color. The head makes a brief appearance as a fizzy tan foam that would feel right at home on a cola. The head fades to a cap with continuous pools of mid-sized bubbles of carbonation breaking the surface. The smell is a blend of sugary sweet malts, bold yeasty bread notes, faint hints of chocolate, and moderate ethyl alcohol. I'm finding the taste to be much more to my liking than other Unibroue Belgian Strong Dark Ales I have tried. Big malty backbone with heavy yeast notes. As has been reported many times before, a pleasant wine-like mouthfeel. Moderate (on the high side) carbonation. For me the ABV makes this drinkable, but in moderation only.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Belgian Dark Strong Ale,94
22,30,Phatz,4.53,"Allowed to warm for a bit and served in my snifter glass.  Appearance: This is the darkest Belgian I have ever seen. It is so dark it looks black with almost a purplish hue to the dark nearly black body. When I popper the cap I got instant head rising from the bottle. I poured it into my large snifter glass and it sitll had an almost 2 finger beige head that faded quickly, leaving a frothy halo and heavy lacing on the side of the glass.  Smell: The nose is sweet and loaded with toasted sugars and dark fruits and a vinous attribute. There is also a hint of berries.  Taste: The sugar is a bit sharp but is balanced by a berry tartness and a coca darkening character. There is a hint of oak in the balanced sweet tart (acidic) flavor. The finish is initially tart with a wave of sweet in the aftertaste then another wave of tart hops as it fades and lingers in the mouth.  Mouthfeel: Plenty of prickly spice feel and active carbonation make the mouth feel fizzy and creamy.  Drinkability: This is my favorite of the beers I have had from Unibroue. They are consistently good but this one is exceptional.  Hope this is helpful. Cheers!",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Belgian Dark Strong Ale,94
22,30,Orrshow,4.33,Note: This bottle is about 1.5 years of age.  Appearance  This beer is very dark. Almost a nice brownish mahogany. It had tons of creamy head that leaves lacing all over. Cant ask for a whole lot more here.  Smell  From the get go I can smell that sharp Unibroue yeast. Along with it are plums and raisins with bit of brown sugar. There is an almost medicine like aroma as wellkinda like cough syrupbut not in a bad way. I also get a little bit of spice from this beer. I like the effect it brings about.  Taste  Filled with nice dark fruit and brown sugar flavors. I taste some alcohol as well but not a tonjust enough for warmth. The Unibroue yeast is not so prevalent here. A tiny bit of roasted flavors arise too with a touch of tart flavor. This is just a nice dark malt flavored beer. Love the taste.  Mouthfeel  Fairly creamy in the mouth. Nice body. The carbonation didnt bite on this at all. Very good.  Drinkability  Superb.  I like this beer a lot. Its a staple around the house for me.

22,30,JulieRFoster,4.15,"A: Deep nutty brown, like a stained oak wood. Slightly opaque, but just a few flecks refract the light when held up. Tight little Belgium lacing that is comprised of surprisingly uniform medium-sized bubbles. A sprightly little head that falls after the first few sips - just long enough to divulge some of its delicate aromas.  The smell is very sweet; filled with the heavy Belgium sugars that make me swoon (and for some reason I smell teriyaki sauce).  Taste is dark and sweet: burned caramel, cotton candy, and spicy! It's nice and hoppy for such a dark brew. I taste a little Flemish sour as well - I wonder what kind of yeast was used. The mouth feel is surprisingly light and drinkable, although there is minimal carbonation.  This is a beautiful beer, and even more impressive that it's brewed on this continent.

I also poured my beer into a Unibroue branded tulip, thanks to Winking Lizard Westlake.  The beer poured with two fingers of fizzy, effervescent head that depleted to a single finger and left sparce but fine lacing in intermittent rings around the glass. The beer itself was black or verry dark, but included deep reddish brown tones when held up to the light. The nose was excellent: enormous amounts of dark fruits with a strong scent of alcohol lying behind and intermingling with a uniquely belgian style maltiness and a faint brown sugar scent. The flavor began with a initial cherry tones that transitioned and switched back and forth and developed a fine and nicely hopped profile as the beer warmed. The mouthfeel was lighhter than expected, but the drinkability was hindered by the strong alcohol presence.  This is a sipping brew through and through, and one that I wish I had purchased in a 12 oz. packaging. Still, a nice belgian style ale.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Belgian Dark Strong Ale,94

22,30,AmorousAngel,3.9,"This is my first review, so bear with me...  Upon opening the 12 oz. bottle, there was a loud popping sound and foam began to slowly rise in the bottle. It appeared to be a cloudy brown as it poured from the bottled, but quickly became an opaqued dark brown in the glass. It had a fluffly, light cream head (about 1/2 an inch), which disipated quickly. There was also a noticeable sediment, which the label explains as the unfiltered yeast.  The smell is fruity and hoppy at the same time. The taste bears this out. It is complex and robust, with hints of cherry mixed with flavors I normally associate with stouts. The hops aren't as strong as in an IPA, but it reminded me some IPAs that I have tried.  When first poured, there was a lot of carbonation, so that dominated the initial feel. As it settled, it became much smoother.  The flavors and feel of this beer mask the 9% alcohol to the point that it would be very easy to drink more than one in a sitting.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Belgian Dark Strong Ale,94

The bottle holds the remnants of a thin brown film of yeast residue. My next bottle will be chilled for comparison.  Color is dark brown with reddish brown hints at the edge.  Smell is sweet, rich and malty.  Mouthfeel is full and viscous with a bit of carbonation bite. I think it needs to breathe a while.  Taste is sweet, rich & mellow.

Massive phenolic yeast character, cloves and fruit, followed by a faint touch of styrian goldings that gives the aftertaste a dry tone. Lingering caramel and alcohol taste. Medium body, highly carbonated, the crisp body softens the blow of booze and phenols. Finishes residual but with a comfortable dryness.

22,30,andrewmartin,3.72,"750ml bottle, consume by date of 2-1-09. This was an enjoyable beer, but I think it was far too young. I would love to try this after aging it a couple of years.  A-Pours a dark cloudy brown, almost chocolate, with a huge head  S-Yeast and notes of fruits like raisans are prevelant.  T-This is where the age of the beer is evident. Initial taste is a bit harsh, gives way to malts and fruits, delayed aftertaste of bitterness that quickly dissaptes  D-Very drinkable for the alcohol content  Good beer, needs to be layed down for a couple of years",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Belgian Dark Strong Ale,94
22,30,LittleWolf,3.95,"750 ML bottle given to me from my brother.  Muddy brown pour with dark brown head which dissipates quickly. A wonderful smell of citrus hops and notes of banana and oats.  The flavor follows the aroma, as complex flavors initially bite, and mellow to a smooth aftertaste. 9%, but the alcohol taste is masked well. Definately a beer to try, to sip on, to enjoy. I'd drink it again.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Belgian Dark Strong Ale,94
22,30,oelergud,4.2,"Opague dark brown body. Head is light brown and has good retention though not much lace. Eventually it fades to a nice float. Low to moderate carbonation. Smells of honey and fruit. Banana, cherries and abit of wheat. Taste is over ripe bananas and cherries again with a hint of wheat. Fairly complex and a little alcoholic. Aftertaste is sweet honey fading into a brief but strong hop flavor. Full body with a nice wetting effect. Somewhat slick but little to no coating. Highly drinkable, really good and pleasant.  -Oelergud",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Belgian Dark Strong Ale,94
22,30,ultralarry2006,3.53,"Poured from a 750 ml bottle. Left a huge three-finger-plus head that did recede to about one finger after awhile, with good retention, but no lacing. Body was an inky, deepest purplish brown, almost black.  Smell - Spices, bananas, dark fruits.  Taste - same as the smell. Spices - coriander and some clove upfront, with bananas. Then some dark fruits like plums and cherries. Well hidden abv.  Mouthfeel - thin, fluid, moderate to high carbonation.  Drinkability - this is good, goes down well, high abv limits it to one 750 ml serving in a session.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Belgian Dark Strong Ale,94
22,30,BabaJohn,4.25,"Been meaning to review one of these bad boys. Unibroue is definitely one of my favorite breweries and this is my top choice from their selection. This ones a bit cold but it wont hold me back.  Poured with massive head (wont hear that everyday) but beautiful and dark as usual. Trois Pistoles has a refreshing but sweet nose. Taste is of course sweet with some wine flavors and some earthiness in the back of the throat. Theres definitely enough to ponder as it lingers and changes. Warmth of alcohol comes in the aftertaste. Sometimes the carbonation can be powerful on the tongue, but this one is just right. All in all, I love this beverage and strongly recommend it to anyone. If youve never tried it, it could change the way you drink beer.  I forgot to mention: I sampled some dill havarti and Parmesan with the beer just for the heck of it. The Parmesan was definitely more interesting. Side note: the havarti went great with the Erdinger Dunkel I drank last night.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Belgian Dark Strong Ale,94
22,30,kbnooshay,4.8,"a- 12 oz. bottle. Cool ass castle on the label. You need to pour this one SLOW as hell or there will be a mess. This poured a gorgsous dark plum-red with a fairly hazy and carbonated body. The head is awesomely fizzy but very well structured. Not much lacing, as it slid down the glass.  s- Grapes?? Sweet fruity and yeast as hell. Kinda smell like mixed berries.  t- Well More grape flavor is coming through. Notes of licorice and other dark fruits are there too, but for some reason I really pick up grapes, in a wine kinda way. This is sweet and tounge numbingly good. Kinda like a sucrets cough drop. Aswesomely yeasty and spicey. Twangy malt flavor. The alcohol is not there in the taste at all.  mf/d- Tingly and smooth. Very slick and thick. I could drain these all night. This should be sipped though because it will kick your ass.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Belgian Dark Strong Ale,94
22,30,jwc215,4.33,"Poured into tulip glass: Poured black - with slight ruby highlights around the edges when held to light - with a large, foamy head that slowly (especially considering the abv) became a spotted - well retained lace. The smell was of raisiny fruits with an alcohol bite in the background. The taste was complex (not making it easy to describe - but very enjoyable) - It was of spicy fruits - well-balanced - it was like the dark side of a Duvel - reminiscent of licorice and raisins - there was more to it - but tough to put into words - a delicious drink. The flavors lingered until the alcohol slowly creeped in and left a dry, clean finish. This was dangerously drinkable - a ""sipping"" beer that is all too easy to more than ""sip"". I have to admit that I couldn't help grabbing a second one despite my having determined beforehand that I would have only one and save the others for special occasions...whoops. Delicious.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Belgian Dark Strong Ale,94

The nose is grassy, herbally, some slight alcohol, a sort of sour cherry scent, peppery spice and strong yeast. The mouth is very nice, it is fruity, very grassy, and the alcohol gets you after you drink it down. Nice beer and nice trade.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Belgian Dark Strong Ale,94
22,30,trevorwideman,4.8,"Can't get it in MB. My girlfriend was so kind as to pick up some for me in Montreal last month. 750ml corked bottle. Classy.  Opens with a great pop and an explosion of dark and fruity smells. Nearly opaque, but you can see some bubbles clinging to the glass. Big Belgian head that's a slightly brownish-purple colour. Frothy and inviting with a slight lacing. Smell is spicy, sweet with dark fruity aromas, plums, slightly yeasty and almost wheaty. Comforting and zesty at the same time, as Unibroue beers always seem to be.  Taste is extremely potent, an explosion of complexities. Tons of spice, the comfort of all that Autumn fruit combined with the zestiness of coriander, cloves, and maybe even a bit of cardamom. Some caramel perhaps, and that wonderful wheatiness and yeatiness that truly makes this an incredible dessert beer. Well hidden alcohol. I could seriously savour this for hours. Zippy on the tongue, but soft in the throat. Slides down like nothing, but I can't help but savour each mouthful for an extended period of time. This is a great sipping beer. An excepional offering from Unibroue, cheers to the greatest brewery in Canada.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Belgian Dark Strong Ale,94
22,30,VoodooBrew,4.38,"Nice, BIG, frothy light tan heady atop a deep brown body that flirts with opacity. The nose is really spicy -- suprisingly so -- throwing off some wit-like aromas, as well as evidence of the signature Unibroue yeast. On the palate, Trois Pistoles is spicy, with dark fruit, a faint roastiness, and then a hint of sweetness, lemon, and yeasty qualities. She drinks sweet and smooth, with the generous warmth of 9.0% alcohol.  TP is complex, satisfying, boozalicious, and well-integrated.  Another outstanding beer from an outstanding brewery.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Belgian Dark Strong Ale,94
22,30,Mebuzzard,4.38,"Had this at the Falling Rock Taphouse in Denver. A good, dark Italian plum looking body. Head had medium sized bubbles, about 1 1/2 fingers with fair staying power. Aroma contained yeast, malt and some caramel. Taste reminds me of a Saison brew, with more roasted malt. Raisin, bicuit and caramel were noticeable. Finished smooth and while not completely clean, clean enough to be refreshed for another sip. Another good brew from Unibroue",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Belgian Dark Strong Ale,94
22,30,KFaulkner,4.15,"This beer blew me away!  It was my first corked beer, so perhaps I got a little caught up in the moment. But I feel like this was one of the best beers I've had for a long time from a brewery that consider to be one of the best in all of North America.  It pours a dark, cloudy amber with a nice head that has an impressive staying power.  It tastes fantastic and indescribable to me. It's the aftertaste that keeps me wantng more, while the ABV is hidden well.  I would recommend this for anyone and I'm thinking of picking up a second bottle for extended cellaring (even though this brew was nearly a year old when I tried it).",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Belgian Dark Strong Ale,94
22,30,IntriqKen,4.47,"Pours deep, deep amber black with a substantial head that melts quickly to a very scant lacing. Aroma is sweet with a hint of cherries. Taste is cherries, raisins, a hint of chocolate and very port wine like. Most definately a smokey flavor to it as well, particularly on the swallow and aftertaste Very very drying aftertaste. The alcohol is very well hidden. This is a very complex beer. I'm going to finish this bottle with a homemade chocolate chip cookie simply because it makes me feel like spoiling myself. Damn...this brewery in Canada really, REALLY knows how to brew big beautiful extremely complex beers. I keep buying singles, then going back for a 4 pack. (yep, I buy the little bottles...they seem perfect for me)",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Belgian Dark Strong Ale,94
22,30,Kicksmile67,4.54,"These bottle ripened beers never cease to amaze me. They are full bodied and contain odd yeasty notes that can be compared to an almost fruity flavor. The head rolls out at you when you open them and stays for the full ride. The aromas and over all look of this beer are very unique and beg you to taste it. With an almost sweet initial taste the drinkability of this beer is high with a definate ""here taste this"" appeal. One of my favorites.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Belgian Dark Strong Ale,94
22,30,bigdeuce,4.47,"What can you say about this one?? Trois Pistoles is a fabulous beer. Really fruity, especially in the smell, with ripe fruity plums being the main smell. Pours a nice head that sticks with the beer all the way through. Reasonably priced for a belgian, and I don't know if it is the water Unibroue uses, or what...but it has that great Unibroue taste to it. I think Unibroue makes the best dark belgians out there. Extremely drinkable as the alcohol is not overly detectable. One hellava brew!",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Belgian Dark Strong Ale,94
22,30,brentk56,4.1,"Appearance: Pours a dark tawny color with ruby highlights; the tan head leaves many strands of lace  Smell: Caramel, dates, fig, pears, cherries, bananas and a touch of cinnamon; a veritable fruit salad of a beer  Taste: Starts with a caramel and a fruity banana flavor from the Unibroue house yeast; builds with a range of dark fruit (fig and raisin) flavors; after the swallow, the black pepper and other earthy spices kick in, adding a touch of grain and woody complexity to the finish  Mouthfeel: Surprisingly light bodied and highly carbonated; plenty of warming down the throat - it is 9%, after all  Drinkability: With all of its complexity, this is a very approachable beer and one of this brewery's best",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Belgian Dark Strong Ale,94
22,30,Schwarzbart,4.52,"Appearance: The head was a finger high and fizzy, but receded quite quickly. A small whisper of suds remained on top and around the ring. The color was dark plum in color with a little sediment on the bottom. Smell: Flowery, herbal, lemon, yeast, cherries and pepper. Taste: Herbal flavor with cherry and lemon fruit flavors balance well with the peppery yeast notes. So complex that I seemed to keep finding more qualities. Raisons, brown sugar and lemon rind were apparent. Mouthfeel: Lighter on the palate than I expected. Very bubbly and warming. Drinkability: Probably the best Belgian strong dark ale I've had.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Belgian Dark Strong Ale,94
22,30,jettjon,4.18,"Highs: Appearance, nose, flavor Lows: None  Pours medium-dark caramel brown under a one-finger head of brown-tan foam that fades away at a moderate rate. Tiny bubbles fuel the head, leaving good lacing down the glass. Smell is typical of a strong dark ale: ripe dark fruits, plums, pears, a wine presence, and spicy cloves. Taste is initially strong with a bit of alcohol up front, but it quickly moves into dark fruit, cherries, with again a wine-like flavor and cloves, finally with more alcohol on the back. A complex but not overly complex palate. In the mouth, it is surprisingly bubbly, watery, but not too thin. Finish is dry with a bready yeast flavor. Drinkability is very good, but at 9% ABV, watch it.  Overall: An outstanding strong dark ale, one of my favorites and enthusiastically recommended. Though Unibroues La Fin Du Monde (a strong pale ale) is rated higher (35th vs. 58th), I still prefer Trois Pistoles.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Belgian Dark Strong Ale,94

22,30,ojiikun,4.08,"Little head, but I poured this one very gently, since I had to shake it a litlte before opening to unstick the yeast from the bottom of the bottle.  Smells hoppy and herby. Dark, orange-red when held to the light. Just a hint of a yeast cloud.  Feels very light on the tongue. Fizzy like a champagne, almost no indication of the high alcohol content. Smells of green apples and honey, taste lets the sweet come forward into caramel, but all very understated beneath fairly belgian-tasting hops. Ends with a mineral bitterness that actually pretty refreshing. Not a beer you need a drink of water after.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Belgian Dark Strong Ale,94
22,30,jwff,4.48,"Pour was very dark grape/brown, but I couldn't see the exact color since I was in a bar. Head maintained all the way down. Smell was yeast and fruits, but again since I was in a bar this was a bit muffled. Very inviting though. Taste was warm, but not alcoholic. Initially I didn't pour any yeast in, but after I did I gained a bit of a pie crust character which worked very well with the tart blackberries and that sweet yeast that Unibroue is known for. This is very well rounded and a perfect sipper. Hard to realize this is 9% and I'm pretty sure if not for the price and the drive home I would have kept on going.  Served in Unibroue glassware at the Flying Saucer.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Belgian Dark Strong Ale,94

Not my favorite strong dark Belgian-style ale out there, for sure.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Belgian Dark Strong Ale,94
22,30,goochpunch,4.33,"Pours a dark ruby with dazzling highlights. Head came out an off-white/cream color, but did not hold up to its initial size, but eventually maintains a creamy layer over the beer. Spotty lacing. Smell is a big nosefull of fruit. There is the typical fruitiness from Unibroue's house yeast along with strong smells of berries. Fantastic. I don't think I've ever smelled a beer quite like this. The alcohol seems to poke through a bit, but it doesn't hinder this too much. Flavors are of rich, dark malt and that berry character I picked up in the nose. The typical Unibroue yeast is very present in this, and I wish it would have been a bit subdued in order to let the other flavors shine more. I am very impressed with the mouthfeel. It isn't so heavy that it would wear me out from drinking more of this. Carbonation was just right. Just bubbly enough to liven up the berry flavors, and just smooth enough to cater to the malty body.  I forgot how good this was.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Belgian Dark Strong Ale,94
22,30,Dewey0603,4.18,"This pours a dark red/purple with a giant foamy head that lasts forever, very impressive looking. The smell is strong alcohol, dark fruit, grapes, Belgian sugar, and some sweet malt. The taste is strong with brandy, dark fruit, grapes, sugar, and some oak woodiness. The alcohol is not strong in the taste at all. The m/f is surprisingly light with a nice blend of all the flavors.

22,30,bluejacket74,4.33,"This was served in a beer goblet, and the beer is brown with a bit of purple/red tinge to it. It produced a big, carbonated head that lingered around for a few minutes. There's a light fruity (prunes/plums/raisin) smell to the beer, very nice and not overpowering at all. It's not as ""thick"" as I expected it to be, but I could definitely feel the carbonation while I was drinking it. Even with the carbonation, it was very easy to drink. It tasted pretty much like it smelled, nice and fruity but not very strong at all, at least not as strong as I expected a 9% ABV beer to be. There's a fruity aftertaste to the beer too, but it doesn't last too long. I really couldn't feel the alcohol in it when I started drinking it, but it kicked in closer to when I finished drinking it. Definitely an excellent offering, and I'll definitely try it again.

22,30,neenerzig,4,"I enjoyed a 12 oz. bottle of this delicious Belgian style dark ale. This beer has a dark brown complexion. The smell is pretty strong and is mainly of cinnamon, spices such as nutmeg, and fruit such as plums and perhaps even bananas and bread. Also alcohol. The taste is the same as the smell but w/ alcohol . This beer leaves quite a warming feeling after a few sips. the 9% ABV would make it difficult for this to be a session beer for me unless I was in the mood to get drunk, which I rarely am anymore. Quality over quantity when it comes to beer. This beer has a very frothy and creamy moutfeel with some moderate carbonation. this beer certainly has less carbonation than its Unibroue cousin beer, La Fin Du Monde.

Head lasts awhile and some healthy lace lingers after each sip.  Strong, sweet musty aroma, with notes of prunes, balsamic vinegar, cinnimon and alky. Smells potent and spicy.  Fruity and sweet malt to the start that pans out dark and billowy of ripe banana, bubblegum, nutmeg. Some notes of yeast and hops take her down to one hell of an alcoholic warming, whoa. This stuff tastes as potent as it is, with complexity and balance that is BIG.  Full bodied, frothy, creamy mouthfeel with some deep down warming that's easy to consume, but not a sessioner in my book...more like a night capper or cold weather blanket.

Lots of fizziness in the middle of the glass. S: Aromas of dark fruit, mostly grapes and prunes, with that nice beligian style smell. Malty and spicy notes tingle the nostrils. T: Tastes of dark fruit felt at the tip of the tongue. Those prunes are noticeable again with a spicy and almost sweet almost chocolate like flavor that follows and leaves a fruity dry taste at the back of the tongue. M: Carbonation blast isn't as heavy as other offering from Unibroue, which I like. Sticky as it almost coats the mouth which is noticeable in the aftertaste. Warms the chest after a couple of gulps, but the abv is not noticeable as its going down. D: Definately a drinkable beer.

Taste is plums, cherries, cinnamon, cloves, and a hint of chocolate and sourdough in the finish.

22,30,Enola,2.7,This beer poured into my Chimay chalice a deep mahogony color. There is a thin head. There is also lots of yeast that has settled to the bottom of the glass. The smell is sweet and a bit like plums. The taste is very powerfull and fruity. The mouthfeel is overpowering at first and then calms down into a lasting aftertaste similar to apricot brandy.

It descends at a moderate rate, revealing a liquid the colour of dates...held to the light, is between honey and ruby, and just a bit hazy.  Smell is very yeasty and spicy up front- rather airy quality, as well. I'm also picking up on peaches, almonds, and brown sugar.  There's some alcohol up front, along with some guava and brown sugar. Rather spicy throughout, with a dark pungent sweetness carrying that spice. A bit woody and dry on the aftertaste.  A tad highly carbonated for my taste. I don't notice the liquid much because of it- but it' a medium liquid- just about right.  Drinkability is quite good. The high carbonation is a bit much for me, but this is definitely a solid strong dark. I'd not turn it down.  Be well -UF",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Belgian Dark Strong Ale,94

More flavors of white grape or pear juice, more light flavors of bubblegum, has a nice pinot noir quality (would make a good recommendation for a wine drinker). No detectable flavors of alcohol.

22,30,heyitsbyron,3.82,"Poured a bottle from the Unibroue gift pack into a pint glass (it was the best I had).  Poured muddy brown with a very large head, &gt;3cm. Slightly slightly red in color, but the head was near white.  Smelled like generic fruit and yeast. Couldn't decide if it was dark fruit, or fresher more citrusy fruit. Smelled very sweet, though not real boozy.  Taste followed smell, though much sweeter than I anticipated. It got much more syrupy as it warmed. Not nearly as complex as I had hoped though. Just general fruit and yeasy flavors. Hid the booze well.  Kind of heavy and syrupy in the mouth. Carbonation doesn't really suit the body in my mind.  Eh, I don't know why I'd drink it again-- Fin du Monde and Maudite are much better crafted. I think this was much too sweet and just indecisive in terms of its flavor.

22,30,AltBock,4.35,"750ml bottle corked and caged. The front label had a really beautiful picture of a flying horse flying over a city hall type of building in the backdrop of a dark a stormy night. Something you need to see for yourself. The back label had some information about the beer, proper serving glassware, warnings, and the usual US govt. warnings. There is also a Best Before date as well on the back, mine being BB 11-29-07.  Appearance: When poured into a Snifter, the beer was a deep dark murky brown color with just a hint of ruby coloring. The head of foam was an off white color and about 1in in height. It fizzled away very fast leaving no signs of lace and very few rings around the glass.  Smell: The back label stated it had a pleasant aroma of ripe fruits and I believe them when they mentioned that. The fruits however were dark fruits, like the plums, raisins, and even cherries. After those dark fruits, I detected it also had a sweet aroma. Sweet what? I don't know, it was just sweet.  Taste: I believe this is another beer that tasted like it smelled. It had plenty of sweet dark fruits, like plums and cherries, in the front. Not too sweet, just had a subtle taste of sweetness. After all that, a slight hoppy taste came through at the end. And like the sweetness the hops were subtle as well. Very good!  Mouthfeel: Full-bodied and yet it was very smooth. I did notice just a slight hint of that 9%ABV. I could taste it, but I couldn't feel it going to work on me.  Drinkability: Another excellent beer from Unibroue and a must try beer from this brewery. Even though I couldn't feel the ABV it's probably wise not for me too drink too much of this beer in one sitting. This is something I would consider purchasing agian in the near future.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Belgian Dark Strong Ale,94

Not much head and it disappears quickly.  Smell: I detect some spices, maybe some residual wheat in there, as well as some darker fruits, maybe a hint of cherry.  Taste: The ale has hints of cherry and plums, darker stronger fruits that add just a hint of sweetness. The yeast imparts an interesting flavor, while the candied sugars give a very pleasant sweetness.  Mouthfeel: Velvety soft on the palate. The alcohol lingers on the back of the tongue for a bit.

The head was not as fluffy as the maudite either, but this was not a bad thing. Really deep fruit smell when smelling. It was pleasant and was worth getting a few more whiffs before I started drinking. It has a wonderful taste which is made of the complexities of this brew. It was sweeter than others of this style I have had. The sweetness flows back and forth between some of the other elements: tart and peppery. I can not detect the alcohol at all in this. You know its there but the flavors really overcome this fact. It was smooth to me throughout even with the yeast. A nice light body which is good and coating the mouth.

22,30,CarolinaCardinals,4.27,"Original Review 4-2-2006 Picked up a 750 ml bottle at Cost Plus back at the end of September for $5.99. Best before 11-29-07.  Brew poured a Burgundy-Brown color with a tan bubbly head that sustained well - 4.0. Upon initially popping the cork, the nose was like a merlot. Dark fruits and malts did dominate the smell upon warming-4.5. Tastes noted were the presence of Belgian yeasts, dark fruits, and light hops. Initially the warming alcohol was dominate in the finish but towards the end of the bottle it was not noticeable-4.5. Mouthfeel had the classic Unibroue feel to it. There is almost a champagne like feel but it is more velvety smooth than champagne-4.5. Overall drinkability is that at 9% it packs a punch which makes this a one at a time brew for me. The initial warming makes this a great winter brew. This is definitely another very good beer that I would recommend -4.0. 4.37 Average  Re-review 9-22-19 Awesome off white head with serious hang time!-4.5 Nose is estery with figs and currants dominating.-4.25 Taste is dark fruits, with figs and currants and some red wine. Finish is well balanced. -4.25 Mouthfeel is light bodied and very smooth.-4.25 Overall this beer still rocks my pallette! Glad i picked up a 4-pack! - 4.25 (4.27 average).",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Belgian Dark Strong Ale,94
22,30,daliandragon,4.35,"Another highly though of Belgian style from Unibroue, the king of Canadian brewers, at least by the BA rankings... Pours a dark chocolate and cloudy form into my goblet. The head is nice but doesn't last long, diminishing to a cap within a few minutes, which is unfortunate. The nose is the light airiness of fruit and the weight of concentrated alcohol about even strength. Spices are evident as well. This smells almost more like a mulled or spiced wine than a beer, although thats not really a bad thing. Taste is yeasty and very beer like, which is pretty delicious. The aftertaste is more like a port or brandy but still mild considering the abv punch packing here. The alcohol is more a sidenote than a major presence and the mouthfeel is right on for a strong Belgian. There's a lot here to like. Although cleaner and not as heavy as many similar beers, Trois Pistoles is an authentic craft Belgian with a full taste and satisfying body. A little steep in price but take the splurge at least once, this is quality stuff.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Belgian Dark Strong Ale,94
22,30,ski271,4.82,"This has long been my favorite of the Unibroue beers, and one of the reasons I enjoy Belgian beers as much as I do today. I hadnt had this beer in a while, but Im glad to say I still love this beer. Had it on tap at Zenos in State College. Attractive dark, hazy brown with a small, creamy, off-white head that quickly diminishes to a thin film. Wonderful wine-like aromas and flavors, dark fruit, berries, oak, spice, and warming alcohol that kicks up a little on the finish. It feels light in the mouth yet is huge in flavor and feels big on the finish. This is the reason why at beer expos, I still have to stop off at the Unibroue table for a beer even if I have had all the beers they have at the time. Fabulous!",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Belgian Dark Strong Ale,94
22,30,sinstaineddemon,3.62,"A - this Unibroue pours a dark mahogany with a foamy tan two finger thivk head that is long lasting  S - wow, very spicy, like nutmeg, smells like the top of a christmas eggnog, mixed with a rich citrus-y blend  T - the spiciness of nutmeg flavors translates to the flavor as well, a like a mix of nutmeg and ginger flavors  M - smooth and spicy, very intriguing  D - medium, must like spiciness, but good",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Belgian Dark Strong Ale,94
22,30,Callenak,4.2,"My first beer from Unibroue, definitely not my last. Poured from a 12oz bottle. Nice deep amber color, with a hint of brown.  Smell was floral and spicy.  Taste had a fruit sweetness to it (maybe plums), but noticeable yeast flavoring. All in all, a very pleasant beer and the high alcohol percentage is not noticeable at all.  Mouth feel was smooth with low carbonation. Great beer for the style.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Belgian Dark Strong Ale,94
22,30,styrene,4.17,"Poured into a generic chalice from a small bottle that came in a Unibroue sampler pack. Gotta love the artwork on the label...  Appearance: Gorgeous, deep, dark brown with a moderate light-brown head. The head soon dissipated into a thin, persistent lace.  Smell: Sweet, belgian-y smell; quite reminiscent of a tripel. Raisins really shine through..  Taste: Kind of like a dark-roasted tripel. There's a non-trivial amount of bitterness in the finish, but the sweetness really dominates. Not as complex as one might want, but this is surely not a one-trick brew.  Mouthfeel: Substantial carbonation really gives this beer a lively mouthfeel. This effervescent quality remains down to the last drop.  Drinkability: The high abv goes completely unnoticed, while the carbonation really keeps this beer going all the way to the bottom of the glass. This is simply an excellent beer.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Belgian Dark Strong Ale,94
22,30,Boto,4.58,"12oz bottle: This pours out a dark, mahogany color. There was somewhat of a tan head, but it doesnt last long. The aroma contains many of the dark fruits that are indicative of this style. Also a touch of breadiness and yeastiness. The taste is very smooth. It is full bodied, yet the individual tastes are quite subdued. They all blend together to form something quite nice. A definite keeper. Dont mess with this beer, Sleeman!!",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Belgian Dark Strong Ale,94
22,30,tastybeer,4.84,"Dark brown, more of a cooler brown than warm. Light barely slips through at the edges. Nice white head leaves sparse lace and fades to a swirly marble rye-like layer. Aroma is amazing; this beer smells like pure happiness. Aroma of fresh homemade apple sauce heating on the stove, grass, hay and sweet candy. Juicy and creamy. Taste is another one of the best things ever. It begins with sweet mellow toasted malts and charred earth. Tart fruit breaks through all over the place making a perfect balance. Its almost like cooked layers of apples joined by sugar. Mouth is lush and velvety with perfect carbonation. 9% ABV? Drinkability beyond drinkability.  This has to be one of the best Belgians ever, Canada or not.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Belgian Dark Strong Ale,94
22,30,wedge,4.79,"2005  Hazy, deep amber brown with a fluffy off-white head that drops to a creamy ring. Crisp, sugary sweet vinous fruit aromas blended with spicy phenols...so deep and complex. Rich malt flavor flows into ripe fruits - a slight overall spiciness fades to a lingering sweetness. Full, warming mouthfeel that is perfectly carbonated - can't find the alcohol anywhere.  This is a special beer. So rich and complex...so very good... A damn tasty, first rate Belgian (from Canada).",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Belgian Dark Strong Ale,94
22,30,kohoutek,4,"Served out of a 12oz bottle with a 12/07/07 date on the back. Served at 49-53 degrees - carefully decanted.  This beer pours a dark, muddy brown with scant white lacing that quickly dissipates. Little to no light penetration.  The aromas are very subdued. There is a greeting of vanilla, malt, spicy oak, banana/apple yeasty warmth and malted milk. The presence of alcohol is noted.  The flavors are vanilla, oaken spice, caramel, graham cracker and fruity alcohols mixed with bready yeast. This is a malty experience, but there is a clean herbal hop presence to counter the otherwise cloying sweetness. I like the Belgian contributions, but the ""Belgian style"" carbonation seems to counter the warm malty experience for me. Just when I am savoring the tapering ends of the nicely blended flavors - the carbonation bites me.   I think this would be a great beer to enjoy with a cigar.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Belgian Dark Strong Ale,94
22,30,WMBierguy,4.66,"The beer pours out a hazy, and has a magnificent head that stays around for minutes and leaves lacing down the side of the glass.. Has a very clean taste. The beer is very strong, but the alcohol is subtle. This is the first dark Belgian style ale that I've ever had, and it was delicious. I'm now determined to go and try an example of this style that's actually from Belgium. Delicious beer.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Belgian Dark Strong Ale,94
22,30,lordofthewiens,4.37,"This from a 750ml bottle with drink by 8/9/08 on the label. It was a hazy dark brown color with a thin coffee-colored head. It had a pleasant fruity (raisin/currant) odor. A wonderful spice/fruit flavor, with a touch of alcohol. A little too carbonated for my taste, but all in all a very good beer.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Belgian Dark Strong Ale,94
22,30,timtheenchanta,4.4,Extremely dark red with thin off white head that dissipates quickly.  Sweet dark fruit and plenty of yeast.  Sweet tarty fruit taste with some yeast and alcohol at the end. This is a very spicy brew. It tingles the mouth and tingles on the way down thanks to the alcohol. It has a really smooth feel to it despite the spicyness. Another great beer from Unibroue.  Note: I tried it with some cheddar cheese and I felt like that was a mistake. The cheese just pulls all of the alcohol through to the point that it's almost unbearable.,Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Belgian Dark Strong Ale,94
22,30,Manosbeeroffate,4.25,"Unibroue, what can I say. So far everything I've had from them has been great. Trois Pistoles is no exception. Pours a very hazy dark brown, Smells like dried fruit and malt. Taste? Again like dried plum, apricot and malt. Mouthfeel is very nice, not too thin or thick. Overall very drinkable, definetly for savoring.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Belgian Dark Strong Ale,94
22,30,evanackerman,3.48,"this beer pours a dark ruby witha billowing head that subsides rather quickly and leaves a scant lace over the top of the liquid.  aroma is mostly caramel with a hint of spice and alcohol and a touch of pungent fruit.  taste is not as bold as i expected but is dominated by a caremel spice character. the alcohol is not too noticable for a 9%. I detect the typical belgian bottle conditioned flavor that i find in most belgian ales.  mouthfeel is very nice, small bubbles abound.  drinkability is a bit low due to high alcohol content.  overall, i am not as impressed as i was hoping to be, i guess i just haven't really latched on that well to Belgian styles, i will probably keep trying though.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Belgian Dark Strong Ale,94
22,30,TheBungyo,4.47,"Uncork and pour ... gorgeous nut brown with creamy head. Smells of mellow black cherries ... spicy, almost peppery. The taste is spicy and fruity. Like meaty plums and black cherries married with spices. Mouthfeel is robust with just enough carbination to fill ones mouth. I love this stuff!",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Belgian Dark Strong Ale,94
22,30,Byeast,4.62,"Ah Trois Pistoles. Poured dark , cloudy ( more opaque ) blackish brown with tinges of deep purple. Head was lively and large , about 2 and a half inches of tannish foam. Once this dark belgian ale is taken to the nose, aromas of sweet, dark, ripe fruit , dark roasted malts , bit of chocolate, some yeast and well hidden alcohol implore you to taste. Flavor is rich , round , and dark blend of ripe fruits and dark malts , yeasty characters , mild spicy-grass hop tastes , a tad bit of bakers chocolate and slight but warming alcohol presence. Mouthfeel is smooth and heavy. Very drinkable dark ale , especially for its ABV. Man this is one great beer invention!",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Belgian Dark Strong Ale,94
22,30,barleywinebrewer,4.35,"Years ago I recall finding Unibroue in my area. Two primary offerings - La Fin Du Monde and Trois Pistoles - seemed to move in everywhere at once and for a long time that was it. Until yesterday I would've sworn I had both and moved on to other brews and my homebrews. I was wrong. Tried this since it was on draft for a lark. thankfully I did!  There's lots of reviews on this already so I'll only add this. If you can get this on tap do it. There is a nice evening out of the carbonation and yeast flavors others have noted since it's not bottle conditioned to go along with the wonderful malty / raison / spice flavors. Very well balanced, nicely flavored and a treat to drink. I will order this again and again!",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Belgian Dark Strong Ale,94
22,30,greenjeff4141,4.47,"Pours darks and violet, with loads of carbonation and a nice white creamy head that stays a while.  Very ripe fruit on the nose, grapes and yeast together. Almost smells like a desert wine or something. The taste is very light suprisingly, very complex with lots of fruit and yeast with a slight taste of the alcohol in the background.  An excellent brew, highly recommended.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Belgian Dark Strong Ale,94
22,30,shamus,3.78,Beautiful tan head that clings to the glass. Leaves a solid curtain of fine lace. Dark with ruby hilights. Wonderful aroma but the mouth feel is too carbonated and bit rough. However that being said it goes down nicelyand tastes rich. Bottle feremented so there is a yeast flavour along with complex fruitiness.,Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Belgian Dark Strong Ale,94
22,30,vanrassel,4.37,"An incredibly complex beer  so much so that I don't think my relatively raw reviewing skills can adequately describe it. I'm going to try, but suffice to say this is a fine brew and worthy of a strong recommendation.  I poured it from a 750 mL caged bottle into a goblet with a frothy, dense head. Its colour was a nearly opaque, cola hue with ruby highlights.  Trying to identify exactly what I was smelling gave me fits! I detected a malty yeasty smell with what I thought to be cherries and blackcurrants. (I purposely avoid reading other reviews before doing mine, so I have no idea if this is consistent with what other BAs have found or if I'm totally out to lunch....)  The taste, similarly, was complex, but I thought it was well-balanced between roasty malts and hops. I loved the nice warm alcholic finish, though  that part was unmistakable. It had lively carbonation and I only marked it down slightly in drinkability because I felt its hefty 9% ABV revealed itself a little more than other Unibroue beers of the same strength.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Belgian Dark Strong Ale,94
22,30,acrawf6,4.32,"Pours out a nice deep dark amber, little brown when put up to light. Inch head that is tan.  Smells like sweet plum and cherries. its a creamy aroma but also a touch of pepper.  Taste is spicy and a tad dry. some sherry note to it, an extremely light sherry. some tastes of currant and cherries.  Mouthfeel. TONS of carbonation in this one that makes it hard to tell all the mouthfeel. but without think too hard it good mouthfeel and balance. just soo much carbonation.  Overall this is one fine beer. Its not my favorate from unibroue, and its also not my favorite style. But this is a great beer i wish i would have right now in front of a fire. great cold weather beer.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Belgian Dark Strong Ale,94
22,30,BuckeyeNation,3.92,"Yeasty brick red with a generous amount of dark bronze (center) and ripe orange (edges). Unfortunately, the head doesn't look anywhere near as good as the beer itself. Ecru in color, it has that somewhat harsh, unsticky texture that neither looks good nor deposits much lace. Or, in this case, any lace.  The nose is enjoyable, but it isn't strong enough or complex enough for this strong, complex style. It's primarily dark fruity, on the order of unsweet dates and dried figs (not dark enough for raisins and not light enough for apples and pears). There's also a moderate amount of an indeterminate, musky spice.  Trois Pistoles is good beer that doesn't blow me away. I'm still waiting for the Unibroue beer that will blow me away. Like most of their offerings, this one is on the lighter side of the style spectrum. Light is appropriate for a witbier or a hefe weizen, but I think BSDAs should be big, bold, spicy, and semi-chewy. That isn't to say that the beer isn't enjoyable, just that it doesn't fit my favored profile for the style.  Sweet and bitter fight to a draw, with spicy fruit maintaining center stage throughout. It isn't as spicy as say... oh, your average Belgian BSDA, but it's no shrinking violet either. The fruit comparison isn't obvious in beer that's this unsweet, but it's there. Dark caramel and even carob notes are present as well.  The mouthfeel is enjoyable if you like light and airy BSDAs rather than full ones. Although the carbonation is finely fizzy when beer first meets tongue, it fades quickly. Again, not my idea of perfection, but someone has to hold down the left edge of the bell curve.  I had high hopes for Unibroue Trois Pistoles. Why, exactly, I have no idea, since nothing that this brewery has yet released (that I've tasted) has lived up to the hype. I've found that the higher alcohol brews (Maudite, La Fin Du Monde, Don De Dieu) have been more to my liking than their lower alcohol counterparts. That said, they still can't hold a candle to the Belgian originals. This is good beer, but it isn't even close to special.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Belgian Dark Strong Ale,94
22,30,supernaut,3.62,"A - Good, but not great. Poured a dark reddish-brown with about 2 fingers of head which quickly faded. Served in the same tulip snifter that has garnered substantially more from others of the same style.  S - A flowery sweetness mixed with a mild yeastiness  T - Starts out with significant spice. Hints of licorice and anise followed by an almost woody factor which sets in as the palate dries. Never really any true sweetness across the middle as perhaps expected, yet a boozy yeast tone takes the stage early, ultimately dominating the finish.  M/D - Begins with a mere hint of sweetness and finishes on the dry side. The alcohol is hidden well enough to climb up the drinkability ladder a bit, but all in all the beer is a bit thinner than I would have liked to see.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Belgian Dark Strong Ale,94
22,30,DrJay,4.47,"Corked and caged 750mL. Clear, dark burnt orange colour with a generous, moussy head. Good retention and lacing. Really cool aroma, with lots of plum balanced nicely by cloves. There's a bit of berry and citrus that help make this quite a unique combination of aromas, of course backed up by some bready yeast and light alcohol. Interesting flavour with lots of complexity. The spice ties things together and there's a solid malt backbone there as well. Fruits and alcohol waft in and out throughout, each character there for an instant before making way for the next. Hints of tartness and malt peek through. Sweet, spicy finish that's just off-dry, and there's a hint of lemongrass here as well. Medium bodied yet quite airy - the beer almost seems to disappear on the palate due to the full, well-integrated carbonation. Alcohol is very well hidden, but shows itself in a delicate warmth. A superior offering from Unibroue. This is incredibly easy to drink given the strength. Superb!",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Belgian Dark Strong Ale,94
22,30,Gavage,4.28,"Appearance: pours brown in color with reddish highlights. Big fluffy 3"" head that lasts a bit. Some soft lacing develops.  Smell: ripe fruits, sweet malts, and some floral bitterness.  Taste: strong malt backbone nicely balanced with pitted fruits like black plums, prunes, and sweet cherry. Alcohol is slightly noticeable. Some molasses and mild bitterness rounds it out.  Mouthfeel: medium-heavy in body. Smooth at the start and finish. The aftertaste is long of the fruit tones.  Drinkability: nicely drinkable even with the higher alcohol levels. More than one bottle can be easily consumed, but you will be feeling it even if you are slowly sippin' this.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Belgian Dark Strong Ale,94
22,30,nouseforotacon,4.52,"Standard bottle with a best before date of March 16, 2007. Poured into a Fin du Monde tulip glass.  This one poured out a dark, cola-like color with a slight hint of deep purple similiar to the colors used on the label. Off-white, billowing, foamy white head with huge air pockets, holds for a while, then gradually dissipates into a decent-looking film.  Ohhh, the aroma! Very dry and sweet. Strong, fruity smell of berries and bubblegum with some spicy notes, reminds me of nutmeg, lightly peppery in the nostrils, slightly alcoholic, with some roasty malt presence and powdered chocolate. Wow!  The taste and mouthfeel were totally unexpected. Body is extremely light, really mellow taste. Overall feel is dry, a bit powdery with the chocolate, and sweet and tart with the berries. The finish does remind me of a port, also very dry, with a lingering alcohol presence.  The first few swigs left me with a brief, unpleasant aftertaste that vaguely recalls my experiences with DFH's 'Midas Touch'. I can only describe it as a bit artificial/chemical, not dissimiliar to a strong sulfite presence found in some wines. Perhaps this is from a fruit perservative or directly from the fermenting yeast. Thus, I score the mouthfeel slightly below good.  Drinkability is truly great and, all things considered, this really is another solid entry from Unibroue. I'm going to pick up some more of their stuff later this week and re-review. I think they have a knack for creating beers with complexities that are worth exploring more than once. This one is recommended.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Belgian Dark Strong Ale,94
22,30,zjungleist,4.25,"Pours a nice dark brown with hints of ruby and a fat and lively head that lasts and lasts. As the glass emptys the color gets more dusty and brown, with some nice yeast suspension. The smell is sugary with dark fruit and yeast. The taste is huge and malty. Lots of complexity. I get some dark fruit notes like dates, raisins, and a little bit of plum, yeasty esters, alcohol flavors, and big doughy malts. Mouthfeel is slighly thick, a tiny bit astringent, and sadly, there is even some undesirable alcohol burn to the throat. The alcohol could be masked a bit better. Overall, I would say the beer is well balanced in all respects. Drinkability is only inhibited by the ABV. This is certainly a pleasant brew.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Belgian Dark Strong Ale,94
22,30,danielocean03,4,"Pours a very dark brown with a slightly reddish hue, leaves a thick, two finger foamy beige head that falls quickly to light off-white lacing. Aroma is yeasty, along with rich and dark sweet fruits, primarily plums and dates, along with slight hints of cherry. Taste is well balanced between a sweet maltiness and lighter hop flavors, cloves present as well as some nutmeg spiciness. Can't help but mention that the overpowering carbonation is hiding a great deal of the flavors in this brew. Mouthfeel is smooth past the heavily carbonated medium body of this beer. Easily drinkable, intriguing beer, overall very enjoyable, might seek out again.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Belgian Dark Strong Ale,94
22,30,beerphilosopher,4.55,"Poured into a large tulip-style glass as a very dark, slightly reddish black. Ruby-like. Light sand colored head that didn't persist. Sporadic lacing. Nose betrays the ""Uniboue"" yeast scent right off the bat. Accompanying plum, exotic spice, and dessert wine notes. Very complex and very lively. More balanced flavor between maltiness and hops than I would expect. Hops are more assertive here than anticipated. Very strong flavors, further accentuated by the hop presence. An almost biting finish that is medium-bodied. Another great, great offering from this Canadian brewery. I've never had a bad, or even average, beer from these gentlemen. Get it. Love it.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Belgian Dark Strong Ale,94
22,30,Beersignal,4.27,"Despite the recent string of lacklustre offerings from Unibroue, they still have in their portfolio some of the most savoury beers one will ever have the chance to sample and Trois Pistoles is definitely one.  It pours a full and lucious mahogany sporting caramelized highlights under a billowy head of tan foam that is well fed by a constant and lively bead. Retention is better than expected and a welcome treat.  The aromas are one of this brews greatest assets. Harmony, and complexity through a well rounded malt profile that is supported by lively fruity esters and a warm spicyness that carries one back to christmas. On top of the supple notes of coriander that emanate boldly up front, hints of nutmeg and cinnamon roll around with the maltiness and lend depth to the olfactory profile. Traces of ripe blueberries dipped in chocolate surface now and then, accompanied by a tonic like quality. Even more seductive as it warms.  Trois Pistoles is an immensely flavourful brew when fresh but could use a year's cellaring to bring into line the biting nature of the profile. As the beer enters the mouth a lively and prickly carbonation invades the tongue before making way for shots of malt, cocoa, and peppery spice to reveal themselves in brash succession. A subdued fruitiness fights to make its mark but never quite manages to overcome the heady bitterness that takes over mid-taste and jostles with the spicyness well into the finish. A revealing experience, very tasty, but imagine after one year's rest all of these qualities learning to co-habitate in a harmonious profile.  When Unibroue first released this beer in the mid-nineties it immediately garnered a staunch following among beer enthusiasts in Québec which it has maintained and has seen grow ever since. Let's hope that Unibroue will have more of these gems to come in the future to helps us forget the recent misses.  Santé",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Belgian Dark Strong Ale,94

Its a bit spicy and alcoholic in the finish, maybe a bit sour also. I might detect some clove in there also. The mouthfell is nice, rich and semi-thick, good carbonation, it coats the palate well.

Smell of sweet candy and hops is strong, and it's coupled with some breadiness and yeastiness. The smell has also plum, nutmeg and very strong clove. The taste has a vanilla undertone that I noticed right away and the taste also had plum, nutmeg, and clove. The first mouth feel is a little watery, but gets better as it warms.

Some bitterness at the end of the swallow.  Mouthfeel is nice. Very high carbonation level on the tongue and a full body. Very smooth.  Overall a very full and complex brew.

22,30,jasonguit,4.8,"Wow, nice! So good in fact I decided to make it my first review. All those that say this brew is deceptively smooth are exactly right. I am actually in a race with my spinning head as I type. I have foolishly polished off a 750mL alone (yes...foolishly).   It has the same nutty robust flavor you would expect from a dark beer, though the alcohol content does shine through (in a wonderfully pleasant way.) It also has a fruity quality to it that I rather enjoy. It reminds me a lot of a dark german beer if one was to add an aspect of fruitiness to it. It will most certainly knock you down as well at 9%. I am definitely a quality over quantity drinker, and this one will sneak right up on you.  Lovely beer all in all. If you like dark beers I highly recommend it.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Belgian Dark Strong Ale,94

22,30,lacqueredmouse,4.55,"Deeply opaque dark brown. Big rocky coffee-coloured head. It dissipates to a persistent film that clings to the glass.  Divine nose. Dark syrupy sweetness. Through the rich, heavy sugar comes a hint of fragrant berry-fruits. After some coaxing, there's some hints of pepper fragrance. Wow, I think you could smell this forever and keep discovering new subtleties.  Delectable taste. Starts mellow and subdues, but crescendoes with a rich sweet maltiness. Full bodied, rather heavy and smooth. Mouthfeel is velvety smooth and coating. Wonderful.  There's an alcohol spiciness on the back-palate which nicely cuts through the sweetness. Richly layered. This is a very fine beer. One I'll enjoy again and again.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Belgian Dark Strong Ale,94
22,30,laituegonflable,3.72,"Didn't get much head. Dark body. Looks like red wine.  Potent nose. Sorta smells like red wine as well. It's a fascinating smell, anyway.  Tastes pretty wow. It's interesting and complex. Difficult to drink, but for tasting, fascinating. It's rich and dark but drinkable. Doesn't taste like coffee. It's fruity, really. Tastes more reminiscent of a rich, dark plum. But not that fruity, cos it's also beer-y. And bitter-y. And sort of dry.  It's nice, dude, I really like it. I mean, it's not Chimay Red, cos my pants aren't white and sticky, but it's nice. Very nice. Surprising, really.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Belgian Dark Strong Ale,94
22,30,wingnutter,3.79,"Pours a nice black and blue plum-like color with a thick, lingering head. A lacing-we-will-go!  Smell: Yeasty, with dark fruits.  Taste: Complex is an understatement. Starts dry, with nice raisin/fig/plum flavors lingering as I swallow. Nice sweetness in the finish edging out the dryness in the beginning. Yestiness, with some bitterness and grassiness. Earthy. Nice fruityness. Warms as it goes down, giving a hint to the 9% ABV.  Doesnt feel too heavy, which surprised me a bit. I thought it would feel thicker.  Pretty tasty. I like it alot more than the only other Unibroue brew Ive tried (La Fin Du Monde). Packs a nice punch.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Belgian Dark Strong Ale,94
22,30,Blakaeris,4.5,"Appearance is deep mahogany brown with ruby highlights. Head is a thick fluffy mass.  Smell is sweet and full of rich dark fruit with the trademark Unibrou yeastiness.  Taste is very full and spicy. Excellent toasted malt character is complimented by the array of dark fruit notes (plum, fig, raison). Hops make an impressive showing and give a nice balance to this brew. 9% ABV is well hidden leaving only a slight rum flavor.  Mouthfeel is medium bodied with generous carbonation. Normally I'm not a fan of highly carbonated brews but this one is an exception.  This is a wonderful brew. Unibrou makes great beers and to me this is one of the best of them. If you like Belgian dark you need to try this one.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Belgian Dark Strong Ale,94
22,30,Vancer,4.24,"Oh yeah, outstanding  just one caveat, it was surprisingly a little to thinner than expected. That said, what a head! Easy pour produced a massive ivory ice cream dollop on top of a clear, but dark burgundy brew. Laces all the way down, excellent.  Just some mediocre aromas of grand cru Belgium yeast, also with some grassy molds. Yum, a maltly quaff, with sugar cane, apricots, plums and raisins. Thinly carbonated, still very robust with a dry, foamy finish.  It may have been too thin, but nice to sip a sixer, even with the 9% hammer. Im really looking forward to the other strong dark ales from Unibroue.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Belgian Dark Strong Ale,94
22,30,garymuchow,3.78,"Thanks to my brother-in-law Chuck for purchasing this for me. I've been sitting on it for 2 years. ""Best by 5-3-06"" Thought I'd give 'er a go before then. Aroma presents with a heavier dark malt that's sweet with a fairly strong alcohol presence and some heavier darker fruit. Despite a very dull sounding opening it poured with a firm one inch darkish head that settled. Dark, dark brew with a reddish tint. Flavor is consistent with aroma. Alcohol is heavy tasting as is the malt with fruitiness. Dryness builds in time. Some spicieness, but blended okay. Caramel tasting malt. Feel isn't particuarly heavy. Carbonatioin is nicely very firm. Not particularly soft. Overall I'm a little dissappointed. Favor lacks vibrancy (due to cellaring?). Blending is only okay with a heavy alcohol presence.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Belgian Dark Strong Ale,94
22,30,joeyels,4.23,"Very nice dark brown pour with thick tan head. Smell is of mellow spices with just a touch of sweetness. Taste is very good, nice carbonation, sweetness comes through at first touch and fades into more spice. Provides just enough aftertaste to make you want to take another sip. Alcohol is very well hidden, but it's definitely present. This beer is just an absolute pleasure to drink.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Belgian Dark Strong Ale,94
22,30,BigBry,4.33,"750 ml bottle, cork and cage, cool label. Pours a deep and dark chestnut color, thick tan head, lots of lace. Lots of aromas including caramel, spices, and apricot and other dark fruits. Full flavor of sweet malt, caramel and toffee, a bit woody almost oaky, some spices. Also a touch of sweet cherry. Full bodied, leaves a nice alcohol warming sensation. Full flavored, yet still refreshing with a long smooth finish. I had a hard time finding this one, but definatley prefer it to Maudite (although there is nothing wrong with it either). Must get more - some for now, some for the cellar.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Belgian Dark Strong Ale,94
22,30,TheEclecticGent,3.87,Very nice. Had the bottled version of this in a beer tasting event. It pours a very nice dark amber brown like cherry cola. Has very little nose out of the taster glass even though the glass has a bit of a bell. Too light of a scent to describe. The taste is a nice balance between hops and malt. A smooth mixture of fermented fruit and caramel flavors. It has a bit of the warming afterglow from the alcohol. Very drinkable. I will be trying more from this brewery and will defiantly get this beer.,Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Belgian Dark Strong Ale,94
22,30,HopsHops,4.63,"Wow This is Good Beer  Appearance: Honestly i didnt look at this beer i drank it straight from the bottle and it was great  Smell: A little sweet for my taste but i learned to love it quick  Taste: I am not a fan of sweet beer but the fruity slick taste in this one is definitely going to make me think twice about that  Mouthfeel: Very chewy and fruity ....wow ...im speechless ...  Drinkablilty: This whole review is just me making up stuff to say about a great beer i thought was unbelievably good i didnt examine it or anything i really didnt expect to like it because im not a belgian style fan because they are usually sweet and im not into that but wow this beer is definitely on my list for a ""must have again"" in the near future ...only problem is its pretty strong and id probly get hammered if i drank too many pints of this....but i never wanted this one to end....bravo",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Belgian Dark Strong Ale,94
22,30,rowew,4,"Presentation: 12 oz bottle - labeled as Ale on Lees. Glassware suggestions on the back, as well as a clearly labeled best by date.  Appearance: Poured into a Chimay goblet - very dark brown with just a hint of red around the edges. Nice head fades, but leaves a nice lace across the top, constantly replenished by bubbling from the bottom (probably aided by the goblet).  Smell: Lots of caramel and spice in the aroma, with a hint of alcohol. Also a bit of fermenting fruit and raisins in there.  Taste: Very similar to the aroma - with the addition of a strong belgian yeast flavor. Starts out yeasty, and then fades into the spice and dark fruits. Just a hint of alcohol - it is well hidden.  Overall impression: Very well balanced example of a Belgian style - well made, balanced, and quite complex.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Belgian Dark Strong Ale,94
22,30,Tupperwolf,4.79,"Wow! Super dark in color on the pour. Some ambient light shines through while it sits on the table, leaving it the color of... hmmm.. Dark, dark grapes perhaps, a really great color I've never noticed while reviewing a brew before. A dark, purplish brown. A very tan colored head made of exuberant bubbles builds briefly then fades to a thin ring around the tulip glass, letting me look into the gently but constantly bubbling depths of Trois Pistoles. After a while head is nonexistant, the strings of bubbles unable to keep it up, and lacing down to none at all.  This was the first I've tried of Unibroue and I really wasn't sure what I was getting myself into, only that I had to try something of theirs before the wait killed me. Wow! Lots and lots of scent here! Like nothing I've ever scented before. Sour grapes, kiwi fruit... Rum, fermenting sourness, raisins. Really intriguing!  Lots more sour-sweet flavors on the palate... Citrus peel, sour grapes, plums, rhubarb, raisins, with a gently warming alcohol that doesn't affect taste, only feel. Really unusual - I'll have to try some other Strong Dark Ales to compare this against. It's definitely like nothing else I've tried, but it's great!  Like a lot of other strong, no-head beers, this one bursts up a bunch of unexpected tight, swishy carbonation upon sipping; I'm glad it does, because if there were less bubbles, I think this beer would slip in my favor from fantastic to very unpleasant. The up-fizzing carbonation keeps the heady flavors and alcohol in check. The body of the beer is pretty light, and there's almost no after-feel, just a tiny caramel lingering.  Whoo! How to rate drinkability? Could I have another? I dunno... I'm happy just enjoying one! This beer definitely has everything covered. There isn't anything in the scent, flavor or feel that dissappoints me at all. Cheers!",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Belgian Dark Strong Ale,94
22,30,beveragecaptain,4.47,"12 ounce bottle. Trois Pistoles pours out a very dark brown color with a reddish tint. The aroma is dark fruit, caramel, and spices. Flavor is dark and malty with lots of yeast flavors. Fruity flavors include plums, grapes. A sweet candy like flavor comes in at the finish. Peppery spice. Full mouthfeel. The 9% abv is well hidden. What a great beer! I love how Unibroue makes all these Belgian style dark beers that are similar but have enough subtle differences to make you appreciate each one.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Belgian Dark Strong Ale,94
22,30,skillerified,4.69,"Dark brew with reddish tints around the edges. Tan colored two finger head fades to about 1 cm that seems to be sticking around for awhile. Good lacing.  Very complex aroma. I'm getting floral scents strong up front, but there's a layer of cinnamon underneath it. I'm also picking up grain-like scents. I almost want to say cooked rice, but not quite, just a little sweeter than that. There is definitely a sweet hint of fruitiness too (non-citrus though). I think it keeps going if you keep sniffing. A really incredible smelling beer.  The taste seems to be as complex as the scent. A hint of coffee/chocolate. A hint of cinnamon. A hint of dark, but sweet fruit. As it warms, it seems to be moving toward the grain flavors. The alcohol is just slightly noticable, but adds even more depth to this brew. It's hard to imagine it getting much better than this.  The beer feels a little heavy on the tongue. A touch of sweetness at the start fades quickly to a middle that honestly doesn't do a whole lot. It really doesn't have to, because the flavor really kicks in that point. The finish has a pleasant bitterness and lasts a long time. Carbonation really pricks the tongue throughout, maybe just a little too much actually. Seems to kind of stick to everything in there too.  I want another already. High ABV will lower the drinkability a little, but I could easily down two or three of these and call it a night.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Belgian Dark Strong Ale,94
22,30,DarkerTheBetter,4.25,"This beer pours a dark coffee brown with hints of burgundy and mossy green that is surprisingly transparent considering its darkness. The head consists of a thin film of bubbles. Smells of musky yeast, root beer and sour red grapes. Tastes of sweet and dry wheat, a mild yeast with a mild coffee-like bitterness. There is also a metallic tang of plumb skins and sour cherries. The mouth feel is medium bodied with an intense carbonation. The flavor of this beer appears to be a bit subdued, but its dryness is well blended.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Belgian Dark Strong Ale,94
22,30,plaztikjezuz,4.2,pours a deep dark mohogany woth a off white pillowy head that drops over a minute into lace. the aroma is dark candy sugar with citrus and spice the flavor is carmelized malt and citrus with a unidentifed spice with a warming alcohol. the mouthfeel is slippery sweetness that warms as it goes down. very drinkable,Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Belgian Dark Strong Ale,94
22,30,Gagnonsux,4.42,"Trois Pistoles pours a dark cola color with an average-sized, creamy, light-brown head. The aroma is of rich, dark malts. Dark fruit smell and sweet sugar are most notable. Rich, dark malt taste dominates here. Dark ripe fruit flavor mixes with an earthy malt. Light toasty flavor is also noted. Sugary flavor bursts through every now and then. Just a taste of alcohol is noted in the finish. My words cannot describe delicious and complex of Trois Pistoles. Wow, this is rich, flavorful, awesome, and kinda ""mellow"" like the label states. This is world class and is a ""must sample"" beer.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Belgian Dark Strong Ale,94
22,30,gotbeer,4.18,"This beer pours a dark brown with a nice head. It looks dark and ominous.  The smell is typical Belgian dark ale. The taste has chocolate malt, with plum, raisen, and a yeasty presence. It has loads of complexity, and it hides is ABV well, with some alcohol warming your throat as you sip.  The mouthfeel is smooth and satisfying. Drinkablity is great as well for a beer of this ABV.  Another incredible brew from Unibroue.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Belgian Dark Strong Ale,94
22,30,unknownlamer,4.05,"750mL bottle of 2004.  Poured a deep ruby with a small off white head that remained until the very end of the glass (and I took a good 45 minutes to finish it). It left no lacing. Quite attractive. The aroma was very sweet and malty with quite a bit of spiciness (clove?), and no noticeable hops.  The taste was mildly sour with a good bit of yeastiness. Very spicy with a subdued hop presence. A bit of pear and plum came out, but the main fruit I detected was raisin. The alcohol comes through and provides a slight warming and complements the spices well. Quite delicious and bold, but still refreshing.  The carbonation was very strong (I almost lost the cork when popping the bottle) and complented the body beautifully. Dark, and still refreshing. A 750 would be easy to polish off alone if no one else wanted any (on second thought, screw them they can have the other beer). I'm going back to the store and grabbing all their bottles of 2004 before I go back to Maryland (Uncultured heard I found some 2004 and demanded some, and I owe him for the Unibroue 11 he shared).",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Belgian Dark Strong Ale,94
22,30,sinistrsam,3.88,"This poured a dark, almost opaque brown color with a large foamy head which stuck around for a very long time, leaving wonderful lacing. The smell was very complex, a mixture of dark fruits, plenty of yeast, alcohol, possibly some chocolate, sugars and spices. The taste was very similar, although the bitter, almost sour yeasty punch that you fel with the first sip fades into a pleasant sweet, dark-malted fruit flavor, all the while maintaining a pretty fizzy champagne-like mouthfel. Very well balanced and full-bodied beer, almost too strong on some of the flavors. Very interesting and another triumph as far as I'm concerned from Unibroue.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Belgian Dark Strong Ale,94
22,30,Viggo,4.42,"Pours a hazy brown, with some orange, small tan head forms, goes pretty quick but leaves a lace ring around the glass. Smell is sweet, spices, orange, brown sugar, prunes, yeast, and some alcohol. Taste is sweet brown sugar, dates, spices, and orange. Mouthfeel was medium bodied with high carbonation. This one has been cellaring since february so it was pretty smooth, need to bust into my 750 ml of 2004 soon.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Belgian Dark Strong Ale,94
22,30,KarlHungus,3.74,"This brew pours an opaque black color. The head is one-finger tall, but recedes quickly into nothing. The aroma is of spices, dark fruits, caramel, and more spices. The taste starts with dark fruits, then gets spicy during the finish, while alcohol coats the throat on the way down and during the aftertaste. The mouthfeel is meium bodied with a lot of (maybe too much) carbonation. Overall, this is a good beer, but not great. I would choose La Terrible or La Maudite over this brew anyday.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Belgian Dark Strong Ale,94

22,30,veggiemafia,4.25,"Poured from a 12oz. bottle into a snifter.  Dark brownish ruby with a surprisingly white head. About 1/2 cm stays through the entire beer, which is surprising given the ABV.  Smell is candy sugar, Belgian malt and yeast, molasses sticky sweetness and dark berries, very Brandy-like alcohol, which is the highlight of this one for me.  Very Brandy-like, fruity, very sweet and syrupy. Really really nice, this one is a dessert all on it's own. Very aperitif-y.  Mouthfeel is sticky and chewy and sweet and awesome.  I could put this away for awhile, but I'd be completely smashed after a few.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Belgian Dark Strong Ale,94
22,30,nlmartin,4.7,Poured from the bottle into a pub glass.  Appearance: This beer pours a very lovely dark brown with slight ruby opaqueness. The head was thick and fluffy creamy off white. This beer laces like pancake batter on my glass.  Smell: This is a busy busy beer. Man does this smell great. I am getting all kinds of spicy goodness playing along with some chocolate and assorted fruity goodness.  Taste: Lives up to its own smell. This is a delicious beer. Spicy maltyness plays with chocolately fruity goodness. The alcohol taste is buried under the taste. This taste just fantastic.  Mouthfeel/ Drinkability: Dam this is good. The beer is full bodied. The carbonation plays nicely with this tasty beer. I wish I had known about Unibroue sooner.,Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Belgian Dark Strong Ale,94
22,30,SkeeterHawk,4.74,"The beer has a best before date of 3-15-08, so I think that I am probably drinking a fresh example. I haven't been quite so lucky with their La Fin Du Monde.  Appearance: The beer starts off life outside the bottle as a deep rich reddish brown color that starts off hazy due to a whole bunch of bubbles rising. There was about an inch of head initially that was off white and creamy. The head maintained for quite some time as a small cap on the beer. There was very little lacing. Sadly, the beer never really clarifies like I expected it to.  Aroma: Really fruity aroma. There is plum and raisin along with some green and red apples thrown in. There is the faintest hint of banana, along with some noticeable black cherry. A lot of toasty bready aromas from yeast and malt are evident among the fruit basket.  Taste: The flavor is more bold than even the aroma suggested. There is a lot going on here. There is still a whole lot of dark fruit in the flavor along with some significant spiciness that I didn't get in the aroma at all. There is a whole world of flavor that greets you in the beginning, but this fades to let the carbonation and spices dance across the back of the palate. In the end, the finish is slightly dry with some noticeable alcoholic warming in the back of the throat.  Opinion: This is an incredible beer! This is probably the only beer that I have tried in recent history that I think would give St Bernardus Abt 12 a run for it's money. The aroma and flavor is rich and complex, and you can notice something new just about every time you raise the glass to drink. I have tried this beer before, but it was after quite a few others before hand. As one of my first beers of the evening, it is much more enjoyable. Take your time with this one.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Belgian Dark Strong Ale,94
22,30,Mindsquall,4.67,"Purchased in a 6 pack of 12oz Bottles, and drinking one as I write this. (Served in a 22oz Pokal)  This brew poured to a cloudy chocolate brown color leaving a cappuccino colored head that slowly dissipated to about 2mm.  The smell is fragrant, reminiscent of caramel and molasses. Taste is exceptional. Bold undertones of Fruit that lead to a finish that is reminiscent to a fine aged port. The high ABV of this beer is well hidden behind these bold and complex flavors.  The feeling on the mouth is smooth and gentle, not harsh in the least. This is a beer with excellent drinkability and is certainly makes for a nice treat every once in a while.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Belgian Dark Strong Ale,94

A sour aftertaste that leaves behind a warming alcohol sensation. Good drinkability.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Belgian Dark Strong Ale,94
22,30,DaPeculierDane,4.6,"Floral. This beer is very flowery. Jasmine, Coriander, andAsparagus? This is very interesting. The bouquet is just grand. Taste is mixed berries with a sweet front that gives way to complex tart oak notes. Jasmine wraps the toungue half way through each sip and gives way to a dry asparagus. The color is a brilliant deep brown with amber hues. The head is fairly thin but lasting. Lacing is decent. Carbonation is exceptionally aggressive. Texture is meaty like a rib eye. Drinkability is flawless. This is a dangerous fellow to dabble with. My taste buds wish to consume far more than my kidneys could bare. Well done.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Belgian Dark Strong Ale,94
22,30,Citadel82,3.87,"As I work my way through the Unibroue holiday sampler I have come to this one. It is tasty though not as remarkable as some of the other offerings.  Pours deep garnet with a white head that is short lived and left little lacing. Carbonation explosive at first but this fades rather quickly.  Aroma is dried fruit and sweet malt, hints of spice and floral.  Taste is nicely balced and complex with many hints and notes of yeast and fruit and various spices.  A drinkable brew.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Belgian Dark Strong Ale,94

Aroma: Tingles the nose. Smells sweet and spicy.  Taste: Very sweet, like Fin du Monde and Maudite, but not quite as spicy. Very balanced. Not extremely hoppy.  Mouthfeel: Smooooth going down. Carbonation adds a little excitement to every sip.  Drinkability: Dangerously drinkable.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Belgian Dark Strong Ale,94

After things settle, I get 2 fingers of an off-white head. Nose is very fruity and spicey. Notes of orange and raisin sit under a coriander spicyness. Touches of brown sugar sweetness come through as well. Flavor is solid. Good sweet raisin soaked in orange juice and brown sugar. Very well blended. No hint of alcohol, which is awesome. Feel is moderate with a moderate carbonation. I'm very impressed with the drinkability of this brew. I'm really not having to take time between sips, as would be expected from the alcohol content. A very good brew.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Belgian Dark Strong Ale,94

Smell is very rich, sweet fruity begium yeast is obvious through a very malty aroma.  Medium body feels lighter than I expected, also feels very carbonated. Slight alchohol warming not as obvious as expected from a 9% ABV.  Taste is very sweet malt, fruit and clove with serious tartness. Goes down very smooth.

22,30,HardTarget,4.5,"Bottle Inspection: 9% abv, Ale on Lees aka bottle conditioned, glass suggestion pictograph on the back label (chalice) and a best before 09-28-07, classy art work, these people know how to make a label!!!  Aroma: Standard Unibroue yeast nose with ripe dark fruit, grapes, plums, prunes, and some white pepper and a whiff of alcohol.  Appearance: Speckled creamy off white head crowns an opaque brown glass with clear brown edges. Trails of lace mark its passing.  Flavor: Peppery, vinous, the Unibroue yeast is prominent and shows the excellent balance struck between mellow malt and hidden hop. It really does come across as more of a port wine than a beer.  Mouthfeel: The alcohol is a bit warming, wonderful tiny bubbled carbonation lends itself to a lively yet creamy feel. Good stuff.  Overall Impression: A slow sipper to be sure, but a wonderful way to pass an evening. Dont try to slam this one; it needs to be slowly enjoyed. Massively drinkable, I just want more. You have to like the yeast strain to enjoy it, but I do so this is a treat.

22,30,Oxymoron,4.3,Unibroue has an impressive Belgian strong dark ale that is enjoyable and worth trying. Trois Pistoles has a dark amber if not brown color that is cloudy visually but the rich amber color is only seen holding your glass up to the light. The head retention was a slight off white but quickly dissipated and left little lace to the glass.  The smell knocks of Belgian-esk with a fruitiness to boot. More of a sweet and sour aroma but notice of malt is light and noticeable. The taste does not hint the 9% ABV that one would think. Quite enjoyable and mixed well with malt and fruity with hints of plum or raisin. The after taste has a bigger carbonation feel with strong tones of different spices from say a bunt cake. The bubbles dance in your mouth but the high alcohol is limit and nearly existant. Makes for a good mouthful flavor.  Unibroue Trois Pistoles is a great tasting Belgian strong dark ale but not something to have on a regular day home from work. Instead enjoy this beer with someone who will enjoy a unique Belgian and flavor.,Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Belgian Dark Strong Ale,94
22,30,SaCkErZ9,3.89,"Poured from a 12 oz bottle with expiration date on back of the bottle. A very nice, fluffy head formed, about 1 inch in height. Slowly but surely fizzed away into nothing leaving no lacing. Color reminds me of a Jelly Belly chocolate flavored jelly bean; a brown with maroon and raspberry coloring mixed in. Nice color indeed.  Smells of caramel and yeast and even chocolate covered cherries. Also a nice chocoalte malt is present. No hops present in the aroma.  Taste is quite complex as well. I can definitely taste some yeast as well as a slight chocolate taste. A slight bit of raspberry or maybe orange liquer like a triple sec is also present; I cant decide which. Maybe its both. Alcohol is barely noticeable but starts to stand out as the beer warms a little. No hops.  A very smooth and slick mouthfeel. Nice amount of carbonation. I like this beer a lot.

22,30,pjwilson,4.35,"appearance: 750 bottle with great artwork. Beer pours into wine glass with a nice foamy head that lasts for a bit then receides. This is a very dark beer, perhaps the darkest beligium style beer i've seen. Held to the light it reveals itself to be a dark ruby red. taste: fruity, pears and plums come to mind. i can taste some of the yeast, but it is very well balanced, compared to Maudite which i felt so yeast overkill. this is not a sweet beer. this has great balance. it's so smooth it takes a few sips to realize just how great a beer it is. absolutly no alcohol in the taste. smell: mirrors the taste, but just a hint of the alcohol is detectable. mouthfeel: really light for a beer of this size...but it works great. It doesn't taste watery in the slightest, but it feels like water going down. drinkability: really great. this could be the easiest drinking 9 percent beer i've had the pleasure of drinking. notes: this beer is an event in and of itself a great way to wind down on a weeknight evening. just the cure for pale ale burn out. so far my favorite from unibroue. will get this again...soon",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Belgian Dark Strong Ale,94
22,30,canucklehead,4.55,This is my 500th review and it ironic that it is a beer that helped start me on the road to craft drinking. I love this beer because it has the depth and complexity that make having a bottle a relaxing event.  The beer pours dark brown with a cloudiness caused by the lees. The nose is old fruit and leather. This is a full bodied beer in the tradition of Rochefort 10. The finish is big and crisp. Aging will soften the big notes and bring into a harmonious focus.,Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Belgian Dark Strong Ale,94
22,30,Wasatch,4.52,"12oz. Bottle Best Before: 06/02/17 Revist: 27 Apr 15  Poured into a chalice a very nice cloudy reddish brown color, very nice carbonation, two-finger creamy/foamy light tan head, leaves a HUGE creamy island and some sticky lacing. The nose is very nice, malty, lots of figs, plums, raisins, with some yeast and spices. The taste is malty, with some nice yeast notes, the dark fruits kick-in very nicely, with some spice. Medium body. Overall, this brew is still very tasty, for the money, very hard to beat.  12oz. Bottle Best Before: 11-30-03 Reviewd on 15 Aug 08  5 Years On This Bottle!  Poured into a Corsendonk Christmas Ale glass a very nice cloudy reddish brown color, nice carbonation, a very quick fizzy tannish head, not much sticky lacing on this one. The nose is very nice though, malty, lots of figs, plums, raisins, with some yeast and spices. The taste is malty, with some nice yeast notes, the dark fruits kick-in very nicely, with some spicyness. Medium body. Very drinkable, this brew has got to be close to maybe 8 years old, not sure when Unibroue produced this one, but it is already close to 5 years beyond the expiration date. Still very tasty. I have a few more bottles left, YEAH!  Poured a nice reddish/brown, small head, tons of lacing thorough out the drink. Scents of malt, sweet caramel. Awesome taste nice and sweet a little bitter at the start, but finishes strong. Medium body. Very drinkable even at the 9% ABV. Another awesome brew from Unibroue.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Belgian Dark Strong Ale,94
22,30,phisig137,3.56,"Corked and caged bottle, bottled in January 2004, that was slightly overcarbonated. Soon after I popped the cork, head began to rise up out of the neck of the bottle. Somewhat dissapointing there... especially after a few overcarbonated ""bottle bombs"" of home brew.  Looks nice and dark, with red tinges, generally very cola like. The aroma is slightly sour, with bread and yeasty notes, and a hint of caramel.  Taste is dominated by bready flavors, in addition to grain, over-ripe fruit, molasses, and a bit of honey. For some reason, the first sip I took, I thought ""half and half mixture of Rochfort 10, and Orval"". That really is the best way to describe it I guess. I seem to remember this being a bit sweeter, as this bottle seemed quite dry. The taste lingers nicely, and coats your mouth, which almost begs for another sip.  All in all, it is a quality beer, as all of Unibroue's offerings are. And for only $6.50, I'd consider it quite a steal. In addition, I love Unibroue's label art... it's just so epic and cheesy, that you have to love it.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Belgian Dark Strong Ale,94
22,30,medic25,4.67,"Served in a chalice from a 750ml bottle. Extremely dark brown/ruby color, with almost no head. Aroma is a fruity, malty pleasure. The taste is even better. Sweet, malty, with the big alcohol nicely hidden. This beer goes down wonderfully, especially on cold, rainy nights like tonight. Another classic from Unibroue, my desert island brewery.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Belgian Dark Strong Ale,94
22,30,Derek,4.35,"A: Black, with a slight red hue. Little head, no retention, no lace.  S: Sherry, slightly fruity, with a hint of caramel & tar.  T: Prune, licorous & treacle, with a hint of cherry & chocolate. Balance leans toward the sweet side. It hides the alcohol well... only slightly warming aftertaste.  M: Light-to-moderate body (an accomplishment for this strength), moderate-to-high carbonation. Very Belgian.  D: Dangerous at this alcohol level.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Belgian Dark Strong Ale,94
22,30,rteis,4.74,"quite possibly one of my favorite beers. A little off from Unibroue's typical offering. Much darker than anything else I've tried from them. Would love to try this on tap sometime, but don't see how that's possible without making a trip to Canada. Enjoy!",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Belgian Dark Strong Ale,94
22,30,sopor,3.73,"Loud frothy tan head is very active over a dark mahogany translucent base. Head is quickly down to a splat and ring. Smells of spiced plum and a hinto of alochol.  Vinous, sweet and spcied plum flavors are stonrg. Sweetness subdues as beer wrams. A little roast malt shows up in the mostly vinuos and fruity character. Mderately light body with foamy carbonation.  Strong and flavorful, this is some good stuff!",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Belgian Dark Strong Ale,94
22,30,nickss,4.25,"Pours a deep dark brown... HUGE foamy tan head.... looks wonderful. The beer is darker than I thought it would be... difficult to see light through in fact.  I could smell this brew as soon as I started pouring.... very pungent aroma. The nose is filled with with berries and yeast... also a bit of spicy pepperiness, but nothing overwhelming. A great combination of odors.  Extremely well balanced taste-wise... probly the most well balanced of this style I have ever tasted. Beautifully complex. Sweet, but not overwhelmingly so. Malty, but not so much so that it overwhelms the hops that are immediately noticeable. Dark fruit/berries, and a small hint of toffee in it too, although this may be my imagination due to the mouthfeel of this brew.  Chewy, luscious mouthfeel. Active, yet heavy... not quite as thick as milk, but not far from it. Very nice.  This beer disturbs me. A beer this big should not be so drinkable. It just doesnt seem.... safe =P I just cannot find anything offensive about this beer.... very well rounded. Another great beer from Unibroue",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Belgian Dark Strong Ale,94
22,30,EStreet20,4.35,"12-ounce bottle, as with all Unibroues awesome artwork. Poured into Duvel tulip.  A - Completely opaque black color with 2 1/2 finger off white head, very appealing. Tiny bits of lacing.  S - Sweet, almost maple syrupy type smell. A little caramel in there too. Quite appealing with a sweet malty aroma  T - Sweet, malty taste. No real alcohol taste in there. A little sweet with some fruitiness but I can't really place what. Mostly a molasses/caramel sweet taste. Very tasty overall.  M - A nice smooth drink. Not flat but not a whole lot of carbonation. With the sweet taste it's ""soft"" texture helps it feel very smooth in the mouth.  D - Goes down extremely easy for a 9% brew.  Notes: My favorite dessert beer. In fact, I first tried it last weekend when my sister and I cooked a little beer dinner when she was home visiting from Washington, DC. W paired beers with different copursed. Since we both suck at preparing deserts, the Trois Pistoles was the dessert. I enjoyed it with a nice Don diego cigar and it was a great experience. I highly recommend you try i.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Belgian Dark Strong Ale,94
22,30,MrBen,4.7,"Trois Pistoles is superb. The bottle's label promises fruit, and the beer brings it to the drinker with complexity and without going overboard. Trois Pistoles is what happens when the grains, hops, and yeast all work together in harmony. Color, smell, taste, mouthfeel, and finish are all first rate -- and they work nicely with the 9% ABV. Everything tastes balanced and natural.  I had to force myself to sip, because I really wanted the glass to last forever.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Belgian Dark Strong Ale,94
22,30,BEERchitect,4.08,"From a burgudy pour, Trios Pistoles delivers a lively carbonated pour, releasing an egg shell white head that though short, leaves great lacing and lasts the entire session wiht a delicate sheet of foam. Both bold and elegant.  Vinous and fruity in aroma, the beer leads with grape, raspberries, blueberries, and black currants. The spicy yeast gives elements of white pepper and a mimic of oak-aged tanins.  Flavors are ester forward with the same fruits found in the nose. Aided with candied fruits of berries, grapes, and currants, the malts also give a fruitcake or rum-soaked cake taste that is both complex and rounded. Spices of orange peel, corriander, and anise also decorate the peppery phenols in an intricate way (in only a way that the ommition of hops can give, and is also characteristic of great Belgian ales).  The body is almost sticky-sweet up front but with a quick drying period midway through. But then the beer dries out swiftly and wonderfully with only a whisper of the sweet malts and deep esters that started it all. Fruity aftertastes remind me of Cabernet wines. Lovely through and through.  Trios Pistoles is a wonderful beer that can't quite rival the great Westvleteren or Rocheforts but settle in nicely behind the St. Bernardus Abt. 12's and Westmalle's. A joy to drink any day, and for the price a bargin.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Belgian Dark Strong Ale,94
22,30,battlekow,3.6,"Pours a deep, dark, cloudy brown with an immense, off-white, Nerf-like head. Five minutes later, I was finally able to get the rest of the bottle into the pint glass. Once the head fades to normal levels, 3P is quite a pretty beer. Smells and tastes pretty similar to the North Coast Pranqster I just had: yeast, cloves, citrus. Also: dark fruits, anise, and a touch of mustard? More phenol, and no toastedness here. Extremely sweet. Mouthfeel is nice, but this beer is just a touch too candied for me.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Belgian Dark Strong Ale,94
22,30,Bonhoeffer,4.15,"This one came out of the same 4 pack as the other bottle i recently reviewed, but something's amiss. Either i was in la la land when i had the other one and just didn't notice the carbonation, or this one somehow got too much sugar/malt added at bottling time.  Carbonation on this one was NUTS. Like a Coke it was. The bubbles burned and made it difficult for my taste buds to appreciate the amazing flavor of this beer. Wayyy overdone. Don't know what happened, but the fizz on this really detracted from the experience. Hope it was just a fluke. I have one more i shall consume at a later date to test...",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Belgian Dark Strong Ale,94
22,30,silver0rlead,4.33,"Pours an incredibly dark brown, very close to pitch black with a nice tan head that retains well enough for a 9% beer...looks magnificent in my chimay chalice. Aroma is very nice, dark fruits (grape, plum), sweet candied sugar, some light grassy hops and slight traces of phenols. Flavor is very complex, notes of ripe grape and plum, spices (corriander and black pepper), dry grassy hops flavor and a sweet candied sugar flavor. Extremely well balanced, complex and delicious, and a bargain at $1.75 for a 12oz single. Mouthfeel is suprisingly light for the style but makes it very drinkable, with moderate carbonation.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Belgian Dark Strong Ale,94
22,30,HochFliegen,4.47,Poured this beer into a chalice style glass. Nice thin head with a dark ruby red clolor. Smell was very much like chocolate and plums. The taste was amazing smooth for the alchol content. Very well hidden for a 9%abv beer. Very light in the hops and very smooth finish make this beer a true winner.,Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Belgian Dark Strong Ale,94
22,30,BeerNutta,3.9,Trois Pistoles is the third of the Unibroue range that I have had the pleasure of tasting.  A = Dark dark ruby/brown. With a thin head.  S = Dark Chocolate. You get the feeling that this beer is a little dark?  T = Dark (Once again) chocolate with hints of fig & plums. Definetly a sipping beer. You can taste a hint of alcohol. Not as much as the maudite.  M = Normal. Neither good nor bad.  D = Pretty good. Its a bit expensive though.,Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Belgian Dark Strong Ale,94
22,30,RedHaze,4,"Poured a very dark brown, with two finger thick head, that slowly faded to a good cap that lasted for the entire time that I enjoyed this beer.  Smells of plums, mild apples, slighlty doughy and earthy.  Taste is sweet dark fruits, yeasty, with some of the earthy tones in there. Very smooth, rich beer. I could barely pick up any alcohol in the smell or taste, even with the 9% abv.  Kind of a heavy beer to have more that one or two of, but very good.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Belgian Dark Strong Ale,94
22,30,tgbljb,4.67,"poured a deep brown color with foamy tan head. Some particles of yeast notes. Smell is deeply fruity with prunes, rainins, figs noted. Also a hint of burning wood. Taste is absolutely suberp with toasted malt, prunes, raisins and all sorts of things that I can't describe but that taste great. Finished fantastically pleasant with no nint of alcohol present. This is a mighty beer.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Belgian Dark Strong Ale,94
22,30,bubrewer,4.53,"12oz screw top bottle.  Well carbonated; pours with a moussy head that stands above the rim of the glass. Brilliantly clear mahogany color when carefully decanted; I unfortunately did not carefully decant at the end so I have a cloudy glass in front of me.  Aroma seems muted, sort of bready raisins; a little sweet. very pleasing.  Flavor is beautully complex, with no single component brashly stepping to the front. All players are working in harmony. Taste is a combination of leather, raisin, plum, carmelly malt sweetness.  Carbonation level makes this dance on the tongue. Slight alcohol burn adds a nice level of complexity to the flavor.  Although the 9% strength prevents this being a session beer, a single bottle is a beautiful companion on a cool fall day, sipped slowly, enjoyed through all its changing character as it warms.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Belgian Dark Strong Ale,94
22,30,mrasskicktastic,4.08,"A - Deep burgundy with a thick frothy tan head that lingers relentlessly. Swirl bottle, add yeast - no change. Small amount of lacing.  S - Slight vinous character, malty molasses and wheat underneath. A little gumball. Not a strong odor, but good.  T - A dry wine flavor, grapes, blackberries and raspberries, and a slightly sweet, very malty molasses character mesh rather well. Abv is detectable, but not dominant.  M - Moderate viscosity, smooth and refreshing.  D - Nice. Goes down really easily, could be drank all night, just like all other Unibroue beers I've tried. They seem pretty good at that. Delicious, would pair well with foods.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Belgian Dark Strong Ale,94
22,30,Golden2wenty1,4.83,"Picked up a single at Whole Foods Market here in Madison. My first Unibroue...uhhh....brew.  Pours a murky, dark, cloudy, rusty mahogany that only allows the faintest light to pass through the edges below a sturdy off-white head that vanishes under the 9% abv weight. Smell is...well, Belgian...dark fruits, sweet malts, a bit of olive. Taste....wow....starts off like a good Belgian dark, plums and raisins abound, but instead of the funky, alcoholic olive aftertaste I've grown accustomed to in a Belgian, I was greated with a sweet, crisp fruity/malty aftertaste that really sat well with me. Very subtle, but that's why it's so brilliant and mysterious. Mouthfeel is crisp and refreshing, drinkable to no end. This beer really crept up on me. Its unassuming start transitioned into a real treat. This beer somehow makes it into my top three all-time. Kudos, Canada.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Belgian Dark Strong Ale,94
22,30,Noxious26,3.63,"341ml bottle poured in a snifter at Bottlescrew Bill's in Calgary.  Very dark, black almost opaque appearance. Small 1/4 inch beige head is full of tiny bubbles and recedes to a thin layer across the top.  The first thing that hits me with the aroma is a strong lemon/citrus scent. Almost smells like lemon scent Mr. Clean. Fruity and sweet undertones pop in now and again.  Taste is of ripe dark fruit, berries and a duel between alcohol and sweetness. Difficult to discern where to go from start to middle to finish as it all kind of blends together. Sweet fruit aftertaste lingers awhile. There is a cough syrup element to this.  Mouthfeel is thin and fizzy. Almost like pop, but not quite as fizzy as champagne.  This isn't the kind of beer that you can just swig back at random. More of a sipping beverage, plan for this to last awhile. While it is interesting, I didn't really find it very refreshing. I was actually quite tired of it by the time I got through the bottle (I'm glad it wasn't a big one).",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Belgian Dark Strong Ale,94
22,30,Gritsak,3.95,"A- deep black that shows some reddish brown when held up to the light. thich offwhite head that ends up as a thin film at the top of the beer.  S- sweet fruity smell. some berry and apple hints come out. light aroma of alcohol  T- lots of bitter sweet fruit flavor. some hops tingling on the finish with a strong after taste of burnt/roasted flavor.  M- medium body with meduim carbonation. not overly thick but not at all watery. smooth and creamy yet decently carbonated.  D- the strong flavor hurts this a bit, but you can expect that with most high abv/flavor beers.  overall- very well balanced and smooth flavor. after taste is a bit strong and lingering, but it doesnt hurt it to much. very refreshing depsite the 9%.

22,30,burnstar,4.16,Pours black with a very thick frothy tan head. Smells like sweet berries with just a faint hint of yeast and alcohol. Taste is initially roasted malt with lots of fruit complexity. The taste lingers for a while - very nice finish. There is also a little bit of yeatiness present but very little sign of alcohol except for the pleasant warming effect. This has a very good mouthfeel. It's heavy and creamy. Coats the mouth and is a joy to drink from my goblet - that wonderful head persists forever. This is quite tastey but it's not stuff I would want to drink all night. Definitely needs to warm up a bit for all it's flavors to come through.,Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Belgian Dark Strong Ale,94
22,30,DogFood11,3.88,"I Brought out this big dog for a nightcapper. Nice label that is typical of Unibroue. 750ml poured into a tulip and produced a magnificent 3 finger head that laid down to a solid finger throughout. Nice ring lacing and head tan in color. Dark Belgian is exactly that in this fine brew, Dark Brown to the point of 0 visibility.  Dark fruits and yeasty up front with a heavy malt backbone.. Metallic/medicinal evident and was unfortunate but it was subtle and not disturbing. Warming alcohol smell was evident (bonus). Unibroue brings us some fine brews. I guess Canada is actually worth having around as long as this brewery is alive and well.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Belgian Dark Strong Ale,94
22,30,ViveLaChouffe,4.32,"From 330ml bottle.  Pours a deep opaque brown with a frothy tan head. Smells fruity, mostly of plum and other dark fruit. Vanilla and molasses. Sweet spice, clove.  Taste is quite malty and yeasty. Lightly tart apple and plum. Vanilla, spicy like pepper and coriander. Lightly bitter in the finish. Mouth is rich and lightly sticky. Good stuff, I can never do the Unibroue beers justice with my words.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Belgian Dark Strong Ale,94
22,30,Albinoh,4.73,"Dark color, very decent head, foamy with bubbles. Sweet smell, malt, and a touch of caramel and fruits. Amazing taste, thick mouthfeel but not execive, the alcohol is very well hidden behind the sweet flavor. Caramel, a little bit of chocolate and the fruity-like flavor make this beer really desirable. The flavor stays in your mouth for a while letting you remeber the complexity of the beer you have just tasted.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Belgian Dark Strong Ale,94
22,30,fisherman34,3.9,"Brownish purple in colour, with a fair amount of carbonation. Lots of yeast, spice, and dark berry fruits on the nose. Very yeasty flavor profile as well, with the fruits taking on a sour note.

Very mellow indeed.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Belgian Dark Strong Ale,94
22,30,phishgator,4.32,"Poured into a tulip glass, lots of foamy head. A creamy quality that doesn't dissipate. The taste is sweet candi sugar and malt. There is a fruity twang to the aftertaste, which stays with you for some time. I believe that due to the aftertaste the mouthfeel suffers a little. The alcohol is there, though it is not up front.

22,30,DrunkMcDermott,4.04,"I came to this beer the long way around. This was one of the beers tapped at the Oak Lawn ""Fall on the Green"" Festival the weekend. My homebrew club, BOSS, volunteers to pour the ""good"" beers, in return, we get to keep the leftovers for our picnic the following weekend (the village buys the beer, and their license is only good for the three days. If we didnt take it, theyd have had to pour it out! Sacré!). I couldnt make the picnic, but came in Sunday to help clean up, and this was still flowing! So after all that...  Pours a lovely brown. By this time, the head is kicking up pretty frothily, understandably. Has a great taste that to me gave just a light impression of cherries, likely from the yeast. Also a well-balanced spiciness that stays in the background for support. Overall great malty taste. This probably wasnt the best condition for trying it out in, but it held up very well. I even filled a growler for later!",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Belgian Dark Strong Ale,94

It's a staple in my fridge.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Belgian Dark Strong Ale,94
22,30,karengarys,4.38,"I am VERY surprised by this beer!  This pours a dark mahogany with sediment (floaties). It leaves a head which dissipates in a few minutes, but leaves a fluffy ring and a bit of an island.  The smell is sweet. Floral. Maybe a bit of pete. Some other sweetness.  The taste is quite rich. The alcolhol is quite well hidden, for the most forefront tastes are malts with fizzy hops. Vanilla. Honey. Cinnamon? The hops balance it well, very laid back but present.  The mouthfeel is nice and creamy.  The finish is nice and clean/dry, and the alcohol is noticed on the way down, but not in an unruly fashion.  The body is nice and light, yet rich. I do not like lighter body beers because they leave me yearning for something that doesn't exist. This is lightish, yet is very rich and full.  I do recommend finding this and giving it a try - I am buying a few more!  Update, actually for my own notes on 6/7/2013 - my wife didn't care for it, the spices were too strong and it had a bitter finish bite to her that made it difficult to drink. I did not edit anything from the original review in 2005, but I think it is a bit thinner than noted in my original review. I guess the rest is pretty much the same.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Belgian Dark Strong Ale,94
22,30,ejquin,4.48,"App: Chesnut with white head that fades quick. Provides some lacing.  Smell: Nicely phenolic and yeasty. Typical belgian sweetness.  Taste: Very very nice. The first thought I had was that the alcohol is perfectly balanced in this beer. It's just there enough for you to know your drinking a serious beer, but it's never harsh or overbearing.There's a bit of hop spiciness up front which is followed by nuts and finishes with brown sugar. Alcohol provides some warmth as the beer goes down.  Mouth: Nice and smooth. Touch light maybe but still nice.  Drink: excellent for a 9% abv.  Overall: I felt like this beer was just turned down a smige from the true belgian classics like St. Bernardus and Westy. The taste smell and mouthfeel were all just slightly below those two, but I would put this right behind those two, and that's saying a lot. This is definitely a beer I will have again and again.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Belgian Dark Strong Ale,94
22,30,Pepeton,4.7,"I just love Unibroue!  Bought this one in a supermarket for a real bargain, not dirt cheap, but still a bargain. Maybe it's a marketing strategy to place this brewery in the palate of Mexicans. I hope.  Pours a dark amber brew, with an impressive tan head that stayed for a while.  Smell is complex: Ripe fruits, spices, some maltiness in there too, and yeast. Swirl the glass and more aroma comes out.  Taste is quite Belgian, sweet, a bit tart and robust.  Mouthfeel is creamy, with a dry aftertaste due to the 9%ABV.  I could drink this one anytime, but I live in México and the weather is always a factor. Trois Pistoles is more for my winters, when the temperature drops maybe to the lower 40s (the last 15 days the minimum was 72° early one morning and highs around 110°).",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Belgian Dark Strong Ale,94
22,30,Naes,3.24,"Appearance is super cloudy brown with a frothy white head (slight lacing)  Smells a bit fruity and malty.  The taste is mildly sweet with a faint flavor of hops in the aftertaste. They did a marvelous job of masking the alcohol flavor for 9% ABV.  Mouth feel is light and highly carbonated.  Drinkability is low due to its high carbonation and ABV.  This one is a good beer, but nothing in the flavor department really stands out to make it a unique brew.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Belgian Dark Strong Ale,94
22,30,scooter231,3.95,"Yum, yum, yum. Unibroue makes me so happy.  Pours a dark, rich looking reddish/brownish color with a lot of tan head that dwindles down to a lovely ring around the edge of the glass. Smells grassy, earthy. Sweet, but not too much so. Definitely some chocolate in there and caramel.  Tastes lovely. A fabulous sweet fruityness to it, mostly grape and raisin, followed by a hint of citrus. Very flavorful- also traces of spices in here, herbalness. So much going on, but on a subtle level that's all well balanced. I can sense and taste the alcohol, but it adds to and helps, rather than hinders, the flavor. It helps the mouthfeel and gives you a lovely warming feeling.  The carbonation is plentiful, which I personally enjoy, and plays on your palate, adding a necessary lightness to this otherwise sweet and slightly heavy beer. Completely adds balance to it. Helps the drinkability factor, and makes each sip burst on your tongue. A sweet treat.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Belgian Dark Strong Ale,94
22,30,GCBrewingCo,4.7,"The beer poured into the chalice crystal clear dark brown with amber highlights. The head was tan and frothy and fell slowly to lace the glass.  The aroma was dark fruits, prunes and plums with raisins and grapes. The aroma also contained a citrusy note. The Belgian yeast left a light spiciness which added complexity to the aroma. Dark caramel maltiness also existed in the aroma.  The flavor was creamy with dark fruits, raisins, prunes, plums and more grapes. Also present was a deep maltiness and dark caramel flavors. After the fruits and malt fade on the palate a distinct orange citrus flavor emerged. Alcohol was present in the flavor, but added complexity to the beer.  The finish was every so slightly sweet and malty with a candy flavor of grape and dark fruits with a lasting light spice and citrus. The body was above medium, but not quite medium full and creamy due to the carbonation. Very complex and very well done!  750 ml bottle. 2004 stenciled on bottle.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Belgian Dark Strong Ale,94
22,30,TPSReports,3.9,Large 22oz corked and caged bottle.  Pours a deep dark burgendy color. Airy foamy head of tan appears and dissiapates to about 1/8 inch.  Smells wonderful -- very malty with apples and strawberries.  Very carbonated feel on the tongue. Maybe a bit of a sloppy pour that didn't let enough gas out? I don't know.  Slightly bitter at first. This beer is warming up! Carmel flavors are coming alive on the second glass. I just raised taste from 3.5 ro 4.0. Yeehaw!,Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Belgian Dark Strong Ale,94
22,30,Cwrw,4.12,"Trois Pistoles has always been my favourite of the Unibroue labels; a true work of art, and somehow nothing less would do for this beer. Classy, elegant, with an almost sacred air surrounding these bottles of Trois Pistoles. In the glass TP is a very dark, almost deep purple colour. Held to a light it is dark brown. It looks thick and inpenetrable, appearing black from a distance. The head is light beige and brown, leaving large bubbles of lace. The head from this particular bottle was not that large, and actually I have found the head a little inconsistent for TP, but this is still a magnificent looking beer. The aroma is musty and exceptionally complex. From above the rim I can detect some maltiness mixed with charcoal and black licorice. In closer is where all the fruitiness exists, and the detectable but not overpowering phenols. Red grapes, grapejuice, black currants, figs, dark malts and alcohol, baking bread, and a great balance of sweetness; a sugariness that is always there, but very subtle and a little hard to coax out of it. The website mentions aromas of chocolate, but I get very little, if any chocolate smells. Similar yeast aromas to the other Unibroues. I get red apples and faint pear aromas as well. Swirling the glass releases some saltiness, like a seasoning. The aroma is also quite spicy if you sniff close enough, and that combined with the 9% really can tickle the nose, and numb it. As it warmed I started to smell soil in the aroma. Taste at first is dusty sweetness of dark malt. Again I get a lot of grape taste up front, more fruits, horehound candy, and mollasses. The alcohol makes it presence known fairly rapidly, and it definitely lingers in the aftertaste. The finish also gives some cream and iron metallic tastes. The taste to me is much like a fortified grapejuice, but not exactly wine-like, because it is too sweet. There are definitely some cabernet or merlot flavours though, along with a little bitterness akin to tannins. And I do mean little: even for the style this possesses very little dryness. Full bodied and warming. Despite the volume of alcohol, very drinkable and absolutely stunning as an after dinner drink with a rich, sweet dessert. A beer that lives up to its label. This is a brew I love to introduce to people as one of Canada's best craft beers.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Belgian Dark Strong Ale,94
22,30,neonbrown82,4.26,"Thanks to fellow BA Chatter for the opportunity to taste yet another beautiful beer from Unibroue. I liked this one even better than the last.  The beer pours to a completely opaque black color with a perfectly formed head. It looks very appealing inside its tulip glass. The head on these Unibroue beers is absolutely mind-bogglingly perfect. The color of the beer seems to match the theme perfectly.  The smell is my only complaint with this beer. For a belgian style it is very subdued. I can pick up faint hints of phenolic berry scents along with a malty belgian candi sugar sweetness. Nothing too impressive here, though it does smell good for what it's worth.  The taste on the other hand is awesome. It has a dark candi sugar bias to it, but it isn't over-the-top sweet like many recent belgians I've had. It also sports a slight dark berry flavor to it along with some graininess and a mild spicy hop bite in the finish.  The beer isn't as dry as the La Fin Du Monde. Very impressive creamy mouthfeel, though. Also provides a great residual sugar taste in the finish. Drinkability is extraordinarily high considering this brew is so extraordinarily high in alcohol (which is quite well hidden by the way).",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Belgian Dark Strong Ale,94
22,30,waughbrew,4.8,"6/16/05 Re-Review Add-on: Deep dark peppery aroma, chocolate covered plum flavor, silky texture. This is one stunning beer.  4/26/04: Reddish auburn with a light beige head that sticks around for a minute before receding to a lacing. Smell screams unibroue with that house yeast of their's contributing great esters and phenolics. Also big are raisins, chocolate, and coriander. Plummy in the flavor with a very smooth long finish. Feels good, the carbonation bites just a bit on the sides of the tongue. A gorgeous beer, and almost too easy to drink.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Belgian Dark Strong Ale,94
22,30,palma,3.93,"Dark brown body with a short creamy looking off-white head that doesnt last long at all. Lace ring remains throughout the session. Prominent fruit aroma, particularly apple, raisin and plum. A very light dark malt smell as well. Little or no hop aroma. Taste is what carries this brew. Chocolate, molasses, brown sugar, with a tart and sweet fruit backbone. I taste apples big time in the end/aftertaste. The flavor is complex however it is still light and not as robust as I expected. Decent mouthfeel which is a little on the lighter side as well. I did find this beer to be very drinkable however. I finished off the 750 ml fairly quick and could definitely go for another.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Belgian Dark Strong Ale,94
22,30,danielharper,4,"Purchased from Strong Bros. Liquor, Fayetteville, TN.  My first Belgian -- I can see why they are so admired by BAs everywhere, even as I realize that they're probably not ever going to be an everyday beer for me.  Appearance: I poured this into an oversized wine glass/chalice that I borrowed from my fiancee's wine glass collection -- the whole 12oz bottle went into the glass and left me with enough room for a small tannish head, which dissipated quickly. The beer had a deep, dark purple appearance to me that I found quite intriguing and inviting -- I'd give this a five for appearance were it not for the minor head. The bottle design is also really nice; I really like the label, although I wish that brewers would stop using foil around the tops of the bottles.  Smell: Really fantastic aroma, very fruity -- almost like a tannic red wine in its complexity. This is the first beer I've ever sniffed in which the faint scent of alcohol is apparent in the nose, but even that worked well with the overall aroma. Very nice.  Taste: Much like the smell, only more so. Bold, almost overwhelming levels of fruit with a dry, almost bitter aftertaste. Washing it around the mouth reveals all kinds of flavors that seem to only interact with certain parts of the tongue. As the beer warmed I found that the fruitiness started to fade, while the bitterness got stronger but still pleasant. The bitter taste almost reminded me of a stout, high praise from me.  Mouthfeel: Very thick, very creamy, very nice. Despite the minimal head I found this beer to have a foaminess to it that I enjoyed.  Drinkability: Why so low? While this beer is very nice, I don't think I could drink more than one of these at a sitting. Partially this is due to the alcohol content, but for me it's less drinkable simply due to the fact that it tastes so much like wine -- an overall ""wine"" flavor actually makes me sick if I have too much of it. Perhaps this is a bit unfair, but I do feel that drinkability ratings should be based on the reviewer's own personal preference.  Overall, I think this is a really nice beer, one that I will probably buy again. It certainly makes me want to try other Belgians. But the three I've got left in my closet will likely last me a little while, as I don't intend to drink these too terribly often. Your wine-drinking friends might find this to be an ""in"" to good beer, however.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Belgian Dark Strong Ale,94
22,30,Dithyramb,4.22,"Sampled last night on draft at Max's on Broadway.  Pours slightly thick with a thin off-white head that dissipates to a ring that grabs the side of the glass. Head retention not as nice as with the bottle, but has the excellent lacing. Slightly burned caramel color that is hazy to an almost translucent nature.  Yeast and malt fill the nose.  A great tasting, chewy beer. A light bit of yeast pepper is accented with chocolate, coffee, raisins and the other dark malts mixed with bready goodness. The alcohol is wandering around in the dark corners.  Drinkable? Oh, yeah.This mighty brew beat down the flavors from a smoked salmon chowder and came bursting through in the tastebuds. It is a definite contenda and should be exhulted with the other big Belgians out there.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Belgian Dark Strong Ale,94
22,30,Wonka,4.41,"355 ML 9% alc./vol. BEST BEFORE 04-04-05 (sampled over 2 months past the date)  Appearance  slightly cloudy, mostly brown/bit red body; initial inch-thick, off-white head crackles away quickly; lace isnt present; age seems to have taken a negative effect here for head and lace seem to be more impressive in younger bottles reviewed by others  Smell medicinal notes run lower than the prevalent plum; big on malts  Taste  yeast emerges and some spice kicks in; dark fruit holds strong and a bit of a caramely tone arrives; pleasant medicinal and slight alcoholic qualities come through in the aftertaste  Mouthfeel & Drinkability  brew comes alive; crisp, micronized bubbles coat the tongue and almost make the entire distance of the sip but they peel back just enough at the finish line to aid in drinkability; for such a big Belgian, this aged beast rolled smoothly  Very enjoyable.

22,30,sinistermadman,4.43,"Poured from the 25.4 oz bomber this brew pours a cloudy brown with an extreme (right after opening) pillowy head. Head soon settles to a nice lace and retains quite well throughtout the drink.  Smell: Very organic, that is about all I can declare.  Carbonation introduces the palate to a multitude of flavors. Taste hints at sweet fruit. Alcohol warms the face and the spicyness of the brew. Not overbearing, but well balanced for a brew of this potency. Another Unibroue gem.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Belgian Dark Strong Ale,94
22,30,Frozensoul327,3.5,"Poured out to a dark amber red color with a nice head. Medium to medium/low carbonation. Aroma of dark fruit, spices and herbs were most present. Flavor was complex, with overtones of fruit, cocoa, spice and burnt brown sugar. Very nice. Thick mouthfeel, like i'm almost drinking thin pancake syrup. Finished smooth with a nice sweet smoke aftertaste. Nice brew from Unibroue. Wouldn't drink more than one in a sitting, as it goes down a bit on the heavy side. Nevertheless, a good beer. Recommended.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Belgian Dark Strong Ale,94
22,30,TastyTaste,4.6,"A fountain soon after the cap is popped. Body is dark brown, making this almost impenetrable to light. Not much of a head, just a small ring around the glass, with an uneven layer in the middle. Smell is fruity and dark, with rum and raisin present. Taste is crisp and murky, with a good amount of hops, and dark fruit flavors abounding. Crisp mouthfeel, with good hops and body. An excellent beer with lots of unique character. There are better offerings from Unibroue.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Belgian Dark Strong Ale,94
22,30,NiceGuyMike,3.36,"Dark ruby red with medium head which fizzles out in a minute. Smells of ""dark"" malts and alcohol.  Tastes of thick malts, molasses and dark caramels. This brew is a bit too heavy of a flavor for my tastes. Alcohol makes itself known throughout the tasting experience, but does not dominate. A medium bodied brew but I wasnt anxious to finish the 750ml I had.  Notes: Im not terribly impressed. Ive tried a few strong dark Belgians and I have mixed feelings. This has a bit of a sour aftertaste. Not sure what to make of that.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Belgian Dark Strong Ale,94
22,30,smcolw,3.92,"Here's an honest confession: I rate all of the beers I try, not against each other, but how much I enjoy them. That said, this is not a style I typically seek out, but I can still appreciate the effort that went into this one.  Appearance: dark cloudy brown with a long lasting thin head. No lace.  Smell: Malty, as would be expected. I enjoy the spiciness (corriander?) in the aroma. I am pleasantly surprised by pleasant yeast smells. Typically, I find that these detract rather than contribute (like this one).  Taste: More sweet than alcohol oily. In fact, this is rich and full-bodied even for the style. Strong candy sugar flavors and virtually no hop. This brew has an unusually high carbonation. Again, the yeast adds pleasant flavors and a touch of spiciness.  I would say that the body is the strongest attribute. I am also surprised at the lack of apparent alcohol, although this ale has 9% content.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Belgian Dark Strong Ale,94
22,30,santoslhalper,4.15,"Appereance: Pours a gorgeous dark reddish-brown with a thick, creamy beige head.  Smell: The smell is wonderuflly fruity and sweet with huge caramel malt notes.  Taste and Mouthfeel: The taste is super sweet and super spicy, with a strong alcohol presense kinda ublanaces the brew a little. The flavors are tasty as hell, and even more complex, but I think it could be more balanced. The mouthfeel is a little fizzy, but quite full.  Drinkability and Overall: This beer is roughly 6 months old, and it's wonderful now, but I had one recently that was just over 2 years old and it was superb. The best state it's been in. I can't wait till this gets older.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Belgian Dark Strong Ale,94
22,30,Bierschenker,4.87,"My first Canadian and very convincing. I had this one on the twentieth of May 2005 at the Delirium Café. The TP has a very dark amber-red colour with a thin white head that seems to stay. I got this one served in a Unibroue Tulip glass. It has a very strong odour that reminds my of malt, raisins, dark chocolate and bitter tones. In contrast to the violent smell, the beer tastes very gentle and mild. Almost as soft and subtle as silk. A Chocolate and malt taste with a cold creamy aftertaste. And traces of citrus fruit and spices. Not a lot of carbonation. The mouth feel is very gentle, like drinking the cream on top of a cappuccino. The strong dark ale is my favourite type of beer and for the moment this is the best beer I have ever had in that category.  Ut Vivat, Crescat, Floreat!",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Belgian Dark Strong Ale,94
22,30,kingjames1,3.73,"Poured out of a 12oz bottle, perfect color, dark amber-brown -- anticipating a great strong ale. The head is really impressive on this one. In fact, quarter-way through, I still have a beautiful tan head going. Excellent!  The smell is good, though a tad weaker than I'd expected. Plums, maybe prunes, chocolate, some definite maltiness, and those distinctive yeasty Belgium spices.  The tast is faithful to the aromas, though stronger of course. First, shades of dark red plum, chocolate cherries -- definitely port-like. Then there are the rich spices, and then, and I am slightly disappointed here, an over-sweetness (almost reminds me of the nauseating twinge in artificial sweetners). Seems slightly unbalanced to me. Lastly comes that warming alcohol sensation (not surprising at 9%). Good, but not fantastic.  Good amount of carbonation - perfect for this brew.  This is pretty drinkable given the alcohol content, thinkness and complexity. Definitely a slow sipping beer of course. And given the slightly cloying sweetness, I'm not very interested in more than one at this point. Perhaps this bottle was a little off??? Or maybe it needed to age a little more? I'll try another one in a year or so to give it (and myself) another chance.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Belgian Dark Strong Ale,94
22,30,WetCoaster,3.87,"Appearance: Deep brown with a foamy tan head that bursts toward the top of the glass. Loosens up quickly, but sits there for quite a while. Very active carbonation. Sticky lace.  Smell: Rich and spicy. Dark malt and a nice Belgian spiciness. Tart fruit; peach? A bit of alcohol. Yeast pepper. Very nice.  Taste/Mouthfeel: Not what I expected. A tart fruitiness off the bat, very crisp and pale. Midpalette, a deep rich cake spice, brown bread and honey. Sour and vinous in the finish. The mouthfeel is oddly thin and crisp.  Drinkability: It's a good beer, but, IMO, it's not that exciting. I'll admit it's hard to believe it's 9%; the alcohol is very well concealed. Otherwise, a bit light-bodied for a BSDA and tad bland -- not their best.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Belgian Dark Strong Ale,94
22,30,Hunter,3.71,"Beer is a deep ruby red in color. Thick head of dense foam that nevertheless dissipates fast. No lacing/carfbonation to speak of.  Aroma is powerfully alcoholic. Sharp phenols, cola, berry notes play a supporting role. Deep, rich, and complex, but wow - the alcohol is like getting slapped with a 2X4.  Given the aroma I was pleasantly surprised how mellow and smooth the taste is. The alcohol is there, yes, but it gives equal time to a smoky, almost brnady-like nuance that warms one to the toes. Underlying notes of coffee, woody/nutty, and berry flavors. Mouthfeel is sharp and light from the carbonation. Aftertaste clings to the tongue with a certain bitterness but nothing to distracting.  A lovely beer all around. I'm thinking paired best with beef or pasta. would make a great winter warmer.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Belgian Dark Strong Ale,94
22,30,Litterbean,4.37,"750 ml bottle with best before date clearly marked ""7-15-06,"" so I had some time to enjoy this one, but why wait?  This beer is extremely murky looking. Dank, dark, brown, like the sludge from the moat that might surround the imposing fortress on the label. A minimal amount of head forms and disappears, leaving this muddy brew to sit and taunt me while waiting to taste it.  Deep fruity aromas in the nose with hints of spicy cloves. There is a predominant yeast smell. Very sweet and inviting, but mellow at the same time making this one pleasant brew to sniff.  What a sweet beer this is. The alcohol is very well hidden behind the fruity esters prominent within. There is almost a spicy cinnamon-like warmth present, along with ample amounts of pear, prunes, plums, raisins, apple, and some citrus. A real nice fruit cocktail, I'll give it that. A bit of a dry finish with some slight bitterness. Some chalkiness from the yeast but it's pleasant.  Really nice mouthfeel. Light carbonation and a smooth creamy body. I could go for another one once I'm done. I'll grab another bottle soon I'm sure.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Belgian Dark Strong Ale,94
22,30,Gaisgeil,4.32,"Very, very nice brew, quite delicate in a way, subtle layers of flavoring combining for a powerful and rich overall effect. Pours a deep brown with red tones, quite hazy accompanied by a thin but cream tan head. A nice bready character going on, with a nice rich malt overtone. Bits of dark fruit making appearances. At times this one reminded me of a nice port in certain ways. A nice hop bitterness balances things out nicely, but the thickness of the malts seem to be the prevailing theme here.  A nice treat indeed. Probably my favorite brew from this brewery.  Slàinte!",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Belgian Dark Strong Ale,94
22,30,RenoZymurgist,3.88,Poured a rich dark reddish brown with an offwhite head the writhed a frothed for awhile then it settled into a thick creamy layer of tan foam. The aroma was alcoholic with a clovey spicyness and a touch of dark fruit. The flavor was very dry in the malt department with a very nice fruity flavor and a spicy undertone that finished very clean. The mouthfeel was of an average viscosity for a brew of this high of a gravity and the carbonation was soft yet lent a bit of a refreshing sharpness though not as clean in the finish as maudite. Nice beer to have at the end of the night however if i was given the choice I would probably go for a maudite instead.,Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Belgian Dark Strong Ale,94
22,30,BeerFink,4.73,"Cracking the bottle and decanting into my tulip leaves me with a beautiful ale, potent in appearance. Color at first appears black, with a dominating white head. Further inspection reveals the hue to be closer to a very dark brownish garnet. Powerful estery aroma of blended tropical and dark fruits, a zing of citrous hops, and a little bready malt. Slight wine-like character to the nose. Taste is an interesting blend of dark and light malts, slight breadiness and yeastiness. Nice dark fruits and berries in the flavor, think red wine with lots of malt. The more this beer warms, the more wine-like qualities come out - very tasty. Zesty hops tantalize the tongue with orange peels and lemons. Hops come in big and bold, but aren't able to dominate the huge malt bill. The hops relinquish their hold on your palate; the flavor moving back to huge creamy malt with a little bread and some alcohol. Finish is has some chewy malt, and is slightly acidic, but is mostly dry and vinous. Wickedly drinkably and devilishly delicious.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Belgian Dark Strong Ale,94
22,30,elricorico,4.47,"Pours out cola brown with a thin tan head. The head has bubbled off and left a ring around the glass.  Smell is subtle yet complex. Dark fruits, alcohol, black licorice, and pepper are in there. Probably a lot more as well.  Sweet up front with a malty mix of ripe dark fruits. From there comes a bit of smoke and peppery spice. Finally followed by a tart finish with a wisp of alcohol. From start to finish there is a bounty of flavour. This brew obviously well crafted.  Mouthfeel is excellent, has some body to it and a nice carbonation that only enhances the drink. This is a big brew that drinks as easily as one could hope, almost daring you to have more and more.  Excellent beer. One to keep around.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Belgian Dark Strong Ale,94
22,30,IceAce,4.42,"This chestnut brown beauty simply defies one to pin it down stylistically. Boasting the funky nose of a saison and complete with hints of spices and Belgian yeast, this brew has the quality color of a Trappist dubble and is simply a joy...sip after sip.  Leading with a slightly fizzy open, the barnyard funky yeast is the first to appear. Midtaste deposits a nice malty note smack in the middle of the tongue.  The finish is clean with a sinful saison-like fade of yeast. Wow!",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Belgian Dark Strong Ale,94
22,30,FLAbeergutinMASS,3.9,"This introduction to the Unibroue line of beers continues to be impressive. Trois Pistoles is labeled as dark and strong. They're not lying. Pours a deep blood red, very dark. Smells of plums and brandy, the most pungent aspect is the overpowering alcohol smell-not a bad thing! Taste is pretty typical of a bottle-conditioned ale, musty, tart but sweet. Sickly ale all-round a very strong, not a beer to be taken lightly.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Belgian Dark Strong Ale,94
22,30,mgdeth,4.17,"Appearance - Rocky off-white head sits atop this dark brown beer. Head dissipate fairly quickly. When held up to the light, there is some serious bubbling going on. Much darker than Maudite.  Smell - Rich malt is the dominant smell. There is some phenolic spiciness, but not the tainted homebrew type.  Taste - Something about this beer makes me think of Thanksgiving or Christmas dinner. The flavor is sweet overall, with just a shade of tartness, something like cranberris or darl cherries. For comparison, this beer has stronger yet cleaner taste than Maudite.  Mouthfeel - Highly carbonated. Strong body, which, when you look at the beer, matches it very well.  Drinkability - The flavor is rich, the alcohol is high -- this is no session beer. Howver, this stuff is pretty enjoyable.  Comments - This beer is better than I remember. Recommended.

22,30,peterthepiper,4.37,"Trois Pistoles (750 mL bottle) opened with dark grey vapour tendrils after uncorking. The first pour resulted in a persistent white head of 2-3 cm leaving considerable lacing. The color was almost a hazelnut brown and not very penetrable to light.  The nose was quite light, sweet with fruity notes. Tasting it, the beer was viscous, likely due to the high alcohol content, and the fruity notes evident in the nose were also in the palate as well as a a slight lingering sweetness. Trois Pistoles was quite carbonated yet quite smooth during drinking.  Watch out for this one though! The 9% volume is a killer.

T- malt flavor is present but not as strong as I imagined from the aroma. Slight clove taste at the finish. The finish is pretty dry with a slight hint of hops.  M- medium body with a slight fizziness in the finish. no astringency or alcoholic warmth.

22,30,longarm,4,"12 oz bottle.  A dark brew with tints of red, this pours with a quickly burning head that settles into a thin layer of lingering carbonation and mild lacing.  Aroma has brief initial elements of candied sugar, followed by doses of figs and green apples.  Bold and complex, it's difficult to disentangle all of the different aspects of flavor in this. I sense a load of spices, that seems like some weird combination of pepper, cloves, cinnamon and cardamom. Candied sugar rears itself again, initially dominating the palate, but disappearing behind a touch of hot alcohol.  The finish is sweet...maybe just a touch on the sour side, but the lingering aftertaste of hot alcohol and hops tends to beat another sip out of me. I think it might be hard to drink a lot of these, but only because it's so incredibly complex.  Lke another Unibroue ale that I had this evening, I enjoyed this with cambozola and lox. It's a finely suited beer to pair with any pungent cheese.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Belgian Dark Strong Ale,94
22,30,asabreed,4.7,"12 oz. bottle from a 4-pack. Best before 08/25/07 on the back.  Appearance: Beautifully hazy and dark brown. Gorgeous, slowly thinning white head forming around the top of the glass. Nice beads of lacing sustaining as it goes down as I drink.  Smell: Amazing. Fruit and and malt and sweetness and candi sugar up front. Some extremely slight hints of dark chocolate. Dark cherries and malt. Faint banana. Some orange zest.  Taste: Carries through very well from the aromas. Malts and sugars are apparent initially, though much is discovered in the fantastic aftertaste. This has one of the best aftertastes I've had the pleasure of enjoying.  Mouthfeel: Medium-bodied and extremely creamy. One of the most pleasurable beers that has graced my palette.  Drinkability: I don't want to have more than one at a time because it's so goddamn good. Thankfully I have 3 more left, and I'm on my way to buying another 4-pack or more. Would love to see this does in the cellar; if it's this good now I have no doubt in a few years that I'd probably be giving a 5 to every category.  Unibroue is slowly becoming one of my favorite breweries, and this Trois Pistoles is only perpetuating this.

Cherry flavors with lots of spice to go with a dry mouthfeel. ABV is high but well hidden, and it can sneak up on your pretty quickly. This is my first Unibroue brew, and I'm really impressed. The flavor is so complex and deep, and the aftertaste, which the bottle describes as port, is pleasant and lingering. A great selection.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Belgian Dark Strong Ale,94
22,30,ommegangpbr,4.35,"This has been the third bottle of something from Unibroue that I've tried and the first one that didn't turn out to be flat; bought a La Terrible that was completely flat and a Maudite that was on its way to flatness... finally I have a proper bottle so I can score their product fairly! (these three bottles were purchased from two different distributors). I'm glad that the third time proved to be a charm because I probably would have given up had this bottle sucked. Strong dark ale seems to be my sort of thing and this is a fine strong, dark ale. Tastes and smells of dark carmelized fruits, as well as a bit of cola (more the smell than the taste but cola lives in the taste as well). A little bit too much sugar sweetness going on, which is something I don't mind but others may. The bottle claims the product has port wine notes and I'd have to agree. Ungodly smooth for something that's 9%. By itself I'd say the drinkability is a 4 or less, but paired with the proper food this could be ambrosia.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Belgian Dark Strong Ale,94
22,30,SupaCelt,4.2,"Rich dark cola coloured with a purple grape skin aura that trimmed the view. A large and fluffy, tan, cola-like head bursted forth from the pour. The head did not stay for the festivities, but it was quite energetic while it was present. Ample clusters of carbonation bubbles held fast to the side of the goblet ( pilfered from Don Pablo's : ) before racing off to the open air. No lacing hung, just a ring of spent bubbles floating atop the surface.  The nose was that of sun dried purple fruits. A burnt clove or anice type of spicing peaked out from behind the dominance of sweet and malty scents.  There was a great texture to this brew. The mouthfeel captured the attention before the taste was even considered. Nectar like. Pleasantly sweet and juicey with a cream and nut oil finish. Oh and the taste; superb. The spice aspects of the nose were a touch threatening, but did not offend in the taste. Mildly caramel and dark fruit sweetness remained mellow without throwing their respective weights about. The well administered spice character showed up in the latter stages of the flavor revelation. Very nicely crafted. The taste showed itself and departed without lingering or pestering. The lack of aftertaste prompted rapid sipping in an attempt to keep the flavor constantly atop the tastebuds. More, more, more! Good trick by my brothers to the north. Bravo!",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Belgian Dark Strong Ale,94

Even though I served it too cold at first it was still a taste explosion which obviously improved as it warmed up. Pours from the bottle murky brown with reasonable light tan head. Aroma of raisins and brown sugar which extended through to the flavour along with hints of bitter dark chocolate towards the end. Luxurious mouthfeel, with a hint of viscosity from the high alcohol. I think I have fallen in love with Belgian Dark Brown Ale.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Belgian Dark Strong Ale,94
22,30,OStrungT,3.91,"This beer pours an amber color with a tan, creamy head that never seams to fade. It leaves a thick lacing on the glass. It smells malty. It smells of fruit. Cherries and rasberries. There are hints of vanilla also. It tastes fruity. There are hints of chocolate also. Almost like mild chocolate covered cherries. It is carbonated a bit much in my opinion. It is a meadium bodied beer. It leaves a fruity aftertaste on the palate. This beer is not the best session beer due to the somewhat high alcohol content, and because it is too carbonated. It is definatley worth a shot though.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Belgian Dark Strong Ale,94
22,30,AlexJ,4.52,"One of my all-time favorites from Unibroue. This luscious elixer pours a dark, ruby red. Jagged peaks of wheat-colored froth erupt from my Delirium tulip. Adequate lace deposits are left as a reminder of the impressive head.  Ther nose is a seductive blend of dark pit fruits, sweet vanilla spice, pear, cocoa-dusted rasberries, and a faint, oaky toastiness.  These flavors abound in the first sip. Further dark fruits are revealed. Plenty of clove and allspice sweetness, brown sugar, plum-pudding, and banana. On the sweet side, but not overly so. Absolutely smooth and highly drinkable. A silky body and a spicy, yeasty finish remind me why I love this beer. Top notch.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Belgian Dark Strong Ale,94
22,30,Hibernator,4.82,"I had the Unibroue Trois Pistoles out of a 12 oz brown bottle and served in a tulip glass. Best before date on the back of the label for 1/04/07.  Pours a ruby dark brown color with a tan colored head. Very fluffy head that rises to the top of my tulip glass at first. After a few minutes, the head becomes about a 1/2 inch lacing around the glass.  Beautiful aroma of rasberries, cherries, milk chocolate, and a sugary spice blend.  Light spices with a fruity berry chocolate taste. Very soft and smooth on the palate. Minimal hop presence, but just enough to balance the sweet cherry malts. Fruity strawberry esters blend very well a ripe blueberry tartness that finishes with slight alcohol warmth. Excellent complexity and drinkability levels.  This is an absolute beauty. What else can I say? Highly recommended.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Belgian Dark Strong Ale,94
22,30,Shultzerdugen,4.55,"12 oz. bottle with a best before date of 3-2-07.  Poured a dark brown with red tints. Large light tan head with good staying power. Quite a bit of yeast sediment swirling around.  Very light nose. Faint aromas of earthiness, sort of musty. Tart esters with a touch of alcohol.  What a great tasting beer! Full bodied and robust. Spicy and slick from the alcohol, malty and smooth. Pear or apricot notes fade into a powdered cocoa finish with a sneak attack hop bite in the back. It's dry, but not extremely so, just pleasantly so.  The last time I had this was New Year's 2 years ago, and I questioned my palate in hindsite. I've got to learn to trust my inebriated taste buds, just not my inebriated judgement as a whole.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Belgian Dark Strong Ale,94
22,30,ypsifly,4.22,"Dark brown with red hues. Nice tall head that falls to a ring with a sheet of thin foam across. Not much sticks to the sides of a Unibroue tulip.  Smells of dark dried fruits powdered with a little sugar. There's some spiceness too.  Tastes a bit fruity with some nice malt and yeast notes thrown in. Dry almost tart finish. Complex and well balanced. No real alcohol detected at first, but some is noticable as it warms.  Nice medium mouthfeel. The carbonation gives a nice tingle.  Despite the high abv that sneaks right up on you, this one is very drinkable. I often have to pace myself when enjoying this one, my taste buds want more!",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Belgian Dark Strong Ale,94
22,30,NeroFiddled,4.53,"In the goblet Trois Pistoles is almost black beneath its tall head of frothy bone-white foam. If you tilt the glass you can see tiny bubbles steadily streaming upwards, adding to it's head, and helping with its retention. Lacing about the glass, however, is a bit more limited than might be expected given the head retention. In the nose dark fruits greet you (not unlike port wine in many ways). It's initially zesty in the mouth before it warms a bit, but it still leaves with a bit of a zing until it warms a bit and becomes more airy. The flavor is drenched in soft, tanninc dark fruit that's been dipped in liquid sugar; but it's not particularily complex. As it warms, however, more caramel notes and some subtle hops become apparent, as does a touch of spicy alcohol (and some actual spice perhaps?) and some very low-key notes of licorice or soft molasses. It's really well balanced, with it's spicy alcohol and delicate bitterness balancing the dark fruits and restrained sugars. It's really quite enticing in that it's flavors are somewhat restrained and ""mellow"" as the back label suggests. This is a beer to be savored slowly, enjoying it's subtle complexities as they emerge. Magnifique!!!",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Belgian Dark Strong Ale,94
22,30,allengarvin,4.17,"Appearance: Very dark reddish-brown. Slight initial head.  Smell: Highly fruity, reminiscent of caramalized apples or plums.  Taste: Lots of esters (more plums, bananas, or a very ripe persimmon), with a good malt profile, earthy and bready. Bitterness is light in this rich, sweet beer. Finishes up slightly tart.  Body: Moderate body, lighter than one expects, with lots of carbonation.  An excellent late-night beer from Unibroue. It seems they just cannot brew anything that's less than wonderful.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Belgian Dark Strong Ale,94
22,30,kosmoraios,4.57,"Interesting. Pours a deep, opaque brown with some dark ruby tints at the edges. The head is small for an agressive pour, and dissipates within about 90 seconds or so, leaving a ring around the glass and a white island in the middle. Aroma is of sweet, dark fruit. Dark malts. Not roasted, like a stout, but somehow dark.  All of unibroue's labels are dark and gothic, and this ale tastes like the label looks. Taste is sweet, but in a good way - raisins, yes, but more figs than raisins. A bit of plum and melon. The mouthfeel is light and very peppery, and completely belies the appearance of the ale. Ample carbonation and undetectable alcohol make for exceptional drinkability. Careful with this one, though.  All in all, an impressive offering from Unibroue.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Belgian Dark Strong Ale,94
22,30,Bierguy5,3.9,"Dark cloudy chestnut color, some mohogany edges. Thick foamy white head, disappears eventually. Not much lace on the sides of the Unibroue goblet. Strong dark fruity smells, along with yeasty spices, almost like corriander. Caramel flavor, along with spices. Ripe fruit, dark fruit. Pretty carbonated, medium body. A very interesting beer. Some funkiness along with it. Interesting. Not the most drinkable, but a good one to try.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Belgian Dark Strong Ale,94
22,30,PorterLambic,4.3,"Pours a rich, dark brown with ruby red edges, a good head with decent retention. Smell is fruit (plums, dates, grapes), sweet malt, dark chocolate and some spice. Taste is Sweet, fruity, malty with some alcohol and chocolate. Taste improves as it warms, a very nice thing because at 9 %, taking your time is recommended. Excellent complexity and balance. Mouthfeel is full bodied, smoooth, light effervescence. Drinkability: hell yes!!! This is a great example of this style, I highly recommend this brew, for that matter, this brewery.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Belgian Dark Strong Ale,94
22,30,gimmehead,4.57,"Beautiful purple-black with a thin head that has the same subtle purplish tones. Huge aroma consisting of grapes and other ripe fruits. Very complex. Taste is grapes, peaches, caramel malts, becoming sweeter and more alcoholic as it warms. It might sound funny but I always get this mental image of purple (grape) Laffy Taffy when I drink this beer, I guess due to the fruits and candy sweetness. Very well carbonated and a great winelike aftertaste. One of my favorites.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Belgian Dark Strong Ale,94
22,30,isubsmith,4.15,"Appearance: Poured into a chalice from a 12oz bottle. Dark, murky brown with a redish-orangeish hint. Roughly an inch of head that quickly calmed down to 1/4"" and soon after disappeared.  Nose: Yeasty, slightly tart, hints of cherries.  Taste/Mouthfeel: Crisp, carbonated. Fairly clean aftertaste. Hints of spice. Alcohol definately present but not detracting from overall taste. Some malty sweetness.  Drinkability: Very drinkable for a 9% ABV beer. Probably dangerously so. Very good.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Belgian Dark Strong Ale,94
22,30,baiser,4.23,"Pours a deep, mahogany red body, cloudy from the yeast, and a big, off white head. Nice lacing, great looking beer. Aroma of prunes, dark fruit, yeast, caramel, cherries, and a slight medicinal flavour. Taste is wonderful. So juicy, and full of fruit. Plums, prunes, caramel. Deceptive alcohol. Great balance with some hops in the background. Truly a well crafted ale.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Belgian Dark Strong Ale,94
22,30,revdrjbob,3.92,"Bought from Thirroul Cellars, tasted at home with my beer loving GF. Poured a slightly opaque dark brown into the glass, with a thin tight light brown head. Aromas of wheat, spices (orange, coriander, clove, sl banana), possibly alcohol, that same yeast aroma from all of Unibroues' beers, and a slight waft of dark malt. Tasted awsome (as if it wouldn't). All the aromas tranferred to the pallate, followed by the evident alcohol of 9%abv, and a spritzy mouthfeel from the carbonation. Very easy to drink, and as usual, a winner for me!",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Belgian Dark Strong Ale,94
22,30,mynie,4.32,"A Pegasus of doom flies above a monastery or state capital building, looking nervously over its shoulder as if being pursued. I don't know what to make of this Magic: The Gathering artwork, and I won't know until I have finished this bottle. The line between pretentiousness and genius is razor thin, you see, and I can already tell that this beer is going to be either a work of art or pure wankery.  Deep purple, very fizzy with a small head that goes away quickly. This is a strange, very pretty plum color.  Complex and welcoming smell. Fruity esters somewhere between tart apricots and mellow grapes. Cloves make their way in there, as well.  What a pop of flavor upfront! A mad rush of sweet and sour fruit balanced out with a bland sweetness. The finish is clean--almost too clean. Nice and dry, but the flavor doesn't linger at all. Still, this is a damn fine taste and, surprisingly enough, there's almost no trace of alcohol.  Very fizzy, goes down nice.  This is one of those dark, wonderful ales that you should surprise guests with by serving at a party in lieu of wine. It would go great with red meat. And hell, you can get a 750 ml bottle of this for much less than a bottle of good wine--and this is better than good wine.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Belgian Dark Strong Ale,94
22,30,ism,4.45,"Nearly opaque mahogany with golden honey overtones, topped with a dense and active tan head. Clove spices dominate over fruits and plum raisin, with a subtle caramel sweetness in the nose. Good carbonation and medium body in conjunction with a pleasantly stimulating acridity create an excellent mouthfeel. Flavor is a complex mix of fruits, a slight vanilla, and the distinct yeast found in Maudite and La Fin Du Monde. Alcohol is nearly undetectable among all the other flavors. Goes down smooth, finishing with pepper and clove becoming a refined dryness that lingers for just the right amount of time before cleaning up completely.  Would be an excellent accompaniment to a meal. A fine, fine brew.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Belgian Dark Strong Ale,94
22,30,aquatonex,4.5,"Wonderful...  Pours dark brown, almost black opaque with a rich head, lacing forever. Just by looking at it you know you're in for a treat. Smell possesses bits of caramel and malts with hints of a berry fruitiness. The nose overall is a bit toned down compared to the taste. From your first sip, you can taste the complexities roll over your tongue at different times. Heavy, creamy malts foundation with a rather strong caramel and fruity sweetness. You can't really tell it's 9%, the flavors blend in so well that there is very little alcohol taste. Mouthfeel is awesome!  A heavy hitter that doesn't taste like one. Could drink this every day.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Belgian Dark Strong Ale,94
22,30,paterlodie,4.17,"Got this botle in Holland and didn't know what to expect from this one.... well after pulling it out you notice as soon as your nose gets near the the beer that this is somthing great! Very fruity, hoppy( is it saaz?) don't make you think that this is a strong dark ale. Hardly anything to motice of the 9% and hardly any maltarome in the nose. Nice darkbrown colour and a lasting head. Then the first sip... this brew tastes fullmaly, caramellic and only litle roast( is there?). Not to sweet but full and almost the same aftertaste. Wonder how so litle bitterness gets such a great hoparome.... must be dryhops in there! Good beer I will go for again when I find it....",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Belgian Dark Strong Ale,94
22,30,trancefishy,4.2,"Aroma is of really light grapes, peaches, very sweet caramel.  Tast is of Toffee, dark mission figs, and that silly unibroue yeast.  Mouthfeel is excellent, great dancing carbonation. Just right for the style.  This is a great beer, a true classic, and always fun to pick out the flavours.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Belgian Dark Strong Ale,94
22,30,Higravity,4.5,Had a 750 split with my sister. Big head on this one sit atop a dark ruby beer. After I got through the head the smell of this is fruity of cherries and grapes spiced with pepper and a lurking malty sweetness. This beer is a mouthful even at a sip. Highly carbonated and full bodied. It has a taste the flood over the tongue and gives you spicey notes of yeast that fade to fruity malt sweetness and end with a lingering aftertaste that reminds you to drink more. The alcohol hides well in this dark Canadian treat.,Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Belgian Dark Strong Ale,94
22,30,GClarkage,4.45,"12/06/04- Purchased at a wine store in Sonoma, CA  Appearance- Pours a deep brown color with a 3/4 inch head and good lacing.  Smell- Wonderful smell. Definite plums and raisins abound.  Taste- At first it is very sweet with caramel, dates and raisins, maybe some clove also. The flavor disipates though and leaves very little aftertaste. The flavor doesn't stick around as long as you would like. Can't even detect the 9% abv.  Mouthfeel- Goes down oh so smooth. As it warms is gets even more smooth and the tastes come out a bit better. Excellent level of carbonation.  Drinkability- As of now it's extremely drinkable. All depends on how the alcohol makes me feel after I finish it. 2 thumbs up, and not far from being a bit better.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Belgian Dark Strong Ale,94
22,30,Jacobier10,4.37,"Big props to my buddy Paul for this one! Poured from a 12 oz. bottle into a tulip glass. Nice presentation here. Very dark black/ruby color to it with a 1-finger head. I love the aroma this beer gives off. The first thing I noticed were apples and pears followed by bananas and then a hint of dark chocolate. Nice and complex. Overall, very fruity aroma. Some of the fruitiness disappeared upon tasting it and it transformed into a nice, subtle, malty brew. A slightly sweet finish. I could drink this baby all night long, but it is a bit of a sipper. Very enjoyable and highly recommended. Cheers!",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Belgian Dark Strong Ale,94
22,30,Padron4KM,4.28,"Pours a murky dark brown with a fizzy head. Head dissapates quickly, but returns with just a swirl of the glass. Thin sheet of lacing. Aroma is sweet, malt, raisin, prunes, cooked bannana, alcohol. Flavor is sweet and tangy. ripe fruit, (apricot, prune, raisin) some spice, with a lemony tang at the end. Creamy mouthfeel. Alcohol is well hidden, and it sneaks up on you.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Belgian Dark Strong Ale,94
22,30,bashiba,4.47,"Pours a dark hazy red brown with ample head that dissapears quickly leaving a thin tan line of head.  Smell is fantastic, raisons, plums, brown sugar, and other fruity goodness dominate the scent. Very strong and nice.  Taste is alot smoother than I anticipated. A very nice maltiness up front with some woody highlights and a mild malt sweetness that is quickly balanced with a very spicy earthy hop finish. Very good.  Mouthfeel is very nice, thick and very warming.  Drinkablity is very good, goes down especially easy for a 9% beer, in fact I'm glad I got the 750ml so I can go get another glass. Highly recommend this one.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Belgian Dark Strong Ale,94
22,30,SaunaKing,3.19,Working my way through the 12pack Unibroue sampler - first time i have tried anything from this brewery. This is a dark brown beer with a nice thick beige head and chunks of yeast sediment suspended in the brew.  There is no smell to this beer. I simpy can't smell anything. No aroma. Taste is a little spicy but I can't identify what it tastes like. Its smooth with a soft finish. The yeast particles definietly impact the taste (positively).  Not a bad beer. I haven't had too many nor liked high abv brews but this is ok stuff.,Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Belgian Dark Strong Ale,94
22,30,anders36,4.27,"I haven't had the pleasure to try this beer from the 750 ml bottle yet, so this is from the 341ml bottle. It pours a dark brown colour with big off white head. The head disappears rather fast though. It has a lovely smell of molasses and raisins. The taste is a little bitter. Fruity and malty but balaced. The mouthfeel is very smooth and you get a warming feeling from the 9% ABV. The aftertaste is a bit sweet and malty. This lovely beer made me warm on a cold November night.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Belgian Dark Strong Ale,94
22,30,amicar,4.42,"Poured from a 750 mL bottle. Ample off- white head that sticks around for awhile. Smells a little malty/ caramely. A whiff of green apple on the nose. Appearance is a slightly cloudy toasty brown color with the barest hint of red. The first sip caught me a little off guard; I actually expected something overwhelmingly heavy, but no, not this beer. The mouthfeel is perfect. Really. It fills up the mouth just enough.. it restrains itself as to not overwhelm. It also tingles a little bit as you roll it around. And it sits there for a full minute after the swallow. The taste is very nice- the sweetness that you can find is 'just' there, balanced nicely by a little tartness (also 'just' there). The caramel malts (I think that's what it is) really are nicely expressed here. There's also a tiny touch of burnt marshmallow flavor in there somehere (I mean this in a good way).  This definitely could be the sole beer for a whole evening. It's a bit much for everyday, but there's a reason that this one's on my short list.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Belgian Dark Strong Ale,94
22,30,CAMRAhardliner,4.7,"This is one hell of a Unibroue beer. This sample is a one and a half year old 750 ml corked bottle. It pours dark chocolate brown color with a massive khaki billowy head that leaves sheets of thick lace. The aroma is of intense plums, raisinbread, caramel dates, passionfruit and green apple skins, with a generous spicey hop character. The taste is an impeccable mix of pale, crystal and roasted malts. Theres a great, bready flavor, A caramelly flavor and a toasted malt flavor. Theres also a fruity yeast flavor. Hops are evident but rightly subdued, This is a malt beer. The mouthfeel is very smooth with torrents of tiny carbonation bubbles. The finish is quite crisp and also bitter, surprisingly so. This is one hell of a good Belgian style beer. A must try.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Belgian Dark Strong Ale,94
22,30,blitz134,4.3,"This my first Unibroue beer...and my first corked beer. The pop from opening the bottle was nice. Made me smile, haha.  I poured this into an oversized wine glass. Color was extremely dark in the glass but poured a caramel color. It had a one finger light tan head that disappeared rather quickly. The aroma was sweet. I could pick out the sweetness of the malts but the rest was a blend many sweet aromas, nothing overly discernable.  The taste is pretty amazing. The blending of all the flavor components is excellently done, very balanced. Flavors encompass the sweet malts which were detected in the aroma. A blendy of dark fruits, mainly subdued raisin and plums. The immediate aftertaste is very crisp. The aftertaste doesn't last long though, I'd like it to stick around a bit to savor the flavor, but I'm sure this is due to the high ABV of this beer. Even with the 9% content this brew goes down nice and smooth. Perfect for sitting around one cool evening to savor the flavor and be warmed up a bit.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Belgian Dark Strong Ale,94
22,30,toastage,4.03,"Appearance was good...a slow pour down the side yielded immediate head formation with a nice 3 quarter inch finish at the end. Deep amber colour with some cloudiness. Molasses, fruit and alcohol in the nose.  Well balanced. The only thing that speaks to the 9% ABV is the 2-beer buzz. Medium body, enough to make it sit on your tongue while you savour the flavour, and an aftertaste that is not pungent but definitely lets you know it was there.  Excellent beer to sip at and enjoy.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Belgian Dark Strong Ale,94
22,30,dgallina,4.75,"Pours a rich, slightly cloudy, dark copper and brown. Very little head that quickly dissipates, leaving a thin film of lace. Dark, sweet, raisin and cherry fruit and alcohol aromas. Rich, roasted malt and dark fruits in the mouth with an excellent, slightly bitter and very dry finish that leaves you wanting more. A medium-heavy body that seems very appropriate for the style. An excellent interpretation of the style, and a beer I'd be happy to sip for a few hours after dinner.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Belgian Dark Strong Ale,94
22,30,zbs,4.43,"Single bottle from Russell's Package Store, Amherst MA. Poured into a convenient chalice.  Rich mahogany foams to a narrow cream, with a nose somewhat off-balance: sugar and spice tones brimming on alcohol. First taste is rich pure beer notes and bountiful, with a middle proliferation of Dolcetto esters maturing into thicker, dark fruit; a deeply hidden but powerful bitter is subdued underneath a late-blooming verge of Godiva. The body royals in purple, finishing superbly complete--skeining tan lace.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Belgian Dark Strong Ale,94
22,30,orbitalr0x,4.28,"This one pours out of the silver foil topped bottle a deep dark brown, nearly black with a nice off white head. Hints of red sneak through when held up to the light. The smell on this one is a mix of chocolate covered cherries and raisins, some molasses and nice roasted tones.  The first taste is upfront with a sweet cherry cocoa roastiness. A nice spiciness (cloves?) rolls along the tounge as well. Quite tasty and flavorful. New flavors peek through with each sip and the alcohol is well hidden in the taste.  Mouthfeel is good as well. A nice full body that coats the mouth and goes down smooth. Drinkability is nice here too. Not a session brew, but a couple on a cold night would be nice. I'm looking forward to trying more Unibroue products.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Belgian Dark Strong Ale,94
22,30,KoG,4.3,"Aged this bottle about 2 weeks, I couldn't wait any longer. I'll go get more and give it a longer run next time.  Nice dark brown that lets little light in around the edges and created a generous amount of thick head that clung on for life before leaving a little lacing.  Smells of chocolate, cherries, dark fruit, spice, and a bit of wood come out of the glass nicely. After it warmed a bit I gave it a swirl and got a large whiff of alcohol... only the one time though.  Taste was thick and rich filled with cherries, raisins, ripe dark fruit, and a definate spicy ginger finish. No trace of the 9% alcohol anywhere in sight.  Mouth was excelent, leaving the mouth clean but craving more, not astringent in the least. Makes it almost too easy to drink.  Drinkability is good but I would rather split this with 3 or maybe 4 people as it gets a bit filling. Would be an excellent choice to pair with dessert.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Belgian Dark Strong Ale,94
22,30,Biffster,4.17,"Pours a beautiful mahogany with both amber and ruby highlights and an agressive light tan head.  The aroma is spicy and a bit malty. I get the impression of vanilla, pepper, raisin, citrus and pineapple.  The beer starts big and fruity, with pineapple, strawberry and banana coming out prominently at the taste. As that fades, I can detect a hint of cocoa before the swallow. The finish is all warmth and spice.  The body is light and the carbonation is substantial, as to be expected. There is plenty of warming. Some astringency mars the mouthfeel.  Overall, this is a substantial and delicious Belgian dark, with plenty of complexity and an intriguing finish.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Belgian Dark Strong Ale,94
22,30,bultrey,4.5,"Pours a beautiful cinnamon brown color with a nice frothy head that shrinks to a constant miniscule lacy head skirting the edge of the liquid. The aroma I could inhale all day: Molasses, figs, raisins, clove, chocolate, cinammon. It almost shares an aroma profile with a dopplebock, or dare I say an eisbock. The taste reveals a very vinous quality, but like a good sherry or port. The palate is inundated with chocolate and molasses and raisins, just a beautiful sensation that I want to envelop me. Really, this is like liquid chocolate-covered raisins. There is a slight roasty aftertaste that brings just enough bitterness to the table to keep this from being cloying. The mouthfeel is stout and the carbonation is just wonderful if not a bit filling, coating every corner of the tongue. The drinkability is exceptional as the alcohol content is well-masked. Ohhhh, I want another. Unibroue makes good beer, and that's all there is to it.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Belgian Dark Strong Ale,94
22,30,tatterdash,4.4,"Appearance is a wonderful burgandy brown with a light tan head which mostly dissipated quickly. Smell is a wine-like fruitiness and spices. Taste is incredible, tangy, with notes of plums, toffee and cloves. Mouthfeel is smooth and you don't even notice the 9% ABV. There is a bit of roasted dry aftertaste, I really enjoy sipping this.  Although I could drink this all day, and probably will, I must admit that the first Unibroue in a night is usually the best. This is a slow sipping beer.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Belgian Dark Strong Ale,94
22,30,crookedhalo,4.17,"12 oz. bottle with twist-off bottlecap under silver foil dated best before 1-28-2007. Pours a murky ruby with brown highlights, sometimes bordering voilet hues. Roasted malts, yeast, various spices (I discerned some cinnamon, ginger and cardamum), and a currant-like fruitiness are evident in the nose. Roasted candi sugar and malts are upfront, followed by a grape/currant-like fruitiness and backed with a healthy dosage of yeastiness and hops to keep it dry and palatable in the finish. Not bad; I'd like to try it in the 75 cl presentation. The alcohol is noticable, but barely. A slight bit of burnt cideriness at the end of the goblet.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Belgian Dark Strong Ale,94
22,30,oxmasterscream,3.32,"Appearance was a murky cedar water color with a thin, light tan head. Aroma was ripe fruits and cloves. Taste was spicy and fruity with a nice, smooth finish and only slightly bitter... I would've liked it to be more complex. Carbonation was solid. Medium mouthfeel. The higher ABV was very noticeable and warming was felt almost immediately. For me, this was just an average Belgian ale that never reached me and not Unibroue's best offering.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Belgian Dark Strong Ale,94
22,30,HappyHourHero,4.42,"Deep soil brown colored beer with a cream colored head. Head is on the small side, almost creamy in texture, and leaves a sheet of lace as it fades slowly to a scatered film. Aromas of brown sugar, dark fruit (plums and apples?, I can't figure it out) and a bit of yeasty goodness. Dark fruits, raisins and plums, some cocoa, dark candied sugar, and possibly some other stuff. There's a bit going on in there and it's hard to seperate out. Finish is smooth and lingers for a while drawing you back for more. Moderate bodied beer is smooth on the tongue. Yeah she's a nice one, getting close to that Abt 12 (St. B's of course).",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Belgian Dark Strong Ale,94
22,30,slitherySOB,4,"I thought I might as well review this, before it gets stolen. Pours a dark caramel colour, with a bit of chocolate black. Yeast gives it a clouded, almost spooky colour. Big, two finger head that's thick and strong. Lace sticks to the glass like post-it notes. Big smell of cherries, alcohol, chocolate, plums, raisins, malts and dark chocolate. Taste is a bit more subdued. The above ingredients make a thick sweetness that is balanced by, of all things, the alcohol. Instead of hops for balancing the sweet, this beer relies on the kick of the alcohol. It works well. Mouthfeel is dry and has an oatmeal thickness that's a bit unexpected in anything liquid. Good drinkability. Would be nice on a winter afternoon, sipped like brandy.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Belgian Dark Strong Ale,94
22,30,SilentSabre,4.32,"Very nice. Poured darker than I would have expected it to. Poured a cloudy reddish brown like tea with too much lemon juice in it. Nice colour. Monster slightly off-white head that settled to a little more than a thin haze over the top. Laced the sides of the glass quite nicely. The smell was just as good as everyone said it would be. The presence of alcohol is certainly detectable, but not overpowering. A little bit of spice and malt. Very pleasant; I couldn't wait to have a sip. The taste, too, has some spice to it and plenty of malt. There is no question that this is a higher gravity brew. Certainly not unpleasant, but there is indeed a warming affect from the 9.0%abv. Would be absolutely ideal for a cold winter night. The mouthfeel is nice and smooth and it goes down easily. There is some carbonation present, but a pleasant amount; just a little bit more than a trace. Overall, I'd say I'm quite impressed with this one. Excellent!",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Belgian Dark Strong Ale,94
22,30,inebrius,4.92,"The aroma is so intoxicating you nearly needn't drink.  The forest, all elaborate in your boar-skin loin-cloth, collecting dark ripe rotten fruits, from tree to vine to tree in an orchard wild: plum, tobacco, melon you meet a shaman who feeds you far out herbs around the campfire.  A value beer.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Belgian Dark Strong Ale,94
22,30,shapudding,4.57,"Dark rootberry and cloudy, cannot see through this one... Nice thick creamy, khaki head reduced down fairly quick and left a good ring and a beautiful galaxy swirl in the center. Yummm... scents of dark fruits... port wine... sasafrass at the edges.... makes your mouth open to start sipping it... Slightly sour... So nice. Funny, seems like each time I pick up the goblet, a different scent becomes prominent. Perfect amount of carbination for flavor. Just right. Man does Unibroue know what they are doing. Not too much shooting around and not flat. Enough carb to give some zing but not too much to annoy me. Dry tasting, spices hit you -cinnamon and cloves.... but not extreme where you feel like you overwhelmed by that flavor. Fresh tobacco. Dark fruits in the back maybe... some raisin, maybe some fig.. Little bit of darkened toast taste. Nice one...",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Belgian Dark Strong Ale,94

Comes in a 750ml corked bottle. Best before date is clearly labled. Pours a dark, deep brown, ruby when held to the light. Very subtle head, very low carbonation. Smell is musty and fruity. Taste is malty, dry and grape-like. Like the label advertises, this is port wine-like in taste. Very smooth, and very drinkable. A good showing by Unibrue.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Belgian Dark Strong Ale,94

This beer pours a beautiful dark mahogany brown with a thick, sturdy light tan head. Aroma is spicy with coriander and clove coming to the fore, with some slightly sour fruitiness and some roasted notes as well. Taste is tart and full of spice, with a dry, smokey finish. Light carbonation, medium-bodied on the palate.  This is a deep, complex beer that begs one to continue to drink it to try to figure it out. A fine offering from Unibroue, and one that definitely can be enjoyed right up to its best before date if cellared properly.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Belgian Dark Strong Ale,94
22,30,nogoodreason,4.43,"Unibroue may be the best brewery in North America. There are other great ones, but Unibroue definitely belongs in that group. Amongst Unibroue's excellent line stands the beautiful Trois Pistoles. How I love this beer.  Appearance: Dark brown, with an active, overly zealous slightly off white head. Don't pour this baby too fast, or it'll over flow the glass. Carbonation is steady and rushing.  Smell: Difficult to describe... A slight maltiness in the nose with that typical Unibroue boquet. Pepper, cloves, floral aspects. The alchol is there, but everytime it raises it's head it's obscured by another scent immediately.  Taste: The malt brings a dark fruit and very slight cocoa aspect which is balanced nicely with yeasty spice (cloves, pepper) and a nice floral hop aspect.The combination of plum-like fruit and flowers is great, pommengranate like. Lovely, sweet fruity/bready finish with just enough pepper.  Mouthfeel: If this beer was thicker, and carbonation was slightly lighter it would be perfect. Instead, it's a little too thin and the carbonation is a bit of a distraction. Not quite as thin or carbonated as the rest of the Unibroue line, but it could still benefit from a little less carbonation and more body. Really the only weekness of this beer.  Drinkability: This is such an intensly quaffable beer. I don't know how else to describe it.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Belgian Dark Strong Ale,94
22,30,BrewMan13,4.58,"A nice, dark belgian-style ale. Unibroue is one of my favorite breweries and beers like this are why. Smells of dark fruits and yeast. Taste is similar. Yeast is more dominant to start, but as it warms, the dark fruits give it a vinious carbonated wine-like flavor. Only the slightest hint of alcohol at room temp, which is very impressive for a 9% brew. Starts off with a fairly high amount of carbonation that could be off-putting to some, but it doesnt bother me. Slightly sweet but not overly so. I know I emphasized the wine-like qualities, but its not overpowering in that department as I dont like most wine but loved this bad boy. Like my other Unibroue fave, Maudite, this one is complicated in the flavor department and well worth a try.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Belgian Dark Strong Ale,94
22,30,marcobrau,3.75,"Very dark ruby, almost brown. Pours with a delicate head of foam that leaves some nice lacework as it falls. The delightful aroma is full of plum and fig with a hint of smoke. A bit uneventful up front and not very complex, quite thin in body and overly carbonated (reflected in low points for drinkability and mouthfeel.) Hints of tobacco are hidden behind the sharp, prickly carbonation. The finish is powerful, laced with sugar and rum-like flavors, bit of tobacco and smoke, quite complex. There's some interesting stuff going on in this beer. Unfortunately, most Unibroue beers are way too spritzy for my tastes; I usually have to decant them a couple of times into a pint glass to release a lot of the carbonation, which vastly imporoves my ability to enoy this beer. My wife used to go to Key West each year and was astonished to find Unibroue beers at the corner liquor store by her motel. She has a theory that the champagne-like carbonation of the Unibroue beers makes them more appealing to drinkers in tropical climates.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Belgian Dark Strong Ale,94
22,30,fdrich29,4.32,"1 Pt. 9.4 Fl. Oz. bottle.. Best Before 10-23006 stamped on the back above the UPC code.  Pours black with crimson highlights. One finger head quickly retreats to fortify the outer edges of the beers territory.  Smells of caramel, fruit and chocolate.  Tastes like fruit, malt and lingering reminder of the chocolate smell remain.  Mouthfeel is carbonation tingliness, the beer itself is weighty and substantial.  As with most Unibroue products Trois Pistoles is dangerously drinkable as the sweet, fruity taste hooks you in. Definitely a tasty beer.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Belgian Dark Strong Ale,94
22,30,Rio,3.91,"12 oz brown bottle with 'drink by' date on the back, nice label artwork and foil neck wrapper I've come to expect from Unibroue.  Very nice dark brown color, almost pure black, decent head that crowned the glass, then reduced to about half a finger's bredth and stayed there. Nice grassy aroma to it. An herbal taste to it, with a sharp undertone of spices. Good, crisp carbonation, and a bit thicker mouthfeel.  The spices threw me off a bit on this one, but they really do add to the flavor. Not a beer I jumped in and loved right away (this is actually the last bottle of a four-pack I bought about a month ago), but it does grow on you. On my 'to drink again' list.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Belgian Dark Strong Ale,94
22,30,goodbyeohio,3.84,"this beer pours awfully dark (into a tulip glass, of course). the foamy head settles quickly in an uneven, hilly formation. sticky lacing is apparent all over the top 1/4 of the glass after two minutes.  the first sip is heavy with alcohol, but does not bite you with such on the aftertaste. it's representative of the darker flavors like dates and coffee but carries a delicious tart aroma which reminds me of the common belgian banana scent. drinkability is limited in the first few sips of a glass, but the second two-thirds go down like water.  unibroue is a north american anomaly.. exotic enough to be highbrow but local enough to be a source of pride.  well done!",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Belgian Dark Strong Ale,94
22,30,abcsofbeer,3.65,"This one pours a dark, cola brown. Nice tannish head comes on strong when pouring and had to be slowed down. Bottle refermentation, I guess. Leaves a nice abundant lace over the entire glass.  The aroma is of ripened fruit, a cross between bananas and an apple. Smells a little like some wheat beers that I have tried and not liked.  Taste is smooth with light carbonation and somewhat fruity and slightly alcoholic, not surprising with the 9% abv. The aftertaste is wine like also.  I am enjoying the Belgian strong dark ales. They are different and very tasty.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Belgian Dark Strong Ale,94
22,30,silenius,4.08,"Reviewed from a 12oz. bottle. Pours a dark brown with dark orange highlights when held up to the light. The head is vigorous and after a minute settles down to to a thin cap. The bubbles were actually pretty big I thought, more like soda bubbles. In my tulip glass the beer looks like a big glass buckeye with the tan head on top.  Fusel alcohol, dark stewed fruits, raisins, and yeast. All the smells were pretty subdued, but nice.  Taste is more of the same. Dark stewed fruits, sweet plump raisins, and some yeastiness on the finish. The 9% alcohol warms as it goes down. Solid, but not ""WOW.""  This has a nice creamy and lively frothy mouthfeel that tickles without a prickle. Very nice.  This was the first Unibroue I ever tried and I'm still drinking it over a year later, so drinkability is good for me. Nice.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Belgian Dark Strong Ale,94
22,30,Trentonator,4.59,"The bottle art is your first indication that this is a beer to be reckoned with. A menacing looking winged horse hovers in the storm clouds over a very dark castle (or is it a church?)--it is very eerie. The beer pours out dark brown, like used motor oil, but leaves a nice but short lived head. Verry little lacing to speak of, but lots of carbonation and light fizz. Smell is fruity, fresh and floral. Taste is nothing short of remarkable. It is sweet and just slightly tangy, light on the palate and smooth. I taste some strawberry in there, some ripe plums and maybe some mulberry. The bottle says that there is ""a pleasant aftertaste that lingers on like old port wine"". It does leave a nice aftertaste, but it is smoother than any port wine I have ever had. A remarkable beer in every regard, highly recommended.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Belgian Dark Strong Ale,94
22,30,cbl2,4.38,"Appearance:  Dark amber with half inch tan head that settles rapidly.  Smell:  Very fruity, with pear leading the way followed by some caramel aspects.  Taste/Mouthfeel:  This is dangerous stuff. Sweet pear/plum is the first sensation to great the tongue with a mild effervescence. The sweetness almost completely masks the 9% alcohol the label promises.  Note: 750 mL bottle, best before 7-15-06",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Belgian Dark Strong Ale,94
22,30,Pegasus,4,"Appearance: Muddy deep brown color with a large tan head, which settles to a thin layer in a few minutes. There is also an abundance of sediment, which I swirled into the beer, as well as lots of champagne-like carbonation.  Aroma: Very sweet with strong wine-like notes, prominent alcohol, as well as dark fruits, molasses and brown sugar.  Taste: Begins with a sweet and wine-like note, beneath this are dark fruits, brown sugar, slight bitter chocolate notes, and very restrained hops. Spicy, peppery notes and sweet alcohol dominate the rather dry finish. Subdued alcohol notes linger on well past the finish, warming quite pleasantly.  Mouth feel: Quite smooth and rich, very pleasant.  Drinkability/notes: An absolutely superb winter or dessert beer. This would be a stunning finish to a fine meal.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Belgian Dark Strong Ale,94
22,30,aaronbeach69,4.87,"WOWWW!!!!  this beer is amazing, and I don't say that lightly  appearance: Dark cloudy red/brown/black depending on how much light you give it, with a light head that goes away relatively quickly. Not too thick, just a little more thick than a regular lager.  Smell: the smell was the first thing that really caught me, sweet and sparkly... definetely fruity... strawberries that has to be it!! maybe a melon of some sorts. Something even more sweet I can't put my finger on, the taste fills your mouth...  Mouthfeel: A SWEET warm aftertaste glows stronger and stronger for the first few seconds after you swallow, the beer is exceptionally creamy feeling for how light it looks and seems to flow. Bubbly on your tounge :)  Taste: I can't even note any alchohol... except for a great tinge I feel on the sides of my tounge. Defintely a beer made for the edges of your tounge, the middle does not do it justice, so swish it around carefully not to disturb it and make it bubble too much. The best taste is the sweet fuity-ness, or should I say the exquisite way the beer seems to flow from one sweet taste to the next, one gulp of this beer contains many more sweet fruits/spices than I can identify, I can identify this though... they are so good the dynamic variance of stimulation nearly overloaded me and sent a chill down my back, making me shake.  I know I'm a newbie but this has been one of the greatest beer experiances of my life... and it is still going on... I have only finished half the bottle. Now leave us alone, I have fallen in love",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Belgian Dark Strong Ale,94
22,30,imblane,4.8,"Poured a deep brown in my chalice, with a perfect, 2 finger, tan, head. The head dissipated quickly with light lacing left. Smell was cherries, malt, a hint of chocolate and finished with a soft alcohol bite. Tasted was exceptional! Fruity, with a malty backbone and high carbonation. I must confess, I am usually not a big fan of high carbonation, but it worked here!! Finishes crisp and clean, and as usual for Unibroue, the alcohol is well hidden. I could drink several of these at a sitting, but I would stop short of calling this a session beer. Another outstanding offering from Unibroue, I think this is my favorite from them.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Belgian Dark Strong Ale,94
22,30,TheOtherMike,1.62,"This one found itself in the sink quite soon.  Appearance - It poured with alomst no head. Fairly dark with moderate clarity - similar to Rock & Rye Cola.  Smell - Yup, it smells. Like what, I don't know. Not like beer tho.  Taste - Alot like the smell, it just ain't right. It's really too bizarre for me to describe accurately.  Mouthfeel - The mouthfeel was pretty good. Even tho the head was essentially nil, the carbonation was very active which was noticeable in the mouth.  Drinkability - This was in the sink none too soon.  You've been warned. ;)",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Belgian Dark Strong Ale,94
22,30,Skidz,4.3,"Pours out a light orange-brown and sits a dark reddish brown in the glas with an off-white head that fades fast, but leaves a decent skim.  Smells sweet malts, and slightly yeasty. Apples, pears, some grassiness, along with light spice and caramel make up this sweet smelling brew.  Taste is initially sweet; apples, pears and prunes blended with brown sugar/caramel. A light bitter finish leaves you with a hint of alcohol in the mouth.  Smooth in the mouth but has a mildy aggressive carbonation; nothing to complain about though. Good all around; warms your insides and pleases the palate.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Belgian Dark Strong Ale,94
22,30,DPMomutant,3.97,"Pours a dark brown, but not quite opaque. The head is very nice and large but doesn't last long. Very fizzy as well, looks pretty good.  Most of what I smell is berries. Looks like it may go well with the strawberry shortcake I'm eating.  The taste is delightfully complex. Fresh fruit in the front and wine at the end. The alcohol is not overpowering, but you can tell it's a higher than average ABV.  This beer goes down smooth with even carbonation as long as you look out for that alcohol again.  This 750ml bottle will probably be all I have tonight. This is a pretty complex beer I will say. Looks like wine until you see the bubbles. Still might be hard to have too many but what I'm having will drink fine....and yeah it goes pretty good with this dessert.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Belgian Dark Strong Ale,94
22,30,SetarconeX,4.18,"Wonderful little brew! Nice and murky, with a not unpleasent strong and sweet scent. The taste is exactly what you'd want out of a Belgian dark, somewhat strong, nice and thick, and with a perfect tangy sweetness.  The tartness of Belgians always makes me knock Belgians a couple points, and this one is no exception, but the rest of it is so well balanced between sweetness and sourness that I have to rate it highly on every other element. A very good beer!",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Belgian Dark Strong Ale,94
22,30,Gueuzedude,3.92,"Pours a deep amber color with a tanish, light brown head that is not that thick or long lasting. The aroma is dominated by concentrated fruit aromas (cherry, fig, and raisin). There is a hint of alcohol and notes of spice cake also found in the nose. This is fairly light bodied given the intense fruit aromas that are in the aroma. The alcohol is evident in the light burn as it reaches my stomach. There is a hint of coriander in the finish. The fruit notes of raisin and fig are here in the taste as well, but they are not as intense as the aroma would suggest. The finish is fairly dry, though it is lightly sweet up front, which helps to accentuate the fruit notes. Definitely an elegant brew, pretty subtle and I can imagine that some age brings some added complexity to this brew. I'll have to stash a few to see how they age.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Belgian Dark Strong Ale,94
22,30,chugamugofsud,4.12,"I have had this unibroue offering from bottle before but recently the best local beer bar (Pazzo's) got this on tap and I had to oblige myself. The high alcohol content is a real attractor for many, apparently. The beer pours relatively dark, looking like a bock in the pitcher with a relatively thick carbonation head on top of it. The beer tastes somewhat minty but is very complex and covers up the alcohol excellently. It drinks quickly and smoothly, one could easily have several of these. This is absolutely my favorite unibroue offering and I recommend it to anyone who likes Unibroue or high alcohol beers.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Belgian Dark Strong Ale,94
22,30,flaminghomer,3.93,no lacing at all. color is to my liking. head is all fizzy and loud. strong fruit smell. taste is different. very complex. don't know where to begin. definently a strong alcohol taste but there is something in the rest of it that makes this taste seem justified and right where it should be. there is alot going on in this beer. you don't realize how smooth of a ride it is until the drink is done.,Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Belgian Dark Strong Ale,94
22,30,RBorsato,4.59,"Older bottle notes (4-5 years at least): === Dark cherry, mahogany with very fast coke-like bubbles upon pour which disappear quickly. Lots of tiny suspended particles, low carbonation and no lace. Strong dark fruit aroma with traces of alcohol and spices ... port wine-like. Tastes much like it smells; very fruity and strong ! A sipper! Medium bodied but seems light for it's strength with a warming alcohol finish.  Newer bottle notes === Similar color but has a nice full pillowy light brown head and more active carbonation. Aroma much spicier with raisiny notes a la a strong dubbel. Flavor is much more balanced with raisiny tones and not nearly as fruity as the older version. Medium-full bodied but airy also.  Older version not nearly as good although the newer version was also aged. Old ratings: A 3.5, S 4.5, M 4, D 4  #1: Old bottle (more than 4-5 years) Tasted: 05/06/04  #2: Best Before: 07/03/05 ('01' emb on bottom - purchased 5/10/03) Tasted: 05/06/04  ($2.33 / 12 oz.)",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Belgian Dark Strong Ale,94
22,30,Billolick,4.02,"12 ounce bottle. Pours dark brownish, plumlike. Off white head, Tad of lacing. Big nose of cherries, must and malt. Malty, Full flavor Belgian style ale. Notes of raisins, cherries, chocolate, musty stuff. Not for beginners, this is a classy, powerful rendition of the style, get out the stinky cheese and enjoy this sipper.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Belgian Dark Strong Ale,94
22,30,WesWes,4.42,"The beer pours a dark brownish color with a thick frothy off-white head. The aroma is awesome! It has a nice malty scent that is complimented with a fruity Belgian yeast aroma. It is very sweet and refreshing. The taste is very good. It has a rich and intense malt complexity. It has a toasted malt flavor that goes down easy and finishes dry and a bit fruity due to the Belgian yeast. It has great flavor. It has a dark beer taste, but without the black malts. The mouthfeel is excellent. It is a full bodied beer with adequate carbonation. This is a damn good brew. These guys only produce winners.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Belgian Dark Strong Ale,94
22,30,cerevisiaephilus,4.17,"Has a pretty nice color. Dark, soft brown color with a nice fluffy, belgian head. Nice sweet malty-caramelly nose. Some spicy notes as well. The flavors in this beer are nice...nice and smooth. Some nice spicy undertones and caramel flavors, but nothing fabulous like the Fin du Monde, but I suppose this isn't supposed to be real fruity. Mouthfeel is right on for a Dubbel. Fairly thin and very effervescent. A pretty drinkable beer.  I'd say this beer is realy right on for a Dubbel, but I'm not super familiar with the Strong Dark ale, but I think its a little thin compared to a Gulden Draak say.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Belgian Dark Strong Ale,94
22,30,rajendra82,4,"When I opened this attractive foil covered 12 oz. bottle, the beer gushed out and kept coming. The body is reddish brown and opaque when held up to the light. The head was a couple of inches tall at first, but died down pretty soon. Minimal lacing, which I presume is due to the high ABV. The nose is apples, pears, bananas, and other assorted fruits. Taste is cherries, raisins, plums, and toffee. There was a strong medicinal alcohol presence that reminded me of cough syrup, which is good, since I am battling sinus trouble as I write this. This is a complex brew that I will be looking out for, when it becomes available locally.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Belgian Dark Strong Ale,94
22,30,BrewMan82,4.47,"Pours dark amber with a thin off-white head - crackled and popped nicely as it settled into the glass. Aroma of very sweet fruit, especially strawberry creme, countered by a vinegar presence, and even some wacky meat-like character - pot roasty. The taste is initially sweet and fruity, giving way to a huge mouthful of earthy wood-like flavor. Intense full mouth with an easy buttery aftertaste feel. The complex flavors in this brew kept me thinking - an excellent drinking experience. Will definately enjoy again -",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Belgian Dark Strong Ale,94
22,30,Quaffer,4.05,"Picked this up in Dallas when it was not available in Kansas.  Appearance: Looked almost black in the glass until held up to the light. Deep mahogony-red with quite a bit of sediment. The tan head was coarse and big, dissipating quickly. No lacing.  Smell: A sweet, fruity smell was evident even with the glass a couple of feet away. Apples, raisins, and dark fruits prevailed at first. Then a spicy, almost smokey yeast aroma arose. Hints of alcohol. Very dark smells.  Mouthfeel: Thin- to medium-bodied and smoother than I anticipated.  Taste: This beer had a deep, rich flavor. Dark fruits and grapes were present, but not with the tartness that usually accompanies them. Also some dark malt that was sweet and a little smokey. There was definitely some yeast on the finish and a light amount of alcohol. A heavy, round flavor.  With the addition of the sediment, the flavor lightened up somewhat and became more tart and spicy.  A solid beer that was good, but not outstanding. Hides the alcohol very, very well.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Belgian Dark Strong Ale,94
22,30,Bruiser81,4.45,A dark brown color almost looks like dark tea. A nice bubbly head quickly to dissipate. Aroma is lightly fruity. Has almost a hay like smell in the background. Light alcohol spices. Very tasty. A good malty front. Small hints of dark fruit. The aftertaste has a strong raisin taste. There almost seems to be a light nutty taste as well. Goes down extremely easy. I'm gonna drink plenty of this stuff. I would have never guessed this stuff is sitting at 9%abv. The alcohol is barely present in the taste. Very good stuff.,Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Belgian Dark Strong Ale,94
22,30,necoadam,4.85,Poured out a brownish/amber color with a little bit of carbonation in it. Aroma consisted of a lot of ripe fruit with some malts mixed in. A little wiff of some grapes and rum mixed in as well. Very nice. Taste was pretty much the same as the aroma. Also some earthy tones kinda came into the middle I've noticed with some ever so slighty spicy taste for good measure. The only complaint I have is that it's a little too thin. But other than that it's an exceptional beer.,Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Belgian Dark Strong Ale,94
22,30,Afterburner,4.77,"Note: This is one of my all-time favorite beers. It's just a fantastically well-balanced brew, flavorful and robust.  Appearance: Pours a thick, hazy brown with minimal head and lacework.  Smell: Hops, malt, cloves, raisins, and faint hints of coriander.  Taste: Brown sugar at the beginning, almost like a soda fountain Root Beer that's been undercarbonated. Mid-palate brings out the hops and the malt, with strong plum/raisin notes. Finish is short-to-moderate, with cloves and oranges on the back of the throat, and just a hint of anise. Also a mild alcohol sensation.  Mouthfeel: Just a hair too spritzy for this flavor. I think a smaller bead would allow a more thorough enjoyment of the beer.  Drinkability: Dangerously drinkable, given the alcohol content. I can, and have, thrown back 3 or 4 of these in short order, only to regret it later.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Belgian Dark Strong Ale,94
22,30,99bottles,4.1,"12 ounce bottle that reads a 'best before date' of 02-20-05. Tough poo. I can't wait that long. The beer has idiot proof warnings about pouring it into pilsner glasses, so into the tulip it goes. Nice deep brown color with red hints. A vibrant head rises and then falls. Small lace remains throughout. Large sediment chunks in the very bottom, even with a slow pour. A rich malt smell rises and then wet leaves and carmel notes dominate. The standard fruity-alcohol flavors are there also, with cherries and fresh plums. Taste is very smooth with an interesting hop bite in the aftertaste. Again, uber-chewy malt gives this a heavy sweetness, but there is just enough balance to pull it through. Very much like Celebrator, with some New World kick to it. It's not quite authentic, but it is tasty. Probably Uni's best offering, IMO.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Belgian Dark Strong Ale,94
22,30,DaveGood,4.85,"This beer poured a dark, rich brown with a thin tan head that did not subside throughout the tasting. The aroma can best best characterized as very malty, with a nice fruit scent and a hint of chocolate. The taste is extremely smooth and filled with dark roasted malts, sweet fruits, and a slight hint of chocolate. The high alcohol content is very well masked by the overall rich taste of this beer. The mouthfeel is extremely pleasant due to the slight carbonation and the drinkability is dangerously high. This could very well, without a doubt, become one of my all-time favorite beers!",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Belgian Dark Strong Ale,94
22,30,brewdlyhooked13,4.13,"Appearance - poured into a monik glass, a quick 5 finger head formed up. Bubbles down fairly quick, good deal. Cloudy reddish iced tea color with a little sediment and many bubble trails.  Aroma - fruity and spicy at first, a little yeastiness develops after a bit. Pleasant sweet fruit presides however.  Taste - fruity, big, not exactly winy, not yet anyway. It's pretty cold, but I'm getting plenty of nice Belgian ale style taste. Some light balancing tartness/bitterness. Some warming alcohol presence, which after some warming does start to have some winy feel to it. Dandy stuff.  Mouthfeel - fairly medium body, but solid. Gets smoother as gets warmer. Lots of bubbles, leaves a lingering fruity taste behind.  Drinkability - very tasty, worth a repeat performance, even at 9% abv.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Belgian Dark Strong Ale,94
22,30,soper2000,4,"Poured a dark rich brown with an enormous white head, I wasn't watching my pour and ended up dumping the sediment straight in, oh well. Smell is very full of fruit. Plums, raisins dominate my perception. Taste is pleasant, but i was kind of expecting something on the level of St Bernardus abt 12. This is very solid but just didn't seem to have the same depth. It's fairly complex, just not something i could get lost in. Mouthfeel is good. Drinkability seems to be decent as well. I love the Unibroue line, this is definetly a beer a will purchase again. Just not my fave.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Belgian Dark Strong Ale,94
22,30,TerryW,4.1,"Dark cola brown. Pours up a good sized heavy that settles to a thick, heavy film. Laces all the way to the bottom of the glass.  Aroma is sweet and malty, lots of raisins and fruit. Slightly spicy, clearly Belgian in style. This one smells good as soon as you pop the bottle and is quite inviting.  Smooth, sweet and full of malt to drink. Rich dark fruit. The high alcohol is managed quite nicely, warming to drink but not distracting.  An enjoyable beer.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Belgian Dark Strong Ale,94
22,30,jed,4.1,"Presentation: Menacing looking, 33 cl black bottle with church buildings and a horse on the front. Foil cap. The back of the label has information about the beer in German and French, along with suggested serving glassware. Best if consumed by 11/09/06. Poured into a chalice.  Appearance: Pours a solid, dark brown color with a small, tan-colored head. Excellent head retention; the head leaves behind a thick web of lacing around the entire glass as it disappears. Very active carbonation with trails of bubbles streaming up from the bottom of the glass.  Smell: A mix of traditional Belgian-style aromas, especially the dark fruits, combined with grass/grain, carob and cocoa smells, and a hint of some kind of tart fruit.  Taste: Nose of clove-like spice and toasted malt, followed by dark fruits flavors. Slight astringency in the middle along with some raw graininess. Hops are there if you're looking for them, but not a prominent part of the flavor. Finishes dry, with hints of bittersweet chocolate and some buttery sweet notes. Lingering flavors of toasted malt and carob. Warming alcohol sensations, but the actual flavor of the alcohol is perfectly masked. Bitterness and malt flavors fade a bit as the beer warms. The tart sweetness, which a lot of people have likened to candied cherries, also becomes more evident.  Mouthfeel: Very smooth, with two major caveats. First, Trois Pistoles in noticeably heavy on the carbonation. Second, there are some strange astringencies in the beer, which leaves an extremely dry aftertaste. Together, the two problems really detract from the mouthfeel.  Drinkability: Damn  the 9% alcohol in Trois Pistoles is perfectly concealed, so you never taste raw alcohol flavors. Obviously too big to be a session beer, but still nicely drinkable.  Another solid offering from Unibroue. Not as complex as some of the higher end Belgian offerings, but a nice take on the Belgian Strong Dark Ale style. If you like Imperial Stouts, you'll probably enjoy the influence of that style on this beer. My only real complaint with this beer is the mouthfeel, which hurts the overall experience. Still, very tasty.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Belgian Dark Strong Ale,94
22,30,blitheringidiot,3.71,"So tonite is for gun-slinging with a Best before July 2, 2006 355mL bottle of Trois Pistoles. I might not live that long to await this mouth watering Belgian strong dark. BA brownie points : Slick silver foil label boasting 9% alc./vol.  Huge, rock-solid, lumpy, foam tan ½  head subsides to a Guiness like head coating. Dark, cloudy, purple-brown, zero bubbles pour. A vigourous upside-down pour for full experience yeilds celery & cinnamon, aroma ending with dusty attic trunk notes. Clingy lace streams down the glass. 9% ABV is totally well hidden.  Initial, light tastes of raisins meets robust nutmeg & ginger with prominent carrot cake. Then, mellowed flavor meets hints of almond extract. Yeasty, dry, Earthy & slightly detectable tacky cocoa aftertaste. As she warms, she develops more bakers chocolate aroma & flavor.  Easy in the carbonation department, smooth & little creamy. High drinkability marks especially for 9% ABV. Look out! Mild zest if this sits on me tongue.  Last swigs: This is a beguiling 9% dark, raisin-hint spice, while quaffable, high quality Belgian. Id like to try a 750-mL well cellared caged cork. Seek-worthy for the adventuresome. Unique taste. Paid $58+tax for a Uniboue mixed with this as a four-pack.  Beer is good. Happy beering.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Belgian Dark Strong Ale,94
22,30,watermelonman,4.32,"This poured to a plain dark color with a decent head that shrank quickly but stuck around in small form. There's very little lace left in the glass. Bubbles cling to the side of the glass but slide down after each sip.  The taste has hints of fruit with a potent alcoholic punch.  It's a very good beer, and stronger than Maudite, but it may not be as well balanced. Still, the layering in the taste makes one come back for subsequent sips out of curiosity.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Belgian Dark Strong Ale,94
22,30,GuinnessSmurf,4.08,"Hats of to Unibroue. This is yet another delicious brew.  It pours a big (full) brown color into the glass with a hearty head. The smell is complex and difficult to define - some alcohol, fruit and something, je ne se quoi.  The flavor is a mixture of hops and dark fruits - they combine in the mouth together for a very pleasant, big flavor that lasts well beyond the actual sip.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Belgian Dark Strong Ale,94
22,30,sponberg,4.4,"Served in a pint glass.  Not that far different than the bottle. The same big, chewy, portlike character is there along with hints of black cherry. The biggest difference that I found was a distinct ""prickly"" mouthfeel on tap. This may be due to the keg not having time to settle down overnight, but it did detract a bit from its drinkability. I will try this again in a couple of days and reassess if needed.  Serve this on nitro mix and rename it ""Trouble."" With a capital T.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Belgian Dark Strong Ale,94
22,30,woemad,4.42,"Bottle purchased at Huckleberry's in Spokane for $2.59. I love the Unibroue labels. Hell, I love Unibroue beers! This one has what looks like a demonic version of Pegasus rampaging in a red sky above what is probably a church.  Poured a very dark brown - so dark I thought it was pitch black until I held it up to the light. Very small tan head that dissipated quickly, but left a foamy collar throughout it's duration in my goblet. Nice sheets of lacing.   Smell was complex. Very sweet, sugary malts vying for attention with dark fruits. Also a ""winey"" smell.  Taste is simultaneously sweet and sugary AND dark and bitter. Imagine a sweet belgian pale ale combined with an imperial stout. The darker aspect of the flavor keeps the beer's feet on the ground and prevents the sweeter aspects from becomng too cloying.One thing that does not show up in the taste is the 9% abv. This goes down very easy.  Mouthfeel is just about right. It is substantial without being too thick. For a beer with this much going on, it is charmingly light without being too whimsical.  This is very drinkable. It's just as well that there is a dark bitter aspect, otherwise someone might be tempted to drink a lot of it at once. At 9%abv, this would be a bad thing come morning. I think I have now tried every Unibroue offering that I can get around here. Hopefully a journey to an area with more beer options - like, say, Seattle or Portland - will change that.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Belgian Dark Strong Ale,94
22,30,RootedFool,3.82,"Bought a 750 at the North Coast Co-op in Arcata, California.  I love the macabre, fantastical label.  Pours with barely a half inch of bubbly foam that falls fast, leaving some gray swirls of film on the surface of the brew. The body is black, but on closer inspection it has a brown glow.  The smell is of intensely sweet malts, very brown sugary, dark fruits (raisins, prunes), and sinus-evacuating alcohol.  Taste opens with a bitter-sweet nudge that elevates into a sharp sweetness like bananas drenched in caramel and lots of powdered sugar -- and throw a few maraschino cherries on top. The sweetness holds through to the finish, with some hop bitterness sitting in the corner and barely saying a word.  The high ABV warms my gut, throat, nose and spirit; but isn't evident in the taste.  Lots of carbonation, gives the mouthfeel an airy quality that's pleasant, but leaves some puckering stickiness on my palate.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Belgian Dark Strong Ale,94
22,30,ppoitras,4.7,"12ozer, purchased at Main St. Liquors, Monson, MA, as part of do-it-yourself mixed 6 pack. Foiled cap.  Poured into a Rapscallion snifter, hearty inch tall tannish colored head formed on top of an extremely cloudy reddish-mahogany hued brew. Good lacing, after swirling it justs hangs on the sides of the glass. Sweet, malty aroma, with a tinge of alcohol. Nice, hearty, bready flavor, with hardly any taste of the alcohol, just the slow, warming trend down the esophagus. Nice. Just what I expect from a dark Belgian-style ale.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Belgian Dark Strong Ale,94
22,30,jsolack,4.8,"Appearance: Dark brown, light head. Looks thick and cloudy.  Smell: Chocolate and licorice come first and mild coffee comes later.  Taste: Absolutely great taste! Very sweet in the mouth. Very little bitterness. Has sweet brown sugar aftertaste.  Mouthfeel: Smooth and thick in mouth. Little carbonation.  Drinkability: I could drink the whole 750ml bottle... probably the best tasting beer I've had.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Belgian Dark Strong Ale,94
22,30,HiroProtagonist,4.7,"Trois Pistoles was served from a 750 ml. corked and caged bottle. It poured dark brown but in a Duvel tulip it was nearly black, and glowed a hazy reddish-orange-brown with backlighting. It was topped with a beautiful creamy off-white head that left very nice lacing. The fantastic nose was beaming with fruity esters, dominantly cherries, dipped in fine chocolate. Other esters were noticable just outside of the spotlight, such as cantolope and coconut. A tad of alcohol was present from time to time. The taste closely reflected the nose, but was much more complex. Again, the dominant sensation was one of sweet, dark cherries and chocolate, but this time, a whole world of other fruits/flavors danced over the palate. I imagined notes of cola, melon, pear, apple, banana, and bready yeast. All of this was presented with an active bite from the start, which contributed significantly in launching the flavor score to ""exceptional"". This wonderful world of flavor was followed by a sensation of warming in the throat and lingering flavors of sasparilla, cola, chocolate, and cherry. The body was fluffy, very smooth, and full. In conclusion, Trois Pistoles is a superb creation: Big complex flavor and strong, yet meticulously balanced and deft enough to make for easy drinking. This is likely my favorite Unibroue!",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Belgian Dark Strong Ale,94
22,30,Shaw,4,"Trois Pistoles pours a dark brown with a very foamy brown head that quickly vanishes. Its aroma is malty with fruit and nuts notes. Quite complex.  The taste is equally complex. Malt and nut flavors combine with other tastes while a noticeable alcohol flavor presides over 'em all. Quite a nice taste.  The body is good and solid, despite the alcohol level.  I'm a big fan of Belgian Strong Dark Ales and Trois Pistoles is an excellent example. Unibroue maintains its reputation for quality with this ale.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Belgian Dark Strong Ale,94
22,30,stewart124,4.5,"This pours a very dark marroon color with a fizzy tan head that disaptes quickly. No lace left behind. Smell is of dark ripe fruit with plum and raisin coming to mind. Very sweet smelling. The taste is extremely sweet with dark roasted malts and a very slight hint of chocolate. The fruits really bring out this beer with plums, raisins and figs. The alcohol is well hidden under the rich taste of this beer. The aftertaste is just as the bottle says ""old port wine"". A quality product from Canada.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Belgian Dark Strong Ale,94
22,30,ZAP,4.12,"Excellent beer but enjoyed ""Terrible"" more...  Pours a cloudy ruby red....minimall head....nose is sweet dark fruits...black cherries...plums..even some grapes...flavors are dark fruits too...plums...but also a big peach flavor that jumps out..some spicy alcohol notes..  Mouthfeel is carbonated...slightly spicy from the alcohol....  Overall a high quality brew...but I'll take ""Terrible"" any day over this...",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Belgian Dark Strong Ale,94
22,30,Ellbert,3.06,Appearance: Very nice dark amber color with brown highlights. A very nice tan head formed to leave a beautiful lace.  Smell: Sweet yet lightly spicy. No alcohol is evident in the smell.  Taste: Sweet with some light spices that are mixed very well in the flavor. Alcohol is evident but not too strong or overpowering.  Mouthfeel: Full bodied and consisten with enough carbonation to make the exprience very pleasureable.,Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Belgian Dark Strong Ale,94
22,30,Hex92,4.67,"Poured kinda cloudy and the head disappeared quickly with no lacing. But the beer was great in all other categories. Amazing flavor, smell etc. You can kinda taste the alcohol, but its not overpowering. Very good beer overall. Definitely in my top 10-15.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Belgian Dark Strong Ale,94
22,30,babyhobbes,4.33,"Mmmmm, Unibroue!  This poured a nice brown color with a good-sized white head. It smells of malt and delicious spicy fruits. The taste is very much like the smell. The fruit is definitely more noticeble at the end. There isn't much sweetness here either. It's just right! This feels great in the mouth and has just enough foamy thickness to enhance the flavors. This is a drinkable brew and I'd like to have another. Alas, there is only one.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Belgian Dark Strong Ale,94
22,30,resirob,4.37,"My second selection from Unibroue, and a fine one at that.  Poured a dark, mysterious, murky black/brown. The tan foamy head sticks around and leaves behind some beautiful Belgian lace to contemplate while sipping this wonderful elixir.  Aromas of wet hay, roasted malts, dark fruit, pear, chocolate, and some slight solvent esters.  Fruity beginning with a pleasant sweetness (not cloying), giving way to chocolate and a spicy, coffee-like dry finish. Alcohol lends a warming touch at the end.  Crisp and smooth mouthfeel.  Alcohol is hidden enough to make this beer drinkable, perhaps dangerously so. This one is destined to become a staple in the beer fridge.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Belgian Dark Strong Ale,94
22,30,vwahaszee,3.54,"The beer was black, without much head. It smelled good, a berry type of smell. The taste was pretty good, you can certainly taste the fruit, as well as a somewhat chocolate taste. However, I didn't like the mouthfeel of the beer, since it had very little carbonation, and by the time I finished the 750 ml bottle, I had had enough of the beer.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Belgian Dark Strong Ale,94
22,30,CortexBomb,4.8,"Remarkable beer here, the appearance is cloudy dark brown with plenty of head, and the smell is fruity but the flavour is where it shines.  The beer starts out with big dark fruits with plums being noticeably present along with some pears and the typical Unibroue yeast flavour with nary a hint of the 9% alcohol content. The finale also has a surprising cherry hint. These flavours work remarkably well together, and this is a very tasty beer, probably my favourite Belgian Dark.  Mouthfeel is very carbonated and while still maintaining body while the drinkability is very good, this beer is smooth, and despite the distinct and strong fruity tinge. Dangerously drinkable.  Trois the crown jewel of Unibroue's all around marvelous line of craft beers. Balanced, beautiful, and tasty. A must try experience for all beer fans.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Belgian Dark Strong Ale,94
22,30,yankeeheel,3.97,Not at all what I expected.  Not an impressive looking beer at all in the glass. Pours a coppery brown with a minimalist(I'm being kind)head. Perhaps I had a leaky bottle but the carbonation is just not showing itself. Smells weakly candy like with some sugars and nutmeg coming through. The taste is rather flat off the top with a real nice ramp up to the spices and brownie like texture. Carbonation is a little more present on the palate. Extremely easy on the tounge with a real smoth mouthfeel. Slightly sweet and very dry. Definitely a sipping beer.,Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Belgian Dark Strong Ale,94
22,30,NearerMyBeerToMe,4.22,"Pours out with a huge, bone-white head of small, dense bubbles that quickly fizzes out like a soft drink. Bah! (Disclaimer: I have had samples that look much better, easily worth a rating of ""4."") Threre's a bit of oozy cling to the liquid itself. Color of beer is near-opaque ebony; just a little bit of light comes through at the sides. Aroma is sweet from across the room; up in the nose it suggests fresh, sugary plums and black cherries; baking spices (mostly nutmeg?); and a strong, persistent yeast backbone that is somehow not bready. It's like they took my mom's black forest cherry cake and turned it into a beer. Despite the imposing appearance, nosefeel is delicate, cool, and expansive. Sweet taste (again, fresh! plums and black/sour cherries) would border on cola but a zap of spice (cinnamon especially, but also clove/nutmeg) levels it out, getting quite spicy in midpalate. The label suggests ""port wine,"" okay, I can see that; there's a continually developing tannic/dusty grapeyness to it. A combination of fresh fruit ""plumpness"" and dry fruit sweetness... Bold carbonation in a near-fudgy mouthfeel dries out to a very full, dry, powdered-chalky finish that takes its time moseying away. No alcohol detectable at any point, even at 9 abv. Superb as a digestif and bordering on decadent. Mm.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Belgian Dark Strong Ale,94
22,30,counselor,3.83,"Pours a dark brown with a moderate head. Muted aromas of nuts, plums, roasted meats. The flavors are similarly soft, of mild meats, slow roasted vegetables, and overipe fruits. The mouthfeel is well balanced and the beer goes down smoothly with little of the alcohol taste present in this offering (9%). A decent beer, but not as up front as some other of this style, and less so than this brewers other offerings.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Belgian Dark Strong Ale,94
22,30,GreenWBush,4.56,"This beer forced me to taste it - when I unscrewed the 12 oz bottle, a rush of froth came pouring out of it unexpectedly and I had to taste it (or catch it, depending on how you look at it) as it was bubbling out of the bottle.  Once I decanted it into a glass, I was absolutely amazed by its head formation. The head on this baby was huge and noisy - audible from almost a foot away with its bubbles. The head instantly slumped away into a tiny rim of dirty white.  This strong dark ale is well, dark. It is a nice dirty nearly non-translucent brown. There is a bit of that sour Belgian yeast flavor on the nose.  The taste of this one surprised me for sure! I was expecting something deep and slow-drinking, but instead I found a roasty, chocolately treasure! There is a wheat consistency here, but nothing overwhelming - it really excells with its high-carbonated almost hoppy self.  I will go out of my way to get this one again.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Belgian Dark Strong Ale,94
22,30,JamesBerry,4.23,"As expected, another victory for Unibroue. Straight out of the bottle, Trois Pistoles is mean. Like the image on the label, this beer is dark and broody with more than a few surprises up its sleeve (like the unnoticably high 9.0% abv). From its black body arises the aroma of fruit, like unripened pears. On the tongue, it feels at once crisp and dry as well as mellow. No hops are needed for this to stand tall like the Three Towers of its name. Very drinkable, but probably not recommended for long sessions, unless you've got the liver for it.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Belgian Dark Strong Ale,94
22,30,Zorro,4.2,"Pours a clear Coke a Cola brown with lots of carbonation.  Smells slightly sour and spicy, with malt and molasses in there too. Also has a mild nutty aroma.  Tastes mildly sweet and bitter, with an unmistakable alcohol bite. This is a very subtly flavored beer.  Mouthfeel is good.  An exceptionally easy to drink brew, very mild. If you like strongly flavored beers this will not satisfy you. If you like subtle flavors then this beer is for you.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Belgian Dark Strong Ale,94
22,30,Foxman,4.32,"It pours an opaque ruby brown, the color of dark tea. A tight, light tan head blooms, then settles gradually to an uneven film of froth, with pillows of soft foam floating independently on the surface. Dotty lacing slides slowly southward from whence it came.  The aroma brings a healthy waft of grain earthiness, along with a dry citrus aura. The sourness of the yeast is mild enough to be a true asset. Berry fruit notes swirl at the outside of the aroma. Alcohol appears after the rest of the elements have dissipated.  A sweet grain backbone supports strains of dry grapefruit citrus along with mild toasted tones of caramel. A yeasty dough-like sourness plays nicely with the malt components. There's a very slight phenolic resonance at the top of the mouth that disappears as quickly as it arrived. A real alcohol presence works its way forward toward the end. The finish yields a distant but pleasant lingering cherry memory. Overall, not complicated, but basic and balanced, and a model of well-brlended simplicity.  Slightly heavier than medium bodied, it coats and lubricates sensuously. The buoyant flavors combine with the body and carbonation to swirl and fill the mouth.  Again, it's not complicated, it's just great! There's no need to hunt and peck through the flavors; each piece fits well and compliments the others. Each character is enjoyable and alluring. In spite of the very present high ABV, I'll brave the alcohol for future indulgences. There's just enough of each thing, and never too much of any one thing, so three cheers for the Three Coins!",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Belgian Dark Strong Ale,94
22,30,dauss,4.85,"I picked up a 750ml corked bottle of this brew. Pours a cloudy orange red. Massive light yellow-brown head with a very gentle pour. Dissapates at a moderate pace but never fully disappears. Smells a lot different than other beers I've had. If you let it warm up in the mouth you can faintly taste the alcohol. Its a little fruity, very malty, and has a very good wine-like aftertaste. With a 9% ABV, it is deceivingly drinkable. A very fine brew indeed.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Belgian Dark Strong Ale,94
22,30,stirgy,4,"This one is a murky amber mahagony color and is topped off with a thin off-white head of foamy goodness. Sweet sugary fruits in the aroma -almost like a pre-made sweet and sour mix. Deep and complex sweetness in the taste. There's a touch a smoky caramel malt, sweet spices, fruits and licorice. Very nice. Alcohol is well hidden behind all of the strong flavors. It's a medium bodied beer that is very flavorful and very much enjoyable. Not a session beer, but an enjoyable treat.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Belgian Dark Strong Ale,94
22,30,jeffboo,4.06,"This brew is eye candy, with its chocolate brown color and thick, bubbly head. It just looks fantastic in a glass. The complex aromas of sweet, ripe fruits (cherries/plums) billow out of the glass. It has a full, sweet body holding flavors of caramel, chocolate, and cherries/raisins, finishing alcohol dry. The finish looses it a bit for me with the strong alcoholic bite but otherwise a great evening drink.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Belgian Dark Strong Ale,94
22,30,benmiliron,4.8,"Yes! This is a beautiful offering from Unibroue. Possibly better than Fin du Monde? Paid 9.99 for a three pack of bombers, a xmas special!  Pours a beautiful brown reddish purple color. Smells fantastic, malty bitterness with bitter fruit. Taste is fantastic. Malt, then fruit - but not sweet fruit. Just right. Amazing blending. Hints of port and spiced candy. A good warming rush of alcohol. Just awesome.  Mouthfeel a little foamy, but thick enough that it doesn't bother you that much.  Very drinkable with food. You can easily put away a big bottle of this (or two) despite the ABV.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Belgian Dark Strong Ale,94
22,30,edchicma,4.32,"Well, I think I am finally able to constructively evaluate stronger brews. In the past the alcohol was usually evident and that influenced my evaluation. Now I am able to pick up more of the subtleties and this offering has some great subtleties. Appearance was like dark cherries witha beautifully carbonated head that remained, though somewhat diminished down the glass. Smell..mmmm..cherry-like IMHO, alcohol undertones, with some yeasty elements... a great blend. Taste was equally complex...fruity, alcohol, yeast, wine-like elements. Mouthfeel...medium with a beautiful astringency at the finish. For the abv (9.0) very drinkable.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Belgian Dark Strong Ale,94
22,30,ChrisBowers,3.88,"Served from a 750ml bottle. Pours a dark mahogany with a decent head that disspates fairly quickly. Smell is of fruit, a little sweetness and some alcohol. There was a lot of carbonation to this bottle. I've read other people saying theirs was undercarbonated. Not this one. If anything, it got much better as the carbonation mellowed out. Flavor is of ripe fruit, spicy, a little bit of chocolate and rich malt. Just a little hops and an amazingly dry finish. There was also a little alcohol present in the taste. All in all this is a very good beer, but I think it still has a little ways to go before I'd put it up there with strong ales such as St. Bernardus Abt 12. There's nothing that I dislike about this beer... however, it didn't knock my socks off either.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Belgian Dark Strong Ale,94
22,30,Admiraldinty,4.38,"Wow, this stuff is fantastic. Pours a deep brown/mahogany with a beautiful light tan head. Aroma is grassy, alcohol and berry-like. Very dry, but smooth mouthfeel. Taste is spicy, berry (or perhaps cherry). A little bit of chocolate perhaps. Some caramel, and minor hops. Very earthy. This may be one of the best Belgian dark ales I've had in a while. Fairly cheap too.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Belgian Dark Strong Ale,94
22,30,mntlover,4.8,"What the gods would drink. Dark brown brew with slight hint of red nice tan head that subside to a ever clinging ring of foam. Smells of dark wonderful fruity paradise, plums, raisens, bananas list goes on. Tastes the same fruity flavored malt slight yeast taste with a small touch of hops, and a nice dry finish.Sweet wonderful brew this must be what Homer is thinking of when he says"" ummm beer"", definatley better then any Duff I have ever had. Extremely drinkable must always have some on hand, if you have not tried it please do yourself a favor and buy some.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Belgian Dark Strong Ale,94
22,30,BierReise,3.97,Poured a very deep reddish brown and clear with a tan head that dissapears quickly. Wonderful fruity malty aroma that reminds me of a good Belgian ale. Mouthfeel is lively and medium bodied. Has an excellent balanced flavor of malts that gives a fruity roasted malt flavor that could equal many of its Belgian cousins. Finishes with a sugary sweetness that is abundantly pleasant. Probably the best widely available ale of this style.,Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Belgian Dark Strong Ale,94
22,30,avylover,4.04,"I believe what I may have here is a bad bottle. The cork popped with a barely audible thud, and carbonation is grim. Since this seems to be a brewers fault, I'll review this one. Quality control should come into play in overall score. I have not even tried this yet - it just ""sounded"" bad.  Pours cloudy brown, with very little carbonation. There is a slight lace around the edge of my glass. Aroma is quite fruity, with some apples, plums, and grapes showing up. Some maltiness lingers in the background. Taste starts off with a bready maltiness. Then a good kick of fruit & alcohol comes through. The mouthfeel is full of tiny bubble carbonation, again I think this is due to a bad bottle. This is fizzy like soda pop, not what I expected from Uniboue. The mouthfeel if full and slightly sticky overall decent. Drinkability is great on this one, bad bottle or no. Pretty good for a 'bad' bottle. I think this may have been a bit premature.   Note - This is my third bad bottle from Uniboue (2 maudites)",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Belgian Dark Strong Ale,94
22,30,bditty187,4.33,"Deep brownish-red hue, dense and murky with minimal light penetration, the beige head reached a good two fingers in height. The retention was excellent; the pack of bubbles lasted the entire quaff. Unorganized sheets of lace doted the side of my glass. The aromatics on the nose were impressive and deceiving. The bouquet was surprisingly light and airy with pleasant whiffs of pepper, traces of marshmallows, bready-yeastiness and yeasty fruitiness too. Plus there is an excellent hint of chocolate malts. While the potency is modest it is inviting and complex. The palate is light, with subtle fruitiness upfront, apples mainly, a kiss of marshmallow that is engulfed by the pepperiness and then lightly roasted, chocolate malts of the middle and finish. In the end the maltiness is pleasantly secondary, as hints of dates, raisins, and horse blanket shine more. The aftertaste is unearthly with apples, pepper, fruitiness, and maltiness, somewhat dry. A stunningly well crafted beverage, devilish really, the 9% abv is absent on the palate. I did, however, notice the beer on the brain. Warming. The body is medium; excellent levels of carbonation it is just firm enough. Wow, the ease of consuming this ale is scary, considering it is an extremely complex brew. If, for some odd reason youve failed to try this beer, you must. Trois Pistoles is simply lovely. Unibroue has sold me on their greatness. I scored this 750 ml in Kansas City. I want more.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Belgian Dark Strong Ale,94
22,30,kwalters,4.57,"I had this fabulous Unibroue product poured into a chalice out of a 750ml bottle.  The only thing that kept the appearance score down was the lack of a nice fluffy head. This may be par for the style, but what head did appear was soon gone. The raisin brown color was very appealing.  The smell is of brandy/rum/raisins/plums...deep, rich, sweet, and alchoholic in nature.  The taste is out of this world! Admittedly, I typically don't fall head over feet for Belgian ales, but this strong dark ale is the exception. I place it above Maudite, Chambly, and La Fin Du Monde easily. If it weren't a bit pricey I'd keep it around at all times.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Belgian Dark Strong Ale,94
22,30,Crosling,4.22,"Pretty nice! Poured a hazy dark red with a moderate sized even after a fast pour. Nice head to start out but died quickly and left a slippery lace that didn't stick. This saddened me.  Nice fragrance on this one but nothing special. Dark fruits, bready malts and yeast. High alcohol well hidden in the aroma.  Outstanding flavor! Raisins, yeast, plums, prunes, buttered bread and alcohol. Very smooth going down with great mouthfeel.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Belgian Dark Strong Ale,94
22,30,masterbruewer,3.43,"I expected to be amazed by this beer, based on its ranking and all. Maybe I got an off batch or something, but it wasn't the best I've ever had. It started off skunky and advanced to good.  Pours a dark brown with minimal lacing from a 12 oz bottle.  Smelled complex, but almost a bit skunky. A wide range from hops to fruity to malty.   The taste began slightly skunky but as it warmed up and breathed a bit, other, better flavers emerged, a fruity, spicy blend, similar to a really good cider. Left an aftertaste like cloves mixed with pumpkin pie.  The mouthfeel was OK, very tingly with carbonation and a little on the thick side.  This beer grew on me a little. I'd drink another sometime, but I'm not in a hurry. It was drinkable, and enjoyable as a flavor excursion, but not remarkable.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Belgian Dark Strong Ale,94
22,30,AtLagerHeads,4.1,"A lovely brew that satisfies the need for complexity. A great looking copper/dark amber body is covered with a rich, thick head of cream that laces throughout the glass. An aroma of fruit greets the drinker with a smell of grapes and cherries, perhaps even a bit of raisin and plum. The spicy, fruity flavors are just as complex with a strong sense of vinous quality. A bit of spice and cloves carries through as well. The medium body is lasting and gives a bit of strong aftertaste, almost syrupy in its finish. The drinkability is good considering the high ABV.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Belgian Dark Strong Ale,94
22,30,NJpadreFan,2.38,"Trois Pistoles is the 2nd beer from Unibroue I've tried. Comes in a cool bottle!!  3 pistols pours a caramel/amber with a nice thick creamy tan head. The head lingers a long time!  The smell is very fruity; grapes mostly. My nose didn't pick up much more than that. Tasting the beer I noticed a fruit flavor (grapes) but there was a metallic and alcohol taste very much present! 3 Pistols seemed a little too carbonated almost like champagne.  The aftertaste was unplesant. very sweet and medicinal. Overall, I don't think I'll be able to finish the bottle. Just not my cup of beer.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Belgian Dark Strong Ale,94
22,30,Rastacouere,4.29,"Dark brown with a red gleam. The head is dense, generous and it accompanies you through your journey. Malty and fruity aroma of grape. The taste is complex: an adequate balance of chocolate, roasted caramel, cherries, grapes, spices, yeast (less than Unibroue's standard). A light alcohol (not quite well-hidden, but about what I expect from good belgians of this ABV) Bitterness joins you until the end. It's a rich and complex beverage, but while it's probably not overrated, I prefer many other belgian strong ales to this one..",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Belgian Dark Strong Ale,94
22,30,mschofield,4.82,"Deep red-brown witha crackling tan head. Spicy taste and aroma (thats the only hint you'll get of the 9% abv) Huge cherry in the aroma and taste as well. Very fruity, swirling really brings out the fruit flavor (adds plum). Spice grows as it warms. I don't notice hops or bitterness, but there is a nice dark malt base to the brew. Medium feel, and very drinkable at least to the point you're still able to lift your glass.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Belgian Dark Strong Ale,94
22,30,ComradeCanadia,4.14,"Appearance:  Lovely bottle with some really neat art on the front. Big & corked like all the Unibroue I've seen.  It poured out nice and dark, with a decent head that subsided quickly. Residual yeast could be seen, adding a bit more. Very attractive when poured.  Smell:  Oh god does this beer smell nice. Cherries, raisins, yeastie bits, caramel was definitely there and maybe some chocolate? Only a HINT of hops, but I'm guessing this is for balancing.  Taste:  Wow, this is complex. I'm tasting far more than I smelled - although I'd have to say the actual taste itself is good, not amazing. This beer is highly alcoholic, but so well made that I can barely tell in the slightest. Fruit flavours preside over all, with the undertones of caramel, and again, that hint of hops.  Mouthfeel:  Again, pretty good. Nice, dry finish, easy drinking - I can't give it more because this beer was cool bordering on tepid, instead of decently cold. Still, very smooth.  Drinkability:  This beer is an endeavour to drink, and I don't think I'd want to go more than one. Still, I'll give it an above average for drinkability.  Notes:  Belgian Dark Ales aren't my favourite, although I think I can appreciate them - and this is a great one. Well balanced, great nose, doesn't look bad in the slightest... easy recommendation for anyone.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Belgian Dark Strong Ale,94
22,30,Sammy,4.77,"One of My favorite beers. Every sip is a different delicious taste sent to the brian. Top pick from Canada's finest brewery will hold its own against Belgian ales. Nice at the end of a meal or for lunch instead of a heavy latte. Five and a half years till finally found on tap, at Volo's, and really not as good on tap, not as much body and taste, though aroma was there.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Belgian Dark Strong Ale,94
22,30,andyj,4.35,"The label art on this one is just evil, it looks very dark and demented. Alas, I was disappointed when I poured it and it came out, red! What the dark ale on lees is going on around here? In reality it is more of a dark reddish-brown than red, and one can see through it as well. It pours quite a creamy-whitish head and the aromas that dance off of this one are quite crazy. This definitely well hopped but with a spice kick of some variety. Perhaps bitter orange peel, coriander, pepper, or even ginger? I couldn't quite place it. This is truly a very unique beer that falls within the belgian variety. I very impressed with what these French Canadians can do with & to beer.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Belgian Dark Strong Ale,94
22,30,taez555,4.6,"12oz bottle with a best before date 3-11-06, tasted 11-16-03.  This beer poured a dark brown/ruby/blackish body with a thick choppy off white head.  The nose was a great mix of classic dark belgian smells. Chocolate, yeast, phenols, plums, raisins, spice, caramel, a touch of pepper, alcohol with an overall sharpness.  The beer was highly carbonated, yet medium bodied and very soft and drinkable. Lots of ripe fruit flavors: grapes, apples, plums, and raisins. Soft dark malts: caramel, chocolate. Yeast, alcohol, some phenol touches, touch of wheat, very juicy and slightly sweet. Almost like a rum soaked raisin. Very port like. Its surprisingly mellow for such a big beer. Almost no hop taste at all, but a perfectly balanced hop bitterness thats so well balanced you barely even notice its there.  Basically, I was blown away by this beer. Its so simple with all these fruit tones and mellow dark malts. I swear the brewers at Unibroue are really Belgians. This is an amazing beer, and for the price a steal.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Belgian Dark Strong Ale,94
22,30,Joss,3.98,"Plums, raisins, flowery notes and burned sugar in the aroma. Hazy Bordeaux color with a stable creamy head. Indeed a fruity Port flavor, dusty notes in the aftertaste. Surprisingly light body , dry but a bit fizzy mouthfeel - this makes the beer seem lighter than it really is...",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Belgian Dark Strong Ale,94
22,30,merlin48,4.59,"My 1st bottle put me to sleep last night, but a sip out of the warm glass very early this morning, told me that this is a biere worth reviewing. My 2nd Pistole poured a murky chestnut color, with a one finger head. Aroma is a bouquet of fruitiness, almost floral. Pleasant in the mouth, a nice balance of carbonation, alcohol, malts, and slight hops. Taste is of a nectar like dried fruitiness, combined very well with the distinct hops and alcohol.  This is one of the better brews I've experienced. Very complex, and very interesting. Reminds me of Celebrator toward the end, as it just keeps getting more overwhelming to the senses.  This is a wonderful balance of many complex flavours and aromas. Very finely crafted by the Quebec Unibroue folks. This could become one of my all time favourites. Geeez..I'm starting to spell stuff Canadian(flavour, favourite). This stuff is hard to find in Kentucky, so I guess I will cellar my remaining two bottles, eh!",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Belgian Dark Strong Ale,94
22,30,DagFishHead,4.37,"12 oz. bottle Appearance: Hazy, chestnut-brown body...has the look of a dark amber apple cider. Tightly-bubbled light tan head lingers with minimal lace. Smell: Clean, crisp, yeasty with sweet malt background. Fall fruits, apple, grape, citrus-crispness. Complex and a key part of the experience. Taste: Sweet full malt, with apples, plums, raisins. Delightfully sour yeast acidity, pleasing dry hop/citrus finish. Very nice balance. Alcohol hangs way back. Mouthfeel: Crisp, tingly carbonation and yeast acidity/dryness. Drinkability: A great sipper... could easily do 2 or 3 of these.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Belgian Dark Strong Ale,94
22,30,DESTRO,3.9,"pours out an amber brown with a little lace. the aroma is spicey and grassy, lightly fruity. the taste packs some spice and alcohol right off the bat. a light hint of chocolate, malt and sweetness, it finishes dry. heavily carbonated and crisp. its good, just not my thing for the most part, but i can respect it none-the-less. take it easy too, this stuff will make you loopy.  $5.99 for the mag.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Belgian Dark Strong Ale,94
22,30,SeanChouffe,4.35,"355ml bottle. Best before 5/7/06 Pours a full tan head, a deep brown color, hazy, opaque. CO2 rolling up along the edges of the lacing. The aroma is malty, spicy, and earthy with a background presence of alcohol and some tartness. The taste is sweet, roasted, and spicy, with a tart middle and a dry finish that lingers with liquorish and sassafras. A medium bodied mouth-feel with sufficient effervescence. A well-rounded brew. Not overpowering for such an intense style. Taste was best around 53 degrees ? started loosing its balance as it warmed more. Might have needed some more aging.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Belgian Dark Strong Ale,94
22,30,moulefrite,4.23,"A difficult beer for me as I will always remember it as the beer I drank as the Cubs lost to the Marlins in the NLCS 2003. And as I forgot to respect it, it got the very best of me the next morning!!! Be Warned!!! The beer poured a very orange/red almost wine like color. The stick was rock solid. Aromatics were fruit driven and complex-melon,sour cherries, botrytis-where's the blue cheese? Medium in body with soft bitter chocolate and light buttery fruitiness. A faint peach and tangy raisin note adds to the finish of this very, very complex and intriguing brew. This is a more wine like offering where the malt plays a second to the fruit. I'm thinking pear and blue cheese-seared foie gras?...incidently, my notes say ""...end of the 9th..Cubs down 9-6...I need four pistoles!! all I can do to keep from throwing this glass to the floor....we got Wrigley?!"" God the hangover sucked the next day.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Belgian Dark Strong Ale,94
22,30,Boilermaker88,4.32,"Trois Pistoles has a hazy black cherry soda color and a creamy off-white head. The aromas wafting out of the glass are a melange of yeasty malt, dark fruits, a hint of chocolate and a mix of spices (coriander, clove, and cinnamon), not to mention a heady alcohol note. Tasting this beer was a real exercise in sorting out all the different flavors. A light clove/banana flavor along with that bready malt taste was noted plus some raisins, plums, dates, and a sweetness not unlike dark chocolate-covered cherries. Trois Pistoles exuded a real candy sweetness. Finished with a spicy bite layered over a warming alcohol kick. Feel was creamy and smooth with a light carbonation tingle. Overall, this was one great beer. Drinkability suffers a bit due to the alcohol it packs. Nevertheless, it's a superbly crafted beer that's just right for slowly drinking over the course of a quiet evening.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Belgian Dark Strong Ale,94
22,30,alexgash,4.49,"Trois pistoles, which I believe is French for ""hungry beer bear,"" pours a dark brown with a light tan head. Smell is wow. Grapes, alcohol, yeast (but not as yeasty as other Unibroues), woody, mmm... Taste is of sweet, candy malts, tart grapes, Unibroue yeast, and oak. Finish is wheat bitter with lingering, warming alcohol and grapes. Mouthfeel is big and champagnelike in carbonation--a little syrupy at the end.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Belgian Dark Strong Ale,94
22,30,shirfan,4.21,"This has the color and clarity of apple cider. Modest off-white lacing remains for the duration of the glass.  Aroma is milder than many belgian-style offerings: what there is hints of raisins and crisp fruit... pear/apples maybe.  Taste empahsizes crispness again. There's a definite mix of estery, fruitlike flavors, but not a hint of syrupy sweetness or chocolate like others in the style. Could be best described as green pear / apple, with a suggestion of green raisins. A definite not-quite-ripe theme. Alcohol is felt rather than tasted.. just a breath of warmth in the finish.  Drinkability wins high marks for being flavorful and complex without feeling heavy or thick or ""big"". This will most definitely be granted a residence in my beer cellar.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Belgian Dark Strong Ale,94
22,30,rdrummer,4.53,"I am becoming more impressed by this brewery every time I get around to drinking a different beer from them. This beer has a deep, hazy brown coloring, almost a coke color, with a nice pale brown head. Its lacing had staying power almost to the bottle of the chalice. I didn't get the normal exceptional aroma that I got from some of their other beers and other dark Belgians, but I may have had enough of a sinus problem to affect that.  The taste was complex, very similar to a Chimay Blue-type taste. I tasted so many flavors, they were hard to differentiate. There was a definite malty taste with a hint of yeast. There are some other spices and herbs in there that I can kind place. I don't taste the chocolate flavot that some dark beers have.  I liked the strong carbonation, which gave a clean feel to the mouth during and after drinking. It packs a wallop of alcohol, whch I think adds quite a bit to the flavor. Overall, an excellent beer.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Belgian Dark Strong Ale,94
22,30,Phyl21ca,3.95,"Dark brown brew with a creamy dark white head. Real fizzy, I still had bubble coming on top five-ten minutes after the brew was pourred.

22,30,beerguy101,4.1,"Dark purple color. Small head. Aroma is slightly vinous, fruity and dusky. Malty and fruity. Very complex flavors; raisins, grapes, figs with a musty undertone. This is a very nice beer. Very smooth, it hides the 9% alcohol very well. There is a hint of alcohol tartness on the tongue. Tasty beer. Mouthfeel is full and round. Finish is slightly bitter.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Belgian Dark Strong Ale,94
22,30,pootz,4.62,"This was my second sampling from Unibroue and they seem consistant in offering great gourmet Belgium beers to the Canadian consumer.  Trois Pistoles weighs in at 9% alcohol and creates a very warming effect that is best appreciated on cold winter nights after skiing or with venison or wild foul dinners. It pours a such a dark ebony color it must be brewed with a whacking roasted malt. Its rich, smooth with real texture, and the presence of the yeast used for in-bottle fermentation gives it a taste and aroma of spiced fruits and an after taste not unlike a stout wine like medeira.  Poured a black color that refuses to let light through the glass with coffee colored head and medium carbonation. Delicious aromas of fruits and spices. Starts very thick and builds to a wondrous full body punctuated with fruit and nut and chocolate tastes then finishes with warmth and a lingering port wine taste",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Belgian Dark Strong Ale,94
22,30,steelreign,4.4,"So complex, so utterly fantastic this amalgamation of flavours and aromas. Sticky white head, frothing almost. Dark cherries, chocolate, slight grassy hop notes, malt and more malt, alcohol....wow, I said complex but this has it all.  So smooth, velvety texture. High carbonation, but not altogether unwelcome. The biting subsides and the warming begins soon after it's gone down. Sweet chewy malts make their way to the front, and a nice warm, dry alcohol finish. A superbly crafted, truly BIG beer! Cheers Unibroue!",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Belgian Dark Strong Ale,94
22,30,kmo1030,4.42,"very dark brown with a light tan head. the smell is fruity like marachino(sp?) cherries and vanilla, a little citrus behind it as well, and a bit of a mild wine smell too some roasted malts in there too maybe. the taste is fruity (cherry, raisin), but mild, slightly peppery. starts sweet and then finishes with a little bitterness to clean things up. at times just a little boozy. i think that the carbonation should be a bit lower and the mouthfeel a bit thicker, but no real problem here. overall one of the best beers i've had the priviledge to drink. try it if you haven't i'm gonna move onto some other unibroue if they're anything like this one",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Belgian Dark Strong Ale,94
22,30,Elemental,4.11,Nice dark thick brown color with a nice thin amount of head. The smell is of yeast with a slight fruitiness along with a raison aroma. The taste is smooth and subtle yet flavorful with hints of fruits and a light aftertaste that tends to linger. Very nice mellow tasting beer that isn't overpowering because of the good balance. Slightly bitter to end with. Though I like the mellowness of the beer I do wish there was a little bit more fullness to the taste but overall a really good beer.,Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Belgian Dark Strong Ale,94
22,30,Hefe,4.87,"Sampled on 9/5/03.  Appearance: A color somewhere between brown and black that gives the impression that something lurks within. Pours with a tannish head that eventually gives way to a bit of lacing.  Smell: Malty and complex, with notes of cherry, vanilla, wheat, orange peel, plum, and a yeasty breadiness.  Taste: Complex yeastiness, reminds me of Bollinger Special Cuvee in a weird way. Plum, raisin, roasted malts, peach/apricot.  Mouthfeel: Again a bit like champagne, but with enough body that the carbonation isn't overwhelming. Big alcohol stays in the background.  Drinkability: A lot of factors at play that could slow you down, but everything here is in perfect balance. Bravo!",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Belgian Dark Strong Ale,94
22,30,Andreji,4.82,"Now This is a Fantastic brew. Took One sip of it and did *that* expression on my face of absolute delight. Happily surprised.  Pours a very dark brown/black thick fluid with an average head between brown and tan that fades quickly as is not very dense.  The smell, a mixture of fruits, strong wheat, malt and hops, is present all the time and is strong enough to fill the room. Delightful.  The taste is very strong and absolutely exceptional. With a delicious weissbier wheat-like base taste that mixes with fruityness, above all some lemony feel and a bit of sweet which fades with the carbonation and in perfect synchronization allows the appearance of a slight bitterness, just at the end, that finishes it off beautifully.  The mouthfeel, for this rather thick but thirst quenching brew is exceptional and the alcohol level (a whopping 9.0) is very well hidden, but makes the drinkability lower than perfect. You don't want it to fool you.  Perhaps the best beer in my stop in the US, and, oh lord, canadian. Wow.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Belgian Dark Strong Ale,94
22,30,daledeee,4.42,Pours nice dark brown with light tan head. Dissappates to a nice light lace. Vanilla and fruit in the nose. Very bubbly to the tongue. Tastes a little like rootbeer. Some vanilla and fruit. Nice velvetty mouthfeel. Very similar to Belgian beer. Another fine Unibroue offering. This is a very enjoyable beer to drink.,Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Belgian Dark Strong Ale,94
22,30,tar,4.38,"Pours a dark, caramely brown, with a think, light tan, foamy head. Aroma is a bit sweet. Floral and fruity (cherries?) scents issue forth. Taste is mellow and nicely sweet, with fruit flavors (plumes, cherries, others) coming through. Almost reminds me of wine in flavor. The finish is dry with a very pleasant, lingering in the mouth. A hint of alcohol is present in the taste as well, but does not take away from the overall wonderful and complex flavors. Very smooth and highly drinkable despite the deceptively high alcohol content.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Belgian Dark Strong Ale,94
22,30,RoyalT,4.57,"Appearance  The thick and dark, almost black, body sits underneath a big head.  Smell  Typical aroma for the style. The dark fruits come out at first, followed closely by the big, dark, bready yeast scents. This is a beautiful fragrance.  Taste  The yeast comes out even bigger here. It is a wonderful flavor, and complimented well by the fruits from the smell. Prunes, raisins, plums, and overly-ripe apricots meld with some banana and tobacco for an excellent flavor.  Behind this comes the yeasty bread. If youve ever made fresh bread and taken a taste of the yeast and sugar mix before all the flour is added, this is it. A baker would appreciate this flavor. It is absolutely phenomenal.  Mouthfeel  I like the big carbonation of this brew, but it may be just a tad off style. But, in the end, this feels great.  Drinkability  The big carbonation slows one down a bit, but this is a work of art.  Comments - Its hard to overachieve in this category, but Unibroue has once again come up with a winner.  Update  I reviewed this initially with a 2003 and thought it would be interesting to review a 2004 vintage. This beer just blows me away. I cant believe that its not brewed in Belgium. I just love so many things about it, but that dark yeast flavor just puts me in heaven. I juggled some ratings around to include upping the Drinkability to a perfect 5.0.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Belgian Dark Strong Ale,94
22,30,chaduvel,4.67,"Bonjour mon amis Unibroue. Is that flying horse going to kick my ass? This imposing brew is very dark crimson little if any light can break through. Fizzy brown head eventually fades to coat the top for eternity. Smells fantastic, a wine like aroma with dark ripe fruits--grapes, plums, and a pleasant yeast aroma as well. I can taste the ripe fruits, and the sweetness is balanced by the mouth numbing Unibroue yeast and hints of alcohol. These mellow dark flavors are sublime.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Belgian Dark Strong Ale,94
22,30,TripelJ,4.4,"Now Quaffing: Trois Pistoles  Pours a nearly opaque, dark mahogany with a thick head of fine bubbles. Little lacing as the head recedes. Aromas are sweet, figs, plums, perfume-like. Mouthfeel is smooth and creamy and definitely of fuller body. Flavors are all sweet and reflect the nose with fragrant plums and a hint of licorice. Incredibly smooth and balanced despite the 9% ABV. Overall this is a fine example of a belgian style strong dark ale, with only a slightly reduced drinkability because of the high alcohol.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Belgian Dark Strong Ale,94
22,30,Running4beer,4.45,"Never seen a beer look like this one. Pours out a solid brown color brew with a thick frothy head that diminishes half way through to a thin lacing. Yeasty, grainy and a bit of malts made up the aroma here actually and a hint of alcohol. Taste was exceptional yeasty and chocolatly also a bit of alcohol and some raisons or some type of fruit. Very drinkable and very good...",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Belgian Dark Strong Ale,94
22,30,ManekiNeko,3.98,"Served chilled from a Trois Pistoles glass (eBay purchase!!!). Poured from a 750 mL corked and caged bottle.  Appearance: Dark brown in color with a khaki head that leaves a thick, but fine, lacing all the way down.  Aroma: Very prominent smell of malt with a decent shot of anise and spiciness of the clove family.  Taste: The first flavor is that of very high quality dark/sweet malt followed by raisiny/plum flavors. I detected a hint of smoke at the finish. Probably the priest's soul or something (read the label for more info).  Mouthfeel: Alcohol is quite nicely balanced by the malt (and other) flavors. Slightly chalky in the finish.  Drinkability: Most decidedly not a session beer. Cries out for food like cheeses and properly crusty bread. Still, it goes down quite smoothly.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Belgian Dark Strong Ale,94
22,30,soilguy,4.02,"This beer has a very dark ruby red color - a fine off white lace is clinging to the side of the glass but not much else in the way of head. It has a very fruity, almost wine-like smell to it. The taste is wine-like, as well - full of fruit, with a slight astringency and a prominent ethanol burn and aftertaste. A full mouthfeel. Not nearly as drinkable as Fin du Monde, however.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Belgian Dark Strong Ale,94
22,30,yen157,3.88,"Much better than La Fin. Huge medium-coarse head that stuck around for some time. Way too much carbonation to start, but after some time it was alright.

This one does the Unibroue name justice.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Belgian Dark Strong Ale,94
22,30,Doppel07,4.5,"Dark ruby-bronze with a huge, frothy Belgian-style beige head. Terrific fragrance that is nearly indescribable, but suggests roses, berries, and a woodshop.

I totally dig this beer.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Belgian Dark Strong Ale,94
22,30,beergeek279,4.02,"Served in the 12 oz. bottle. The color was a dark amber, with good head. The smell was very fruity. The taste was of apple sweetness, with hints of maltiness. Mouthfeel was very heavy. Drinkability-wise, I could probably have one or two more.  I had this right after the Maudite, and I think I slightly prefer the Maudite's sweetness to the fruit flavors of the Trois Pistoles. This, however, is really nitpicking because Unibroue's beers are all simply awesome, and the Trois Pistoles is no exception.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Belgian Dark Strong Ale,94
22,30,ngandhi,4.38,"This is my favorite Unibroue.  The pour is dark amber, with a head that subsides to a good lace.  The nose is mellow raisins and more indicative of what's inside than Fin du Monde. The palette opens to malt after malt after malt and arrives at a taste much like raspberries. Some chocolate notes, I suppose, and mild spice, but mostly this beer is luscious, ripe fruit. A magnificent Belgian; the relationship to Chimay is apparent. The fruits give way to a light hoppiness and then return. The finish is medium dry, the sweetness of the raspberries still holding firm.  Outside of a slight fizziness, the mouthfeel is exceptional. It seems that Unibroue threw a ton of malt into this one and let the yeast go wild. The final product is a relatively sweet, textured brew that drinks dangerously well. With FDM, I know to stop; it's hard to stop with Trois Pistoles. Spectacular effort. Maybe it's too much to ask, but I would have appreciated a little more hop effort. I know, I know -- this beer's not trying to do that; but if it is wanting in anything, it is only in that. Balanced enough as it is though.  A stunning archetype of the Belgian strong dark ale style.  Relax, relax. ng",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Belgian Dark Strong Ale,94
22,30,bigbelcher,3.85,"This is a big beer, 9% alcohol. I think the beer would be better if they made it a little sweeter. As it is not the high alcohol gives you a very warm drinking feeling.

Taste: Sweet malts upfront and throughout; dry spiciness in the finish; secondary characteristics include black pepper, chocolate, banana and slightly toasted grain.

Lingering sweetness on the tongue with hints of port and wooden cask.  Mouthfeel: Very lively and bursting with bubbly falvour. A sweet, cloying finish.

22,30,IronDjinn,4.85,"Another gothic Francophone painting on this label to match the motif of the one on Maudite. Like it's heralding a dark omen. In fact it's trying to say that it is fiendish how good this ale is, so beware of your mortal soul, as you soon may just lose it to this bottle.  Poured from a brown 750 ml bottle, it is a heavenly cherry oak tone, frothy tan head that recedes to a thick ring and some lacing. Nose contains cherries, caramel, spices, mild herbal tones. Flavour is immediately that of sweet malt, sour cherry, some citrus, a bit grassy, a bit woody, then on to a spicy finish, some floral hops, and a boozy sherry-like aftertaste (to be expected with the 9% abv). The flavour then comes back again with a caramel/toffee taste that lingers in the mouth long after it's been swallowed. This ale is utterly remarkable, only the second time I have ever tried it. I am kicking myself now, as I'll soon be setting some bottles aside to mature. If I were a genie, this is the bottle I'd choose to live in.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Belgian Dark Strong Ale,94
22,30,faernt,4.68,This is a huge pleasure of a beer. It isn't the first time I've had this one and definitely not the last. It pours with a pleasant head which dissipates to a golden ring which never really leaves. The color is cinnamon. It forecasts that this is a beer for food. With cinnamon I'd expect a dessert but this beer is firstly a steak beer (trust me here.... I've been drinking it for years) and then with aged goat cheese....it's a pairing to revisit. It tastes wonderful by itself and with food it matures into the straight man in an improv sketch. It's an all night beer. The ABV makes it a short one but worthy.,Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Belgian Dark Strong Ale,94
22,30,Loki,4.9,"Sampled from a 12 oz bottle.  Poured a cloudy, dark, amber brown with a huge light beige head that left fair lacing.  Aromas of perfume, fruit, malt, and yeast. Smelled absolutely heavenly. The nose pulls you in. My fiancee smell the glass and wouldn't hand it back.  The taste is just as good if not better than the smell. Fruit, yeast, malt, and candy. Incredibly smooth and creamy, very little to no carbonation and a little light on the mouth. Goes down way to smooth and to fast. This is the best of the Unibroue line IMHO.  To quote my fiancee, ""This is the best beer I've even had."" I don't know if its the best but definately in the top 10.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Belgian Dark Strong Ale,94

22,30,granger10,4.33,"Pours an amber brownish color that looks thick and has a good sized head. Looks very good. And the taste is equally as good. This beer has a very sharp taste to it (probably from the high amount of carbonation). The sweet malts (namely caramel) are noticeable but not dominate, they just hold the other flavors together. Other flavors include some spicyness from the hops, a dark fruit taste mixed with a dark wine taste. Alcohol is only apparent in the spicy, dry finish. Another great one from Unibroue.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Belgian Dark Strong Ale,94
22,30,stcules,2.37,"Mahogany colour, with winy reflexes. Foam with a very short duration. Smell totally fruit: cherry, orange, strawberry. It is a warm and doughy beer. In the taste the fruity character is less evident. Maybe it is too strong and sharp. A hint of hop in the aftertaste, quite persistent. Medium body, malty. Interesting but a little too dry, and with a little drinkability. The alcool is a little too evident.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Belgian Dark Strong Ale,94
22,30,WVbeergeek,4.52,"Appears a deep amber brown hue almost opaque with a tawny cream colored head with little or no lace forming in my snifter. Aroma really full hop aroma here pine cone scented this hopped up Belgium style barley wine harmonizes with spices and peppery ripened fruit tones and just a touch of an alcholic finish. Taste is difficult to describe teh complexity of this beer is so vast, I will say I love it. A spritzy ginger like sweet tone blended with a nice amount of ripened fruit awesome beer in my opinion. Mouthfeel has a nice carbonation buttery mouthfeel with a medium to full body very well built cerveza. Drinkability is addicting, in the sense that I could sit and daydream about having another one of these beers although feasibly probably a one at time 9% abv big boy.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Belgian Dark Strong Ale,94
22,30,Mitchster,4.2,"Cloudy dark-mahogany in color with a fine sediment of yeast, forming a punchy dark-beige to light-tan head with good retention and minimal lacing. Aroma is actually less apparent than most other Unibroues..maybe my nose is off tonight, but I am only picking up some clove, bananas and apple esters, phenols, vanilla, and some distant plain amber malts. Mouthfeel is initially spritzy and ends bright with a lightly wet finish and subtle slickness. Body is medium-light (Unibroues are always lighter in body than most other beers with the same ABV), and carbonation is medium-strong. Taste begins with a phenolic eruption of bubbles on the tongue, quite spicy at first with cloves and carbonated acidity, followed by some plain amber malts which dissolve slowly into a weak roasted note, sweet light chocolate, a mild metallic taste, some fruity esters towards the end and a brief tang of ruddy, earthy hops in the finish. Dark fruits are minimal. There is a mellow vinous sweetness that lingers in the finish. Alcohol is imperceptable in taste, but it warms the esophagus and packs a pleasant buzz. As it warms, and the carbonation mellows, it becomes more drinkable, but the alcohol becomes slightly perceptable in taste.  Certainly, this is a well-crafted brew, but it just doesn't do as much for me as Don De Dieu, Maudite, or La Fin Du Monde. The light metallic note, overly spicy spritzy mouthfeel and phenolic finish take some getting used to compared to other Unibroues, but it is still a very good beer compared to most.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Belgian Dark Strong Ale,94
22,30,MissOrch,3.98,"I pored this 750ml bottle for a myself and a friend. After the initial pour, the thick head continued to swell, overflowing all over the coffee table. Cleaning up the mess, I noticed the malty, dark, almost sticky sweet murky odor. The lacing remained crusted on the glass until I scrubbed it the next day. The table had a sticky feel the next morning. It tasted malty-sweet, slightly like cherries, or even cherry flavored cough syrup. It also reminded me of sourdough bread, thick and bready, with that sour, mulch-like taste. The high alcohol content knocked me on my ass, and there were no seconds! Not for the meek.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Belgian Dark Strong Ale,94
22,30,euskera,4.2,"750ML bottle..  Pours a out a lightly cloudy brown with a nice head that holds the lacing very well. Smell is on the sweetish side, with malt and a little chocolate overtone. Taste is complex, with cloves and raisins feeling the mouth with the alcohol touching the edges of the tongue. Well balanced and tasty; a brew I'll go back to again easily.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Belgian Dark Strong Ale,94
22,30,BeerResearcher,4.5,"This Dark Ale is a deep brown color with ruby highlights and tan head. The complex aroma includes roasted barley, spicy hops, fruit, cloves and fumes of alcohol. The deep rich malt houses flavors of caramel, toffee and a hint of banana. Highly hopped with spicy and lemony citrusy bitterness along with ripe mixed fruit. A powerful, well made brew!",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Belgian Dark Strong Ale,94
22,30,SheepNutz,4.05,"I had this one in a 12oz. bottle poured into a tulip-style glass. It pours a very dark brown with 2 fingers of head that die off slowly. There is almost no trace of lacing left on the glass. The smell is a sweet aroma of banana and toffee. A strong smell, but not overpowering. The taste has a bit of fruit and caramel to it, with just a hint of toffee. The balance is a little on the malty side, and there is an alcohol taste to the finish. The mouthfeel is okay, but a little bubbly. The drinkability is just fair at 9% abv.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Belgian Dark Strong Ale,94
22,30,PhantomVodoo,3.85,"Murky, dark brown with a tan head. Aroma of yeast, clove, banana, and sweet malts.  Taste shows a substantial sweet, caramel malt backbone. Hops do a decent job of balancing this one. Yeast, clove, and banana also present in the flavor.  Mouthfeel seemed overcarbonated. A bit harsh and the flavor profile didn't strike my fancy. Not nearly as drinkable as Don de Dieu.  Overall, a good beer, but I prefer Don de Dieu or Maudite. I think those 2 both have a better flavor.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Belgian Dark Strong Ale,94
22,30,hotstuff,4.01,"This brew poured a large invigorating tan head with fine-small bubbles that quickly dissolved. The lacing was sparse on the sides of my glass. The body was a reddish brown. The aroma was fruity and sweet. This brew had a smooth taste and a good mouthfeel. I REALLY, REALLY enjoyed drinking this brew!! Do we have more of this one thedm??",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Belgian Dark Strong Ale,94
22,30,TheDM,4.26,"This brew poured an envigorated large head of fine to medium sized bubbles that left little lacing and lasted a good length of time. Its body was a very cloudy semi-opaque deep brown color. It has a very nice strong malt aroma and a very smotth initial flavor that finishes much more complex than it starts. its high alcohol content is well hidden in its flavor. The flavoe is very hard to describe. It is highly complex with a lightly fizzy, tongue tingling sensation of malts and spices. Extremely good brew. I will definately try this again in one of their larger bottles.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Belgian Dark Strong Ale,94
22,30,tavernjef,4.51,"Wild color of dark and deep amber more brown towards the top & moderately cloudy, lots of bubbly carbonation flying up the glass. Super tall head that overpowered and took a few minutes to pour my 12oz bottle into my 14oz brandy glass. Head slowly poofs away and is a puffed whipped cream of dark ivory hue. Tons of heavy settling in the middle and tons of gluey lace in large patches and shelves, great consistency.  Has a nice light citrusy dark aroma, spicy, with caramel and banana notes, some wet breadyness also noted.  Taste is subtle, layered in mellowing smoothness and dark, lots of dark fruits in front of banana, strawberry, raisins, a lemony sweetness but soft and dark as well, takes the stage leading to dark caramel, with hints of nuts and bread yeast and some small hops rounding out and bringing a firm but mellowing balance together. Nice texture thats a bit astringently soft yet complex in its lingering. Feel is full medium body, smooth and a bit creamy with that tingly effect late from the carbonation. This is one awesome brew, I could drink alot of these but the 9% hits ya if you drink it fast, but its so good why not, you gotta go sleep sometime. Excellent stuff.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Belgian Dark Strong Ale,94
22,30,jcalabre,4.13,"Originally sampled on 17 June 2002. Cloudy, dark brown color w/ a nice head, this beer is elegant. There are so many subtle fruity & spicey flavors that it was like tasting a fine wine. Don't miss this one. Take your time to savor it. great job unibroue",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Belgian Dark Strong Ale,94
22,30,irishmoss,4.85,"First off, wow. A beautiful brownish-ruby color with a nice tan head that dissipates somewhat, but a nice thin line remains. The taste was somewhat fruity to begin with (banana-nut bread), then finished spicy and crisp. Perhaps the taste was more like a spicy port wine. There was definitely something about the flavor that I can't even imagine to appropriately describe, and I loved it. The drinkability of this dark ale was surprisingly high. I'm certainly a huge fan and I'll be buying this one many, many more times.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Belgian Dark Strong Ale,94
22,30,pio,4.15,"i've got to, first, give a salute to the beer label. usually i wouldn't let a label effect my appearance score but this is the shit! it has hellfire, evil looking heavy metal print, a demon-pegasus, spires and a gothic looking set of metal wings on the bottleneck label. it's cool if you're into that kind of thing, and i say i am! that aside, pours a color of an apple slice left out in the air. a special color for sure, capped securely by a beige pocked head that's died down but not relenting, it stays at about a quarter inch. i approve!  aroma of alcohol and a malt or port wine. flavors of malt with rasins or fermented grapes (yeah, ok) there is a quite spicy nip that says nice things to the tip of the tongue. it finishes nicely: warm spice and carmel balance on ripe fruit. some hints of cinnamon, coco. mouthfeel is thick and crispy too, alot of bubbles help convey everything. burps high into the nose with spicy Co2. this is a very good beer as far as i am concerned. thanks for reading my review.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Belgian Dark Strong Ale,94
22,30,MJR,4.32,"Appearance: Pours a dark walnut color with plum highlights. The body is murky and cloudy, with no light getting in. What starts as a thick tan head fizzles down to a small cap.  Smell: The aroma is extremely rich and inviting with notes of dark fruit, nuts, bread, spicy hops, and alcohol.  Taste: Full-flavored with tons of dark fruit starting the rotation. Raisons, plum, and dates. Next up is a nutty flavor. After that, a breadiness from the yeast takes hold. Faint hint of a berry flavor... There's a fair dose of spiciness that calls to mind black pepper. Hops bring a smooth balance, rounding everything out. The finish is a bit vinous, with a port-like flavor. A touch of drying alcohol on the tail end.  Mouthfeel: Highly carbonated with a crisp, spritzy mouthfeel. The body is medium in thickness, which is then lightened by the carbonation. Ends dry and smooth. I think if they eased off the carbonation a bit, the flavors would open up a bit more, but I digress...  Drinkability: Scores well in it's drinkability. This is a delicious beer and it's hefty strength is the only thing that prevents me from drinking bottle after bottle of it. More please...",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Belgian Dark Strong Ale,94
22,30,nomad,4.32,"Poured a dark ruby that was brown toned. Had a soft tan-colored foamy head, and not much lace or stain. Not too enticing compared to many other strong dark brews.  Smelled of a dark almost chocolatey malt, plums, and, most wonderfully, a port-like alcohol-oak-fruit scent. The taste was malty, creamy, and with a slight woody and yeasty finish. Developed a warming fruity body with a small sour tinge - quite vinous.  Easy mouthfeel: none too creamy, oily, or watery. This beer doesnt come off as a heavy dark brew, as it was not heavy in scent, body, or taste. Thus it is very easy to drink, as the short finish helps and hurts it. Overall, I expected a little bit of punch or complexity of flavors.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Belgian Dark Strong Ale,94
22,30,Jarod,4.57,"Great label  dark gray Pegasus flying over a cathedral  This beer poured a cloudy mahogany that when held to the light the edges glowed with an orange hue, not overly cloudy though, I could see the carbonation bubbles escaping from the bottom of the glass. The head that was produced wad thick, rich, dense and lasting, and was tan in color. As far as lace, it started from the top of the glass and lasted until the last sip. The aromas that came from my glass (sniffing outside in the fresh air) were as follows  dark malts, caramel, dark fruits (black cherries), alcohol (slight), baked apples, spices (black and red peppercorns), grass and a hint of yeast. Very complex. The tastes that I experienced were of dark malts, cherry wood oak barrel that might have been used to age, alcohol (slight), citrus, dark fruits (dark cherries), melted brown sugar, baked apples, ground black pepper, and a deep port wine to finish. This beer was far more complex then I would have believed. It was thick, creamy and chewy all at once. Amazing how Unibroue hides all that alcohol behind all those complex flavors. This is a great beer that can be sipped for some time by itself or drank with almost any full flavored meal that is served with. Amazing!",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Belgian Dark Strong Ale,94
22,30,Garin,4.44,"Served cool but not cold (~10 C) in a tulip glass. I'll call this one a BJCP Belgian Strong Dark Ale, so that's where I'm coming from in this review.  This beer poured a deep, dark orange brown with clean bubbling -- perhaps a shade murkier than what I'd call ""fair clarity"". A creamy beige, fine-bubbled head formed easily and lingered. The aroma was sweet, malty, and alcoholic, with some hops, phenolic spiciness, and mayhbe orange underneath.  The flavour was intense and lush. Malty, rich, alcoholic, with many of the flavours mirroring the aromas. Also some soft overripe apple undertones (in a good way). The finish was clean and bitter, without any cloying sweetness.  The body was rich and full, and very luxurious. Overall an excellent beer! I'm starting to understand Unibroue's fame.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Belgian Dark Strong Ale,94
22,30,Shiloh,3.55,"Can you feel the alcohol?...I can. Whoa! Definetly a class act but beyond my scope of appreciation. Extremely dark pour and murky. Diffacult to judge the carbonation. The taste is most pleasant, sweet malty start with a sweet malty finish..with an added hoppy bonus. The head is limited but the thin island lace with glass ring lingers. The body is full and the nose is a sweet fruity combination. ABV limits the drinkability.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Belgian Dark Strong Ale,94
22,30,WaltTrombone,4.03,"I'm glad I waited to review this, as I just got a proper tulip-shaped goblet, and have been drinking this 'til now in a pint glass. Big difference in the aroma and head retention!  It pours a dark, tawny brown with a chunky dark tan head. My 9 year old thought I was having a cola. Not much aroma, just an undefined sweetness, and a dash of plum.  The taste was malt, with plums, brown sugar, charcoal, lemon, cocoa. Nothing too prominent, light carbonation and a creamy mouthfeel. More plum and charcoal as it warmed. The head lasted most of the way down, not much laciness. The finish was malt and dark chocolate, with just a wee bit of citrusy hops.  Too many of these, and you'll be speaking French from the 9%ABV, eh? It doesn't show, it sneaks up on you very smoothly, no alcohol bite at all.  Vive le Trois Pistoles! Merci, Unibroue! C'est une bonne biere!",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Belgian Dark Strong Ale,94
22,30,dwarbi,4.51,"Amazing color: a deep, dark purple. It has a thick, creamy head that's in no hurry to go anywhere. Smells fruity. There is not a tremendous amount of aroma there, but what you do get is pleasant. Tastes smoky. Feels foamy, but ends refreshing and not very sweet. Leaves hardly any aftertaste. Very mellow. Amazing drinkable.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Belgian Dark Strong Ale,94
22,30,clvand0,3.43,"This beer pours a really dark amber color with a medium dingy head that fades quickly. The aroma is very sweet and promising of a good taste. Upon first taste, this reminds me of a very sweet wheat beer. It has hints of fruit in the taste and the carbonation is very apparent when drinking, but overall it reminds me of a really smooth wheat beer. It is not excessively smooth to drink and it is pretty flavorfull. I could not see myself drinking more than one of these at a sitting because of the fullness of the flavor and the fact that I am not too fond of it. Nothing special about it in my opinion.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Belgian Dark Strong Ale,94
22,30,Naerhu,3.3,"Appearance  initial big foamy head that disappeared. Dark brown color. There was a Aroma  Brown sugar and malt aroma, kinda earthy and small amount chocolate. Taste  Brown sugar and surprisingly the alcohol is not perceptible. . Mouthfeel  nice rich creamy Mouthfeel. Drinkability  This went down very well. It was gone before I knew it.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Belgian Dark Strong Ale,94
22,30,dmarch,4.66,"Pours with a thick white head, but quickly dissipates into nothing. Cloudy dark copper in color. I was not impressed with the appearence. I'm glad I didn't judge a book by it's cover though. Wonderful spicy aroma. The label even has a little warning not to use a pisner glass. You'll want to use something that shows off this aroma. Very fruity and spicy with littly to no hoppiness. I'm thinking belgian dubbel, but the high alcohol content suggests something different. The alcohol content is very well hidden in the intense fruitiness of the malt.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Belgian Dark Strong Ale,94
22,30,AtrumAnimus,4.7,Pours a brown with amber hints and a long lived tan head that is lively and sinks down the sides faster than the middle.. The nose is spicy and malty with a tinge of alcohol. The flavor is rather good with sweet malt and spice as well with a distinct and noticeable alcohol finish as well. The hops are well blended but mild. Overall very decent - Drink at a cool but not cold temperature.,Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Belgian Dark Strong Ale,94
22,30,kbub6f,4.4,"Bought locally (Grapevine refrigerated shelves), a few weeks in my fridge, reviewed 45F-60F.  A big, coarse, noisy tan head dies fairly quickly. Lacing can be induced, but rolls quickly down the glass. The beer is a slightly cloudy, deep ruby.  The smell is sweet, with fruits and berries, slightly malty. The front shows sweet caramel and spice giving way to apples in the middle, with a notice of alcohol. The finish is crisp but dark. Again, I notice some alcohol at the cooler temps, but overall this is a great beer. It used to be my favorite U, maybe still.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Belgian Dark Strong Ale,94
22,30,IrishRedRock,4.19,"Seeing this for the first time, and with the way Unibroue beers have treated me, I had to try it. It poured a very nice dark color, that seemed more red than brown. As aggressively as I poured it, I still couldn't achieve a head atop. The aroma is quite pleasant. A touch of hops and alcohol, but mostly dark fruits and a lot of ripe cherries.  The flavor is just as smooth. It had a bit of yeasty spiciness to it, and a slight sweetness that followed a mild hop bitterness. Very fruity, delicious, and highly drinkable at 9%. Another great one from Unibroue.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Belgian Dark Strong Ale,94
22,30,BeerBuilder,4.15,"Mahogany in color with a tan head. The aroma is sweet almost like brown sugar. There is also a faint fig smith with a bit of fruitiness. The flavors that jump out are an herbal/medicinal flavor, sweet candi sugar, and alcohol. It is a medium-full bodied beer that finished semi-sweet, and alcoholic. A very tasty brew.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Belgian Dark Strong Ale,94
22,30,JohnnyDuvel,4.15,"My list of favorite beers is dominated by Unibroue. I recently did a head to head comparison between this and Chimay Blue. It was very close, and the differences are subtle. The Unibroue is perhaps a bit spicier, the Chimay slightly smoother. Trois pistoles pours the usual magnificent head, with good retention. Very dark, looks almost identical to the Chimay. Has a quenching, yet substantial taste. As is the case with the other Unibroue offerings, almost a wheat-beer like refreshing quality, but is complex and packs a quite a punch. No alcohol noted in the taste, but certainly in the effect. With all of the varieties, I could drink Unibroue almost every night (if not for the fear of overwhelming my liver, I probably would!). This can't compare to Rochefort or Westy, but for the price and availability, you can't really go wrong. Make sure to let this warm up. Cold, it tastes like a rum and coke!",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Belgian Dark Strong Ale,94
22,30,Bighuge,4.59,"Murky brown appearance. Decent sized light tan head fizzes away until all that remains is a thin film and nice looking collar. Aroma is sweet like candy and musty like the ocean breeze. A little grape as well. And some cherry syrup drizzled on top. The feel in the mouth is slightly airy and a bit carbonated. Not like a champange though. Body is roughly medium. Flavor profile is subtle yet complex. Sweet malts, biscuit and a bit of bitter hops are detected. There's a unique mustiness present that throws me into a big Deja Vu. Flavor's also a little medicinal and phenolic, a little yeasty and quite fruity. All in all, an agreeable Belgian style beverage.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Belgian Dark Strong Ale,94
22,30,hyuga,4.5,"A very dark brew with hints of a red hue here and there. Very nice head on top, off-white. It doesn't stay as well as I'd like it to, though. Nevertheless, this beer is quite beautiful when presented in its signature glass. The aroma doesn't fall short of this either. Sharp and spicy with dark fruits such as plums and currants. Very reminiscent of a great dubbel. A strong caramel sweetness is present in the background, holding everything up. On the palate, it's again in the range of a dubbel. Initially it's very smooth and caramelly sweet, then in the middle the huge spice and fruit characters really kick in. The fruitiness is currant and plum again, with some grape in there as well. A sharp hop twang backs all of it up, pairing perfectly with the spice and currant. In the back, the fruitiness gets kind of rind-like, like plum skin. Finishes with a smack of spice and hops and a bit more sweetness. Malty smoothness throughout. Just a touch of pepper here and there. Some leafy hop character in the aftertaste, along with some other things that are hard to pull out of the flavor when it's actually in your mouth, making for a very pleasant aftertaste. A wonderful dubbel overall. That's what I'd call it, it fits that description more than dark strong ale, in my opinion. Very much a warming brew. I think some aging would smooth this out in a good way. I wish I had a cellar or a nice cool closet that stayed that way year-round. Another strong offering from Unibroue, always one of the best when it comes to Belgian-style ales.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Belgian Dark Strong Ale,94
22,30,Delirium,4.9,"Pours dark crimson amber with immediate smell of sweet black currents and uncured olives in a frothy, foamy, carpeting head that dwindles down but never disappears leaving a sticky imaginative lace. Tastes of rich anise, black pepper, mushrooms, and earth. Deep finish is lightly bitter and exceptionally dry.  Smooth like a sharkskin, just don't rub it the wrong way.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Belgian Dark Strong Ale,94
22,30,Stubbie1,4.4,"Wow! I liked the la Fin Du Monde but this is much better! A dark brown color out of the bottle. Nice tight white head that hangs around forever and doesnt leave much of a lace. (Could be my glass) A fruity aroma hits your nose. I think it has a high carbonation content. Nice. A fruit flavor comes across your tongue. Not too sweet, hints of caramel and a slight finish of hops.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Belgian Dark Strong Ale,94
22,30,JISurfer,4.3,"Talk about a a good brew Ay! This is my first venture into Canadian brews, other than the regular macro stuff. I must say, that this is quite impressive. Just like the bottle suggests, it has a similar taste to a port wine. There is definately a taste of grapes in it too. Has a very dry finish, but it still coats the mouth well and leaves a little bit of an alcohol taste about it. I will definately get this one again.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Belgian Dark Strong Ale,94
22,30,CharlesRiver,4.5,"Dark, cloudy brown in color with a very nice head that lasts. I have been waiting to try this beer for a long time. The smell is fruity and sweet with a hint of malt. The taste is very complex. Very effervesent with flavors that change over and over. The beginning is more of the fruit and citrus. The middle and ending are more sweet, dry and warming. An amazing beer that I can't wait to have again. I have a bottle ageing nicely!",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Belgian Dark Strong Ale,94
22,30,GreenCard,3.94,"Original review 2-20-2003...  Aroma: slight maltiness with some wisps of alcohol, raisins and plums.  Appearance: a tawny, reddish-brown, creamy off-white head, some haze (not from chilling). The alcohol content killed the head pretty quickly, even in a clean Chimay glass.  Taste/mouthfeel: a lot of alcohol warmth, slight sweetness, a touch of raisins round out the flavor. The high carbonation gives it a nice flavor break, in lieu of hop bitterness or flavor (of which there is little). A fair amount of caramel aftertaste, but also a slight note of sharp bitterness unrelated to hops.  Overall: A well-crafted beer. Unibroue has not disappointed me yet. This is a great example of a dubbel/strong dark ale, though I generally like a little more presence of the dark, dried fruit characteristic. I have another bottle of this that I'm going to lay down for a couple of years.  UPDATE 7-21-2009: [Review of a bottle aged 4 years beyond its best-by date]  Appearance: ruddy dark brown, slight haze, very little head formation  Aroma: dark brown sugar, port-soaked raisins, prunes, alcohol, and wet dog  Flavor: malty sweet with hints of cork, licorice, multivitamin, chocolate, molasses, and stewed prunes; finishes semisweet with a musty/spicey aftertaste  Mouthfeel: medium-full body, zesty carbonation, alcohol warmth  Other comments: The bottle didn't make much of a pop when I uncorked it, so it must have lost some carbonation over the years. However, extended aging did not harm this one as much as it harmed the bottle of Maudite I cellared next to it. This one is still a drinkable, fairly interesting beer.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Belgian Dark Strong Ale,94
22,30,TheLongBeachBum,4.67,"Oh, Yearhhh - Babbiieeee, as Mike Myers would say, in his pathetic English Accent.  The cork did not want to give up its grip, and it took quite an effort to extract it, after the wire cage was removed. The color of this dark beer is gorgeous, a highly polished deep brown chestnut with some mahogany ruby-red hints when backlit. The large head that develops whilst being poured soon rescinds to a thin tan collar halo that grasps the glass sides. Very little lacing at all. Carbonation is still quite high though nevertheless.  Aromas are definitely of Belgium, and not Canada. Deep fruity, powerful, testicle grabbing smells that are not ashamed to reveal themselves. The beginning has a fantastic spritzy presence  the relatively high carbonation of the beer aids the wholesome character, as well as lending to the overall satisfying mouthfeel of this beer.  Tastes are just a non-stop Circus of complex acts. They commence with the Master of Ceremonies, MC Dark Fruity Flavours, his eloquent introduction brings on the Amazing Trapeze artistes the Malt-Teasers, followed by the famous Vanishing Alcohol tricks of the 9 family members of the Great Escapinis. After this, the blind-folded Knife Throwing antics of the Port Bananinis are quickly followed by the warming Fire-Eating Ethanolics. Hold on, where are the Clowns? Well there are none in this Circus  for this is very a serious beer, there is simply no place for face painted jokers here. A high class, highly complex beer, which will certainly benefit from aging for sure I believe. Tomorrow, I am going to get some more to lay down.  Yet again, Unibroue do not fail to impress me, they are the Samuel Smiths of Canada for me. Just where do they keep pulling these magnificent brews from???  In the past whenever, I thought of Canada, I thought of, well, erm yeah, alright, not very much at all. I now think of Unibroue when I hear the word Canada.  Trois Pistoles is the probably the closest attempt at a Canadian Trappist Beer that you will ever experience.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Belgian Dark Strong Ale,94
22,30,purplehops,4.23,"Three sprays pours a chustnut red-brown with a light tan head that has plenty of staying power and leaves ample lacing on the glass. The aroma is apples, plums, raisins, pears, and alcohol. There are also aromas of grass and cardamom. The taste starts flavors of caramel and biscuit malt followed by some carbonation tingle with hints of grains of paradise and citrus notes. The finish is a balance of sweet malts and dry floral and citrus hops along with some earthy/grassy hop flavors. The aftertaste is fading malt and spice flavors being replaced by warming alcohol and and date and fig like flavors.. The mouthfeel medium heavy with plenty of mild effervescence. Overall a very nice Belgian style dark ale. Plenty of malt, and alcohol along with a wonderful yeast. It looks good, It smells good. It feels good. It taste wonderful. And it will make you forget all your worries and cares.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Belgian Dark Strong Ale,94
22,30,feloniousmonk,4.87,"Dark violet color, with a short tan head that recedes too soon.  Rich, heady aromas come wafting out the bottleneck, plump with associations: Raisins, plums, spices, brandy, dark rum, smoke, and so much more.  Bracing onslaught of hops on the palate, but excellent buttress of malt backs it up. Fantastic spark on the tongue, and a wonderful sweetness that follows after the drizzling of hops. Transendant complexity, utterly other-worldly, and overjoyous.  A real treat of a beer, and a rare delight. Only the finest of human beings should put this to their lips, as a benedicton and reflection of the worthiness of their souls. So, all you slobs, go better yourselves before daring to crack the cage and cork. So go do community service, adopt a stray kitten, give a street urchin a quarter, let someone on the freeway before you, be kind to our fine feathered friends, turn a Bud man on to oatmeal stouts, just do something to realign your karma to make you worthy enough to pour this fine beer down your gullet.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Belgian Dark Strong Ale,94
22,30,Dogbrick,4.17,"Acquired via trade, although it took me so long to get around to drinking it that it became available in Ohio in the meantime. D'oh! Anyway, this beer pours a deep ruby color with a medium beige head. Aroma of cherry, vanilla, figs, and raisin. Fruity flavor of plum and raspberry, with a lightly chocolate malt finish. Very easy on the tongue, unlike a lot of Belgian Ales. Absolutely smooth and easy to drink. Very good.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Belgian Dark Strong Ale,94
22,30,WanderingFool,3.66,"The color of this beer is brown like a coke or pepsi and has a thin tan head that quickly dissolves leaving a sheet on the surface. The aroma is typical for a dark belgian style beer with banana esters, alcohol and a hint of spices (corriander?). Each sip begins with a sweet malty flavor, moves towards a tingley raisin-banana taste and finishes with alcohol. A sweet stickyness is left behind.  If you like dark belgian beers I would definetly recommend this one. It's full of flavors that leave you wanting more.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Belgian Dark Strong Ale,94
22,30,proc,4.45,"Absolutely delicious. Pours out to a plum color in the glass with a decent, brown sugar-looking head. The aroma is all over the place, with fruit, plums, yeast and although it sounds strange, a sweet tart candy smell. Taste is excellent, with a variety of spices lingering in the mouth. Mouthfeel is near perfect and the finish, while warming, masks the high ABV. Yum.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Belgian Dark Strong Ale,94
22,30,AudioGilz,4.28,"Pours with a fairly large head that dissipates pretty quickly.  Appearance: Very dark amber, cloudy, I couldn&#8217;t see through it.  Smell: Some alcohol aroma, strong fruit smell, bananas, although I couldn&#8217;t quite discern the rest of the fruits. Pretty pleasant smell overall.  Taste: I found the taste rather refreshing, while still being slightly harsh from the high ABV. I noticed a pleasant sweetness as well as sourness; enjoyable slight banana taste. The aftertaste was a little sour but didn&#8217;t last long at all.  Mouthfeel: Very sweet, medium body, enjoyable.  Drinkability: Without the label, you would have no idea that it&#8217;s 9%; very drinkable.  Notes: This is the second Belgian beer out of a 3 pack from Unibroue that I have tried. Maudite being the first, I enjoyed Trois Pistoles a lot more. It more smoothly tasted to me, and had a better aftertaste as well. These beers are my initiation into the world of Belgian Ales and I like this style of ale so far. I highly recommend this beer for anyone like me who is just getting into the style.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Belgian Dark Strong Ale,94
22,30,UncleJimbo,4.1,"Appearance: Cloudy brown with some tan foam.  Smell: Fruity - bananas - and sweet malt. Very pleasant.  Taste: Sweet, candy-sugar-like, fruity, yeasty, but with some hop character balanced in.  Mouthfeel: Sweet, creamy, low carbonation.  Drinkability: Dangerously good.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Belgian Dark Strong Ale,94
22,30,jdhilt,4.35,"Open carefully, this one likes to overflow maybe because it is refermented in the bottle, very good carbonation and head but not much lace. Cloudy reddish brown, nose is raisiny so is taste. Smooth, full bodied and malty - very easy to drink but savor at 9% ABV. $1.50 for a 330ml bottle from Capitol Convenience Concord, NH.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Belgian Dark Strong Ale,94
22,30,kelticblood,3.61,"Poured a giant head that reduced to basically nothing.I was a little dissapointed in the head retention after seeing the carbonation this Ale presented.The color was a dark blood red.Very strong with an immediate shot of alcohol.Goes down kind of crisp and somewhat harsh from the ABV.A verry bitter finish that doesnt stay in the mouth long.Strange it doesnt leave a dry palate,but almost refreshing.A medium to full body with a medicine like finish.Trace amounts of lace are noted.Very creamy but the high ABV detracts from the mouthfeel somewhat.If they could hide the ABV better it would help.A little watery for the color.Overall good to above average.  Note:",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Belgian Dark Strong Ale,94
22,30,mjohn27603,4.33,"Pours brown like a deep varnish. Smells of raisins. Taste is hard to describe but in a good way. Sweet tasting, figs, raisins, dark fruit. This bottle sat in the beer cellar for about 9 months. Best before 9-4-04. 12 fl. oz bottle. Fig newtons flavor. Don't notice overpowering alcohol presence. Worthy of contemplation and reflection.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Belgian Dark Strong Ale,94
22,30,Winter,4.2,"Poured a murky reddish brown with a foamy tan head. Aroma has a strong fruity boquet to it consisting of raisins, caramel, malt and chocolate. Mouthfeel was smooth and mildly crisp from the carbonation. Alcohol isn't overpowering, but does lend a nice warming effect as it goes down. Ale does have a port wine like quality to it as the label states. Being my first Unibroue beer I didn't know quite what to expect, but this was truly a delicious treat.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Belgian Dark Strong Ale,94
22,30,cretemixer,4.36,Chestnut brown in hue with a thick tan head that lasts for quite a few minutes. Toasty malts and pine on the nose. Nice clean roasted and caramel flavors. Pretty strong carbonation and medium body. There is a nice alcohol warmth that comes through the middle and a dry finish. Darn good brew!,Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Belgian Dark Strong Ale,94
22,30,Gusler,4.42,"The beer after disemboguing from the 750ml brown bottle takes up residence in my Unibroue Trois Pistoles glass a murky plum color with the head Bunyanesque and the texture spumous, the lace a sticky thick clinging sheet that completely obscures the glass. Aroma of malt, hints of ripe fruit I like to say plums, sweet and quite a clean and fresh nose. Malt dominates the start, sweet and the top middling in feel, finish is stingingly acidic, hops robust and plentiful, quite dry aftertaste also long lasting. The high ABV makes this a fine winter warmer and a good beer to sample on New Years Eve.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Belgian Dark Strong Ale,94
22,30,HopheadEd,4.28,"After the first sip, I told my wife this is my favorite from Unibroue. She quickly reminded me that I said that after La Fin Du Monde, Maudite, etc. Pours a dark brown with a big foamy head that lasts, and laces well. Slight aroma of fruits, maybe bigger, but I have a slight cold. Wonderful dark fruit taste and smooth mouthfeel. Silky going down. Clean finish with hints of pepper and spices to go with the fruits. Just a great Belgian Dark. Big alcohol prevents me from having more than 3 or 4 or.....",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Belgian Dark Strong Ale,94
22,30,doho95fu,4.78,"Deep brown reddish color with a thin tan head and an attempt at lacing that slides down the sides after each sip. I notice a bit of everything in the nose from vanilla, to fruit, and malt, and hops, raisins. The taste is much more simple yet great. It is sweet with a thin malt slap, followed by some alcohol kick - which is a good kick. Great finish, smooth and easy. This is a great beer, my favorite so far from Unibroue.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Belgian Dark Strong Ale,94
22,30,kunzbrew,4.2,"This beer pours a hazy ruby red colr with a big head that stays around for a little while. Roasted malt that has a caramel taste with earthy tastes also, very good indeed. This beer came in a three pack from cumberland farms. This almost has a Scaldis Noel taste but not as strong. The alcohol is not over powering, this is a great brew.  Cheers",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Belgian Dark Strong Ale,94
22,30,Wildman,4.58,"This beer poured a very dark reddish amber and formed a light tan bubbly head that left some circular lace. Some carbonation is present as well. An aroma of caramel and spices. A flavor of chocolate, a hint of caramel and spices. Some of the alcohol is present in the finish which was a touch astrigent. A very nice beer.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Belgian Dark Strong Ale,94
22,30,Mark,3.2,"I understand this brand is very highly thought of, and I understand that Belgian Ale is supposed to be on a higher plane in the beer world. I'm sorry but I don't agree. I consider myself to have a wide range of tastes and I'm very open minded of beer like all of you advocates out there. I even went out and bought a goblet that is appropriate for this style of beer. Dark brown color was nice and different, however I was very surprised by the lack of lacing. Taste was full of yeast, fruit and I think clove. Carbonation a bit more than I am used to. A good beer for sipping on a cold night and maybe I'll like Belgians more someday but for now I'll try the one I still have in the fridge (Piraat) and If that dosen't do it for me, see ya.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Belgian Dark Strong Ale,94
22,30,CreamAle128,3.07,"With me being a big fan on Unibroue, i really wanted to try this beer. I was happy to see when i was pouring a nice dark ale, or what i thought. I smelled some yeast, so i was really geared up to drink this. It took about 15 mins to pour the bottle with letting the head to settle down,but when i took my first sip, all i tasted was fruit, which made it somewhat hard for me to drink, since i am not that big on fruity beers. Very strong peppery flavour. I only sampled one of these 750ml corked bottles, right when i was starting to try belgian-style brews. I will try this again, and possibly re-do the entire review. But for the people who love fruit beers, grab this one right away.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Belgian Dark Strong Ale,94
22,30,maxpower,4.5,"750 ml corked bottle Dark orange brown color, big thick clingy head, sweet fruity, bready aroma, full bodied, alcohol hidden very well, smooth and velvety this is a great belgian strong ale, very drinkable.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Belgian Dark Strong Ale,94
22,30,marc77,4.18,"Formidably thick, creamy, and stiff beige head akin to chocolate dusted egg whites beat to a soft peak. Hazy garnet hue. Sweet lemony citrus and perfume like sweetness upfront in aroma w/ a hint of fragrant pine. Pleasantly mild green apple acetaldehyde is secondary. Hints of raisin and trace chocolate emerge as the beer breathes. Trace phenol in aroma. Date like fruity fructose sweetness is perceptible at first, then is supplemented by lightly raisiny, dark caramel sweetness. The initially sugary fruitiness widens into a ripe, prune nature that melds well with the understated chocolate character. Clean in terms of yeast byproucts, with only a trace of clove present in flavor. Light in body and correspondingly light, but certainly not weak, in mouthfeel. Hop bitterness is appropriately light, and only barely offsets malt sweetness. Finishes clean, w/ sweetness briefly lingering on the tip of the tongue. Although Trois Pistoles is not the most complex example of the style, its overall soft, pleasantly sweet character lend it unparalleled drinkability. Superbly masked alcohol content. Highly enjoyable. This was a 12 ounce bottle. ...Perhaps one of the finest beers with a twist off cap. I look forward to eventually trying a well cellared 750 ml bottle.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Belgian Dark Strong Ale,94
22,30,putnam,4.31,"On top of the dried-blood brown-colored liquid there is a cream-colored head that giggles and tosses about. It is pudgy, infantile and relaxed, like a baby after a long afternoon nap, sticking leisurly to the glass as I swirl it, only to regroup with self-contained energy. This is confidence. It settles into a warted sheet that remains active. The nose is of freshly torn Polish rye bread baked on a hearth. Fresh butter slathered over it...a sprinkle of cumin. Not fancy. The palate is memorable for its deceptively dry attack. The first thing I notice is the texture: peachfuzzy and steep. Then the sweet, fruity alcohol ramps up with equal amounts of cola bean bitterness. Again, not complex, but very well executed and cared for. The finish is rather plain. Simple and round. Easy to drink if less inspiring or compelling. Good with casseroled mushrooms, baked onions, tongue...",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Belgian Dark Strong Ale,94
22,30,francisweizen,4.3,"NOTES: I am still waiting to try this brew in a 750ml bottle.  A nice beer that pours a darkish murky brown with a thin tan head that does not fade away. This beer basically smells like a chimay blue. But don't be fooled... whilst this beer is a great example of a strong dark belgian ale, it is not as good as chimay or many other belgian brands. This tastes like a belgian dark ale should, though very rich and spicy het light, and fruity. This is a pretty well balanced beer. A very creamy mouthfeel and snappy finish pull this beer together, and lend to its good drinkability factor. Still this is a good brew to get down after you have a few lighter ones in you already as this is some heavy duty stuff. A very good beer from Unibroue.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Belgian Dark Strong Ale,94
22,30,HossMcGraw,4.11,"This is certainly a change of pace from the beer I'm used to drinking (Lots of HopDevil and Shakespeare Stout). I bought a four pack of Duvel one time and I hated it. I poured one of them out because I thought they were skunked. This beer tastes similar but way better. I'm not sure if these beers I've been getting are skunked, or is it's that I'm just not used to the flavor of Belgian beers. Do they all have a certain sourish medicinal quality to them? Help me out here someone. Anyway, this stuff is pretty carbonated and has the malty characteristics of a stout except this beer is not very heavy at all. It is quite drinkable and has a decent ABV that will sneak up on you. I've had better beers but it's still pretty good.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Belgian Dark Strong Ale,94
22,30,ElGuapo,4.55,"yeah. there it is. i have been waiting to try the Unibroue, and i am happy that i now have. the trois pours to a cloudy browy with a nice foamy head that leaves sticky lace all over the sides of the glass. you may fail to notice this as you are engulfed in the beer.  smells fruity, and has a slight fruity flavor in the backround. it is dominated by sweet malts. it goes down incredibly smooth and is a wonder to drink. this is a belgian ale, and everyone should have it.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Belgian Dark Strong Ale,94
22,30,Jordan,4.57,"No two tongues are alike, but here is my stab at the first belgian-style dark strong ale I have ever sampled. A perfect winter warmer. Exceptional aromas of musk and cherry port. 9.0% abv provides great stomach warmth. Opaque, heavily sedimented autumn brown hues. Complex palate, butterscoth, port, cocoa, liquered burnt cherry, subtle alchohals. No doubt an exceptional brew.  P.S. Oh yeah, dont be blasphemous and drink this ice cold, okay?",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Belgian Dark Strong Ale,94
22,30,Jon,4.35,"Trois Pistoles pours a deep ruby, amber color with a big, frothy tan head which retains well. Nice Brussels lace is present with some yeast particles floating about. Notes of yeast and spices are present in the nose. Taste varies from sweet to tart, acidic to spicy. Notes of fruit, yeast, spicy hops and alcohol present themselves nicely. Mouthfeel is appropriately carbonated, leaving an almost prickly sensation on the tongue. A choice sipping beer, this is a keeper.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Belgian Dark Strong Ale,94
22,30,ADR,4.48,"Dark brown murky color, head starts big and turns to a nice lacy skim after a hard pour. Dried fruit aromas. Nice flavors, spices, a little rum, red wine, and a big raisin effect. Sense of alcohol as well. Hops are impressive just to balance this fruit cake of a brew. Carbonation was very good, enough to pump up the volume but not enough to seltzer-ize. Lack of astringency gives me free reign to give this puppy the thumbs up. Big beer, here...  Some months later, EXTREMELY smooth, drinkability is raised to 5...",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Belgian Dark Strong Ale,94
22,30,jackndan,3.38,"Trois Pistoles: I regret to say that I had a taste for something else when I opened this bottle last night. It is truly a wonderful beer, very complex, and clearly meant for relaxed sipping in a relaxed setting. Unfortunately, I brought it to a party with about hundred kids half my age there, so I could not appreciate it like I should have.  That being said, it is a deep brown in color, thick and cloudy. I had it the recommended goblet, and got very little head. The aroma was muted, but there were scents of dried fruits and caramel. For a Belgian strong ale, I was surprised by how carbonated this beer was. The guy I split the bomber with said it was like port wine mixed with seltzer; I thought it was better than that, but it was fizzy.  The taste was very complex, with deep rich malt tastes like licorice, dried fruits, and anise. The alcohol was noticeable throughout, from the aroma, throughout the taste and the warmth thereafter. Not bad, but not worth the money I paid.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Belgian Dark Strong Ale,94
22,30,aaronh,3.96,"Deep chestnut brown with dark amber highlights topped by a creamy white head. This is an impressive looking beer, with an equally impressive bottle. The aroma is very complex, with yeast, fruits, and other scents. Reminds me of a ggod red wine. The taste is sweet, fruity and slightly overpowering. I did not find it to be as well balanced as some of the other Unibroue offerings. The mouthfeel is good, but the alcohol is a little too prevalent, creating too much astringency on the finish. Not many people could have more than a couple of these in an evening. Another nice beer from Unibroue that I must purchase again.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Belgian Dark Strong Ale,94
22,30,tigerpaws,4.38,"This is one great beer, the dark mahogany appearance is pleasing and the tan creamy head with a nice lace all the way through adds to it. IMO the aroma had a sweet hoppy scent to it. Good mouthfeel that makes you want to savor it and an excelelnt taste. ABV kikcs in a little but not overwhelming and I could drink this beer alone or with a nice med rare steak. Beautiful labe also as all the Unibroue beers have.....CHEERS",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Belgian Dark Strong Ale,94
22,30,DerKaiser,4.57,"Trois Pistoles has sort of an amber-mahogany hue beneath with a light, creamy head. It leaves an intricate lace all the way down the glass.  The smell is incredible alone, but the taste is overwhelming. Somewhat sweet, yet also deep and complex. Yeasty at the start, with hints of cherries and raisin. Peppery alcohol notes find their way up into the olfactory system fairly quickly. It reminds me a bit of certain port wines and also of kirschwasser liquor.  Really, this beer is just outstanding. Big, complex, balanced...one of the best in world, without a doubt.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Belgian Dark Strong Ale,94
22,30,bewareOFpenguin,4.5,"Like the horse on the label, this beer swirls around my head after two. A very down to earth taste, almost as if a monk was brewing it for you next door. This will be a cold weather beer for me, its rich hoppiness ans spices warming my cocals on a snowy night. My second favorite from Unibrou, drinking it almost makes you feel like a rebel.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Belgian Dark Strong Ale,94
22,30,beerluvr,3.58,"Pours with a large foamy head over amber/red liquid. Nose is very fruity, almost grape-like, and sweet smelling too. Taste is sweet as well, with a Port wine-like tanginess, heavy on the maltiness without being cloying. Very unique tasting with some hops detected in the finish. Warming alcohol noted as well. This seems to be a good candidate for cellaring, perhaps some time would dry things out a bit...I just couldn't get too excited about it now though.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Belgian Dark Strong Ale,94
22,30,Realale,4.47,"Dense head that quickly settles to a solid quarter inch or so. Deep mahogony color. Amazingly complex nose of malt, sour cherry, and blackberry. Simply mouthfilling, with wonderful fruity notes on top of the beautiful malty base. Great length. Outstanding beer. 9% alcohol not apparent at all. This bottle was cellared for about 2.5 years at 62 degrees.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Belgian Dark Strong Ale,94
22,30,Todd,4.55,"This bottle has been sitting in my beer fridge for about 3 years at 45-50F.  Murky, caramel brown with a decent inital foam head that rises to the top of the tulip glass -- yeast dregs spin darker colours into the head.  Medicinal, grassy, just a touch, with liquor soaked sweet cherries, hint of chocoloate.  Bone dry, soft mealy mouthfeel. Alcohol is high, but very hidden, very spooky, lending a nice spicy character to the flavour and blending with a chocolate malt flavour (brownie-like). Soft cherry flavours. Sweet caramel, bready flavour holds things up. Hops are grassy, but not overpowering. Alcohol comes back for a second haunt, this time warming the gullet and head. Mineral towards the finish with dry baked chocolate residuals, some spice and faded esters.  I have found my god. It's lives in all bottles of Trois Pistoles -- 3 year old bottles, but godly nonetheless.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Belgian Dark Strong Ale,94
22,30,the42ndtourist,4.87,"wow. this is really really good. a ton of head, but lots of flavour for it to hold. and excellent dark appearance, with a good dose of peppery spice over the fruity flavour. Yes, the alcohol's there, but it's the good type of strong. I really liked this beer. .... now to find some magnums of it.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Belgian Dark Strong Ale,94
22,30,Suds,3.96,Huge head with cavernous pockets and oversized bubbles. This is a very pretty beer. Typical yeasty Belgian smell. Taste is of dark berries with a peppery characteristic. Mild alcohol taste that's well meshed with the taste. This is a winner.,Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Belgian Dark Strong Ale,94
22,30,zerk,4.5,"Cloudy brown/amber with a persistant lace. Fruity and spicy aroma, with buscuity notes as well. Flavor is malty and sweet, with a hint of dried fruit. Very crisp and carbonated for a Dark Strong Ale. Definately a potent, sipping beer, with a nice warming effect. This is one I'll return to on many occasions. Another strong Unibroue offering.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Belgian Dark Strong Ale,94
22,30,mzwolinski,4.58,"Pours a dark ruby color with a thick, foamy head which dissipates fairly quickly but leaves a nice lace for the duration of what ought to be a slow, relaxed drink.  Yeasty aroma with a distinct fruit note which seems to sharpen as the beer sits.  Taste is really wonderful and surprising. For those of you who like a bit of a fruity taste in your beer but just can't stand the sickly sweetness of lambics, this may be the beer for you. The fruit is there, but it's balanced by a wonderful taste of caramel malt with a very noticeable (but again, not overpowering) chocolate taste. Alcohol flavor is present, but remarkably subtle for such a potent brew -- more of an aroma than a taste, really. Spicy phenols make for yet another surprise in the finish.  Medium-full body. Creamy tasting and warming.  Wow. There's really a lot going on in this beer. Very drinkable, very mellow. This one definitely goes on the monthly rotation.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Belgian Dark Strong Ale,94
22,30,WilliamPhilaPa,4.22,"Pours a amber / brown color with a thin tan lace. On the nose you can smell the aroma of caramel malt, toasted bread smell, and alcohol. On the palate the you more malt caramel, toasted bread, chocolate hints, dark fruits, slight graininess. Alcohol taste goes away as it warms and caramel malt steps upfront and complex flavors as well. Good stuff",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Belgian Dark Strong Ale,94
22,30,aracauna,4,"This may sound odd but the flavor reminded me a bit of watermelon. Maybe it was the esters combined with some of the other yeasty flavors but it was interesting. Smells like a good belgian should. Not as spicy as some, but the estery fruitiness is good. Having trouble with some of the spicier belgians, this is a good beer to me. It had less of the fuzzy mouthfeel that a lot of Belgians have. I think that's a good thing as some feel too fuzzy.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Belgian Dark Strong Ale,94
22,30,BeerAngel,4.26,"Now here we go! Finally, I've hit a Unibroue product that I rate beyond good. This brew pours a dark chocolate color with a light tan 3 finger head. Fairly hoppy brew but not over-hopped for the style and alcohol content. At 9% ABV, you know that you drank something. The taste is well balanced with a sweet finish and the mouthfeel is great. It is fairly thick without alot of stickiness. This one is done right! A votre sante again!",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Belgian Dark Strong Ale,94

I tried this beer twice and came up with the same rating!  Tried it a second time and got a complete different taste and aroma than the first time. Just a fantastic beer. Don't know what happened the first time, but, a complete change this time. I've gone for a 3 average to a 4.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Belgian Dark Strong Ale,94
22,30,Longstaff,3.85,"The bottle says that it has a port like finish and it does. This dark colored strong ale would be great for sipping in front of the fire on a cold winter night. Has a leathery taste with hints of dried prune fruitiness. You can feel the warmth of the alcohol but does not overpower the other flavors. Finishes somewhat dry in the mouth. Had this with some Chinese food and it cut the greasiness wonderfully. Not my favorite Unibroue beer and I would not seek it out on a regular basis, but this is a decent strong ale.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Belgian Dark Strong Ale,94
22,30,frank4sail,4.97,"Fruity/yeasty nose with a hint of sweetness. Dark cloudy black cherry color. Lots of little bubbles from bottle conditioning. Fruity original taste with a smooth spicey finish. Very well crafted, with a finish that leaves your tongue ready for more sparkle and a little alcohol warmth. The original feel is one of action and the finish is smooth and balanced. There ia alot going on here, but that is what is so impressive. There is a very fine light lace on the glass. Curl up with a bottle and enjoy the complexity. This vintage was listed best before: 5/8/04. Tasted in chimay goblet.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Belgian Dark Strong Ale,94
22,30,mophie,4.85,"This could very well be my favorite Unibroue (at least so far, anyway). Deep hazy garnet with an ultra-foamy tan head. Smells of apples and cloves, with a touch of pepper.

22,30,Andy,4.2,Big grape aroma (fresh red grapes). The aroma is unlike any other I have encountered in beer. Alcohol flavor is present and it offers a dry finish. Slight lactic acid sourness accompanies a very winey (Sangria?) flavor.,Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Belgian Dark Strong Ale,94
22,30,StevieW,4.43,"dark brown color, think foamy brown head. The head settled quickly but was still very good. Smelled alot of spices and fruit. noticable alcohol and very very smooth for the higher abv. Very sweet on the tongue and almost no bitterness. Not a beer to down several at a time, but very very good. The taste improved as it warmed in the glass. Cool looking bottle too. Exp. date is 9/4/04 Wow.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Belgian Dark Strong Ale,94
22,30,mickeymac,4.12,"Pours with a nice foamy head and is a nice garnet in the glass. A raisin/date smell and taste are fruity but not overwhelmingly so.

Warms you up nicely.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Belgian Dark Strong Ale,94
22,30,Reverand,4.5,"Another incredible beer from Unibroue. This beer has it all great color, aroma, taste and drinkabilty. The 9% a.b.v isn't noticable when it is cold but when it gets to room temperature look out.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Belgian Dark Strong Ale,94
22,30,Bierman9,4.03,"My second sample from the Unibroue line...so far, so good! Pours a rich, dark brown color, with some yeasty haziness. Produced a decent-sized, creamy head. Aroma was mildly fruity, reminiscent a bit of Ommegang. A good feel on the tongue, with a touch of lingering carbonation. Nice malty start, with dark-fruit flavors, ending with a spicy jab on the palate. For 9% abv, I don't pick up the alcohol much... Overall, a pretty good bier.  overall: 4.1 appearance: 4.5 | smell: 4 | taste: 4 | mouthfeel: 4 | drinkability: 4  81",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Belgian Dark Strong Ale,94
22,30,Jason,4.45,"Presentation: 12oz brown twist with a bottled on date on the back label.  Appearance: Tawny amber brown with a thin tan lace that does not subside.  Smell: Grassy with a barn yard / horse blanket and a mild tartness in the aroma.  Taste: Crisp carbonation with a chewy malt palate that has toasted and chocolate undertones. Very rich and spicy with hints of black pepper. Alcohol is quite evident allowing some sweetness to the taste buds and also lending a hand to the spicy flavours. The rest of the palate is on the dry side with an underlying grainy, herbal and earthy taste throughout.  Notes: Another spectacular brew from one of the best breweries from Canada. Big enough to pair up with the most robust meals or just to sip the cold winter months away. Packed with complex flavours and deviously drinkable at 9% abv.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Belgian Dark Strong Ale,94
22,30,cokes,4.37,"Another winner from our friends up north. Maltier than most of the other Unibroue creations. This makes the beer seem bigger than most of their other styles. Chewy and creamy. It pours a nice scarlet brown with a quickly diminishing, but not disappearing tan head. Fruity and spicy. Big time flavors every direction you turn. Alcohol is a major player here, especially in the finish. Wine like taste settles in late and passes out on your couch (i.e. sticks around for a long time). But not neccessarily the type of visitor you want to leave. (The bottle notes this as ""port"". Call me uncouth, but I don't know beans about wine, so I will just take their word). Quite an stellar brew in my book, and just a step below their some of their other offerings (Don, Fin and Maudite). Usually a ""second-tier"" beer in a brewery's repitoire is nothing to get overly excited about. But Unibroue is an exception to all rules. Everything they touch is gold.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Belgian Dark Strong Ale,94
22,30,LarryV,4.77,"I really enjoyed this beer, one of my favorites of the Unibroue line. Has an almost sherry like aftertaste with smooth body. I didn't find that the alchohol was very pronounced. Excellent.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Belgian Dark Strong Ale,94
22,30,AaronRed,4.5,What a smooth beer. I have not tasted a full bodied dark Belgian style ale that was this smooth. It had a creamy texture that made this a wonderful beer to sit and sip all night,Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Belgian Dark Strong Ale,94
22,30,ThreePistols,4,"Dark cloudy brown color. Beige head. A complex, spicy aroma with a hint of yeast, fruit and vanilla. Definitely a sipping beer. Dark fruit, vanilla, chocolate and caramel notes with a strong alcoholic finish. Lingering malty, fruity, alcoholic aftertaste. A tad too much alcohol and carbonation for the mix.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Belgian Dark Strong Ale,94
