252,731,DMFF,4.74,"Just picked this up at my Beverage Center. This was recommended to me by a friend who swore this would be better than my usual Hofbrau. Let's find out!  L: Pours a hazy golden-orange with a 2 finger, foamy white head. It dissipates into a thick white cap and leave behind beautiful lacing.  S: Strong smells of banana, clove and bubblegum up front. There are also traces of wheat bread & malt on the nose.  T: Follows the nose, but blends together with such a beautiful richness along with subtle noble hops to create an outstanding beer for the style.  F: Medium-full bodied with the perfect level of carbonation. Feels rich and creamy to drink, yet finishes fairly dry.  O: This beer just usurped the ""Best Hefeweizen"" from Hofbrau for me. It just expertly blends the flavors together for a more concise representation of the style while maintaining that level of richness I enjoy. The perfect Hefeweizen!",Bayerische Staatsbrauerei Weihenstephan,Germany,Hefeweizen,98
252,731,ramseye4,4.21,"This my personal granddaddy hefeweizen. This is a great example of the style. Pours a cloudy yellow orange color, with good head. Aroma is of clove and bananas, which carries over to the taste as well. Perfectly carbonated and full bodied.",Bayerische Staatsbrauerei Weihenstephan,Germany,Hefeweizen,98
252,731,Rfox2014,4.26,"A well balanced hefeweizen. Taste a bit orangey, little yeast bite. No emphasis on either the banana esters or clove phenols, although both fuse nicely to showcase",Bayerische Staatsbrauerei Weihenstephan,Germany,Hefeweizen,98

252,731,jkblr,4.4,"11.2oz bottle coded 2022 (nearly a year old) poured into a wheat beer glass at fridge temp 5.4% ABV. The beer pours hefe-hazy orange amber in color with nearly white head. The head recedes to a half inch cap and leaves lots of lacing. The aroma is mildly sweet banana malt. The taste is semisweet banana and wheat malt. Negligible bitterness. Mouthfeel is medium bodied with average carbonation and a semi dry finish. Overall, good wheat beer if that's your thing.",Bayerische Staatsbrauerei Weihenstephan,Germany,Hefeweizen,98
252,731,Broski1989,4.91,"It really a world class amazing beer. Your going to pay for it, and it’s not readily available at your local beer/liquor stores, but if you want a quality German brew here it is.  Taste: it’s in a class of its own. Very smooth. Smoother than drinking glacier water smooth!!  Feel: feels very nice, perfect sized bubbles; plenty of light on the mouthfeel lacing  Overall: I highly recommend this beer. You’ll have to hunt it down because again, most stores don’t supply this generally to the local clientele.",Bayerische Staatsbrauerei Weihenstephan,Germany,Hefeweizen,98

252,731,Ant777uk,2.04,"World's oldest brewery? Really? I'm sure I have had the world's oldest brewery beer before, and it wasn't this...  I used to love weissbier when I was about 20...but recently I haven't really liked it so much, anyway let's give this a go. I used to have an Erdinger glass at home.  Very typical bananaey aroma...heavy...sweet like a desert...not really inviting to me. Very smooth head and deep orange colour, looks great in the glass.  Taste is unique for sure. Very different to other weissbiers I have tried, such as Erdinger (my favourite beer around 20 years old). This is much lighter and ever so smooth. And not as sweet as the aroma makes you believe...but for me it's a bit too smooth, and a bit too unexciting...there is no complex mouth feel or bitter hop aftertaste of a Radeberger, West Coast IPA or Belgian tripel. Or the mystical smoothness of a Chimay Bleu. This is kind of simple, pleasant...and easy to like. I'm definitely not a fan of wheat beer, though I kind of understand why people would like this, though...in the same way people like ice cream. It's just not for me.",Bayerische Staatsbrauerei Weihenstephan,Germany,Hefeweizen,98

252,731,Blogjackets,4.46,"Beer poured from tap.  The body pours an orange gold with a nice fluffy head. Good retention and lacing. A handsome beer especially in the right glassware.  Nose is the banana-bubble gum aroma for which the style is famous. Hit-or-miss for some folks, but a big hit for me. Add the familiar clove and I was a happy guy.  Taste substantially follows nose with the clove stepping up a bit. A bit sweet but a modest hop flavor is present helping balance the beer.  Good carbonation and mouthfeel make it an easy drinker.",Bayerische Staatsbrauerei Weihenstephan,Germany,Hefeweizen,98
252,731,BitteNochEinWeissbier,4.29,"0.5 L bottle Bottle Date: 6301 Consumed on: 2022-july-26 Glass: 0.5L Weizen Vase Pouring Temp:   Look: Cloudy and opaque golden yellow. I can see the shadows of my fingers through the glass when I hold it up to a light. 3-finger pillowy and creamy off-white head slowly dissolves to a 1-finger consistent and creamy cover. When I opened the beer, it slowly started pushing up out of its bottle. Some yeast looks to have remained on the bottom of the bottle, indicating that this sample will not be as opaque as 'normal'.  Smell: All kinds of banana along with some sweet fruit that has been lightly sugared. Balancing this is a nice clove note. Wonderful nose.  Taste: Similar to the nose but with the addition of wheat notes that come across as very slightly bready or perhaps doughy. There is also a mineral note. Everything is very nicely balanced. The finish is lightly sweet and clovey.  Feel: Smooth, soft, and creamy. The body is not quite medium.  Overall: A great Hefeweizen from a top-notch brewery. Quaffable, balanced, and refreshing. This is the benchmark for the style and has been so for decades. One of my favorite Hefeweizens, along with those from Andechs, Ayinger, and Schneider.",Bayerische Staatsbrauerei Weihenstephan,Germany,Hefeweizen,98

Banana, caramel & mild clove notes in the nose.  Creamy, medium mouthfeel.  Banana & mild caramel flavors up front; mild clove notes on the finish.  An exemplary take on the style; I'd have another! And another!",Bayerische Staatsbrauerei Weihenstephan,Germany,Hefeweizen,98
252,731,JZH1000,3.88,"Had 16oz on tap at RiNo Beer Garden  On the pour a 1.5 finger fine head just over the glass that slowly receded and became rocky and creamy looking. Color is a dark gold with standard hefe haze. Carbonation is light enough that it's hard to see through the haze. Some lacing forms if you drink it fast enough but not the best lacing ever.  Aroma is full of banana esters and a bit of acetaldehyde but not anymore than is expected of the style. Aroma is relatively light and not a lot of the malts come through this is all yeast on the nose.  Flavor is similar to the aroma with a certain lightness to it followed by a nice hit of traditional hefe flavors, once again a little tarter than I'd prefer, but nothing overwhelming or out of character for the style. There is a definite minerality to the flavorfollowed by some light bitterness and grassiness from a light dose of noble hops. Followed up by all that a sweet wheat maltiness does creep in making for a nice finish with a bit of sweetness after yeasty slightly bitter flavors.  The feel is once again a bit light and astringent, but the head retention on this makes for a relatively balanced light feeling making it not watery. The finish is relatively long for how light it is and in the chest you can feel the alcohol warming sensation a little bit.  Overall this is a good example of a traditional hefeweisen and a bit drier than the hofbrau hefe but without the citrus notes of an americanized hefe or traditional American wheat.",Bayerische Staatsbrauerei Weihenstephan,Germany,Hefeweizen,98

Directly from the bottle, it’s 100% banana. FEEL: very smooth and refreshing with medium body and medium-light carbonation. OVERALL: This is, to me, a perfect beer. It’s insane. It’s refreshing with just enough body to it to be rewarding without feeling bloated afterwards. The tastes are lovely and perfectly balanced, and there’s a variation in flavors between the glass and the bottle that are both wonderful in their own way. The best part about it is that it’s not even expensive, either. It’s like $11 for a 6pk at my local liquor store. That’s only $2 more than a 6pk of Heineken for THIS.",Bayerische Staatsbrauerei Weihenstephan,Germany,Hefeweizen,98
252,731,Whyteboar,4.59,"Poured golden amber, not transparent but not cloudy either. Unfiltered? The head was nearly white and fleeting but that may be due to the age of the beer. The aroma was mostly cloves and, oddly, banana. At least the impression of banana. The taste, wow. Cloves are prominent but not overwhelming, banana is more an essence than flavor, and the malts are balanced, tasty and rewarding. So good, I think I need more of this one for the summer. The feel was smooth as the carbonation was slow and sparse, but present. Didn’t detract from the experience at all. Not sure why I waited so long to try this, it’s really good!",Bayerische Staatsbrauerei Weihenstephan,Germany,Hefeweizen,98
252,731,nizzle8287,5,"Wow. Poured at ~43 degrees F into a pint glass. Cloudy golden nectar with very fine bubbles in the finger of head that reduces to a film and a ring around the glass. If there was a banana Wheaties, this could be the mascot. Smell is, of course, banana, clove, nutmeg, as is taste, but more importantly, this beer does not include any of the previously stated foods as actual ingredients. This beer is brewed under the Purity Law of 1516, meaning it uses only malt, hops, water, and yeast. This philosophy of brewing has led to a masterpiece that lingers on the palette like you've just had a bowl of Cream of Wheat. Mouth feel is velvety creaminess; CO2 level perfectly present and fulfilling. Alcohol is hardly noticeable. Very smooth going down with a a slightly less than medium mouthfeel.

252,731,AlexandraDen,4.17,"Poured from a 500mL glass bottle to my Weihenstephaner hefe glass, just about a finger and a half of dense foamy, uneven head appears. Cloudy orange with a tinge of yellow.  Strong bubblegum aroma hits me first, followed by banana. Gentle spices, of which clove is the most noticeable. Wheaty and gentle yeast ester smell, maybe the palest or grassy funk.  Of all the hefe’s, I have always found Weihenstephaner to be strongest on the bubblegum and banana, which it does not disappoint on the palate here. Of the sweet malt it is crackery like wheat dominated, rather than the doughy malt of Belgians. Great cereal grain taste on the finish. Cloves and mild white peppery like spices wane in and out. A bit of mint was apparent as well.  Light-medium bodied, medium carbonation of the effervescent kind, tight small bubbles create a mild prickliness on the top of your tongue and a semi foamy sip. A gentle finish, not dry nor wet, which leaves an essence of banana bread and grains on the tongue.  Two things here: firstly, I don’t think my bottle was the freshest. I am going to revisit this review down the line and do a side by side comparison. Secondly, Weihenstephaner is and always will be the first beer that got me into drinking good beer, foreign beer, and craft. Once I had it, I never looked back. It was not my gold standard for Hefeweizens, but beer in general. As stated, I have my own Weihenstephaner glass I drink all my wheat beers out of.  That said… I think in the years that have passed, I can’t really rank it as a 98 like it is on BA. It’s legendary with a strong backing, but in modern times I’ve had too many wheat beers that were so complex and just as good, I think the beer coasts just a little off of its legendary reputation. Keeping in mind, I do believe the beer is the standard bearer/gold standard of the style. It’s the absolute most classic, straight up example of the excellency of wheat beers. For most of its existence it might as well have been Zeus compared to all other beers. In modern times, however, many others have climbed Mt Olympus and taken their place beside it. I say all this despite unending nostalgia for the beer and being it’s biggest lover for well over a decade and a half. This is still a phenomenal beer, best of the old guard. I look forward to revisiting the review with the freshest bottle I can find!",Bayerische Staatsbrauerei Weihenstephan,Germany,Hefeweizen,98
252,731,BFCarr,4.18,"Classic wheat beer - smooth, clean, banana and clove. Easy to drink, served in a 1 liter mug, Pours medium amber with a thick white head. Aroma is fruity and biscuit.

252,731,TheBricenator,4.69,"Look: Rich cloudy orange with a humungous and silky-looking off-white head that balloons and settles around the edge, leaving a dome that refuses to settle, though eventually does, and leaves great lacing behind Aroma: Clove, freshly baked wheat bread, yeast, banana esters, and wafts of bubblegum Taste: Huge wheat malt and wheat bread jump out and start to quickly develop depth as some clove and banana notes trail just behind. Yeast and bubblegum appear frequently throughout but don’t detract from the wheat/banana/clove but supplement them well and closes with wheat bread Mouthfeel: Full, silky smooth, soft throughout, medium-high carbonation, and a smooth and soft finish Overall: This is so damn good and hands down the G.O.A.T. of Hefe Weissbiers in my opinion – the standard amongst which all others are compared to. Not only are the flavors and aromas all on point, but they come together to create a sum greater than its parts and literally flawless in execution. I wouldn’t expect anything different from these folks given their experience and longevity and glad to have easy access to it.

This is amazing. The taste is something very new but classic tasting. There is a smaller tastes of semi-sweet fruits and spices like nutmeg and clove and maybe even cinnamon but without any heat. There are some medium-small notes that may be pastries without any major sweetness. Big notes of bread, wheat, maybe even rye, and pumpernickel. There is pretty much no bitterness from Hops, but all the spice from it. Maybe there is even a little bit of orange zest. The aftertaste leaves a nice taste that could be matched with any food. There is nice amount of carbonation (low medium). There is a creaminess (think velvety) and citrus feel there too. Wow. There is so many complexities in this beer but it’s not too much.

252,731,Joshhardigan,5,"Been revisiting old favorites to see how memory and current reality coincide...  Tried the 16 oz can for the first time, poured into some tall vintage Crystal pilsner glasses that belonged to my grandfather, still have a set of four of them left, they ping when you tap them, really old school fancy beer glasses... The beer is yeasty, cloudy old brassy gold in the glass, rises up a three finger head of off-white foam that lasts a few minutes with some moderate lacing.  Excellent semi-sweet malt notes on the nose, fresh baked bread, along with the juice from a jar of Olives minus the brine, probably not the most appealing description, but that's what I always get with a wheat beer, must be my palate...  More semi-sweet malt and a nice medium mouth feel, not too heavy, absolutely no hop bitterness, and never tips over into a bubblegum sweetness that some wheat beers seem to have... I get a little bit of that olive juice flavor, which frankly as a Martini person is not unappealing, it's such an exact flavor to me that there's no other description... Don't let that description put you off though, it may recall something else to you... Absolutely perfect taste profile, something that I consider the ideal example of a wheat beer, the peak exemplar of the type. I only give five star ratings to a handful of beers and this one gets that five, Weihenstephener is as good as it was the first time I had it, so long ago. Plenty of other wheat beers over the years including some very strong American ones but this is still the absolute Pinnacle of the variety.  Lingers just long enough on the palate, with just the right amount of alcohol and just the right amount of weight to the mouth feel. Very fine carbonation, pinpoint bubbles, and not at all ""gassy"", very natural feel.  Left quite a bit of lacing in the empty Glass.  The 16 oz cans seem to be the way to go in terms of value too. Bayerische Staatsbrauerei Weihenstephan is one of those breweries, like Samuel Smith out of the UK, whose whole range is consistently at the top of the available beer varietals...their Korbinian is a top doppelbock, neck and neck with Ayinger Celebrator, and I see they have a new Helles which I'm betting is going to be pretty good when I can get my hands on some.  To recap, probably the peak expression of a good German wheat beer, gets the top rating from me... and I still have three more cans there in the fridge! Does not overdo any one aspect of the style, is not excessively sweet, just a solid balanced Brew.",Bayerische Staatsbrauerei Weihenstephan,Germany,Hefeweizen,98

This beer pairs well with so many obscure foods, even sushi, cheese, salmon, pretzels, brats, and even pizza. This beer, or i should said Brot Bier tastes like a fruity banana bread you would make in September or a weird time of the year in Winter. I loved the spice notes and the flavor was bomb diggity. They also have other flavors of beers too, but this one takes the cake.",Bayerische Staatsbrauerei Weihenstephan,Germany,Hefeweizen,98

The banana/clove/yeasty flavors seemed more subdued than I remembered - I’m happy about that because most Hefeweizens tend to really overwhelm my palate in general. This was a perfect balance.,Bayerische Staatsbrauerei Weihenstephan,Germany,Hefeweizen,98
252,731,LanceBiggums,4.66,"The gold standard of Hefeweizen/Weissbiers. Every characteristic that people associate with weissbier is here. The golden cloudy colour, the thick bone white head (tremendous lacing on this pour by the way, wish I could show a photo here), the banana esters, the bready yeasts and malts. This is the first weissbier that made other people's talk of bubblegum and clove tastes really resonate with me because this one really has them. Overall an excellent beer. The only question that remains is who did it better, Weihenstephaner Hefe Weissbier, or Schneider Weisse Original?

252,731,SMDEE,4.33,"Appearance - Cloudy, golden, with a tall, full, thick, white head. Looks beautiful in a weizen glass. Smell - Cloves and banana detected first followed by a mildly sweet biscuit aroma. Taste - Cloves and banana are prominent but in proper proportions. A touch of wheat-ish sweetness with a small bitterness to balance the taste well. Cinnamon is barely detectable but in there. Finishes clean and easy. Mouthfeel - Not as heavy as the thick head would indicate but appropriately smooth and full. Leaves a light, even coat. Overall - I am not a fan of the style but this is certainly one of the best examples. Unlike many other hefeweizens, this one doesn’t possess overpowering yeast smell and flavor or excessive sweetness that turns me off of so many others. I can certainly see why it is so highly regarded.",Bayerische Staatsbrauerei Weihenstephan,Germany,Hefeweizen,98
252,731,JacintoCupboard,5,"I can't think of a single reason to take even a fraction of a point from this beer's ranking. This beer IS the holotype for a cloudy wheat beer with extensive fruit and grain flavours. You might have a preference for other wheat beers. You might not like wheat beers. But this is the one against which all others should be measured.  It is a cloudy blond in appearance. Pours a tight white head that is dense and holds. Leaves ample lacing. It has very strong fruit aromas, particularly banana esters, but with balancing spice. Mouthfeel is thick and creamy and the spice lingers on the palate.",Bayerische Staatsbrauerei Weihenstephan,Germany,Hefeweizen,98

252,731,teromous,3.34,"From the back label ""2061 09:31:25""  Appearance: The body is nearly opaque with a gummi-like transparency that allows deep and fuzzy shadows through but no defining images. There isn't much of a head. It has a short creamy-textured film with sparse bubbles but nothing serious. It is noticeably uninspiring visually-wise; the lack of a substantial head, even when forced from the bottle pour, is disappointing.  Aroma: It smells of clove and old cardboard with a note of burnt pizza crust.  Taste: Under-ripe banana comes through at first and it's really bright tasting. The middle of the palate is a mellow banana flavor and a faint cream of wheat flavor. It's pleasant but very mellow. It invokes memories of sliced bananas over shredded wheat cereal. It has a very nice, clean, precisely flavored finish which consists of green bananas and wheat cereal.  Mouthfeel: It is well carbonated and light bodied. It is easy to drink. No real bitterness.  Overall: An uncomplicated beer with a nice banana flavor with a note of cereal wheat. As an import beer this is alright and it's worth drinking from time to time. It has some very intriguing and unique banana flavors, however it lacks complexity. I could drink it again but I would likely hesitate at a bottle over a keg pour. I would love to try it fresher than an import bottle.",Bayerische Staatsbrauerei Weihenstephan,Germany,Hefeweizen,98

Taken together, the beer, food, the sun, and the crisp Spring air just seemed right. We finished with apfelkuchen and another 500 mL of the beer.

There's charming simplicity to the aroma of overripe banana, mildly spicy pepper, light bubblegum, and doughy malt with a hint of honey sweetness  The front end of this starts with some tingly clove spice with a soft wheat backbone to support it. On the swallow, the banana comes to life, with more soft wheat and a lightly crisp malt rounding it out  The feel here is very nice, a medium body combined with mild carbonation leads to a very refreshing beer, perfect for this unseasonably warm day here.

The flavor follows suit very nicely indeed with the aforementioned wheat, bready malts, hints of bubble gum, banana, and clove all excellently present and very well balanced. Just magnificent! Very little hop presence, just a very slight herbal, grassy hop note that is quite subtle. Has a crisp also smooth, light to medium bodied mouthfeel with moderate carbonation. Has a clean finish.

Mouthfeel is light to medium bodied with light to medium carbonation.  This is no surprise that this is the pinnacle of this style. It excels in being light enough to be enjoyable casually, but layered enough to be analyzed and savored.

252,731,JudgeRoughneck,4.47,"APP - Poured without rousing yeast just hours after being transported by bicycle. Only the slightest haze gives a luminious glow to this bright canary colored beer. Low bright white head with great retention, but poor lace.  AROMA - Soft citrus, very low banana, no perceptible clove, bit of vanilla, low Sulphur, note of fresh green grapes, low grassy/grainy note, fresh wheat flavor dominates  FLAVOR - light Citrusy acidity balances low malty sweetness, very very low banana is almost lower than subtle vanilla notes with just the slightest wisp of clove in dry wheaty finish. Naturally no hop flavors or bitterness stand out.  MF -Medium-low body with high carbonation, stingy acidity, and light grainy astringency.  OVERALL - Subtle, complex, and super refreshing.  With ROUSED YEAST - slightly more banana, fuller mouthfeel, but really dulls other flavors. Prefer it without.",Bayerische Staatsbrauerei Weihenstephan,Germany,Hefeweizen,98
252,731,Darkmagus82,4.13,"Poured from a bottle into a pint glass Appearance – The beer pours a clear yellow amber color with a big two finger head of puffy white foam. The head has an amazing level of retention, very slowly fading over time to leave a decent sum of foamy lace on the sides of the glass. Smell – The aroma of the brew is very strong of a wheaty smell mixed with other big aromas of a light banana smell and a decent showing of come clove and coriander. Along with these smells comes a bit of a grassy smell as well as a touch of a musty and hay smell. Taste – The taste begins with a wheat bread taste mixed with some sweeter tastes of a ripe banana nature as well as a bit of caramel. There is very light yeasty taste throughout as well that is nicely complimented with a decent hit of clove. As the tastes advances from the initial some orange and a little bit of hay work their way onto the tongue. At the very end the hay and banana increase in intensity and a joined a bit of graininess to leave one with a sweeter and sorta fruity, nice wheaty taste to linger on the tongue. Mouthfeel – The body of the brew is medium in thickness and creaminess with a carbonation level that is rather average. For the blend of flavors the feel is quite nice and makes for a very easy sipping brew that accentuates the wheat, banana, and spice quite well. Overall – A well crafted hefe. It has a nice blend of wheat, sweet, spice, and hay. An enjoyable drinker.",Bayerische Staatsbrauerei Weihenstephan,Germany,Hefeweizen,98
252,731,Hooded,4.96,"Notes from 2/1/2020. Poured from a 11oz bottle into a Spiegelau Classics Wheat Beer Glass. The body is golden and cloudy with 4 fingers of white head quickly receding down to 1 finger of foam, and eventually leaving a white cap. There's a small amount of moderately thick lacing. 4.75 The aroma is medium in strength, and of over ripe bananas, cloves, and bubblegum. 5.00 The taste is medium in strength, and of over ripe bananas, cloves, malt, and something at the end pallet I cannot identify. There is an earthy quality to the flavor. 5.00 The mouth feel is above medium in thickness, creamy, and with light carbonation. 4.75 Overall, the over ripe bananas and earthiness of the flavor is superb. The taste is hard to beat. 5.00 I reviewed this beer and Hefeweisen by Live Oak side by side. In comparison with Hefeweissbier by Bayerische Staatsbrauerei Weihenstephan, HefeWeisen by Live Oak has a slightly better appearance due to having a massive pillowy white head and a slightly better mouth feel because of a thicker and creamier texture. In comparison with HefeWeisen by Live Oak, Hefeweissbier by Bayerische Staatsbrauerei Weihenstephan has a slightly superior taste due to the over ripe bananas and overall earthy flavor.",Bayerische Staatsbrauerei Weihenstephan,Germany,Hefeweizen,98

First of all this beer it has a high rate carbonation and that make it little rough in your mouth but also more heavy.. That helps you to drink it slowly because some others ""Hefe- weissbier"" is more sweet and you drink them like your orange juicy in the morning.. Also is very spicy and remind me a lot the ""Paulaner- Hefe"".. Is little more lighter and balance this one from ""Paulaner"" but is very spicy and it stick very well with your food.. The colour and the aroma is the ordinary from one ""Hefe-weissbier"".. Orange with a lot of spicy and banana aroma.. Overall a decent and classic beer to drink with your food or to go out to listen some music in some place or some live show.. Is a beer that you can drink it with your friends outside and not you can drink it alone in your house i guess..

Pours a fully cloudy honey golden, with three fingers of completely dense, fiamy white head, which holds its shape for several minutes.  Nose: Sweet, soft, creamy wheat grain, with an incredible classic yeast aroma - bringing an explosion of bubblegum, a hint of clove, unripe banana, and some fruity undertones atop a warm loaf of fresh bread. There's the faintest suggestion of orange rind and some mulling spice tucked in as well.  Palate: First sip brings that creamy grainy wheat flavour, with surprisingly little sweetness. The fruity yeast esters follow, with more bubblegum, faint clove, green banana, apple, faint clove, and some German hop florals. It's very clean, crisp, and tame. There's a subtle spicy kick before the finish, which brings more bubblegum, wheat grain, German hop notes, lots of clove, and a very toned -down bitterness compared to American hefewiezens.  Mouthfeel/Body: The beer is fairly light in body - crisp - with a noticeable softness to the feel. The soft wheat coats yhe tongue, and gives some nice texture. Effervescence is lively, but not aggressive or prickly. Everything feels appropriate for the style.  Overall: Hefeweizens are not a favourite style of mine. Nevertheless, I try to look at everything as objectively as I can. This is probably the most enjoyable hefeweizen I've had this far. It feela incredibly refined and complete, with no rough edges or off flavours. Unlike many American offerings, it isn't over-hopped or spiced in any way. It isn't a complex beer whatsoever. It isn't wildly unique or groundbreaking. It's a very classic style, after all. It is, on the other hand, a really great example of beer in its most simple, classic, original form. A true German offering. It may not br a glass to dive in and study, but it sure hits the spot when you want a cold beer, and this will certainly pair very nicely with many dishes.",Bayerische Staatsbrauerei Weihenstephan,Germany,Hefeweizen,98

252,731,pubscout,4.6,"It being in the low 90's at the PONDerosa, today and just back from a stint at the pool, The PubScout decided to take a break from his usual IPA summer slakers and go back in time--like 1200+ years. Weihanstephaner Staatsbrauerei had hops growing near its monastery in 768 AD. And seeing a lonely bottle of this classic wheat beer in the back of my fridge, I decided to try to resurrect the reactions I had when first I tasted this incredible beer decades--not centuries--ago, no matter what Paul Z. says. I was first impressed back then by the banana-clove-bubblegum notes so very evident in the nose and on the palate. A crisp spiciness could also be detected with a bit of concentration, as well. Great news! This is still the same wonderful wheat (at least 50%) beer that rocked my beer world back when hazy, juicy IPA's were not even on the radar. And, with the temps soaring today, it was the perfect beer--smooth, medium mouthfeel, no bitter hop dominance and just a most refreshing, extraordinarily drinkable beer. Its low ABV (5.4%) makes it most sessionable, and I'd imagine it would pair well with anything except game meats and chocolate desserts. If those Juicy Haze-bombs ever run their course (and they likely will), millennials and everyone else might benefit by going ""Back to the Future,"" and discovering what a classic, refreshing summer beer is supposed to taste like.

Spicy notes in general. Taste follows suit with a nice fuller than average body and a bit yeasty aftertaste. Yeasty in the sense of slight sharp bitterness that lingers on the tongue. Soft carbonation for the style, or rather, probably the thickness plays down the carbonation. In sum, the benchmark for hefeweizen. Pure, balanced, very very drinkable.

Head dissipates reasonably quickly to lacing. S. That fruity, sweet slightly pungent smell that I find slightly unpleasant. Other touches of perhaps a little spice. T. Similar to smell, the high carbonation adds a slightly astringent feel that dries out the sweetness on the finish. F. Almost bubbly, but quite smooth and drinkable with it. O.

Everything is balanced, not too sweet either. On the light side but it is a wheat beer so that is to be expected, very easy drinking.  If you are new to these styles of beer, remember to swish the bottle around when you get towards the end of the pour so that the yeast is able to come out. Kicks up the flavor a notch.

Aroma: The nose is largely a huge ripe banana aroma but the typical yeast and some subtle spices are also present. Taste: The taste follows the nose quite closely with a lot of banana, yeast, perhaps a little orange, and tinges of spice before coming back around to banana for the finish. This one feels light for a wheat based beer, with a very creamy mouthfeel that is reminiscent of a NE IPA. As expected, there is some sweetness here but there is just enough hop character to keep it in check. This is a very well rounded and accurate example of what a traditional hefe-weisse beer should be. Biased comments: This one has held up well for its age, although I must say that after so many thick, chewy, and high ABV craft beers, this one does almost feel watery. However, the fantastic mix of bananas and yeast help to give it a good boost in my opinion. But, the wateriness, the carb, and caloric content for what you are getting, a relatively low ABV beer, is really the only thing that prevents this one from being on permeant rotation in my fridge.",Bayerische Staatsbrauerei Weihenstephan,Germany,Hefeweizen,98

Pours a cloudy deep golden straw in the glass with almost four fingers of dense creamy head. One of the best heads on a beer I've ever had. Nose starts off with spicy clove that transitions into a bread pudding consisting of fresh bananas, wheat bread and vanilla. I also get some white grapes, cinnamon and cardamom at the end. Taste follows the nose closely; it's crazy how close this is to a well made banana bread pudding. Big clove, cooked banana, wheat bread, cinnamon and vanilla stand out on first taste. The rest of notes of the nose follow closely afterwards with an addition of yeastiness that I didn't catch initially. Creamy medium body with consistent small bubbled carbonation. Medium-high sweetness, so if you're not looking a big desert-like punch of flavor, this isn't for you.

Pillowy, long-lasting bright off-white head of creamy fluff. Clearly a filtered Hefe. Banana and yeast aromas, both strong, and enough in balance to where determining where one begins and the other ends is pointless. Even more banana-forward, not quit bubblegum to taste.

I'm grateful that I can always find a 6 pack of this classic wheat beer in my local beer stores everytime I go beer shopping. I recommend that if you want to session this beer do not eat a very heavy meal before doing so because hefeweizens are thick & filling much like a stout is. Cheers!

A: pours a turbid yellow-orange (made sure to swirl the yeast) with 1-1.5 fingers of fluffy, bubbly, white head and loads of carbonation blasting away.  S: more banana and clove than the American hefeweizens I've had. This borders on Belgian wit territory, but without the bubblegummy phenolic edge.  T: bready and slightly sour-tangy arrival. Moderate sourdough breadiness on mid palate, closing out to a light bitterness and underripe banana note. Slight wheaty sourdough taste lingers.  M: light and creamy, loads of effervescence.  O: I know this is a 6 month old bottle, but that's par for the course around here. I'd love to try this on draft next time to see how much better it is. As it stands, I agree with the chorus of people who say this is the best hefeweizen around. But as a style I am underwhelmed as compared to witbiers and American wheat ales. This is an understated and quaffable style, and except for rapid distribution, Weihenstephaner has executed it pretty well, as far as I am concerned. Think it would be better fresh.

T: Sweet banana like Runts banana candy, complimented by orange zest and more subtle orchard fruits such as red and green apple and pear. The malt backbone correlated with the mouthfeel, being more of a pillowy, doughy sensation than an actual taste, with a dab of that aforementioned honey and vanilla. Upon further drinking, I even notice notes of honeydew melon and green grape.

252,731,Sabtos,4.25,"Super opaque milky yellow with a thick, creamy white head that clings on the way down in ridges, but does not leave lace.  Smell is cracked wheat and white bread with banana, pear and very light spice.  A semi-sweet tang brings wheat with pear and lemon accents. Very light on phenolic spiciness, this is very drinkable with a semi-dry, smooth soft feel via a medium-light body. I get a touch of licorice in the very distant aftertaste.",Bayerische Staatsbrauerei Weihenstephan,Germany,Hefeweizen,98
252,731,Mindcrime1000,3.83,"Pours with a large but very quickly dissipating head. Not much lacing. Straw-colored and cloudy.  Aromas of esters very forward and prominent--banana and citrus as expected, and very pleasing. Bubblegum sweetness in the background. Very little if any phenolic spice. Very little yeast. Rather subdued overall, but still a fine aroma.  Tastes much like the aroma in the same order of prominence, with the esters perhaps overpowering the other aspects. Banana and gingerbread flavors immediately come to mind, with a touch of pepper in the aftertaste. Not sickly sweet, but perhaps a bit sweeter than expected.  The mouthfeel is remarkably full-bodied, and even slick, but with a nice crisp finish, doubtless from strong carbonation.  Overall a fine brew that I will likely try again for a re-rate, just in case I got an ""old"" bottle. I like wheat beers, including others by this brewer, but was somewhat disappointed in what others have found to be the ""paragon"" of the style. This one checks all of the boxes for a Hefe, but seemed out of balance, with too much emphasis on the sweetness, and not enough yeast and spice.",Bayerische Staatsbrauerei Weihenstephan,Germany,Hefeweizen,98

252,731,NorthernMichiganLogan,4.33,"I got this beer at my local super market the label caught my eye. ""Weihenstephaner Worlds Oldest Brewery"" had a nice ring to it. I poured the beer into a 24oz glass. Pours with a big head that takes some time to dissipate. In my glass, the beer has a dark yellow top. The bottom of the glass seems to be a lighter yellow. It is a nice, ""eye catchy"" flow. The beer smells very fruity. I can smell very sweet fruit like Bananas and apples, as well as floral hops. It's an overall very pleasant smell. The taste is very different. I have never tasted a beer that tastes quite like this. It tastes very fruity and a little dry. I can defiantly taste the dryness of bread and corn. The beer is also very sweet with a slight barley noticeably banana taste. It also has a nice slight hint of lemon. The taste really blends together as you swallow it. Reminds me of a beer that would be marketed as a ""sumer Ale."" It kind of reminded me of a better version of AtWaters, ""Dirty Blonde."" Overall, it is something that is very different.

I get notes of banana in this beer, also clove. Very pleasant and wonderfully put together. MF- mellow and slight carbonation that makes for a very well balanced and drinkable beer.

Feel: Lighter carbonation than many other wheat beers I've had, which is nice. Smooth in the mouth, with just the right amount of fizz.  Overall: A treat to drink.

Aroma gives you those health food store wheatgrass citrusy lemon precursors on top of grain.  All of that comes out in the taste. Pretty full bodied mouthfeel kind of stuff. The format 500ml is a little expensive compared to 12oz offerings, but this is some pretty good benchmark for the hefeweizen style.

On the palate the flavor of banana and clove and a back note of bubble gum came through especially as the beer warmed while I was drinking it.

Smell: I'm getting heady aromas of banana, rosemary, bitter orange and lemon rind, marjoram and mild gingerbread on the nose.  Taste: Phenomenal. Initially it starts off with a spicy yeasty flavor on the tongue that's reminiscent of banana, graham cracker and clove. I taste notes of vanilla wafer cookies and savory apple strudel mid palate. It finishes off on a slightly bitter dry floral note with hints of honey. Perfectly balanced.  Feel: Light-medium body. Bubbly, crisp, refreshing and flavorsome. Starts off spicy and sweet but finishes dry and slightly bitter so as not to become cloying. The yeast adds a little roughness and weight to the feel and it works really well.

252,731,theamericanpsycho79,4.74,"Been wanting to try this one for a while. The regular version of James Rolfe (the angry video game nerd)'s favorite beer. I heard many good things about it, had to give this one a try. Got a case from Market District for $12, which was a more than reasonable price. Doing this review on the spot.  Poured into a tall glass, its very pure looking. Faint yellow, massive head, very carbonated. The head lingers a long while. The first sip burns. This is a very carbonated beer. The flavor is great upon first impressions, no bitter beer taste, virtually no hops presence. You know its a wheat beer from drinking it. I have heard others say they got hints of bubblegum and banana from this? Not me. Its citrusy, its wheaty, its good. But I would definitely not say its sweet. Its an excellent sipping beer on a warm summer night.  Look: Quite beautiful. Looks like the perfect beer should look. Massive head, bubbly, beautiful yellow color.  Smell: citrusy, pure, literally can smell the history behind the beer. Its no surprise this stuff has been around for so long.  Taste: Delish. An outstanding beer taste. Not bitter one bit. Some citrus hints underneath the carbonation (which assaults the tongue) and a great finish which leaves you begging for more.  Feel: Ouch. Burning sensation from the carbonation which I find to be stimulating. I am used to belgian ales. Anyone that drinks bottle conditioned trappist ales are used to this feeling. I expect it and look forward to it.  Overall: Outstanding beer. Its the best of all worlds, though I am a belgian ale/trappist ale kind of guy, and also love pumpkin ales, this is probably my go-to beer now if I am not forking over all my money for expensive trappist ales or when pumpkin ale is out of season.

It forms a three-finger foamy and creamy head with seemingly everlasting retention. A bevy of bubbles can be seen going to the surface from the very bottom of the glass, nurturing the head of the beer. This beer gives a nice lacing.  Lots of banana, mild bubblegum, wheat malts, very strong biscuit, honey, citrus and clove. Assertive and enticing bouquet.  Excellently rounded and subtle. Upfront the expressive carbonation is felt, and it accompanies the flavor all throughout. Perfect balance, the sweet notes and the hoppy bitterness are equally present in that uniform yet complex flavor that the carbonation unveils. Notes of overripe apple, pineapple, banana, biscuit, wheat malts, hay, honey and clove. The aftertaste is long and slightly sweeter, that crispness dissipates. Medium to full body, slightly silky and very refreshing.  The subtleties and sophistication of this beer's flavor speak for themselves.

S: Fresh citrusy notes (lemon/orange), followed by clove, bubblegum and hints of banana.  T: Taste follows the nose. Citrus flavors come first, clove follows, with light bubblegum flavor and banana subtly coming through in a sophisticated way. All perfectly balanced.  M: Feels light-to-medium bodied. Very smooth and crisp, with perfect amount of carbonation in the mouth.  O: Very refreshing and drinkable, with gentle velvety structure. I would call it a very sophisticated Hefeweizen. Variety of notes are delivered without allowing any of them to be too prevalent, but rather come together in a very nice balance.",Bayerische Staatsbrauerei Weihenstephan,Germany,Hefeweizen,98
252,731,Harrison8,4.39,"Look: Pours a frosty straw color. The head is thick and white, and retains moderate to strong. A nice thin ring of foam sits on top of my beer after a few sips, with any lacing kicked up during the sip sinking back into the ring.  Aroma: Very delightful and playful with the quintessential notes of banana and clove playing a major role. A little Belgian yeast and pollen notes round it out nicely. It reminds me of summer nights spent in the farm fields here in the Midwest.  Taste: A good variety of notes are delivered, and all in balance. Those notes include banana, clove, Belgian spices, yeast, and a hint of pollen/flower. There are complexities that can be sniffed and sipped out, and yet it is just a plain ol' good beer to drink on a hot/warm day. An aftertaste leaves some Belgian yeast and spice on the palate between sips.  Mouth feel: It's well done, with a smooth, velvety texture, and a medium thickness consistency. It certainly keeps it fun and lively to drink.  Overall: This is a beer for any day drinking. The complexities in the aroma and flavor mean it can be sipped and savored or put down in under 60 at a barbecue. Very tasty and fun to drink.  Served in a 12oz snifter.",Bayerische Staatsbrauerei Weihenstephan,Germany,Hefeweizen,98
252,731,The_Atom,4.65,"Pours a beautiful hazy gold-orange with short foam and little lacing that doesn't last too long. Smells of a delicious clove and banana with a subtle hint of other ingredients..  Taste is superb with immediate presence of banana and clove, but with a slight wheat/bread taste as well. Decent carbonation, refreshing, and perfectly balanced flavors for this style. Hands down my favorite Hefeweizen I have ever had.",Bayerische Staatsbrauerei Weihenstephan,Germany,Hefeweizen,98
252,731,Bierliebhaber3,4.48,"This hefe pour a golden color with a thick white foamy head and a good amount of carbonation. The smell is mainly of wheat, but there is also a slight hint of banana as well. The body is light, but there is a nice full wheat and bready malt flavor and a little yeastiness as well. There is actually less fruit and spice flavor than I would have guessed with this one. There is a faint banana flavor in the aftertaste and a little bit of spiciness that lingers on the tongue, but that is about it. The finish is very crisp and a little bit dry. This is much more subdued than the dunkel. This is really an awesomely refreshing beer for a summer day. Everything here is really solidly done, but unpretentious like most German beers. I personally like the dunkel better because it’s slightly heavier and has a little more bold and complex flavors, but I could see how others might like this one better as well.",Bayerische Staatsbrauerei Weihenstephan,Germany,Hefeweizen,98

Very drinkable all day long.",Bayerische Staatsbrauerei Weihenstephan,Germany,Hefeweizen,98

The barman recommended it.  Came in a tall Weihenstephaner glass taken from the freezer.  Word's cannot really describe and sum up what I want to say about this world class beer.  It wasn't on tap very long and I tried to source the bottled (if any) variety. Some Sainsbury's in the UK stock it (Redditch one of them) and Ocado will deliver but it's quite a rarity on sale here.

252,731,FrankMeister,5,"This is by far one of my favorite beers in the world. The look for starters is amazing a golden-honeyish hue is beautiful and the head that forms in the glass, whether it be from a bottle or on draught is perfect everytime. The smell is delicious, you get lemon, banana, wheat and i'd even go as far as to mention a hint of hazelnut. Just to die for. The taste is EPIC!!!!! Smooth, mellow, just the perfect combination of wheat, barley, hops, water and yeast. Yes, the perfect beer in my opinion.  If you see this on draught, in a bottle. DO NOT HESITATE TO BUY ONE!!! You won't regret it. I guarantee it.",Bayerische Staatsbrauerei Weihenstephan,Germany,Hefeweizen,98
252,731,Zaktcc,4.94,"The pinnacle of a hefeweizen. One of the best beers I've ever had the full exceeds and raises the bar of what to expect with a hefe.  A - Pours a golden, honey color with a full, 3 finger head. Incredible head retention that never fully goes away.  S - Powerful and to the point. Banana and cloves. Not much else to say aside from an incredible aroma; no hidden subtleties.  T - The taste follows perfectly in line with the aroma. Optimal blend of bitterness and sweetness, leaving a lingering, banana aftertaste. Perfect match for my personal tastes.  M - Crisp, incredibly smooth and drinkable with the perfect amount of carbonation. Medium - full bodied beer.  O - As close to perfect a beer you'll find. As a big fan of hefeweizen's, I was estatic to finally get a hold of this beer. My expectations were well surpassed. From the moment you start pouring and as the aromas dissipate in the air around you; to the last sip, this beer will not let you down. Only downside - it's now going to be hard to find something that'll compare. Will be stocking the fridge.",Bayerische Staatsbrauerei Weihenstephan,Germany,Hefeweizen,98
252,731,Squire,4.25,"Appearance: Pours a light honey color with the haze one would expect from a Hefe Weissbier. Shimmering gold in the glass. Brilliant fine textured cap with good lacing.  Aroma: Clove accented spices with ripe yellow fruit undertones. No noticeable hop presence.  Taste: Very gentle in a sophisticated way. This beer displays good manners. Not as full flavored as I've experienced in the past which could be due to it's age. Bottling date is 20 OCT 15 and it certainly wasn't kept under refrigeration since then. Perhaps not since it left the Brewery. Some other subdued flavors of banana and/or something similar but not enough to identify let alone quantify.  Overall: I cannot rate this based on what it may have been, only what it is. I bought it for the tasting and figured it would still be ok and it's just that, ok. In the past I've had other Bavarian Hefes that were much fresher and were quite frankly much better. This one seemed like a slightly deflated balloon.",Bayerische Staatsbrauerei Weihenstephan,Germany,Hefeweizen,98

It smells of cloves, banana, lemon, and yeast. What a delicious beer! It is just the right blend of sweet and tart. The clove taste is huge but there is also some sweet banana and citrus. I think it improves as it warms in the glass. It has a nice, creamy mouthfeel with moderate carbonation, and it's ABV of 5.4% is barely noticeable. Overall, this is clearly one of the finest examples of Hefeweizen brewed in the world. It is equally appropriate accompanying a good meal (preferably German) or for casual drinking. Sehr gut!",Bayerische Staatsbrauerei Weihenstephan,Germany,Hefeweizen,98

Also the distinctiveness of the scent and flavor. There's a reason this is such a time-tested beer.  L - cloudy gold with streaming small bubbles, rich white head S - sniff hard and this tingles the nostrils with spice; the quintessential clove and I'd say not too overwhelming on the banana. Some citrus/lemon detected. T - sweetness and spice. Zesty and enjoyable. F - tongue-tingling bubbles O - excellent. I had this side-by-side with Paulaner Hefe-Weizen and both are great.

252,731,Beginner2,4.22,"My 7th beer rated from this monastic brewery's 21 offerings on BA; so I think I've got a good sense of them. It Looks like a hefe, but probably a little clearer and I got a big rocky head that dissipated, but foam stayed around. Smells show a more subtle classic banana; and I prefer the more extreme banana in this style. But truth be told, the subtlety allows the other spices to come through. Also, a modest bubblegum... which is OK in my book. Taste is balanced, the fruits and sweet wheat are kept in check with a dose of hops. Refreshment comes from balance. Feel tells me the wheat works here; softly refreshing. Overall, I've found this pairs well enough with many foods. The sweet malt soothes while bubbles cleanse the palate.  Listed on the ""1001"", it probably very much deserves to be on this list. This hefe also is reviewed in Roger Protz' CAMRA classic ""300 Beers To Try Before You Die!"" I actually need to try this more often because I've noticed it change over time. (Or more likely, I matured and understood this classic better.)  4/26/21 Had yet again and edited the above review and decided it is a good time to start keeping count over at UnTappd.",Bayerische Staatsbrauerei Weihenstephan,Germany,Hefeweizen,98

252,731,mjpoole,4.75,"Look: Poured into a hefeweizen glass, this beer has a beautiful fluffy white head that remains until your last sip. It has a wonderful straw gold color near the head that fades into a more vibrant yellow near the bottom of the glass.  Smell: I got a lemon-y smell mixed with a fruit that I couldn't immediately identify. Some notes of bread. (I'll be honest, my sense of smell isn't very developed yet)  Taste: Excellent. I was finally able to identify where the smell of the beer was coming from: bananas. It had the taste of bananas mixed with sort of an upfront lemon flavor. The aftertaste leaves that banana flavor on your tongue with just a touch of bitterness, enough to let you know that your just drank a beer. I gave this to a friend of mine who isn't really into beer to try and this is the only thing he's had so far that he likes. Extra props for that.  Feel: It feels really smooth to drink, with I'd say a medium amount of carbonation. You're going to be burping a bit from drinking this beer. You get a medium-light mouth-feel from it and there's just this great refreshing coolness to it.  Overall: Just a great beer, first I've had of the style. Really makes me want to go out and try more hefeweizens! Very deserving of a world-class ranking.",Bayerische Staatsbrauerei Weihenstephan,Germany,Hefeweizen,98

252,731,Chris_r2112,4.77,"Let me just start this review by saying that I have had Weihenstephaner many times before, and that it is one of my all time favourite beers, and my all time favourite Hefeweizen. Weihenstephaner is the beer that introduced me to a world beyond macros.  Appearance: One of the most appetizing beers I've ever seen. A pale, orange/gold like colour with about two and a half fingers of extremely creamy head. The beer is extremely cloudy, as sediment blocks almost all light from getting through. Gorgeous lacing on the glass.  Smell: I can't get over how clean and refreshing this beer smells. Absolutely incredible, and easily in the top five beers I've had in regards to the aroma. A floral like aroma filled with banana bread and spices. Pepper is also present. You have to smell this beer for yourself to get a full appreciation of how good it is.  Taste: Absolutely world class. I anxiously await the time that I find a hefe better than this one. Bananas on the forefront with cloves, pepper and bubble gum. A sweet, bready taste is also prominent on the back end.  feel: Again, world class. Medium mouth feel with an almost tangy medium carbonation. Despite the medium body, extremely refreshing.  I can't stop raving about this beer. Whenever I have a friend that wants to try something a little better than Miller or Coors, I pick up a couple of these. One of the tastiest, easiest drinking beers I have ever had the pleasure of drinking. I can not recommend this beer enough if you haven't had it.",Bayerische Staatsbrauerei Weihenstephan,Germany,Hefeweizen,98
252,731,The_Dude_31,4.46,"If there is a better Weißbier out of the bottle I have yet to meet it. I bet this is great on tap too. Only thing I will add to last few reviews is that the feel of this beer reminds me of a nice soft pillow of creamy wheat. By no means a dessert beer, just the best mouth feel I have ever experienced. Can see why this is held in such regard. I am glad I woke up and have started to give these Bavarian Weißbiers the attention they deserve.",Bayerische Staatsbrauerei Weihenstephan,Germany,Hefeweizen,98

Goes down as smooth as can be.",Bayerische Staatsbrauerei Weihenstephan,Germany,Hefeweizen,98
252,731,Jerkheart,4.63,"This is a beer that came out of nowhere and impressed me. It was actually the replacement for another wheaty beer I wanted to try (leffe blonde ale), so I wasnt expecting much. The bar tender seemed disapointed to tell me this all they had when I asked for lighter wheat beer. ""Bananas, cloves"" he warned. I dove right in with a pint after only a taste. Wow. So impressed. It was exactly that. Had that signature Belgium sweet with surprising banana/fruit aftertaste. The look is average. Golden yellow could with some fizz. Stays fizzed for a while though. Feels smooth and mellow going down (what I love). The smell is not powerful. Its really quite unassuming until you get your nose up in there. I would reccomend this beer to anyone who is really involved in the taste. It cant be beat as far as im concerned. Sweet, smooth, fruity, drinkable. Love it.",Bayerische Staatsbrauerei Weihenstephan,Germany,Hefeweizen,98

Look -- A gentle pour gives three fingers of creamy white head sitting atop a hazy pale gold body. Minimal lacing as the head just slides right back down the glass as you sip.  Smell -- Clove, banana, and bubblegum atop bready wheat notes. Yeast and apricot notes are also present in the background.  Taste -- Taste like it smells.  Feel -- Lively carbonation combine with a thick body to create a creamy mouthfeel.

Taste: Imagine liquefied banana bread with notes of cinnamon and nutmeg. Unmistakable Hefe flavors. Pleasant aftertaste that satisfies between tastes.  Feel: Fairly carbonated, medium to light mouthfeel. Deceiving amount of creaminess capable of coating the mouth that lingers well beyond the initial impression.

Aromas of realistic ripe bananas, mild clove. Taste has plenty of banana, a bit of wheat and yeast, clove which can hit a spicy peak, touch of bubblegum. Mostly dry. The burps produced taste just like banana bread. Body is rich and full, which is rare to pull off well in this category. This is, in my opinion, the pinnacle of the style. The flavor is realistic, full, precise, well balanced, and, most importantly, delicious. The body has a creamy quality that in no way diminishes how refreshing this beer is. Love it through and through.",Bayerische Staatsbrauerei Weihenstephan,Germany,Hefeweizen,98
252,731,TheBeerMaster1,4.15,"A great hefeweizen. The color, smell, feel, everything was off the charts. Had the perfect amount of banana clove taste with a tiny bit of a sweet pineapple juice tang and soft corn bread. $3.99 a bottle to me is a pretty good deal.",Bayerische Staatsbrauerei Weihenstephan,Germany,Hefeweizen,98
252,731,OldManMetal,4.88,"This is a beautiful hefeweizen: a giant lingering creamy white head adorns the glass with thick rafts of lacing from its perch atop a pale gold, extra-sparkling body that straddles the line between hazy and cloudy. On the nose, it is a perfect blend of banana/clove spice and yeast, layered in excellent proportion to the big wheaty malt notes that underpin the aroma, with a bit of help from some slight alcohol undertones. The palate follows the nose, with the addition of a slight citrus tang and just a bit of malty sweetness around the edges. The finish is quick: equal parts malt and yeast, followed by a subtle hint of spice that lingers to the next sip. The mouthfeel matches the light body, and the texture is smooth, moderately creamy and very prickly from the extra-fizzy carbonation. This is an exemplary representation of the style, and is both delicious and eminently drinkable. (11.2 oz bottle, 162 days after pkg.)",Bayerische Staatsbrauerei Weihenstephan,Germany,Hefeweizen,98

Amazing orange color with an almost everlasting, thick white head with lots of carbonation going on. A nice, fruity banana flavor comes into my nose. I also smelled some bread and citrus flavors. Very easy to drink and totally refreshing. Its not the best beer in the world but definitely one the best wheat beer around!",Bayerische Staatsbrauerei Weihenstephan,Germany,Hefeweizen,98
252,731,altecgs,4.75,"Extremely impressive, dense and thick three finger head which lasts quite some time. Fruity taste and very clear hefeweizen which is quite unusual.

252,731,Jack_Frost79,4.62,This is what a hefeweizen should taste like. I think this might have been my first hefe way back.

This is an amazing brew.,Bayerische Staatsbrauerei Weihenstephan,Germany,Hefeweizen,98
252,731,jp32,3.98,"Pours orange in color with a slight haze to it. Very nice white soapy-looking head.  Aroma is bready with notes of bananas and lemon zest.  A mild, sweet fruitiness begins the taste. I notice lemon or possibly other citrus notes, a touch of cloves. Finishes somewhat dry, with faint bready flavors scattered here and there.  Mouthfeel and carbonation are both extremely refreshing. High quality stuff.",Bayerische Staatsbrauerei Weihenstephan,Germany,Hefeweizen,98

252,731,BuccoFan,4.19,"For some reason, I've generally avoided hefeweizens. Felt like trying something different, so I bought a couple of bottles of this. Look is an awesome hazy, golden-orangish color. Body is more hearty than you might expect for a <6% beer. Head and lacing are near perfect. Taste was great--I drank this quickly.

Taste wonderful straight from the 6pack bottles or poured into your massive haufbrauhaus glass that has been sitting in your deep freezer at -10 defrees. One of the best things about this beer is how good it taste even when not freezing cold. Unlike alot of cheap skunky american beers, this beer remains delicious even after it loses its just from the fridge temp. I usually grab 2 cold 6packs from whole foods. Or if i don't feel like driving 30 minutes i'll stop into greens beverage to grab a couple room temp 6packs. Lovely beer for all occasions from grilling out to relaxing and watching a baseball game on tv! get some and enjoy!",Bayerische Staatsbrauerei Weihenstephan,Germany,Hefeweizen,98
252,731,ThaneMcC,4.38,"Poured a cloudy light orange with copious off white head and ample lacing. Smells of esters, bubblegum, citrus, light notes of malt. Sweet malts forward with a pleasant citrus zing, banana, cloves around mid-note with a pleasant clean finish – minimal hops or astringency. Mouthfeel is medium bodied with fair amount of carbonation – not syrupy and has a rather clean finish. Overall , the ideal beer on a hot summer’s day – or between runs on a ski slope in Germany. A classic hefe that I go to again and again. Solid. I have yet to find an equivalent American version. . . If you enjoy this beer – check out their Vitus weizenbock – its even better (I like to think of it as an Imperial Hefe)",Bayerische Staatsbrauerei Weihenstephan,Germany,Hefeweizen,98

Aroma of orange with coriander in the back. Low bitterness. Some sweetness.  O - Good Hefe.",Bayerische Staatsbrauerei Weihenstephan,Germany,Hefeweizen,98
252,731,ChrisCage,4.8,"A- This pours an opaque golden/yellow color that is beautiful to look at. The head starts out 3 fingers thick and eventually settles into a meringue like puffy cloud that is still around 1 finger over the Ale....color is super white. The carbonation is much too hard to tell in looks and I can say that the lacing is very modest at best. Still....a very nice looking brew overall!  S- Bananas and yeasty bread is first and foremost on the nostrils, with backing spices of cloves and a peppery note blended in there as well. There are also notes of Lemon and orange citrus zest and sweet caramel malts. The finish has just a hint of hop bitterness and is rather clean and refreshing smelling!  T- Refreshing citrus flavors take over the palate, as opposed to the aromas. Background flavors of baking spice is noted as well.....cloves, nutmeg and a muted peppery warmth balance out the sweet caramel/toffee malts. The finish is of unmalted grains and is very clean and refreshing. The peppery flavors noted linger on the palate with just a hint of heat.  M/O- Solid medium bodied beer with an immaculate carbonation that just blends so well for this style....it's assertive and the way it explodes on the palate really allows the flavors to burst with great intensity! The drinkability factor is perfect and this deserves to be in the top tier of German Hefeweizens.....I could enjoy this all night long without getting tired of it! I will most definitely get this one again!",Bayerische Staatsbrauerei Weihenstephan,Germany,Hefeweizen,98

Taste - Spicy notes with banana and bready yeast. Finish with a spice taste that reminds me of clove but with the perception of heat from the carbonation. Feel - Carbonated and close to a medium feel. Not light but not medium either. Overall - A great beer that is easily drinkable.",Bayerische Staatsbrauerei Weihenstephan,Germany,Hefeweizen,98
252,731,HopsForBrains,4.63,"Although this is a hefe, which ultimately translates to: 'with yeast', the appearance is not nearly as cloudy as say a Franziskaner Hefe or any hefeweizen. Likewise, the notes of banana and clove are very subtle comparatively. Great head, in line with it's style, and an exceptional body make this an EXTREMELY DRINKABLE hefe for even those of the fainter heart which usually yield to the banana/clove characteristics. You really can depend on anything from 'the world's oldest operating brewery, to produce the most drinkable and enjoyable of alcoholic beverages true to their style!",Bayerische Staatsbrauerei Weihenstephan,Germany,Hefeweizen,98

Assuming a best-by period of 1 year, this was brewed 3 weeks ago, so pretty fresh.  L) Medium orangish-yellow colour. Cloudy, although not opaque. Looks quite fizzy. 1cm dense white head.  S) Light sweetish caramel with a bit of light cloves.  T) Taste follows the nose, flavour is light with a good side of caramel sweetness. Banana-clove flavour is there, but is light. Chewy marshmallow tones. Ends up with a more open citrus-edged finish.  F) Fizzy, light with the clovey taste giving some weight. No bitterness.  O) Well well well. Had this one straight after a Franziskaner, and this in my opinion is the more subtle but frankly less tasty pretender. Having said that it is a tasty refreshing drink and it would be dumb to say otherwise. Good, but in my opinion not in the top tier of weizens.",Bayerische Staatsbrauerei Weihenstephan,Germany,Hefeweizen,98

I wish I could get the Live Oak interpretation but sadly they don't distribute outside of Texas.  Banana, clove, you know the deal with a Hefeweizen. What sets this apart is the execution. Beautiful mouthfeel, great fruity chew to it. Carbonation is perfect, looks like a dream in the glass. Head is abundant and lasts a good long while. Improves as it warms up, which is true of almost no American versions of this style. People who swear off the hef because they've never had a proper Bavarian need to better educate their palates before calling it a day.",Bayerische Staatsbrauerei Weihenstephan,Germany,Hefeweizen,98
252,731,TheItalianStallion,4.24,"Poured from a 12oz bottle into a mug because unfortunately I don't have a weizen glass.  A: Pours a picture perfect cloudy golden color with a dense, creamy, 2 finger head of white foam. After a minute or 2 the foam settles to a crown that caps the beer perfectly. A decent amount of lacing is left clinging to the sides of the glass.  S: Aromas of clove and baked banana bread, with a good amount of spice. Some fruity yeast esters and biscuity malts also coming out. A hint of white pepper as the beer warms.  T: There is a refreshing flavor of clove and banana bread with a light spiciness. Biscuity malts and a faint amount of fruity yeast esters. This beer has a somewhat strong phenolic character.  M: Light bodied with high carbonation and a crisp, refreshing mouthfeel. Semi dry on the finish.  O: Overall I thought this was a good beer with interesting flavors of clove and banana. It was crisp and refreshing, and would be a nice thirst quencher on a hot summer day. This could be a pretty versatile beer to pair with a variety of different foods. I would surely drink this again.",Bayerische Staatsbrauerei Weihenstephan,Germany,Hefeweizen,98

Good effervescence, though.  S: Very complex. Lots of wheat and yeast impart scents of banana, clove, coriander, and white pepper. Almost like a Belgian tripel.  T: Follows the nose. The beer is suffused with banana and coriander. Very sweet and spicy. Love the yeast profile.  F: Alright. Can't complain.

Banana shines through beautifully, while balanced by the hops and a coppery whiff, remaining the beers enjoyable balance.  Drinks incredibly smooth, carried by soft yeast, feels utmost silk on the palate, while providing enough carbonation to create an refreshing impression.  Begins with cakey malts, clove, honey and a fantastic yeast smoothness, establishing the beers world-class mouthfeel. While the spices are prominent, they do get tamed by earth, a glimpse of oak and the grassy, slightly herbal hops. Finishes with young banana, more clove and honey, while the hops provide a pleasant, refreshing herb presence.  The interplay between noteable carbonation and euro hops turns out great, as the beer don't need no bitter hop punch to balance the sweeter spices, but uses the metallic qualities from the carbonation to create a short, refreshing burn, taming the sweeter ingredients of the brew.

252,731,ARoman,3.72,"500 mL bottle poured into a hefeweizen glass. The aroma is a mellow, creamy banana and vanilla with a complimentary clove and some subtle undertones of peaches. The beer is a cloudy pale with a hint of gold to it, and is topped by a creamy and frothy white head that retains well and leaves a light lace. The taste is a mellow and mild medium sweet with medium low bitterness. A creamy texture and carbonation go down smooth and easy with a medium body containing notes of fresh baked bread, banana, orange, vanilla, and a light woody clove spice that finishes clean with a lightly bitter clove and citrus zip and crispness that mellows quickly and turns over to a light oranges and nila wafers combination which stick in the aftertaste with a touch of lemon, and a lactose hint.

252,731,majorbase2,4.33,"Pours a murky, golden-yellow color with a white foamy head. Glows a beautiful, radiant golden color when light shines through. Great retention. Little to no lacing.  Aroma contains a strong scent of lemon rind, grassiness, and yeast. Reminiscent of fresh grass clippings on a hot summer day.  Taste is refreshing. Subtle lemon notes and orange zest. A perfect amount of yeast--doesn't dominate but it very present. Hint of bubblegum. Some nice sweet, tartness on the finish.  Mouthfeel is light bodied. Extremely crisp and refreshing. Quite possibly the most drinkable beer I've ever had. I could've chugged this pint in no time.  Overall, Hefes are typically towards the bottom of my favorites list, but this one did quite a bit to change that. Definitely the best Hefe I've ever had, and one of the better beers I've ever had, period. Great beer, one that even a newbie to craft beer could appreciate, or even a craft veteran.

The smell for me is not heavily pronounced, light actually for a hefe.  I had my first, enjoyed it like any hefe lover only could but didn't find anything special. I had a very nice dunkel, then another of these then an Erdinger Urwiesse which was nice then another of these and at that moment realised how good this this is.

It seems to be missing that subtle peppery bite that I look for in a hefeweizen. It doesn't compare to New Glarus Dancing Man - which has set the bar really high. It might be that this beer is not fresh. Could not find the bottle date and bought this off a shelf at room temp.

Taste is really nice with some citrus and bread followed by a muted cinnamon/nutmeg-like spiciness that really makes the beer. Towards the bottom of the pint, the beer started to have a slight metallic after-taste, maybe due to the trip across the Atlantic.

Along with the golden hazed body.  I smell earthy grains and a touch of fruit zest. This oughtta be good...   This brew's taste is a very lively and crisp malt characteristic combined with a slightly dry fruit in there, kind of mid-swig. A very great balance of those tastes and a high drinkability.

The beer is a golden yellow color, thick and hazy, just as a good hefeweizen should look. The aroma of this beer is huge, with wheat, cloves, malt, some light citrus and just a hint of banana. The clove flavors really shine in the taste, along with some nice citrusy notes and banana, with a very nice sweet malty backbone. The mouthfeel is very nice, medium bodied, creamy smooth on the front of the tongue, with the high carbonation adding just the perfect finish on the back of the palate.

A decent, creamy white head fires to an inch before settling to a solid finger.  Aroma: a combination of sweet wheat, citrus and bread. Smells of a properly traditional wheat beer.  Taste: the flavours come through more heavily in the mouth, with those citrus, banana and wehat being accompanied by apricot. A delight.  Aftertaste: the flavours linger nicely for some time. Some dryness comes through here too.  Mouth feel: moderate in feel due to the sediment cloud, with a higher carbonation. Despite the high carbonation, the feel is also quite smooth and a bit creamy, which is a rarity in a wheat beer. Lovely.  Overall: one of the better wheat beers I have had to date. A good mixture of flavours from the hefe spectrum. A well-rounded beer, and decent for an equivalent of AU$65 for a case of 24 x 330mL.

252,731,desertcom1,5,The Bavarian State Brewery Weihenstephan has been brewing beer since 725 A.D. and after 1289 years probably has perfected one of the finest wheat beers in the world.  A golden-yellow wheat beer that pours of a fine white foamy head and emitting a light aroma of clove. When you slather this brew over your caliculus gustatorius (taste buds) this full bodied beer empresses a light banana flavor with a smooth yeast taste. One of my favorite wheat beers and the price is right. Cheaper than most American brewed main-stream beers. Cheers.,Bayerische Staatsbrauerei Weihenstephan,Germany,Hefeweizen,98

Lacing slides down the sides nicely. The smell had a really nice yeasty to breadiness inside of a light orange - ish citrus atmosphere, reminiscent of refreshing qualities running all over. The taste was mainly sweet and bready citrusy notes. Crisp refreshing but not watery citrus aftertaste and sweet bready finish. The mouthfeel was sticky sweet breadiness running over my mouth. Overall, this is more than just a standard for a hefeweizen. In my opinion, this is the end all and be all of hefeweizens.",Bayerische Staatsbrauerei Weihenstephan,Germany,Hefeweizen,98
252,731,enjambed,2.25,"Ever since I heard of Weihenstephaner, I've been eager to try it. It's only my second hefeweizen after Sierra Nevada's Kellerweiss, which I did not enjoy very much. Still eager to develop a taste for the style, I thought I would try a hefeweizen that is generally considered the best in the world. If I don't like this, I may as well give up on the style.  Serving: Undated pint bottle. The label suggests to serve this beer cold, so I got it nice and cool in the coldest part of my fridge before trying it, but made sure not to make it 'ice' cold.  Look: Fantastic. However, I poured a bit too agressively and it produced a giant, frothy, meringue-like head, that settled down eventually but still retained a wonderful shape as it settled down to a reasonable size. Color is a dense golden yellow, without any transparency.  Smell: Up front and center was that same band-aid flavor found in Kellerweiss, and it seemed to dominate-YUCK. On the positive side, there was that sweet malt distinctive to hefeweizens, and possibly the faintest bit of banana.  Taste: Pretty much band-aids and bubble gum. It was difficult to finish.  Feel: Well carbonated, as you could imagine, but almost felt creamy.  Overall: After being disappointed by Kellerweiss, I was willing to give Hefeweizens one more shot with what is arguably the benchmark of the style, but sadly ended up getting disappointed once more. I understand that it is intended for the yeasts to give off a flavor similar to this, and that many other people enjoy it, but it is just not for me, and I think it's only fair for my score to reflect my own experience with the beer. I guess I'm one of those people who are too sensitive to the yeasts/phenols for this kind of beer to be enjoyable. For now I will give up on this style, or maybe try a kristalweizen next.",Bayerische Staatsbrauerei Weihenstephan,Germany,Hefeweizen,98

Arguably the best wheat beer ever. It’s amazing to see a wheat beer not trying to be something else (apricot wheat, raspberry wheat, cherry wheat) and really pulling it off.

No distinct bitterness or hops and seems soft on the tongue but not too sweet. Even with the complex flavors still tasty and drinkable  M - Light to medium which is perfect for the style. High carbonation that is stylistic and lends to the crispness and drinkability.

Very lightly cloudy, orange-ish color with a massive, white foamy head that dies down quickly but remains fed by a steady stream of bubbles.  Smell - immediate hit of banana, mild clove spiciness, some light citrus notes more towards the orange/lemon. Hints of bread - wheat bread, specifically. Pleasant, sets the expectation.  Taste - right in line with the smell. A very slight acidity to balance out the ample sweetness of the beer. Found the banana dominant at times, but overall nice balance between the sweetness, fruit flavors, very slight spiciness, and light pepper notes on the finish. Almost no bitterness.  Mouthfeel - very lively but smooth at the same time. Slightly coats the tongue, a little tingle from the carbonation, but nice body. Minimal aftertaste - very clean, light, refreshing.  Overall - an outstanding beer that delivers on all fronts and does not disappoint. Easy drinking, complex enough to warrant attention but not so complex as to be confusing. Except for the banana coming to the front once in a while, I didn't think any flavor was particularly dominant.

Flavor is more spicy than sweet with clove and some peppercorn; there is some banana sweetness, a touch of bitterness, and a trace of alcohol. Body is medium-light with spritzy carbonation and a good carbonic bite.  Surprisingly complex for a German wheat—others I've had tend to rely more on sweetness and smoothness, while this one punctuates the flavor with peppery and bitter qualities that give it a more mature character.

Enjoyed this on multiple occasions, but never reviewed.  A: 4.5 Cloudy, deep golden-orange body with a small amount of visible sediment that quickly dissolved/settled. 2+ fingers of thick, just off-white head. Good retention. Light lacing.  S: 4.5 Big wheat scents here - major banana and clove. The latter is especially pronounced with this one. Yeasty spice. A touch of strawberry, vanilla, orange. Hay. Coriander.  T: 4.25 Earthy spice initially followed by the development of wheat-fueled sweetness, bready notes and fruit. Enough hops arrive to perfectly balance things out and it finishes semi-dry. Minimal alcohol presence.  M: 4.25 Moderate to high carbonation with a slightly above average body for the style. A tad prickly, but nicely palate coating.  O: 4.25 Great hefe, for sure.

252,731,Markiboy,4.75,"Had this out of a bottle:  Lovely thick head. Golden/amber liquid deliciousness. As others have said, the carbonation is perfect because you neither notice it or not notice it, if you know what I mean? Lots of weissbiers can be totally flat and so you notice the lack of carbonation but this one is perfect.  When I started with this one, I was comparing it to the Hoegaarden Wit-Blanche, since that is obviously a very good standard of beer in itself. Imo, I thought the head was better, the carbonation better, the taste better and all round drinkability better. And I really like the Hoegaarden, too!  This beer is just so smooth, tasty and drinkable that I found myself polishing it off in no time. I kept sniffing at it and holding it up to the light in between sips and then lingering over the sips, so as to prolong the enjoyment of the sip. I could sit and drink 10 of these and probably still want more. For a hot summer's day, you'll find it difficult to find a better beer (alternating in rounds between this and the Rothaus Pils would probably be close to nirvana)!",Bayerische Staatsbrauerei Weihenstephan,Germany,Hefeweizen,98

I'm a little spoiled, since I live in Austin, and we can get Live Oak Hefeweizen on tap in a lot of places here. So, I was a little hesitant to buy this one, but I wanted a hefe, and the guy at Specs said this is the best they have. I still like Live Oak better, but just by a hair. I have seen a number of reviews that rated this beer down a bit, and I would say that something you might do is let it warm up a bit. I started this one at fridge temp, and wasn't really that impressed at first. However, I was called away for a bit, and when I came back the beer had warmed up to probably upper forties, or even higher in temp, and it was AMAZING.

Poured a light yellowish copper with two big fingers of head that pretty quickly dissipated down to a thin film. This offering was quite effervescent. The nose has notes of wheat and funky yeast.

I didn't discern any dryness or hoppiness, but the beer tastes very smooth, well-balanced, drinkable and flavorfull. Unlike some other hefeweissens, I wasn't put off by any excessive sweetness or carbonation. All-around great beer.",Bayerische Staatsbrauerei Weihenstephan,Germany,Hefeweizen,98
252,731,BuckyBeerBeaver,4.84,"The Weihenstephan Brewery in Freising, Germany, was formerly a monastery brewery of the Benedictine monks, and can trace its roots to the year 768 based on a document that refers to a hop garden in the area paying a tithe to the monastery. A brewery was actually licensed here by the City of Freising in 1040, and this is the founding date claimed by the modern brewery. The brewery, therefore, has a supportable claim to being the oldest working brewery in the world (in competition with Weltenburg Abbey, also in Bavaria, which has had a brewery in operation since 1050 and claims to be the oldest). When the monastery and brewery were secularised under Napoleon's occupation in 1803, they became possessions of the State of Bavaria. Since 1923, the brewery has been known as the Bavarian State Brewery Weihenstephan (Bayerische Staatsbrauerei Weihenstephan), and is operated in conjunction with the Technical University of Munich as both a state-of-the-art production facility and a centre for learning. Having had 1,000 years to work on their craft, I was looking for something special from Weihenstephan!  We sampled the brewery's Hefe Weissbier (""HW"") in a 500 ml bottle purchased from the LCBO, with a best before date of September 9, 2012. HW was 5.4% alcohol by volume. It poured a naturally cloudy, light orange colour with about 2"" of fluffy, white, long lasting head that left plenty of lacing and spotting down the glass. The aroma was fabulous...bananas, cloves and yeast...and remember that this is a beer that complies with the Bavarian purity law and therefore contains no bananas or cloves. Darn clever, the things those Germans can do with the right strain of yeast! The taste very much followed the aroma, with bananas, cloves, wheat and yeast evident. The amount of carbonation was just right with lots of small bubbles on the tongue, and the mouthfeel was creamy. HW also had the clean finish I look for in my favourite beers. Ladies and gentlemen, if this isn't the epitome of the brewer's art, it has to be close! At $3.05 per 500 ml bottle this beer is a decent value for money as well, and HW now joins my short list of regular purchases.",Bayerische Staatsbrauerei Weihenstephan,Germany,Hefeweizen,98

They are all holding hands and singing together. Fantastic.  Mouthfeel: Medium bodied, creamy. Perfect carbonation.

The pour is slightly cloudy and golden in color and a big white frothy long-lasting head simply explodes from the top of this thing and fills up the entire globe at the top of the glass. Bubbles continue to stream up from the bottom of the glass long after pouring. The nose betrays all those delicious fruity esters and spicy phenols lying within. Lots of crisp wheat, bananas and clove on the nose.  Medium body, but full of flavor and deeply refreshing. There are some sweet, grainy, bready cereal-like notes up front and then a barrage of fruit, bananas and lemons mostly, and just a kiss of noble hops. The fruit runs the whole gamut from sweet (bananas) to tart (lemons). I also get just a hint of vanilla in there. Very few beers are as easy to drink as this one, especially on a nice sunny spring day.  I can't count how many times I've had this beer and finally am getting around to reviewing it.

A billowing meringue-white head condenses to a puffy pillow after an eternity, leaving dense patches of lace on the Weihenstephaner weizen glass. Lazy carbonation rises from within.  The aroma is against a white bread background with the anticipated banana and clove being fairly subtle. Bubble gum and honeydew were also discernible.  The banana comes forward in the first sip, while cloves remain subdued. A background of vanilla gives way to sharp banana flavors just before a subtle, slowly-fading finish. This Hefeweissen is sweeter than anticipated with a hint of tartness.  Medium to full body with a soft cotton texture. Ample, prickly carbonation. No alcohol. Residual sugar deposits on lips.

Taste: Very slightly banana sweetness when it touches the tongue, but quickly changes to a heavy wheat bread and yeast taste that over powers before any of the subtle notes can be enjoyed. I think I may have tasted a little citrus on the end but hard to decipher.  Opinion: I feel kind of let down with this.

Smell is a sweet blend of lemon grass, clove, banana and white pepper. Not a ""strong"" aroma but pleasant and intriguing.  The texture is exactly what I want in a wheat beer. Crisp carbonation on the tongue followed by a smooth light-medium body with a nice dry finish. The taste is more or less what you'd expect from the smell. Clove followed by faint citrus, banana, and a slight bitterness provided by an earthy grassy hop note. The finish is pretty clean with just a little yeasty spice lingering.  I've not had many European hefeweizens but this one is easily the best so far. Very well balanced and one of the easiest drinking beers I've ever had.

Pours a hazy yellow/gold in color with a good 3-finger white head that does settle down to about 1/2 a finger. Lots of lacing is seen with each sip.

Poured from bottle into a standard glass. VERY cloudy. The most opaque wheat beer I have tried.  Smell was a little on the sweet side. Not offensive at all.  Taste was almost neutral. Well balanced with little to no aftertaste.  Mouthfeel was almost acidic due to the amount of carbonation. But I do enjoy lots of that.  Overall I was very happy with this beer.

Clove start is the most obvious, also some spice light banana, apple. Then goes in to crackers medium sweet wheat middle. Ends with earthy yeast with light bitterness and some banana esters.

252,731,Ljudsignal,4.3,"12oz bottle split with my girlfriend. Poured into my Three Philosophers snifter.  Pours a gorgeous hazy golden shade capped with a massive, pillowy three-finger head. Solid retention on the head, which gradually subsides to a quarter-finger film atop the beer. Spotty but clingy lacing.  In the nose, a potent banana note reigns supreme, with subtler (but still not particularly subtle) notes of clove, bready yeast, and wheat supporting the dominant banana note. A light, sweetish lemon note as well, more lemon meringue than lemon itself.  In the mouth, lemony notes mingle with banana and fleeting clove on the front of the palate, while light bready and yeasty notes dominate mid-palate. Becomes increasingly dry as the beer reaches the back of the palate, finishing quite dry and rather spicy. Feels more like a wit than a hefe in that regard...or perhaps I simply haven't been drinking the right hefes.  On the tongue, crisp, light, dry, and effervescent. ABV is all but unnoticeable, though it does lend a certain warmth towards the back of the palate and lingers in the aftertaste.  On the whole, this is truly deserving of its place among the top 250. While wits and hefes may never be my favorite style, I can absolutely understand the praise for this particular one.",Bayerische Staatsbrauerei Weihenstephan,Germany,Hefeweizen,98

I am an IPA person myself and I saw the great reviews for this beer and it lived up to every expectation of its hype.  It will definitely be a summertime favorite for me, as it is unmatched by any other hefeweizen. The taste and feel of this beer is superb. You do not get too much wheat from this beer, the flavors are surprisingly complex and balanced at the same time.  Highly recommend, if you like wheat/hefeweizen beer this is exactly what you need.",Bayerische Staatsbrauerei Weihenstephan,Germany,Hefeweizen,98
252,731,Redneckwine,4.71,"My first review! Fairly new to the craft beer scene/geekery but have experienced quite a few microbrews over the past 10 years. I've been cruising beeradvocate for the last month or so and I love this site. Today I picked up a bomber of Weihenstephaner Hefeweissbier on recommendation from the forums, so let's see what happens...  A - Poured slightly chilled out of a bomber into pint glass, swirled to incorporate sediment goodness. Two fingers of head recedes into a persistent, thin sheet after a minute. Looks very enticing.  S - Smells of banana, cloves and other spices, and a wheaty maltiness. Smells nice and sweet, I like it! Almost picking up a faint bubblegum note?  T/M - Taste general follows the nose it seems - starts with a nice wheaty crispness follow by the spicy banana notes, then ends with more crisp wheat. Finish seems to go on and on with all the flavors noted above, and makes me want to keep drinking and stop typing this review. Medium/light mouthfeel, nice and dry to my pleasant surprise, due to the sweet smell.  O - It's no wonder this beer is rated so highly, It's one of the best beers I have ever had, and definitely the best hefe I've had. It's a stark difference from the last hefe I had, which I think was a Widmer almost a year ago - it's just no comparison, they are two totally different beasts. The Weihenstephaner was a flavor bomb and now I wish I had another to drink!",Bayerische Staatsbrauerei Weihenstephan,Germany,Hefeweizen,98

This is one of the best beers I have ever had and probably THE beer that got me into craft brews.  A: It looks glorious. It's a hazy, pale orange/yellow. It even looks like wheat.  S: Wheat and banana, a clear preview of the taste.  T: Banana is the overwhelming flavor. You can taste the wheat and citrus but the banana outshines anything else by a mile. One of the smoothest and most refreshing beers I have tasted.  F: Crisp and smooth. Not too heavy but not to light.  Overall: An excellent medium-bodied, almost sweet, beer.

The smell is yeasty with hints of banana and spices.  The beers tastes very pleasant and refreshing. There are some citric notes and some bready sweetness with another hint of banana. Not much hoppiness in this beer.  The mouthfeel is nicely carbonated and adds to the overall refreshing nature of this beer.  Overall this is a very well balanced and easy drinking beer with some interesting but fairly subtle and delicate flavours. It would be particularly nice on a hot summers day and makes a nice alternative to a pilsener. I didn't think it was quite as amazing and wonderful as the ratings suggest. But it was good.

Smell: Puréed banana bread, apricot and tangerine esters. Clove-like scent is more prominent upon warming, as is a smattering of peppery and floral spices.  Taste: Bready malt, with the slightest tang from citrus esters. Banana and bubblegum flavors are more present in the aftertaste. Less focused on esters and spices than other Hefeweizens. The flavor is more malty and subdued, which I enjoy because it actually adds a layer of complexity by pairing yeasty flavors with malty ones.  Mouthfeel: Medium body, with fair carbonation. The wheat makes the body feel slightly heavier, but there is also a silky quality to the mouthfeel that makes things more smooth and sessionable.  Overall: A more balanced, malt-forward Hefeweizen, which creates, for me, somehow both a rounder and more complex flavor profile.

The oldest brewery in the world just showing you what perfection looks and tastes like.  I would rank this my second favorite Hefe beer next to the Ayinger Bräu Weisse. I reviewed that beer already and I think I gave this Weihenstephaner beer a better review, haha, oh well. I just LOVE the really forward banana flavor of the Ayinger and the champagne mouthfeel. Its just a matter of preference. If you handed me either one of these beers I'd give you my first born child. The Weihenstephaner is a better deal though. I can get it for less than $2 a bottle (11.2oz) while the Ayinger is about $3.50 (16oz) a bottle (it has about 5oz more of yummy juice though).

Aroma is a bit more subtle than I would have liked, however.  Taste is BIG phenolic banana and cloves, wonderfully wheaty and bready.

Tastes like a classic, iconic take on the style, cloves and allspice, banana and perhaps another tropical flavor like subtle mango, more hops than other examples of the style which cut the intense sweetness but not enough to wreck the sweetness or push it too far away, a near perfect balance really. Where Ayinger is weighted towards the fruit, this one leans towards the spice, with a strong clove flavor building as you progress through a bottle.

252,731,ThisWangsChung,4.32,"Re-review. 11.2 oz bottle into a regular pint glass.  A: Pours an extremely hazy golden color. Poured aggressively, it yielded over three fingers of fluffy, white-colored head. Retention isn't the best - I can visibly note it fading away as I type this. It leaves more lacing than others in the style, though.  S: Aromatically, it's just a hefeweizen - banana and clove esters dominate, with only a touch of noble hops to balance. What makes it great is that it seems like the distilled essence of everything a 'weizen should be. Some are heavy in banana, others are heavy in clove; this one is heavy in both, not to mention perfectly balanced between the two.  T: Just like in the aroma, it takes a bit of time for this to 'click' on the senses; before that, this drinks like just another quality hefeweizen...until one realizes that this is so perfectly balanced and delicate, it's freakin' effortless. The best part is that there aren't really any stand out notes, just banana/clove esters to open it up, a faint kiss of finishing noble hops. Oh wait, I lied about that one - there's a distant orange note on the palate somewhere that really make this one special, even compared to other great examples of the style. Not to mention the wheat is incredibly soft yet vibrant. Could go on all day waxing about this one...  M: Light in body, with a dry-ish finish and plenty of carbonation. Only detractor is a touch of finishing astringency. But just like I said, effortless to drink.  O: I have no doubts this is the benchmark of the style for good reason. This one is on my list of ""would purchase by the case"" beers.",Bayerische Staatsbrauerei Weihenstephan,Germany,Hefeweizen,98

The beer was very drinkable and could be sessioned easily. It poured a hazy yellow with nice white head that did not leave much of a lace. The mouthfeel was lighter in body with good carbonation.

Pure greatness.  T - Banana, sweet malts, cloves, apricot, some yeasty esters.  M - Decent carbonation, but not overbearing, medium body due to the fact that it's unfiltered, a bit creamy. Amazingly balanced.  O - If you've never had this, do yourself a favor.

A very delicious and drinkable beer. One of the best tasting beers I have ever had.  MF_Very refreshing. Little bit of carbonation.  After much consideration I have concluded that this is my favorite beer. I love hefes and this is the king.

The beer looks like a Bavarian Hefe beer should looks, hazy, creamy, and golden colored.  S: The smell is absolutely delicious. The smell of banana and cloves are so intense you can smell it without nosing it. It's that good. There is also a breadiness to the smell.  T: Exactly what you should expect from a wheat beer. Bananas, cloves, sweet flavors all around. I got a taste of cloves as I first took a sip and it ended with the taste of bananas that comes with the type of yeast that is used to brew this beer.  M: A very light and smooth mouthfeel. There is no hint of alcohol and you can easily down several of these without even realizing it.  O: If you are looking for the best wheat beer in the world, I would strongly recommend picking a six pack of these up. It is the best example of a Bavarian Hefe Weissbier out there and you owe yourself the experience that this beer will provide. I am rating this beer as a wheat beer and therefore I'll give it a perfect 5/5 in all categories because this is what other wheat beers want to be.

With control got a dense finger thick head that lingered and remained thick and clingy at the edges.  S: Smooth pleasant sweet banana bread. Lots of fragrance especially after pouring when head was still present. Others present but I cant pick them out yet. Remained pleasantly fragrant to the very end.  T: A swirl of banana and I presume clove, takes noticably longer for all the flavors to rise and fall than most beers. No one thing is overly dominant, everything cooperates. Low but complementary bitterness that is only really noticable when modest carbonation bring it out during the flavor swell.  M: Slightly syrupy and clingy, wants to hang around a bit. Modest carbonation tingles the tounge while the whole mouth gets coated with the wheaty malt.  O: This is very close to perfection. Easily the best hefeweizen I've ever had and what's more the best beer or any type I've ever had to date even over my own homebrew.

This beer has a really good amount of flavor and really sets the standard for the style. Still, not mindblowing, but just really well done.

252,731,taxandbeerguy,4.78,"500 ml bottle from LCBO for $3.05 CDN. Poured into a pint glass.  Appearance - Hazy golden beer with decadent pillows as a cream head. Head recedes to substantial cap reminiscent of cumulus clouds. Wispy top remains through serving.. Brilliant.  Smell - Clove bubblegum, banana and coriander going on. Also maybe a hint of orange and maybe even just the faintest notion of smoke for added complexity. Bubblegum sweetness more prevalent on second and third sniffs.  Taste - The clove really comes through here with fermented banana. The bubblegum sweetness is a supporting figure here as is the orange peel. Sweetness is modest but just right. Tiny amount of hops noticeable adding to the great complexity. Slight aftertaste laves you only wanting more.  Mouthfeel - Perfect. Medium / high carbonation gives a rich, creamy feel but the beer remains astonishingly light given the array of flavors and decent level of booze. Extremely refreshing left with clean plate. Also wet, while retaining the flavors extremely quaffable in mere moments.  Overall - Spectacular beer, one of the top three I've ever had. Also has sentimental value as this was the beer that turned me on to trying all sorts beers instead of the standard non-beer advocate's drink list. Not much else to be said that hasn't already been said about this beer, other than this brew represents beer royalty at its finest.",Bayerische Staatsbrauerei Weihenstephan,Germany,Hefeweizen,98

Spot-on aroma of German yeast and malted grains, barley and wheat well proportioned. Flavour starts sweet and wheat-forward, with a yeast-forward body and a nicely clean, crisp finish.  Not a beer that I would personally choose on a regular basis, as I'm not a fan of the yeast or grain bill, but it is definitely well brewed.

O: Overall, I've had a couple from Weihenstephaner and I've been relatively impressed every time and today is no different.

Salt water taffy (sweet). Sour.  Taste - Not to be repetitive but I taste malt and taffy. I also detect a very Belgian sour flavor (Is this because of the yeast?). Very tasty!  Mouth - Smooth and buttery. Fine yet prominent carbonation. A very substantial brew.  Overall - Delicious!

Truly a classic Hefe here, yummy stuff!  M - Mouthfeel is light to medium, medium to high carbonation. Smooth beer as well.

Taste great.  Just superb.  The crisp powdery hefe is refreshing, with the sweetness and spiciness playing well against each other and some subtle hops rounding out the flavor.    Mouthfeel was spot on.  Full but not thick.  The yeast in suspension helps create that illusion of fullness without thickness in my opinion.

Not a whole lot of bitterness from the hops is noticeable. Finishes clean and smooth. Slight twangs of alcohol remain after the beer has gone down.  F: Medium to full bodied. The carbonation is mild and well-controlled. Drinkability on this one is very high. I could knock a few back without effort.  O: I have to admit, I was as skeptical as you could be on this one...

The tastes expand into many minor yet noticeable directions. Sweet crisp apples, spices, cut grass, minerals and a mild boozy vodka taste all add to the complexity. This is one very gulpable hefe!

This beer is medium-bodied, but with the strong carbonation it still feels lively in my mouth.  O - This is way more than I expected when I ordered it.

252,731,Beric,4.82,"Serving: 500mL bottled poured into 500mL Hefeweizen glass. Served: April 2013  Appearance: Magnificent, opaque golden yellow that just looks smooth and inviting. Poured slowly into the glass to avoid the monster heads from the wheat and yeast in Hefeweizen. Head settled to a healthy two and a half fingers and very slowly dissipated over the course of drinking the beer.  Smell: Fresh, banana-y, clean, welcoming. A lot of people smell/taste clove in Hefeweizen and I'm definitely not getting any of that. The banana smell, though present, is subtle and not overpowering.  Taste: Like the smell, it tastes just slightly banana-y, from the yeast used. The yeast adds a nice, somewhat bready backbone to the beer. This beer is made to let the yeast shine- there is very little, if any, hop presence, and the malt backbone is light, allowing the yeast's flavoring effects (banana, 'clove') to come through the beer. I could drink this one all day, it is simply so refreshing- simple, but still noteworthy in its ability to so perfectly balance its flavors.  Mouthfeel: Smooth and fuzzy from the yeast and carbonation. Makes it all the more refreshing.  Overall: This is probably one of the best beers I've had, and the gold-standard for the Hefeweizen style.

It is creamy, off-white and sits on top of a bright, straw-colored body.  Nose is slightly banana-clove like, but not in an offensive way. Even stronger than the banana-clove smell is an incredibly strong yeasty/bready note, it almost smells like loaf of bread dough.  The taste is strongly yeasty and bready, must like the nose. This is a definitely a hefeweizen and a very, very good one at that. The mouthfeel is perhaps the best characteristic of this beer, it is thick and chewy with lots of suspended yeast.

The aroma is always there, not hoppy, not malty, not full of yeast, but a pleasant combination of them all. Knowing this was a wheat beer, I anticipated besides the cloudiness, all the spices that you normally find in wheat beer, the orange, coriander, etc. Not with this one, oh, I knew it was a wheat beer, so refreshing, but the spices were down played.

Flavor matches the nose, with banana and clove complementing a refined wheat flavor. The wheat becomes most pronounced in the finish, while the front end remains more juicy. Yeast character lends some nice complexity and texture as well. The mouthfeel is spectacular, with lively, velvety carbonation that caresses the palate and enhances the quintessential flavors of the beer.

The flavor begins sweet with lots of banana and bubblegum. Some orange citrus followed by clove and a little pepper balance out the sweetness. It finishes dry with lingering sweetness and clove.

It's a beautiful, creamy, cloudy, light orange colored delight. The head quickly goes away, but the thin lace that is left is bigger than most and a chunkiness sticks to the sides of the glass.

Taste is phenomenal. Wow is this a refreshing beer. Bright notes of orange zest, clove, wheat, banana, and cream--although the mouth feel may just be tricking my senses.

Bananas, clove, prairie grass, buttery yeast, and fruity undertones. Such an outstandingly profound aroma that really makes you remember this brew.  Taste: The balanced yeast comes in right away at the front. The yeast tingles throughout the body of the brew. The complexity of the brew is fantastic but at the same time comes together so well. A banana and overall fruity taste lingers for so long on the palette. There is a slight dryness during the aftertaste with a completely exotic fruit taste. Wonderful.  Mouthfeel: Yeast dryness. Medium bodied overall which makes this a very easy going drinking experience.  Overall: The fact that everyone calls this such a classic brew is a testament to how wonderful this brew is. A classic that is great for those with a wonderfully developed palette or those who are just breaking into the craft scene.

Orange, lemon, and coriander form the initial aroma, supported well on a backbone of wheat. Tangerine and apple and banana yeast esters add complexity. Clove becomes evident as it warms.  Flavor is fairly yeasty, with a bready, slightly dry toasted malt finish that cuts things a little short. Underlying esters of bananas and bubblegum accent the citrus notes of tangerine and orange pith. Coriander and clove are somewhat subtle.

Pour results in a four finger, creamy white head which becomes rocky as it settles. Excellent head retention and lacing. Very good looking hefeweizen.  Smell: Big ripe banana aroma immediately hits the nose. This is followed by a sweet, bubblegum note and finishes with an earthy, spicy character (very clove like).  Taste: A lot of the wheat character hits at first, gradually taking on the fruity, banana notes. Similar to the nose, this picks up a slight bubblegum sweetness before finishing strongly with earthy, clove taste.  Mouthfeel: Medium body to this as it travels through the mouth. The carbonation is evident as it scrubs over the tongue, cleansing the palate very nicely. Finishes with an inviting, warmth from the spice. Sticky, but smooth, and very easy to drink and refreshing.  Overall: This is an excellent example of a wheat beer.

Glorious fluffy head left its mark after each swallow & never completely disappeared. S - Nothing remarkable for the style, but certainly nothing off-putting T - Similar to the taste, I was impressed by how seemingly unremarkable this beer is for the style- clove, wheat, yeast, all expected- with the exception of the fact that no one flavor dominates. There's a good balance here. M - Sense of balance is especially present here. Nothing is out of place. Finishes a bit dry, but not parching, encouraging further tasting. Easy to drink. O - I was excited to try this beer. Heck, it's the #1 rated Hefeweizen on the site after withstanding thousands of reviews. I can understand why, for this style, many consider this to be the best of the best: clearly there's an artistry to the elegance of this beer's execution.

T: It's sweet to start with a light malt base, and big banana and clove notes. Those flavors last through to the finish, where I get bit of yeast, but nothing too crazy.  M: Light bodied beer.

Yeast fruity esters (apricot, pear, apple, banana), nice sweet biscuit malt, all leading to a somewhat dry finish.  M: Light body, good carbonation sensation, low alcohol presence.

252,731,DrinkingWithCruthers,2.81,"Disappointment truly is a hard thing to swallow and in this case somewhat literally. As a lover of beer and all that it has to offer, I sometimes find myself at odds with my worldly and often better educated beer peers. While some revel in the rebel spirit, I find more often than not that rebels are simply ignorant of the point and rebel for the simple sake of rebellion. I like to think that with the years I've grown in both taste and the ability to see the positions of others. However in this case, I must simply disagree.  Weihenstephaner's Hefeweizen(for my peers outside of old Europe) is highly regarded and it appears to be seen as a genre defining creation. However I wonder, who defines this genre? Does it change with time? And finally isn't enjoyment ultimately the thing that matters most? Coming from the northwest region of the United States, I find Hefeweizens to be mostly defined as a cloudy citrusy affair with a bright white head. However recently I've found newer breweries bringing back more of those delicious banana and clove tones that I so adore. Which is why I am so disappointed in this genre ""original"".  Appearance is exceptional for the genre and quite appealing visually with its mysterious orange yellow body and glass clinging white head. The smell is quite good as well if not a bit subdued. When we reach the taste though, this beer goes south immediately with a strangely aggressive carbonation. From there one is reminded somewhat of a pilsner with a lemon wedge on the side and to top it off, it leaves with a hint of iron and bitterness drying your tongue. Where is the banana? Where are the cloves? I want my smooth mouthfeel and delightful characters damn it! Instead I'm left with a mediocre beer that languishes and slowly warms much to my disinterest.  To be fair though, where I'm at is nearly half way around the world from this beers origin and perhaps I may have gotten a bad bottle or two. I've always said, ""fresh beer is best beer"". Though to play devils advocate, I have had an exceptional hefeweizen from the same area, in the same bottle and stored in the same manner with nary a complaint. I don't know, all I do know is I don't get this beer, I don't want this beer and will not be having it again anytime soon when so many more exciting and satisfying options surround me.  Label - 2 I include this with each bottle/can review because I feel that for the average consumer to even approach an unknown beer, it's the packaging that entices rather than the actual end product.

I was also an idiot and drank it straight from the bottle but that didn't stop it from being delicious. Bought a single from Wegmans for about $3. My first impressions likened this beer to fresh banana bread with some clove, and it was very smooth and easy to drink. Had a good combination of bitterness and sweetness that was both subtle and pleasant in character.

Looks like a terribly satisfying beer.  Smell: Banana hits the nose first, along with other fruity notes - maybe some pear, apricot. Cloves and maybe some light corn. Smells good.  Taste: The taste matches the smell surprisingly well which is very nice. Banana and clove notes mixed with some honey and wheat. The finish is what separates this from other hefes - supremely smooth and crisp finish. Delicious.  Mouth-feel: Perfect amount of carbonation, superbly well-balanced body, not too light and not too thick or sticky.

Lots of head. Minimal lacing with great retention.  Smelled cloves, banana and honey up front, followed by some slightly corn and skunky malts with a whiff of vomit. Could smell the carbonation.  Tasted much better than the smell. Got cloves, spices and banana with a sweet aftertaste. Light lemon grass as well. Just fantastic.  Light body. Oily texture. Lively (above average) carbonation.

252,731,ChrisKayler,5,"Drinking one of these after a long rewarding day at work. Mmmm!  Glass: Samuel Adams Perfect Pint.  Appearance: A beautiful hazy yellow amber color. I stirred up the yeast at the bottom before my final pour. Watching the yeast drop down through the beer and slowly mix is one of the best parts of a hefeweizen! If poured aggressively, a huge head appears and sticks around for quite a while. I prefer to give it a gentle pour to keep the head in check (it's still substantial, even with a gentle pour) and keep a bit more of that refreshing carbonation around.  Smell: Bubblegum, RIPE bananas are the major smells here. A bit of breadiness and honey, perhaps. Delicious.  Taste: Just like a good hefeweizen should. This is my favorite hefeweizen that I have tried so far. The initial taste is like that of bubblegum. A bit of banana, but not as much as the smell would suggest. There is a tiny bit of breadiness in there. None of the ""Wit"" type flavors that found in some hefeweizens, particularly American ones. Very little alcohol noticed, which is to be expected.  Mouthfeel: Medium body with high carbonation. Really refreshing.  Overall: My first perfect 5 beer, and one that will always remain a favorite of mine.

How do I question the paradigm hefe when it is so established? Well, I'll rate this to style, and of course it will be a perfect score. However, my review will reflect the fact that wheat beers do not appeal to me. Let us begin.  Poured from the bottle into a Weihenstephan hefe glass, complete with the twirl and twist at the end of the pour. Hazy golden hay colored, or perhaps even banana colored when held to the light. Beautiful foamy white head that piles up over the top of the glass. The aromas are of that characteristic wheaty twang, bananas (but much less than what some of my friends describe as ""holy cow this smells like banana!""), bit of clove and spice, and a yeasty goodness that wraps up the aromas nicely. The flavors are very much like that of the aromas. A very slight hint of earth in the finish. Well carbonated and light bodied. Makes for a good summer beer.  Now, I must admit that I do not like wheat beers. The wheat twang kills it for me. If I were to rate this to my opinion, it would be 5/3/3/3/3, where my 5 would be given to the presentation of the beer.

252,731,Maxwell,4.5,"The beer pours much like the kristallweissbier, but with more pulpy appearance that slightly hints at pink as it pours into the glass. In the glass, the beer looks a lot like cloudy dehydrated piss, with a huge big, creamy, white head. The body is quite hazy, sitting somewhere in between the clarity of apple juice and the murkiness of apple cider. Lacing is fat and sticky on the sides of the glass, leaving puffs like the clouds in the sky. On the nose, the beer smells wonderfully of spicy banana breads, with nice clove notes, and some definite hints of mint in the afterlingerings of the scent. There is even a slight spicy pepper in the scent, sitting below the other rich scents. The smell is thicker and richer than the kristallweiss’s (obviously) with a much grittier and natural flavor.  The beer tastes richly of bubblegum banana with clove spice notes. The beer begins with bubblegum and spice; just as it is building in flavor a slight yeasty funk can be felt in the taste, but is quickly washed away by the big banana bread flavors that have been building in the mouth. This eventually wanes down into a banana aftertaste with light clove and bubblegum hints at the sides of the tongue. The mouthfeel of this beer is superbly creamy, with light carbonation and a medium to slightly heavy and leaves the mouth with a thick sticky feeling on the tongue while the mouth as a whole feels clean, but slightly coated in candied banana. Overall, this is a superb hefeweizen, as would be expected from the oldest brewery in the world. I hold this up there with Zero Gravities Weizenheimer as the best in the style.

Pale straw in color. Totally cloudy and unclear as expected. Good amount of bubbles can be seen rising from the bottom of the glass. Very small sized bubbles here. Decent lacing as well.

Some tartness due to high carbonation. Not exactly very dry finish.  Mouth feel: light to medium bodied. Refreshing effervescence due to carbonation, which is too much, exactly as per the style.

252,731,kagent777,4.44,"12 oz bottle that was purchased in Las Vegas with the code 1282 stamped into the back. Poured into my perfect pint glass.  Appearance: Easily the most massive head I have seen, white, solid and 1/2 the glass. The beer is a hazy straw color. Leaves some lacing as it goes.  Smell: Yeast, wheat, lemony phenols, clove, bubble gum and a little band-aid. Exactly how a good hefe should smell.  Taste: Delicious wheat with citrus overtones, most from the yeast and maybe a touch from hops, I suspect. Clove comes out a little more strongly in the taste. Actually pretty thirst quenching. This one does not bowl you over with intensity (big stout of IPA) but the flavor has a tone of great quality.  Mouthfeel: Smooth texture and a lower amount of carbonation (due to the massive head) make for a great feeling beer.  Overall: These guys have been brewing this one for a while, so I imagine that they have perfected this style. I would tend to agree.

The nose is full of yeast, wheat, malts, light spices including clove and maybe coriander, and a faint hint of fruity sweetness. The taste follows the style of hefeweissbiers very closely (after all, this is the original as they say), full of sweet fruity esters; banana, faint lemon and orange zest, hints of clove and kitchen spices, and a rush of sweet malt, and a cyclone of pure yeast, extremely reminiscent of bubblegum. Alcohol makes an appearance, although very faint at 5.4% ABV, it provides a nice structure to control everything else. Wheat on the tongue and breads and yeast in the aftertaste - this beer is delicious. Lots of carbonation provides a nice, crisp snap on the tongue; thin-medium body.  The claims they make about this beer aren't false or even exaggerated - this is some truly great stuff, here.

Huge rocky and pillowy white head, sustains long after the pour and reduces to a solid layer leaving sticky lace on the glass.  S- Classic banana and cloves, earthy, cellar like yeast. Sweet wheat with a hint of lemon-grass, just a trace of hop bitterness. Very nice.  T- Sweet malted wheat, highlighted by somewhat tart lemon notes and a bit of clove. Hops are minimal, finishes dry with a cracker like maltiness. The yeast is a bit nutty and I pick up some refreshing fruity notes as well. The alcohol is noticable but is balanced nicely. The linger on the palate is fruity and refreshing, long after tasting.  M- medium body with a healthy bit of carbonation, mouthfeel is super creamy and goes down like velvet.  O- this one lived up to the hype for me. By far the best Hefeweizen that I've had and will enjoy this one many times to come. I can only imagine having one of these fresh overseas.",Bayerische Staatsbrauerei Weihenstephan,Germany,Hefeweizen,98
252,731,rickyleepotts,3.08,"I know I have had this beer before… I just don’t remember it. Oh, and sorry we have not written in a while. I was in Dallas on business, and have just been really busy lately. But we have some new motivation… before I leave for a week on another business trip! Anyway, tonight we are grabbing a bottle of Weihenstephan Hefe Weissbier. I wonder if anyone out there can pronounce the name of the brewery… not you German readers. Other readers!  Anyway, looking forward to reviewing this beer. I don’t have an orange. I hope I can still enjoy the beer!  In the Glass: It’s light yellow in the glass, and pours a two-finger head. The lace is weak, but the head stays strong when swirling the beer in the glass back and forth.  Nose: That is what a beer is supposed to smell like. It is filled with yeast and has a subtle dryness to it. I just want to take a big chug of this. Like I said, I know I have had this beer before… just not sure what it tastes like. Based on the style, I need an orange. But I hear it’s not cool to fruit your beer.  Flavor: This isn’t ice cold, as we just bought the bottle tonight. But I threw it in the freezer when we got home. It is at cellar temps right now. Perfect for most, if not all beers. The flavor is incredible. Never mind the bubbles, the flavors are that of a typical hefeweizen. I haven’t had one of these overseas yet, but the next time I go over there, I will be sampling one of these. By the way, did you know that Bayerische Staatsbrauerei Weihenstephan is the oldest brewery in the world?  Mouthfeel: There is a ton of carbonation. The beer sits nicely on the tongue, but as you swallow the bubbles really try to force all that flavor to the back half of your palate. The flavor is nice, but the mouthfeel, and I hate bubbles… is acceptable. I wouldn’t want to swish this one around in my mouth… as that wouldn’t give me any more flavor, only create more bubbles… but man, what an enjoyable beer.  Aftertaste: The aftertaste is decent. Nothing to write home about. The ABV is also pretty low, and what aftertaste I get is subtle, dry, and reminds me of why an orange would match well with this beer. I am not a huge fan of this style, but the hot Arizona summers might change me in a few years. The crisp flavor a beer like this produces will help cool down those hot summer nights nicely.  I am not a huge fan of this style, but I really enjoyed this beer. As my palate changes, I have to keep an open mind on beers that I might not always dig. For example, I HATE Brettanomyces beers… there is just something about that yeast strain that I can’t handle. Not sure of the yeast strain they use here, but man… I could get used to drinking beers like this. Beers like this might even taste better from DAS BOOT!!!

Now I haven’t had enough of the style yet to truly appreciate the differences, but that being said, I can vouch for how good this is. It is amazing.  A – A hazy gold with a perfectly white head of carbonation that rises up to the top of the glass when I pour it but then recedes afterwards. Very little/no lacing.  S – Makes you wanna cry. The smell is just so goddamn wonderful. Clove and banana, bread and a very welcoming yeast with hints of spice as well. AAAHHH, smells so good...also, bit of lemon.  T – A lot more of the nose, just such wonderful flavor, a perfect balance of bitterness and sweetness, great banana and yeast, with other fruity (lemon) and spicy components in the background (maybe a little caramel in here as well, just a dash).  M – The carbonation on this beer is really nice, it provides a luxurious effervescence that tingles across the tongue and down the throat. The body is medium.  O – I love this beer. It will be a beer that I drink for years to come.

S- Extensive amounts of bananas, a bit of lemon and some grassiness along with some spice. This is a real winner here.  T- More lemon and yeast character than the nose lets on, but otherwise follows it. Lots going on with banana and citrus, finishing up with a subtle warming on the way down.  M- Light on the tongue, but that's the way it should be. Very bubbly and refreshing. A certain lasting spiciness brings me to take another sip.

252,731,JCaweinstein,4.38,"Golden colored, cloudy, and with lots of carbonation. I got a two finger creamy and rich looking pure white head. The retention was superb as it lasted till the end. This beer is absolutely stunning in my Weizen glass. Mostly what I smell in the beginning are those fruity ester aromas from the yeast, mainly it's banana. I also detect cereal grain/biscuit that adds a balance to the sweet fruit. I'm also picking up a hint of lemon. Initially I taste some earthy/herbal hop flavors followed by biscuits and and those yeast esters which again remind me of banana. Like the aroma it finishes with a lemon zest. It's medium bodied and is noticeably smooth especially when you consider the level of carbonation. Hops give way to the malts and yeast and finally there is a citrus finish, making this one interesting beer. What a fantastic beer to enjoy while I sit here and watch football. I could see having this in about any scenario or season. The price was great too for the quality of this well known world. Lass beer. I paid 2.99 for a pint. I'll do that again for sure.",Bayerische Staatsbrauerei Weihenstephan,Germany,Hefeweizen,98

One of my favorite beers of all time. Ayinger's hefeweissbier comes close but Weihenstephaner have mastered the hefeweissbier.  Pours a hazy, golden-hued liquid into a weissbier glass. Head is perfect as not too much and not too little. Lacing is light. Smell is light citrus, bright cloves and subtle malt. Mouthfeel is light on carbonation and alcohol. Taste is a brilliant explosion of malt, bready yeast, clove/banana and delicate sweetness. Finish is smoother than water off a duck's back. No bitterness at all. While most weissbiers lean one way or the other on the sweetness scale, Weihenstepher nails the balance perfectly.

They’ll never see this, but I just wanted to mention them!  500 mL bottle poured into a Weihenstephaner weizen glass at fridge temperature.  L – Very hazy deep gold color with an enormous 7-finger white frothy, creamy head. Excellent retention and a little bit of lacing. A little half-finger white frothy cap sits on the surface of the beer all the way down the glass.  S – Bready and grainy wheat, banana, cloves, and a little bit of bubblegum. Smells absolutely fantastic.  T – Follows the nose with a taste that is just as robust as the aroma – something that is difficult to accomplish judging by the small number of beers that have equal tastes and aromas. The beer is sweet all the way through with bready and grainy wheat malt, lots of banana esters, and a little bit of bubblegum. As the taste progresses, yeasty clove spice really picks up. Delicious.  F – Light-to-medium-bodied with great carbonation, a crisp but creamy mouthfeel, and a spicy and pleasantly dry finish. Spicy yeast lingers for a really nice amount of time.  O – This is an absolutely fantastic hefeweizen. It’s easy to see why it’s rated the best. Everything is so nearly perfect for the style that it’s tough to not give this one 5s across the board.

The head is incredible...really tall, just off-white in color, thick, and long lasting. There is pretty significant visible carbonation.  S-The smell is my favorite aspect of this beer. It smells like banana with a touch of lemon and clove for a kicker. A touch of hay and grass keep things from being too sweet. Really nice.  T-Sweet yeast with banana and a touch of lemon/citrus and clove. No real hop character and just a hint of alcohol. Well balanced acidity...no need to muck this one up with a lemon wedge.  M-Lots of carbonation, but very drinkable. Dry on the finish, but never tart.

Lots of pleasent malts, yeast with there clove and bananana aromatics.  Good drinking and easy at that. Bold wheat malts and yeast play a nice match, with banana esters coming through. Even a hint of clove.  On the palette all goes well, smooth and refreshing. It holds it flavor well as it warms, since I think wheats tend to go flat or water out as they warm. It's a lazy rainy day.

Poured into a straight pint glass; I swirled the bottle before the final pour. A deeply hazy, translucent golden-amber hue with effervescent carbonation. Produces a large head of creamy off-white foam that lasts for a few moments before collapsing. Aroma of sweet malt and yeast esters, with notes of banana, clove, bread, faint nutmeg and a mild whiff of alcohol. An initial metallic hint fades away after a little while. An earthy, vinous quality lurks in the background. Complex and superb.  Tastes of sweet malt with a dry, yeasty character. Notes of banana, clove, bread, faint honey and subtle stewed hops. Possesses a mildly tart dryness, as if infused with a hint of lemon. A bone-dry finish; no bitterness to speak of. Mouthfeel is smooth, dry and tingly, with pleasing carbonation and great body. Thick and chewy. Somewhat astringent, with an aftertaste of yeast esters and banana.  Simply put, one of the world's greatest beers. All the characteristics of weissbier are superbly blended together - the yeast esters produce a fantastically balanced flavour and aroma.

A lot of banana and clove, a bit of fruit. Bit of a bread like taste in there as well. Very flavorful beer, a lot going on here.  Excellent mouthfeel, no complaints here.

The taste is light with definite citrus. The only place where this beer lost any points in my book was in carbonation. On-tap it didn't seem overly carbonated but when I had a bottle of it my first pour had a lot of head and seemed about right.

T: Banana and clove, the spice up front throughout the sip, very creamy body, with a medium length finish which leaves banana on the palate.  M: Light carbonation, medium-full body. Milk-like in how creamy the body is.  O: Excellently crafted, an archetype of the style.",Bayerische Staatsbrauerei Weihenstephan,Germany,Hefeweizen,98
252,731,Cyrano41,4.61,"Poured into a Weizen Glass. Dark yellow-orange with lots of head, 2-3 inches! Lots of visible carbonation. Smell was earthy, yeast heavy with very little of the fruit/citrus I expected. Taste was great! The smell made me think the taste would tend toward the bitter but here the fruit came more to the front. It wasn't as sweet as some american versions but very palatable with more hops. I picked this up with no expectations or foreknowledge of the brand. I just knew it was a Hefeweizen I hadn't tried yet. My new benchmark!",Bayerische Staatsbrauerei Weihenstephan,Germany,Hefeweizen,98
252,731,Scrylol,4.47,"Pours a nice golden yellow color, very hazy and cloudy, with a two finger frothy white head that sticks around. Not much lacing.  Smells strongly of bananas and bread. Also has some notes of cloves and slight orange peel smell. Very pleasant.  Lots of bananas and some spiciness on the tongue. Paves way for some bread notes and very low hop bitterness. Slight orange peel taste and some spiciness in the aftertaste.  Good carbonation in the mouthfeel. Nice medium body and had some chewiness into it. Goes down real easy and smooth.  Very nice hefeweizen. Never tasted such strong banana notes before in a beer. Great drinkability and magnificent in the summer. This bottle held up very well despite being two and a half months away from the best before date. I am curious to see how much better it is fresh.",Bayerische Staatsbrauerei Weihenstephan,Germany,Hefeweizen,98

S - Banana, orange and a lot of sweet bubblegum-like scents coming though. A lovely aroma for sure.  T - Follows the nose with some additional flavors: yeast and clove. Makes for a superb drink.  M - Dirnkability is at its finest with this one. A wonderful light-medium body bursting with flavor while remaining tightly tamed. It feels soft and refreshing on the palette. Fantastic.  O - In my opinon the best of the style. Others try to do what this does but are simply caught short. A truly wonderful brew that any enthusiast should seek.",Bayerische Staatsbrauerei Weihenstephan,Germany,Hefeweizen,98

Wonderful aroma of bubblegum, clove, banana, and oranges. This is really what a Hefe should smell like.  The flavor has Lots of banana/bubblegum yeasty esters along with some clove. Everything is fairly well restrained with no single characteristic becoming overpowering. The soft wheat mouthfeel along with fairly high carbonation makes this one refreshing beer.  Overall, one of my favorite Hefe's. Really a benchmark for the style and a beer everyone should try.",Bayerische Staatsbrauerei Weihenstephan,Germany,Hefeweizen,98
252,731,Auraan,5,"Poured a gorgeous cloudy, yeasty golden color with a two finger fluffy white head that receded to a ring of white foam leaving lacing on the glass. An excellent appearance, very true to style. Near flawless. Scents of clove, banana, slight citrus, some wheat malt and a low level of vanilla. A very good aroma profile that hits the style dead-on. Nothing is off, everything is present and it's all fantastic. Very nice. Flavor begins with spicy cloves phenols and a bit of banana esters, moving into more clove phenols but now balanced equally with banana esters and a slight citrus-like sourness. An undertone of cracker-like malt is present throughout the entire sip. Finishes with an equal balance of banana esters and clove phenols, with a slight lemony sourness. Aftertaste is spicy clove phenols and faint banana esters. An excellent flavor profile. The main flavors of the style reveal themselves in full form and several of the optional flavors also come into play. Very well done, balanced and refreshing, perfect. Mouthfeel is light bodied, effervescent with high carbonation and a slightly creamy feel. A very nice, refreshing mouthfeel that is perfectly true to style. Overall this is an amazing hefeweizen. Everything about it is a perfect representation of the style, and this is my number one recommendation to anyone who wants to try a good Bavarian hefeweizen.",Bayerische Staatsbrauerei Weihenstephan,Germany,Hefeweizen,98

When it finally came down, a thin strip of foam remained on the beer's surface. Pale golden colour, slighty hazy. Sweet aroma of bananas and clove, less strong once the foam goes down of course, but still there during the whole drinking time, and quite pleasant. Taste is also just a bit sweet and fruity, with some spices and yeast traces. Rich body and as mach carbonation as needed. Leaves your palate dry.

The taste was light banana, little clove when taken with some of the head. Without taking in the head with a drink, the banana was distinct and complimented well by clove and a wheat-like taste that fills the mouth. It isn't super yeasty. Carbonation and head adds to a splendid mouth-feel.",Bayerische Staatsbrauerei Weihenstephan,Germany,Hefeweizen,98

The bananas are not as big in taste as they are in the nose. A nice malty wheat base is found mid palate. Yeasty and fruity notes are all over this beer. Finishes with cloves and more bananas imparting some sweetness.  Mouthfeel: light bodied beer with moderate carbonation. This beer is really drinkable and also delicate. World class carbonation and mouthfeel!  Overall: This is a tried and proven beer right here. German beer lovers get your hands on this beer. $3 for a 500ml format bottle what a fantastic price for an amazing beer!

The head quickly subsides.  S: Smells of banana, clove and a faint hint of bubble gum. Some citrus and wheaty yeast are also picked up upon further sniffing.  T: What a beauty this is. I get some spicy clove and wheat initially. The citrus and banana work together afterwards and there is a slight taste of bubble gum that comes through at the end/aftertaste. This sets the standards for how hefes should taste.  M: Refreshing. I could easily put down a whole sixer of this on a nice summer day. The drinkability is wonderful and it is a medium-bodied brew.  Overall: Hands down the best hefeweizen in the world. There is no question about it. One of my favorite all time beers and my go-to for the summer months.

Coming from the ""oldest brewery in the world"" it should be no surprise that this beer is crafted to perfection.  I bought this in a ""Beers of the World"" 10-pack from World Market hoping to expand my taste profile. WH was a fantastic surprise find in the box, and I have since bought more individual bottles from my local warehouse.  Immediately upon opening the authentic Bavarian bottle, I smelled the light, sweet wheats and banana complex without having to search for it too hard.  The taste, again, was banana ,the icon of bavarian hefeweissen beer. Their use of it is perfect. It is a highlight of the beer, not the entire taste. There was additional spice notes that provided a strong finish. The entire bottle was great.

Side poured with low vigor into a weizen glass.  Appearance - I love the labeling and the history behind this brewery. Simple, old school, tells you right up front what you are getting. Pours a cloudy straw yellow color with a huge, dominating four finger pillowy head, looks like a cloud on top of the beer. Good lacing. Tons of sediments and carbonation inside the beer make this a top notch presentation.  Smell - Wheats, Breads, a little earthiness, but the primary smell was banana esters for sure. Powerful banana, fruit smell to the beer. Maybe even a little honey sweetness in there as well.  Taste - The heavy banana esters are still the primary favors, with a good secondary pop of cloves and a little spice towards the end as well. The breads and malts round out this beer. Very well put together, a very complete taste experience.  Mouthfeel - It's like eating a loaf of banana bread, drinking this. Big bodied, Thick creamy mouthfeel, big carbonation, excellent smooth finish. Hard to beat.  Overall - if you haven't had it, go get it and drink it. Excellent beer, almost unmatched in its category.

Prominent banana character up front. Bready maltiness behind that along with some clove and other spiciness.  Taste. Starts with a moderate banana flavor and some slight earthyness. A slightly tart and citric flavor cuts this leading to a more clove and spice heavy second half. A low, almost imperceptible level of bitterness is there as well.

I taste the traditional cloves and banana, and a slight bit of citrus (very slight.) Some bread like wheat flavor comes out too. The hop flavor is very mild.  The perfect hefeweizen? Maybe.

Wheat comes through big time but this bottle seems to have a little bit of bitter stale taste to it.  M: Perfect. Sits with a good body and crazy smooth. The bubbles are smooth as well rather than off putting.  This is for sure the best wheat beer I've ever had. Smooth and wheaty and it hits perfect.

The appearance was average, but I must say after pouring this beer into a glass it does leave behind a nice head. What I was most impressed with was the mouthfeel and the unique taste. The mouthfeel was very creamy and smooth, with essentially no bitter points whatsoever. The hoppy smell threw me off a little bit, because there are so many other flavors that strike you prior to the slight hop aftertaste. Above else, cloves were the first thing I could taste. Banana was probably the second most pungent flavor, followed by wheat, yeast, malt, a bit of caramel, and hops. Overall a pretty solid beer.

252,731,thehyperduck,4.57,"500 mL bottle from the LCBO; best before February 22nd 2013. Didn't see this in stores around here until fairly recently, but having heard nothing but praise (and being a fan of hefes in general), I am pretty eager to try this one.  Pours a muddy yellow-brown colour, quite cloudy, topped with nearly three fingers of silky, creamy, sparkling white head. Great retention - the head hangs around for a significant portion of the pint, and leaves behind nice smears of lacing on the glass as it slowly seeps away. Fresh, yeasty aroma with prominent spicy clove notes; leans on the sweet side with lots of pale wheat malt, banana and light citrus zest. Very impressed so far.  I'm in love with this stuff after my first sip - it really is that delicious. Tons of bready wheat malt flavour supported by more of the banana and lemony citrus notes detected in the aroma, with a gentle clove spiciness in the background. Malty, yeasty aftertaste with a faint hint of clove that lingers. Medium-bodied, and a silky, prickly mouthfeel with the perfect amount of carbonation for a hefe. A bit chewy, with a slick coating left behind on the palate after swallowing. As drinkable as mana from heaven, but I'd rather savour it than slug it back.  Final Grade: 4.57, a nearly-perfect A+ grade. I am completely blown away by this - I've heard it was good, but that is an understatement because it's utterly incredible. Usually I can find at least one thing to criticize no matter how much I like a beer, but this is virtually perfect from my point of view: the golden standard of hefes.  [Updated Feb. 18 2014]  I picked up another bottle, primarily to compare this one side-by-side with some other German hefes (Schneider-Weisse, Erdinger, and Paulaner). Weihenstephaner Hefeweissbier remains one of my favourite wheat beers of all time, and it is easily my favourite hefeweizen - unbelievably drinkable, absurdly smooth and delicious as hell. The only problem with this beer is that it's not as widely-distributed/reliably available as the other three in these parts... but I can't say I'm surprised, as this is a world-class beer that people should be buying by the armful.

Not too many bubbles but an overwhelming head on the pour which rose to just under two fingers length.  Smell: Light orange with a mix of banana, light malts.  Taste: Really complex and built for perfection. I mean this beer is packing punch when it comes to flavor, light banana, slight sweet citrus and after taste of malts.  Mouth: As good as it gets when it comes to a any hefeweizen, this beer is so smooth.  Overall: The truth is this beer is my favorite (and should be yours as well) Hefeweizen, With rich flavors and full-filling taste it would be harder to please any more.

252,731,zeledonia,4.28,"Enjoyed 21 May 2012, reviewed from notes. Bottle say 0315. I think this translates to bottled on the day ending in 0 (30) of 35th week of year, 2011, which would be 30 August 2011.  Pours a gorgeous cloudy pale golden wheaty yellow. Massive 3-finger white head, super fluffy and dense, with amazing sticky lacing. Unsurpassed in this department.  Smell is buoyantly yeasty, full of banana, with some spice and nice crisp noble hops. Smells delicious. Starts out full and fruity, then relaxes into a crisp, dry, wheaty-yeasty yumminess.  Taste initially strikes me as bland. Quite wheaty, but the yeast doesn't show up as much here. A decent amount of banana on the back end. But overall, it's dominated by those herbal noble hops. I want more spice!  Feels light-bodied, but full in the mouth. Good carbonation, finishes pretty dry with just a bit of water lingering in the mouth.  Smells and looks better than it tastes. Which is unfortunate, because it smells fantastic.",Bayerische Staatsbrauerei Weihenstephan,Germany,Hefeweizen,98

When this brewery was founded in 1040 AD, I wonder if the very first brewmaster expected it would still be around nearly 1,000 years later. But with the cloudy, heady pale yellow pour leading up to a tremendous aroma of pale malts, banana, clove, and yeast, I can imagine how an 11th Century beer drinker must have been refreshed on a warm medieval day. The light body is satisfying for the style. There is a slight zing of citrus goodness in the taste with the same flavor sensations that were introduced by way of the nose. It finishes clean and easy. The original is still one of the best in the world.",Bayerische Staatsbrauerei Weihenstephan,Germany,Hefeweizen,98

Maybe it's seeing it in the Weihenstephan glass, but this beer looks fantastic. Smell is awesome as well, perfect hefeweizen aroma of banana and clove. Flavor follows the nose, this pretty much epitomizes what a hefeweizen should be. Mouthfeel is light-bodied with nice carbonation. Overall, this is probably the best year-round, easy-to-get hefe in existence. It's a great beer for a hot day, and very refreshing. The only things that hold this back from a higher score are that 1) hefeweizens aren't my favorite style and 2) it's not quite on the level of my two favorite hefes, the Andechs and the Live Oak.",Bayerische Staatsbrauerei Weihenstephan,Germany,Hefeweizen,98

Hazy yellow-orange with a dollop of cream-white head. Excellent retention. Good look. 4.0  Wet banana, smoky clove, herbal German hop zing, and light lemon peel. There's a light caramel note to the malt that's delightful. 4.0  Very pleasing firm banana, clove, lemon, tart orange, wheaty grain, light caramel syrup, hint of pear flesh, and Noble hops. There's a lot of clove in the back of the throat in the finish. Nice citrusy notes. No one element steals the show. 4.5  Pretty much a perfect mouthfeel. Creamy, but juicy. A little tart, working as an aperitif. Mild-to-medium carb that does its job for the style. Rich, yet quenching. 5.0  An epic hefe. Not sure if I prefer this one over the Schneider Edel-Weisse, but it's ALWAYS been damn tasty. Even better on-tap.

This beer smells great and has a strong aroma; can smell it almost a foot away from the glass. Strong aromas of lemon zest, bananas, and orange.  Taste is similar to the smell with a banana flavor up front and a lemony aftertaste. Is a very carbonated beer that has great mouthfeel; a light feeling beer that is full of flavor.  Overall this is a great beer, would really be good outside on a summer day. I don't drink this style much but will be picking up more as the weather gets nicer.

The yeast isn’t as prominent as other wheat beers I’ve had.  M: Refreshing...drinkability through the roof. Give me this beer during Octoberfest all day/any day. Nicely crisp and easy drinking without being dry and astringent. Smooth as Billy Dee Williams. Light-to-medium body, high carb and soft finish.

Leaves a thick layer of lacing all over the glass once it finally recedes.  S: Very fruity. Smells like bubblegum initially. I get some pear, lemons and maybe banana. Some wheat and a little bread in there too. Touch of spice, black pepper I'd say. Maybe a hint of grass somewhere in there. Very light, crisp and refreshing aroma.

When I went through a German phase about 16-17 years ago, this stood out in my memory, and I was not disappointed when I picked this up again for the first time in years.  Pours almost clear straw and golden yellow, with a huge fluffy pure white head that leaves chunky lacing and caps the beer until I swallow the last of it.  Smell is lemony, yeasty, light bready malts.  Taste is clean dry malts, pure, a hint of the yeast, and some lemon in the aftertaste.  Feel is smooth, flowing, light bodied, and probably the easiest drinking beer ever!  While it doesn't have the punch of the bigger beers, this is just special. Balanced and drinkable.

Wonderful taste, reminiscent of the smell.  M: exceptionally smooth, mild carbonation  O: Brings back great memories of my time in Germany. An excellent hefe from an historic brewery.

Well, it was fine, but... I don't get all the crazy praise for it. It was good but didn't do much more for me than other hefes, which I'm starting to have my doubts about. I'm wondering if the style is a narrow one, in which the differences between different offerings are small. If you served this to me I'd be happy enough, but rather than buy it again I'd rather explore other untried options. I will say it had a very pretty snowy white head.

No bitterness and a hint of the sweet malt right before the carbonation takes over and bubbles on the tongue. The clove flavor is very present but balanced with the other flavors. Totally took me by surprise, great tasting beer!  The mouthfeel is crisp in the front and carbonated at the end, but a great carbonated. Not like the negative soda-like carbonation, but it is strong.  I am not a beer master, but I have had my fair share (much more than I have had a chance to review for this site) and the flavor of this beer is phenomenal. I bought it from Atlantic Liquors in Rehoboth Beach, Delaware (funny website, ridiculous store) not knowing what a reputation it had!

Mild to moderate strength and inviting.  T - The spice notes created by the yeast are awesome, and they blend wonderfully with the spicy wheat body. Light floral hops notes are present as well. It's a little mellow for my tastes, though I think it's probably ideal for the style. I get orange, clove, and coriander. It could benefit from a bit more depth, though whats there is very good.

Smell - Beautiful rip banana, augmented by fair amount of clove notes. The aroma is intoxicating.  Taste - Begins with a prominent clove spice which lasts to the finish. Notes of banana, wheat and a bit of bubblegum-like yeast. Flavors do well to separate, each hitting their stride at different times. Finishes with the aforementioned clove, fading well into the aftertaste.  Mouthfeel - This has a light body, bit just a touch watery on the back end. Decently carbonated, leading to a crisp, sharp bite.  Overall - Oh goodness. This is one hell of a hefeweizen.

Complex but enjoyable.  M- Some what thick. It is thicker than I expected. I can describe it maybe as ""creamy"". Carbonation is not overwhelming. Feels full bodied, but on the low end of full.

252,731,JohnnyHopps,4.45,"This beer is pure magic, making me ashamed that it took me so long to try it.  Poured into a pint glass, the beer gave a lemon aroma. I was expecting a sweeter aroma for a hefeweiss, so a tart aroma was somewhat of a surprise. For a hefeweiss, it radiated the expected golden staw color while producing the expected white head. The initial taste makes very apparent an appealing banana yeast flavor. It is sweet, but not overpoweringly sweet. The carbonation could be described as sharp, perhaps even aggressive. It brought to mind the bubbles of champagne. The bubbles nicely sweet away the initial taste to reveal the next level. The aftertaste brought a mild honey flavor with a hint of the spiciness of pepper.  This is one highly regarded beer that is easily available to most people. The price of a bottle makes it look even better compared to a lot of beers.",Bayerische Staatsbrauerei Weihenstephan,Germany,Hefeweizen,98

Nice clove presence, with hints of banana in the background. Then there was a pervasive wheat twang that I didnt like all too much.  The taste is dominated by clove all the way. Full body feel from the yeast, but its really all a facade. The mainly clove followed by hints of banana subside, and leave all the clean finish to come through.

252,731,DM1293,4.45,"Taste - Franziskaner is my favorite Hefeweizen. This? Is almost identical, but two things make it different. One, is that its much more flavorful. Franziskaner is a little lighter in body comparably. Second, is that, to me, if I let it sit on my palate, it brought forth the banana note. That was really kind of cool how the flavor became more pronounced.  Overall - Its all about preference. This has all the characteristics of a great hefeweizen, its still relatively easy-drinking; but its a bit more fuller and bolder in taste, and that makes this great in its own way.

In one word, refreshing  Taste = alot like the nose , but it hits you in waves as it spreads on the tongue.

It is a very cloudy yellow to gold (more yellow towards the bottom and gold in the middle top).  Smell: Banana-y bread. Also some clove as I would expect, and even the possibility of a rose smell among others (my nose isn't the best however). Awesome.  Taste: Crisp wheat flavors. Very bready and malty with banana and clove flavors that do not overwhelm as they do in so many others in the style. There are also citrus notes and just the slightest tinge of tanginess. The great balance in this makes it superior to any Hefeweizen I have ever had and probably will ever have.  Mouthfeel: Smooth and kind of thin. Mouth coating with a thick layer of amazing crispness. Again, a great part of a great beer.  Overall: This is a stellar beer that surpasses anything I have had in the style and maybe from the country itself. Not my favorite beer ever, but within its style, I see no way that they could improve it.",Bayerische Staatsbrauerei Weihenstephan,Germany,Hefeweizen,98

Soft malty aftertaste. Took a big manly gulp and got a momentary wash of cloves. Slightly champagney, even reminiscent of Duvel. Fantastic head retention. Very lively on the tongue, lovely.  Overall: This got me onto Weissbiers but I've tried loads since then and this is pretty unremarkable compared to a lot of others.

Poured it into a new Paulaner hefe glass (also purchased at Tanakaya), and enjoyed enjoyed enjoyed! The head on this is ridiculously amazing, delicious and long-lasting, lacing the glass like a frappe. Loved watching all the particles float around in the glass, heightening the smell of orange and wheat and the taste of the same. The only thing I could ask for is a bit thicker of a brew just to give my tongue something else to play with.

252,731,cmq103,4.47,"Poured from a 500 ml. bottle into a Duvel Belgian Tulip glass.  Appearance: A semi-aggressive pour yielded a fluffy off-white 2” head, reducing to a thin ring. Lacing was clearly present, sticking to the side of my glass indicating the original head height. This beer poured golden yellow in color with definitive murkiness to it.  Smell: The classic Hefeweizen banana and yeasty aroma shines through, with a zesty citrus wheat finish. Clove is also present with a honey-like sweetness.  Taste: I can see why this beer rates so high among the Hefeweizens on the market. Banana dominates, with spicy wheat malts, honey, coriander, cloves and hint of lemon zing too. What a wonderful combination of flavors on the palate.  Mouthfeel: Light to moderate body with lively carbonation makes this an easy drinking beer. Very smooth, creamy and balanced on the tongue.  Overall: Outstanding Hefeweizen in every single category. This beer, by far, ranks up there at the top of its class. At only 5.4% ABV, this makes for the perfect flavorful all-year-round session beer. I can imagine this being quite the quencher during the summer months but if I’m being totally honest, I’m enjoying the heck out of this in the middle of February.

T: Rich creamy head to a bread malt backbone that is sweet as well as clovey. I enjoy the banana esters as well as the beer finishes. I am such a fan of the tastes as they are balances and well thought out.  M: Perfect to style. Medium bodied. But light in complexity. Crisp enough to fend of stylish fish dishes but delicate enough to be overpowered with spices.  O: This is another fantastic German Wit. I am biased because this is one of my favorite styles but this is a great drinking beer. The German subtitles and balance really make me excited in comparison to the Belgian strength and extremes.

Slightly clear straw yellow gets hit with the yeast and clouds up nicely, final color is a hazy yellow/orange. Head goes down to a skim a bit too quickly to be perfect. Smell is pure weizen yeast: banana, cloves and some dry wheat. Man is this beer aromatic. Taste has tons of yeast complexity and some clove spiciness, hint of sweet from the malt. Mouthfeel has some dryness due to the wheat, light bodied and very high carb, carb even teases the mouth.  Hands down the best hefeweizen, the Germans invented the style and they sure do know how to make em. The only American hefe that comes close is SN's Kellerweiss. Light bodied and full of flavor with none of the off tastes that inferior beers of the style so often have. I feel pity for the person who lets blue moon be the beginning and end of their foray into wheat beers. If the head had held up better and the smells had hit harder this would be a perfect beer.

Wheat, citrus, pepper, and a little banana. I could keep sniffing this all day, but for the urge to drink.  T: Wheat is there, but no malty sweetness. A little citrus tartness, but less than the smell would indicate. The bitterness in the finish was potent, but not in a bad way.  M: A bit dry, with average carbonation for the style.  O: Very good. I can see why the brewery has been around for nearly a thousand years. I was a little disappointed that the taste didn't live up to the aroma. I'd drink another anytime, but given the choice, I'd go with Paulaner for a Hefewiezen.  On a side note, it's interesting that this brewer of a wheat beer makes the claim, ""brewed under the purity law of 1516"" when wheat was specifically forbidden by that law (but I guess it sounds better for marketing than saying, ""brewed under the provisional German beer law of 1993"")",Bayerische Staatsbrauerei Weihenstephan,Germany,Hefeweizen,98

Brewed in Bavaria, Germany, Weihenstephan's label states that it's the oldest brewery in the world. Records date back to the year 768 with documents mentioning a hop garden, but the brewery was officially licensed in 1040.  The 17oz bottle pours at a clear burnt-amber color, with a nice thick ivory white foam on top. The foam lingers for several minutes, and leaves behind a mild lacing as it recedes. The aromas are bright and distinct, with plenty of lemon, orange peel, banana, and spices. I absolutely love the aromas on this little Hefeweiss!  On the palate, the Weihenstephaner is flavorful and complex, yet so incredible easy to drink! The citrus and banana is right up front in my mouth, but not far behind is the spice and just a touch of alcohol.

252,731,Blargimus,3.83,"500 ml bottle poured into pilsener glass. Did not see date on bottle. It's possible this is old, since it's from a shop without a particularly high rate of turnover.  Pours a slightly hazy straw color, with an enormous amount of white head. Seriously, I poured down the side of the glass slowly, and it's still about 90% head to start off. It takes some time to come down enough to add more beer, and remain highly effervescent. Leaves some slight lacing on the side of the glass, and a few mm of head is left on the surface.  Smells like a classic hefe. Not as much banana as others. Mostly yeast, with some citrus and wheat with only a hint of cloves.  The taste mirrors the smell very closely - very yeasty. The wheat is only in the aftertaste, it seems. While it's very good, and has good balance overall, I'd like a little more banana and a little less yeast.  Medium body and quite creamy from the carbonation. Light enough to be very refreshing, but not special.  Overall it's a very good hefe. I'm not sure I would consider it the 44th best beer in the world, and in the style I like Dry Dock Hefe more.

This is what I think of when I think Hefeweizens.  T: This is an interesting and complex taste, unlike the nose, on my first sip the cloves invite me in then tempt me with a small amount of banana flavor and then more cloves, and finishes with a bready malt flavor that makes you wanting more.

Just the right amount of carbonation with a very clean balanced alcohol finish. All in all, the beer is the prototype for other Hefeweizen makers to follow. This said, one should expect no less from a beer traditions that dates back to 1040. Enjoy!!  Glass = Tulip.  Drink Temp. = 48 F.

Thick lacing clings around the glass as well, incredible. Aromas of big banana, clove, bubblegum, pepper, lemon, and spicy yeast. Fantastic aromas here with great balance and strength. Taste of big clove, pepper, banana, bubblegum, lemon, bread, and spicy yeast. Light bitterness on the finish that lingers with citrus, pepper, banana, and spices for a bit. Extremely smooth and slightly creamy medium sized body. Fairly lively carbonation that dies down as I make my way through the glass. Extremely well balanced with the flavor profile as well.

Towering 7 finger thick white head off the first pour. It settled slowly, allowing the beer to warm. Some of the thickest lacing I've ever seen. Carbonation bubbles rise non-stop throughout the beer.  Aroma of sweet banana, citrus and spice (heavy on the clove). Toasted wheat.  Taste of banana and cloves with tart citrus and light toasted malt. Light earthiness.  Rather thick, but silky smooth and creamy. Peppery with warmth in the throat. lightly cloying.

The aroma is faint, but one can just detect water and a little bread. Taste is of banana, white wheat bread, coriander or cloves (hard to say which), and water, plus, maybe cinnamon. The body is on the watery side, and Weihenstephaner Hefe Weissbier finishes easy-drinking and wet.

So I decided to see how an ancient beer has stood up to the test of time.  Appearance - A beautiful amber/brown color. Very carbonated and a great mix of browns.  Smell - A tart almost crisp smell. Some may find it too tart, but excellent along with the taste  Taste - Wheaty with a mix of fruit. The main one I pick up is fresh peaches and a slice of pear. Now this isn't a fruity beer, but has a great fruit finish.  Mouthfeel - Carbonation Perfection!

Look - light amber color, clear, with good carbonation and about three fingers' worth of off-tan colored foam that dissipates fairly slowly.  Smell - very sweet and malty, with not much of a hop presence, but very much of a wheat-like presence.  Taste - right away the wheat makes itself known. It very much does indeed remind me of Bavarian beers in general. The banana flavor is pretty prominent. Quite well on the sweet side, with no bitterness.  Mouthfeel - pretty well balanced, but leans a little more on the watery side.

Poured a beautiful dark honey/golden straw with plenty of haze and a 3 finger pillow white head that faded to 1 finger thorughout the beer. Lacing was spectacular and when poured into a weizen glass it stands out. Smell was very complex with notes of banana, cloves, lemon and bread. Not too strong, but adequate. Taste was fantastic. Follows the nose pretty close, but adds a hint of spices to balance the citrus/fruit on the front end. Classic for the style and spot on. Feel was a good bit of carbonation with a dry ending. Not too watery, but not overpowering. Overall- Not sure I can come up with anything new to say about this that hasn't already been said. This is the gold standard of a Hefeweizen IMO and easily in my top 5 all time brews. While I think nothing is perfect, this comes damn close.

Settles in the glass looking like cloudy, unfiltered goodness topped by a crown of foamy head. Very attractive.  S: Spicy, medicinal notes grace the nose with heaps of clove and banana. The aroma is rather pronounced and carries pretty far from the glass.  T: This beer nails the art of the hefeweizen with perfect form. Starts with assertive, yeasty spiciness dashed with generous amounts of well balanced clove notes and touches of banana bread. Finishes very clean, much like eating a sliver of ginger root. Intensely refreshing - I couldn't ask for more.  M: Prickly carbonation, lighter bodied, with a well-executed semi-dry finish. Rather slick on the palate going down, leaves a pleasant mark as the flavors flee the tongue.  O: What hasn't already been said about this beer?

That being said:  A: I always love the crisp look of this beer, its golden aura just stands light years away from other ""Yellow Water"" beers (i.e.: Budweiser, Miller, etc). The head...well, it just doesnt want to go away. It is creamy, thick and most of all likes hanging around. Threw this one into a weizen glass and the head combined with the pale, crisp color and the crazy storm of carbonation (at the onset anyway) just pales in comparison to most other Hefe's. The only downside is that you can just see the bubbles start dying or slowing down and its just...sad.  S: citrusy, fruity, like it should pretty much lol. Good smell  T: great taste, its refreshing, cleanses the palate and just prepares you for another sip. Its as if this just gets better after every sip. Or it could be that i'm biased since its my first one for the past year and its just delicious :)  M: Invigorating and cleansing. You can just imagine eating some sort of flavorful dish and this would be the type of beer that just washes the taste away and leaves your tastebuds awaiting more.  O: Solid, Solid beer. I cant go as far as saying that i love it, as I am a Dubbel kinda guy, but this is just a great, overall beer. Anytime i have company over, i get this, or if its a BYOB thing (so i dont show up others by coming in with a corked bottle of some Trappist and looking like a snobby, a-hole) but i'll bring this.

It just doesn't get much better than this. Franziskaner has been my favorite Hefe for years, but this one just might have surpassed that as of late. It's at least tied for first.

It’s not all that different in either iteration; I may actually enjoy this one a bit more from the bottle. Hazy light orange color. Huge fluffy white head that falls slowly with excellent lacing. Aroma is full of wheat and yeast, lots of the expected banana and clove notes, perhaps a bit lemony with some traces of coriander.  The flavor is incomparable for the style: very pronounced bananas and cloves, lightly toasted malt, very low bitterness without much of a noticeable hop presence. A touch of sweetness.

The nose is big wheat with suggestions of clove and banana. A touch of lemon. The taste is big wheat and present, but subdued clove and banana and lemon zing. Not the crazy amount of clove that sometimes comes out of these beers, nor a banana bomb. A bit sweeter and not as lemon/peppery than a lot of saisons and not as soda-like in the body, but not as sweet as a lot of Hefes. Really nice, easy drinking, balanced brew.

Mouth is crisp with light carbonation, a light body and an average to long finish.  Overall I didn't enjoy this, but that doesn't mean it's not good beer.

A beautiful beer, hazy golden/orange with a rocky, very German, head. I love German foam! The head slowely sinks into itself leaving a rocky landscape in the glass. Lots of carbonation.  Woah! This smells fruity! Banana, mango, pine and indeed clove (I smelled real clove a little earlier). Grainy and some hops.  (Just had spicey food.) Taste is grainy (wheat) and sweet.

S - Spice, clove, banana, wheat, the aroma was more pronounced than the Franziskaner I compared it with.  T - Wow, just fantastic. Wheaty and really complex. More complex than the nose lets on but with all the same sort of flavor profiles.  M - Exactly what youd expect. Palate coating and almost heavy on the tongue which was unexpected but enjoyable. The carbonation really cleanses your palate.  O - I must say I enjoyed this one just slightly better than the Franziskaner I had side by side with them.

It was very well balanced and easily drinkable, but nothing I would grab again.",Bayerische Staatsbrauerei Weihenstephan,Germany,Hefeweizen,98
252,731,ehammond1,4.57,"Bottle (2011)  Super Junior Market San Diego, CA  Just barely hazy golden yellow, orange, and amber with a huge, thick, persistent white head. This beer wasn't nearly as cloudy and hazy as others I've had within style. Spots of lace down the glass.  A powerful aroma of banana, perhaps some apple and pear, clove, and wheat. The best smelling hefeweizen I've ever come across.  Flavor is incredibly similar to the aroma: lots of banana and clove, low bitterness, a bit of white fruit, wheat, and bread. Fantastic!  Light to medium bodied--incredibly drinkable. This beer wants you to drink more and more of it.  I couldn't even imagine a better hefeweizen.",Bayerische Staatsbrauerei Weihenstephan,Germany,Hefeweizen,98
252,731,MrVonzipper,4.53,"Clear,with just a touch of haziness, golden orange with a large 1 1/2 finger frothy eggshell colored head with excellent retention and mild lacing.  Big earthy and fresh nose with lots of sweet banana, smooth wheatiness and a little bready yeast.  Great flavor burst right off the bat. Same notes as the nose with nice notes of banana, wheat and a little bready. Great balance and a nice and pleasant clean aftertaste.  Light bodied with zesty high carbonation that is just perfect for this beer.  Overall just an outstanding all around hef. Definitely my favorite of the style.",Bayerische Staatsbrauerei Weihenstephan,Germany,Hefeweizen,98
252,731,ryan1788a5,4.25,"1pt .9oz bottle properly poured into a weizen glass.  A: Cloudy, deep golden in color. Almost orange at its core. Frothy, creamy white head has great retention, as expected. Clumps of sticky lacing are prevalent.  S: Heavy phenols: lots of clove. Over-ripe bananas, bready wheat, powdery yeast.  T: Tastes of banana bread and over-ripe bananas are interrupted by clove and spices. Big dose of wheat. Bready with a touch of that acidity and citrus-like tastes that tend to come with wheat beers. Yeast plays a major role, contributing a mildly chalky and slightly funky taste. Dries a bit toward the finish and the malt tastes turn cracker-like.  M: Very light in body, very fluffy and creamy in the mouth. Lots of aggressive, small-bubbled carbonation, as expected.  O: An excellent beer, maybe the best of the style.  Notes: I am fortunate enough to have this beer frequently available fresh on tap at several bars in the area. It is always excellent, an easy A+ and one of my personal favorite beers. This is my second time having it out of the bottle, and the edge seems to be taken off of it just a bit. I suspect this is due to the rigors of trans-Atlantic shipping, or maybe it isn't quite as fresh as it could be (no bottled-on dates).",Bayerische Staatsbrauerei Weihenstephan,Germany,Hefeweizen,98

A - I vaguely cloudy yellow liquid with a white head. Carbonated bubbles are not visible.  S - Barley malt, some lemon, not so special and / or fresh.  T - For a wheat beer it is nice and mild flavor, slightly acid with light lemon tones. Not really bitter and quite dry.  M - The carbonation is medium with a slight bitterness in the finish.

T: The flavors are more subtle than I expected from the nose. Yeast is the dominant flavor but it does not completely overpower the banana in the background. Lemongrass lingers on the tongue to create a crisp finish. M: The mouthfeel is creamy and full with fairly pronounced carbonation. O: This is an enjoyable brew and I can see how it has become an icon of the style. I'm not a huge hefeweizen fan, but this is a great representative of the style and I'm sure I will find myself returning to this beer when the situation calls for it.",Bayerische Staatsbrauerei Weihenstephan,Germany,Hefeweizen,98

Getting into the nose I pick up the requisite banana, clove and yeast. Maybe a piece of bubble gum. Taste is on par with the nose and all anyone can really ask for. Banana and clove balance nicely and the yeast lends a nice background for those flavors to work on. Creamy in the mouth with ample carbonation make for a refreshing brew.

Appearance: Hazy dark straw gold beer, with a nice cream-colored cap which, surprisingly, fades a bit fast for my liking.  Smell: Requisite sweet/tart banana aromas, with plenty of spice in the background. A couple of swirls really brings out the spice aromas. Very slight hint of citrus in the background, as well as something nicely floral as this warms a bit.  Taste: Banana and sweet spice (no particular baking spice is coming out here, though I think perhaps I get a slight hint of clove). Slightly tangy wheat backbone, with light, if firm bitterness. All in all, it's a bit like banana bread, though w/out the typical caramelly/burnt sugar notes that confection often (though not always) has.  Mouthfeel: Spritzy and refreshing  Overall: A really tasty Hefeweizen. Is it the world's best, like I once thought? I don't know, though it's certainly top-tier. I do have to say, however, that it's no longer quite my favorite. Overall, however, certainly a tasty offering.",Bayerische Staatsbrauerei Weihenstephan,Germany,Hefeweizen,98

S - Bready yeasts, lemon, pepper, bubblegum, banana, in order of strength. The bready yeasts, lemon and pepper are the most dominant by far while the others are in the background.  T - Pretty much reverse the dominant flavors from the smells. Bubblegum, banana, lemon, pepper, then the yeasts. Sweet malts show as well with a nice tart overall taste.  M - Thin to medium bodied, good level of carbonation. Finish is slightly drying with that tart taste staying around for a while. When that fades, you're left with the sweet malts sticking to the inside of your mouth.

252,731,2xHops,4.38,"I decided to open my bottle of Hefewissbier after having a hefeweizen by Ranger Creek Brewery. (based out of San Antonio) I'd have to say my suspicions were accurate. This hefeweizen by Weihenstephaner definitely blows out a lot of other examples by a wide margin.  The beer has a wonderful unfiltered appearance without being too dark like the Ranger Creek one. The foam rose nicely and it subsided fairly slowly. The taste is the most critical component. The last thing I want is to have a hefeweizen taste musty, stagnant, or just plain old. This beer doesn't do that. It had plenty of citrus notes, but it wasn't overly powering nor syrupy to a point where it does taste old.  The beer was easy on my plalate,a nd it actually felt refreshing in my mouth. It was not too syrupy, thick, nor too thin.  Overall, it's a truly great example of hefeweizen, and it's definitely easy to drink. I have to admit, I actually preferred the Kristall Weissbier, but this one is just too dang good.",Bayerische Staatsbrauerei Weihenstephan,Germany,Hefeweizen,98

These aromas appear in the taste, along with clove, allspice, apple juice and wheat.  Light body; crisp with slightly aggressive carbonation.

Now, onto the review:  A: golden cloudy body with a three finger foamy and puffy white head. Looks delicious. Some bubbles rise up to the head in the body. Decent retention and some lacing is present.  S: this beer welcomes you with a very nice banana aroma along with wheat and yeast with some sweet notes. Some citrus present as well. Complex but excellent.  T: follows the nose for the most part with a nice introductory banana taste and then turns into a solid wheat flavor. Ends with a touch of citrus and spicyness. In a way, this taste is typical of a lot of the German Hefes but this beer does its job incredibly well...yum!  M: medium body, medium carbonation, very smooth while drinking it.  O: one of the best Hefes out there, I highly recommend this beer. In fact, it's one of my favorite beers and it's a regular on my fridge because it's THAT good. Excellent presentation, the appearance and the smell alone make your mouth water and invite you palate to drink it and once you do it you're left with a complex, yet pleasant, combination of flavors and aromas that leave wanting for more.",Bayerische Staatsbrauerei Weihenstephan,Germany,Hefeweizen,98

More understated in the clove department than I remembered. Pretty much reference quality for the style.  T - Taste has a bit more clove, unmalted wheat, some pale malt sweetness, yeast and bread, and a bit of banana in the periphery.  M - Grainy medium body, pleasant carbonation, lightly sticky finish, clean aftertaste. Pretty refreshing stuff.  D - It's a classic, reference-quality hefeweizen.

Tasted in lineup next to Franziskaner. This proved the superior beer in every way (though only slightly better in each category). So I apologize about including some comparisons, but I find that is a really good way to truly appreciate the quality and differences of two of the best German hefeweizens.  Poured with that supremely impressive huge head fading to a pretty good lace. Medium straw hue with lighter highlights, lighter than Franziskaner, more head, less sticky lace.  Intensely aromatic, stunning really. Lots of banana and clove, a myriad of baking spice, fresh hay, a grainy wheat note, oodles of citrus, mostly meyer lemon and orange peel, some hints of white flowers.  Palate explodes with flavor, this is where this beer really shines compared to tasting from tap a couple of weeks ago. The bottled version seems to have a purity of flavor and crisp, fresh notes. Really nice banana, clove, nutmeg with a grassy note, some really enjoyable cereal/grain notes, and a really delicate backing of lemon zest/ lemon grass. Superb. Lots going on.  Very good body and texture, decent grip, finish is medium long and alcohol is in check. Fine carbonation. Nearly perfect balance.  Overall this is a stunning beer which comes as close to perfection as one could hope for in a hefeweizen. So note my superbly high marks and realize that I am comparing this to every other hefeweizen that I have ever tried and that this beats up on.

Very similar to the nose with the semi-sweet banana fruity flavors up front and some sugarless bubble gum sweetness in the back there. Subtle hints of spices like coriander and cloves, as well as that nice yeasty bread like quality. Very clean and well put together.  Smooth with light carbonation on the tongue.

Unrelenting head retention. Spotty lacing for a while, but doesn't stick for the whole time.  S - Best smelling hefe I've had for sure. Tons of wheat, bread, and yeast. Lots of citrus notes as well here. Obvious orange, coriander, lemon zest, banana, peach, and a touch of apricot. A hint of honey and vanilla sweetness. A bit of barley malt and light grains as well. Complex and inviting.  T - Tons of yeasty and grainy bread flavors. Wheat and banana are strong as well, but the citric quality I had anticipated is much more muted than the smell had hinted at. Notes of coriander and orange linger around the palate, the don't come through like I had hoped they would. Distinct vanilla sweetness is also present, although subtle. My sample at the Calgary Beer Festival seemed to feel a little more dark, with more emphasis apricot and peaches. I also taste an unmistakable metallic flavor. As it warms, cloves and spices become more evident, especially in the finish.  M - The carbonation sparkles lightly throughout the experience, and is delivered in a medium bodied hefe with a slightly dry, yeasty finish.  D - I've tried a few hefeweizens now, and this one is by far the most enjoyable. Complex aromatic and flavor qualities, with a nice presentation and appearance. The problem I run into with most hefes is a lager-like graininess that just kills the flavor profile for me, but this one keeps those grainy malts in check and delivers and well-rounded and balanced flavor that is thoroughly enjoyable.

252,731,TheBrewo,4.3,"This brew was served from the tap at The Old Toad in Rochester, NY. It arrived in a 17 oz. Hefeweizen glass and boasted a golden-tawny color. It held three fingers worth of soft white head over a hazy brew. No other sediment was noted, and carbonation appeared minimal. The aroma popped bright vanillas, coriander and pumpkin spice, faint orange peel, thick wheaty grain and a huge phenolic clove character. The latter became enhanced with warmth, where booze also began to seep out. Additionally, there was a more pronounced sweetness, with strawberry inclusions. As we sipped, the flavors opened up with a strong wheat character. This was given with equally strong phenols and cloves, with a soft and sugary balance from banana esters. The middle moved on with slightly more bittered grain and a lactic sourness. To finish we were given more of those big clovey phenols, spice of coriander, bitter citrus rind, and a wash of grain. The end also showed a slight bitterness of soft alcohol, which was unexpected due to the lower abv. The aftertaste breathed with bubblegum esters, banana sweetness, cooling wheat, and lighter cloves. The body was heavenly light and the carbonation was medium. The creaminess to each sip was absurd, with a huge slurp and smack. The feel remained soft and eternally coating throughout. The abv was appropriate and the beer had great drinkability.  Overall, what we enjoyed most about this brew was the mouthfeel. This was near on perfect, and a great complement to a hot day. Another huge bonus was in the spicy flavors included in both the nose and taste. This brew is exemplary for the style, and extraordinarily refreshing.",Bayerische Staatsbrauerei Weihenstephan,Germany,Hefeweizen,98
252,731,paperbackfoster,4.83,"A - Rare is it that I find carbonation like this. Even a careful pour produced a three finger head, which lingered at two and dissipated to what was still a very solid one/one and a half finger. Big thicks of clumpy foam - the stereotypical, easily cartooned German beer. Color is a darker shade of gold, very much like wheat itself. Low translucence makes body carbonation hard to perceive.  S - Banana, clove, a touch of citrus, and light, wheaty malts. The quintessential hefeweizen.  T - Very much the same as the nose. Light bready notes and very neutral hopping carry the flavors of ripe banana and warm clove with other spices.  M - Full-bodied, nearly creamy (especially for the style), but extremely refreshing.  O - It feels almost silly to review this beer. For the lovers of hefes, it's the peak of the style. For those that normally don't enjoy a hefe, this is the beer that could change their mind. I'm not even that much of a fanboy, only picking one up in a mixer sixer every now and again to visit it like an old friend. It's just a recognizably outstanding beer, a grandfather of so many to follow.",Bayerische Staatsbrauerei Weihenstephan,Germany,Hefeweizen,98
252,731,aeolianshredhead,4.88,"Pours a beautiful, musky orange/amber colour with an enormous head which retains brilliantly. Utterly perfect-looking. Worthy of framing.  T- Luscious sweetness retains well over the palate. Perfectly balanced and utterly delicious. There is definitely that clove/coriander taste upfront with a lovely array of subtle flavours following. Some faint sweet grain carries this fantastic beer out.  S- Exciting smell! It smells like a normal Hefeweisen except stronger. Banana is particularly prominant.,Some peppery notes. Smells quite sweet.  M- Perfectly light and smooth with some refreshing carbonation to boot. Truly amazing.  O- This is very close to beer perfection! It's an incredibly refreshing beer with a very tasty palate. An instant favourite of mine.",Bayerische Staatsbrauerei Weihenstephan,Germany,Hefeweizen,98
252,731,coopbrewer,4.8,I do not have much to add that hasn't already been said by other reviewers other than to say this is absolutely one of my favorite beers...and I don't really care for this style. In my view that says just how great this beer is! This brew is a staple in my beer cellar.,Bayerische Staatsbrauerei Weihenstephan,Germany,Hefeweizen,98
252,731,magictacosinus,4.78,"Poured into a weizen glass from a 500ml bottle.  Appearance: About as perfect as a weizen beer should look. Pours a strong cloudy straw amber color with an enormous, foamy head. The head never disappeared. There are tons of carbonation in this beer, and is so delicious looking that I want to refrain from drinking it just so I can stare at it.  Smell: A sweetened wheat smell with enormous cascades of fruity, malty aromas of bananas, coriander, pears, canned peaches, sugar cane and clove. This must be the ultimate prototype of what an ideal wheat/spiced ale must smell like.  Taste: I don't think I've ever had a beer this creamy, thick and juicy before. The yeast gives the beer its bitter edge, but other than that, there are loads of flavors in this beer. Fruity, spiced flavors are all over the place, yet it contains a bready taste that reminds me of baked goods fresh out of the oven. In the realm of wheat ales, this is a sublime tasting experience.  Mouthfeel: Its feel, while quite balanced, is still not up to par with the other aspects of the beer, but this does not mean that it's mediocre by any means. While the beer is creamy and thick, there is an undeniable watery feel to it, and virtually no bitterness - not much sweetness remaining on the palate as well.  Overall: Wheat beers are not my favorite by any means, but this completely transcends hefeweizens as a whole. This beer is a MEAL. If Weihenstephan is indeed the world's ""oldest brewery,"" it shows. If your brewery was hundreds of years old, you'd inevitably perfect a recipe this good! This is a world class ale that is extremely well balanced, flavorful, and very easy to drink. For its low price, you'd have to be nuts not to have one!",Bayerische Staatsbrauerei Weihenstephan,Germany,Hefeweizen,98

T - The wheat and citrus blend well with some spice. Very refreshing brew.  M - A very crisp and clean feel. Very light bodied. Makes you want to take large gulps.

252,731,younger35,4.26,"Picked up a bottle of this to formally review. I’ve had it many times though so it’s nice to really think it over. Drank from my Widmer mine Hefe glass.  Appearance- Pours a straw colored yellow with a hugely beautiful white head that literally has stiff meringue like peaks. An amazing cap and collar stays the ENTIRE beer along with TONS of thick rich lacing. One of the best looking beers I’ve ever seen. Smell- As you’d expect and just as I remember the light plantain sweetness is softer than most Hefs and the spiciness isn’t as bold. There is a light lemony cleanness to the beer with a touch of orange peel and maybe even coriander. It’s all there, just in more moderation. Maybe I’m just too used to the American versions. Taste- Much like the nose it’s just ridiculously balanced and nothing is overdone. The spicy bite of the yeast is very neutral as the banana is sort of an afterthought - not the main flavor like most. Other than just a teeny tiny kiss of clove and maybe some white pepper, there isn’t any other spice. The wheat is more of a player than one might expect as it’s doughy and full. The finish is malty and damn near floury (not a bad thing, just the flavor I get) as the wheat is really prevalent. Mouthfeel- Thick and rich with a crazy creamy feel. The carbonation isn’t all that zippy even with the large head but the feel is great. Drinkability- Definitely a super good beer that I enjoy every time. The look and mouthfeel are absolutely spot on perfect and the taste is about as balanced as you’ll find in a Hef. There are a few other Hefs I prefer (see Paulaner) but even those are usually more carbonated than I like. Tasty beer that we’re lucky to have everyday access to here in Minnesota.",Bayerische Staatsbrauerei Weihenstephan,Germany,Hefeweizen,98

252,731,TheGrunt,4.76,"One of the best, if not the best Hefe beer, although there are many other beautiful german wheat beers with similar qualities. Germans really know how to make great Hefe and today, I don't buy anything but german Hefe beers.  Colour is hazy golden yellow, similar to the other light wheat beers. Smell is the most unexceptional quality of this beer. It's nicely fruity and honey-ish, but pretty light. Medium to trong foam after pouring. Opening the bottle rises foam on the bottle nozzle.  Look and smell is nothing compared to the taste of this drink of gods. It is simply stunning. Taste is very fruity, with honey and herb flavor. Images of Bavarian spring meadow flashes in your mind after filling your mouth with this terrific beer.  Highly recommended, if you like sweet wheat beers. Hefes are not for everybody and I think many lager and ale fans don't like the sweet taste, but if you are into these, then I welcome you to real beer heaven!",Bayerische Staatsbrauerei Weihenstephan,Germany,Hefeweizen,98
252,731,musicman575,5,"Sweet, mellow, smooth, spicy, buttery goodness! Every time I drink this on tap, it is billowy and beautiful. Hazy Goldenrod right up to the 0.5 mark on W's beautiful swirly glass with the billowy, creamy foam that flows over the top. What a magnificent wonder!  All the sexy, gooey spicey aromas (cloves, orange, popcorn, etc...) flow right up through my nostrils and grind up against against my olfactory business and makes me nose-cum. Okay, it's really not THAT amazing, but it is still pretty awesome.  This is probably one of the best beers you can get for the price. No American wheat beers even come close to The W. It is so smooth. It goes down the hatch easier than the finest cut of fatty salmon. It melts across your tongue like a fine, seared foix gras. It tickles your mouth-senses as much as the most aromatic spicy curry. It also gives you the ability to urinate in public in the presence of police without getting caught...err...wait, no, I got caught. Anyhow, I showed up to court and the cop didn't. Case dismissed.  If you know of a better hefe, please let me know, because you're wrong. I will gladly knock down your door and beat some sense into you.

The head is absolutely fantastic with about 3 fingers worth of fluffy white head that dissipates over a long period of time.  The nose has bananna, spices, and light malts. There may be some strawberry and/or raspberry notes in there.  The taste is an explosion of the banana and spice flavors but not anywhere near anything that is overwhelming.

Big bananas and cloves along with other belgian spice notes. All around spectacular aromas here.  T - Wow, again, exceptional flavours. More banana and close notes and gentle wheat notes. as the beer warms the flavors really open up but still maintains a nice refreshing finish.  M - Really nice carbonation here. Somewhat low, resulting in a smooth, creamy feel. Still, nice and refreshing.  O - Overall, I love this beer.

252,731,thehenbarris,5,"Enjoying now, as I have many times in the past, poured from a bottle into a weizen glass on 7/27/11.  This is the gold standard hefeweizen; the one to which I measure all other hefes (which is, most likely, why I have yet to find another hefe I'm willing to give an A grade to).  A- Wonderful cloudy golden/orange color with rich, white head. The head is aggressive, and unless you pour into your glass in the most delicate possible way, it is going to require settling before you're able to complete the pour (which is totally fine by me--this isn't a beer for slamming/chugging).  S- Wheat, clove/spice, and light banana.  T- Wheat, clove, banana, a bit of butter toffee and bubblegum (but not too much, unlike many other hefes). The flavor is complex with many notes that aren't immediately apparent. I enjoy drinking this slowly because the flavor profile shifts as the beer warms a bit, revealing many of those buried flavors. Yum!  M- Mellow carbonation and a smooth texture. The beer is a pleasure to drink.  O- As the review indicates, this is a beer I have an incredibly high opinion of. I'd go as far as saying that it is my favorite beer of all time. Anyone who is a flavor of the style should give it a shot (especially if you're lucky enough to beer somewhere that has it on tap).",Bayerische Staatsbrauerei Weihenstephan,Germany,Hefeweizen,98

252,731,tewaris,3.34,"Weihenstephaner Hefeweissbier Hefeweizen Brewery Weihenstephan 5.4% ABV 24 IBUs  After a bad experience with this beer on draft, I decided to give this rather old bottle (distribution fail I suppose) a shot because the draft version (that I sampled) doesn't do it justice. 16.9 oz., batch # 3081 (bottled Feb. 2011) poured into a weizen glass. ~ $4/bottle.  Hazy light golden with a nice, moussy white head; excellent head retention, and great lacing. Perfect looks. No contest here. Aroma is perfume and spice, but not so much banana and bread; and the spice is random rather than dead on clove.  Tastes rather bland with mild fruitiness, ample kick of clove, and a finish that is a tad bitter for the style. Not saying that this one needs to be in line with the style because isn't this the beer that defines it?! Some lemony tartness, but bitterness is slightly heavy.  Mouthfeel is real nice. Crisp yet not overcarbonated, but the bitterness lingers and causes me to doubt the interity of this bottle.  Overall average --- This sample, not questioning what flows at the biergarten  Appearance 5/5; Aroma 3.5/5; Taste 3/5; Mouthfeel 4/5; Overall 3/5",Bayerische Staatsbrauerei Weihenstephan,Germany,Hefeweizen,98
252,731,notchucknorris,4.55,A: Cloudy pale gold color with a monstrous creamy white head. The head too quite a while to settle and finally leveled off at about a 1/2 finger.  S: Lots of clove with some nice yeast and banana. A little bit of apple pie as well.  T: Great malty flavor upfront followed by some clove and cinnamon. Some banana and delicate spices as well.

252,731,Kartoffeln,4.48,"A: Pours a hazy golden yellow with loads of visible carbonation and a typically massive, dense, pillowy white head that gradually diminishes to a thick cap of foam. Lacing is spotty.  S: Sweet, wheaty malts mix with the expected aromas of banana and especially cloves, rounded out by undertones of nutmeg and citrus (mainly orange). No discernible hops or, more surprisingly, yeast.  T: Rich Munich and wheat malts and an omnipresent yeast flavour (quite unlike the nose) are quickly joined by a pleasantly sharp note of cloves and milder tastes of banana and nutmeg. Towards the finish, the malt takes on a sort of biscuity character and lemon zest and ethanol flavours come through.  M: Medium-bodied with the usual high, crisp, champagne-like carbonation that gives a refreshing bite. The rather lemony finish is tart and clean, balancing the malt-and-spice flavour profile perfectly.  D: It's easy to see why this Weizen is so prestigious: it's traditional yet distinct in taste, refreshing yet satisfying, and flawlessly balanced overall. Archetypal.",Bayerische Staatsbrauerei Weihenstephan,Germany,Hefeweizen,98

Nice carbonation on the inside of the glass. The head is great: it rises huge, bone-white, and falls to a large cap with great lacing.  SMELL (4.5/5) The usual aromas for this style, and these are very well balanced. Cloves and bananas are there. I find the cloves a bit stronger than the banana (which I like very much). Some tartness (a bit of citrus) in there with some light wheat graininess; these fall behind the clove-banana flavors. No real hop aroma. Dry finish.  TASTE (4.5/5) Bananas and cloves right off. This is a bit more balanced than on the nose. The tartness (again, light lemon citrus) and wheat graininess bring out the clove really nicely. A hint of vanilla. Hop flavors and bitterness are both very low. Finish is very tart and dry.  FEEL (5/5) Really good. The body is lighter-medium and the carbonation is pretty high. Some body is added by wheat & yeast - this gives a delicious fluffiness. The carbonation also plays well with the finish.  DRINK (5/5) Hugely drinkable and tasty.

252,731,ummswimmin,4.45,"Typically when a brewery has been making the same beer for a while; a competitor has come along with something much better. The style can become stale, and somebody else improves the flavors (see Sam Smith, Oatmeal Stout).  This is the third oldest beer recipe I have ever had (see DFH series). The brewery started in 1070.  I had this beer outside on a warm afternoon, which is ideal to enjoy a Hefe. The pour was into a wheat beer glass.  I poured properly, but there was a lot of light head. I measured four fingers in my glass. It dissipated to two fingers, which held for quite a while.  Off the foam I picked up banana esthers and wheat characteristics. It was a really nice set of clean smells.  The taste was similar to the bouquet. It was very refreshing.  I really liked the beer. I look forward to the next time I drink it.  Side note: my beer arrived with a lemon balanced on the top of the bottle. No quality hefeweizen should have fruit added to it. It masks the smells, and a beer with quality characteristics should not be hampered with the intrusion of fruit. I get why the bar did it... Widmer trained us to do this.

Or like the hair of that blonde girl on the beach when you were thirteen that one summer. It was a little cloudy She had to be six or seven years older, but you'd swear she winked when you saw her gawking. In any case, you were on vacation and would never see her again. Though you think of her from time to time, by the time you were old enough she'd probably be married and settled down. Best to leave that cloudy banana-yellow hair as a distant memory of your youth.  Beautiful day. The heady seafoam left lines where the waves hit the sand, lacing the beach like a white dress. Yeah, she'd be married by now.  S: The cottage you stayed in had a faint spicy scent like bananas and cloves. It was an alluring and strange scent; a bit foreign, and it made you wonder what the mysterious people who'd stayed here before were like.  T: ""Probably just banana cream pie,"" someone commented at the time. You don't remember who. May have been your older brother, who moved to New Jersey for work and has two kids and is on his second wife.  The exotic illusion left your head, but a new one entered. The place was homey now. Sweet. Nothing so unusual as sweet banana cream and clove. There's also a bready taste to the kitchen air, though this isn't strong enough to carry through the rest of the cabin.  M: When you head back out to the beach, the girl is gone. The sand feels unusually fine between your toes, smooth and a little muddy. The foam collects on your feet and ankles and the little bubbles pop there, faint but enough that you can feel each minute explosion.

252,731,kkipple,4.68,"Can I just add in a 3rd review to this much-loved brew of mine? It's 12:33 on a Saturday afternoon in Columbia, which is currently about as hot as the Sammath Naur. I'm sitting here halfway through a growler of my beloved Weihenstephaner Hefe, which I am enjoying out of it's own glorious glass. Everything seems right with the world.  Since I've reviewed this beer twice over, let me take a different tack now and simply praise it some more. This may be the beer that has had the greatest shift in appeal for me, ever. At first review, way back in 2006, I was pleasantly surprised as up till then I ""don't usually spring for Hefes"". My how things have changed...  This beer currently sits under Westvleteren 8, Bourbon Sexual Chocolate, and 5 other beers on my top ten list. To be able to buy a growler (From Green's on Piney Grove, bless 'em) of my #8 rated beer of all time for a measly $10 is just such a wonderful thing... here is a brewery that has been around since the Dark Ages, still cranking out beer today. I don't know if the beer was better in the past or will be better in 2208, it is fantastic now.  The extreme drinkability of Weihenstephaner Hefe is maybe only matched by its balance. We have a puffy, creamy, mellow yet flavorful wheat beer boasting a superb finish, which is a stumbling block for most American brewers of this style (and many Germans as well). It fades out gently, with neither clove-spice nor lemon-sour nor fruity banana dominating, but all turning out the lights, tucking you into bed, and tiptoeing out the door quietly, making sure to shut the doors behind them. What's left in your mouth and mine is a delightful light sweetness, mineral water, wheat-dough, and spice flavor that is entirely inoffensive - and is actually great.  I suppose I could gush about this beer all day, but I have Things to Do. So let me just say, again, that an unfiltered Weihenstephaner Hefe out of the proper glass on a hot day is one of my favorite things in life. One day I will drink this close to the source and it will be good then, too.  I do not exaggerate when I say that I think that enjoying Weihenstephaner Hefeweissbier is one of the infinite, small mercies of God. Prost indeed.",Bayerische Staatsbrauerei Weihenstephan,Germany,Hefeweizen,98

Smell has a large presence of clove and coriander, light aroma of yeast and a bit of banana.  Taste is surprisingly straightforward at first with a sweet malt touch, hints of spice start to seep in, like coriander and clove and some citrus, mouthfeel seems thin and watery at times though, carbonation is soft but quite present and lends a subtle creaminess.",Bayerische Staatsbrauerei Weihenstephan,Germany,Hefeweizen,98

S: Lots of wheat, honey, banana, clove, coriander and some citrus hints. The scents are quite potent, inviting you to taste this beer.  T: Starts off with a nice clean wheat and honey taste on the front end. The clove, banana, coriander and citrus are quite prevalent. On the back end the yeast and wheat comes back to the palate. The flavors blend extremely well, nothing is too overpowering.  M: Leaves a slighty grainy taste on the palate. A nice amount of carbonation for this light bodied beer.  O: One of the best Hefeweizens you can try. Ranks right up there with the Penn Brewery Hefe, Troegs Dreamweaver and Fat Heads Summer Haze, in my opinion. Very clean and refreshing, perfect for those summer days. Certainly a must try for any Hefe fan.",Bayerische Staatsbrauerei Weihenstephan,Germany,Hefeweizen,98

A: Poured from the 375ml bottle into Bruery Tulip glass. The beer pours a hazy honey color with a good two inches of frothy white head that very slowly receded, leaving nice lace behind, before finally settling at about three quarters of an inch.  S: Soft scents of sweet clove, mild spice, banana, wheat toast, and a very mild esters of yeast.  T: Well intergraded flavors. Layers of banana, lemon, some cloves, and toasted wheat bread. Mild mineral quality, but smooth and well rounded.  M: Low to medium carbonation with a mild creamy medium body.  O: Hits the mark. Refreshing, balanced, and though not overly complex, it's brilliant in its execution, and quite enjoyable.

Banana and spicy clove along with sharp citric notes of lemon and orange as well...very enticing.  All the classic Hefeweizen notes are present. Ripe banana and clove, faint bubble gum and a hint of green apple tartness. Spicy and malty in the finish with an undercurrent of warming alcohol. Much more robust than most in the style.

S - Smells of tangy, fruity esters (typical of a good hefeweizen). Bready wheat comes through along with notes of coriander and citrus.  T - Dry and wheaty up front with a healthy dose of citrus quickly following it. Has a pleasing, balanced bitterness that becomes noticeable in the middle and lasts through the finish. This could simply be a by-product of not having the freshest bottle, but there is also a somewhat prominent (but not entirely off-putting) metallic flavor muddled in with everything else.

There is way more tart & spice than I thought there would be. Sweet malts and citrus tart upfront smooth on the tongue with a really nice feel to it, followed up by the back end of this being a tad spicy.

Very pleasant and inviting.  T: First sip dominated by strong clove flavors. Clove and banana flavors throughout. Hints of pear, coriander, occasional lemon zest, and a touch of black pepper.

But certainly goes down easy and leaves you ready for another.  O: Overall, a very good drink that to me comes off like a lighter version of a good tripel. It’s a little too light for my liking, and I would prefer if it had some stronger, more lasting flavors.

252,731,BelgiumBill,4.7,"I paid $1.79 for a single 12 oz bottle at Total Wine. The bottom of the back label had ""1081"" printed - not sure if that is a freshness date or lot number. There was some noticeable yeast in the bottle settled where the bottle lay.  When poured it produced a massive 3 inch lumpy almond white head that stuck all over the pint glass as it slowly receded. It was translucent orange blossom honey colored - beautiful for a hefe.  It smelled of wheat, coriander, and sweet malts.  The flavors were complex and varied. sweet maltiness comes through the wheat and spices such as coriander, nutmeg, and I think some celery seed. I served it at about 38 degrees - colder than recommended. As it warmed, I got more of the banana bread qualities. Are there any hops in this? I got hints of the hops at the very end of the finish.  Great mouthfeel. It had just the right carbonation that helped cleanse the palate in preparation for the next sip. It was clean, refreshing, and fuller bodied than typical hefe's.  This is world class, but I guess if you've been doing it for 1000 years you ought to have figured it out by now. Next time instead of buying a couple bottles, I'll be opting for the six-pack. Great summer beer.  If you have never had hefeweissen then you should try this, if you don't like it, dont bother trying any others.

Smell: Sweet citrus smell with sour mash mixed in behind, not a rich smell, rather simple without any complexity.  Taste: It tastes more like a Belgium tripel. It tastes weak and one dimensional; there is no body or depth to this beer. It tastes like a vitamin enriched Coor’s Light  Mouthfeel: Little oily coating, but overall not much of an impact one way or another.

252,731,BarryMFBurton,4.33,"A bottle stamped with “The World’s Oldest Brewery:” as a lover of craft beer, how could I pass that up? Here we have Weihenstephaner’s Hefeweissbier, which is a classic not just because it’s ancient. As far as Hefes go, this is one of the heavy hitters. Mention Hefes and someone will probably bring up Weihenstephaner. And they’ve definitely earned that street cred – the brewery’s been operational for nearly 1000 years. Impressive, yes, but how does this beer stack up when under the scrutiny of modern tastes? Let’s find out…  A: A cloudy, unfiltered, glorious golden body. My pour, though quite unhurried, yields the biggest head I’ve seen in a long time. This beer is even foamier than Duvel, and that’s saying something! But it’s a healthy, organic foam, with a wonderful continuous showing of carbonation. Hell of a lot of lacing, too. Thick, bubbly, rich – a great start.  S: An incredibly phenolic nose. Clove and medical notes comprise the acidic showing, filling the senses until there’s no room for anything else…at first. Somehow, a hint of malt squeezes in, alongside some slight biscuity tones and the obligatory cherry-pear-banana-peach Hefe fruitiness. Still, the biggest scent is the lemony acid of the fermented yeast.  T: There’s one word that comes to mind when I take my first sip: “mature.” It’s monstrously easy to tell, through the mellow and balanced feel this beer has, that a lot of maturity went into the brewing process. Nearly a millennia of practice tends to produce some good results. Anyway, the first flavor specifically to hit is a lemony freshness – that acidic zest that I was expecting. The fruits that follow range from sweet and juicy to tart and puckering – apple, berry, pineapple, banana, grape. These are complex wheats like I’ve never had before. The back end isn’t dry or hoppy in any way; just bready. A calm aftertaste that really seals the deal on a Hefe palate that needs nothing more.  M: This is where my biggest concern is. It’s watery, plain and simple. Not watery like a Bud Light; watery like too thin for a palate this advanced. Colder, this beer would make so much more sense: the carb would be more noticeable and this wouldn’t be so much of a turn-off. As it stands now, though, with the beer warming to room temperature, the first discomfort becomes known. Not terrible, but it could have been so much more.  O: All mouthfeel problems aside, this is an impressively addictive Hefeweizen. Normally, I’m not a fan of said style, and tend to shy away from a second glass. Not here, though: Weihenstephaner really has its stuff figured out. I’ve heard it said before, and I’ll say it again myself: this is the world’s premiere Hefeweizen. No doubt about it. In fact, I’m adding this to my list of “On-tap Must-Haves,” so, from now on, I will check for this at every establishment I patronize. Can’t wait!",Bayerische Staatsbrauerei Weihenstephan,Germany,Hefeweizen,98

252,731,Reaper16,4.75,"12oz. bottle served into a weissbier glass  Pours a very hazy combination of yellow and orange. It's light yellow around the edges of the glass, but there is a solid column of orange in the center. The strangest part is that these colors are distinct from each other, not blended in. Three fingers of dense, meringue-like head billow up, a mountain of small, fine bubbles. It laces like a dream. I can't imagine that the Hefeweizen style can look any better than this.  Everyone knows how a Hefeweizen is supposed to smell. It's supposed to have zippy wheat aroams. It's supposed to have estery yeast aromas of banana, bubblegum, and clove. It's supposed to have a little bit of lemon. Weihenstephaner has all of these things. Where it excels at is balancing the aromas. I've never had a Hefe that is as balanced as Weihenstephaner's offering. The lemony wheat provides a sturdy backbone for the yeast scents. Clove and banana compliment each other perfectly, with small undertones of bubblegum and a nearly medicinal phenolic (that is vaguely reminiscent of seaweed) smell working to round off the edges.  The taste is just as phenomenally balanced. All of the flavors are so well-balanced and so well-integrated that it tastes like one flavor (as opposed to numerous flavors overlapping). It's remarkable how well the clove and zippy malted wheat draw out the best in each other. Weihenstephaner delivers no unexpected flavor. What sets it apart, again, is the balance between everything. This is a remarkable, inspiring example of brewing. My one qualm with this beer is that the finish is too bready. The zippyness gives way to a wheat bread flavor that I wish weren't there. Flat finish aside, this is astonishing.  The mouthfeel is pretty lovely too. It's very thick, very creamy. When looking to nit-pick, I'd say it is too creamy. Some of the refreshing carbonation is lost. Still, it's a very satisfying mouthfeel. Overall, this is probably the best Hefeweizen I've ever had. It's nearly perfect. A must-try for every single beer drinker.",Bayerische Staatsbrauerei Weihenstephan,Germany,Hefeweizen,98

Little fresh dough scent lingers.  T: Very upfront citrusy banana flavor. Mild wheaty, earthy tones bringing up the rear.  M: Full-bodied. Faint fizziness. Creamy.  O: An exceptional Hefe. I'm sure this is, or should be, the standard by which all Hefe's are judged. I mean, they've been brewing since 1040! Almost 1000 years! I'm still partial to the Sierra Nevada Kellerweis (maybe because they tweaked it to american tastes?) But this is almost a perfect beer.",Bayerische Staatsbrauerei Weihenstephan,Germany,Hefeweizen,98

With hints of lemon and banana  T- At first sip you get a gentle blend of sweetness and as the beer goes down you get a nice whiff of spiciness.

You cant ask much more for this style.",Bayerische Staatsbrauerei Weihenstephan,Germany,Hefeweizen,98
252,731,output01x,4.65,"Poured from a 500 mL. bottle (no date) into a weizen glass.  A slow pour yields a massive 3-finger creamy of white head that recedes slowly but never disappears. The body is a hazy pale golden straw color with literal jets of rising carbonation bubbles. Slight lacing clings to the sides of the glass throughout consumption. All in all, this is one gorgeous looking beer.  A strong wheat aroma is complimented by a spicy clove scent. Notes of banana, green apple, and bubblegum can all be found within the complex nose.  This beer tastes exactly as its nose implies. The flavors of wheat and clove have a nearly creamy quality while a strong banana note adds to the character of the beer.  Light to medium bodied with great carbonation, this beer has fantastic drinkability. The carbonation permits the flavors to stick around for just the right amount of time.  Definitely one of my favorite beers, Weihenstephan's Hefeweissbier is a summer staple for me. The complex yet mellow flavors allow this beer to be both examined and chugged. It is the perfect example of the style.",Bayerische Staatsbrauerei Weihenstephan,Germany,Hefeweizen,98

252,731,Roke87,4.4,"500 mL bottle poured into a Weihenstephaner weizen glass at cellar temperature. Best before date: December.22.2011  Appearance- Pours a nice semi-cloudy golden straw colour with a massive four fingers of fluffy white head that very slowly dissipates to a fluffy bubbly top of head that does subside but never really goes away, a very sexy looking beer to be honest.  Smell- Can definitely smell the yeast right away and it has a clove spice to it on the nose, the usual bready malt aromas are also very present and a nice fruity aroma of bananas and citrus fruit come through in the backbone.  Taste- Very similar to the smells although the spices from the cloves play a much more major role on the palate hitting you right away, the citrusy fruits come in next with the unripe banana taste coming through more than the citrusy notes. Again the usual bready malt flavours are there in the taste as well although not as predominant as in the smell and a hint of yeast comes through in the taste as well, overall a very complex tasting Hefe.  Mouthfeel- A medium bodied Hefe that has great carbonation, definitely very smooth, crisp, and easy drinking as well. Although sampled at cellar temps I’m sure a nice cold one would be very thirst quenching on those warm spring days  Overall- There is a reason why this one is rated so high and it does deserve all its praise, the smells are great and the taste is even more complex, overall just a great hefe and worthy of a world class beer. Honestly I feel almost privileged that this is a regular offering at the crappy old government dominated LCBO, a definite go to when is search of this style of brew and pretty much the benchmark from what I compare others in this category to as well, very quality and well worth it.",Bayerische Staatsbrauerei Weihenstephan,Germany,Hefeweizen,98

T: Wonderful taste, lots of clove, citrus, and the right amount of banana. Amazing balance, the biscuit flavor is there, but not bready at all. Really wonderful, nice and summery.

Smells of yeast, sweet malt, lemon, clove, grass, spices like pepper, banana and soft fruity notes; really nice and for a lack of better words, it smells happy and inviting.  Tastes of sweet malt, yeast, lemon, banana, clove and the classic metallic funky-ness from the yeast, which tingles and prickles the tongue and then gives way to coriander, pepper and other spices, some orange peel, tart apple or pear, citrus hops, wheat and some very light bready grains. Wow, talk about a great summer session beer, this brew has been going for hundreds of years for a reason – it is damn tasty.  Mouthfeel is light, crisp and refreshing, and yet smooth, creamy and slick at the same time; this has very light to almost zero carbonation, a dry finish on the tart side that almost feels like the beer evaporates after each swallow.  A great beer that has just the right balance of everything that a hefeweizen should have; the clove, spices and banana are mild and perfect and won’t turn off a “regular” beer drinker. This is the standard for this style and I’m glad I had it again with the ability to savor and review it. A very high recommendation on any day, and the fact that I got it at a super market for $2.99 per 25 oz bottle makes this the bargain of the year so far.",Bayerische Staatsbrauerei Weihenstephan,Germany,Hefeweizen,98

Very similar to the nose, with banana, orange and peach coming though, but a taste of bubblegum is present as well. Cloves come through strongly in the finish.  Body is very refreshing, but not too light. Perfect for the summer. Carbonation is a little strong for my liking, though I suppose it is fairly in line with the style.

Smell- Exactly what you should expect from the style. Lots of cloves and bananas. Pleasant, but not overpowering in any way.  Taste- Again, bananas and cloves, a very full taste, but still very easy drinking.  Mouthfeel- Exceptional! Despite the full taste, this in no way taxed my palate.

Smell is fascinating, with aromas of banana, cloves, tangelo, peach, and sun dried sweet wheat. Taste is almost beyond words and this is from someone who is not much of a fan of wheat beer. There are a myriad of flavors weaving in and out of each mouthful. There is banana, cloves, orange, lemon, vanilla, cinnamon, did I mention banana, well it was just great.

I poured moderately gently and got a huge head. Hazy yellow hay color is just what I would expect. The smell was less intense than I thout it would be. I expected banana and slight clove. I would say I got more of a slight clove and slight banana smell. There is some kind of coriander or lemon zest smell, but I know they did not use spices. The taste, while wonderful really threw me off. I expected an intense banana ester. I would say it is more balanced between cloves and banana than it leans towards one or the other. What I really noticed on the first sip was a high level of carbonation. I knew it would be high, but I didn't realize how high it would be.

Carbonation was lively and there was excellent body lacing that dissipated slowly.  DRINKABILITY: The best hefeweizen I've tasted to date.

252,731,Smakawhat,4.72,"Had on tap to have again in a mug at Biergarten Haus DC.  Biggest difference in appearance is the great foamy head with the great looking to go buttery yellow body.  The nose is just bigger and more varied. With the sweet lemon is now butter, even cinammon it seems and banana. Crispness sense is gone. It smells fantastic.  Taste is still super solid but less tangy and much more bold bringing out everything in the nose in balance, lemon, banana, clove, cinammon, with a great malt density.

Banana, faint citrus hops, coriander, yeast, bread.  T: Exactly like the nose leads on. Incredibly crisp flavors of mellow citrus hops (contradictory?), banana, bubble gum. Lastly is the touch of mint that just makes this ridiculously refreshing.  M: Light body, super crisp, lower carbonation.  O/D: I've never had a ""hefe"" I thoroughly enjoyed. I don't know if it's the style in general, or just the ones I have had up to this point. I looked this beer up, and luckily it was on tap. I just had to have it after looking at reviews.

252,731,devilben02,4.13,"Although not my go-to style, I can certainly appreciate a good hefeweizen from time to time, and this is a very good hefeweizen. Poured from the bottle, the color is a warm, creamy-looking yellow-orange, with a big, fluffy, foamy white head. The fragrant aroma spills out with the prototypical German yeast characteristics of banana and clove to go along with a wheaty earthiness. The flavor is primarily an airy, lightly-sweet, and mildly fruity combination of unripe banana, milled wheat, and yeast. Despite the lightness of the flavors, the body is actually quite substantial, but the the fine carbonation makes it seem fluffy and smooth. Overall, I could identify a few little things that could be a bit better, but in the end this beer is just wonderful.",Bayerische Staatsbrauerei Weihenstephan,Germany,Hefeweizen,98

Light to medium-bodied with lively carbonation that dances across the tongue. I'm glad I picked this up to compare to a well-regarded (somewhat) local hefe.

Light pour and it was foaming like crazy, after everything finally settled and I finally emptied the bottle I had a 1.5 finger head with excellent retention. Hazy orange in color  Strong banana peel and clove aroma, orange is there as well.  The banana peel comes through strong in the flavor as well, clove and another kind of spiciness is apparent and a pleasant orange taste is lying under everything else.

Quintessential hefeweizen look here, the peachy color being entirely clouded over, sporting a two-finger thick cap of pillow-fluff foam. I kinda just want to sit here staring, as if at a beautiful woman, but there is other work to be done...  Plenty of yeast-driven banana aroma, lighter spices and a considerable tug of wheat/grain. Gentle, mellow, pleasant, solid.  Be careful...drinking this too cold does not do the beer justice. I know that from past experience with it. Seems something that could be left unsaid, but serious, subtleties will be lost. And this beer is largely about subtleties. A generous layer of banana forms the foundation, laying large on the surface, but underneath there are a myriad of spices that you might find in a variety of desserts, sweeter ones -- just saying ""clove"" would be too simplistic. There are notes of various fruit juices, especially pear and peach; faint but really nice bubblegum; wheat is soft and gentle, earthy and hearty, another subtlety but one that makes all the difference.  Texturally this is soft, slick, silky but no lack of presence. Carbonation is forward but hardly annoying. Even causes a light fruity pucker, especially the in the finish.  Hugely refreshing.

The aftertaste is great, consisting of a profound wheatiness.  M: It is medium bodied. Very easy to drink because of its great taste.

But considering that I hate that beer, I was skeptical to give others a try.  A: Pours a beautiful golden, hazy color with about 3 fingers worth of frothy white head.  S: Unbelievable amounts of banana and spices. Some citrus characteristics and a nice pungent scent that really has me aching to try this one.  T: Doesn't disappoint in the slightest. Tons of banana and clove pour out of this one. Front of the mouth it's all banana, middle of the tongue I get a nice kind of sour/pungent flavor, finishes with a nice yeast characteristic. Very, very refreshing. I wish I had another because I'd take it down in an instant. World class in my opinion. I didn't know hefeweisbier had potential like this. I'll be getting more of this soon.  M: Velvety. That's the best I can describe it. Nice carbonation, and a light body helps this one go down with ease. Very soft and smooth going down.  D: Tons of drinkability with this one.

Great yeasty/wheat-driven aroma, with strong notes of clove and banana. The taste is medium-bodied and slightly sweet, with a minimal hop presence.

I picked this up the other day after checking the top German beers list (and to encourage the warm weather to come a little faster!)

252,731,doktorhops,4.54,"Finally I get to one of my favourite styles: the classic wheat beer oder weissbier im Deutsch. What better a wheat beer to review than from Weihenstephaner, the worlds oldest brewery still running.  Poured from a 500ml bottle into a 500ml Stein glass.  A: The brew fizzes a little as I pour it into the glass, the solid white head settles to 1cm. The body is a classic cloudy orange and without the head you would almost mistake it for a glass of mango juice.  S: This is where wheat beers really excel for me; the aroma is a fantastic bouquet of banana and clove spice. It has a hint of bubble gum and if I must be honest this aroma would make a fantastic cologne (take note Calvin Klein).  T: Creamy, slightly banana taste. Distinctive malt is the main character in this brew and if you like your hops too bad - they've left the building. There is a mustiness mixed in that could only in my mind be the yeast, it's slightly distracting but not a deal breaker. The cloves also add a tip of the tongue tingle and give the sweetness some added complexity.  M: Again 'creamy' is the word of the day with this fine beer. It's not stoutland creamy but it is nonetheless quite substantial. The carbonation is fantastically well suited to the style.  D: In a word 'extremely'... that is if you like your wheat beers. Some people can't abide by them and all I can say is ""Your loss"". To me this is probably my 3rd favourite style of beer and this particular brew is quite exceptional, although I think Schneider Aventinus is a better beer and will do up a review on that soon... hopefully.  Food match: German fare; big sausages while wearing even bigger leather pants.

Grows a huge, white colored head, a thick, rocky flat of cream that hangs on through the entire glass, layering the glass with rows of bubbles with each sip.  The aroma is, clean and grainy. A nice amount of yeasty esters, giving up some nice banana character, with a hint of underlying clove. The malt character is very nice and bread-like which when combined with the esters is really quite mouth-watering.  This beer tastes exactly like it smells, and feels rich and creamy. The yeast profile shows up first, giving a nice, light fruity character to the beer, with banana predominating. There is a mild clove flavor, mostly towards the finish. The beer has a nice grainy, bread-like flavor throughout complimenting the other flavors admirably.  Absolutely delicious.

It smells thin like an old European beer always does to me. It's probably the US import weight though. It's almost perfumey.  The taste is very bready at first and then it follows behind the scent very similarly. It is mostly the spice that comes through on the taste with very little citrus to me. It definitely doesn't have the banana flavor I was expecting.  Mouthfeel is good. Very lifting and spritzy.  Completely drinkable. Would be great at a barbecue or on the back porch.,Bayerische Staatsbrauerei Weihenstephan,Germany,Hefeweizen,98
252,731,Jugs_McGhee,3.38,"Served on draught into a .3L Weihenstephaner glass in Berlin. Reviewed from notes.  A: Hazy blonde colour. Lovely creamy head boasts 1.5 fingers of height and a very nice retention.  Sm: Wheat, 2-row barley, minimal hops, ample yeasty esters and phenols. Very fresh and fizzy.  T: Wheat-forward open gives way to a fresh wheat body with a minimal fruity hop presence and a creamy finish. Well built for the style, but a bit unbalanced in that it's biased towards the body/middle act, to the detriment of the other two acts. Not a gestalt beer, if you will. (You won't).  Mf: Lovely. It's ideal for a Hefeweizen, and balances wetness and dryness quite well, tending towards the wet side of the spectrum. Refreshing and approachable.  Dr: For the price, it's certainly worth a purchase by Berlin standards. For fans of the style, it's a must-try.  [2017 note: BeerAdvocate changed their weights for each category relative to the overall score, so I have no idea what rating I originally gave this. Probably a B or B+ if I had to guess looking at my review.]",Bayerische Staatsbrauerei Weihenstephan,Germany,Hefeweizen,98
252,731,KajII,3.78,"[Best served in a Weizen glass]  Poured a murky yellow with a large rocky white head that was fully lasting and had excellent lacing. The aroma was loaded with a doughy yeast , bread malts, light citrus hops with notes of banana and cloves. It tasted mildly bitter-sweet to start and developed into a light, sweet yeasty flavor with notes of citrus, banana and some spices with the flavor lasting for quite a while, thus enhancing the experience. Mouthfeel was light in body and watery in texture with a soft carbonation.. Overall an outstanding Hefeweizen.",Bayerische Staatsbrauerei Weihenstephan,Germany,Hefeweizen,98

252,731,desiderius,4.65,"Appearance: Dark golden color; the head is white (more than one would expect for a beer with such dark color), big and dense; it's been described as 'rocky' and that's quite accurate: a crater is left in its middle as I pour in my glass; good but not impressive retention and lacing; rich carbonation.  Smell: The epitome of hefeweizen; ripe banana, wheat malt, little hints of clove and citrus; do I smell peanuts?  Taste: I dare describe it as manly and sexy; it's uncomplicated (in a good way) and not delicate (in a good way), and almost robust; grilled bread, banana; hints of peanut butter; minimal hops.  Mouthfeel: This is medium to full-bodied (for a hefeweizen); midway between 'crisp' and 'creamy'; just a bit dry; carbonation feels perfect;it's not a light bier, it truly fills one's mouth.  Drinkability: Finished it in less than I expected, and couldn't realize I'd drunk 500 mL of bier; this is seriously drinkable!  Best hefeweizen I've had so far. Combines two things I love in a beer: strength and drinkability.",Bayerische Staatsbrauerei Weihenstephan,Germany,Hefeweizen,98

The head has good retention properties and consistently left a thin layer of bubbles covering the surface. S: There are aromas of bananas and bubble gum in the nose along with some hints of clove. T: The taste has flavors of citrus and wheat; some hints of clove are present in the finish. M: It feels light- to medium-bodied on the palate and has a high amount of carbonation.

Easily produces more than three inches of thick creamy off-white head. Leaves little bits of lacing all down the glass.  Smell: Banana esters are very strong here. A lot of wheat and yeast aromas as well. I seem to detect citrus, like orange or grapefruit.  Taste: Welcome home after a hot day. This is pure pleasure. Sweet, but not cloyingly so. Plenty of wheat, with a tiny amount of sourness. A fair share of the banana and citrus, with some cloves. What hops flavors there are, are well-blended.  Mouthfeel: Medium to full bodied, this beer has a lingering pleasant sweetness. Not too much carbonation.  Drinkability: Oh, I could have these all day.

S - Lots of bready wheat and yeast, oranges, lemon, and a bit of spicy clove. The crisp citrus fruits mix well with the strong wheat core to produce a very pleasant nose.  T - Lots of chewy wheat up front, lingering thru the finish, mix well with the spicy clove and bright citrus fruits. Finish is pretty bready with most of it lingering long after consumption. Perfect beer for a warm day like today. Very nice stuff.  M - Medium-light body and flavor with moderate carbonation. Chewy feel from all that wheat. Finish is a bit spicy with plenty of lingering chewiness.  D - Very good. I am not the biggest fan of hefe's but this one really does set the bar for all others. One of, if not the, best I have had.

The flavor is light and complex at the same time.  Mouthfeel: A beer for any occasion. This is very refreshing. A bit of a dry aftertaste.  Drinkability: Morning, noon or night - again, a beer for any occasion. Smooth and not a lot of alcohol.  Overall: Is this the benchmark for Hefeweizens?

252,731,SirAndyR,3.68,"Appearance--Golden, deep wheat, partially cloudy, substantial cream-yeasty head.  Smell--Light yeast. Overall absence of spice notes or interest.  Taste--Characteristic Weissbier style in the background, but you really have to concentrate. This beer is so subtle, it is verging on transparent.  Mouthfeel-- Light and unremarkable, excepting that it is smooth, refreshing and clean  Drinkability--I love Weissbier and maybe I am unsophisticated, but this is way too subtle for a top ranked beer. The best Weissbiers revel in their yeasty, clovey, spiciness. This beer is surely a quality brew. It is smooth and beautifully clean, but it has no real character. It is technically a good beer, but it is not one that will win your heart, or a place in my basement biercave.

252,731,weizenbob,4.83,"This 500mL bottle was purchased at Pere Marquette Expeditions in Ludington, MI. According to the code on the label, this was bottled on 8/23/2010. The label has a lot of other good information as well: ""World's Oldest Brewery"", ""Store and keep cool 46°-52° F,"" ""Brewed under the purity law of 1516."" The last one is news to me as I was not aware that the Reinheitsgebot allowed for the use of wheat in the brewing process.  I poured this into a weizen glass. A moderate pour gives off a massive five-finger head, making a roughly 1:1 ratio of head to beer. The head is fluffy and retention is excellent. It does eventually settle, but never recedes completely. A narrow trail of foamy lacing spans of the glass. Carbonation is visible. The beer is golden and cloudy. It looks like the perfect glass of beer that they pour in every beer commercial on television (with some added cloudiness per style).  The aroma is giving off scents of lemon and wheat. Mild tropical fruit and heavy yeastiness next reach the nose. Light phenols waft into the nose with just the slightest noticeable hint of alcohol. Aromatics are strong and this beer's fragrance is easily detected from the other side of the table.  As this is the prototypical hefeweizen, all of the standard traits of the style are present in the flavor. There's the banana ester. There's a nice crisp wheat bite. There's a dry finish, and a yeasty aftertaste. It is a well balanced and very deliciously full flavored beer.  The beer is medium bodied and much heavier than commercial American takes on the style. Carbonation is on the lighter end for a hefeweizen but I find it to be perfect. The carbonation agitates the flavors nicely making the beer satisfyingly lively in the mouth.  Beer doesn't get much more drinkable than this. It's full flavored and well balanced with no off-putting bitterness. It has a wonderful weight in the mouth. The alcohol content is a moderately low 5.4% ABV; and for an import with such high esteem, this is very reasonably priced. I would gladly tip back another if only there was another to be had. I just wish that I could get them fresher.  ---  The Two-Schlitz Scale: (see my profile for an explanation) Schlitz may have been the beer that made Milwaukee famous, but Weihenstephaner is older than Milwaukee itself. I enthusiastically give two Schlitz for this excellent hefeweizen.",Bayerische Staatsbrauerei Weihenstephan,Germany,Hefeweizen,98
252,731,ffejherb,4.52,"On tap at Brass Rail Deli on 2/28/11.  A - Really cloudy pale cantaloupe flesh-colored liquid with a creamy white dollop of foam on top that dispersed into a swirly patch, leaving behind some spots and strings of lace.  S - Classic Hefe aroma with equal parts clove spice and bready malt with a hint of banana and spicy yeast. There is also a pleasant citrus character suggesting lemon zest and orange peel.  T - Opens with a bready malt character paired with clove notes and a more subtle banana presence. There is also a lemony citrus character in the middle, accompanied by toasted wheat grains, which is quite pleasant. Finishes with a hint of peppery spice in the backend, more clove and yeasty notes and a hint of citrus.  M - Medium bodied with pretty lively effervescence and a slightly chewy texture. Finish is subtly spicy with a bit of residual sweetness on the palate.  D - This is a Top 100 beer for a reason and perhaps the benchmark for the style. You don't stay in business for hundreds of years making sub-par beers.

S: Sharp acidic notes of lemon juice. Really easy to find wheat malt in this. Some light vanilla. Spicy notes of: Pepper, cinnamon, cardamom and maybe saffron. Mango and pineapple are also very present in the smell. Inviting.  T: Again, wheat malt is very present in this. There is some lemon in this. There are the usual wheat beers tastes of banana. Some vanilla like in the smell. Again there are spices: cinnamon, cardamom, pepper and saffron (yeah it's there for sure). Mango and pineapple are still there but not as much as in the smell. Very light herbal and earthy hops, but really not much. Perfectly balanced brew but sadly, no WOW factor I'd need for a perfect 5.  M: Silky smooth and very creamy. Good medium carbonation with sharp bubbles, keeping it alive. One of the most unique and amazing mouthfeel I ever had.  D: Amazingly high.

Plenty of smooth wheat aromas as well as lemon peel hit the nose. Fresh and semi-sweet with a honey note.  Flavor follows the nose with a sturdy yet smooth wheat backbone. Mild citrus hop with a lemon and tangerine tone. Mid-drink reveals a gentle honey sweetness that balances the experience.  Medium bodied and perfect amount of carbonation.

It was another dinner with pizza and another time to have something light to go along with it that would balance away the spice in the pizza but not be too heavy.  The hefeweissbier poured a thick and very bubbly white head that gave promise to having a good beer session. It's color was a cloudy yellow that was a little more of an amber color in the middle but around the edges was more yellow in color.  The smell was very yeasty with a hint of citrus.  The taste was less full-bodied than I thought it would be but it was very refreshing and light. The yeast could be tasted throughout with lemon-citrus being less prominent. Banana and clove flavors also made themselves known but were slight in strength.  This is a very good hefeweissen auf Deutschland!,Bayerische Staatsbrauerei Weihenstephan,Germany,Hefeweizen,98

Really wish they had it in six packs instead of 500ml bottles when I bought it, because I could really go for another one.

At the end of the taste some mild hops appear along with some residual malt flavor. The finish is clean and a bit dry.  Mouth feel: The mouthfeel is smooth and creamy.

The good news is that I already know this is a beer I enjoy.  After the pour a hearty head that looks like whipped egg whites sits atop the brew. Excellent retention. Slightly hazy pale gold color. Not light enough to be called straw, but a very pale gold. Some active carbonation rises to the surface. Not much in the way of lacing.  Aroma is classic and fantastic Banana pudding, slight spice and light grain. Clean, fresh and wonderful.  What I enjoy about this particular WeissBier is that the banana/spice flavor is so creamy. All the flavors are soft and rounded and really compliment each other. Each of the components work together very well. The yeast flavors are great and the spice hides just behind the banana to provide complexity. The creaminess makes me think of vanilla as well. I always think of a great banana pudding with the Nilla wafers. And believe me, that's a compliment in my book.  Creamy, refreshing and alive.. The mouth feel is spot on.  The drinkability is directly linked the great mouth feel and flavor.

Left behind is a thin snowy cap and soapy lacing strewn about the sides of the glass.  The nose is perfection. Orange and lemon zest, lemon grass, banana, clove and honey dominate. Sweetness meets a delicate spice to make pure magic happen.  The taste is right on par with the nose with the addition of a wonderful breadiness. Very lightly hoppy flavors intermingle with the sweet wheat and zesty citrus, banana and clove. It is absolutely wonderful.  Mouthfeel is light to medium and nicely carbonated.

It also has delightful lacing, with torrents of pin-head bubbles racing to the head.  S: A touch softer than what I was hoping for, but piquant nonetheless, the nose is marked by a gentle balance between clove and banana.  T: Deliciously dry, slightly acidic, and thoroughly enjoyable. The clove/banana marked in the nose make a strong appearance alongside mango and pineapple.  M: Full body, but lightened by the extremely effervescent nature of the brew. Spot on for the style.

252,731,SacredBeverage,5,"It comes in a 1 pint bottle with a label on it, and when it was made. Also has the crest and ""Premium Bavaricum"" on it.  A: It pours a cloudy golden straw color with a slow-receding head. It has a great color for a Weiss beer.  S: The aroma is amazing. It has traces of banana, clove honey, and has a nice sweetness to the aroma.  T: Now my favorite part, the taste. I first tasted clove, then slowly different flavors roll over your palate; honey, banana, and a slight lemon zest. It has a great flavor and is not too sweet or too bitter, a nice balance. I like this a little more than Ayinger's Brau Weisse, even though that is a superb Unfiltered-Wheat Beer.  Ml: The texture is outstanding, it is exceptionally smooth with no bitter aftertaste. It just rolls over your tongue with no harsh bite.  D: I could drink this every day and never get bored. Definitely a five. It is just such a great beer you don't get tired of drinking it. I highly recommend it.",Bayerische Staatsbrauerei Weihenstephan,Germany,Hefeweizen,98
252,731,surlytheduff,4.11,"12oz bottle, drank from a pilsner glass. The beer poured a cloudy rich golden color, with a three finger mushroom cloud of sculpted white foam. The head stuck around a really long time - I couldn't wait for it to recede before diving in. There was a distinct spiciness to the aroma ... black pepper, clove, yeast and grain, along with a lingering sweetness.  The taste was out of sight. Chewey wheat, clove, and banana goodness with a slight grassiness and lemon-zest flavor to it. It was very light bodied, very well carbonated and very refreshing.",Bayerische Staatsbrauerei Weihenstephan,Germany,Hefeweizen,98
252,731,CwrwAmByth,4.23,"A- Excellent, your typical wheaty, cloudy look, exactly what drew me to Weissbiers in the first place. Looks very refreshing.  S- Much like Erdinger, plain, however with a bit more of a kick this time, maybe some spice.  T- A great taste for a Weissbier, the plain wheaty taste is made more interesting with a tangy/sourness as well. Also some spice I cant put my finger on.  A great beer. I would definitely get this again.",Bayerische Staatsbrauerei Weihenstephan,Germany,Hefeweizen,98
252,731,JohnnyChicago,4.46,"Poured from a European sized bottle of unknown dimensions into a weizen glass.  A: Exactly what a heffe should look like. Cloudy tan colour with a cumulus cloud head that pushed above the glass.  S: Banana, cloves, bubblegum sweetness and soft hops.  T: Just delectable. Wheat tang with sweetness and a plethora of spices.  D: World class! It is as easy to drink as water, but the flavours are so intense and varied that it never becomes tiresome.  Overall: I have to be honest, I'm not crazy about heffes, but this one is forcing me to reconsider. It has that great balance and complexity that is hard to find in medium strength beers. If you had to drink only one beer all night, this would be a great choice. Never overwhelming but never boring.",Bayerische Staatsbrauerei Weihenstephan,Germany,Hefeweizen,98

252,731,MichialTanner1,4.95,"Ah, this one is a permanent resident of my home with the occasional rotation of Live Oak hefe from the local Draught House--an equally excellent, but very different drink.  Poured moderately from a bottle, two-fingers of snow will be produced. It would last forever, but the head itself tastes better than most hefes. The color depends on the surrounding lighting and varies from straw to a reddish-brown but is always cloudy-translucent--a picture-perfect hefe in any light.  The smell is perfectly consistent with the taste and the epitome of the style: cloves first, banana malt finish, some mild earthy tones and almost no detection of alcohol (most hefes are only 5-6ABV, so this is commonly concealed). Ginger is in the house.  Head is with you 'til after the beer is gone and IMO easily makes up for the lack of linger/aftertaste, which you shouldn't really expect from a hefe anyway.  Obviously, I am smitten with this one and would recommend it to anyone amateur to connoisseur.

The beer poured a golden color and was a bit hazy with about an inch of white foamy head.  The aroma was sweet of fruit, cloves, and possibly honey. Medium-bodied full of sweet flavor. A bit of a spicy taste to it as well. More interesting than I expected from this beer rom what I remembered of Bavarian beers of this style.

There is a sweet honey smell in the middle with some floral notes, (mainly honeysuckle.. goes without saying I guess) that seem to stick around towards the finish, also ending with a spicy clove bite. Very complex smell. Lots of things moving around mixing together creating interesting aromas. Taste is spicy and herbal. Cloves and lemon are upfront with some chamomile undertones. The finish is mainly honey sweet but still has a bitterness to balance it out. Mouth feel is smooth, creamy and has a bubbly finish. No complaints. Doesn't get any more drinkable. 9.99 a six pack?

A massive white, tightly carbonated and creamy head floats on top of an inviting hazy golden tangerine beer. Great retention, and a sheet of lace slides down the glass.  Smell: This is quite the balanced aroma for a Hefeweizen. Banana, clove, wheat, some white grape and green apple skin. It is very aromatic, with a flowerlike quality to it, although I get no specific floral aroma.  Taste: The start of the sip is bananas drizzled with honey. A dash of cloves, and some white grapes and tart green apple skin add some tartness and start it out. A touch of spicy hops is the finishing touch. The finish is dry and a touch bitter but otherwise cleans up well.  Mouthfeel: Extremely bubbly, this is very intensely carbonated. The beer doesn't wander around my tongue, it dances. This gives it quite a light mouthfeel. It is light bodied and although the front has some quite dry as well.  Drinkability: This is the epitome of a Hefe, light and drinkable.

Poured into the Weihenstephan weizen glass which is shaped like Das Boot!. Slightly hazy yellow golden color with an extremely fizzy and fluffy white cap. Bubbles slowly drifting upward toward the surface.  Smell is mostly of sweet wheat malts. A touch of spice and yeast. Simple.  Taste just overwhelms the tastebuds. Starts out with the crisp wheat malts, Then the quick touching down of lemon zest which is there only breifly to make way for the earthy - medicinal middle.Finishes with a slight bitter hoppy bite that blends perfectley with clove to skreetch this ride to a hault.

Spicey, taste almost like a Merlot. The alcohol is somewhat more present than in say, a Blue Moon. Aftertaste is also like that of a Merlot.  M - Less creamy than I expected. That actually works very well. Noticeably acidic.  D - Drinkability is where this beer really shines. This is perhaps the most drinkable beer I've had. It has enough complexity to keep me from getting bored, but not too much to where I feel overpowered. I could drink this all night.",Bayerische Staatsbrauerei Weihenstephan,Germany,Hefeweizen,98

Wanted to review before having the food.  The beer pours a vibrant yellow-gold coloring, with a tremendous amount of foamy, cloudy white head. The head disperses fairly quick while the beer settles. Wonderful blend of smells, including citrus, malt, and wheat. Other sweet and earthy fruit notes deep in the aroma, as well. The beer has a well balanced malt and citrus-sweet flavor, too. Buttery notes of taste help round out the beer. It is very smooth, and almost creamy feeling in mouth. The beer transitions seemlessly to a creamy finish, with a slight roasted aftertaste. Very easy to drink, and I think will go great with the spicy fare we are planning to eat.",Bayerische Staatsbrauerei Weihenstephan,Germany,Hefeweizen,98

No alcohol burn. Finishes sweet but not cloying.  D - Very drinkable, despite its big, complex flavors.

252,731,SolomonGrundy,4.03,"This brewery's product is so excellently priced that it's hard not to love them. I've had a few of their beers and they are always good and super well-priced. This is a 500ml bottle of 5.4% Hefe Weissbier for $2.99, how can you top that!!??  This is supposed to be the flagship, so let's see what's up...  Pours a slightly hazy straw colored amber. It's certainly not the lemonade color of American versions. A beautiful, creamy two to three finger head flares up and persists at about a half finger. Awesome...Medium carbonation. Slight lacing. Aromas are not what one might expect - way more yeasty than the American versions. A touch of sweetness amidst the yeast components. I get some other items in the aroma profile too: A tiny hint of cinnamon, Some caramel notes, and maybe even something like sarsparilla..Very cool. Flavor is super crisp, super vibrant. Carbonation kinda billows up in your mouth, and as you saw last night, that's not my favorite thing. A lot of yeast aspect to the flavor profile. A nice, clean wheat malt flashes in front of your tongue, tantalizing it with expectation. This dashes away and is quickly replaced by the complex and wonderful yeats aspects. I get a lot of biscuit with butter and bready notes in here. Like the stuff that comes with a bowl of soup - thick and hearty, not white bread. The late middle flashes apart into what I consider a slightly too thin finish. Too clean and watery for my tastes. No real hop component in here at all. Just a burst in the late middle of the drink, then gone. The bready, yeasty notes persist in the finish and that's about it. This is a completely different monster fromn the standard, bastardized American Hefeweizen, which is like drinking lemonade. This is actual beer that has complexity and nuance, and is super highly drinkable. Perfect even in winter with a nice white bean soup and some thick bread. Delicious and classic for the style. My only harp on this is the thin finish, otherwise find and drink folks. I would say you need to stock your fridge full of this brewery's products if you can - at least one of them will please any beer drinker.  What I like most: The wonderful, bready yeasty flavor profile.  What I like least: The thin, albeit nuanced, finish.  Verdict: So good and well priced it's almost criminal.

252,731,PEBKAC,3.87,"500ml edition. Bought a case. Then bought the bottles left on the shelf. All the Korbinian. Then all the dunkel & Kristal. Actual people coming over for New Years was just icing. :)  Left the Vitus for all the fanboys. I don't like it. :P  Hef glass. Waited a sec because it was mighty cold. A hazy pale orange/gold beer. Stiff Cool-Whip head. It's as thick as shaving lather in some instances. Swiss cheese lace.  Smell is unexplainably savory, but still bright like a Hefeweizen should be. Like warm pasta tossed with a little fresh butter & a little herbage. Terrible anology(& maybe I'm just hungry), but that's what I'm imagining. Light on the banana(though it's creamier then usual) & barely showing any anise/clove.  Taste is pungent banana esters with a twinge of orange. Sweet biscuity middle with a bitterness that is more green then clove. Finish turns to face dry, but doesn't quite get all the way there.  Good carbonation, if a little ethereal. Body feels heavier then I'd like.  I can't say that this is my favorite hef ever, but I've always come back to it. While imports aren't usually at their freshest, I've still had some really nice ones from Plank, Ayinger, Franz, & Schneider, which I feel are all superior to this one.

Taste in fruity, again with more pronounced banana and some lemon and wheat flavors. Cloves and some spiciness are present as well.  Highly carbonated, almost fizzy, with a light body. Smooth at the back of the throat while going down and prickly on the tongue at the same time.  Drinkability is very, very high here.

A pretty lighter orange hue that is quite hazy and a nice small head with great retention and lacing. Looks right to me.  Smells great with a fruity tinged german weiss character, cloves, lemon zest, some raisin/prune buried in there, and more. Pretty nice fragrant aroma.  Taste follows the smell, bread and wheat qualities abound but are back up and surrounded by lemon, raisin, clove, maybe even some licorice notes. Interesting and tasty.

252,731,JLeege,3.78,"Appearance- on draft poured into its branded half liter weizen glass. Hazy golden color with a nice fluffy head. Good retention and lacing.  Smell- Yeast, banana, clove  Taste- Very sweet. Banana, clove, and wheat dominate the palate along with stong spicy yeast characteristics. Some bubblegum and lemon as well, a very slight breadyness.  Mouthfeel- Medium body, fairly high carbonation.  Overall- I actually find this to be almost cloyingly sweet. I understand the respect for the brewery and this beer, but for whatever reason I don't find this to be one of the best beers in the world. It is good enough, and I have had it on probably a dozen different occasions, but I am always somewhat underwhelmed by this. Oh well.",Bayerische Staatsbrauerei Weihenstephan,Germany,Hefeweizen,98
252,731,dasenebler,4.57,"16.9 oz. bottle poured into an imperial nonic, the closest thing I have to a Weissbier glass.  Big, billowing creamy head is very nice, as is the hazy straw-orange color and lively carbonation of this beer.  Aroma is fantastic, with lots of banana, warm spices and lively yeast phenols.  Flavor was not as bright as the aroma, but nevertheless good. Very bready and yeasty, with notes of spicy clove and sweet banana. On the sweeter side for a Hefe, but still delicious. Mouthfeel was exceptionally smooth, but also somewhat watery. Lively, effervescent carbonation. Eminently drinkable.  This US-imported, bottled version lacks character. Fresh and on-tap in Germany, the Weihenstephaner has much better flavor, and would achieve a near perfect, ""world-class"" score. But over here...just ""excellent"".  *EDIT, January 2011, Germany: From a fresh bottle and into a proper wheat beer glass here in Germany, the Weihenstephaner Hefe tastes superior to the bottle I had in the states. Mouthfeel is amazingly creamy with perfect carbonation, so I'm upping it to a five. Drinkability is fantastic as well: five. I'm getting a case of this stuff! Prost!",Bayerische Staatsbrauerei Weihenstephan,Germany,Hefeweizen,98

Appearance: Pours a hazy pale golden yellow with a lot bubble action going on up to the 3 finger fluffy white head.  Smell: Banana, clove, spices, wheat and yeast.  Taste: The traditional hefeweizen taste, which I'm sure these guys invented and perfected! Banana, wheat, yeast, clove and spices. Wow!  Mouthfeel: Light bodied and carbonated very nicely.

252,731,DoubleSimcoe,4.27,"Weihenstephaner Hefeweissbier on tap at Perdition in Hell's Kitchen, New York.  Appearance: Served in a Weihenstephaner tall glass (easily 1/2 liter). Comes with a very white frothy head, a big one! Two fingers, recedes into one. Supeb lacing. Very hazy golden color.  Smell: Very rich aromas, of grass and hay, wheat all over, like the fields Vincent painted in Saint-Rémy-de-Provence while rapidly and unstoppably descending into sheer madness. Also some orange and various citrus aromas, including pineapple. Biscuit, bread and banana. Spices.  Taste: Very yeasty, like being at a bakery. Sweet notes. Touches of lemon and orange. Stinging hops. Pleasant, but not as exciting as the incredible nose.  Mouthfeel: Carbonation is low, body is medium, flavor is full. Refreshing and a tad watery (thin) but also delightfully bitter, with a nice hoppy touch at the end and a dry finish.  Drinkability: Not as high as I would expect in a beer with low ABV. It got me buzzed when I was only halfway through the pour (admittedly, it is a huge serving). A bit too much beer overall, I would not session or have several in one sitting, but super delicious nonetheless.  I mean, I usually favor big beers, but this one is stunning.",Bayerische Staatsbrauerei Weihenstephan,Germany,Hefeweizen,98
252,731,Jadjunk,4.31,"#50. The big 5-0, and not much else worthy of fitting that number than an award winning recipe older than the hills. I've never had the beer before but I'm willing to see what a masterpiece in Hefeweizen territory tastes like.  Poured from a 1 pt, .9oz bottle to my special mug at room temp.  (Appearance) Goodness, a volatile brew! A modest pour yields an enormous level of fizzy foamy head that retains incredibly well, leaving behind gobs of foamy head. That in addition to thick sticky lacing makes an impressive appearance. I still have a lot of this bottle to pour in and not enough room to do it with! Color of the beer is a smoggy murky gold tinged yellow. Carbonation is medium and bunched together in groups. The overwhelming amount of head is quite impressive. The appearance is simply great. 5  (Smell) First thing's first: I could smell this beer from several feet away which means it's quite pungent in terms of smell. An arrangement of some lightly roasted malty aroma and a bitter waft of grassy smell overlaps it all. Some big light grain, wheat and overwhelmingly grassy whiffs might be the biggest upset about the smell, but are far more subtle than in most macro brews, where a grassy odor is common. Fruits are also easy to draw out of here, amongst them, orange and definitely banana. Little in the smell keeps me from wanting to drink this beer. It smells good, but this is where any improvements can best be made. 4  (Taste) Some good tastes of light grainy malt and some complementary light fruit tastes; banana mostly, but also some orange bite, pear, and grape. Sweet honey rounds out the entire taste and a very fair level of non-intrusive herbal spices balance the finish. Yeasty bread-like smells are faint and complement the whole taste. Amongst I can pull out coriander and clove the most, comes through mostly on the finish, not so much as in what this reminds me of (Hoegaarden White), but enough so that it stands out. In the end, this is an exceptional brew. Sweet, light and subtle, yet defining taste. 4.5  (Mouthfeel) Beyond the foamy cap, a good balance of crisp and smooth in this drink. The herbal spice alludes to the crispness but the malty flavors round out the drink's smooth edge. The relatively average ABV is well hidden in this brew. A sweet finish with a herbal spice that brushes the tongue; it's like Hoegaarden, but with a more subtle finish and balance. It tastes fresh and at least as enjoyable. Great mouthfeel. 4.5  (Drinkability) One bomber to myself is what I need of this beer. The flavor is right on; this is a filling and enjoyable Hefeweizen and really worth any trip to the package store. If you're really in the mood, a shared bomber could easily make for one, but this beer is certainly worth every penny; at a $4 bottle, I felt it was a great buy. I might even get another on my next trip. 4  Verdict: If time is all it takes to perfect a beer style, then I'm going to have to dedicate an eternity to this hobby. Amongst my favorite beers and highly recommended to anybody willing to fork over $4 for something amazing. A (4.45)",Bayerische Staatsbrauerei Weihenstephan,Germany,Hefeweizen,98

252,731,spinrsx,4.13,"500ml Bottle  Appearance - The beer pours a murky amber/yellow colour with a massive frothy white coloured head. I can't see much carbonation due the murkiness of the beer and there is some very nice lacing down the sides of the glass. The head lasted for a very long time before it began to dissipate.  Smell - banana/bubblegum, wheat, cloves  Taste & Mouth - The beer has quite a bit of carbonation and feels very light and creamy on the tongue. Most of the taste is made up of wheat, bananas, and cloves. There are also notes of a pear juice sweetness. It finishes with an all spice and banana aftertaste.  Drink - Thanks to brews like this, I am quickly becoming a big fan of wheat beers.

Excellent lacing, excellent look.  S - fresh baked banana bread, very sweet notes of caramel, peaches, and malts.  T - cloves, banana, Belgian yeast, barley, wheatlike bread, surprisingly noticeable hop twang on the backend that I wasn't expecting from a hefe. As it warms, cloves and banana more pronounced. Alcohol presence is slightly noticeable.  M - I was expecting a huge fizzle of carbonation on my first sip but I was greeted with a lesser, more creamy level. Pretty light but very crisp mouthfeel, very nice!  D - this beer borders on almost perfect, it is extremely drinkable no matter what the year, sessionable, and most of all reliable.

The head laces very well, leaving little clouds down the side of the glass. The beer itself is a hazy straw color, bordering on witbier territory. The smell is about average for a hefe, it's bananas and clove. The taste is also archetypal hefe, just done better than everyone else does. It's not too sweet like I often find wits to be, it's nicely grounded by some earthy notes. Just a great tasting hefeweizen.  The mouthfeel is good too, it's light and nicely carbonated. It's also decently dirnkable, it's still just a tad too sweet to be extremely drinkable. Overall, this has to be the best hefeweizen I've ever had.

Nice mellow bready wheat notes to round out the smell.  T - Great banana and bread notes. Banana bread comes to mind instantly, duh! Even without the stupid lemon, im getting citrus hints. Very clean, crisp and delicious.  M - Crisp, slightly dry and light bodied this beer is wonderful. Nice, small spiky carbonation.  D - Very highly drinkable. This is a low ABV beer that is like drinking a sparkling juice. So tasty.  This style has never been my favorite, simply because no one really knows how to do it like this.

I had been drinking the usual domestic brands and a few imports for many years simply for the buzz factor and not really giving much thought to the actual taste and enjoyment of drinking.  The thing that first got my attention was when my buddy poured the beer and how thick it looked as it went into the tall Wheat beer glass.  Then he rolled the bottle to get the yeast off the bottom and poured out that massive creamy head. The glass was a wonderful golden cloudy color that you couldn't see through.  I took the time to actually smell the beer before taking a big glup of the head and yummy almost sweet banana tasting goodness.  That was it, I've been hooked on this Wheat beer ever since that drink many years ago.  Appearance: Golden and Cloudy.  Smell: Fruity with a nice wheat note.  Taste: Fruity with a wonderful Fruity Bananna finish.  Mouthfeel: Thick and very refreshing.  Drinkability: One right after the other for me. I can drink these Hefe's all day long and never bore my tastebuds.  I really dig this beer.

It has the sweetness and yeast to represent the style like it should. For other beers I would describe all around aspects but for this, I remarkably, have nothing to say. It is the perfect Hefe.

Has a very nice white, creamy head that is alive with carb. Simply a great looking beer.  S- A very crisp and clean clove smell with a touch of pepper.

The aroma is citrusy and clean, the taste is crisp, wheaty, sweet and citrusy with only the slightest hint of hops to bitter it.

252,731,kneeland,4.17,"I would say, it's like Blue Moon on steroids. As in, it's a lot like Blue Moon, but a lot better.  The color is very similar, an orange/yellow/wheat look. Very dense, but light enough to enjoy a few of. Very floral aroma, along with a lot of citrus. The head was good, a nice foam, not just laced bubbles on top.  If I ever have the chance, I'll definitely have more of this.",Bayerische Staatsbrauerei Weihenstephan,Germany,Hefeweizen,98
252,731,jar2574,4.41,"My new favorite wheat beer. Looks exceptional, with huge fluffy off-white head and orange/yellow colored, slightly cloudy beer. Excellent head retention and good lacing as it's drunk.  Nice smell, citrus, yeast. Not strong enough to warrant a perfect rating, but pleasant.  Smooth and easy to drink but with a zestiness underneath that keeps things interesting. It's like there's a touch of lemon in the beer without putting one in there, which is nice.  Very, very drinkable. Could drink 6-7 without getting full or bored of the flavor. Extremely good beer.",Bayerische Staatsbrauerei Weihenstephan,Germany,Hefeweizen,98
252,731,bigrzman,4.46,"Poured out of a 500ml bottle into a wheat glass. Pours out golden yellow with a thick creamy head that is fluffy like soap suds. Carbonation is lively as it should be in a wheat beer. Head laces the glass very well.  Smells include fruity esters and apricot and hints of yeast. Clean overall.  Tastes like apricot and banana with a little yeasty overtone. It is a hefe and this is perfectly acceptable. Other fruits come up and some grains. Very tasty.  Mouthfeel is tingly and warming. Carbonation is appropriate and it is a wet beer. Correct to style.  Drinkability is superb. This is one tasty brew and I will have some more please.  Job well done. This is a hefeweiss poster child of which all others will be judged by. Outstanding, a true classic.",Bayerische Staatsbrauerei Weihenstephan,Germany,Hefeweizen,98
252,731,secondtooth,4.3,"Poured into my ale glass with a major amount of froth, this well-regarded classic makes its presence known with a slightly spicy, clean scent and a clouded golden appearance. The flavor brings to mind grains and spices, like baked bread with a followthrough of clove. Tasty, balanced, and the best hefe I've had in some time.",Bayerische Staatsbrauerei Weihenstephan,Germany,Hefeweizen,98
252,731,uustal,4.65,"100th Review  Pours a pale yellow with a nice, bright white head. Good lacing and retention. Nice aroma. Clove, banana and some wheat and lemon. Perfect taste. Starts with a nice balance of clove, light peppery spice and lemon zest. Sweet banana and wheat are next in a perfect mix of flavor. No one aspect of the flavor is overpowering or artificial like some hefe's. The banana flavor is awesome. Crisp, light and refreshing.",Bayerische Staatsbrauerei Weihenstephan,Germany,Hefeweizen,98
252,731,tburus,4.78,"Poured into a 16oz Weizen glass.  Appearance: Cloudy yellow, sometimes picking up a hint of green, and slight carbonation bubbles rising. Exactly what I would expect liquid wheat to look like. Frothy head, some of which lasted on the glass until the end.  Smell: Somewhat bright, flowery smell.  Taste: Initially bitter, then sweet and fruity. The perfect consistency-- not too heavy, not too light. This is one beer that I can taste in my mind before I ever even open the bottle.  Mouthfeel: Such an enjoyable lasting taste. Not bitter at all. The sweet/fruity taste just hangs there.  Drinkability: I am disappointed when it's gone! Very easy to drink with a price that is somewhat easy to stock. The perfect beer for a night when I just want a good beer without any frills.",Bayerische Staatsbrauerei Weihenstephan,Germany,Hefeweizen,98
252,731,CharlatanSin,4.47,"Finally reviewing after many bottles and liters.  A: Poured the bottle into my Weihenstephan weiss glass.It's a hazy straw color with a medium puffy off-white head that dissipates into nothing. Wish a bit of head stayed on the beer.  S: Straw, banana, lemon, and earthy yeast.  T/M: Let it wash over you. Noticeable banana, though not extreme. Spicy, earthy wheat. Some clove and pepper-like spice from the yeast. Not a hop in sight. A tiny bit of alcohol as it warms. Body's light and crisp, with medium but prickly carbination which works great with the earthy wheat.  D: It doesn't get any better than this as far as wheat beers go. Has earned well its status as legendary.",Bayerische Staatsbrauerei Weihenstephan,Germany,Hefeweizen,98
252,731,Gehrig,4.33,"Sun Singer had one of these lurking in their cooler so, not to be stared down, I grabbed it for a semi-liquid lunch; good call!  Two fluffy white fingers of white froth top a slightly hazy yellow body; exceptional lacing and head duration. Good nose, veering toward excellent, with lots of spice (clove and a dash of pepper) and fruit (banana and a hint of lemon).  The taste is superb! Lots of banana mixed with clove, with some lemon in the finish. Definitely full of fruit, Hefeweissbier is light on the tongue, rife with flavor, and easy to quaff. Very delicious. I only wish I had the chance to beat the heat with this a few months ago, sitting outside sipping this splendid Hefe, instead of ""suffering"" inside with it, extolling its virtues. Maybe the texture could be a little more effervescent, but that might be a product of a long (cooler) shelf life. Really, I don't think that mattered much.  This is an excellent Hefeweizen, smooth, a bit bubbly, and chock full of flavor. Terrific, almost enough to get me out of my ""heavy"" kick on which I've focused on bocks, barleywines, and Belgian beers. I guess I'll have to wait until spring, but this was a great tide-over beer until then.",Bayerische Staatsbrauerei Weihenstephan,Germany,Hefeweizen,98
252,731,haazer,4.23,"Poured into my hefeweizen glass.  A- Lots of soapy white head. Takes a long time to settle. Cloudy, pale gold is this unfiltered beer. A very nice amount carbonation. Putting your ear up to the glass sounds like walking in tightly packed snow, or rice crispy cereal. Ok amount of spotted lacing. Before pouring the last bit in I swirl the bottle and pour in the last bit. Some murky looking liquid settles down through the brew.  S- The usual suspects of a hefeweizen. Great aroma of yeast, cloves and banana.  T- Very much like the aroma with a few additions. Upfront is a smooth banana taste, followed up nicely with the cloves. Tiny bit of the gum flavor, but not as potent as others. Ends with a somewhat bready flavor from the yeast.  M- Nice and crisp, yet smooeth and very refreshing. Light bodied, but on the heavier side of light. Not like your macro light beers.  D- Very refreshing. Perfect session beer. Best Hefeweizen? Havent had enough in the style to make that call but its gotta be in the top ten, or even five regardless.",Bayerische Staatsbrauerei Weihenstephan,Germany,Hefeweizen,98
252,731,thagr81us,4.45,"I've had this brew so many times it isn't even funny and am just now getting down to reviewing it. This was actually one of my gateway brews into the craft beer world. Served from bottle into a Franziskaner Weissbier Weizen glass. Poured a massively hazy golden yellow-orange with a three finger massively fluffy pure white head that remained for quite awhile and subsided to one finger toward the end of the glass. Maintained decent lacing throughout the glass. The aroma was comprised of bready malt, banana, cloves, and wheat. The flavor was of sweet malt, bread, banana, cloves, and subtle wheat. It had a light feel on the palate with mild carbonation. Overall, this is my definition of a Hefe. This is truly a great brew in just about all aspects. Has an excellent light and well balanced flavor and aroma. If you haven't tried this one, get off your ass and do it! Pretty good gateway brew for beginners as well.",Bayerische Staatsbrauerei Weihenstephan,Germany,Hefeweizen,98
252,731,claspada,3.04,"The aroma is a wonderful concoction of wheat and banana, it smells a lot like banana bread, minus the nutty aspect. Some yeast and clove are detectable, with some earthy hops barely detectable.  The taste is actually a little lighter than I anticipated, really much lighter than the nose suggests. There's some decent wheat flavor in the beer and maybe a hint of banana and clove. I'm not in love with the flavor to be completely honest, it's nice and simple, but doesn't leave me wanting more or wanting to give a raving review. A good sessionable summer brew yes, one of the best in the world; I think not.",Bayerische Staatsbrauerei Weihenstephan,Germany,Hefeweizen,98
252,731,greenmonstah,4.43,"500 mL bottle into DFH snifter  A - Massive 3 finger head, white and bubbly. Classic cloudy yellow wheat color, slightly more orange than usual. Bubbles cascade from the bottom in an endless steam. Lacing is epic.  S - Clove, banana and yeast. Sweet malted wheat. Hints of lemon.  T - Malty sweetness and then a bit of spicy clove. A bit yeasty. Phenomenal. Not as much citrus as I prefer in my hefes, though lemon is certainly present.  M - Light to medium body (closer to medium) with a great feel from the carbonation. Leaves the mouth perfectly content, no stickiness or dryness to complain about.  D - Goes down exceptionally well. Just a joy to drink. Easy to quaff and fun to experience. One of the true classics.",Bayerische Staatsbrauerei Weihenstephan,Germany,Hefeweizen,98
252,731,micmillon18,4.92,"Poured from a 12 oz bottle into a Weihenstephaner weizen glass.  A - Pours a large thick, fluffy head that dissipated at a medium pace. Gorgeous hazy golden color that is only amplified by the long slender glass. Looks rather carbonated. Minimal lacing.  S - Cloves, coriander, banana, bubble gum sweetness. Incredible scents. You'd have to have practically no sense of smell in order not to smell whats going on in this beer.  T - Cloves, coriander; the banana and bubble gum are more pronounced in the taste. Tastes so damn good, its so difficult to put the glass down.  M - Light to medium body and I saw medium because there is just so much flavor in this beer. Very smooth. I remember this beer being more carbonated but its possible I got a slightly older bottle.  D - Hefes might be my most favorite style and I've had a vast array both imported and domestic and I therefore can honestly say that this is my number 1. Ayinger and Hofbrau come in a close second. World class hefe, you'll have it once and always go back for more, all others pale in comparison!",Bayerische Staatsbrauerei Weihenstephan,Germany,Hefeweizen,98
252,731,Bouleboubier,4.95,"The best and the worst beers often call for (arguably) ridiculous narrative. This is just one thing that excites me, though, about beer - it's ability to at times be more than just a refreshing, intoxicating, (in various ways) delicious beverage. I'll say what I can about this one - truly the king of the hefes.  I know I'm in for a treat when I pour this into a tall weizen glass and the foamaroma cannot be contained. Angels are singing, trumpets are trumpeting. Tough to empty the whole bottle in one pour as the froth froths forth untamed - head a good 2-3 inches high on average, with the texture and look of soft summer cumulus. Properly poured, the light golden amber color glows like a sunbeam until the yeasty dregs cannonball down through, creating a sunflare swirl before obscuring into a wonderfully murky cloudiness. Yes, we have banana in the aroma, but it's at what I feel is the perfect potency - just in cool essence, not too peely or too fruity. An excellent, fresh baked, yeasty breadiness as well. Hops don't factor here to any degree of note. The taste is bright, lightly lemon meringue, a steady smooth supple maltiness, silky yeast in the finish, with an extremely well integrated, delicate and delightful tartness, thin yet rounded banana notes and only a hint of clove. The flavor of the grain really carries everything here nicely. I would drink this whenever, honestly, but my only knock against it is the degree of dryness in the finish, which I find just the tiniest bit too apparent. Overall, though, it leaves an invigoratingly fresh feeling in the mouth (palate). Just about without equal is this hefe.",Bayerische Staatsbrauerei Weihenstephan,Germany,Hefeweizen,98
252,731,jesperm,4.8,"The bottle was a gusher.  Smells like banana, tin can and a slight smokyness - very much like you'd expect a hefeweissen to smell. Colour as you would expect in a Weissen, medium cloudy, beautiful head though it dissipated a bit too fast. Tin can taste a little too dominate, but a nice furtiness. The wheat malt character is evident. Slighty less body than I like, but i might be due to high carbonation. Nice dryness, very refreshing.",Bayerische Staatsbrauerei Weihenstephan,Germany,Hefeweizen,98

Aroma: citric notes tickle with an undepining of hops to spice up the experience.... Palate: smooth, creamy texture--as pleasant and inviting a hefe as I have encountered... Taste: Clear, crisp profile, as expected from something with a recipe this old; a bit tart, but softly invigorating... Overall: Can anyone argue with the year 1046?

252,731,PDX2LA,4.7,"When I poured this beer into a Weizen glass, I first noticed the impressive head. It was foamy, creamy, frothy, and so on and so on. There are so many adjectives to describe it, but simply put... it is the most impressive head I've ever seen on a Hef. When I took a sniff, I noticed a nice fruity aroma. As far as the taste, I got the banana flavor and a few other flavors that I still can't put my finger on. The flavor is definitely not as pronounced as a Paulaner, but maybe that makes it a less polarizing Hef. This beer is also extremely refreshing and surprising crisp and light. Overall, I'd say this beer is a great beer that is best drunk on it's own. That way, I can savor every last drop.",Bayerische Staatsbrauerei Weihenstephan,Germany,Hefeweizen,98
252,731,Satchboogie,4.53,"Bomber (1 pint, .9oz), bottled on 6/10/10, poured into my wheat beer glass. (Reviewed in October)  A: Beautiful dark golden color, hazy from all the yeast. Forms a MASSIVE 3-finger foamy white head that is about as inviting as it gets. The head seems to last forever and has good lacing.  S: Dark ripe fruit (very sweet), lots of bright floral yeast, banana, and spices. alcohol esters are present in a very nice way.  T: The banana shines in this one, without overpowering the rest of the flavors. It's a fairly complex mix of sweet dark fruits, floral yeast, and nice esters. It's really well balanced, not too sweet nor to strong, just mellow enough to be really refreshing.  M: Very full body for a wheat beer, crisp mainly due to the light, champagne like carbonation. Has a clean wet finish with a pleasant mellow aftertaste.  D: This is a great wheat beer and would be a 5 for drinkability if it wasn't quite as full body. On a hot summer day it might be hard to drink more than one of these. Other than that, I can drink this all day long on a nice cool summer day.",Bayerische Staatsbrauerei Weihenstephan,Germany,Hefeweizen,98
252,731,EwaldEichstaett,4.33,"Perfect cloudy Weißbier. If you pour it properly, you get to watch the Hefe drift down to the bottom of the glass and cloud the beer as it goes.  The smell of this reminds me of sweet bread, bananas and yeast. The malt is prominent and just by the smell you will know this is a full bodied beast of a beer.  It tastes thick and heavenly, big malty mouthfeel with hints of earth, spice and bananas. It is essentially a perfect example of the Weißbier style. It is essentially a delicious bottled meal, flüssiges Brot!  I am still partial to a few other beers; however, this is one of the best that you can find abroad.",Bayerische Staatsbrauerei Weihenstephan,Germany,Hefeweizen,98

I have tried every one that I can lay my hands on and I would rate the Weihenstephaner as my favorite.  A cloudy look and heavy feel, but very drinkable. I am burned out on the light/summer-style wheat beers, but this one is as enjoyable as ever.  P.S. If you like this one, you should also try the Dark Hefeweizen -- it is heavenly.",Bayerische Staatsbrauerei Weihenstephan,Germany,Hefeweizen,98
252,731,Soonami,4.65,"Weihenstephaner Hefeweissbier is a study in understated excellence. The beer is very well balanced that is great all-around. I tried the beer two ways, I poured most of it in my glass without the yeast, drank half and then roused up the yeast on the bottle and poured some of that into my glass to compare. I think I like the clear beer better.  The beer is a bright, lemon rind yellow without the hefe--with it turns a cloudy straw. The smell is lemony and bananay, and the yeast adds a very distinct spicy clove aroma. The beer tastes lighter and more delicately fruity without the yeast, but spicier with a little bubblegum with. The mouthfeel is smooth, but I think it could use a bit more body. Very drinkable with just a bit of sweetness and hop bitterness to give it some beer character.",Bayerische Staatsbrauerei Weihenstephan,Germany,Hefeweizen,98

S - In my 500ml Weizen glass, I don't get much of an aroma from this beer. Odd.  T - This is unexpected. I'm getting smokiness and a bit of a Band-Aid flavor. No sign of bananas or pineapples or other fruits as mentioned in others' reviews. Bad bottle? Points off for Band-Aids.  M - Good level of carbonation. A bit thin.  D - Despite the Band-Aid flavor, which is pretty subtle, I think I could drink this again, if only to see if I got a bad bottle, but maybe just because the smokiness is not intolerable (I am normally not a smoke fan).",Bayerische Staatsbrauerei Weihenstephan,Germany,Hefeweizen,98

So much going on and diffrent flavors and characters and the beer warms a little.  Mouthfeel-Medium bodied and slightly carbonated, a nice easy and smooth drink.  Drinkablity- Very easy to drink, Especially if it were warmer out, the perfect summer beer but great to drink anytime.

Tastes of bananas and cloves again, but not as sweet as the smell promised. There's also a lemony tartness there that would be more welcome if there were more sweetness to cut through.  The feel is fantastic - creamy and smooth yet light on the tongue.  Not too potent and a wonderful feel. If it were just a little sweeter it would be my favorite hefeweizen but it's just edged out by New Glarus' Dancing Man.

Cloudy enough to keep the light out, but just light enough that you can see the ever present bubbles rising to the top to form a monster of a white, cloudy head.  Smells like a Belgian. Full of cloves and coriander, and maybe even some orange peel as well.  It tastes like a Belgian too, though the flavors are a bit weaker due to the wheat keeping everything in check.  This is a smooth beer, even with the spicy flavors. For the type, it's about as smooth as I've had. It's medium bodied and while not sweet, it's just sweet enough to round out all the flavors.  I don't know how you go wrong with this beer. It's got everything you want.

S - Huge banana notes, along with cloves, nutmeg, cinnamon, and plenty of yeasty bread. The aroma fills the room once poured. One of my favorite styles in this category, and this is absolutely one of the best-smelling beers in its style, if not THE best.  T - Almost, but not quite, as great as the aroma. Less of the banana and more of the spice, with the nutmeg and cinnamon flavors out in front. Malty biscuit flavors lurk around the edges. Zero detectable alcohol, as expected for this style.  M - Reasonably full but still light and effervescent. Great carbonation. A bit of a dry finish.  D - It doesn't weigh me down, and it's on the edge of being very sessionable. One of those beers that I could sit and drink all day.  O - For me this is the standard-bearer for the style. It's not quite perfect in every category, but overall this towers above most other hefes.

Smells include bananas, pepper, spices, esters--apples/pinapple, cloves...all kinds of wheat beer goodness.  Taste is magnificent...mirrors the smells and then some. Hefeweizen is not normally my first choice in beer styles, but this one is an exception. Delicious malt beginning with a hint of nutmeg and sweetness transitions to tropical fruit (see smells) followed by an intriguing array of spices in the finish--pepper and cloves. I swear I taste banana bread in there as well.  Mouthfeel is smooth and effortless. Perfect level of carbonation. Rolls over the mouth with a wide spectrum of flavors.

Not an overly stong banana odor, just pure and well blended.  taste; the flavor is just a typical Weißbier but better blended and purer than most others. Yeasty flavors are more complex but still pretty typical. Not too impressed, this one is good but I can think of a few others that have a better more complex taste. Really a nice raw barley flavor in the aftertaste, that is what I like best of it.  mouthfeel; moderate thickness from the cream feel. Carbonation is very fine and gentle.  drinkability; a very delicious beer that is smooth without sacrificing flavor, drinkable to say the least....well done!  This is a very good beer but to be honest, I don't know what all the hype is about. Without a doubt this is a step above Franziskaner and Paulaner, but only a baby step. It taste from the bottle like lower quality Weißbier taste on tap in Bavaria. Well done there, but this beer never stood out from the rest to me. Many smaller, lesser known breweries in the Bavarian country side make equal if not better examples of this style not to mention Schneider. Reminds me of Stiegl that I've had on tap in Austria.",Bayerische Staatsbrauerei Weihenstephan,Germany,Hefeweizen,98
252,731,mkorpal,4.13,"Poured from a 500ml bottle into a globe glass. Pours a golden to slightly amber color with a solid head of about 2 fingers. The head will stick around for most of the beer, leaving some lacing on the side of the glass. Beer is somewhat cloudy as one might expect.  Smell is as one might expect from a hefe as well. Banana and clove esters dominate the nose, with just the slightest hint of hop bitterness. Yeast also lend a bit of breadyness to the nose.  Taste is more forward on the clove, and a little less on the banana, although it still plays a huge part.  Mouthfeel is pretty heavy for the beer, mostly because of the wheat. These styles of beer tend to be heavy anyway.  Drinkability is a bit lower for me. By the end, the wheat just makes it a chore to drink by the end. Taste is still great though. Also, I had a few sips that had a bit of a metallic feel, but I'm not quite sure if I was just going crazy a bit. All in all, I did enjoy my beer, and for the price, it ends up a good deal.",Bayerische Staatsbrauerei Weihenstephan,Germany,Hefeweizen,98

Nice lacing.  Smell: Banana, clove and yeast with a hint of lemon. What a hefeweizen should smell like.  Taste: Typical wheat up front followed by banana and clove in the middle and ending with a mix of spices, phenols and a hint of lemon. Aftertaste is dry and earthy with a very slight hoppy bitterness.  Mouthfeel: Medium-bodied with a high amount of carbonation. A little prickly, in a good way.  Drinkability: Excellent drinkability. This is the perfect summer beer.  Overall: Excellent beer overall. I don't think wheat beers get any better than this.

The taste is very nice, and quite spicy with lots of clove and pepper and fruitiness. In particular you get some banana, apple, pear, and a definite yeasty breadiness.  Mouthfeel is excellent. Medium bodied and quite creamy, carbonated well, but not overly carbonated. Thicker than most hefeweizens I have had.  Drinkability is great, could definitely throw back quite a few of these.",Bayerische Staatsbrauerei Weihenstephan,Germany,Hefeweizen,98

252,731,Vdubb86,4.4,"Served in a Weihenstephan weizen glass  On-tap for Oktoberfest at Schnitzel Platz in Glendale Height, IL  I was able to steal some of this from my lovely and wonderful girlfriend during our most recent dining experience. This was a beautiful cloudy golden color with a stiff frothy white foam head. the aroma was of citrus and banana with the bready hint of wheat without being to overbearing. The hop aroma was nicely balanced with the malt and wheat. The taste was rather similar to the aroma, but the breadiness was much more pronounced in the flavor and the citrus really came through very strongly. The mouthfeel wasn't too sticky for a Hefe and I felt that it was rather pleasant. There wasn't too much sweet or savory flavor for this brew. It was right on point. One of the best Hefes on Earth to relax and drink down as much as possible.",Bayerische Staatsbrauerei Weihenstephan,Germany,Hefeweizen,98
252,731,bobhits,3.91,"Explosive amounts of carbonation creates as much head as you can handle. Huge thick fluffy white head. Golden straw colored body with carbonation exploding up the glass. Not sure what else you can do with this style...it's still a thin bodied opaque wheat beer so this isn't say THAT much.  The nose is of bananas, pears, bubble gum...what would you expect form a hefe? The what aroma finishes things off quickly. Nothing special.  Well, damn. This is amazing. A sweet banana pear bubble gum malt profile that's then turns to a slight hop profile which then dies leaving a what/vanilla finishes that's amazingly dry yet not that off putting wheat flavor that many wheat based beers do.  The carbonation helps make this beer feel thicker and creamier, but you can still tell it's a hair thinner than I'd ideally love.  Oddly enough it's a touch thicker feeling than a summer beer wants to be. That said you could put 3-4 of these away on a nice summer day without a second thought.

S-Aroma is amazing and I'm not sure why I don't give this a 5. It may be spot on for the style, which is not a favorite of mine. If I find something better I will be flummoxed. Wheat malts, banana and clove from the yeast, and hop fruitiness.  T-Banana and cloves from the yeast. Slight caramel and some citric hoppiness. This is very nice.  M-Smooth and nicely carbonated. Refreshingly crisp and clean on a summer like day in early autumn.  D-This is the very best Hefeweizen I have ever enjoyed and may be the truest presentation of any style I have experienced. This must be extraordinary as it is the only beer with less than a 7% ABV in the top 20 beers on planet earth on this website. My only wish is that it was more readily available and affordable.

Pretty powerful smell here. Lemon, banana, hops...it's all here in a nice lil bouquet.  Ohh banana with a bite at the end. Shit, it bit me! Time to bite it back! *burrrrp* Feels like it runs the gamut of taste with some sweetness, sour and a bit spicy at the tip.  Medium body feel that boasts a welcoming after-taste. I love beers that produce a healthy belch, and this one produces an alright one with a foamy aftermath that could spoil that hot date of yours. I feel it in my jaw muscles.  Chug! Well, you could, but this is a better beer to relax with, as it scores highly in every area. As long as you can pronounce the name with confidence, this could become a highly lovable beer by all.

Some traces of foam leave themselves on the glass as the beer is drunk down. Nice hazy dark straw to light gold color.  Aroma of clean lemon banana, light hint of cloves. Taste bit of sweet lemon citrus, yeast, banana, and grape soda note. Midway the carbonation and wheat give a twangy feel on the tongue. Nice yeasty wheat bread, banana custard, and cloves on the finish with just the barest touch of bitterness in there.  Medium-high carbonation tickles the tongue nicely. Also the yeasty sediment gives it extra body and mouthfeel.  So tasty and delish! So very drinkable, a classic and an all-time favorite!

Aromas of citrus and clove, lots of bready yeast aroma, and tons of banana on this one. Smells delicious. Very fruity flavors, with lots of banana, orange, clove, a touch of spice and bitterness on the finish. Nicely carbonated, leaves you wanting another sip almost immediately. This beer is very drinkable, great for for a hot day. I'm not much of a hefeweizen person to be honest, but this beer was just a perfect example of a bavarian hefeweizen.

Lacing seems heavy and cascades down the glass.  S: Sweet banana bread hits your nose, combined with some clove and holiday spice. Aroma is propelled by the bubbling carbonation and alcohol volatiles.  T: The taste follows the nose with with lightly spiced banana bread up front. The banana esters are quite distinct and combine nicely with the bready, pastry-like malt-backbone. Although this isn't a modern 'big' beer, the flavors are loud and pronounced, making their balance all that more discernible. There's really no alcohol in the flavor, but there is just enough hop zest to counter the sweet profile, leaving the finish surprisingly dry and clean.  M: Full bodied for the ABV, and the carbonation is perfect. It feels like you're cleansing your mouth with each swallow. Really, the carbonation is perfect. I can't remember where the carbonation complexion stood out in a beer more than this.  Drinkability and notes. Easily one of the best Hefeweizens I've tried. I couldn't stop drinking this. Even if you're typically not someone that goes for that Bavarian banana-clove thing, or wheaty ales in general, the balance of this beer makes it impossible to dislike. With the 5.7% ABV, this is going to be my new daytime/session brew.",Bayerische Staatsbrauerei Weihenstephan,Germany,Hefeweizen,98

T - An ""in your face"" taste of banana, with a citrus backbone. Very well blended together.  M - Near medium bodied  D - You'll have no problem drinking this on a summers day or with a meal.

Somewhat sweet citrus right up front that becomes balanced in the middle and just slightly bitter at the end. Round it out with some banana through the back half of the mouth and a bit of clove right at the finish. Very smooth flavoured.  Medium bodied with carbonation just a little less coarse than the average for this style. This is possibly king of the easy drinking/refreshing brews.

Wheat, cloves, lemon, and a touch of bubblegum.  T: Following the nose, has a delicious wheat and bready base. Bananas provide a sweet flavor profile, with a touch of yeasty funk. Lemon and cloves prickle the tongue at the end of the flavor, working well with the carbonation to produce a refreshing effect.  M: Light-bodied, high carbonation -- good for the style, providing a clean and crisp finish. Slightly watery.  D: The gold standard for the style.

The dark golden section abruptly transitions into a huge white foamy head.  S: Banana and cloves upfront with a hint of fresh coriander.  T: It almost tastes like some sort of off-banana flavored bubble gum. It has a ""fresh"" fruit aftertaste as opposed to a ""rotten"" fruit one that I sometimes associate with this style.  M: Mild tanginess, but absolutely no pucker factor! Smooth and refreshing.  D: To date, the most drinkable Hefeweizen I've ever tasted. The funnest part was devouring the last bit. The head, which stuck around throughout the session like a co-dependent dog in heat, stayed at least an inch thick at all times.

T - The flavours aren't as strong as the scent implies, but they are delicious. The cloves come off the top, but are not overwhelming. Sweet orange citrus zest, faint banana and a bubble gum finish. Very nicely balanced and flavourful offering.  M - No complaints in this department either, light, bubbly, wet and smooth. A tad more carbonation feel on the tongue might help bump it into the top range.  D - Delicious hefe, and one of the best I've tried to date.

This is one of the best looking beers I've seen and is very enticing. Smells of banana and spice. Very sweet aroma. Taste is also very sweet, with the taste of the spices up front and a powerful banana and bubblegum aftertaste. Awesome. It's a little bit on the lighter side in terms of mouthfeel.

S- Strong aromas of banana, clove, and peppery spice. Bready, yeasty and a little citrusy as well.  T- This is probably the strongest flavor of banana that I've had in a Hefe and it's present throughout. All the other aromas mentioned in the nose are present in the taste, but they're toned down. There's a hint of bubblegum that comes in at the middle and rounds this out.  M- A light-medium body. Carbonation isn't over the top, but just enough to tingle the tongue.

Initial pour yields a one inch frothy/tight white head which after a moment dies down to about a quarter inch. Retention is great, but not much lacing to speak of.  S: Smells of bananas with a hint of bubblegum and apples right away. Not as super banana rich as some of the hefewiezens I have tried though. There is also a sweet smell that is akin to creamed corn, and a touch of bread.  T: The taste is straight forward bananas and corn bread. Then hints of green apples, bubblegum, and een less pronounced cloves. Just the slightest touch of leafy hops if you pay close attention.  M: Mouthfeel has a medium body with plenty of carbonation making it a bit dry. It is fairly sweet with a touch of both tartness and spice.  D: Easy as water to knock back.

T- The banana and spice notes take over in the beginning, with a crisp, cracker-like wheat finish.  M- Nice creaminess with good carbonation. Surprisingly rich.  D- Pretty good, though some rather big flavors might cut me off after a few.  This is definitely a good beer, but maybe one I don't sufficiently appreciate due to a style bias.

Head takes a while to evaporate and leaves copious amount of lacing on the glass.  You can pick out the banana and spice when opening the bottle. Very nice. Taking further whiffs gives some wheat and a small bit of yeast.  Some clove and spice up front, along with a light wheat taste. Banana comes through in the end. Clove and banana linger in the aftertaste. Smooth finish. Nice and refreshing.  I think this has supplanted my favorite Hefeweizen. Sadly, this isn't available locally.

The king of Hefeweizens with its white pillow crown.  S: The pleasant banana like aroma welcomes the drinker to this brew. Very natural wheat and clove. Very earthy.  T: The flavor is refreshing. A lot going on here for a style which many brewers don't put enough time into. Thankfully Weihenstephaner had almost 1000 years of time to get this one right. Banana like flavors, clove and spice, slight bitterness on the finish.  MF: Mouth feel is great for the style, but a little light and watery at times. Carbonation saves this brew and gives it a fuller feel.  D: Drinkability is definitely a 5. No where can you find a brew that you can drink multiple ones, is refreshing, and at the same time is complex and big enough to satisfy the pallet.

S: The standard of Hefe, a clove on the front with a layered spice inter mingling with banana and slight citrus notes. This again is true to style. T/M:: As the nose suggests clove and banana, with a nice subtle spice finish, this brew has a powerful off taste, that I think makes it what an all star it really is. The mouthfeel is smooth and lingering tastes stand up to how the perfect style should represent. Mellow, cool and calm this is a winner. I am getting a strong ABV sensation, but for the 5.4%, I feel that from the taste I would expect more. D: I cannot put the glass down, this is a goto hefe. I would want it to have a bit more ABV for the intensity of the taste, as some others of the Wisconsin offering have the same varied taste intensities have more, but that it what makes it a drinkable beer.

Taste is sweet wheat and honey with a touch of spice in the middle and then finishes a bit sweet and creamy yet surprisingly neutral. Quite a carbonated and mouthfeel is medium bodied.

S: Bread, banana, very fruity, sweet and a little bit bitter at the same time.  T: banana, lasting bitter flavor, gassy feel in mouth, anisette, for a 5.4 ABV you can taste a little bit of the alcohol, watery.  Overall it's a very refreshing and inviting beer that you can knock a couple in no time, it's one of the best weissbier that I have tried.",Bayerische Staatsbrauerei Weihenstephan,Germany,Hefeweizen,98
252,731,GeoJ,4.83,"First off, I will admit I am a total newbie to the world of wheat beers, so forgive any hyperbole I might bestow upon this particular brew. The reviews piqued my interest, and I was lucky enough to find this at my local ""beer and wine"" shop.  I'm pretty much always been a Pilsner guy, and never really gave much thought to trying any wheat beers.  Simply put, this is the most delicious beer I have ever experienced in my life. I've found all of the A and A+ reviews spot on, regarding the aroma, flavor, and complexities. Every sip was a ""close your eyes and savor"" experience.  After the first bottle I was so thrilled I went out and bought a proper weizen glass. And it did, indeed, make the beer even that much more enjoyable. (Especially with a nice platter of mild veal sausage!)  If there is any hefe out there that someone thinks is more delicious than this, please let me know and I'll give it a try.  This would be very, very hard to beat.",Bayerische Staatsbrauerei Weihenstephan,Germany,Hefeweizen,98
252,731,cnally,4.87,"How do they do it? Make it perfect in Germany, and ship it...and it still tastes perfect here in the states.  The color is a crisp clear gold and a frothy white head bubbles up nicely and results in decent lacing.  The aroma is a bouquet of clove and banana, staples of the hefeweizen, but taken to a more intense level. A punch of grains and yeast.  Tastes like a caramel covered toasted banana. Minus the sugary stuff. Just so powerfully balanced, the bitterness barely slides in with the finish, but the flavor really relies on its fruitiness and toasted grain.  A slightly watery mouthfeel, balanced but a little lacking in the crispness from some other beers in this style.  I have to say, I think this is one of my desert island beers. Easily the most drinkable hefe ever, if not the most drinkable and delicious beer I have ever had, ever.",Bayerische Staatsbrauerei Weihenstephan,Germany,Hefeweizen,98
252,731,Kinsman,4.59,"Poured from bottle into pint glass, no noticeable freshness date.  Appearance is a golden yellow body capped by a foamy white head. Hefe's are always described as being cloudy since they are not filtered, but I've found this to be a bit clearer than most Hefe's.  Aroma is oh so sweet and spicy. Initially there is a bit of a banana-yeasty presence quickly overcome by a stronger clove aroma. A soldid wheat malt body gives a bit of bready note.  The taste pretty much matches the aroma. Sweet banana followed by some spice, with bready malt notes on the finish. Really a quite enjoyable flavor profile, making obvious as to why this beer is such a classic.  Mouthfeel is light, smooth, and a little bit bubbly, but not overly so. Overall, an amazing hefe that pretty much defines the style. This beer has been around forever, and it deserves all of its praise.",Bayerische Staatsbrauerei Weihenstephan,Germany,Hefeweizen,98

I had to work a little to smell the banana lingering in the background.  T: The taste is of clove, wheat, and banana. It does not taste as light as the smell would suggest. Quite refreshing!  M: Light-medium body and smooth.  D: Very drinkable. One of my favorite session beers, especially in the summer time.",Bayerische Staatsbrauerei Weihenstephan,Germany,Hefeweizen,98

Cloudy, hazy gold in color with a touch of oranginess, beautiful dense solid milk colored head. Sweet smelling malt with banana and clovetouch of yeasty lemon. Taste is pure hefe-weizen gold,minimal hops detected with a slightly fruity dryness. Mouth is thick but slick,kind of light at the same time,very nice.

T: Slightly dry, with a tangy orange in the mix that almost comes off like lemon, buttery mild nuts (pecans), bready backbone with a borderline coppery finish. Excellent.

252,731,nataku00,4.68,"Poured from a bottle into a pub glass. Pours a hazy orange with an initial finger of snowy white head. The head dissipates quickly, and leaves little lacing on the glass. Active carbonation visible at the surface of the glass.  Right out of my fridge (likely ~40°F), hint of banana and citrus, with a little clove and light malt, but overall feint. Aroma does improve when the beer warms up later though.  Taking a sip, lemon peel type bitterness initially, with a little spice and malt later. Finishes very clean and crisp, refreshing. Really cleans your palate and would be excellent paired with spicey food. The carbonation is just perfect in helping to deliver the scent of your beer to your nose while drinking.  An easy drinking hefeweisse, perfect for a session beer, and I can see why this is the highest rated one. No excessive lingering spice or bitterness that's common in other hefe's or Belgian style witbiers, that would affect the food.",Bayerische Staatsbrauerei Weihenstephan,Germany,Hefeweizen,98

A nice pillowy white head (about 1 finger) sits nicely at the top.  S - Great notes of banana and some nice spiciness to it; cloves and some slight coriander aroma. Very nice yeasty, bready aroma as well. Lemon peel is also apparent.  T - Follows the nose nicely but with a bit more clove spice to it. Great combo of the banana, clove and breadiness to this one. Some nice lemon peel flavors make it very refreshing.  M - Nice mouthfeel on this. Could use a little less carbonation in my opinion and perhaps it would be that much better. Overall a ""good"" mouthfeel.  D - Extremely drinkable beer. The low ABV and the combination of flavors makes this one easily a great choice for a hot day. Extremely refreshing and satisfying.",Bayerische Staatsbrauerei Weihenstephan,Germany,Hefeweizen,98
252,731,Whiteweasel,4.55,"Drank from a chalice and poured from a bottle.  A: Gorgeous translucent orange-yellow-goldenrod colour; looks like frosted glass. Nice frothy head, but lacing is minimal and dissipates faster than I would like.  S: Sweet nectar scent brimming with fruitiness (banana, kiwi, peach strawberry, and other tropical fruits) a fresh wheaty maltiness, and a deliciously unmistakable Belgian yeastiness. Deliciously tantalizing; brings the drinker in and excites the senses. Just under perfect.  T: Sweet fruity, yet balanced flabour. Powerful/distinct clove and banana with a wide yet still subtle palette of other fruits. Quite wheaty in a pleasant way. Missing the depth of taste that a higher abv would bring, but still DAMN good.  M: I would have loved more booziness, cause I feel the higher abv would bring out more flavours. However, a hefe doesnt usually have that booziness or high abv so I can't really knock it too hard. A little fizzy in the mouth when I might have appreciated a little less. Very very refreshing and satisfying.  D: Good lord, I could and would drink these all night if I could, and I would feel spolied doing it. A rare perfect session beer. 5.4% abv and 100 times its weight in flavour. I'm giving it the rare 5 for drinkability. So effing good.",Bayerische Staatsbrauerei Weihenstephan,Germany,Hefeweizen,98

Poured cold into a chilled weizen glass at 9am, I thought it'd make a good breakfast to start the weekend with.  This cloudy golden yellow brew gives a great frothy white meringue head that forms large peaks and sinkholes as it settles, great 3D stucture. On the nose is a strong dose of dry banana peel, earthy yeast, spicy wheat. The feel is light-moderate bodied with carbonation a bit rigorous and fizzy for the style, not as smooth as I had hoped. Taste is dry banana peel, stale cinnamon, yeast, finishes dry with lingering banana peel astringency. The brew has left some healthy wisps of lace throughout the session.

252,731,ToasterChef,4.82,"Poured from a 500ml bottle into my 500ml Schneider Edel-Weisse glass. I think my cellar may be a bit above the recommended 46-52 degree F temperature, as I was only able to get a portion of the bottle into my glass; a very large white foam head took up most of the glass. The liquid is a darker straw color and has a good amount of tiny bubbles rising within. Once I was able to swirl around the bottle and pour in some of the yeast, the beer took on the appropriate opaque appearance. Lacing is even and beautiful.  The nose has plenty of banana, pepper and wheat. There is a hint of sweetness to the aroma, but it doesn't lead me to believe that this will be too sweet of a beer.  After four pours, the bottle is now empty and the liquid comes up to the .5L line on my glass. I'm ready to take a sip. I can taste plenty of ripe banana, as well as some cloves. There is a flavor that makes think of how raw bread dough would taste. There is some pepper as I swallow, and a brief citrus aftertaste. The fruit disappears quickly and the pepper remains, as does the wheat. This is how a Hefeweisse should taste.  The beer has a light body, but as I swirl it around my mouth, it feels a bit thick. Perhaps it is all the carbonation foaming up? There is some coating, but it isn't sticky. It seems to vanish quickly.  I find this beer to be very drinkable. The alcohol levels shouldn't be a problem for a few rounds, and the flavors are quite inviting. Also, the beer is very refreshing.

S - Light fluffy sweet fruity smells and only the most mild of citrus. Orange peel. A bit of lavender. Some banana peel. Subtle but complex. A freshly baked cake with vanilla icing.  T - Mild wheat and barley flavors set the background for the citrus and estery flavors. Aftertaste has a very tiny alcohol bite too in that it just tickles the tongue gently.  M - Neither loose and watery nor thick and chewy. Pretty much in between but a bit of carbonation gives it a bit of a cotton candy feel in your mouth. In such a way that it just disappears into nothing when it hits your tongue  D - Quite pleasant. A desert beer.

Onto the smell, I'll be back here after 2nd pour.  S - Lots of cloves and bananas! This is some potent stuff. I think Live Oak Hefeweizen had a touch more sweetness...this is all cloves and spices. The belgian yeast/malts definitely shine through.  A2 - The head is pillowy, and soft, and just sits there like a thunderhead...a bulbous thunderhead, on top of the beer. The beer itself is a cloudy golden, but when holding it up to my TV, and wiping the sweat of the glass, I can see the sports commentators. There are some bubbles rising. It's a light golden on the bottom, and a light orange on top. Just a beautiful beer. Beautiful lacing and legs are left after every sip  T - Pretty much follows the nose, but just a tad bit softer than the potency that you get from the smell. Cloves, and bananas, and spices. It's really nice.  M - Slightly creamy at first that leads to light, crisp, refreshing...nice carbonation. Spot on. I have no idea how you can make this any better.  D - What a summer beer.

Nice whipped cream head... about 1.5 inches by the end of the pour.... my wife said it looked like meringue, and it was delicate like it too. The head was at least a 1/2 inch when I finished the 1/2 litre too.  Smells like a hint of banana, wheat, clove and more wheat. Phenolic. Just like a good hefe should be.  Taste was outstanding. Not over the top. Just right. Banana, clove and wheat are evident in the taste as well as the smell.  Feels soft in the mouth... sensuous almost. Nicely carbonated.  Very drinkable.

Flavors are great... a bit of unripe banana and lot of wheat initially comes out then a nice roasted wheat flavor in the back. Seriously amazing here... Definitely not what i was expecting in terms of how round the flavor is, it's full yet crisp. Rolling around in my mouth are tiny bubbles, not unlike a sparkling wine, but the flavor is able to work through the carbonation and in the end you have the strong upfront flavor mixed with an extremely effervescent beer.

S - Everything you've heard; vanilla, banana, clove, lemon....impressive as I usually don't get much in this department. T - As I said, this is usually not my style, but this is pretty impressive. The most prominent flavor, of course, is the banana/clove hit from the yeast, but it's not overwhelming and it's quite well-balanced with the touch of hoppiness that is present. The aftertaste is a mix of faint hoppiness along with a lemon/banana tang that stays around for quite a while. M - The carbonation is pretty incredible; the bubbles are large, but there's so many of them that the impression is one of filling the mouth, which adds to the taste of course. D - On a warm summer day, really could drink a zillion of these; I find myself taking big gulps even during this review.  Have pretty much ignored Weissbiers for a few years, but after this reminder may need to come back to them.

252,731,hayesez,4.72,"This used to be one of my standard beers back in graduate school - what a great beer for hot summers. Absolutely one of the most drinkable beers in the world as there is an amazingly quick and clean finish. Very little alcohol and no bitterness. Had one last night at the Rathskellar in downtown Indianapolis during a friend's ""surprise"" 30th birthday...took a few drinks and looked down to find it empty. Yup, dangerous!  Received in a 22 ounce weizen glass, this hazy orange brew came stock with a thick, sticky, three finger head that was doing its best to look like wallpaper on the side of my glassware. It looks like a heavy murky beer, but turns out to be more in the medium-bodied range.  A strong smelling beer when compared to others of the same style. Has the telltale hefeweizen malty-wheatiness, in addition to a spicy banana, and a bit of clove. That yeasty hefeweizen smell gets the saliva flowing!  Yup, still an outstanding interpretation. Weihenstephan claims to be the world's oldest brewery - well, I suppose you don't stay around this long unless you brew good beer. A nice crisp beer, this one is built to be put away quickly. Definitely the hefeweizen yeast, banana, and wheat flavors that the nose suggests. The thing that separates Weihenstephaner from the others is the boldness of the flavor. I certainly appreciate a good wheat beer, but this one is definitely one of the best. The beer bursts with flavor in each drink, but disappears rather quickly at the end, making it extremely drinkable. Still one of my favorites.

252,731,BeerImmediately,4.28,"11.2oz bottle into tall weizen glass at 45 degrees.  Pours with a half-glass full of sea foam-like white head over a semi-opaque, dirty golden body. Plenty of effervescence. Decent lacing.  Aromas are rich in ripe banana, clove-like phenols, wheaty yeast, and some coconut sweetness in the back.  Pretty smooth across the palate. Banana flavor comes through the strongest, with a nice balance of spices, light lemony tartness, and whole grain bread.  Smooth and creamy mouthfeel, with just a touch of carbonation - was hoping for a little more.  Very easy drinking beer. Nice balance of flavors, and smooth Mouthfeel. Although this particular one seemed to lack some of the top-notch characteristics that I've come to enjoy in the Weihenstephaner Hefe Weissbier.",Bayerische Staatsbrauerei Weihenstephan,Germany,Hefeweizen,98
252,731,HoppyMcStout,4.5,"First review in quite a while...  Pours the typical cloudy golden yellow and with a hell of a lot of head which recedes fairly quickly. A thin but formidable layer of bubbles lingers on the top for the duration of my drinking. Banana and clove as you would expect in the nose, but with a mild peppery spiciness. The taste is subdued. By that I mean it is much milder than other hefes. Not sweet, but rather light and finishes pretty clean. This makes this brew so very drinkable. Reminiscent of Live Oak.",Bayerische Staatsbrauerei Weihenstephan,Germany,Hefeweizen,98

Appearence - 5.0 - hazy golden orange color  Smell - 5.0 - hints of citrus with some nice spices and even a little bananna mixed in  Taste - 5.0 - Wonderful! It was sunny and in the mid-high 80's the day I tasted this beer and wow, was it refreshing. the perfect beer to sit and enjoy on a nice day  Mouthfeel - 5.0 - Very smooth with no bitter aftertaste. Every sip actually leaves you wanting to take another.  Drinkability - 5.0 - Had I not had to leave shortly after trying this beer I probably would still be sipping on one right now. This is hands down the best Hefeweizen I have ever tried and is now my favorite beer. You can enjoy several of these in a party environment or just at your leisure without getting too tipsy given the average ABV%",Bayerische Staatsbrauerei Weihenstephan,Germany,Hefeweizen,98

It has a hazy golden body, not quite turbid, with a large cap of foam that persists for quite some time.  S - Banana, clove, small melon, and pale malt (not sweet wheat?) are the staples of the aroma. It is not hugely complex or pungent, but it is well-balanced and easily accessible.  T - Pale malt first, banana nut bread, sweet in flavor profile, but not actually tremendously sweet. This beer is actually pretty simplistic. Though I love Weihenstephaner and it pains me to say it, there are much nicer Hefeweizens out there, such as Schneider Wiesen Edel-Weisse or my beloved New Glarus Dancing Man.

Perfect cloudiness. After I swirl the yeast in the bottle and pour it in, a healthy head sits on top. The carbonation feeds the head for some time. What I like the most about this beer is the beautiful, cloudy orange color. Text-book hefeweizen.  S: Cloves, banana, and some lemon rind characteristic in the nose. I do get hints of sulfur as well. Some breadiness from the yeast as well. Not terribly aromatic, but pretty good.  T: Banana and clove are definitely there. I get a touch more banana in this than in others in the style. The clove is present, but a little lighter. Lots of bready wheat character. A very slight hint of vanilla. I do get some bitter, lemon rind character in the end, along with a hint of sulfur. It doesn't make the beer bad, but knocks a few points off for me.  M: Light bodied. Crisp and highly carbonated on the tongue. The creamy head makes the beer seem thick and creamy at first, but in the end it finishes dry and crisp.  D: A really solid Hefeweizen. It really looks phenomenal. I will admit that I was expecting more out of the flavor and nose for this iconic beer. It may be that I didn't get a fresh one.

252,731,AWolfAtTheDoor,4.38,"Not my first bottle of this, but figured I should get around to reviewing it. Have also had on tap in Munich FWIW.  I always get a huge head when I pour this beer. My beer fridge is set to the cold side, so perhaps that is the culprit. None the less once it subsides I get a nice little layer of snow white foam throughout the session. Color is hazy that is bright gold on the sides, and gets darker towards the center (since more light has to travel through it, it gets darker).  Anyways, I've never gotten much smell out of wheat beers. So not much was to be expected. I think I smell wheat, and a hint of cloves.  Now taste: It's gentle and refreshing. Nice Hint of bananas, cloves, a bit of wheat. This is what a hefeweissen should be. I've had countless bad American interpretations of wheat beers. Brewers tend to get banana happy, or clove happy, or citrus happy (in a wheat beer, really?).  Mouthfeel is great. Smooth and reasonably carbonated. The warmer the beer gets, the more the carbonation subsides.  I have not found any American brewers who can do a true to the style Hefeweissbier HALF as good as this. You morons hear me?

I was excited when I poured this beer, when a beer is poured in a movie it looks like this. Weihenstephaner Hefeweissbier (wow, I'm not typing that again) pours a clear beautiful amber color, with two and a half fingers worth of head. There's some decent lacing as well.  The smell of this beer is a wonderful concoction of wheat and banana, it smells a lot like banana nut bread. I like banana nut bread.  The taste is actually a little lighter than I anticipated, sort of watery. There's some decent banana flavor in the beer and maybe a hint of clove. I like the flavor, it's nice and simple, but how is this the best in the world? It's an amazing session beer, but I don't see it beating Boulevard Wheat or Goose Island 312.

Aroma is perfect with fantastic banana subtlties and lemon peel and melon rind. Has a touch of bubblegum on the aroma and it's so fresh smelling. The taste is perfect. Really has that wheat balance with the intense lemon and banana combo that leaves this the perfect hefeweizen. Also has a great mouthfeel. Perfect carbonation and really has a great aftertaste.

Indeed there is citrus apparent straight off, but it's more subdued than one may expect. However, there is a fair amount of spicy clove here which takes over almost immediately. A bit of smacking sweetness lingers around during and after the swallow. Quite clean in the aftertaste...not a lot remains.  Where some hefe's attempt to go overboard in their flavors, this one is a tad more restrained.

(as a side note, wow the yeast really drops out of suspension quickly--five minutes and it's in a dense disc at the bottom of the glass!)  m 4 body is about medium with ample carbonation. not as silky smooth and finely bubbled as i was expecting (7 bridges brewpub managed more of that sort of texture), but certainly acceptable. a bit of swishing between the jowels brings out some creamyness. mouthfeel is probably the one department where weihen truly edges out the discoing dude.  d 4-4.5 not my first time trying the king of the hefeweizens, and i am yet to be wowed. refreshing, good, and probably one of the 3 best hefes i've had (NG, Hacker, this--and i'm aware i may have overrated the Hacker and will have to retaste), but i can now go back to the wonderful 6.99/6-pack dancing man with no lingering thoughts that i'm settling.

The barely flavor somewhat reminds of oatmeal. The yeast flavor is phenomenal. Its kind of sweet.

252,731,Agold,4.45,"This beer is impressive to look at. It is a light cloudy golden color and pours with a creamy billowy head. There is nice lacing as well for this one. It smells very light, with notes of yeast most prevalent, but banana character shines through as well. The taste is of banana with some spices (cloves maybe) coming through. The carbonation seems a bit too aggressive at times but overall done very well. This is by far the best example of a Hefeweizen i have ever had.",Bayerische Staatsbrauerei Weihenstephan,Germany,Hefeweizen,98

S- Smells really nice, exactly what you would expect of this style. Wheat, yeast, and the banana and light spiciness. I also detected a smoky burnt wood aroma. Aromas combine together very well in a balanced mix.  T- Tastes similar to how it smells, but definitely not as bold in flavor as I would have expected. Very nice balance again overall.  D- Goes down easy with a light body, yet with plenty of flavor. Carbonation is light.

The fact that it stays intact in spite of its seemingly fragile constitution is truly miraculous. The liquid is a cloudy deep straw color. I get mineral on the nose, mild dessert, and clove and herbal qualities. Very smooth texture. Taste is where the banana and golden plum characteristics come into the forefront.

Lots and lots of carbonation with this one. You have to be careful pouring it or you're likely to get ridiculous amounts of head.  Smell- You get a light malt smell with a lot of banana and clove flavors coming through.  Taste- Just like the smell. Light malt flavor. Almost bready. But the real standout is the yeast esters. Beautiful banana and clove flavors coming through. The thing I really like about Weihenstepan is you get a lot of that banana like flavor where as most hefes it seems like the clove dominates. Perfect balance with the malt however. It's not like Well's banana bread beer. It's very subtle, delicate flavor.  Mouthfeel- Very smooth. Feels very light in your mouth. It's nice.  Drinability- Absolutely no hang ups on this one. Goes down perfectly. I could drink these all day.  Weihenstephan is in my opinion is not only the best hefe you can find, but the best wheat beer as well. Just a beautiful beer. Definitely in my top 3 overall beers I've ever had.",Bayerische Staatsbrauerei Weihenstephan,Germany,Hefeweizen,98

Mild banana and clove flavor, with an extra bit of sweetness from the banana in there too...tastes awesome. I feel like theres some malt in there too...very interesting flavors.  M- the feel is really good. Theres a real nice character to it...as I mentioned earlier, almost seems a little malty. Adds a lot to the body  D- totally drinkable.

252,731,Shuffledaddy,4.43,"I had this beer on tap at Haus Murphy's in Glendale. I was intrigued because the server highly recommended it and told me it was the ""original"" German Hefeweizen. I found out the brewery's been around for almost a thousand years so they must be doing something right.  It had a thick, lacy head and a golden cloudy appearance. Smelled of pine, citrus, and cloves. The taste had the typical wheat, banana, clove, and lemon notes you would expect from a German Hefe, but they were remarkably balanced with an extremely clean finish. I think I detected a little bit of apple too (went great with the apple strudel). Mouthfeel was smooth and medium, nothing out of the ordinary. Drinkability was exceptional; I could sip this beer all day long. In fact, it's probably the most drinkable authentic Hefeweizen I've tried.  Verdict: A very good Hefe. For now, Paulaner is still my favorite, but Weihenstephan is a close second and I will certainly have it again soon. Plus, it's the perfect liquid companion for the brutal Arizona heat.",Bayerische Staatsbrauerei Weihenstephan,Germany,Hefeweizen,98

Smell: Strong wheat and yeast smells, backed up by strong banana and clove. Some very slight citrus and grass aromas come through as well.  Taste: Wheaty beginning, with a sweet banana flavor, finishing bready and with hints of apple.  Mouthfeel: Smooth, medium body with light carbonation and a clean, refreshing finish that sticks a bit in the back of the throat.  Drinkability: This is the best hefeweizen I have tasted and it's rightfully the highest rated of its style on this site.

Great aroma of cloves, bananas, and bread. Similar flavors in the taste, and nicely balanced. Light- to medium-bodied and quite smooth, with some nice carbonation.

The aftertaste is a little spicey and a lot sweet - kind of like some sort of spiced candy. No real malt or hops to mention. The mouthfeel is very carbonated and crisp. Super light also.  Notes: I don't typically enjoy this style, but this isn't overly cloying or heavy, so I'm liking it a lot. It's certainly drinkable, I think you could easily put down a couple glasses of this.

Good starting head that leaves no lace. But it does settle in a rocky fashion. There's a touch of cloudiness; the liquid is pale orange-gold.  Strong wheat aroma, but I also detect some buttery smells. The rest of the nose is tart citrus.  Lemony wheat flavor with no bitterness from hop or burnt grains. It has a good mouthfeel with very fine bubbles. There's a sweet finish with a short aftertaste.",Bayerische Staatsbrauerei Weihenstephan,Germany,Hefeweizen,98

M: light body with a good amount of carbonation that had a sweet, grainy, and crisp finish.  D: overall it drank very well and was good across the board and is a perfect example of the style.

252,731,AleWatcher,4.51,"Saw this one on tap at a German food joint in Camdenton, Mo-- Der Essen Platz. I couldn't pass it up. It was served in a big old German stein instead of a Hefe glass...  This poured a very hazy, barely translucent, golden color. The color was a mix between burnt orange around the edges and the color of pyrite towards the center-- fill in the necessary gradient in between. The head, retention, and lace are all excellent per style. I wish they would have used a hefe glass to get a better look at this one, but it still looked great!  Smell is malty- sweet and spicy-- with notes of wheat and yeasty esters. Banana, clove, and a little bubblegum all take turns rocking out. All the flavors are there. Very tasty and surprisingly complex beer. The body is a bit over medium for the style-- but lots of carbonation make this really easy going down. I was amazed how truly enjoyable this beer was.  I normally avoid German beers, especially Hefes... This is one I am glad I ran into on tap!!

Smell -- Yeasty, with notes of banana, bubblegum, lemon, and faint clove oil.  Taste -- Wheat graininess and an abundance of yeasty character and all that it brings: banana, clove, bubblegum. Malt is biscuity and dry, hop character is minimal, and when detectable add a spicy element. Finish is dry and crisp with lemon, bubblegum, earthy yeast, and a bit of clove.  Mouthfeel -- Medium in body, with moderate creamy carbonation. Feels velvety without being heavy. Finish is crisp.  Drinkability -- In the past I have typically shied away from wheat beers, especially hefes, but this beer makes me glad I took the effort to get over my wheat prejudice. World class for certain.

Picture perfect.  Immediately you are overcome by immense banana fragrance, moments later cloves make their presence known and whatever other spice I might discern evaporates under the power of these two allies. First sip is just like first sent--- marvelous banana giving way to cloves in the middle. Finally a subtle hop nibbles on the ankles on the way down.  Creamy, yet dry and dispersant. It takes a bit to build layers of texture, then lingers. In the end, coated with the unmistakable wheat grain and banana creaminess, you can't help but pour another glass. Good thing it comes in + pints.  This is as drinkable as beer gets, and one needs none other on a warm spring or hot summers day.

I pulled it out of the fridge at just about the right temperature, and as I began to pour the liquid gold my heart began to pump expectingly. It poured a beautiful hazy, but resplendent golden into the glass with a stiffly beaten meringuish, rocky head. The head was so stiff looking that if you just noticed that, it would pass of for a vacherin topping. Beneath the stiff and still head, the body was active with bubble jets rising everywhere. The combination and contrast of the body and head was breath taking ! I took a whiff, and it was all you would expect from a hefe - clovey spicy and fruity banana with notes of yeasty bread, raw wheat and citrus. You could smell each characteristic in isolation - such was the great balance in this brew. As the head receded a little (just a little), I took a sip - and was hit by a wave of energy. The beer was bursting with the fruitiness of a banana, the heat of cloves and the sweet and citrus flavours of the wheat. The smell percolated itself beautifully in the taste. This was really what an ideal wheat beer should be like, near perfect. I had never tasted anything quite like it (in the world of wheat ales). It was amazingly refreshing and tasty. Moderate carbonation, medium bodied - was a pleasure to drink. This probably would be my favourite session beer till now, very nice and easy going. Definitely the perfect summer beer.

The smell is typical weizen, but with a potent spice. Some phenolic characteristics and a nice banana finish. Cloves are a little overbearing.  The taste is exceptional, period. This is benchmark weissbier that all bavarian beer fans must try. The flavors are so potent and delicious. I prefer a little sweeter on the tongue but I can't argue with quality. These guys know how to make beer, I guess that's why they have almost been around for a thousand years. A powerful clove with a nice mix of wheat and some sweetness at the end.  Mouthfeel is good, there is a nice light feel with a little carbonation to make it lively and refreshing. Fairly wet and a little clingy at the end.

Excellent.  Fantastic beer. The body is medium light but the flavor is full. the beer never seems stretched across the palate. Lively carbonation as expected. More clove, more wheat, no real fruitiness. towards the end of the glass I get an impression of cinnamon. Near perfect amounts of sweet, bitter, tart. No alcohol noted, no diacetyl or anything else that could be considered a flaw. Absurdly refreshing. I get that the style isn't for everyone, but I haven't found a better example. Sign me up for a few more!",Bayerische Staatsbrauerei Weihenstephan,Germany,Hefeweizen,98

Smell is subdued, wheat and lemony, Tastes subdued with, again, wheat and lemon, fills the mouth with a yeasty yet acidic explosion. Classic hefe weissen.

T- just some wheat malt with some nice german yeast from hell! alil banana taste. clove is light and tolerable.  M- light bodied. nice carbonation.  D- just keep em comming...  Overall- for pretty much hating the clove taste or anything that reminds me of it this brew is what i would compare any other hefe's to. as a homebrewer i've used their (weihenstephaner) yeast and it's truely one of a kind. if it's hot outside or your a hophead like me who just wants a bit of change you have to surely give this one a try!,Bayerische Staatsbrauerei Weihenstephan,Germany,Hefeweizen,98

A small head remained for the duration of the beer. There was some lacing, but it did not stay on the side of the glass.  S: The aroma is yeasty and has a wheat component. I get some sort of fruit, but can't really place it. There is also some spice mixed in. Unfortunately, there was also a slight metallic smell as well.  T: I found the taste to be relatively mild, with tastes of malt and barley and some lemon. The spice from the nose also comes through a little bit.  D/M: This is where this beer shined for me, it was so easy to drink! I had no problem putting down this 16.9 oz beer.

It has been far too long Weihenstephaner, and I have used your yeast more recently than enjoyed your fine brew. It appears in my glass as the sun does when I gaze upon it, light orange and blurry, I believe I see spots. Carbonation, like solar storms, everpresent, never vulgar. There are bananas. Oh, are there bananas. Are there bananas? Bananas and bread, definitely a yeast driven beverage, slight clove and wheaty bread presence. Playful and astute. A smooth and easy delivery. It's like watching Jamie Moyer pitch. You have no idea how he gets it done, but he does and you are astounded. Wheat, then clove, followed by a long and delicate banana aftertaste, which lingers in the memory banks like a hilltop sunset, when the sky breaks for the last half hour, and magic is witnessed.",Bayerische Staatsbrauerei Weihenstephan,Germany,Hefeweizen,98

Aromas combine together very well in a balanced mix.  T- Tastes similar to how it smells, but definitely not as bold in flavor as I would have expected. Very nice balance again overall.

Nose is sweet banana with a hint of the numbing cloves to come. May be the best nose ever, I wish I could do this in my homebrewed versions.  Flavor is hefe-heaven. Serious complexity that hits all the high points of the hefeweizen experience. Esters of banana, clove with cotton candy sweetness. Perfection by the world's oldest brewery.

Wheat, yeast, and the banana and light spiciness (cardamom almost?) all combine together very well in a balanced mix.  Tastes similar to how it smells, but definitely not as bold in flavor as I would have expected. Very nice balance again overall.  Goes down easy with a light body, yet with plenty of flavor. Little carbonation and bubbles which is nice too.  Overall, I would definitely drink another of these if I had it, but I only had one.

Lace clings to the sides of the glass, but slides down quickly. The carbonation gives off a sizzle as it pours.  I smell the wheat and the yeast. There's the typical banana esters tempered by the grassiness of the wheat and a little touch of spice...maybe clove without the astringency.  Very mild in flavor...the smell is stronger than the taste...and slightly sweet, like a good honey-wheat bread. What you smelled is here to a lesser degree. No hops presence on the tongue.  Bright and crisp with a light body and good carbonation.  A great example of the style with all the classic elements.

252,731,BBThunderbolt,4.28,"Poured into Weiss glass. An accidentally over-aggressive pour gave this beer a very tall, fluffy, white head that had great retention and minimal lacing.  The aroma was the proto-typical banana, clove and yeast that defines the style. On the tongue, the above scents translated into flavors that were layered upon the solid, dry and crisp wheat taste.  The body was pleasantly full and tongue-coating, yet wasn't heavy or sticky. Drinkability was as good as it gets. Having multiples of these would be easy and a joy. This would also make a great beer to go with those summertime outside meals.

Freising, Germany Style: Hefeweizen Glass: Weihenstephaner weizen glass  Appearance: Sparkling golden color with a frothy white head of 1"". Lacing is moderate. It looks great, just not arrestingly spectacular.  Aroma: Godly malted wheat sweetness, flecked with mild spices, and streaked with aromatic ribbons of natural lemon.  Taste: As soon as it hit my lips, I knew I would love it. Raw malted wheat and barley, gravely yeast, and hints of lemon pull together beautifully. Hints of clove and nutty flavors (almost like banana bread) coalesce just as the carbonation hits. Despite drinking other brews throughout the night, the taste stuck with me until the next morning (and that was a good thing).  Mouthfeel: Smooth, creamy, and a bit pepper. Drinking this is like quaffing ambrosia. Carbonation is peppy. Light-medium bodied.  Harmony: Perfect harmony. The nutty, spicy flavors are perfectly complemented by the bite of lemon citrus and hearty wheat backbone.

252,731,Chizoad,4.53,"Poured with a relatively moderate, white head that never really went away, with maybe a 1/2 finger remaining throughout the pint. The beer has a pale straw color with only a small hint of cloudiness. Carbonation attached to the side of the glass gave a very nice appearance.  I got a lot of typical wheatbeer aromas, with some bitterness. However, as the beer warmed, it developed a floral bent that eventually was realized in the taste. Top notch.  All of the aromas are amazingly magnified on the palate. It's a very light beer that has layers that just keep evolving. Perhaps the best part is the hoppiness on the finish, which is mild enough to not overwhelm but is the perfect offset to the citrus and wheat up front. This has a different type of bitterness, almost like angostura bitters, and not like a lot of IPAs.  A real sipper for some reason. Pounding this one back just wasn't possible, not that I'd want to do that with a beer this good. Medium body.

Smells bready at first with hints of banana and clove but that turns in to a lot of banana and some clove as it warms. The banana comes through a little in the taste with some wheat tang and a little light malty sweetness. A lot of the flavors seem a little muted. Not sure if this is because of the trip to me or if this is just the beer. The mouth feel is a bit thin at first but kind of filmy coating your mouth in the finish. this was a very refreshing beer and was perfect for the nice warm midday.,Bayerische Staatsbrauerei Weihenstephan,Germany,Hefeweizen,98
252,731,axeman9182,4.38,"A pour into my Duvel tulip yields a beer with an attractive murky orange tint and an absolutely massive white cap with some staying power. The only thing keeping it from a perfect score is that it's a little light on lacing for the style. The nose has a wheat malt base and the clove really outshines the banana hear in terms of yeast byproducts. The taste reveals a little more balance between the two, banana up front melding with the creamy vanilla flavor I find wheat imparts on a beer, and then clove kicks in at the end. There's a good amount of carbonation present, as I would expect, and a certain richness to the beer that I credit at least in part to the wheat. As with any good hefe, this beer is very smooth and eminently drinkable, I plan on making it a regular staple for the next few months.",Bayerische Staatsbrauerei Weihenstephan,Germany,Hefeweizen,98

To me, it couldn't look much better, I graded it a 5.  S Malt, banana and a little estery aroma. It just smells great, so typical of a German Hefe.  T Malty, balanced by hops without being bitter.

A huge presence of corriandor brings along a touch of orange zest with it. Big presence of bananas and wheat. This smells delicious!

This beer begs to be drank on a hot summer day lounging on the deck!  Mouthfeel: Crisp and refreshing. A very fine carbonation.  Drinkability: Yes, I am gonna go get another!  I am not a huge fan of wheat beers. Bought this one on the recomendation from my local beer store. I do not care for the lemon and big citrus. This one is very well balanced, though.

Massive aromas of banana and clove waft from the glass as well as wheat and spice. The traditional phenols and esters are very apparent and well balanced. As the beer warms, the wheat and yeast becomes more pronounced.  The palate is very similar to the nose. The clove and banana are well balanced with the wheat. These characteristics are not quite as intense as in the aroma, but still provide all of the flavor one can handle.  Medium to light in body with high carbonation with a refreshing zest for the palate.

I poured it into a new Duvel snifter, amazing white, with great retention.  S: I smell really good spices, plus some exotic fruits.  T: Wow, you have a good wheat taste, with some citrus notes playing along, I also pick up a slight taste of the exotic fruits in the nose. This is a real hefe.

Smell: I smell lemon, pepper, and maybe even a bit of of cinnamon or cloves similar beers. Very crisp, refreshing smell. Definite thumbs up.  Taste/Mouthfeel: I was initially kind of disappointed with this. Kind of a spicy lemony taste, with some bitter hops. The hops leave a somewhat pleasant tart aftertaste. Again, I did not necessarily like this at first, but the beer changes complexity as it warms, making the hops very nice. Starchy, banana-nut-like taste comes out towards the end.  Drinkability: The complexity of this makes Weihenstephaner pleasant to drink. One of the best!  Overall: Similar to Hacker-Pschorr in appearance and taste, but shares some similarities to witbiers in the latter category.

Beer is a hazy/cloudy yellow-orange light amber color. The classic Hefe look.  Smell: Earthy yeast with hints of banana and clove.  Taste: Very refreshing. Raw grain flavors followed by yeast, some banana again, just a hint of metallic, and a crisp finish.  Mouthfeel: Just a hint of carbonation on the tongue, otherwise goes down nice and easy and coats the whole throat. No lingering aftertaste or feeling on the teeth and palate. Cleansing in a good way.  Drinkability: I think I've been corrupted by so many Russian Imperial Stouts over the past month (moving from my winter stash into spring) and this great beer I loved so much is, well, still very drinkable, but not the wow experience it once was.

A small sniff of yeast is also present.  T: A very sweet, full wheat flavor is the first impression on my palate. There is a nice yeast balance to the sweet fruity and spiciness, followed by a light sour taste on my tongue. The fruity esters and the peppery spice are definitely the dominant flavors, though.  M: There is a very creamy feel while the head is still on top of the body, which quickly transitions to a puckering, spicy feel which is just a bit watery.  D: This is a very pleasant drinker; it would be quite easy to session this beer. It has a light, crisp, tasty character that I will certainly be revisiting in the future. And the price tag is quite kind, to boot.",Bayerische Staatsbrauerei Weihenstephan,Germany,Hefeweizen,98
252,731,KTCamm,4.82,"Poured from the bottle into a Duvel glass - admittedly not the right glass to drink this fine beer, but its what I did.  Pours a brilliant cloudy golden brown with active white foam. Small layer remains and sticks precariously to the sides.  Smells like classic hefe, but like getting a banana bunch shoved up your nasal passages. Clove too. (They all should smell this good)  Taste is a beautiful malty blend with an ever so slight peppery taste, Powerful carbonation that flows through every aspect of the beer. Long finish. My words are not doing this beer justice.  Drinkable, and a hefe standard bearer. Buy some today - a bargain for 3.49.",Bayerische Staatsbrauerei Weihenstephan,Germany,Hefeweizen,98

Cloudy, orange gorgeous head and lacing throughout.Smell: --robust citrus and spice elements come through. Taste--spice, citrus comes through strongly. Mouthfeel is probably one of the best things about this beer. Nearly perfect balance--a small amount of carbonation but it is perfect for the taste and experience. I would have rated this as all ""5s"" but I prefer a little more fruit in my hefeweizens. The clove taste is a little strong for me. That's just a personal preference though. Would try again. Due to major clove taste, it's not as drinkable as some other hefeweizens.",Bayerische Staatsbrauerei Weihenstephan,Germany,Hefeweizen,98

Like the smell but 10x better...yeasty/wheat/cloves/hints of banana (just enough, not overpowering at all) Mouthfeel - Nice. Good amount of carbonation. Drinkability - Not too thick/heavy like Paulaner (IMO), could drink a few in a row.  This is my favorite hefe to date. It seems lighter bodied than most of the other German hefes and is more like the American style hefe's I have had (ie Sierra Nevada's Killerweiss). It tastes great!

Little bit of spice.  m - High carbonation and light body.  d - I thought this was a great hefeweizen. Usually not one of my favorite styles, this might be the best one I've had. Great smell and taste and very drinkable, the only thing that hurts it at all is the high carbonation. Love the fact that it is relatively cheap and easy to get at Whole Foods too.

252,731,OneDropSoup,4.18,"Happy to see this one on-tap at House of 1000 Beers in New Kensington, PA.  Poured into a tulip pint: Cloudy, translucent straw with a finger of frothy white head. Attractive.  Smell of lemon, overripe banana, bubblegum sweetness.  The notes in the smell carry through into the taste with a dry middle & a tart finish. There's a quality here that I've picked up in a lot of wheats that's reminiscent of root beer, a very ""round"" kind of sweetness. Wish I could articulate this better.  Very tingly & active, light & very refreshing.  This is a good beer, even though I'm drinking it in the wrong context -- I feel like I should be in a vernal beer garden, or at the very least outside, instead of in a dark-ish bar watching golf. Still, this is a winner, for sure. Seems like the shortest review I've written, but this one hits all the right spots for a high-quality hefeweizen.",Bayerische Staatsbrauerei Weihenstephan,Germany,Hefeweizen,98

Poured a magnificent head, probably did need the Weizen glass just for that...and it had a nice golden cloudy appearance one would expect from a fine Hefe. The smell is floral and fruity and the taste is wheaty and fruity (but not sick fruity, if you know what I mean). Anyway, this beer has a great mouthfeel and is extremely drinkable. Perhaps I should buy an extra six pack for the spring. Nice.",Bayerische Staatsbrauerei Weihenstephan,Germany,Hefeweizen,98
252,731,eat,4.65,"I've been looking for this one for a while. Glad to find it at the LCBO. Weihenstephaner pours with a beautiful initial head, receding to a solid finger of bright-white, meringue-looking foam. The body is perfectly hazy and a glowing golden-straw colour. Retention and lacing could be better...but I guess my glass could have been a little cleaner as well...  The nose shows all the hallmarks of a great hefe. Astringent yeast, citrus-like acidity, coriander, light clove, wheat, delicate sweet malt and balanced noble hops. Maybe even a slight smokiness. I only wish the nose was even stronger.  This is easily the best hefeweizen I've ever had, and I've sampled quite a few. No competition here, this one wins (sorry, Dennison's). Explosive flavour; this is everything I've always wanted a hefeweizen to be all in one bottle. I've tasted all the individual elements in other hefes, but never all together in one beer like this. All the others are missing one thing or another in comparison. Wheat, astringent yeast, light citrus, sweet banana, soft spices (including a touch of white pepper). Perfectly balanced. No alcohol. Lingering fruity finish, balanced with wheat and a light hop bitterness.  The feel is wicked, the best hefe feel I've found. For a relatively light beer, the body is thick and full. A lively carbonation plays well in the mouth with the fruit and spice flavours.  Amazing. One of the most drinkable liquids I've ever tasted. I can't believe I didn't check this out earlier. All hefes will now pale in comparison to this ridiculously high standard. This will definitely be my summer beer as long as the LCBO keeps it in stock.

T: Bubble gum notes coming from the blending of the phenolic and fruity esters. Phenols are not spicy or overtly clovey. The banana notes are present but subdued.  M: A soft mouthfeel with good carbonation tingle. Not as effervescent as I would hope from a hefeweizen.  Notes: According to Charlie from Five Points, this is the best hefeweizen in the world.

The smell has cold squeezed orange juice, apple skin, a hint of ginger and bananas aplenty. It's a bit muted but nice, especially as the beer sits for a bit and you get hints of honey and the aroma of Arrow Root biscuits (!).  The taste is excellent, very balanced and able to show off all kinds of nuances. It's got the necessary wheaty/bready backbone with a light clove and yeast spiciness. There's a twang of lemon (none of that sticking a wedge into your pint like they sometimes do at the bar!) and a long banana-focused finish. It is right on the button for a wheat style.  Mouthfeel is equally balanced and beautifully textured, somewhat creamy and soft to start and then intensely crisp, dry and tart in the middle and the finish. Fantastic.

Citrus, lemon, clove, spicey wheat, whole wheat crackers, a bit of malt sweetness.  Body is light to medium with a big brisk cola-like carbonation.  Yes indeed.

I'd personally prefer a touch less carbonation though.  Drinkability - This is very good. I am finishing up my rotation of authentic german hefe's with this beer and looking back, they are all quite similar with slightly different personalities. There were both sweeter and more bitter ones. This one doesn't have a hop presence and has only the slightest hint of bitterness, and its not as sweet as some of the other ones.

I will admit I have a particular favortism towards the Hef brew, and this one is the king of them all. It pours a beautiful dark yellow, and has a rich smell of banana and cloves with some spices. The taste is perfect, it has a rich Hefe-Weizen taste without being too light. It is extremely smooth and goes down pleasantly while leaving a satisfying after taste that allows the drinker to remember exactly how the beer tasted.

Dense, bubbly head that retains for a while.  Smell: Sweet and fruity, banana being the most easily recognized fruity aroma. A kind of mild, savory smell like bread dough is present, I'm guessing from yeast. Maybe a bit of faint spice.  Taste: Malty upfront with some fruity character. Alcohol is noticeable. It seems like there are some faint citrusy qualities. Ends fairly dry with a combination of mild citrus hops and semi-bitter yeast. That yeast on the finish, although not very sharp, is definitely strongly flavored.  Mouthfeel: Crisp, pretty high level of carbonation. Fairly light body, but strongly flavored enough to be substantial.  Notes: A pretty damn good brew. I'm not a huge fan of wheat beers, but this one is impressive. I get the feeling this would be a great thirst quenching beer for the hottest days of summer.  Additionally, I hesitate to mention this, but I have tried this beer several times on different occasions just to make sure. I've noticed that after drinking this beer I will soon have a sore throat and raspy voice. It lasts for several hours and then subsides. This has never occurred with any other beers, so I'm not sure what could be causing it. I'm just throwing it out there.

Aroma is spot on for this style, nothing unexpected. Strong notes of wheat, malt, yeast, banana, clove, vanilla and mild citrus. Medium thick body with light carbonation produces a smooth full mouthfeel. Flavor is initially banana sweet and fruity. Mid palate some light hops cut the sweetness and add a lemony citrus balance to the flavor. Finish has nice duration, fairly slick and mildly sweet.

So I was quite happy to see the regular Hefeweiss on the shelves and give it a go.  It poured *beautifully*. A golden cloudy golden hue with a big poofy wipped egg white head that stuck around for a while. Excellent stuff. The smell is big on this one. Banana, cloves and fruit are prominent and the taste has even more volume. Loads of fruit, bananas, melons and god knows what else. It's enjoyable and like their dunkel it swims down your throat.

Hazy golden orange color. Huge creamy 3 finger head. Bubbles are cascading up heavily so this beer should have some high carbonation. Head dissipated rather quickly and left no lacing at all.  S - The smell is powerful with citrus. Orange to be a bit more specific. Coriander is also present in the smell. I also smell hints of banana and spice. Kind of a bready smell. A really nice smell, minus the spice which I'm not huge on.  T - Mmmm, Banana and citrus dominate the taste. Hardly any of that spice I smelled actually made it's way to the tastebuds which I'm happy about. The sweet banana/citrus taste goes away very quickly and leaves a bitter taste in the back although that goes away as quickly as the sweet taste. Little to no aftertaste is left behind which is no problem to much, just makes me want more.  M - I felt it would be a little bit more carbonated than it was due to all the bubbles. Don't get me wrong this is a highly carbonated beer, but I thought it would be to the point where it was almost like a Pepsi or something. Medium-bodied which I wasn't expecting due to the minimal lacing/head. I figured this beer would be almost watery.  D - Very drinkable beer. More of a summer beer than anything.

252,731,biboergosum,4.47,"20oz pint, on-tap at BeerBistro - an awesome find on the last leg of a multi-year business trip to T-dot.  This beer appears a cloudy, pale golden yellow hue, with two fingers of tightly foamy and somewhat creamy dirty white head, which leaves a slightly pocked, but otherwise sheer veil of painted lace around the glass in its lazy-ass wake.  It smells quite pleasantly of the usual suspects - banana chips, semi-sweet clove, subtle yeast, and breakfast cereal wheat grain. The taste is rather sweet wheaty and grainy malt, bruised banana, middling clove, and a bit of yeast. So simple, and yet so perfect.  The carbonation is equitably moderate in its subtle frothiness, the body duly smooth, fruity, and a stoic medium weight, all in approachable measures. It finishes off-dry, clean, and redolent of all things just mentioned, in equitable doses.  Quite a refreshing, agreeable quaff - all the typical points are hit here, sturdily, yet not over the top, I might add, resulting in a very enjoyable and drinkable progenitor of the style. This shows the rest of the world how it can be done, even if no one else has a thousand or so years of experience under their belt (yet).

Tastes pretty much like you'd expect a hefeweizen to taste, but it's just so well balanced - banana is the most recognizable fruit here, but the wheat also really adds a whole lot. A bit of orangey flavors come out near the end - very mild hops to balance it out. Excellent taste.  The mouthfeel is a tad too carbonated for my tastes, but still great. Leaves a wheat flavor in your mouth - delish. Extremely drinkable, could easily have a few of these on a sunny day, but it really could be adapted to pretty much any situation. In the UK, widely available and at a very reasonable price, possibly one of the easiest to obtain world-class beers. Do not miss out on this one.",Bayerische Staatsbrauerei Weihenstephan,Germany,Hefeweizen,98
252,731,RayenK,4.22,"500ml bottle invert-poured into a Weihenstephaner weisen glass. Purchased at Parti-Pak liquors in Indianapolis, IN.  A: Very hazy straw-gold. Almost honey-like in color and haze. Tons of bubbles rising from the bottom of the glass. White creamy head, about 2 and a half fingers high. Good retention and easily stirred back up with a swirl.  A: Sweet bread-like smell. Reminds me of cake or cookies. A nice hint of flowers, citrus, coriander as well.  T: Sweet, lemony/citrusy, coriander, sweet wheat flavor. Lots of goodness here. Mild bitterness in back but very little aftertaste.  M: Mid-bodied (much heavier than I expected, but surprisingly good). Smooth and effervescent. The carbonation is great.  D: Extremely drinkable. I could see myself drinking this all summer long. I am just venturing out of my favorite territories (stouts and IPA's) so I don't have a great deal to compare this with but a trusted friend told me it was the best specimen of the breed, and I'm inclined to believe him.",Bayerische Staatsbrauerei Weihenstephan,Germany,Hefeweizen,98
252,731,Wisconsinality,4.5,A- Pours a great looking hazy golden straw color with about a finger and a half worth of head. The head recedes slowly leaving minimal lacing on the side of the glass but leaves a nice cap on the beer the whole time.  S- A nice array of yeast with some wheat and some coriander in there also. There also a little bit of orange and some lemon in there as well. A very good smelling beer.  T- The wheat is pretty prevalent to go along with a little spice and some coriander. A little yeast on the tail end adds a nice smooth touch of sweetness to it. This is one refreshing beer that is very well balanced .  M- Smooth. The carbonation adds a nice spriteness to it that would make this perfect for a warm summer day. It almost has a creamy texture to it that makes it a solid medium body.  D- The flavors are pronounced but not overpowering. The smooth texture makes this beer go down very easy. Try this if you get a chance and you won't be disappointed. Great for summer or on any occasion for easy sipping.,Bayerische Staatsbrauerei Weihenstephan,Germany,Hefeweizen,98
252,731,sisuspeed,4.35,"Poured into a Harpoon weizen glass. Nice, thick, foamy white head on top of a cloudy orange-wheat body. Some lacing left behind.  Orange citrus, mixed with wheat and sweet malts on the nose. Coriander and some spicier hops come through as well. Very refreshing. Orange peels.  The flavor starts off with a nice wave of juicy oranges, followed by somewhat peppery hops and spice. Sweet malts linger in the background. Reminds me a bit of a lighter orange sherbet. Some nuttiness as well and at times slightly bitter like an orange peel.  Mouthfeel is pretty good. This beer has a decent body, but is a bit overcarbonated in my opinion. Spices and hops add some peppery qualities to the body.  Drinkability is also good. Low ABV and lots of flavor make this a very enjoyable beer to drink. The orangy sweetness and carbonation cut down on the drinkability a little bit for me. But overall, it is easy to finish a bottle of this.  In short, this is a pretty awesome Hefe, probably the best I have ever had. Lots of flavor and a strong aroma. Looks great too. Nothing is really mind blowing, but the beer is well crafted and a great example of the style. I'll definitely have to pick up a few more of these for the Summer.",Bayerische Staatsbrauerei Weihenstephan,Germany,Hefeweizen,98
252,731,abuliarose,4.62,"Poured into a weizen glass, revealing hazy golden body with lively bubbling into a tall white head. Some lacing. Very pretty. Smells sweet like hayfields and wild honey with a little breadiness, almost like a saison.  Tastes light and well-carbonated with a delicate sweetness. Nice smooth wheat flavor comes through, with a hint of citrus and a gentle cleansing bitterness right at the end. Carbonation is a little more tingly than creamy, otherwise it's quite refreshing. Light-bodied with a smooth, watery mouthfeel. Totally drinkable.  If I could pick a session beer to enjoy exclusively in the summer for the rest of my life, this might be the one. The saison-like fragrant character really melts my heart. This is the best hefeweizen I've had yet.",Bayerische Staatsbrauerei Weihenstephan,Germany,Hefeweizen,98
252,731,zoso493,4.45,"Poured from a 500 ml bottle into a weissen glass.  Appearance: Pours a very pale yellow that is very hazy for how light the color is. It's crowned by a massive four-finger head that takes an eternity to dissipate.  Smell: The nose is not as powerful as one might expect, but it has all the standard hefeweizen characteristics to it. There is the traditional strain of yeast along with clove, some spices and a very pleasant scent of banana.  Taste: What a fantastic beer. This is, for me, the epitome of the style. It's got everything you'd want in a hefe, the perfect strain of yeast, the clove, the dry spiciness and of course the signature banana character. It's not hugely bold, but at 5.4% ABV, you can't expect too much more out of a brew.  Mouthfeel: Adequate mouthfeel to this one. It's a little bit on the thinner side of things since it's so highly carbonated, but I have no complaints.  Drinkability: This is very drinkable beer, especially in the summer months. It's light-bodied, low in ABV and very tasty, all of which make for a great session brew.  Overall, this is an excellent beer and a terrific example of the style. The flavors are so wonderfully wrapped together this one. This would make a great session beer during the summer and a pleasure to drink anytime.",Bayerische Staatsbrauerei Weihenstephan,Germany,Hefeweizen,98
252,731,BeanBone,4.1,"Appearance: A thoroughly hazy golden-amber body that 's full of chunky particles. Up top, over three fingers of creamy whitish head that fade slowly and leave patchy lacing.  Aroma: Bananas, golden fruit, wheaty malt, mild spice, and just a hint of something a little sour.  Flavor: Up front, a traditional mix of cloves and banana-like yeast with some mild bitterness. Underneath, a toasty and wheat-like malt backbone keeps the traditional flavors coming. Everything is balanced well, with no aspect dominating. Cereal-grain malt and golden fruit in the finish.  Mouthfeel: Medium bodied and creamy with smooth medium carbonation. Crisp and somewhat drying in the finish.  Drinkability: Highly drinkable, this would be a welcome summer refresher.  Verdict: Here we have a solid Hefeweizen--it's simple and highly drinkable yet never boring. I personally prefer Paulaner's version of the style, but this is still a very solid start for someone ready to dive into German Hefeweizens.",Bayerische Staatsbrauerei Weihenstephan,Germany,Hefeweizen,98

Holding it up to the light, I can still barely see the silhouette of my hand behind it. Hard to knock this beer's appearance, it's almost picture-perfect. If the head had stuck around a bit longer, I would have given it a 5.  The nose is a big, musty-floral brush stroke. Orange zest and lemons hang out after the main flower scents fade. It's rich and complex. The taste follows form -- complex citrus and floral flavors in front of the musty malt-hop background. Rich and deeply flavorful.  The mouthfeel is hefeweiss-perfect: thick without being chewy, carbonated just enough to avoid a harshness on the tongue. One of the best mouthfeels of any non-stout I've ever had. And the drinkability goes up because of it -- it's such a pleasure to drink such a tasty, almost-creamy brew.

Unlike others I've tried, the taste isn't overpowering and is more refreshing with a nice blend.  Mouthfeel: Light body and dissipates quickly. Taste lingers in the mouth but not in a bad way.  Drinkability: Hefeweizens are always a tricky style of beer and this one just nails it. Where as others can become too much, this one is light, refreshing and a great blend of flavors.

T-the taste is pretty solid, there is less clove but still some spiciness from it that sticks throughout the beer. The banana becomes quite present and lingers a little.

252,731,USSRNUKE9,4.78,"Being admittedly a bit biased towards hefe, this is my all-time favorite brew. The lightness and crispness of it are second to none and the delicate balance of flavors are solidly pleasant time and again. I find myself coming back to this one, and still enjoying it like it was my first glass...  But onto why it's so good: When pouring, the head bubbles out its golden body like a dream - it puffs and sticks to the side of the glass just full of creamy goodness. As it expands it sends out aromas of citrus, spice, and wheat; a slightly yeasty ether suspending it above the glass with an inviting, nearly nostalgic sensibility.  Upon drinking, one is greeted with a number of interesting tastes, mixed together as if by time itself to a delicate equilibrium - classic yet somehow striking in their balance. It's as if the flavors themselves have met in this place to remind you of the very roots of beer itself... Yet, throughout their visit they maintain a unique and distinctive character, wrapped as they are in gentle, fruity overtones, delicate spices, and their very own signature style and flavorings of wheat.  What follows after that first distinctive sip is a crisp sweetness, both refreshing and enjoyable themselves. A twinge bitterness bites casually through, hearkening back to its noble hefe roots - a reminder of just how far beer has come though both its glorious and inglorious past. The beer itself is almost honeyed, I might say, and, despite its crispness, the aftertaste also bears something of that honey stickiness just the same.  Let it settle a moment longer and another prominent aftertaste will come to light - a remarkable wheatiness which, like fresh-baked bread, will hover on your tongue before beckoning soon after for yet another delicious sip.  And so, refreshed as you are and with fond memories of your previous acquaintance in-mind, you're all but helpless to accept its generous offer... to once again enjoy the delicious musings of the many flavors in this wisened, olden brew as they amble agreeably, yet ever-so-slightly down the rings you draw upon the glass...

It pours a nice opaque blonde with a really nice substantial white head, it sticks to the glass. The smell was a little subdued imo. I did pick up some floral notes with a bit of banana as others have mentioned. The taste is a bit of clover spice, that turns into a bubblegum banana like flavor. The final after taste is a bit of yeast and sweet bread. Not really much in the way of hoppy bitterness. It seemed to me that there was quite a bit of carbonation in my mouth, a bit more than I prefer. But again, this is definitely the best hefeweizen that I've had.

Nice solid banana and clove flavor, as in the nose, followed by a sweet, bready maltiness and a drying, citrusy finish. Very tasty, but not the best damn thing I've ever tasted.  The mouthfeel is a little thin, but otherwise good. The light carbonation works well with the dry finish to provide a zesty feel on your tongue.  In all, this is a very good beer with high drinkability for most, but I don't personally want to drink more than one bottle of this at a time, but that's mainly because I'd rather be drinking IPAs than wheat beers; it's personal preference. For some, the drinkability is through the roof, for me it's so so. Either way, this is a stellar wheat beer, probably my favorite of the style, even if the style isn't my favorite.",Bayerische Staatsbrauerei Weihenstephan,Germany,Hefeweizen,98

S: Big time bananas, a yeasty presence with a fresh baked golden bread character. Notes of cloves and some other spice, very light. Smells like a great German hefe!  T: Pretty much follows the smell with that awesome backed bread note really lingering in the finish. Very clean!  D: Not sure if I'd embark on an evening of these, I wouldn't know when to stop.

252,731,KingEdward,5,"I had this beer on-tap poured into a pint glass. This beer has a white two to three finger head that lasts forever and a yellow cloudy color. The beer smells of clove, banana, wheat and yeast. The beer tastes of clove, wheat, and mild citrus, and has a light hop aftertaste. This beer has a nice amount of lacing. This beer is super refreshing, crisp, and a perfect session beer. I have had this beer on-tap and in the bottle either way it is awesome. Drinking this beer makes me want to go on another vacation to germany. This is one of my favorite beers of all time.

252,731,MPLS,4.43,"An easy to obtain world class hefeweizen, sure why not.  A: This beer is certainly unfiltered and has a golden dilute grapefruit juice color to it. The head on this beer is massive and consequently upon opening the beer was met with a gusher. The head is very cheese cloth like and the lacing is deserving of a compliment.  S: The smell if the defining of a hefeweizen. Bananas, clove, and hints of citrus.  T: The taste is a creamy banana an clove. It's a youthful taste that is fresh and has a fair amount of zest and dryness in the finish that would indicate the hops are doing their job. The finish incorporates a kind of perfectly balanced chalky sweetness that leaves you wanting more. It's strange to think that my first ""real"" beer experiences were with German beers as I was an exchange student in high school and naturally rose as a natural opportunist to be able to legally drink beer at the age of 17.  M: This beer is extremely creamy and is quintessential of the style. Slides down the tongue nicely.  D: This beer is rather affordable, definitely real affordable in it's motherland (Deutschland).

This remained for a while before it started dying down.  Aroma: Everything you expect from a good hefeweizen: cloves, citrus, banana, wheat. They are are all very well balanced with each other.  Taste: Exactly the same as it smells, a great example of a hefe. The cloves come up front followed by the banana and bubblegum, following again with more clove.  Mouthfeel: Very light and crisp with almost no aftertaste. It hits every part of the tongue with something different.  Drinkable: This is very drinkable and would make a great intro to the world of craft beer.",Bayerische Staatsbrauerei Weihenstephan,Germany,Hefeweizen,98

The lights in my apartment make it glisten in my weiss glass.  The smell - everything you expect a hefe to be and more. Bananas, cloves, orange, even wheat - all wafting into your nostrils.  It was the smoothest, most beautiful hefe imaginable. This brewery sure knows how to bring out all the flavors without being overpowering in any way. This beer plain out made me feel peaceful just with that first sip, not to mention after 3 bottles.",Bayerische Staatsbrauerei Weihenstephan,Germany,Hefeweizen,98
252,731,MrHassellYaHurd,4.35,"Pours a beautiful frosty yellow-orange with a tall, tightly bubbled head billowing from the top of the weizen glass. This particular weizen smells, as per the style, of clovey notes as well as those of orange peels, coriander, and other citruses. The taste is right on the nose for a hefeweizen. Almost no hop presence in the taste, and a perfect balance between the fruity and citrusy flavors and the slightly sweet alcohol tastes. The Weihenstephaner is wonderfully smooth to the palate and incredibly drinkable, with it's perfectly grainy medium body and mild abv.",Bayerische Staatsbrauerei Weihenstephan,Germany,Hefeweizen,98
252,731,Stavage,4.83,"Poured into a weizen glass. Very cloudy orange amber fluid with a massive frothy foamy white head on top of it which lasted til the last drop.  Most hefeweizens smell reasonably similar to me. Pleasant banana and clove smells are present as I expected though I found a stronger more substantial sweet yeasty malt smell than I am used to for the style. Very appetizing on this hot day.  Has a very earthy grain taste followed by a lingering hit of clove spiciness and citric tartness. Rounded off with a nutty yeast flavour. All these flavours balance together exceptionally well. The nuttiness doesn't linger allowing the spiciness and the citrus tones to keep the mouth dry and refreshed and wanting more.  Smooth, good carbonation, good medium to full body. As mentioned earlier this is refreshingly dry.  All I can really say is this is probably the best hefeweizen I can get my hands on here, and I love hefeweizens in the summertime. Refreshing, tasty, thirst quenching and satisfying.",Bayerische Staatsbrauerei Weihenstephan,Germany,Hefeweizen,98
252,731,TheHammer,3.64,"Appearance: Poured with a solid two thumbs of head that retained and laced like crazy. The beer itself is a cloudy dark yellow, just as you would expect to be with great signs of carbonation. Nothing to complain about here.  Smell: A bit tame to be honest, as clear wheat and biscuit smells with only the barest hint of banana and lemon. It's nice but needs a bit more of a punch.  Taste: Tastes well made, and is pretty much a textbook hefe taste but it just seems a little lacking. Starts with a lemon tasting wheat malt that shifts to a slight banana flavor and ends with a taste of odd yeast. Good but nothing to write home about, as it needs more banana.  Mouthfeel: Good carbonation, and decent transitioning but the funky biscuit and yeast aftertaste at the end doesn't quite sit right. Thankfully it does not stay around for very long, which is good.  Drinkability: No issues getting it down, but seems to sit a bit heavy on the gut. Refreshing I suppose, and a great summer beer, but not one I'd drink all night. I honestly expected it to be a bit sweeter.  Final Thoughts: Really, I feel this beer seems to be a bit tame for a Hefe. It still is a decently made beer, but I wouldn't call it exceptional. I think the yeast needs to be changed up a little bit, because the cloves and banana you'd expect from this style don't seem to make enough of a presence to suit my tastes. Still, I'd recommend picking up a bottle.",Bayerische Staatsbrauerei Weihenstephan,Germany,Hefeweizen,98
252,731,irishking1977,4.38,"Sometimes I think when you've had one beer of a certain style, you've had them all. That can be said, to a degree, with Hefes. The best ones, though, will be just a cut above the rest for other intangibles besides taste.  A: Liquid beauty poured out of a bottle. Cloudy orange gold with a massive, bright white head that leaves crazy lacing.  S: Faint hint of - you guessed it - banana, phenols, and biscuits.  T: Starts off with a lemony/wheat kick then goes immediately to the banana aftertaste along with a funky yeast and biscuit aftertaste. Remarkable to say the least.  M: Highly carbonated and creamy. Somewhat oily on the palate, but nicely balanced.  D: An excellent summer and spring thirst quencher. Though, I'm drinking it in the midst of winter, I'll have to remember this one for the spring months to come.",Bayerische Staatsbrauerei Weihenstephan,Germany,Hefeweizen,98
252,731,Beerandraiderfan,3.83,"Well finally, a decent hefe, even though it ain't my style. This one looks vibrant yellow and even a little orange, uber cloudy. Aroma, citrus and lemon, wheatgrass type of vibe.  More of the same in taste, a big full mouthfeel of said aroma, but also, resonates as a more full bodied beer than your standard hefe. Quite drinkable, although these usually don't come cheap. Worth picking up for a friend who likes hefe.",Bayerische Staatsbrauerei Weihenstephan,Germany,Hefeweizen,98
252,731,Minotaur,4.88,"The quintessential Hefeweiss readily available outside of Germany.  On tap at the Spinnerstown Hotel.  This is one of the few perfect examples of a beer style. Everything is in place from the hazy gold-amber color and thick head to the banana and clove aroma characteristic of the german wheat style.  Sweet but not cloying: just a slight bitterness and balanced fruity component. Sweetness that seems completely grainy and natural blends with a vague tartness at the back of the throat.  The feel is creamy and smooth, allowing the beer to be drunk with exceptional ease.  A potential desert island beer if you want something inviting yet refreshing that seems to nearly perfectly balance every beer characteristic.",Bayerische Staatsbrauerei Weihenstephan,Germany,Hefeweizen,98
252,731,Mora2000,4.42,"Pours a yellow straw color with a white head. The aroma is classic hefeweizen, bananas and cloves.

S: Super Banana smell, very strong, just a mild clove smell but really smelled like a banana smoothie.  T: The taste is pretty much the same as the smell. No hops, no alcohol, none of the ""beery"" taste of some more industrialized Hefe's. I would like a little more complexity though.  M: Very creamy, lots of texture, low carbonation despite the huge head.  D: Extremely, no wonder these are so popular in Bavaria.",Bayerische Staatsbrauerei Weihenstephan,Germany,Hefeweizen,98
252,731,icetraxx,4.47,"A: Poured from a fresh 12oz bottle into my Weihenstephan Weizen glass (purchased before I was a fan FYI). Pours a hazy golden amber color that gets clearer towards the bottom of the glass. A massive five finger head was produced on a slow pour which dissipates into a 1-2 finger head in a couple of minutes leaving a lot of lacing. The head remains at 1-finger for the rest of the beer. The head is not as creamy or volumetric as the Hacker-Pschorr weisse. This beer is not opaque enough for the style.  S: Aromas of malt, banana, clove, cherry, pears, and finally an acidic kick are most noticeable. A hint of yeasty bread-like aroma comes through. Quite pleasant to smell and improves over time. More aromatic than many other versions of the style.  T: Slightly tart and very malty. A sweet sensation is perfectly balanced by mildly bitter hops and eugenol (clove-like) spiciness. Taste has a little more hop character than I've seen in other weisses. The banana and fruit-like flavors are playing back up compared to other beers I've had of this style, but I am enjoying the intense malty yet spicy character of this beer. To sum up the flavor of this beer: malty with a crisp drying finish, hoppy-bitter for the style, mildly spicy, tart, and complex for the style. There is a yeasty element to the flavor profile as well. I would like to see more yeasty banana flavors. Overall nice and hearty.  M: Perhaps a little under-carbonated (probably due to my pour). The mouthfeel is not as starchy and lacks the body that other beers I've had of this style, but this beer is definitely not watery. EDIT: Poured slower and did not experience the under-carbonation effect, but I still feel the body of this beer lacks something.  D: Scarily high. I finished my serving half way through writing this review (~3 minutes). I want another.  O: Not the best tasting hefe I've ever had but it may just be the most complex and most interesting I've ever had. I must admit I was dissappointed as I thought this beer would be much better than the hefe from both Hacker-Pschorr and Franziskaner, and I feel it is better, but these beers are all in the same league -and that means they all happen to be great beers. Maybe it has to due with freshness, but my favorite hefe remains the summer seasonal brewed by Grizzly Peak Brewing Company in Ann Arbor, Michigan.  EDIT: After having this beer many times, I have determined that the appearance is not as good as other weisse beers of this style (reduced from 5 to 4), yet the smell and mouthfeel are better than I originally observed in my initial review. I have also sub combed to the clove dominate and hoppy flavor, this is my favorite bottled hefe that I've had so far as well as the best ""clove dominate"" hefe that I've ever had.",Bayerische Staatsbrauerei Weihenstephan,Germany,Hefeweizen,98

Lots of carbonation bubbles in the glass. It doesn't get much better than this.  Aroma: A very nice amount of banana and cloves. Very sweet smelling. Some wheat as well. There isn't too much going on here, but what is here is very great. Lots of flavor here.  Taste: Not as much flavor here as the aroma, but pretty solid. Bananas and cloves present again with some spices as well. A big wheat flavor which was no surprise.  Mouthfeel: Crisp and smooth. Medium bodied with a good amount of carbonation.

252,731,marketesq,4.95,"I must say, this has been my favorite beer for about two years now. Long before joining beer advocate.  A- To me, this is how beer should look, particularly hefeweizen style. Orangish golden hues with obvious carbonation.  S- Again, what a bouquet. And, important to note it's not about a smell of alcohol and nothing that remotely makes you want to stop smelling it.  T- Perfection, to me, as far as the general term ""beer"" goes and more importantly as hefeweizen style should command. Citrus notes, just right on hops, carbonation actually accentuates the positive tastes as opposed to hiding them or making them disappear too quickly.  M- The only minor negative I can find, although it's very minor is it could be a tad too light in the mouth.  D- If you can find a more drinkable, true session, high end beer, please please tell me.  In the end, to each their own, but this is the end all be all to me.

T- Many of the ingredients detected in the nose are present here. Upfront, a large dose of wheat and yeast hit the palate. Has a unique biscuit character to it. The finish has a much fruitier presence then the nose leads to believe. Sweet, ripe bananas and cloves end this one perfectly.  M- Light bodied with plenty of carbonation. Very lively.

Head was white, full, soft and maintained to lace well.  Aroma was of grain bassed citric to the nose.  Taste was grain-like, earthy but soft, hints of citric lemon with a undertone of metal toward the mouthfeel.  The mouth was soft as carbonation was up.

Deep gold color, very cloudy and nice looking with depth.  Barely any head on pouring and no lacing.  Aroma and taste are very spicy all the way through with hops and maybe a hint of berries.  The mouth feel is my favourite part of this beer. It is creamy and nice despite heavy carbonation, a truly great balancing act.  Reminiscent of Belgians in overall character and drinkability.

Taste - First sip was mostly banana. Delicious. As the beer warmed, the spices and cloves came out a lot more. Very low on hops, maybe a slight touch of bitterness at the end. It's truly the perfect balance of flavors that one expects in this style. This is the best tasting hefeweizen I've had.  Mouthfeel - Very light with a somewhat crisp carbonation.

252,731,Asgeirr,4.36,"Appearance: Weihenstephaner Hefeweissbier poured into a weizen glass delivers a wonderfully opaque, unfiltered gamboge colour, a sparse amount of bubbles ascend to the magnificently massive cream-white crown which withstands the fall of time in all its majesty for a long period, leaving its inheritance in the shape of sporadic lacing -- hail to the king!  Smell: Obviously bananas 'n' carrots. just like you know it should when it comes to weissbrewskis, some cloves and a whiff of black pepper comes to notice along with the yeasty undertones which functions as base for this otherwise pretty sweet experience.  Taste: Corresponding to what we got in the smell compartment, however the carrots tend to -- thankfully -- dominate over the bananas which seem to be quickly replaced by a peachy/apple-like sourness. The whole ride is finished of with a luring and gentle bitterness interlaced with the aforementioned yeastiness.  Mouthfeel: Medium full and very creamy yet somewhat coarse in texture, medium-low in carbonation.  Drinkability: Concerning weissbier, do they come off as any better than this one, the archetype if you will, 'nuff said; verdrinken -- schnell!  On a sidenote: The brewery is founded in 1040, man back then we'd barely heard of hvitekrist/the son of man/the ultimate irony (get it? a carpenter being nailed to some wood) up here in the grim and frostbitten kingdoms...",Bayerische Staatsbrauerei Weihenstephan,Germany,Hefeweizen,98
252,731,GeezLynn,4.25,"A: Clear golden blonde color with a perfect white head. Outstanding retention through the  S: Rich yeasty aroma. Wheat, bananas, cloves and a maybe a little vanilla contribute to an outstanding smell.  T: Banana, and clove clove flavors are very apparent. Lemon and pear flavors also make an appearance giving this a nice hefe tangyness.  M: Mouthfeel is medium to light bodied with ample carbonation.  While I've never been a huge fan of the style, this is an excellent beer and one that I am happy to drink most any time I find it in front of me.",Bayerische Staatsbrauerei Weihenstephan,Germany,Hefeweizen,98
252,731,JohnGalt1,4.45,"12 oz picked up today at the COOP... glad to see this finally back to Boise... Good work Matt! I've enjoyed this beer dozens of times over the years, but Weihenstephaner seemed to take a 3-4 year hiatus from our coolers...  Really only feeling like a beer or two after a way too long day at the desk.... poured into my smaller weizen glass.  2 finger foamy white head ... the brew is a hazy light honey...  Nose is just so inviting and probably about perfect for the style... banana.. clove... yada yada yada.... just an epitome of what makes this such a great brew.  The flavors are again.. pretty much perfect.. everything that we want in any Hefe.. especially one made in Germany... this still tastes fresh..  I would write more... but I'm tired.. and want to enjoy this and then knock off some serious slumber.  4.5/4.5/4.5/4/4.5",Bayerische Staatsbrauerei Weihenstephan,Germany,Hefeweizen,98
252,731,deruiz10,4.33,"Poured on tap into a 20 oz. weizen glass.  A - Pour is a warm, cloudy golden-blonde with a 1.5-finger head dissipating to 1/2-finger, good effervescence.  S - Fruity and spicy with the signature strong smell of yeast and bananas, more typical of a Belgian white in my opinion. Traces of flowery hops.  T - Just as good as the smell, but tastes like a German heffeweissen whereas it smells more like a Belgian. Maybe this was me, but I really thought that was the case. Sweet malts and yeast with milder fruit (more citrusy) and spice than the smell suggests, lingering sweet, citrus and fruity finish fades to a slightly bitter aftertaste, but not at all unpleasant.  M - Light and slightly creamy, moderate carbonation keeps it feeling lively.  D - Very refreshing, makes a great summer beer or to cool your palate after a savory meal.  This was a surprisingly refreshing beer with great flavor, an all around well-rounded German wheat. I swear it's not my imagination that this beer smelled Belgian but tasted German...in this case the identity crisis works well.",Bayerische Staatsbrauerei Weihenstephan,Germany,Hefeweizen,98

Pours a golden unfiltered hue cloudy and solid, with a 2 inch head taking its time to dissipate eliciting strong aromas of banana, tangerine and a hint of clove.  Tastes are a strong yeasty taste rolling over the tongue to a slight bitterness and a malt presence that lasts throughout, until a tartness at the end. The taste thrill recurs throughout serving.  Drinkable and consistent is this one, it always pleases and satisfies.  What a happy experience.",Bayerische Staatsbrauerei Weihenstephan,Germany,Hefeweizen,98

A hazy deep golden color with a huge head of pure white foam. Lacing, lacing, lacing.  Yeast and bananas. Rich and dense, but still the refreshing light hefeweizen. And we're still talking smell.  Tasty yeast flavors and the typical wheat. Rich yeast, and the wheat flavors are well balanced against it.  Not velvety, but approaching that. Very fizzy, which is the impeding factor - but not an impediment in quality.  Great beer. If you're in Germany, get it and enjoy it.

A - Pours a mirky golden-yellow with a white frothy head that disipitates into a small white cap and a ring around the edge of the glass. There's some evidence of some sticky lacing along the side of the glass.  S - Banana's, semi-sweet aroma, some spicy notes in there as well. I've had some Hefe's that are too sweet and some that are too bland, this one falls directly in the middle. Not overly sweet while not being too boring.  T - Banana's, nutmeg, some sweetness, wheat, and spices. Very balanced and smooth. Nothing over the top, very much a straight forward Hefe that's at the top of it's game. A nice spicey/sweet finish.  M - Light bodied, frothy carbonation, refreshing and smooth.  D - A stellar Hefe that deserves to be at the top of the list.

A - Beautiful, hazy straw gold color with a pillowy three fingers of foam with good shape retention that holds itself over the top rim of the glass. Head has good retention but finally fades to about a 1/4"" and stays with the beer thru the glass.  S - Good, spicy aroma...full of cloves and banana, sweet overall aroma, a little bit of light citrus and a touch of bubble gum. All blend together well, nothing overpowers any of the other aromas.  T - Very smooth flavors. Good wheat character, some cloves up front, bananas there too. No real hop character, but a nice balancing bitterness - almost not noticeable, except for the complete balance it creates in the beer. Spicy, but not over the top...a little bit subdued and blended nicely overall. Very enjoyable wheat beer.  M - On the thin side, as most Hefe's are. Plenty of carbonation, but not as much as many examples of this style. Beer is quite lively, but not overly prickly on the tongue - smoother and quite nice feel.  D - On a hot summer day, is there anything better than a good wheat beer? Well, even on a cold fall night, this is still a great wheat beer and a nice drinking companion.

The head is clean white color and cloudy looking. The aroma is cloves with banana. Very well balance smell. On the taste side, I get cloves with some banana bread. Extremely well balanced. Nothing is over powering, it's just perfect. Medium body and carbonation is felt in the mouth, not bad for the taste. Almost no bitterness.

An excellent spice and fruit characteristic which I love about Bavarian Hefeweizens. There is also a nice yeasty component.  M: The carbonation is quite pleasant and tingles a bit.

After the initial banana onslaught there's a gentle spiciness, with the expected clove present, but also a hint of cardamom. Upon pouring the remainder of the yeast, there's also a slight nutty quality.  M - Very smooth and creamy, with medium body.  D - Endlessly quaffable, this beer is a little too big to be a proper session beer, but I could easily put away a few of these without much trouble.

A nice crisp wheat nose surrounded by supple spicy esters from the yeast, a mellow fruity banana, and fresh bubble gum. Enticing in every way.  T - Absolutely delicious soft wheat that's as fresh as can be with a yeasty spice flavor that hints at the myriad of flavors rather than beating you over the head with them. The banana is there with a bit of fruity bubblegum and soft notes of earthy clay.  M - Mellow on the carbonation allowing it to open up flavor-wise and be soft and smooth.

A solid amount of lacing remains on the glass after drinking.  Smells like wheat, yeast, and a little bit of banana.  Very smooth taste with malty sweetness, traditional wheat, a hint of banana, and mild hops, but I was really expecting more here. The aftertaste feels like it was watered down and leaves me longing for something more. This is far from being a bad hefe, but it's clearly inferior to the offerings from style-leaders Paulaner and Augustiner IMO.  Mouthfeel is smooth and creamy with just the right amount of carbonation. Best part of this beer.  Drinkability is high due to its relatively light taste and fabulous mouthfeel. I could see myself sessioning this brew.  A good hefe all in all, but it doesn't live up to the rave reviews here.

252,731,nomomentwasted,4.55,"Had this out of the bottle, poured into a pint glass. Wished I had more of it after I was finished . . . much more of it.  Appearance: Don't know if it could have been more hefeweizen than it poured. Cloudy gold color with fluffy white head that billowed nicely as she poured. Head retention was very solid at about an inch above surface level, and laced decently. Inviting, that's for sure.  Smell: Yum. The traditional wheaty, fresh banana and clove hef nose are definitely present here. Sweet, but not quite bubble gummy, and just altogether very indicative of the style. Then again, this is one of the oldest renditions, shouldn't be too surprised.  Taste: Wow. After having several decent Hefs recently, this certainly shows how tasty and refreshing a good Hef is. Sweet malts accompanied by slight hops in a wheaty balance that is just so inviting on a warm evening. Taste becomes a little more banana and clove rather than sweet as it opens up a bit, but still very, very refreshing and delicious.  Mouthfeel: Creamy and carbonated perfectly. Just awesome carbonation level, that's for sure. The homebrewed Hef my housemates and I brewed recently is slightly overcarbonated, and it takes a tad away from the end result. This, on the other hand, is just right. Tasty.  Drinkability: High, but not immense. Man, I love a good Hef.

T: Nice flavor of wheat, citrus, and spices... the pepper in particular is quite prevalent (say that three times fast). Short duration, which is normal for a hefeweizen.  M: Medium-bodied and quite creamy, with average carbonation.  D: Hell yeah it's drinkable. You could put these back all night and never get sick of them.

Also, like a good wheat beer, it's spicy, with a bit of pepper, cloves, koriander... Similar taste, but stronger. Complex and balanced. Very refreshing.  The carbonation is maybe a bit too much (unless it's summertime), but the mouthfeel is outstanding nevertheless. This is pretty drinkable indeed.  It's a pitty I never discovered this beer before.

Taste hits immediately with fresh banana and cloves with wheat in the background and a hint of honey towards the finish. A little bit of citrus can also be detected.

252,731,cptierney,4.53,"Poured slowly and slightly agitated into the appropriate .5l Weihenstephaner hefe glass. A beautiful sight if ever there was one.  An earlier reviewer mentioned a banana bread smell. I think this is appropriate, as there isn't an overwhelming hit of banana to this bouquet, just a mild hint. There are some peppery spices in the mix with clove being the most prominent.  What a gorgeous beer. The glass accentuate the four fingers of fluffy white head that sit atop a base of golden wheat. There are many trails of carbonation making the long traverse from bottom to top, making for a moving image.  American hefe's eat your heart out. This is wheat beer nirvana. The spice in this beer is incredibly balanced, the clove I smelled is there along with some trilling bitter notes from a minimal hop profile. The banana esters are really minimal and this beer stands as an excellent example of the less is more philosophy of the German purity law.  There is not a better mouthfeel in the hefe world, hence the perfect 5. There is a thickness to this brew, that the wheat provides, that makes it a much more palatable summer companion than its american counterparts. Mix this with fantastic carbonation and you have a great brew.  No issues with drinkability, it practically demands that you have another. A real cultural treasure to the nation of Germany and a welcome cultural visitor here in the states. I really need to start reviewing some bad beers.",Bayerische Staatsbrauerei Weihenstephan,Germany,Hefeweizen,98

I've had it two different ways, from the bottle and from the tap. I prefer the bottle, which is the more German way to serve a hefe-weissen, just make sure you use the proper glass.  The beer pours great, a clear orange-yellow at first, then shake the bottle and continue pouring and it becomes a cloudy orange-yellow with about an inch and a half of thick white head up to the rim of the glass.  The smell is pretty strong, which is how most hefes are. The first smell is cloves and malts with a mild spiciness and hints of lemon.  This beer is very earthy. There is minimal hop character and a strong malty character, which is balanced with the sweetness of the wheat. It is a great beer to drink in a biergarten in the summer because it has a nice amount of carbonation to give it a refreshing finish to it.  One of the best hefe-weissens I've ever had, I definitely recommend one for a hot summer day.

Taste is exceptionally smooth and terrifically quaffable. Banana, clove and just a little bit of bitterness to the finish, but very rounded.  Mouthfeel is slightly, thin, creamy, with tart carbonation. A great summer quaffer.  A classic hefeweisse, with a lovely crisp finish.

252,731,VikeMan,4.2,"Poured from 12 oz bottle into Weizen glass.  This review is a little different. I previously reviewed Franziskaner and wanted to do a head to head with Weihenstephaner. So my buddy Timster and I sampled both side by side. I'll skip the usual stuff...my previous review of Franziskaner still stands, and in fact also fits the Weihenstephaner very nicely. After much back and forth, both tasting-wise and discussion-wise, we only agreed on two differences...  1) The Franziskaner had a slightly 'crisper' finish, perhaps due to a tiny bit of difference in carbonation. The Weihenstephaner's finish was a little smoother/rounder. This was very subtle and we could not agree on which was preferable. 2) The Weihenstephaner had just a tiny bit more clove in the taste. Again, we could not agree on which was preferred.  Other differences were both too subtle and fleeting for us to agree upon in any way. That includes the ABV difference of about 0.4%, which was surprisingly not at all obvious in the smell or taste.  So which is the better hefe? I'm calling it a push. I would probably make any future purchasing decisions between these two based on price and/or freshness.",Bayerische Staatsbrauerei Weihenstephan,Germany,Hefeweizen,98

Pours an opaque gold, with orange hues in the thickest part of the glass. Rocky 2-inch head, banana creme in color. Brilliant carbonation. Almost no lacing to speak of.  This smells like freshly harvested wheat and freshly picked honey comb. Adding to the greatness is a light malt presence, cloves, and a zingy hop finish.  Easily the best Hefeweiss I've tasted, by miles. This is the first german HW i've had and it tastes magical. This came highly recommended and it is worth it. Pure, fresh wheat, honey sweetness, light malting, wonderful hop balance to blend in, gentle finish.  Mouthfeel is light but not watery. Carbonation is invigorating without biting the tongue.

There's mostly wheat and citrus in the flavor along with light banana and clove notes and a balanced mix of malt, which adds a light sweetness,. A very light but noticeable hops flavor is quite subtle and just enough to even it out. A surprisingly lingering finish rounds out the wheat, yeast and citrus characters. There's a surprising thick creaminess to this brew, very nicely complimenting a crispness and a carbonation that's not too heavy. There's not much wrong with this at all; this is the quintessential hefeweizen.",Bayerische Staatsbrauerei Weihenstephan,Germany,Hefeweizen,98
252,731,nokes,4.15,"Looks like fizzy liquid honey in my wine glass, with a vortex of tiny bubbles swirling up to join a moderately dense head.  Smells of citrus and mild spicyness with a hint of banana. Nice.  Tastes...well...fruity. Refreshing, and very straightforward. Balanced very nicely. This tastes like a straight-up snappy dry hefe the way I would imagine them to be. It's very good, with a pleasantly lingering finish.  Mouthfeel is really quite nice, particularly for a hefe. It has strong presence, and a bit of creaminess you don't always get in these guys. Really nice.  Good drinkability here. Seemed to get better as it went on...I could see these following each other. Definitely would drink again.",Bayerische Staatsbrauerei Weihenstephan,Germany,Hefeweizen,98
252,731,PEIBeerGuy,4.15,"I'm starting to get more into this type of beer after the Hacker-Pschorr Hefe Weisse I had the other day and this one. I thought the Hacker-Pschorr was slightly better, though.  Looks good... cloudy gold. Tall, foamy head that left no lace on the sides except where I was drinking.  The smell is good, albeit a bit sharp.  It tastes pretty good! I get a banana, cream, & dough flavour with a bit of spice.  It feels smooth, not too thick or thin.  Pretty drinkable! I won't be afraid to further explore this genre after the other ones I had that I didn't care for as much.",Bayerische Staatsbrauerei Weihenstephan,Germany,Hefeweizen,98
252,731,jrallen34,3.15,"I drank this from the bottle into a chalice.  It pours a hazy medium gold with a decent white head. Light retention and lacing.  The aroma is light with notes of flowers, hops, and honey.  The taste is what you would expect from a weiss, not a big fan of this style, but saying that it was not the best weiss I've had. The taste was light, and it had a very unpleasant metallic finish that contriubted to a poor mouthfeel as well. You can this all because its so light despite its weird after-taste.",Bayerische Staatsbrauerei Weihenstephan,Germany,Hefeweizen,98
252,731,cbutova,4.57,"Pours a cloudy yellow orange with a two finger white head (this beer is volatile) that leaves a good blanket on the beer and has decent retention. Medium lacing is left as I sip this one down. Smells of banana, apples, other fruits, light malts and yeasts. This beer has a strong smell that I can actually pick up, great aromas on this one. Taste is a good balance of malts, yeast, esters, bananas and a hint of apple. Beer gets better and better with every sip, which is the opposite of 85% of the beers I drink. Mouthfeel is pretty light, good smooth carbonation, a bit of alcohol warming but this is expected with the style and a nice coat of german flavors on the tongue, yeast and esters. Drinkability is great, the beer never really loses its flavor or develops off flavors in a reasonable amount of it. The price is fine or a good German beer. I will definitely buy and recommend this one as the go to German beer.",Bayerische Staatsbrauerei Weihenstephan,Germany,Hefeweizen,98
252,731,weazal,4.53,"A: Warm, orangey citrus balanced by slight earthy wheatness and a strong dose of spices like clove. Pungent and delicious smelling.  T: All the spices carry through wonderfully and kind of dominate. Full, fluffy mouthfeel that drifts off your palate. Not many other flavors - spice dominates with clove, but there's noticeably lingering banana.",Bayerische Staatsbrauerei Weihenstephan,Germany,Hefeweizen,98
252,731,lstokes,4.33,"Mmmm. Had this on tap at a bar in Berlin, where they really know how to serve a beer: in a tall weizen glass with a beautiful fluffy head on top of the hazy orange.  Smell was fruity and clovey, not too overpowering, and the taste was the very definition of the beer: citrus, cloves, banana, wheat. Too much clove is probably my pet peeve in these beers, but this was perfectly blended, with a pop of carbonation in a very smooth body and a dry finish. Easy to drink--I had a liter last night!",Bayerische Staatsbrauerei Weihenstephan,Germany,Hefeweizen,98
252,731,BeelzeBrew,4.23,"A: Cloudy orange, with a bright white head which starts off big but quickly recedes and laces the glass nicely. Looks as a Hefeweizen should.  S: A bit watery, but very fruity and pleasant. Lemon, orange, banana and other citrus aromas ( possibly hops) are present.  T: Beautiful balance of citrus zest and fruity sweetness! The aftertaste is of light hops and lemon. Bready yeast, banana and possibly coriander, or something similar.  M: High carbonation. Relatively full-bodied and light, a really great mouthfeel.  d: This beer is as drinkable as beers get.",Bayerische Staatsbrauerei Weihenstephan,Germany,Hefeweizen,98
252,731,sociallooter,4.45,"I poured this into a tall pilsner glass. The head was awesome! I sat out on my patio and drank this very slow to make sure I enjoyed every single drop. While I was drinking I noticed I was pushing my tongue down into the beer in the glass.(Lapping like A dog after A 4 mile run on a 90 degree day!). My girlfriend utters the death phrase, ""Why don't you put a lemon in it?"".noway! I was not going to mask the flavor of this beer with a piece of fruit. I have seen this beer countless times and never picked it up. This beer was rocking! I wish i was drinking it at this moment. I have tried so many heffewissebiers in the past 6 years. The only 2 brews besides Weihenstephaner have really blown me away were Hacker-Pschorr and Franziskaner. Just a good all around great beer.

It ends with a wheaty bread flavor.  M: Medium bodied with little to no carbonation  D: Very drinkable but there isn't much evolution in the brews as it eases its way past your tastebuds",Bayerische Staatsbrauerei Weihenstephan,Germany,Hefeweizen,98
252,731,kylegillick,4.48,"Had on Tap at Weihenstephan Brewery in Freising, Germany.  You have not had a hefeweizen until you have had this beer. My definition of a hefeweizen in two words is : Weihenstephaner Hefeweissbier.  A - An awesome cloudy golden body with a perfect fluffy head. Some lace, but not retain too well.  S - A very balanced smell of citrus, cloves and wheat. Nothing to write home about, but still very nice.  T - Citrus and Cloves strait to the dome, I repeat, Citrus and Cloves! this is amazingly well balanced brew that affords you a full plethora oranges,lemons, cloves, wheat, bread, and maybe a little hint of bananas. Not really a big presence of hops or malts. But it just beckons you to drink more...  M - Medium bodied with not much carbonation. just what you would want or expect from a hefe.  D - The best hefe I have had. It was my staple beer when I lived in Germany. You cannot go wrong with it. Also very inexpensive, probably the cheapest on the Top BA list.",Bayerische Staatsbrauerei Weihenstephan,Germany,Hefeweizen,98

Cloudy and hazy with a thick head....  Wonderful aromas of clove, some of the typical banana, a little yeast and a little wheat... This is everything one could look for in a Hefe... Smells terrific...  This is really a delight to drink... Its delicious and spot on for the style as it should be since its German...wheaty and yeasty with a great banana and clove taste...

Gold and faintly cloudy in appearance, with a fluffy, pillowy white head that piles high. Smells of banana, clove, slight citrus and wheat. Beautiful and not at all overdone. Balanced flavors of classic Hefeweizen in the mouth, with good cut from acidity and carbonation that balances it all very well. Touch of sweetness, and glides down smooothly. Super easy to drink. Outstanding. Easy to love this beer.",Bayerische Staatsbrauerei Weihenstephan,Germany,Hefeweizen,98

The yeast reminds me of some belgian pale ales.  T- Tastes a lot like it smells. Bananas and the distinct yeast flavor. Finishes smooth with a wheat taste. I can see where people get the bubble gum flavors from too. I think the yeast flavor from this is one of my favorite tastes in the beer world.  M- Smooth, even a little slick. Not as crisp and clean as a filtered beer. Very nice.  D- The beer is nearly halfway gone as I get to the drinkability section. How many could I drink? How many do you have? Easy drinking, very refreshing. Excellent example of the style. I can only imagine how much better it would be if I were patient enough to let it get a little colder. It was only refrigerated for a short time. I couldn't stand waiting and I had to open it. Still, an awesome beer.",Bayerische Staatsbrauerei Weihenstephan,Germany,Hefeweizen,98

Huge, very nice foamy head. Attractive beer, good lacing.  S - Nice clove smell with some at first very immersing banana smell that follows up with mild, but present citris. The yeast has a big presense, but it is not overly powerful like many beers of this style. Nicely balanced, yet strong on all fronts.  T - Banana right away, the wheat gets you too. Nice bready taste with a bit of citris and spice thrown in. Very nice.  M - Nice carbonation on a medium bodied beer. Leaves the mouth cleanly.  D - Very easy to drink, none of the flavors are overpowering or leave a bad aftertaste. A little sweet, but not so much that you can't drink it all day.

The nose was excellent. Fresh citrus with orange, banana and clove, just thoroughly juicy and fresh. Bready and wheaty. The palate is perfectly balanced with flavors of citrus (orange), banana and clove presented on a medium, wheaty body. Crisp and well carbonated with a great dry, fruity finish, this beer is nothing short of fantastic. Exceptional stuff.",Bayerische Staatsbrauerei Weihenstephan,Germany,Hefeweizen,98

Aromas of ripe banana balanced by spicy clove, fresh and inviting. Light bubblegum entry, leading to an even lighter banana with accompanying clove spice before making way for a smooth, lightly tart wheat character in the finish. Lingering clove spice with a yeasty twang that invites me in for another drink. Light in body, with a moderate carbonation level that lends itself to a seemingly fuller body.

Appearance: Very strong head, so be careful when you pour into glass. but mild cloudy golden appearance.  Aroma: slightly clove/banana-ish fresh-out-of-oven baguette smell.  Taste: Medium strong strength. Malty, but unlike the smell, the sweetness was more of Apple-ish sweet than banana. bitterness kicks in the middle and leaves mouth with that earthy wheaty bready note.  I (intentionally) tried this beer at various temperatures and I felt that this performs best at around 8-12C  Mouthfeel: Medium-Low carbonation, but overally smooth.

S: Citrus hits you first. then the naked malts and wheat. sweet on the nose for sure. some leafy herbal notes as well. basal or parsley.  T: perfectly balanced. citrus at the forfrount again. tartness like a cider - pear. very dry and welcome finish. alchohol very low key.  M: very carbonated. very light. dry finish.

Banana, clove, lemony citrus, and sweet malt. Light and delicate, but persistent. Nothing stands out, all in balance.  Great flavors in almost perfect balance. Some sweetness comes on at the first swig, with some wheat chafe or yeast in the main body, and some banana in there as well. It's hard to pick out the flavors as they are so well coordinated and balanced. The finish is a bit on the wheat side in the front with a drying linger.  Texture is so smooth on this! Carbonation is damn near perfection and lets this go down incredibly easily. With the fantastic flavors and great mouthfieel, this scores perfectly for drinkability.",Bayerische Staatsbrauerei Weihenstephan,Germany,Hefeweizen,98
252,731,tdawgydog,4.7,"One of the best Hefe's I've ever had. All of the big German Export Hefe's are pretty good but this one is a notch above.  A - Pours a beautiful golden brown wheaty color with a nice head that lingers throughout the life of the beer.  S - Sweet with a little bit of banana that jumps out at the palette when you take your first swig.  T - You can taste the banana along with the wheat. It's a little bit sweeter than your traditional Hefe.  D - At 5.4% ABV I could drink these all night long. The body is perfect, not too gassy, not too thick, just right!!  M - Smooth and enjoyable. Great body. I honestly don't have a bad thing to say about this beer.  Hefe's are one of my favorite genre's.

Some sweet malt qualities; It's a bit spicy; whole--warms the stomach.  Mouthfeel: It feels light and crisp, carbonated, doesn't leave too strong of an aftertaste, rather a faint one that lingers  Drinkability: This brewery's been around for almost a thousand years and they are sure to stay, this beer is unique, has a nice blend of spices.

Smell: Malted buttery wheat as expected with a hint of lemonpeel and banana. Subtle nuances of clove and vanilla with some grassy undertones to boot.  Taste: At the forefront it is a tangy buttery yeast that washes over with a malty backbone then it transforms into a second wave of almost straight-up freshly peeled banana with a pinch of clove. The finish is crisp and leaves behind a thick wheat coating.  Mouthfeel: Superbly carbonated and velvety smooth with a great deal of staying power.  Drinkability: Nothing to set you off from drinking another aside from wheat beers not being your shtick but this could make a believer out of naysayers. Abv is average and would make a great anytime session.  Overall: There is a reason this is Germany's oldest brewery; they know what they are doing.

Taste: Delicious, but not as impressive as the nose. Tangy, with yeasty wheat flavor. Malty banana on the tongue and ground clove. It's like the aroma travels right to your taste buds. Crisp finish, leaves the taste of wheat malt in your mouth.  Mouthfeel: Medium-bodied. Moderate carbonation, just enough to prick the tongue, in a good way. Very smooth, this beer went down fast!

Fully opaque from the glowing murkiness, orange rust in color with a light brown tinge, yellows out around the rims. Relaxed nose of clove spice, pound cake, dried molasses, mostly apricot and pear fruit scents with a touch of banana, lightest graininess which could still register as such. Light-bodied, strong effervescence, the bubbles keep coming and coming at you. Accounting for this, the mouth feel is soft and creamy, gently hugs the contours of your mouth. Clove element fits with lighter pine and lemon peel nuances. A touch breadier here, still not much grain. The malts too are polished and do not lend a great deal of sweetness to the whole.

Mouthfeel: Slighly carbonation-based bite initially, but this fades quickly. A smooth feel follows the initial opening.  Drinkability: This beer is enjoyable in numerous situations. It is smooth and refreshing as a session beer, an excellent companion to many types of food, and interesting enough as a solo project. At 5.4% ABV, one can enjoy several without impairment.

Smell: The nose is sweet and full of fruity yeast with notes of banana, bubble gum and wheat malt.  Taste/Mouth: There are bready and yeast flavors up front with banana notes and a touch of clove coming through.

The golden yellow color is something to behold as the liquid builds up a head that means business, with some easy, lazy lacing coating the inside of the glass. Smell is fruity and slightly malty.  Taste was out of this world, simple as that. For my first hefeweizen, it was amazing. A very bready flavoring, characteristic of the wheat. I also picked up the fruity hints of banana and citrus. I tasted the kick of the bitter hops towards the middle of my tongue. The finish didn't have the slightest hint of bitterness, though, which both surprised and pleased me. The carbonation danced over my tongue and palate, adding a crisp feel to drinking experience. It was so invigorating that I had to consciously pace myself. I still managed to finish it rather quicker than I would have wanted.  I'm more of a stout person, but the great experience I had with this Weihenstephaner has put it firmly in my 'favorite beers' list. I would definitely drink it again. And again.

252,731,augustgarage,4.6,"Poured from a 500mL bottle into my Ayinger weizen glass. Bottled 2/06/2009 (bottle code ""6069""), so this sample is over 6 months old.  Liquid is somewhere between pale old gold and selective yellow, cloudy, and topped with an initially gargantuan head of foam which while thick recedes to less than a finger in height, leaving cresting waves of lacing behind.  The most balanced aroma of any weissbier I've encountered, the perfect marriage of phenols and esters. Banana and strawberry present first, followed up by pepper and clove. Textbook.  Sipping leads to an intensification of the aromas on the palate, leading into the complex flavors of freshly baked, artisan whole wheat bread, with a hint of allspice and citrus (lemon, orange) in the finish. Lovely.  Medium-light bodied, fairly creamy, but very refreshing due to the high carbonation.  One of the very best expressions of the style.

Dry but very smooth mouthfeel, light to medium body, sweet on the tongue and fairly lively as far as carbonation is concerned. Very good beer, perfect example for the style.",Bayerische Staatsbrauerei Weihenstephan,Germany,Hefeweizen,98
252,731,jgasparine,4.53,"A- Poured a hazy honey color w/ no active carbonation visible from the sides of the glass. The careful pour yielded a HUGE rocky, well-retained, cream-colored head... with incredible lacing. Absolutely picture perfect!  S- Banana and clove are the most prominent aromas on the nose, along with some breadlike malt character and restrained aromas of lemongrass. Can't wait to taste!  T- Tastes like banana bread covered in a banana buttercream icing. I'm getting some sweet cookielike maltiness, some slight restrained tartness (presumably from the wheat), and some restrained spiciness (clove?). Super long/lingering banana finish. Absolutely delicious!  M- Full, beautifully creamy body with tons of beautifully soft carbonation. Just exquisite.  D- Um... YES! I can drink these all day and all night. The appearance, aromas, flavor and texture are all incredible...and the relatively low ABV makes this super quaffable!  Note: I was very tempted to give this straight 5's across the board, but resolved that ONE DAY, I might find something better (but I doubt it!!)",Bayerische Staatsbrauerei Weihenstephan,Germany,Hefeweizen,98

Body is slightly cloudy, amber color.  Smell is extremely wheaty, with a hint of citrus and banana.  Hits the tip of tongue with a strong taste of citrus. Light bodied and moves to the back of mouth leaving a wheat aftertaste.  Perfect for a summer afternoon.",Bayerische Staatsbrauerei Weihenstephan,Germany,Hefeweizen,98
252,731,RyWill,4.63,"After a summer full of wheat beers, whatever the variety, this is always one I can happily come back to.  Appearance: Hazy golden yellow with very apparent carbonation and a large, frothy, bright white head. Lacing is solid for the style all the way through.  Smell: Banana and some citrus. This is one that's certainly about the taste, how it should be.  Taste/Mouthfeel: Take the smell, add some spice, the perfect amount of carbonation and you may have the perfect hefe. The mouthfeel is light, bubbly and perfect for anytime you need refreshment.  Drinkability: I could drink this beer anytime, summer, winter, after a plethora of mediocre wheat beers, anything. Certainly a benchmark for the style.",Bayerische Staatsbrauerei Weihenstephan,Germany,Hefeweizen,98
252,731,woosterbill,4.43,"Half-liter bottle into a Duvel tulip - I know, not the right glass for the style, but it fit beautifully.  A: Cloudy orange-gold body topped with a towering, rocky head of fine white foam. Great retention, but not as much lace as could be desired. All in all, great looking for the style.  S: Banana, banana, banana. Delicious, but just a bit one-dimensional; I couldn't get anything else out of the aroma.  T: Everything you could want out of a hefe: rich banana fruitiness up front, followed by some spicy yeast notes and a round, drying maltiness on the finish. Delicious.  M: Prickly carbonation at first, mellowing into a smooth, medium body.  D: Hugely refreshing, and eminently quaffable. I'd be happy sessioning this beer all day on a hot summer afternoon.  Notes: quite possibly the best all around hefe I've ever had; lives up to its reputation in every way.  Cheers!",Bayerische Staatsbrauerei Weihenstephan,Germany,Hefeweizen,98
252,731,kels,4.53,"Appearance: Poured from the bottle into a pint glass. It is a bright lemony yellow, slightly hazy, with a lot of bubbles of carbonation running throughout and feeding a well-retained 1/2 finger fluffy white head. A pretty substantial amount of slippery white lace clings to the sides of the glass.  Smell: Really nice and appetizing aromas of dry, toasted wheat and bright citrusy lemon come through more strongly than expected. The smell is bright and clean and refreshing.  Taste/Mouthfeel: Everything about this beer is light and refreshing. The flavors of lightly toasted malts and hearty, but not heavy wheat come together with a subtly bitter and very bright lemony presence that leaves a tart flavor in the aftertaste. There's no trace of alcohol at all. The feel is very well-carbonated and the beer finishes clean with no stickiness or oiliness to weigh it down.  Drinkability: Extremely high - this beer is so refreshing and tasty that's it's great to drink on its own or with food. Definitely a quintessential summer beer.",Bayerische Staatsbrauerei Weihenstephan,Germany,Hefeweizen,98

Taste follows the nose to a point, banana and clove flavors. Just a hint of citrus. Funky yeast adds another wrinkle of flavor.  Mouthfeel is very smooth and medium to full bodied.

Small white bubble top ring left behind.  Smells of peppery clove and sweet bready yeast. Citrus friut. Its too complex for me to descibe honestly.  Nice sour complexity in the flavor. It tastes like a farmhouse brew. Sweet notes with a sour kick. Bread/yeast, orange/lemon zest, and spice.  Smooth mouth coating effect that leaves long before the NICE sour aftertaste.  Two bottles, one before dinner, and one while eating dinner was great.

I see a sheep, and a happy guy drinking a great beer!  S- All the usual suspects for a good hefe, banana's, cloves, bubblegum, wheat. But this beer, the bouquet is fantastic! And let me set this straight, ""bouquet"" is not a word I use normally but this beer has brought me to a place where ""bouquet"" was the word I needed to use to get my point across.  T- Yeasty Wheat bread, a slight banana and clove hit in the middle and a little bitter slightly metal taste at he end.  M&D - Well carbonated as it should be, but not so much that it foams up in my mouth. Easy drinking with a very clean and pleasant aftertaste.

Taste- Bananas and cloves with traces of bubblegum, all beautifully integrated with a delicate hop flavor.  Mouthfeel- Wonderful scrubbing-bubbly carbonation with a full bodied, yeasty quality.  Drinkability- It's hard to stop drinking. The carbonation makes it so refreshing, particularly on a hot day, and makes it particularly good at meals with a little spice.",Bayerische Staatsbrauerei Weihenstephan,Germany,Hefeweizen,98

Good banana flavour. Lots of clove. No bubblegum. It's very subtle and well balanced - no one flavour overwhelms the others.  Medium body and finely carbonated. Smooth and satisfying. A very subtle hefe that doesn't go over the top with the fruit/candy-like flavours found in this style of beer. I normally like my hefes a little bit more over-the-top, but this really won me over. I enjoyed this a great deal.",Bayerische Staatsbrauerei Weihenstephan,Germany,Hefeweizen,98
252,731,HalfFull,4.35,"Poured from a 500 ml. bottle into a small weizen glass. Pours hazy, carbonated and a bit light, perhaps lemony-orange in color. Color deepened when yeast bottom was added to the glass. A rich soapy head is unavoidable, slowly caving in to the Earth's gravitational pull, and at times, very slowly.  Nose is of banana and yeast, slightly sour and with a touch of light funk after the initial pour. An added pour freshens the beer, offering expected notes of banana and clove. The nose remains quite complex however, yielding a nice sweet/sour balance.  Taste is initially a bit watery but nice and full with lots of carbonation and a light bready texture. Feel improves right away after a swirl or after pouring a fresh ounce or two into the glass. The initial pour outgassed too much I would say. Offers a moderate texture on the palate.  This beer has a tendency to outgas too much so pour carefully. Good feel and drink couple with a good carbonation level, maintaining a consisted surface cap. Nice drinkability.  Overall I really dig the yeast nose on this beer, but it otherwise falls short of it's juxtaposed Hacker-Pschorr brethren.",Bayerische Staatsbrauerei Weihenstephan,Germany,Hefeweizen,98

S - Smells of banana and cloves, with a hint of spices (citrus, coriander).  T - Wonderful hefeweizen flavor, with the banana and cloves coming through. Definitely a hint of citrus fruit, but not overpowering like a Belgian Wit. A clear hop finish to balance it out.  M - Crisp & clean. Good carbonation. Nice summery mouthfeel.  D - I could drink these all day. Reasonable ABV makes it the perfect session beer. Highly flavorful for a hefeweizen.

Banana and clove dominate, but are never thick. Spicy and sweey, but not overly so. Such a nice thing to smell. Some background light leafy character cuts the sweetness.  T/M - Fluffy and light feeling liquid. Carbonation is never biting. Wheat dominates the taste with the banana and clove highlights in the background. That leafy character I can't place is more prominent here.  D - Endlessly drinkable. Light and tasty.",Bayerische Staatsbrauerei Weihenstephan,Germany,Hefeweizen,98
252,731,hossua34,4.67,"A - Hazy, light orange-yellow in color. A pretty big head with somewhat disappointing staying power; leaves a thick layer of foam however, and pretty good lacing.  S- Smell is of banana bread, bubble gum, cloves, a mild citrus note and... rock candy? I don't know, something very sweet.  T - A big doughy, buttery, oaky first taste followed by the taste of fresh citrus and wheat. The taste of banana bread lingers on the palate for a little while.  M - Mouthfeel is big and creamy, almost too creamy.  D - The high carbonation level and thick mouthfeel hinder the drinkability of this one somewhat. Still, a very tasty (and authentic) hefeweissen - probably the best I've ever tried out of a bottle.  Edit - After a few days' passage, and still thinking about how good that Weihenstephaner Hefe was, I got another. It was even better the second time. I decided to come back and increase my taste score to a perfect 5... Seriously, this is one damn good Hefeweissen.",Bayerische Staatsbrauerei Weihenstephan,Germany,Hefeweizen,98

S-Lots of carmelized sugar on the nose, along with fruit - bananas and apricots along with the typcial citrus-lemon smell of a hefe. Very pleasant and complex T-Smooth and very well-balanced. Lemon evens out some of that carmelized sugar. This is a very nice, not wimpy hefe. Leaves a bit of a sour aftertaste, but I expect that from this style.

I used a hefe glass, and got basically a perfect pour. Smell of banana, wheat and some yeast, right on for the stlye. Very nice, refreshing citrus flavor - no need for a lemon wedge here. Banana, a tiny bit of bubblegum-like sweetness, and wheat flavors fill the palate. A bit of a spice finish, clove and pepper, rather than any hop bitterness. Crisp, tart mouthfeel, with appropriate carbonation, dry finish. A very good beer to beat the heat, but would also match well with food.

Absolutely brilliant golden-yellow with a great, large, fluffy white head that lingers for quite some time. Superb head retention that slowly reduces to a full silky canopy and lace.  Very vibrant bouquet with major hints of banana, citrus, and a hint of cloves and vanilla.  Tastes of malty white, clove, majorly quenching citrus and banana.  Great level of carbonation, with a lively, but light-medium body.  I can drink this all day, it's quenching, 'just right' ABV for a perfect session beer.

252,731,infi,4.35,"Poured into a weizen glass.  The appearance is a hazy, translucent and light yellow-orange with a few carbonation streams rising to the top. The initial pour creates a fat bubbly and frothy white head that lasts for about 1 to 2 minutes and then subsequently becomes a cap. Head is very large out of the initial pour, but doesn't give way to much lacing after each taste. The aroma is full of fresh wheat and active yeast, along with big scents of the banana esters and subtle clove spiciness. Very delightful though and through. The taste is great and complex with the breadiness of the yeast and some sweetness from the malt and banana. The clove becomes apparent towards the end along with a slight orange rind flavor.  The mouthfeel is incredibly smooth - there's a sort of creaminess to this beer. It has a medium-bodied feel with not just enough alluring carbonation on the tongue. As it goes down, it leaves a beautiful crisp touch in the mouth. The drinkability is VERY high. There's a reason why this is the highest rated sessionable beer - it's the total package. Big flavor and drinkability with its relatively low 5.4% ABV and price - sixers or singles. Without a doubt, a winner. I would definitely drink a couple of these in a night's session.",Bayerische Staatsbrauerei Weihenstephan,Germany,Hefeweizen,98

A nice bready yeast flavor balanced perfectly by the banana and citrus tastes. Wow I'm in hefe heaven.  This is the best Hefe I have had. I have had it in the past but didnt realize how damn good it is. Obviously I would love to taste test my favorites of this style and rank them accordingly - but this to me is the best example of the style I have had. It could be drank by the truck load.

252,731,BlackBearForge,4.2,"Pours a tawny golden orange, cloudy of course, with a huge foamy whitish head which falls fairly quickly leaving thick curtains of oily lace.  The first whiff of this beer was incredibly fresh and crisp, with hints of orange and a something else my wife identifies oddly enough as root beer.  I taste muted banana and clove as expected, with clove perhaps being the stronger of the two, very balanced with the slightly bitter wheat and sweet from the malt. The orange in the aroma is present as well. This beer becomes even more rounded and flavorful with warming  The mouthfeel is quite nice, medium bodied and very creamy. Nicely carbonated despite the huge head but not overdone.  Very drinkable as would be expected from such a balanced beer, especially after it warmed a bit. I perhaps like the banana flavors more than the clove.

Mouthfeel: medium-light body with just the right carbonation.  Drinkability: highly drinkable. It's a hot evening here, but I see it being a great drink when working outdoors.

Heavier cloves than I've noticed with other hefe's.  MF) Smooth, plenty of carbonation, medium mouthfeel.  D) Fantastic. A great hot-day-after-moving beer. And just 5.4% ABV.

The head is fluffy and about an inch and a half, but quickly recedes, with patches of lacing remain on the sides when sipped.  Smell: Lots of clove in the nose, with light wheat smell as well.  Taste: Holy ham that's a lot of clove, it very powerful and pushes anything else to the back. There is a light banana bread flavor in the background, but clove is the predominate flavor.  Mouthfeel: Light and airy, even with all the clove flavor, this brew is still easy to drink.  Drinkability: Maybe I got an old bottle, but this is the cloviest hefe I have ever had. It makes me not like this beer as much as some other hefes.

Smell: Light floral notes, and lots of wheat on the nose. It has an understated smell, very nice.  Taste: Great tasting hefe with characteristic banana and clove flavors.

Appearance: Pours a pale straw yellow with a very clear body that shows moderately strong carbonation; it comes with a 1 and 1/2 finger head this very white, but fades especially quickly to a very thin and uneven skim on the surface; a very loose lacing tries to hold to the glass and falls quickly back into the beer.  Smell: A very powderery tartness (yet a little sweet as well, kind of like a SweetTart candy) with a grainy/yeasty scent coming up as well.  Taste/Mouthfeel: Very much a grassy/grainy wheaty flavor; some aspects of yeast and that tartness really comes through in the aftertaste, and I would also say that it affects the mouthfeel as wel as it makes me want to pucker just a little bit (is this what ""cloying"" is?); mouth is also tingly from the carbonation and it feels very lively.  Drinkability: Quite high, it's a nice tasting beer with a very interesting mouthfeel - it's got a relatively light body and it quenches the thirst on a nice hot day. The ABV is also very manageable, so I would say that it would be easy to get through three of these in a night, if not more as long as I'm not driving",Bayerische Staatsbrauerei Weihenstephan,Germany,Hefeweizen,98

After A while the head dissipates a little and has an appealing rocky structure. Some lacings.  S: Lots of malted wheat and barley with notes of spices and banana. Hints of lemon and light phenols.  T: A rather soft but prominent malt presence of barley and wheat dominates. Lots of white bread and crackers. Well balanced flavors of banana and spices (cloves) take over in the middle. Notes of yeast with an earthy twang. The finish is gentle and a bit short with lots of mild spicy notes, some phenols and a light fruitiness. A minimal taste of alcohol in the finish as well. No real bitterness.  M: Medium body, not very crisp due to the gentle carbonation.  D: This is a hard beer for me to review since I generally have a problem with hefeweizens - I don't really like the style. I'm often underwhelmed by their flavors, short finish and mouthfeel. That being said, I think this one is quite good and I can see why it's conceived of as a real classic. It has a well balanced character, and both spices and fruit esters are pleasant and kept at bay (in some hezeweizens they are too prominent in my opinion). Easy to drink and refreshing, but it's not very interesting or exciting.",Bayerische Staatsbrauerei Weihenstephan,Germany,Hefeweizen,98

The main flavor is of wheat with fruit, citrus, and spice hints. There are a few Hefes that I have had and prefer so I am leaving room for them in the taste ranking.  M: The in mouth carbonation is a bit aggressive. It is on the thin side of medium as far as body.  D: This one really excels here. It goes down incredibly easy.

Appearance: Cloudy golden color with thick creamy and foamy head that dissipated pretty slowly and laces beautifully.  Smell: Bananas, clove, bubblegum sweetness. Classic Hefe aromas.  Taste: Sweet, yeasty, wheaty. A perfect example of the HefeWeizen style. So sweet and delicious it does a little dance on the tongue.  Mouthfeel: Slippery, creamy and perfectly carbonated.  Drinkability: One of the best HefeWeizens in the world. I have been drinking these for years (after living in Germany for a couple of years when I was younger), and it's always a perfect session beer when I'm in the mood for a HefeWeizen.

Pours a cloudy yellow with some hints of orange and a fizzy but dense white head that quickly dissolves into a good layer atop the glass. The aroma is banana, clove, fruity esters and yeast, slightly bubble-gummy. The taste is sweet upfront and accompanied by some earthy notes and ends a touch tart with a nice semi-dry finish.

The head was white and fluffy, almost like marshmellow when viewing it. Now I poured the last remaining amount from the bottle and the ale becomes typically cloudy.  The smell is refreshing bananas, bubblegum and cloves and spicy malt aromas. I don't know the age of the bottle, but odor indicates freshness.  The initial sweet taste of banana like flavor is followed by lingering bubblegum flavor and malts. This was lighter in flavor than I remember, but still flavorful. Very good bready, yeasty flavors come forth as the weizen warms.  A decent spritzy fell on the tongue with the right amount of carbonation for this style. Again, lighter in body than I remember.  The blend of flavors and light body make this one very quaffable for the summer. However, I always remember this one having more complexity than I am tasting now.

252,731,BARFLYB,4.45,"""I had a bananer in there.""- Junior Soprano.  I cant believe I have not had this in all my years killing my liver. Baby steps, I suppose.  A- Weihenstephaner Hefeweissbier is a golden colored hefe with a liquid honey look to itself with some light. A nice inch of frothy silky white foam graces the top for a bit before dissipating into a faint skim, very minimal lacing.  S- This smells great with a nice balance of wheat, sweet malt, bananers and light spice including clove. The clove is lighter than I expected. Some light lemon spritz in here. Also getting some sweet honey from this surprisingly.  T- The cloves come out a bit more in taste which is nice. The wheat is up next followed by bananer boats. Not getting any presence of hops in this one making for a smooth ride. Some more sweet malt giving off bananer bread. Some light citrus appeal.  M- Smooth as silk, goes down without a hitch. This is light bodied with low carbonation. No aftertaste at all, this hits you quick and leaves even quicker. No alcohol getting in the way in this low ABV'er. Smooth and tasty enough to down 100oz or so.  D- Easy as pie, this low abv hefe is the golden standard and now I see why. Entirely two drinkable and I would love to drink this out of a boot at a German festival, and get it all over myself. Refreshing is an understatement, would love to find a case of this for the summer months, although I would drink this year round.",Bayerische Staatsbrauerei Weihenstephan,Germany,Hefeweizen,98

252,731,adamette,4.55,"Live review. Purchased at Cost Plus World Market in Mentor for about $2.99, ""One pint, 9 fl. Ounces"" bottle poured into my Samuel Smith pint glass.  A 5 inch head after a moderately vigorous pour. The head passed the crest of the glass as one more ounce would have sent it spilling over the top. It took a good 2 minutes to settle from there, leaving some nice lacing. Dark yellow translucent body, a bit darker than the ""Original Premium"" that I sampled moments ago. 4.5  S At first I thought I picked up some smoky notes as in a Rauchbier but repeated sniffs revealed that this was not the case. I smell the sweet citrus and wheat that I am now familiar with from a Hefe and I love it. This is a classic Hefe if there could be one. Any fruit or citrus smell is not dramatic. The wheat dominates. 4.5  T/M/D Ahhh...this is a great Hefe. Nice ""soft"" wheat taste over a very light syrupy feel and light malt and very little hops. I get only a shade of banana and spice profile is not high (cloves can be common in Hefe's). This makes it ultimately very drinkable since to me the wheat taste is delicious and gentle enough to experience repeatedly. The ABV is low enough to again make it very drinkable as well. 4.5 4.0 5.0  Notes: I was prepared for a classic Hefe and this beer delivers on that suggestion. I am very impressed by how drinkable that it is.",Bayerische Staatsbrauerei Weihenstephan,Germany,Hefeweizen,98

T: Heaven in a glass. The clove is the main taste as first, with bread, and some hops, but mostly its like a loaf of banana wheat bread with cloves and lemon orange on top. Number 1 hefeweissbier to me period. Liquid gold here folks.  M: medium body, very refreshing, yeast is there but not overpowering. Light carbonation.

The smell is sweet and yeasty, with some of the wheat character coming through as well as a bit of citrus and spiciness. The taste starts off with some sweet wheat malt that gives way to a hint of lemon that goes into a mix of spiciness and a tiny bit of hops to balance. This is what a hefe should taste like. The mouthfeel is slightly thick with some fine carbonation. This is a great beer for a warm night or anytime at all.

Smell: Vibrant, aromatic scent of wheat malt, ruthlessly mashed bananas liberally seasoned with vanilla sugar and clove, and even lemon peel.  Taste: Sweet, tangy taste of wholesome wheat malt. What follows is rich, full flavors of ripe bananas, vanilla cream, and fresh cracked cloves. Small, meager spritz of lemon juice. A few added shreds of Big League Chew. One slice from a Red Delicious apple. Very light Noble hop character and bitterness. Just the perfect amount of overall spiciness to the taste. Finishes dry, crisp, with one final taste of malted wheat.  Mouthfeel: Medium-bodied. Moderate carbonation. Smooth mouthfeel, yet it remains nicely effervescent.

It's got a bold feel, but goes down easy, it's sweet but has a dry finish. Creamy and delicious. One of the most refreshing beers I can imagine. Negligible bitterness, perfect for the style.  This is a style that is perfected by the brewers of Munich. Just like it's hard to find a good American brewed Weissbier, it's hard to find a flawed German brewed one.

The plus is at 5.4% you can enjoy it most anytime, from your favorite lawnmower beer to enhancing good food.  The lacy head should be allowed to come to full potential to allow the esters in the beer to release the aromas and taste you expect.  It has enough carbonation to provide a crisp refreshing taste with a dry finish. It has hazy golden color as expected of an unfiltered beer.

I realized after that the bottle I had bought was 3.5 years old! Needless to say, I was determined to try a fresh bottle. The review that follows is based on that fresh bottle.  A: Poured from a bottle into a hefe glass. The pour went well and a beautiful thick head was formed in the glass typical of the style. The beer is a nice looking golden yellow with an orange tint. It looks very appetizing.  S: Banana and clove. It also smells a little citrusy, lemon I think. I also get a bit of yeast.  T: Citrusy up front, but not too much. I get more of the banana and clove spicyness in the middle. It finishes crisp with a not unpleasent aftertaste that reminds me vaguely of the sugary bubblegum I used to chew as a kid. The evident wheat pulls everything together the whole way through. This is one tasty beer.  M: Lots of carbonation, which was expected. The beer is crisp and light. It is smooth and really fun to drink.  D: I could drink this all the time. This beer has made me fall in love with the style. I cracked this open on a humid, 95 degree day and it was incredibly refreshing. I wish I has another to follow up the first.  I am very happy I gave this beer a second shot with a fresh bottle. I can't tell you what a difference it made. The aromas alone in a fresh bottle make the beer.

Flavor is exceptional, banana bread, cloves, spices, delicious wheaty goodness, absolute perfection. Mouthfeel is very full and thick, every aspect of the flavor of this beer is prominent and fills out perfectly. As for drinkability I could drink this all day, it's wonderful.  Best part about this beer is that I'm drinking it right now. The only bad point is that in a few months it will be nearly a year before I can easily get more.

T - Lots of sweet, bubblegum-like flavors here. The fruit notes that were present on the nose give way to candy and spice flavors. The candy flavors are a bit much for my taste, but they are well-integrated with the complex spice profile.  M - Very crisp and clean, with lingering sweetness from the candy flavors.  D - I can appreciate this beer for how well-constructed it is (and has been for nearly a millennium!).

252,731,laituegonflable,4.12,"Pours a hazy, yellow colour with enormous white head and good, busy carbonation bead. Head sinks slowly and evenly across the top, but sticks around impressively for the most part. Clings to the glass when tilted, but doesn't leave huge amounts of lacing. Quite exemplary wheat beer.  Very spicy nose with a huge clove hit. Hints around the edge of coriander, banana and a very metallic, chemical aroma. Mostly that sweet but spicy aroma though. Again, exemplaring. Reviewing this now having drunk it so often in the past makes me realise that I've unconsciously spent years reviewing weizens against this one. This just embodies hefe smell.  Taste has far more banana character on it than the nose. Taste is sweet and light with a threshed wheat kind of character followed by a long, tangy banana flavour for most of the palate with hints of basil, coriander and oregano. The back is a nice spicey brush of the tastebuds with a strong clove character and hints of fresh cut grass.  Mouthfeel is quite tingly and almost bitey thanks to the beer's apparent acidity. Otherwise feels slightly thin, I suppose it's appropriate but I think there's enough flavour to expect a thicker body. Overall, while it's beautifully complex and rich in flavour, the sensation it gives me is ever-so-slightly offputting because it is quite tart, like unrripe fruit, and slightly bitey, rendering it not quite quaffable. But it's a prime example of the joy that wheat can produce, and a fine, fine piece of brewing art.",Bayerische Staatsbrauerei Weihenstephan,Germany,Hefeweizen,98

Loads of fruit notes (banana, citrus, and apple) and wheat. The yeastiness is moderate, which is a definite advantage. Finishes slightly dry and bready, with some fruity undertones.  M: Light-to-medium bodied, but definitely not watery for a wheat-beer. The carbonation is just perfect, very balanced. Goes down quite smooth, even though the alcohol shows a little bit.

252,731,PsychoJedi,4.66,"I am telling you! This company makes the best smelling beers! Like its brother, highest marks for smell. Appearance has a nice head that dissipates in an interesting fashion by fizzing faster in some parts of the pilsner glass than in other areas. The color is mostly clear golden, but some haze in it. Taste is a good, clean, but still openly German. I could drink this beer all day if I had nothing to do or was afraid of the hangover I have discovered in my older age. Goes down smooth and no aftertaste. I highly recommended this great German beer.",Bayerische Staatsbrauerei Weihenstephan,Germany,Hefeweizen,98
252,731,natelocc787,4.42,"Outstanding example of the style.  Rusty yellow gold with a good sized antique white head.  Outstanding nose on this beer! Flavor profile redolent of a fruit salad consisting of bananas, pears, golden apples and more bananas! The bready malt is there as well balanced with hops that don't show up much in the aroma.  Taste is very wheaty and fruity. Combined with the light fluffy body and the appearance of spices like clove and coriander this makes for a very appealing and refreshing brewski. I had fun sifting through the different fruit profiles and the yeast contributed nicely to the finish.  Medium to light body. Creamy and fluffy.  Almost like a wheat lambic with a heavier, wetter finish. Very tasty and findable. This makes a great lawnmower brew for the wheat heads.",Bayerische Staatsbrauerei Weihenstephan,Germany,Hefeweizen,98
252,731,MyGoodness,4.8,"There's a local place that has this on-tap, and you know what they say... Once you go tap... (Yes, very lame joke)... Onwards: It's a beautiful beer to look at. It's sunny and hazy with a lovely thick head. Celestial looking. The smell is a wonderful prelude to the first sip; it is loaded with wheat and a definitive banana whiff (not artificial or overly sweet either). The taste is perfect. It's easy to drink, filling, not too heavy on the carbonation. The banana bite is just right, unlike other hefes that have failed to nail this crucial part. Mouthfeel is on the thin side but not a problem at all. This one's in my top 3, if that means anything to you haha. [Insert little heart pictures all over this review if it will help clarify my feelings towards this baby].",Bayerische Staatsbrauerei Weihenstephan,Germany,Hefeweizen,98
252,731,JMD,4.45,"A: Beautiful cloudy lemon color with tints of auburn. Huge fluffy head, and great lacing.  S: Bananas, clove, hints of wheat and vanilla.  T: Great flavor, and perfect example of a german Hefe, bananas, spices, pepper, and vanilla. Delicious brew.  M: Nice and smooth, moderate carbonation  D: This is a great hefe, and a perfect interpretation of the style. Highly drinkable and full of flavor. The American versions that have become a standard for summer seasonals, don't stand up to the German counterparts. This one is excellent.",Bayerische Staatsbrauerei Weihenstephan,Germany,Hefeweizen,98
252,731,civilizedpsycho,4.63,Poured bottle into a pint glass.  Appearance: Nice cloudy golden color with a nice head that dissipated pretty slowly.  Smell: Sweet malt with a little banana scent to it.  Taste: Excellent. Sweet but not too sweet with a hint of the banana flavor and very refreshing.  Mouthfeel: Fairly thin but had some body to it. Not too much carbonation either.  Drinkability: One word: Excellent.  This is one of the best beers I've ever had. It works in every situation. It's good with food or on its own. It's good on a hot day or a cool day. It's good to just have one or half a dozen. It's simply a great beer.,Bayerische Staatsbrauerei Weihenstephan,Germany,Hefeweizen,98

Nice foamy head wirth excellent retention  s: sweet smell of wheat, also hint of banana ester from the yeast.  t: Very good beer, light, sweet and the yeast esters provide nice caracter of banana, clove, bubble gum.

Cloudy lemon yellow color. Large, radiant white head with great retention and lace.  Smells of clove, mushy banana sugar, and twinkies with hints of lemongrass.  Dude...it tastes like vanilla banana pudding. Peppery clove spice in there as well. Wheaty yeast in back that blends rather than snaps.  I'm a fan.",Bayerische Staatsbrauerei Weihenstephan,Germany,Hefeweizen,98
252,731,drinkininthewood,4.62,"500ml bottle from the lcbo. BB 2010  Served in a rhinelander glass.  A- Hazy gold with a nice white, creamy head of sticky foam, lots of nice lacing.  S- Your standard aromas of clove, banana and melon with some hints of vanilla.  T- some nice malt up front with good clove flavor, some citrus mid palate without the expected tartness though it is there but slightly subdued. The finish is a mellowing banana flavor rich with nice spices.  M- So smooth and soft on my tongue. Delicate. Light bodied. The perfect carbonation.  D- A great drink.  Overall i'm quite impressed. I've been looking forward to trying this brew and with good reason. This is by far hands down one of the absolute benchmark Hefeweizens. Hopefully no one else was planning on picking up the remaining 9 bottles at the store because i'm heading right back there!",Bayerische Staatsbrauerei Weihenstephan,Germany,Hefeweizen,98
252,731,malcontent,4.55,"Have I really never reviewed this?  One of those benchmark beers against which others are measured, the appearance, with it's huge rocky head and cloudy, hyperactive golden body are gorgeous.  On the clove-forward end of the spectrum, just a hint of banana and no real bubblegum presence. Intoxicating.  Rich flavor that I look for in a real German hefe with lemony edges around a smooth, soft wheat body. Just a touch of sweetness to the finish with the clove suggested on the back end.  Not quite as carbonated as others but with a full, round mouthfeel that so many American imitators fall short of. This is as drinkable as the style gets and consistently hits the spot.",Bayerische Staatsbrauerei Weihenstephan,Germany,Hefeweizen,98
252,731,MeisterBurger,4.43,"Pours a honeyed brown with a billowy white, creamy head with yeast in evident, hazy suspension. Excellent head retention throughout.  The smell is exactly what you would expect, with yeast, clove and banana with some floral notes. Nice but not overdone. A powdery baseball card bubblegum starts to show up towards the end.  Starts with a wheaty lemony tartness, there's a pinch of bitterness and spice in the middle all leading to a clean, dry finish with mild elements of banana all throughout. The clove lingers nicely in the aftertaste as does a hint of orange peel zest.  Has a crisp and clean mouthfeel and a medium amount of carbonation, perfect for a hot and hazy day.  If I had to sum this beer up in a word that word would be refined. If I had to use more words I would say it's pretty much a textbook hefeweisen and a benchmark for the style. Highly drinkable. But it's a notch below Franziskaner and Denison's in my eyes.",Bayerische Staatsbrauerei Weihenstephan,Germany,Hefeweizen,98
252,731,EatsTacos,4.87,"Pours a cloudy, hazed yellow with a puffy, pillowy head  Smell is very strongly banana with underlying citrus notes of lemon and lime rind, slight sour apple, and a lot of corriander and yeasty aromas  Taste: The banana flavour is not overly sweet but borders almost on a tartness or sourness, the yeast characteristics give this beer a lot of depth and complexities that some other hefes lack. Next to no hop profile, but the vanilla in the middle is great, and this is a beer that you can actually taste the wheat.  Mouthfeel: Medium bodied with a very soft, light carbonation",Bayerische Staatsbrauerei Weihenstephan,Germany,Hefeweizen,98
252,731,drtth,4.03,"Chilled and a 12 oz bottle poured into a 0.5 liter Weizen glass. Glass of cold water on the side to sip from periodically.  Appearance: The beer pours out a rich hazy gold color with a 2"" thick white fluffy head that recedes slowly leaving sides of glass coated and a thick pillow of foam over the liquid. Sipping leave some partial sheets of lacing with smaller patches here and there. The head seems bound and determined to remain to the end of the beer.  Smell: The aroma is fresh and refreshing and contains clove, some citrus (orange I think) with some nice banana notes.  Taste: The flavor of the beer is soft and pleasant and is consistent with the aroma. There are notes of clove, some nice hints of banana and some taste of orange. Some very light hopping shows up once in a while to cut the sweetness.  Mouthfeel: The mouth feel is soft and creamy with nice light carbonation. The finish is medium to short, begins with the full flavors of the beer and tapers off with a long, lightly sweet but citrus tart ending.  Drinkability: This is a very drinkable Hefe and I could easily have more. I don't know that I enjoy it more than some of the others I've tried (e.g., Ayinger Brau Weisse) but I'm going to enjoy finding out. I will certainly be drinking this one again and it is on my shopping list.",Bayerische Staatsbrauerei Weihenstephan,Germany,Hefeweizen,98

The flavor is not as sweet as I thought it would be, it is muted nicely by light bitterness and nice hints of spices. This is well balanced. Has a dry texture. I would give it a light body.

S: Strong, yeasty banana and bubble gum smell that wafts up to the nostrils even when held several feet away.  T: What you smell is what you get. I'd be more of a fan of this style if they all tasted like this.  M: Appealing light carbonated mouthfeel. Crisp and refreshing.  D: Perfect warm weather beer or as a midday treat with brunch or a lite lunch.  Served: in a Weizen glass.",Bayerische Staatsbrauerei Weihenstephan,Germany,Hefeweizen,98

Cloudy but crisp. Exactly how a hefe should look.  S - Bready, yeasty and definitely cloves. A bit of fruitiness and banana, maybe a bit of citrus.  T- Just like it smells. Bread in a bottle, with lots of yeast. Wheat is forward, with lots of cloves and a mild amount of banana and sugar. Citrus to add a bit of tartness. Most refreshing at pour, gaining yeast and bread as it warms.  M- Super smooth, crisp. Light coating of the tongue allowing flavors to linger. Moderate carbonation that enhances the overall taste. About perfect.  D- Very refreshing on this warm day, and easy to down but begs to be savored. Can't taste the alcohol, and easily could consume two or three of these.

There is effervescence in the beer. The clarity of the beer is cloudy.  Nose: A very nice wheat aroma with citrus, phenols, and floral esters. The wheat does come across as slightly bready.  Taste. A very rich wheat flavor with some breadiness. The other flavors are a little phenol, floral esters, and citrus.  Overall: The mouth feel is carbonated, crisp, and slightly astringent.

252,731,originalsin,4.68,"God Damn I love starting the night this way.  The pour on this bad boy yields a full inch of beautiful off white cloudy head that slowly but surely dissipates and laces beautifully the whole way down. It's a straw-gold color and all kinds of hazy. This is a gorgeous hefe. What else can I say.  The nose is full of the crispest and freshest banana and clove. Another reminder why I'm always coming back to hefes. There's wheat on the nose as well in addition to a slight hint of citrus that certainly piques my interest.  Wow. This is a near perfect beer. Drinkability is literally off the charts. Goes down so incredibly smooth and leaves you feeling more refreshed than any BMC could ever dream of. The wheat flavor stays with you well after you take that first gulp..second gulp...third gulp. Somebody stop me ! There's even a little bit of citrus that lingers on the top of my mouth.  Honest to god, this is quite possibly the best Hefeweizen I have ever had. I've been drinking so much Franziskaner lately and this is so different yet still manages to stick out as a beautiful beautiful hefe. And to think I got this bottle for under 2 dollar....It's going to be a spectacular summer.",Bayerische Staatsbrauerei Weihenstephan,Germany,Hefeweizen,98

The hefe yeast dominates the nose, with some breadiness and spice. A hint of light fruit.  A sweet and spicy profile - malt and cloves with banana as well.  Refreshing, complex, and enjoyable. The hot weather made this even more enjoyable.",Bayerische Staatsbrauerei Weihenstephan,Germany,Hefeweizen,98
252,731,pwsoldier,4.34,"A - Pours a cloudy copper with a large off-white head that slowly dissipates into a thin layer of foam. No lacing is left on the glass.  S - Lots of spice with plenty of fruit aromas in there as well. Clove, coriander, citrus, and banana are the dominant notes, with some subtle apple aromas coming through as well.  T - Lots of clove and coriander. The fruit sweetness is far more subdued on the palate than it was in the aroma, but it's still there in the background. The yeast sediment provides a great deal of earthy breadiness.  M - Medium-bodied with a clean finish. Carbonation is just about right.  D - One of the great hefes of the world. Immensely enjoyable and a terrific example of the style.

Aroma is rich with cornmeal, wheat bread, clove, banana and some floral notes.  Flavor opens with cornmeal and wheat. Clove dominates in the midpalate and the flavor finishes with clove, wheat and I almost want to say some cantaloupe.  The mouthfeel is nicely carbonated, but the body is a bit watery, in my opinion. Such a fully flavored beer could be supported by a bit more strength on the palate.",Bayerische Staatsbrauerei Weihenstephan,Germany,Hefeweizen,98

Bananas, cloves, biscuity malt, quite a bit of tartness.  M: Rather light-bodied with good carbonation. Refreshing.  D: I'd say this is the gold standard of wheat beers. Outstanding for summer or any other season. And in the morning, this is the next best thing to orange juice.

252,731,callmescraps,4.2,"Got this for the lady friend. Decided I had to review while I was at it.  Appearance - Very nice. A sort of hazy straw color with a nice full white head that slowly dissipates. Pretty much how a hefe is supposed to look.  Smell - A nice tart lemon with some real clove and spice as well. Lots of the yeast goodness, with almost a hint of funk.  Taste - The sweet/tart lemon at the front. Some nice mellow bread follows, with that spice goodness. Very light on the tongue, but some real complexity beneath it.  Mouthfeel - Nice and mellow. Very light but good carbonation and richness.  Drinkability - Absurd. Goes right down every time. Smooth as anything.  This is a really great, mellow, every day kind of beer. It's world famous for a reason. Lots of hefes really go overboard, but this one is restrained and all the better for it.",Bayerische Staatsbrauerei Weihenstephan,Germany,Hefeweizen,98

252,731,jeffthecheff,4.65,"Bought a six pack with a strange bottling code. 9049 apparently means January 29th 2009.  Poured this thing into the necessary weizen glass, with a swirl at the end to get all the yeast in there. A 3, 4, or perhaps a 5 finger rocky head raises up at first, fizzes down to about two fingers and then eventually one. Carbonation bubbles sprint up the middle of the tall glass. Yeast is visible. At first it looks like clouds floating downward in the glass, then it all diffuses to make a completely unclear, yellow-orange beer.  Aroma of clove like spice, banana, and bubblegum makes an appetizing beer. Taste is sweet, with less going on but it's just about perfect. Banana-bubblegum beer comes through. The mouthfeel is outstanding. It coats the mouth with a creamy, smooth sensation. A tingly, cold carbonation makes this finish amazing.  This beer sets the standard for drinkability. A lot of times I don't put much thought or have much to say about drinkability, but this beer makes me realize how important it can be. This beer is very easy to drink. They say beer is an acquired taste but I swear if you gave this to my high school self who had never had beer before, I'd be able to put back as many as you put in front of me. This beer can match up with a ton of foods and be enjoyed in many different situations. Drink with Banana bread for breakfast, a long day chilling by the pool, A dinner beer or to party the night away. This would fit it all.",Bayerische Staatsbrauerei Weihenstephan,Germany,Hefeweizen,98
252,731,MetalHopHead6,4.29,"22oz bottle poured into a shaped pint glass.  Weihenstephaner Hefeweissbier pours a cloudy golden orange, with a creamy thick head. Each sip leaves creamy sticky foam on the glass that is too thick to call ""lace."" It looks like the foam left behind by rolling surf at the beach.  The smell is nice but too subtle to excite. On the other hand, there is nothing subtle about the taste--banana and clove explode in the mouth, along with a tart, slightly bitter aftertaste. This Hef tickles and awakens the palate.  The only problem is that Weihenstephaner Hefeweissbier begs to be both savored and guzzled. Finding a compromise between having your cake (Hef) and eating (drinking) it too, is a thoroughly enjoyable conundrum caused by this wonderful beer.",Bayerische Staatsbrauerei Weihenstephan,Germany,Hefeweizen,98

Decent amount of carbonation in this one, as bubbles are streaming up from the bottom of the glass.  S: Fairly light aroma, yeasty breadiness with sharp wheat notes and sweet banana and melon scents.  T: Damn fine example of the style. Wheaty, yeasty, sweet and then tart in the finish.

Slightly hazy. Huge amount of bubbles rising from the bottom of the glass. Great head retention with some lacing, but not much.  Smell is very yeasty with a lot of wheat malt. I'm getting some aromas of phenolic cloves as well. Not too much in the way of fruitiness or floral character. Pleasant, nonetheless.  Taste is great. Like the nose, the flavors are yeasty with a wheat bite. Definitely tasting the typical cloves with some ripe banana. A bit of tart apple, likely due to the wheat malt. Very yeasty on the finish. Not much of an aftertaste, maybe a little tart. Drying on the finish.  Mouthfeel is good and crisp. Light to medium bodied. A bit dry. Very refreshing.  A very good hefeweizen.

Aroma is a luscious bouquet of soft banana, tempting yeast, hints of citrus, and bread, with a sweet backbone that sets my taste buds into action.  What a flavor! Full of a marvelous yeast deliciousness that is balanced perfectly atop banana, peach, gentle spice, and soft malty goodness. I gave it a soft pour into my Kapuziner glass so as to avoid sediment, now I have added the sediment, and it tastes even better. Absolutely wonderful taste! Words do this no justice. The finish is long, just sweet enough, just fruity enough, with none of the sourness I remember in others of this style.  Mouthfeel is amazing. What can I say? It is clingy but not cloying, fizzy but not acidically so, and just rich enough. The work of masters for sure.  Drinkability?

Head is amazing, a conservative pour produced a three inch head. Retention is more than impressive, and lacing is spectacular. Lots of suspended sediment, some dark like pepper flakes.  The nose is very heavy on spices and yeast, as well as malted wheat. I also get a citrus note, maybe lemon. Ah, the nose on this one makes me anxious to take a sip!  Ah, there is no doubt why this is considered not only one of the best Hefeweizen's in the world, but one of the best brews period. Spicey yeast and cloves are very apparent. Very fruity and slightly dry. Lots of fruity esters at play here. Superb.  Mouthfeel is light to medium. Ample carbonation. Extremely drinkable.

The head formed a solid paper white pillow of foam and left huge chunks of lace.  Aroma is of lemon peel, bananas, coriander, biscuity yeast, and a dash of white pepper. Very clean aroma overall.  Doughy, undercooked buscuity yeast base with banana, clove, lemon peel and a light spice. Solid on all fronts. It doesn't wow me, but it definitely hits all aspects of a hefe and does it well.  Medium bodied with a big creamy mouthfeel. Very smooth and quaffable. I could drink this all day. Extremely clean with no off flavors or aromas. Near perfect.",Bayerische Staatsbrauerei Weihenstephan,Germany,Hefeweizen,98
252,731,smanders,4.5,"Appearance - cloudy, straw-colored with billowy head. Great lacing.  Smell - clove, banana, yeast.  Mouthfeel - viscous = goes down way too easily.  Taste - Bananas with a spicy, and yet sweet, finish.  Drinkability - Another great example of a traditional German hefeweizen. To be enjoyed throughout the year (but especially in the summers) amongst friends and family. Delicious!",Bayerische Staatsbrauerei Weihenstephan,Germany,Hefeweizen,98
252,731,jakeblues,4.85,"I was in the mood for a wheat beer. This fit the bill quite nicely. It doesn't have as much of the clove flavor as a hefeweizen usually does, but that's perfect to me. It's refreshing, tasty, and an excellent example of style. I enjoyed it a great deal, and I will purchase it again.",Bayerische Staatsbrauerei Weihenstephan,Germany,Hefeweizen,98
252,731,CrazyDavros,3.85,"Rich hazy orange/straw pour with the expected towering head. Aroma is mostly wheaty bread, then some banana and spicy cloves with a final hint of citrus. Personally I was expecting more from what I had heard about this beer. Wheat also dominates taste, but unfortunately not all that much of the banana and clove transfers through. Great mouthfeel, perhaps a bit too watery, but spot on carbonation. Very refreshing but it'd be good if it had a more banana/clove/bubblegum notes.",Bayerische Staatsbrauerei Weihenstephan,Germany,Hefeweizen,98
252,731,ritzkiss,4.66,"550 ml is the last bottle from my first trade with Bobsy - thanks again for the great trade!  Pours a cloudy straw color with agressive carbonation - a good four finger of dense, foamy head. I can honestly say the bubbles are RUSHING to get to the top - exploding. Keeps a thick layer of head for some time. Simply spectacular.  Smell is a nice mix of fresh summer grains, fruity esters, and citrus zest. Hints of hay and strawberries.  Taste is so smooth and delightful. A rush of wheat with just enough citrus zip to add but not dominate, enough yeast to flavor but not dominate, hints of flowers - simply delightful. The carbonation is lively but not too much so (thinking Duvel) - actually quite a smooth drinking experience but with a bit of bubbles. Round and yet refreshing.  This, for me, has got to be wheat beer to beat. Nearly perfect on all counts. As the bottle wanes a slight hint of a too thin body but all in all, the perfect summer evening beer to suit the taste buds without weighing you down. Thanks Rob.",Bayerische Staatsbrauerei Weihenstephan,Germany,Hefeweizen,98
252,731,webmanspidey,4.78,"Dark orange color overloaded with head. Smell is orange, lemon, and spicy. A nice mix of spices, peppers, and citrus in the flavor.. very smooth and refreshing.

Drinkability is at a max here.",Bayerische Staatsbrauerei Weihenstephan,Germany,Hefeweizen,98

T: Some spiciness to balance out the sweet malt background. The spiciness seems to come from a bit of clove, and then there is some definite banana with hints of vanilla.  M: Medium body with a good amount of carbonation.  D: This is the definition of the perfect summer sessionable beer. Great thing to always have around during the warmer months.",Bayerische Staatsbrauerei Weihenstephan,Germany,Hefeweizen,98
252,731,photomike,4.72,"Pours a beautiful white gold color with a towering white 2.5 finger head. Nice long retention and traces of spotty lacing here and there.  Smell is perfect for the style. Wheaty, malty, every so slightly tangeriney and lemony. I faintly detect clove.  Taste is similarly perfect for the style. Wheaty and yeasty with tangerine, lemon and clove. I often find it hard to review good hefeweizens because I feel as though they usually have similar elements comprising their overall flavor profile, though in different proportions from beer to beer, if that makes sense. This is the benchmark in my book. A perfect balance of hefeweissbier goodness, with no unexpected nasty surprises that you might find in a poor example of the style.  At least in the bottle, I feel like this beer is usually overcarbonated. Strong effervescence to a degree that it is distracting. This definitely adds to the crispness, though, and I could see myself appreciating it more in the hot weather, outside. As it stands, though, it takes away from my overall appreciation of the flavor intricacies of the brew.  Very drinkable. Heavier than a super-sessionable lager, but I could probably sip on this forever.  Definitely my favorite hefeweissbier, and at 6 bucks a liter, a staple in my fridge. A couple times a month I get a mean craving for this beer; it is definitely one of my all time favorites.",Bayerische Staatsbrauerei Weihenstephan,Germany,Hefeweizen,98

Mouthfeel was a low point for me. Not crisp at all. Very watered down and slick. I was disappointed with this characteristic, though it created an easy quaffing environment.

Fruity, but oh so good, and tinged with a peppery spiciness that makes this a joy to smell.  Spiced citrus flavors dominate the palate. They give way to an equal helping of wheat and banana, that goes down ever-so-smooth. A slight banana peel-like astringency is joined by a lingering spiciness. The carbonation is perfect; it coats the mouth gently.  I hesitate to rate this so highly given I'm not familiar with the style, but I can't think of much I'd want to change.",Bayerische Staatsbrauerei Weihenstephan,Germany,Hefeweizen,98

252,731,Buschyfor3,4.78,"20oz on tap at Rich O's Public House in New Albany.  A: Just as sexy as before, a deep, hazy golden body with a super large, creamy white head.  S: On tap, the fruity, banana aroma is intensified, so much so that you can catch a whiff of bananas from across the table. Oh man this hefe is fresh and it smells awesome! I can still pick out the spicy notes from cloves and citrus rinds underneat the banana, and there is also a yeasty, bready aroma that begins to peak through the sweetness.  T: Huge, fruity sweetness up front (again bananas, oranges, lemons). My friend who tasted this on tap swore that he was tasting a hint of orange juice. This sweetness is followed by a mellowing spiciness from the cloves. Then the malts and bready notes kick in and round out the finish.  M: The carbonation off the tap is solid, creating a crisp, effervescent mouthfeel that goes down with velvety smoothness.  D: This beer is heavenly. A pleasing and complex balance of fruit, spice and wheat flavors married to a low ABV make this weizen an absolute treat to enjoy. The ideal summer beer - and really, a supremely drinkable beer for any occasion.  Hands down, this is my favorite German beer. From a bottle - as it is relatively easy to find around here - it is fantastic hefeweizen. But when you can find it on tap - oh! Absolutely sublime, on an entirely other level. Weihenstephaner is often bragged about as the pinnacle of German weizens - one taste will tell you why. Highly recommended.",Bayerische Staatsbrauerei Weihenstephan,Germany,Hefeweizen,98

S: Spices of mostly clove. Heavy wheat that already makes my mouth water. Citrus zest cuts through, but the spice is really dominating the nose. T/M: Banana, spices (again, the cloves), and wheat flavors. Mouthfeel is light, and not as crisp as I want from a hefeweizen (despite my decent pour). Bitter hops are present to balance, and the sip ends dryly. D: Not my favorite Hefe in the world, but not bad either.

A: Poured a vibrant golden yellow color with turned cloudy and yellow-orange when the bottle yeast was swirled and added. A nice, white two-finger head of sticky, pillowy foam formed and a left beautiful lace.  S: Smells faintly sweet and citrusy, with hints of lemon peel, coriander, and fruity esters. There's also a mellow, herbal yeasty twang added to the wheat bread smell. Bits of spices make themselves known in the way of clove, white pepper and mint.  T: The taste is spot on German Hefeweizen. A great, smooth semisweet and dry malty mouthful of lightly toasted malts and citrus flavors. A bit of that classic banana, mint and clove flavor make their way through the orange peel and citrus taste. Bitterness is low, yet herbal hops make themselves known. The finish is sweet and dry, with a lingering spicy malt flavor and a wheaty yeast tang.  M: Mouthfeel is smooth, crisp and refreshing. Yeast adds just a hint of chewiness to the body.  D: An all day every day weissbier. This is the benchmark for the style, as far as I'm concerned. Easily sessionable, a must have on a warm day outdoors, and it paired really nicely with my creole shrimp simmer as well.

252,731,johnmichael712,4.45,"Appearance: Poured out of a 16 oz bottle into a Paulaner weizen glass. There is no freshness date on the bottle, but there is a batch code (4398). This beer pours an orangy-gold color that is exceptionally murky once the yeast sediment is added and is crowned by the typical enormous weizen head. The head is a pale white color and has a wonderful mousse-like texture that is supplemented by a torrent of small carbonation bubbles rising from the bottom of the glass. As the head falls it takes on a rocky appearance, and it eventually fades to a one finger ring that stays atop the beer throughout the drinking experience. A moderate amount of Belgian lace is present on the sides of glass.  Smell: The nose of this beer is exceptionally spicy and has a strong amount of phenol aroma in the form of cloves. There is also a heavy does of banana esters along with a citrusy tartness that smells like lemon zest or bitter orange peel.  Taste: This beer starts out with a strong banana flavor that would make it perfect for anyone with a pet monkey. This moves to a sharp clove spiciness and big notes of malted barley and wheat along with a bread-like yeast flavor. The beer eventually fades with a bit of a cracker-like malt flavor along with a very light and sweet bubblegum taste that supplements the dry finish. There is no hop flavor to speak of and no real hop bitterness in the finish. This is one excellently balanced, yet flavorful, hefeweizen.  Mouthfeel: Medium bodied, especially for a hefeweizen, and is one of the biggest bodies in a wheat beer I've had to date. Once the yeast is added to the glass the body seems even bigger, so make sure to swirl around the last few drops in the bottle and add them to the beer. This beer has a creamy sort of mouthfeel thanks to the wheat, and a light finish with heavy carbonation.  Drinkability: I think that hefeweizens are one of the most drinkable styles out there, and Weihenstephaner's Hefeweissbier is no exception. This is an incredibly spicy, fruity, and refreshing beer, and goes wonderfully with warm weather and good friends.  Notes: This is the best hefeweizen that I've had so far. Other breweries' renditions are good, but if you're a wheat beer lover and you haven't treated yourself to Weihenstephaner's version, you owe it to yourself to try this gem from the ""oldest brewery in the world"". Definitely something I'll be buying again as summer approaches, and a great beer for opening people up to the world of craft beer.",Bayerische Staatsbrauerei Weihenstephan,Germany,Hefeweizen,98

As it gets warmer some fruitiness takes center stage along with yeast and wheat. Tastes like I'm eating from a bowl of mixed fruit while chewing a piece of Bubbalicious. Quite tasty!  M--Pretty much perfect, this just glides down your throat with an ever-so-slight sting from the carbonation  D--Hey, if I can drink an entire wheat beer without complaints, it must be drinkable",Bayerische Staatsbrauerei Weihenstephan,Germany,Hefeweizen,98
252,731,Wackyfoot,4.42,Murky golden pour with a thick white head that evaporates very slowly. Bubblegum aroma with some nice banana scent as well. Flavor similar but a little bit more banana than bubblegum maybe with a nice carbonated kick to it. Probably the best hefe I have ever drank,Bayerische Staatsbrauerei Weihenstephan,Germany,Hefeweizen,98
252,731,sevopie,4.61,"Appearance - Lightly cloudy golden color with a white head.  Smell - A lot of spices are apparent upfront, as well as a couple fruits, pears/apricots as well as some type of citrus.  Taste - The fruits dominate the initial flavors, again with pears and citrus coming through. You get a mild hint of wheat in there, but the spices kick in long after the fruits, and linger nicely on the tongue.  Mouthfeel - Heavy but not oily, with a solid dose of carbonation.  Drinkability - With the spices lingering on the tongue, this one asks you to drink more with every sip. This is quite possibly the most drinkable beer I've ever had... and I am not really a fan of the wheat style in general. Fantastically well done, I'm glad I was able to find it here in Denver finally.",Bayerische Staatsbrauerei Weihenstephan,Germany,Hefeweizen,98

252,731,PirateUlf73,4.92,"Poured into a tulip glass.  A: Pours a quite hazy golden-orange hue with a big, white head. Retained and laced marvelously.  S: Very strong nose of wheat, spices, clove, banana, and some yeast. All of these add up to more than the sum of its parts. Very complex and a joy to smell.  T: A big, soft spiciness up front, supported by a supple wheat backing. Then comes the bready yeast, adding its own signature to the mix. I love the blend of all the classic hefeweizen flavors - banana, clove and phenols. This has it all in spades.  M: A pleasant fullness, yet still managing to be lighter in body. It was adequately carbonated and the finish was a little tart and more than a little bit dry.  D: Very quaffable, as each sip leaves you yearning for the next.  This is hands-down one of the most complex hefeweizens (let alone beers in general) on the market today. If for some strange reason you have not already tried this beer, get off your bottom and go getcha' some!

The smell is made up of apple, wheat, pears, cloves, and vanilla; very enticing. The taste is somewhat muted, but lemon esters, pears, cloves, vanilla, and some earthiness shine through. The earthy quality reminds me of a saison. Mouthfeel is very carbonated & acidic at first, but quickly becomes smooth & almost thick.  This is an incredibly drinkable hefeweizen.

Nose is a subtle mix of citrus especially lemons, and maybe a slight hint of bananas. Nothing too overpowering.  Wow, a very impressive hefeweiss! Much fruiter than I would typically expect, even more so than the nose. Strong notes of banana and wheat.  Mouthfeel seems to be on par with the style. Crisp, light, and quite drinkable, although I'm not sure I see myself drinking this all the time.

Nice yeast flavor followed by clove and banana.  M-Refreshing and perfectly crisp.  D-A great beer that goes down easy and perfect to have over the course of a session.

S - MMM, the wonderful smell of yeast, bread, cloves and banana tones.  T - Slight citrus zest, yeast, kick of spice, banana, wonderful hefeweizen...clearly best in class.  M - Crisp feel smacks on your tongue, but this beer is also thick and viscous in some ways. The spice hits you mid swallow and the zest spikes around the rest of your mouth.  D - Very drinkable hefe.

If poured correctly this beer forms a perfect head with the best retention and lacing in all hefe's ive ever had.  Aroma - beautiful citrus aroma with hints of honey and lemon zest, no hoppiness here though, but for this beer it is perfect.  Taste - full taste of citrus, lemon zest, honey and nutmeg  Feels so beautiful to the palate. This beer excites so many tastes buds my mouth feels almost euphoric. This is by far the best hefe I have ever tasted.

Head has great retention and leaves a tremendous amount of lacing.  S- Smells very yeasty with hints of citrus and banana esters. Minimal hop character if at all. Smells crisp, clean and very Earthly.  T- Crisp light malt flavors back up banana flavors. The lemon comes through slightly near the end of the sip. Light banana flavors stick around and make everything so much better.  M- A light body and solid carbonation make this very smooth and crisp.  D- Easy and great to drink.

It starts to collapse and leaves a little pillow on top of the beer leaving a nice bit of sticky lacing down the glass. Looks beautiful, with all kinds of bubbles rushing through the glass all throughout. The smell is nice. At first, with the rising CO2, it burn the nose just a bit, but there is a wonderful spiciness like cloves and black pepper, with just a note of banana. There also quite a bready sweetness in the nose underneath the yeast presence. The flavor starts out bready, very bready, with a light, powdery sweetness. There's a sticky, thick presence of sweet wheat, which is nice. It moves to the clove note, the light banana, and finishes with a big peppery, spicy finish. The mouthfeel is very full, chewy from the high amount of wheat and the yeast. The carbonation stings initially and the peppery finish is a bit too strong. The drinkability is great. Really enjoyable and easy to drink. This one is very good, but I'm not sure that it is actually my favorite among the style. Worth seeking out for the Hefe lover, but maybe not the best introduction because its not as clean and easy as some.",Bayerische Staatsbrauerei Weihenstephan,Germany,Hefeweizen,98

Little bit of banana, more cloves, wheat bread, and a little yeast.  M - Almost a medium body, but just a little lighter. Great mouthfeel, good going down.  D - Great session beer. So easy to drink. Love this beer.  Overall - The quintessential German Hefeweizen. Great beer, love to drink this beer, but not my favorite in this style, that goes to Southern Tiers Heavy Weizen, but still a great beer.",Bayerische Staatsbrauerei Weihenstephan,Germany,Hefeweizen,98

A great beer and spot on what this beer should taste like, just a virtually perfect example.  M - Light to medium body. Medium carbonation. Unlike some German weissbiers this one has something to it and it feels like a beer. Very nice.  D - Very drinkable. This is one easy drinking beer, I can see it being perfect on a warm summer's day. Quite sessionable too at just over 5% ABV.  Overall - A great beer. probably the best in its class and a wonderful summer beer (though I like it at other times too).

Big bannana and spicy clove in the aroma that follow into the taste. Fruity esters everywhere. Cracker-like malt backbone. Be sure to give it a swirl before pouring the last 1/4 of the bottle.

S: Classic hefe smell easily distinguishable despite not being able to pour this one into a glass. Banana. Clove. Wheaty.  T/M: I see why this rather regular beer is in the top 40. This is the best hefeweizen I've had. Exceptionally well balanced. Clean, crisp and refreshing.  D: The definition of drinkable. Went down especially smooth after a long day in the snow.

The carbonation is readily visible.  The smell is quite good and includes notes of banana, yeast, and bread. There is also a sweetness to the smell, which is quite pleasant and goes beyond the banana (perhaps honey/wheat), as well as cloves.  The taste includes the yeasty bread combination. I also note some apple and banana components. I also note cloves which is quite nice. A mild spiciness lingers.  This is a fairly light bodied beer to me. It is full of flavor and the carbonation highlights it quite nicely. It is crisp on the tongue and leaves a mild residual dryness.  Overall, this is a fairly drinkable beer.

252,731,bobsy,4.65,"We did a blind tasting of hefeweizens by Schneider, Weihenstephaner, Paulaner and Hacker-Pschorr. Weihenstephaner was a clear winner, while the Hacker-Pschorr was the most disappointing of the bunch.  Murky gold body in need of a good polish, with a creamy and abundant white head. Rings of lace are left on the weizen glass as the head descends. A classic, textbook hefe appearance that can't be faulted. Strong banana notes in the aroma, backed up by a healthy dose of wheat, but lacking the complexity of Denison's weisse.  Great flavour, but again a slight step down from the Denison's, which is still the best hefe I've tried. As expected, the banana and grain of the aroma is followed through in bushels. Slight clove taste at the back of the palate, but not as much spice as I was expecting. Very slight citric bitterness. Nice, crisp refreshing mouthfeel, with moderate carbonation. High drinkability for this perfect summer beer.  A top notch hefe, and well-deserving of its reputation as one of the world's best.",Bayerische Staatsbrauerei Weihenstephan,Germany,Hefeweizen,98

The head is crisp white, like linen. And a few little chunkies can be seen floatin' around in there.  S - Banana orange juice with an English muffin. This is yeasty, but not over the top, and there are some very focused citrus top notes over gentler sweet banana. Nice.  T - This is everything a hefe should be. The archetype if you will. The citrus is the major player, but other flavors such as banana, yeasty doughnut, and a very gentle hint of clove are found here.  M - Just over the line between light and medium bodied, this is sweetish at first, before building up a gradual citrus tartness. Extremely refreshing and thirst quenching.  D - This is a perfect warm weather springtime beer. Refeshing, thirst quenching, and easy to down quickly (too quickly).

Leaves intermittent patches of lace.  S: Banana-bread is what I almost immediately smelled. After that, cloves, pepper and lemon entered the fray.  T: Definitely what a I thought a benchmark Hefe should taste like. The banana-bread theme continues in the initial sweetness. A sharp clove and pepper bitterness follows. Finishes bready and dry.  M: Medium light body is chewy and bread like. Carbonation level is right where is should be.  D: A very nice beer. I can understand why it rates so highly.

Any lacing that remains is short-lived. A full return of head is accomplished with gentle agitation.  The nose is yeasty with hints of citrus and banana esters. Minimal hop character. Smells crisp and clean.  This beer is fantastic. While calling Weihenstephaner 'complex' might be a stretch, there is a depth here that I've found lacking in so many other wheat beers. Spices, vanilla, banana and clove esters, the crisp malt backbone of a well-made pils... this beer combines them all into perhaps the most drinkable example of the style I've ever tasted.  This is a medium-bodied beer with a relatively high amount of carbonation. Alcohol burn is almost nonexistent, and the finish and clean and crisp.  What an awesome beer.

Will it live up to the hype?  Certainly has the 'hefe' look down pat. Hazy/cloudy aprocot/orange in color although a bit paler than say HP's . Head seemed fuller and more robust than any hefe I have sampled so far.  Aroma is quite on par. Certainly no over-powering smells of banana or spice although they are present. If anything perhaps a bit more malt is noticeable. The word that comes to my mind immediately is balance.  Which is what immediately comes to mind in the taste. All the classic flavors and experieince are here, just in near perfect balance. The wheat crispness, smooth malt, etc. I noticed a bit more hoppiness, but in, again, a very balanced way.  If balance is one area this beer scores higher than most then mouthfeel sets it apart. Smooth like velvet from start to finish. Carbonation is bang on.

Fresh citrus taste on the tongue, followed by spice and a very light and clean after taste. This beer immediately reminds me of summer. A very fresh and quenching flavor, without any residue left after swallow.  D: This beer is one of the most drinkable beers I have had.

A--Pours up a tawny yellow verging on an orange haze, with a billowy pillowy three fingers of microbubbled white foam. Head retention is unmatched and there are curtains all down the glass. Absolutely awesome looking hefe.  S--Thick banana esters, almost bready smelling somehow, with an undertone in the nose of lemon zest. Just enough of a citric tang to cut that thick banana along with the butter hints of diacetyl that linger toward the end of the sniff.  T--Banana temporarily disappears up front to blast the clove medicinals. Once that wave passes this sucker reveals a powerful tangy wheat and juicy barley kick in the middle, followed closely by more banana. Finish is mellow, smooth, and surprisingly lasting for the style. Pretty complex for the style, though without much tang on the flavor profile.  M&D--Mouthfeel's a tad too spritzy for me. I like the champagne feel, but it seeps over into bitingly. Maybe that's me. Anyway, I'd drink a hundred of these in a summer gladly.

It goes down so smooth. Truly an excellent hefeweizen.",Bayerische Staatsbrauerei Weihenstephan,Germany,Hefeweizen,98
252,731,JonMich13,4.57,Poured a beautiful yellow gold into the snifter glass. Not much head and what was there didn't last long. Minimal lacing. Smelled of wheat and spiciness followed strongly by citrus and banana. Mouth is crisp and clean with ample carbonation. Very balanced. Taste of wheat and pepper hit early with mellow sweet banana/lemon bringing up the rear - this beer finishes brilliantly. Definitely an easy drinker.,Bayerische Staatsbrauerei Weihenstephan,Germany,Hefeweizen,98

252,731,dannon71,4.18,"This is a beautiful beer when first poured. It pours a golden copper with an orange hint. The head is thick and white with great lacing. I would have given this beer a 5 on appearance except the head deminished rather quickly and maintained at about a quarter inch thereafter.  First smell hinted strongly of wheat with lemon and banana being evenly split in the background. Second and third smells picked up some vanilla and some more banana. The scent of banana tends to intensify even more after first tasting and becomes the dominate trait as you continue to drink.  Upon tasting, the first thing I noticed was the carbonation. It was followed by the taste of lemon and then grass which I believe is typical for this wheaty of a beer. The wheat quickly turns sweet on the tounge and the banana flavor begins to come through with a lasting sweetness that is very noticeable. The finish remains sweet with a return to some wheat remnants. I enjoyed this beer and find it to be one of the better Heffe styles out there. It was not my favorite but found it very easy to drink and thought it represented itself very well. I will have no problem enjoying the rest of my six pack!",Bayerische Staatsbrauerei Weihenstephan,Germany,Hefeweizen,98

The beer is lightly hazed gold color with thin streams of bubbles coming up from the bottom.  S- Lots of citrus and spice. Oranges come to mind along with lemon peal. Also some light pepperyness and herbal spice. Lots of earthy notes, big yeast presence. Some good sweetness is also present but the nose is really dominated by herbal spice and citrus.  T- Mild earthy flavors, some herbal spice and wheat flavors. There are some hops in there but not to much to cover up the subtle flavors in this beer. Some sweetness, like white bread and then some citrus in the end. There is a lot going on but I have a little trouble trying to describe every flavor.  M- Light crisp and refreshing. Good balance and perfect carbonation. What I would expect from a good Hefeweizen.  Overall- This is a great summer beer, that I am very much enjoying in a Minnesota winter. Great subtle complexity and very refreshing. I really enjoy this beer.",Bayerische Staatsbrauerei Weihenstephan,Germany,Hefeweizen,98

With that being said...Had this one on tap at the Brick Store pub in ATL and enjoying another from the bottle as I type. I must say that this is one of may favorite Hefe beers. It truly reminds me of the wheat beers I was drinking of in Europe a few summers ago.  Appearance - Cloudy yellow/orange with a nice continuous flow of bubbles. Forms a nice white head on top that is semi consistent throughout.  Smell - Like Heaven. Very fruity, wheaty and what I think reminds me of banana runts. It makes me want to swim in it.  Taste - Very crisp and refreshing. I would almost prefer this beer over a glass of water after a long workout.  Mouthfeel - Very good. Doesn't overwhelm the mouth but has a very enjoying and slightly bubbly feel.  Drinkability - I don't want to stop.",Bayerische Staatsbrauerei Weihenstephan,Germany,Hefeweizen,98

You get some of the aforementioned lemon with biscuit and finishes with some spice I am having a hard time placing.  Mouthfeel is light with a nice slug of carbonation which works well in this beer.  This goes down verrry nicely. I could see going through a number of these, especially on a hot day (which unfortunately, it is not).  In short, the best wheat beer I have ever had While I haven't had many of the German Hefes I have had a number of American wheats and they don't come close.",Bayerische Staatsbrauerei Weihenstephan,Germany,Hefeweizen,98

S- Smells of wheat, orange, banana, and a faint smell of big league chew bubble gum. Excellent smells to this brew.  T- Hits the spot with tastes very similar to the smell: excellent wheat taste followed by bananas, orange and then a slight taste of bubble gum.  M- fizzy, smooth, refreshing  D- This is the best hefeweizen that I have tried thus far. I have a feeling that it is going to be difficult to find one that I'll like any better then this one.

Dense head pops up to a couple of fingers depth, and then sinks down to a nice cap that lasts to the end. Minimal lacing.  S: Bright banana and spice. Possibly a bit peppery on the nose as well. Inviting.  T/M/D: This is an excellently balanced beer. It hits all around the mouth all at once, and strikes the sweet spot between creaminess and prickly carbonation. Snappy wheat malt, and a subtle lemony/hoppy tang as the beer goes down. Uber-good.",Bayerische Staatsbrauerei Weihenstephan,Germany,Hefeweizen,98
252,731,Riccymon,4.43,"Poured a clear, light orange into a hefeweizen glass with two fingers of fluffy white head, which is retained for some time. Smell is light and pleasant--yeast, banana, orange, and coriander. I get all of the above flavors as I sip, along with quite a bit of apple. Finish is lightly dry and spicy with that peppery coriander lingering, and the mouthfeel in general is pleasant and as expected for the style.

M:Perfect level of carbonation, very smooth.  D: Very VERY drinkable. perfect balance, great taste.  O: Has to be my favorite hefe to date.

Pours a super hazy and cloudy orangish gold, with a big, frothy white head that sits comfortably high above the rim of the glass. The aroma notes are not very different than Franziskaner, but lack Franz's overbearing cloves. But the cloves are still there, as are bananas, cream of wheat, and lots of yeastiness. Tons of flavors on the palate: flavors of all the aromas tied together in perfect harmony; lightly sweet from start to finish.

252,731,wheatyweiss,4.14,"Poured from a 16.9 oz bottle into a weiss glass.  Pours a light honey, tangerine color, with a typical towering weiss head that leaves a moderate web. Cloud is a bit light and I'm thinking the yeast may be light in this bottle.  Aroma is dusty citrus and crystal malt. Sweetness lies in the citrus aromas and clove aromas. Predominately lemon aromas upfront with sweetbread.  Taste is citrus and dusty yeast. Crystal malts meld with weiss yeasts to give a light bubblegum flavor with a citrus punch in the mouth. Hops are there, as light as they are, to give a little character. Flavor is a bit watery, like this one got mixed in a half glass of water.  Mouthfeel is creamy and smooth. Watery though and thin, little body.  Overall, I'm a little disappointed with this beer after hearing the hype on the forum. There is a lacking in yeast flavors and the banana and band-aids I'm accustomed to. The flavors get better as the beer warms well past cellar temp. To be fair I should mention there was crud on the threads when I de-capped this one. Could be old, but with no labeled date it's hard to tell  I'll have a Paulaner or Tuchers first thanks.

A - The pinnacle of the style: yellow/gold color, cloudy with a white two finger head that recedes to a light head that laces the glass as you drink.  S - Classic weizen: banana, clove, bready wheat malt aroma that beckons the first swallow.  T - Every complexity in the smell is rewarded in full on the palette. Banana bread with clove, esters, and yeast.  M - Light to medium. Unfiltered wheat yet surprisingly light for the appearance.  D - In a word: dangerous.

Also, there is some clove and banana and some citrus notes as well.  Interesting as the taste differs from what the smells would indicate. Upfront there is the wheat, grainy flavor, which is followed by some bold citrus flavors before a very crisp, dry finish.  This really is a fantastic beer, one that lives up to its hype. Great smell and flavor, nice carbonation. My one knock is that I would prefer it to be a bit thicker - it is very light. Easy to throw a number of these back.

Overall, this is a beautiful and refreshing looking beer.  The aroma of the yeast is what first gets my attention. This is closely followed by banana and spices. This smell is complex in that it is more subdued than other hefeweizens but I can detect the individual flavors much better. I can also find wheat and some additional citrus nodes in the background. Overall, the aroma is perfect.  When I finally take a drink, I am blessed with some wonderful wheat flavors up front. This is then followed by citrus flavors of lemon and orange and toasted malt that tastes like freshly baked bread. There is a slight amount of bitterness in the end and it finished relatively dry.

Overall: I don't give many 5's for drinkability. This is a fantastic Hefeweizen, I could drink a gallon of it and not get tired of it.

S - a very fragrant beer, even when very cold. it is wheaty but at the same time sweet smelling, a sweetness that is akin to oranges, but without any of the bitterness or acidity, so more like juice. there are some malts as well to be notes, but they tie in with the sweetness.  T - the first thing I notice is that there is a great spiciness that hits the top back of the palate as one swallows, amazing! I shall align this taste with cloves, and thank Jason for pinpointing this taste. wheat and a slightly sweet zest are predominant in the finish, after the curtain of carbonation gives way; while the after taste gives way to a slight hint of alcohol and back to the clove essence. there is a slight underlying sweetness from the malts, I suspect, through out the flavour; though subdued in some parts of drinking it is almost always there to some degree.  MF&D - a hightly carbonated brew, this sometimes makes one wait to experience the flavours it has to offer, though not a great detriment to the beer it is something to consider. the consistency is great, and really allows one to freely examine the texture and flavours the beer has to offer.  I originally had this on tap in huge weizen glasses when I was much younger at a bar in NYC, and remember it being far too sweet for my taste.

The nose is slightly of banana and clove, a nice warm bready scent in the background somewhere. Perhaps a little bubblegum? The notes really come alive as the beer warms (I served a little too cold).  Spicy and well balanced to taste. Only a little real hint of banana in this, cloves and other spices are at the forefront of this one. A little bit of breadiness as well.  The mouthfeel of this is a little on the watery side, like most hefe's I've tried.

I hate to be so cliche hefeweizen, but it was true. This beer was a bit to spicy for my taste, but it seems pretty true to form.  Bright, edgy mouthfeel. The carbonation was a bit overbearing.  The edginess of the mouthfeel and spice was the only thing that was difficult for drinkability, but overall, good.",Bayerische Staatsbrauerei Weihenstephan,Germany,Hefeweizen,98

M: Super clean, and smooth. Spicyness stays until the next sip, but, while drinking this, it is normally not too long between sips!  D: Fantastic. Just as good during a clold winter night, as it is during a hot summer day.  This is the world's standard, for Hefe's. Hands down.",Bayerische Staatsbrauerei Weihenstephan,Germany,Hefeweizen,98

252,731,popery,4.8,"An exceptional hefeweizen. This beer is the gold standard for the style. It is well ahead of the competition in a very competitive German style with many great beers that probably date back for hundreds of years. The beer looks great. It's glowing, dusky, cloudy gold with a fine, soapy, craggy head. Lacing is in abundance. The smell is clean wheat spice, lots of fruity esters and sweet malt. The flavor is like drinking a bit of summer. You can taste the sunshine on the wheat fields when you take a sip of this beer. There's a ton of wheat spice and everything comes through crisply and cleanly but never bitingly. It is refreshing and cooling but also lush and full. The feel is velvety with lots of gentle suds. It is one of the best beers in the world and possibly the best beer in the world that could be considered a session beer, properly.",Bayerische Staatsbrauerei Weihenstephan,Germany,Hefeweizen,98

Taste Very mild with hints of citrus and clove coming out. Slight slight biterness. I would say a somewhat sweet fruity taste is a good general description of the taste. A couple of days ago I had the La Fin Du Monde Tripel and I find some similiarties between that beer and this beer. I love both of these beers.

Smooth with great spiciness that lingers from start to finish of bananas, cloves and a light citrus hopping.  M: creamy, with a moderate carbonation and finished dry.  D: Great drinkability per style, refreshing, and one that's hard to put down inbetween sips. Must try.",Bayerische Staatsbrauerei Weihenstephan,Germany,Hefeweizen,98

Delicious yeastiness, with sweet grain, a little alcohol warmth, and tart lemon essence. Absolutely fabulous balance, and you know you are drinking beer and not a glass of fruit candy.  Carbonation dances on your tongue and cleans the palate. Finishes on a tart note, and with a bit of an astringent pucker.  Overall, you could knock these back all day long.

Bready yeast, fresh citrus fruit, lemons, fresh-cut grass... a veritable springtime field of flowers.  Taste: Wow, that's fresh. Bread, fruit, flowers... pretty much the smell sums up the taste. Carbonation that tingles the tongue. Slight alcohol finish.  Overall: This is one excellent Hefeweizen.

The head sticks around for a while before settling into a thin pancake of bubbles on top of the beer. Nice lacing down the glass.  Smells of bananas with slight lemon zest. Not a whole lot going on here, but it's done well.  Tastes great. Crisp light malt flavors back up banana flavors. The lemon comes through slightly near the end of the sip. Light banana flavors stick around, goading me into taking another sip.  Mouthfeel is good. A light body and solid carbonation make this very smooth and crisp.  Drinkability is great. This really is one of the easiest-drinking beers I've had, even in the month of December. Put a bunch of this in front of me in summer and it'll be gone even faster.

Very nice aroma of banana and spices which beckons you to put your lips to the glass.  So, I put my lips to the glass and am rewarded with the pleasing taste of spices (is that cinnamon?) along with some banana. Very nicely balanced, and with no sign of alcohol present.  Mouthfeel on this beer is about as good as it gets. Medium bodied, with an excellent smoothness which is combined with the perfect amount of carbonation.  This is a very drinkable beer, one which is fairly easy to find, is reasonably priced, tastes great and once you finish one begs you to have another. Hard to beat that combination.",Bayerische Staatsbrauerei Weihenstephan,Germany,Hefeweizen,98

S: Light citrus and a bit of a yeast-heavy musty touch at the end. Very sweet but overall surprisingly muted nose.  T: Great light yeast flavor and a citrus front, but it's all banana towards the end. I've shied away from hefe's lately but this one may just bring me back - nothing bland about it, but very straightforward in a traditional Bavarian brew way.  M: Nice and light, no bitterness or 'deadness,' something I've found with the hefe's I've had lately. A bit of a banana/citrus aftertaste but it's very pleasant.  D: Could definitely have a few of these. Reasonable alcohol content and smooth character makes it a great session beer.  Bottom line - I'm an IPA guy, but this is a fantastic brew.

Super-hazy copper with a white head that quickly settles into a ring of foam. Lacing is spotty.  Smells of lovely wild Bavarian yeast. The usual tasty aroma of cloves and nanners.  Flavor comes right back into familiar (but great) territory. Spicy, fruity and all that good stuff. So delicious.  Mouthfeel is the one are where I feel this has an advantage over Paulaner. It's just slightly creamier. If it wasn't for that, I probably couldn't tell the two beers apart.  Bow down to the king, bitches. While I can't just grab a sixer of this at work as I can with Paulaner, I fully intend to add this sucker to the rotation. World class weizen, for sure.",Bayerische Staatsbrauerei Weihenstephan,Germany,Hefeweizen,98

252,731,ecoastman,4.48,"Please don't drink this beer. I already have a hard time obtaining it in my region.  Appearance - beautiful golden haze in the weizen glass is warming to the eye. The initial head is exceptional as a fluffy, creamy cloud. The carbonation is balanced and the head retention is great as it clings from the top of the glass all the way to the finished bottom. I love the glass as it refreshes the head from mild aggitation with each mouthful.  Smell - sweet banana, clove and bubble gum. Mild yeasty bread-like aroma.  Taste - similar to the smell with greater detection of mild spices. The specific dominance is the bubble gum banana characteristic which fits the style well. Citrus tones are also noted.  Mouthfeel - medium weight with a dry finish. I'm wondering if the hefe leaves a slightly pasty feeling behind... The texture is thin and smooth with perfect carbonation.  Drinkability - this beer is definitely a session beer.  Poured from a 500 mL bottle",Bayerische Staatsbrauerei Weihenstephan,Germany,Hefeweizen,98
252,731,Jeffo,4.13,"Got this at Bert's Bier Huis in Utrecht  From a bottle into a Weizen glass  APPEARANCE: Deep yellow golden orange with a big fluffy white head. No carbonation evident. A thin film sticks around and lots of lacing lines the glass.  SMELL: Wheat malt dominates the nose. A good amount of clove and a hint of banana and lemon in the background. The malt is the strongest component, and the rest balance it out quite nicely.  TASTE: Wheat malt and slightly sweeter than average. Mostly malt qualities with a healthy dose of clove and some banana undertones as well. A slight bit of bread at the end. Definitely enjoyable.  PALATE: Medium thin body and slightly creamy on the palate. Goes down smooth and finishes slightly sticky. Carbonation is light but very appropriate for the style. No bite and feels right.  OVERALL: Feels and looks right, and has a nice malty taste profile as well. A very drinkable beer that could be drunk all night. This is actually on tap everywhere in Holland and it often turns into my session beer. I'm glad there's a top notch German weizen readily availible on tap here.",Bayerische Staatsbrauerei Weihenstephan,Germany,Hefeweizen,98

Not a lot of citrus. No banana that I can pick up on. Almost no bitterness from the hops. Very clean finish.  M- Carbonation is good. Leaves almost no coat, and fades out quickly.  D- With the spot-on carbonation and clean finish, as well as slightly milder flavors (for a weissbier), one could definitely drink a few of these.  Overall, this is not my favorite wheat beer. It just doesn't meet the expectation I have for wheat beers in the flavor category. But, it's definitely a good one; worth trying.",Bayerische Staatsbrauerei Weihenstephan,Germany,Hefeweizen,98

Tons of banana, orange and lemon scents. Yeast scents and some yeast spice (clove, pepper) come through as well.  T: Extremely crisp and clean with fresh light fruits. Tons of banana, orange and lemon that really blend well with the spice of the yeast. The yeast spice is not overpowering, but it has a nice pepper aspect that goes well with the rest of the beer.

The banana aftertaste is quite fantastic.  Mouthfeel: So light and thin on the palate, this beer goes down ever so smoothly.  Drinkability: This beer is so easy to drink.

No sediment on the initial pour, but its a pretty large bottle so there might still be some in there.  Smell: Bannana, yeast, and some excellent spices. Not too overpowering. A great supplement to the taste.  Taste: This is what a hefe should taste like! Delicious banana, citrus, yeast, cloves, and a slight hint of citrus. I love how the taste lingers in your mouth and invites you to drink more.  Mouthfeel: Medium body, Perfect carbonation and finishes super dry. Awesome.

Patches of fluffy lace ring the glass.  The scent is so strong I notice it from a foot away. Lemons, wheat, yeast, fresh dough, coriander, pepper.  Taste is sweet with lemons, green banana, softly sour yeast and wheat, fresh doughy bread. The sour lemon finish tickles the sides of the tongue a minute or two after the sip. Really a vivid sucking on a lemon sensation; nice! Mildly spicy with coriander, clove and black and white pepper. There's also a very soft nutty flavor buried in there.  Mouth is creamy but a tiny bit thinner than I would prefer.  Drinkability is excellent. The beer disappeared rapidly and left me wishing I had another bottle of it.

Taste: it has a melon and beany taste but unlike the smell there are some roasted malt tones.  Mouthfeel: Medium body with a lot of carbonation to the body.

252,731,joepais,4.63,"Bottle poured into a Weihenstephaner Weiss glass, produced a proper two fingers worth of white head that lasts. The body of this wonderful brew was a hazy and golden orange in color  The aromas of bananas, wheat and spices filled my head. The nose on this is exactly what I expect in a Hefe. The banana smell wasn't overpowering as in some others  The flavors mimic the nose, but it is very refreshing in the way it plays in your mouth. Good carbonation and light as well, great flavors this is a world class Hefe. This starts of sweet and fruity and had a light dry finish.  Highly drinkable, it would be my go to session brew if it weren't so expensive.",Bayerische Staatsbrauerei Weihenstephan,Germany,Hefeweizen,98

Smells of good ""wheatiness', with a touch of sweetness, citrus, clove, and a little banana. Taste was right along with aroma, with the banana coming through a bit stronger. Very smooth, easy to drink. A very, very good hefe, one of the best, but, for me, a notch below New Glarus' Dancing Man Wheat.",Bayerische Staatsbrauerei Weihenstephan,Germany,Hefeweizen,98

Leaves nice lacing on the sides.  Smell: Bananas and cloves - yet I get a touch of grapefruit and citus.  Taste: Wheaty with bananas and cloves.  Mouthfeel: Smooth, light, with a slight bit of bite from the bubbles.  Drinkability: Easy to drink. Leads toward quick drinking because it is just that smooth.",Bayerische Staatsbrauerei Weihenstephan,Germany,Hefeweizen,98
252,731,canucklehead,4.1,Well I have never had any of their beers before but the reputation preceded the Hefe. Light colour with big head this is a most graceful Hefe with all the banana and cloves in a seamless blend. Not my favourite Hefe as I prefer big bold flavours but the quality is unmistakable. Very refined and hopefully available in BC soon .,Bayerische Staatsbrauerei Weihenstephan,Germany,Hefeweizen,98
252,731,ljbrisson,4.45,"Pours cloudy, hazy cider yellow-orange into a weizen glass with a voluptuous, off-white, puffy 2 to 3 finger head which clings in splotches to the inside of the glass. Aroma is very nice with lots of citrus, spice, orange, apple, and yeast. Mouthfeel is smooth, slick, and medium-bodied with just enough carbonation to even it out. Taste is very complex; banana, spices, and coriander up front with a yeasty, spicy, banana bready middle and a deliciously smooth, tart finish. The more it warms the more the spices and fruit taste comes to the fore. Overall this is a great beer and the best I've had in the style. ABV and great taste make this brew highly drinkable.",Bayerische Staatsbrauerei Weihenstephan,Germany,Hefeweizen,98
252,731,John_M,4.47,"Have had this beer many times, both in bottle and on tap. Had on draft at Max's the other day, the prototypical German hefe.  The beer pours a hazy gold color with impressive head retention and lacing. The nose is hefeweizen perfection, consisting of bubble bum, banana, clove and even nutmeg. The aroma on this beer defines what a hefe should smell like. The flavors on the palate replicate the nose, but the beer finishes completely dry. It starts off with a bit of spicey sweetness, but on the finish the beer is dry and wheaty. The beer is pretty full bodied for a wheat beer, but otherwise I would describe the mouthfeel as medium bodied. Drinkability is very good, though the amount of spice would keep me from drinking more then one or two of these at a sitting.  I still prefer the schneider-weisse when it comes to wheat beers, but this is undeniably outstanding. An absolute classic.",Bayerische Staatsbrauerei Weihenstephan,Germany,Hefeweizen,98

Just a kiss of bitter hop at finish to balance. Grassiness, bubblegum, mild phenols pop up in between. Tasty.  M--Typical quality witbier. Medium-bodied. Creamy and nice.  D--My bottle went too fast.

A: Pours an amazingly cloudy beautiful golden color with a 1-2 finger head that dissipates in about five minutes.  S: Holy effin wow. First, you get slammed in the face with maybe the best yeasty wheat smell I have ever experienced. Then, you get to really analyze what's going on in there. There's definitely some citrus, cloves, and some fruit, maybe bananas.  T: The taste is a tangy wheaty taste, complete with bubblegum and full-on banana, which give way to an aftertaste of cloves that intensifies as it lingers in your mouth.  M: this is awesome. Perfectly bodied and well carbonated, this is pretty much right what it needs to be.

Cloudy pale yellow-orange color with a thick cap of peaks-and-valleys head resting atop it.  Smells of yeast and barley and grapefruit citrus. Smells like a piece of heaven was used during the fermentation process.  Honest to God, I never thought I'd have a wheat beer that could compare with Paulaner; and this really blows it away. Wow. Sooo good. The yeast gives it a bananna/citrus taste that is just perfect.  Well balanced brew, carbonation is present but not dominant; pleasant aftertaste.  Now I see what everyone has been talking about. Holy shit.",Bayerische Staatsbrauerei Weihenstephan,Germany,Hefeweizen,98

My taste tester didn't let me down. A nice spicy aroma of corriander, clove, and some juniper.  Flavor has a bit of chalky and powerdery yeast up front, but its oh so smooth and a really nice spicy treat. Some light banana flavors in the middle to finish.  Mouthfeel is full and almost chewy. Good malt body with wheat an dyeast holding strong. A supurb hefe in every resepect. This would only hurt to have a lemon put into it.",Bayerische Staatsbrauerei Weihenstephan,Germany,Hefeweizen,98

Taste: Cloves and banana as well..mostly fruity. Overall pretty good in this department.  Mouthfeel: Carbonation is higher, so it ends up being pretty crisp...goes down well too. Pretty refreshing, which is what many hefeweizens shoot for.  Drinkability: Succeeds in this too...the crispness and light fruit flavors result in a pretty drinkable beer.

I remember liking this one best at the event so I picked up a bottle to try at home.  A: Cloudy! Hazy-golden, the head went away after the pour. With each sip, it left a great lacing on the glass.  S: Smells like bannanas, cloves and a little yeasty. I noticed that there were hints of fruit.  T: Fruity, bannanas, and heavy on the clove-like flavor. Grainy but but not overpowering on any flavor, really a great taste. No heavy after-taste.  M: Carbonation is heavy, very refreshing, especially in the festival atmosphere. Dry finish.

Straight clove smell. Can't sniff past it to anything else.  Taste of cloves. Maybe some light fruit. I can't get the banana flavor I was expecting. Heavy, heavy clove flavor.  Medium creamy body.  I'm a little underwhelmed with this beer. It's definitely good but I wouldn't call it the best hefe I've ever had. The cloves are too prominent.  Overall: good tasting drinkable hefe",Bayerische Staatsbrauerei Weihenstephan,Germany,Hefeweizen,98
252,731,gory4d,4.26,"Pours a pale, cloudy straw-color with a dense, four-finger head. The smell is faint but nice: spice and fruit and some funk. The taste is bigger than you'd expect, with the requisite banana notes but also with some nice hop spice and a pleasantly bitter finish. It's just shy of too viscous, but the ample carbonation makes it fill up the mouth deliciously. Easy to drink a few, rich but quenching. A fantastic beer.",Bayerische Staatsbrauerei Weihenstephan,Germany,Hefeweizen,98

Lots of bananas in this smell along with a bready yeasty note. Pretty much like banana bread.  As expected, Taste is heavy on the banana also with a little bit of a citrus note and a slight wheat twang. A bready yeast flavor rounds out the beer. Creamy, well carbonated, feels great in the mouth.  Pretty drinkable beer; strong on the banana, but still impressive.",Bayerische Staatsbrauerei Weihenstephan,Germany,Hefeweizen,98
252,731,SimplySinister,4.5,"A - A cloudy golden color. Acceptable head with moderate lacing. This beer also contains high amounts of carbonation.  S - Two words - Banana bread. Additional citrus notes linger. It truly it a powerful smelling brew as opposed to the other competing Hefeweizens.  T - A strong wheaty/bready/grainy taste with a definite banana infusion. Extremely crisp, and very refreshing. Cloves are very apparent though somewhat overshadowed by the banana.  M - Crisp and dry. High carbonation adds a fair amount of bite (enough to keep it interesting.)  D - Good drinkability. Weihenstephaner is a delicious beer and one of my favorite wheat beers. If you like wheat beers you cannot go wrong with this one, but if you are just starting out with them you might find this one a little overwhelming.  In retrospect, if you like wheat beers this one might end up being at the top of your list. Its a shame that in my area I have a rather hard time finding it, but that doesn't keep me from searching store shelves in hopes of finding it again and again.",Bayerische Staatsbrauerei Weihenstephan,Germany,Hefeweizen,98
252,731,Reino,4.9,"Appearance- A hazy orange-gold brew with a big, triumphant white head that recedes at a gingerly pace. Such a beautiful head and color as well as nice lacing that crawls down the glass as I drink it gives me everything I'm looking for in a beers appearance.  Smell- Sweet, sweet, sweet banana and clove. Also joining the party is a bit of mild citrus, maybe lemon, and wheat earthiness. I have had this brew a few times, but just now noticed that the way the sweetness and clove pair up smells very much like sweet pumpkin pie. This fucker gets the mouth watering and ready for action.  Taste- Much like the smell: banana, clove, sweet wheat and citrus that is more orange in the taste than it was in the smell. Maybe a bit of tart apple in there, as well. There's a decent amount of pepper and alcohol heat through the finish that I love. It has to have that spice to balance out that awesome sweetness. Quite a bit like its winter brother, Vitus.  MF- Crisp, snappy carbonation with a silky smooth underbelly that is SLIGHTLY watery. That is the only thing I can find wrong with this beer, and it's barely noticeable. Otherwise, the feel is exactly what you want out of a hefe.  Drinkability- Out of this world good. One of those haunting beers that has you craving it anytime the temperature is above 70. Hell, I crave it when it's cold and rainy. It's just that good.  *Note-This review goes out to one of my family pets, Toivo. It became clear while in the middle of taking notes for this beer that he'll need to be put down.

Taste followed nose; very muted and subdued. Mouthfeel was light in body and lively in effervescence with a clean citrus flavor lingering at the aftertaste.

T: Taste did not disappoint with banana and clove coming through clearly.  M: Medium body with nice coating of the mouth and tongue. Carbonation may have been a little more than teh beer needed.

252,731,CAMRAhardliner,4.88,"Pours a glowing peach color haze, a light hue for a Hefeweizen. Sediment swirls in the middle, but there isnt much of it. The massive ivory head lasts forever and leaves an intricate lacework on the glass. The aroma is full of fruit, like a banana and orange smoothie almost. Doughy pale malts and tangy wheat is also redolent in the nose. The taste is pretty much perfect for the style. Fruity yeast esters explode out of the gates with banana, citrus, bubblegum and cloves all vividly represented. Fresh wheat malt and cookie barley malt makes a perfect balance to the dense yeast flavors. Hops are modest, some sea air noble hop aroma and a mild bitterness in the finish. The mouthfeel is light and incredibly smooth. Carbonation bubbles are silk like consistency.  This is a fantastic wheat beer. Full of flavor and perfect for summers.

Malt sweetness and a somewhat grainy characteristic that leads one to a dry yeast/bread flavor. Halfway thru the glass I found a slight tart finish on the tongue that kept me coming back for more. This is one of the better beers I have had in a while. Forgot to mention a slight trace of spice (almost pepper-like) bite. Sure has a lot going on!

I do think it is an excellent beer but I'll have to drop it down. The mouthfeel now seems a little weak, a little undercarbonated to other hefeweizens I've had lately, and the flavor gets bored to me because no one aspect really stands out tremendously. It's still a really good beer though.  ___  7038 stamped on the back of the bottle  A- would be a 5 if it had better head retention. The head builds up very nicely, as large as you want it, but it doesn't stick as long as it should.  S- The smell is big on wheat, but nothing huge in any one direction as far as yeast by-products go. Clove is pretty tame but there. Banana I can't really find in the aroma. It's a pretty sweet smell. I would personally like more banana, but it's good anyway.  T- Again, the great thing is the wheat is front and center, yet it's not unbalanced in the clove or banana direction. Wheat dominates and is very tasty. Maybe it's the bubblegum like flavor that combines with the wheat to give it the sweetness.  M- This is where it beats every other Hefe I've had by a mile. There plenty of carbonation but it isn't disgustingly prickly like so many other overcarbonated hefe's.

Smell is fragrant and luxurious. Lemon and clove, bananas and yeast esters. Sweet wheat malt and apples. A touch of bubblegum and light fruits.  Taste is as good as it gets. Big lemon and wheat malt upfront. Banana and clove follows. Light grapeyness and spicy peppery notes. A dry clean finish the is gently hopped and barely bitter. A trace of alcohol. Light toast on the tongue remains.  Mouthfeel is perfectly summery light and bubbly. Not quite creamy but very smooth on the mouth as you just want more and more.

The overall smell was of baked banana bread with a healthy dosing of nutmeg and clove. No real perceivable hop aroma, perhaps slightly floral. Buttery yeasty notes as well  Taste: Absent of bananas but full of wheat and more of a melon flavor and some slight clove-like spice. Absolutely wonderful.  Mouthfeel: The carbonation really fills your mouth and the bubbles seemed particularly fine (perhaps due to it being on-tap) and pricked the tongue.

252,731,becktone,4.58,"From notes 8-10-08  Eye: Cloudy yellow in appearance, was going to use ""cloudy wheat"" but I think given that this is a wheat beer the word painting done by ""cloudy wheat"" would be obscure or redundant. Head formation is wonderful, but retention is another matter, starts out nice, but quickly fades to an average head. After that retention of the creamy looking head is good, but with a wheat, I think it needs to be much larger. Lacing looks to be poor.  Nose: Bread, strong yeast aromas, banana, slight clove in there as well. Not much more, wouldn't expect much more either. This is classic, was able to actually smell all that without really looking for it (had to go to the kitchen and smell some ground cloves first, then look for it, but once I knew what to look for, the cloves were apparent).  Tongue: Huge wheat flavor, nice yeast esters/phenols come though just as well in the mouth as they do in the nose. Nice, simple, classic. Hops are pretty much absent in terms of flavor...ehh maybe some slight spice....  Mouthfeel and Drinkability: Smooth and creamy on the palate. Much fuller than I expected for a wheat beer, still not full bodied though, but full for a wheat. Carbonation is lower, and does not seem forced as with some beers....one can just tell that it has been forced. This is much more natural feeling. This is a staple example of the style in my opinion. One that I'll much likely be picking up again and again. Nothing that wows, but just a general good example of the style.",Bayerische Staatsbrauerei Weihenstephan,Germany,Hefeweizen,98

Smell is banana, with an unusually strong vanilla presence. Very 'fresh' and inviting.  Taste is amazing, with yeasty vanilla, banana, and canteloupe taking turns stepping forward, then melding together for a lasting finish. Every flavor is strong enough to be noticeable, but nothing overpowers.  Effervescent carbonation makes this just prickly enough to balance the creaminess in the taste, and makes this go down very easily.

You get a caramelized banana smell from the yeast with some spiciness.  The taste was fabulous. It was well flavored with the bananas coming through to slither on the tongue. You get the malted barley and wheat as the backbone with the follow up of the yeast. It is semi chewy and leaves a happy coating on the mouth. Overall this is probably the gold standard for Hefeweizen.,Bayerische Staatsbrauerei Weihenstephan,Germany,Hefeweizen,98
252,731,UGADawgGuy,5,"Poured from a .5L bottle into my .5L Weihenstephaner weizen glass. In case you're new to the style, you should know that it is CRITICAL that hefeweizen be served quite cold and in an appropriate glass, for a number of reasons.  Appearance: This beer pours from a brown bottle with an elegant-looking label, which touts Weihenstephaner as the ""oldest brewery in the world."" Once it's in the glass, a good weizen pour reveals a hazy, golden liquid with a frothy, meringue-like head. A little beer was left in the bottle for ""swishing"" in order to unleash that delicious, yeasty sediment into the glass (in my opinion, this is essential with traditional hefeweizens).  Smell: A fantastic bouquet of starchy, mildly citric goodness, with a hint of spice (cloves?). There's a mild banana-like element here, too. The prevailing scent, though, is a uniquely yeasty breadiness.  Taste: Follows the nose. Cold, refreshing bread in a bottle, with a hint of very mild citrus and a very light spice/clove note at the end. Hops are not evident. This is true to the style, and for my taste in hefeweizens, that's a good thing. Regarding the style -- Weihenstephaner practically INVENTED this style of beer, so it stands to reason that they would brew a great one.  Mouthfeel: Crisp, ample carbonation and a low ABV combine with the starchy yeast to produce a cooling, refreshing swallow. This is a beer that you could GULP down if thirsty without being overwhelmed. I don't recommend that, though. This is a beer to be savored.  Drinkability: Again, the low ABV, cold serving temperature, and refreshing flavor profile yield a fantastically drinkable beer. There's a reason this beer is consistently viewed as among the most sessionable beers on the planet. On a hot summer day, there's not much out there that could be more refreshing. Of course, if you're me, you'll drink it year-round, because it is your favorite beer of all time.",Bayerische Staatsbrauerei Weihenstephan,Germany,Hefeweizen,98
252,731,PerzentRizen,4.87,"The first time I tried Weihenstephaner Hefeweissbier I was in New York city at a german beer garden and it was recommended by the german expat there. I later had it on tap at Rolf's on 3rd Avenue.  I was very fortunate to get a chance to try this beer at the proper temperature, in the brewery glass, and with a professional's pour (that swirl to extract the yeast at the bottom is something I would not have known without being told).  This beer pours a light cloudy pale with a large, frothy head that is captured superbly in the Weihenstephaner bulbed glass.  The smell is of fresh corriander, fennel, apricot, and orange peel.  I did regret that the bar tender/owner tried to place a lemon slice in my beer. Trendy I doubt they did that a thousand years ago when that brewery was first created!  I have continued to enjoy this beer for the past 7 years and will continue; particularly when the temperature escalates. Enjoy!",Bayerische Staatsbrauerei Weihenstephan,Germany,Hefeweizen,98

Tastes of phenolic flavors of banana and cloves right along the lines of this style. More cloves than any other flavor...maybe even bubble gum? A bit bitter but not over the top.  Great blend of a mouthfeel. Smooth, a bit wet, and lots of carbonation. A hop bite lingers.  GReat beer. Would like to session this some time.  This beer goes right along with the style type. Hence it's deserving of high scores.",Bayerische Staatsbrauerei Weihenstephan,Germany,Hefeweizen,98
252,731,philipquarles,4.45,"On tap at the Bier Museum in Köln. Poured a nice hazy yellow with a huge white head. Great retention and fantastic lacing. Smell is citrus up front, with other fruits following and then a bit of wheat. Presents even more upon tasting, with apricot and banana esters coming into the picture. Without a doubt the most complex, best tasting hefeweizen I've had. Mouthfeel is also excellent-creamy head and thick body. Maybe I loved it so much because I had been drinking (relatively) boring kölsch all day, but this is overall just a brilliant beer.",Bayerische Staatsbrauerei Weihenstephan,Germany,Hefeweizen,98

The apperance alone made the beer appealing. It appears to have a lot of carbonations.  S: The aroma is top notch, one of the best from a Hefe that I have tried so far. Very complex with hints of wheat/yeast, fruit, spices and maybe some floral notes as well.  T: What can you say about the taste, but exceptional. It follows the nose to a T with the wheat/yeast and banana/fruit really coming through.  M/D: I could have drank this beer all night if I had more bottles of it. The carbonation was right for the style, it was smooth with a medium body. Great summer beer and really it would be good at any other time of the year as well. Has to be one of my all time favorites, especially since it is my favorite style.",Bayerische Staatsbrauerei Weihenstephan,Germany,Hefeweizen,98

For my money up there with the best hefeweizens I've had. Banana, clove, and other spices blossom on the tongue without a hint of bitterness or uneasiness. It's sweet malt wheat is balanced by a light citrus bitterness, but the finish is of the spices. This is one full-bodied beer, too. Excellent brew, highly recommended.",Bayerische Staatsbrauerei Weihenstephan,Germany,Hefeweizen,98

I stared at it for a minute and enjoyed how well this glass of beer looked. Great taste and mouth feel, good lacing and so very drinkable. Not as fruity as some of the hefeweizens such as a hoegaarden or even the ommegedonn white.

A beautiful golden color and very cloudy in the glass with a fantastic head and great lacing. After enjoying it's appearance I took a few drinks and was instantly guessing at all of the different flavors that can be found in this beer. This style is not on my top five list, but It is a well crafted beer.

252,731,roadhouse,4.5,"Poured from 16.9 oz. bottle, rolled to rouse the yeast, into a weizen glass.  Appears a cloudy golden orange-yellow with a white two finger tall head. Carbonation bubbles swirling up throughout the glass. Nice sheets of lacing down the side of the glass.  Aroma of bananas and spicy cloves. A bit of a sweet, mellow orange as well. Tangy/bready wheat malt underneath it all.  Flavors are mostly identical to the aroma. However, the banana is not really present as much. Instead the cloves take over and the bready flavor of the wheat malt does the singing. Finishes with a touch of noble hop bitterness.  Mouthfeel is light and smooth. Just as it should be for the style.  This is probably my favorite Hefeweizen I've tried so far. Perfect mingling of the banana and clove flavors. Make sure to roll the bottle first to rouse the yeast. I believe it really lets a lot more of the flavors out.",Bayerische Staatsbrauerei Weihenstephan,Germany,Hefeweizen,98

Smells bready, yeast, wheat, oranges, banana, clove, and mildewed grass.  Tastes spicy zing with clove flavor, undertones of malt sweet, and minimal esters. Not a biting clove sting, which was a surprise to get that strong of a clove flavor without the tongue-piercing phenols. Yeast and wheat are heavy with earthiness in the mouth. Oranges and banana fight to appear, but are driven away by a sting from the strong carbonation. Aftertaste dominated by apricot esters and acrid from the carbonation. Wet can't quite win through the yeast-made zing, yt the finish isn't quite drying. Near balance to the conflict with zing winning out, but not soundly. Mouthfeel is md-light with some dextrinous character. Strong carbonation that melds with the yeasty spiciness. A decent beer, but not one I need to repeat. Wearing by the end of the bottle.",Bayerische Staatsbrauerei Weihenstephan,Germany,Hefeweizen,98

Smell is all wheat, some lemon and some other spice being noticed as well. More wheat and you can taste the yeast in there as well. This is a Hefe in the purest sense of the word. Clean and non-cloying. Refreshing, perfect warm weather beer.

Large amounts of lacing is left on the glass. The aroma is filled with cloves and banana esters. The flavor is heavy with clove spiciness. A little too one dimensional to rate a higher taste rating. But this beer has a perfect mouthfeel. Creamy or a velvety texture with just enough carbonation to make the flavors pop. A great beer indeed.

What I'd expect from a German Hefe.  T&M: light body, very crisp. perfect level of carbonation. lots of lovely spicing, mostly clove dominant. strong fruity flavors mostly banana with a slight dryness to it, followed by some citrus tones, and a lemony aftertaste. Excellent summer hefe!  D: Excellent beer, probably one of the top in it's style (as most would agree). I think the only thing preventing this from a full on 5 is the spicing.

T & M: This beer tastes like a weissbier should. Pleasant spices but not overwhelming. Incredibly refreshing mouthfeel, this is a beer that stays on the palate. Superlative taste.

Aroma is great, prominent, yet balanced, phenols and esters with a touch of wheat in the background. The banana esters are a bit more prominent than the clove-like phenols but don't completely overshadow them. The flavor is simply excellent. Moderate banana esters are dominant at first but then give way to a fleeting bubblegum flavor. Spicy clove phenols, also moderate, then come to the forefront. A slight tartness then appears in the relatively dry finish. The bubblegum flavor then briefly returns a bit more dominantly in the finish. For me the bubblegum in the finish was the only flaw in the flavor (I thought it just a bit too noticeable) otherwise this beer is easily a 5. Mouthfeel is good, light-medium body that is fairly creamy with moderate carbonation which wasn't quite enough in my opinion. Drinkability is great. This is a beer that I could drink all day long.

Good stuff - bananas, weizen yeast, cloves, and a slight bubblegum-y scent. It is a rare day when the nose on a beer makes me this excited.  T: Not quite as awesome as the nose, but still fantastic. This is everything I expect from a good weizen - good yeast character, with a well-developed version of the characteristic banana taste. The clove character is also very present, and I can pick up a faint hint of that aforementioned bubblegum taste. These all blend well with the wheat flavor to make a beer that is very well-balanced.  M: Very chill, lots of nice carbonation keeps things light. Slightly creamy, but not clinging. Refreshing.  D: If I had a case of these, it would be a very, VERY dangerous evening.  Weihenstephaner just earned itself a very special place in my heart.

Smell: Very light smell actually, with hint of citrus and yeast. Very appealing.  Taste: Initial taste has a strong clove flavour with a hint of banana. The banana dissipates quickly and you're left with a spicy clove taste that lingers well after the swallow. Fairly complex flavour for a light and refreshing brew.  Mouthfeel: It has a very nice carbonated, spicy, lively feel. You definitely know it's in your mouth.  Drinkability: Extremely easy to drink.

One of my favorite beers arrives in its signature weizen glass with mostly-clear amber body and a fat finger of head. Too clear and too golden-amber. Looks wrong.  Smell has virtually none of the banana or clove I loved so much about the bottled version, but instead features more noticeable, herbal hops, and even a tinge of caramel, wrong to the point I thought I had a mispour. I didn't.  The taste lacks the fresh yeasty goodness I've come to associate with this beer.

Appearance - pours out a hazy orangish yellow, a very thick and cakey head on top, over two fingers in height and giving up ground very grudgingly. Lots of lace arcs and rainbows on the hefe glass.  Aroma - a doughy, yeasty smell with more spice and less banana. Good but not as livey and varied as the Live Oak.  Taste - a sweet, butterscotch flavor with the grain. I immediately grab the bottle and look for a freshnes date, but find none. Fruity follow-up, not bad. A bit of spicy balance post-swallow and hints of Cracker Jack on the finish (and occasional belch). Tasty enough but doesn't nail the style like I thought it would.  Mouthfeel - medium-bodied, crisp carbonation and a nice smoothness all do well for the beer.  Drinkability - I'd have it again, in fact I've had this a number of times and was interested to see how it stacked up against the #1 hefe.

A gentle pour still gave up over two inches. Retention is great. Lace is intricate and generous. This beer is picture perfect.  S - Wheat is the biggest part of the aroma. Notes of banana and pale malt back up the wheat very well. Hints of alcohol and hops lay in the background and are hard to detect. The wheat really steals the show with this beer. It stays constant throughout the aroma.  T - The wheat is not as strong as the smell would suggest. It is still the biggest part of the flavor. The secondary flavors are done very well and include: banana, pineapple, yeast, honey, peppery spice, and fresh bread. Just like the smell, some alcohol and hops are on the tail end and stay in a distant background.  M - Medium bodied with excellent carbonation. Finish is just a little bitter with a nice wheat bite.  D - Drinkability is very nice. This one has all the right qualities to make it a great beer. I would happily have more of this one. The relatively low alcohol and smooth flavors make it disappear pretty quick. Highly recommended.",Bayerische Staatsbrauerei Weihenstephan,Germany,Hefeweizen,98
252,731,KeefD,4.22,"Poured from a 16.9oz bottle into a glass. Develops a nice off-white head that recedes somewhat slowly leaving behind some nice fluffy lacing. Smell is of bananas, some sweet malt and delicate floral notes. Taste is slightly fruity, hints of orange and banana, lots of pale wheat malt giving it some nice sweetness and little to no hop bitterness. Finishes dry. Goes down very smooth, light carbonation, and an all around pleasing drink. One of my favorite Weissbiers.",Bayerische Staatsbrauerei Weihenstephan,Germany,Hefeweizen,98

Aroma had lots of coriander and clove spiciness. I also noticed some banana, bubble gum, and wheat graininess. Lots of yeast character is noticeable.  Sweet beer with pronounced wheat character. Clove/coriander and orange citrus also present. Some hints of banana are there as well.  Medium body with moderate carbonation. I could easily find myself drinking quite a few of these.

252,731,hustlesworth,4.65,"A- super foam explosion. weird reverse cascade action is captivating, the foam undulates from the bottom as jet streams up bubbles continuously add to it. beautiful hazed canary yellow, golden, and brass. nearly snow white head is soapy and dense with a thin pitted membrane laid out over the top. this foam has amazing staying power and though it pops and fizzes and makes little dimples in its surface, it just doesn't seem to budge. when it finally finishes morphing, it takes on the form of a 1/2in thick foamy dish and pretty much stays that way aside from the abstract trails of lace it leaves behind.  S- fresh banana peel, clove, and lots of wheat. some bazooka bubblegum as well and a bit of floral lemony spiciness. yeast is just incredible, in-your-face, and completely controls the aroma. not a bad thing.  T- wheaty and fresh, the clove/banana/bubblegum backs off a little and other flavors come through. every kind of plain bread i can imagine, a light lemon blossom floweriness, and sharp yet mild noble hops in the form of bitter lemon peel and cut grass. underlying the yeasty sweetness is a raw pilsener flavor without all the bitterness. so very traditional tasting, using all the hefe elements to their full potential, i couldn't ask for anything more.  MF- crisp and refreshing on the front side, a little sugary on the back side which is most likely an illusion created by the yeast sweetness. if all you ever eat is sugar, what should you taste like? sweeet! but, eh, i'd like a little dryness. mid-high carb along with tons of wheat keep the body light and keep me focused and after the sweetness fades the finish is crisp and bready.  D- absolutely refreshing to say the least. aside from a gallon of water or an un-named less-than-flavorful american style lager that i only intend to chug, this would be what i dream of on a hot afternoon when my yard is clean and i'm covered with bugs and grass clippings. cheers to the oldest brewery in the world!",Bayerische Staatsbrauerei Weihenstephan,Germany,Hefeweizen,98

The smell is delightfully spicy with ginger and cloves, cinammon, banana and orange zest. The taste is similarly up front; wheat, citrus, a sharp edge and a malty bitterness in the finish. Balanced acidity, substantial body, smooth mouthfeel; I found this beer a great example of the style and a really satisfying, refreshing diversion from my evening routine. The only slight criticism might be that it was a bit gassy until it got some air, hardly a fault in a brew worth savouring like this one is.",Bayerische Staatsbrauerei Weihenstephan,Germany,Hefeweizen,98

Wheaty, overripe bananas along with some lemon and cloves.  t: This is damn near a perfect hefe. Nothing cloying or artifcial tasting in this one. Wheat flavors that suggest bananas and bublegum rather hit you upside the head with them. Mild peppery spices and a suggestion of citrus.  m: This is the heartiest hefe I've tried so far.

Taste is amazing and refreshing. Tastes as it smells with a little spice in the background and slightly sweet. Simply one of the best hefs out there.

Displays a huge puffy head that floats atop a hazy golden liquid with lots of swirling bubbles. Aroma displays banana, vanilla, and light clove, with just a hint of citrus. The mouthfeel explodes with big carbonation and light body. Flavor is a nice blend of banana/vanilla with underlying spiciness. The key is in the balance - all the flavor elements blend nicely and nothing dominates. Many other hefe's tend to be heavy on one element or another but this one is perfect.  Overall, this is IMO the finest example of the style available outside Germany. A must try for any lover of the German hefeweiss style.",Bayerische Staatsbrauerei Weihenstephan,Germany,Hefeweizen,98

Very clean wheat taste, somewhat powdery. Refreshingly crisp malt, dry grain. Fruitiness isn't overpowering as I find it often is in the style. The banana and lemon undertones are there, but they play second fiddle to the wheat and malt. Little bit of clove but not much spice to speak of. I get next to no alcohol at all, which is somewhat bizarre for the style. It's leaning towards a Belgian style wheat beer, hence the .5 knocked off taste. Not complaining though.  Very clean, refreshing beer, perfect for the season.  A gold-standard. Can't go wrong with this one.",Bayerische Staatsbrauerei Weihenstephan,Germany,Hefeweizen,98

Cloudy, with some suspended particles (I rolled the bottle), a bit orangey vs other hefes I've had. Great head. Less lacing than Denison's though.  Notes of banana (sweet, rummy), cloves, bubblegum. A hint of citrus. Basically, no off notes.  In relation to other hefes I'd say this one was a bit sweeter. Same combination of flavours as in the aroma, lots of bubblegum which I enjoy.

I had this at a gathering and did not have the opportunity to do a contemplative review, but I will review this beer in more detail at a later time. My first reactions and impressions were quite positive. I think I like the Ayinger Hefe a bit more, but this beer hits all the right notes. L'Chaim.  Re-review August 2009: The wonderful clove and candied flavors in the yeast really make this an enjoyable hefe.

Smell - Chocked full of banana and lemon. Very deep malt smell, and whiffs of wheat are present.  Taste & Mouthfeel - Awesome creaminess up front. Banana and lemon comes through behind the creamy malts. Wheat and cloves help to balance this one out in a beautiful way. Very crisp, lite, and refreshing.  Drinkability - Picked this one up in Chicago, and have anxiously been waiting to crack it open. I love hefe-weizens in the spring, and have relied on Paulaner which is fantastic, and available here in Louisiana. This is a masterful stab at a hefe-weizen.

Perhaps not as much banana in this as in some other hefe-weissens I have sampled lately, like for instance the Paulaner. Other elements in the nose are cloves and, of course, wheat.  Dry taste, carboration is medium, perhaps more intense than in the Franziskaner, but less than in the Paulaner.

Pleasantly subtle wheat, banana, clove, yeasty esters... just right. Not overpowering as most Hefeweizen seem to be, IMO. Just nice and soft.  T/M: Again, very soft on the palate but you can still taste everything. The malts add a touch of sweetness to balance out the delicate hops and yeast. Body is light, crisp, and very refreshing.

What is left resembles soft cotton. Smells sour, citric & spicy with the trademark banana-wheat aroma of a hefeweiss. Even more powerful than most German versions of the variety (which tend to be very fragrent). Flavors are very pronunced but surprisingly smooth. There is a sourness to it, but not as bitingly sharp as others of the variety. Banana/clove is there, as well as yeast, wheat & citric acid. Everything is well-balanced as it is lively on the tongue, but smooth on the palate as it goes down. Carbonation remains throughout and the mouth is left tingling with the yeast, hop & spicy elements of the brew. All I can say is, Wow. I love a good German weissbier and this is the best I've had yet, even moreso than my previous favorite from Paulaner. This brewery is apparently one who can live up to its billing & history.

Alcohol tends to shine through a tad.  M - Light to medium bodied, with prickly carbonation.  D - A great session beer aside from cost; the only thing that cost it half a point was the somewhat prickly carbonation.

T = Tart at the very first with a mixture of lemon and orange quickly giving over to a sweet mixture of mandarin orange and warmed banana with a honey glaze, finally tastes of a wheat muffin covered with lemon-orange marmalade brings the first tastes back into the long sweet-tart finish.  M = Medium bodied, nice level of carbonation with a mixture of foaming and stinging, good mouthcoating.  D = A great, great beer to drink on a warm Spring day. I could drink these all afternoon but sadly this is my last one until I buy more.",Bayerische Staatsbrauerei Weihenstephan,Germany,Hefeweizen,98
252,731,spointon,4.5,"I poured this hefe from a tall, brown, 16.9fl oz bottle bearing the brewery's hook: Oldest Brewery in the World - brewing since 1040!  A= This wheat beer poured a dark gold to orange color, unfiltered and hazy. The head was out of control, easily 3-4 inches, white and chunky, with a moderate pour in a hefeweizen glass. Lacing was thick and impressive as well.  S= Beautiful malty goodness. Sweetness with fruity aromas of bubblegum, bananas, and yeast.  T= Obvious forward notes of wheat, fruity yeast, and a hint of citrus. Some cloves, but not over the top. Not much in the way of hop taste here. Very slightly sour and dry at the very end.  MF= This one sports a medium body that is lifted significantly by the high carbonation. Feels crisp and clean for the style.  D= Hefe's are not my favorite, but this is the best I have ever had. This beer is in balance, the wheat and yeast play nicely together and there is not toto much of the banana/clove flavor that everyone wants to pump their wheat beers full of. An excellent world class beer!",Bayerische Staatsbrauerei Weihenstephan,Germany,Hefeweizen,98
252,731,TeddyBG,4.06,"A: Cloudy burnt orange color, with a white head that lasts. Good lacing. Served in a UFO Hefe glass.  S: slight cloves and perhaps honey.  T: Very good. Cloves up front and banana's towards the end of the glass.  M: Very good carbonation.  D: Excellent. Easily session this one.",Bayerische Staatsbrauerei Weihenstephan,Germany,Hefeweizen,98
252,731,Kegatron,4.4,"500 ml bottle into a Hefe glass.  Pours a hazy golden orange with a big poof of foamy brite-white head. Shrinks down into a good looking thin and creamy retention that leaves just huge lacing behind. The aroma is a little like a fruit salad off the bat, with accents of oranges and banana esters, followed by clove, corriander, yeast, wheat, and backing sweetness. Quite a lot going on!  The taste is just as complex and well balanced as the aroma. Zesty orange and prominant banana notes up front mixed with a spicy clove presence meld into a earthy blend of caramel sweetness and yeast. There is also just a touch of grassy, light hop bitterness that runs throughout, bringing a little bit of pop to the proceedings. The mouthfeel has a pleasant light medium feel that while going down incredibly smooth still has a bit of a full feel with just the right amount of crisp carbonation.  Wow, a solid Hefe for sure and probably one of the best I've had with a potent mix of flavors that just pop and an oh-so-easy drinkibility. This was delicous and I will definitley be seeking more of it out with the upcoming warm weather.",Bayerische Staatsbrauerei Weihenstephan,Germany,Hefeweizen,98
252,731,hyland24,4.5,Poured from a bottle into a weizen glass. Poured a hazy dirty blond. with a 1/2 inch white foam head leaving behind whole sheets of white foam. The smell was bananas and citrus. Creamy banana and citrus flavors with hop spice and clove. Creamy and delicious with nice smooth chewy mouthcoat. Very drinkable and definitely a top notch easy drinking beer.,Bayerische Staatsbrauerei Weihenstephan,Germany,Hefeweizen,98
252,731,marcpal,4.75,"Had this one last night on tap in NYC and today the bottle I had bottle sitting in my fridge picked up earlier in the week I had been looking to try. 16.9oz bottle poured into tall weisen glass.  A: Peach/orange color with a thick off white head with a ton of structure. Light lacing.  S: Aromas of lots of banana and plenty of yeast. Other fruitiness as well with plenty of non overbearing spices. Really shined in this aspect, appetizing.  T: Balance of everything was perfect for this style of beer. Been having more of the style lately and the taste on this one surpasses most if not all. The sweetness, bitterness, spiciness, and yeasty flavors are all in happy harmony. Banana was dominant flavor you are left with.  M: Extremely enjoyable in that it was light on the palete and the carbonation was pinpoint. Smooth and balanced spices with out being overly sweet.  D: Not thick or tiring, could drink these all season and plan on doing so. Very light and this one is at the head of the class.  Highly highly recommended.",Bayerische Staatsbrauerei Weihenstephan,Germany,Hefeweizen,98
252,731,Lupe,4.48,"Pours a cloudy and golden orange with a huge white head. The soapy head has some serious retention, yet leaves little lacing behind.  Wheaty aroma with some sweetness, honey, and apple. Some mild spice in the nose as well as yeast and bright lemon.  Refreshing and crisp flavors. Starts mildly sweet before wheat, biscuit and some fruit come in. Earthy yeast character kicks in with a hints of lemon and dash of clove. Light hop bitterness, gets drier toward the end with some cracker. Light nuttiness rounds things out. Not much banana or bubble gum, which makes it crisper. Linger toasted grain with a bone dry finish.  Medium bodied and smooth. Goes down easy with great flavor. Easier to drink than the more fruity hefeweizens. Could drink this all day - summer, spring, or fall. One of those beers you always should have on hand.",Bayerische Staatsbrauerei Weihenstephan,Germany,Hefeweizen,98
252,731,Offa,4.58,"This is an incredible hefeweizen and almost a paradigmatic example of the German style.  This is cloudy gold with a huge, dense white head that lasts until the end.  The aroma is full of honey and pears with elements of grain.  The taste is crisp, sweet before leaving a dryish but smooth finish, with wheat, biscuit and vague fruit qualities that transforms to a clear bubble gum finish, almost minty, a little bitter, with some grain and fruit.",Bayerische Staatsbrauerei Weihenstephan,Germany,Hefeweizen,98
252,731,robbyc1,4.5,"Beautiful fluffy head poured from this 500ml bottle, very hazy yellow orange as a hefe should be.  Smell is distinct banana's with esthers abounding. Some clove, some applish, very nice.  Wheatish malt with a great flavor, hops minimal, not overly sweet or dry, just right.  Full bodied with just right carbonation, this is a perfect choice of this type, lovely.  Drinkable all day long, especially in the summer, a great beer to keep around.",Bayerische Staatsbrauerei Weihenstephan,Germany,Hefeweizen,98
252,731,prototypic,4.27,"Appearance: It's very hazy and golden in color. You can see through it, but it's certainly cloudy. No evidence of any sediment. Very thick, three finger foamy white head sits on top was slow to dissipate. Speckles of lace remained.  Smell: There's an initial blast of banana, clove, and other secondary herbal spices. It blends with a strong yeasty-breadlike aroma. A nice, fresh grassy and earthy smell lies at the core and really permeates the nose. It's slow to emerge but provides a nice foundation for the beer. There are very faint malt and hop scents present. It's an exemplary smell for the style.  Taste: Banana and clove spices attack the palate and are immediately followed by a healthy dose of yeast. It's a nice blend and creates a very refreshing flavor. It is grassy and earthy. Very similar to nicely done wheat ale. There's a lemony citrus flavor present that is not noticeable in smell. When coupled with the light caramel malt, it makes for a nice sweet element. It's lightly hopped and has an ever so slight bitter bite to it. Toward the end, the yeasty flavor really sticks out and clings to the palate.  Mouthfeel/Drinkability: It's light bodied and extremely drinkable. Carbonation is just right and its low abv heightens drinkability. It's warm here at the moment and this is perfect. I could drink this all day (and night) during the warmer seasons.  This is a very good beer and is a great representation of the style. Perhaps it's the benchmark. It's the best Hefe I've had to date. Generally, it's not one of my favorite styles. But, I learned tonight that a well done Hefe is a very fine beer. Definitely recommended.",Bayerische Staatsbrauerei Weihenstephan,Germany,Hefeweizen,98

S - sweet, a good mixture of aromas  T - good mix of flavors, fruity, strong wheat flavor  M - compared to other reviews the carbonation seemed very low to what other people have experienced, made it much more enjoyable for me. Rather soft I would say.  D - could definitely continue drinking this throughout the day, not too heavy, the ABV hit me pretty hard but I'm also just getting into beer so that is probably why. Very, very excellent beer, though my experience with it out of the bottle hasn't been the greatest compared to other HWs  Served on-tap",Bayerische Staatsbrauerei Weihenstephan,Germany,Hefeweizen,98

A little darker than your average HW; that's by no means a bad thing.  Big banana/yeast estery presence with a fair amount of butterscotch. Slight to moderate coriander tones with a little bitter lemon/orange zest.  Nice, viscous butterscotch/caramel hit from front to back. With mild banana it gives off a banana split tone without the strawberry and fudge! Very clean with slight zesty, wheaty bitterness.  More warming than normal for style with carbonation, wheat and yeast. Nice citrus zesty pucker.  A little heavy for a HW but this is not a detriment; it's very enjoyable.",Bayerische Staatsbrauerei Weihenstephan,Germany,Hefeweizen,98

S: Citrus and tangy wheat with sweetness as the dominating smell.  T: Bold and forward with complex, tangy wheat flavor and delicious fruitiness of apricot, pear, banana, clove, and soft cinnamon.  M: Very full-bodied and coats like no other hefe. Carbonation is high but in line for a wheat beer. Soft wheat/malt aftertaste.  D: A most excellent wheat beer that sets the standards for hefeweizens everywhere.",Bayerische Staatsbrauerei Weihenstephan,Germany,Hefeweizen,98
252,731,jeonseh,4.02,"Had this on tap and poured into a pint glass at Legends of Notre Dame on 4/18/08.  A -looks just like a Hefe should as it was orange mixed in with dark gold, bronze, and dark amber. Was cloudy and definitely had a haze to it as well that let barely any light shine through. Had a nice creamy, white head that sat on tap but left minimal lacing.  S - big whiffs of banana, orange and clove come off. The banana and clove really seem to pop and give this beer its big nose.  T - The biggest initial flavor really seemed to be bubblegum to me. There was a hint of banana that shined through as well and this seemed mixed with clove and a hint of lemon citrus. Was well balanced as no one flavor really seemed to dominate the flavor profile.  MF - lots of carbonation in this one that helps to make the citrus flavors really pop. Also, get a mouthfull of a yeasty, bready feeling that just makes your mouth really feel full. The only downside for me was that the carbonation was so unrelenting that it became hard to notice anything else. Because of this, there was a lot of tingling left in the mouth after drinking.  D - overall, one of the great session beers as it has a lot of flavor for the style. The one downside though for this beer was that the carbonation was so unrelenting that I didn't really feel like having another one. That really hurt the drinkability for me as despite everything else going on, I would really wait to have another.",Bayerische Staatsbrauerei Weihenstephan,Germany,Hefeweizen,98

Appearance - Yellow orange color, cloudy, 2 finger head which kept all the way down the glass. Some lacing.  Smell - The nose on this beer was surprisingly very neutral, and crisp. Malty dryness, a slight note of citrus.  Taste - Very balanced. Notes of sweetness evened out with a touch of tanginess and very subtle bitterness. The aftertaste was even, consistent, almost neutral. Did not have the overly strong notes of banana or fruit like some other weiss beers I've had. Which is what I absolutely loved about this beer. Very well crafted. The wonderful evenness made it seem like a fine champagne.  Mouthfeel - A good light heartiness to it. Round and perfect.  Drinkability - The most drinkable Hefeweiss that I've encountered. Not overly filling. I would say even people who are not fans of Hefeweiss beers would admit that this is delicious.",Bayerische Staatsbrauerei Weihenstephan,Germany,Hefeweizen,98

Earthy at the begining of the sip, the lemon and sweet flavor comes out through the aftertaste. The spices(especially clove) and yeast dominates the palate. The body is sharp from the carbonation but smooth and creamy in feel. Bitterness from hops is light but nice as it lingers and increases through the session.

Mouthfeel is creamy and semi-thick for a Hefeweizen, with a peppery bite and a smooth, refreshing finish. I was quite impressed with this one, and I will definately be having it again at some point (hopefully on-tap next time).",Bayerische Staatsbrauerei Weihenstephan,Germany,Hefeweizen,98
252,731,jdoncbus,3.97,"#2467 on bottle  Pours a cloudy amber-gold with a two-fingerhead. Decent lacing with a lot of carbonation.  The nose is yeast, wheat, & lemon. Grainy after with a nice dose of of a peppery/clove hopiness.  Very crisp on the palate. A sour-honeycomb flavor that blends well with the yeast & wheat breadiness. You get a little pop of spicey hop that leaves the mouth a bit dry.  This one went well with the sausage, portabellas, peppers,and asparagus I was shoveling down for lunch. I am trying to sample and appreciate more hefeweizens and German brews. A vey solid beer and will bring some down for the old man who digs his Deutsch suds.",Bayerische Staatsbrauerei Weihenstephan,Germany,Hefeweizen,98
252,731,ClashmoreMike,4.4,"Had this one in a pint glass.  Appearance: Beautiful cloudy orange color. More than two fingers of off-white, solid head. Plenty of carbonation bubbles. Head slowly goes down to a thin layer than remains throughout. No real lacing.  Smell: Ripe bananas and cream; clove; sweetness.  Taste: Pretty much just like the smell. Bananas and clove (with clove more prominent). Slight cigar kind of after taste. A little bit of bitterness. A nice sweetness arises as the beer warms up a bit.  Mouthfeel: Nice carbonation - not overwhelming at all. Light to medium body. Fairly smooth.  Drinkability: This is a very solid and very drinkable beer. Very refreshing. Can't wait to drink this beer in the Summer.",Bayerische Staatsbrauerei Weihenstephan,Germany,Hefeweizen,98
252,731,WJVII,4.05,This beer poured a cloudy golden yellow with a decent amount of haziness. There was a nice thick 2 inch head that lasted throughout the pour. The cloudiness was expected in this hefe weiss. There was a mild sweet smell with hints of spice and some banana and other citrus notes. My lips were met with a nice frothy head and the taste was sweet and earthy. Very evident flavor of banana and a nice wheat flavor. This is a good beer and with the years of experience this brewery has I see why they have lasted so long.,Bayerische Staatsbrauerei Weihenstephan,Germany,Hefeweizen,98
252,731,atrus138,4.23,"Poured this into my weizen glass from a 12 oz bottle that informs me that this was brewed under the Purity Law of 1516, which is reassuring. Color is a very light amber color with a massive fluffy white head. Smell is very zesty. There is a huge spice presence here of clove. Aroma is also quite lemony. Taste delivers on the spiciness and fruitiness, though I detected some banana and wheat. Nice and crisp. Mouthfeel is perfect. Medium body with peppy carbonation complements the flavor perfectly. Tasty and easily sessionable.",Bayerische Staatsbrauerei Weihenstephan,Germany,Hefeweizen,98
252,731,Mudpuppet,4.48,"A- Poured from a 20oz bottle into a tall Weiss glass. Pours a hazy straw yellow with a nice 1"" head.  S- Nice Belgian nose. Banana, cloves, coriander and yeast. Really nice hefe nose.  T- Wheaty, yeasty, and a bit fruity. This is a really tasty and refreshing beer. This beer is also a little spicy. Really gives it a nice contrast to the wheat and yeast flavors. Man this is great tasting.  M- This is a perfect hefeweizen. Nice and creamy with a great carbonation.  D- I will be drinking a ton of this come the summer. I wish it was warm now I would be sitting on my balcony drinking this and watch the 'C' line pass by.",Bayerische Staatsbrauerei Weihenstephan,Germany,Hefeweizen,98
252,731,clayrock81,4.15,"Poured this into my hefe glass and received a nice cloudy, orange body that was very dense with a one-finger head that slowly faded and left minor lacings. Note: yeast sediments in bottle so shake bottom part, I did a tad but there were tiny particles in the bottom of my glass. A very yeasty and citrusy smell, with a pinch of earthiness and sweetness. I can't really place any of them directly, but there in the aroma when you take a nice whiff and drinking out of a hefe glass you'll smell every time you take a sip. This is a very acidic brew, sharp and crisp. A rather heavy body that is accentuated with orange and banana fruit flavors, among others, with some clove that creates an overall impression of softness on the backbite. The softness reminded me of bubblegum or something, because it was a tad sweet. In fact, the beer was a little slick going down. Overall, not only is this a great hefe and a great session beer, but it is complex and not just overly fruity or overly sweet like other wheats.",Bayerische Staatsbrauerei Weihenstephan,Germany,Hefeweizen,98
252,731,Matty1918,4.4,"Poured a cloudy, pale honey color with a massive creamy head.  A fair amount of lacing Aroma was of wheat and citrus.  A great tasting wheat beer where you can really taste the wheat....has a earthy taste. Alot of carbonation and a hint of citrus possible lemon.  This is one of the best wheat beers I've had. Great tasting.",Bayerische Staatsbrauerei Weihenstephan,Germany,Hefeweizen,98
252,731,markgugs,4.5,"poured from a 500mL bottle into a tall tulip weiss glass (consumed: 2/14/08)  A: Pours a gorgeous hazy, tawny, gold, with a huge rocky white head, which in turn seems to last forever & a day. I think I could take a nap on this beer's head. Throughout the beer, it leaves behind huge chunks of lacing that remind me of the Archipelegos.  S: Yeast is right there in your face, lots of cloves, bubblegum and a slight tart lemony scent are all present too. Some nice fresh-baked bread brings it all together, this is an amazing smelling beer.  T/M: Sweetness hits the tip of the tongue immediately, but not cloyingly so. Followed by a very creamy, almost buttery body and some nice citric bite. Loads of bready malt & cereal grain flavors combine with the tanginess of the wheat and lead to a enjoyably astringent finish. A delicious beer that often winds up being gulped and not sipped.  D: One of the all-time greats, probably THE wheat beer that all others are measured against. One of the most drinkable beers around.",Bayerische Staatsbrauerei Weihenstephan,Germany,Hefeweizen,98
252,731,hwwty4,4.28,Poured a 16.9oz bottle into a Chimay chalice. Pours a hazy golden straw with a big billowing head that subsided into thin layer of white bubbles. Aroma is big on the banana with vanilla and a slightly grassy aroma. Taste is much the same with banana being the spotlighted flavor. Also there is a slight salty tinge to the finish of the beer. Mouthfeel is full with because of the lack of filtering. Wheat beers are about the most drinkable beer style in my opinion. There is absolutely nothing better on a hot day then drinking a cold Hefe. Very tasty stuff.,Bayerische Staatsbrauerei Weihenstephan,Germany,Hefeweizen,98
252,731,CrellMoset,4.73,"Poured out of a 12 oz bottle into a typical pint glass - all my tall glasses were unfortunately dirty.  Appearance was beautiful, pale, cloudy golden yellow, with a pretty head with moderate retention and thick sheets of runny lacing. Such a refreshing looking beer.  Smell is crisp and bright, wheat notes dominate, with lemon peel and yeast notes present. Very nice, though not outstanding.  Taste, on the other hand, is outstanding. Excellently balanced, with a very noticeable flavor progression. Wheat starts it off with a very earthy, spicy kick. Beer is mildly bitter and mildly tart, and alcohol is present but works well in harmony with everything else. Lemon is present in the aftertaste. Just a really earthy, tasty, and surprisingly complex beer (for a hefeweizen) - blows me away every time.  Mouthfeel is light and crisp and refreshing, carbonation works wonders in conjunction with the flavor profile. Covers the whole mouth in a creamy, glorious blanket. Delicious.  Drinkability is as good as you can get. This beer isn't too sweet, isn't too bitter, isn't too tart, isn't too fruity, and isn't too alcoholic - it's a perfect balance of every good aspect of a good beer, the shining example of the style, and a true all-around classic.",Bayerische Staatsbrauerei Weihenstephan,Germany,Hefeweizen,98
252,731,ABCJiugui,4.55,"poured from 1pint.9 floz bottle into the brewery's eponymous hefe glass.  A- Beautiful. Slow pour reveals hazy golden straw with visible carbonation activity from bottom to top, voluminous 4-5 finger head, consistent and tight small foam bubbles, recedes slowly over the course of drinking to 1/2 finger head retention to the bottom of the glass. Spotty lacing at best- second bottle in a different glass resulted in better lacing. Overall, simply a beautiful beer to look at in a weizen glass.  S- Banana, damp sweet hay, vanilla, smell of sweet cream and nutty browned butter even! Mild fruits throughout the smell, a little citric as well, wonderful aroma.  T- Banana, vanilla again, hops are not strong- perhaps just enough tannin? to be slightly astringent, contributing to a drier finish than one would expect with these kinds of aromas. Sweetness (malts?) is mild but very welcome and excellently balanced. Flavor reminded me of sweet cream butter. Slight tang from citic component, but that may just be the smell coming back in.  M- SOOO smooth and SOOOO creamy. The foam of the head is soooo soft in the mouth, almost fluffy. Like a thin, foamed creme anglaise almost in the mouth, with similar classic flavors. The carbonation is perfectly complementary, not too harsh, but present enough to provide lightness and refreshing lift.  Overall, this beer is amazing. Had mine with a steamed whole tilapia, cantonese styled. Went wonderfully- brought out more of the fruity components of the beer and balanced so well with the delicate steamed fish. A classic beer on so many levels, no wonder why every other weiss is attempting to use this as the benchmark!",Bayerische Staatsbrauerei Weihenstephan,Germany,Hefeweizen,98

Smell is fruity, with bananas and lemon dominating the aromas. The taste starts with bananas, quickly giving way to a spicy clove flavor. One of my biggest complaints with wheat beers is a rosemary flavor that just doesn't seem to work well in beer. This one has none of that. Just the nice spicy flavors of a premium cigar. It ends crisp, with good carbonation, and some lemon peel to say goodbye.  As it warms, the bitter flavors come out more. This isn't always a bad thing, but can hurt drinkability as the alcohol becomes more noticable.  Solid, solid beer. From the oldest brewery in the world, no less.",Bayerische Staatsbrauerei Weihenstephan,Germany,Hefeweizen,98

I am, unfortunately, not as eloquent as my fellow hefe lovers, but I can say that I have been privilege enought to drink hefe and kristal weizen all over Germany, and this as good or better than any I have ever drank.  I would recommend this beer to anyone.",Bayerische Staatsbrauerei Weihenstephan,Germany,Hefeweizen,98
252,731,LetsGoQuakers,4.88,Far and away the best Hefeweizen I have had to date. Maintains the sweetness taste of a wheat beer but has much more of a stronger beer feel. Perfect for someone who wants a strong wheat beer but doesn't want to lose the taste.  Has the same foggy appearance of a wheat beer and mouthfeel. But goes down smoother and with much more of a beer after taste rather than the wicked sweet after taste of some other wheat beers.  I am a true beliere in Hefeweuzens and other wheat beers and I can safely say this is the best bottled one I have had short of actually Bavaria.,Bayerische Staatsbrauerei Weihenstephan,Germany,Hefeweizen,98

A- WICKED cloudy... 2 BIG fingers of head... light honey in color with lemon hints... sporadic lacing  S- Delicious nose... Banana dominates along with the wheat malt. Apple says hello as well.... fig? Yeast as well  T- Wheat malt is very clean and dominant... banana sticks around for the entire ride. The flavor doesn't kick you in the face, but it's pretty freakin smooth.

Creamy smooth. Drinkability: All night long. Return engagement planned.  A very nice beer.

252,731,KingPuuChuu,4.13,"Amazing.  When I first started drinking Hefe's, I never knew that there were beers like this. Poured into one of my Thinkgeek ""Insert Beer"" pint glasses, and was a lovely caramel. Extremely hazy, with a slight head to it. The head left a nice lace on the inside of the glass, while the beer itself was very drinkable. It left a pleasant feel on the tounge, and felt very refreshing.  As for the flavor, there are heavy hints of citrus, along with some herbal hints. The after taste comes off slightly bitter, but not in a bad way, and as mentioned in prior comments, the aftertaste tends to differ between the hoppiness and a citrus ting. The initial sip does take you by surprise, but as you enjoy the beer, it does get easier to drink, I could see myself drinking these during the summer.",Bayerische Staatsbrauerei Weihenstephan,Germany,Hefeweizen,98
252,731,Rudgers73,4.84,"Poured into my Witte tumbler. Looks much like a typical hefeweizen, but the head is incredibly retentive. It domes over the top of the glass but does not spill over the side. As it slowly falls, it leaves huge dish-bubble lacing. The beer itself is a deep honey shade with consistent, small bubbles of carbonation rising throughout. The smell is great. It smells really fresh, not that kind of cardboard, bland aroma that some hefeweizens get. Yeast smells similar to Franziskaner, very round and slightly Belgian-like, but with it's own bready funk, rather than a Belgian banana funk.  Wow. I didn't know there were hefeweizens that tasted like this. It has an awesome bready malt that combines with the yeast to create an almost vanilla bean character. It is so full of flavor and rich. The citrus is way towards the end with just a quick lemon zest snap. It moves from a full, thick, chewy mouthfeel to a lighter and more crisp finish. Slight hop bitterness fights with the citrus to provide a slightly different finish from sip to sip. This is the most well balanced hefeweizen I've tried so far. There is enough going on that there isn't that dull, waxy overtone that makes you sick of drinking it. I am impressed by this beer.",Bayerische Staatsbrauerei Weihenstephan,Germany,Hefeweizen,98
252,731,Monkeyknife,4.35,"Poured from a bottle a hazy straw color with a frothy white head and a healthy amount of lacing.  Aroma is both sweet and spicy with plenty of clove, cinnamon, lemon, and wheat.  Tastes of bananas, bubblegum, yeast, clove, and lemon.  Lighter mouthfeel with a good zing to the carbonation.  A very drinkable and very enjoyable hefeweizen. I can't wait to have a few of these out on the patio this summer.",Bayerische Staatsbrauerei Weihenstephan,Germany,Hefeweizen,98
252,731,jenbys2001,4.18,"This beer poured a deep golden color with a gorgeous thick head that dissipated quickly but left some lacing on the sides of the glass. It has a pronounced spicy flavor with hints of grapes and cinnamon. Clove and ginger are also noticeable. Compared to other Hefeweizens it is a little heavier with a thick mouthfeel and a sharper hop flavor. Fantastic layered taste with a spicy kick that stands out above the fruit notes. Interesting, delicious example of a well made Hefeweizen.",Bayerische Staatsbrauerei Weihenstephan,Germany,Hefeweizen,98

S: Sweet clean and creamy orange and lemon peel with sweet clove and wheat. Bit of vanilla in there, just warm and clean and fantastic. Smells so fresh and clean.  T/MF: Smooth and creamy mouthfeel backed by a good deal of prickly carbonation. Again there is a beautiful interplay between orange, clove and yeasty funk, very very fruity but balanced out by a taste of wheat and cream, pretty long finish that leaves a taste of mellow cinnamon on the tongue.  D: Really a great and clean drinking beer, no matter what time of year, be it the middle of summer of 10 below (which it is now) this a a beer that should be handily enjoyed.

The beer was golden with plenty of cloudieness formed a nice head and left good lace. Smell was a little bit of fresh bread and banana. Taste was remenicent of banana and clove. The beer was very carbonated one of the more refreshing brews I have had. Drinkability well lets just say I could go for a hot summer day good company a barbeque and about four of these 16oz bottles.

252,731,katan,3.85,"Undated 16.9 oz bottle - total rewrite as I found that I actually had reviewed the kristalweizen version last time. It was copied to its appropriate location.  A - Pours a true to color golden look with a strong haze from the unfiltered nature of the beer. Light carbonation is apparent which results in a very light film of and light hazing.  S - A bready and spicy yeast backbone is the strongest smell here. Very true to the hefe style where yeast owns.  T - Starts with a muted malt backbone with just enough bitterness to bring it into balance. Mid stream is not all that potent of a flavor, I am surprised at the smoothness of the overall flavor profile of the beer. A sweet and spicy finish to the beer. Very refreshing.  M - Strong carbonation makes this beer just explode in your mouth. Beyond that, it is very full bodied which is right in line for my desire in a hefe.  D - Very easy drinking and refreshing. Light ABV makes it sessionable. Now I may be colored by the fact that I just returned from a 25 mile bike ride, but I can think of no more refreshing summer beer. The only knock here is that perhaps the sweetness would begin to wear on me.",Bayerische Staatsbrauerei Weihenstephan,Germany,Hefeweizen,98

Cloves, banana, almost a bit of a floral arrangement going on. That lightest hints of citrus, a bit more on the orange side. Beautiful.  T: The banana flavour stands out for me often with this hefe, in a way I haven't found from others yet. Sweet, but not overboard. Hints of bubblegum, a little bitterness of hops, and lemon peel citrus.  M: I love the way this drink feels. Not overly carbonated at all, somewhat dry, very refreshing  D: Exceptionally high.

Giant taste matches the aromas, great creaminess on the mouthfeel, drinability is an absolute pleasure. The worlds oldest brewery has set the absolute standard in my book. I know ""5's"" are rare, but as hefe's go, this is it.. Just came back to my old review after so long, but really an exceptionally made Weizen.

Smell - 4.5 Extremely spicy while the head is settling, then weakens leaving a smooth, soft, semi-sweet aroma of clove, lemon, mixed spices, slight banana.  Taste - 4.5 Now this is an easy drinker! Starts with sweet wheat malt, nutmeg, clove and a hint of lemon and bubblegum. Finishes with a light, crisp bitterness, and quite dry. Aftertaste is soft, sweet (but not over-sweet), nutty and slightly alcoholic and leaves the mouth feeling refreshed. Delicious!  Mouthfeel - 4.5 Oh so silky smooth.

At $6.99 it is too expensive here, but still stands as decent value thanks to the fine quality. It can be found as cheaply as $4.25 in the city, which I think is really a steal.

Nice head that dissipates after a minute or so.  Lemon scent with a hint of canned corn smell.  The taste is not as good as I think that it was going to be. Strong canned corn taste. Everyone makes so much out of this beer but I have to say I am quite disappointed.  With so many good reviews for this beer I have my suspicions about the place I got the beer.  I had two of these and both tasted off. Sorry to disagree with the others. All I have to say is that if you are interested in this beer, don't try it at the Tap Room in NYC.

S: Big yeast scent up front.Bannanna which weirds me about because I hate them but love Hefs.  T: Bannana and clover are here as expected. Almost a vanilla hint at the end. Wheat fills in the middle nicely.  M: Great. Carbonation is perfect and it loves being on my tounge.  D: This one is dangerous.

Pumpkin, hay and wheat are present as well. Fruity malt flavor with plenty of spice. Vanilla pudding like notes along with pumpkin. The aftertaste reveals abit of hops again with a spiced character but it does not last long. Medium body, somewhat wheaty and dry. Residual sugars are present. Pretty good drinkability.

A great appearance with a nice frothy head coupled with a terrific taste makes this a classic hefe weizen. Without a doubt, one of the best I've ever sampled, this blows the competition away with its strong, pronounced wheat/citrus flavor that is complex and unforgettable. The first time I've tried this, and I will definitely get another sixer...

Poured into one of my Franziskaner Weissbier glasses (wetted before the pour).  Looks great, orangey coloured cloudy body, huge head, bubbles arising, just like a good hefeweiss should.  The aroma is also huge, vanilla, bananas and toffee apples, very impressive.  The taste is full of different flavours all trying to get out, with the same three as the smell winning the battle. Vanilla ice cream and Banoffi pie but without the sweetness the idea suggests.  The mouthfeel is full and lingers, this is a well crafted beer.  I think I have reviewed over 20 weissbiers on this site so far and this is by far the best ( I have also drank many, many others before joining, the statement stays the same).

Wheat and lemon balance out this hefe. The taste is a good balance and makes for an easy drinking, very refreshing beer that's perfect for summer.  m: Good carbonation, smooth, and light.  d: This is not my favorite beer and I am not a huge fan of Hefeweizens, but for me this is THE hefeweizen by which all others are judged. The perfect example of the style.",Bayerische Staatsbrauerei Weihenstephan,Germany,Hefeweizen,98

S: Bread-like, the yeast and wheat show through and play with hints of banana and clove. I get this weird sensation of peanut butter when the lot mix, could be just me.  T: Sweet wheat and light touches of banana, much less than in Weihenstephaner Dunkel Weiss. Very slight bitter, only apparent in the aftertaste. I love this style. Nothing extreme, very smooth and full of flavor.  M: Full bodied, with an agreeable amount of carbonation. The bottle was a little over chilled at first, but the flavors and the feel got so much better as it warmed slightly.  D: So smooth and full of flavor, very appropriate for the fall.

S - First smell is banana smell combined with sweet malt.  T - Starts off slightly sweet, fades to the banana like flavor, which is replaced with a tingle of CO2 on the tongue.  M - Carbonation makes this feel full bodied.  D - While sweet, not cloying Two or three of these sound like a nice idea, thanks.

Soft wheat aroma with yeast and cloves, maybe some bubble gum. Tart, almost lemony-smelling. Light-to-medium body. Taste was very much like the smell. Definitely a weizen but a little more subdued and less yeasty than many. Good mouthfeel though less creamy than expected. The drinkability, however, is among the all-time greats.  One of the better versions of the style, and the benchmark I compare others against.

Taste is a good wheat base that is enhanced by what seems to be a perfect balance of clove on the sides of the palate and banana toward the front with a nice touch of citrius. Feels clean, good carbonation, great aftertaste. Not too light, not too heavy. This is the benchmark hefe that all others should be compared too.

Aroma is strong and wheaty, with a strong citrus overtone - but the latter may have come from the obligatory lemon wedge. Flavor is rich, typical of a wheat beer but mouth-filling - no ""thin"" feeling whatsoever. I got a strong hint of citrus, but again this may have been due to the lemon wedge in the beer.

Anyhow this presents itself with a picture perfect three inch bright white head, with a golden orange body, which is hazier than most other hefes.  The aromas I detect are white pepper, a slight perfume aroma, and a kind of cedar smoke fragrance.  This tastes more like blood orange and honey, with a little hint of banana. There is a little peppery taste here too.  By far this is the standard of hefe weizens. This is a true pleasure to enjoy.",Bayerische Staatsbrauerei Weihenstephan,Germany,Hefeweizen,98

The taste was first dominated by citrus, then mild apple and spice as it gets warmer; reminded me of an almost cider-taste. Finally subtle vanilla and alchol finish out the taste. The semi-sweet start fades into a slightly bitter/sour feel due to the carbonation, but was still pleasant. It unfortuantely didn't leave as long an aftertase as I had hoped.

Sweet bready yeast and some clove linger long after the sip. Taste is very light.  M- Wonderful light, smooth, and creamy body based on yeast. Light carbonation accompanies this.  D- This is a classic example of a hefe. It has everything that should be found in one and keeps it all in balance without anything extra added.

I know there's no bananas or pumpkins in the ingredients but somehow these wheat beers tend to get that type of smell. Very slight earthy aroma, too. It tastes quite like how it smells but better... and with no unpleasant aftertaste. Perfect carbonation. Easy to drink. God damn...

This is the standard for this style. Rock solid and a job well done.  Taste: Malty and crisp with flavor. Banana and clove are right there in the forefront. Cherry-like sweet/tartness that is underlying. The sugar content is perfect. Awesome beer.  Mouthfeel: Again, perfect sugar and enough carbonation to make this the perfect summer sipper. A tingle of carbonation hits you and then the well balanced body comes forth. Alcohol is present.  Drinkability: Perfect here. This beer begs to be consumed en masse.

252,731,xare,1.76,"I had heard so much about Weihenstephaner that I bought the only style available that I could find in my area and that was the Hefe Weissbier kind. It was a mistake on my part as apparently I do not like this beer.  Poured the beer had a lovely gold color and the head was huge so I was looking forward to drinking this beer. Honestly, the appearance is amazing.  Then I smelled the beer and it actually turned my stomach. I'll give it another chance someday but perhaps I may just have gotten a bad bottle. It has an aroma similar to a overhopped gin bouquet.  Taste has a wheat-orangish lemonish flavor to it. The wheat is overpowering and I definitely didn't enjoy tasting it as I wasn't able to taste very much of the subtler undertones.  The mouthfeel was pretty smooth but the taste and smell both overpowered the mouthfeel so that's why I rated it so low on the mouthfeel as well.  Overall, it was pretty hard for me to drink this beer and I ended up having to pour it down the drain. Such a waste of a beer that's probably exceptional for everybody else.",Bayerische Staatsbrauerei Weihenstephan,Germany,Hefeweizen,98

252,731,Grundle20,5,Appearance: The beer pours a hazy golden straw color with an ample sticky white head. The retention is superb as is the lacing.  Smell: There's a rich aroma of banana and cloves from the yeast and just the right touch of tartness from the wheat.  Taste and Mouthfeel: The beer drinks smooth and full and is completely rife with an amalgamation of flavors that is best described as banana nut bread. Up front you get the sweet ripe banana notes which then meld in to more of a yeasty bread character and is then finally smoothed out in to a crisp cashew finish. Absolutely delicious.  Drinkability: It's too tasty to be anything but highly drinkable. It's really one of the most perfect drinking beers in existence in my opinion.  Bottom Line: I guess you learn a few tricks when you've been brewing the same beer for 500 years because this beer really is perfection when you get a nice fresh bottle of it like the one I reviewed today.,Bayerische Staatsbrauerei Weihenstephan,Germany,Hefeweizen,98

It has all that you would expect in there just more of it. Lemon, over ripe banana, and clove dominate. The yeastiness is there giving it an almost sour dough type quality.  M: Light and sparkling like a good wheat beer should be.  D: Uber drinkable.  Overall: I have had this one more times than I can count on my fingers and toes.

Great light hoppiness at the back, with the sweet wheat. Full body, creamy, nice fizzy feel on the fairly strong carbonation. I just loved this one.

I like that the fruits are not overpowering in this beer, yet complement each other perfectly.  M- Mouth feel is very carbonated and light.

D- One of the best wheat beers I have tried so far, intoxicatingly drinkable and very light.",Bayerische Staatsbrauerei Weihenstephan,Germany,Hefeweizen,98
252,731,TheodorHerzl,4.57,"Served on tap at the Rathskeller in Indianapolis.  A: Poured a beautiful hazy golden hue S: Sweet banana and yeast T: Perfect for outdoor drinking malty and sweet with a back finish of hops and slight banana flavoring. M: Again, perfect on a late summer night. Low carbonation, sweetness and smooth and not heavy. D: I would drink this everytime I get a chance. Wonderful showcase of a Hefe the way it should be made.  I had two last night, one with lemon on my glass and the other without. I preferred to not have the lemon, but every bar seems to like to add one to anything with Hefe in the name.",Bayerische Staatsbrauerei Weihenstephan,Germany,Hefeweizen,98
252,731,TheManiacalOne,4.85,"Poured from a 16.9oz bottle into a weizen glass.  A: The beer is a light amber color with a large white head that fades at a decent rate and leaves a thick lace on the glass.  S: The aroma is full of wheat and banana, along with spice, light malts and some hops.  T: The taste is sweet and bready with strong flavors of wheat, banana & spices. Its simple and straight-forward, but done very well. The malt character is light but hearty and theres a mild hops presence. The after-taste is slightly sweet.  M: Very crisp and very smooth, light-to-medium body, medium carbonation, very clean finish.  D: Very tasty, goes down extremely easily, not very filling, decent kick, excellent representation of style, this beer has everything that you look for in a Hefe Weizen and it doesnt need anything above that. I could drink this beer all night long and enjoy every bit of it.",Bayerische Staatsbrauerei Weihenstephan,Germany,Hefeweizen,98
252,731,mdagnew,4.3,"500ml bottle bought from Tesco...  Poured a hazy golden yellow colour... White head poured typically big thick and foamy then faded slowly to nice thick layer ... lots of carbonation rises to the surface... decent amount of thick sticky lacing...  Aroma - Good clove spiciness, light vanilla notes, noticeable wheat, quite bready, very little malts, light fruitiness (banana, lemons and some light lime), quite peppery, faint ginger spiciness, some hay traces...  Taste  Light biscuity malts, faint bubblegum traces mixed with clove, definite breadiness, good fruitiness (lemon, grapefruit and some faint pear notes), salty traces, some floral honey sweetness, grassy and peppery hints, no real hops....  Feel - Fairly smooth with a little bite underneath... light body... Extremely refreshing and drinkable...  Overall - A top notch German hefe - one of the best out there in my opinion..",Bayerische Staatsbrauerei Weihenstephan,Germany,Hefeweizen,98
252,731,MICAMD,4.35,"A- A fairly cloudy yellow liquid. A thick white head forms with excellent retention that leaves excellent lacing.  S- Sweet banana and clove with some wheat smell. Not too strong, but very appealing.  T- Awesome. Same as the aroma. A little bit spicy and bready as well. Impressive and well done.  M- Just about right. A bit creamy and smooth. Goes down very well. Not cloying or drying by any means. Very well balanced.  D- A very enjoyable beer. This would make a great session beer. I was really impressed with how smooth and flavorful this was.",Bayerische Staatsbrauerei Weihenstephan,Germany,Hefeweizen,98
252,731,Stimack,4.47,"This brew poured to a cloudy golden color with a nice sized white head that had nice retention and left a fair amount of lacing down the side of the glass. The aroma is fresh and remind of malt, clove slight banana, and some citrus scents. The taste is very smooth, citrus comes to mind very quickly, lemon I suppose. Some strong banana flavors present as well as well as clove. Very refreshing flavor which goes great during the warmer weather. Overall possibly my favorite hefe that I have had to date.",Bayerische Staatsbrauerei Weihenstephan,Germany,Hefeweizen,98
252,731,meechum,4.38,Had this with my meal at PF Chang's at Mall of Ga. I had a very spicy chicken dish with white rice and this was the perfect compliment to the meal in my opinion.  A - Served in pint glass. Very cloudy and straw blonde with fluffy head that fell back slowly with sticky lacing  S - Had the notable hefe hallmark bannana smell to it with just a touch of the hops and a little clove smell (not very much)  T/M - The taste was just wonderful as it cut the spice of the food with a sweetness from the beer and the mouthfeel with it's creamy presence helped to balance out the burn on the tounge from the hot chicken  D - This was a very drinkable beer..I could see spending several pints getting to know it very well..and like I said it goes well with spicy chineese food,Bayerische Staatsbrauerei Weihenstephan,Germany,Hefeweizen,98

S - Banana, clove, a slight spice, the slightest hint of bubblegum and a touch of hay.  T - Banana, clove, spicy pepper, hint of lemon and a bready (maybe tart) wheat taste. Slight sweetness upfront with a dry finish.  M - Light and refreshing with a dry finish leaving me wanting another sip.  D - An excellent beer that is mighty tasty on a hot humid day.",Bayerische Staatsbrauerei Weihenstephan,Germany,Hefeweizen,98
252,731,KevPet84,4.85,"The overall impression of this beer is that it is what all hefe-weizen should be compared to. That said the balance with malts and the aroma and bitterness leaves you refreshed and wanting more of it.  The appearance is a slightly golden yellow, with a great head that stands at least 2 fingers deep and leaves a fine lace that clings to the sides of the glass.  The smell reminds me of a bannanas and spice. The aroma has a slight citris sent in the background.  The taste is what gets you. Bannana and clove, with a little mellow citrus. It keeps unfolding as you drink more. the balance of sweetness and bittnerness with the clove and citrus leave you asking what is the third and maybe fourth flavor that plays a role in the complexity. I don't know, but I'll keep drinking till I get it.  The mouthfeel is what I love about his beer. It is not the lightest that I have had, but still a refreshing coating that it leaves. It is over all a light-medium mouthfeel in my book,  The drinkablility is what the previous has said. One of the most drinkable beers out there. It is complex, refreshing, and light enough to go with many foods and hold up on it's own as a session beer (though it would be a pricy session). Drink more of it and you will not regret it.",Bayerische Staatsbrauerei Weihenstephan,Germany,Hefeweizen,98
252,731,RedChrome,4.43,"Cloudy body was a combination of yellow and orange colors. Pillow like pure white head was three inches and took a few minutes to settle. In the light loads of carbonation can be seen. Sticky thick lace rings.  Very sweet light banana aroma. Quickly overtaking the nose, the cloves popped strongly. There is a very faint bubble gum sugary powder aroma. Light astringent scent in the finish.  Sweet malty taste up front brings bananas, lemons, and a light grape flavor as the fruit blend. A very subdued clove note is hidden in the back of the flavor. Hops are extremely gentle at the very end of each sip.  Thick enough to fill the mouth, but consistency helps this one go down smooth. Nice carbonation push on the front of the tongue.  An excellent beer. Pair this with a nice piece of smoked salmon. As evidenced by how long they have been at it, this is a wonderful choice for anyone who likes beer. Hope they keep this up for another nine hundred and sixty-seven years.",Bayerische Staatsbrauerei Weihenstephan,Germany,Hefeweizen,98
252,731,genog,4.33,"Poured into a weizen glass a light orange color. The color tapers off dark to light from top to bottom. The head is white like a cloud that billows up to the top of the glass if you are not too careful. Smell is cloves, spices, coriander, banana, orange peel, very vast in aroma. Taste is a very light and refresing with the spices and banana. Wheat like flavors dance around too. Mouthfeel is crisp, and refreshing. Only recently have I begun to appreciate wheat beers. This is a great one.",Bayerische Staatsbrauerei Weihenstephan,Germany,Hefeweizen,98
252,731,akorsak,4.5,"A 500 mL capped bottle.  A: The weizen exploded with carbonation, creating a three plus finger head in the glass and two overflows in the bottle. The thick bubbles slowly recede, providing a bitter buffer between my mouth and the beer. The ale itself is a slightly hazy yellow color, a goldenrod shade.  S: The nose is intoxicating, with light clove and banana notes, hints of (but not too much) bubblegum sweetness and even some caramel.  T: The esters have receded from the forefront of the taste, allowing an unusual grain bill to emerge. The wheat provides a drier body without the tartness that it is known to bring. The longer that the ale sits in the mouth, the more the flavor takes on a sweet, Belgian-esque candi sugar sweetness (please note that I would never, EVER suggest that the beer has any cand sugars in it). It tastes as if the esters have pushed past bubblegum, clove and banana to a new caramel sweet realm. Intrguing to say the least.  M: The mouthfeel is drier with some month under its belt, creating a sweet flavor that leaves the tastebuds begging for more.  D: New or old, this is a great beer. Some aging (just a few months, mind you) have given the beer a greater depth at the sacrifice of the traditional weizen characteristics. I like this, but it is far superior fresh.",Bayerische Staatsbrauerei Weihenstephan,Germany,Hefeweizen,98
252,731,HotterThanHell,5,"Recently bought this at AJ's here in Phoenix but also had it last year at Weihenstephan on tap. One of the top 5 breweries on the planet and and simply put, a top 2 hefewiesse (along with Schneiderweisse).  The aroma is beautifully dominated with cloves with hints of other spices dancing through you nose hairs. I tend to sniff it for a good 4-5 minutes to let it warm slightly before drinking it down.  A nice white head on top of straw/light brown body that is a bit murky because they leave all the good flavorable shit in the beer.  Mouthfeel is medium bodied with multiple flavors cascading around your tongue.  The taste is true hefeweisse and should be the STANDARD. If you know little about this style and are looking for the beer by which all others can be compared, this is the one. Ungespundet will be brewing their soon, so if the quality falters, you will know who to e-mail.  Prosit and see ya in Munich in October!",Bayerische Staatsbrauerei Weihenstephan,Germany,Hefeweizen,98
252,731,Halcyondays,3.71,"12 oz. bottle, from the oldest brewery in the world,  A: Hazy, cloudy orange, with a thick, beautiful white head, very expansive.  S: Smells mostly of bubblegum, big bubblegum notes, some banana, and a hint of cloves.  T: Bubblegum and banana abound, very estery, cloves back the flavor at the end of a drink, a classic weizen taste.  M: Smooth, spritzy, highly carbonated.  D: A good German weissebier, easily available, and refreshing during the spring and summer months.",Bayerische Staatsbrauerei Weihenstephan,Germany,Hefeweizen,98
252,731,Slatetank,4.8,"Served in a standard pint with a lemon on the side.  A - I chose to discard the lemon and get the full effect of the beer on it's own. A cloudy apricot colored ale with a fluffy white head that creates plenty of lace.  S - Wondrous scents of banana and clove w/ light pepper and gentle scent of wheat.  M - Effervescent lively mouthfeel. Light and easy drinking wheat creamy feel. Nutty and slight spice in the semi-dry finish.  T - A well made Hefe, I must say right from the start. Great flavors of wheat and yeast up-front. Citrus and pepper flavors are swirled in with the yeast taste. A nice mildly sweet and creamy wheat flavor gets all wrapped up with Bavarian yeast flavor. Nice tropical fruit and citrus accents until the light pepper floats over the tongue in the finish.  D - The drinkability is stellar and so much flavor in the session strength of the unfiltered wheat ale. This is perfect for the summer, but I would drink this year-round. I consider this a premier example of the style. Great quaffability.",Bayerische Staatsbrauerei Weihenstephan,Germany,Hefeweizen,98
252,731,seanyfo,5,"This is my second review of this beer, vom fass at the Weihenstephan outlet in Berlin, at Hackesher Markt.  A: Cloudy amber colour, withlively beading and yeast sediment throughout the glass. Fantastic head, 3 fingers and sustained, lacing is also good.  S: Strong esters of banana and cloves, stereotypical of the style. Slight hints of vanila come through aswell.  T: Typical weizen taste. Strong flavours of banana, and maybe some peaches. finish is smooth and creamy with moderate carbonation, not as watery as others. Slight hint of vanilla on the aftertaste. But it is so well balanced, better than the UK on tap offerings, which i felt had a very medicinal quality in the aftertaste.  M: Refreshing with moderate carbonation, smooth.Not watery and overcarbonated at all as i have found in other big name weizens  D: This is world class! The amazing fresh summery weizen flavours with a superbly comfortable refreshing carbonation and the long linger creamy afterflavours, make this the perfect hefe-weizen!",Bayerische Staatsbrauerei Weihenstephan,Germany,Hefeweizen,98

252,731,montageman,4.65,"Poured into a Weizen glass.  A: Very cloudy yellow with an incredible bone white head that goes nowhere fast and leaves a lot of lacing when it finally goes away.  S: Banana, clove, citrus - basically everything a wheat beer should smell like. Very nice.  T: Heavy citrus up front followed by some banana and clove with a finish that is crisp and on point with a touch of sour apple.  M: A little thin - maybe a little more carbonation? Not bad, though.  D: All night long. Great tasting stuff. Easily the finest wheat beer I've had the pleasure of tasting. Highest recommendation.",Bayerische Staatsbrauerei Weihenstephan,Germany,Hefeweizen,98

252,731,gpcollen1,4.8,"Pours a gorgeous hazy golden color into my Weihenstephaner Hefe glass. Head rises over the rim a mighty 3 inches tall in total and slowly slinks back down. A cold sweat envelopes the glass as it sits for a few minutes on the counter.  Aromas are slightly sweet with wafts of banana, citrus, and mild bublegum. Taste follows that up tenfold as it livens up my tongue. A little bit of fizz and spice and rivers of citrusy sweet wheat roll over my tongu ushering in hints of clove and spice.  Well this one is undoubtedly the best thing to come home to, next to the kids hanging on my legs. Crisp an drefreshing and a few make a wonderful meal. Almost a perfect 5.",Bayerische Staatsbrauerei Weihenstephan,Germany,Hefeweizen,98
252,731,whiplash3825,4.74,"Poured into a weitzen glass, the appearance is your typical hefe... straw colored, prototypically cloudy with a nice three to four-finger head. I do miss the chunks of yeast which float about in my usual Franziskaner however.  Smell is primo, with the phenols and esthers combining into a near perfect harmony of ""citrus""y flavors. After 20+ years of drinking this style I still don't get the bananna though.  Taste is excellent, and the thing that makes this hefe-weizen exceptional is the perfect balance of flavors. No one flavor overpowers the others, and the finish is dry and bright, making you want ""just one more"".  Mouthfeel is typical of the style... perfectly carbonated.  Drinkability is off the charts... there's just no beer (IMO) that goes down as easy as a hefeweizen, and everything that makes a hefe so great is evident in this beer, but in spades.  Even I was hooked by the mystique of this beer being supposedly the best of it's kind, so I was expecting more. (Especially since it's twice as expensive as my usual German hefe) However, it's definately the best I've had, although not twice as good as my other favorite German hefe.

Pours a hazy yeast laden golden. The entire glass fills with big carbonation bubbles that speed to the creamy bright white head that forms on the pour. Leaves moderate lacing after each sip. A very nice looking hefe.  The smell is 100% hefe. The benchmark for others. Green bananas have a big spot in the aroma with clove coming in a close second, very spicy. Possibly some white pepper. Solid wheat twang backbone with a drop or two of lemon juice. Smells great.  Flavor is spot on with the aroma. The banana is leaning more toward banana bread as opposed to green bananas. Clove with a twangy wheat backdrop and the lemon shows again..  Lighter bodied with a highly carbonated creamy mouthfeel. Very thirst quenching.  On a warm summer day like today this is about one of the easiest drinkers to find. Thirst quenching and enjoyable.  To me Weihenstephaner is the pinnacle all other hefes try and reach.

Taste - A fantastic balance of spice and fruit, particularly banana flavours. Amazing complexity for a wheat beer.  Mouthfeel - Very good texture and carbonation.  Drinkability - It's very hard to imagine a beer being more drinkable than this. Who knows how many I'd stop at, but remember the bottles are almost a pint, so a six pack would get you rather drunk.  Overall - Excellent. I've never tried anything quite like this. On a list of ""Beers you must try before you die"", this would have to be very close to the top.",Bayerische Staatsbrauerei Weihenstephan,Germany,Hefeweizen,98

I may detect some more sprightly sweetness than just the wheat, perhaps a touch of citric zest.  Flavor is mild, creamy, delicious. Big yeast flavors with that lemon background, clove spicing is delicately managed. Crisp carbonation and just enough balancing hops keep everything in check. Finish is biscuity and maybe a little nutty.  Body is thin, a little bit of watery character that is par for the course with a beer this fruity, flavorful, and quenching. This is the perfect example of a hefeweizen that I would return to again and again.",Bayerische Staatsbrauerei Weihenstephan,Germany,Hefeweizen,98

There are strong banana and citrus scents. It's very sweet smelling, with a very subtle smokey like hint lingering in the background.  This had an interesting taste, not like some of the other hefe's I've had. It started off with a citrusy burn on the front of the tongue, while the back of the tongue harvest a carbonation fizzle. It had a soft banana flavor, and it was also slightly nutty. Complex, but still one coherent taste.  This was very light, a perfect summer sipper. I could have a bunch if I had some more!

The white foam lays atop a gorgeous, hazy organic unfiltered apple juice-colored body. OK lacing, good retention.  The definitive weizen aroma: bananas and cloves. Very appetizing on this hot night.  This beer is extremely mellow. Every flavor blends immaculately with the next. Soft banana and clove flavors meet honey, lemongrass, very subtle hops, a faint hint of pear skin, a bubblegummy note, cereal grains. Deeper than your average hefe.  This beer has a nice crisp finish despite the cloudiness. Great balance, ample carbonation, mellow and sweet flavors, and low alcohol make for an insanely drinkable beer. Nice and refreshing.

Can smell the wheat, also citrus, lemony, some sweet corn. Very pleasant. Nicely surprised by the taste. I usually find wheats too watery, or lacking overall character. This one bucked that trend.

Aroma is classic German hefe but heavier with rich banana esters coming immediately to the front. Hiding behind that is a slight farmhouse sourness. The mouthfeel is not as immediately heavy as the nose would lead you to believe, but it lingers on the back of your tongue like butter, maybe diacetyls. The esters dominate the taste with a citrus and spice note. Overall one of the better hefeweissbiers I have had.",Bayerische Staatsbrauerei Weihenstephan,Germany,Hefeweizen,98
252,731,Nesued,4.6,"Appearance - Golden color with a slight haze. An ample white head that forms upon pour. A lively carbonation keeps feeding the head that resolves after a few minutes to a half-finger remain. Note the beer's color, carbonation, head and its retention. Is it clear or cloudy? Does it look lackluster and dull or alive and inviting?  Smell - Malty sweet aroma with a bit of a grassy presence as well. A bit of a yeasty nose as well.  Taste - For a hefe, this is one of the more dense one's I've tasted. I would almost compare this with even a Belgian strong dark ale, it's that rich of a body. Very smooth with a dry finish. Very well balanced with just a bit of a hop bite at the end.  Mouthfeel - The lively carbonation helps move this beer around very well, making it feel alot more dense than I've come to expect from hefe's. Maybe I need to taste more hefes!!  Drinkability - This was a very nice representation of the style. The complexity is head and shoulders above many beers that dare to put a Hefeweissen label.

Awesome appearance with its huge billowy head and semi-cloudy body. Smell is soft and pleasant with apricot, a touch of gum, and wheat. The yeast doesn't overpower the flavor but is rather mixed with the wheat. There's some clove, fruit, and a subtle spice. Very smooth going down, and easily quaffable.

252,731,maddogruss,3.63,"Had this in a 750 mL bottle at the Cloverleaf Tavern. Had a dark, orange-amber body with a white head. Pretty quick retention overall but it slowed to a very nice lacing that stuck with the beer. The smell was a little malty and fruitty; banana esters were fairly present. A very nice, smooth taste with banaa esters very present. A fairly fruitty taste overall that was quite refreshing. A decent, full-bodied beer; nothing too thick and quite refreshing. As a fan of Hefe Weizen's, this is one of my favorites. I could drink this all day long. The brewery has been around since 1040 and they have been following the clean brewing rule of 1532 or something to that nature, which gives it a bit of history and, to me, enhances the beer overall. Solid beer and highly recommended.",Bayerische Staatsbrauerei Weihenstephan,Germany,Hefeweizen,98
252,731,gmcfarre,4.2,"Poured from 1pt .9oz bottle into Franziskaner Weissbier glass  A - Pours a gorgeous hazy straw color with a proper 2 inch head that gets slightly rocky as it fades into memory. Head stays at about 1/4 inch with moderate lacing.  S - Very nice banana and clove scents with clever wheat malt (of course). Tart apple and added spice give this a very pleasant nose, and for perhaps the first time I can actually pick out the bubblegum scent in a weissbier.  T - Starts off with a nice bubblegum and banana taste that transitions to the wheat malt body of the beer. Unfortunately, things get less interesting at this point, as the body gets a little too watery for my tastes. Finish consists of a slightly bitter and tart mouthcoating effect.  M - Moderate carbonation for the style kicks things off, with a watery and smooth middle and drying finish.  D - Not quite the godsend that I had anticipated, but still a top-tier german hefe weizen. Will certainly revisit in the future and if I can find it I will certainly be tempted to indulge on a summer day. Alcohol is hardly noticeable in taste or effect, making this an easy drinking beer.",Bayerische Staatsbrauerei Weihenstephan,Germany,Hefeweizen,98

Earthy wheat smell with hint of bananas/citrus though not as strong as many other hefe's. Taste is great, light carbonation leads to a slightly creamy feel (slightly being the key word). Light to medium mouthfeel leaves you wanting another taste. Goes down easily.

Deutschland Uber Alles!",Bayerische Staatsbrauerei Weihenstephan,Germany,Hefeweizen,98
252,731,biegaman,4.5,"Weihenstephaner Hefeweissbier has the colour of grapefruit skin and a beaming, summery complexion. Its golden radiance is etched over with a natural haze that results from the high protein content of wheat and leaving the beer unfiltered; curiously, it hardly obstructs visibility and its shine is unceasing. Bubbles are constantly in motion. Its head is feathery and fluffy and its lacing gooey and gunky.  The aroma is ambrosial and appetizing, a well-spiced yeasty concoction that is jammed packed to the brim with clove-like phenols and fruity esters. It has a light airiness to it, gently titillating the senses while savory spices hover and banana esters flutter. There is a hint of citrusy tartness, herbs, freshly baked bread and plenty of luscious vanilla. It's a vanilla-banana split!  Weihenstephaner would not have succeeded as the world's oldest brewery if it didn't make tasty beers. This weissbier is likely to be among (if not, the) most flavourful weizen you'll ever taste. It has an untypically high dosage of vanilla, a drop of lemony citrus, a teaspoon of honey, nutty pastry, fresh baked bread sprinkled in zesty spices and savory herbs.  I really can't think of a more refreshing beer. I don't know that there is anything else I'd prefer on hot, sunny days. The beer is gratifyingly refreshing and loaded with full-bodied flavour. It has effervescence and substance. It has a spritzy carbonation but is also remarkably fluffy and creamy. The light peppery spice, the subtle herbal quality and the full-on fruitiness all blend wonderfully.  I say the following with full disclaimer that it may just be my own opinion: Weihenstephaner Hefe-Weissbier is the best wheat beer. Ever. I'm not normally one to make claims like that and I generally don't believe that such an assessment can truly be made. However, this beer is so wonderfully formulated that I still can't help but hold it as the benchmark for every other wheat beer.",Bayerische Staatsbrauerei Weihenstephan,Germany,Hefeweizen,98

This one was described as ""widely considered the best hefe weizen in the world."" Let's find out.  The appearance of this lovey Hefeweissbier which was served in proper glassware, a tall, hour glass shaped glass with the name and coat of arms design adorning it, was cloudy with a golden yellow hue. There was some lace that draped the glass, but no more than what would be expected for the style.  The aroma is light, but I could discern notes of cirtusy fruit such as oranges and nectarines and even lemon zest. Oddly, there was evidence of vanilla as well.  The taste is as fruity as the aroma, but in a subtle way, Very citrusy and crisp and so clean in the finish.  The mouthfeel is a crisp, citrusy delight as the brew hugs the tongue for a flash then finishes clean and refreshing like a good hefe should.  This is a solid hefe weizen that marries well with the hot spring/summer of Atlanta. Worth the investment.",Bayerische Staatsbrauerei Weihenstephan,Germany,Hefeweizen,98

Color is a golden yellow with notable cloudiness and visible yeast in the bottom of the bottle (poured into the glass, of course). Head is very big, slightly sticky, and white. No lemon added.  Smells of ground wheat with whisps of banana odor and a very slight ester.  Taste starts out with a strong wheat and fades to a more malty flavor, with evident elements of citrus, banana, and cloves.  Mouthfeel is medium weight with lots of carbonation as expected in this type, and a nice smoothness at the end. The initial ""hit"" of the carbonation and wheat is very refreshing, and the barley notes ensure a finish that's not too harsh.  Many say that this (and other hefeweizens) is a beer for the hot summer afternoon. I could drink it all day, all year round. Absolutely delicious; light but flavorful. By far the best of its breed.",Bayerische Staatsbrauerei Weihenstephan,Germany,Hefeweizen,98

I have edited my overall score at a slightly higher rating. ---  Poured into a 25oz mug.  This beer pours a cloudy pale orange, with a foamy white head.  You do smell some wheat and slight lemony zest.  The taste is very crisp with a nice carbonated attack. No bitterness at all, I definatley taste some cloves and a slight lemon twist.  Mouthfeel is very refreashing and balanced. Good enough carbonation to tingle the tongue, with 0 bitterness in the back of the mouth.  I could drink this all day.

I can taste good yeast and wheat flavours along with clove and some fruits...banana and apricot. There's some sourness there as well, most notable up front after a few more sips. The finish is pretty strong on the clove and I'm loving it. The body is medium as is the carbonation. Very, very drinkable. I'll have to see if I can pick some up the next time I get to Colorado.

T: Very well-rounded in terms of flavor, a subtle wheat and pale malt intro leads into a bubblegum-esque middle. Following that is a light hoppiness that dries out for a great finish.  M: Not too carbonated, which was nice, but maybe a little more couldn't hurt. Overall, still maintains a creamy texture and nice body.  D: A really relaxed summer style beer with great drinkability.

Off this head sprang lovely banana and dough aromas. The first taste was sparkly banana with clovey counterbalance. I had this too cold at first so it was a bit steely or metallic but as it warmed up it became more balanced and the mouthfeel was less crisp and a little sticky but still dry.

I've had a fair variety in Germany, trying every one I've come across, and while Weihenstephaner impresses me, it's not the definitive beer of its style.  Appearance is appropriate - dull yellow-gold body with a dense, smooth head and low-moderate carbonation. Lacing is very nice. As for smell, the strongest one that comes across at any temperature is an acrid lemon aroma, probably due to the yeast. Banana is also evident - bouquet is not overly complex compared to comparable Hefeweizens.  Taste: Satisfying but again, not as complex as some others - some of my favourites are Maisel's and Schneider. Banana is present but not over the top, and a slight bitterness of hop is extremely refreshing. If only it were summer!  I'm not trying to say this is a bad beer. It is of an extremely high standard, and mouthfeel and drinkability are both very pleasing. It is never cloying, and is an appropriate drink on a cold or a warm night.

At first, it smelled of ripe pears and cloves; as the beer warmed, ripe banana notes became more prominent. The taste was a complex blend of the fruits and spices from the nose and the strong yeasty backbone I expect from this style. The carbonation was a little more prickly than I am used to, but it gave a great, rocky head that lasted quite a while. Quite a drinkable beer.  Sadly, this bottle was a bit past its prime, which is hard to avoid with Hefeweizen. Some cardboard flavors showed up once the beer warmed.

Smells is very wheaty and yeasty, with bits of lemon and spice.  Taste is very good, thick wheat beer up front, with a good dose of Belgian yeast. Slight lemon also in the flavor, with a subtly bitter grassy hop finish. Quite sweet, but also well balanced.  Mouthfeel is good, creamy with the perfect amount of carbonation.  Drinkability is good too. Very light and refreshing, a nice change.  Overall, this was my first hefe weizen, and I am impressed.

252,731,hunteraw,4.28,"Received from mymrnngjckt in the Secret Bunny '07 exchange.  Appearance: Poured into a weizen glass, hazy gold with a ridiculous head - rocky and great retention (billows of carbonation streaming from the bottom of the glass maintain it). Sheets of lace. Appearance is perfect for the style.  Smell: Complex! Reminiscent of a tripel, really, in its complexity and spiciness. As far as typical hefeweizen aromas go, less bubble gum and banana, more clove. Crisp-smelling, not overdone.  Taste: A little less thrilling than the appearance and aroma. Spice, yeast, doughy malts. Banana and bubblegum are mild. Makes it more balanced, less ""heavy"" than many hefeweizens. Almost citrus-like acidity, but certainly not a ""sour"" beer. Not a trace of alcohol.  Mouthfeel: Very creamy, light-medium body, carbonation seemed high in the glass but works fine in the mouth.  Drinkability: High! Not surprising to see it rated so highly. Easily sessionable.",Bayerische Staatsbrauerei Weihenstephan,Germany,Hefeweizen,98

Golden honey-colored with a little haze and great carbonation.  S: Served a little cold, so the smell was a bit subtle. Yeasty bread and light lemon aromas, with a hint of clove.  T: Flavor is filled with wheat, clove & a touch of banana. Very crisp herbal hoppiness and delicious malty sweetness.  M: Crisp and refreshing... body is medium to light. Mouthfeel and body are clean and fresh. Carbonation is moderate, deserving of a belch or two afterwards...  D: Terrific flavors and very easy to drink...a simple and straightforward hefeweizen without any notable flaws.

Banana and clove esters are also present. Very slight floral hop aroma.  T: Very much like the smell. Raw with hints of lemon in the aftertaste. Delicious yeast character. Cracker like malt remains steady throughout and holds everything together. Clove and banana flavors are well integrated. Finishes dry.  M: Light and prickly. Medium to high level of carbonation is perfect for this style. Very well done.  D: Highly drinkable and very refreshing. I imagine this would pair very well with a variety of foods.

252,731,atsprings,3.72,"Served at Flying Saucer in a regular pint glass with a lemon wedge. The beer possessed no head when it arrived at the table, likely killed by the lemon juice. The aroma was somewhat alive with wheat and spices. The taste was what I would expect for a hefe, nothing special. The beer was moderately carbonated and rather drinkable, but I expected better from an authentic German brewer.",Bayerische Staatsbrauerei Weihenstephan,Germany,Hefeweizen,98

The aroma is rich, heavy with yeasty banana aromas, cloves, and esters.  Tastes like it smells, only with piles of wheat adding to the rich spiciness and fruit. It feels substantial without being treacly; absolutely perfect. As for drinkability, I could put away ten bombers and still be craving more.  There are no tastes or smells that distinguish Weihenstephaner from any other Hefe, it's just that it takes everything that ever other Hefeweizen does and does it about a million times better. A perfect example of a tasty style.",Bayerische Staatsbrauerei Weihenstephan,Germany,Hefeweizen,98
252,731,travelfrog,4.63,"Many years ago, I visited this ""oldest brewery in the world"" in Freising, Bavaria. The hefeweizen was definitely my favorite of their brews; indeed one of my favorite brews. More recently, I had this beverage on tap served in a traditional weissbier glass.  Appearance was just about perfect. Golden-cloudy with a magnificent crown. It looked like one of those mock-ups you might see in an advertisement.  Aroma was excellent, cloves and yeast with a hint of vanilla.  Flavor was also excellent. Vanilla and yeast, without the annoying sweetness of many beers of this variety.  Mouthfeel was full-bodied and smooth. No complaints here.  Drinkability was oustanding. A full-flavored beer that is also thirst-quenching. Be careful not to drink it too quickly! ;)",Bayerische Staatsbrauerei Weihenstephan,Germany,Hefeweizen,98
252,731,umustdrink,4.32,A - Sediment collects in the center of the glass and slowly descends. After a few swirls the beer is a cloudy dark orange color. Head is a brilliant white which settles at an eighth inch. Lacing is average.  S - Sweet yeast dominates the smell in the form of bananas and cloves.  T - Light spicy malt taste complimented with sweet yeast.  M - Carbonation starts out at an uncomfortably elevated level but thankfully it fades to a more acceptable level after only 5 minutes. Consistency is medium.  D - Very nice representation of the style and truly one of the best.,Bayerische Staatsbrauerei Weihenstephan,Germany,Hefeweizen,98

Hopefully a hint of things to come with clove, underlying yellow fruit, and yeast. Nectar of the gods.  Not shorted here either as the clove comes through as imagined with a slight comingling of sweet and dry.  Almost hate to swallow as the esters, phenols and other chemical reactions carom off of each other. Nice treat.  Very enjoyable to drink.

Aroma is of clove with hints of banana. The taste is much the same, a wonderful melody of clove and banana with a touch of sweet malt. The mouthfeel is full and creamy, yet light, crisp and satisfying. An excellent hefe, and why not?

Aroma is of wheat, clove, and is quite fruity and pleasant. Flavor is rich and spicy and quite good. Mouthfeel is a bit thin.

252,731,InsolublePancake,4.13,"I liked my experience with Schneider Weisse so much that I went out and got another Hefeweizen.  A- Hazy straw with a touch of reddish-orange, topped by about an inch of head. Looks like a sunset in a glass! Isn't that cute.  S- Ooh, yeasty! Ripe bananas and lemon drop candy in the nose along with a hint of spice.  T- Pretty sour upfront with a lemony tartness. In fact, the tartness pretty much dominates the whole taste. Just a hint of the characteristic banana and clove phenols are evident in the middle. Wheat and a touch of hop bitterness on the finish. Pleasant aftertaste.  M- Very carbonated, but it suits the beer well. Extremely crisp.  D- Quite high. This is a good one to quaff on hot days.  Good beer for sure. Unlike the Schneider Weisse, however, this one is much better suited to the summer. Its tartness makes it very refreshing. Not my favorite Hefe, but still very enjoyable.

Smells and tastes of banana, malt, a hint of cloves and that nice tart wheat aroma. Medium-bodied and extremely well-balanced. Mouthfeel is like music in my mouth.  It is a notch above the other wheat beers with regard to the usual weissen characteristics.

This came as a 5 pack of 16.9 oz brown bottles... and the slot for the sixth beer was taken by a special 0.5 litre glass (how sweet is THAT!).  I poured it into it's own glass... (proper glassware!) Man, I should have taken a picture! The frothy off-white head rose a full half inch above the rim of the glass and slowly settled down. The nice cloudy weissebier appearance was perfect.  The smell was typical of a weissebier, only moreso. Bananas, citrus, bubblegum sweetness all wonderfully apparent.  Taste: NICE! Very creamy and smooth. A very nice hefeweissen. Notes of banana and a breadiness that contributed to the creamy texture.  Mouthfeel was again nice and creamy.... no hoppy bite and a very clean finish. This beer leaves an aftertaste like a flowery, honey sweetness.

252,731,mjc410,4.67,"I've had a number of 5 dL bottles that were very difficult to keep in their glass, but this particular bottle, even with a shake and a hard pour at the end, refused to raise more than a two finger head (which is quite long-lived, nonetheless). The head is a creamy tan-white, and leaves wide bands of lacing, particularly at the uppermost reaches of the liquid. The body is a hazy yellow-gold with amber highlights. The nose has big banana tones, but even stronger clove notes. The taste is very much like a banana bread with cloves tossed in (not as strong as in the nose) , with perhaps some Nilla wafers for good measure (the pudding association might be having an effect on me). A bit of light breadiness, too. The taste lingers, and has a bit of pepper in it. Phenomenal. It's head and shoulders above any hefe-weizen that I've crossed paths with. The mouth is fairly light, with fine but tingly carbonation. A fantastic beer. It can be overdone, perhaps, since I bought an entire case early in my beer advocacy and grew tired of it, but a year and a half later I'm thinking about another case in spite of myself.",Bayerische Staatsbrauerei Weihenstephan,Germany,Hefeweizen,98
252,731,jmalex,4.29,"On the night of the first significant snowfall in the Northeast U.S., I take myself back 6 months to the hot summer with a thirst-quenching hefeweizen. Ok, I can dream, can't I? I just don't want to wait until June to really enjoy a great beer such as this one. Time to drink up!  APPEARANCE: Nice hazy, golden color - exactly what it should be. A modest head forms after a careful pour and dissipates into a solid white cap which lasts indefinitely. Small tight bubbles cascade up the glass, disappearing into the pillowy cap above.  SMELL: Yeasty and spiced with hints of lemon and, vaguely, banana. I'm somewhat surprised at the breadiness of this one.  TASTE: An initial blast of wheat gives way to some wonderful clove and lemon flavors. The finish is exceptional with the flavors suddenly floating away and leaving a clean and refreshing aftertaste that is bitter at first, but then becomes sweet. This beer just begs you to take another sip. The morphing and melding of flavors makes this beer into an experience for sure. Edit: As the beer warms slightly, a distinct hop presence becomes noticeable in both the smell and taste. It doesn't change my scores at all, but adds yet another layer of complexity to this fine beer.  MOUTHFEEL: Fantastic. Smooth with perfect carbonation and finishes amazingly. Done absolutely perfect.  DRINKABILITY: Wonderfully refreshing and goes down like it was nothing. I'm almost done this one, and I really wish I had another. Don't buy just one!  On a hot day, this is the ideal beer. I can just imagine sitting back on the deck with a few a these and enjoying everything about the summer months. Instead I'm jolted back into reality, looking out the window at the falling snow and sleet of February. No matter. For 20 minutes, at least, I was kicking back in a summer paradise.",Bayerische Staatsbrauerei Weihenstephan,Germany,Hefeweizen,98

Nose of firm coriander/clove spice, well-balanced and not ""in your face."" A bit of banana and bread as well. Tastes of subdued, well-integrated coriander/clove spice, a bit of wheat/bready yeast. A tiny bit of alcohol at the end. A well-balanced hefe. Mouth is pleasantly smooth, semi-viscous, and light. Drinkability is high: this beer is tasty, smooth, and enjoyable.

It's light-bodied, but there's so many different flavors in it. It is extremely yeasty and malty. This is exactly what a world class beer should taste like.  M - Slightly bubbly, light on body, long on taste and flavor, perfect.  D - If you've never had this before, you'll swear you could drink 15 pints of this after your first sip.

The head settles to about a quarter inch coating. The beer itself is nice and cloudy and a deep yellow/orange.  Smell: Sweet and syrupy, with hints of bananas and oranges.  Taste: A little bit of carbonation bite upfront, backed by a nice wheat tang and flavors of bananas and citrus. Yeasty and bready. Ever so slight bitterness in the finish.

Smell: Big banana bread sweetness, yeastiness, a hint of clove, ctirus spiciness.  Taste: My first problem was I couldn't focus because I took a deep sip and then just kept drinking. Yeastiness, a fresh baked quality, the banana in the nose, then a lemony citrus hit, puckering, lightly hopped, finishes super dry with a little spiciness.  Mouthfeel: Smooth carbonation and makes it super easy to drink, cleansing, dry, tingling in the finish. It just disappears.  Drinkability: This beer is just delicious.

Smell revealed hints of banana, which were fleeting, but also an almost metal-like aroma. Not unpleasant at all. Taste was well balanced with little hops but a fruity, almost playful character. Mouthfeel was fantastic, perfect amount of carbonation that fizzed up on your tongue after each sip, and an almost chewy texture.

Banana, but not overwhelmingly, more subtle. Next a touch of clovey spice dances across the tongue, carried by the bubbles popping...leaves a slightly spicy finish, very refreshing.

Since it was a smaller bottle into a giant glass, I did a ""normal pour"", so half of the volume of the glass was foam (that was my intention). Therefore, the cloudy yellow amber color supported an extra thick off white head that holds well. It settles unevenly, giving it a smooth cloudy appearance. Solid layered lacing along the glass with spots of spots.  Smooth creamy aroma with banana and some sharp clove.  Crisp wheat malts with a creamy banana bread flavor. A light leafy presence hangs in the background. A little bit of citrus comes in here and there. Medium bodied and sharp on the palate from the carbonation. The finish is clean with maybe a little bit of lingering malt.  A good crisp wheat ale from Germany.

252,731,pmatz2,4.45,"Got this one one from a friend, and wasn't expecting much as I'm not typically a fan of this style  Weihenstephaner Hefeweissbier pours into a hazy dark golden bod. Not much carbonation to talk about Not much lacing. I was surprised by the smell was expecting lots of cloves (which I hate) and was surprised by the strong scent of bananas and a very subtle spice aroma. Taste is wheat but not over powering there was the right balance of Malt and hops . I found the Mouthfeel to be a little thin, but not unpleasant. Not being a fan of this style I was impress.

252,731,Westsidethreat,4.03,"A: Served tall in my Weihenstephaner glass. Towering snowy white head governs this beer, leaving lacey goodness behind. The body is a dull cloudy peach with drab specular hits.  S: One sniff and its got your attention. Extremely fresh yeasty aroma, banana peel, light lemon and fresh wheat.  T: Begins lightly spicy; cloves, yeast and bit of coriander. Traditional banana flavor are apparent but not over the top. Dryer than most wheats, bit grainer, low level hops add a touch of complexity. Little vanilla and fresh grass clippings finish it out.  M: Medium body, full smooth mouthfell.  D: The flavors fell short of where I was hoping. This is on the easy drinking side of the spectrum with flavor taking a hit. Very nice beer but not my favorite German wheat.",Bayerische Staatsbrauerei Weihenstephan,Germany,Hefeweizen,98

First of all, the appearance was standard orange/brown cloudy, with a white head that dissipated a bit quicker than I expected.  Smell and taste, too, were standard for a Hefe, and the taste was a bit more pronounced than, say, Hacker Pschorr, but with a tad less banana/clove.  Mouthfeel was light, but well carbonated.

An amazing looking beer, especially in the weizen glass.  Aroma: Wheaty goodness, with spicy phenols and faint banana esters. A bit of lemon as wel.  Taste and Mouthfeel: That refreshing, tangy wheat malt is the backbone of this beer. But it wouldn't be the same without the earthy yeast flavors, the hint of clove and the subdued banana esters. The mouthfeel is somewhat light, with a sort of crispness from the carbonation.  Notes: Oh man, I could drink these all summer.

Great retention, leaving good lacing.  Smell: Wheat and yeast, almost bread-like in the nose, with vague hints of alcohol and whiffs of spice  Taste: A kind of omnipresent, prominent clove character that is not overpowering, but remains in the mouth and floats over the other flavours. Obvious bready malt character that mingles with a subtle yeast nuttiness. Gentle lemon sourness as it moves around the tongue. Very, very soft hop flavour. Aftertaste is a pleasing mix of the yeast nuttiness, wheat/barley malt, a gentler spiciness remaining with small hints of alcohol. Very soft banana-like character.

M - Frothy, viscous, the tiniest bit of harshness from carbonation, the lord of refreshment.  D - I think this bottle might have gone awry. I have this before and it was unspeakably fantastic. This time it was just excellent. I have had it many times before and will have many times again. It is sessionable, food pairable, perfect for any and all situations.

Taste: stepped up clove along with a slightly peppery spiciness; quite tart but not overly fruity; lasting moderate hop bitterness.  Mouthfeel: medium body balanced by a high level of carbonation.

This beer has a very citrusy aroma. I smell lemon and some banana. Also, I smell some spicy aroma. A slight grassy hop aroma is present also.  This beer tastes much like it smells. Very citrus fruit like. Lost of lemon and some banana. It is slightly spicy, maybe just a little clove. Some grassy hop flavor is present. Saaz hops, I think.  This beer is very crisp and refreshing. It goes down very smooth. It leaves a fruity aftertaste. It is very highly carbonated.  I think this beer would make a great session beer. It is very easy to drink, and it is low in alcohol.  Overall: I think that for the style, this beer is great.

The color is a honey/orange that is quite hazy, and extremely lively with carbonation rising from the bottom. The head retains very well, and very slowly dies down, ending up at a finger-thick cap of super creamy white head. Excellent, thick lacing all the way down.  Smell - Over-ripe cooked bananas on the nose. Some clove spice is present. Rich malt and wheat smell in the background. Some metallic alcohol smells can be picked-up on.  Taste - A smooth and balanced blend of the cooked dark bananas mixed with mellow but rich traces of wheat and malt. Again there is clove spiciness in the mix, and also some noticeable peppery character. Very little alcohol can be detected, but it's there.  Mouthfeel - A bit high on the carbonation, causing a quick bite at the first part of a taste. The body is very slick and smooth, and extremely ""wet"" in mouthfeel. Medium-bodied overall.  Drinkability - Very refreshing hefeweizen. It has good flavors and a nice mouthfeel. I could drink several in a night.  A very good hefeweizen we have here.

Taste is similar to the smell, cloves, a real nice smooth sweetness, that almost gets a 2nd wind at the end of the sip. Hints of banana in there as well. My initial impression is that this is very similar to belgian witbier's. Mouthfeel is very smooth, with a great sweetness at the end of the taste that I am really enjoying.

Taste: Bananas again and the very heavy wheat taste complete the taste.  Mouthfeel: Thicker than other hefeweizen's I've tried, and is aided by a hint of alcohol on the swallow.

Lots of delicate lemon citrusy-ness, grains, and a pinapply edge. The taste is simply incredible. It opens with a wheaty, bready cirtusness. The wheat pulls through in the middle. The finish of this beer is what really amazed me: A smooth fruityness with a citrusy twang that hangs on the mouth for 5-10 seconds afterwards. The mouthefeel is carbanoted, light, and bready, like a wheat beer should be. The drinkability is also incredible: a session beer for sure.

Banana and clove, a bit bready, wheat is definitely prevalent.  Taste- Banana bread, has a traditional 55/45 (wheat/barley) taste to it. A bit sweet at moments. Yeast gives a bit of an unrefined taste to it at times also. Hints of citrus.  Mouthfeel- Carbonation is right on for me. I wouldn't exactly call it a dry finish, but it does leave you thirsty for more.  Drinkability and other notes- This is an excellent beer- summer or not.

252,731,wl0307,4.13,"BB 21/02/2007. Served chilled in a proper, 500ml weizen glass.  A: pours a cloudy, bright orangey-yellow colour; the semi-lively carbonation supports a medium-thick white pillowy head that sustains throughout the drink. Very nice~~ S: sweet grainy and wheat-ish aroma with a touch of candyish sweetness upfront; a slightly ashy hop resins contradicts with very intense aroma of dried-mangos, sweet bananas, intensely sour-sweet fruity yeastiness, while the tinge of clove is pretty restrained at the back. The nose is richly fruity overall--not bad, but not complex enough. T: smooth, light, and effervescent textured candyish, grainy and bready malts caresses the tongue... ensued by chewy, tartly-sweet (but not thin) fruitiness of green apples, mangos and green bananas--overall the malt-sweetness is balanced by just enough sour fruity hint... the yeastiness is much softer than most hefe-weizen I've tasted, rendering a balanced profile and a soothing wheat-ish grainy sweetness lingering in the finish aided with a suitable kick of of dryish-bitter spice at the fringe. M&D: great balance, great body and creamy-fizzy texture, yet the flavour lacks some sparkles--amazingly delicious or weird edge of something... This beer is very easy to drink, enjoyable, and could hardly inflict criticisms thanks to its safe flavour profile; but the ""traditional taste"" (I imagine so) shown by this bottle doesn't give me the urge or passion to go for more than a bottle at any one time. A ""good honest"" hefe-weizen it is--not great one, alas.",Bayerische Staatsbrauerei Weihenstephan,Germany,Hefeweizen,98

Great golden coloring with a beautiful head and awesome lacing.  It's smells like my grandma's house for some reason... anyways. A great hops punch in the nose. Lots of spices and fruits. All these flavors just jumped up when I smelled. For some reason I didn't enjoy it as much as some other brews.  After I finally took a sip I wasn't very impressed for some reason. I had good flavoring and the blends of flavors really added to the experience but I still wasn't impressed by this. The hops punch it right at the beginning and it was really sweet on the tongue but something happened when I swallowed. I couldn't taste it anymore.  It has a good weight to it with a medium to full body feel but the sweetness really takes me out of the drinking experience. It still is good on the way down until I can't taste it anymore. Still one of the better brews out there but my experience was very bland.  I'll try it on tap next time.,Bayerische Staatsbrauerei Weihenstephan,Germany,Hefeweizen,98

Finish is clean, with an ever-so-slight bitterness with a long banana and bread tail.  M: Wonderfully chewy.  D: Hell yes. I could drink this all the time. It's very flavorful, not too alcoholic, and it can be either refreshing or warming: drink it at a cooler temp and it's a summer refresher, drink it a bit warmer and it's a banana bread-y comfort ale.

You can usually find Hacker-Pschorr or Paulaner Hefeweiss in my garage refrigerator while I'm working on the motorcycles getting them ready to ride as the weather starts to warm up here in the Chicagoland area. I was looking forward to trying this brew, but came away somewhat disappointed since it didn't impress me as I had hoped. Just came across as ""average"" and I expected more considering it's lofty position in the top 100 at BA. I'll surely give this one another go, but for now..  A: Typical cloudy straw yellow of a heffeweiss. More bottom sediment than I would have thought gave way to some chunky floaters. Not usual, I would think. Head was OK, but not like the wipped cream topping I usually see from my usual weiss beers. S: I couldn't really get a solid aroma from this beer. Faint clove and banana fragrance, but not like the assertive nose banquet I'm used to from Hacker-Pschorr. T: Pleasing, thirst quenching with a clean finish. Still the flavors were subdued compared to what I'm used to. Again I expected to be impressed. M: Tartness lingers on the palate. Beer is smooth and has a crispness that is enjoyable.

I have tried a number of other hefewiessen's (I was even in Bavaria a couple times as a young teen and drank some beer at that time). I also had tried some other stuff from very old breweries. I am usually not impressed - I'm more of an IPA/Stout/heavy duty kind of beer person. All this, plus a cheap price (5.99) led me to not expect too much.  I had the first one absolutely warm. It was great! Actually, I think warm is better than the 50 degree I kept them at after that. Store these cool, drink them warm. Enjoy, they are the real deal.

Smell: This is how a wheat beer should smell. Wheat malts, clove-y spices and citrus banana. Nice.  Taste: The taste is very evident in the aroma. Nice carbonated with a wheat malty backbone with notes of clove, citrus, banana and yeast. Clean and crisp, refreshing and delicious after mowing the lawn. I wish I had another.

The aftertaste had hints of fruit flavorng but not overpowering, subtle but present. The mouthfeel presented as heavy with that fruitiness present. This was shown to me by a clerk at the liqour store and I can see why. This is a good hefe weizen that has a strong flavor that does not over power the drinker.

Bannana cloves, sweetness, citrus and spice come together and produce a very appetizing smell.  The taste is just as good. Of course the sweetness is most apparent, a bit of a citrusy zing as well. One of the best features of this hefe is the mouthfeel, full and creamy with a perfect amount of carbonation, as well as an extremely refreshing taste just make this beer incredible through and through.  It's been a while since I've had one of these and it is even better than I remember. Truly one of the best, if not the best, hefe's I have ever had. Definitely worth seeking out and trying.",Bayerische Staatsbrauerei Weihenstephan,Germany,Hefeweizen,98
252,731,JerzDevl2000,4.53,"I had this on tap at the Hop Devil Grill in New York over the winter, and thought this was one of the most amazing beers I ever had. When I finally found it in bottles recently, I was very excited to try this and see if it could live up to how I remembered it. It wasn't the awe-inspiring brew I remember having on tap, but nevertheless, this is still an amazing beer and the benchmark against with all hefe's should be measured!  Very nice pour - I love the radiantly cloudy hue of this and the nearly overwhelming head. Like most hefe's, the lacing could be better, but what it lacks in that, it more than makes up in taste and mouthfeel. Banana, grass, clove, bubblegum, you name it - it's here, and it's an absolute joy to swish around. What puts it over the top is the mouthfeel. Carbonation everywhere, the taste lingers just right, but it never feels too light, forced, or tingly. Just loads of bubbles like Sierra Nevada, but no bitterness to go with it. A wonderful sense of effervescence and range of flavors are this brews hallmarks!  I felt a bit more citrus and remember the head being perfect when I had this on tap. Yes, the bottled version doesn't live up to that, but I have yet to taste a beer that was just as good in a 12 oz. serving as it was in a pint glass, right out of a freshly tapped pour. No matter - there's a great reason why this is #1 for hefe's and near the top of my list as well: The range of flavors, the enjoyingly easygoing nature of this beer, and the full mouthfeel are a deadly combination. You've been warned!",Bayerische Staatsbrauerei Weihenstephan,Germany,Hefeweizen,98
252,731,bashiba,4.15,"Poured a cloudy orange yellow with a creamy long lasting white head.  Smell is a good mix of Banana, Citrus, Clove, and some other spices.  Has a nice bit of yeasty flavor with banana, clove, Wheat and nice bit of lemony zip all making appearances.  Mouthfeel is smooth and very creamy with a nice bit of citrusy zip at the end for a crisp finish.  A very good and tasty Hefe. Fantastic session beer.",Bayerische Staatsbrauerei Weihenstephan,Germany,Hefeweizen,98
252,731,Blakaeris,4.4,"Pours cloudy light orange in color with a massive creamy white head.  Smell is bready banana nut. Mild yeasty spices.  Taste is similiar to the nose. Wonderful breadyness. Bananna and citrus fruit. Spices are sharp with clove out front and milder pepper. Finish is crisp with lingering spice.  Mouthfeel is medium bodied, smooth and creamy.  A great example of this classic style. Tasty enough that you will wonder where it went. Incredibly smooth and easy to drink. You gotta give this one a try.",Bayerische Staatsbrauerei Weihenstephan,Germany,Hefeweizen,98
252,731,Budlum,4.57,"Pours a deep, straw-yellow with copious amounts of foamy, white head. Deep oranges provided by the cloudy yeast. However, not quite as cloudy as many other hefes.  Sweet, aromatic and floral on the nose. Loaded with banana, notes of sweet clover honey and candied yams. A very enjoyable aroma.  Sweet and ""yeasty"" on the tongue. Great notes of banana, clove, bubble gum and caramelized brown sugar. Slightly nutty and earthy in the finish. The sweetness is perfectly balanced and never becomes over-bearing. As with any hefe, the yeast makes the beer and this one nails it.  Mouthfeel is perfectly balanced for a hefe. The yeast is well distributed with no dirty teeth feeling or clumps while enjoying.  Drinkability is huge. This beer is very refreshing, loaded with a constant flavor and very creamy. Possibly the perfect hefe. If there is one downfall, this beer is best consumed while still cold. It does tend to taste a little watered-down if allowed to warm too much.  A world classic representation and benchmark for the style in my opinion.",Bayerische Staatsbrauerei Weihenstephan,Germany,Hefeweizen,98
252,731,peabody,4.46,"Man, the bubbles are never stopping here. When the bottle was opened the bubbles continued to pour out of the bottle for 2 minutes. There is plenty of carbonation here but that is not what this beer is all about. Bananas and Cloves! You can smell both a little but upon first taste you are overwhelmed by the Clove. It is a clean slightly hoppy clove and banana flavor with a spicy aftertaste. Very good. I don't know about drinking multiples of this beer but I can see why it is rated so high.",Bayerische Staatsbrauerei Weihenstephan,Germany,Hefeweizen,98
252,731,DaPeculierDane,4.48,"Lightly bemired soft gilded straw with a healthy white cloud that persists till the end of the glass. Aromas are obviously German, malty, and lightly fruity. The expected attributes of banana and clove are present but very light in comparison to many others of the style. Along with them one finds lemons, spring flowers, and oranges. All is exceptionally fresh and airy. Body is light and alive with plenty of spicy yeast character. Sweet malt and fruity yeast flavors blend perfectly with a subtle hop bitterness. Finish touches on the dry end of the spectrum with a nice crispness as well. Carbonation is moderate to lively. Drinkability is flawless. This may be the perfect hefe but I do prefer mine to be a bit dirtier. This one is just too flawless.",Bayerische Staatsbrauerei Weihenstephan,Germany,Hefeweizen,98
252,731,Litterbean,4,"Pale yellow, turns to golden orange as yeast is swirled in. Big fluffy cloud-like head settles to a white bubbly cap.  Smells of crisp wheat, with the standard banana and spicy clove notes. Not very outstanding, but pleasant and to style.  Light bodied, with mild banana notes and some bubblegum. Crisp finish.  Light and refreshing with nothing out of the ordinary. Just a solid wheat beer, with some good yeasty fun.",Bayerische Staatsbrauerei Weihenstephan,Germany,Hefeweizen,98
252,731,SethB2,4.28,"Poured from a bottle into my Franziskaner Weissbier glass.  A - Beer pours a lemony yellow color, a bit cloudy with a huge amount of carbonation. I don't think this can be measured in ""fingers"". More like hands. Roughly 1.2 hand worth. Several little bubbles continue to race up to the surface. Very good.  S - Ahh, now THIS is a Hefe. Sweet clove, bananas and bubble gum. Yeasty as all hell, but that is how it is supposed to be. Not much in the hop department, other than a Noble hint here and there.  T - Bananas and clove again, but very bready. Like a sweet muffin, really. Starts candy sweet, and then the spice takes hold. Bits of clove and cinnamon and then the pepper, which I attribute to the Noble bite.  M - Excellent. Light, but at the same time it has a chewy feel. Exceptionally smooth and very drinkable. Probably the best Hefe I have sampled to date.  D - See above. Time to get some more.",Bayerische Staatsbrauerei Weihenstephan,Germany,Hefeweizen,98
252,731,sacfly,4.1,"500mL, 7066 stamped in a box on the back label, whatever that means. Pours a cloudy yellow straw color. Thick head of large off white bubbles. Aroma is of clove and banana with a hint of lemon. A little bubblegum thrown in there. Clove comes out over the others in the taste along with a sweetness. Wheat character is evident. Aftertaste is yeasty and spicy with just a touch of bitterness. Easy drinking despite the medium to heavy body (for a hefe). Definitely not the watered down versions I have been plagued with all summer.",Bayerische Staatsbrauerei Weihenstephan,Germany,Hefeweizen,98
252,731,BitteBier,4.55,"Pours a hazy orange-yellow with a couple fingers of bubbly white head that deplete to a clingy ring that hangs on through the whole glass. Particularly as the beer warms a bit, the nose is soft, clean and grainy with a pleasant bit of spice. That taste carries over nicely to the taste, which is a hefeweizen through and through. The mouthfeel has a crisp snap, but the flavors are able to shine thanks to the pleasant softness as well. I liked this beer well enough the first time around (when I suspect the bottle I had was past its prime). This time it was just what I was after.",Bayerische Staatsbrauerei Weihenstephan,Germany,Hefeweizen,98
252,731,hopsaplenty,4.27,"500ml brown bottle, 5435 on back label.  Foggy pale straw. Short, off-white head of small bubbles that settles quickly to a bit of head dust and no lacing. Ample carbonation streams race upwards. Big clove and banana peel as well as an orange-spiked with cloves aroma. Initially tingly crisp with some cloves and light bananas as well as a modest lemon pith note. The cloves gather in intensity in the early finish before giving way to a crisp hop note that lingers briefly with some lemon tartness. Light bodied with a bubbly, yet smooth mouthfeel that accentuates the clove and banana flavors. Enjoyable and a wonderful representation of the style. Refreshing on a hot, sticky St. Louis evening.",Bayerische Staatsbrauerei Weihenstephan,Germany,Hefeweizen,98
252,731,doubleipa,3.97,"Nothing like a hot summer day in Atlanta for a hefeweizen. Had this on tap, but was served in shaker pint glass. Kind of loses some of it's appeal when it's not served in a weizen glass. Anyway, nice golden color with a great aroma: banana, fruity, lemony, and clove. Good carbonation. Could drink lots of these at a sitting.",Bayerische Staatsbrauerei Weihenstephan,Germany,Hefeweizen,98
252,731,rousee,4.72,"Dark murky gold color with a nice healthy head of thick frothy foam. Head holds remarkably well--no lace to speak of.  Smell is perfect for the style. I believe these people invented the hefe-weisse. The nice thing is that there are all the familiar elements--banana, wheat, coriander, clove, etc. but they are so perfectly subtle. The taste is much the same with a hint of citrus--almost lemon zest. I did not put a lemon in this beer--further proof that one is not needed. What more can be said--this is the Hefeweizen against which all others should be compared. Extremely pleasant quenching mouthfeel and very smooth and drinkable.",Bayerische Staatsbrauerei Weihenstephan,Germany,Hefeweizen,98
252,731,vancurly,3.96,"Thick, foamy head, good three fingers depth at start, which comes back to a centimetre for the duration. Not much obvious carbonation. Nice frothy lace hangs on 'til the end. Cloudy pale amber, to a pale golden yellow at the edges. Wheat malt nose, clove - hint of lemon. With the last pour (and extra yeast), perhaps a note of honeycomb. Clove flavour dominant in the froth, but once you get through this (and on your nose), a nice wheaty, creamy mouthfeel, light, malty. Some banana, which lingers on a while, but not as estery as the Schofferhofer, imho.",Bayerische Staatsbrauerei Weihenstephan,Germany,Hefeweizen,98

Pours a hazy golden yellow with an excellent white foamy head. Lots of carbonation, light lacing. Fruity aroma of banana and apples, yeasty with hints of cloves, sweet malted wheat. Smooth, light texture, fizzy aggressive carbonation. Sweet fruity taste of banana, spicy clove and yeast. Hints of lemon zest. Extremely light bitter finish with a peppery aftertaste. All around a very balanced beer. A perfect Hefe, best I've ever had. Very refreshing and delicious.  Cheers!",Bayerische Staatsbrauerei Weihenstephan,Germany,Hefeweizen,98

As expected, it is cloudy, with a golden color.  Strong wheat aroma with a hint of fruit, possibly banana.  Rich yeast flavor with smooth, malty background. Hint of spice and fruit.  Slightly frothy, but pleasant mouthfeel.  The overall, a very drinkable beer. Nice, complex flavor. Probably the best hefe weizen I've tried so far.  As a side note, I got a kick out of the picture on one side of the gift box. It is a group of nuns laughing and drinking beer. You've gotta love Bavarian attitude. Prost!",Bayerische Staatsbrauerei Weihenstephan,Germany,Hefeweizen,98

252,731,AltBock,4.45,"I only got the little 12oz. bottle and after drinking this, I wish I had bought the big bottle. The label is just very simple and nice by having the brewery or family crest in a big white oval with a black background. The back label has the Govt. warning and a number at the bottom. I'm not sure what it means, but it's number 3076.  Appearance: When I poured it into a Weizen glass, the beer was the usual weizen color of hazy orange with the usual massive head of white foam. When it receded it left plenty of foamy rings and barely any lace around the glass. I thought it would leave tons of white sticky lace in its tracks, but it just didn't for some reason.  Smell: It smelled like a Hefe Weizen should smell like, by having a nice aroma of cloves, citrus fruits, some bananas, hint of wheat, and all of these aromas were wrapped around the yeast.  Taste: Like the smell, this beer tastes like a Hefe Weizen is supposed to taste like and it tastes like it smells too. Up front were the cloves, citrus fruits, and a minor taste of the bananas. After that came the wheat and the yeast. What more can you ask for from a Hefe Weizen?  Mouthfeel: It was very light, smooth, creamy, and with a nice amount of carbonation. I did notice a slight aftertaste of yeast, but it left so fast that it was hard to tell it was even there.  Drinkability: Like I said before, I still wish I had bought the bigger bottle of this. It was so easy to drink, that the 12oz didn't last long. If was flavorful and light, that it was hard to put down on a hot summers day. Better yet that it's very affordable and it's almost everywhere. A must try Hefe Weizen!",Bayerische Staatsbrauerei Weihenstephan,Germany,Hefeweizen,98

Smell - bananas and cloves, hint of creamy wheat. Mouthwatering.  Taste - same as the smell. Bananas and cloves with subtle creamy wheat, and even more subtle toasty malt. This is the classic, refreshing, and delicious taste of hefe-weizen. Nothing more complicated than that.  Mouthfeel - full, smooth, creamy, low carbonation.  Drinkability - this is very good, and goes down very easy.

Nice tangy wheat flavor, with more vanilla and banana in the mouth. A bit of spicy hops on the finish too. Very nice full mouthfeel that still refreshes. Definitely more on the vanilla/clove end of the spectrum, with the fruity notes being held in check.

OZ. bottle purchased at Downtown Wine & Spirits, Somerville, MA  Poured a hazy, yellow ochre with a two-finger, tight, white, foamy head that slowly faded to a clingy film. Outstanding retention. Spotty drops of lacing stuck along the glass.  The aroma was incredibly rich and smooth. Yeasty, spicy and phenolic. Sweet aromas of bubble gum and cotton candy were quite noticeable. Some wheatiness came through as well, along with a touch of smoke.  The flavor was very similar to the aroma. Lemony, citrusy and spicy (clove and allspice) up front. Semi-sweet and fruity in the center, with notes of bubblegum coming through strong. The finish was crisp, tart and ultra-clean with a lingering bubblegum aftertaste.  Mouthfeel was light, fluffy and highly effervescent initially, yet the liquid soon settled to a rich, creamy froth on the palate.  Drinkability was outstanding. I cannot think of another beer that was so crisp, clean and refreshing, and yet so full-flavored.  It is only fitting that the oldest brewery in the world produces one of the best beers in the world.

252,731,GreenWBush,4.34,"Looking through the reviews of Weihenstephaner beers, I tend to find comments like 'wonderful', 'perfect', 'simple', or admonitions that can be paraphrased as 'if they've been brewing since 1040, they must be doing something right'. I agree with all of these statements.  The hefe pours out a hazed tangerine with a placid skim and a few scant lace lines.  The nose is clearly a clove-bomb. Lime zest.  The taste is intensely delicious - and i'm not the world's hugest hefe fan. Cloves, lemon/lime interplay, and an uber-clean wheatiness are strong and floral.  Much like all Weihenstephaner beers, this is amazing on the tongue. Smooth, silky, and drinkable. The huge clover-load does limit the drinkability to a certain degree.  These beers have been inundating the Fort Wayne area, and for that I am grateful. The thought of DIPAs, Imperial Stouts, et al. are rather ridiculous in this steamy weather so these brews have been tickling me in all the right spots.",Bayerische Staatsbrauerei Weihenstephan,Germany,Hefeweizen,98

Touches of spices, numbing cloves, some soft nuts, banana, lemon. A nice spicy bitterness that sits well and gives some good balance. Ends smooth with a nice spicy character.

Tucher, Paulaner, Weihenstephaner bracketed with our homebrewed Hefeweissen ""Wheatholio""  Pours a rich golden orange with a white head and lace for the duration. Aroma from the brewpot gives stiff competition to the wonderful 12.7 °P malt so I take the weissen glass around back and stand by the hops to enjoy the ligher nuessances of phenols -4VG and esters that Weihenstephan 68 ale yeast is famous for: bananna, phenol, clove, citrus and apricot.  A standout by virtue of it near perfect balance and sublime esters and phenols. There is no dissecting this classic - all the parts fit perfectly and give you the pinnacle of the style as far as my tastes. Great beer - most drinkable!

252,731,errantnight,4,"I'm torn on this beer, and perhaps I should review it again when I've had more experience with true Hefs...  On the one hand, it has remarkable complexity, particularly as it warmed. On the other... I was overwhelmed (particularly in during the first 1/3) by the banana notes. And not in a good way.  I was not terribly impressed at first, or perhaps more accurately, I didn't particularly like it, but was impressed by its craft. The more I drank, the more I reconsidered, and towards the end I found the beer exceedingly quaffable.  I love saisons and I enjoy wheat beers in general, but the banana/clove thing turned me off a little, and then intrigued me towards the end. There's no way a beer of this depth of character, beauty, and aroma (and definitely in no way a spoiled bottle) could be rated less than ""good"" in any of these areas, but there's no way I can in a clear conscious pretend this approached the sublime to my palate.  But I will say, it has inspired me to approach the rest of the German Hefeweizen world with great interest, and I shall certainly be revisiting this beer this summer.",Bayerische Staatsbrauerei Weihenstephan,Germany,Hefeweizen,98

Taste: Spices hit first, clov and corriander touch the tounge. Heavy level of carbonation. Yeast and citrus round out the beer.  Mouthfeel: As mentioned before the dominate characteristic of this beer's mouthfeel is the carbonation. Yet it quickly smoothes out.  Drinkability and notes: Doesn't seem like it would even have 4% alcohol in it. Light on the tongue and very drinkable. Great in its simplicity with some good flavours and smells.

Taste: Rich, flavorful maltiness reflecting barley and wheat. A dull, yet refreshing hoppiness that injects a certain mintiness into the beer. Hints of citrus fruit.

(sorry Wayne ;)  Smell: Boy, from the time this beer exploded all over the wall =) it had a fantastic aroma of lemon and wheat with a hint of fresh baked sweet bread.  Taste: The front of the palate is full of wheat, yeasty lemon citrus, and a nice mildly sweet breadiness. There is a nice gentle bitter that balances this beer perfectly.  Mouthfeel: Oh so smooth, a bit of a nice dry finish.  Drinkability: The most drinkable wheat I have had yet. It is truly German and I highly recommend!  Hope this is helpful. Cheers!",Bayerische Staatsbrauerei Weihenstephan,Germany,Hefeweizen,98
252,731,doppelmeup,4.03,"Poured this into a Pilsner glass, as I did not have a Hefe Weizen glass. Huge white foamy head that started out several inches tall, then slowly dissipated to a thick layer of foam with thick lacing on the glass. The beer is a cloudy, medium dark yellow cloudy color. Lots of tiny bubbles continue refreshing the head.  Aroma was yeasty, with fairly strong notes of cloves and allspice. Very similar to Belgian style ales.  Taste similar to smell, with a definite wheat flavor and some clove spiciness.  Light bodied, with plenty of carbonation. Clean, crisp finish.  Very drinkable. I can easily imagine this with a dish of spicy curry.",Bayerische Staatsbrauerei Weihenstephan,Germany,Hefeweizen,98
252,731,Kendo,4.33,"Poured from a 12 oz glass into a weizen-style glass.  Hazy pale yellow with a massive large-bubbled white head.  Smelled of cloves, banana and perhaps allspice. Slightly yeasty.  As for the taste: the cloves hit me first, followed by the allspice I sensed in the nose and finally the bananas. I also described it as ""musky;"" I think that was the yeast. About halfway down I added a small lemon wedge, as I had wanted to sample both with and without the lemon. The addition of the lemon made the remaining foam ring disappear immediately and cut the muskiness, adding - as you'd expect - a more citrusy taste. Despite the old Norm Peterson adage that ""the only thing I want floating in my beer is my liver,"" I actually preferred it with a lemon.  As for the mouthfeel, I thought it was fizzy, real fizzy, and highly carbonated. That fizziness, combined with the general taste, made the beer finish quite dry and clean.  Drinkable? Oh yeah. Throw in a lemon wedge and this would sure beat the heck out of a lemonade on a hot summer day.  Edit, 8/31/10: Had this again recently, this time without the lemon and some four years after first reviewing this. I'm bumping up the taste score to 4.5 (I'd originally given it a 4), as having had plenty of Hefes over the years, I've come to appreciate this one even more.",Bayerische Staatsbrauerei Weihenstephan,Germany,Hefeweizen,98
252,731,ej285701,3.75,"From a 12 oz bottle with the number 4115 on the back label.  Pours a clear golden/orange color with a half inch off-white head.  The smell is nice with bananas and cloves being the most dominant aromas. Also oranges and some other spices as well.  The taste is more subtle than I was expecting. The bananas and cloves are there, as well as the oranges. But there is also a taste of seltzer water in there that seems to dilute the flavors.  There is a seltzer water feel to this beer as well. Not necessarily a fizzy mouthfeel, but very light, and very carbonated.  Drinkability is good. I wouldn't mind having a few of these on a hot day. A good hefeweissen, but not a great one in my opinion.",Bayerische Staatsbrauerei Weihenstephan,Germany,Hefeweizen,98
252,731,orfeu,4.52,"Even with a slow, careful pour, this one has a massively uncontrollable chunky white head -- sitting atop hazy gold with slow but persistent, driving carbonation. I don't have a weizen glass yet (I know, I know), but I did the best I could by drinking this out of a 20-ounce straight-sided tumbler. Aromas of over-warm sprouted wheat berries laced with caramelized date sugar and a dash of clove oil. Some grassy and fruity notes appear as well, with dehydrated banana being the most recognizable. In all, a wonderfully complex aroma that has up till now kept me from actually taking a sip while I try to identify what I'm smelling. The first sip is incredibly grainy overall, but a surprising mineral flavor comes out up front. It then cedes to a yeasty bread dough taste that finishes with Golden Delicious apple and slight banana characteristics. In mid-sip I also pick up some plasticky phenols. The mouthfeel is quite substantial -- moreso than I expected at least -- which gives the beer enough heft to be palatable in colder months, even though it's also refreshing enough for a summer beverage.",Bayerische Staatsbrauerei Weihenstephan,Germany,Hefeweizen,98

And, to say more, the master brewer of Eisenbahn, the best brazilian brewery (and shall i say, probably one of the best of the entire world), was taught there... so, a lot of things can be concluded from that... I bought 3 different Weihenstephaner's beers at the same time (and drank all the three one following the other). I began by this one, and it's very smooth, very soft, even for the style, specially if you compare with other highlights like Erdinger and so on...

252,731,jwc215,4.85,"Poured cloudy golden with a foamy white head that eventually became a fairly thick lace - perfect look for this style. The smell was clean and refreshing - banana/clove that was present but not overwhelming - with some fruity wheat and a touch of yeast aromas - very inviting. The taste was banana and lemon with some clove mixed in. As the drink started it was on the sweeter side, but gradually became drier. Fruity wheat and yeast became more noticeable as the drink warmed. A smooth, creamy, fruity feel was left that lingered for quite some time. Overall, this is one of the best beers I've ever had - nearly perfect - an excellent example of the style and a very enjoyable brew!",Bayerische Staatsbrauerei Weihenstephan,Germany,Hefeweizen,98

Your classic Bavarian wheat appearance.  S - mixture of spices, pepper, allspice, clove. Little bit of spicy hop aroma in there too. Light, toasted wheat, bready.  T - wow, my tongue is excited. All sorts of bright, light spicy and fruity flavors. Clove, spicy banana, allspice, hints of anise. Yum. Mixed in are the firm bready, yeast flavors and toasty wheat. Dry, slightly bitter finish with spicy German noble hop flavors.  M - light, but not what I would call thin bodied. Carbonation is on the high side, per the style. Dry and not sweet.  D - I'm normally not a huge wheat beer fan, but this one is off the charts yummy. Perfect summer brew, light, refreshing. Amazing balance of spicy flavors, malt backbone, and firm bitterness.

A real treat.",Bayerische Staatsbrauerei Weihenstephan,Germany,Hefeweizen,98
252,731,trep,4.13,Slightly cloudy body with a huge creamy head that faded into a blotchy crown atop the body. A tiny bit of random carbonation making its way up from the bottom of the glass.  Spicy cloves and earthy yeast with a little citrus aroma.  Some bananas and light clove spiciness. A little citrusy as well in the finish. Not too bad for a style that I don't exactly love.  Nice amount of carbonation and the beer is really creamy and light-medium bodied. Pretty damn solid here.  A nice refreshing beer after a hard day of pizza delivery. Goes down smooth while still flavorful and it doesn't get mundane either. A solid offering from Weihenstephaner.,Bayerische Staatsbrauerei Weihenstephan,Germany,Hefeweizen,98

Aroma: Classic clove phenols, a touch of overripe bananas, some peppery spiciness.  Appearance: Cloudy straw colored pour with a foamy and creamy bone white head.  Flavor: A bit of yeasty wheat bread funk, more cloves, a banana/fruity finish.  Mouthfeel: Light with lively carbonation. A crisp and clean finish.

T&M- Nice wheat malt taste up front with a large dose of banana and cloves as it is crossing my tongue. This beer is very yeasty and that would explain the banana flavor taking over the beer. Leaves a velvety feeling in my mouth that I haven't found in many other hefeweisen beers.  D- Ths is a very good beer to have on a hot afternoon after work or while sitting by the pool.

Taste is much like the smell with clove and bananas with a clean finish.

It's oh so pleasant.  I spent a lot of time looking at and smelling it, so finally I tasted. Theres cloves with a spicy tartness, it mellows to a nice subtle fruitiness. I wouldn't call it bitter, I'd say theres a slight but very pleasant sourness.  It's so light and refreshing, it entices you to drink more. This is the exact right way to relax on a warm evening.

Smell: The beer explodes forth from my glass with a melange of cloves, yeasty bread, citrus and bannanas.  Taste: The beer delivers on the smell. The taste is as expected spicy yeastyness riding a wave of bready citrus and banannas. The hops assert themselves and provide a good earthy cloves taste.  Mouthfeel/ Drinkability: This is a light and refreshing beer. The carbonation provides extra drinkability. The beer is well balanced and dam good.

Coming from a brewery that has been around for several several centuries, one would hope that sooner or later they would get it right, and apparently, that brewery has known what it has been doing for quite some time. For starters, the beer is housed in a classically labeled bottle. It pours a nice golden haziness, with the clouds, typical of the style. Sniffs small cloves, banana. This beer tastes fantastic. Again, some cloves, very subtly pronounced malts, banana, wheat (i seriously get the same after-breath from this beer that i get from drinking Bernheim's Original Wheat Whiskey, which i think is cool). This beer, as many have said time and time again, one of the most balanced and well carbonated brews of all time. It's velvety creamy dry finish is more than welcome to a thirsty palate.

It smelled yeasty and sweet, kind of fruity (bananas and citrus). The flavors were mostly spicy and fruity, kind of cloves and bananas. There was a good bready taste also, lots of yeast flavor.  Moderate carbonation and full mouthfeel make this beer feel a little heavy.

252,731,phisig137,4.2,"Pours a hazy light gold color, with a one finger head that slowly falls into a nice blanket over top of the glass. No lacing.  Aroma is positively wheaty, with overtones of clove and spice. Minimal banana aroma. Also, hints of bubblegum are present towards the end of the whiff.  Flavor is very delicate, but enjoyable. Small flavors of banana start out, rounding off to a smooth wheat/bready flavor, and finishing clean. Teasty esters seem to stick to the tongue, and draw out a long refreshing finish.  Mouthfeel is light and refreshing, due in part to the agressive carbonation. Drinkability is extremely high, especially on a humid night such as tonight.  Although this hefe is incredibly smooth and refreshing, it is not my favorite. A local brewery by me, Legend, produces a hefe that tastes much the same, but has a much larger body. Personally I prefer the Legend beer, but it's only available for a limited time. When it is not available though, this is definitely the hefe I reach for.  If I only had one word to describe this beer, it would be ""refreshingly smooth and round"". Yeah, that's 4 words, but it's still one thought.

Banana and spicy clove dominated. About half way through a nice mustard aroma developed.  The taste was very spicy as well. There wasn't the super wheaty flavor that I look for in a hefe. This beer was cleaner than most. Very enjoyable nonetheless.  The mouthfeel was light, yet full. Again, more of a wheaty mouthfeel would have been prefered.  A very drinkable and refreshing hefe.

Smell is sweet of fruity yeast and spice, finished with the delicate sent of mild hops.  Taste is Oh So refreshing, The taste is of sweet grains mixed with bananas of the perfect hints of spice finished with a hopy bitterness that drys you out just enough to make you long for the next bi swig.

252,731,falloutsnow,4.53,"Bottle purchased from Hyvee in Council Bluffs, IA. No apparent bottled on date. Poured into a Schell's weizen glass.  Pours an enormous meringue-like head composed of small and medium-sized bubbles. Peering at the body, I notice aggressive streams of carbonation and the cloudy, nearly opaque character that's due to the unfiltered preparation of the beer. Body color is a dull golden away from light, a hazy orange-yellow when held to a point source. This is like peering into a murky sunrise. As the head descends over the course of many minutes (it always retains about one centimeter of foam) it leaves some good lacing along the sides of the glass, which is augmented each time a sip is taken.  Aromas of bananas, coriander, sweet bread, yeast, slight cloves, and a bit of carmelized butternut squash. The strongest aromas are the coriander, bananas, and sweet bread. There's quite a bit going on with the scent, the aroma never seems to dull my senses, and it's a pleasure to swirl and sip this each time.  Tasting the beer reveals excellent banana, apple and pear flavors with noteable bubblegum, clove (phenolic) and lemon attributes mingled alongside them. Aftertaste is of bananas, apples, and bubblegum, pleasurably tart. It would be amazing if they made this with a slightly higher amount of darker malt, or made an additional version with that grain bill, not a dunkel, but somewhere in-between.  Solidly medium-bodied with a slight light or watery feel, the beer has a refreshing combination of thickness from the wheat/malt mix and crispness from the carbonation level. Very smooth initially, but leads to a dry finish that complements the tart aftertaste nicely.  A highly drinkable weissbier and avatar at the style, refreshing in all seasons.",Bayerische Staatsbrauerei Weihenstephan,Germany,Hefeweizen,98

Another thing I like, from inspecting the label, is that they still stick to the German Purity Law of 1516.  Pours a cloudy gold, with a white head that erupts from the glass almost immediately; one must pour carefully to prevent overspill. After the pour is complete, it looks like a textbook hefeweizen, weizen glass included.  I always hear about the banana/clove character that arises from Bavarian wheat yeast, but I could never pick up anything resembling banana. I guess I'm just not sensitive to it. But I think I can smell it from this glass, there's not enough for me to be sure. I do get some cloviness, however.  After a few sips, I sense some banana, bubblegum, some tartness, and a twinge of hop bitterness. There's also a little bit of a citrus tone. It all melds together very well.  This hefeweizen is light, easy drinking, and refreshing. A perfect summer refresher. Overall, an excellent beer.

Aroma and taste are very familiar, although perfect for the style -- bananas, spices, cloves, and some yeastiness.  Wonderfully smooth mouthfeel -- the best part of drinking this beer. Minimal aftertaste, very easy to drink.  A great hefe, but to be honest I think my favourite is still local (Denison's is amazing!)",Bayerische Staatsbrauerei Weihenstephan,Germany,Hefeweizen,98

The aroma is dominated by banana-smelling byproducts produced by the yeast, very inviting. It has a light banana fruity flavor with a hint of malt and almost imperceptible hop aftertaste. The mouthfeel is smooth and somewhat creamy with high carbonation. As the beer warms up a bit, the banana flavor is right out front and the smell is irresistible. Unfortunately, my full glass is empty all too quickly.  This is an outstanding wheat beer and an exceptional example of the hefeweissen style. It has a light, refreshing flavor and wonderful aroma.

Pours a murky, yellow color with a pillow-like head that is colored white with a frothy texture. Some carbonation is apparent, but hidden by the massive head. Nice rings of lacing are left behind in my oversized wiess glass. Aromas of grains, cloves, tropical fruit, and lemons seem to come out nicely. The taste is just great; well-balanced and flavorful with hints of various tropical fruits. Grain flavors dominate; bread-like texture and taste.

252,731,goochpunch,4.68,"Pours out a cloudy gold with a huge head that seems quite fizzy, but rocky. Goes down to a 1/2"" head with lacing down the side. Interestingly enough, the haze was not so much that you couldn't see the strong carbonation. Smell is tart and lemony with an adequate phenolic kick. Grainy, but just the right amount. As I let the aromas linger in my nose, I get a whiff of tart, pulpy tamarind paste. The flavors are full of lemon, banana, and clove, with an aftertaste of orange-pineapple juice. This tastes like some fruit punch. The only problem I see here is that the flavors kind of drop off in the end. Mouthfeel is light, bubbly, fluffy, and doesn't stick to my tongue too much, despite some lingering sweetness. Basically, this feels like liquid marshmallows on my tongue. A lot of people preface the drinkability of weissbier with the current weather conditions (myself included), but this would be highly drinkable in any season.

Usual unfiltered body, golden with a touch of copper hue towards the core. Inviting is an understatement. Bannana and a delicate soft fruitiness comes alive in the aroma.  Everything except the carbonation in this beer is so delicate, soft and so well put together it could make a man cry. It's been a while since I enjoyed a beer that joined the ""elite"" class in my rankings but this fits the bill...why? there is a tender clove, bananna taste that makes up the bill but it is backed by some gentle malts that truly give this the backbone that so many miss out on. Lemon makes up the finish and it cleans up remarkably well. It was the opposite of so many american wheat beers that tend to be to grained up.

252,731,Ego,4.46,"found on tap @ the peculiar pub right by NYU (bleeker st), I was in the area for work and popped on in for a pint, this place just brings back memories of the ole college days... this is not a style I go for too often but with hot college chicks abounding and nicer weather.. what the hell...  eyes... frothy white pillowy head, cloudy pale straw haze but completely consistent in the entire glass (the bartender asked me about adding a lemon, I declined to taste this pure, kudos for at least asking!), the lacing and cling are absolutely superb, even hiding in the haze you can see the carbonation feeding the head and keeping it constant - absolutely flawless looking, I tried to find something wrong with this beer, and kept looking at it from different angles, but no, this thing was a goddamn beer postcard sent from beer paradise.  nose... had a strange toasty smell (not off putting), there are hints of lemon floating and enticing you in the background, there is a subtle spiciness to it with mild fruit notes like bannana... I loved sniffing this thing even if it wasn't crazy complex or fascinating, it smelled great and the smell was strong, you didn't have to work to get at the tones here, there is also some grain prescence, I was impressed.  taste etc. somewhat full in the mouth, the carbonation rolls around carrying this lovely libation all around your mouth in a surreal fashion. you can literally roll this around on your tongue back and forth to enjoy the sensation of silk/velvet liquid... amazing and flawless in that department. the wheat coats and sticks in the mouth furnishing the strongest aftertaste I think I have come across for a hefe. there are tones of toffee and noogat (you know, that unidentified crap in candy bars), as I rolled it in my mouth I just couldn't get over the complexity of this little heffer, the carbonation even has a little prickly bite to it, very small, which just accents the experience that much more. it is almost lip smacking refreshing but yet has nutty and toasty tones that really grab the attention of your pallette, it is in a sense dry and yet refreshing.. and complex.  verdict? I had to run out and grab a bottle of this on the way home.. and the bottle does not do this justice. still great out of a bottle but the mouthfeel is no where near the experience I had this afternoon. This was the best $5 I spent in a long time... this one was nearly flawless, I wish half the hefes I huff where as bad ass as this monster brew, outstanding.",Bayerische Staatsbrauerei Weihenstephan,Germany,Hefeweizen,98
252,731,daliandragon,4.33,"Just spent an unseasonably warm April day moving my sister and her roommate from old to new apartments about nine blocks apart in Boehrum Hts in Brooklyn. On the way back stopped at the beer delis on Atlantic avenue and stocked up on some quality singles. Figuring this was a good way to reward my toil: the highest rated Hefe on the site. Beautiful thick white puffy cloud style head and healthy lacing coat the upper reaches and the body is spot on in color and cloudiness. Banana and clove are where they're suppossed to be smellwise along with some citrus notes and yeastiness. Light in texture and carbonation but taste is full if somewhat muted. Balanced mouthfeel and texture makes this for easy drinking. The taste is clean in finish and very satisfying and refreshing. Quenching is the word that comes to mind. I am now quenched. Yeah, I'll be looking for this again this summer although its excellent, its more difficult for me to find than Paulaner and Erdinger, who make very good (and easier to acquire) hefes.",Bayerische Staatsbrauerei Weihenstephan,Germany,Hefeweizen,98
252,731,orsulacp,4.13,"The beer poured a cloudy yellow with a persistent fluffy white head. It smells good, a nice banana and a bit of clove. The taste is very good; my first impression is a sweet banana, then slight hit of vanilla with the cloves finishing it off. It is well carbonated and has a creamy mouthfeel, very refreshing.

T: Big tasty wheat flavors up front with candy banana, a hint of cloves and vanilla. Delicious and refreshing!  M&D: Smooth, light and refreshing. This brew goes down easy and does not sit heavy. Carbonation is just right.  I've had this one before, but had to revisit it with the weather heating up. I enjoying this bottle with a friend after 18 holes of disc golf.

There is plenty of foamy white head present. The smell has a nice wheaty-fruity fragerance, with a bit of yeast. The taste is faintly sweet, with nicely balanced citrus undertones. There is a crispness to the after taste. This beer and Paulaner rank as bench marks for a hefe weizen. While not the type of beer to be searched for, it it definitely worth grapping and giving a try, if you see it on the shelf.",Bayerische Staatsbrauerei Weihenstephan,Germany,Hefeweizen,98

The banana and cloves flavoring from the yeast is far from subtle. Everything a great Hefe should be. The consistency was great. By no means watery.  Overall, where it should be, one of the top Hefe's in the world. Mine tasted fresh, but I didn't know how to decipher the date code on back to know for sure.

Big frothy head fills the glass to overflow. Let the head settle and swish in the last bit of hefe. This is not one of my favorite Bavarian hefs when compared to the Paulaner and HackerPschorr masterpieces, but it is very good and drinkable indeed. Bananna, clove, spice, bubblegum flavors appear as the usual characters. It's most unique characteristic was hints of grapefruit and perhaps pineapple.

Not typical of German Hefies I prefer. The color is a clear golden color with traces of organics floating around. There is no lace to speak of.  The smell hints at banana. Medium mouth feel. Not heavy, but I can detect the alcohol in it. Lots of malt in the taste and a nice after taste. I couldn't drink too many of these...

Little to no hops are present - it's a delicious malty, yeasty scent.  Absolute perfection to taste! Banana, apricot, slight clove - sugar, very low hop bitterings.  Crisp, soft, swirling, tasty.

I tried this one due to the ratings it received amongst the ""hefes"" and ""weiss beers"". As you all were correct about Aventinus... you were also with this one. I am not disappointed by your knowledge and recommendations.  The appearance is good and cloudy like a hefe should be. The smell is very aromatic...hints of wheat and I think a bit citrus-like. The taste is very clean, very nice. The mouthfeel is very smooth. I rate this one high on drinkability because--well--put a hose from the tap and let me sip all day.  I'm a big Franzikaner fan and I didn't think I'd ever find a beer to rival it. Well, this one does. My fellow BAs if you ever in your life want to try a good ""hefe""... I highly recommend this one. My personal favorite of Franziskaner is also a good choice. I have to rate this one as high as my personal fav, though.

Took two pours to empty the bottle.  Taste is light and wheaty, barely sweet. Lots of toast and yeast going on in the flavors, the barest hint of lemon (although served sans), some more fruit and banana emerges as it warms. A slight lingering musty element, may be due to a bottle that's a little older than prime. Not quite as complex as I think it should be, lacks a lot of the strong clovey/peppery/banana flavors expected from a hefe.  Mouthfeel is chewy due to the wheat but not really thick. Has some texture to it. I understand the reputation but I've had some better hefes brewed in the US.

Mouthfeel- velvetly smooth. starts off creamy and finishes off mouth and throat warming smooth.  Overall- Wow! This is one damn fine Hefe. The best I've sampled yet.

S= The nose is very nice-- almost a rose-bouquet scent to it. The flavor matches. I have to wonder if maybe there's some rose-hips added in the formula.  T= Taste-- even the head is delightful to slurp. The beer is a nice modestly-carbonated mix of floral, fruits, mild honey, clove, all sorts of things going on here to keep one busy. I do get a strong bubblegum-aftertaste. In fact, my first impression was that it tasted like gun-poweder until my tastebuds began to focus.  M= Clean. Occasional bubblegum.

Yummy.",Bayerische Staatsbrauerei Weihenstephan,Germany,Hefeweizen,98
252,731,bahumutx,4.45,"Served from a 16.9 oz. bottle into a pint glass.  Appearance: Pours a cloudy orange color with about a two finger creamy head.  Smell: Smells of yeast, banana and a slight clove.  Taste: There are many different tastes present. Yeast, Banana, Cloves and Malt. This beer is very balanced.  Mouthfeel: Smooth Mouthfeel with the right amount of carbonation. Very nice ending flavor.  Drinkability: Very drinkable. I could easily have a few of these in a sitting. This is a great example of the Hefe Wiezen. This beer is very tasty and I will be picking up more of this for sure!!! Great work by Weihenstephaner and I am sure that this is one great brew since this brewery has been brewing since 1040 A.D.",Bayerische Staatsbrauerei Weihenstephan,Germany,Hefeweizen,98
252,731,TheLongBeachBum,4.6,"Presentation: Half-litre, tall transitioned neck brown glass bottle that holds 16.9 fluid ounces for Uncle Sam. Logod crown cap with a generic Weihenstephaner main and neck labels. Listed at alc. 5,4% vol. Reverse label has the Code 3285 if that means anything.  Appearance: Low level turbidity glosses the clear golden straw body with a murky orange tinge. Fast rising head forms from out of the milky upper head and creates a 2 thick polystyrene plug in my straight sided glass. Average conditioning seems to go to great lengths to support the expanded white colored head. Minimal lacing but this looks great in the glass.  Nose: Archetypal aromas exhibit all that is great about the classic Teutonic Hefes. Fruity bananas and a yeasty clove dominate but the odors are more complex with added yeasts and some dough.  Taste: Lots of banana and clove are to be expected but what continually surprises is the clean unfettered profile that this Hefe presents. Touches of spices, yeasts, dough and a fantastic malty presence. Its all here and balanced in one of those brews that is a perfect marriage.  Mouthfeel: With its fine tuned soft conditioning, this is oh-so good in the mouth, on the tongue and cheeks. Long after the swallow it leaves a soft soothing feel with a spritzy remnant of the carbonation. Lemony black peppers tingle in the back end. Great feel and a concrete body.  Drinkability: One of those great brews that just exhibits a terrific palate, one that is extremely hard to critique but just way too fucking easy to pound.  Overall: As good as it gets. I really cannot believe that I never ever reviewed this definitive Hefe, maybe I did in a drunken haze and it got deleted.who knows?! I returned to a serious classic tonight though, a thoroughly enjoyable reunion, well be meeting up again on a regular basis for sure to catch up for old times sake. Superb!!  A Classic Marque.",Bayerische Staatsbrauerei Weihenstephan,Germany,Hefeweizen,98
252,731,jarmby1711,4.08,If one is to review by style this is pretty well muchas the BA description says it should be. The bead is lively and dances and is easily seen in the murky orange beer. The head is cloudy white and laces right to the end of the glass. The smell is phenolic/yeast. The flavour is all of cloves apples nutmeg and phenols. The tartness and wild carbonation along with the mix of fruit and spices makes this a great experience.It isnt a drink all day beer but one to be savoured .,Bayerische Staatsbrauerei Weihenstephan,Germany,Hefeweizen,98

Taste Strong Orange/Grapefruit notes here. . Mouthfeel: For the type, the mouthfeel was perfect. Smooth but not watery.  Notes/Drinkability: You simply must seek this out and try it if you have the chance. A very good representation of the style.",Bayerische Staatsbrauerei Weihenstephan,Germany,Hefeweizen,98
252,731,Franchise,4.55,"This beer pours a fresh sqeezed orange juice color and leaves a thick white lace. The smell is aromatic orange, lemon zest, grass, hay, summertime in a bottle. The taste of this beer is so smooth it goes down so easy, lemon, grassy notes, with some subtle orange sweetness lingers on the palate in the finish. This is a simple hefe that just satisfies the tounge with fresh malty sweetness.",Bayerische Staatsbrauerei Weihenstephan,Germany,Hefeweizen,98
252,731,weeare138,4.52,"Appears a cloudy gold with a fluffy white head that slowly fades to a film. Spots of lacing around the glass. Smell is of vanilla, crisp wheat, lemony citrus, and just a hint of banana. Taste is of the same aromas. Mouthfeel is smooth, creamy, soft on the palate with a citrus sugar and sourness that is superb for the style. Drinkabily-IMO, the best Weizen yeast out there. Love this beer.",Bayerische Staatsbrauerei Weihenstephan,Germany,Hefeweizen,98

252,731,yelterdow,5,"Served in the brewery's own Weihenstephan Hefeweissbier glass at just over fridge temperature. Freshness code reads 3285 on the rear label. 16.9 oz.  Appearance- Perfection. The beer glows a cloudy orange with streaming action inside the glass... it takes a few minutes to pour because of the resilience of its gigantic, soapy head. The sheer beauty of this rivals the exquisite presence of Duvel in its own tulip glass, on a perfect pour.  Smell- Even cold, the bananas and cloves leap out of the glass... and a thick, yeasty aroma blankets the nose. Bold and powerful, there is no mistaking the superb craftsmanship that awaits.  Taste- Full and round, the bready notes of the yeast intertwine with the banana-like esters and malts, as the dense wheat character rides alongside. A gentle sweetness is left behind in the finish.  Mouthfeel/Drinkability- Prickly and alive in the mouth, with just the right fortitude in the swallow. Medium weight and certainly not wimpy. This drinks so well by itself in the middle of winter, but memories of this by the barbecue in the summer sun with sausage and pepper sandwiches are too much for my brain right now. IMO, the finest Hefe out there.",Bayerische Staatsbrauerei Weihenstephan,Germany,Hefeweizen,98

The head was over 3inches upon pouring, minutes later, it is down to about an inch and ready to enjoy.  Smells of heavy yeasts, bananas. Tastes of clove, bananas, yeasts and a little bit of citrus on the finish.  Not many surprises there, I know. But this is the standard for hefeweizens.  I'm actually not a big fan of the wheat beers, but every time I open one of these, I'm glad I did.",Bayerische Staatsbrauerei Weihenstephan,Germany,Hefeweizen,98

Bananas, cloves, breadiness, citrus rhinds. Very refreshing, this is a great lawnmower beer. This is a thirst quencher for sure.  Mouthfeel: Smooth and almost creamy, if thats possible for a beer this fizzy. Dry citrus finish that begs you to take another sip.  I love this beer, but its sweetness comes off a bit strong after 2 or 3 of these, so I must temper my rating a tad.",Bayerische Staatsbrauerei Weihenstephan,Germany,Hefeweizen,98
252,731,HappyHourHero,4.27,"Poured a small, dense, brilliant white colored head that faded slowly to a thin film. Clear, glowing straw colored beer with a few bubbles rising gently through the middle. Hints of floral hops and yeast, lemon zest, and dash of white pepper waft from the glass. Refreshingly crisp mouthfeel goes well with the fresh flavors. Hops are mildly spicey up front and meld well with the wheat base. Yeast flavors are subdued along with a bit of lemon zest. Finish is more of a hop tea astringency then bitterness. The flavors and aromas are mild, but plentiful and enjoyable.",Bayerische Staatsbrauerei Weihenstephan,Germany,Hefeweizen,98

Smell is spicy, mildly fruity, with a great yeastiness. Taste is refreshing to the max. Sweet wheaty malt starts things off. It blends well with some spicy clove and lemony tartness. Very yeasty. Mouthfeel is creamy and airy. Carbonation holds up until the very end. I could drink this all day, winter or summer. In the top three hefe weizens in the world.",Bayerische Staatsbrauerei Weihenstephan,Germany,Hefeweizen,98
252,731,JanM,4.23,"This very refreshing and bubbly beer smells very wheaty and white bready, just like a weissbeer should. The color is golden, and the cloudiness makes it look like honey. It pours with good foam and leaves a nice lacing. The silky taste is of wheat (obviously), not too sweet and with hops in the aftertaste. It's very dry and there is a sour note wrestling with the hops. It's good for us Swedes that it's included in Systembolaget's standard selection, and thus available almost anywhere in the country.",Bayerische Staatsbrauerei Weihenstephan,Germany,Hefeweizen,98

Nothing too promenant. Very sweet smelling.  T - Wow. This is the best beer I've ever tasted. I am so impressed by this. It's very fruity with a hint of bubblegum on the end.  M - Excellent. Perfect aftertaste. Smooth feeling on pallet.  D - So complex that it's hard to take it all in at once. This is definitley a sipping beer, and not a swill.  This was absoutley amazing beer.

252,731,IrishRedRock,4.46,"Drinking this extremely quaffable brew, I'm reminded of that SNL skit featuring Will Ferrell, as he sits in the hottub at the Welshly Arms Hotel. ""Methinks it was the finest love making the world had ever known!"" Why, ye may ask? Because this is the finest Hefe my palate has ever known. But as usual, I digress.  Poured this proper-style into my Weisse glass, and it's sexy as hell. Hazy sunrise golden, with giant bubbles quickly making the long trek to the top of this glass. Initial size of the head is an enormous pillowy white, which slowly recedes yet constantly has a solid half-inch throughout. Amazing retention. Impressive looking beer.  Sweet, candy-like estery aromas, standard notes of clove and subtle lemon. Despite the appearance of heavy carbonation, this hits the mouth rather thick, coating it completely, with just a tingle of carbonation in the finish. Sweet mother of Bavaria, that's nice.  Very nicely balanced flavor and remains extremely complex. Tangerine and clementine citrus flavors up front, rich and malty with a bubblegum sweetness...the spicy clove is mild yet lingers throughout. Chalky hop bitterness with lush floral notes towards the end. By far, the cream of the crop for this style that I've had the pleasure of sampling.",Bayerische Staatsbrauerei Weihenstephan,Germany,Hefeweizen,98
252,731,nortmand,5,"Wow, my first 5. and mostly because this is hands down the best hefe I've ever had. Damn.  Pours yellow orange below a peerfect fluffy head.  Smell is a spicy banana clove yeastiness that literally permeates the entire room. Simply amazing.  Yeasty flavor, huge clove flavor. Esters, grass and fruit to boot. This goes above and beyond.  Chewy yeastiness adds alot of body to this brew, but it remains light and delicious overall.  Extraordinarily drinkable any time of year. Refreshing when its warm out, spicy and fulfilling in the cold. I give it a five based on the fact that it literally takes this style to another level. Sure, if given the choice of only this or Arrogant Bastard for the rest of my life, I'd choose the arrogance, but this is one fine, well crafted brew. Hot damn!",Bayerische Staatsbrauerei Weihenstephan,Germany,Hefeweizen,98

Spotted patches of lace.  Moderate malted oat sweetness; a hint of lemon zest with a toch of diacetyl. Some pepper added to the primary, lightly sweetened grain aroma.  An initial burst of clean citric flavor accompanied by a mildly sweet toasted oat and malt character. Along with a wave of carbonation is a hint of pepper giving this hefe a touch of spice to balance its sweetness. The aftertaste brings to mind sour lemons.  Light bodied; balanced in terms of sweet & mellow and peppered-spice; but, flavorwise, ais a bit out of synch.  A sweeter and more mellow take on the style. Not one I'd go searching for, but not too shabby.",Bayerische Staatsbrauerei Weihenstephan,Germany,Hefeweizen,98
252,731,DarkerTheBetter,4.8,"Weihenstephaner is my favorite imported German Weissbier.  The color is a beautiful golden orange and the foggy yeast looks bright white instead of just dirty. It also holds a decent head for a while.  Smells like half and half, plums. bananas and wheat. Im drooling already. I noticed a lot of variation even between bottles in a six pack with this beer, which is unfortunate. This one is right on.  Flavors creamy and smooth. Good wheat flavor, but the sweetness blended with the citrus really steals the show. Almost wholesome to the point of my mouth not recognizing it as a beer. This is making me miss my military career in Germany.  Mouth feel is a little too carbonated for the thickness of the beer. Thats about the only miss here.  Weihenstephaner is my go to wietzen, but I must reiterate that I found a terrible inconsistency in the freshness of this beer. If youre not impressed with the bottle in front of you, try another. This is a sad state of affairs, but the pay off of a perfect Hefe is well worth it. Good luck!",Bayerische Staatsbrauerei Weihenstephan,Germany,Hefeweizen,98

Best weissbier of all time.",Bayerische Staatsbrauerei Weihenstephan,Germany,Hefeweizen,98
252,731,BEERchitect,4.6,"Yea, yea, clove... and bananna, ...and bubblegum... we've heard all of the common attributes that make good Hefeweizens great. But what makes this one different?  A fantastic pour brings a color that rides the line between strong straw and golden. Light rust seems to fit the bill. Very froathy and moussey with head formation and retention. The appearance promises maltiness and creaminess.  Moderate aromas of estery banannas, apples, and peaches lead the way with several phenolic note following closely behind; mostly clove, white pepper, and orange zest.  The fruity, spicy notes in the aroma give a lot of valor to the taste. A strong bready flavor of shortbread, wheat, rye, and barley make for a complex and varying taste. Again, the banannas, clove, corriander, apples, pepper,....(the list can go on and on.) give a lot of varying complexity to the brew. I get a new description in every sip.  The body is a great blend of creamy and drinkability. Initial full, rich, and expanding textures expand wonderfully in the mouth, but subside just in time to allow the beverage to lighten and flow effortlessly into the finish. A great Summertime refresher with a cooling, minty finish.  Ultimately the beer shows a unique balance of bananna esters, clovey phenols, and with a bubblegum (confectionate) sweetness that never allows any one aspect to dominate; but rather come together in a harmonious blend. No other beer does this much flavor with such sensible proportions-- this is why the beer rates among the best!",Bayerische Staatsbrauerei Weihenstephan,Germany,Hefeweizen,98

Plenty of cloves in the aroma, backed up by banana fruitiness. Mellow breadiness is in there as well, but the phenolic character is what really shines through. Bubblegum flavour with some malty sweetness start things off, lemon and light vanilla show up part way through. Cloves and phenolic spice round out the end and carry into the finish, along with mellow sweetness. The carbonation is lighter than expected, but is still crisp at the finish. Light body too, and the texture is quite creamy. Very enjoyable with lots of classic hefe character, this is an easy drinking beer that I'll be looking for again.",Bayerische Staatsbrauerei Weihenstephan,Germany,Hefeweizen,98

The aromas were straight and too the point with some light biscuity goodness, banana and clove action all throughout. The flavor smoothly followed suit with a slightly palate-cleansing yet very smooth feel on the palate.  Perhaps the best on the market today, import or domestic. Seek and ye shall find...

252,731,ColoradoBobs,4.47,"Sheesh! I like Hefeweizens, and this is really very good!  Huge rocky white head, with sticky lacing over a cloudy orange body with very fine bubbles.  Lots of complexity in the aroma, with plenty of clove and peppery spicyness and a hint of citrus behind a malted wheat warmth. Not as much banana ester as I expected, not like a Hacker-Pschorr H-W, but very slightly there.  This has a heavier ""richer"" flavor than most H-W's, with a bit more malt and sweetness than I expected. Very pleasant and lots of clove. Long warm finish, with a dry even slightly bitter after-note. Quite pleasant and surprising.  Mouthfeel is also a bit thicker and rounder than most H-W's I've had. That accounts for the huge head and sticky lacing.  Very drinkable. Goes down easy, and not overmuch carbonation. Could drink several, but it's late already.  Overall, very good, but certainly not as heavenly as the Andechs H-W available at the monastery -- but then I suppose this also is better on tap at the brewery than out of the bottle I opened 20 minutes ago.

Smells of barley, yeast, grain, with a touch of sweet bubble gum and a hefty dose of banana. Nice.  Light, crisp with a touch of citrus and banana. So refreshing. So good. As I said... exactly what I want out of a hefe. Exemplary.  The mouthfeel is tight and carbonated... feels very light in the mouth... very crisp... very summery.  What is there to say.... this beer is near perfect in every category. The only reason I don't give it all 5's is becauce I've had Live Oak's Hefe, which I think gives this a run for its money... a bit more complex IMO.

Yeast was stirred up in the bottle and poured in to, where it hung in suspension just below the head. Foam lacing on the glass.  Aroma: Bananas, clove, vanilla and apricots, followed by a whiff of spicey wheat malt, and no real hop to talk of.  Taste: Clean crisp malt and fruit in the mouth.

Some citrus zest in there, also. Stellar in its attempt.  Mouthfeel: Creamy, but not to the point where it makes you feel like you shouldn't drink another. Carbonation almost seems like a bit much at first, but the head stays on, so it's a bit due to that, and it mixes with the creamy and certainly medium to full-bodied mouthfeel, giving it a pretty fantasic ride overall.

Not to say that we can't brew a decent hefe weizen - this just seems like the ideal model. The flavors and aromas of this beer are so well balanced - mild, sweet banana and a clean, perfect maltiness. Nicely flavored and not overdone.

It looks amazing like I would expect the world's first Hefeweissbier too. Smells full of wheaty malts, yeast, and light spicey citrus. Tastes ultra refreshing. Wheat malts, with spicey citrus overtones, and a nice crisp carbonation. Dryness increases as carbonation decreases, finishing with lemon/orange peel and sweet spices. Nice complex mouthfeel, and very very drinkable. Practically inhale-able.  I really recommend this, epsecially in the Summer.",Bayerische Staatsbrauerei Weihenstephan,Germany,Hefeweizen,98
252,731,beersarang,4.53,"Hefeweizen is not my favorite style in the world, but for the style this is how the beer ranks.  Pours a nice gold with a big white frothy head that holds its own, as a wheat should.  Cloves seem to dominate the banana in the aroma but there is a light bready banana underneath.  Nice wheat bready twang with little to no hop flavor or bitterness to follow. Not sweet either, but quite malty. Banana and spicy clove interplays, finishes sweet on the exhale. Yeast character is the highlight of this beer, subtle and indescribable.  A delightful medium bodied beer with smooth carbonation.  I would not mind drinking this on hot days at all.",Bayerische Staatsbrauerei Weihenstephan,Germany,Hefeweizen,98
252,731,ElGordo,4.45,"Presented in a 500ml brown bottle with the classic German label. Poured into a pilsner glass, since there was a tragedy involved with my good weizen glass last time I bought one of these (sniff). Body is a vibrant golden hue with a sizeable stark white head. Lots of carbonation in the form of pretty big, coca-cola sized bubbles. Crisp, clean nose of light German hops, tantalizing yeast, and a touch of malt. Palate is much the same - clean yeast, light hops, and just enough maltiness to add some balance. Some tanginess from the hops emerges mid-palate and mellows into a nice, slightly hoppy dry finish. Brilliant in its simplicity, this is a well-built beer. Nice mouthfeel - medium body, highly carbonated but not foamy. I could drink this all day, every day.",Bayerische Staatsbrauerei Weihenstephan,Germany,Hefeweizen,98
252,731,kmpitz2,4.57,"Pours a nice hazy straw color with a fluffy 3 finger head that falls to a finger and a half. Nice bubbles churn through the liquid. The nose is full on banana and clove. Not too sweet. Just a touch of wheat hiding behind it. Very nice. The flavor is a symphony for my taste-buds. Banana, cream, clove, wheat. All balanced and nothing over-riding anything else. As good a hefe as can be found. The feel is moderate to thick with a light to moderate carbonation. A fantastic hefe. Hands down this is a winner. I need to drink it more often.",Bayerische Staatsbrauerei Weihenstephan,Germany,Hefeweizen,98
252,731,Dubblebock,4.83,"Man, I had heard quite a lot of positive word about this beer, and this is definitely a case where a product lives up to it's hype. The Weihenstephaner Hefeweissbier is truly a world-class beer, one of the standard-bearers of the Hefeweizen style.  The appearance was outstanding. The Weissbier poured with a massive, creamy head of foam that was so tightly compacted that it resembled whipped cream. The body of the beer itself was a cloudy orange, dense and bubbly.  The taste was sublime. Citrus notes and a smooth banana taste dominated the palate, with hints of clove and/or alspice keeping things interesting in the background. Incredibly tasty. Perfectly balanced.  Great mouthfeel, full-bodied. EXCEPTIONAL drinkability. I could drink these all summer long. I was longing for another as soon as I had quaffed the first one.  Makes a good pair with lighter chicken and/or seafood dishes. I wouldn't be scared to try it with white-sauced pasta dishes, either. Fantastic summertime brew, it's a classic all the way around. Don't pass it up.",Bayerische Staatsbrauerei Weihenstephan,Germany,Hefeweizen,98
252,731,Gritsak,4.62,"A- hazy yellow with a fluffy white head. some lacing on the glass but the majority of the head dissapates relatively quickly. i was expecting a little more retention on the head.  S- strong grainy, fruity smell. banana dominates overall.  T- lots of orange, banana and citrus flavor.  M- medium body with a good amount of carbonation. even with the carbonation it is extremely smooth and silky.  D- very high drinkability for me. the well balanced taste and smooth mouthfeel makes it a winner in this catagory.  overall- definitely one of the best hefe's ive tried. It would be tough to top this, only disapointment i had was with the lack of head retention. im a little past the best by date on the back maybe that could account for this? eitherway its a hit in my book",Bayerische Staatsbrauerei Weihenstephan,Germany,Hefeweizen,98
252,731,thechaacster,4.8,"Cloudy straw yellow, big honking billowy head. Lovely, juicy wheat, yeast and clove aroma. Incredibly full malty wheat flavor, with the classic hefe backup of banana and hints of pear and apple. Lots of yeast creates a creamy and slightly chalky character. Incredibly drinkable too, to the point that it goes down like water or soda. Absolutely the classic hefeweizen, and fully deserving of its history and reputation.

Hazy straw yellow with a white head that is tall, sticks to the glass leaving good lace, and settles down to about 1cm or so.  The nose is a wonderful balance of strong clove and wheat aromas. Spicy with some banana and honey in the back. Also a bit chalky. WOW!  The taste starts off malty but then quickly changes to some clove, some bite from the carbonation, then a biscuity finish with some suggestion of bitter hop. The yeast gives it an almost bready character.  Nice malty body that works well with the active carbonation. Great session beer during these never ending dog days of summer.",Bayerische Staatsbrauerei Weihenstephan,Germany,Hefeweizen,98
252,731,KarlHungus,4,"Pours a solid, cloudy orange color with a fluffy white head that is dinosauric in size. The aroma is of cloves and bananas. The taste is fairly juicy, citrus, and banana.

252,731,Billolick,4.5,"Not sure what I can add to 290 reviews...medium sized bottle, no freshness dating, pours cloudy honey yellow, puffy/fluffy white head, just a tad of lacing. Nose is tasty bananas and yeast, glorious yeast. This is the gold standard for German Hefe, yum yum, soft balanced, fruity, tons of bananas and yeast notes. Easy drinking, crowd pleaser, give me some salad, cheese, bread and a glass of this fine brew and I will be a smiling! Great summer quaffer, fine all year round wheat",Bayerische Staatsbrauerei Weihenstephan,Germany,Hefeweizen,98
252,731,DrunkMcDermott,3.48,"After a week stashed in a growler, its still a pretty good beer. Cloudy pale yellow has just a tinge of pink in the center of the glass.

Shows a little bit of character beyond the standards for the style.",Bayerische Staatsbrauerei Weihenstephan,Germany,Hefeweizen,98
252,731,RedBaron,4.72,"Stellar weissbier beer from ""The World's Oldest Brewery""  Appearance: Muddy gold; Uneven rocky head (nice) Smell: Good banana/apricot and clove mixed with a nice hop aroma. Taste: This beer seems to be all about the yeast. There is a definite malt complexity to this beer, coupled with a smooth and silky wheat texture, but the fruitiness of whatever yeast strain is being used really shines. Nice job guys. Mouthfeel: Nicely balanced weiss beer, through and through. The brewers really want the gardens of Bavaria to linger on the palette with this one. It rides a fine line between chewy and thin. Drinkability: After about 5 sips it becomes evident how special this beer is: not too banana-y, not to clove-y, not too strong, not too weak. Most of all the yeast used in this beer must be a top secret formula -- it just lends such a character to the brew. Crazy good!",Bayerische Staatsbrauerei Weihenstephan,Germany,Hefeweizen,98
252,731,palliko,4.67,"Appearance is hazed orange amber with tons of foam and lacing. Aroma is of lemon, hefe spice, yeast and honeyed malt. Initial taste starts out with warm yeasts, grains, malt, banana esters, citrus and a touch of cloves. Medium body and just-right carbonation. As the taste fades, one is left with a clean palate and the memory of toasted malt, bitter hops, yeast, hazelnuts, anise and ethanol. The benchmark for wheat beer from the worlds oldest brewery.",Bayerische Staatsbrauerei Weihenstephan,Germany,Hefeweizen,98
252,731,RedDiamond,3.65,"First of all, its pretty cool to be able to boast on the label of your beer that youre The Worlds Oldest Brewery. And its pretty cool to have your own brewing university and proprietary yeast strain. And its also pretty neat to actually need to qualify your origins with an A.D. on it, as in, since 1040 A.D. And its also pretty cool that your employees still speak (in German) of that newfangled Reinheitsgebot law. But the big question on my mind is, can these guys go head-to-head with Widmer?  Well, alright, I guess they can. The Weihenstephaner Hefe Weissbier delivers a superb banana nose that segues into pepper and clove. Despite the big, lumpy white head and volatile carbonation, I suspect my bottle was a little fatigued as the flavor seemed to arrive from a distance. The body was sunny chamomile, the flavor infused with the peppery bite of whole cloves and the invigorating tartness of dominant wheat malts.",Bayerische Staatsbrauerei Weihenstephan,Germany,Hefeweizen,98
252,731,mushroomcloud,3.78,"This beer pours out beautifully. It is a pale hazy golden color with a huge 3"" cloudy white head (at least 1"" above the rim of the glass). The head has great retention and left a little lacing.  The smell is of a spicy yeast, some clove, a little chalky with some powdery perfume aroma. The wheat is also prominent in the nose.  The taste is spicy, with a good chewy, bready yeast flavor. A little sourness from the wheat and I picked out some of the characteristic banana notes. This hefe has a medium finish with the spicy, yeasty notes being the longest visitors.  The mouthfeel is relatively soft with some good tongue tingling high carbonation.  Good hefe-weizen. Not my favorite but a very good example. Very refreshing and does the trick on a 100 plus degree bbq-ing day.",Bayerische Staatsbrauerei Weihenstephan,Germany,Hefeweizen,98
252,731,pentathlete,4.33,"Cloudy dark yellow with a monster foamy head that stubbornly held on throughout the tasting, a beauty beer in the big Weizen glass. Nose was citrus rind over a foundation of wheaty yeast (that would be bread, eh?) Taste is pure bliss, with lemon zest, bananas, spices, and a mild carbonic bite. Fine medium body that never let the flavors fall apart. This is one fabulous hefeweizen. This must have decent availability. If you can find it, you should give it a try.",Bayerische Staatsbrauerei Weihenstephan,Germany,Hefeweizen,98
252,731,eclectic,4.42,"Highly carbonated, pours a slightly cloudy golden color with tons of head. Typical hefe aroma, a spicy yeast, banana and clove mixed with just enough citrus.

It pours yellow with some nice orange hues mixed in and slightly cloudy. Lively carbonation that looks great when drank out of the proper hefe glass. Great aroma. Lots of orange, lemon, citrus, and some bready malts. The taste follows the bill exactly. A great thirst quencher. Very impressive.  Hefe weizens are probably my least favorite style of beer, but I have to say I really enjoyed this one. My new favorite hefe and a must try for all you wheat beer lovers out there. I can see why this one is a classic.",Bayerische Staatsbrauerei Weihenstephan,Germany,Hefeweizen,98

Cotton candy, banana and clove, kept in check by a very light hop bitterness Carbonation washes off any sticky remnants leaving a very pleasant taste.

I could spend all day just watching the head dissipate slowly into rolling hills of foam.  It's sweet and spicy; a very well balanced aroma. Cloves and yeast hit first, with banana and citrus coming on with a bit more subtlety. The wheat imparts a nice grassiness...a bit like fresh-mowed hay.  The taste wasn't quite was I was expecting. It's far milder than I anticipated. Soft cloves and banana, and a lot of yeast; the wheat is gentle and smooth. Interesting, but it doesn't overwhelm me.  This is a wonderfully smooth and drinkable beer. Eminently refreshing, it is a perfect complement to a hot, muggy summer evening. I'm not the biggest fan of the style, but this one gets it right.",Bayerische Staatsbrauerei Weihenstephan,Germany,Hefeweizen,98

252,731,GCBrewingCo,4.26,"The beer poured hazy pale golden with a very slight amber hue. The head was white, large, and in charge coating the glass as it slowly retreated from the edge of the glass.  The aroma was very fruity with notable banana, a roundness in the aroma of wheat, and a slight spice of clove. Also some malty sweetness was notable.  The flavor was crisp with a nice dryness and quite a bit of banana fruit flavors. The wheat was noticeable and well done. The spice was very low clove but was present as the banana fruitiness diminshed in the flavor.  The finish was dry with a crisp wheat and slight spice lasting into the aftertaste with hints of that banana fruitiness. The body was medium but seemed lighter due to the higher carbonation levels. The beer was immensely drinkable and well done. I used to not like German Wheat beers, but they have certainly grown on me over the years. This is one of the most popular around.  16.9 ounce bottle.

The aroma is classic hefe weizen with banana and cloves, a little saaz too.  This hefe tastes sweet, with the accent being a banana flavor, the spices and hops give it a nice accent. Finish is clean and crisp.  This feels medium bodied, the carbonation and clean taste leads to a refreshing brew.  As far as drinkability this is a beer that can be enjoyed in looonnnggg session drinking due to it's ease of consumption, moderate ABV and overall refreshing taste.  Overall this is a one heck of a hefe, I'd like to try this on tap. I think this style is better tasting on tap and has more flavor.

The yeasty, clove, estery type odors are more subdued than in other examples of the style. The same can be said for those characteristics on the tongue. Highly carbonated, as it should be.

There is tons of carbonation, but it is difficult to see for the opaque characteristic of this one.  Smell: grassy/grainy. Smells like fresh wheat bread and some acidity similar to grapes.  Taste: Spicy and fruity. The malts break through the many flavors and are delicious. The beer is a little sour to the tongue and the spice remains as an after flavor. Other flavors I can taste remind me of cedar, vanilla, and apples. Really comes together well to make a nice fruity and complex taste.  Mouthfeel: medium body. Carbonation plays with the tongue along with a dry/spicy after feel.  Drinkability: This is one of my favorite drinking beers. It is well balanced, delicious, and I can drink this as well as any beer. In fact it is so good that I wish I had another bottle as the glass is empty.

Not a bad thing at all in my book.  Fantastic rich and aromatic nose. Smells like sweet tomatoes with citrus fruit, herbs, a touch of cloves and bananas. There's a siltiness in there, even. Overall, there's layer after layer. A very nice nose.  Sweet initial flavour flettens out to a savoury taste of bread, finishing with a frefreshing bitter tang. A wonderful hefe. It's really pleasant and refreshing. It has a great deal of rich complexity for something with a relatively standard ABV. The advantage of that is that is supremely drinkable.

The bready yeastiness is quick to the palate followed by sweet fruits and creamy malts. Then a blast of very crisp and clean citrous.

A high pour into an Aventinus glass yields a straw yellow/gold beer with flowing bubbles of medium sized carbonation. This particular glass promotes a fabulous head in a wheat beer, and this is no exception with it's high, proud peak of pure white cloud.  The nose screams lemony citrus tang surrounded by a layer of yeasty, banana funk, chalk, and peppery, clove spice.  Taste is initially zesty lemon/orange, followed by a bit of sweet/sour banana phenols and underlying bready malt and white pepper/clove spice. There's a level of tartness that makes this beer the ultimate summer day refresher.  Mouthfeel is on the light side, as it should be with it's light-medium body. The finish is pleasantly sharp with a slight lemony/citrus bite. Aftertaste is clean and lemony.

It was my intro to the world of real beer when I stumbled upon it accidentally in Freising (fresh from the brewery) where beer is cheaper than soft drink (soda). Bottled version suffers a little from the long journey to Oz. Pours hazy goldish yellow with a HUGE head that retains well. Classic aroma of yeast/bread, bananas and clove which also comes through in the taste in very large measure. Full mouthfeel with medium carbonisation and a yeasty/malty aftertaste that lasts for ages. Did I mention it was smooth and goes down without any resistance? Unable to stop at one.",Bayerische Staatsbrauerei Weihenstephan,Germany,Hefeweizen,98
252,731,SaCkErZ9,4.37,"This is the first heffeweizen I have had with the intent or rating/tasting/savoring the flavor and I am very impressed. The apprearance is slightly hazy as most wheats are. It is a dark straw color. There is a large, foamy head with great body. The smell is clovey and yeasty but quite subtle. As the beer warms, the yeast and clove smell and taste are more pronounced but very well balanced with the overall flavor of the beer. The mouthfeel is great. Slightly tingy and very comfortable. This is a very drinkable beer. I think it would be perfect during a hot summer day at Wrigley or Fenway with a loaded roast beef sandwich or even a Philly Cheese Steak sandwich. Ahhh, how relaxing.",Bayerische Staatsbrauerei Weihenstephan,Germany,Hefeweizen,98
252,731,SetarconeX,3.85,"Visually very good. Nice yellow color, with a hearty, foamy head. Very interesting scent, with a hearty amount of yeast backed up with an odd pungency (other reviewers say phenols, but it's something more than that. Almost like olive juice, but not quite).  Much more subtle taste than you'd expect, with the scent it has. Had to finish half the glass before I could start to properly appreciate it. Yeasty and malty, though there's an odd metallic aftertaste that I don't quite like. Might just be mine, I don't see anyone else mentioning it.  Not a half bad Hefe Weizen. Give it a try",Bayerische Staatsbrauerei Weihenstephan,Germany,Hefeweizen,98
252,731,blitheringidiot,4.07,"Hazy foggy straw hued pour with a scant layer of off white thin head cap.  Bold nose of coriander and cloves. Yeasty bouquet meets the flavor with a bone jarring assault that blends ripe bananas with a soft bread dough. Clean finish with a bit of citrous linger.  Cushy feel. Loads of sudsy carbonation. Damn near full bodied.  Last swigs: If Hefe is your Yen, this is a 5'er! Frothy wheat infused Hefe. The best Hefeweizen I've ever had.",Bayerische Staatsbrauerei Weihenstephan,Germany,Hefeweizen,98
252,731,mgdeth,4.2,"Appearance - Huge fluffy head. Cloudy golden color. The cloudiness intensified when the yeast from the bottom of the bottle made its way to the glass. Head retention is okay, beer lace is minimal.  Smell - Great yeasty and spicy aroma. Malty sweetness hangs out in the background.  Taste - Grainy and spicy. Hops are in there mostly as dressing. The grainy flavor is pretty sweet. This is balanced by a clove/phenolic flavor that I detect more towards the aftertaste. Complex, but unfortunately it does not seem fresh. The taste grows on you.  Mouthfeel - Decent body. At first the beer seemed watery, but it evened out over the time it took me to drink it.  Drinkability - Good drinkability. It improves as it warms.  Comments - This is a good beer. However, I think there are better hefes out there. This one just did not seem to be an ideal summer quencher. Be sure to let it warm up a little bit before you drink it.",Bayerische Staatsbrauerei Weihenstephan,Germany,Hefeweizen,98
252,731,kosmoraios,4.52,"This is an excellent hefe. A prime example of the style, and an ale that others of it's genre should be measured against. Pours an excellent hazy translucent amber, with a large head and deliciously nutty chunks of wheat hanging flecking the head and floating through the ale.  Smell is wheat, nutty yeast, a tinge of caramel, a soupcon of lemon. More develops as it warms, including cashews and pears. Taste is superb. The nuttyness of the yeast is chewy cashews on top of the pears and fructose-sweet caramel. There is a perfect amount of spiciness evident.  Mouthfeel is chewy and carbonated, with a peppery aftertaste. Smooth with a tinge of oiliness. Extraordinarily drinkable. Wonderful, refreshing hefe, well-suited to a warm spring afternoon.",Bayerische Staatsbrauerei Weihenstephan,Germany,Hefeweizen,98
252,731,skybluewater,4.18,"Pours a hazy golden color, with a big head that takes forever to recede. Smell is musty, with a bit of banana and clove. Taste is very nice, definitely refreshing. There's some banana, and the mouthfeel is a bit weak.  While this beer might be better suited for a humid summer night, as opposed to a cold winter night, it's a nice change from both the big beers, and session pale ales. Very nice, and sure to be a refreshing treat come summer.",Bayerische Staatsbrauerei Weihenstephan,Germany,Hefeweizen,98
252,731,santoslhalper,3.11,"Appearence: Pours an oh so gorgeous creamy orange with a thin, sustaining nearly white head.  Smell: The smell is full of fruits. There is also a huge amount of sweet, almost woody notes.  Taste and Mouthfeel: The flavor is not quite as good as it's cracked up to be, in my opinion. There's just nothing special going on. The hops taste kind of artificial, and take away from the goodness of the fruits. The creamy mouthfeel helps render this problem a little but, but not enough.  Drinkability and Overall: What is that hop flavor? It's pretty disgusting. The more I drink of this beer, the less I want to continue drinking it. This is an overrated beer for sure. Even though you're the world's oldest brewery, that doesn't mean you're any better than the new ones.",Bayerische Staatsbrauerei Weihenstephan,Germany,Hefeweizen,98
252,731,mynie,4.96,"Fantastic!  Pours a pretty dark orange haze with a nice, fully retentive head.  Smells of strong wheatmalt, cloves, allspice, ginger, and banana. One of the most complex and wonderful smells I've ever come across. Truly something to behold.  Big splash of banana upfront, followed up quickly by a bevy of spices and then the best tasting wheatmalt I've ever had. Just rounded enough, just spicy enough...it's almost perfect! Dry in the back with more fruit, making way for a nice white pepper aftertaste. Wonderful.  Smooth as silk, too. Perfect body. Goes down easy.  Excellent, excellent beer.  I took my ladyfriend out to a chocolate and wine shop for our anniversary. I got to sit and drink this stuff and eat chocolate and I'd never felt like more a fancylad in my life and it was wonderful.",Bayerische Staatsbrauerei Weihenstephan,Germany,Hefeweizen,98
252,731,malty,4.75,"Poured from a 16.9 oz. elongated bottle with the yeast swirled and poured-in also - no freshness date.  A soapy golden color radiates below a pure white fluffy craggy head.  Smell of honey drenched malt with just the right amount of clove and a tad bit of sour notes. FRESH, FRESH, FRESH!!!  Taste: There's that honey-dipped wheat malt again. Earthy yeasts, banana, bubblegum, clove, slight hint of pepper and again - that quenching slight sourness. All these flavor burst at the beginning and the finish mellows but lasts forever.  Mouthfeel is spritzy and soft. The tongue continously tingles as this beer enters your mouth. A perfect balance of acidity and full-on maltiness.  Drinkability is high as this beer is practically flawless. I enjoy this beer year round, but May-August - fahgit abah dit!!!  Overall a stellar brew! My hands-down favorite bottled wheat beer, period. Unfortunately it's hard to find on tap in the Mid-Michigan area. The one time I had it in Ann Arbor (U of M country) - it blew me away!! The king of Bavarian style wheat beers!!",Bayerische Staatsbrauerei Weihenstephan,Germany,Hefeweizen,98
252,731,afatty,4.65,"Excellent beer that suffers from $2.50 pint night pour. Very little head in a ""regular"" pint glass. A little work with a straw after a few sips brings the head to life and awakens the hidden aromas developed in this beer. Still not a great presentation for this wheat monster that defines the style for me. Slightly cloudy with dark straw/ amber color. Truly a great summertime beer. But, when it's 65 degrees in February.. it just feels like summer. Malt/fruit flavor complimented by spice/citrus. One of a very few non-killer-hoppy beers that I could drink every day and that I actually keep in the beer frig. Choice is good. Starting a new UFO card does have it's advantages. 3 down, 197 to go.",Bayerische Staatsbrauerei Weihenstephan,Germany,Hefeweizen,98
252,731,GClarkage,4.35,"02/01/05- Purchased at Beverages and More in San Mateo, CA  Presentation- 16.9oz bottle with a code of 7154 on the back label. Poured into my Ayinger Weisen glass.  Appearance- A cloudy golden pour with a 3/4 inch large bubbled head and acceptable lacing.  Smell- Typical hefe scents. A good amount a clove action with some sweet banana scents and maybe a tad of vanilla.  Taste- Nice and sweet tasting brew. A very heavy clove taste and creamy banana background.  Mouthfeel- Left my mouth pretty dry. Although it was fairly creamy going down. Moderate carbonation level on this one.  Drinkability- Finally got around to the #1 ranked Weissbeer. I'm not sure if I like it as much or more than Paulaner, but it's pretty damn close. This beer was a tremendous thirst quencher and the sweetness worked well. Wish I had a Paulaner to sample after this. Either way, a great beer with a good price tag ($2.49) Will be a regualr of mine in the years to come.",Bayerische Staatsbrauerei Weihenstephan,Germany,Hefeweizen,98
252,731,mmmbeer,4.45,"500 mL bottle with a batch number but no freshness date. Pours into the weizen glass a bright yellowish-orange with a 3-4 inch head which forces you to wait several minutes to fit the whole thing in the glass. By the time the glass is full the head is beautiful - rocky with small bubbles and poking more than an inch above the rim of the glass. Adding the yeast makes it a cloudy golden orange/brown. Reduces to a nice layer of foam that leaves slight lacing. Scents are bananas, spiciness, pepper, phenols, lemon, and maybe some vanilla. The beer is pretty thick and tastes like banana, pepper, and citrus (lemon/orange) with a low level of hops. I might have served the beer a bit too warm or released a lot of the carbonation during the poor because it is not as crisp as I remember. I could drink several of these bottles (which at about $2.50 is easy to do) but I'll remember to serve it a little cooler next time. Would be much better on a hot summer day than this snowy evening.",Bayerische Staatsbrauerei Weihenstephan,Germany,Hefeweizen,98
252,731,bceaglejoe,4.41,"Purchased as a 16oz bottle from Marty's Liquors, Allston, Mass., 28 January 2005.  This beer impressed me right from the first pour. It created a very thick head in my 20oz pint glass - I'm guessing this would probably be served better in a proper Hefe Weizen glass. The beer itself was very cloudy, almost to the point of opaqueness. The scent suggested vanilla and malt, with virtually no hop aroma.  This beer was exceptionally light in texture, and it went down very smoothly. A lemon flavor hit my tongue right about the middle, balanced by malt smoothness. There was no hop bitterness at all in this beer.  I would rate this as highly drinkable. One could certainly have several of these in a row. I recommend this as a great crossover for those who are looking to explore the world of better beer.",Bayerische Staatsbrauerei Weihenstephan,Germany,Hefeweizen,98
252,731,whartontallboy,4.62,"Cloudy golden pour with nice head of little bubbles. Aroma is predominantly malt wheat but I also catch some lemon, vanilla, and maybe a little sweet corn and grass in the nose. Very pleasant. Taste is nice and yeasty, but the lemon is there as well, with a little hint of vanilla in the finish. Mouthfeel is very light, maybe a tad too carbonated for my taste. Overall, though, I love this one. I hadn't had a hefeweizen in a few months, and I'm glad I picked this one to come back to the style.",Bayerische Staatsbrauerei Weihenstephan,Germany,Hefeweizen,98
252,731,Luigi,4.83,"Hmm, what can I say about this beer. Pours a cloudy orange color. The head is a big and white sticky head that sticks all over the glass. Sweet malt, lemon, and yeast dominate the aroma. Has a medium mouthfeel. Citrus, sweet malt, clove, banana bread, and a small amount a hop bitterness come out in the flavor. The yeast stays around for a while too. This is by far my favorite Hefe-Weisse beer!",Bayerische Staatsbrauerei Weihenstephan,Germany,Hefeweizen,98
252,731,stjarnflikka,4.7,"Pours a hazy and somewhat orange beer with quite some carbonation. Theres a nice foam that leaves quite hasty and the beer looks great in its own glass.  Smell is malty and massively fruity. There are citric traces of oranges and pomerans that blends perfectly with the yeasty, big smell.  Taste is sweet, fruity, filling and delicious. Yeast comes first with light and fruity traces. Then comes citric tones with a musty and powerful sweetness that really is perfect. Carbonation is perfect and this beer is really good.  Just the greatest hefe weizen, perfect taste, perfect feel and i can drink these all night long.",Bayerische Staatsbrauerei Weihenstephan,Germany,Hefeweizen,98
252,731,Backer2004,4.3,"First time I've tried a Hefe Weissbier that was not home brewed and wow!!, was I impressed this evening. Received this in a Beers of the World 10 pack and this has easily been the best by far. Hazy, dark golden colored, with an incredible head and carbonation. Smells and tastes of vanilla and banana that went down very easy. May have found one of my new favorite styles. Try this one out!!!",Bayerische Staatsbrauerei Weihenstephan,Germany,Hefeweizen,98
252,731,Sammy,3.95,"An easy pleasant drink, light on taste yet not thin on mouthfeel. Nice aroma wheat with some vanilla. Smooth though not creamy. Nicely malted.

252,731,mobyfann,4.33,"Paid $1.99 for a half-liter bottle...  The beer pours a hazy golden base with a very large white head, the head becomes lumpy and is visually stunning. The retention is phenominal and the lacing is very nice. The aroma was solid with tines of yeast, malt, banana, lemony goodness.  The taste wasn't strong but the smell gave away what was in my mouth, all of the above, but including cloves and honey? The mouthfeel is an good as it gets, this didn't feel like a beer in the mouth. The drinkability is also exceptional, a 5.4% is so smooth, this feels like a light hefe...  Final Thought: Very impressive beer, this and Franizkaner are the leading Hefe's in Germany.",Bayerische Staatsbrauerei Weihenstephan,Germany,Hefeweizen,98
252,731,merlin48,4.33,"16.9 oz bottle pours a cloudy, medium straw yellow body with an enormous, vanilla head that is rocky and pillowy, longlasting, with some patchy lace in its wake. Aroma is surprisingly complex to my nose, with wheat grain, spicy clove and white pepper, and an unusual lemony banana note. Highly carbonated mouthfeel has a clove spiciness and medium body. Taste: This one really surprised me with its complexity of flavors. Wheat, mild coriander, white pepper, lemon banana, vanilla, a note of clove, all meld with the carboantion. The yeastiness, when swirled in, adds some ""Cream of Wheat"" slickness to the mouthfeel. Finish is crisp, with a lemony citrus aftertaste. This Hefe will be a staple in my fridge next spring and summer. Really nails down the style with a high quality and excellent drinkability.",Bayerische Staatsbrauerei Weihenstephan,Germany,Hefeweizen,98

The taste was a robust it was toasted malt with a wisp of grass in the background. It was medium bodied and oily with a dryish finish. I have to put this right behind Schneiders HW, so I'm sure I will be having some more.",Bayerische Staatsbrauerei Weihenstephan,Germany,Hefeweizen,98
252,731,Quaffer,4.59,"16.9 oz. bottle. Picked this up in Missouri. Not available here in Wichita.  Appearance: Started off a pale, golden yellow. However, with the addition of the sediment, this beer became an extremely cloudy, murky golden brown. The white head was huge and dissipated at a normal rate, becoming fluffy as it did so. A decent layer of bubbles remained floating on the beer for the entire pint. Lacing was surprisingly minimal.  Smell: Pure hefeweizen. Strong raw grains provided a solid foundation. On top of this was lemon zest and mandarin orange, with hints of sweet vanilla, banana, and clove. A full aroma, but it still had a nice crispness to it.  Mouthfeel: Medium-bodied with a chewy graininess. Crisp and light, without being thin and watery.  Taste: Damn, this is good stuff. A full bodied, raw wheat component kicked in immediately and didn't ever let up. Even on the aftertaste, you could feel and taste the grain along the sides of the tongue. This was the main component and was only lightly complimented by some lemon and orange in the middle and light banana and spices on the finish. Slightly astringent grain flavor in the aftertaste.  This is one of my absolute favorite hefes, and one of my favorite overall beers as well. I love the fact that it is all wheat, and that the other flavors are just there to compliment the taste, not take over and become the dominant flavors. This stuff is wonderful on-tap, too. One of the handfull of beers that I like on-tap as much as I like it from the bottle.",Bayerische Staatsbrauerei Weihenstephan,Germany,Hefeweizen,98
252,731,BrewMaster,3.92,"Appearance: Poured from a 12 oz bottle into a Leffe chalice. It pours a semi-clear golden orange color with a white fizzy head that thins to almost nothing in less than 60 seconds. It has champagne like carbonation dancing to the surface of the beer.  Smell: Sweet alcohol, wheat, plae malt sweetness, citrus perhaps tangerine, and a sweet floral note.  Taste: The first thing I notice is a big sweet flavor. Notes of banana, cream, lemon, sandy leaf, and a bready maltiness. There's also a light hop bitterness in the middle that is barely noticable. A fruity aftertaste lingers.  Mouthfeel: It's a bit fizzy in the mouth making it less smooth and more combative going down.  Drinkability & Notes: A good hefe weizen but certainly not the best. The carbonation of this beer seems to be where it loses some style. It is very drinkable and if faced witha choice I may consider it again. It will not be a beer a I look for though.",Bayerische Staatsbrauerei Weihenstephan,Germany,Hefeweizen,98

252,731,NearerMyBeerToMe,4.33,"The head is a Solid Thing. I mean, the top of the head remains parallel with the rim of the glass when I tilt it. Jeez. Tiny, fluffy bubbles of eggshell white string out into webs that slide back into the liquid after a swirl. Ample carbonation, medium clarity to this ochre brew with pumpkin-yellow highlights. Yeast pour adds a nice murk. Smells like floating face-down in a vat of tapioca or banana cream pie. Malt aromas conjure buttermilk biscuits with fruit syrup and whipped cream; finishes with a hint of nutmeg (?) where I would prefer more spice. Light, smooth, appetizingly dry nosefeel. Taste it... unhhh. Banana cream with banana syrups and liqueurs. Full, dried apple body supporting impossibly rich pureed bananas, french vanilla, Bananas Foster, banana breakfasts, etc... to a finish of fresh plums and black pepper. Wonderful, but again I want spice. Exceptionally viscous and savory body starts creamy and full on the tongue, developing a wheaty wetness and light carbonation, ends dry. The brew seems geared towards filling a belly rather than quenching a thirst. Awesome hefeweizen, 964 years in the making.",Bayerische Staatsbrauerei Weihenstephan,Germany,Hefeweizen,98
252,731,hero27,3.95,"Pours a dark opaque brown. Head retention is nice. Pungent cloves and peppery smell. Sharp banana flavor compliments the spicy flavors well.

Aroma: Huge fruity aroma, with a bready malt lingering on the edge.  Flavor/Body: Lots of yeasty spiciness, with full fruit flavors waiting in the middle. Banana esters dominate. Clove phenols are stronger than many weissbiers. Very highly carbonated, and delightfully thirst quenching.  I had my first Weihenstephan weiss about 6 or 7 years ago. Weiss beers had been one of my favorite styles for several years at that point, and discovering this, possibly the pinnacle of the style, was a revelation. I love it especially with breakfast.

This great elixer poured a perfect hazy golden color with a great big fluffy white head that slowly faded into a slight layer of froth on top the beer. The smell was so good I could have sniffed it all night long! It had a great spice character along with a room filling aroma of clove and bananna and a great bready character as well. The taste was heavenly and just erupted in my mouth with a nice citrus twang in the beginning, followed by a rush of bananna, clove, malt and a great prickely mouthfeel that seemed to excentuate the flavors.

Best before 5/25/05, I opened it on 9/24/04.  Pours a handsome cloudy orangish-gold under a 1.5 finger white head with good contour and decent staying power. Just a few spots of lace adorn the glass, though. The nose is sublime, fruit and spice in a mild blend that makes the taste buds yearn for a sip. The mouth is very well-balanced, both prickly and syrupy heavy, coating the entire mouth cavity with luscious sensation. The taste doesn't quite live up to the introduction, coming down a bit too heavy on the wheat, without enough of the accompanying spice. Still, a fine tasting beer. An airy feel characterizes the finish, as a bit of spice, and a hint of hops, come through. The aftertaste is all wheat, leaving the jowls feeling full long after the liquid is gone. Nice, yes indeed, nice.",Bayerische Staatsbrauerei Weihenstephan,Germany,Hefeweizen,98

I tasted Hacker-Pschorr Weisse the same day as this and they are remarkably similar.

But I'm still not fond of hefewiezens. Albeit this hefe I found respect for and would not mind another one. It poured a dark gold in color and was murky/cloudy. There was a slight head that went away quickly. The wheat was not too sugary--which is why I think I am not very fond of hefe.

Seriously, from a brewing perspective; most hefeweizen yeast strains that produce all the hefes in the world can call this beer its grandparent. Pours a hazy orangy-gold color with a nice off white head, but dies a bit quicker than some other hefes. Heavy on the clove and the banana is pungent and ripe smelling. Nice and malty, and its yeastiness leaves a resiny lemon feel in the finish; no need for the addition of one. Pretty darn refreshing.

On the back end, just a light taste of the grain. Mouth feel is very light. The drinkability? I could have 10 of these. This defines a summer beer, and the Hefeweizen style.

252,731,Admiraldinty,4.4,"This is one of the great hefeweizens. Pours cloudy golden orange with an enormous white, sticky head. Aroma is sweetly malty, very light spice, yeast, and lemon. Big hefe taste - malty, yeasty, very little hops, and some clove and lemon. Semi-crisp and nutty. I really enjoy this hefe, however it is on the pricier end of the spectrum, thus it loses in drinkability. I tend to think Paulaner is a better value, although this is better quality.",Bayerische Staatsbrauerei Weihenstephan,Germany,Hefeweizen,98
252,731,bigbeerdrinka,4.53,"Pours a deep cloudy amber, with some dark copper tones. A billowing white head forms about an inch high with a really nice lace. Initial aromas are of sweetness, wheat, bubblegum, and clove. A nice combination of aromas. For flavor this beer packs a punch on the pallate. Initially this beer hits up front with a nice combination of wheat sweetness, a little bubblegum, and some slight spice. Following a nice lemon zest hits, with some nice yeast flavors. This beer finishes with a nice spice and a little sweetness, with the perfect amount of carbonation. Overall just a treat to drink.",Bayerische Staatsbrauerei Weihenstephan,Germany,Hefeweizen,98
252,731,cbl2,4.07,"Appearance:  Typical cloudy yellow with a quarter inch of head that vanished as the bartender placed the pint before me.  Smell:  Beautiful sweet citrus-banana and clove aroma. Very reminiscent of a Willy Wonka  Runts.  Taste/Mouthfeel:  One of the spicier hefeweizens I've encountered, with an almost overpowering banana aspect that reminds me of a banana split minus the nuts. Very creamy mouthfeel for the style. Goes down smooth and leaves you wanting more.  I've been hearing a lot of good things about this beer recently, and coincidently happened upon it, while out in Hoboken to catch a Joseph Arthur show at Maxwell's.",Bayerische Staatsbrauerei Weihenstephan,Germany,Hefeweizen,98
252,731,studentofbeer,4.45,"The beer is a classic hefeweizen  the nose has hugely strong clove and banana aromatics, sweet and spicy and way more pronounced than any of the other weizens I've looked at so far.  The color also is exactly what I'd expect with a nice orange hue and a thick white head. The clove and banana flavor carry through to the taste, but it's not overwhelming. The wheat really shines in this beer, giving a clean acidity to the whole profile and making it a definite thirst quencher. The carbonation seems thicker as well, with bigger bubbles. Rather than being creamy, this beer really has a more soda pop carbonation that tickles the mouth.  This is definitely one of the best hefeweizens I've had, though they all have their unique aspects. This beer definitely seems very traditional with the strong clove and banana smell and flavor and an excellent tart wheat profile.",Bayerische Staatsbrauerei Weihenstephan,Germany,Hefeweizen,98
252,731,tjd25,4.18,"Thick fluffy and creamy head on a nicely hazy golden orange color body. The head last forever and remains incredibly regular and dense the whole time. The smell is greatly wheaty and yeasty. Sweet bananas are noticeabl but not overwhelming. The taste shows a good balance of the traditional flavors of a hefe weizen, nicely sweet and fruity with bananas, nicely wheaty and yeasty; the pronounced citric character is my only reason to complain. Mouthfeel is very smooth and round. There's not that much to say about this beer. It's good, it's a great and harmonious balanced. It's enjoyable to drink.",Bayerische Staatsbrauerei Weihenstephan,Germany,Hefeweizen,98
252,731,CarolinaCardinals,4.45,"Sampled this from the gentleman from the Weihenstephaner brewery at AJ's in late May. Learned much about their famous yeast that is used world wide. Darn good sample which led me to purchase a 16.9 ounce bottle.  This cloudy golden orange brew poured a 2 inch fluffy head that did not leave any lacing. The nose was of cloves, banana, and maybe honey. The taste is about as smooth as I have had in the beers I have sampled. It was comparable to a blend of banana bread with a fine wheat beer. The mouthfeel was extremely lively on the palate, refreshing and cleansing but a bit thin. This is about as drinkable as a beer gets.",Bayerische Staatsbrauerei Weihenstephan,Germany,Hefeweizen,98
252,731,PorterLambic,3.8,"A 2"" head of fine, dense bubbles over a cloudy straw color. Head stayed as I drank through most of the glass with a coarse lacing. Smells of citrus, a kind of malty sweetness & grass. Taste is lemony, some spice (clove?), nicely effervescent with banana esters kicking in later and becoming more noticeable as the brew warmed up. Complex and fairly well balanced, although the banana got a bit much for me at the end. Aftertaste was like liquid banana bread. A medium body, smooth but not quite creamy feel. Very drinkable, a great flavor, a great thirst quencher.",Bayerische Staatsbrauerei Weihenstephan,Germany,Hefeweizen,98
252,731,gentlebubbles,3.88,"Hazy tangerine under a towering, creamy white dense foam. Sweet, spicy scent. Foam tastes like clove. When the head subsides allowing access to the beer, I find more clove than I would like. I can admire its fresh and lively quality, amid the tartness and the tangy lemon finish. Despite the harsh, biting carbonation, it still goes down pretty easily.",Bayerische Staatsbrauerei Weihenstephan,Germany,Hefeweizen,98
252,731,niall,3.78,"Pouring this into a pint glass spins mere straw into foaming, messy gold if you're not careful. This is pretty brash, but quite complex for the style, with a lively spice/sweetness interplay that I'd normally associate with Belgian white ales. On its own, a cloying, boozed-up banana flavour, while not altogether unsatisfactory, threatens to overpower the wheat (and... cloves? coriander notes? aren't those dissonant and verboten in Germany?), but that sweetness pairs most gratifyingly with hot foods. I'll bet you can make pretty great pancakes with this beer.  I can't think of any summertime meal that wouldn't profit from having this beer on hand. Get a few bottles for your next grill event.",Bayerische Staatsbrauerei Weihenstephan,Germany,Hefeweizen,98
252,731,rdrummer,4.97,Poured in a 17-ounce Hefe glass with the Weihenstephaner label. The beer poured a perfect temperature and with the appropriately large head. The beer is a lovely hazy golden brew with tremendous lacing.  The aroma is one of blissful wheatfields. The malted wheat is the overwhelming sense of a great Hefe with just a slight hint of citrus and clove. This is the best Hefe I have tried. The taste is of almost pure malted wheat. It is rich and earthy with a closing hint of citrus. The taste is at once simple but deeply fulfilling.  It is somewhat heavy in the mouth but cleansing and refreshing. On a hot day this proves to be the perfect beer. The experience is one that I will be repeating often.,Bayerische Staatsbrauerei Weihenstephan,Germany,Hefeweizen,98
252,731,silenius,3.15,"I realize it is a superficial gripe, but I don't like the labeling on this beer. The actual large label proclaiming Weihenstephaner in blue, white, and gold is nice, but I don't like the wrap around label on the neck. I don't particularly know why, though. Maybe it looks like a leg warmer on a beer, maybe it is becuase it looks contrived, or maybe I feel it is too slick or something.  Regardless, this beer pours a hazy yellow with brown and orange tints that glow in the light. The head is big, although I've seen bigger, and lasts a respectible amount of time. The beer bubbles like hell, too. Looking into the beer it almost looks like it is boiling.  The nose starts with equal parts slightly green banana and clove, but as it warms the clove predominates. A hint of bubblegum peeks through in the back. It smells rather sweet to me. Floral and nice.  A soft and light banana hits at first then is whisked away by the biting carbonation. This biting carbonation is a real negative in my book. A slight clove and sweet and juicy bubblegum sneaks in as well, but everything is dominated by the harsh tasting carbonation. This is like seltzer water. I'm gonna hafta knock points for that.  Mouthfeel is too biting and sharp for what I think should be a smooooth beer.  I'll drink what's in the fridge, but I'll be thinking about other beer.",Bayerische Staatsbrauerei Weihenstephan,Germany,Hefeweizen,98
252,731,jimdkc,4.28,"Pours a hazy gold, slightly darker than most hefe's, with a large white head with pretty good retention. Smell is yeasty with a little banana aroma. Taste is bready wheat and yeast with banana with maybe a little citrus in the background. Smooth, creamy mouthfeel. Goes down really easy! Up until now, my favorite hefe has been Paulaner... I'd be hard pressed to pick a favorite now! The Weihenstephaner has a more prominent banana flavor, while the Paulaner is more lemony. Both are great!",Bayerische Staatsbrauerei Weihenstephan,Germany,Hefeweizen,98
252,731,thinkbreakfast,4.03,"Appearance: Almost opaque orange. Good head which sticks around well throughout.  Smell: The aroma of fruit comes through. I mainly detected a banana like scent. Spice as well.  Taste: As alluded to by the smell, the taste starts off with malty sweetness. The sweetness is briefly followed by a low level crisp bite. This bite in the middle creates an enjoyable balance. Slight alcohol in the finish. There is a dryness present also. --As the beer warms, a crisp/sour taste comes out. Very nice.  Mouthfeel: Thick on the tongue. Little or no aftertaste.  Drinkability: I could see myself drinking a few of these. However, I think a need for hops would take over eventually.  This beer tastes better at a warmer temperature.",Bayerische Staatsbrauerei Weihenstephan,Germany,Hefeweizen,98
252,731,Beastdog75,3.55,"Many fans of wheat beer consider Weihenstephan's Hefe Weissbier to be the #1 wheat beer in the world. Is it a good wheat beer? Why, certainly. The best in the world? Hmmm...  This brew pours a hazy yellowish-gold color with an orange hue. A decent foamy head forms and lasts for about 2 minutes. The aroma is mostly of bananas, with some wheaty notes and mild spices present. The beer feels moderately carbonated, which is a bit typical for the style. I would have to say the most dominant flavor is the fruity/banana presence, although there is a nice wheaty ""twang"" and some very pleasant toasted wheat flavors present in the brew. The classic ""hefe clove"" flavors were a bit low in my opinion and were almost absent. There is a low moderate dryness in the finish, which carries over into the aftertaste along with some more wheaty flavors. The brew concludes with no alcoholic warmth.  This is a pleasant drink and very refreshing, but I expected a bit more from a beer that is held in such a high regard. Perhaps I expected it to be a bit more complex, but in the end this was a bit more forgettable than I thought it would be. A good, above average hefeweizen.",Bayerische Staatsbrauerei Weihenstephan,Germany,Hefeweizen,98
252,731,usualpulp,4.77,"This beer pours a nice cloudy orange color with a thick fluffy white head, much like most german hefe's.  The smell of the beer is great, the wheat comes right out, and is backed up with a malty smell, and some yeast.  The taste is exceptional. Very strong wheat and yeast flavors, with a slight hop bitterness, and spiceyness. The malt flavor is very well balanced. The beer is backed by a slight lemony and grassy tone, but the big thing here is the wheat and yeast.  The mouthfeel is nice, crisp, clean, smooth, nothing short of great.  Overall I would rank this as one of my favorite of the style, if not my most favorite. This is one beer I could drink all day.",Bayerische Staatsbrauerei Weihenstephan,Germany,Hefeweizen,98
252,731,finepaws,4.67,"This was a new try for me. I was amazed at the smell and flavor. Very banana like. Did not expect it at all. Banana flavored anything is a favorite of mine, so imagine my surprise to find it in my beer. The aftertaste, and quite after, was almost grassy. It is the strangest combination in tastes that I have found in a beer. It was a bit frothy, and I seemed to do a lot of mouth smacking afterwards, but it was light enough to enjoy on a hot evening with friends. Very different from my normal stout, or porter choice. Since most of my friends drink wine or macros, I offered this one around for a taste. Everyone was pleased, now they have to figure out how to pronounce it so they can find it to buy it.",Bayerische Staatsbrauerei Weihenstephan,Germany,Hefeweizen,98

Smell is spicy, peppery, cloves, tart apricots, lemon, cut grass, and some ash. Polished flavor flaunts its stuff - wheat gives twang, munich malts give a grainy sweetness, yeast gives smoothness but also spicy phenolics, hops are there more to balance than to provide much flavor. Medium light body with spritzy carbonation, and rediculously drinkable. I had my doubts beforehand, but I am sold. This is wonderful.",Bayerische Staatsbrauerei Weihenstephan,Germany,Hefeweizen,98

Fully malty up front. Rounded cookie dough, but not necessarily sweet. Bananas too. And loads of them, sprinkled with powdered sugar and vanilla. Spice arrives in waves. Clove is foremost, but ginger and white pepper are clearly noted. Emblematic W'stephaner yeast, like lime sorbet. Minor herbal hop notations at the close. Medium-hewn with rippling carbonation.

252,731,psyco1,3.58,"It pours out a nice cloudy gold like a wheat beer should with a white-cream colored head about one and a half to two inches thick. It stays for quite a while. It has a very thick lacing as the head dissipates over time.  There's a banana yeast smell over everything, almost like a banana nut bread without the nutmeg. I think they'd go great together.  The taste wasn't too far from the smell, banana and yeast with a bit of citrus and maybe some spices.  It has a very substantial feel to it, nice.  Personaly, I prefer wheat beer to have more of a citrus taste to it, but this isn't too bad, I could drink one once in a while for a change.",Bayerische Staatsbrauerei Weihenstephan,Germany,Hefeweizen,98
252,731,Gavage,4.33,"Slighty cloudy golden color with a nice big 2"" head. The aroma was of wheat and banana, bit not overly strong. The flavor was much bigger as the wheat, banana, grain, citrus, and light spiciness made the tastebuds very happy. Mildly tangy.  Smooth mouthfeel with a slightly dry finish that was quite clean. Nice carbonation levels. Light and refreshing. Very enjoyable hefe that can be quaffed all day long.",Bayerische Staatsbrauerei Weihenstephan,Germany,Hefeweizen,98

252,731,UncleJimbo,4.1,"Sampled on tap at Redbones.  This hefeweizen poured a cloudy, golden color with white foam that settled. The smell was a very nice: banana, cloves, wheat malt. The taste was fruity banana and wheat malt with a slight sweetness. The flavors of yeast and caramel or toffee were also evident. There was a bit of hops in the finish, and an overall tanginess. The mouthfeel was smooth with medium body and medium carbonation. The flavors of banana and yeast lingered pleasantly.

252,731,99bottles,4.4,"This beer was served in a 22 ounce pilsner with a slice of lemon on the side. I politely tossed it aside, for this beer needs no assitance from slices of fruit. Appearance: The beer is almost orange. Very cloudy deep yellow that really is closer to orange. Nice frothy white head of about and inch that lasted for quite some time. Smell: Wow. That's a hefeweizen for sure. Heavy yeast smell, with some malted wheat and citrus, most notably oranges and lemon. Taste: Ahhh. Exactly what I'm looking for. Great balance of classic spice and unfiltered goodness. The wheat malt is really left to speak for itself, as the clove and light corriander play around more in the aftertaste. Very yeasty, very earthy. Taste of damp grass. Incredible. Mouthfeel: Light and refreshing, but with the yeast it is somewhat heavier and satisfying. Drinkability: Not exactly one I would drink non stop, but instead a good one to sip on and quench your thirst. Very excellent indeed. A great example for others to follow.",Bayerische Staatsbrauerei Weihenstephan,Germany,Hefeweizen,98

Smells great, lots of banana and citrus in the nose... fresh cut flowers... very fragrant.  The flavor is sweet and malty with accents of banana and has a very spicy crisp finish.  Mouthfeel is medium to full and carbonated perfectly. Goes down nice and smooth.

It has that banana aroma that is sweet and inviting. The taste is great also. It is crisp and sweet with a bold fruity malt/yeast flavor that finishes very refreshing. The mouthfeel is good. It is a medium bodied beer with good carbonation. This is a great hefe. So many hefes taste watered down and weak, but not this one.

Crisp and refreshing with tingly carbonation. The flavor is very nice. Citrus is a good addition to the cloves and bananas. Yeast flavor adds a really nice touch as well as light grains.

The smell is dominated by pineapple and spice, with a very very yeasty, bready undertone. The taste is crisp and slightly dry at first, with some hops letting themselves be known before being totally inundated by a menagerie of fruit and spice notes. Pineapple and cloves are notable in the flavor, and as the brew increases in sweetness toward the end, a nice little anise/fennel/licorice note adds a very special something to the brew. Mouthfeel is nice. A bit chewy but, being an American, I could have used a bit more carbonation. Drinkability is fine, though I am not sure that I cold deal with more than a few at a time. A good beer. A stupendous hefe. I'll need to try this brewery's other offerings.",Bayerische Staatsbrauerei Weihenstephan,Germany,Hefeweizen,98
252,731,Foxman,4.35,"It pours a hazy honey gold. A healthy finger of white head clambers upward and persists nicely, then dwindles to a wispy froth.  Lightly sweet malt dances sweetly in the aroma, along with a fresh clove presence. The yeast yields a notion of sourdough at the edges. Vague berry fruit notes carry to the close and fade gently.  On first sip, a somewhat thin sweetness of malt is well matched by a gracious clove character. Mild but brisk citrus fruit notes move in, along with a distant berry essence, both well-placed on the heels of the spice. The finish plays out with a yeast-driven mild sourness holding hands with an indistinct but veritable bitterness. Simply, eveything about the flavor says refreshing.  A bit north of light bodied, it seems almost to glow in the mouth. It leaves its flavor and slips away cleanly, haiving established its identity.  There's nothing especially complicated here, and that goes toward making this so good. Each element does yeoman's work and ends up being fresh and refreshing. Good anytime, the idea of quenching a summer's thirst is appealing indeed. It drinks with no effort and continues doing so well past a couple bottles. During the best of times, or the worst of times, this shows that wheat is good. And in this case, damned good.",Bayerische Staatsbrauerei Weihenstephan,Germany,Hefeweizen,98

Poured out a hazy orange with a decent head on it that continues towards the end. Smell consisted of some orange and spices. Taste was very exceptional. Some malts kick in softly at first then some citrus notes hit mixed in with some hops. Some lemon in there too, but very little of it. Finishes off with some bananas and cloves with some alochol and spices mixed in for some balance. Truly an amazing beer. One of the best money can buy. This would be perfect on a hot summer day.

Sweet up front, a large yeasty-based body, clean, ever so smooth, rich in taste - spices, cloves, traces of lemon, delicate touch of pepper as she warms, wheat, barley malt, hop detection, it's all there.

Taste is very mellow and smooth. Bananas, oranges, cloves and a nice hops finish make this a very delicious beer, and a steal at $2 for a pint bottle.

Definite tropical fruit/banana esters in there too. Taste starts off with a dose of cloves, then melds into a nice vanilla type flavor with some slight graininess in there. No nasty clove aftertaste, a definite plus in my book. Full taste without being overwhelming in any area. Mouthfeel is not thin, but just thick enough to keep it silky, with just enough carbonation.

This is classic German wheat, straight from the oldest brewery in the world (1040).  Taste  This is the taste that many an American brewery has tried unsuccessfully to imitate. The light yeast flavor is incredibly smooth here. Its not singular and strung out like most efforts of the style. Its tight and complex with a lightly sweetened orange finish.  Mouthfeel  Wonderfully carbonated just as the style demands. The carbonation is big and fluffy yet the bier is medium-bodied. If you swish this in your mouth the carbonation explodes. This is excellent.  Drinkability  Its not easy to find, but this is an authentic representation of the style and is terrific to drink during the day or in between meals.  Update  Its been a full year since I first reviewed this weizen, so I thought Id take another stab at it after writing reviews for a year.  I feel the same way now as I did then. This hefe is just terrific. Its one of the few imports that take me back to Bayern where I lived for six years. Zum wohl!",Bayerische Staatsbrauerei Weihenstephan,Germany,Hefeweizen,98
252,731,ALESwhatCURESya,4.18,"I have to admit, was not the biggest Weiss beer, but man did this one change it for me. I just love the appearance that this beer gives off. It is a beautiful cloudy butter color and the aroma is explosive. When this stuff hits your mouth, a sweet wheaty taste lines your tongue and the finish is very crisp. I could pick up a tiny hint of alcohol taste but the sweetness matched it well. This truly shocked me since I normally don't like this style of beer. Two thumbs up!",Bayerische Staatsbrauerei Weihenstephan,Germany,Hefeweizen,98
252,731,SilentSabre,4.12,"This was quite good indeed...if, of course, you enjoy Hefeweissen. It had the characteristic peachy/orange-ish/cloudiness of a Hefe. Likewise, it was also quite spicy, aswell, and remniscent of cloves and nutmeg. Medium amount of carbonation lets you know you're drinking beer, but doesn't have the ""sting"" of something like Sprite. Goes down pretty smooth and leaves a nice, pleasant taste in your mouth. This one seemed a bit sweeter than other Hefeweissen I have had in the past. Not sickeningly sweet, just a wee bit sweeter than say, Franziskaner. All-in-all, I really enjoied it and would certainly spend money on this again.",Bayerische Staatsbrauerei Weihenstephan,Germany,Hefeweizen,98
252,731,koolk,4.62,"Cloudy/hazy vibrant orange with a thick creamy white head that is ever persistant. Firm carbonation.  Strong, full aromas of banana, cloves, yeast, bread and spice rise out of the glass in perfect full harmony. Wonderful stuff.  Palate is thick, full, creamy, long and a touch dry. Flavours are fruity (tropical and citrus) and well as some light spice and good wheat/bread flavours. Did I mention full?  I love this beer, and considering I only just discovered a relativley close bottle shop that carries this range I look forward to consuming many over the following summer months.",Bayerische Staatsbrauerei Weihenstephan,Germany,Hefeweizen,98
252,731,BuckeyeNation,4.3,"Turbid medium gold. The pour yields a huge, pillowy, off-white head that recedes quickly to about one finger of foam. Not much lace sticks to the glass. The nose is very nice and is of clove, banana and melon.  I love the flavor since it's chock full of yeasty banana and clove. The beer tastes wheaty, with sweet and bitter complementing one another rather than clashing. The finish favors dry, with a crisp, clean mouthfeel. Drinkability is excellent; this bottle disappeared very quickly. Weihenstephaner Hefeweissbier is my first hefeweizen and I found a lot to like.",Bayerische Staatsbrauerei Weihenstephan,Germany,Hefeweizen,98
252,731,ManekiNeko,3.68,"Served chilled in a pint glass at RFD's.  Appearance: Cloudy golden yellow that almost seems to exude a glowing soft light. Topped by a smallish white head. A constant ring of fine bubbles. Little fingers of proto-lace struggle to stick to the glass.  Smell: Yeasty and bready smell with faint hints of citrus. Not all that estery in comparison to the kristallweisse, faint banana and bubblegum.  Taste: Lightly sweet bready/yeasty malt flavor that gives way to a bubblegum finish. Hints of clove and slightly sour.  Mouthfeel: Very light and effervescent. Not as thin as the kristallweiss, but still very refreshing.  Drinkability: Quite drinkable. Less fragrant and bubblegummy than the kristallweiss, but certainly more yeasty overall.",Bayerische Staatsbrauerei Weihenstephan,Germany,Hefeweizen,98
252,731,allboutbierge,4.62,"My all-time favorite Weissbier.  This beer's head is gigantic and aromatic. Notes of bananas, oranges, clovers, and general fruit smells fill the air. Flavor is complex yet balanced. Notes of vanilla, in addition to bananas, oranges, clovers assault the palate and please the mouth. The mouthfeel is luxurious and thick and the carbonation is light and slow.  A real prize to find. Thankfully, its quite easy to come by in Rhineland pubs.",Bayerische Staatsbrauerei Weihenstephan,Germany,Hefeweizen,98
252,731,Gueuzedude,4.3,"This was one of those beers that I had heard a lot about, and one of which I have been using this yeast forever in my own wheat beers. The Weizen was a nice fruity crisp beer, with a nice balance of the Banana/Clove flavor against a refreshingly wholesome yeastiness. Definitely worth searching out and procuring while I was in Germany, and best of all, I can now get it at my local bottle shop.",Bayerische Staatsbrauerei Weihenstephan,Germany,Hefeweizen,98
252,731,HardTarget,4.92,"Aroma: Classic Weihenstephaner yeast banana smell, with some spicy and candy notes. Smells so good I don&#8217;t want to drink it, I just want to sniff it awhile! Appearance: Brilliantly clear pale yellow with active carbonation feeding a pillowy dense pure white head. Head formed up to about a finger and a half with a gentle pour. Left a few streaks of lace, but mostly the head kept to itself, lasting through the beer. Flavor: Still sniffing, hold on a minute. Flavor: Banana like yeast coats a solid malt base that quickly disappears with only a wisp of the pleasant yeast taste to remind you &#8220;Hey, take another drink, QUICK&#8221;. Clean clean clean, smooth smooth smooth, induces palalia induces palalia induces palalia. Mouthfeel: Slick, evasive, did I just drink something? Did leave a mild tingle between the lips and gums. Overall Impression: Well, there is a reason these folks have been around since 1040 AD. They make some outstanding beer. About the only complaint I have is that it doesn&#8217;t come in 4000 oz bottles. This was my first Weihenstephan Hefeweissbeir; it will NOT be my last. Recommendation: BUY ON SIGHT, ALL OF IT!",Bayerische Staatsbrauerei Weihenstephan,Germany,Hefeweizen,98
252,731,Winter,4.4,"Served in the classic tall weiss beer glass, with a lemon which I discarded. Color is a cloudy orange with a short-lived white head. Pleasant aroma consisted of vanilla, bananas and a touch of clove. Mouthfeel was medium-bodied and smooth with good carbonation. Flavors of banana, vanilla and yeast combine with a pleasant malt taste. Finish is very clean and refreshing. A great companion to breaded fish and fries on a Friday night. A smooth, easy drinking and very great tasting weissbier.",Bayerische Staatsbrauerei Weihenstephan,Germany,Hefeweizen,98
252,731,putnam,4.62,"Aromas of zucchini, cinnamon and pie crust occupy the nose in a state of utter congeniality. Comfortable toast and white pepper notes weave within a relaxed perfume of evening and earth. Each note on the palate, whether nutmeg, banana, pepper or linen, intensifies under scrutiny, then fades as another trait earns attention. More intensely flavored than most bottled Hefes, yet clean as a whistle.",Bayerische Staatsbrauerei Weihenstephan,Germany,Hefeweizen,98
252,731,goz,4.33,"Pours a hazy medium golden/orange, huge creamy white head that mostly lasts, leaves good lacing. Aroma is dominated with banana and clove, with a hint of hops in the back. Flavor is sweet, loads of banana, some other fruits, a bit of spiciness in the end, and maybe a bit of smokiness somewhere in there as well. Medium body, finishes dry as a bone. A superb hefe.",Bayerische Staatsbrauerei Weihenstephan,Germany,Hefeweizen,98
252,731,AtLagerHeads,4.21,"A clean, crisp beer that has a delightful flavor and decent look. The yellow body is topped by a great cloud of white foam and the residual does its share of lacing. The nose is a bit light and lacks clear definition, but there is enough to give the sense of yeasting and malt that one might expect. The flavor is very special; it's not so much what it gives, but rather what it doesn't give and that is the typical over-cloving sense. This beer impresses of balanced malt and a gentler spiciness than is typical of this style. Quite lovely stuff this. Lighter bodied and crispy without tartness, this has drinkability plus.",Bayerische Staatsbrauerei Weihenstephan,Germany,Hefeweizen,98
252,731,HTX,5,"This was *the* best beer I've had in a long time. For me, this ranks as one of those all time greats. The taste is fantastic and the head is constant. Once I took the bottle cap off, it never stopped foaming. It makes for a great party beer, for sure.",Bayerische Staatsbrauerei Weihenstephan,Germany,Hefeweizen,98
252,731,Ellbert,4.32,"Appearance: Good with a nice white head. It is a nice golden color, more towards orange than yellow. It is a bit cloudy however. The head sticks with a small lace aound the edges.  Smell: Very malty with some spices evident. A very crisp and wonderful aroma.  Taste: A good flavor but different, maybe I will have to review this again when I know more about the style. Very malty with a nice mixture of hop flavors. Tangy with a nice carbonation bite to it. Some spices are towards the back.  Mouthfeel: A nice crisp mouthfeel, good carbonation and good consitency.  Drinkability: Excellent! Very drinkable and considering the low alcohol content you could drink this all night.  A very good brew, definitely worth giving a try, will probably keep this as a good backup. I enjoyed this much better than the other beers from this brewery.",Bayerische Staatsbrauerei Weihenstephan,Germany,Hefeweizen,98
252,731,TinusTime,4.23,"Poured the typical cloudy straw colour with a very full billowy white head that had incredible retention. Smell was typical of the style, banana, a little yeasty and spicy. The taste was hefe plus.. It was easily one of the best ive had. Nice banana bread and cloves, a touch of sweetness with just enough bite to level it out before it became cloying. Nice silky mouthfeel left you wanting more.. High drinkability- could be a great session beer. As i said one of the best hefe's I have tasted and will definately get again.",Bayerische Staatsbrauerei Weihenstephan,Germany,Hefeweizen,98
252,731,Zraly,4.82,"Cloudy, hazy, beautiful wheat beer accompanied by a pocky, white, billowing head. Appropriate carbonation and a welcomed sight overall.  The smell is a full-on hefeweizen scent...bananas, citrus, and a wonderful undertone of smooth spice. These smells carry over nicely into the flavor department. In addition, there is that delightful yeasty component that just envelopes the palate. A notable apple cider note comes through as well. The flavor is so full and dead-on, the finish a rich, creamy, complex wheaty-ness...perfect reasons to savor this beer. The smoothness and fullness is really setting a huge benchmark for other wheat beers to follow. Tangy goodness.  To go along with this, I'm gonna having a Jerk Vegetarian Chili made with lotsa lime, clove, and habanero. This might be heaven on Earth. One of the best.",Bayerische Staatsbrauerei Weihenstephan,Germany,Hefeweizen,98
252,731,SeanChouffe,4.17,"Pours a hazy golden orange color, a full bubbly head, some lace and a fair amount of carbonation. A fresh fruity smell of bananas, and slightly citrus. A sweet taste that is not too dry, is clear and clean, and finishes quite crisp. Great mouth feel with strong effervescence. An admirable balance of desirable characteristics in a Hefe Weizen.",Bayerische Staatsbrauerei Weihenstephan,Germany,Hefeweizen,98
252,731,au1sec,4.77,"WOW! This is exceptional. This is the wheat beer that other wheat beers aspire to be. I poured this beer and got the aroma without trying to..its potent. The head is so thick I was tempted to put the bottle cap on it just to see...I'm sure I'd have had no problem leaving it right there for a few moments. Nice golden color..of course its cloudy, its a hefe. Its almsost like a Belgian in its complexity...also with the amount of carbonation. You get the banana & clove taste you'd expect with the yeast, but the subtle spiciness kicks in...feels light and crisp like a good hefe should. Extremely drinkable. This is a top-notch beer...can't wait to have it again.",Bayerische Staatsbrauerei Weihenstephan,Germany,Hefeweizen,98

I then get the clovey, yeasty aroma. The flavor is fruity, like bananas with the cloviness. It also has a wheat and yeasty flavor. Very refreshing, and easy drinking.",Bayerische Staatsbrauerei Weihenstephan,Germany,Hefeweizen,98
252,731,bigbelcher,4.75,"This is one of my favorite hefe's. They have been brewing beer for almost 1000 years so you can always count on getting a good quality beer. Many of the Hefe=weiss around the world get their yeast from Weihenstephen. I prefer the draft versions over bottles as it seems to have more of the phenolic (bananna) charecter that I like in a hefe. Golden color. Cloudy, rich creamy head that you can float a quarter on...",Bayerische Staatsbrauerei Weihenstephan,Germany,Hefeweizen,98
252,731,Brent,3.36,"I was surprised to realize I had not gotten around to trying this beer, as I've had several others from the brewery. I was a little let-down by the beer, not because it was bad, simply because it was not as good as I would have expected from them. Hazy golden pour with copious yeast in suspension. Vigorous carbonation and head production. Muted aroma of wheat malt and yeast. Flavor was bright and sharp, but the banana and clove notes were not nearly so evident as I expected (and hoped). Overall, a fairly average representation of the style.",Bayerische Staatsbrauerei Weihenstephan,Germany,Hefeweizen,98
252,731,Boilermaker88,4.78,"Served from a 12oz brown bottle, this beer poured a cloudy dark golden color. A huge white pillowy head formed and I noted a lot of streams of carbonation .  The smell hit immediately. Strong of bananas, cloves, and a bready malt aroma.  Bananas and a yeasty, malty taste were up front. Cloves and spices asserted themselves and I was left with a lingering banana bread taste at the finish.  Feel was light, dry, crisp and very refreshing.  Huge drinkability!! Wonderful taste and aroma made it hard for me to restrain myself from downing my six-pack in one sitting. I'm delaying my self-gratifacation to more thoroughly enjoy them. This is the standard bearer for the style. Truly world-class.",Bayerische Staatsbrauerei Weihenstephan,Germany,Hefeweizen,98
252,731,Bighuge,4.15,"Nice looking hazy orange tinted copper. Healthy white head decorates the surface. Retention? Just fine. Lemon, vanilla, pepper and banana aromas hit the nose.

Solid hefe.",Bayerische Staatsbrauerei Weihenstephan,Germany,Hefeweizen,98
252,731,Jon,4.38,"This German hefeweiss pours a hazy golden color with a huge, pillowy white head sitting atop the liquid. Head retention is superior, as excellent lace appears down the glass. Smell is that of a traditional German hefe -- banana, clove, hops, yeast, and assorted spices on which I can't put my finger. Taste is very nice with notes of clove and assorted spiciness, while a bit of hop flavor kicks in on the finish. While mild carbonation permeates the mouth, this is an incredibly smooth brew. Drinks as well as any hefe I've tried, too. Perfect for the summer. This is the best bottled German hefe I've tried thus far. Tap could be another story, but that will have to wait for another day. Very well done.",Bayerische Staatsbrauerei Weihenstephan,Germany,Hefeweizen,98
252,731,BobLuvBeer,3.45,"Foggy Copper Color. Quickly dissipating head. Distinct wheat presence in the taste and aroma. Highly carbonated, with a biting aftertaste. A higher percentage of hops than wheat however. A good beer when you want one to two tasty weisss. But when there is a choice available, I would go to a different brand. Served with lemon.",Bayerische Staatsbrauerei Weihenstephan,Germany,Hefeweizen,98

The smell contains clove and banana aromas with a bit of spice to it. The taste is just a bit on the malty side with some orange flavor hiding behind the clove and banana. There is some other spices lurking in there. The mouthfeel is nice and heavy, not too carbonated.

Aroma contains citrus tones which arise at the forefront of the aroma with magnificant clove and sweet carmalazied banana notes produced by the yeast. Faint hop aroma balanced by the sharp sweetness of the malted wheat. A full flavor that comes throught sharply sweet at first then mellows int a rolling wave of banana, clove, citrus notes that coat the palate very nicely and finally topped of with some balancing delicate hopping. Mouthfeel is lacking a little on the carbonation level not as bubbly as I expected and the body is a fluffy medium to light density.

Its flavor starts off with mild fruity banana lemon and yeast notes then mellows into a lingering soft mouthfeel. It is on the thick side which adds to the smooth mouthfeel. It is an easy brew to drink and is one that you could easily enjoy in a beer tent at the Oktoberfest! Prosit!,Bayerische Staatsbrauerei Weihenstephan,Germany,Hefeweizen,98

One super large fluffy off-white head nearly three inches tall, fades and pops slowly to leave a fine thin head with some stringy sticking lace. Smell is a nice light and airy, fluffy lemon with a nice grainy wheat bread background and notes of banana and spice. Taste is one refreshing, rock solid hefe, with a perfect balance of lemon, not to tart, good breadish tone, wheaty, yeasty, but all very mellowing and smooth.

Rolling but light-bodied banana bread ester beginning but a quick turn to a more neutral approach of mild white toast breadiness. Medium to medium low carbonation. A distinct lemony finish, but overall, a dry finale for a Hefe.

252,731,RonfromJersey,4.17,"First off, no matter what the label says, this is not a malt liquor.  Hazy yellow effervescent body, topped by the traditional enormous foamy white head. Wonderful aroma, mostly bananas, with a bit of bubblegum lurking about. Strong lemon taste, but not overly tart. Mouthfeel is nicely full, but could use a dash more carbonation to make it a tinge lighter. This is a fine summertime beer.

Reminded me of honey/wheat/banana. Poured surprisingly thick with a pretty thick head, even with a perfect pour. The head lingers in some fashion the whole way through this one. Appears very cloudy in the glass, which coupled with the thick appearance, gives the illusion that this isn't a hefe at all. Goes down very smooth, with a taste exactly like the aroma I described above. I think I had my hopes up a little higher on this one. I had the Paulaner hefe a few days earlier, and think I still prefer that one...I'd like to try them both in a taste test!

The cloudy amber color was misleading as it was very clean and light. The aroma was mild yet full of yeasty clove and a touch of banana. The flavor was great as it complemented the aroma well with a more malty and hoppy clove flavor. The finish was so clean that i would love to drink this beer up at lake tahoe in 100 degree weather before i jump into the cold ass lake. The head subsides a bit as you drink it but it is pretty tenacious and clings to the glass.

The yeastiness, fruity esters and phenol that are the hallmarks of the style are all there, but again, nothing dominates. Instead a cohesive and complete expression of the style is made.

It stayed around for a few and gave way to a thin lace. The typical weissen aroma was present; cloves bananas and yeast are present. This aroma seemed a bit crispier or fresher than some other weissens that I have had. The flavor has a lemon twang to it along with a slight musty yeast finish, wheat and spices.

Exhibits the typical spicy, clovey notes, and pours the usual large foamy head.

The front is spicy citrus, turning just a little sour instead of the sweet I was expecting. The finish is bitter fresh, with some green apples. Bread and butter. Nuts make an appearance in the aftertaste. This is a very, very good beer. Even better at temperature. Freshly buttered fresh bread. I wouldn't have minded a little more esters, but really... one of the most delicious beers I've had.",Bayerische Staatsbrauerei Weihenstephan,Germany,Hefeweizen,98

Cool it down. ~40F is a good temp. Get the right glass. Pour it. Taste it. You won't want just one. Beautiful spice taste, hops and citrus bite. Hefeweisen as we define it. I would love to try this fresh in a German pub on tap.  Don't pass this up. $7.99/6pk $25.99/ cs. Worth every penny. 5.5% alchohol to boot. Enjoy.  NOTE: Price has gone up due to poor performance of our dollar. This is one of the finest beers available.

Yeast contributions mesh nicely with the malt and hops. Nicely balanced. Caramel, ripe banana, spice, and yeast flavor notes. Finishes well.  Good mouthfeel. Good drinkability.  Overall, a very good hefeweizen. No wonder this brewery has been around all those years.",Bayerische Staatsbrauerei Weihenstephan,Germany,Hefeweizen,98
252,731,nomad,4.7,"Poured a very pale yellow, quite cloudy. Holy head! Soft, pillowy, and extraordinarily abundant. When I swung my wheat beer glass around I was entertained by explosions of bubbles roaring up to underbody of the head. The carbonation stacked up into an amazing structure: the bubbles pile up like a perfectly aligned brick wall. The head eventually calmed down but can be awakened very easily. (As you can see, I'm easily amused by playful objects)  Nose was of cloves, banana (less than the cloves). Character was neither too sweet nor too lactic. Occassionally, a detected tiny bit of bubblegum ester creeps. Taste was beautifully of wheat, cloves, and a tinge of hops and lemon. Had a light and thin taste, but in the best way possible for a hefe-weisse, and was topped off by a great tasting yeast close to a light nutmeg flavor. The mouthfeel was a sharp spritzy action all over, topped off by a short finish with a a gentle but hearty yeasty-hoppy-creamyblend of an aftertaste.  Way too drinkable, yet has tons of body and heartiness. Cannot drink one, wont appreciate it until youve had, at least, two, an easy thing to do. It would be MUCH better if you could get it much quicker and fresher in America, as I'm sure it loses some of its best qualities since hefe-weizens don't sit or travel well.  Addendum: funny thing is, its even better on tap than in the bottle - that keg has traveled!",Bayerische Staatsbrauerei Weihenstephan,Germany,Hefeweizen,98
252,731,BeerManDan,4.5,"It poured a hazy medium golden wheat color with very little foam and little retention. The smell of cloves with a hint of wheat was not over powering.

Pours a cloudy golden yellow color with tiny yeasties floating about the glass that ultimately lay to rest on the bottom of the glass. A thick, creamy, full head tempts you to sample what lies beneath. Aromas of citrus, bananas, and sweet malted wheat pull you in even further. Taste is exquisitely balanced for a hefe- of this magnitude. Tastes of bananas, citrus peel and yeast seem to blend exceptionally well with the mild wheat flavor.

The aroma is one of bananas and sweet malt with hints of cloves and spices.  There was a fruitiness and tartness as this beer went down. Very light in body with a excellent drinkability.

Cloves, yeast, and bananas come through in the pleasant aroma. Zingy carbonation feel on the tongue hits at first, and then an extraordinary smoothness follows. Sweet malts, yeast, cloves, and bananas are all a part of the very enjoyable taste.

Wonderful yeastiness, bubblegum fragrance out shines the banana, a whisper of clove. Glowingly balanced taste with well-placed flavor more banana is found on the palate, slight bubblegum, almost no clove but solid wheaty-maltiness. Faint mustiness. Pleasing mouthfeel, this is a very enjoyable quaff. Slightly sweet yet mildly tart finish. Probably the best Hefe-Weizen on the planet.

Many of them seem to be eating the same thing. You ask the person at a food stall , What is everone eating and drinking? The response is simple- weisswurst und hefe weizen. The beer is poured in a tall,large glass with a thick, billowy head pouring over the side. The nectar is a deep golden,cloudy brew with a cascade of bubbles from top to bottom. It sounds like a bowl full of rice crispies as it snaps,crackles,and pops in the glass.The beer smells of bananas,cloves,buble gum and bready yeast.  The flavors that you can detect are lemon,vanilla, spicy bread and a little malt sweetness. It has a nice crisp mouthfeel that has a little oiliness to it (from oats?)

The taste is also very fresh and fruity and quite sweet, but I dont really like it fully, it's good but it doesn't really float my boat. The carbonation is lying on the border of medium to light.

252,731,DerKaiser,4.38,"Weihenstephaner just makes superb Bavarian-style wheat beers, and this is probably their flagship. A nice golden slightly hazey brew with a huge white head.  The typical clove and banana esthers are heavy in this brew, as is a wonderful malty flavor. Sweet yeasts. Creamy mouthfeel and a smooth, crisp finish. There are no surprises here, just a perfectly crafted German Hefe-Weissbier.  This beer surpasses the Franziskaner hefe and ranks right up there with Paulaner's.

The head exhibits extraordinary retention.  Aroma: Consists of the prototypical cloves and ripe bananas that define this style.  Taste: Begins with lots of soft carbonation and a quite full bread malt flavor and lots of yeast, towards the middle of the taste the clove and ripe banana flavors assert themselves. At the end of the taste some mild hops appear along with some residual malt flavor. The finish is clean and a bit dry.  Mouth feel: The mouthfeel is smooth and creamy.  Drinkability/notes: While I do not particularly care for the Hefeweizen style, it must be conceded that this is a superb beer and a must try for anyone who is a serious student of world=class beer.",Bayerische Staatsbrauerei Weihenstephan,Germany,Hefeweizen,98

In the classic half liter brown bottle, stating that this is the oldest brewery in the world. Fantastic looking beer, with a thick white head, with great Belgian lace, and a cloudy orange/yellow. A pronounced aroma of yeast and bananas. Fairly well carbonated, with a smooth mouthfeel. This has the classic taste of sweet malts balanced by the yeast/banana tastes .

A hazy, peach-colored body with dull gold edges topped with a massive, fluffy off-white head that stays around forever. Hundreds of bubbles fight their way to the top of the glass from the strong carbonation.  Smell: Very strong aroma with the traditional banana, clove, and bubblegum notes. There's a bit of spiciness in there, as well as a hearty yeasty smell.  Taste: Very full flavored with a strong malted wheat backbone. Lots of banana and clove intermingle with the spiciness, which all come together in a perfect balance. There's lots of yeast in the body, and it makes itself known on the palate. The finish is dry and clean with the alcohol just barely making it's presence known. Wheat beer perfection.  Mouthfeel: Fairly thin bodied with a dry, crisp mouthfeel that begs for another sip. It actually starts off feeling a bit creamy, then moves to dry and thin (in a good way.)  Drinkability: This is the top rung of the wheat beer ladder. I could drink these all day, every day in the summer and never tire of it.

It was so attractive I had to take a picture of it. A thick-veined lacing is left on the glass. The aroma is bready yeast and a touch of clove and/or coriander. Smells more like the latter. Also a touch of lemon zest in the nose. The taste is superb, with again a nice breadiness, topped with fruity flavors, banana being the strongest of those, with a touch of plum or grape sweetness in the background. A touch of butterscotch adds a nice contrast to the coriander spiciness and wheat crispness on the finish. The mouthfeel is buttery yet very refreshing. Carbonation levels are perfect, providing a nice liveliness on the tongue while not getting agressive and distracting. The drinakbility is exceptional.

Rich banana taste, subtle citrus flavors, and very faint florals. Banana and yeasty, malted wheat sweetness linger, but a crisp refreshing finish wins out. Medium bodied, creamy and super smooth.

There's some fruitiness with some banana and clove in the background, and a bit of 'plastic' as well. The body is light-medium but very creamy with a tight, crisp effervescence from natural conditioning. The flavor starts with malt backed by a light clove, displays its bolder phenols across the middle (burnt plastic), and then a quick light hop note towards the end of the palate which dissolves in softly sweet banana notes in the finish. The balance of sweetish malt, aggressive phenols, and very light hop and bitterness is sublime. The banana and clove are well restrained - subtle - but present. Extremely refreshing and enjoyable.

Not heavy, but not as light and frothy as some others you will find - this is in the realm of Schneider Weisse, a bit more serious than some Paulaners and Franziskaners you will find. Truly wonderful, bread-crust maltiness is set afloat by banana flavors coming from the yeast. A nice balance. Hops come at the finish and round the beer out in an incredibly appetizing way, coaxing you to take another sip. The fresh champagne sparkle and chewy mouthfeel sets this beer into the stratosphere.

252,731,marc77,4.55,"An absolutely impressively thick, white, dense and well retained head tops a light orange hazy brew w/ copious bubbling. The assertive but clean German wheat yeast esters are comprised of the expected bubblegum, light banana, a hint of clove but when combined with the sweet malt notes is quite reminescent of a banana split. Tart wheat notes become perceptible as the beer warms. This beer exhibits excellent balance all around. Yeast esters, although quite prominent, do not dominate the flavor profile and allow the rich, almost chewy malt backbone that consists of pleasant sweetness and an unexpectedly mild toasty malt to add complexity to thiis brew. Hop bitterness is just a touch above the norm, and provides an excellent contrast to the malt flavors and sweetness. This brew finishes w/ an enjoyable sweetness followed by a bit of mustiness from the yeast. The overall flavor is less estery and cleaner than most German wheats, but there's a superlative balance between flavor contributions from the yeast, barley malt, wheat and hops.

My feeling now is that the tap version I had was not properly stored/served. The pour produced a cloudy, dull golden colored bier, with an endless stream of bubbles rising to the top. The head was a 2-3"" billowy, white mass, leaving nice lacing in the glass. The aroma jumps right at you with a yeasty sharpness, and plenty of clove and banana. Very nice! The body was about a medium, and it was fairly smooth, even with the high level of carbonation present. Malty sweetness first hits the palate, followed by an abundance of banana and clove. A spicy bite at the finish and a pleasant long-lasting aftertaste round things out. This bier is a keeper! Prosit!!  overall: 4.45 appearance: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | mouthfeel: 4 | drinkability: 4.5  *** ***  On-tap review from 18MAY02... Had this on draft. The color on this baby seemed a bit odd: a yellow-golden color, rather than just golden. Was cloudy, with a tiny head and no lace. I'd expect perhaps more head produced from a bottled version. Mild nose with clove, banana and some spice evident. Good body, and nicely smooth on the palate. Enjoyable flavor, with some citrus, banana, some yeast and clove present. Nice bier.

A quick spark of clove hits the same time as the carbonation. Semi crisp with a medium body and a well structured carbonation. Minimal hop bitterness, maltiness is cracker like and gets drier and drier towards the end. Nutty flavours from the yeast and very faint fennel character from the phenols come through. Finish is quite clean and alcohol is a tad noticeable though the extravagant fruity side of the esters associated with this style is held at bay and more spiciness seems to take hold.  Notes: One of the best in the world needless to say, it still lives up to its name. A wheat beer at its best.",Bayerische Staatsbrauerei Weihenstephan,Germany,Hefeweizen,98
