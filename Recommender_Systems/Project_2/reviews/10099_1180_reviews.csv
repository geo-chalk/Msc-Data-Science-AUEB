10099,1180,jkblr,3.49,"32oz crowler purchased two days ago at J's Liquor Owensboro poured into a DFH branded teku glass at fridge temp 8% ABV. The beer pours mostly bright medium brown with ruby highlights and essentially no head. No retention or lacing. The aroma is faint brown sugar and maybe a hint of dark fruit. The taste is slightly sugary, with raisin flavor before an alcohol hot, barely bitter finish. Not real complex and scary close to cherry cough syrup. The mouthfeel is medium plus bodied with below average carbonation and anundry finish. Overall, subpar. I got a stupid deal on this crowler ($5) and I imagine that this keg had been on tap for quite a while with the restrictions on shopping. I would still try this from a dated bottle or a bar that does a brisk business.

10099,1180,Harrison8,4.03,"Pours a dark nutty brown with a hint of burgundy. Head is a finger of khaki foam. Head retention is good. Aroma is strong - plum, dark fruits, raisins, fig and caramely malts. A little bit of alcohol seeps through, but just barely. Flavor profile carries the same profile forward, hitting notes of plum, dark fruits, raisins, fig and toffee with caramely, nutty malts underneath. Alcohol is a little more apparent here. Mouth feel is full with a medium-thick consistency that firms up to 'thick' when the glass has been warmed slightly. Light graininess adds a little texture to each sip. Overall, heavy and full with strong raisins and dark fruit qualities.  Served in a 15.5oz Speigalau tulip from a 12oz bottle.

The beer looks just fine, ruby/auburn, quite clear (too much so?), with a nice layer of small bubbles built up. The surface continues to hold the head well into the taste, and lacing is prevalent. Smell is a bit of raisin, but more graham cracker like spice and sweetness.  The taste has some expected strong ale flavors, dark sugar with a hint if molasses, perhaps. There's a hint of copper tinge (that I associate with British bitter beer). I also get a bit of bourbon-poached peach, and almost none if the raisin I expected. There is also a light bite of spice, and an almost equally subdued hops note. More disappointing is the feel - I wanted a bit more body for the lighter flavors I was getting (deeper flavors would've worked as well). The carbonation is also a bigger part of the feel than if expect.  Definitely learned I don't need to try this again, considering the offerings that DFH has.

Pours a murky medium brown with copper highlights and a frothy khaki head that lingers as a thin layer of foam.  Raisins, prunes, and plums leap from the glass, along with brown sugar sweetness. Almost has a Belgian yeast nose to it.  Flavor is much less sweet, with slightly tart raisins and prunes underlying a lightly toasted, bready malt character. The finish reveals prunes and slightly earthy and bitter notes. The sour character is somewhat disappointing. Belgian yeast notes emerge late.  Body is on the full side, with moderate carbonation and noted alcohol warmth.  This one held up well. There's a touch of oxidation in the form of cardboard, but that was minute.

I didn't have a chance to try Midas Touch or anything too wild, but I quite enjoyed this one along with a precisely medium lamb burger. All in all a good experience from start to finish. A spicy Belgian malt and yeast taste serves to excellently compliment a color and faint sweetness which are not entirely unlike Russian kvass (a beer-like soft drink made from fermenting roasted bread rusks together with a variety of fruits and herbs).

The aroma was equally as thick with deep raisin, plum, fig, molasses, and prune.  The flavors were very complex and very hearty. It started with what I imagined was the green raisin and then moved to a more candied dark fruit. Prune, date, fig and grape took hold as a molasses and chocolate malt finished. The feel was thick and full and it was well woven with the flavors.  This bottle was aged for two years and perhaps added to the character and variety of taste.

10099,1180,ThisLadyLovesBeer,3.38,"First time ever trying this ale:  A = it is true to label - deep mahogany (dark orange/brown), no clouding but didn't expect that. The head was short-lived and left lacing on the glass for a very little time.  S = As I held it up to my nose, I thought ""sherry"" probably due to the beet sugar and raisins and 8% alcohol.  T = It is a good, hearty winter brew. I can t aste the fruit and beet sweetness, but also detect a slight smokey/burnt taste. Sugars?  M = Light carbonation and slightly creamy, but with 8% alcohol, only slightly.  O = This is a good hearty winter brew. I would not accompany this with a grilled steak as is suggested by the brewer, but rather a rich flavored, savory stew with a large chunk of crusty homemade dark bread and butter. You need rich fats to accompany this properly. So, also enjoy this with rich, flavorful artisanal cheeses and crusty breads.

10099,1180,LiquidAmber,4.11,"A mini vertical of a properly cellared 2009 and 2013 bottle I got from the east coast. I cellared a lot of beer in 2008/2009 to see what develops and although Dogfish Head is readily available here on the west coast, they stopped distributing Raison D'Être, so I was unable to get another bottle until now. This was not a beer I wanted to put down for more than a year or two, but here goes….. 2013: Poured into a Dogfish Head pint glass. Pours a medium mahogany amber with a thin, light tan head that dissipates to a thin film and ring around the glass, leaving patchy light lacing. Aroma of caramel malt, dark dried fruit, lightly nutty and earthy. Flavor follows aroma; caramel and bready malt, nuts, raisins, dates, fresh dark fruit. Finishes with an earthy dark maltiness. Medium bodied. A nice domestic take on a Belgian dark beer, closely in character to a dubbel, but sweeter and maltier. Old ale meets dubbel. 2009: Poured into a Gulden Draak tulip. Pours a hazy, medium to dark, red-orange amber with a thin off-white head with good retention and light lacing. Rich aroma of sweet caramel malt, dark dried fruit, light cardboard oxidation, similar in profile to a mild barley wine. I'm surprised to see that the years have been quite nice to this ale! The flavor is moderate, but flavorful caramel and bready malt, mellow dark dried fruit (lots of dates and figs), very well integrated and tasty. Body has turned to the heavy side of medium with light creaminess. This is a very nice, creamy, well melded malty ale that most resembles a light, but well made old ale. I had no great expectations from this, and have found that many ales develop too much oxidation flavors ate this age, but this does not. The oxidation notes in the aroma are not present. Well, I like Raison D'Être and used to pick it up frequently when it was available, but now I wish I had a few more of these in the cellar. I'm going to try to get my sister to haul back a few more. Rating is an average of the two ales; I liked the aged one quite a bit more than the new one, which was still enjoyable.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Belgian Dark Strong Ale,83
10099,1180,CochonKing,3.06,"Lives up to the description and pours a deep mahogany. Almost no head with a lot of disproportionation. The nose has notes of raisin and malt but doesn't have much to it besides that. It is decent and delivers what the beer is meant to smell like, but no further phenols. Tastes of malt and raisin but the alcohol destroys the balance, overwhelming the beer. The mouthfeel is good, medium bodied with nice carbonation. Overall just an ok beer.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Belgian Dark Strong Ale,83
10099,1180,BeerandWhiskeyHQ,4.51,"A: Wonderfully dark and has a deep copper color. The quickly dissipating head was light tan in color. The color does remind me of a dark rich mahogany which is what Dogfish referred to this ale as.  S: It smells sugary and sweet with a strong scent of raisins or grapes. There is a presence of oak and malt and slightly bitter overall. The presence of alcohol makes itself known.  T: The taste is sugary and sweet much like it smells, there is an underlying taste threaded throughout the complexity of the beer that might be coming from the beet sugars. I get a spice note in there as well. The scent and smell translates nicely to the taste. To me I get more of a grape taste than raisins (yes I realize the correlation between grapes and raisins), but it has the taste of a lot of other Dogfish beers that specifically mention that grapes were included in their ingredient bill.  O: I really enjoy this beer, but isn’t something I see myself enjoying on a very regular basis, it is rich, complex and very enjoyable which makes me want to keep it for an “every once in a while” sort of occasion.

M - Smooth, medium bodied, a bit creamy. High carbonation, slightly warming alcohol.  O - Decent brew.

The body is cloudy red-brown with a warm shade exhibited.  Medicinal phenols and dark fruitiness. Beet-y root vegetable sweetness, fig, dark raisin, toffee, clove, malt creaminess, candi sugar, nutty esters, antiseptic, and dark rum/molasses. Lots of dark fruit with an herbal quality.  Retains subtle sweetness with deep dark fruits and dried fruit/trail mix notes. Beet sugars keep that vegetal note intact, but the boast of fig and raisin flavors have evolved into a complex fruit element that includes plum, date, and dried apricot. More of that intense clove-y phenolic character with a cough medicine vibe. Carbonation is soft-medium and fills out a hefty body mouthfeel. Booze is totally a non-factor. This beer really aged well.

Pours a transparent deep mahogany red with a half finger pale head that quickly fades to a thin halo and leaves small splotches of lace.  The advertised beet sugar and raisins seem apparent in the aroma. Sweet sugars, dark fruits and caramel.  A very malt forward beer. Caramel malts, raw natural sugar, dark fruits, toffee, a slightly funky but mellow Belgian yeast element, faint honey and just a trace tickle of alcohol towards the finish. Straight forward but quite approachable.  Medium body with fair carbonation. Toffee, caramel malts and raisins in the aftertaste.  An all around solid brew.

10099,1180,BethanyB,4.08,"Appearance: A beautiful beer, indeed. Brilliant in clarity, and dark amber in color. The head is a massive off-white cream puff with magnificent staying power. Fantastic for the style. I can't help but give it a top score. Why not?  Smell: Before I read the bottle, I could smell the green raisins (I call them golden raisins). I was perplexed, as it was not a scent I was used to in a beer. Then I read the bottle and was delighted that my sense of smell was so right on! Bright C-hops were nicely balanced with toffee, dates, and toasted malt. Lovely.  Taste: The long lasting foam has a flavor of brown sugar and prunes. As the head settles and the beer warms, it proves itself to be very malt-forward. The complex toasty, chocolate, and slightly roasted malt is highly drinkable, and does not distract from the flavors mentioned earlier. A mild bitterness is most apparent upfront, then relaxes later on. Less complex than some strong dark ales, but in an impressive way: the balance is impeccable, and the malt complexity stands on its own--it doesn't need big helpings of melanoidins and esters to draw one in. There is, however, a slight medicinal flavor that appears to come from alcohol rather than infection, and is somewhat distracting at times.  Mouthfeel: Medium mouthfeel, with medium carbonation. While the body is not thin, there is a watery texture that sneaks in there and detracts from the overall impression. Alcohol warming is light.  Overall: A very well balanced strong dark ale that really showcases malt complexity. There are a few elements that detract from the overall impression, such as the watery texture and the hint of cough syrup in the flavor. Still, a very well done version of the style that doesn't need to try too hard to impress. Would recommend this to someone just starting to get into big beers.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Belgian Dark Strong Ale,83

Lots of sweet fruit notes on the nose. Grape juice comes to mind. There is also a nice rich bready component to the aroma as well.  Nice medium body and a deliciously rich, sweet flavor. Lots of fresh bread and sweet fruit up front, most notably grapes, pears, and plums. The flavors dry out a bit at mid-palate and finish mild with just a touch of herbal spice. Very drinkable, but a bit bland on the back of the palate.  I don't know how many times I passed on this one. Finally, it was offered at my weekly beer tasting. I liked it and decided to take some home. Very glad I did. I assumed it was categorized as a fruit/vegetable beer. When I tried it, I thought it's flavor profile reminded me a lot of a dubbel, only lacking some of the rich maltiness. When I saw this was a Belgian Strong Dark Ale, I definitely agreed.

10099,1180,Jugs_McGhee,3.11,"12 fl oz brown glass bottle with standard Dogfish Head label and branded copper pry-off pressure cap acquired as part of a 6 pack at me local HEB Grocery and served into an Independence Brewing pilsner glass in me gaff in low altitude Austin, Texas. Reviewed live. Expectations are below average given the brewery - which tends to disappoint. 8% ABV confirmed per the label. Reviewed as a Belgian style brown ale because it identifies as such on Dogfish Head's website.  Served cold, straight from me fridge, and allowed to warm over the course of consumption. Side-poured with standard vigor as no carbonation issues are anticipated.  A: No bubble show forms as I pour.  Pours a one finger wide head of light khaki colour. Okay thickness and creaminess. Lackluster frothiness. Little lacing clings to the sides of the glass as the head recedes. Head retention is average - about two minutes.  Body colour is a clear dark amber of above average vibrance. No yeast particles are visible. Translucent and transparent. By no means brown in colour, nor is it as dark as most Belgian style dark ales. Not sure what to make of that, but it's appealing in a general sense.  Nonstandard for the style. Not unique or special, but there are no obvious flaws here. I'm optimistic.  Sm: Raisin, prune, amber malts, and beets - but I only notice beets because I'm looking for them; if I had this blind I wouldn't have thought to say beets. Caramel. Light floral hop character is present and seems to complement the malts nicely. I do get a clean tannic Belgian yeast. Lots of residual sugars bring this beer to the sweeter end. A buried hint of murky cherry. Toasted sugars. I like the fruity notes. Raisin is dominant. Sugarcane imparts a note redolent of rum.  Overall, it's a pleasantly sweet aroma of mild strength.  No alcohol or other off-notes are detectable.  T: Rum-soaked fruits: prune, dates, raisin. Plenty of sugarcane and other residual toasty sugars. Amber malts, caramalt, and Belgian malts fill out the body nicely. Beet sugar definitely comes through - though I wouldn't have been able to identify quite what that note was blind. Vague burgundy/red wine hints. Clean Belgian yeast. It's definitely sweet, but it never quite becomes cloying. As it warms, I get a buried grape note. It has nice cohesion and decent balance, but it's certainly not gestalt. Overall, it has some limited complexity, but would benefit from more. Not the most subtle flavour profile either.  Average depth, duration, and intensity of flavour for the style.  No alcohol off flavours come through, aside from a vague alcohol presence - which passes the point of being simply a pleasant warmth and does start to annoy.  It's not really a Belgian dark ale, nor is it a Belgian brown. It's sort of a Belgian dark amber, if you please.  Mf: Smooth and wet. Overcarbonated. A bit too thick and full for the flavour profile; it's not an ideal marriage of texture to taste by any stretch. But it's passable and suits the flavour profile passably. Decent body and presence on the palate.  Not oily, harsh, gushed, or hot.  Dr: A drinkable beer, but the alcohol presence does hold it back. I wouldn't have more than one in a night, but I'm enjoying this one for what it is. I will say that while it's not unique, I can't readily think up a beer I've had that is exactly like it. I'd like to see the brewers commit more to the rum aspect of the beer; barrel aging would be an obvious approach, but there are probably more subtle ways of emphasizing the strength of the flavour. The more I drink of this, the more the sweetness annoys me. It's a decently priced beer, but I won't be buying it again, nor would I recommend it to friends. Above average overall; it's got unfulfilled potential.  I'd like to try it with 1-5 years of age on it; it's got plenty of residual sugars that would develop over time - though I'm not sure if it's got active yeast.

S: Some wrote gum and candy, with solvent. I just dont get any real organic, fruit or grain off this beer. It's a bit industrial. More toward a badly made scotch ale (not my fave style) and nothing like a delicious strong belgian ala Chimay.  T: Follows the smell down the hole. bubble gum, candy rack, spray and wash. (ie a solvent). Industrial more than organic/ natural. Dont even think about it with food. A bit of dark fruit and raisin, prune, spice. No real sense of malt and hops, and syrupy, cloying.

Billowy yellowish-khaki head. Bubbles excitedly rising from the tulip’s bottom. The lacing as I drink is thick where it sticks.  S – Belgian candy sugars and some dark fruits, with some earthiness and spices. Very nice. Dark cherry and licorice, perhaps some fig; also a bit of alcohol. The smells mingle together nicely.  T – The Belgian dark ale flavors are all there, and the only thing that’s in excess for me are the spices (at first). It’s quite sweet, this sweetness and the dark fruit being the main flavors. It doesn’t quite taste full Belgian because it doesn’t have the breadiness I associate with Belgian ales, but it’s close. The alcohol doesn’t start biting till it warms a bit more, and it’s like a love nip. As it warms, some breadiness comes out; it had previously been hidden by the sweetness. I can easily see people thinking this is too sweet. While it approaches too sweet, it’s still fine by me. At the end of the glass the alcohol does bite, but if you drink this in its sweet spot (like I mostly did) it’s great.  M – A tingly softness during the sip but sits pretty soft on the palate, though it’s not velvety. Nearly heavy-bodied, I’m guessing from residual sugars. In the cheeks it’s a little pointed, I think from alcohol. Slightly dry finish, more so on the tongue.  D – This is a great substitute for a Trappist beer, and the mouthfeel makes it somewhat refreshing despite being a BSDA. Even though it’s quite sweet, I could see myself having 2 or 3 in a night. It’s a nice break from the hoppier beers I’ve been drinking lately. Caveat: Once it passes the sweet spot the alcohol come out and alters it quite a bit negatively.

10099,1180,Caj1,3.75,"I had been wanting to try something from Dogfish Head for a while, and, not in the mood for a bitter IPA at the time, I went ahead and got a six-pack of these brews, party because I wanted a brown ale and partly because I was lured in by the claim on the package which said it was the American beer of the year for the year 2000. My experience below.  Poured from a bottle into a snifter, I ended up with about a finger of off-white head which foamed up and then dissipated in the span of about thirty seconds. What's left is some thin but persistent lacing. The beer itself is a nice dark copper/amber that is crystal clear with minimal carbonation. When held to the light it looks almost like strongly brewed iced tea.  With smelling I got an immediate whiff of grapes, somewhat reminiscent of a wine, which makes some sense since this is brewed with raisins. I also get some caramel and butterscotch and a little bit of malt, and the ghost of an earthy smell. The smell translates quite well to the palate; raisins are the first thing I taste, and after holding the beer in my mouth for a little bit I can taste alcohol just a bit, since this is a relatively high alcohol beer (8% ABV, wowzers.) After swallowing the flavor becomes more complex, leaving a nice caramel and just a tiny bit of chocolate, and also a nice hint of earth and bitterness from the hops. This beer definitely prefers to overpower the palate at first and then slowly reveal its character. Mouthfeel is nice, smooth and clean immediately, but after a few moments it foams up and becomes less smooth, while also burning a little bit from the alcohol and carbonation.  Overall this is a pretty nice beer, but I feel like they could have toned down the abject sweetness just a tad and it would have worked a little better; that raisin flavor is just too much to handle when it smacks you in mouth, but this beer is also a grower. I was very off-put on my first bottle, but after subsequent drinks I've come to like this a little more. I would drink it if offered, but probably won't be buying again.

The taste is more of the same, with the alcohol not so well concealed and the sugar flavor a bit too dominant. However, the raison flavor lingers in the background and works. The mouthfeel is sticky and the beer is medium bodied. Overall, a pretty good sipping beer, and at 8% ABV you're going to want to sip it slowly.

10099,1180,SerialTicker,3.88,"Bottled 2/04/13 ... drank three months later on 5/04/13. Poured into a Samuel Adams Perfect Pint Glass.  Appearance: Super good looking beer. A crystal clear ruby color with about three fingers worth of a silky head -- I had to wait for it to go down a bit before adding the last ounce or so of beer. The head's a light tan, and the lacing's above average. Nice start.  Smell: Quite a bit of sweetness -- I get a lot of the raisin and sweet malts. Hay. Maybe some traces of hops there, as it does have a somewhat grassy note.  Taste/feel: Not QUITE doing it for me. On one sip it's overly sweet, then on the next I get an unfortunate kind of aftertaste that reminds me of artificial sweetener... and it lingers, like a Diet Coke would. I really do like the overall flavor, though. I like the taste of the grape on the front, and the seemingly roasted malt quality on the finish. My sister told me this beer was a mess and overly sweet, but I had to try it anyway. As it turns out, I'm glad to have tried it. The aftertaste is a bit ""bleh"", but I have had far worse. The ABV doesn't come through at all in the nose, taste, or feel at first, which is a good thing. As the beer warms, the alcohol warmth comes through a bit, and the sweetness boots out that mild roasty character I was getting. The feel of this beer can be guessed just by seeing the head after the pour -- silky smooth, but with a bit of prickly carbonation. Weird combination, but it works.  Raison D'Etre (No idea how to pronounce it...) is a beer that I'd have to recommend. I hadn't had a Belgian Strong Dark Ale before this one, so I don't know how they normally are, but this is a pleasant beer. Looks great, smells good, feels good. Like I said a couple times though, the aftertaste is a bit much. Still, pick this one up -- but maybe only a single if you can, since this really isn't a beer you won't be wanting to drink more than one of, more than likely.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Belgian Dark Strong Ale,83
10099,1180,bylerteck,3.54,"Bottle from a grocery store in Dade City, Florida. From notes.  A - Deep amber pour with a nice two finger fluffy light brown head. Good carbonation, spotty lace anda a film of retention.  S - Lot' sof raisins. Sugar, dark fruit, light yeast, vinous, port. Aroma became quite grapey later.  T - Sugar, raisins, a little yeast, nice dark malty richness. A little port and vinous notes. Sweet. Flavour gets a bit dull with time. It doesn't seem to have much drinkability for the laung haul. Flavour doesn't carry through from the initial sips.  M - Medium carbonation, light-ish body, sweet and dry finish. Body is a bit lacking.  O/D - A nice BSDA. Complex and tasty, but with a weak body. Otherwise a good example of the style, and a good intro to Belgian-styles from North America. A touch too sweet.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Belgian Dark Strong Ale,83
10099,1180,Bosoxfan20,4,"A- Pours a deep mahogany with some violet hues. Aggressive pour leads to a 2 finger light tan head. Quite dense with terrific lacing. Retention is average, but a respectable thin crown persists.  S- the sweet malty base leads the way. Very sweet as the sugar and molasses comes through with a powerful kick. Dark fruits and raisins. Touch of floral hops. My only complaint is that the yeast went undetected and the malt base slightly drowns out other aspects of the beer.  T- Sweet as the nose indicates. A few different layers to this one. Dark fruits, dates, and raisins as smelled, along with caramel. Crisp. Almost harsh, but not quite. Some alcohol present in the wonderfully warm finish. A nice level of sweetness remains with each sip  M- Mid body, well carbonated. A little thin, but very smooth and drinkable. Almost too drinkable as the booze will creep up on you.  O- Not sure I detect a lot of Belgium character, but well done. Something different results in something really well put together. I had my reservations on this one based on reviews that I had seen, but it proved to me that opinions vary and to always drink with an open mind.

10099,1180,JamesMN,3.56,"Bottled on 7/19/12. It's been sitting in my fridge a long time.  Appearance: Super murky brown sugar color with a thin cap of light tan head.  Aroma: Nice mix of belgian candi sugars and a general malt sweetness. Don't smell the green raisins per-say, but that might be for the best.  Taste: Starts with the complexion of an Amber Ale and then increases in sweetness from there giving definite belgian sugar notes. The raisins are very hard to find in the flavor but most likely just add to the general sweetness. Even though the first half is a bit one dimensional it's still very enjoyable. The finish and aftertaste are where it hits its peak. A great warming quality from the 8% ABV combined with a nice balance between a high sweet note and a low dark malt character. No real hop flavor in this one and not much bitterness (25 IBUs). There is one slight off flavor of copper that comes in right before the finish and lingers a tad in the aftertaste but it is pretty easy to ignore and may have just developed because of the age of this bottle.  Mouthfeel: Just above medium in body but never feels overwhelming. Smooth carbonation and average drinkability.  Final Thoughts: Not a style I'm crazy about but a good beer none the less. If you enjoy Belgian Ales or unconventional ingredients in beer then this one is for you. Would I drink it again? Yes, if fresh.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Belgian Dark Strong Ale,83

Great lacing.  Smell: Nice carbonation to awaken the aromas of dark bread, dried fruit (raisins/prunes)  Taste: Fantastic! Lots of bready toasted malt up front, followed by some toffee and candied sugar-like sweetness, as well as the dried stone fruit, such as raisns, prunes, apricots. Finally, at the finish, there’s just a touch of hoppy bitterness to balance out all the fruit and sweetness. Absolutely delicious beer!  Mouthfeel: Medium-bodied to almost chewy and very, very smooth, as there is practically no carbonation what-so-ever. With an ABV of 8%, I’m surprise at how well masked the alcohol is.  Overall: Raison D’Être is one of my favorite beers from Dogfish Head. Actually, it’s one of my favorite beers period.

Smell - Raisins, dark fruit, malts. very nice smell  Taste - very smooth. great american rendition of a belgian strong. the raisins and dark fruit dominate, with the alcohol hardly detectable (resminiscent of my favs like Rochefort and St Bernardus). candied sugar presence there as well. very drinkable  Mouthfeel - medium-heavy carbonation, medium bodied.  Overall - one of the first craft brews i tried back in the day, i bought it again to review recently and it was better than i remember (probably due to a more developed palette and experience with other belgian strongs).

10099,1180,BareFeetPete,3.02,"I wasn't nearly as impressed by this as I expected to be, having always had a fairly healthy respect for Dogfish Head beers. To be fair, this was a bottled sampling of it whereas most of my experiences with there IPA's have been tapped, but all the same I've always been able to drink those same beers poured from the bottle and enjoy them. Anyway, here's my take on it.  Poured from a 12-ounce bottle into a standard pint glass. I was slightly disappointed I didn't have a bulb on hand, because I think that would have helped, but we college students tend to make do with what we've got.  A - Pours a real deep brown, kind of reddish around the edges. Head is cream colored but is pretty thin and dissipates quickly. I do like the lacing the head leaves behind because it complements the main color nicely, but overall the appearance didn't exactly wow me.  S - The smell is my favorite part of the beer. It's not subtle (though to be honest I'm having trouble picking out exactly what the distinct aromas are) but it isn't too harsh or overwhelming, even when I go to take a sip. It smells very sweet and flowery, and if I had to pick something that jumps out at me I'd say it smells like burnt fruits and vegetables, but I can't really explain why it's a pleasing aroma in this case.  T - I'll be honest, I didn't like the first sip. It was like the beer couldn't decide whether it was sweet or bitter and while I generally prefer ales to lagers because there are (in most cases) more flavors to talk about, in this case the sheer amount of stuff going on in every sip was more distracting than engaging. I will say that the beer grew on me throughout, but nobody buys a beer thinking ""gee, half way through, this stuff is supposed to be pretty decent."" As far as the taste goes though there's really nothing offensive here.  M - Meh. Nothing to talk about here. Definitely not over-carbonated but the alcohol is more prominent in the mouthfeel than the taste and it wasn't exactly pleasant going down.  O - I probably wouldn't buy it again. I enjoyed the second bottle I drank, but by the end of the six-pack I was really just clearing fridge space. In fact I gave the last bottle to my roommate and opted for an alternative I had on hand. It wasn't the worst thing I've tried this year but it certainly didn't inspire me to add it to my shopping list.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Belgian Dark Strong Ale,83

Also some sweet burnt sugar  T- Sweet grapes that dominate the palate. And it doesn't really die down that much throughout the drink. Taste a lot of sugar, and a little booze, and lastly some dark malt that inst that apparent.  M- Moderate body that goes down a little on the heavy side. not much carbonation and is somewhat sticky.  O- A unique beer from a unique brewery. I really do enjoy dogfishhead a lot and i can say the same about this beer. Maybe a tad more dark malt would add some bitterness that is missing.

10099,1180,arnoldosu1,3.77,"This is my first official review, not only here on beer advocate but in general as well! This is however not my first time enjoying this ""deep mahogany ale"" as dogfish states right on the bottle, nor is this my first Belgian dark ale, far from it in fact. So this is my cup of tea (or beer in this case). Now, on to the review!  Appearance: Poured from a 12 oz. bottle (45-50 degrees) into a tulip glass; Raison D'Etre impresses with a rich mahogany color. It is alive with a fair amount of carbonation, which stays consistent throughout the experience. On initial pour the head is brought to the top of the tulip. It dissipates rather quickly though, leaving behind a nice ring in its wake, with minimal lacing.  Smell: The aroma is of sweet Belgian deliciousness with maybe a hint of raisin. So yes the Belgian beet sugars and green raisons seem to be in play! Though the aromas are not overwhelmingly present, it does excite the senses and is rather inviting!  Taste: With the first drink, I am delighted with not only a fruity booziness, but to my surprise the taste of what?...Raisins! This is a true Belgian dark, so no disappointment in that respect. In time the raisins seemingly give way to the taste of booziness and Belgian beet sugars, though it is enjoyable through each sip.  Mouth feel: Once again it IS a true Belgian dark, and don't let the alcohol percentage of eight fool you. It feels heavier than eight percent, which is not meant as a negative or a positive. Carbonation is not an issue, with a good amount present. It has a full bodied, fruity and heart warming boozy feel that does not disappoint and sits fairly heavily on, but does not overwhelm the palate.  Many beers draw you in with exciting ingredients, of which often turn out to be more or less marketing. I am happy to say with Dogfish Head's Raison D'Etre, this is not the case. Dogfish has a reputation for brewing some very interesting beers and raison d is no exception. 'Raison D'Etre' is a French phrase meaning 'reason for existence'. While this may not be MY reason for existence, I did enjoy and would recommend giving it a taste!",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Belgian Dark Strong Ale,83

Very fruity and refreshing with some different beet like taste. Slightly sweet. Dry finish. Almost no hops.  Mouth feel: Low on carbonation. Some yeast presence makes it silky. Medium feel.

10099,1180,sirdrinkwell,3.33,"A-Poured into a pint glass, Raison D'Être is more a honey amber than mahogany , with moderate head that quickly disappears.  S-the nose is bready, with an undercurrent of earthy dark fruit. Yeast dominates.  T-Tartness of raisin and plum are more evident as I drink, with a spicy yeast undertone. There is a bit of sugary sweetness but it is mitigated by the tartness and spice.  M-Medium body, rich .... There's also a tarty aftertaste.  O-I have yet to truly dislike anything from DFH, but at the same time I have yet to encounter anything anything they make that truly appeals to me. In that sense, and given all the DFH hype that is out there, I find this to be another underwhelming brew, and I find it hard to believe that anyone could have named this ""American Beer of the Year"" in any year.

Now I've had it again and I am beginning to think that the first bottle I got was somehow old or had been poorly kept. I like it a lot better now than my prior review indicated. Thus, I'm doing a completely new review on this one, and changing the scores.  Brown with amber notes and clear. One finger head and so-so lace.  Definitely a bubblegum component to the aroma. Fruity and a little spicy, with some maltiness.  Flavor is more bready and toasted malty but still has some bubblegum character, a little spiciness, and some raisiny fruitiness. Alcohol is pretty noticeable. A bit muddled and chaotic.  Body is slick and thick, carbonation is pretty low, and alcohol is noticeable, moreso than it should be for an 8% beer.  Overall it's a beer in chaos, but it's not bad. I really don't think this fits the Belgian strong dark ale category nearly as well as it would fit the brown ale category, except for perhaps the yeast.

Very mild herbal and earthy hops near the end. Never very sweet. Mild bitter finish  Medium body, moderate carbonation, wet mouthfeel  Overall this beer didn't not impress me, I was really hoping the raisins or malt would be highlighted but overall I didn't enjoy the taste from beginning to end and was just left a bit confused at the inspiration for this brew.

The head vanishes quickly with the slightest retention, leaving hardly no lacing.  I take a whiff and get upfront sweet dark fruits like that of raisin, dates, and grapes.... There are Belgian yeast notes with a little tartiness, as well.  While drinking, I taste the same as the nose with plum, raisin, and grapes....

Overall, Dogfish Head is one of my favorite American breweries.... I love everything they put out.... To be ""American Beer of the Year"", though.... C'mon.... I enjoy much of their other brews as much as, or more than, this particular one.... Perhaps, it's because I LOVE Belgian beers so much, and they represent this as a Belgian style....

10099,1180,axeman9182,3.71,"12 oz bottle, dated 7/20/12. It was poured into my Neighbor of the Beast tulip.  Raison D'Etre pours a fairly translucent ruby red, with a good amount of lighter red highlights. Maybe a finger and half of cream colored foam rises up atop the beer. Head retention is alright, and lacing is fairly disappointing/nonexistent. The nose is simply wonderful. Raisin centric dark fruits lead the charge, braced by a firm supporting aroma of brown sugar. A light clove note completes the picture. The flavor profile doesn't quite follow that layout, to somewhat ill effect. Everything starts out fine, with the raisins, plums, and figs taking the spotlight, but leaving some room for the brown sugar. The finish though is pretty harsh. I don't know if the phenols are just too intense, or there's some unnecessary hop bitterness exacerbating them, but the beer just doesn't close nearly as smoothly as it should. The mouthfeel is decent, with a nice, vibrant carbonation. The body is just a little bit full, but it's a close thing.

For an 8% ABV beer this one is VERY well balanced, the alcohol is really well hidden and is not over-powering. Dark malty notes are the defining feature here, some mild candied fruit, fairly light.  This beer is a little light in this regard, almost watery. Palate coverage is poor and the flavor fades as soon as you swallow.

10099,1180,Jadjunk,3.2,"Picked up a sixer of this in July after enjoying it on tap. It is one of Dogfish Head's staple year rounds in the lineup. A six pack sets one back roughly $10. The label states that Raison D'Être is ""A deep mahogany ale brewed with Belgian beet sugars, green raisins & a sense of purpose"". The beer is brewed in the the style of a Belgian Strong Dark Ale. Bottled on 5/03/12, shy of 6 months from date.  Poured from a 12 oz. bottle to my Dogfish Head Signature glass. Served at 49º Fahrenheit.  (Appearance) Pours a crisp bronze cream head with an average retention at best and a very fizzy texture. Body color is a deep mahogany red with abundant carbonation. Appearance is decent, although the head quality falls short. 3  (Smell) Tart fruits, belgian sugars, light spicy cinnamon bread and medium potent alcohol tones. Not as enjoyable as the first time I smelled it, it's components are a bit busy but they don't all complement each other. There's some heat from the alcohol and a pleasing belgian syrup background. I'm not sure if the aromas are muddled due to the age of the drink or if it's bottle-pertinent, but the aroma isn't as pleasing this time around. 3  (Taste) Light syrup bready malt front with a faint spice and alcohol on the smoky finish. Fruit tones bring a mild tartness to the beer. There is a bit of heat from the alcohol and not all of the flavors gel well in this beer. With a more flavorful and substantial malt body the end result may round out better. Overall, it's not the shining star of Dogfish's repertoire, but it's drinkable. 3.5  (Mouthfeel) Texture is quite light, carbonation is faint with a slick texture. Body is light for Belgian Strong Darks and medium overall. Alcohol presence is medium. The texture is a bit underwhelming. It shouldn't be spritely crisp but a little more air could help shadow some of the alcohol and compliment the delicate fruit tones. 3  (Overall) I found this much less impressive the second time around. It goes a bit too shallow on the body, a little too slick on the texture and a bit too harsh on the alcohol makes the drink less enjoyable than it should be. I'd recommend drinking this as fresh as possible and preferably on tap for the most enjoyable experience. 3  Dogfish Head Craft Brewery's Raison D'Être 3.23/5.00",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Belgian Dark Strong Ale,83
10099,1180,veinless,2.81,"Pours a crystal clear, dark amber with a thin, quickly dissipating head that left no lacing at all. Looks borderline watery to me.  Smells of sweet fruit, with dates and raisins coming to mind the most. A sugary note pervades the aroma all the way through. Almost like a fruit-jam type smell.  Taste is thankfully not as pungently sweet at the front, with the raisins a nice, semi-sweet flavor. Malts come out after initial taste to sweeten the deal, though not in a way I like. Tiny bit of date character that resembles a sweet rind of a citrus fruit (very strange, but think about it). Alcohol offers its own flavor as well with a bit of warmth. Sourness arrives as the beer warms.  Mouthfeel is quite thin and bubbly, with a corrosive element to it. Feels a little bit too much like pop. Drinkability saved from disaster by the late-arriving sourness, but still isn't great.

The head was 2 fingers in size and lasted a little while before dropping to a nice lacing.  S- Sweet with dark sugars. pleasant.  T- Very sweet. Good body. There's an earthy tone i assume comes from the beats and a dark sweet that must come from the raisins. The bitter shows up after that to clear away some of the sweetness. Leaving a light but clean earthy fruity taste that lingers away.  M- Smooth feel with a fine texture. Medium in body.  O- Very enjoyable beer.

Can't see through it. Only thing really lacking here is a nice head. It poured with only about 2 centimeters of white head which quickly dissipated.  Smell: some spicy alcohol esters. Mild dark fruits with that typical Belgian yeast and malt nose. Nice but not a very strong nose. Have to really look for the nose on this one until it warms and opens up. Once you let that happen it is very pleasant.  Taste: lots of Belgian yeast and malt similar to most strong Belgian beers. A good bit of warming alcohol which is spicy in the front and warming going down. Dark and sweet fruits and picking up some of that green grape after taste that lingers and sticks to your mouth.  Mouthfeel: not much to the head but this beer's carbonation really comes through once you get it into your mouth. Just the way I like my strong Belgians, slick but bubbly and spicy.

It is a bit thin and fruity but for a Belgian style it really hits the spot with it's American craft brew twists. It does taste a bit wild and the smell is awesome. I think it would be better as a sour beer but it's very complex as is.  From a bottle into a tulip/snifter. Low easily fading head typical of some true Belgian beers. A: looks great like a sour red and even smells like it could be one but it does look great in a glass S: smells phenomenal. Fruity with a hint of that Russian imperial stout smell but very subdued.

10099,1180,CheezyBlaster,3.68,"Not bad at all. Dark, brown, and robust pour. Shades of red/ruby. Short finger of a head fades over a minute.  Smell: a dark Belgian ale. Hint of dark fruit, but mostly a mild sweet-beet aroma, brown sugar, molasses, touch of raisin.  Mouth follows similarly. (All 5 I've had over the week start off with a tin/stainless steel-like taste that fades after 2 sips) Classic Belgian yeasts, but very subdued, relatively. The malt guides the flow. The beets and raisins advertised on the bottle show up and shape the piece, but do not dominate. Mildly spicy -probably the hops? Mild is a good word for this brew. Very dangerous 8% beer. If I loved the flavor and feel, I'd get into trouble, fast.  Good American take on this style. Not a fan of the style, but I appreciate the work; raisins with beet sugar are a good addition. I mean, I don't want to slim this down to a one-dimensional review, but it's like a mild, alcohol-hiding, dark Belgian ale with hints of beet sweetness and genuine raisin.

10099,1180,rickyleepotts,3.32,"This beer has roots in wine. Hey, that’s OK with me. I just started a part-time job at Total Wine, and we don’t carry this… maybe we should! Anyway, the beer has a cool name and I am excited to try it. Just this week I grabbed a bottle of 120 Minute IPA. That beer is so hard to come by, I think I am going to leave that in the cellar for a while. But this one has been in the fridge for quite some time, and I am curious what it tastes like.  In the Glass: It looks like a barleywine in the glass. Speaking of barleywines, the Firestone website lists the Firestone Walker Double DBA as a barleywine. It’s not… the label even says “imperial special bitter”. Anyway, this beer is dark, ruby red and looks like a barleywine. The beer doesn’t have any head at all, and no lace to speak of. Maybe this beer really does taste like a wine.  Nose: Whoa… that beer smells incredible. It’s sweet, and again reminds me as a barleywine. I have never heard of Belgian beet sugar… but whatever it is, it makes this beer smell incredible. I am sure it packs a punch on the palate as well. I wonder if anyone has ever released a beer called the Palate Puncher… a double IPA would make sense!  Flavor: And it tastes like a barleywine. It has a very smooth, almost flat consistency across the palate and packs a punch of flavors. It is somewhat complex, starting smooth and sweet and finishing strong and somewhat malty. The beer is very enjoyable, and for the advanced flavors that I am experiencing, I am shocked at the price. Sipping this makes me wonder what foods would pair well with it.  Mouthfeel: The mouthfeel is nice. It start smooth and flat, and stays that way until the finish. The fact there is no head and basically no lace makes sense with how this beer goes down. I bet this would taste incredible on cask. I did swish it around in my mouth a little bit, and that opened up some new flavors. Nothing crazy. The sweetness really overwhelms the entire palate.  Aftertaste: The aftertaste, for such a powerful beer, isn’t as impressive. It is sort of there and gone again. When I struggle to get some flavors from the swallow, I am tasting fig and some sweet maltiness toward the finish of the swallow. But the aftertaste is nothing to write home about.  I must say, for a beer that I had no idea what to expect… I am pleasantly surprised. The flavors are incredible, and the aroma is wonderful. Look at me… using all these big adjectives. Anyway, I am a big fan of sweet malty beers, and this one fits that realm. I would totally buy this again. I wonder if this tastes better closer to room temperature… yeah, I am sure it does.

Belgian yeast funk as well. Taste is full of complexity. Dark fruits and banana with a cocoa and coffee flair. Think mocha with a light shot of banana syrup. Dry chalky finish with a pleasing pucker that while not hoppy gives a similar clean crispness. Light syrupy feel and mild carbonation. A very nice take on the style and quite drinkable.

Well at least a really promising beer. None of that super-upfront pungent sourness which many American dubbels and darks get wrong when it comes to Beligans. It tastes like the hops mean business but are perfectly tempered by the sweetness of the malt and creamy texture.  I think the components - looks decent, smells appetizing, tastes yummy, feels good - appear to add up to a solid but uninteresting beer. It's actually an interesting swirl though these territories with its own distinctive feel.

I'm typically a whisky connoisseur when I have a real meaty meal but the other night I decided I was going to branch out. I was at as small plate restaurant called ""girl and the goat"" which I highly recommend in Chicago. Any ways I told the waitress I wanted a full body beer that had somewhat of a bitter/sweet finish, she recommended the Raison D'Etre. Needless to say this beer did not disappoint. The brew was full of flavor and match quite well with my steak and fish. This has become my new favorite beer when I only want one or two drinks with a nice steak.

It looks really good with about two fingers of head and a dark brown/red coloring.  I like the smell coming off the top. You do really easily pick up the raisin smell. I also get that rich dark ale presence. It works well.  The flavor really falls off. I don't get much balance in my glass. The raisin presence drops off unless you pull air across it.

It poured with a thick cherry/tan head that quickly faded to near nothingness. Barely a trace of lacing, but the carbonation is really alive and bubbly.  S- Raisins, figs, prunes, banana's, sweet caramel and whisps of alcohol. The banana's really open up as this one warms up. Lots of fall pie spices round out the nose.  T- Deep and sweet dark caramel, dried figs, raisins, over-ripe banana, sweet dark malt, brown sugar, molasses, and pumpkin pie spices. Big notes of clove, cinnamon, nutmeg, allspice and ginger as it warms up.  M- Kind of thin and wimpy. Really wish it was as sticky as the nose tells you it could be. The carbonation completely fades after a short time and leaves the tongue kind of dull and limp. The booze wakes and warms you, but this is a low point for this brew.

Cinnamon, vinalla and other spices are somewhere in the complexity of this brew's aroma as well.  A very malty, syrapy taste with a little bit of hop character near the front of the taste. The raisins and smooth caramel/vanilla are definately still there, but the complexity loses once you begin tasting it.  It's a very thick and syrapy beer, with low to medium carbonation.

10099,1180,elNopalero,2.69,"Not sure how to classify this beer exactly so I’ll just report on what my impressions are without the style getting in the way.  Poured this from a bottle into a stemmed glass. I was rewarded with an amber-ruby hued beverage capped by a dose of billowy foam.  I get a … conflicting aroma, one that’s musty, murky, with notes of stone fruits colliding with a cloying malt backbone. There’s a faint green apple (or dried apple) hint on the back met with caramel… why am I thinking of caramel apples here?  Unfortunately or not the flavor follows suit, with a thick caramel apple malt profile and some more of that cloying caramel sweetness. I get a boozy imbalance that’s far too pronounced for an 8% ABV beer. Finishes tacky without being chewy, and makes me think of a run-of-the-mill amber ale.  At the end I think of an out of balance Belgian quad. This is all over the place, and not in a way that I like.

Persistent ring of suds and etching at bottom of goblet continues to funnel carbonation upward through beer.  S- Alcohol and sweeteness ... brown sugar, caramel, malt. As the beer warms the alcohol becomes even more prominent.  T- Dry with a nice bitterness. Hops and some brown sugar, not present in the smell, come out. A slight hint of raisins. I paired the meal with some grilled foods, finding lamb drew out the raisin flavor and a finishing bitterness while corn brought out the dryness.

Somebody else mentioned toffee. Maybe that's it. The slight beginnings of a bitter tang in the back of the throat in the aftertaste but not quite. It's almost like there's a hint of wood tannin in there.  M - Light-medium and finishes, if not quite dry, then on the edge of crisp.  O - Really not what I was expecting and not as complex as I was expecting, but really solid, pleasant, and satisfying. This is a rich and tasty beer that I would welcome anytime.

10099,1180,jegross2,3.47,"Reviewing the Raison D'Être from Dogfish Head Craft Brewery. Score: 83  Bottled on 08/09/11, served in a pint glass at Merkles Bar & Grill in Wrigleyville and enjoyed on 03/31/12 with my good friend Bryan Hernandez.  Appearance: Pours a murky, blood orange colored core that fades to a dull late sunset colored outline. Minimal head at pour, just a little bubble tan layer that quickly settles. Minimal oily lacing, below average retention. 3/5  Smell: Brown sugar, Belgian yeast, cinnamon and nutmeg. Raisin, fig, banana, creamy vanilla, and doughy bread (Hernandez swears it smells like the Guinness bread he baked the other week). The menu says there is ""beet sugar"" in the aroma, but I would not have guessed it if the menu did not tell me that. 3.5/5  Taste: First impression is yeast and doughy bread with a modest vanilla twist. There is a dry and nondescript earthy bitterness (hops?) on the back half of the palate. Malty wheat, banana bread and an earthy nuttiness on the midpalate. Some light raisin flavor, without the sweetness, mixed throughout. None of the brown sugar or cinnamon from the aroma is seemingly present in the flavor. Finishes with a lingering Belgian yeast flavor that is a bit sugary. 3.5/5  Mouthfeel: Medium bodied, medium carbonation. Smooth, slightly oily mouthfeel. Very dry, and a little acidic upfront. 3.5/5  Overall: Most DFH brews, given their experimental approach to craft, tend to be hit-or-miss, but this one falls somewhere between. I enjoyed this beer, and it was solid, but I would not have ordered another. I doubt I would buy this at the store in the future either, having previously tried it. DFH makes much better beers (e.g., Miles Davis Bitches Brew) than this, but they also make plenty that are way worse (e.g., Faithfull Ale).  Recommendation: Worth trying, but not worth seeking out.  Pairings: Roasted chicken.  Cost: $5 for a 12 oz bottle at the bar.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Belgian Dark Strong Ale,83
10099,1180,RickS95,3.02,"Doesn't remind me of a Belgian dark ale. It's brown, but it's a loose looking, almost clear brown. The head is a letdown, there one second and gone the next.  I pick up some malt and caramel in the nose, with only the slightest bit of raisin when I agitate the glass.  The tongue picks up some raisin and malt, but little else. I still have a hard time considering this a Belgian strong dark ale. Maybe in another category it would score better, but it's a sloppy tasting Belgian.  Very malty from beginning to end, so there's a slight creaminess to it. But the beet sugars take over with an aggressive feel that doesn't really go with it. Has an Earthy finish.  I'm not a fan of most Dogfish Head beers and this is very average at best.

T - Caramelized brown sugar upfront. More caramelized sugar in the body, but a fair amount of tangy green raisin taste comes out as well. The raisin flavor crescendos as the beer passes over the back of the tongue, then the brown sugar resumes control in the finish.  M - Medium bodied with moderate carbonation. Fairly delicate, but not nearly as good as other examples of the style.  Definitely a unique brew here using belgian beet sugars and green raisins. Some may find it extraordinary, I found it to get on my nerves after about half the bottle. It hides its alcohol well enough and has a decent mouthfeel, but the caramelized brown sugar and green raisin notes didn't work together.

Medium to above average quality lacing. Head reduces fairly quickly.  For taste, kind of hard to draw an opinion on the first few sips, but after a while you can start to pick up on the beet sugars and a little bit on the raisins as well.

10099,1180,Hopdaemon39,3.35,"Poured from a 12 oz bottle into a tulip- poured a clear reddish brown (as they say, mahogany) with very little head, very slight retention and lacing.  Upon first whiff I smell green grapes and alchohol. A second try yields some yeast.  First taste is overwhelmingly alcoholic for a beer that is by no means off the charts in that category. Definite minus... Trying to ignore that, there are notes of raisins and dark malt plus some of the yeast (unfortunately, that taste is mixed in with the alcohol burn at the end). Finishes sweet with the green raisins.  Mouthfeel is good- moderate carbonation around the edges and a good medium body. This is an odd one- DFH certainly has a fascination with grapes, which I feel do not belong in beer.

Nice mixture of smells. Complex pile of flavors. Some of the same sweetnes from the sugars, molasses and caramel flavors. Some spiciness, almost yeasty notes as well. Herbal, earthy hop finish. Lots of alcohol coming through as well. Medium body and carbonation, not really as smooth and creamy as I was expecting, a bit of a hot finish from the alcohol. Overall this is a complex, and flavor filled beer, but just didn't do anything for me. I guess I had a different idea for a Belgian Dark Ale. It is good, but just not for me.

Pours as described: mahogany, with a finger of honey cream foam that falls to a scattered surface leaving cobweb lace. Smells of raisins, honey, candy, and the slightest hint of brown sugar. Flavor is sweet and malty. Plenty of the candy sugar comes through, and the malts seem appropriately oxidized adding just a hint of woody character. There is a nice, subtle belgian character in the yeast, but not nearly as dominant as the homeland offerings. Nice, moderate body is matched with a good, smooth and prickly carbonation.

10099,1180,drtth,3.77,"Poured into a dimpled mug. Glass of cold water on the side to sip from periodically.  Appearance: As poured the beer is a rich mahogany color with a 1/8” head that lasts a while but doesn’t leave much lacing. The head recedes to a thin irregular island on the liquid. Sipping produces little lacing, mostly small speckles that slide back down into the beer.  Smell: The aroma is nice and complex with some raisins, traces of dark fruit, some dark caramel, and a touch of yeast.  Taste: As expected from the nose, the flavors are dominated by the raisins and there is also some dark fruit present. The sweetness reminds of dark caramel but with a touch of alcohol. The yeastiness is definitely Belgian.  Mouthfeel: The mouthfeel is on the full side of medium bodied and quite smooth with gentle carbonation. The finish begins in the fruit and sweetness which all fades gradually away.  Drinkability and Overall Impression: I’ve had this one before and I’ll be having it again. It’s a pleasant, easy drinker that’s good for sipping while reading or along with dinner and conversation with friends. My overall impression is that this is a well made beer that is worth visiting and re-visiting once in a while. It doesn’t beat out the better made Belgian beers but holds its own amongst the many average beers made in Belgium.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Belgian Dark Strong Ale,83

Small amounts of patchy lacing.  S – Somewhat bizarre aroma of grapes, raisin, Belgian yeasts, and fusel alcohols.  T – Sweet brown sugar and roasted grains upfront, with esters of white grape, raisin, prune, and molasses. Can taste a bit of earthy hops in the finish. The whole mix has sort of a port wine character. Also finishes with a little metallic solvent taste. Overall taste is not bad, aftertaste aside. Alcohol present in the finish as it warms.  M – Very low carbonation. Thin bodied. Slightly syrupy; could probably benefit from a little more carbonation.  O – Kind of a strange blend. None of the individual flavors are bad, and I would hesitate to call it “unbalanced”, but in my opinion the flavors presented didn’t come together very well. A little bit of a mess, and the metallic aftertaste became a little distracting over time. I can see where they were going with this, but ultimately I think it misses the mark a little.

10099,1180,Darkmagus82,3.28,"Poured from bottle into pint glass  Appearance- Poured a light brown or dark mahogany color. A light tan billowy head with big carbonation bubbles was formed upon pouring. The head had a decent retention and upon fading gave moderate lacing.  Smell – Sweet dark fruit and caramel aromas are up front. The dark fruit is mainly raisin and a bit of cherry in nature. The smell finishes off with a more white wine like aroma of white grapes and alcohol.  Taste –An interesting combination of tastes. It starts out with more roasted malty flavors with mixed with a bit of sugary and caramel sweetness. Toward the middle, a more dry white wine taste of grapes comes to fruition. This starts to overshadow the more grainy-malty tastes, which towards the end dominates the taste profile. At the very end of the taste your mouth is left with a light tannin taste that lingers for quite a while.  Mouthfeel – A medium body with a moderate level of carbonation. Very average for a beer of this strength.  Overall – Not really my type of beer. It had a bit too much of a wine like flavor, almost as though a white wine was mixed with a brown ale.

Then a quick blast of booze (definitely an 8% beer as advertised! Then it fades away to a more roasty coffee-like flavor. The coffee taste lingers long past the gulp. This isn't quite what I was expecting and i'm not a huge fan but that's also because of my personal dislike of most roasty/coffee like beers so I won't penalize it heavily for that.

10099,1180,Smakawhat,4.4,"It's been a long road. It's time to revist this beer from such a long time ago. Dated October 28th 2011, poured into an official Dogfish Head Raison D'etre goblet. Loved this so much back in the day I bought the glasses for it.  Not much head produced barley a finger through a center punch, what is there is a faint caramel/tan that falls and leaves a good collar and slight puck. What a gorgeous body color this is though, red amber and clear with these brown edges. It really looks like a ruby.  Nose is slighty raisin, but it smells like baked fresh fruitcake. Cherries, carmalized sugars, fresh baked bread. Topped with powdered sugar and cinnamon. Real impressive.  I am going to knock my taste and mouthfeel score down slightly here. Slightly wetter palate than most Belgian Strong Dark Ales, but misses the viscosity angle. Bready tasty action in the fore front, but not much of the sweetness or fruit character comes through. Finish is a little citrus like, with a little carbonation prickly sting and raisin, it's still quite neat as I remember it.  Overal I still really like this, I think my enthusiasm for this beer though has gone down having tried more of this style from other producers in Belgium. However, I still really enjoy it, strangely I use to be able to get it more often but I rarely see it around as much. Too bad.  Old Review (Feb 6th 2010)  Hands down my go to beer, Raison D'etre is a perfectly bodied, complicated aroma of raisin and somewhat dark bread bouquet. Has a thick mouthfeel and has a wonderful lingering finish as well.  Had on tap and in bottles and both manage to be downright refreshing when well.  I say well, because the beer does have a SHORT shelf life and it's very easy to get a bad one, or have one from a tap that has been sitting too long. When you do, it becomes extremely sour tasting and the bouquet is dead.  Even still I absolutely love this beer.

Mmmm...boozy.  Taste is fresh hop flavour, sour raisins, some generic maltiness, a thick syrup flavour and some alcohol burn to bring it all up a notch in yumminess. It's like a syrupy, boozy, sour raisin treat. If that's not what you want, don't try it, but in my opinion, it's not bad at all. Yum yum yum.  Mouthfeel is thick and syrupy.

Pours with about a 1/2 inch of cream colored head, which dissipates and settles around the rim.  S - Sweet. Malty. Hoppy. White wine/grapes. I presume that's the raisins coming through.  T - The beer is mostly flat and tasteless. it doesn't offer much at the beginning or the end, but ends with a moderate amount of hoppy bitterness. Leaves behind a light lingering bitterness in the mouth. A bit of the sweetness of the beer also comes through as you drink more.  M - Smooth and well rounded beer. Get a bit of the alcohol coming through. a bit of residue on the tongue. Not a clean finish.  The beer starts off very promising. The color and aroma is certainly appealing and implies that the beer will deliver more than just that. However, the beer takes a real dive in quality when it comes to the taste.

Filed up half the glass and left some very nice streaky lacing as it settled, leaving a hint of froth at the surface. Beer itself is a crystal clear, and I mean crystal, brown with a hint of red.  Smell- Syrupy sweet, heavy caramel with touches of orange peel, grape, stone fruits, and a sharp solvent twang. Alcohol is almost masked by the sweetness, but still stands out. This beer has a bouquet like a punch in the face- it would probably work better than smelling salts.  Taste- Fairly mellow after the nose, sweet banana and plum at the start, raisin in the middle, fading to roasted grains and alcohol. Strong metallic aftertaste, like I just chewed on aluminum foil.  Mouthfeel- Drinks like a lightly carbonated watered-down red table wine, the grape tannins are very present and overcome most of the other sensations. It leaves a coated metallic feeling something like after you gargle listerine, which is off-putting. Otherwise ends surprisingly clean, considering how sweet it is.  Overall- It's interesting, but the metallic aftertaste and feeling ruin it a bit for me. I've seen the price on this brew fluctuate quite a bit, which I assume means the brewery has gone through a couple revisions- hopefully they figure it out.

Not crazy about the slight off-putting cleaner-ish type notes in the finihsh, much like the DFH Punk. Overall, however, it's a winner.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Belgian Dark Strong Ale,83
10099,1180,dtivp,3.45,"Pours a dark mahogany brown with hues of red, a thin light tan head that disappears quickly, no lacing.  Aroma of sweet dark fruit, burnt sugar and alcohol.  Taste of sweet dark fruits, raisins, dates, figs, with candied sugar and a hint of alcohol.  Mouth Feel was medium body, very little carbonation, thick syrupy and sticky.  Overall I was a little overwhelmed with the sweetness, DFH captured the raisins as billed. A beer to be enjoyed after dinner in place of dessert.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Belgian Dark Strong Ale,83
10099,1180,ArrogantDeadGuy,4.35,"pours a deep rusty brown/orange with little head. The sweet malt and alcohol are immediately apparent. Sweet dried fruit and yeast notes underly the malt fragrance.  Well balanced, belgian strong, nice hop finishing the sweet crisp malt flavors. The dried fruit and yeastiness are nice and were a little underplayed in the aroma.  Well bodied brew neither thick nor thin, with a clean finish. Very crisp and refresing. A nice represenation of a style that I usually find too sweet and slick on the pallet.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Belgian Dark Strong Ale,83
10099,1180,crhensel,4.42,"(12 oz bottle into tulip) I've been looking forward to this one for a long time! Poured a deep mahogany (as advertised) with a small frothy off white head that fell quickly. Nose is strong of raisin and pit fruit in general and was very appealing. The drink is very smooth and the beer has a medium body on the tongue. Hints of the alcohol dominate at first, but the aftertaste is of the fruit and malt which is a refreshing sweet finish. One of the better offerings from Dogfish Head to be sure!",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Belgian Dark Strong Ale,83
10099,1180,Kuromaru,3.77,"Appearance--Pours a deep, semi-opaque ruby. Some amber/ deep orange hues show up in good light. Produces a thick, oatmealy head that dissipates fairly quickly.  Smell--Complex. Grape-y/ winey, sugary/ (toasted) malty/ bready, some yeast and some spice (allspice?). Grape seems to be the most prominent fruity note, but there's also fig, plum and raisin. Some tartness. Alcohol is not prominent. Overall, a definite ""dried, aged fruit"" vibe.  Mouthfeel--You can almost feel the moderate carbonation struggling in the heavy, sticky body. Like glue on the palate.  Taste--Some bittersweet chocolate notes show up in the taste. Big, big malt presence. Unripened grape and wine. Yeast and alcohol more subdued in taste than smell.  Overall--A lot to consider. A truly robust, flavorful beer. It's impossibly heavy and probably overly sugary for most palates. Definitely worth a try, though. Perhaps not a masterful rendition of the Belgian Strong Dark Ale, but it gives your togue plenty to think about.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Belgian Dark Strong Ale,83
10099,1180,BuzzLitebier,3.54,"Had this on tap at the 9:30 Club in DC poured into a plastic cup.  It was dark, and the cup wasn't clear, so I couldn't get a good indication of the true color. It did have a bit of head, though. Smelled of concord grapes and dark fruit (dates, raisins). Sweet taste and definitely had the dark fruit taste with a bit of ketones and bubblegum that are reminiscent of a dark Belgian. It was almost a syrupy mouthfeel with a bit of carbonation.  It's definitely drinkable, but not my favorite. I'll have it when it's available but not seek it out.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Belgian Dark Strong Ale,83
10099,1180,xensure,3.65,"Poured from a 12oz into a Wiezen glass.  A - Pours dark, but when held up to the light it appears as a nice deep ruby.  S - Pungent sweet fruits come to the nose. Mostly grapes in all states, grapes and raisins, and dates.  T - Extremely sweet, a bit syrupy still. I see that made some changes from Bros' review. I don't get any lingering alcohol taste. The 8% is hidden well and only gives you a slight warmth on the very end of the finish. I like the aisin and sweet fruit flavor, but it isn't balanced with any type of sour, whether that be hops or something else.  O - A decent beer, but probably not worth buying 6 of. If your liquor store lets you mix and match like mine, it may be worth throwing in a pack of some IPAs of very bitter beers to balance out the pack, but other than that I would say a one time buy.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Belgian Dark Strong Ale,83
10099,1180,Siriusfisherman,3.65,"Appearance: Very dark amber with a thin white head. Good amount of carbonation bubbles running up the side of the glass.  Smell: Nice hints of dark fruit, raisins especially. I would have guessed that they used dark raisins and not green raisins, but the description says otherwise. You also can smell some of that signature belgian sweetness and breadiness.  Taste: Some nice bitterness upfront that is balanced out with a strange fruity flavor. The fruit has a weird sour taste to it, not bad unnecessarily, just a little out of place or maybe over the top. There is a huge breadiness explosion upon the exit, took me aback. The taste is very nice, but there are a few off-putting aspects to it.  Mouthfeel: Very full carbonation, not the typical champagne character that you would get in a belgian style ale of this sort. It doesn't compliment the taste as well as a traditional path would have. The body is very full though.  Overall: This is a nice beer, but it is quite out of balance in my opinion and seems to suffer from it quite a bit. I liked it, but I don't think I would buy a six pack.

Smells very sweet and inviting with a little complexity.  Very sweet upfront. Tastes like it smells. Sugary, raisiny, malty. Something to be said for truth in advertising. Slight bitter hop bite in in the finish is nice to cut the sweetness.  Mouthfeel is very nice and the slight carbonation works well for this beer.  Overall I'm enjoying this beer. I havent had it in about 4 years. The color and aroma are very appealing and I think I was looking for more complexity in the glass.

Taste is fairly sweet with a big malt bill, fruity yeastiness, grape, cherry berries with caramel notes at times. Light carbonation, silky-sticky texture, med-full body, nice weight. This grew on me as I drank it and by the end it was pretty good, the first few sips were a little off putting.

A little bit of bready maltiness as well.  Head has now receded to a thick lace. Lots of bready malts up front finishes with a big sugared raisin sweetness. Pretty cloying actually. Alcohol is noticeable as well.  Medium to big in body, some caramel present somewhere in the middle of the beer. Creamy mouthfeel. A strange and dissapointing brew.

10099,1180,DefenCorps,2.07,"Bottled on the 13th of October 2011, consumed on the 1st of December. I'm making pancakes for breakfast on Saturday, and figured I'd grab something to make a fun syrup with.  Pouring a clear amber with a thin, off-white head that falls off to a ring rather quickly, leaving no lacing. The nose is rather intensely sweet, though the smell is rather unique in that it leans so heavily on the sugar beets, with a mild phenolic note. Spicy alcohol, and a fruity golden raisin character are all noticeable. Mildly hoppy as well, with an earthy bitterness in the back. Intriguing.  The palate, on the other hand, is a bit of a mess. Spicy alcohol and phenols combine to make a rather paint-thinner like beer with a mild raisin sweetness in the mid-palate before a moderately strong bitterness takes over in the finish, completely ruining everything. The sugar beets add plenty of sweetness. Now, the paint thinner dissipates as the beer breathes, making it moderately more palatable and brings to mind cheap rum, but the bitterness on the finish really clashes with the raisins and the fruity yeast. Full in body, mildly soapy and slick, this beer is lightly carbonated and rather disappointing. I can't imagine drinking more than 4oz at a time, let alone a 4 pack.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Belgian Dark Strong Ale,83

A sweet malty character with an alcohol after taste. Not really able to pick up on the raisins, but the sugars are pronounced. Showing it's true 8.0% ABV.  Not sure if I would purchase this for myself, however it was a gift from my brother so you can't pass that up!

Sunset Copper, modestly carbonated with a 2 finger pecan sandy head that dissapates quickly and leaves scant lacing.  Aroma of deeply toasted caramel malt, alcohol esters and a faint burnt toffee aroma.  Mouthfeel: light and silky.  Taste: much like the aroma; a bed of malt, warming alcohol and a toffeeish fade with a light dark fruit finish.  Notes: This is listed as a BSDA. To me it is too light both in color and in flavor for that, seems a little more like a Doppelbock to me. This is not a bad beer but overall the unmasked alcohol and lack of a strong raisin flavor which is why I bought this beer in the 1st place make it unlikely that I will buy more once this 6 pack is gone.  4 YEARS LATER...

Smell: Weakest point of the beer doesn't compliment the rest of what I am going to write. But that doesn't mean that it is bad. You get a scent of raisins with hint of maple.  Taste: Very complex..raisins, the taste of alcohol is simmering in the back of my mouth and seriously I am in love. Slightly sweet but a perfect imbalance of malt and wine. I have drank Raison D'etre quite a few times and it is a beer which gets better each time you have it.  Mouth: Yum...medium carbonation, perfect bitter after taste while sugars are overwhelming your gums.

S: Sweetness apparent in the nose with a syrup-y like scent. Toasty and bread-y notes do come through. Perhaps some spicy phenols.  T: A strong sweetness. The nose predicts the taste very well. Dark fruits: raisin and prune. Unfortunately, it yielded a bit of a metallic off-flavor, but it did fade as the drink progressed.  M: High carbonation tingle on the tongue. Medium to full body.

Starchy/yeasty texture. Honey & dried fruit. Faint citrus bitterness.  Not as sticky as the bottled stuff. The stiff carbonation eventually falters, & the texture becomes greasy.

Taste is complex because we couldn't even figure out how to discribe it. Here is our best shot: rum raisen pudding with an alcohol trailer. As it warms up it takes on a more nut-like coffee flavor.

Aroma- Very rich malt and caramel aroma. Has a TON of raisin in here also with some cherries or other dark fruits. Fantastic!  Appearance- Received with a .5 or less finger head that only keeps a ring around the brew. Has a deep amber colored body with great clarity. Leaves thick lacing from the top to bottom of the glass.  Flavor- Very malty and “semi-sweet”. Doesn’t overpower here but on the flip side, throws tons of raisin and fig into the mouth. Phenomenal! Very complexed also.  Mouthfeel- Medium Bodied, High Carbonation, Smooth, and goes down with ease. Nothing big on the palate is left though... Wish these raisins could stick around!  Overall Impression- An interesting brew (like anything from DogFish!). Rich and a great Belgian.

Small head that quickly disappeared.  -Smell 3.5: Very nice bouquet. I smell many, many sugary smells: caramel, brown sugar, molasses...hmmm. Makes me wonder if the beer itself will be a bit on the sweet side.  -Taste 3.5: Sweet taste up front, with a...sweet taste in the middle and some very nice -but very slight-- sourness and hoppiness present after the swallow. Long aftertaste. There is an interesting, almost cinnamon and clove taste in the middle of this beer that reminds me of another beer I drank a few years ago...Dogfish Head Punkin. I don't find it unpleasant, but it's interesting: perhaps if one is so inclined, one may try the more expensive ""Punkin"" by trying a six pack of the more affordable ""Raison.""  -Mouthfeel 3.5: Good mouthfeel. There is almost too much carbonation in this beer, but the sweetness manages to smooth it out. Slightly creamy feel is also a plus.  -Overall 3.5: This is a average to good beer with some very unique flavor characteristics that I now see are indicative of several brews from Dogfish Head. Not that it is a bad thing. I think that this beer is slightly better than average, but the things that make it better than average are negatively impacted by the sweetness present in this beer. It is just a little TOO sweet to be a session beer, but it desperately wants to be a session beer. I've written too much about this beer. It's worth a try if you've never had it.

I first enjoyed 90 minute IPA most, then branched out to Palo Santo, 120 Minute, Indian Pale Ale, and Burton Baton.  I enjoyed each in it's own right, but when it comes down to it, after my pallette for Dogfish beers has settled a bit, Indian Brown and Raison stand out as being the most quaffable and tasty.  90 minute is a jem, and all their beers are better than 99.9% out there, but these 2 mainstream brews in their portfolio stand out for many reasons.  Firstly they are immenantly quaffable. While not session beers per se, drinking one of each in a sitting is a perfect progression. Each has complex flavors, crisp sweetness, burnt notes, and a clean finsih. Each hides the ABV beautifully.  I would choose Raison D'etre above em all.

Taste includes alcohol, heavy malt, sweet dark fruit. Mouthfeel is tough...lots of alcohol and much flavor to try and mask it. To me the balance is a bit off.

The smell has a nice amount of alcohol, some sweetness and maybe caramel.  The taste is pretty good. The first thing I get is about of alcohol. It also has a nut brown taste and a nutty after taste.  The mouthfeel is sort of like your basic beer, with maybe a little less carbonation.  Overall this is a good beer.

A 12 oz bottle can be easily serve two people! I drank this beer slowly letting it warm. I was getting a bit spicy ripe banana with the rich tang of fermented raisins. Tang is the word here. M - I like this beer! There is a buzzy mouthfeel to this brew that is close to drinking a rich brandy. O - A good beer to be drunk slowly in small quantities by a fire.

The taste was very one dimensional with raisins being the only thing shinning here. The mouth feel was fairly thin as well with no malt coming in to back up the flavor on the front.

A strong pour yields a 1-finger tan-colored head that fades over a couple minutes to a thick, even covering and thick foam ring. The body is a clear, dark red bronze with strong streams of carbonation bubbles. Thick lacing attempts to cling to the sides of the glass, but never lasts very long.  The nose is dark and sweet with an overlying alcohol character. Notes of banana, brown sugar, and dark fruits, including raisin and plum, are all prevalent.  Sweet, caramelized malts start each sip with notes of caramel and brown sugar. As the beer is swallowed, dark fruits flavors come out with notes of raisins and plums. Spicy hops flavors also add an extra dimension to this beer. As this beer warms, the alcohol overtones become more and more apparent.  Medium bodied with moderate carbonation, this beer has a smooth mouthfeel. The body is a little thick and slightly sticky.

The taste of the beer is pretty sweet and has lots of dark fruit and sugars in there. It's more like a dessert beer I feel personally.

I get dark fruit and raisins up front, and then it goes sweet on me. I smell the candy sugar as well as caramel and lots of malt.  Caramel and malt are the first flavors to say ""hi!"" This is followed by candy sugar, raisins and other dark fruit, along with something a little tart and almost appley tucked in there. This is followed by a bread flavor that seems to have a little woody touch to it and ends with just a kiss of alcohol.  Medium bodied, and just a tad sticky on the back of the tongue. Medium dryness from the middle of the tongue back to the throat. Medium to heavy carbonation helps move the beer along.  Overall, I like it.

The flavor has a muddled blend of molasses, raisins, plums, a spicy combination of hops and alcohol, and even a little chocolate. The fine, selzer-like carbonation, assertive booziness, and the drying finish all distract from the flavor profile, however.

10099,1180,Pahn,3.71,"12oz bottle into a Duvel tulip. Bottled 5/11/11, consumed 8/9/11.  Appearance: Free pour yields a one and a half inch rocky off-white head that dissipates slowly and leaves a few swatches and spots of lacing. Pours a beautiful clear mahogany. Leaves sweeping lacing around the glass. Great looking beer.  Smell: At first, woody, brown ale reminiscent maltiness, with a mild effervescence. Heavy aroma of fresh bread. Mild dark fruity (date) background. With heat, a strong cologne-like character comes out, along with some welcome booziness. Smells good.  Taste: Creamy feel accentuates the fresh breadiness. Malt and ester profile tastes a bit washed out... most of the flavors are rather low impact. A beer is allowed to be subtle, but the impression here is more like a grand eagle having trouble taking off. Smell promised more depth, and more developed, pronounced flavor.  That said, the balance is good. Great, bready and hot aftertaste that has a nice raisin and date character to it. Most of what's happening is good, though there's a mild sourness reminiscent of lesser macro lagers and brown ales.  This is a good cross between an American brown ale and a Belgian strong dark ale. The flavor is actually pretty enjoyable, but it pulls its punches more than either of those styles should.  Mouthfeel: Medium bodied, with a fluffy, creamy feel up front that leads to a prickly carbonation, mild dryness, and a long hot-but-interesting finish. Like the appearance, the mouthfeel displays the formidable skill of the brewers (I just wish the flavor was as impressive).  Overall: The word that I keep coming back to for this beer is ""pleasant"". Unfortunately, the conceit (and the aroma) of this beer promises something a lot bolder and more memorable. It's enjoyable to drink, but it's also questionable whether a flavor experience like this justifies drinking an 8% ABV beer.  Despite the ""pleasant but unremarkable"" vs ""high ABV"" dissonance, this beer would be great if paired with the right food. The bold aroma, reasonably distinctive flavors, and overall low flavor impact could work really well with the right culinary complement.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Belgian Dark Strong Ale,83

Very rich on the nose. The beer's flavor is strong, with a merlot character, and a tangy, sour fruit undertone. The aftertaste is minimal, with a bit of the fruit sweetness again. The finish is dry, and it keeps the flavors from being overpowering or cloying. Deep, dark, and heavy flavors make this one a sipper.

10099,1180,jondeelee,4.42,"A simple whiff of this beer foretells the complexity and deliciousness that awaits. Fragrant and compelling, the nose boasts scents such as oak, toffee, molasses and turbinado sugar, coffee, fresh-cut wheat, plum, and port wine, in addition to an earthiness that defies my description.  On the tongue, the ale is no less impressive, hitting with an immediate burst of sugars and dark-roasted grains (chocolate malts, dark cocoa, molasses) that swiftly turns into a wonderful blend of port wine, nuanced fruit esters (plum, grape, pear) and toasted grains. Don't be put off by the label's notice that this is brewed with beet sugar and green raisins, because neither of those flavors stands out--in fact, were they not printed on the label, you wouldn't know they were there. Instead, the esters from those ingredients become part and parcel of an incredible sugary dance that will leave your tongue reeling. Carbonation seems slightly high, but not overwhelming, and the hops provide a nice background fuzz.  Truly an excellent ale.

10099,1180,chinchill,3.44,"undated 12oz bottle served in a pint glass.  I just altered my BA profile last night to conclude that Belgian Strong Dark Ale deserves listing as my favorite style not so much because several of my favorites are this style but because every beer in this style I had reviewed had received a high A- or better) rating. Well, less than 24 hours later I'll need to revise my profile thanks to this Dogfish Head.  The DH gets off to a good start, with a lovely reddish amber color and a lasting, creamy looking light tan head. The liquid is clear and the head is multi-density.  The aroma is pleasant but rather mild and lacks depth and complexity being mainly the aroma of various ripe and dark fruits with some alcohol esters, grape bubblegum and a just hint of hops. The alcohol aromas become more pronounced with warming, leading me to lower my rating of this aspect.  This is an exceptionally fruity beer, with a flavor profile dominated by prunes, plums, raisins and generic sour fruits. The tartness nicely contrasts with the sweetness of the aroma. The ABV is not only apparent, it actually seems higher than 8%, as if someone sprinkles some light rum in my beer (no, I'm home alone at the moment).  M - medium body; smooth, but with a tad too little carbonation.  O - Well, I can still say I haven't had a Belgian Strong Dark Ale I disliked. This one departs from the admittedly highly variable flavor profile of this beer style. Where's the malt? It is still a moderately enjoyable if disappointing offering from DH.

Poured a beautiful brown with a thick, frothy head that left a skim of crema-like head on top. A quick swirl brings back the thick head. The ale has a nice clarity without any visible carbonation.  The aroma is sweet like a dark fruit, perhaps figs, dates or, as it claims, raisins. There's something else there that I don't identify as alcohol until I taste it. The taste is very sweet, but not cloyingly so. I think I would have been able to identify it as Belgian without having to read it's a Belgian dark strong ale. The only other guess I can think of would have been a very unusual brown ale. I'm not experienced enough to distinguish a Belgian dark strong ale from a dubbel. Perhaps the Belgian dark strong ale lacks a hop presence. This ale definitely lacks a hop presence. There is an alcohol presence, but again not too much. The alcohol offers a spice that tries to balance the sweetness. The sweet fruity taste hits me first and then the spiciness follows through to the finish. Raisin D'Etre is a sipper, for sure.  The mouth feel is more carbonated than it looks and is pretty heavy on the palate. The extra bit of unexpected carbonation helps this along and contributes to its overall enjoyment.  Overall, I liked this beer. It's different, but based on the reviews I read I thought I would hate it. It turns out to be a pleasant surprise. I like the choice of malts and the way the roasting highlights them. I can imagine some might find this a little too sweet, but for me the spicy alcohol balances it enough that I enjoy it.

Pours a deep red-hued brown, almost like a light red wine, with a large-bubbled scum on the top as an excuse for a head. The colour of the beer is gorgeous, and it has some heft to the body, but the head is disappointing.  Sigh. Nose is light, but slightly fruity, and with the sweet sense of fermented sugar. Smells too raw and spiritous for its 8% ABV, and like some of DFH's other hybrid beers, it lacks the complexity that is required.  Taste is very similar, or worse, because there's very little here at all. Very light empty feel with a hint of bland spirits and a grainy but weak finish. Little complexity and almost nothing on the palate. Very bland—c'mon, even the overdone spiritous burn would be better than this.  A very lacklustre and very uninspired effort from Dogfish Head.

10099,1180,StoutHunter,2.7,"I bought a bottle of Dogfish Head's Raison D'etre last weekend for $1.79 at The Lager Mill. So far I have been pretty impressed and interested with all the beers I have had from them, so I decided to give this one a try and see if it is as good as their other beers. No visible bottling date but I am pretty sure it's a 2011 vintage. Poured from a brown 12oz bottle into a snifter.  A- The label on this beer is like most Dogfish Head labels and is pretty plain, but at least it gives you an idea of what your getting into. It pours a clear dark amber color with two fingers worth of off white head that died down to a thin layer that stayed till the end.  S- Right off the bat this beer smells pretty sweet. The Belgian candied sugars really stand out in the aroma and are the first thing I notice along with a medium amount of booze. After I get past the sugar and alcohol there are some pleasant aromas of dark fruits, raisins, and a slight bit of spices.  T- The aroma is pretty damn close to what the flavor is like. Just like the aroma the first thing I pick is the Belgian candied sugar that is pretty damn sweet and very close to that cloying threshold. I pick up some sweet brown bread, dark fruits, brown sugar, and a slight bit of spices that I assume is from the yeast. The alcohol could have been hidden better, it sticks out a good deal and is a little warming, straight from the fridge I mainly got sugar and booze, but once it warmed up some of the better subtle flavors showed up.  M- Sticky and medium bodied with a medium light amount of carbonation that could have been kicked up a notch.  Overall I thought this was a pretty average beer that I really wasn't that into. In theory it sounded like a good choice since I like that raisin taste I get from malt heavy brews but this one was just far too sweet and unbalanced for me to like. I really don't like overly sweet beers so that was what I liked the least about this beer, but the flavors in the background that I picked up when it warmed up were nice and would have suited this beer better if they took the reigns and let the sugar and alcohol take the backseat. I don't think I will buy this again, if I am craving a Belgian Strong Dark Ale I will stick with my go to brew for that style, Trois Pistoles. I can't say I recommend this brew since it doesn't do a good job at representing it's style. This beer just didn't do it for me and is now my least favorite Dogfish Head Brew, sweet and boozy just don't work for me.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Belgian Dark Strong Ale,83

Retention is pretty long and it leaves a fair amount of lacing.  S: Light malts with a fair amount of sweetness and a dark fruit aroma. Slight cereal grain smell. Not too much going on, but not bad.  T: Sweet sugars underlaid by what what I can only describe as bitter malts. The bitterness follows the beer through to the end. Tastes like burnt marshmallow.  M: Heavy and sticky and sticky with a moderately high amount of carbonation.  O: About what I remembered. The beer is overly heavy, overly sweet and wickedly out of balance.

Definitely picking up raisins along with bread and sour white wine. Kind of a funky smell.  T - Whoa this beer is hot. Even for 8% abv. Very alcoholic taste up front. Raisins are hidden by a medicinal flavor but still faintly there. Towards the end it sweetens up a bit with a syrup and candy sugar notes along with some sourness. Alcohol stays with this beer all the way to then end. In a bad way.  M - Mouth feel is medium bodied and with high carbonation .  O - This has to be the worst Belgian Strong Dark Ale I have had to date. Smells funky. Flavors are off and carbonation is too high. I wonder if I bought a bad bottle.

T: Sticky sweet and fruity at first, the dark roasted malts and Belgian candi sugar lend way to some fruity, raisin and date flavors before the booziness takes hold. Spicy hops do little to balance the very sweet flavors before washing it all down with a sticky sweet malt finish laced with phenol alcohol flavor.  M: Full-bodied and pretty sticky throughout. Alcohol stings the palate a bit at certain points.  O: A good beer and I tried to like it a lot more than I did, being a big DFH fan.

Some chocolate and a small roasted feel coupled with molasses and brown sugar. varied and sweet. Dark fruit, similar to figs more so than raisins.  Starts with a dark chocolate note, slightly bitter and quickly runs through a constantly devolving mash of flavors, brown sugar, dates and raisins becoming increasingly medicinal and burnt. Odd medicinal bitterness on the aftertaste coupled with some woodiness and charred meat, weird. This slowly moves away from campfire flavor puts on a more yeasty and sweet aftertaste as the beer warms. Alcohol is also quite present.  Didn't really like the taste but the body was nice and light and the carbonation adequate. Some herbal drying but prickly alcohol surfaces through the drink.  Not all that terrible, redemption comes as the beer warms but still the taste was lingering and unpleasant.

I've had this many times before and I do recall having 5-6 of these when we were partying but this really is a 1-2 a night beer. Rather heavy. I appreciate the beer but much prefer the IPA's that DFH produces.  Cheers!",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Belgian Dark Strong Ale,83
10099,1180,CONOR8832,3.75,"Poured a nice copper color with a white, thick head. Your nose gets hit with the rasins, very sweet aromoa with a mild sourness to the beer. At first sip you get hit with the sweetness followed up with a smooth warming effect of the alcohol that finishes with a bitter earthy somewhat woodsy taste. This is a very easy to drink beer that leave a slight dry feeling in the mouth but still very easy to drink.

Lots of carbonation bubbles when held up to the light.  S: Sweet, malty aroma at first with some dark fruits that I wouldn't call raisins. Whiff of alcohol comes through also. Caramel also. A little weak, but pleasant.  T: Sweet and malty up front, with a spicy, somewhat sour finish. Very little hop presence. Alcohol is well hidden. Nice and light.  M: Medium feel with a high carbonation fizz that makes it feel much lighter. Cleans off the tongue for a crisp finish.  D: Nice and easy to drink.

M: medium body. moderate carbonation that finishes with some fizz on the tip of my tongue.

T-Has some of the typical belgian flavors of clove and other spices but the flavor is fairly light. M-This is where I notice the most difference from the typical belgian ales. It's light in body, not enough malt. Overall, a good beer from Dogfish but not great for the style.

Raison d'être is a French phrase meaning ""reason for existence.""  Perfectly clear honey-orange, with a frothy half-finger head the color of beach sand.  The aroma is pretty light. I get raisins and wheat,mostly.  Nice sugary sweetness in the flavor. Bubblegum, raisins, brown sugar, some lightly toasted bread, marmalade and hints of earthy hops.  Medium carbonation stabs the tongue as the smooth medium body rolls about, creating moderate fizz. I get some alcohol in the nose and throat.

Look - dark copper/deep red in color, with about two fingers worth of just slightly off-white (very close to white) foam that dissipates somewhat quickly.  Smell - definitely malty, interesting smell...can't quite place the aromas. Smells more alcoholic than the abv shows. Maybe a bit fruity..perhaps from the raisins.  Taste and Mouthfeel - Slightly higher abv is noticeable at the start. Slightly sweet at the beginning and middle. I can't taste the beet sugars...maybe the raisins. A bit of a dry finish, but pretty smooth in general. Texture is pretty well-balanced.  Overall - Complex in design, but not quite as much so in the actual taste...but only because I couldn't pull out some of the flavors that they list on the bottle, which may very well be MY fault and not the brewery's.

Taste - Malty sweetness with a very slight creamed coffee aftertaste. Medium hoppiness in the body.  Mouthfeel - Not as good as other more traditional beers in the same style. A little too light and boring. But refreshing, so that balances it out.  Overall - Really enjoyable beer. Especially for the price. Poor man's Chimay Blue.

Very pretty beer when poured, crisp little bubbles cling to the glass against a semi-dark, mahogany color. The nose is very slightly boozy. You pick up a mix between a belgian and brown ale but heavier smell of a belgian with a lil something else that reavels itself in the middle. Upon dinking, first you taste brown ale, then the raisins hit the pallet. The green raisins are the main event to the taste of this beer. Good carbonation and slightly sweet and slightly dry. It finishes off dry and with a belgian taste. You can barely pick up the 8%abv. This beer is very wine-like but still drinks like a beer. This six-pack was also a steal at 10 bucks and some change.

Lacing for this ale was very much above average as it left lots of rings. The aroma of the ale smelled of raisins, prunes, and alochol. The beer was big bodied but the mouthfeel was less then ideal. This beer was very syurpey and high in alochol. The taste was very malty and a mix of green grapes and prunes.

There is a green grape flavor that is just done wrong with this brew. Like Welches white grape juice and alcohol. Yuck.  Mouthfeel - Carbonation and alcohol are somewhat overdone. Not smooth.  Overall - DFH continues to underwhelm me. Not sure why their stuff does not seems to resonate with me like it does with others.

S - A muted, generally sweet nose with caramel, honey, slight dark fruit, and slight spices. Thought I pulled a very slight banana out of there as well.  T - Quite malty, more of the same flavors as shown in the aroma. Not too dry but has a great aftertaste that honestly I preferred to the drink. Taste is pretty even with smell but not quite as muted.  M - Medium body, carbonation is poor, not particularly smooth feel which I feel would've been appropriate.  D - Meh. It's okay. I have to complement DFH's ability to hide the ABV in this one; didn't look at the bottle until I finished and was really surprised to see the 8% on there.

Nose is sweet and a little spicy. Faint scent of grapes/raisins comes through.  Taste follows the nose well with some malty sweetness. Sweetness stays on the tongue for a while from front to back, and never really turns to much bitterness. Hops do not make an appearance. Lack of Belgian yeast flavor is a bit of a disappointment for this style. Tastes more akin to a brown or a scotch ale. But overall very tasty.  Medium bodied.

Flavor wise I pick up on caramelly and toffee-like notes followed by the raisins and other dark flavors like licorice. Definitely on the sweeter side.  Has a good amount of carbonation but still has a nice smooth finish. Also has a really interesting aftertaste which I really enjoy, wouldn't say its a dry finish, but has a certain crispness to it.

O: Seeing as I'm not a huge fan of raisins, I was pleased to see that this beer wasn't over-the-top raisiny.

A weird blend of sour fruits, just past fresh. I smelt some dirt in there.  You can taste a twisted grape from the green raisins but it doesn't balance well with the toasted malt flavors.

The balance of flavors is a bit wonky, going back and forth between malty brown ale and out of control sweetness. Strangely it works. I think it is what the brewer was going for and I like it. This is not a bitter beer, though there is a slight bitter grapefruit note in the after taste.  M: Very highly carbonated. It reminded me a lot of diet coke in that respect. Even with the carbonation it came off as smooth and easy to drink.  D: As it stands alone, one bottle, very drinkable. I don't think I could handle more than that in a sitting.

Smell: Deep caramel and toffee notes mixed with a fruity aroma. You can smell the raisins but the ""fruit"" isn't exactly defined -- it's not citrus but more like a dry fruit. Slight whiff of alcohol. Very sweet smelling.  Taste: Huge toffee and caramel blast with the raisins kicking in on the finish. Sweet and creamy with a nip of bitterness at the end.

S - The nose is a mellow fusion of dark fruit, soft notes of char, and some unsweet hazelnut-cocoa.  T - The brew tastes a bit more vinous than the nose hinted. Nonetheless, the aforementioned elements of the nose remain in reasonable quantities. Additionally, there is a significant yeasty twang that imparts qualities of medium stone fruits. Pretty solid flavor profile; not exceptional.  M - It feels good enough; it is soft and on the lighter side of medium bodied. No one will be confusing this for an authentic Belgian, but nbd.

There was no lacing evident throughout the glass. The aroma was comprised of sweet malt, dark fruit, and sugar. The flavor was of sweet malt, dark fruit, brown sugar, and slight alcohol. It had a medium feel on the palate with medium carbonation. Overall this was a pretty good brew. The flavor was very well balanced with no sign of alcohol anywhere to be found. Not sure if it was the ~1 year of age in my cellar or what, but I found this one to be very subtle on alcohol and all of the other flavors were very nice and robust.

The head was small and dissipated almost immediately, leaving a ring and a couple of spots on the surface. The glass was beer clean, so I don't know what happened there.  Smell - Lots of malt, and you definitely get raisins and spices, but there's a strange sort of musty smell on the tail end of a sniff. I don't think it's an indicator of a bad bottle, because the taste isn't anything really off, so I'm a little confused at it.  Taste - neither the malts nor any fruit really come through a whole lot in the first couple of sips. There's a lot of spice, and a little heat from the alcohol, but it takes a few pulls from the glass to start to get the more vinous, fruity flavours - dates and dried figs. It's not bad, but I feel like there's a missing piece here, and I unfortunately can't really identify it. There is also just a little burnt flavour in the finish that I'm not enjoying.  Mouthfeel - it's nice and prickly, and I like that in this style. It's also got a hearty feel to it, almost like a nice piece of brown bread. The dryness of it is appealing, too.  Drinkability - despite the nice mouthfeel, I don't know that I would have another. The musty smell hasn't really faded with a few moments of warming-up, and the taste doesn't really bowl me over. The alcohol is also a bit too up-front.  In general, there are better examples of the style. Though not a bad beer, if you're looking for a strong dark Belgian ale, there are more interesting choices, and if you're looking for a Dogfish Head beer, there are more interesting choices.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Belgian Dark Strong Ale,83

The aroma is of dark roasted malts, with just a hint of sweetness; neither fruit nor spice was really apparent. The flavor had some raisin and slight bitterness. There was also a bit of indistinct spice and a splash of alcohol. Medium-bodied, with medium carbonation. Alcohol isn't too high.  Personally, this was a big disappointment - I'd been wanting to try this beer for about 5 years, and finally got the chance. I'm sure that some of my disappointment is due to my hopeful expectations, but I've reviewed it fairly (if anything, more than fairly). It lacks the richness and other general traits of this style of beer, and frankly, it is rather boring.

Aroma is predominantly malty with hints of caramel, some sweetness/fruity esters and dark fruits coming through. Taste is definitely dominated by dark fruits. Creamy mouthfeel, medium to full-bodied ale. Hints of smoked flavor come through every now and then. The finish has a warming effect coming from the alcohol.

M-has a great soft and medium carbonation with a slightly dry finish  D-drinks quite easily for an 8% beer. the fact that i kept picking up new flavors as i tasted it, made this beer very enjoyable. this is the first time i reviewed this beer, but i've had it many times and i'm sure i'll have it many times again!",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Belgian Dark Strong Ale,83
10099,1180,jrenihan,3.5,"Bottled on 11/24/10  A very thin off-white head dissipates quickly. Body of the beer is dark brown, just barely opaque.  The raisins are present in both the smell and the taste, though not overpowering. I don't think that disliking raisins would necessarily turn one off this beer. Some plum flavour is present as well, to a lesser degree. The beer is fairly sweet. The aftertaste is minimal- the beer seems to disappear quickly, with a slight dryness. I would not say that the flavour is particularly complex.  Mouthfeel is fine. A little lighter than I would like, especially from something that is classified as a BSDA. Drinkability is fine as well. I don't have a lot to say in either category.  Overall, I think this is a relatively enjoyable beer, but not great. Not my favourite DFH by any measure, and if it is truly considered a BSDA, it is not a sterling example of one. I have to question its categorization, because it bears very little similarity to others of that style, in my opinion.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Belgian Dark Strong Ale,83

It had an upper medium body, and fairly high carbonation. The taste was very bold. The alcohol, and raisin taste is done to excess. It was very sweet, and had just a faint hint of bitter on the end.

Roasted malt aroma that's slightly smokey with hints of chocolate, oatmeal, burnt toast and roasted coffee bean as well as slight dark fruit presence. Hints of raisin, plum and fig as well as subtle spice.  Medium bodied and similar in flavor to the aroma with a decent balance of roasted malt, sweet dark fruit and zesty spice. The spice and fruit notes are prominent up front with hints of pepper and vinous dark cherry, grape, plum and raisin. This is countered mid palate by a slightly smokey, roasted malt profile. Hints of chocolate, toffee, oatmeal, roasted coffee bean and burnt toast. Slight alcohol sweetness but no heat or warmth in the finish.  This beer is really unique but the sweet dark fruit notes are a bit too prominent, overpowering the dark malt flavor that I prefer in this style.

10099,1180,zoso493,3.58,"Poured from a 12 oz. bottle made on 12/28/10 into a Dogfish signature glass.  Appearance: Raison D'Être pours a very light mahogany color that is a touch less brown than the stereotypical BSDAs. When held to the light, it takes on a bright garnet hue. Only a thin one-finger head emerges at the top of the glass, and it recedes quickly to form a film above the beer.  Smell: The smell on this brew has a very alcoholic quality to it, as well as a decent scent of sourness. Other than that, I can get a very faint scent of raisins and hints of a less-than-great Belgian yeast strain. There isn't much complexity to the nose either, as the alcohol sort of blurs any distinction between the scents.  Taste: The taste mostly resembles the scent as the raisin, dark fruit and tinge of Belgian yeast are the most prominent tastes. The alcohol comes on fairly strong in the finish, though it's not overpowering. I could almost swear that there are some bittering hops in there around the end, too. Once, again the taste lacks the complexity and depth of flavor to be a really good BSDA.  Mouthfeel: Raison D'Être is a decidedly medium-bodied beer and might be just a bit thinner than a good BSDA should be. It is, however, a refreshingly crisp and well-carbonated beer.  Drinkability: This is a fairly nice drinking beer, as it's not over the top in alcohol content or flavor profile, but I probably would only have one of these, given the prevalence of the alcohol in the taste.  Overall, Raison D'Être is a decent attempt at reproducing a BSDA, but it lacks a lot of components that the best of them have. It's too alcoholic and it lacks the complex flavor that is characteristic of BSDAs. It does become a bit more laid back as it warms, though it's still not up to snuff. I'm glad I tried it, but there are other BSDAs I'd reach for before I had this again.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Belgian Dark Strong Ale,83

The taste follows the nose, this is a brew with some Belgian influences on the sugar and yeast with some nice full malty flavors with fruit to round it off. Not amazing, but still quite good.

10099,1180,nhindian,3.74,"12oz bottle poured into a Dogfish Head Signature glass.  This was one of my staple beers this past summer while interning in Manhattan and really started to spur my interest towards craft. Revisiting it for the first time since then... I wonder how my perceptions have changed...  A - Pours a rust colored, dark orange with about 2-fingers of off-white head, softly capping the beer but with pretty low retention. As it finally disappears, it leaves very little remnants; only the thinnest of caps floating in the middle of the beer. Can see sediment and bubbles throughout the glass. Lacing is minimal at best.  S - Smells of hybrid between a dubbel and tripel; there's obviously lots of grapes and raisin in here mixed with Belgian yeast, but I'm also getting some of the bananas, cloves, and bubblegum notes as well. Sugary with some hints of alcohol and bread.  T - Whereas the nose held a cornucopia of aromas, the taste rather restricts itself to grape, sugar, malts, and alcohol. As the name suggests, this beer doesn't play around with the grapes (even though the name is a pun). There's little appearance from much else, which is a shame due to the enticing nose. The alcohol actually comes through much stronger than I would've expected, even though it comes in at 8%.  M - Mouthfeel is medium to heavy bodied with moderate carbonation. Certainly coats the entire mouth and the finish is sweet and a bit hot from the alcohol.  D - Drinkability is moderate. This beer has a lot going for it in the nose, but the taste is just a bit out of balance for me. A little bit of reduction in the alcohol heat and a tad more balance with the other notes from the nose and this beer is a winner, especially for the price point.

Some fruity Belgian yeast aromas mingle with cakey malt and rum raisin. So far there is a little estery alcohol, but not much. Warmer, moderate solvent alcohol comes out, as does caramelized brown sugar.  Bitter phenolic and estery alcohol; a little clove, allspice, raisin. Toasted, toffee malts fill out the middle. The yeast is a little chalky and the finish has distinctly spicy alcohol. The beet sugar seems to give some of the same steel notes Belgian candi sugar can present.  Thin mouthfeel, rather dry, and not as carbonated as it looks. Creamy and dry, there is a bit of a sherry thing going on.

The up front is on the bitter/sour side with citrus puckering notes. There is also a rich sweetness in there as the beer warms and coats the palate. The sweetness seems to come in the form of sugar flavors, as well as some white grape juice. There is some spice there, too...cinnamon for sure.

10099,1180,Twombly,3.88,"A - Pretty! Pours a deep amber, almost reddish, into a tulip glass (the description on the bottle is ""mahogany""). Two-finger head that dissipates fairly quickly, with a good bit of lacing along the side of the glass.  S - Frankly, my sense of smell is the weakest among my five. My wife often has to tell me when ""We need to light a candle."" With this beer, my compromised olfactory powers sense some maltiness, but I mainly smell something like raisins or prunes, but sweeter, almost as if I'm smelling a fruitcake in drink form (the homemade kind, not the Klaxton stuff).  T - I can definitely taste the raisins, but really only right at the start. Taking a larger sip, I'm still getting sweetness, but it's more of a malty rather than a fruity sweetness. If I close my eyes, this tastes almost like a nice, sweet brown ale, one of my favorite styles. (By the way, I'm not sure that ""burp-taste"" is a legit beer-rating category, but if it were, I'd say ""Oh, yeah. That's where the raisins went."")  M - The aroma and flavors made me assume that this beer would be really ""sticky"" and syrupy, but actually the mouthfeel is fairly light, with more carbonation than I'd expected. If the brown ale comparison stands, I'd say this could be Sierra Nevada Autumn Tumbler's slightly fruity cousin.  D - I'm about two thirds of the way through a 12-oz bottle, and though I'm planning to finish it, I'd say one during an evening is plenty.

10099,1180,damndirtyape,2.62,"Single bottle (bottled on 12/28/10) poured into a snifter.  Appearance: A clear ruby-red to brown beer (you could indeed call it mahogany as the bottle says) that poured a 1/4"" light tan dense head. However the head died down to a thin ring around the edge of the glass and a very thin little island in the middle of the beer. Very little lacing - every now and then but it slowly slides back down. Slow bubbles moving up through the beer. I'm digging the color, but the lack of head and lacing is a bit of a bummer.  Smell: Richness of malt with some caramel notes and then something that smells sulfur-like / cooked veggie to me - but then it passes and there is a hint again of something sweet and fruit-like. It may be the raisins, but it's not quite it. That initial smell is good, but what follows unfortunately puts me off. The smell is really bad if you swirl the beer - maybe the hops?  Taste: Similar to the smell - starts off with a rich malt, caramel, and fruity/alcohol taste, but then that next flavor hits. While it is sulfur-like in smell, it tastes more spicy / peppery here. The finish is sharp and mildly sweet - it just ends - due to the carbonation which scrubs the tongue clean at the end of the sip. Not bad, but it's not great either.  Mouthfeel: Quite highly carbonated on the tongue - really scrubs it with spiciness, which is surprising giving the little bit I see moving up through the glass. Some lingering sensation on the teeth and in the end I think a bit too fizzy.  Drinkability: Maybe with the right meal I could make this work, but I've had far better Belgian Dark Ales, and this by itself in a snifter isn't great. Maybe it's meant to be in a different glass and the smell and taste is different. But I'm not liking it and it is a bit of a chore to finish.

I'm also picking up alot of dark fruits and raisins. Tastes very good. I like the idea of using beet sugars, giving the beer flavor and a very nice sweetness. Subtle hops, no bitterness. Very enjoyable flavors! Nice caronation, very smooth; medium-bodied. Great drinkability, alcohol is well masked, I'd never guess this beer was 8% abv. This beer never reminded me of a belgian beer AT ALL! But I don't say that in a negative way..  I've always loved this beer! It's hard classify the style, but the bottom line is its' well crafted.

10099,1180,SuperSpy,2.66,"Poured from a 12oz bottle to a pint glass.  A - The beer is a very clear, and just as the label states, mahogany. The head is tan and thick but it dissipates to a 1/4 inch foam cap after a minute or two. It looks very tempting.  S - Sweet maltiness, almost buttery. A bit of caramel, high alcohol.  T/M - Medium bodied but could use more carbonation. The flavors are of esters and alcohol that don't exactly dominate but they distract from the toffee and other malt characteristics that are there if you search hard enough for them. The hops sort of come out of nowhere at the end and the aftertaste doesn't really leave me wanting more. It's not a bad flavor, it's just not a very good one.  D - I have no trouble drinking the one here in front of me but I really expected more from Dogfish. I would like to try this on a nitro-tap to see if it is any different but this will not be my first choice for a Belgian strong dark.

10099,1180,r0nyn,3.68,"Poured from a bottle into my La Fin du Monde tulip glass. Bottled on 12/16/10.  Pours a dark reddish amber hue that's quite transparent. Frothy half-inch head that recedes slowly, leaving some loose, spotty lacing. Can almost see little bits of yeast sediment suspended in the brew if you look hard enough. Smell is full of sweet caramel malts and has a definite fruity quality to it. Beet sugars, maybe? Little bit of roastiness towards the end as well.  Some spicy notes to kick things off in the taste, followed by the sweetish malts and a mild fruitiness, which I'm assuming is coming from the beets and the raisins. Little bit of a phenol twinge towards the middle as it settles across the palate, ending off with a slight alcohol burn that warms the throat. Interesting, but somewhat lacking in complexity. Mouthfeel is good, having a medium body with just the right amount of carbonation prickling. Finishes easily with a mild bittering aftertaste.  Drinkability is fairly good. A solid, if unspectacular example of a Belgian Strong Dark Ale. I can always count on Dogfish Head to put out an interesting, off-beat brew and this is definitely one of them. It doesn't have the complexity and oomph of proper Belgian monastery beers like Rochefort and Chimay, but it's still a worthwhile thing to sit back and drink.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Belgian Dark Strong Ale,83

In my opinion it resembled the way an ale would look if you told someone to picture an ale in their head.  Smell: Couldn't pick up too much of an odor (anyone who hasn't read my profile, that's more on me than the beer).  Taste: Tasted like your standard ale, but left a sweet raisin after taste.  Mouthfeel: I could tell I was drinking a beer that had a decent ABV, but it went down smooth. The alcohol wasn't over powering and went down as if though I was drinking an ale with less alcohol.  Drinkability: I could drink more of this. It's high in alcohol, but not harsh or terrible tasting.  Bonus: I ate a Hungry Man fried chicken dinner (fried chicken, mashed potatoes, corn and a brownie) and let me say that this beer washed everything down perfectly.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Belgian Dark Strong Ale,83

It poured very much like it says on the bottle, with a deep mahogany brown. It had a nice, small white head, that faded pretty fast.  The aroma on this brew can only be explained as complex. The first aroma that his the nose is some very strong dark malts. That is followed by a some what yeasty, banana aroma. Its soon followed with a bunch of other aromas such as cherries, sweet raisins, it also has a nice nose of what smells like brandy.  The flavors on this brew are very good as well. The first flavors you pick up on are the raisins and toffee. These flavors lead into the dark malts and then into some of the other sweet fruity flavors that make up the brew. There is a nice sugary sweet flavor that comes from the beet sugars that balance all the flavors of this brew.  The mouthful on this brew is well balanced and smooth. It has light to medium body, with a wonderfully dry finish. The alcohol burn afterwords is great, a nice warming feeling.  The drink on this is pretty decent. For some drinkers it might become heavy, as well well as the alcohol burn might turn a few away. I am a huge fan of DFH beers, and once again, they have not let me down.

The taste is of sweet malt and beet sugar. Personally I do not like it, think it's kinda gross, but I get what they were going for. It's just an over malted ale to me. I'm not getting any raisin at all. Like a lot of DFH's beers, this drinks exceptionally smooth. I just can't like this. It's flavors are odd and the 8% is pretty noticeable.

Most of the taste is made up of toffee and malts mixed with raisins. The bottle mentions beets - I didn't pick up on that. The beer tasted much better once it got close to room temperature. It finishes with a malty and sweet aftertaste.  Drink - A nice beer that works well as a winter warmer. The alcohol is well hidden and it has a lot of taste.

A touch of metalic and booze aroma but not annoying in anyway.  Raisins, toffee, caramel, grapes, molasses at first taste. Towards the end some dark hops with a sweet and slight bitter finale. Booze is only slightly noticeable when swallowed.  Thin to medium body. Feels pretty nice in the mouth. Alcohol warms as it goes down. Leaves the lips slightly sticky.  Drink ability is above decent.

Dark sweet fruits, toffee and raisins coat your palate at first and continue during the drink. They are well balanced and not too overpowering as the nose might have suggested. The aftertaste is what surprised me. A slight hint of citrus hops came through to add a little bitterness that totally changed my opinion of this beer.

10099,1180,TheBrewo,3.81,"We pour a brew of deep red brown. It holds a tan head of two fingers, which leaves little lacing as is slowly dies down. The beer is otherwise clear, with active carbonation swirling throughout. The aroma is a combination of burnt caramel notes, dark prunes, mild esters, honey, and hints of dark dry chocolate. As we sip, the front is sweet, malty, and has inclusions of dark fruits. Through the middle of the swallow we get an even heavier graininess mixed, and counterbalanced, by bitter chocolate. The taste ends with a sweeter, fruity aftertaste that is overly dominated by a coppery flavoring, likely lent by the beet sugars. There is also the slightest burn of alcohol. The mouth is left feeling surprisingly satiated by the brew's light mouth coating characteristics. The body is medium, and the carbonation is medium to high. The drinkability is fair but not outstanding, due to the use of several unique ingredients which slow you down a bit and make you think.  Overall, the best things about this beer are its rich, deep coloring, and the conservative use of some of the more outlandishly sweet ingredients.

10099,1180,ramseye4,3.48,"Ingredients listed on the bottle is a bit bizarre, but I'll keep an open mind and hopefully this won't disappointed. Pours a nice amber color, with a 2 finger head that dissipates but leaves wonderful lacing down the glass. Tastes fruity, with lots of caramel malt and a bit of spice, with some alcohol as well. Taste is...definitely unique. Tastes of raisin and other dried fruit, a nice caramel malt undertone, no hop taste really to be found, decent bitterness, with a very sweet aftertaste. Very fruity all round, but not in the typical way. At first I wasn't too keen on it, but wow, it definitely grows as the quantity in my glass diminishes. Mouthfeel is medium bodied, sweet and sticky. As fruity as this is, coupled with the fairly high ABV, I would only limit myself to one or two of these in an evening.  This is unique, and it definitely took about half the glass for it to grow on me. Definitely worth trying, but I'll probably pass this up in favor for more traditional ales.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Belgian Dark Strong Ale,83

First sip is of sweet malt, caramel, and a faint impression of a dry white wine. No flavors associated with hops. No bite from the alcohol, though a bit on the low end for a BSD ale.  Medium body on the mouthfeel, very smooth. Mouth-coating, and a slight prickle from the carbonation.  Very drinkable beer, but hard to pick out the nuances that make it different.

Notes of brown sugar, sweet caramel malt, and dark dried fruits (raisins and dates), with a slight bit of alcohol ""heat"". T - Very close to the nose, sweet malt, brown sugar and dried fruits dominate again. I'm amazed by the amount of raisin flavor they were able to impart into this, it's almost like liquid Raisinets. Thankfully not as boozy as the nose would suggest. M - Medium-bodied with low carbonation. Very slick mouthfeel, and slightly oily.

Smells of caramel, molasses, fruity malts, slight brandy.  Tastes very sweet at first. Lots of malt give the beer a big sweet, caramel note. Then it transitions into a dark fruit flavor similar to raisins. After that there is a touch of a tea like hop flavor. No alcohol in the flavor but you feel it in your chest.

Disappointing head formation and retention for a Belgian-style beer.  Smell: Smells of sweet malts, Belgian yeast, and a touch of grapes giving it a slight wine-y smell.  Taste: Immediately sweet and malty with only a hint of hoppy bitterness. Develops a sweet, yeasty, vinous flavor towards the back. Finishes dry and tart. Pretty average stuff here.  Mouthfeel: Reasonably full-bodied with an expressive carbonation.  Drinkability: I had heard a lot about how this beer was supposed to be ""different"" and ""provocative"" because they used unorthodox ingredients in it. Unfortunately, I don't think it really lives up to that reputation. What you get is a relatively straight forward Belgian ale. It is a bit on the sweet side and the hops don't come out as much as they usually do but it's still a pretty typical Belgian ale.

10099,1180,Bouleboubier,4.32,"Rightly so, this is one of Dogfish Head's big sellers. It somehow seems to draw from several styles with its complex flavor and aroma - a little dubbel, dunkel, doppel, scotch, and barleywine all at once.  A nice big head, though somewhat ordinary-looking, rises up with the pour, but it fizzles out fast and leaves little to remember it by. But what a magnificently rich, deep, beet-red color this ale has! Reminds me of that of a Scotch ale or surely a barleywine (or just wine).  Moving past that, the bold aroma boasts quite a bouquet - deep, full, lightly toasty malts, faint demarara and spice (hops? yeast?), with an intoxicating vinous (port), boozy stream and an amazing raisin profile (yeah, it REALLY smells like raisin).  And it sure has a raisin vein pulsating through its lip-smacky maltiness. Elegantly hoppy on the fringes, Belgian fruity notes coated in brown sugar, with a butter cookie/biscuit aftertaste lingering and a smooth, warming boozy afterglow.  All in all, it drinks with ample carbonation but nil bite, and soft silky feel.

From there, the taste fades into a bit of yeastiness...a very nice brown sugar taste from the Belgian beet sugar. Just a small bitterness at the end as well.  I really, really like this beer.

As much as I loved the trip, this was a bit underwhelming. Overly sweet nose is what you notice. Figgy maybe. Sweet. That smell sits on top of the amber beer, which is good because there's not much head. It's a dark ale that runs smooth through the mouth, but you do notice the alcohol.

A- Poured into a Perfect Pint, maybe Ill try a tulip next time. Its a super clear deep, burnt orange that dabbles in hues of ruby and red. A small off white head leaves me no lacing.  S- Archetypal Belgian fruitiness and spice intermingled with an American hopping. Golden raisins are strong as is some cinnamon-like spice. Those beet sugars give the aroma quite an unusual character. Its almost like yams crossed with figs and celery. There is a lot here for the mind to wrap around.  T- Lots of wood builds the body of this flavor. Raisins, lots and lots of spices and bittering hops at the finish.

D - The aroma is a bit weak, but the favor of this beer is surprisingly spot of for the style. The raisins bring a musty fruitiness that works well with the rich, dark caramel malt.

10099,1180,ToAzwethinkweizm,4.11,"Bottled on 24 May 2010. Poured into a Sierra Nevada XXX snifter, 1-inch foamy head that dissipated quickly, while the lacing covers 75% of the glass while drinking. At first pouring, the color appeared a transparent dark copper-gold, but when the glass was full and held up to the light, the red-mahogany color mentioned on the bottle really comes out well -- definitely a perfect rating for appearances. The majority of the aroma is a sweet, sweet malt, but not so much of the green raisins show up as much spiced rum without the kick of alcohol burning the nose. In fact, the alcohol is only very slight on the nose. Other aromas are hints of wet leather, unripe fig fruits, and that unmistakable smell of a raked-up leaf pile during autumn, but the majority of the flavor is a sweet sweet malt, a little like tasting the wort of your homebrew. The wet leather comes out on the tongue shortly after swallowing the beer, but it's not gross...it's intriguingly good. That sweet maltiness carries right on over to the tastes buds, as well as Belgian flavors that remind me a lot of Chimay Grand Reserve. I can't detect much alcohol on the tongue. This is a better-than-average, medium-bodied beer with lighter carbonation than normal that allows you to appreciate the sweet flavors of the malts.  For a Dogfish Head beer, it is not the best, but I give higher marks as this is a great beer for it's lower-than-average cost. You're definitely getting a deal on this one. Great fireside beer.

Very inviting and as usual I have it poured into a tulip for close examination.  Smell: Smells great. Funky, aromatic, and deep with fruitiness. Being around thanksgiving I am reminded of a standard cornucopia, however all of the fruits usually present within are mixing together to add deep complexity and variety to such a played-out brown ale.  Taste: I paired this beer with a ""roasted root"" (beets, parsnips, potatoes) and steak dinner. Outstanding as paired, just as promised. I found all of the caramel notes of the beer harmonizing with the mineral earthiness from the roots and steak. Rich and grainy, it is almost a meal aside from the meal I'm having it with. Also, the 8%ABV is no joke in this beer and comes through more than so with others.  Mouthfeel: I have almost no complaints except for a strange aftertaste that I only seem to notice once the meal has finished. I'm not sure exactly what it is, but I'm reminded of a slightly burnt caramel that you have to grow into. Otherwise, pure enjoyment.  Drinkability: Because I've had this beer both paired with a meal and on its own I can tell you that it is outstanding with a meal, but also pretty darn good on its own. I am reminded more of its strength drinking it on its own, but wouldn't hesitate to grab another 6-pack in the future.  cheers",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Belgian Dark Strong Ale,83

Tart dark fruit and esters dominate the flavour up front, sugary and slightly vinous notes in the middle, mild roasted coffee-like notes rise up after the finish already and linger in the aftertaste.

10099,1180,Vdubb86,3.48,"Served in a pint glass  Pours a nice clear mahogany red, with a finger of the lightest of tans foam that quickly fades into nothing but a slight film. The aroma initially has the tartness of the golden raisins, but is quickly overpowered and masked by the caramel malts. In addition there is the pleasant aroma of honey which is muddled by the smell of liquor on the back of the nostrils. The taste is of caramel malts and the booze. There is a significant bitterness that goes with both. There is the distinct flavor of golden honey which is this beers saving grace. The aftertaste is the only place that you'll find the raisin flavor. The bitter astringent nature is more akin to an Old Ale than the BSDA. It's drinkable in the sense that you can consume it no problem if you sip it. Dear lord don't drink it too fast. Too much on the mouth makes this beer taste worse. Having said all of that it's still a good beer, but it's a one time thing for me.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Belgian Dark Strong Ale,83

Lighter than expected mouthfeel but I could definately drink more than one.,Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Belgian Dark Strong Ale,83
10099,1180,clarkm04,3.21,Appearance- Has an amber/purplish color to it. Small head retention but decently carbonated.  Smell- Very unique smell profile. Somewhat malty but utilizing the raisins creates a different smell layout.  Taste- Very unique. Some aspects of the beer I really like while others not so much. The front taste is smooth and I enjoy the back taste too but the flavor profile is slightly bland and there's a note in the mid to back taste that I'm not a huge fan of it. Like everything with Dogfish Head you have to appreciate how they push the envelope on fermentables and none of their line would ever be created by another brewer on the planet.  Mouthfeel- A little bitter/tart on the palate. Fairly heavy for a beer of this ABV.  Drinkability- The beer sits in your belly so the drinkability is a little low.  Overall- A unique beer. I'm glad I've tried it but I don't plan on purchasing it again. DFH creates so many other beers that I just love but this one I feel is fairly average.As I stated above DFH is an outstanding brewery with a stellar lineup but I feel this is one of their weaker beers.,Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Belgian Dark Strong Ale,83
10099,1180,vandemonian,3.83,"I had the Raison D'etre at the Dogfish Head in Gaithersburg. It has a nice dark orange colour and once it was bought to our table it had very little head. It mainteained a light lacing around the edge of the glass though. The smell is mostly of yeast with a hint of sweet caramel. The main taste here is a sweet, dark caramel flavour which I assume is from the beet sugar and the raisons. There is also a nice roasty malt flavour in there too. This beer feels great in the mouth sue to the nice thick texture and the good carbonation. I really interesting and tasty beer.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Belgian Dark Strong Ale,83
10099,1180,thebrood1987,4.25,Bottled on 9/10/10  I don't know what people are talking about when they say they can smell the alcohol or even taste the alcohol in this one. Its so well masked for 8 percent and it doesn't even have that many hops to cover up that alcohol! Which is very impressive. It smells like a dark fruit and can definitely pick up the raison smell. Behind those smells is a very deep rich roasted malt. The taste has that deep rich sweet malt backing and the raisons and hops come together to have that earthy very slight bitter finish. Very well crafted. I hardly taste any alcohol in this as well. That doesn't mean though that you can't feel it. At 8 percent its a high alcohol beer so you can only have a few which is its only downfall. At least you'll be keeping the 6 pack longer than you usually would though! Also its good they put this in 6 packs instead of 4 packs. Very good decision.

Pours rubyish-brown, some clarity. Small head leaves some lace.  Malty, sugary aroma. Raisins are here with some malty sweetness. Not brown sugar necessarily, but there is a caramelized character to it. Rich in a way. Some fruity yeast character, somewhat general and I cant quite place it. Taste it much of the same, with a bit more of this fruity raisin flavor than in the aroma, but mostly malty with a slight toasty/hearty nuttiness detected. Full mouthfeel with low carbonation, a bit heavy feeling at times, though I keep trying to remind myself that this is 8%. Not much desire to keep drinking it as my glass sits around the halfway point. Not a bad beer, but there are many others in their portfolio that I would rather have.

Moderately carbonated appearance. Subtle lacing across the top of the beer, but a crawling web on the glass. Could be a little darker for ""style"" but DFH hasn't ever really been one to brew to ""style"", have they?  S- Dried brown fruits: Dates first, bits of prune, and of course raisins. Kind of nutty as well with a mild alcoholic warmth. Kind of a sweet aroma. There's something kind of dry/bitter on the nose....definitely not hops, maybe the beet sugars? Not sure. Either way, it's got a bit of a bitter ""finish"" in the smell.  T- Coffee, nuts, and dark dried fruits like those dates and prunes. No raisins in the taste.

I poured quite strongly and only got a minimal head, so it's safe to say this is a no-header.  S : Rich notes of brown sugar, malty caramel, a little alcohol, and some spice. Quite nice really.  T : A big barraging mix of brown sugar & dark fruit up front. The alcohol comes in midway through with a soft touch, and the yeasty spice comes in on the end very faintly. This one is sweet, with little to no hop to it, but not syrupy.  M : Wine like. Medium body, with a light carbonation and smooth texture. Very little aftertaste.  D : Quite easily sippable and gulpable. See below for thoughts on the pairing.  The brewers site sais this beer was designed as the pair for a nice steak. I tried two bottles (one with a steak, and one without) and can agree to the fact that is a very nice pairing brew. The steak-parterned beer was much more enjoyable and seem to have a stronger kick of flavors.

Brown Candi Sugar? no hops, and there is more I can't identify.  T - Now the Brown sugar flavor really jumps out. An almost wine-like quality too. Dark Fruits? Wow this is complex ! Very interesting !  M - Smooth, in it's own way. Good carbonation  D - So different! Not sure if I like it, But I want another, its so interesting its hard to resist.

S - Upfront is a pungent sweet malty caramel smell which coats over a dark fruit and citrus fruit scent. I'm picking up on raisins and plum.  T - Same as the smell, i'm getting a lot of unique sweetness out of it. There is a really faint hop bitterness towards the beginning of taste to balance this one out. After drinking, it leaves a very nice cracker bready taste in the mouth.  M - Medium bodied and inbetween creamy and slick. The sweetness shoots down just as fast as it hits your tongue.  D - For an 8% abv beer, this is unbelievably easy to drink. The taste of alcohol is non-existent in this, making it a very dangerous drink. I had bought a six back before this and almost lost it after drinking 5 bottles by mistake.

Bottle Glassware: Portsmouth Tulip  Poured a dark brown mahoghany w/ a 1/4 finger cream head that dissipates to an outer edge skim coat rather quickly. Little to no lacing present on the glass. The nose was of candied sugar, toffee, caramel, subtle dark fruits, and peat. The taste was of raisins, caramel, toffee, and a light charred aftertaste. The mouthfeel is medium bodied, and the carbonation has decreased substantially w/ the 2 years of age(this is a good thing). This brew was smooth and even at 8% alcohol, had no problems polishing off the bottle. The age has made the carbonation lower and smoothed the brew out, increasing the drinkability.

10099,1180,VTaler,3.98,A - Brown/red color that is see through. Nice off white thick head that stays around for a while. Overall a very nice appearance. S - Sweet Caramely smell. Kind of a apple and raisin aroma too. Smells like a cross between red wine and a old jug of apple-grape juice T - Very interesting taste. It tastes almost like someone poured some wine in my beer. It has a kind of apple/grape flavor that reminds of those hybrid fruit juices I drank as a kid. Take that and add carbonation and a hint of alcohol with a yeasty taste too. I am enjoying this with steak right now because I know it goes very well together. It's not very bitter at all and overall kind of mellow. I feel like this would be a very good beer to have with a very flavorful steak because the flavors and aromas in the beer are not overwhelming but have a nice comparison to the steak. Wine can sometimes be a little too overbearing in my opinion when paired with steak because it can sometimes take over the flavors of the steak but this beer is mellow enough to perfectly compliment the steak. As you drink it a spicy clove character starts to come in. The yeast flavor starts to really creep in at the end. M - Surprisingly a very smooth and thick mouth feel. Never would have thought this would be 8%abv. D - It I probs would only have one of these.,Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Belgian Dark Strong Ale,83

T: Direct and poignant. On the finish the grape comes forth with the lasting note of the hops.

A well constructed pour yeilds a small head that recedes to a ring and leaces spotted lacing.  Smell: Over ripe fruit, malt, alcohol.  Taste: Raisen obviously, but also getting alot of malts. Caramel and roasted malts giving off chocolatey/sugary goodness. Liquid Raisenets. Belgian yeast tries to fight through it all. No real hop presence just enough to keep it from cloying sweetness. As it warms some alcohol makes itself known, but its not detracting from the other flavors.  Mouthfeel: Full bodied yet very carbonated.  Drinkability: Very tasty, somewhat strong.

T: Just like the smell but with a bitter bite that I didn't enjoy until I lit a cigar to have with this brew. Tastes ""darker"" than it looks.  D: I finished off a sixer over about 5 hours.

The amber body and cream coloured head looked fine at first, but the head just faded away so quickly I didn't get chance to admire it for long enough.  One of the more interesting American brews I've had the pleasure of reviewing. Belgian beer sugars and sense of purpose, I know of (see the front label), but not sure I've had any green raisins in my beer before?  Anyway the aroma was nothing special, sweet malt molasses and no much else for my nose to find, even as the beer warmed in the glass.  The taste was sweet malts too, with a drying bitterness which gave it a nice edge at the end, almost peppery in intensity.  Very easy to drink and moreish (meaning: wanting more), I liked it a great deal. Not sure it would hold up against some of the real Belgian Strong Dark Ales it has been classed with, but a very good beer none-the-less.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Belgian Dark Strong Ale,83
10099,1180,artcurtis,3.26,"Really not a huge fan of this one. Pours a kind of nice looking mahogany color, as advertised. Pretty tiny head disappears rather quickly. The nose on this is definitely not impressive. Very medicinal alcohol. I'm getting some fruity sweetness as well, I guess from the raisins, but mostly alcohol, the rubbing kind. T-As the nose would indicate, pretty heavy alcohol notes. But unlike dogfish's Palo Santo, these are not alcoholic beverage notes, but rather cleaning and/or medicinal alcohol notes. The belgian sugars definitely come through, and a bit of fruity sweetness along with some nice malts, but its not enough to save it. It almost tastes like a quad with too much booze. M-Mouthfeel is fine, nothing great, nothing terrible. Just ok. Drinkability is almost non existent. It takes time and commitment to get through one of these, and a six pack has taken me a couple of weeks. I'm putting one in the cellar to see what happens over a bit of time.

10099,1180,jculler82,3.53,"One of my first craft experiences way back when. This review is actually a semi-vertical, a 2003-ish bottle and a late 2009 bottle, side-by-side. Both bottles poured to Duvel tuplips. Review is based on the 2009 bottle.  Pours, as the bottle says, a mahogany color that, when held to light, is a nice red. 2003 bottle has more sediment, 2009 has none really. No head from a semi-gentle pour. A touch above average looking really. Other than the sediment, they look identical.  Smell is mainly brown sugar for both beers. Maybe some background dark fruits. In the 2009 bottle there is a background coffee note, think coffee grounds more than cup of coffee. I'm amazed that the 2003 bottle didn't develop some complexity. For the style, for either beer, the beer is one dimensional. Just kinda average. When I think stong dark Belgian, or whatever this beer really is, I think complexity.  Taste is almost identical again for both vintages. Brown sugar overwhelms, a hint of some dark fruits. The difference is mainly in the finish. The 2009 finishes with a smokey flavor, mostly bacon-y. That smokiness is not apparent in the 03' vintage. The beer isn't bad, but it isn't amazing, it just isn't complex. Sort of a one trick pony. Nice medium full mouthfeel.  Drinkability? One bottle is enough, kinda disappointed I poured both at the same time.  Overall, I wanted to love this beer. Probably because of the nostalgia of being one of my first craft beers. But while it isn't bad, and if I was at a bar and this was my only craft option I'd be OK with it, it isn't a mind blower.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Belgian Dark Strong Ale,83

S: Very complex. Raisins, candy sugars, caramel & chocolate, grapes are all aromas that I get. This is a great smelling beer.  T: A raisny, chocolate-caramel taste mostly dominates. This is one to really sip & savor.  M: Starts sweet and finishes semi-dry. Nice little kick of bitterness at the end of each sip. Maybe a tad too syrup-like, but something I still enjoy.  D: The alcohol definitely shines through on this one. Sure- I've had plenty of higher alcohol beers before, but for some reason this one really seems to pack a wallop. Perhaps maybe it's because I consider this one a great tasting brew, where I'd like to have a lot of them but know in doing so would likely make for an ugly late-night into early morning.  Overall, this is easily one of my favorite Dogfish brews aside from 90-minute IPA. Not quite sure why others aren't as impressed.

This beer has a coffee flavor followed up with chocolate, mocha, and alcohol.  M. This beer feels thick which is probably a sign of high alcohol content. It is very fizzy on the tongue and dances? its way back toward the throat.  D. I might have to get back on this one but right now i think that I will not be having another one of these right away.

10099,1180,jporf911,3.54,"I've heard good things about Dogfish Head, so I decided to give this one a shot. Poured from a brown 12oz bottle with no freshness date. The label says ""A deep mahogany ale brewed with Belgian beer sugars, green raisins, & a sense of purpose"".  Appearance- 2.5 out of 5. Pours with hardly any head. I kept waiting for it to bubble up, but it never did. That was rather disappointing, as is the lacing on the sides. It looks a lot like a dark soda when held up to the light.  Smell- 3.5 out of 5. This beer smells better than it looks. I catch hints of rum, caramel malt, and raisins; oddly enough, my nose also detects that artificial kind of purple grape scent often seen in candy and gum.  Taste- 3.5 out of 5. A slightly syrupy taste of caramel malt initially hits the tongue (I suspect a sucrose-based syrup was used as part of the malting process), followed by a buttery kind of malt and a bit of fruity ester sweetness. There is an aftertaste of brown sugar and those green raisins mentioned on the label. Hardly any bitterness from the hops at all. The alcohol is only an undertone, not at all an 8% ABV sort of taste. I've heard a few people say that this beer has some phenolic (e.g. reminiscent of sanitizer residue, band-aids, plastic, etc.) taste, but luckily I cannot detect it. Not bad, but the taste isn't balanced. Belgian beers are usually experimental and unorthodox, but this one seems rather chaotic and unbalanced-- a result of trying to imitate the style without being an expert in it, I suppose.  Mouthfeel- 3.5 out of 5. Light at first, then fills out to medium. It's surprisingly smooth and light in texture for an 8% ABV beer. Wet and carbonated, not crisp, but not unpleasant.  Drinkability- 4 out of 5. It's far from being a great Belgian beer, but it's definitely drinkable-- almost dangerously so, considering its 8% ABV. Its drinkability is its saving grace. If you find this on tap, and there's not much else in your taste/price range, I'd recommend it, but take it slow. This is the kind of beer that sneaks up on you at the end of the night, when you lurch off your bar stool to stumble to the bathroom and realize you suddenly have four feet.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Belgian Dark Strong Ale,83

Smell: Weaker than I would expect. Belgian yeast, ripe berries, grapefruit, celery, malt; copper, indicating that it is perhaps slightly autolyzed.  Taste: Caramel with a hint of coffee and dark chocolate; grain and raisin, hop bitterness on the finish with a slight artificial sugar taste.  Mouthfeel: Medium, syrupy body and finish with barely noticeable carbonation; bitter and filmy finish with a faint hint of alcohol.  Drinkability & Final Thoughts: Meh. Certainly not a good example of a Belgian strong dark. The aroma was disconcerting and I am just not sure if I had a bad bottle or what.

In smelling it, I get a sweet smell from the roasted malt, with a hint of raisin.  First drink - I'm thinking this beer should be named Raisin D'Etre. Very caramelly, very raisin-dominant flavors. Maybe an orange note from the hops, with a minor in grassy undertones.  If you like sweet malty beers, you'll love this one. It has your caramel, it has your raisins, it has your malty lead.

Appearance: Poured from the bottle, the beer is a rich, dark, opaque brown color. Not quite sure what is going on tonight, but every beer I've enjoyed has been lacking in the head department. Jeez, this is why I drink beer...it's the only head I get! Anyway, I can see the sporadic bubble creeping up from the bottom of the glass, but all that's really there is a thin ring of off-white bubbles encircling the beer.

Strange, I'm actually getting some chocolate making its way through. I'm liking it so far.  Taste: I do love what DFH does with beer! Dark candied fruit and milk chocolate, an interesting combination. The alcohol is very well hidden, I'm not picking up any of the 8%. Pretty damn tasty this is.  Mouthfeel: Well done here.

A nice representation of the classic Belgian dark ale.  Aromas are quite strong with dark fruit and alcohol taking up most of the sniffing room. Dates and grapes are in there somewhere, as is a mustiness that smells like a dank cellar. This is a good thing!  The raisin flavor is surprisingly prominent as is a candied sweetness that may be a shade too sugary. The strong, dry ending is indicative of this type of Belgian ale and it's accompanied by a slight chalkiness and obscure hints of vanilla and caramel.  I think the alcoholic kick at the conclusion can occasionally numb the tongue to the flavor and this palette scrape gets worse as the beer warms. The dryness and sweetness are both a bit cumbersome and some balance could be attained through aging. It's too sweet for multiple samplings, but it's decent enough to warrant a go-round.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Belgian Dark Strong Ale,83

It dropped after a few minutes, but lingered nicely even after the glass was empty. Looks promising out of the bottle.  The smell surprised me. I picked up some unusual fruit aromas, dark fruit, including prune. Not what I expected or wanted. Nice malty aroma was underneath the fruit, and wish this was more pronounced. Not a bad smell at all; just not what I expect from a strong dark ale.  A Dogfish brew where the flavor did not jump out at me. Surprising, to say the least. Dark fruit and malt, much like the aroma. There is that prune like sense again. Not bad; just not what I'm looking for. Carbonation is surprisingly subdued. Pleasant.  Mouthfeel is fine; wet, but not watery; smooth and full but not rich. This beer feels better than it tastes. It appears to be quite drinkable, but the ABV will prevent that. Two at most for a bloke like myself that wants to have an evening taste from a favorite glass.  I can't say this brew is bad, but as a Dogfish drinker I don't believe I'll be purchasing another sixpack after this one's finished. Give it a chance if your curious, as this taste is different.

Feels moderate to full with relative smoothness throughout. Carbonation is subtle.  Okay but not great. Decent beer for dubbel or quad fans but might also turn them off with the bitterness factor.

Taste: Sugary sweet roasted malt to start combines with a strong nutty flavor. Rum soaked raisins along with some moderate other dark fruits. Finishes with just a touch of bitterness. The tastes do not really blend together very well - each one exists on its own.  Mouthfeel: Slightly creamy, despite the below average carbonation. Medium body. Finishes with a strong oily residue.

The taste is unimpressive. This tastes no better than a Beck's Dark with more alcohol. The caramel sweetness and floral hops overtones continue on into the taste and are just as unimpressive.

White grapes perhaps. A weird alcoholic scent on the end of the inhale that smells of funky spices. It's interesting.  T - Not as the nose hinted at all. The flavors are as hinted - raisins, grapes, and some spice but they are very subdued. The beer is dominated instead by a weird metallic taste. Whatever maltiness it has tastes kind of artificial, for whatever reason. I can't say it's below average really, but I just don't really get what Dogfish is trying to do here.  M - Not balanced. Starts medium to full bodied and ends watery and thin and I presume that's what kills the flavors, along with a high carbonation profile which it also has. It does leave a bit of a dry finish.

Less carbonated and not as phenolic as your typical Belgian Strong Dark Ale, and yet I like it better than most beers from the style. M: full bodied, thicker than medium, a bit resiny, sweetish, some spice on the palate (though nothing approaching a Unibroue), mild and passing finish.

A few carbonation trailers, and that's it. The aroma starts off as an amaretto, with perfumy highlights. First taste is like a bitter porter and feels the same. Afterward, two flavors hit a wall: a bitter green leafiness (or unripe coffee bean), and a sharp, metallic sweetness. The finish is alcoholic, sticky, and lingers, but ultimately feels way too flat.

Smell - Dark malts, nice roasted notes, and some sweetness that I can't really explain. Maybe from the raisins? It's like a dry sweetness. Also picking up some toffee and a hint of cinnamon. Definitely the weak point of the beer. Not a big overall aroma, but still good.  Taste - Roasted flavors mixed with some dark fruits, and a nice dry roasted (almost woody) finish. The flavor has a nice balance to it in that the sweetness is not overpowering and is kept in check by the dryness. Alcohol is hidden very well.  Mouth Feel - Medium/Full bodied with smooth carbonation. Really pleasant going down. Gets a tiny bit syrupy as the beer warms and the carbonation comes out of the beer.  Drinkability - Very easy to drink dark ale with alcohol that is hard to detect. Dogfish describes this beer as a ""Belgian-style brown ale brewed with beet sugar, raisins, and Belgian-style yeast.""

10099,1180,Spider889,3.52,"I first had this beer a year ago and loved it at the time. ""Raison D'Etre"" being a play on words between the raisin ingrediants and the French, meaning; ""reason to be.""  The beer smells of sour fruit, muted brown sugar, and mild hops.  The taste is a little all over the place. In some sips I get the flavor of sour grapes and bitter white raisins along with brown sugar and mild alcohol warmth. Other sips are more alcohol foreward and unripened fruit-bitter. Hops are present but muted by unbalanced malt and the alcohol.  The beer is very carbonated, going in tune with the Belgian style I guess. It finishes very bitter and dry on the palate.  I still enjoy this brew, but it's not as good as I remembered it. Now I find myself wishing I had just bought 90 min IPA instead.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Belgian Dark Strong Ale,83
10099,1180,Kinsman,3.49,"Poured from 12oz bottle into pint glass  A dark mahogany colored ale with red highlights capped by a thin ecru head. Quite bubbly along the walls of the glass.  Sweet and a bit fruity on the nose. Most notable would be raisins and brown sugar. Some of the malt makes its way through with hints of caramel.  Not your typical BSDA on the palate, but not in a bad way. I'm thinking of a medley of fruits on the tongue, like apples and grapes. Belgian yeast seems to be hidden on this, probably covered up by the flavors of the malt.  Pleasant mouthfeel, but a little too carbonated it seems. Overall a decent beer but comes across as being a bit to sweet for me.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Belgian Dark Strong Ale,83
10099,1180,elcapness17,4.45,"This is a great beer. 8% abv, but it drinks very easily. It has a very unique flavor, and as an earlier person noted, the taste is that of a dark fruit. You can definitely taste the green raisins and beet sugars, but it's rounded off nicely with a bit of astringency. It gets more drinkable as it warms, and although the smell isn't phenomenal it is certainly not bad. I would recommend this if you are looking for something unique. I have a feeling that I could drink a six pack of these in one night, which is foreboding in the best way.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Belgian Dark Strong Ale,83

Little bits of tannish bubbles stick around the top.  Sort of a dark fruit thing going on, a little bit of sweetness mixed in, the smell is nice, warm and inviting. The taste is a little more interesting. A bit of a bite, slightly sour, slightly sweet. A nice dance.  Nice warmth, medium body.

S - Smells of dark fruit an alcohol T - Sweet raisin taste followed by bitter raisin taste which may have been from the grapefruit hops. Interesting M - Really thin for 8 percent and smooth. D - Man this is weird but I think this is the first dogfish head I actually liked!

There's a low- to moderate level of carbonation visible. S: Dark fruits and sweetness dominate the aroma. T: Flavors of raisins, dark fruit and brown sugar stand out in the initial taste, followed by the underlying malts and sweetness. The alcohol leaves a bit of heat in the finish, along with a bit of bitterness from the hops. M: The beer feels medium bodied on the palate and the level of carbonation seems just right and does not make it taste too heavy or syrupy.

The presence of added sugar is undeniable. Metallic notes in aftertaste.  Mouthfeel- Syrupy not as effervecent as expected.  Drinkability- Ok I suppose. It has the Belgian essence but it just feels off. It's not a bad beer but I feel like it's missing something. Dogfish Head seems to throw caution to the wind as their modus opperandi. While this can sometimes be rewarding, it also causes them to occasionally miss the mark.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Belgian Dark Strong Ale,83
10099,1180,BuckyFresh,3.47,"Appearance: Poured from a 12oz bottle into a pint glass. The beer is Ruby/Mahogany in color with a 1-2 finger head that recedes quickly. The color of the head is a nice caramel. Lacing is minimal and slides off the sides of the glass fairly fast. Pretty light carbonation rising from the bottom of the glass.  Smell: I was kind of surprised by this one; I get a pretty funky yeast aroma, almost reminiscent of a Trappist ale. Dark fruits and some alcohol are detectable, as well as brown sugar and molasses. There is also a bit of toasted malt and maybe a bit of caramel.  Taste: Due to my love of Trappist ales, I was pretty excited to taste this one after indulging in its aroma. Unfortunately, I was pretty disappointed with the flavor. There is an unpleasant metallic presence and an astringency that are not at all what the aroma suggests. The beer manages to be a little alcoholic and a little watery at the same time. The alcohol flavor kind of disguises the malt and hops presence, and a lack of carbonation adds to the unbalance.  Mouthfeel: Medium-bodied and maybe a touch watery. Balance feels a bit out of whack due to the alcohol flavor and low carbonation.  Drinkability: Didn't really go down all that smoothly. The alcohol flavor would definitely get to me after awhile, and the higher ABV might also prevent this one from being a go-to session beer.  An interesting beer to say the least. I'm glad I tried it, but I don't think I'll be running out to restock any time soon.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Belgian Dark Strong Ale,83

Alcohol arises in the final scents  T- toasted malt flavor and the sweetness of raisins. The alcohol warming on the way down.  M- full bodied with decent carbonation.

The aroma is malty and sweetish with some dark fruit and woodiness. The flavor is sweet, a bit earthy, and malty. There is some beet-like sweetness (yeah, I know the beet sugar doesn't impart flavor, but there is a beety quality anyway), a slight phenolic edge, and a carmelly finish.

I only wish I had a better sense of smell because there must be more. A deep earthy taste takes center stage with balanced hops and malts taking up the background. Subtle raisin and sweet alcohol rub shoulders with an almost slightly oak taste and combine to make a brandy-like swallow and dry finish. The mouthfeel is the only thing I wasn't too keen on because it was quite foamy until it settles down to give you all it has to offer.  As always, a complex beer that is enjoyable to sip and ponder but not an everyday drinker. Every once and awhile, you do need to have something to challenge your senses.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Belgian Dark Strong Ale,83
10099,1180,rfabian,4,Poured into a tumbler it produces a small head with surprisingly solid lacing. The appearance is dark amber and clear. The aroma is mainly of malt with some fruitiness. The taste is sweet with what I swear is the flavor of MD 20-20 coming in. Must be the raisins. The feel is medium bodied with a Belgium ale finish.  This is a smooth and enjoyable dark ale.

To me personally, the taste is what killed it, or to be more precise, the flavor. It is not too strong or overbearing, just unpleasant to my palate.

The sweetness remains. The essence of fruitcake perhaps. The 8% ABV is there, not well hidden, but not overpowering. The taste is a tab on the thick side, almost syrupy-like.  I can't see ever drinking this with dinner. I would say enjoy on its own or with some strong flavored cheese perhaps.

T: Flavor almost exactly follows the aroma. Malty with the banana and clove type flavors. Quite sweet actually, would like some sort of bitterness here. Banana lingers around for a bit too long.  M: Not full bodied enough, thin. Carbonation seems to completely die by the end of the glass.  D: Eh, most BSDA's aren't highly drinkable, but this beer doesn't make you want to have another.

10099,1180,TCHopCraver,3.15,"Split a 12 oz. bottle. Reviewed from notes on 3/20/10. Date bottled is 12/4/09.  A: Poured into an oversized wine glass. Had a ruby-mahogany color with a 1 finger head, which retains pretty well. Small, dotty lacing which was accompanied by a viscous film on the glass. I thought this was a very attractive beer.  S: A very interesting combination of scents bombarded my nose. There was a funky-yeasty component, a zesty, coriander, pepper smell, along with some sweeter aromas- raisin, brown sugar, and some plum notes. It actually smells pretty boozy. I would've guessed it was higher than 8%, actually. A bizarre and complex smelling beer, to be sure.  T: Whoa, not really like the smell at all, in a pretty disappointing manner. All of the exciting hints from the aroma are pushed way to the background and the overwhelming flavor is a mineral-wateriness. The coriander and pepper are a relatively prominent player, but that coppery-water taste is just dominating my mouth. The finish is astrigent and coppery.  M: Starts with good carbonation and a decent medium weight, but it ends with a thin, watery feel that is not desirable.  D: No thanks, I will not have another (and I only had half of one). The copper astringency is just too much for my palate to handle. Maybe aging would help this, but I will look elsewhere for examples of this style. I will say this: If the taste had lived up to the smell, I would have given this much higher marks.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Belgian Dark Strong Ale,83

Mouthfeel has a lot of carbonation and some dryness. Drinkability is okay; I wouldn't buy this often even if it were available.

Nose really doesn't have much, but some sugary raisin.  Mouth is exceptionally smooth, a soft medium body that just goes down real easy. The taste is a little sugary. subtle hints of raisin. and maybe dates or other dark fruits. Belgian sugars and definite maltiness in the finish.

Lots of earthy notes on the nose. Caramel malts, raisins, almost smells like it has some vegetable notes. Touch of wood. Would be nice if the aroma were a little stronger.  Taste is malty with bits of fruit, mostly grapes and raisins. A faint smokey presence, mixed with some light wood. Has some funky sugary flavors that must be from the beet sugar. Just a touch of alcohol, but basically unnoticeable. Malts are caramel like and a bit bready. Slightly astringent on the finish with some sugar.  Mouthfeel is pretty good for a Belgian Ale. Smooth, almost creamy body with ample carbonation. A small trace of warming alcohol.  Drinkability is about average. Nothing about the beer really draws me back to the glass, but the body is nice and the flavor has some subtle intricacies that move it beyond the average beer. ABV pushes the drinkability somewhat, but finishing a bottle is no problem.  Overall, this is a pretty decent brew from Dogfish Head. Decent flavor and body, but the beer leaves you wanting something more, especially when you consider some of the other Dogfish Head brews like World Wide Stout and Burton Baton.

Burnt, sweet, and burn (from the alcohol). Not much subtlety here. A little tartness. Did I mention burnt?  Moderate mouthfeel. It helps keep that burnt flavor on the tongue.  A bit tough to drink until the 8.0 ABV kicks in. I'd have been upset if this had been a only a 4.0.  In the end, it's the ABV that saves this beer. By the end of the first glass, your'e only just a bit wistful that there isn't more flavor.

I can sense some spice in it, too; guessing nutmeg or allspice.  T: Right away it hits you with a strong bite from the alcohol, followed by the sweetness from the sugar and malts. It finishes with a bitter taste from the alcohol and hops. Something just seems to be missing with this taste. The sweetness is there, but it doesn't mask the bitterness from the alcohol very well.

Dark fruity sweetness, well-rounded malts, slight berry or stone fruit esters. First impression on sipping it is the massive mouthfeel - hugely thick, sugary slickness. The sweetness lingers throughout and is backed up by a strong second-string malty presence.

Taste was hard to pin down: it seemed a bit muddled with perhaps too much going on and nothing clear. Follows the nose and is quite sugary, with very mild hop presence.

10099,1180,deleted_user_345250,3.03,"Bought a six-pack of this stuff a while ago and figured I'd review one. Watching Olympic ski-jumping only requires half of one's attention, so seemed a good occasion to multi-task.  This beer's pretty enough - a deep copper with and almost-molasses core is nearly-opaque is flanked by honey-colored highlights. A finger or so of khaki head contains tight, shining bubbles. Lacing is wet and fleeting on the swirl.  Aromas of dark fruit and malt are prominent at first, but give way to a chalky somewhat vegetal smell. Can't quite get my finger on what it is, but I don't love it. Re-agitating this brew after a few sips releases a massive sweetness, which is interesting though not particularly refreshing.  The first sip gives a bittersweet splash of carbonation, which fizzles quickly to leave a syrupy, pasty mouthfeel. Other posters have mentioned a strong alcoholic taste that I didn't get, but it is a bit vinous to me. More than anything, I'm getting sweet and sugary.  Overall, not a fan of this offering. The syrupy sweetness makes it tough to have more than one for sure and I didn't find it balanced or interesting enough to make it a favored sipper. Will stick with other DFH products and file this one away under ""noble experiment gone awry"".",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Belgian Dark Strong Ale,83

D: not as good as most beers in this category, this being my top style it was rather disappointing. it drinks like it is at least 10% abv; 8% abv is on the low end of the spectrum for the category and the booze should be undetectable at this level. I am going to lay one of these down for some time and see if it improves ( probably not but its worth a try). dogfish head seems to never let me down and they did on this one.

10099,1180,elgiacomo,3.85,"Cellar review, same Jan 12, 2010 batch, enjoyed Jan 6, 2011. One year old and this held up quite nicely  Appearance improves with a better head and retention along with a fair bit of haze in the glass.  Aroma also improves, good strength and features brown/candi sugar, green raisins, dark fruits, belgian yeast, bubblegum, bread/toast, toffee, and even some spice such as cinnamon. Quite complex.  Flavor features brown sugar, molasses, green raisins and fruity esters, toffee, caramel malt, bread & yeast. No alcohol. Quite sweet, low bitterness, lingering finish. Good flavor but not the best I've had in the style.  Mouthfeel improves as I find this to be creamy, foamy and smooth, medium bodied but manages to feel relatively light, low to medium carbonation.  I have to say that a year did this brew some good. Definitely enjoying it now more than I did when fresh. Might hafta stick another sixer in the cellar.

Pours dark amber/copper/reddish, with almost no head in a goblet, 1.5 finger off-white head in a shaker. Leaves a ring and a tiny bit of lacing.  Aroma is pretty weak, but contains raisins, a little bit of other dark fruits, and some caramel malts.  Flavor is bigger than the aroma, pretty sweet, dark fruits and caramel malts. Sweet finish.  Mouthfeel is slick, medium-bodied, low to medium carbonation.  It's OK...pretty good, not outstanding, but how many Belgian Strong Ales do you find in a 6-pack for $9.99?

Pretty good aroma, but a little bit strong.  T - I enjoyed the taste more than I thought that I would. It has some raison and malty flavor, as well as a bit of a hop bite. The flavor that I wasn't expecting was the wood flavors. They are light hints, but they really pull the whole taste together.  M/D - This beer feels viscous in your mouth, without compromising the smoothness. It is a pretty easy beer to drink, and it packs a pretty good flavor as well.  Bottom line: This beer is a sweet little treat. I would gladly buy a 6 pack of this stuff. It is nice and easy to taste and has a correct amount of hops and wood accents to round out a raison flavor.  -Cheers!",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Belgian Dark Strong Ale,83
10099,1180,steve8robin,4.08,"Got this one after becoming a fan of DFH...  A: Very good looking. Deep red almost like cranberry juice with a super thick off-white head. Very unique color.  S: Smells good. I'm getting raisins, oakiness, and hints of sugar in the nose. Almost like a raisin bread. Scent is not as upfront as I would've liked, but once I am able to lock into it, that's what I smell.  T: Strange taste, for some of the wrong reasons. Taste is of raisin with what taste like soap. Raisin taste is good until the soapy taste creeps in. Very slight hops on the backend. Eh, not too good.  M: Very good mouthfeel. Good carbonation to water balance. Smooth and leaves some unique flavors on your palate.  D: Perfect. Goes down super easy. No complaints here.  All in all, this is a decent brew to try once. Not one of the best from DFH. I'd recommend trying Santo Marron if you want to try a good DFH brew. Only try this if you've had some good brews from DFH.

10099,1180,OldSchoolGamer,3.58,"This is probably one of the least talked about Dogfish Head brews. While somewhat lacking compared to others in their lineup, this is still a quality beer. Here is my review:  A: Pours a hazy brownish amber color. Head dissipates rather quickly, but there is some really nice lacing action.  S/T: The aroma is full of dark fruit along with a nice malty sweetness. Maybe some brown sugar in there. Taste is pretty good. The dark fruit is the very first thing you get. Mostly plum and raisin. Then the sweet malt comes through with hint of toffee and brown sugar. There is also a touch of green apple in there as well. A nice, complex Belgian Ale. Not my favorite, but still very good.  M/D: Mouthfeel is on the medium side. Carbonation is good and is slightly bubbly in the mouth. Drinkability is fine. This is a type of beer I drink on occasion. Not something to session or have everyday.  Of all the year-round beers from Dogfish Head, I think this is probably my least favorite. Not a bad beer by any means, this is definetly worth checking out, especially if you like Belgian Ales and raisins.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Belgian Dark Strong Ale,83
10099,1180,theboozecruise,3.77,"Poured from a 12 oz. bottle into a Chimay goblet. It pours a dark ruby color, smallish off-white head. It appears to be filtered as there is not cloudiness in the beer. It's alright, but nothing outstanding on the eye.  The smell is a little confusing, but I like it. Definite darker fruit smells, plums and raisins. There is also a little caramel malt in there, like there's some brown ale influence.  The taste is more of the same, raisins mixed with the malty flavors, but the hop presence comes out much more on the tongue than the nose. It tastes more like a Belgian ale than it smells. I like it, but still not top notch.  No complaints about the mouthfeel, but I can't see throwing these back. It's hard for me to define 'drinkability' with a beer like this, but it doesn't make me excited to dirnk another, I'd rather move on to something different, so I can't give it too high of a score.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Belgian Dark Strong Ale,83

Pours a deep crimson with a strong head of khaki that stood for several minutes (without starch, no less!) before settling away into the bloody sea. The waves smell rollingly of raisins, dark malts, and figs, each progressively smashing the olfactory rocks throughout the sniff. The figgy waves, though, are the ones that hit the hardest once the tasting begins, the malts and raisins rowing ashore bedecked in full ninja regalia. This covert crew and their more ostentatious front-line compatriots sit somewhat heavily on the tongue, almost languishing there, but are saved by the grace of a very smooth texture, keeping them from malingering in Limbo with Virgil and his cohorts, but not raising them too far up the purgatorial mountain.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Belgian Dark Strong Ale,83

Aroma is dark malt, and carmel, and some kind of spice that reminds me of dirt kind of.  Taste is about the same as the aroma, good dark malt, caramel, and that dirt, maybe earthy is a better descriptor here, and maybe a touch of cinnamon.  mouthfeel is medium, and fairly creamy.  Overall, this is a really good beer, and the ABV is masked really well, It doesn't really strike me as a BDSA, but it is still a really good beer.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Belgian Dark Strong Ale,83
10099,1180,Tolnik,4.47,Poured this dark ruby brown beer into a pint glass. The head that was poured into the pint glass was a good half an inch of head. It then reduced down to faint wisps of lacing. The aroma of smell that wafts from this beer is that of a malt and raisin. The taste follows suit in the taste but follows a sweeter taste of raison. Yet there is also a hint of plum taste as well. Overall a great beer by the brewers of Dogfish Head.,Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Belgian Dark Strong Ale,83
10099,1180,Infamous7100,3.35,"A: Poured a dark copper almost maroon color into my snifter. Minimal head, no lacing to speak of. Color looks great, but head unremarkable. S: The first thing that jumps out at me is the malty sweetness. This is accompanied by a sugar/spice aroma which I would attribute to the dark fruits like raisins or perhaps grapes. I'm getting a twinge of alcohol as well. Not as good as some others I have had. T: I was taken aback a little by the earthy, roasted flavor that came out right away. The malts were very sweet to the nose. This roasted flavor went away quickly as the fruits and sweetness took over. M: It's a little sticky on the lips after a few sips. There is mild carbonation and quite a bit of alcohol aftertaste. It's not the most pleasant experience. D: Just about right for an 8% beer. You know the alcohol is there and it sticks for a while, but no so much that you don't want to have some more. The malty/fruit balance is good, but I'm not sure I like the smokiness or roastedness of the malts. Other Belgian strong darks I have experienced don't have this.

My palate has changed a bit over the last couple of years as I've explored the craft beer world a bit more, but I still think this was a pretty decent beer.  Pours a golden brown color with great clarity. No real head to it, there was a slight white head that went away fairly quickly and less than average lacing, but looked better than average for this style of beer. The smell is a little unique, very sweet smelling, much like sweet roasted malts. A slight smell of hop, but clearly a malt dominated beer. The taste is very similar to the smell. Sweet roasted malts, toffee, caramel, brown sugar and a bit of a buttery taste. Much like the smell, there isn't much of a hop taste to it, dominated by the malts agian. The mouthfeel is good. Pretty smooth, nothing bitter about it due to the lack of hoppy flavor. I think this is a pretty drinkable beer, I was finished with it before I really knew it.

10099,1180,halo21,4.32,"Appearance: Pours a nice glowing amber-whiskey color, with a creamy, finely carbonated head.  Smell: Sweet and malty, with a ton af sugar and fruit notes; figs and raisins. Scotch style heat is in the far background, with a bit of hops in the middle.  Taste: Big malty and sweet, with candy and fruits, with warming esters. Sweetness is very present, but not overbearing; comparable to some Scottish malts; found in both beer and Scotch.  Mouthfeel: Medium bodied, smooth and fine carbonation. Leaves your palate dry, and full of flavor.  Drinkability/Palitability: This beer, as with all by Dogfish Head, is big and robust. The first one will go down easy, so don't let these sneak up on you. Having a few is not far fetched, surprisingly for this sized brew.  Notes: I went into this review, with the Raison D'Êtra being one of my favorite beers from one of my favorite breweries (was not a fan of the Festina Peche). One of the best part about starting the blog is the chance to re-evaluate all the beers I have already enjoyed.

Pours into my Dogfish Head Raison D'etre goblet at the appropriate temperature (01/20/10). Back in 2006 I was very into this beer and as I made my way through the case, I became less of a fan and put some into the ""cellar"".  A: Pours a rather murky shade of mahogany capped with a one finger off-white head with decent retention and small patches of lace.  S: Rather earthy with some toasted/burnt malt and some Belgian candy sugar. It has an overall dark fruit aroma with hints of molasses and brow sugar.  T: I will say that this beer has aged quite well and is significantly better than when it is served fresh. Dark fruits surrounded by layers of brown sugar and Belgian candied sugar dominate the flavor profile. Some burnt malt is found as well, but not nearly as intense as when fresh.  M: Medium-bodied with lower carbonation and a rather oily mouthfeel.  D: The 8% abv. is rather well hidden, but the flavors do not lend themselves to more than a couple in an evening.

Otherwise, dark fruit and grape flavors, with a moderate molasses like sweetness.  Taste: Carbonation and alcohol bite on the first sip. Mild darker malts, but not overly toasted or roasted tasting. Some grape and dark fruit flavors, but not dominating. Very well balanced. Moderate sweetness. Not much in the way of hops, except the possible dark fruit flavors.

Actually not as sweet as I expected at all. Rather than a doppelbock-like raisiny flavor, it has the dry malt of a Belgian ale. Slightly chalky. Ample sour notes here seem off the mark to me, but that's how the green raisins make their presence felt. Has kind of the DFH house character. Raisin flavor is apparent on the finish. A little hop bittering. There are some things going on, but it's not too enjoyable.  Feels a bit thin. Carbonation is on the mark though. Body is slick and not hefty enough.  This one is kind of weird for me. Kind of hot going down and in my stomach. I normally really like DFH too. I have five more, so I hope there's time for it to grow for me.

Apricot, date, raisin, shortbread, plum, ginger.  T: Wow! There's a veritable symphony of flavors right off the bat.

D: Always cellar this beer! During its sojourn in the cellar, it has clouded a bit, but the most prominent feature is the condensing and accentuating of the nose and flavour: I'm reminded of a sherry, port, or (especially) madeira. The raisin quality has come much more to the forefront, whilst the overall profile is smoother and gentler than in the fresh bottle.

The beer was fairly dry and the malt and spice-like characteristics didn't really seem married in their flavor. It seemed like there were multiple flavors here that just didn't go together well.

My nose picked up dark fruits, spice and alcohol in the background.  Taste is somewhat sweet and plumlike with a spicy slightly alcoholic finish.  A notch or two north of thin bodied..The richness of this beer makes it seem thicker than it is. Moderate carbonation.

(A)- Pours a copper amber color that produced an immediately dissipating off-white head. A dark ale? Doesnt look like one.  (S)- Mountains of molasses coated raisins. A touch of butterscotch sweetness.  (T)- Lightly sweet raisins coated with a nutty sugary caramel / butterscotch maltiness.  (M)- Good carbonation level & balance for what it is/has. A little too sweet.  (D)- An interesting beer with some good things going for it. My only complaint is how sweet it was. It should be better fresher.,Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Belgian Dark Strong Ale,83
10099,1180,Soneast,3.48,"Pours a clear, dark copper color, with some reddish hues, forms a small cream colored head, that dissipates quite rapidly.  The aroma consists of burnt caramel and brown sugar notes and a bit-o-nuttiness. There is also an almost smoky quality to it. Overall this smells quite sweet and rather rich.  The flavor, not unlike the aroma, is malt-centric, with those caramel and brown sugar notes coming through and once again I pick up some nuttiness reminiscent of a nut brown, and also an odd roasted quality. There are also some light green fruit flavors, more along the line of green apple than grape, but overall this beer is quite sweet, with little, to no bitterness, finishing rather sweet, never quite gets to the point of being cloyingly sweet.  Raison D'etre is not a beer I could drink more than one or two in a row.

Smelled of brown sugar and ginger like scent, plenty of spice, and some sweet malt presence in the back.  Taste and Mouthfeel:Definitely tasted of raisins as stated. I think it was the beets that came through as pumpkin on the tongue, alot of similarities to a pumpkin brew. Various spice, some grassy notes and some malt comes through on the end with a little of extra sweetness beyond that which is probably added sugar. Finished sticky with lingering earthy hop bitterness. Nothing too overwhelming.  Drinkability:Was another interesting Dogfish brew.

Smell- A high alcohol smell is the first thing to notice, as rightfully it is an 8.0 abv. A pretty strong raisin or grape scent, with some possible juniper or mint around.  Taste- I was surprised that at 8.0 abv, and because of the strong smell, that I didn't mind the taste upon first sip. Pretty smooth, raisin and orange taste.

The aroma of alcohol dominated the olfactory passageways and was followed by brown sugar, fruits, and a slight hop aroma. Upon first taste, it was sweet and sugary with a strong malty backbone that intermingled with the high alcohol content very nicely. Slight hints of plums and red grapes made their way into my senses as well. The mouthfeel was balanced well with carbonation and wasn't too thin despite the alcohol present in this one.

10099,1180,irishking1977,3.03,"2/20/2010 The last time I had this one, I found that the alcohol was really pronounced, and that the brew was highly unbalanced. Things might have changed, but that doesn't mean I like the brew any more than I did before. I thought the review needed some adjustment.  A: Opaque Brown/black/amber hue with no head at all. Mild lacing is evident.  S: I detect this unusual funky sweetness that might be in part by some sugar added and the Belgian yeast.  T: Malty and fruity but not a natural fruity sweetness. Alcohol is pronounced, but not as much as I remember. I don't really detect any characteristics of a Belgian strong dark ale; it reminds me more of a sweet funky Belgian type stout. Whatever it is, its an unusual combination, that's for sure.  M: Carbonation is on the low side, but not as low as I recall, which adds a .5 to the rating. Somewhat watered down, but also mildly thick and chalky. Not as unbalanced as I recall, but still a bit unbalanced.  D: For the sake of a proper and fair review, this is why I purchase a single; to remind myself why I didn't love this one. Not terrible, but not a brew I will have again. It just seems like this one isn't sure what it's supposed to be, because it sure isn't quite a Belgian ale. The high ABV, and unbalanced nature of this brew makes it a sipper, and certainly not an overly enjoyable sipper. Definitely not a quaffer or session. That could make someone violently ill, I'd imagine.  Review below from 12/19/09 I've had Rasion D'Etre before, but directly from the bottle. I figured I would give a second try, even though it seemed to be a bit unrefined the first time.  A: Surprised that it poured a dark garnet/black with a thick head and quite a bit of lacing. Very nice indeed.  S: Mostly alcohol, fruit and malt. Not bad, but a bit over the top when it comes to the alcohol.  T: Alcohol does dominate the taste just a bit. Malt and fruit (raisins) and candy sugar is also present.  M: Fairly carbonated with an oily background. Not creamy per say, but has a decent feel to it.  D: A bit of a wild one, Rasion D'Etre is labeled as a Belgian strong dark ale but it's more of a hybrid belgian dark ale/barleywine, IMHO. It's kind of all over the place with it's tastes and the pronounced alcohol. Veteran beer drinkers don't normally want the alcohol to be so upfront on certain kinds of beers. When a brewer is able to hide the ABV, the better the brew is, on most occasions.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Belgian Dark Strong Ale,83
10099,1180,Flightoficarus,3.68,"Serving type - 12 oz bottle into Chimay goblet.  Appearance - pours a deep mahogany, as the bottle label suggests. Very little head, and minimal lacing, which seems strange for a BSDA, since many of those seem to be gushers.  Smell - Heavy on the malts. Brown sugar, candied raisins.  Taste - Much like the smell. Lots of raisin, brown sugar, and very little hop presence. A malt bomb for sure.  Mouthfeel - Medium bodied. Different than the other BSDA's I've had though, it's less complex.  Drinkability - The alcohol is very well silenced in this beer, making it pretty drinkable for an 8% beer.  Overall - Less complex than the Belgian (and some of the other American) examples of this style, but still a pretty good beer, and very reasonably priced for what it is. Worth trying.

10099,1180,BrewerMike,3.41,"I typically really enjoy Dogfish Head's brews and am equally as intrigued to learn about their unique creations and efforts to ""push the envelope."" I've tried this one several times and liked it, but had not made the effort to actually evaluate the different components. So, here goes nothin':  A: The bottle reads, ""deep mahogany ale."" Well, they got that part right. Pours with a nice tan head that dissipates after a short time and maintains some lacing after each sip. Crystal clear appearance through the rich, mahongany/chestnut color. Does not appear to have much carbonation.  S: Has somewhat of a burnt molasses aroma, as well as some dark, dried fruits. I'm not getting much hop aroma. Perhaps some pepperiness. Does not necessarily make my mouth water, but interesting nonetheless.  T: Moderately malty, with notes of molasses, dried fruits (fig, raisins), slight brown sugar. It goes down with some bitterness on the back of the throat. Tastes much better after it's sat a bit and warms. I initially tasted some metallic flavors up front when I first poured it, but as it warmed those went away, and a richer, more malty flavor took over.  M: Mouthfeel is quite nice. Has good body, even a bit chewy (especially as it warms). A bit sticky on the tongue/throat, which forces you to drink it slowly. Not very carbonated, so it allows you to really enjoy the maltiness and flavors without much distraction. [I'd be curious to taste this one brewed on cask.]  D: Particularly as this sat, I found it very drinkable. It is smooth, well balanced, and nothing about it is overpowering or shocking. The 8% abv is difficult to notice while sipping; I don't taste any heat with the beer. This is a relatively complex beer so I would not choose to drink many at a time, but could definitely enjoy two.  Overall, this is not my favorite from Dogfish Head by far, but it's definitely a really nice, interesting beer to warm you during the chilly winter months. I can imagine drinking this along side a stew, hearty soup, or a rich meal like mac/cheese or even a nice burger or meatloaf!",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Belgian Dark Strong Ale,83

Leaves a spotty film over the surface.  S- Booze (slightly sour), sweet/sugary flavor. Honestly, it smells like an amplified BMC...sort of metallic, bland, that awful aroma I associate with a bud light.  T- Sweet, maybe raisins, but I can't really say for sure. Overly sugary.

10099,1180,mmva321,3.97,"Served in a snifter, pint glass, tulip.  In my opinion, best served in a pint glass.  A: Snifter: 3.5 - The 12 oz. only fills to a part of the glass where the circumfrence is still very wide. So, a bit of a problem with the head, or lack thereof. About a finger that dissapears quickly. It leaves a quick dissolving lace.  Pint glass: 3.5 - The 12 oz. fills the pint glass. There's a little more head and it has much better retention. It appears creamy and full in the pint glass, but the color is a little inconsistent, being rich at the top and a little thin at the bottom. Lace is still insignificant.  Tulip: 3.5 - The 12 oz. fills the tulip. There's little head and very little retention. I poured a little slower here, so that may be a contributing factor.  S: An earthy, alcohol auroma comes through above all else. But his is pretty well balanced, with the sweeter smells (fruit and sugars) being allowed to have a boastful presence. (I like the smell better in the pint glass and tulip. The sweeter smells come through much more. But a little less strong).  T: On the front of the bottle it says, ""mahogany ale,"" and that's what I get. This is a bitter but woody and earthy beer with a significant alcohol flavor. But there's also a sweet and tangy raisin flavor that hits the back of the tounge. That is really the treat of drinking this beer.  **Many people here have been complaining about the alcohol flavor being too strong, if that's the case for you, and if you have more, age the beers for a month at a time. My pack was way too strong at first, but I just had one 3 months after purchase and the alcohol had backed off revealing a sweet raisen and dried fruit flavor that really compliments the mahogany taste very well.**  M: Robust and full but not overbearing. Good enough for me. Perhaps a tad too carbonated.  **Becomes a little more thin and watery upon aging but still a solid 4.**  D: This is a beer that demands you take it slowly and patiently due to its up-front flavors and high alcohol content, but when done so, this is a real treat.

I'm really confounded by this thing - I can't recall the last time I smelled a beer this devoid of flavor. It's not off-putting, so I won't give it a 1 - but geez, no aroma at all?  The taste isn't much better. There's a raisin character here with maybe a bit of yeastiness. Perhaps the slighest hint of butter as well? Aftertaste is very unpleasant - coats the tongue and causes a bit of a face-scrunching, tongue-smacking reaction afterwards.  Mouthfeel is pretty much spot on. No complaints in the department. Medium to full bodied, with good carbonation.  I don't really know what to say about this beer.

Appearance: Pours a beautiful deep toffee brown with ruby highlights; comes with a 1 finger off-white head that fades to a loose and thin skim that does not cover the surface; body is pretty clear and shows strong carbonation; slippery and foamy lacing slides back in to the drink and doesn't hold long.  Smell: Wonderful, caramel sweetness combined with dark fruity esthers (fig and raisin); slight alcoholic vapor but pretty well masked; slight candied sugars and a toasty graininess comes out as it warms.  Taste: Very similar to the smell; slightly bready quality and the caramel sweetness is a bit more subdued in the mouth, as are the dark fruits; a mild bitterness sneaks through as well in the back; overall, it's pretty good but I feel a little misled by the smell as I felt it would be a bit sweeter.  Mouthfeel: Strong carbonation; body feels a little oily and slick, leaves a very thin coating but overall it finishes dry; belly is left quite warm.  Drinkability: Not bad overall, I would drink it again, but I don't think I'd go out of my way to pick up another bottle. If it was on tap though, I'd be excited to give it a shot.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Belgian Dark Strong Ale,83
10099,1180,HopsGirl7,4.22,"Raison D'etre is one of my favorite beers.  It is sweet, as it is brewed with raisins, but the sweetness is well balanced and not overwhelming.  The beer pours a nice rich brown color and has a lighter tanish head.  It smells like raisins.  It tastes delicious. You get a malty sweetness at first and then a kick of the raisin notes and then it finishes with a little bitter reminder of the potency.  This beer is great with a peanut butter sandwich.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Belgian Dark Strong Ale,83
10099,1180,FernMaster,4.05,"Poured from a bottle into a pint glass.  I'm just going to begin by saying I love this beer. It easily has to be in my top ten favorite beers and if I lived close enough to a place to buy it on a regular basis it would be up there with Rogue Dead Guy Ale and Goose Island's Matilda in my most purchased beer category.  I bought this because of the absurdity promised on the label, beet sugars(?), green raisins(!), what's with this crap? Brown Ale or Belgian Dark Ale, call it what you will because I'm damn fine with it either way. Also it gives you the ability to make many cheap jokes based on the title; like this facebook status of mine, ""Ah, my Raison D'Être's - how I have so few of you left.""  Raison D'Être pours with two finger worth of head that stays around for a minute or two, long enough to enjoy but not too long as to get in the way. As you drink, several layers of lacing form, which equals cool. The smell on this one is currently faint, I blame it on the cold, but the smell (as I remember and can pick up) is peculiar. There's some definite sweet characteristics to it, brown sugar, a little bit of fruits - presumably the raisons - and possibly the last hard to identify smell is the freaking beets! I have to remember this was made with beet sugars, I love Dogfish Head. The taste is fully backed up by the smell! I hate it when I become fully enamored with the smell of a beer and the taste doesn't follow suit, fortunately that's not a problem with this beer. In the taste you get the malts, the raisons, the sweetness and some sort of other added spices. All of it works beautifully together and it's a freaking joy to drink. If you see this in your local beer stores selection and you haven't tried it yet, please do yourself the favor of purchasing this beer. It'll rock you from the pour to the final drink.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Belgian Dark Strong Ale,83

Brown sugar and raisins. Nice foamy head when poured aggresively  S: very sweet and roasty. very little alchohol and virtually no hop presence. Dark fruits abundant  T: Definitly does not taste like any belgian ale Ive had. Its much more like a brown ale as the bottle suggests. Fruity up front with a sweet background. midle to end is smokey malt and raisins.  M: thick and chewy. sticky. slightly astringint finish.

Better than I anticipated, with subtle malt suggestions of DFH 60, 90 and Indian Brown Ale.  Appearance was a deep copper amber color. Acceptable 1 finger head with satisfactory retention and impressive lace. Aromas are more subtle than anticipated, roasty malts, molasses and maybe whispers of spicy raison/mulled cider spices or something like that.

The smell and taste were dominated by brown sugar with a hint of dried fruit. The feel was thick, bitter, and bready. It was a smooth autumn sipper.  Raison D'etre does not have the strong raison taste I feared. It's really nothing more than a complex, sweet, slightly fruity brown ale with a ton of character. It was very tasty.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Belgian Dark Strong Ale,83

There is not a great deal of flavor here. There is a mild sweetness up front with lots of malt. There is a bit of a vanilla aftertaste.  I was not impressed the first time I had this beer.

10099,1180,wesbrownyeah,3.38,"Dogfish Raison D'etre... fancy name with 8% alcohol.  A- Pours a brown amber colored fluid with small to none head that leaves a touch of floating froth.  S- Nothing to impressive just a little dark roasted malts, light raisons and alcohol esters. Also sweet brown sugar can be noted.  T-M- First taste to come to mind is a thick metallic flavor that lingers on the tounge. After the harsh metals are gone comes a mild toasted carmel malt flavor followed by a warming alcohol bite. Leaves a herbal tint on the tongue. Mouthfeel is good with little carbonation to even out the heavy flavor this one packs.  D- Not a bad beer overall just not balanced enough to enjoy more than one.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Belgian Dark Strong Ale,83
10099,1180,hossua34,3.45,"A - Dark, woody brown - clear but dense. Medium-small head, with average retention. An average amount of lacing.  S - A light smell of sweet, woody, fruity malts. Raisin and grape notes are present.  T - First impression is not good: like sucking on a penny. Serious metallic taste issues - not cool. Once you get past that, the dominant flavor is a sticky-sweet flavor approaching that of artificial rum raisin. Some spices present. A strong alcohol taste is present too, sweet and warm, but overall a bit too heavy.  M - Mouthfeel is affected negatively by the alcohol taste. Carbonation level is good, but the thickness if questionable.  D - Heavy, sticky, sweet.

M: The mouthfeel is meduim to full and leaves a mouth-coating residue behind.

10099,1180,aristeros,4.05,"Bought a six of these because I went out looking for Punkin Ale and there wasn't any, and I figured that Dogfish was better than no Dogfish. This is the last of the six, and I was somewhat surprised to learn that it was supposed to be a Belgian Strong Dark. It explained a few things, but this beer takes some liberties.  Pours a deep walnut color, turns a lighter cola in the light. Very active carbonation. About a finger of off-white head with decent lacing and retention. Aroma was heavy on the malt, with dark fruit, just as advertised, and a bit of caramel. Some yeasty notes--banana--squeeze out but are faint.  Caramel and sweet malt up front, with a moderate raisin presence in the middle. Very smooth, with a light-moderate body. Very slight warming presence at the end, slightly creamy mouthfeel. Doesn't have the weight or heavy warming alcohol presence I expect of a Belgian Strong Dark, which is why I was surprised to read here it was supposed to imitate the style.  It's light for the style, and needs a bolder aroma. The elements are there in the taste, but it's not a big enough beer.  However, it is a good beer. All the pieces are there.  If I wasn't taking style into account or had never had a Belgian--I've had better at the same price point--I'd have given it a 4.5 in taste and 4.0 in mouthfeel. This does not have to be tweaked much to make it an exceptional BSD and I would definitely buy it again.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Belgian Dark Strong Ale,83
10099,1180,SkunkWorks,3.42,"Poured into a tuliped pint glass. Beautiful red color. Light head formation. The aroma is very pleasant and the raisins are very pronounced here. The front end of the taste is good but after a few seconds in my mouth, the overpowering taste of raisins really made it very difficult to drink. The after taste is also very overpowering and really ruins the beer. I had a hard time finishing the glass. I would recommend against.  EDIT. Updating my review. Previous score was 4.5/4.0/1.0/1.0/1.0  12 oz bottle poured into a pint glass.  Look: crimson, mahogany colored beer with a single finger tan head that doesn't have the best retention. Some lacing is left but not much.  Smell: dark caramel and dark fruit like raisin. There's some alcohol smell. Surprisingly, its lacking any kind of yeast smell or spice smell to it. Aren't Belgian Dark Strong Ales supposed to have those characters? I won't count that against it because I don't know if Belgian Dark Strong Ale is the category for this one.  Taste: alcohol is obvious. I think that might be why I originally did not like it. There's toasted malt flavors with dark fruits intermingled. The raisins are also fairly front and center. Very strange but interesting all at once. Like the nose, I can't taste any spices or things that would make me think ""Gee, this is a Belgian beer.""  Feel: very dry, carbonation is light and not incredibly noticeable, and medium bodied. Its a little sticky.  Drink: probably the low point. Though its an enjoyable beer to drink, I would not want to drink more than one in a sitting. The dryness is what would keep me away.  Overall, I'm glad I gave this one a second try and its fair shake. I think its interesting to revisit certain beers and see how your perception of them have changed over time. This beer went from being utterly undrinkable to being somewhat decent, albeit not exceptional.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Belgian Dark Strong Ale,83

Smell: Brown sugar with a nutty woody undertone?  Taste: Brown sugar is upfront followed bye some nice maltiness that turns too a woody and nutty aftertaste. There is also a burnt quality throughout. There is some boozieness too this beer but not super high.  Mouthfeel: Sticky and syrupy upfront but the finish dries off a lot.  Drinkability: The booze in this hits you at the end. It not as easy to drink as a Chimay, but what is.  Overall: This is no Chimay blue, but it is a nice stab at the style.

10099,1180,taxguyjase,3.49,"Dogfish Head Brewing puts out some...interesting beers. I really enjoy their 60 and 90 Minute IPAs, but I've heard of some of their brews where they use some gold dust or something. I saw this one at BevMo! and figured, it can't possibly be awful, so why not?  The beer pours really well - a nice rich mahogony/amber color. Expect some nice oaky, malt aroma with a hint of sweetness. Nothing that special, but good. The taste was different too - you definitely had a smooth roasted malt flavor, with this hint of sweet raisin and banana. Definitely a punch of alcohol in the taste too, so take that or leave it, it's what you're going to get. The aftertaste has more malt to it, which was nice. A good beer, but not one I'd probably go and get a lot, given it's pretty pricy (I think it was $10 a six pack).  Appearance - 4.5/5.0 - nice rich mahogony color, amber Smell -3.0/5.0 - oaky malt smell - nothing that special about the aroma Taste - 4.0/5.0 - smooth, malt, raisin, banana, little bit of roasted flavor, crisp, aftertaste is malty and very nice; lots of alcohol taste (a bit overpowering) Feel - 4.0/5.0 - aftertaste is very refreshing and malty, - 4.0 Drinkability - 3.5/5.0 - very good beer, but maybe not what I would spend 10 bucks on regularally",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Belgian Dark Strong Ale,83
10099,1180,cinemadust,4.78,"My favorite that I've had from Dogfish Head so far. It almost has a taste of tea and beer mixed together. Kind of like a spice and fruit. When I drank this from the bottle I had an almost smokey aftertaste. Drinking it from tap at the Dogfish Head brewery restaurant, was served a beer at the perfect temperature. Which made it very easy to taste all the wonderful flavors of this beer. Had barley any head at all, but that's what I like. Goes well with spicy foods. Just be VERY careful. Don't forget it's a 8% ABV. You can't knock them down like regular beers.

Surprisingly stronger tasting than what the nose suggests. Matches up with the nose, but a little more assertively. A bit of booze and some coffee and chocolate peek through as well.  Smooth with a lightly carbonated yet soft feel. About medium bodied, but a little thin for the style.  Needs a little boost in the flavor department, but still an okay beer. Lacking for the style though and there are better choices at similar or cheaper price points. I'll pass again on this one.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Belgian Dark Strong Ale,83
10099,1180,j37geogaddi,3.9,"Poured this bottle into a Sam Adams glass...Clear copper color with almost no head or lacing to be seen.  Smell is a bit faint but definitely of sweet raisins and little else.  Tastes like the smell, but not quite harshly. Again the sweet raisins come in but not as much as you'd like. But its still tasty and very pleasant.  The mouthfeel is very similar to Dogfish's IBA and is very nice. Good carbonation and heavy enough mouthfeel without being syrupy...Just my kinda beer  The 8% ABV is definitely well hidden so you can drink a few for sure without realizing its so high in alcohol but it can get a bit boring after while.  Overall I do like this beer. It almost reminds me of a really light barleywine. It is missing a few characteristics that keep it from being really outstanding however. A little more flavor and complexity would do this beer wonders. I still have to say that I sometimes crave this beer because it reminds me of a barleywine but its much easier to drink when I'm not in the mood for something so powerful.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Belgian Dark Strong Ale,83

Kind of like a mix between a BSDA and a Doppelbock or something, somewhat strange, not too crazy about it, covers the alcohol very well though.

Smell: The smell can best be described as an awesome combination of green raisins and brown sugar.  Taste: Perhaps a little too sweet. The dark savory sweetness reminds me of a porter.

Not at all a fan of the taste, syrupy and smoky, reasonable mouthfeel but an otherwise unenjoyable drinking experience. I found myself trying to down it before it got warmer, as I could tell that the unpleasant flavors were getting stronger as the glass warmed up, yet at the same time I wasn't inclined to finish the beer at all. I'm very open minded with beer and have rarely found a craft beer that I legitimately didn't want to finish, but this had to be as close as I've come.

Smell: like fresh bread, sweet caramel malts, theres also a thick earthy scent, with fruits..beets? its pretty complex.  Taste: Interesting. Smooth, semi-sweet, bittertaste follows a somewhat faint malty flavor. The first thing that's kind of surprising is the thinness of it..not expected. Has almost a tea consistency.  Mouthfeel: very thin, it's a little watery in my opinion and has an unusual almost dark coffee like short-lived aftertaste.

Taste: Really sweet with some maltiness and even a bit of sweet fruits off the bat that turns to a woody and nutty aftertaste that tastes almost burnt.

A small cap of head and ring sticks around for about half an hour, but it took me twice that amount of time to drink the beer, so the latter half had little retention to speak of. I'm knocking the score up a bit for the gorgeous hues this ale displays. S: Sweet and malty. The candied toasted sugar is very prominent in the aroma. A bit of woodiness gives me the sense that this beer is barrel aged, but I don't think it is. Dark fruit and berry esters. This sure smells like a Belgian dark. T: Really sweet, and that's the only thing I can think of for a while. Candied sugar dominates, making it hard for much else to come through at first. Cherry and other pitted or stone fruits. Raisin reminds me of (and makes me crave) Raison D'Extra. There's a burnt sense, and the last note is a mix between fruity and metallic. The metal seems to dominate the back of my mouth until the beer warms substantially. A lot of other reviewers have noted the big presence of alcohol, but I'm not getting any notable heat in this beer. M: Medium body and syrupy consistency. The carbonation is higher, but the only way it really affects the beer is by bringing out the berries in the flavor, making them ""zing"" (for lack of better word?) just a bit more. D: Like I said, I cradled this one for a while. The sweetness was overwhelming in moments. I would suggest letting it warm substantially (30-45 minutes after taking it out of the cooler or fridge).

Overall, the smell is not very powerful.  T - This is a very different kind of beer. The taste is complex and reinforces the smoky sweet malts noted in the smell. There are hints of some kind of fruitiness but fades into the aftertaste. A mild alcohol taste is also present but does not distract from the flavors.

Pretty sweet with a slight bitterness from the soffee aroma.  The taste is good, if not a little underwhelming. It's good, has well-balanced flavors and a nice complexity. I can't quite put my finger on it, but there's something not quite right. The flavors seem to muddle a little bit.  They definately got the mouthfeel right. The carbonation and body feel great and are quite refreshing.  Eh, I guess it's drinkable, but I'm just a little disappointed. The beer was a little underwhelming, but still good. I would like to give the beer another try, but I have other things higher on the list.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Belgian Dark Strong Ale,83
10099,1180,jdklks,2.63,"pours a deep amber/brown with a fizzy white head that retreats quickly into nothing but a thin ring around the glass. smells hoppy, malty, belgian yeasty. raisins, figs, and brown sugar are also present.  i dont drink a whole lot of belgian style beers, and this is perhaps why. they tend to taste badly. not terrible up front; sweet, and nothing else. hardly any complexity, just dullness. maybe some raisins through the middle. the finish is by far the worst part of the beer. an unpleasant burnt sugar flavor, made a little less unpleasant by the fact that it is simply dull. there is really nothing here to taste. my least favorite DFH beer ive tried.  mouthfeel is overly carbonated, but has a decent medium body. drinkability is damn near nil. i wouldn't buy it again, and i may drain pour this one, so as to be able to salvage my beer experience for the night.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Belgian Dark Strong Ale,83
10099,1180,cdpike,3.28,"Bottle poured into snifter.  Pours, as it says, ""a deep mahogany"" with modest foam that hangs around with just the slightest lace. Aromas are very thick of molasses and some alcohol sweetness with no discernible hop characteristics. The feel is pretty slick and very coating with barely enough carbonation to balance the heavy syrupy body. Flavor is very chewy with lots of molasses, brown sugar, and the SLIGHTEST bit of raisin (though if you weren't looking for it, it could be pretty hard to find). The finish has a very modest bitterness that is not really from hop character, but mostly from a roasted barley character. Above all, however, the lasting finish is really a continuation of the wave of thick chewy flavors from earlier. I guess I don't particularly perceive this as very complex, just big really and I have a very difficult time categorizing this as a Belgian strong dark ale. It's really more like, Dogfish Head strong dark ale. Overall, it's not as balanced as I would I like and it seems a bit heavy handed. It's great in many ways, and is definitely worth a try, but it's by no means among my favorites of this style.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Belgian Dark Strong Ale,83

10099,1180,HansBlix,3.9,"12 oz bottle into a pint Glass  Appearance - This beer yielded a two finger head that dissipated to a 1/2 finger head with a respectable amount of lacing. Minimal carbonation. The color was an amber, almost red color that got some attention from the people around me.  Smell - Roasted Malt is on the top of the list followed by fruit (raisins were detectable), carmel, and an undetermined spice, with hints of alcohol.  Taste - Malt is the backbone of this brew. Hints of dried fruit and alcohol soon followed. Had a ""dark"" quality to the taste that I enjoyed very much and the hints of dried fruit complemented this very well. The alcohol did come through on this a little bit, but for me was invited and almost expected from initial pour. At 8% they did well.  Mouthfeel - I enjoyed this aspect very much. It was almost thick, to be honest, for this beer, it was perfect, not to thin, yet not to thick. Light to medium carbonation, all in all, perfect for this brew.  Drinkability - I personally could drink this all day. Someone who I was with said that it was ""too dark"" to which I promptly replied ""you are a pussy"". Not everyone's cup of tea, but it sure was mine. I want another now thinking of it.  I enjoyed this beverage very much and to date is one of my favorites from DFH (thought I havent had many). There isn't too much they could improve with this beer, in a good way. If you like a strong, dark ale thats on the untraditional side, I would defiantly recommend this.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Belgian Dark Strong Ale,83
10099,1180,Reaper16,3.95,"12oz. bottle served into a tulip  Pours a burnt amber (nearly red) with perfect, translucent clarity. The white head was pretty freaking huge at first before dying down to a 1/2 finger ring after three minutes or so.  Brown sugar dominates the nose at first before giving way to raisins. Not the generic sort of dark fruit smell that you get in so many beers, but very specifically raisins. I get a quick whiff of port wine on occasion that I wish would come up more prominently to break up all of the sweetness.  A very interesting malt bomb... unlike any particular beer I've had before. Coffee, which I didn't get in the aroma, sort of blasts my palate on the front end. Raisins follow too, along with some fig. But the dark fruits don't make this a fruity beer by any means. Malty finish, and surprisingly dry at that. Kind of like tobacco. This is my kind of brown ale.  Mouthfeel seems fine. its in that medium body range that carries the flavors well without making itself noticeable. Myself, I'm not one to session brown ales (I know this is slotted as a BSDA but this is pretty damn Brown Ale-y to me. In fact, I'm rating this AS a brown ale) so the drinkability is just ok to me. I can see someone inhaling half a six pack though.  Yet another superbly crafted beer from Dogfish Head. This one isn't exactly exciting or anything, its just very well executed. If you like easy-drinking malt bombs, then this is a fine choice.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Belgian Dark Strong Ale,83

S: Roasted malts, a little bit of raisin.  T: Complex. Got better as I went. At first, alcohol flavor was very apparent as well as a slight iron-like flavor. It was not plesant. But after a few sips, those elements faded almost totally away to reveal a rich chewy maltiness, balanced by a subtle hop bitterness. The raisins come through, but very much in the background.  M: Medium to medium-heavy body. Not as thick or dense as I thought it might be. Finish leaves a bit on your palate - a little syrupy.  D: At 8%, watch out.

Taste: Malty flavor with a hint of fruit. Strong hint of alcohol at the finish. Sweet coffee aftertaste.  Mouthfeel: Medium to full bodied with almost a slick, oily texture. Minimal carbonation.  Drinkability: Because of the heavier nature of the beer and the high ABV, I wouldn't want more than 1 or 2 of these.  Overall: I'd rate it as a decent beer but not really representative of the style.

S- At first I got nothing off the nose... perhaps the beer was poured too cold... as the beer warmed, it opened-up to reveal sweet notes of malt, raisins, some vinous notes and a touch of unidentifiable spiciness.  T- Definite malt bomb. Sweet brown sugar, caramel malt and yellow raisins dominate the palate. Almost seems a touch mapley at times. Almost cloyingly sweet. Finishes with some alcohol booziness and nary a hint of hops.  M- Slightly oily, almost syrupy. I suppose this compliments the smell and taste quite well. Just the right amount of carbonation rounds out the mouthfeel.  D- Drinkable, yes. Could I have several in a session... probably not... the sweetness would get to me and become too much.

A Dark copper but translucent body under a one inch light brown head. Fine look.  S Dark Fruits, medium malt and no perceptible hops. 4.0  T Dark fruits and medium roast malt dominate. I realize that raisins were used in the brewing process but the taste comes across more like a Date (the fruit). Good taste.

Aromas of brown sugar, faint raisins, other faint dark fruits, yeast, and caramel malt are most noticeable. There is also a very slight roastiness present.  Nice sweet palate, again brown sugar, and caramel malt, sweet nuts, and again faint raisins. There are also some vanilla/milk chocolate flavors as the beer warms.  Medium body with medium carbonation, very sweet, yet diverse palate.  Not sure what to make of this brew.

10099,1180,Boofshavik,3.46,"Bottle from the local HEB, poured into a DFH glass.  Appearance: A nice amber color, pours well into the glass and builds to a decent 1.5 inch head which dissipates over the first minute or so to a central patch on the surface that sticks around a while.  Smell: Some higher alcohols (dark rum, solvent) are immediate in the nose with faint spice and some dark fruit.  Taste: The raisin character is there, along with other dark fruit but it's masked by the heat of the alcohol. The sweetness on the front of the tongue is welcome.  Mouthfeel: Slick but not heavy. Nice prickle of carbonation. Sticks to the tongue nicely as I think the style should.  Drinkability: This beer lets its 8% be known. It's something you'd have one or two of in an evening, but is a little heavy for more serious consumption.  Overall: There is something about Raison d'Etre that has always appealed to me.

But a fine one nonetheless.  Deep brown pour with a dirty white head with generous lacing, tone is doubtless mahogany as they describe it. smell is very discrete, some alcohol some incense. fruity, very belgian.  the taste is at first quite nice, sweet fruity blend maybe dominated by a sort of apricot-ish feel with an alcohol rear, but i was a bit saddened as it's hop-free at the end, seemed a bit watery or as though something was missing.

Hints of molasses touch the tastebuds as well as slightly fruity grape flavor. Taste of alcohol lingers in the aftertaste.  Has a slightly heavy, medium to full bodied brew, quite what comes to be expected from a stong Belgian Dark Ale. Not very carbonates and a little think on the tongue.

It smells of subtle roasted caramel malt, bittersweet chocolate, a little vinous essence, and a bit of bitter coffee. The taste is lightly roasted caramel malt, a tad chocolate candy-like, a bit of booze, dark fruit, and earthy hops. The carbonation is moderate, the body thick and viscous, with the booze well-integrated, and an off-dry sweet candy malt finish.

The taste is brown sugar, caramel, slight chocolate, overripe oxidized pears and almost a grape like fruitiness contrasted by the mildest of mild bitterness and a hint of spice.

The aroma is primarily dark fruits and a caramel malt sweetness. I also pick up some brandy notes in there.  The taste presents similar to the nose with some dark fruity and caramel malt sweetness and a bit of brandy. I also add the taste of raisin above and beyond the dark fruit, and it was more prominent with food, (smoked whitefish).  The mouthfeel was a bit weak to me.

AROMA: An extremely malty, sweet smell, with a slightly spicy rum or sweet/spicy ""alcohol"" smell like brandy or something.  FLAVOR: A definitely malt front note, with wonderfully smooth sweet caramel, date, and molasses notes. Also a a very noticeable flavor of grape or raisins, green raisins? This is not too sweet, but it is sweet, with little to no hop bitterness here.  PALATE: A medium bodied brew, that is pretty well balanced. No bitterness, no notes of alcohol, all about the sweet malts and fruit flavors.  MOUTH FEEL: A somewhat thick almost syrupy brew. This beer is extremely lightly carbonated, but is still rich and flavorful.  NOTES: The beer is a rich, creamy, lightly carbonated 8% ABV beer that I have to say I think would be best as a desert beer.

Taste: Caramel malt especially in the after-taste. Grapes, raisins and other pitted fruits. Not immensely complex. A little on the sweeter side  Mouthfeel: Average, nothing remarkable, but nothing that bothers me.  Drinkability: This beer is average for the style.

Tastes of dark malts right away, not burnt but nice, smooth and mildly rich. There is a heavy push of sugar as well, not over the top sweet but very complimentary to the taste. There is almost no bitterness, but there is just a shred of heat in the aftertaste.  Mouthfeel reminds me of flat soda. Thin and very little carbonation, this is not a bad thing but just caught me off guard a tad.  Drinkability is not great, but not bad. The ABV isn't too high so a couple could be in order.

The flavor is almost exactly like my first attempt at homebrewing a brown ale: slight suggestions of over-ripe bananas that turn to bolder flavors of sweeter brown sugars, followed by alcoholic phenols and a roasted cocoa finish. Mouthfeel is nothing special, but I wouldn't want it any more or less carbonated. Nitro might be interesting though and might fix the quickly dissipating head and add to the general richness surrounding the beer (maybe too much). Overall impression is that there's a lot going on, but I found it pretty damn enjoyable. I do agree though that it seems way more like a light-bodied wee heavy (with all the complex flavors) rather than a belgian strong dark ale.

The beer's not a total mess (I mean, I'm talking relative to other DFHs, not to macro sludge), but it's just not my thing.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Belgian Dark Strong Ale,83
10099,1180,rtratzlaff,2.51,"Raison d'etre ""Reason for being"" pours a deep ruby reddish color with a thin white head that sticks around and sticks to the glass here and there. The aromas are sticky sweet maltiness with dark fruit. There's not much spice in the nose. It seems a bit simple for a BSDA in the nose. The flavor is pretty much the same, not bad, but just lacking in complexity. No clove, no spice. Prunes are there in full force. A bittering in the finish with a slight hint at anise but nothing much more than a thought. Green raisins? Yeah. The mouthfeel is full and fluffy. To style, this beer falls far short; however, as a beer in general, its not bad. I would recommend this for someone with a thing for malt forward beers with a slight Belgian quality.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Belgian Dark Strong Ale,83
10099,1180,rapidsequence,3.03,"Poured from a 12oz out of the fridge, and allowed to warm.  Appearance: Light brown and clear with very little head. No lacing. Lots of tiny bubbles.  Smell: At first, nothing but a whiff of alcohol. As it warms, you get some sweetness and belgian yeasty smell. Not too impressive.  Taste: Its fine. Nothing bad or offputting really, but nothing fantastic. You can tell its supposed to be a belgian style. Its sweet with a little dark fruitiness and spice. Obvious alcohol there.  Mouthfeel: Bubbly and thin. Leaves much to be desired.  Drinkability: Its ok, I'll drink it if you give it to me. Far from great.  Not at all bad, but I expect more from DFH... They make some great stuff. Don't stop experimenting guys...",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Belgian Dark Strong Ale,83
10099,1180,marvin213,3.5,"A fuzzy fizz quickly fades to laces atop the liquid. I look at this beer and reaffirm my thoughts on DFH making some of the most homogenous beers. It's dark brown throughout the liquid. Without looking into the chemical explanation of why, the really thin layer of microscopic foam bubbles fill me with anticipation about this beer. I've set it before and hope to continue saying it: it looks like another good production from Dogfish Head.  Obviously I've read the label, but the smell is overwhelmingly beets and raisins. It smells like Thanksgiving. I certainly smell the burnt red maltiness characteristic of ambers. I smell a hint of the Belgian yeast, and I prefer its subtlety. Though it's not my favorite smelling beer (-0.5), it's a unique and distinguished aroma (+0.5).  The taste is predominately sugar. The carbonation and 8% ABV make it taste and feel like warm soda. It's like a brandy beer. Have this with an espresso ice cream or something. It's appropriate to serve this in a cognac glass. It's an odd taste. You do get the beets throughout and the sugar/raisins leave you lip-smacking. A fun over-the-top beer gone a wee bit over the top.  I said it's like soda and the mouthfeel is sugary sweet--it's good. That same quality--like soda--hurts drinkability. I know you're out there, but most of us don't like to chug multiple sodas.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Belgian Dark Strong Ale,83
10099,1180,Genuine,3.57,"Poured from a bottle into a pint glass  Had a 2 finger head, with very nice lacing that seemed to linger a while.  The smell was very figgy and sweet, I could tell that this was going to be a sweet beer. It was pleasant to the nose, though.  Taste - I could immediately pick up on the raisins/figgy taste, which seemed to dominate most of the flavor, along with the classic hops taste from Dogfish Head. Not too heavy and not light. A nice blend founded right in the middle.  Mouthfeel - I really enjoyed the carbonation of this beer and thought it helped with the taste of this one. A bit heavier than water.  Drinkability - I could definitely knock back a few. It's not heavy enough to not have more than one. Might be able to be a session beer.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Belgian Dark Strong Ale,83
10099,1180,stagger,3.8,"Received in a trade from MeisterBurger. Thanks!  A nice, unexciting but very quaffable belgian-style strong dark ale. Less head and lacing than I'd like, a funny (yet pleasing) mud-puddle brown colour to it. Taste is figgy, caramely, reminiscent of Trois Pistoles with all the KAPOW taken out (which is not necessarily a bad thing - I love that beer but it's sometimes a little in-your-face) - probably just a tad too subdued. Alcohol is present but adds to the taste rather than distracting from the experience. Low-carbonation, very more-ish. I'd pick up more of this anytime.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Belgian Dark Strong Ale,83
10099,1180,KBomb,3.55,"Poured into a tulip. Nice translucent copper brown with a small but persistent head. Brown sugar dominates the smell with a little bit of candied fruit in the background. At first sip both tart and sweet flavors mingle over the palette. Crisp green grape, brown sugar, and a hint of malt sweetness make a nice sweet profile. Yet the back of the tongue is picking up some ""off"" flavors, something metallic and medicinal. Feels a little ""dirty"". High alcohol content hides marvelously in here. If it weren't for some defect in flavor, it'd be highly drinkable.  I've got some moderate liking for this beer. The fruity sweetness makes for a great dessert beer. I've got to knock it a little bit for some miscues in the finish, but that didn't ruin the experience for me. I wouldn't turn down the opportunity to sip one of these again. It deserves a solid 'B'.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Belgian Dark Strong Ale,83

Really sweet, too much so - raisins, caramel, burnt sugar, the alcohol is ever present. Mouthfeel was flat, carbonation not good at all. First DFH beer and none too impressed.

The smell and taste both contain an unpleasant mixture of bell pepper like fresh flavor and dark ripe fruit. They both kind of fight for power, never blending together.  The mouthfeel is nice, medium bodied with just the right amount of carbonation.  This beer would be pretty drinkable, the alcohol is hidden well, the mouthfeel is very nice...but the taste and smell really just keep me from enjoying the experience as a whole.

Aroma is a bit of dried fruit and slight spice. The taste is an interestingly complex blend of dried fruit, dark malt and a hint of spice with a hint of sourness and a touch of dryness. The beer is medium bodied with a refreshing dryness.

Smells like you'd think a Raison x'xxxx might: like dark raisins, some malt, even a rum-like aroma is all up in my nostrils. This beer feels pretty well carbonated for a strong dark belgian but I'm still having a bit of trouble getting it down. It hits the tongue initially with some raisin and cherry even but the flavor soon dissipates briefly into alcohol tones and then into nothingness. Certainly not an awful beer or even a bad one.

I did like the beer and I was inclined to give am higher score, however compared to other beers in the same class this falls a little short. The beer has a smooth mouthfell but...the body is somehow thin and the taste is not as complex as the one you can get by beers in the same style. In some kind of way I would say its a thinner version of a good Belgian Strong Dark Ale.  I did enjoy the beer, and its also priced right.

Raisin and brown sugar scent, but a pretty noticeable malt smell. There is also a slightly pungent, almost sulfurous smell that I can't quite place.  Raisin-malt taste with a good dose of brown sugar. Bold malt body and a bit of hops. Not nearly the right balance to come off as a proper Belgian dark ale but too much of a raisin and sugar character to be a brown ale. I can even detect a milk chocolate hint.  Carbonation is initially a bit much, but it seems to ease off a bit. Nice, but not something I can get in to.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Belgian Dark Strong Ale,83

You get a whif of hops and some very nice toasty malts, but you really have to try. T- Very complex, I taste toasted malts, Belgian sugars and the hop flavor is mild. I guess the raisons are in there somewhere? My guess, the raisons are in the malty/sugary flavors? Very complex for me. M- Mildly carbonated. D- This is the best part.

The flavor upfront is dried fruits with some bitterness immediately. There is a moderate warming that tells you the alcohol is there. There is also some caramel and earthly hops in the flavor that become apparent as it warms up. Its a medium-heavy bodied beer that is a bit syrupy.

The finish tastes a lot like rum, with dark fruits running in and big boozy flavor. I would never have guessed the style of this beer based on the flavor; I would have gone with an English style of some sort, like an old ale.

10099,1180,thirdeye11,2.6,"Presentation: Poured from 12oz bottle into a thick 22oz pint-style glass.  A: Pours a deep brown color that has hints of rust and molasses. The beer has a nice 1 1/2 finger almost white head that disappears pretty quickly. Not much lacing in this one. The beer is also completely clear which for me Belgians should not be. No yeasty floaters either, also a detractor for me personally.  S: Smells like roasted malt, caramel, and molasses on the back. These are all very prominent. Verging on burnt toast smells in some cases. Fairly complex nose, but not necessarily in a great way. This may be the best aspect of the beer though.  T & M: Not EXACTLY what I expected from the nose, but close. The roasty malts are so in your face and dominate the flavor profile almost completely. There is some caramel and molasses sweetness, but without any real weight to them. Taste doesn't match the mouthfeel as it feels like it should be thicker in body. Doesn't really coat my mouth as I'd like. No creaminess either which is a huge detractor in this heavy on flavor beer. Not complex either which most Belgians are.  D: I felt myself wanting to drink this less and less as it warmed up which is converse to almost every Belgian beer I've ever had. I couldn't finish but about 60% of it. I have 4 left at home too so they will probably be drank over time.  Not a good example of a Belgian at all, and this beer says it is brewed with green raisins but I don't taste it at all. Unbalanced, hard to drink, and not recommended unless you just like to try ""new"" things. For that reason you may want to check it out.

Its best VERY cold...but is a very unique beer, and definitely one of my all time favorites.  I would say though...that you probably need to develope a bit of a taste for it...it doesn't usually come right out as a smash hit on the first try.

10099,1180,Atlas1,3.9,"Perhaps this entry was inspired by the Beer Wars movie I watched last night. Either way, it's one of the few DFH beers I can get regularly that I haven't reviewed yet.  Poured into belgian snifter, the Raison D'etre is a pretty beer. Hues of mahogany and orange beneath a bubbly head of off-white that dissipates a bit over time. Some lace. The nose is multi-layered with raisins, fig, candied apple, bread pudding, and other aromas less discernible. Taste is nice, but a bit funkier than the smell. Sweet malts are strong, and there are some dulled-down dark fruit flavors. Again, bready. But there is also a strange metallic kick in the finish that detracts a bit. Not enough to really bother me, but it's noticeable. Not sure where that comes from, because it doesn't remind me of hops. Mouthfeel is firm and just fine until the very end, where that metallic twinge hits.  On the whole, this beer is just fine with me. Complex, but not too busy. Not great, for sure, and I would rather have any number of DFH beers over this one, but this is a good beer. I revisit this one once or twice a year, and I don't see that changing. Not a great example of a Belgian Strong Ale, in my opinion, but a good enough beer to drink.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Belgian Dark Strong Ale,83

Really minor changes.]  A - The color of this beer is a beautiful amber brown that's totally clear. It's too bad the beautiful beer isn't topped with a good head. A vigorous pour released only half a finger of off-white foam with poor retention and no lace.  S - Toasted and roasted malts make up the majority of this aroma. Hints of chocolate and caramel within. A little bit of candi sugar gives the aroma a sweetness while the hops add a low grassy nose. A bit of black cherry and raisin fruitiness too.  T - Toasted malts give off a bread-like biscuitiness with caramel malts and sweetness. A subtle cocoa neutrality is there with raisins and black cherries. The beet sugar adds both sweetness and earthy flavor that's accented by dry, grassy hops.  M - This is a smooth, rich ale that's near full-bodied but held back by a higher level of carbonation that jumps all over your tongue. The finish is sweet and dry.  D - The alcohol is no where to be found in flavor or nose making it pretty easily drinkable. The flavor and sweetness get slightly cloying though. Great overall. Another DFH success.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Belgian Dark Strong Ale,83

A slightly sweet malt aroma without any outstanding notes. A slight fruit taste floats over the malt background, leaving a hint of sweetness on the back of the tongue.  The body is a little thinner than expected, but enjoyable nonetheless. Average drinkability, you could drink a couple of these in a row, I'm just not sure you'd want to. This beer is sort of boring and uninteresting. I'm not sure what the brewers were aiming for with this beer and I'm not sure this is the proper style category either.

Taste is somewhat muted compared to the aroma. Raisins, malt, and yeast, but it all seemed somewhat flat tasting compared to what the aroma led me to anticipate.  Mouthfeel was smooth, yet very thin. Decent amount of carbonation. Would have liked more body in this.  This was an interesting brew, yet I can't say it made me want another.

Smell is of dark fruits. It does have a heavy raisin smell and little bit of plum. I couldn't detect the beets they were speaking of but I did smell the molasses.  Taste is the same as the nose.A great taste of rich malts is immediate. A little resiny and oily. A nice sting of hops in the aftertaste along with a mix of a nice dark fruit taste.  Mouth is medium bodied with great carbonation. Very smooth and very slick a little stickey also.  Drink is exceptional for me.

Looks really beautiful in the glass, an amber color, like buckwheat honey, only brighter.  It's sweet and bitter and alcoholic. As others have noted, there's a honey flavor--it's the most noticable grace note to me.  I get cinnamon and cloves and maybe peppermint. Very strange in a ""beer.""  There are similarities to the experience I have had drinking the fruity Belgians.  The alcohol is strong. Not likely to want to drive after even one bottle at least not for an hour.

The nose is roasted caramel malt, coriander and other spices; hickory smoke.  Spices overwhelm the palate... way too many spices for me. Honey, and caramel are also present. The caramel is very nice and almost makes up for the spice explosion.  The mouthfeel is thick, with heavy carbonation. The overpowering coriander flavor really hurts drinkability for me. It's just too much. To be honest, I could only deal with about 6 oz, before pawning the rest off on my friend.  I also had this on tap at the Falls Church ""Alehouse"" last summer. I remember it tasting much different than this. It had a much more assertive caramel malt presence. I really enjoyed it then, which is why I wanted to try it again.

On top, a two-finger caramel head that leaves decent lacing. This is a beautiful presentation.  Aroma: Slightly sweet and smoky deep-roasted malt dominates. It's accompanied by whiffs of dark fruit and a nice kick of booze in the back.  Taste: Roasty, smoky, and nutty malt with dark fruit and dark chocolate notes throughout. It's balanced with a good helping of bitterness in the end. Assertive alcohol compliments everything. The aftertaste is intense and roasty.  Mouthfeel: Medium-full bodied with moderately-low carbonation. You can certainly feel the alcohol in your throat a bit. A nice dry finish.  Drinkability: With a good dose of alcohol and a complex profile, this is in the fast part of sipper territory.  Verdict: Another solid and unique offering from Dogfish Head.

Nothing to brag about, the nose needs to step up a bit  T: the taste holds brown sugar crusted malts with some butter rum raisins. Light spicy notes clean the sweetness up and hold a dry character. After giving a few seconds to let my tongue analyze other flavors, I gather a weak earthy toasted caramel soaked coffee bean or two. The sweetness has a Belgian feel, but leaves some room for improvement. Seems that most of the flavors are lost amongst dry alcohol notes popping through  M: medium body with ample carbonation.

According to the stamp on the neck of the bottle it was bottled on 7/23/08. So it has a bit of age on it. Poured into a standard pint glass.  A: Pours a dark copper like color with a thin off-white head that dissolves away relatively quickly. There is no lacing at all that I can see.  S: There is a dark malt aroma mixed in with some other kind of sweetness that I can't put my finger on. It isn't a terribly interesting aroma, but its smells OK.  T: Luckily the taste is more interesting than the appearance or aroma. Its doesn't make me say wow, but it does have an interesting flavor. It is definitely on the malty side. The initial flavor is sweet from all that malt. It continues on with dark fruit tastes, specifically raisins, which make sense due to the name. The finish has a bit of an odd chalkiness to me.  M: A little bit a tingling from the in mouth carbonation. Its medium in body.  D: I want to drink it a little faster than I normally would due to the chalky aftertaste.

D - slim to none IMO.  OK, I know that Belgian Strong Dark Ale is a broad category with lots of variation, but this seems like a weak entry in the field.

S: Very vinous and raisin aroma with a bit of brown sugar and leafy hops  T: Distinctive flavors that don't mix very well. Act 1 is very candy sweet, act 2 is vinous and grapey, and act 3 is leafy, earthy hops. Unfortunately, melding these three flavor components is not accomplished with much deft. Warming makes the alcohol presence a bit heavier but by no means overwhelming. The bitterness is low overall.  M: Reasonable in body with a silky initial feel and carbonation is medium-high. Aftertaste is grapes and earthy, spicy hops.  D: Not the most easy to drink due to the blocky flavor composition. I'm going to cellar some and see how it turns out since the fresh version doesn't do much for me.  Addendum: Cellared for a year, this is much smoother and more cohesive.

10099,1180,Brenden,3.97,"The color is brown but when held to the light is a clear coppery red. An off-white head pours nicely, settling within a couple of minutes. Carbonation dances and lacing clings a little but drops later.  The sweetness is up front in the smell, and it's backed up by malt (which further enhances the sweet aspect). To round it out, there's an herbal smell I can detect and not citrus but fruit (I'm assuming the green raisin).  The taste is interesting; the malt is more up front than the sweetness, which comes in as more of a helper than a competitor. There's a smokiness to it that I didn't detect in the smell, but that's more in the background and the finish. Some sort of sugars contribute (beet sugars, I suppose?) apart from the natural malt sweetness. It tastes like a good brew to me.  I'd say this is medium to full-bodied; it feels pretty thick. It's also smooth and the carbonation is that nice balance of lively but not overbearing.  Note: given its high ABV, I was pleasantly surprised to feel that nice warm feeling afterward without having been kicked in the face with it. However they figured that out, well done.  This is a very pleasant brew. I've seen reviews saying it's too sweet or sticky, but I wasn't hit with that at all. Maybe the way it was stored?

Never would I have assumed this was a belgian dark (I dont even like Belgian darks! Ever!!) I know Dogfish says they used Belgian-style yeast, but, again, I would say this is more of a sweet hybrid-brown ale or something... Anyway.. The appearance is a beautiful ruby, almost burgundy when light passes through it reminiscent of the beet sugar in the ingredients (not that I know if a beet's sugar is the same color as a beet).. The aroma is bit of a weak point, its definitely nice with malt and a bit raisiny with a presence from the grapes used, but its sort of subdued and would be nicer if a bit more prominent. The taste has a lot of malt but, like aroma, in a more subdued way.. It doesn't have a huge presence like a doppelbock or Dogfish's Palo Santo or such, but thats sort of nice for this beer, giving it a bit more drinkability in a social setting. There is brown sugar in the taste and a bit of dryness in the clean aftertaste. Mouthfeel is really nicely balanced, a lighter moderate with carbonation thats not biting.

Pours out a nice mahogany, minimal head. Smells very sweet and sugary, laced with alcohol and some raisin notes in there.  Tastes...sweet. That's the first impression, like a Belgian triple on steroids. Almost overpowering. After your tastebuds calm down some, you start to taste the raisin, a bit of hops that aren'd drowned out by the sugar. And the whole thing ends on a slightly sour note that may or may not work, depending on your palate.  The sugar sticks with you in the mouth, making me wish for some water to cleanse the palate. Given the sweetness and the high ABV, this is a one-drink maximum, and drinkability is an issue.  Overall, it seems Dogfish Head wanted to apply the extreme brewing philosophy to Belgian-style beers.

Smells incredibly yeasty, a bit of malt and sugar on the back of the news, but the belgian yeast strain overpowers.  Has a strong raisiny sweetness about it, but the wrong body type for that sweetness in my opinion. The strong raisiny sensation doesn't really have any balance. By the end, it has turned into a slightly sour raisiny flavor, and not sour in a real good way. Like an ascetic burnt bitterness. There doesn't seem to be much of a step B between steps A and C. Mouth is hugely cloying and coating, but there really isn't much carbonation to move things along, which in this case would help bigtime.

Funny, I've described this in other beers in a positive light, but for this one, it isn't cutting it for me.  A mouth coater for sure. The alcohol helps clear the palate, but not enough.  This was the second time I've had this, and on both occasions I bought the single beer. Glad I didn't shoot a pile of money on a six. This is a one and done at best. Even on a bitter cold day I'd have trouble getting more than one down (even one complete one down). Did not like this at all. Lots of good things going for it, but the complete picture is not there.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Belgian Dark Strong Ale,83

Very little in the way of hops in this.  M: thin and flat, no carbonation period  D: well its a sipper if you can stand it, I got 3 left and it hard to get it down.  I hate to review this because I hate to do negative reviews, but someone must like it, but as much as I love Belgian beers, and the American attempts at Belgians this one is a loser period.  glad the folks at publix did not have this one in the computer and she only charged me 7 bucks for the 6 pack so I can live with it.

Definitely a little thicker on the mouthfeel. Strong nutty/sugary malty tones, and the booze (8.0%ABV) definitely shows through a little at end -- but just fine with me.

Body is crystal clear dark bourbon amber that's virtually still. Nice package!  Nice dark fruit renders usual Ringwood earthiness neutral - good raisin and dark malt texture with nice burnt caramel. Hop grass is well-represented  Oooh, I like this more than the usual DFH suspects. The earth of the Ringwood strain is still there but the big raisins and mild oaky booze neutralize it nicely. Deep caramel/molasses/brown sugar sweetness with only a hint of booze burn. Well-done.  I'm digging the palate on this one. Nice heat that's blended well with malt and brown sugar sweetness.

A: aggressive pour yields 2/3 finger of off-white head which quickly subsides to a ring of thick lace. Clear dark brownish-red (mahogany as the bottle claims - I stand corrected). S: Sweet and fruity, raisiny, red wine-iness comes through, though this is definitely beer as it has a strong malt character, roastiness and spicy hops. T: A sweet flavor up front with an off, flavor blocking presence in the center of my tongue (wacky and tannic). Kind of bitter, some cooked veggie DMS apparent. M: Too carbonated. Bright but syrupy, Tannic bitterness at end. D: Not good. I'm struggling to get through this one.

Unfortunately this one doesn't hold a candle to 90minute.  Pours a golden red color with a one finger head. I can almost smell a grape popsicle. Theres little to no carbonation in this one. I'm having trouble pinpointing the flavors here. I can taste a grape flavor like it smells but after that nothing really stands out. Not much sweetness and not much bitterness. This is a pretty uneventful one in my book. On a positive note, the 8% abv is well hidden and the beer is actually pretty easy to drink.  Overall, not one i would recommend or even try again myself. I was slightly disappointed. I should have gone with the 60 minute from DFH.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Belgian Dark Strong Ale,83
10099,1180,fingerlaker,3.09,"Overall disappointing. Not terrible, but not great.  I poured it into a goblet, the dark liquid swirled around and left a good head that stayed for a while... tells me that this is a rather active brew. Look is quite nice.  Smell is sweet, of good malt, raisons, and a bit of... mango? Hard to tell. The smell was quite nice.  Taste was... underwhelming. The malt was balanced nice with the hops and there was a definite raison taste but what the hell was that metallic aftertaste about? We're talking SERIOUS metal flavor. The 8% alcohol warmed nicely and added a sophisticated grown-up feeling to the end. But that metal flavor! WHere did it come from? Terrible!  In the end, this beer is a letdown... nothing terrible, but I wanted more.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Belgian Dark Strong Ale,83
10099,1180,unitas3,2.68,"Poured a deep amber body with no surprises. On the nose it was a bit sweet, the beet sugar and the raisin scent was a bit reminiscing yet seemed to be over powered by a pure sugar and alcohol front. The taste was not as pleasing as expected. The alcohol dominated with little or no balance on the finish, after warming up a bit the taste seemed to separate and oil out with a heavy to thick syrup body. Dried fruit was present but the alcohol was still to forward to allow a good harmony. I could see pairing this with a meal, maybe even braising a piece of meat with it furthering its unique crafting.

The color is very nice. The smell is of sweet candi and caramel. The flavor, to say the least, has variety, depth and complexity. I enjoyed the different parts; the dried fruit - sweet and a little tart. It felt smooth at first and sticky in the end. The 4 pack will take me a few weeks I would guess, not something I really am craving after having one. So I gave it kinda a low score on drinkability.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Belgian Dark Strong Ale,83
10099,1180,JerzDevl2000,4,"Picked this up a few weeks back up in Totowa. This looked interesting and I don't think I've ever had a beer like this before. Even though it's listed as a Belgian Strong Dark Ale and it's at 8.00% ABV, this almost has the feel and taste of a brown ale. It's not heavy, complex, and the alcohol is well-hidden. Needless to say, the sweetness of this beer works pretty well!  I liked the hue of this - a nice deep mahagony just like the bottle said, but not dark enough that I couldn't see through it. There could have been a bit more head and some lacing, but the taste of this is mellow and easygoing. Sweetness dominates with the taste of grape and caramel underneath to tie the maltiness together. This is not bitter or strong by any stretch of the imagination! There's a slight sense of roastiness to this, but not enough to have a warming effect.  As stated above, the ABV% seems to be a bit lower than what's on the bottle. No matter, I don't get the impression that this is a belgian-style beer, but it's a welcome change from Dogfish Head's other peculiar and hoppier offerings. For a late winter night like this, this fits the bill quite nicely!",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Belgian Dark Strong Ale,83
10099,1180,Gosox8787,3.65,"Poured from a bottle in my beer drinking glass. The beer was a dark brown, mahogany color with only a slight beige lacing that had little retention. The aroma is dominated by the smell of the malt. There is also a sweet note that offers a nice contrast. The taste is highlighted by the interplaying flavors of the malt and the sweet notes from the grapes. The moutfeel is average, with only a slight amount of carbonation. The beer is acually drinkable considering the ABV. The alcohol does not overpower the beer at all.  Overall, this is a decent beer to try but is not worh going far out of the way to try. Another good beer from Dogfish Head.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Belgian Dark Strong Ale,83
10099,1180,Florida9,3.28,"Red-tinged, medium brown color. Not much head, but what is there is thick with a lot of lacing.  Smells heavily of malt. Also yeast.  Flavor is a sweet maltiness with notes of raisin (imagine that!) and plums. Sweetness is overpowering and, in my opinion, throws the beer out of balance. Relatively quick, clean finish.  Beer has a medium viscosity.  Couldn't see buying this beer again. Admittedly, it's not my preferred style and I think the this is a fine beer, but the sweetness is just too much. I'd have a difficult time drinking more than one of these in a sitting.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Belgian Dark Strong Ale,83

10099,1180,becktone,3.81,"From notes 12-4-08  Eye: Nice looking brew as it is poured into the glass. Color is a rusty brown and the brew is pretty clear. When light passes through it the beer turns a beautiful red tinged with orange and yellow highlights. Head is a creamy looking thing that has real nice formation and retention. Lacing is real nice forming rings round the glass connected by sheets of lacing.  Nose: Dark candied malts, dark fruit-raisins and prunes. Some notes from alcohol also come through, a warm spicy type of aroma from alcohol. No hops present, or at least detectable. Nice aroma overall, but I think that it could be a bit stronger and have a little more depth...it would just make it better.  Tongue: Some toasty flavors and some slight almost coffee/cacao flavors are in here, but I'd describe them as very light and not quite typical of that description. Usually, as in stouts or porters, those flavors are pretty heavy, this is just a hinting at them, just slightly there, accented by some alcohol notes. Overall big malt sweetness in this brew. Raisin character along with other dark fruits are present. Some nuttiness and caramel as well. The beer is balanced and not overly sweet, its the darker malts though that balance it out with their toastiness. Overall the beer tastes good, its just that there really isn't much here in the way of complexity. Alcohol is hidden pretty well, that and what is preceived works well with the rest of the brew to add to its flavor.  Feel and Drinkability: The beer leaves the tongue feeling thick and heavy, almost the way the palate feels when parched. Carbonation is low and suits the beer. Hints at a warming sensation when swallowed. This beer is full bodied and leaning towards thick on the palate, I feel like alot of residual sugar gives it this feeling....it does however work for the beer. This one is easy to drink, however, I'm not sure how readily I'd pick it up again. I'm sure I'll eventually be buying this and drinking it again, but I can't see myself doing it anytime soon. It's a good beer but nothing all that great. Don't get me wrong, its great, but for me it just doesn't have anything that pulls me back tot the beer, nothing that I truely love about it.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Belgian Dark Strong Ale,83

Sweetness lingers on the tongue. M - Lively carbonation. D - The sweetness makes it a little tough to take too many in a row without some kind of break.  It's nice. I like to keep it around.

Tastes of sugar dipped raisins (and other dark fruits) with toffee and candy sugar. Definitely a sweet beer. The Belgian yeast appears somewhere in the middle, adding a nice element to it.

No lace, very short lived head.  S - caramel, light carob, raisiny fruitiness, a light waft of alcohol. Interesting.  T - molasses, lightly roasted malts, quite sweet in terms of malts and fruits.

Carbonation complemented it nicely. A bit chewy too.  D - very good. No complaints here.  Overall - I thought this was some sort of dark amber ale with a lot of malts and raisins. The balance seemed a little off centered, but then again, this is made by an off centered brewery for off centered people. Then I found out that it's a Belgian strong dark ale... hmm, I don't think this one fits the bill. Sorry DFH, although this was tasty, I really can't see this fitting into the category.

10099,1180,TehAnkh,3.62,"I'm drinking this beer as I'm writing this review. I bought a sixer and I'm about 3 beers in (obviously it's drinkable enough).  A: Pours with a 2 finger medium tan head that recedes quickly to fine layer of bubbles. Dark red/amber color, very woody-brown/red and crystal clear. A few stray bubbles rise from the bottom. Leaves a nice lacing that seems to cling to the glass nicely.  S: The alcohol really comes through on the nose, but there are lots of nice subtle hints of fruits, brown sugar, a little pear and raisin, and perhaps a bit of a woody scent coming through. Lovely, but mild.  T: Woah! The alcohol bites you in the boo-boo on the first sip! But I'm not entirely sure if this is a bad thing, as it seems to work very well with the brown sugar coated raisin taste on the back end. Lots of fruity and malty notes. I like it.  M: Nice, medium body. Definitely not too thin or too thick for my tastes. Just a touch of bitterness, mild carbonation, pretty refreshing, albeit a ""sipper"". Glides right over my tongue with absolute ease, quite enjoyable.  D: I'm on my 3rd one of these as we speak, and I would not be surprised if I moved on to a 4th. Quite drinkable, and although the alcohol stands out it doesn't seem to deter me from wanting to crack another one open.  Overall a pretty good brew, I've had several of DFH's other offerings and don't think I'll be shelling out 12 bucks for a 6 pack of this ever again, but I'm not disappointed in my purchase. I will be gladly finishing off the 6 pack tonight. Pretty average, while the belgian sugars are obvious in the flavor, it just is not what I would expect from a belgian style ale.

A malty, slightly fruity aroma lightly brushes the nose, with some notes of raisins pushing through.  The medium-full, minimally-carbonated body washes caramel malt flavor across the front of the tongue, with waves of sugary sweetness in tow, filling itself out with raisin and fig notes and a foundation of roasty chocolate. Drains away with an excessively sweet flavor that coats the back of the tongue and lingers for a long while after the finish. A bit of herbaceousness appears somewhere in the middle and keeps the brew from being overly cloying, but the finish is perhaps a bit too much.  This one drinks rather easily, and is really quite tasty, but the 8% ABV sneaks up and sets heavy on the head without much warning. Alcohol presence is very well-hidden.

T: The taste is malty up front with sweet flavors of raisins, chocolate and caramel. There's a mild background of Belgian yeast and spices. The malt character is hearty and there's a decent hops presence all creating a good balance. The after-taste is slightly sweet.

I have bought this beer a number of times, and my comments are about a beer I find to be tasty and enjoyable, rather than how it deviates from Belgian ales such as Chimay Blue Label. It would be very difficult for me to write that type of a review, as I don't really perceive this beer to be similar at all.  This beer poured a medium, clear amber color, with good carbonation and a creamy white head. The smell does not give you much of a clue as to what to expect. Once I took a sip, I get the impression of a beer that is not very hoppy, but rather hints more of fruit such as raisins or cherries. That said, it is not strongly sweet, but does have a hint of alcohol heat behind the fruit.  I find the different flavors to be harmonious and to balance each other out, and could happily drink more than the 2 I limit myself to on any single evening, due to the substantial ABV.

A very clean brew as there is not much, if any sediment. A 1/2 inch head comes through then disappears leaving a slice of off-white head. A whole lot of rising bubbles.  S- A good smell consisting of a lot of sugars (including brown) and caramel. Roasted malts with some syrups maybe. Under that the raisin shows up with a layer of yeast also creating an earthy scent.  T- The raisin is apparent and sugars are up front creating a sweet assault on the mouth before leaving. After that some smoky qualities arise while some dark fruits and a dash of coffee and even less chocolate. The caramel and roasted malt stays throughout each swig with some alcohol presence. Overall, this really isn't my thing with the set of ingredients chosen, leaning towards the yeast.  M- Reminds me of a smooth bock. Not as thick on the mouth as some DFH offerings but leaves it's mark. A nice bit of carb going for this as well. A bit of a hassle to get through. Not a pleasing aftertaste.  D- Not my favorite DFH offering honestly & i love their experimentation but not this one.. I had trouble with even this 12oz serving.

More in the nose would be nice. But deceptively smooth and drinkable for a relatively big beer.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Belgian Dark Strong Ale,83
10099,1180,droomyster,3.47,"Pours a clear mahogany with an off-white head. Smell is not attractive: noes of sweet malts and an almost locker-room scent that is a bit startling. Taste, on the other hand, is pretty good: brown sugar and toffee maltiness with a woodsy bitterness. Medium body is spot on the money. An interesting beer whose aromas are incongruous with its taste.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Belgian Dark Strong Ale,83
10099,1180,erikm25,3.77,A: Pours a solid crispy brown. Maybe the slightest hint of dark amber tinting but overall mahogany as the bottle states. The head was minimal. Lacing and retention could have been better especially after an aggressive pour.  S: Definitely has some strong caramel hints. Hints of raisin and plums. Brown sugar sweetness in the back. Little tinge of alcohol but nothing overwhelming.  T: Caramel taste at the front though relatively light. Dark ripe raisins and dry roasted malts with a sharpened sugar finish. Pinch of buttery toffee. I picked up on a very subtle coffee taste with hints of chocolate. The nose and the taste almost match up perfectly. Not very complex but still very straight forward and nice.  M: Mouth feel is decent though a little more thin. Low carbonation.  D: Grabbed this on a whim for about $2.50 for a 12oz. I had once before and remember liking it a little more. A solid offering but DFH has many other offerings I would try again over this one. Figured it was a historic day thus making it as good of a day as any to have a beer.,Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Belgian Dark Strong Ale,83

The head dissipates into a patchy layer on top leaving almost no lacing.  Smells of caramel malt with hints of brown sugar. The alcohol becomes more noticeable as the beer warms, but it's never overpowering.  Tastes good. More caramel malt kicks things off, then brown sugar and light raisin flavors join in. I'm not 100% sure what green raisins are supposed to taste like, but the raisin flavors I get taste a lot like normal dark raisins. A solid bitter ending sends the sip off.  Mouthfeel is good. It's a bit on the thin side, but the carbonation is good and it goes down pretty smoothly.  Drinkability is good. The ABV is well-hidden in my opinion, and the flavors are interesting enough to keep enticing me to take another sip.  Overall this is an interesting beer, but it doesn't do a whole lot to excite me.

Medium-bodied, sweet and sugary with rum raisin, plum, molasses and candied orange flavors. Heavy, not in a pure weight sense per se, just clings like syrup.

10099,1180,Bootscraper,3.73,"This is my second Dogfish Head type that I have had the privilege of enjoying.The first was their pumpkin ale, which I can say is up there as one of the creamiest beers I have had. Whenever this brewery ever got mentioned at another forum, someone in particular always raved about this brew. So, I thought it was about time I reviewed one. Served between 45 and 50 degrees F in my trusty pint glass, listening to Nachtmystium's ""Instinct:Decay"". First things first... the off-white, bubbly head got up to about 2cm, settled to 1 cm after a couple minutes, a very thin layer after 5 mins, and nothing when I got to the bottom of my glass. However, this was the result of a vigorous pour, so my opinion is not stellar. The color was a very deep bronze/rust color in the shade, and a dark brownish red when held up to light. The lacing (when it was around) fell very slowly, but was quite minimal and patchy. The last beer I reviewed was a belgian style very similar to this one, and shared some of the same rum-soaked fruit scents. This, however, was much more mellow and quite subtle. In many reviews I have read, people claim this beer is a bit too alcoholic in flavor. I don't see it though. Yes, the warmth is certainly here, but it seems to be disguised by an indistinguishable pallet (to me, anyways) of dark fruit. The taste started off as a crisp, refreshing sweet (I would say like soda, but again... ""mellow"" is the name of the game here) that was overcome by the signature darker fruits and slight spiciness towards the finish. However, I want to say that somewhere in there I acutely detected something ""brighter"", more along the lines of Banana. Throughout the duration of each sip there was also both roasted and slight brown sugar flavors. Tiny bit of bitterness, not too bad though. very rich... I can actually see how this may be an acquired taste. I like the stickiness of this beer. It wasn't too much where it leaves the candy-like syrupy feeling in back of your throat lingering for too long, but was still enough to please me. It also was not too heavily bodied, which means that even though the flavor is pretty unique, it doesn't hurt the overall drinkability too badly. Can't wait to have something else by this brewery in the future.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Belgian Dark Strong Ale,83

Smell: Dark fruit, raisin, some malt, and a bit of some plum as well.  Taste: Although an 8% ABV for this isn't much, you can still taste some nice esters in the finish which is quite inticing. This has a great malt profile, very sweet from the sugars, the raisin and spice is shown nicely, and it's pretty warming considering the maltiness and the alcohol. Tasty.  Mouthfeel: Pretty carbonated on the tongue, a off balanced body throws it in a couple different directions, malty and then bitter. It stays up well but gets wet quickly.  Drinkability: I found this beer to be a good winter choice with it's excellent warming properties, the raisins are in there shining and the dark fruit tinge is great.

Additionally, there are notes of brown sugar, and I really believe, tobacco.  The beer is more smoky than sweet, which makes it both a bit different than other strong dark ales and also a bit more interesting. As the beer warms, there are flavors of raisins and plums.

10099,1180,woemad,3.33,"12oz bottle purchased in Spokane at Huckleberry's for $1.89. Bottled-on date of 07/09/08 stamped on the neck.  Poured a mahogany color, with a good 1 1/2 inches of creamy, light tan foam. Lots of spotty lace.  Raisins, raisins, raisins in the nose. There's also a caramel sweetness and some vague, boozy notes, but the raisins are the stars of the show.  The taste isn't as complex as I had hoped for. The raisiny dark fruit flavor noted in the nose is matched with a caramel sweetness that is a little OTT. The flavors just don't meld together as well as they could.  Medium bodied. The mouthfeel, while not thick by any means, lacks that effervescence one expects from a Belgian-style beer. This is a problem I find in a lot of U.S. takes on Belgian beer styles.  This worked when used as a beer to take the edge off of digging countless people out of parking lots at work while being hectored by a frazzled, semi-worthless supervisor, and then not being able to buy ingredients for a planned dinner entree because the store I stopped at had a roof that was in danger of collapse due to no one clearing off the snow for three weeks (not that I'm venting).

Roasted malt, bitter coffee grounds, and an odd sweetness (not quite raisiny, maybe it's the beet sugar?). The odd sweetness and odd bitter coffee grounds do not work well together for me.

Very thin white head that dissipated quickly. A tiny bit of lacing was left. Some haze.  Smell: Maltiness, musk, raisins, and a definite sweetness I couldn't place.  Taste: First sip got some chocolate/coffee notes, which I definitely wasn't expecting. Balanced out by a heavy malt flavor, and a frutiness in the background. Raisins, maybe. After the first few sips, the flavors began to blend together. For an 8% APV, I didn't taste too much alcohol, but it left a very nice warming sensation going down. Leaves an aftertaste that's a mix of coffee and fruit. Lots of malt, and faint hops come through in the background. Almost like a fruity-bock beer is the best way I can think to describe it.  Mouthfeel: Highly carbonated, and felt thick, almost syrupy on the tongue.  Drinkability: It's an interesting beer. Definitely not a session beer, but it's a beer worth savoring every sip.

Small head formed that disappeared all to quickly but thankfully left a nice little ring around the glass.  The aroma is pretty yeasty and malty. The esters are here and fairly attentive. A nice toasty malt aroma backs up those esters.  The taste is a mixed bag. It surely tastes Belgiany (obviously) so there's a slick sweet malt flavor going on.

Smells very coffeeish. Notes of brown sugar. Smells quite good.  Pours a light brown into a dark brown body, minimal clarity through the darkness, mild head with milder retention. Looks pretty good.  Lots of dark roast malt on the palate. Dry roasted bread crusts and dark bread, semisweet-to-dark chocolate, strong heavy-roast coffee. Beneath lies a playful sweetness just shy of the threshold of being too sweet for me. Oily nuttiness similar to a nut brown kind of ale. Beneath all that is a dark, sour fruit similar to - strangely enough - raisins. (I know it says green raisins, but it feels more dark and ripe to me; given the sourness though, it could be more of a bright fruit character... all how you look at it I suppose.) Alcohol is invisible. Finishes a little sweet, a little oily. Tastes good. Feels good.  This is a malty beer. The layers of malt unfold continually displaying new flavors. It's well balanced and highly enjoyable. It's oddly similar to India Brown Ale (sans hop), perhaps in that they are both lovely brown ales on steroids.  3.4 4.2 4.0 4.0 4.4  03.01.07 2nd try.

S - Plenty of raisin, and some chocolate.  T - There's no mistaking the raisins, along with a big old, sweet, slightly smoky (to me) malt profile. This one is big on the malts. Cloves and other spices that would be contributed by an authentic Belgian yeast are absent...but I don't really want to judge this as a true Belgian Strong Dark.  F - More than almost any other beer I've tried, this one leaves a stickiness in my mouth, and makes me quite thirsty.  D - As I said, I've put a few of these back in my day. I'm good for one or two, and it works very well with food. If we're rating as a strict Belgian Strong Dark, it fails miserably, but I really just think DFH wanted to make a strong brown brewed with raisins and beet sugar. In that respect, it's a very good beer. If we're judging it against Chimay Blue or Gulden Draak, it's a failure.

The taste was a sharp mixture of hoppy and sweet, and the green raisins did not compromise the drinkability of the beer. As usual with Dogfish Head, the beer had a higher ABV content. In congruence with the light redness of the beer's color, the spices and woody structure of the beer did not disappoint, however the flavors were particularly abrasive.

Without that, it's almost more like a double bock.  Mouthfeel is nice and smooth, not overly carbonated, medium body, well balanced.  Drinkability is very good for a beer of this strength.  Overall, I would've been happier to say that it's an exceptional brown ale or even a really good bock but as a Belgian strong dark, it falls short. Still a very good beer.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Belgian Dark Strong Ale,83

10099,1180,Swann,3.68,"Appearance - Red Amber color. 1.5 inch head that held for about 2 minutes and laced around the glass as it came down.  Smell - Started off malty with hints of yeast and some wood. As the beer opened up smells of figs, white grapes, and alcohol over took the smell  Taste - Started off malty then a slight tart and acidity like that of a tart grape. Has a subtle rasin finish. Definate alcohol presence in the beer. The rasin finish seems to fade towards the end of the beer maybe due to the alcohol.  Mouthfeel - Medium carbonation. sticks to your mouth similar to how it laces on the glass. medium body overall.  Drinkability - Nice flavor and goes down smooth. I wouldn't want more than a couple of these though and probably wouldn't want to end a night of drinking to one one these due to the richness of the sugars. Maybe thats because of the belgian beet sugars used in the the beer but I'm not sure.  Overall I liked the beer. I might buy it again in the future but it will be up against the other Dogfish Head beers I'm a fan of and thats a tough line up!",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Belgian Dark Strong Ale,83

Tartness up front, sweet roasted malts follow. Nutty aftertaste I keep thinking there's a touch of coffee/chocolate.  Medium bodied, slightly sticky.

Now, I rather enjoy it and am eager to try aging it.  Deep red mahogany color with a very nice frothy head. Extreme lace and multicolored foam swirls; almost root beer float like, nice.  Very roasty aroma. Smells of roasted barley, maple syrup, sugar and raisins.  Sweet syrup, raisin, marzipan with only a hint of the roastiness that dominates the aroma.

Great 2 finger head, exceptionally pretty. Expectations are high.  S: Malty, yeasty, almost a bit of skunk. Nothing over the top. Hard to pin point anything.  T: Um...Another sip. Its good, enjoyable, but something about it is just not hitting the DFH spot. Tastes of malt, brown sugars, cant make out the raisins, or ""raisons"". Slight hop presence in the finish. Im trying real hard here...Really, almost nothing going on. The smoothness of this brew probably comes from the lack of flavor, almost a commercial brown ale on steroids and thats not saying much.  M: Carbonated... Almost too high. Mixture of the hop bitterness and carbonation seems to take a lot away from this already bare brew.  D: Had a few, hoping the second time around would be better. Still, nothing sticks out, very straight forward, nothing special.  O: Its good, but with a standard Sam sets with some of his other brews, this one barely makes the cut.

Smells of a light tartness, definatley from the green raisins, musky incense-like smokiness, malty sweetness. Not as spicy as a normal BSPA, more along the lines of a nice rich brown ale, or a Old ale-German Altbier if you will. Smells deliciously drinkable, but nothing Belgique really to be found, unless you want to simply consider the ingenuity of brewing with the ingredients used-whatever nature had at hand. Tastes of a nice spicy clove like peppers up front, tamarind sweet-tartness, raisin sweetness, followed by malts, ends with a long tingling throat-warming finish. Mouthfeel is very palate filling, but has a well balanced finish, I find highly drinkable and enjoyable. Maybe not a quote-on-quote BSPA, but when does Dogfish ever produce industry-standard beers?

Looks very ""Belgian"".  S - A combination of yeast and sweet background taste. Has a basis in its sweet candi sugar. The raisins are obvious.  T - Front end and mid finish are really fairly flat to me. The front end is sweet. Not much here for bitter balance. Finishes with a roasted finish. Sweet and strong. Surprisingly lacking in the phenolic notes that I would think would normally be associated with a beer like this.  M - Is quite thick with a pile of unfermentables. No carbonation impact on the mouthfeel. Coats nicely.  D - Potent and thick - it is at times swimming upstream to drink this beer. Not a bad thing however, as this beer that lends itself to slow enjoyment. This beer is not as drinkable as others, but I would not find it a chore whatsoever to drink one.

Smelled of very strong roast flavors. A hint of fruits is noticeable, but that toasted scent is very prevalent. It's like smelling a campfire. Taste followed with smell, which was surprising; I really expected to be overwhelmed with dark fruits and sweet malt like most dark ales, but this one was borderline like a Brown ale with its earthy tones and roasted flavors.  Overall, not a huge fan of the beer. It's very strong in what is there. The alcohol content isn't hidden very well - a bit acidic. It's not even a particularly good representation of the style.

This one doesn't have the dark chocolate bitter finish and has a very pronounced sweetness up front. You simply do not taste the alcohol in this one at all, even at 8% it is just not there.  Mouthfeel is great, not too strong of an aftertaste and as with all the DFH brews I've had carbonation is perfect. The body is just right and the heavy side of medium which I personally think is perfect for any dark ale.

10099,1180,biegaman,3.69,"This is my second time re-reviewing this beer and my impressions, notes and appreciation seem to change each time. My initial observation was a dark and flat mahogany coloured beer, something that strongly resembled coca-cola. My second bottle was full of carbonation and boast a thick, fluffy head.  The appearance in this one is somewhat grimy; its body is speckled with a murky toffee colouring and its slushy complexion makes it entirely intransparent. The light sparks small spatters of rose and orange. Its surface is barren, absent of any head.  The aroma is enticing and showcases both of the two ingredients boasted on its label: raisins and sugar. There is a soft but savory note of caramelizing brown sugar. The raisins seem accompanied by other dark fruits. The malt bill is quite befitting to integrate these two.  The mouthfeel and makeup is not all that akin to a Belgian strong dark ale, although its flavour profile is strikingly similar. Whether from the malts, the sugar, the raisins or some combination of the above the taste is chalk full of fruity esters, light phenols, plums, dates, and bready butterscotch. It all tastes pretty darn good.  This bottle, like some I've had previously, is under carbonated and runs a little close to being syrupy and drinks as a sort of phenolic, fruity nectar. Each time I try the beer I seem to enjoy this sugary, phenolic, bready, caramel laced tipple more and more. I've also found aging can have interesting (and beneficial) results.  Like most all of Dogfish Head beers this one is more ""off centered"" sounding than it is tasting. As far as strong dark ales go this wouldn't hold a candle to Belgium's best but it does make for an enjoyable drink, and I think that's enough 'raison d'etre' to keep buying and drinking it.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Belgian Dark Strong Ale,83

Deep, great looking coloring with amber and mahogany.  The scent is sweet and fruity, full of grape and peach. There is a slight hop aroma.  The taste is malty, but fades into the sweetness full of nutmeg, melon and grape. The hop flavor lingers throughout the entirety of the taste.  There is a slight fizz on the tongue. Solid body.

If you're not a fan of the Belgian style fruit beers than I would steer away from this one.  Not an everyday beer but I found it enjoyable as a treat for something different.

10099,1180,kinger,4.32,It took a while but after coming back to this beer a few times I have come to fully appreciate all that there is to offer. Pours a dark amber color with a brown tint. There is a thick head that eventually settles down and a few lingering spots of lacing that lazily attempt to cling to the glass. The aroma is a subtle mixture of dark fruits and sweet malts accompanied by a sugary afterthought. As I sip from my glass the flavor comes alive. Sugary and sweet there is a dominant malt presence that tangles all of the fruity and spicy flavors together followed by a nice warming alcohol effect. The mouthfeel is wonderful and the finish is exceptionally dry. Wow this beer reminds me of a good dopplebock but with a unique twist. Much better if you allow this one to warm up for a while. Absolutely amazing.,Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Belgian Dark Strong Ale,83

10099,1180,tbeck,3.7,"Poured a light reddish brown, a dark ruby in the light. A thin white head that that stayed around into a decent lacing. The aroma was a lot of malts with a hint of coffee. Taste was of coffee, malts and a hint of fruit. A little on the sweet side. Texture was good. Overall an enjoyable beer. I was a little leery about a beer with raisins in it. The balance was excellent, very smooth and not to heavy. A good session beer.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Belgian Dark Strong Ale,83
10099,1180,bluemoonswoon,3.27,"12oz bottle poured into a tulip glass.  A: Pours a wonderful looking stained cherry wood. That's as close as I think a beer has come in color to matching that of a piece of wood. The head is sort of that macro bubbly consitency and fades away into nothing in a matter of seconds really not what I was expecting even from this ABV level. Still the color is very nice.  S: Toasted almost burnt and smoked malt aroma, very strong in this department. This is backed by a mild blend of dark sugary fruits, most raisin, but not too shabby at all.  T/MF: Sort of an all encompasing kind of flavor. Very rich and powerful maltiness but really not very delicate in any department. I don't think I've approached something that could be labeled a malt bomb as I have with this beer, it really just wallops you over the head with sweet maltiness. Phenols are mild with a slight buttery apple. Really sort of one dimensional is almost every aspect, taste and mouthfeel wise.  D: There are far better beers in this category that exist. A rare misstep for DFH.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Belgian Dark Strong Ale,83
10099,1180,johnd513,3.23,My first review. Got this beer in a trade. Thanks JasonA. Your average strong dark ale this beer is not. This beer pours brownish read with a small head that disappears quickly. The smell is sweet raisins. The alcohol is very upfront as is the sweet taste. The drinkability for this beer is moderate. This beer is a slow sipper for me. Overall this beer is certainly worth a try for those looking for a different take on the style.,Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Belgian Dark Strong Ale,83
10099,1180,Godot,3.6,"Poured a rich mahogany color with good clarity when held to the light. A two finger head drops to a solid cap that laces nicely down the glass. The smell is sweet, with notes of prunes and not surprisingly raisons, as well as a dark malt. Seems slightly cloying in the nose, and this translates to the flavor, cutting back on drinkablity. Though otherwise the flavor is nice, with sweet dark fruits up front going into a rich and coffee/espresso malty finish that finishes nicely. As said before it is a bit too sweet, but an interesting beer for sure. My only real complaint is that there is very little Belgian about this beer to me. I don't know what style to call this beer, but where Belgian strong dark ales have a refined complexity this beer has a loose impressionistic flavor that seems to fall in with american craft brews. I guess balance is what I am pointing towards, this beer doesn't really have it. Though it is still very enjoyable.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Belgian Dark Strong Ale,83
10099,1180,maximum12,3.12,"Picked up on one of our frequent trips to donate our hard-earned money to our friends across the border in Wisconsin.  A distinct amber in color with little to no head. Swirling the beer brings our a smell of...well, since this is a family site, I won't say, but it's rather foul. That doesn't bode well.  Tastes better than it reeks! This thing has malts upon malts with some malts running along the back of my throat right up until the malts hit my tummy. There's a warm hint of alcohol, and a bit of acrid, sour fruit, perhaps the raisins noted in the name?  Not real drinkable. Interesting brew, but I won't be needing another anytime soon. I can't always count of Dogfish for something eminently drinkable, but I'm never bored.

10099,1180,JRed,3.48,"It has a cough syrup color, reddish tint, and a medicine cabinet smell. Syrupy, sugary. The taste is one of synthetic sugars in a blender with Civil War grandma's cure for syphilis. But it has a syrupy, molasses-like taste that can be warming in the cold weather. This special beer has a great mouthfeel, it goes down smooth and leaves behind a dry sugar aftertaste.

10099,1180,Reagan1984,3.4,"The description of this beer has always intrigued me. As a devout 60 Minute and 90 Minute IPA fan, I have been looking forward to trying this unique member of the Dogfish Head line-up.  The beer appeared deep brown with amber highlights and I saw no visible carbonation. There was a thick head that did fade quickly and lots of clumpy lacing when consumed.  Aroma was sweet and reminded me of figs along with the roasted malts. I got a quick sense this was going to be a sweet one.  Taste was an initial sweet punch that then combined with some roasted malt flavors. After this it faded to a smooth (lack of hops) yet grainy finish. Almost a bit dry towards the end.  Mouth feel was almost sticky and a bit viscous due to the sweetness. slightly slick  Drinkability was good, but this is a thick one!  If I'm in a MALT mood then this is a good one.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Belgian Dark Strong Ale,83
10099,1180,largadeer,4,"Appearance: Beautiful clear mahogany in color. A gentle pour into a wide-mouthed goblet produced almost no head. Still a great looking beer, however.  Smell: Smells largely of overripe fruit (figs, plums) and brown sugar. A bit of toast appears as it warms along with a hint of yam.  Taste & mouthfeel: Flavors of caramelized sugar, dates and raisins at the forefront with an undertone of toasted malt. The low/moderate carbonation was initially a surprise, but it works fine here; I was just expecting something closer to the crisp effervescence of most Belgian examples of this style. This certainly isn't a traditional Belgian style beer though, more of a Belgian/American hybrid. The finish dries up nicely, leaving a hint of alcohol on the palate. A touch more hop bitterness may benefit this beer to cover up the slight alcohol presence, but it's by no means harsh.  Notes: Nice stuff, glad I had the chance to try this. Got this as an extra from Azurelimits. Thanks!",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Belgian Dark Strong Ale,83

This is a nice looking brew.  The smell is sweet, sugary, and raisin-y. That's after you get past the slightly off-putting alcohol smell. There also seems to be a bit of maltiness there, as well.  Sweet malts are followed by (over?)ripe fruit flavors. Some chocolate in there and a touch of coffee and roasted malts. Raisins and very green earthiness on the back end. Tastes of burnt fruits at various sips. The alcohol, while indeed warming, is suprisingly well hidden to the tongue.  This feels average, at best. Slightly watery and thin. You can tell that it's trying to be more full-bodied, but it just can't pull it off.

T: The taste was OK, it was entirely too sweet for my taste and the consistence almost seemed like I was drinking watered down syrup. Very thick. Again, it appeared heavy on the malt with some hops but too much sweet flavor for my taste.  M/D: Overall the beer was OK.

Tried to smell the boatload of raisins that are used in the brewing process, and after a few sniffs located them. Earthy and musty.  Taste: Sweet overtures followed by bitter hoppiness. All the sugar that was crammed into the beer produced a slightly maple syrupy touch. Rough aftertaste. I expected more.  Mouthfeel: A bit heavy on carbonation, even after being allowed to breathe for a few minutes. Stuck to teeth. Not too good.

The sweet, green raising taste are more evident in the aftertaste along with some earthiness.  M: A nice, smooth, and full-bodied mouthfeel overall.

S- odd aroma to say the least... not sure yet if it's good or bad. i immediately recognize the smell, anyone in the eastern united states who's had the troublesome ground ivy in their yard might find the similarity as well. it's pungent and musky and translated in this brew it's not so bad, but on your hands it's nearly as bad as a stink bug. golden raisins perhaps, with the earthiness of beet greens more than beet sugar. somewhat cocoa-ish in the background and as it warms, red fruity maltiness appears. also in warming, alcohol becomes ever present and slightly overtaking.  T- taste buds are flooded with black raisins covered in melted bittersweet chocolate. roasted and caramel malt, burnt brown sugar, and dark over ripe fruit, and black olive? strange taste indeed, but much more inviting than the aroma. lacks the complexity of my favorite BSDAs but provides a unique offering of seldom recognized tastes, which i can always appreciate. becomes woodsy and herbal and the dark cocoa morphs into light coffee, crushed maple leaves, and a general clorophyll taste behind the sweet malt. sweet red wine (lambrusco?) and brown sugar soaked in alcohol come out as it warms. hard to say whether i can taste the belgian yeast as it seems to be lost in the other flavors.  MF- rich and nearly creamy with the right amount of fizz to keep it movin. there's an ongoing battle between cloying and drying, neither really achieving victory.

There is an ever so slight taste of bitter fruit in the finish. Maybe that could be the alcohol though, this one is pretty hefty.

Deep inhalation makes me think of a whiskey with muted alcohol. Taste is well balanced. Dark brown sugar, rye-like maltiness. The mahogany's contrabution is evident.

Normally, I avoid fruit-containing beers as, said fruit tends to dominate the character of the beer and, frankly, if I wanted fruit I'd have bought a peach.  However, the investment in the six pack (and it IS and investment!) warranted a tasting and I was flabbergasted by the result. Simply put, this beer is exceptional.  Color is as described (by Dogfish Head), ie, mahogany. It's also got a good dose of protein in the head and the lacing hangs around for the duration. Beer is crystal clear.  Aroma is mysterious but very rich. I think the last reviewer got it right when he said that if he hadn't known that there were raisins in the beer, he wouldn't have know what was going on here. As it is, the beer smells inviting, al beit a bit intimidating. After all, who's well-versed in the quaffing of dried fruit?!?  The flavor is great. Complex, like a (barley) wine though w/o the alcohol punch. Very deep.  Finish is clean. There's a noticeable sticky sweetness on the lips, but nothing cloying on the palate. Other than that, you are simply left with the memories of the fruit, and a nagginig invitation to take another sip.

Appearance is a deep and clear mahogany with about a finger of head. Not bad but nothing overly exciting. A bit of lacing.  Smell is not overly complex, but does contain some interesting notes of belgian candy sugar, sweet malts, hints of raisins (though honestly, I probably wouldn't have got that one if I didn't know it was in the recipe). Hops are very mild and way in the background as they should be.  The taste is much the same as the smell but enhanced by a creamy mouthfeel and more subtle complexities of clove, banana, and a slight hop bitterness at the finish. Damn near a weizenbock in taste really- but with a belgian-american twist. very good.  I must say, I think this beer is grossly under-rated.

The taste is a little bitter, but in the good way, followed by a spicy malt character with limited carbonation, medium-bodied and no sign of the fruit like the aroma?!? M&D both fit the bill, the spicy tone was a little harsh on the palette, at 8% its very drinkable, if these spices do it for you and this is what you expect from a Belgian Strong Dark Ale.

Color is a beautiful cherrywood hue, minimal head due to my insistence that beer should be imbibed at temperatures near freezing (sue me).  Smell reminds me of molasses.  Taste is almost overly sweet, but then again, I like sweet. Molasses, with a following bite of alcohol.  Mouthfeel is near perfect. Daddy likes.  In addition to liking cold beer, I like high alcohol content. I'm in the military, and I like my beers like I like my women: intoxicating. Sessionable? Hells yes!",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Belgian Dark Strong Ale,83
10099,1180,GFSchwab,4.13,"Poured a dark brown with a thin, off white head.  WHat I really loved about this beer was how layered an complex the flavor really was. It comes on with a very chewy, toffee like taste, giving way notes of port, and maple.  Then on the way down, a clean hoppy finish finish, tied with a little bit of an ethanol bite.  An citrus marinated fowl woould go great with this beer.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Belgian Dark Strong Ale,83

Its not a wow factor beer, it wont bowl you over, but you know what it just tastes clean and good. A: the head could be better but at 8 % its hard to complain. i actually really really dig the color. it has this almost red amber oak stain hue that glows...good stuff  S: sweet, not sugary sweet, ripe dark fruit sweet plum almost with an almost caramel finish, maybe its roasted something, but it finished more simmered  T very clean i have read some notes of it being offensive or too much of one thing, but i actually really like it. its sweet but in a dried fruit (dare i say raisin) way...no it does not remind me of raisins which for me is a good thing. it even has an almost smoke in the back to bolter the sweetness...is this not what we call balance ppl? i was going to give the taste a 4, but as i sip and enjoy it i bumped it to 4.5....its not groundbreaking so no 5, but it does nothing wrong and just makes me so happy i tried it.  Biggest surprise in a while...i expected to hate this beer, the name put me off, reviews weren't favorable....but you know what this is a damn tasty brew worth trying.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Belgian Dark Strong Ale,83
10099,1180,SchmoTerp,3.8,"This staple of DFH pours a deep mahogany (as described on the bottle) with medium to low head. Not surprisingly, it smells and tastes strongly of raisons. It's fairly easy and smooth enough to drink with a good mouthfell, but I think drinking several of these would get old due to the raison taste - towards the end of the drink it started to taste more bitter than sweet.  I'd certainly recommend this one, but not something I'd get everyday.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Belgian Dark Strong Ale,83
10099,1180,PatrickJR,4.42,"Poured from 12 oz nonic pint glass.  A - Deep, transparent brown with one finger head that receded into thin collar. No lacing.  S - Roasted malts, with a coffee-like overtone. Dark fruit and some vegetal characteristics as well.  T - Amazing. Sweet malt upfront, but over-ripe fruit follows, with a slight sourness like a good porter. Coffee as well with a little chocolate thrown in. Ample hop bitterness in the finish. Alcohol is well hidden, with only a minute appearance near the end.  M - Medium bodied, smooth, and lightly carbonated.  D - A great beer to have a few of. The ABV certain sneaks up, but otherwise I could drink these all night.  I'm actually surprised to see that this beer is rated as low as it is, because I find it one of the most engaging beers from the American craft circuit. This beer combines some of the most desirable aspects from a good pale ale, porter, and mild stout.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Belgian Dark Strong Ale,83
10099,1180,generallee,4.23,"This poured a lovely mahogany, reddish/brown color. On top is a thick white head that faded off quickly to just a thin ring around the glass. The aroma is full of sweet roasted malts and raisins. The flavor is full of roasted malts, caramel, toast and green grapes. A light hop bitterness balances out the sweetness. Its medium to full body and soft carbonation gives it a velvety smooth mouth feel.

The taste is nice as well, fruity, with roasted malt flavors all thru it. Maybe the sweetness is a little run in it. The mouthfeel is quite different to say the least. The ABV is 8 and it shows.

Aromas of Malt, raisins, toffee, chocolate, wood. Taste is sweet malt and caramel up front followed up with some raisin, butterscotch and a touch of hop bitterness at the end. Medium to full bodied, slightly sticky with a velvety mouthfeel.  In a nutshell, sweet as a game 7 victory.

10099,1180,Lexluthor33,3.22,"Poured a copper brown with a small head. The smell was rum,raisin,fruits and alcohol. The taste was of raisins,caramel and alcohol. It was sweet,but the alcohol dominated and it had a metallic taste. The feel was sticky and syrupy. I feel this was a non session beer and it was fine to have one, but did not desire anymore.  Notes: Good intentions all around,but this one missed it's mark and needs some fine tuning. By no means is this a bad beer,just not a good one. Too much alcohol dominance and not well balanced. It supposedly won best American beer. Go figure. Final thought is I will not purchase this for some time.

10099,1180,Ben4881,3.93,"Raison D'Être Dogfish Head Craft Brewery  Appearance: This brew pours translucent amber with red highlights. The head is maybe half an inch somewhere between cream and white. It hangs around momentarily, and then retreats to the amber glow below leaving no trace of lace behind it.  Smell: Raison D'Être has a very sweet and subtle aroma. The scent is rather faint and I have to really get in there to get a good whiff. Malt and caramel notes emerge leaving me with intense curiosity for the taste.  Taste: Coinciding with the smell, the taste begins on a sweet note. Then things get more complex. I can taste molasses and maybe a hint of fruit up front. Then the taste begins to turn and the delicious hop bitterness slaps the back of my tongue and the flavor of alcohol hits the back of my throat. Upon swallowing, the fruity sweetness returns to my lips while the hop bitterness lingers at the back of my tongue and the roof of my mouth. This is an intriguingly complex flavor that begs for another sip.  Mouthfeel: The appearance does not suggest a very thick mouthful. While Raison D'Être is by no means as thick as a stout, it has more body than I anticipated, a welcome surprise. I would classify the carbonation level as comfortable. There is certainly carbonation present and is easily detected, however, it does not overwhelm the senses and destroy the taste buds.  Drinkability: Yes sir, I would like another. Two would definitely be my limit. 8% ABV is not particularly high, but Raison D'Être has a sweet flavor that could turn on my stomach if I had a few too many. I would highly recommend as a night cap any night. This is a fine creation and I applaud the efforts going on in Delaware.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Belgian Dark Strong Ale,83

Very little apparent carbonation.  S: Sweet and sugary. Brown sugar and candied sugar.  T: Like the nose, the sweetness dominates the taste -- caramel malt and candied sugar, along with brown sugar. Also some fruity sweetness that reminds me of apple skins. Alchohol heat shows up at the back of the sip and down the throat.  M: Medium-bodied in heft, some prickly carbonation and an overall smooth experience.  D: OK. Too sweet for my taste.  Notes: But for the smooth mouthfeel and prickly carbonation, I would not have been shocked if you'd told me this was an English Barleywine.

It had a strange aroma that smelled a little like bacon not too impressive. The taste was similar with hints of bacon, decomposing leaves, and campfire smoke. I really didn't care for this one at all and came close to just dumping it out. I'm not sure if I just got a bad batch of this or what because I have enjoyed all the other Dogfish Head beers I've tried.

As a belgian strong dark ale, it's not something I would compare to a chimay blue. The alcohol is very present and the mouthfeel is a little unappetizing. It is also very sweet to the point of almost unenjoyable. I had this experience with the sam adams double bock, and this beer was running on the thin ice that the sam adams fell through.

10099,1180,SIRIUS2,3.8,"Poured from a 12 oz. bottle into a pint glass.  A: Mahogany brown, clear, with a light foaming head. Moderate head retention and no lacing to speak of. The head reduced to an uneven fat ring of bubbles that stayed with the drink.  S: Subtle but complex. Some nice aromas of fruit, perhaps dates or figs, and some malty undertones that matched nicely with it. Nothing overwhelming that stood out on its own, just a light subtle understated aroma.  T: A rather light flavored brew for the weight and color. The tastes mingle well and are very balanced, almost too balanced as nothing stands out to give it a specific character. Like the smell, the flavors are complex but subtle, which makes you keep looking for something in the flavor profile that you just know is there. The finish is quick and clean, with just the slightest linger of malt.  M&D: Looking at this you would think you are about to embark on a rather heavy drink but in reality this comes off rather light. The carbonation is also light, and goes well with the rest of the personality of this brew. It's smooth drinking and sort of easy going in its own way. I liked it, but there isn't anything that jumps out at me and screams ""this is great!"" I would drink it again though.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Belgian Dark Strong Ale,83

""...brewed with Belgian beet sugars, green raisins & a sense of purpose.""  A: Clear, deep amber showing an abundance of fast-rising carbonation to a sandy tan head, 1/2 finger at best. Head drops to a spotty cream, thicker at the ringing edge. Flecks of creamy lace.  S: Caramel & cocoa aromas with hints of smoke. Sugary cereal-grain maltiness, perhaps some molasses, and an interesting fruit aroma with hints of raw wood.  T: An intriguingly sweet, malty blend of toasty grains and sugars, with that puff of smoke, subtle fruits (the raisins?) and hints of leather and milk chocolate.  M: Medium body. Despite the vast number of bubbles in the glass, this doesn't have an overly carbonated mouthfeel. It's a bit surprising how smooth, bordering on velvety, this is. A little alcohol warmth sneaks in; it's notable flaw is a sticky starchiness that really gloms onto the entire mouth, making me yearn for a toothbrush.  D: DFH may not make the most drinkable brews - on this I'm definitely 'one & done' - but they certainly craft unique flavors.

A little cloying with a hint of nail-polish remover. Alcohol is evident, but not overpowering.  Syrupy smooth in the mouth. Very little carbonation.  Very tasty, but really sweet and raisiny.

Smell is a bit musty, malts hit my nose first, like coffee. Alcohol comes through, hint of dark fruit like raisins.  Taste is Dark roasted malts, just enough hop balance. The alcohol is very evident throughout the entire sip and lingers for a long time. As it warms, sweetness comes through a bit more in the malts, and I pick up a bit of a dark fruit taste.  Low to medium carbonation. The alcohol taste is not very well hidden and is a bit much in this beer, but I did enjoy slowly sipping it with a big slice of Sicilian pizza.

I smell over ripe banana, raisins, and a tinny type of metallic.  Theres that metallic taste again, plus caramel, sweet malt, and a gamey sort of flavor. This beer says its brewed with a sense of purpose, I'm not sure what purpose it is because it is wildly off balance - to each his own.

Acrid quality present in the aftertaste, especially on the back of the tongue. A certain amount of vegetal taste, somewhat hay-like. Not at all viscous, but yet somehow manages to seem heavy, perhaps it's the bitterness. I am not impressed by it's flavor.  D: I think the concept behind this beer is good.

T: There is a bit more malt flavor than in the nose. I like what the raisin characteristic brings, but that metallic flavor that was in the nose is present and big. M/D: a very harsh crispness in the mouth and to much carbonation for my tastes. The harshness is not from the alcohol, but rather a rough metal fell on the mouth. This needs to be much creamier and rich. This actually drinks just fine. The high alcohol is not detectable, but the metallic stuff going on does not make this particularly smooth to drink.

Pleasant warming from the 8% ABV  D: This beer is a unique mishmash of uncommon flavors.... could be really good with some refinement, or possibly toned down a bit, but the heaviness of the mouthfeel is a bit much.

Smells of rum, sweetish raisins, and a light breadiness reminiscent of sweet rolls.  Taste: Very fruity, tasting strongly of raisins, prunes, and other sublimely sweet fruit products. The light and toasty character of the malt adds some slight balance to the beer, but this is a very sweet drink overall. The alcohol is pretty obvious from start to finish, eventually leaving a somewhat harsh medicinal aftertaste on the tongue. It sort of reminds me of the stiff, fruit juice-based mixed drinks we used to come up with in college; there's no nuance or complexity here. Just alcohol and sweetness.

Smell: Light smell. Sweetness but not from malt. Some alcohol in there.  Taste: Like the smell, there's a marked sweetness but it's not a malt sweetness. It's more like syrup sugar. Some grape fruitiness. The alcohol can definitely be tasted.  Mouthfeel: Light to medium body (leaning to light). Very smooth. In terms of carbonation, maybe a little too flat for my taste.  Drinkability: Not a bad beer. It's just that its type of sweetness makes it too much of a soda/beer hybrid for my taste, and there's no complexity in there. The alcohol is too obvious too.

Most of the smells come from the funky combination of the raisins and the yeast.  T= This is by no means a bad beer, but it sort of reminds me, in its appearance and taste, of Newcastle Brown Ale with raisin sweetness added. It sports a modest malt flavor, low hopping, and of course that raisin sweetness.  MF= Some crispness in the mouth, with residual sugars forming a bit of body.  D= While I cannot say that this is my favorite beer in the world, it sure goes down deceptively easy for such a high abv brew (8%).

Taste: Very sweet, thick malt up front, like a Belgian quad. Once that medicinal sweet backs out, strong roasted barley and chicory coats your mouth. There is also a hint of coffee. I searched for more, wanting more complexity, but there was none to be found. The bottle said white grapes were present, but they were lost in the overpowering malt, alcohol, and roasty flavors.  Mouthfeel: The beer consistancy is great, good texture and coats my mouth well. I wish the roastedness and bitterness would subside quicker and not overpower the beer.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Belgian Dark Strong Ale,83
10099,1180,DIM,3.38,"a: As the label clearly indicates this beer is indeed a dark mahogany color. It pours with a big frothy white head; great lace and retention.  s: Aromas of sugary stewed raisins, earthy peats, vanilla, and alcohol.  t: Sweet vanilla and raisin flavors dominate. I also detected brown sugar and a bit of cherry before the mouth drying, perfumed alcohol finish. This is too hot for 8.0 abv.  m: This a decent and a nice foamy texture to it, but the heat at the end is a drawback.  d: This is a pretty good beer, but DFH has some much better brews in their lineup that I'll stick to.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Belgian Dark Strong Ale,83

Tasted of sweet malts and fresh raisin. It brought back great memories of a growler of East End Dubbel Trubbel I had last week. There was a spicy finish with some hop bitterness which rounded it out nicely. I could drink this all night and day.

Single-finger head that grows a bit with a nice swirl in the goblet. Lacing is nonexistent.  S - Molasses is the first thing that hits my nostrils - rich and sweet. Also smell of dark malts. The smell is very similar to other Belgian beer I've sampled. I'm digging for a hint of the raisin smell, and I only catch a note. Not nearly as prominent as I'd expected.  T - The Belgian candi sugar and dark malts are nice and sweet. I get a slight hint of the raisins I've been searching for on the back of the tongue. Overall, I think the sweetness is just about right.  M - The mouthfeel is pretty heavy, which is to be expected when purchasing an 8% abv beer. I feel that the heaviness and the high carbonation balance well with the sweetness of the beer.  D - I'll have to say that I'm glad that I only bought a single rather than a 6 pack. However, I disagree with the way that the drinkability of the beer itself can deduct points. I feel that a beer can be very tasty without being able to drink more than one per sitting, which I think the case is here.

S- Notes of brown sugar molasses and dark malts. A bit of a Belgian-y nose also.  T- This is a decent brew but a bit has a odd aftertaste. This has a very strong molasses and brown sugar flavor. A definite alcohol to this beer too. The aftertaste is somewhat strong and sticks around.  M- Somewhat thick on the tongue. Decent carbonation.  D- I could have some of these but not a huge fan.

S: Smells of caramel and other sweet malt tones. A bit of dark fruit in the nose as well.  T: Very sweet, some caramel and a bit of raisin, with a bit of bitterness in the end. Alcohol warmth and dryness finish it out, along with some toasted malt tones. Even some chocolate creeps in. A really pleasing taste.  M/D: Full bodied, pretty high on the carbonation, a bit crisp. Drinkability is OK. This beer actually feels like a much bigger beer (although an 8% strong dark ale is no slouch).

The beer is slightly more caronated, slightly less syrupy, and has slightly less candied sugars than you will find in a typical Belgian. What you will get are lots of heavy fruits - figs, rind, raisin -- blended quite nicely. This is a nice, enjoyable, full bodied beer with complexity. I don't know if it's a very good Belgian, per se, but how often are labels misnomers anyway. As the Bros mentioned, the ABV is a bit too pronounced.

T: Dry, roasted malt, and Belgian yeast providing the fruity esters followed closely by dark chocolate, brown sugar, dark fruit, earthy bitterness, and a touch of zingy booziness.  M: Big and full at first that gradually becomes drier and more bitter as the middle and finish emerge. Nice sweet, dry, and bitter effects on the tongue during the finish.  D: Quite good.

10099,1180,Gehrig,3.89,"I grabbed this at the excellent local Piccadilly, seeing the ads about this being an award-winning beer. I'm not sure how. The appearance is an amalgam of very good color, and very poor head, especially for a BSDA. Half a finger of tan froth tops a dark ruby-brown body, with the head dissipating quicker than you can say dissipate. No lacing on this glass makes this the first combined appearance score I've ever written--4 for color, 2 for head and retention = 3 Appearance score. The smell is better, with the advertised beet sugar, fruit, spice, and some caramel emerging. These carry into the taste quite well, combining with hints of coffee to make a flavorful, though understated, Belgian strong. Probably in no small part indicative of the poor head retention, the mouthfeel suffers somewhat from a flat texture. All in all, this has fine drinkability from nice flavors, smell, and its ability to mask the fairly high ABV (8 %) rather well.  Yet this is not a great BSDA, far from it. The bottle's label announces that it is a beer with ""a sense of purpose."" If so, it should be more readily evident to its consumers, for if anything, this lacks a strong identity, suffering from having several nice qualities but none that take this beer to the upper echelon.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Belgian Dark Strong Ale,83

It almost had a coffeeish or roasted malt taste when it first hit the tongue, and the hops and alcohol aren't hidden to well.

Smells a little stale, which isn't necessarily bad. It's unique.  Initial taste brings a mild sweet malt bite but it's almost drowned out by the alcohol which isn't very well hidden. If there's a dominant flavor here, it's sort of a stale fruit flavor. What hops are there are drowned out by the other flavors, leaving some weak bitterness that doesn't last long, making for a pretty unbalanced brew.  A medium to heavy-bodied brew, depending on who you're asking, that feels a little heavy on the palate. Not a lot of carbonation here. There are beers out there that are more drinkable than this even with the same ABV, but coupling the taste and the higher ABV, makes this beer more of a sipper than anything.

A = Pours out a dark amber with garnet-like reddish undertones, forms virtually no head though a nice amount of lace forms on the top of it, Small bubbles continue to rise up throughout in a nice light carbonation.  S = Smells of compost on my initial sniff. However, as it warms and breaths and as I take successive sniffs, the smells improve and get much richer. There are hints of spices and smoke. This is a very complex smell, I cannot decide whether it smells more like smoking salmon by the seaside or cooking down fruits with strong spices to make winter holiday preserves. Those would seem like completely different smells, but both come to mind as I smell this beer.  T = After the extremely exotic smells, the taste is actually pretty straightforward beer taste. It has a hint of the raisins that are cooked in it, the Belgian ale yeast taste is there but not too strongly, roasted malts are present and the taste gets sweeter in the finish which is fairly long and involves the entire mouth.  M = Medium to heavy bodied, great mouthcoating, foamy luscious feeling as you swish in your mouth.  D = An interesting beer, it does taste good, but I am not sure that I would rate it too highly in drinkability for the simple reason that I think there are better picks in the style.

I do detect the fruitiness of green raisins dosed in alcohol along with red apples. The mouthfeel is medium to full, oily smooth, and creamy. The taste is malty and sugary sweet with a bit of bitter spiciness. Green raisin fruitiness and plenty of raw alcohol are also present. I have had this beer before my reviewing days and remember it being quite enjoyable. This time, however, it seems raw and unrefined. Could just be the bottle, and I may need to give this one another go at some point.  Second time through I do not feel that this beer is raw and unrefined.

The alcohol is also detectable, but is just there as a hint, the raisins and malts are the dominant aromas.  The malt taste hits you first, gradually moving to a definite raisin taste, finishing with an earthy hint, accompanied by a noticeable alcoholic warmth and taste.  Medium to full body, decent carbonation, but ends up sitting heavy on the tongue afterwards, with that alcoholic warmth.  Overall, a decent brew that is drinkable in moderation, but unless you are a fanatic of the style, I dont see this being a session beer or a daily drinker.

T= sweet raisin, yet a bitterness more like currants than just the slight bitterness of the hops. Delightful if you're in this sort of mood.  M= light sweetness, light fruity currant-raisin bitterness, a bit of a taste-bouquet to savor for more than the usual aftertaste.  D= although one or two of these should be very drinkable if you're in the mood, I think it's also a bit of a special-moment beer worthy of savoring in small quantity.

The head as I keep drinking goes away and there is nothing left of it. Also does not leave any lacing down the glass. Definitely could see how the bottle says that this is deep mahogany.  Smells are rather sweet coming off it; a bit like brown sugar and raisins mixed together. Can also smell the 8% alcohol coming off of it a bit.  Taste is rather sweet as first; A mixture of fruit, mostly raisins, plums, and a bit of the cinnamon as well; also a bit of honey and brown sugar i would say. Definitely are hit with a lot of malt at first but It seems to fade away into nice earthy feel on the mouth after the initial sweetness goes away. Hit with a slight hint of bitterness and alcohol taste, which leaves the mouth with a warm feeling, as well which actually goes nice to offset the sweetness a bit.  The mouthfeel at first is rather carbonated and then that fades away into stickiness. In a way, the sides of my mouth after drinking this make me feel like I ate something sweet and I think this goes well with the malty dominance of this brew.  Overall, a pretty good Belgian that I could see myself drinking a lot of and possibly picking up to share with friends.

I know I should be getting some raisin there, but I am not getting anything. Flavor is smooth raisins that are not overly powerful. Firm malty tones with what seems like mild hop character.

10099,1180,Dalem,4,"Good dark red color with a head that didn't get big at all (1/4 inch total) but held it's retention for a good long time. Brewed with beet sugar and green raisins the scent is on the slightly on the sweeter end of things but not artificial or too much of a candyness to it. It's not overbearing-You can smell the yeast and malts. It definitely smells like beer but Dogfish Head prides itself on doing things offbeat/off center and it's an usual aroma but piques the interest on how it's gonna taste. Full bodied but not thick. The dark sugars and slightly grape flavors blend well with a malty dryness. Very smooth and not bitter-unless one is made aware that this is a 8% abv they'd never have an idea. It's a proverbial iron fist in a velvet glove story. As it warms in the glass it takes on more of a spiced wine taste but still holds a distinct character. It finishes with a creamy and caramel like flavor. I wouldn't suggest it as something when the months get warmer and the days get longer but in the cold times were in right now, this is an enjoyable beer to curl up on the couch with the wife, a big quilt and a movie.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Belgian Dark Strong Ale,83

What head was there was bright white.  S- I catch aromas of, of course, raisins first, followed by plums, brown sugar, and hoppy scents bringing up the rear.  T- First taste is caramelized raisins. Then, I get a molasses taste, but not sweet molasses, it is more bitter. Middle way to finish, I catch a sugary roasty taste and alcohol on the end.  M- Thin to medium in the mouth. Not much on the malt and not creamy for sure. Carbonation is just right to me.  D- Not a very drinkable beer since it is so sweet. However, the first one (and probably the only one for me today) is very nice and quite enjoyable.  I tried this beer a while back before I really got in to beer.

Nice head, with fair retention, with no real lacing that I like in a Belgian-style beer.  S: Lighter than I expected, but I picked up notes of dark fruit, brown sugar, and rum.  T: Very sweet, heavy notes of dried fruit and baking sugar, with a delectable molasses finish. A bit of an alcohol burn is detectable as the beer warms, but it doesn't seem out of place, it mixes well with the flavours. A very tasty beer overall.  M: Smooth, creamy and rich, slightly warming, nice on a cold November night.  D: One of my favourite beers from Dogfish Head, Raison D'Etre is a class act, one of the best American-made Belgians on the market in my opinion.

10099,1180,pavandal,4.31,"Beer poured into my tulip glass a clear, deep amber color with a creamy, frothy, thick and soft head. Awesome looking brew.  The scent had a bit of a rusty kind of smell, but not in a bad way. It also smelled of grapes and had a very strong caramel backbone.  Sweet! That's the first thing that comes to mind when tasting this brew. Grapes and a bit of an orangy tang were next, followed by a slight bitter hoppy bite, and a warm alchohol finish. This was &lt;b&gt;awesome&lt;/b&gt;.  A very easy drinker, so smooth that I bet you could slam a bottle of this and not flinch. Don't do that, though. Enjoy this one! And enjoy it at home, or when you're not driving, because at 8% ABV, it'll definately get you buzzed.  All in all, this is a truly great beer, I feel. Delicious, sweet, and awesome looking.

10099,1180,brdc,3.78,"Thanks ddddeac for this one. Small capped bottle poured into a goblet.  Starts very nice, golden brown with some red highlights, a dense light brown head. The head, however, lasts less than two minutes, but leaves a decent collar and a small amount of lacing. The aroma is faint, peculiar but ultimately nice. As it warms in my hands, a somewhat roasted, toffee like aroma slowly makes its way up. However, the dominating fruitiness is quite unusual, mostly bananas, with some other sweetish notes difficult to define. Taste is much more pronounced than the aroma, but the bananas are still here, sweetish, somewhat toasted. Reasonably rich, but strange, different. Not bad, but I might need a few more servings over a few weeks to make up my mind.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Belgian Dark Strong Ale,83

This beer took me back to where I belong.  A: Nice copper color with 3 finger tan head.  S: Scorched caramel popcorn.  T: Awesome.

I tried a tall hefeweizen glass (not recommended), and a large red wine glass, which drank much better.  The taste is delicious. At first I wasnt awestruck, but after a couple the rich, carmel and raisin tones came out on top, with a warm, dark aftertaste that belied it's 8% abv. Slight hints of spice. The more I drank this beer, the more that warm, fall taste grew on me. Excellent late fall or early winter beer. Packs a good punch.  Decent mouthfeel, but this beer really shines in it's immediate aftertaste. All the flavors come out.  Fairly drinkable, but i wouldnt have more than 3 or so in a sitting.

Not bad, just unusual.  It had enough hops to cut the brown sugar sweetness and leave a relatively clean palate.  I rated drinkabilty a little low as the alcohol burn was evident to me which makes this more of a sipper for me.

Even if I didn't know there were raisins in there, that aroma is fairly obvious as well.  BElgian with a great twist. just enough roast to throw something different in there and the raisins add to the fruitiness off the yeast. It's a darker, more bitter fruit that balances with the sweet, sour yeast very well.  Not as smooth and creamy as most Belgians as far as cabonation, carbed more like an amber ale or something.

The smell is a complex mix of fruits, wine, dark bread and alcohol. Taste is much the same with copious doses of fruity esters, ranging from grapes to raisons to plums. Also, hints of wine, dark bread, pepper and a mild floral hoppiness. The sum total comes out moderately sweet tasting. Mouthfeel is medium bodied, with a somewhat oily texture, fizzy carbonation, and a lightly alcoholic finish.  Overall, I like how the flavors come together in this one.

Aroma was a very complex blend of sweet malty fig, raisin and dark fruit, with the 8% alcohol making itself present in the nose at mid-glass. Mouthfeel of this full bodied beer was somewhat tingly, and the flavor was more of the sweet fig-raisin-dark fruit combination, again with alcohol becoming more dominant as the beer progressed.

Taste more like green grapes than raisins. Sweet caramel malts really dominate after the first initial bite. Expected body for the style w/ medium carbonation.  D: Tasty brew that drinks easy enough. Higher alcohol that is hidden nicely; only slightly coming forth with a tinge and warmth if you hold it in your mouth for more than 2-3 seconds. Would I have another?

Appearance is fine, a dark tan, clear. Nice head foamy head.  Aroma, taste all gone. The smell is almost neutral, and the taste is flat. The raisin taste is gone. Only the sugar and malty tastes remains. The beer goes down easy, and the alcohol smell is completely gone. The beer is still very bubbly.

Head retention is lackluster, and no lacing is left behind.  The aroma is alot like an oatmeal-raisin cookie. Obvious emphasis on the fruity raisins, here, although notes of brown sugar and biscuity malts are present too.  The taste is neither bad, nor phenomenal. Packs a big spicy hop note alongside a fruity/sweet, sugary body. Mouthfeel is sharp and semi-viscous with a bitter brandy aftertaste. Crisp & mildly refreshing, too.

Color, head, and smell were all very nice, but I really missed the green grape in the foreground. Crisp tang made for a good mouthfeel.  I'll say this much: Raison D'etre had one fo the longest finishes I've found in a long time. The flavor of grapes, like white wine, and sugary sweetness carried on in a really enjoyable aftertaste.

Excellent taste. Very much like a fine wine. Hints of dried fruit and sweetness that makes for a nice finish. Very clean in glass. I don't think I'd have more than one or two of these in an evening - would be a great beer for a sirloin steak in a Bordelaise sauce. May also hold up to sharp cheeses or even some blue veined cheese.  Raison D'etres 8% ABV makes it an excellent candidate for aging. I plan on purchasing a six pack and consuming at 6 month intervals to see the differences in taste. As a red wine drinker, I feel that Dogfish Head was looking out for my interest.

Theres more raisons on the finish.  It's sweet, and on the thicker side of medium bodied.  It's good I'm enjoying it.

First and foremost, even before my initial sip, I would have to chalk this up as one of the most unique beers I've ever heard about. Beet sugar and green raisins?  Appearance is a solid deep orange/brown with a brief residual head that left little to no lacing.  Smell was suggestive of fruity candy and dark malts. In the back of the nose, coffee was prominent.  Taste was a little less exotic as I may have guessed. Mostly a sweet fruit meets dark malt that gives in to the darker malty flavor.  Mouthfeel was pretty exceptional. Its consistency gave your mouth a unique chance to take in the entire beer as a whole and I feel it really helped get this beer a positive review.  Drinkability is quite average for this beer. I can't see myself desiring another one anytime too soon.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Belgian Dark Strong Ale,83

Taste is very sweet, bit of chocolate and a slight touch of raisins, but the overwhelming flavor is buttery pancake syrup - very sweet - which is heightened by the syrupy texture of the beer. Faint remnants of hops dont give this brew much balance.  Really intriguing brew, not like any Belgian Strong Dark Ale I have had before. This needs a new category, like Belgian Brown Ale, since it reminds me of some English brown ales more than any Belgian beer.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Belgian Dark Strong Ale,83

A - A deep caramel brown w/ a full 2 finger cream head which is very smooth and the bubbles are tightly formed. A goodly amount of lace stays as large gulps are taken.  S - Caramel, brown sugar, bready yeasty aromas and maybe a hint of raisins.  M - Full and malty, yet crisp and sweet. Creamy, dry and roasted all at the same time. A slightly sweet finish as the malted flavors coat the inside of my mouth. A moderate amount of carbonation keeps the taste from getting cloying.  T - Such a complex beer, where to start? Rich and roasted w/ a dark bread flavor. Tastes like a fresh baked whole wheat loaf. A sweetness of overripe apple w/ a doughy belgian yeast seeps into the flavor. Rich sweetness like having a mouthful of raisins overtakes the taste. Much like a desert w/ raisins, the taste of raisins becomes dominant after half of the pint is swallowed. Very well balanced though and the sweetness is kept in check.  D - A full bodied and strong ale w/ great complexity. The best raisin flavored ale I have had and twice as fresh and sweet from the brewpub. I recommend having this on draft, since it seems more dry and less round and malty in the bottle.

Slightly phenolic. I wouldn't say this beer was too boozy, but it just didn't match up well with the overwhelming sweetness. A touch cloying  Mouthfeel was the highlight of this beer. Syrupy and oily with a good level of carbonation to clean it off the tongue.  Drinkability is pretty low on this one. I didn't really want to finish my glass.

The pairing is well worth revisiting.  I opened a bottle last night. It was slightly tart. Tonight's bottle is even more tart. It approaches a sour ale. This is not my recollection. This beer is a rich copper color with little head. Sourness is its main voice. It isn't a bad sour but it is a pronounced sour. I wouldn't age it again . I recall it much better fresh.

Not much head poured off this beer and what did has since dwindled to a frothy surface.  S: There is a sour, almost hop-like, presence in the aroma that was unexpected. The presence of the Belgian candy sugars is noticeable but I'm not sure I can distinguish the green raisins. This smell reminds me of a dunkel lager in some respects.  T: Belgian sugars are very dominant in this beer and for a second I thought I was drinking a dubbel. I think I can taste some more fruit but as i've never eaten a green raisin, I am not sure that is what it is. When I drank the Jacobsen's Saaz Blonde I remarked how it truly tasted like a mix of Czech Pilsner and Belgian Tripel. This beer may be a perfect mix of a Belgian Dubbel and a Munich Dunkel Lager. Yummy! Very nice, complex flavor.  M: This beer felt more like a creamy dubbel than a watery dunkel but was overall very pleasing. Perhaps a bit heavy on latent carbonation.  D:Musch as was the case with the Saaz Blonde, all it took was one taste to put me on the bandwagon for this ale. I'm going out to get more tomorrow.

Taste is an interestingly harsh clangy-mesh of Belgian yeast, candi sugar, metallic spiciness and nutri-sweet palate linger. Just doesnt have the magic of a Belgo-styled beer at all  I can see what they were shooting for here but for me it just didnt work.

Lots of Booze flavor, on top of a myriad of sweet and malty undertones. This tastes a lot like some (be they much lighter colored) Belgian trippels that I've enjoyed.  A bit too carbonated for my taste. Not until the end of the glass was the foaming action down enough for me to really get a nice thick mouthfeel. For the majority of the drink, the mouth was all bubbles, hard to wrap the tongue around... but once that faded away... splendor.  Quite boozy Even two in a row is too many of these.

Quite sweet (a bit like toffee) with a touch of ever-so-slight sour/bitter at the end. RIGHT ON for a Belgian Strong Ale. Bready and Biscuity tastes round this complex beer out.  Mouthfeel: Just a bit fizzy carbonation for my taste... but typical for beers of this type. Tingles after a while.... and leaves a nice coating/aftertaste.  Drinkability: The only detraction of this beer is the over-abundance of carbonation (IMO). Otherwise this is highly drinkable.... I would say.... GREAT for winter-time/Holiday consumption....

Solvent alcohol aroma, major rum raisin flavor along with some off brand fruit and sweet caramel malt. A little too sweet.  The flavors are more of the same, extra helping of strong alcohol with a concomitant spice flavor. A little much on the brown sugar, though I like the raisin. Background of smoky flavor, a little carnivorous, but adds some depth. This feature actually brought up Taste from 3.0.  The Raison is just not that smooth, the low carbonation doesn't cleanse any of the syrupy sweet flavors.

I let the beer sit for quite a while to warm up (it was chilled to cold) and with another sip the metallic taste turned to strong alcohol taste.  Feels medium bodied and smooth in the mouth.

It felt like someone was shifting gears in my mouth without the use of a clutch.  The ale pours a beautiful deep amber color with a quickly disappearing head. It looks great. Looks like something I'd love.  I then stuck my nose in it and got...nothing. Nada. Almost no aroma at all. Then I took a sip to find three separate and competing forces. There's the maltiness: roasted. Then there's some kind of hopiness fighting to be heard. But the voice shouting the loudest is the overwhelming alcohol sensation (aroma, flavor?). Of course there was some of that distinct Belgian fruitiness as well.  Overall, the brew is just a mess. A pretty mess. A well-made mess.

The taste is very malty and sweet, like raisins, figs, brown sugar, caramel, butterscotch and an herbal taste that reminds me of Jägermeister. Finishes with a bittersweet aftertaste. Mouthfeel is medium, with it being a bit syrupy with just the right amount of carbonation. Drinkability is good, the alcohol isn't too noticable but it does hit you after a while. Aging this beer for a year hasn't hurt it at all, it's pretty tasty! Another good brew from DFH.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Belgian Dark Strong Ale,83
10099,1180,neenerzig,4.25,"Found a single 12 oz. bottle of this at a beer/wine store/bar on my recent vacation to Florida. Had a bottling date of 3/9/07 on the bottle. Poured into a pint glass/tumbler. This beer pours a clear, deep amber copper color with lots of little bubbles rising up. The head was not too impressive, about 1/4 inch or so thick when poured. Settles to an okay surface layer with a decent sized white ring lining the inside of the glass. malty and sweet aromas of honey, apple, plum and spices are present. Something about the taste did remind me of a barley wine. The taste is malty and sweet upfront with caramel and the aforementioned fruits, spices, raisins, etc. rounded out by a touch of hops. Has a very crisp and smooth mouthfeel with moderate to heavy carbonation. Full body. Overall it is easy to drink. Another very good effort from the fine folks at DFH.

10099,1180,trevorwideman,3.02,"12oz bottle poured into a snifter. Thanks to demcorhip for this one!  Pours with no head at all, flat as a board. Not much lace to speak of either. Not much carbonation is evident in this semi-opaque brew. Colour is a dirty brown-grey-purple murkiness with tons of chunks. Spicy nose, a bit of black pepper, clove, and coriander. Belgian sugars to be sure, and a dark, fruity sweetness: ripe plums, figs, raisins and a butterscotch note in the back. Pretty typical of the style.  Taste is swee-ee-eet. There is nothing bitter about this, be assured of that. There is a bit roasted malt, but it's a background note to all the sugariness surrounding it. Definite candylike flavours, butterscotch-caramel, along with the juicy plum and the raisins I caught in the aroma. Nutty flavours, and a sharp, almost metallic note in the finish. Nothing comes to the forefront, it just seems a bit messy to me. Way too damn cloyingly sweet as well. Mild carbonation in the mouth, extremely heavy body, thick and leaning toward syrupy. Wet and creamy texture. I like dessert, but with less sugar. This is like a store-bought cake with that icing that gives you instant hyper-sugar-rush. No way do I want more than one of these, it'll be a struggle to do that. This may be my least favorite beer that I've drank in this style.

Very good retention and a thick coat of lace lined the glass.  Smell: It has a very sweet aroma. Smells like brown sugar with a twist of molasses. Slightly herbal aroma and a bit of a hoppy smell.  Taste: Initially it has an interesting burnt flavor to it. Strong dose of herbal spiciness. Caramel malts are noticeable and perhaps give it such a sweet taste. A bit of hops provide some balance.  Mouthfeel/Drinkability: Medium bodied and slightly syrupy. Carbonation is good. At 8%, it's strong and a bit much to session. I couldn't drink more than two in a sitting.

It also smelled good, but I couldn't get a very good feel for all that had to offer front just the neck of the bottle. Well, it wasn't ideal, but I sure wanted the beer and didn't have a glass handy.  This is a very sweet brew, surprisingly so for the type of beer it is supposed to be. Not that it was bad, just a big sweetness with some figs preserve flavor.  It was a tingly brew on the tongue, but not overly carbonated. It was very pleasant overall.  Given the sweetness of this beer, I wouldn't want to kick back and drink bottle after bottle of this beer. It is worth picking up a few to sample though.

There is a hefty dose of carbonation which prevents it from being too syrupy.  D-The sweetness becomes cloying after awhile, limiting the drinkability factor.

More dates than raisins in the nose.  T - Toffee, wood, caramel, and dates. Also hints of baked apple and leafy hops balance things out. Really nice and rich port/brandy flavors make this a slow sipper to be enjoyed at room temp in a snifter. A little too sweet, but thats only a minor complaint. This is a very tasty Belgian style brew with a unique flavor.  M - Tight, firm, and very full bodied. Low carbonation and a bit of alcohol warmth make this almost spirit-like. I can feel the sugar coating my mouth, but the hops and alcohol sting keep this from getting unbalanced.  D - Pretty damn drinkable for such a big beer.

In the mouth, pretty light, well-carbonated, with mild but noticeable alcohol warmth, some yeasty stuff, dark fruit (raisin etc.), a little cola bite, and a mild bit of hop bitterness in the finish.

10099,1180,86sportster883,3.85,"The Dogfish Head Raison D'Etre is a formidable Belgian Strong. Because it comes off as a bit strange at first I recommend that if you decide to review this beer, do so during the second round. Its one that will grow on you.  A - Reddish amber brown with a quick fading off white head. A well formed ring circles a thin cover that stays with you for awhile. No lacing at all, and although I love the color of this beer, I lowered my rating a notch based only on style definition. The high abv may be the likely culprit behind the weak head.  S - It has a fresh non-citric summer fruit mix smell, with an occasional hint of grainy malt.  T - Initial fruit and malt flavors are quickly overridden by moderate hop bitterness, some very mild alcohol and an odd lingering saltiness. It finishes dry and slightly metallic. Its unusual, but in a good way, and it will certainly take some getting used to.  M - I found the moderately light body and carbonation to somehow add to this beer's drinkability.  Overall, this is an interesting beer that seems a cross between a Belgian Strong Dark and a Belgian Blond (imagine this beer without its candy sugar induced color).

Smell had a heavier malt character, with some tangy fruit compliments. The taste was solid, a solid balance of the dark, sweet malts and slight, tingling hops.

It's definately a beer worth having.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Belgian Dark Strong Ale,83

Smell - out of the bottle, it's almost like grape juice. Once poured in the glass, it's got a lot more boozy caramel, toffee malt, with some dark fruitiness. Quite strong. Good.  Taste - Nice spicy complexity. Hop bitterness really rounds out the sweet malt profile. The overall combination is fantastic.  Mouthfeel - Not a lot of carbonation. Full bodied and smooth. Soothing alcohol warmth. When I poured it, I was dissapointed with the low carbonation, but it seems to work well.  Drinkability - I am quite enjoying this, but I'm not sure I could drink too many at a time due to the sweetness and alcohol.

The smell is of sugar candy, raisins, rum and caramel under a blanket of alcohol.  The taste is of sugar candy, bubblegum, a touch of raisins, and caramel. Raw alcohol partially covers the taste - unfortunate, as it is close to rubbing alcohol - more noticeable than even the abv level should have. Borders on too sweet. There are some fruity hops, but rather muted. Something of a flatness in the finish.  Thinner than expected, but that is not my main complaint about the feel - it's more that the flavors (outside of some alcohol) are quite fleeting and leave a ""flat"" feeling in the mouth (though the beer was by no means flat).  An ""interesting"" brew that doesn't live up to the hype. Nothing particularly special, other than unusual combo of flavors.

The next time, I drank it colder, which produced some chill haze and masked the fruity, smoky flavors.  The color of the beer is a rich red with a hint of brown. The head is about a finger thick, white, and fleeting. It left no lacing to speak of.  Smell is of sweet malts and overripe fruits, mostly figs. I guess this could be the raisins advertised on the label.  Taste is rich and involving. Sweet malts are up front, like a doppelbock, then the fruit flavors. Especially as the beer warms, smoky and alcohol notes come across, as well as some brown sugar. The finish is warm and lingering.

Smells as sweet as it tastes, and make no mistake about it, this is one sweet beer.  Can't say that I could distinguish raisin flavors per se, but certainly the dried fruit character is there for sure. Personally, I tasted more of a dried apricot. This beer possesses some seriously, caramely sweet roasted malts. The sweetness is constrained by the body, which flows smoothly over the tongue, rather than sticking and unduly prolonging the sweetness.

10099,1180,tapman,3.58,"Keeping in mind that 3.0 equals a good average beer and not a Macro, we shall proceed.  What an interesting beer! Pours a mahogany body with an off-white head that I found dissipates rather quickly (a couple minutes) while the lacing retains its thin form throughout the experience, so that's good.  The smell is sweet and the abundant carbonation is also apparent in the smell, kinda metalic. Also mild hops give this beer a lager-ish smell. One can definitely smell the larger than average amounts of sugar from fruit (raisons, duh.)  First thing I noticed was that the alcohol taste was a bit strong, not too bad for me, but my less knowledgeable friends had a hard time with this one and its 8%ABV. The flavor imitates raisons in that you get the real taste after its been consumed. During the drinking I taste alcohol, mild hops, and a hint of sugar, but once its down the throat is when the real fun begins. Finishes sweet and dry with a nice snap to it (you know, when you drink something and then make that smacking sound followed by a sigh, ""*smack* aahhhh""). Definite raison aftertaste, subtle and dark. Note of beet-root for this drinker in the aftertaste as well...maybe other fibrous fruits as well.  Texture is more than a lager, less than a stout. In other words feels like an ale. Good carbonation adds crispness.  Definetly a strong ale, after 2 of these its pointless to review since the inebriation takes away some of the taste.

10099,1180,Beertron,2.54,"Got a nice set of samples from the distributor...figured I'd review them.  I was excited about this beer because I've never tried it but I've had enough beers from DFH to know that their stuff is going to either be fantastic or fascinating -- sometimes both. Poured from bottle to pint glass.  A - Medium golden hue with a soft red tone (R242G177B65). Light white head with orangish tint. Nice big lacing. Soft-to-barely-noticeable carbonation.  S - Raisins, big time. There's a yeasty and syrupy scent going on here with a bit of dark spice a la clove in the background. It also carries a faint aroma of bad coffee (not poorly brewed coffee, just bad -- like Folger's or gas station coffee).  T - Again, raisins. Also, prunes and black currants. There's a syrupy quality but its not outright sweet. It's like the dark sweetness of brown sugar or, more accurately, sorghum syrup. That coffee shows up here in the flavor profile but this time it comes across more like the bitterness of straight coffee grounds. Despite every indication from the appearance, this beer has a lot in common with a dry Irish stout. It's a little more drinkable than I'm making it sound and its very interesting but I'm still having a bit of trouble finishing this one. However, there's some good food pairings to be made here for sure though.  M - It seems like the raisins brought their own sticky astringency to this party. That lightly bitter, syrupy quality is just shy of overbearing. The tastes in this one really just stick to your mouth. Yikes!  D - Sorry. While I could certainly see myself drinking this sometime again just because its so interesting, I couldn't drink more than one of these in any given setting.  F - This would go well with cheese; especially softer, riper cheeses like chevre, brie, camerbert, etc. It would also match well with the right chutney or compote and could really contrast nicely with some great cured meats like prosciutto, salumi or cullatello.  O - One of the reasons this beer suffers in my review is that I'm not a huge fan of raisins. At the same time, I don't hate them or anything. I guess this experiment just showed the answer to a question I had never before asked, ""Would I like raisin flavors in my beer?""

Appearance: A dark amber, some touches of brown in the light, and a nice head once it warms to stay thicker at the edges, leaving nice hints of round lacing throughout along with a lot of bubbles floating to the top.  Smell: Sugary bubblegum, hints of molasses, raisins, bread crust, sweet chocolate, and a bit of sour earthiness.  Taste: Very sweet, but not overly sweet, and when the finish hits it becomes complex and some of the flavors seem to certainly come out a bit more. Flavors of raisins, molasses, bubblegum, sour phenolic mustiness, grapes, dark chocolate and dart fruit come out the most. Not overbearing and pretty complex overall.  Mouthfeel: I wish there was more of a carbonation presence, as this seems a bit syrupy, though not as cloying as I thought initially. Still, I also feel that the coating nature allows the flavors to come out as well as they do when the finish happens during tasting.  Drinkability: Certainly an American take on the style, and a pretty singular one at that.

It doesn't seem to have the Belgian spice character or the earthy hops. That's not to say it's a bad brew though, because I thoroughly enjoyed it. There is a huge malt character up front, with rich, dark sweetness coming through, and a mild hop presence to balance it out. Then there is a big, warming alcoholic finish to prove this beer means business.  Mouthfeel is medium, somewhat creamy and very smooth. However after even one, the sweetness and alcohol start to wear down your tastebuds. Overall this is another winner from DFH, but not quite on par with other Belgian dark ales out there.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Belgian Dark Strong Ale,83

That may be why I find this beer to have an unbalanced, almost creepy quality. Hard to finish a bottle. So many better Belgian strong ales to choose from.

10099,1180,BeerTruth,3.48,"Poured a 12 oz. glass into a snifter.  This beer poured a clear reddish amber hue with a thick off-white head that died down pretty quick. Lace in this brew is quite weak, little to none throughout. Smell is of toasted raisins with a bit of fig, very malt-like scent with a subtle hint of alcohol. Taste is malty, with a bit of a hop undertone. A bit of caramel seems to appear with the raisin/fig flavor following up. Carbonation is weak, with a high drinkability for an 8% abv. Unique beer I must say, but Dogfish is known for that. Pick this one up if you enjoy trying something new, definitely worth a try.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Belgian Dark Strong Ale,83
10099,1180,JayQue,3.58,"Wasn't that impressed. It had Belgian-like aspects to it, but without the complexity. Seemed a bit too sweet and the alcohol was noticeable. Poured a nice mahogany and amber color with a large off-white head that faded quickly to a ring. Didn't notice much lacing. Smell was about average for a big beer, certainly didn't match any of the few Belgians I have tried. The taste was ok, definitely knew it was a Belgian style, sweetness, maltiness, a somewhat astringent quality and dark fruit...the label says raisins. The sweetness was not balanced against anything like the variety of flavors experienced with several sips of a good Belgian. Mouthfeel was rich. Drinkability about average. The sweetness and lack of variety got boring....not a beer I would be tempted to drink 2 of at a session.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Belgian Dark Strong Ale,83
10099,1180,joeysmokedporter,3.65,"Served in a pint glass on draft at DFH's Gaithersburg restaurant. Appearance was a dark reddish brown with some head. Aroma was complex raisiny/spicy, with Belgian ale yeast evident. Taste reflects the aroma, with the raisin flavor distinctly present along with the Belgian character, balanced toward the sweet side with little hops detectable. Feels a bit heavy on the palate even for a strong Belgian; perhaps an effect of the sweetness. Not a bad beer but not my favorite from this brewer.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Belgian Dark Strong Ale,83
10099,1180,jbsteiny,4.01,"A beautifully colored beer (the label calls it ""deep mahogany""), with a thick off-white head initially but little retention. Shame. Smells magnificent: my first thought is rum raisin. Malt heavy with bits of toffee, dark fruit, and a touch of grassy hops. Layered taste with alcohol notes (though it doesn't taste like 8%), the dried fruit and caramel. It could use a little more bit, in my opinion -- it ends too syrupy. But for the style, it's very drinkable. I could split a six-pack before I realized how loaded I was. A nice take on the Belgian dark by the boys at DFH.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Belgian Dark Strong Ale,83

Smells slightly roasty, sweet, dark fruits with tons of raisins. Taste is sublime for a Belgian, slippery sweet, the raisins stand out in a nice way, complimenting the candy sugar very nicely. Carbonation is at a minimum letting it slide down very easily. Very nice brew that is easy to drink. Goes down very nicely with some sharp cheddar and olives.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Belgian Dark Strong Ale,83
10099,1180,cooter,4.43,"Truly a fine, fine beer. Its head is a thing of poetry: ephemeral, shifting, wispy and sensuous. Its height and hue actually varies across the surface; with darker, greener, browner, and more olive-green spots alternating across the pocked landscape of foam.  I've tried this beer and been disappointed with its smell...but today it is excellent. Alcohol, esthers, raisins, cherries, berries, raspberries, faint citrus, and more that my humble nose can't make out. NOTE: I believe my failures with this beer have been due to serving it in a pint glass--do not do this! Instead, use a goblet.  Feels smooth yet textured on the tongue, with no bitterness whatever. Creamy in both mouthfeel and flavor. Sharp, like brie, and subtle. Smoky--literally, tastes like good cigar smoke.  Excellent with olives, chicken, and savory flavors.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Belgian Dark Strong Ale,83
10099,1180,kdoc8,3.42,"I picked this up at the Willamette Market of Choice in Eugene, OR. It was wicked expensive - over $8 for a 12 oz bottle. It poured out a dark red/brown with no head and very little carbonation. It smelled fantastic - I was very much reminded of the smell of a Michigan berry wine - strong and sweet and fruity. The taste was something of a let-down though - it started out bitter and alcoholic - it didn't seem like a beer or a wine but more like a sweet liqueur. Very thick, syrupy, raisin or prune juice taste, with a bitter aftertaste. I found it kind of hard to drink - it was definitely different in both mouthfeel and taste from most other beers I've had.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Belgian Dark Strong Ale,83
10099,1180,Jmamay22,3.12,"Appearance - Pours a dark amber/copper color, but retains no head, which leads to no lacing, which is a bit disappointing.  Smell - Fairly muted smell of malt and raisin. A very slight whiff of alcohol.  Taste - Certainly taste the malts and alcohol. Less evident are the raisons and a bready flavor. Oddly, port like tasting. I have no problem with a sweeter tasting beer, but this sweet taste runs amuck with the alochol flavor.  Mouthfeel - A medium bodied mouthfeel that finishes dry.  Drinkability/Notes - Tastes too much of the alcohol. I feel as if I'm missing something with many other people enjoying this brew. Its unlikely I would give it another try.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Belgian Dark Strong Ale,83
10099,1180,rohrbachsfan,4.4,"Appearance: Deep reddish amber/brown color with a small head that disappeared into a light lacing on the surface.  Smell: Sweet and fruity. I swear I could actually smell the raisins.  Taste: Lots of complex layers of flavors. I tasted sweet malt and nutty flavors and subtle winey notes.  Mouthfeel: Creamy and prickly from the carbonation with a somewhat dry after finish. Warming sensations follow soon after.  Drinakbility: At first I wasnt sure I liked it, but its a very complex tasting beer and it grew on me. Goes down easily but packs a punch. Goes well by itself on a fall or winter night, but would definitely taste great with prime rib, roast beef, or a roasted turkey (could definitely take the place of a bottle of wine at the dinner table). This is probably one of the most interesting beers that I have tasted so far.

S- Sugar sweet really comes through with some rich raisin aroma, some other dark fruits, light hint of spices, and some rich caramel. T- Really big raisin flavor, sweet sugars, some grass or earthy hops that leave a light to medium bitterness lingering on the front and mid tongue, and leaves the mouth very dry with almost a hint of honey in there also. Some warming of the throat from the alcohol. M- Full body with low (maybe scratching on edge of medium) carbonation with a really dry finish to it from the raisins. D- I really enjoy this.

10099,1180,eberkman,2.56,"Served in a bottle at Biltmore in Newton Upper Falls, Mass.  Poured, like advertised on the bottle, a deep mahogany red (looks like my desk at work) with about a finger of off-white head with not a lot of volume retention, but at least a film stuck around for the duration.  Smell was pretty much malty notes -- caramel, molasses, darker fruits -- with a little bit of alcohol but not as much as I generally detect in anything billed as a Belgian strong dark ale.  Taste was, to be perfectly frank, disappointing. Just an overbearing, cloying, syrupy sweetness with no dryness or hoppyness to balance it out, other than occasional sour notes. I primarily tasted raisins. It was like someone mashed up my toddler's snack, bottled it and served it. Some traces of alcohol, but primarily just overwhelmingly sticky sweetness.  Mouthfeel was pretty thick with very little carbonation -- certainly not what you get from others filed in this category, like Ommegang or Trois Pistoles.  Drinkability was good for its ABV in the sense that it felt like more than one of these wouldn't totally knock you out. But in terms of taste, I found it way too syrupy sweet to tolerate more than one, if that.  Not representative of the style -- has it been mischaracterized on here? And a disappointing offering from the brewery that has blessed us with the sublime 90-Minute IPA.

10099,1180,BWH3,3.82,"12 oz bottle from a Goblet at 50 F  Appearance: Gorgeous deep amber, crystal perfect clarity. Topped by off white head with superb surface tension allowing it to cling to the glass and lace out above the beer. The head retention is not very impressive for pseudo-Belgian ale. In fact to obtain a head, a fairly vigorous pour is necessary.  Smell: Truly unique scent that only improves with allowing the beer to breathe and warm slightly. The aroma is of golden raisins with a sour note. I also detected an alcoholic scent as well.  Taste: moderately sweet, nonmalty. The taste is more delicate than robust. Some spiciness/tingling at the back of the throat makes me think a Belgian yeast strain was used. I do not taste the alcohol but certainly feel its warming effects. Appropriately no hops in the flavor. Taste is crisp and does not linger long.  Mouthfeel: More body than most Belgian ales, but oddly it runs quickly off the tongue. The carbonation is light. Certainly above average but the low point of the tasting when compared to the rest of the beer.  Drinkability: One maybe two at most. I enjoy splitting one of these with a friend when we transition from one beer to another. The flavor is unique and big enough to follow any beer, yet it does not impede your ability to enjoy the next round.

Taste: Different than anything I've tried. Almost sweet, but not. I tend to stick towards hoppy beers, but this one has my attention.  Mouthfeel: Beer hits the palate somewhat heavy, but finishes very smooth.  Drinkability: I was enjoying Raison D'etre while I was brewing a batch of DFH 90. It seemed appropriate.

Where is the  Roasted malts, sweet vinous fruit, rum soaked raisins and molasses dominate the nose with a bit of brown sugar kicking in the background.  A bit of nutty roasted malts, molasses and sugar makes a graceful entry giving away to a bit of sweet fruit and tons of fusel alcohol. An off-dry finish with more alchol and a bit of astringent off-flavors leave me wanting something else to balance on the aftertaste but only dry tannic fruit, wamring alcohol and a bit of malt answer - that's not what I was hoping for.  A great smooth mouthfeel is thrown out the window with tons of alcohol, odd astringent flavors, total lack of carbonation and a unpleasant dry finish - poor balance and lackluster taste don't provide much motivation to grab my glass for another sip.  This is a belgian strong dark ale? It's a poor one at that, balance is all off, flavors are lacking and artificial and alcohol is overwhelming and highly conspicious. DFH, this deviates from your norm, you let me down this time; if you want a truly good belgian strong dark ale then buy one from belgian, if you want to kick yourself for buying this and not something else then go with this DFH offering.

10099,1180,williamherbert,3.15,"Has a deep mahogany red (and yes it says on the bottle that it is a mahogany red). The light comes through nicely, almost a little too clear. There is a short-lived film of head that goes away quietly. Minimal carbonation.  Very strong and pungent Belgian smell, like a thick, sour sweetness. I can tell the hint of raisin, but probably only because the bottle warned me it would be there. Also has a very heavy alcohol smell, almost like liquor. There is a surprising smokiness that increases as the beer warms up.  The flavor is a very deep and dark malty Belgian, if that makes sense. It has the deep malt of a mild stout, but the Belgiany goodness comes through later. It goes like this: 1) Stouty malt taste, 2) Belgiany sourness. In that order. But the Belgian flavor comes through on the second wave, like a delayed reaction. There is also a roasted malt aftertaste that only shows up at the end of the party.  It feels thick at first, but upon swallowing it's clear that it's actually a bit watery. The apparent thickness, I realized, comes from the density of the alcohol. The pungency makes it feel thicker. I am a huge fan of most DFH brands, but this is not one of my favorites. It's adequate, but essentially a try-one-and-say-you've-had-one beer.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Belgian Dark Strong Ale,83
10099,1180,tempest,4.15,"I can see where some people might not get or enjoy this beer. It's called a belgian but it's different. But this is Dogfish Head we're talkign about here, of course it's different. Call it a belgian with a good american twist.  The flavor is rich and smooth, but a bit dry. There are hints of coffee-like roasted grains and brown sugar with mellow fruit flavors of grape and cherry to name a few. The moderate amount of hops used adds a grassy and earthy taste while expertly balancing the sweetness of the malt, sugar, and raisins.  Overall, if I see this reasonably priced, I will buy again. Really reminded me of red wine and I look forward to pairing this with dinner.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Belgian Dark Strong Ale,83
10099,1180,umustdrink,3.45,"A - Dark red color, clear. Head is light brown and settles in splotches. Beer is too thin to have any lacing.  S - Smell is on the faint side but I detect some darker malt details, some sweeter yeast notes almost like a dunkelweizen.  T - Bittery malts, with a few dark fruit notes. Taste is also on the watery side but there is a lovely dark coffee sensation aftertaste.  M - Too thin.  D - Lacking in taste, smell and body. If the taste was just intensified I would enjoy this beer a lot more...because it does taste good. I would also like to note that the alcohol is very well hidden.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Belgian Dark Strong Ale,83

Not a very strong smell. Taste is fruity with some brown sugar notes and the alcohol is noticeable. It tastes good but it is hard to pickup exact flavors. Mouthfeel is a little more thin than I would care for. I am indifferent towards this beer.

10099,1180,TheSarge,3.12,"This brew gives off aromas of sweet raisins and chocolaty fragrances. I even detect a slight coffee aroma too. It pours with a wet thin head that dissiaptes rather quickly into fine lacing. Just as the aroma, this tastes of chocolate and coffee. I don't detect the taste of the raisins in this brew until it warms up a bit. Overall a brilliant attempt at something unique.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Belgian Dark Strong Ale,83
10099,1180,malcontent,4.09,"Deep auburn, very clear body with only a thin layer of head and almost no lacing.  Green grape scent right up front with brown sugar and warm hop notes on the back end. Smells good.  Not nearly the raisin-bomb one might expect (the flavor is there, though). Instead, sweet malt flavors come to the fore which are in turn complimented by dark rye bread noets and a balanced hop finish. A slight twist on a solid ale which makes for great drinking.  Good smooth, creamy texture with just the right touch of fizz. Avoids being overly thick and for that, mixed with an ABV of 8%, it is exceptionally drinkable. Not sure what the Bros. had aginast this brew; perhaps DFH has tweaked its recipe since then.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Belgian Dark Strong Ale,83
10099,1180,Domingo,4.05,"Pours a medium-brown color with only a little head at the top. Look like a nondescript brown ale. Pours very easily as the head's kept to a minimum due to the 8% abv. Smell is sweet like brown sugar, but it definitely has the Belgian yeast zing. Flavors start brown sugar sweet, too but finish with a lot a fruit flavors and you can't mistake that yeasty punch. Tastes like it has some heat (alcohol) to it, but I wouldn't have guess it's as strong as it is. I'm not picking up the raisins necessarily, but the flavor's great regardless. For a beer of this potency, I'd have no issue drinking more than 2 of these in a sitting. I'm also not finding myself getting tired of the flavor, either. I really enjoy this brew. I think I might have a new beer to grab when I can't make up my mind. This gets a definite recommendation from me!",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Belgian Dark Strong Ale,83
10099,1180,DogFood11,2.38,"Poured into a tulip it forms an off white head that falls to a thin cover in little time. Light brown body with hardly any visisble carbonation. Not all that inviting.  Wow, this is an oddball thats for sure. I really didn't get what they were trying for here as its all over the map. First pull and my initial thoughts were powdered medicine mixed with water. Yes, there is alot more to it than that but that was my first impression. Syrupy and sweet. Slightly woody in the nose but doesn't translate to the palate. The finish is dirty and leaves a thick coating that nevery really leaves until the next pull.  Notes: While not horrible this is a mystery brew of sorts. There was a nice spiced segement but it becomes an afterthought as this medicinal theme and the covered palate that takes over and bungles it up.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Belgian Dark Strong Ale,83

Smell: alcohol, sweet fruit, brown sugar and raisins, maple syrup.  Taste: sweet plums and raisins, alcohol at front with hop bitterness at finish.  Mouthfeel: a little slick, little bit chewy, medium to full-bodied.  Drinkability: could drink more than one per session. Alcohol is not too overpowering. Beer seems fairly balanced. I would tend to believe this beer gets better with some age on it. Some time would probably soften some of this beer's harder unrefined edges.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Belgian Dark Strong Ale,83
10099,1180,RichThatchr,4.35,"I was thinking of finding a dubbel-style beer or one that tasted like that for the Colts-Ravens playoff game when I found this one at Shoreline today.  The first pour reminded me of the Westmalle Dubbel with its slight head and it brown shag-rug of bubbles that shook in the tall pint glass.The first look was very appealing and the taste was even better as I loved the sweet malty taste that pinched me with the hops at the end.  As the glass contents slowly declined, I thought only one thing could be possibly better than this: the same beer on draft.

A musty smell though was prominent- possibly too old? This one was bottled 7-21-06. Taste on the front very nutty- cashews, peanuts. Lots of malt character with a nice splash of hop flavor. Maybe the hops have mellowed a bit. I seem to remember it having more hop bite when I tried this before. Oh, can't forget the caramel sweetness of the malt. Quite good.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Belgian Dark Strong Ale,83
10099,1180,arguemaniac,3.4,"When I first tried this beer. I hated it, the tastes were too weird and it was simply too thick and rich (mind you, this was a time when I thought Grolsch, Newcastle, and Petes Wicked Ale were the Worlds best beers). But after months of expanding my palate, I tried this one again and, for a long time, it was my favorite DFH brew.  Now, unfortunately, Ive sort of gone back to not liking it anymore, but for different reasons; its been a while since I last tried it, and I have to say that I find to be thinner than I remember and just not as rich.  Still, its a solid brew with a good level of complexity. It features a fruity sweetness that is nicely balanced by some vinous, slightly oaky tartness. The alcohol is well hidden among the fairly thick, syrupy flavors.  Like I said, I dont like it as much as I once did, but its a pretty solid brew from a brewery that is still on the cutting edge (if only because of their other beers). Recommended.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Belgian Dark Strong Ale,83
10099,1180,sterstar1,3.63,Pours a deep red amber color with no head. The Aroma speaks of raisins and malts. The initial taste is sweet but has a slight (not hoppy) bitter bite as an aftertaste. It's pretty solid. This is the first of the six-pack I just bought and I'm glad after finishing this one that I've got five more of these beauties in the fridge. :) Dogfish Head makes some great beers and this one's no exception.

This is a beautiful rich mahogany colored beer with an off white head. I only really detect slight sweet malty aromas from it. This beer hits hard with sweet malt flavors and follows up with raisin aftertastes. For 8% alcohol, it hides the taste well and is incredibly smooth. Overall, this is a medium bodied beer with perhaps a bit too much sweetness, but it is great none the less. I like this beer and I get it often.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Belgian Dark Strong Ale,83

10099,1180,yelterdow,2.28,"This bottle was produced on 11/06/06, so we've got a fresh example here. Served at a few degrees under cellar tempearture in a Duvel tulip.  Appearance- Gorgeous color... ruby bordering on purple, as crystal clear as any beer I've ever seen. The head barely reaches an inch, then it reduces to a thin outside border along the iinside of the glass. Sporadic spots of lacing here and there. Aside from the nice color, it's just OK.  Smell- The smoky, tinny, metallic, undesirable nose hurts my eyes... it really isn't pleasant at all. I've never smelled Belgian beet sugar, but something about this aroma makes me cough and squint. Burnt insects.  Taste- The same interesting, yet off-putting character is right here on the palate just as it was in the aroma. Not to mention the alcohol... it's starting to become more noticable too. The ingredients used in this brew dominate in a heavy-handed way, with the Belgian sugar content way too much for my personal taste. Alone, this beer is extremely difficult to sit back and even sip.  Mouthfeel/Drinkability- In the mouth, the texture is extraordinary. Right away, it rolls and swirls with ease and grace... laughing in the face of everything harsh and undesirable about the beer thus far. I give DFH credit where it's due... always pushing the limits of what's possible, and staying true to its mission and purpose. I just am really having a hard time with this beer.

A bit of a tart apple like quality, with some sweetness and a finish that is a bit dry. There is also some creaminess noted as well.  Mouthfeel seems pretty good... this is a long beer, the flavors really linger.  This one seems odd to me.

Just a little dried fruit and caramel is present to add complexity.  In the mouth, medium-bodied and round, with subtle sweetness. Ends pleasantly dry and mouthwatering.  Coming from a wine drinker, this is not a ""winey"" brew. Its roasted character and relatively low sweetness reminds me more of a porter than your typical Belgian. As such, I think it should have broad appeal among beer consumers, and not just among Belgian aficionados. This is definitely not one of Dogfish's extreme brews.

Taste: Opens with a sweet, malty note, soon followed by complex, cognac-like flavors, undoubtedly from the raisins, and a yeast and earth-dominated finish. The alcohol is notable only via some vinous port-like notes. Remarkably complex, overall.  Mouth feel: Smooth and soft, although it seems a bit thin, I wuold have expected it to be almost syrupy.  Drinkability/notes: Wonderfully complex, without a doubt most pleasing during the fall and winter months. Would serve well as an elegant after-dinner beverage.

10099,1180,ojiikun,3.85,"This beer review is a bit of a departure from the norm for me. Normally I attempt to review as impartially as possible, but there is a story here.  After meeting Sam Calagione (Dogfish Head founder) and hearing him tell the story of Raison D'etre, I was intrigued. The whole purpose of this beer was to pair well with steak - to make an ultimate combination.  So along with two bottles of Raison, I purchased the nicest steak I could find and cooked it as simply as possible, and good 'n rare.  Poured from a 12oz bottle into an oversized red wine glass. Startlingly clear for a Belgian, but very dark with a fast head and persistant bubbles.  Smells very strongly of Beligian yeast and bright acids - even enough to tingle the nose a little. Mineral water and alcohol come forward when warm. Hints of black cherry and almonds.  Taste is wonderfully malty and rich, with sweet almond aftertones. Middle notes are apple cider and maybe raisins, but that might be the label talking. The hops flavour hits hard and bitter, well after the sip, overpowering the memory of the body.  Quite drinkable and smooth - no sticky residue from all the sweetness. Paired with the steak, you can take this down faster than you would most Belgians.  Sadly, I have to admit that this comes nowhere close to the 'ultimate' pairing, though. I would suggest having this one on it's own to fully enjoy the more delicte flavours - which are the better part.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Belgian Dark Strong Ale,83

Nose: Belgian yeastieness&gt;Citrus hop&gt;alcohol&gt;carmel sweetness malts, sweet raisins, dank-earthy herbs.  Taste: Starts off with a big semi-sweet, caramalized brown sugar and oak malted flavor with the classic belgian style yeastieness that rides underneath. Finishes with a delightful sweet and leafy hop flavor. TheMalts leave a bit of a sicky-sweet aftertaste.  MF: medium body, thick and rather syruppy with a decent smooth effect, but it's not without a decent crisp bite either.  DA: This is a very interesting take on a classic style that's hard to beat.

This beer has a fruity aroma. As the name suggests, raisins are present. It also smells spicy. It has a sweet caramel mlat aroma also. Some earthy Belgian yeast is also present.  This beer tastes exactly like it smells. Raisins up front. Some spicy flavor after that. It is slightly malty with a decent yeasty flavor.  This beer goes down smooth, leaving a dark fruit aftertaste. It is carbonated well for the style.  This beer might not be the best session beer out there.

Tastes of Belgium candied dark malts, raisins, caramel and a slight bitterness as you swallow. Only a faint alcohol warmth. Very tingly tiny carbonation in the mouth. A good BSDA, but not a standout one. I think they capture the Belgium Strong Dark Ale flavors and aromas by the addition of raisins rather than naturallly through a choice of malts and sugars.

But as it warms, and as you have more than one or two, more and more flavors become noticeable, red and white grapes, plums, dates, figs. This beer remains sweet with the Belgian beet suger always there, but the darker fruit flavors, and some hops keep it pretty balanced as well.

10099,1180,Onibubba,3.41,"This review is for a March 06 bottle. Poured a reddish tinted dark brown into a tulip. An inch of frothy head quickly falls back into the glass. Aroma is not so intense. Reminds me a bit of a Chimay Red or a Belgian Dubble. Not picking up any raison at all. Taste is more of the same. That spicey tast of a Dubble or even a Triple. A bit of bitterness hampers the drinkability - it just does not go along with the overall taste to me. Mouthfeel is fine, just the right level of carbonation for my tastes. Alcohol does not seem very assertive. Not bad, but not a first choice beer either.  Just for shits and grins, I followed this with a 2 year old (at least) bottle, notched 6 on the neck. The scores are for the fresh bottle. Appearence is the same as the fresh, but that's it. The smell is much stronger - you pick up the raisons in a bit of a spatlese bouquet. The taste also exhibits more of the raison/spatlese taste, but unfortunately the bitterness has been enhanced to almost an unshakeable sourness that is not at all pleasant. Mouthfeel and drinkability are also different. No trace of carbonation at all - very smooth and more like a port wine or a brandy. This is the second Dogfish I have aged over 2 years, the other being an Immort Ale. Both have taken on this smoother, more brandy like taste and texture.

There wasn't much head while pouring normally, so I poured it straight down the middle and got a small brown head the disappeared quickly.  Smells like raisins and sweet alochol.  Taste is very sweet, with a molasses taste and feel to it. Has flavors that reminds me of port and heavy alcohol. I'm very surprised this is listed at 8% ABV, it seems much higher, and it is not masked well.  Mouthful is a little thick, low carbonation, and quite a alcoholic bite at the end, that eventually warms your soul.  Drinkability is probably pretty low due to heavy sweetness and alcoholic aftertaste.  An interesting beer.

The taste of the raisons is ever so slight on this beer, but it is there. I would have to say it is well balanced with a nice sweet finish that lasts a while. It really sits well on the tongue.

10099,1180,xoqx,4.05,"I really enjoy this beer. I keep going back for more. It's almost an after dinner beer, and it's rather on the heavy side  it's just massive on several dimensions. It's a deep woody brown clear beer with a foamy head that has not much retention due to its high alcohol content. There is quite a lot in the smell and it's sweet and molassesy and thick smelling. There are spicy, cherry, nutty and caramelly notes in the nose. It tastes all at once toffee and bready and raisinesque with spicy hop notes throughout. This is a BIG beer. The finish is note as long and bitter as one might expect from such a huge beer and I suspect it's partially due to its serious sugar levels; it's just a very sugary finish leaving a candied sticky taste (but not a bad one) on the palate. I find this beer does well at 45 degrees as suggested but is also really great at 60 degrees. The mouthfeel is full and expansive and sticky.

Taste is good on this one. There is a sweetness throughout but the profile changes. Theres raisins, bread, brown sugar, and toffee coming through along with some spiciness from the yeast used. There's a slight touch of alcohol at the end that you can feel through a warmth in the throat. The taste improves as this one warms.  The mouthfeel is medium heavy.

Lightish-medium bodied, low carbonatoin, dryish finish.  This beer had its high points, but they were overtaken by phenolic aromas and flavors. I wasn't that impressed with this one.

At first sniff, it smelled of malty sweetness with not alot else happening (at least with my nose). But as the draught was drank, the sniffer detected a caramel sweetness to it...and even a hint of molasses.  The sweetness definitely came through on the tastebuds, but not much complexity. The drink was slippery on the tongue with not much fullness. A little more weight than thin. Not syrupy.  Very drinkable. However...maybe a little too sweet for me on a warm day.

The aroma is of raisins, a touch of green apple, candi sugar sweetness, alcohol, and some sweet malt.  The flavor basically follows the nose. There is some sweet malt with some sugar sweetness. There is a presence of raisins for sure. Usually when I pick up on a raisin flavor it is more of a vague dark fruit flavor but this is a bit more specific. The green raisins really leave there mark on this one. There seems to be a decent hop presence that kicks in right after the raisin flavor that lightens the whole mouthfeel and makes this more of a refreshing beer than it would be. There is a definate fork in the road where this beer could have been more of a barley wine style beer or a refreshing drinkable beer and it chose refreshing drinkable.

The predominant fruity flavours include, of course, the green raisins. The caramel from the toasted malts is also on the forefront. These flavours are balanced by grassy and peppery notes from the hops.  Mouthfeel This is a beer of substance. The sweetness of raisins and the malt mask the relatively high alcohol content. The spiciness from the hops is a nice counterpoint to the sweetness of the malts.  Drinkability Certainly nowhere near as drinkable as swill type brew.

Taste starts of with the figs, along with some raisins, leather, and cigars; then moves to a very delicate oaky scotch with a pruney finish. Light carbonation helps this brew out signifigantly.

10099,1180,SkeeterHawk,3.95,"Appearance: Pretty clear deep mahogany color with a 1/8"" head of off white bubbles. The head was pretty active maintained by the bubbles rising, but the bubbles stopped after a few seconds and the head fell to suit. There aren't really any bubbles rising, so the beer looks a bit more like a liquor with a few bubbles sitting on top.  Aroma: Rich fruity aroma with a noticeable woody component. Rich caramel malts make a large contribution to the aroma with a subtle roast. It has a really sweet undertone in the aroma with a bready aromatic that makes it smell a bit like a breakfast biscuit or some such.  Taste: The flavor is really malty and the roast is a bit bigger part of the flavor than I suspected from the aroma. There is a very prominent sweet caramel flavor mixes pretty well with the dominating fruit flavors. As the beer warms up a bit, there is complexity to the malt that I didn't pick up in the cold sample. It has a British malt like flavor and seems like it has some Amber malt and or British two-row malts. It is pretty complex, and changes as it warms. The alcohol is noticeable as some warmth late in the finish, but only adds a tad of spiciness to the balance in the beginning.  Opinion: This is a pretty good beer. It isn't my favorite as it is so sweet that it is a bit cloying. Dogfish is definitely extreme as this is the malt counterpart to their hoppy DFH90.

Then I tasted this beer. It was one of the best tasting beers I've had. Nicely balanced brew with maltiness, hints of chocolate, some slight alcoholic bitterness. The high ABV was completely hidden. I'd never guess this was an 8%'er. As the beer warms, the yeastiness begins to come through and I don't like it as much. So, my recommendation is to drink this cold and don't let it sit around.  Nice mouthfeel with a slightly thick aftertaste, leaving a flavor of cocoa on the palate. A dry finish.  Incredibly drinkable brew. I could easily down several of these in a sitting.

Smell: Spicy notes of dried fruit, sweet malts, caramel, and a hint of roastiness. Juicy fruitiness upon swirling.  Taste: Sweet caramel malts, sugar and fruitiness upfront. The finish is lightly spicy with a fruity tartness and light bitterness.  Mouthfeel: Low carbonation, medium-bodied, smooth.  Drinkability: Easy to drink with well hidden alcohol.

The aroma was of sugary malt and dried fruits like plums, raisins, and figs.  The flavor of beer had a sturdy, yet very drinkable malt backbone. It started with a well rounded caramel sweetness that progressed to a very light roastiness. And while the beer was malty, the addition of brewing sugars helped dry things out so it wasn't cloyingly sweet. The hops are there in the finish, but they've struck such an amazing balance with the malt that it's one continuous flow of flavor - Masterful melding.  The mouthfeel was rich and dextrinous. The carbonation was perfect and gave a nice tingle to add some offset to the malt.  And while this beer is classified as a Belgian strong dark ale, I didn't feel there was a flavor profile that made this beer patently Belgian. It certainly didn't have the signature Belgian fruity esters. To me it tasted like a blend of a Scotch ale and a Belgian dark, but that is in no way a criticism. Dogfish Head has made a business of breaking the mold when it comes to beer and this is simply an excellent beer that stands without the pretense of stylistic categorization.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Belgian Dark Strong Ale,83
10099,1180,FightingEntropy,4,"Served in a goblet at 54 degrees. Poured pretty hard, and the head flared up brief, light brown, and disappated almost immediately. Alcohol comes through strong in the nose and taste, masking any hop aroma. Malty taste, carmel notes. Beautiful shimmering ruby highlights at the edge of the glass. Overall a very good beer that I'd order up in a heartbeat.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Belgian Dark Strong Ale,83
10099,1180,SkullFission,4.56,"Contrary to what seems to be popular opinion, this is my favorite of Dogfish Head's offerings, having tried almost all of the beers they offer regularly, and a few limited ones.  The smell is very indicative of the green raisins used in the brewing process, though it is a little light. Not a very strong smell, but a good one nonetheless.  The taste is absolutely wondrous; the green raisin character comes through flawlessly, and the malts balance perfectly with it. I do, however, harbor a suspicion that this brew would be better off bottle-conditioned, as I always seem to enjoy it more after a particularly yeasty beer (In this case, after a Koningshoeven Quadrupel, with pita chips to cleanse the palate).  The mouthfeel is great, very smooth. The carbonation is there and perceptible, but it is not aggressive and has virtually no bite to it.  This beer is very, very drinkable for an 8% ABV brew. Only the malt flavor reminds me that I am drinking a beer. I could drink these all night if I were so inclined, or had the money. I tend to finish off a 6-pack without blinking an eye, and end up fairly drunk afterwards (This review is being written during my first, so no worries of it being tainted by inebriation).  All in all, this beer is great just for taste, or to get intoxicated as hell. A ""reason to be"" indeed.  EDIT: It is also worthy of mention that I had poured this into a crystal goblet prior to consumption, and did not drink it directly from the bottle.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Belgian Dark Strong Ale,83

Sweetly malty with some prunish, raisin and currant elements to the taste, and a faint flash of hop bitterness cleaning up a finish that might otherwise be too sweet. Almost creamy mouthfeel by some miracle, making this a shockingly quaffable beer.  Had a lot of doubts about this one going in, and was pleasently surprised by how much I loved it.

Carmelized brown sugar in the nose with some raisins. Taste is sweet, but balanced enough to finish bitter and dry. Raisins are much more pronounced in the flavor with slight alcohol on the back-end. Mouthfeel is average and the carbonation is nice. Not a summertime brew, but I am enjoying it after a very long day...just as good as on tap IMO.

Great appearance, a deep amber hue, very impressive look when held up to the light. When poured a light brown, dark reddish head is accomplished that sets up rather nicely.  As the lable suggests there is serious raisin scent that this beer puts off. At first I thought it was like a scam just to play on the words of its name, but one can definitely pick it up. A very sweet and spicey smell with a hint of cinnamon (I know that sounds odd, but that's what I'm getting).  The taste is interesting at first and I'd definitely stick to that ""sticky sweet"" notion as I kind of mentioned earlier. I felt like I was drinking a sweet roll or cinnamon muffin.  The texture was velvety and smooth, heavier than what the beer appears to be.  I had two of these over the course of a weekend and I really was hoping someone else would drink a whole one and let me know their thoughts, but no one would (interesting).  To be honest, I'm not crazy about this beer even though I know it is award winning. Too heavy on the sweet side for me.

Head is one finger of brownish-tan foam that fades at a rapid pace leaving a thin sheet and little lacing behind. Underwhelming so far. The nose hints at something better: grapes, dark fruit, sweet plums or raisins mask a faint but definite alcohol presence. Taste is quite a bit lighter and less sweet than the nose leads one to believe. Theres a moderate alcohol presence and light hops bitterness. Finishes with a bit of alcohol and a dry malty flavor. I was a bit disappointed in the taste. Mouth is on the borderline between watery and syrupy, a little too thin for me. Drinkability is not bad, but since overall the beer is nothing special, I wouldnt drink too many.  Overall: Not bad, but not my favorite. Seems a bit subdued.

Smell: A sweet, fruity smell is the dominant characteristic of this beer.  Taste: Wow, this is a very unique flavor. It's definitely sweet, that's for sure. The raisins they used in this brew are easily detectable, and give this beer its own charm and characteristic. This is a good dessert beer to sit and enjoy. No bad aftertaste at all.  Mouthfeel: Semi-full body that caresses the tonque. It has enough chew on it to be quite pleasant.  Drinkability: Very drinkable.

10099,1180,phisig137,3.97,"Pours a clear ruby brown with little head, that leaves behind a good amount of lacing. The aroma of this ale is huge to say the least. Malt sugars, caramel, raisons, and brown sugar are the prevalent smells. No alcohol present on the nose.  Flavor again is massive. Caramel sweetness, slightly burnt sugar, raisons, and a slight hint of roasted grains. There is also a faint hint of diacetyl alcohol, which oddly tastes good in the mix... the butterscotch flavors mix well with the caramel like sweetness. Despite being a sweet beer, the finish is slightly dry, with a long lingering tinge of roasted grain.  Mouthfeel is full and chewy, and drinkability is dangerously high. For being 8%, its hard to tell, and goes down easy.  I've yet to be disapointed with DFH... I really feel that thier line up is hard to beat.

The beer poured a redish bronze color with a nice off white head and good lacing. The aroma had some interesting fruit notes (raisins) and malts and belgian yeast that made for a perfect bouquet. The taste was a pleasant balance of the malty caramel character and the definitely present belgian yeast that makes for a very drinkable representation of this style.,Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Belgian Dark Strong Ale,83

Taste is a little bit sweeter and lighter than expected, but still amazing. Mild chocolate notes, fruit is fresher (grapes, cherries), with remaining elements of raisins and plums. Mouthfeel is very chewy and oily. Hops really show up in the moderately bitter aftertaste, which is actually a good counterpoint to the upfront flavour complexity.

When held up to the light this is bronze colored ale with maybe a little extra red to it.  Smell is sweet malty and bready yeast to the nose. Fair whiff of coffee aroma from dark malt and apple and grape aromas. Toffee, butterscotch and some scorched sugar aromas are also in this. Alcohol is detectable in the smell, but it carries pepper, roses and peach aromas to the nose.  Taste is sweet and a little bready at the start. A mild flavored ale the first thing that gets my attention is a little coriander and coffee and smoke flavor. Fairly malty but this seems a bit under flavored.  Mouthfeel is good.  This is certainly a drinkable beer but I really expected more from DFH. The flavor is just too mild for my tastes.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Belgian Dark Strong Ale,83

T - sweet, ripe, dark fruit flavors predominate, mixed with candy sugar sweetness and warming alcohol. Very sweet, hop bitterness and tartness follows at the end to attempt to balance this beer out, but sweet malt and sugar win out. Lots of interesting Belgian flavors here - raisins, plum, apricot.  M - surprisingly on the thinner side, but a medium-thin bodied brew. Carbonation is average. Sweet, sticky finish, although not overwhelming.  D - very tasty beer, if you like dark Belgian styles, definitely one to pick up and try. Despite alcohol content, I could drink a few of these in a night, no problem.

Poured into a weizen glass (just cuz I like weizen glasses, even though I don't like most wheat beers), it had the most beautiful rich mahogany color I've ever seen in a beer, with a SLIGHTLY tan, mostly white head. The head sorta disappeared after a sip, but a thin layer lingered around for a while (which I always find quite nice), not too much lacing though.  The aroma wasn't particularly impressive. Alcohol and yeast basically, it didn't have me too excited.  On the first sip I went ""Hey, I like this!"" Definitely can taste the raisins, some caramel notes, and alcohol presence. It reminded me a little bit of a milder version of Ommegang, actually. A few sips in though, the flavor seemed a bit weak for some reason, as if it were a bit watered down. I'm not sure why the first sip had me so impressed, but then eventually I started going ""meh."" Although when I paired it with a piece of sharp cheddar, the flavor seemed to improve again.  One thing I will definitely give this beer a ton of points for is the mouthfeel. It has the cleanest finish I've ever even imagined in a beer. Not a hint of lingering bitterness or dry-mouth feeling whatsoever. I've never had a beer quite like that before.

Very light tan head, not much formed on the pour and only left a ring around the glass with a skimming of bubbles on the top.  I think this smells really good although varies a bit from the typical aromas of the style. Sweet and inviting. Tons of complexity at the temperature I have it at. The golden raisins are definately present along with some unripe plums. Sugary sweet but still has an earthy, nutty malt undertone. Sweet alcohol rears its head as well. Unique.  Taste has some darker fruit aspects, raisins again, but more of the dark variety. I think the beet sugar is obvious to, its a more pungent dark brown type sugar as opposed to the sweeter candylike sugar used in most Belgians. A bit of earthiness again comes in with the malts. Finish has a typical Belgian twang, most likely from the yeast. An alcohol twang (sorry for the use of twang more than once) is present as well. Overall a good flavor but has this twangy, funkiness that is a little to forward. I think its a bit unbalance with its sweetness.  Mouthfeel is decent, medium bodied. Not much carbonation. Drinkability suffers from the twang and the hint of alcohol in the flavor, it makes this one a bit rough around the edges. A bit too sweet to have more than one.

It smells like raisins and Dimetapp. Like malted raisins and Dimetapp. I was surprised at how powerful the raisins were, and maybe thinking that I read the label a little too carefully.  Maybe I wasn't in the mood for what the beer was presenting, but I went right back to the label. This beer tastes like beet sugar, green raisins and medicine. And not in a good way. I hate to be so harsh, but I did not finish it. Mouthfeel was a little syrupy, but not uncomfortable.  After a half-dozen sips I figured I'd wait for some other time to try another bottle before reviewing it, but I'm not sure I want to drink another. I don't know where they're going with this stuff.

Smell is of cherries and syrupy chocolate with a bit of yeast thrown in for good measure. Overall though it's kind of medicinal. Taste is along the same lines except richer and more balanced. Cocoa seems to round out this one with dark malts and a faint hint of cherry tartness mixed with a dulling raisin character.

I know the Dogfish guys like taking risks, so this is something different by far.  The beer itself is a little thicker than I expected; it's relatively filling. The taste is very unique. I'm not sure that I can specifically taste the green raisins, but the taste is different. It goes down smooth and has a nice mouthfeel, but as I said, it's a little filling.  The 8% ABV is masked well by the complex flavors present in this beer.

Drinkability - Its tasty but I don't think I could have more than one in any one sitting. Its high ABV% and high carbonation made it difficult to really thoroughly enjoy.

10099,1180,beermanbrian,3.82,Deep mahogony color. Head falls to a thin ring around the glass. Smell of some dark fruits and some heavy dark malts. First impression when i take a drink is a crisp bite right up front. The taste that follows is an earthy taste. Alcohol gives a little warming sensation on the finish.

Taste is dominated by the caramel maltiness. Dark fruit and alcohol astringency still have a presence, but they are joined by an earthy, woody flavor and hints of spices.  Mouthfeel is medium with very little carbonation and a slightly oily feel.  In my opinion this is not a Belgian Dark, but instead would more comfortably fit under the Old Ale category.

The flavor starts off with sweet notes of caramel and maple syrup, along with grape, fig and plum fruit flavors, belgian yeast, candy sugar, floral and herbal hops, toffee and honey.

Sweet, raisin flavor to the malt; there are supposed to actual raisins used in the recipe. Similar to Arrogant Bastard, but sweeter and more mild . An approachable beer.  Feels good on the palate.

Abundant effervesence inside that deep mahogany body. No real lace forming as the glass emptied.  Smells bring to mind figs, raisins, and brown sugar. Aromas are pretty laid back.  A woody flavor hits the tongue first, and makes me think this would be best as a deep-winter drink. The 8% alcohol is there but not cloying, very much warming and cozy. There's also a slightly burnt flavor happening, with dark fruits giving some sweetness to the huskier sensations. A speaking of sweetness, this one has a weird sweet element, like the bittersweet flavor of brown sugar melting on the tongue.  I appreciate the uniqueness of this ale, but I've had about 4 or 5 in the past couple years and they always impress something different upon me each time. So I guess you could call this one elusive and/or complex. Still haven't put my finger on it.

Burgundy color with short head and bell-clear body disguised only by lots of carbonation Nose is sweet and malty with caramel and chocolate flavors. Flavor is strong in alchol and heavy malts which don't detract from the former taste. Texture is silky but also oilier and slightly lighter than I'd like for a Belgian. Still, this isn't a bad interpretation of the style but needs to give its alcohol a little more cover.

10099,1180,oolite,3.66,"I am glad I bought a 6-pack of this, because I have had a slightly different impression of this beer on each successive bottle.  I first tried this in an oversized wine glass, but had the rest in a chalice - not much of a difference. Even with a fairly vigorous pour I was not able to produce virtually any head, which was a bit disappointing. The color looks similar to a bock until you hold it to the light and see that it is actually a bright red.  The nose had strong bread notes for me; sort of a slightly burnt crust. I do not recognize any grape/raisin notes, despite the intention - in fact, most bocks have much more present raisin notes. Alcohol flavor is also strong.  Despite these criticisms, it is a nice belgian style dark ale. The rich malt character comes through in the end, with just a slight bitterness, which gives the beer its ultimate strength.  As far as mouthfeel and drinkability, it is fairly heavy and fairly strong - not atypical of its style.  Definitely worth a try, and I appreciate the inherant adventuresome quality of Dogfish Head.

The taste is refelctive of the smell, with rich malt, and raisin flavour.  Hop, bitter aftertaste that gives way to mild alcohol burn.  Very well done.

It is close. the beer is sweet, and roasted malt notes are very notable. A strong taste of almost sugary sweetness dominates the initial taste. Maybe some hoppy notes with that or maybe some adjunct this beer might have (not sure).  the aftertaste is very sweet. it fades into a malty finale. this beer isn't a complexity giant but the taste is fabulous and it is very drinkable, and at 8% as well!

10099,1180,Tupperwolf,4.15,"Had I know that this was supposed to be a Belgian Strong Dark, I would have poured it into a more appropriate glass; But, seeing as the only thing DFH sees fit to say about it is that it's mahogany and brewed with a bunch of weird stuff, I went ahead and poured it into my curvy thick-bottomed DFH pint glass.  It pours a deep, almost chocolatey brown with a yelllow-tan head that stands over two finngers high, and falls over a couple of minutes.  Now the smell actually is somewhat Belgian, with a bit of wackiness thrown in that I can't help but subliminally attribute to the add-ins used when brewing. Belgian yeast alcohol, apple peels and dark fruitiness - then a light cocoa powder or roasty caramel smell. I'll let it warm some.  Now, it really might be my imagination, or this really does taste like grapes. DFH uses green raisins in the brewing, and I am sure I can taste them. The flavor hits with a blast of fruit sugars, like crystallized pineapple in trail mix - fruit, but condensed to the bare minimum of sugar and flavor. Quickly, it bitters up, balancing itself nicely, with a roasty-flavored middle and a light, lemony-citrus finish of hops. The finish is dry and delectable, leaving behind just a little sweet alcohol.  I think the mouthfeel is the best part. It begins very smooth and uncarbonated as you let it into your mouth, but a little agitation fluffs up lots of hidden bubbles; Swallowing sends a wonderful warming of alcohol all the way down - my belly is nice and warm! It's got a very dry finish save that little bit of flavor left behind - just flavor, no sensation of stickiness.  Would I have another?

Compared to the aromas, the flavor is rather straightforward and plain jane. There's a strong sweetness throughout with interesting hints of fruit and dark rum. The drawback is that it's almost too smooth--the sweetness needs a greater dryness, spiciness, or bitterness to match it and add less cloying length to the beer.  This is a interesting and easy-to-drink brew for something so strong. I'm going to try and cellar a bottle or two to see what happens in the next few months.

Aroma is mostly sweet booziness -- dates and dried figs soaked in rum, but mostly just a vapor of alcohol. Prickly sweet alcohol flavors at first; cherries, prunes, and date sugar sweetness. A vanilla-marshmallow taste is also detectable. The finish is a pleasant toasty malt flavor -- unexpected and appreciated. Mouthfeel is definitely the strong point here: full, expansive, briefly fluffy, then chewy, and overall, at once both effervescent and smooth. Such a complex mouthfeel is always a high point for me.

""A deep mahogany ale, brewed with Belgian beet sugars, green raisins, and a sense of purpose.""  And in case anyone was wondering, Raison D'Être is a term for a sense of purpose. Literally translated from French, ""reason for existence,"" or something like that.  OK, enough pretentiousness. It pours a deep, rich mahogany, good enough for Ron Burgundy's apartment (sorry, couldn't resist). Head is thin and white and doesn't get comfortable.  Smell is weakly of alcohol. Palate is same with undertones of dark malts, and dates/raisins. The alcohol is pretty dominant. Afterwards, a creamy sensation lingers, which I happen to like.  Not what I expected, but I'm not complaining. If I have one complaint, it's that the alcohol is pretty obvious.

Poured crystal clear reddish brown in colour with a monster slightly off-white tightly knit head which seems to be hanging around. Very nice sticky lacing. Looks fantastic. Has a damp, musty smell to it. Slightly raisin like. Not as good as I'd hoped, but definitley isn't offensive in any way. Taste is a bit sweet with a bit more raisin in the taste than was present in the smell. As this warms, the alcohol becomes ever so slightly more noticeable, but not overpowering. This is quite good, so far. The mouthfeel is fantastic!! Great weight and exquisite level of carbonation. I hesitate to hand out a 5.0. Just wonderful. Drinkability, while good, is still limited to 4.0 at best. This is starting to cross the threshold into ""big beer"".

It really reminds me of a wine. You smell the sweetness of the raisin, but I'm also getting some citrus fruit as well maybe grapefruit...nice sweet malts...delicious...  The taste is sweet with fruit and malt at the forefront. I am really seeing the sweet raisin, but I even pick up some of the citrus as well in the body. Right before the finish you get light hops, as well as a little alcohol taste....the alcohol is very mild...I think the alcohol gives it just the slightest bit of a bitter after taste(almost non-existant). The fruit helps to hide the the alcohol very well.  Mouthfeel/drinkability: On my last beer run out of state I bought this blind.

The taste is a malt dominated sugary sweet rush with hints of the aformentioned butterscotch as well as an interesting banana/raisin finish.

There seems to be very little hop character at all. Just a dash of hop flavor on the finish. It's a strong and sweet biscuit or bread flavor that dominates. There's a sweet caramel hint in the background too. Doesn't seem to be particularly complex. The flavor is just dominated by the sweet malt. It's not particularly bad, but not really notable by any means. It seems to be getting worse as it warms though  Mouthfeel is fairly creamy. Medium to heavy bodied. There's just no balance though. It's all sweet and all malt flavored. I prefer a good contrast of sweet and bitter and a more complex mix of flavors.

10099,1180,jslot38,4,"Presentation: 12 oz Bottle into an American Pint Glass  Appearance: Deep transparent mahogony with amber tones, an off white / egg shell frothy top covering head. Lacing is non existant... however, this wasn't really expected with the abv level and lack of hops.  Smell: Deep roasted malts, nuts, touch of smokiness. Candied sugars similar to classic belgian dark brews.  Taste: Great level of sweetness. Sugars up front rounded out by deep malts. No hop presence, with the exception of an oily slickness rushing through the earth flavour touches. Molasses, touch of vanilla, ground coffee malts back up the beer.  Mouthfeel: Carbonation level is high, and the sugars really create an onrush of that spritzer feeling.  Drinkability: Couldn't drink too many of these... a little too sweet, and pretty high in abv, although you can't really taste it.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Belgian Dark Strong Ale,83
10099,1180,lackenhauser,4.32,"Very nice deep chestnut brown color. Aroma of malt, Belgian yeast. Somewhat sulfury. Traces of raisens and dates. Big malty flavor. Some bitterness. Sugary, slick sweetness. Slight alcohol presence. Plenty of body though still retains a mellow softness. A damn fine beer. Batches seem to vary at times in flavor or consistency but I have enjoyed this one since it first came out. In my all round top 10 for sure.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Belgian Dark Strong Ale,83
10099,1180,TheBungyo,4.28,"Yum. This pours red from the bottle, almost scarlet. A tight creamy looking head caps it off. It begs you to drink. This smell is so complex I don't even know how to begin but to say it has a fruity sweetness to it. The taste is sharp fruit, like pears or white grapes followed by just the smallest hint of grain. Me? I love it. The mouthfeel is nice and creamy, something I feel like I could drink for days. This is one complex brew. It may not be perfect from every angle but it covers enough bases to be irresistable. I will buy this again and again. Its even better on tap!",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Belgian Dark Strong Ale,83
10099,1180,lordofthewiens,3.4,"I'm reading the label on this beer and thinking I'm not sure I'm gonna like it, so I was probably prejudiced from the start. It was a nice brown beer with a thick coffee-colored head. It had a fruity molasses smell to it, and a very sweet fruity taste. It looked robust, but was rather bland. Still, fairly pleasant to drink.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Belgian Dark Strong Ale,83

10099,1180,clabaugh,4.44,"Appearance: Clear cherry with brown hues. Pasty white head that dissipates rapidly. Lacing is watery and impermanent.  Smell: Oak bark, roasted nuts. Roasty, roasty, roasty. Bready malts, honey, and some coffee bean. Vinous fruits reflecting a steady hop presence.  Taste: Baked bread, syrup, and more grape than raisin. Spice and sweetness. Some floral hops. The malts are dominant, with the hops being a sidenote. Coriander, nutmeg.  Mouthfeel: Smooth and lightly syrupy. Displayed a thickishly rich body. A lot of zest on the tongue.  Drinkability: Despite the high ABV, this proved to be a very drinkable beer. Rich, often quizical taste that really keeps you guessing. Fine craftsmanship. Highly recommended.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Belgian Dark Strong Ale,83
10099,1180,loren01,3.49,"A: Beer pours a reddish mahogany color with slight whitish head that dissipated rather quickly. S: Had a funky metallic smell, not really in a bad way or anything just kind of a sharp aroma. Other than that it smells sweet like raisins/dates. T: Tastes of dark fruits (dates/rasin), you can taste the alcohol pretty easily as well. For the most part just malty, not much hop spiciness to it that I noticed. M: Very mellow, goes down real easy. Slightly dry finish. D: Very interesting beer, never heard of one brewed with rasin before. Goes down very easily for being slightly high in ABV, would recommend for sure.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Belgian Dark Strong Ale,83
10099,1180,VoodooBrew,4.04,"True to style, this beer starts off with a complex aroma, featuring a rum-like sweetness, along with pit fruits and pineapple.  True to name, the flavor starts off with raisin, followed by a maltiness that doesn't seem to linger very long, and then tropical fruit. Raison D'etre finishes neither too tart nor too bitter. If anything it falls slightly on the tart side.  Raison D'etre might be just a little too fruity for my tastes, but overall it's another quality entry from DFH.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Belgian Dark Strong Ale,83
10099,1180,heyitsbyron,4.42,"Poured a single from Woodman's in Madison into a tulip glass.  Poured a pretty red chestnut color with a very minimal head that left an oily foam slick on the top. Visually, it was a browner version of an imperial stout.  Smelled sharp and sour, but in a good way. It said something about raisins on the bottle, and I can definitely smell those. Smelled like boozy raisins, a mild wine.  Taste was good but I don't have much to compare to since this was my first Belgian Ale. Sweet, malty, boozy and a little bit more hoppy than I expected. Fruity, but not as deeply so like an imperial stout, which I guess makes it just a little less ""flavorful"".  Slippery at first in my mouth, and then kind of a lingering stickiness. Not a bad at all, but something I didn't expect. Perhaps too much sugary fruit in the brew?  This reminds me an American brown ale without any nutty component. A touch pricey and hard to find but I'd swill these all day long if I could. Goes down easy, but provides a pleasant lingering element that prolongs satisfaction. Lots of booze is always a plus. It comes strongly recommended from me though it's unlike any beer I've had before.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Belgian Dark Strong Ale,83
10099,1180,Gagnonsux,4.22,"Raison D'Etre is a dark reddish brown with a small, off-white head. Retention is pretty weak. Aroma has plenty of Belgian sugary sweetness with an edge of fruity yeast. A tiny trace of alcohol is also noted. The primary taste is of mild, dark fruit malt meeting Belgian sugar. An earthy, almost burnt malt flavor is also present. A spicy, peppery yeast flavor weaves nicely through the dominate malt. The overall complexity here is quite nice, there is quite alot here to enjoy. This is one of my favorite Belgian-styled beers of the few I've sampled.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Belgian Dark Strong Ale,83
10099,1180,akajimmyd,3.97,"Appearance  Deep rich copper. No real head or lacing. Clean and not cloudy.  Smell  Bready malts and sweetness. Hints of dark fruits.  Taste  The alcohol comes through fairly strong. Dark fruit, maybe raisins, but that a bit of a reach. Some big malts. Candy or caramel sweet.  Mouthfeel  Sticky sweet from the sugars, almost syrupy. Still it feels rounded and not overpowering. Many different flavors and textures.  Drinkability  I really like this one. Good drinkability given the high ABV but it will catch up to you. Interesting and enjoyable even if it is not the most classic interpretation of the style.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Belgian Dark Strong Ale,83
10099,1180,geexploitation,2.92,"Like a lot of the Dogfish Head stuff, this is one weird beer. Pours the color of burnt caramel, with a decent head that fades quickly. The aroma is full of overpowering candi/beet sugar, with just a hint of golden raisin that comes through for me only with some very deep inhalations. Someone else actually pointed that out to me; the candi sugar is really, really strong. The taste follows up, with lots of sweetness and some fruits in the background, though they're once again overpowered by the sugar. The mouthfeel is syrupy; it sticks in your mouth and lingers for a while. Had to rinse with some water before trying other beers. This ain't a beer you want to drink a lot of. One, once in a while, and done. Dogfish Head beers are often like this: interesting to try, but not necessarily something to keep going back to. It's a good thing for them they've got the 60- and 90-minute IPAs...",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Belgian Dark Strong Ale,83

Warming and complex, it fits the bill nicely as Winter blows its last gasps here on Sandy Hook Bay.  Pours a dark ruby with a short-lived off-white head,  Aroma of malty sugars, dried fruit and candy.  Taste is vinous, alcohol medicine fruity yeast and some dry hops.  Mouthfeel is medium with a subtle stickiness and a short dry finish that can be re-kindled by swirling your tongue around your palate.  Drinkable? I think so, and I am going to grab one for a night cap.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Belgian Dark Strong Ale,83
10099,1180,Dukeofearl,3.27,"I bought a sixer of this almost exactly a year ago, and just did not like it at all. I decided to experiment, and put one away to see if some time made any changes. So here is my review of a 1 year old 12 oz bottle.  Pours a medium reddish brown, fairly clear, with virtually no head or carbonation. The end of the pour surprised me with a huge slug of yeast/sediment.  Rich aroma of brown sugar molassas and maple syrup. Definite raisin profile.  Flavor is much more mellow than a year ago. It originally was a huge syrupy chewy beer that had no interest to me at all. Alcohol at the end was way too strong. Now, the alcohol profile has mellowed dramatically, the raisins dominate, and some sugary sweetness remains. The end of the swallow now has almost a sour Flemish Ale woody/cherry bite- much improved. Still an alcohol ending. Chewy mouthfeel is still present.  Based on my original thoughts of this beer, I thought nothing but bad. After a year, it has improved greatly. But it still is to me only an interesting diversion.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Belgian Dark Strong Ale,83
10099,1180,CortexBomb,3.77,"Pours deep, ruddy brown and amber into my goblet with a slight, white head on top. Smell is mainly fruit esters, lighter fruit scents...then almost raisin effects.  Taste, starts out sweet and then turns into a full tongue dark fruit caress. The raisins from the smell seem to be heading up the dark fruit flavour. There are also sugary tones in evidence and the lightest hint of spice lingering in the background. The finish is the only place the alcohol is really evident, as a minor burn is in evidence. Not bad.  Mouth is decent, not a lot of tingly action, but this is pretty full bodied in the mouth. Drinkability, solid as well. Belgian style beer is usually easy to put down, and this is no exception.  Overall a solid Belgian style beer from Dogfish. It's not as complex as some of my favourites, but it is an easy drinking, smooth flavoured beer that is enjoyable in the mouth.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Belgian Dark Strong Ale,83

A nice sweet fruity smell. I read before, and i have to agree, i get a grape bubble gum aroma to this. I also get some apricot and roasted sugar smell, like roasted marshmellows.  Tastes nice. not exactly as sweet as i expected, but is malty. I do get an artificial grape flavor to this. seems a little peppery. not a bad flavor though, certainly a nice change up to the style.  Mouthfeel is good. Nice carbonation and a good balance.  Overall an interesting beer. Not, by any means, a prime example of the style, but i think this one should get a lot of credit.

Smell is mostly bubble gum and raisins. Actually smells like a rum raisin ice cream I had after dinner tonight. No hops are really detected. Mostly malts and the aforementioned raisins.  Taste is more of the same. Sweet, alcoholic. Bubble gum.  Creamy and smooth mouthfeel with a medium to heavy body. Very pleasant drinking 8% beer.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Belgian Dark Strong Ale,83
10099,1180,WMBierguy,3.7,"This beer was labled as ""The best beer of 2005"" at a local beer shop. That piqued my interest. The label stated that it was brewed with Belgian beet sugars and green raisins (that's definately not passing the Reinheitsgebot!). The beer sounded pretty unique, so I decided to try it. The biggest surprise, however, was that this tasted pretty much like any other ale that I've had. What makes it impressive is that it's 8% abv. You can't tell that by taste (I didn't even realize it until I looked it up here). A very drinkable beer when you consider that it's stronger than Colt 45! Try it if you can find it.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Belgian Dark Strong Ale,83

What better way to break up a losing streak than to look to Dogfish?  This BSD Ale was just what the doctor ordered.  When pouring this ale I noticed a syrup consistancy to it. I knew right then that this was going to be something special. There was a slight alcohol smell to it but it was accompanied by raisin and sugar notes.  Taste wise there were grape, sugar (brown) and some alcohol notes to the ale. They blended together nicely and seemed to compliment each other well.  If you are looking for a complex and sweet tasting beer that challanges the palate then put this one on for a try. You will be glad you did!",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Belgian Dark Strong Ale,83

Maybe some very mellow goldings or fuggles. A bit of sulphur? I could be making that up.  Taste: ah, there are the esters. Attack is a nice rounded malty sweetness, followed by subtle bready/malty tastes. The alcohol makes an appearance in there somewhere, but it's not ""hot"" for an 8.0.  Mouthfeel: a little thin considering how bold the tastes are; feels somehow insubstantial. Carbonation burns a little at the end, but again I just don't feel the high alcohol.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Belgian Dark Strong Ale,83
10099,1180,DarkerTheBetter,4.32,"When this beer poured in to my glass, I first thought it looked like fresh engine oil that was very clear and a brownish gold. But, in my glass, it took on a dark cherry amber. The head consisted of small gold bubbles that fell to mere wisps of foam that were sustained by tight lines of miniature bubbles crawling up the sides of my glass.  Smells of green grapes, prunes, brown sugar, a slight musky smoked malt and a slight pervasive sourness with a touch of alcohol.  Tastes much smokier than I had expected. There are some sweet fruit flavors around the edges of my tongue like green grapes and plumbs along with a citrus sourness, but the flavor is dominated by a woody, brown ale-like malt with a bit of chocolate mixed into it. The yeast makes itself know in the finish with a dry bite. The finish also releases some smooth fruity sugars.  Mouth feel is light with an intense small bubbled carbonation.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Belgian Dark Strong Ale,83
10099,1180,burnstar,3.8,"Pours a deep amber/red with niced thick white head that dissipates quickly. Aroma is very sweet, fruity, and a bit yeasty. Taste is extremely sweet initially with malt and fruit flavors. There is also a distinct tart flavor present and just a bit of bitterness in the finish. It is full bodied and somewhat syrupy. This beer is quite good but it's a bit too sweet for me to drink any more than a single bottle at once.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Belgian Dark Strong Ale,83
10099,1180,dalherring,4.65,"I have had this both on tap and from a bottle, and it far better on tap. It has a rich amber color with a creamy head. You can smell the fruity aroma which is like unto the Corsendonk Abbey Brown Ale and the Chimay Rouge. The alcohol content is high, which can be tasted and felt immediately, but this brew will disarm you with its remarkable smoothness.  I am a huge fan of Dogfish for its fine microbrews, and I dare say that the Raison D'etre is its capstone. I love it's sweet, smooth aftertaste, and regard drinking it on tap as one of my favorites. It is hard to find in bottles, much less on tap. So if you do see it on a menu or in a cooler, indulge yourself.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Belgian Dark Strong Ale,83
10099,1180,Phatz,4.37,"Bottled on 11/15/05 and today is 1/10/06. Bottle reads ""A deep Mahogany ale brewed with Belgian Beet sugars and a sense of purpose.""  Served in my snifter glass at just above fridge temperature.  Pours a mahogany copper color that is barely transparent. Small one finger head (tight little bubbles) that disappears very quickly. Significant lacing.  Smell: I popped the cap and smack! Sugar! Smack! Raisins! The aroma stands right up and shouts notice me; before I even pour the beer. In the glass again I notice the brown sugar, sweet malts and raisins, calling for me to dive in.  Taste & Mouthfeel: Wow. Now here is a sugar kick! After the sugar/syrupy flavor, I immediately move on to notice the texture. I noticed how smooth the beer feels in my mouth. It is all sweet up front with sugar, malts and raisins. In the middle there is a subtle tartness that stands out. It is not blended with the sweet; its separate from it but serves to slightly tip the scale back towards the tart side, in a balancing effort. But at this point it is still the mouthfeel that is grabbing my attention. It's an interesting stickiness character that stands out about the mouthfeel. It has very minimal carbonation and is so smooth and syrupy, mmm it is a sweet treat. On the swallow there is a distinct wallop of tart flavor to the palate. The tartness hangs on for a few moments. As you lick your lips the tart fades and the sugar reemerges to finish off the aftertaste. DFH tends to make unique and extreme beers and this is no exception.  Drinkability: This is a great beer, and ONE goes down VERY easily. I have 3 in the fridge but this is a 'one at a time' beer for me. There is too much, sugar tart sugar tart sugar tart sugar tart; to be able to handle a number of them. It is too extreme to be sessionable, but quite tasty and an interesting experience. I would never have thought, raisin beer, hmm? I recommend giving it a try and see what you think.  Hope this is helpful.

It barely looks carbonated at this point, but is a warm amber color that smells great....fruit, vanilla, alcohol, malt. Taste is really complex...a lot going on here....sweet, just the right amount of alcohol, balanced with the raison, plum and malty yeast flavor. Mouthfeel is great...medium to slight syrupy feel...just a light carbonation. Perfect. Very drinkable; I always want more...but the 8%....depends on whether it's a weeknight or weekend.

10099,1180,jaluria,3.72,"A burgundy colored brew that remains somewhat translucent and has a nice head that leaves behind a bit of lacing. Aromas of plums, raisins, alcohol, and burnt sugar seem to come out nicely. The raisins were a bit unexpected for this style, but a welcome discovery. The taste is mild for this style with the interplay between fruity bitterness and specialized candy sweetness not as well as could be. The raisins definitely dominate the brew as it warms to such an extent, it detracts from the overall taste and texture. Though the alcohol was well concealed, when mixed with the raisins, it created a sour taste in my throat, hence the reduction in drinkability. Worthy of trying for it's unique take on this style.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Belgian Dark Strong Ale,83

It poured with little head that is now a fleeting white ring around the top of the beer.  Smell: The aroma of grapes and sugar are evident immediately. The grapes do not have a winey smell to them, making this beer smell unlike most any other beers you may encounter.  Taste: Grapes and malt are the dominant taste here. The sugars added to the ale are noticeable immediately upon sipping. After the sugars, the aforementioned grapes and malts appear and leave a lasting finish.  Mouthfeel: The ale sits very nicely on the palate. The combination of sugars and grapes give a somewhat sweet taste that lingers.  Drinkability: Very drinkable.

Smells somewhat of leather and vegetables, if that makes sense. Odd smell, to say the least. Not bad though, just not what I'd expect. A very warm taste. The alcohol is forefront, with a sweet tartness behind it. The ""green raisins"" used in the brewing impart a fruity taste. Mouthfeel is good, non-slick, smooth.

10099,1180,deBeers,4.13,"Note this is for an aged Raison D'etre that is a little over TWO years old. I had a six pack and shared five out of the six bottles with a few other people over Christmas eve.  This beer was made with Belgian beet sugars and green raisons amongst other things. Not all beers aged as well as others. The third beer opened was the star of the show. I'll review that one off the top of my head.  Poured with a finger, almost two of creamy light beige/off-white goodness. Lots of small bubbles with the initial pour and carbonation seemed to meld very well with the overall aspects of this concoction. Beautiful clear/light mahogany color and the carbonation died down to a beautiful swirling top that never really left the surface of your glass. Watching the lacing as you drank this was very beautiful and lively.  This was best served slightly chilled and letting it warm as you drink it. Aerating the glass helped mellow out the sweetness and bring more flavor and smells from this brew. Very tasty, almost smelled like green olives in a good way probably due to the raisins. Sweet brown sugar, crisp yet mellow carbonation.This ale was way to drinkable for 8% alcohol. I know this because I'm still feeling it a little from last night. Hi oh!  I will rereview this when I drink the last bottle alongside its fresh counterpart and do a proper review.  I recommend aging a few of these and although I haven't had it...I might just have to lay down this beer's bigger brother Raison D'extra.

10099,1180,kkipple,3.81,"Ok, before I go any further, ""Raison D'etre"" means, according to dictionary.com, ""reason for being"". I just learned a word definition on account of a bottle of beer. Wonders never cease.  So, Raison D'etre pours a rich looking rust color with a massive head that settles down to 2cm all round my goblet. Some lacing. Looks wonderful.  Smell is hops, yeast, fruit (white grapes?) and malt. Sweetness & alcohol round it off.  Taste: initial malty, aleish taste gives way to hops, mild bitterness, and a sweet brown sugar aftertaste. Yummy! Trying to taste the ""green raisins"" the bottle advertises, but can't. It's smooth and lightly carbonated. This is 8% ABV? Who knew?  Dangit though, I want to taste raisins! Alas, maybe the next bottle will come through for me. Ahh, it's beginning to warm my stomach. Might be the 8% kicking in.  I really enjoyed this one. Make sure you don't serve it too cold as you'll lose a lot of the subtle flavors. Raison D'etre is very tasty and complex, and I'd be glad to have one again.

Aroma: Fruity, almost vinous, some higher alcohol, malt in there somewhere.  Taste: vinous character, sweet, but not cloyingly so, mild alcoholic flavour, especially as it warms.  Mouthfeel: Thick enough to coat the vocal cords, but not so heavy that it's hard to drink. Carbonation helps to accent the complexity of the flavours.  Drinkability: By no means a bad-tasting beer, but would not be suited to long sessions because of its high alcohol content.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Belgian Dark Strong Ale,83

Smell: Plums, spices, lots of raisins, alcohol. The raisins really stand out in this one, I am curious how it will be in the d'extra.  Taste: Woody and sweet, grapes and raisins everywhere. There is also a slightly buttery flavor, imparted by the raisins, most likely. Hops and alcohol are present, but do not provide much of a bite, this is a smooth drinker.  Mouthfeel: Full carbonation, very creamy mouthfeel. Pretty much spot on for the style.  Drinkability: A good and interesting BSDA, but not among the elites of the style.

Had a pleasing light brown head that lasted only a few minuites leaving a nice ring around the outer edge.  I can smell a nice nut sent. Also some syrup maybe coffeeish with a very minimal hint of some type of fruit.  Tastes unlike anything I have ever had. The initial taste is a smokey wood taste. Gives off hints of molasses and coffee. But mostly a smoke taste.  Feels nice and hevy on the tounge. Goes down very smooth. This is a nice beer for the winter.

The smell first and foremost is alcohol, but what do you expect with a beer of 8%? It has a fragrance of fresh green raisins, grape and brown sugar. The malt is very apparent.  The taste reminds me of grape bubblegum and alcohol. Not a really balanced beer. I am not really sure what to say about this beer; it is a fairly crisp beer with a kick.  Well, this is not DFHs best endeavor, but it is not bad. DFH seems to have set the bar pretty high and it would be hard to make every beer a winner. I wouldnt suggest that you buy a sixer, just try it on tap if you can.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Belgian Dark Strong Ale,83
10099,1180,NiceGuyMike,4.45,"Dark amber with medium light tan head. Head clings to the side in a desparate attempt for survival, but is eventually beaten down. Light lacing remains as memorial. Smells a bit of figs, molassas (specifically brown sugar) and I guess rasins. Tastes similar with no one flavor dominating (well..perhaps the brown sugar stands out). Belgian yeast give it that Belgian quality of flavor, but again, not overpowering. Next to Allagash Odyssey I'll say this is the best Belgian Strong Dark Ale I've had. Full bodied with decent carbonation. So enjoyable, something to drink slowly and one to enjoy at home or without the need to drive.  Very sweet...no...extremely sweet, but in a good way. Dangerously easy to drink. Strong alcohol sneaks up on you easy. I went through two bottles without breaking a sweat early Thanksgiving afternoon. Wow, I must admit it hit me hard a few minutes after I finished the second bottle.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Belgian Dark Strong Ale,83
10099,1180,sinistermadman,3.51,"Pours a clear cherry color while producing a decent head. Smell is subdued, I can barely detect some fruit along with some malt.  Taste is different to say the least. A bitter twang resonates throughout the drink making it difficult to pick up on any constituent ingredients. It kind of tastes like water from an old lead pipe, but with chocolatey malt and a residual fruit note. This brew's body is smooth with a low to moderate carbonation. Mouthfeel is syrupy and sticky. Not terrible, but not desirable either. Definitely seems like a beer that I would have to try a couple times before I could figure it out.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Belgian Dark Strong Ale,83
10099,1180,sinistrsam,3.88,"Poured a red-amber color with a small tan head. The head quickly dissapated and left moderate lacing around the glass. I tried my best to really get my nose into the beer but it wasn't as aromatic as I had expected. Still, there were hints of some sweet fruits, yeasts and raisins. The taste began as a semi-sweet, crisp smack in the face but ended up finishing subtle but dry. Lots of flavor, lots of alcohol taste. It was suprisingly smooth, clean and refreshing, and balanced very well.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Belgian Dark Strong Ale,83
10099,1180,mynie,3.12,"Rather mundane pour. Off-burgandy, translucent with a small, quickly-dying head.  Semi-Beligan yeast mixed with solvent alcohol zing and spice. Decent strength, decent complexity. Nice, but nothing special.  Plums and raisins soaked in liquid tin upfront, followed by brown sugar, ending on alcohol zippitiness. Very complex, but not all that complexity is good.  Nothing impressive here.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Belgian Dark Strong Ale,83
10099,1180,nlmartin,3.1,Served from a bottle into a pub glass.  Appearance: This beer has a hazy ruby coloration. No head to speak of and leaves no lacing behind.  Smell: It smells like raisons have been added to an alcohol base. Malty goodness drifts by the nose.  Taste: This has got the funk. There is alot going on here lots of unidentifieable fruits. Some definate yeasty malty clashes. Doesnt taste bad I just cant tell what the taste are.  Mouthfeel: This beer is medium to full bodied with minimal carbonation.  Drinkability: An ok beer to try once or twice. Dont buy the whole 6.,Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Belgian Dark Strong Ale,83
10099,1180,DaPeculierDane,3.05,"This is another rather strange beer (Ive had a bit of a run of them lately). Its not quite dark enough and certainly not lively enough on the carbonation/head end of things for my tastes. I will admit, however, that it is rather drinkable considering the ABV.  The aromas are gummy or syrupy and consist mostly of caramel, raisons, and orange peal. The taste reflects this. Its also quite sweet giving it a rummy sort of mouth feel. By that I mean that the feel is a rough blend of sugar cane and alcohol.  Not terribly great but not bad either.  One note, I purchased a six pack of this six months ago and at the time, I cared even less for the beer then I do now. My taste buds may be playing a trick on me but the drinkability seems to have gone up considerably with the brief aging period as has the orange in the noseor maybe Im just more in the mood for this sort of beer this week. Who knows?",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Belgian Dark Strong Ale,83
10099,1180,waldowin,3.67,"Pours a deep ruby, with a thin white head that fades immediately to nothing. Looks almost like brandy in the glass.  Smells of toasted malts, raisins, and a hit of vanilla rum. Very faint.  Tastes of a thin cognac up front, with plums, grapefruits and a blueberry tartness.  Mouthfeel is smooth, but not thin. Almost no carbonation. Leaves a cognac-like acridness in the mouth as an aftertaste, leaving you ready for the next hit of raisin sweetness. This one seems a lot smoother and a lot more mellow than the last one I tried. I'm not sure if the last one was skunked, or this one was aged, but either way, it's good stuff. I'll probably try it again in the future.  This stuff is pretty smooth and fairly tasty, but I think 2 bottles would be my max for a night.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Belgian Dark Strong Ale,83
10099,1180,Foxman,3.7,"It pours a fundamentally clear lustrous amber. Two fingers of off-white head settles soon to a patchwork of thin froth. Hyphens of lacing punctuate the inside of the glass.  The aroma wafts a mellow malt sweetness studded with a fuzzy dried fruit tanginess. A distant creaminess, maybe vanilla, is mitigated by the sneaky aura of alcohol.  First sip grants a toasted malt, honeyesque sweetness, promoted by the rounded irony tang of raisins, sassy and briefly bright. There's a center of sugary candy sweetness which dulls very quickly to a vague hoppy dryness propped by a disguised but quite present stilt of alcohol. The finish is dry but carries a light memory of dried fruit. It's an interesting flavor, if a bit involved and at times disjointed.  Medium bodied, the presence of malt and fruit provide some toothiness, and a dry glow embers lightly on the palate.  It's got some muscle, not surprisingly, and the flavor, while rather segmented and busy, is also intriguingly unusual. The ABV is never glaring, but it becomes more apparent as the glass drains. It's reasonably drinkable, but common sense mitigates that a bit. It's a crafty, sly heavyweight, worth trying for sure.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Belgian Dark Strong Ale,83
10099,1180,pentathlete,3.7,"Pours dark brown with a beige head and quite a bit of lacing. Smell is dark fruits and a woody hit that must be from the hops. Taste was rather disappointing, a little hint of Belgian yeast and candi and then a vinous finish that seemed incongruous to my taste buds. Mouthfeel was full enough but I don't think I would want more than one. I've had these before and never have I gotten very excited about them.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Belgian Dark Strong Ale,83
10099,1180,joedon,4.1,"Dark gold-amber with not much head. Not much lace either. Just a little bit of haze.  Aroma of fruit, malt and sugar.  Big taste: lots of malt, toffee, raisin and fruit. Nicely balanced with hops. Flavor complexity almost like a barley wine but not nearly as hoppy.  Heavy body; very nice mouthfeel. Lingering aftertaste of malt and fruit. Alcohol buzz in the aftertaste, too.  I really enjoyed this beer. Nice sipping on an Autumn afternoon.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Belgian Dark Strong Ale,83
10099,1180,stcules,3.52,"Mahogany color. White foam, but scarce, and quickly disappearing. In the smell, beside the malt, there are vanilla, woody notes, and porto. A touch of rhubarb and red fruit (plum). In the taste the raisins, already intuible in the smell, it is definite and well present. Again porto and plum. Full and definite body. Liqueurous and sweet aftertaste, with dry fruit. Velveted and smooth.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Belgian Dark Strong Ale,83
10099,1180,rhoadsrage,3.75,(Served in a chalice)  A- This beer pours a deep mahogany brown crystal clear body with a thin film of light tan head. The bubbles are very sluggish at rising to the surface.  S- The smell of dark fruit and toasted malt with a hint of sweetness are balanced by a vinous and slightly hoppy nose.  T- This beer has a smooth light malt flavor with finish that is vinous with a hint of hops. There is not much dark toasted malt base or much complexity to the taste. It finishes with a hint of alcohol and a bitterness.  M- Medium-light mouthfeel with a fizziness that makes the mouthfeel appear more full. No astringency but some alcohol warmth.  D- This beer is dry and has some interesting flavors but it is missing a lot of complexity. The raisins and beets just don't have the complexity that are needed in the malt bill to make this a good solid beer in this style.,Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Belgian Dark Strong Ale,83
10099,1180,ElGordo,3.7,"Pours a deep amber with ruby highlights, topped by a half-inch of creamy tan head. Sweet nose of dark fruit, raisins, molasses, dark sweet malt, and a hint of both Belgian ale yeast and alcohol. Palate is understated at first - initially, the flavor almost isn't there. Some sweet malt, raisin, and Belgian yeast are present mid-palate, along with subtle notes of hops and dark wood. Some serious alcohol warming is present on the finish. Mouthfeel is nice and creamy, very pleasurable, then slgihtly dry on the finish. Packs quite a whallop, making it almost difficult to finish the bottle. Still, a pleasure to drink.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Belgian Dark Strong Ale,83

Taste is also very carramellic and chocolate, sweet carracter that hides alcohol content well. Still to me an overall very oxidated impression and could well be that this one was a litle over the top. Full and thick mouthfeel though that is enhanced by low carbonisation and feels like a thick soup. Low bittered but clean. Well drinkable but nothing special IMO.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Belgian Dark Strong Ale,83

Little to no head to speak of, not even a film on the surface after a few minutes of sitting.  Smells very curiously sweet. Perhaps it is the belgian beet sugars that give it the interesting [non-DMS] veggie smell. Has some rum characteristics in the aroma. Lots of caramel and grapes as well. Very nice aroma.  The taste has a bit of a biscuity malt profile to it, but the sweetness balances that out quite nicely, along with the fruits. Very refreshing for such a strong beer. Little to no hops detected. This is like drinking a juice, but it's still distinctly beer. Nice job DFH. I must try the D'Extra now.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Belgian Dark Strong Ale,83

The taste is not as sweet as you'd expect. The finish is actually quite dry. Even though I do not find alcohol too apparent, the bite is there.  Interesting try, but I don't find the mouthfeel to be very pleasant. Reminds me of spiked grape juice (which I dislike very much - that's about ""grape juice"" portion, I really don't mind ""spiked""). For me the value of this beer is in experimentation. I'll try it again if I see it on tap. Worth a try just for a taste of something different.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Belgian Dark Strong Ale,83

Taste mimics the aroma with mild alcohol notes reminiscent of rum. Great mouthfeel. Finishes dry. Dont expect any hops in this one. At most, the dryness in the aftertaste may contain some mild hop bitterness.  Overall, a very good easy drinking beer even at 8%.

10099,1180,Shovelbum,3.02,"Poured with a 1cm head into a snifter. Head retention was minimal with little to no lace. The body of the beer was red-orange hued.  Smelled of grapes, rum and alcohol with sweet malty undertones.  The taste of this monster fights between grapes/raisins, malt and just straight boozethe hops werent even in contention. This is pushing the boundaries of the classification that it has been thrown into. But then again pushing boundaries off-center is what Calagione and the other folks at Dogfish Head do best--- although to varying results as evidenced by this particular offering.  The carbonation was light and the body was medium.  This is unlike any Belgian-style ale Ive encountered. I am generally a huge fan of Dogfish Heads work, but I must admit that after my first one of these little babies I had to question my perception of this brewery. After familiarizing myself with the raison of this beer I came to appreciate it a bit more. I think the key to enjoying it is drinking it on its own terms. Its not Belgian. It is strong. It is definitely drinkable--- still, I wont be purchasing another six pack in the near future.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Belgian Dark Strong Ale,83

Malts and a dominating kick of raisins with a touch of alcohol round out the mix.  M - Keeps it light on the mouth with ample carbonation, very pleasing.  D - Not exactly my favorite style, but I sure liked it.

10099,1180,beefytee,4.24,"Poured from bottle into a Potrsmouth Brewery snifter. dark dark amber, beautiful looking beer, a puffy head that receded to reveal little to no lacing.  The first smell was of triamenic which I have to say, made me a little bit nervous. I let it breathe while I ate dinner, I didn't think it would blend well with Subway's Chicken Parm sub.  The first sip was wonderful. Not too much in the hops depertment, but just enough to JUST underbalance the beautiful sweetness of this beer. Any more and this sweetness may have been masked.  The aroma is nice, about what I would expect. The taste is really great. Sweet, reminded of belgium with this one. The alcohol is definitely warming and the finsh is great...like an overcooked, but not burned cookie. A bit of a medicine in the aftertaste, all characteristics I enjoy very much. The rasins are there, but they don't beat you over the head with them.  Great body, soft and almost pillowy in my mouth, the carbonation could not be better, light and tight, it pricks the tongue and soft palatte.  Drinkability? One is very drinkable, maybe two, but at 8% and being that it is, by comparison very sweet, 3 may be pushing it.  5 minutes later, a pleasant bitter feeling (not really aftertaste) still haunts the mouth. Great beer, looking forward to the Raison D'Extra",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Belgian Dark Strong Ale,83
10099,1180,EStreet20,3.29,"12 ounce brown glass bottle. Poured into one of my new DFH Oversized wine glasses.  A - A nice dark brown color, definitely looked like mahogonay as the bottle stated. However there was little if any head. I thinkI may have given it a bad pour though.  S - An interesting smell. Hints of grape, almost like a wine but with not as much sourne.ss to the nose. An intriguing aroma to say the least.   T - Odd taste. Has a lot of bubblegum flavor in there with some fruity kick. Quite a bit of alcohol kick as well. A seemingly unbalanced taste. It's not bad, but nothing to rave about.  M - I would definitely like some more carbonation. A small saving grace is the alcohol warming on the toungue which I always like, still a little too flat for my tastes.  D - It does go down smooth, however it is an 8% beer so watch out. I think a little more carbonation, plus a better balance of flavors would make it more drinlable.  Notes: Can't say I'm too crazy about this one. SO far I've tried the 90 min IPA from DFH and loved it and also enjoyed the 60 min. This one just doesn't stack up in my opinion, however there are definitely worse six packs I could have in my fridge and I won't complain about drinking the others, just a little disappointing.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Belgian Dark Strong Ale,83

Also picking up some cinnamon and cloves too.  Mouthfeel: Medium bodied and leaves a warming, lingering finish.  Drinkability: One to savor. I could probably do more than one but I won't.

Very creamy with warm alcohol tinges in the back. Sweet overpowers the other flavors, but the alcohol is present, just barely.

10099,1180,BuckeyeNation,3.46,"Burnished orange-bronze with a beautiful roseate blush. The pale caramel cap is remarkably tight-bubbled and soft with a blemish-free surface. I didn't see even a hint of deflation for the first several minutes. Unfortunately, it looks like the glass will be left untouched by lace.  Even with my nose in close proximity to the liquid, I'm having difficulty appreciating much. Vague impressions of dark malt, brown sugar and caramel are about it. The beer needs to seriously up the ante on the palate.  The flavor is as bold as the nose is shy. Raison D'Etre doesn't strike me as a BSDA; more like an old ale or even an English barleywine. There's a considerable amount of malt onboard. The flavor profile is made up of caramel-toffee, light molasses, cherries and raisins macerated in dark rum and, unfortunately, unmasked alcohol.  This bottle is at least one year old (bottled in October), but it could be as many as two years old. One would think that over that much time, the alcohol would have been tamed to some extent. It's still a little too raw for my tastes. There's also a metallic character that appears on the finish.  Warming and further inebriation don't bring anything new or interesting to the table. The flavor is still unintegrated, although not totally without merit. The mouthfeel is a bright spot. It's solidly medium and is as smooth as the day is long.  As noted on the label: I can taste the sweetness of the Belgian beet sugar, I can taste the green raisins (they taste like dark raisins to me) and I can taste the 'sense of purpose'. Dogfish Head does not lack vision or audacity, but they too often fail in the execution.  That's too harsh an assessment. Raison D'Etre isn't a failure by any means, but it doesn't hold together well enough to be anything more than a decent, quasi-drinkable curiosity.

10099,1180,cooncat,4.09,"After experiencing Dogfish Head's great IPAs, I decided to try one of their other styles. While this is listed as a Belgian Strong Ale, I found that it seemed closer to a barley wine. My review will explain why.  My sample was room temperature when poured into one of my 20 oz. clear glasses. What little head developed during the pour quickly disappeared .. completely; no lace at all. There was no carbonation that I could detect. Color was a burnt umber, very dark; almost opaque.  Additional info: I tried a 2nd bottle, at room temperature, and with a vigorous pour was able to raise about a half inch head. This quickly dissipated ... in less than 30 seconds, I would say. Taste was identical to the first sample, and I'm still left with the impression of a mild ""barley wine"".  The aroma is BIG, with the high alcohol eskers hitting your nose, along with a wine-like sweetness.  Taste is very much like a barley wine, such as Old Horizontal or Old Crustacean. In the beginning, the taste is somewhat malty, with a hint of raisins and sweetness accompanying the warming alcohol. The end finishes a bit dry, but not overpoweringly so. I was expecting some spicy notes, but didn't find any in my sample. However, I was not disappointed at this.  A big beer like this needs to be sipped and enjoyed slowly.

I've kind of taken my time getting around to it, but it was worth the self-imposed wait. This beer is GOOD. It's unusual combination of flavors make it a complex and difficult beer to pin down. I gleefully wrestled with it, though, and lived to tell the tale.  Raison D'etre poured with a minimal head atop a deep red body. Very nice looking despite the lack of foam. The nose was sweet and fresh, like opening a dewy bag of grapes in the grocery store.  The taste was incredibly hard to define. It was sweet and fruity, and different characters came through at different points during the course of the mug. It reminded me most of grapes or figs, with a rich malt backbone to keep things in perspective. It definitely wasn't dry or tart in any way. I got hints of other flavors as well, molasses maybe, a little bit of dark olives. Never a hint of the 8% ABV, though.  Good mouthfeel, very nice carbonation level. Excellent drinkability. I could have gone for another of these right away, despite the fact that it was essentially a very rich and sweet beer. I'd recommend this one to anyone looking for something a little bit offbeat and adventerous. Would make a great dessert beer, especially if paired with fruits or light cheeses. Good job.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Belgian Dark Strong Ale,83
10099,1180,tgbljb,3.9,"poured a deep reddish color with only sparse head. Smell was extremely enjoyable with a mixture of dark fruits (plums, raisins) and loads of malt.

10099,1180,packetknife,3.65,"Pours a brown-red with solid crimson/blood highlights in decent light. Dense thin head, light-brown, laced well. Smelled like an old yellow raisen and vodka 'home remedy' my granny used to make. The taste is a bit unusual to me, good but weird. I get twinges of pomegranite and cherry, a lot of sharp sweetness that instantly dissapears into a better balance. It's an odd beer and I'm rating it higher than I usually would but after an odd week it seemed fitting. Very drinkable for the ABV.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Belgian Dark Strong Ale,83
10099,1180,wedge,3.98,"Pours a deep mahogany red with violet hues - a small head forms initially but vanishes quickly into a light lacing - light carbonation. Smells distinctly of toasted malts and faint dark fruits w/ a spicy hint of alcohol. The taste is very nice - malty with fruit undertones. Goes down with a lightly fruity/sweet sting and is followed by a sugary sweet (but not too sweet) aftertaste. There is not a hint of the 8% ABV in the taste - easy to drink and has more of a carbonated mouthfeel than appears.  I really enjoy this ale, but for such a complex brew I'd need to move on to something else after a couple. Still, very interesting and enjoyable - I will be getting this again.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Belgian Dark Strong Ale,83
10099,1180,tastybeer,4.2,"Mmmm. This beer goes amazingly well with red grapes, which doesn't suprise. Probably would be equally good with black and green grapes. Its looks good, deep bown with redish and even faint purple tones. Off white head is not very big nor long lasting, but the lacing is nice. The beer smells similar to its taste. Chocolatey malts, with sweet wine/grape scents and tastes. The smell and taste are both pretty complex; I like them a lot. Mouthfeel is smooth. I was real suprised to find this had 8% abv. The awesome combo of deep chocolatey malts and grape fruitiness covers the alcohol great. I think the carbonation is just right, but for a split second when you sip it seems stong, then smooths out fast with flavors. The beer is very tasty, and real drinkable in that way, but after a few I think I'd like to switch it up.  This one's real complexly flavorful in a quality Belgian way. I'll be getting more.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Belgian Dark Strong Ale,83
10099,1180,ommegangpbr,3.72,"The 2000 edition, 12 ounce bottle into a Chimay goblet. A pretty looking beer, but not too noteworthy for the style. It's a mahogany color with a slightly offwhite head; not much head or lacing to speak of. Smells... sharp; an odor that reminds me of perfume. There are fermented fruit odors to be found that might remind some people of garbage but for the most part I like it. I taste all kinds of raisins in this. I haven't had green raisins in a long time (which the bottle says this is brewed with) but I certainly taste golden and dark raisins. This is not as deep or complex as others I've had of the style but the straightforwardness has an appeal. The mouthfeel is a bit sticky sweet that lingers for a little longer than I'd like. The carbonation is appealing and there is a tang that I like. Overall I like this brew and would say it's worth a try to those that like sweeter tasting brews. The 8% alcohol is absolutely deceptive in this.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Belgian Dark Strong Ale,83

Kind of sweet, kind of raisony. The mouthfeel is medium thin. Overall, this beer isn't bad, but it isn't good either. I wasn't on BA when I took notes on this beer, so I assumed the style was a fruit beer. I was suprised and disappointed when I found it to be a Belgain Strong Dark Ale. For it is a bad interpretation of that style, IMO. It's not flavorful enough, and the aroma is too faint.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Belgian Dark Strong Ale,83
10099,1180,scooter231,4.11,"Pours a lovely amber color with a slight amount of head. Smells sweet- reminds me a lot of how Hennepin tastes with some rasisins thrown in, oddly enough. Champagney.  Taste seems more subtle to me than the smell, but it's quite nice. Lots of raisins, and other sweet flavors. Other dark, juicy fruits. Cherry, plum, figs and beets as well. Alcohol hits you at the beginning of the sip and then quickly smooths out so it's not very abrasive. Kind of reminds me of chocolate covered raisins. Hints of caramel and cofee way in the back. Lots of dark flavors coming together in really nice harmony- and I'm not even a dark fruit fan.  Mouthfeel is slick. Flows right down the throat. I think this is pretty drinkable considering the alcohol content, and the sweetness. Now, I don't think it's THAT sweet, but a lot of others do. I could see myself not realizing just how much of it I'm imbibing. I really like this. Thanks dogish, for making something that doesn't taste like overwhelming alcohol to me. Now, I TRULY respect you.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Belgian Dark Strong Ale,83
10099,1180,GnomeKing,2.7,"I love Dogfish Head Brewery for the quality of its beers and for its daring and creativity. It is probably my favorite brewery. Whether you're brewing beer, playing music, or writing stories, when you take changes and do things differently, you will sometimes produce a bad result. This is what happened to Dogfish Head with Raison D'etre. The tastes are oddly cobbled together--raisins and hops and who knows what else, mingling awkwardly like incompatible members of a reality show. For all the oddness of the beer, it's actually bland in many ways, particularly during the first few sips. The more I drank, the more the odd and unpleasant tart and sweet fruit tastes came forward. I would have preferred the relative blandness of the first few sips.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Belgian Dark Strong Ale,83
10099,1180,Gavage,3.29,"Poured a dark copper color with a surface foam for a head. No lacing develops. The aroma is of strong malt and alcohol. The flavor is dominated by the thick malt tones, as some prunes, green grapes, light bitterness, alcohol, and faint caramel tones round it out.  Medium-heavy in bidy. Mouthfeel was smooth and mildly syrupy at the start and finish. The aftertaste was long lasting on the malt. Drinkability is only average for this brew.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Belgian Dark Strong Ale,83
10099,1180,andjusticeforale,3.6,"The owner of my usual package store let me know about this beer a few months ago, but I was too busy buying Belgian's to notice this one. He described it as a big dark Raisin flavored beer. He wasn't that far off.  Let me first say that I do like big trappist style quadrupel and strong dark ales so I once I tasted this I knew what to expect. I bought a six of this stuff for $6.99 which really wasn't too expensive at all( I once bought a 4-pack of Dogfish Aprihop for $8.99)  It poured into a ballon type glass without much of a head. The clor was blueish black with tight carbonation. The smell was sweet grape and Belgian sugars. I was impressed with the nose and the begininning of this beer and I thought to myself- they must use Belgian malts here, to get this smell. This was 8.00 abv, and to their credit- you could taste no alcohol, except perhaps a warming finish. The mouthfeel was good, at least as good as Unibroue's ""Trois Pistoles"" In fact, it is very similar to this beer.  Here's the rub, for me anyway, there was a way too strong Raisin aftertaste. It left a cloying, unpleasant type film on the palate, almost like a bad shiraz. I also like to swirl the glass and savor each sip, that wasn't the thing here either. This is a disappointment but then I thought, Dogfish must be going for this. If this is the case, and you love the raisin taste of shiraz,(try ""Jake's Fault Shiraz"" out of California) you will love this and think it is the best beer ever. For me, It started great but finished with the aftertaste.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Belgian Dark Strong Ale,83
10099,1180,quasimoto,2.73,"I can say right now this beer would go great with a steak. It's strong on the palette and definitley needs something with bold flavor to counter-act it. It pour a dark reddish brown with no head but high carbination. Almost like pepsi. There is absolutely no head, just alittle foam. The aromas of a red bourdeaux come to mind. It also reminescent of a saison. there are some spices in there that I can't pick out. I read about this beer, and brew my own; so I boiled raisins one time and know exactly what they taste and smell like. I can definitely taste them in here. The mouthfeel is definitely one that I can't say I enjoy too much. Its too sharp on the palette, and not easy to take. This is definitely out of the box thinking for brewing. Sam is definitely creative. But for myself I think this might be an aquired taste. This was also sitting on the back of a warm shelf for a while in the store. It was dust covered and bent up.

I am actually glad that there is little head on this beer as it allows you to really get a good taste and feel for it's thick smooth consistancy.

Appearance: Deep amber with hints of purple and brown  Smell: Fruit, mainly grape, and some malt  Taste: Like no other beer I have had. Deep fruitieness with sweet malt. You get a strong alcohol tast on the front of your tonge. Slight bitterness, but very little hop flavor. Clean finish. Very little head that does not stick around.  Mouthfeel: Clean with some abrasiveness from the alcohol.  Drinkablity: Not as easy as I would have liked. This is an aggressive beer that is challenging to most pallets.

An extremely complex and fruitful beer. Pours with a medium to high viscocity. Brown with some burgundy and purple violet tones. Tan / burgundy head falls to a trace, laces well, nice oily cling to the glass. Smells of cocoa, deep dark friuts, all hidden behind a malt base. Lightly hopped and tart. Tastes fruity sweet with pruned, dates, raisons, figs. All the goodness that you'd like from these fruits with only a mild tartness. A red wine-like muskiness in the body. Silky smooth rich body that nicely fades into the finish. Very consistant flow down the throat. Mild cherries show up in the finish. Mildly drying and mildly sweet. Dangerously easy to drink.

There is very little head....but the little there is clings to edges of the glass. White/tannish in color.  Smell....Ahhh..the aroma of this is rich, fruity and sugary, but not overdone. Smells incredible. You can tell this was made with raisens as well as others fruits and sugars.  Taste...in one word this is delicious. Sweet and fruity, but not overly so in my mind. The sweetness of the fruit dominates any malty or hoppy flavors here. The alcohol here is very evident, but it does not detract from the flavor. If you regularly drink strongish craft beer, it will come across as a tasty beer. If you don't like to taste any alcohol, this may turn you off.  Mouthfeel...rich, the alcohol gives it a spicy feel to it. Goes down slick...like slippery goodness.  Drinkability....I could definitely drink a few of these. The flavors are assertive, but in a nice way. Not overly sweet. Every sip seems like a bite from the fruit of the beer gods...delicious. I will have a night of drinking just this.  On a side note...before this tasting I had this with a plate of 4 cheese tortellini and 5 cheese sauce. I recommend trying this beer with some nice italian food.

Where is the 8% abv? The folks at Dogfish Head are masters at hiding the alcohol in their high octane beers. Wait, there it is, a subtle burn on the swallow followed by a nice warming feeling going down the chest & into the stomach. Again, very well hidden, almost TOO well hidden.

I didn't pick up much in the way of malts or hops in the nose.  Tasting: This beer had more fruit flavor than it did malt sweetness or hop bitterness. It tasted like apple juice infused with grape and raisins. It had a little bit of the texture of a Belgian Strong Dark Ale on the back of the tongue, but it wasn't impressive. The alcohol content snuck up on me a bit too. The higher than average alcohol content makes this a less drinkable beer.  Overall, I would say that I recommend it, with reservations.

Regardless this one was difficult to drink very fast, certainly a sipper, a pint was FAR more than enough. Lots of layers going on here, but honestly there was more going on here than I was interested in delving into. So I'd say this one is reaching toward the overdone end of the spectrum.

The taste is much the same - The belgian beet sugars make it sticky-sweet, with raisins, dark fruit and hops ... but an acidic alcohol that pervades the ale and becomes worse as it warms ruins the whole deal. This ale gives me heartburn. The mouthfeel is gooey and somewhat flat, again with an acidic alcohol kick that is unpleasant. Because of that, the this ale is very hard to drink.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Belgian Dark Strong Ale,83

Poured a clear mahogany with a half inch light tan head even after a vigorous pour that quickly disipated and left little lacing. There's not much to the smell. The taste was peanut buttery, raisin, and had a burnt/smokey mesquite-like but bittery finish.  It's drinkable and different but not something I'd go out of my way to find or pay too much for.

Plentiful 1/4 inch cream of fungal foam that stayed, and stuck, throughout the pour. Light claret hue with some haze, though it could possibly be due to the temperature the pour was served at; fair amount of action. Candy cane crank of sweet ice on nose, with some fruit funk as well, uh, maybe raisin. Alcohol pummeling on mouth; jam of raspberry and a crunch of light willow ghosts.

Nose isn't as assertive as I would've liked but oh well, what's there is pleasant. Taste is suprisingly yeasty but with a strong maltiness and a nice fruity middle. Alcohol presence is notable. Not terrible on it's own but I can pick up much more interesting Belgian darks for about the same price. Interesting but won't be revisiting again after I finish my six pack.

Taste is very sweet and raisiny with other fruit flavors shining through as well. The flavor didn't really do it for me, I felt it was just this side of cloying, and it needed a spicy kick to balance it out that, for me, never arrived. Moreover, I felt the alcohol was way too pervasive in the flavor. It almost reminded me of sweetened raisins if they'd been soaked in vodka. It's an interesting beer, but not one that I have any desire to try again soon.

As others have mentioned, however, it's too sweet. Maybe with a little less sugar this could be an outstanding beer. Mouthfeel ok... pretty creamy actually. 8% ABV as well as the sweetness hurts this one on drinkability. Like I said, I'm still not sure what exactly to think of this beer.

Pours a tawny red with relatively no head, but clings like a mofo. The lacing ultimately reminds me of the way wine laces down a glass, smooth and viscous. It even smells much like a red wine.  Even still, it tastes like a wine, most likely due to the use of raisins. I'm beginning to think this ale is having an identity crisis. Alas, there are some very sweet caramel flavors along with plum, cherry and a hint of alcohol. The finish is dry and pleasant, with a hint of peppery spice. That, in turn, reminds me of drinking Shiraz/Syrah. The flavor is rather good but the experience is altogether a bit confusing.

Some malt. Some dark fruits (Like maybe raisins? Duh.) and some anise.  As for the taste... it was... OK. The anise was very strong, but the beer was really sweet.

Violently poured, it comes with maybe a double fingernail thick that quickly disipates to nothing. Not a very good appearance. Smells of brown sugar, wine, alcohol, caramel and butterscotch. Not too bad, but a bit off with the sugar. Taste is too sweet. It's like red wine. Actually, it reminded me of Jewish wine. Very, very sweet. Raisins, sugar, malt, caramel, sugar and raisins.

Aroma: Rich malt extract and a hit of alcohol: a relatively simple smell in my book, but an enjoyable one. Appearance: Deep clear amber with a strong carbonation feed picking up small dark particles in the beer. Looks like it is churning! Nice half finger creamy light tan head which is moving like a roiling pot. This beer looks alive! Left thick coats of lace and as the lace dried, tide marks. Flavor: The green raisins come through the roasted caramel malt after a bit. This is rich. Alcohol is well hidden. Definite Belgian overtones, the purple grape/wine note of a dubbel or quad is present, but nicely fitting the Belgian dark category. Very rich and sweet malt, but doesnt go too far, a beer has to know its limitations. Mouthfeel: Medium heavy body that coats with a sugary persistent intensity. A bit fizzy but creamy, an odd combination Overall Impression: This is a dangerous being; like most things with a true sense of purpose. Subtle but driven, creamy yet strong. Too drinkable, the flavor is heavy but not intense so I could probably do a few more, but the alcohol is about to put me on the floor.

The malts were there, but as a minor player in the nose. Wasn't outstanding.  The taste was lightly bitter, and medium malt body, but there was a little funkiness caused by the raisins. This odd taste lasted into the aftertaste. Not totally pleasant. Better than macros, but not great in terms of a craft brew.

Reading the label, I expected a big nose on this one. Slightly malty smell, with a tiny hint of alcohol. What will this one taste like?  Taste - Awesome. Malty sweetness hits the tongue and is followed by alcoholic warmth on the aftertaste. I also detect what seems to be a raisin flavor (the label says the beer is made with green raisins). The flavors of this beer linger for a long time. As the beer warms up a little, the beer presents itself better and the flavors intensify.  Mouthfeel - Hearty. The mouthfeel is accentuated by the alcoholic strength of this beer. Seems to be appropriate for the style.  Drinkability - ""Alcohol"" keeps coming to mind. Decent drinkability, but more alcohol taste than I prefer. Maybe a good beer for sipping in front of the fire on a cold night. All philosopher kings rejoice!  Comments - Raison d'être (noun): reason or justification for existence. I don't know if I would go that far, but I give a tip of my hat to Dogfish Head for this creative beer.

Mouthfeel is fuzzy and warm --very nice. Drinkability is about average. One or two of these is enough. I think it might be more drinkable on a real cold day.

I don't recognize the flavor as familiar. It is not very strong and as such not very offensive. A tiny coffelike flavor, a hint of what must be the raisins, and some malt flavours. Not very dry or very sweet.  m - pretty thick and lingers in your mouth. The aftertaste is better than the main taste, but still not outstanding. Certainly the most redeeming attribute of this beer.  d - It's not offensive and quite strong so I would consider it reasonably drinkable. I don't want another, but not because it's bad, but because there are better thigns to drink.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Belgian Dark Strong Ale,83

Beautiful mahagony dark with mocha colored head, much cream that dissipates into lace. Masterfully done, like Ommegang with extra angles. Better than an average Belgian.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Belgian Dark Strong Ale,83
10099,1180,crookedhalo,3.52,"Packaged 8/2004. Pours a orangy chestnut color with a short-lived light beige head. Bready, biscuity and malty; vinously wine-like nose. A fair bit of yeastiness in the aroma, too. Rather sweet right of the bat, then mild fruitiness kicks in and the finish is light, hoppy and estery. Pretty interesting and unique. You can tell this beer is 8%, there's a slovent-like burn to it. Not too bad, but it is noticable. Worth a try.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Belgian Dark Strong Ale,83
10099,1180,dauss,3.82,"The label is copyrighted 1999, with the 7 etched off. So I don't know how old this beer is. Pours a very hazy dark amber copper. Small head fades quickly into a lace on the edge of the glass. Nose is very malty, the darker ones because I'm picking up a hint of coffee. Dark fruits and the alcohol is quite noticable. First sip, light-moderate carbonation. Wow this beer is interesting. Very malty, pretty strong sweetness. It is also hopped just right. Light bitterness is present in the entire sip. Finishes dry and lightly bitter, and you can definitely feel the alcohol evaporate off the inside of your mouth when you exhale. It definitely warms me up. Great for a desert beer, but I don't think it classifies as a Belgian ale.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Belgian Dark Strong Ale,83
10099,1180,BrewMaster,4.12,"Poured from a 12 oz bottle into a Leffe goblet. The color is a rich red to orange and is a bit cloudy. The aroma is of yeast and spicy malts. I smell a good scent of cinnamon in it.  The beer opens with a poignant hops grassiness and a sharp alcohol flavor. it then tails off without much fanfare on the taste buds. It ends with a weaker malt flavor than the aroma suggests. The alcohol/hops combination gives it the sensation of being spicy, which is nice. But it does lack a bit in the flavor department.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Belgian Dark Strong Ale,83
10099,1180,SeanChouffe,3.86,"Sampled this beer at the GABF on 10/2/04, but this review is from the bottle on 10/3/04. A transparent ruby/mahogany color with plenty of fine co2 and a full light yellow head that reduces to decent layer. Lacing is sticky. Smells earthy and malty with some fruity esters, light hops and a tannic background. Flavor is of dark fruits, malt, caramel; kind of like a double bock. Palate is full bodied and syrupy with some creaminess, an effervescent middle and a metallic finish. IMHO: Better on tap. Not as well balanced as I had expected.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Belgian Dark Strong Ale,83
10099,1180,santoslhalper,3.73,"Pours a nice chocolate brown with an impressive head. Head's gone quick with no lacing though. Smells of sweet malts, chocolate, raisens (obviously), and a hint of alcohol. Now this is an interesting tasting beer. Had to take a few more sips to figure out what I'm tasting. First the obvious - prunes, raisens and dates, OH MY! Under that, lots of alcohol with little to no carbonation. Hops are not used to the best of their ability. Nice malt flavor on the finish, but a bit too dry. Not enough carbonation in the mouth for me. And, alas, not an incredibly quaffable beer. All in all I'd say a bit too complex without having any focus. Tastes all over the place. Still a very nice brew indeed, but overrated.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Belgian Dark Strong Ale,83
10099,1180,oxmasterscream,3.56,"Pours a clear reddish amber color (DFH calls it magogany but it's a tad light in color for that), head fell to a ring quickly. Aroma is fruity and lightly spiced - apples, pears, grassy (?)... not sure... very hard to call. Taste is the same... crisp, fruity (green apples) and really tart, finishes dry. This is really hard to describe. Mouthfeel is medium bodied, with solid carbonation. Drinkability... I'm just not sure. It's definitely an interesting brew but I would probably not have it again.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Belgian Dark Strong Ale,83
10099,1180,PorterLambic,4.47,"Pours a slightly opaque orange-copper color with a 1 1/2"", tight, cream colored head that drops slowly & evenly to a thick film and leaves good lacing.. Smell is malty, fruity (orange & raisin) & spice. A wonderful pleasure for the nose. Taste is malty, fruity (apple/orange/raisin), hops (light & late), very complex, an extremely tasty brew. Mouthfeel is very smooth, full bodied, warms the throat nicely without any harshness from the alcohol. Drinkability is nearly as high as it can get. Often a beer with this much alcohol can be hard to drink more than one of, but this libation does not suffer that problem. I recommend this beer without any reservations.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Belgian Dark Strong Ale,83

Smell is of sweet, flowery esters, rum, overripe plums, and raisins. Some malt is apparent, but not emphasized. Taste is more of the same, with a bit more malt coming through now. The beer appears harsh and sharp yet soft and cunning. I'm confused, but intrigued. I will try this again.

10099,1180,kindestcut,3.18,"The Raison D'etre poured a deep, dark amber...brown with a red tint as the light hit my glass. For a Belgian-style ale, the head was disappointing.  The aroma was not strong. The alcohol was quite evident as was a fruity combination of raisins, plums mixed with a hint of caramel. Otherwise, I'd say this beer doesn't have a verydistinct aroma.  The taste is even more confusing. There doesn't seem to be an obvious balance of flavors. I detect all of the flavors from my sniff but nothing is really in the foreground...except the alcohol. I can taste all 8% of this beer. Most of the better Belgian-styles I've had don't flaunt their high alcohol but I guess sometimes you have to go with your strength. I just wish the strength of this beer was its flavor.  Translated literally (at least one translation), Raison D'etre means ""reason for being."" As a phrase, it is used to represent a guiding principle or philosophy. I only wish the beer was as deep as the name.  In the end, this is yet another beer I wanted to like far more than I did.

10099,1180,twelvsies,3.76,"Having only tried one Dogfish Head brew before this one I was anxiously anticipating trying this one. A medium dark amber color, but almost totally transparent. Not much of a head to speak of on this one at all. The smell on this one is very subtle. I almost can't smell a thing, but with a deep whiff I can pick up on a Belgiany maltiness. Smells sweet and nutty. Tastes better than any other American ""Belgian Beer"" I've had. Sweet, but not too sweet. Fruity characters in there somewhere. Very thick mouthfeel, clings to the tongue. Smooooth. Drinkability... well, I say this in just about every review, but; I could drink this all night. Hmmm. Maybe I just like beer too much. Is that possible? Anyway, a very tasty brew. Go out and get yours.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Belgian Dark Strong Ale,83

Tried this on a whim... made with raisins and beet sugars, I was hoping for an interesting experiment, but ended up finding one of my favorite recent discoveries, and the best so far by the amazing brewers at Dogfish Head.  The color alone is an experience. I would paint my apartment with that rich, warm, brown-red color. And the taste compares to some of my favorite true Belgians (certainly a worthy American tribute to the masters), with just a little something extra and different... must be coming from those raisins.  I'd recommend seeking this out on tap... after trying both bottle and tap, there's something in the taste missing from the bottle.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Belgian Dark Strong Ale,83
10099,1180,hobbes2112,3.75,"12oz bottle.  Pours dark amber with medium offwhite head. The retention is very short and the lace is minimal. Smell is sweet raisin and malt both with an earthy tinge. Taste is very similar to the smell, sweet raisin, malt, belgian (beet?) sugar, and alcohol. I am actually reminded a lot of Vinho Verde wine (Portugese white made from under-ripe grapes)  At first when the beer is still with head, the flavors are really vibrant and layered but as the carbonation goes away so does some of the complexity.  This beer is good, but it is a little too sweet to have more than one at a time.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Belgian Dark Strong Ale,83
10099,1180,mudhoney,4.13,OK. Let me start by saying that I was a bit put off by the use of green raisins in this beer as well of the fact I am not big Belgian strong ale person. This beer was very much a suprise. Pouring a brilliant beet red color with little foam to speak of it almost looks like a wine. The aromas are malty and fruity. The flavor again a bit like sherry with hints of fig like grandmas fruitcake around christmas time. The finish was sweet and lingering with a date aftertaste. This beer would be an excellent choice for a dessert beer or a light after dinner beer.,Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Belgian Dark Strong Ale,83

It has a malty and sweet smell. Some hint of alcohol in the smell aswell. The taste is malty and sweet from the sugar and some hints of raisins. The mothfeel is smooth and warming.

10099,1180,kegerator,4.18,"Very nice offering. Poured a deep brown with a nice 1 inch head that left very nice lacing. Smell was as the name suggests, malty, raisin and a hint of spice. The taste was spice up front with a nice raisin quality. The spice was more of a sweet spiciness rather then the dried fruit quality. Very nice Mouthfeel was medium to medium full. It was a bit thin for a big belgian style but very enjoyable",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Belgian Dark Strong Ale,83
10099,1180,kmpitz2,3.95,"The beer pours a golden amber color with 3 fingers of head that drops to about a finger with little to no lace. Not as dark as I would like or expect. The nose is mostly sweet malt with raisin. Not quite as strong an aroma as I would like. The taste is a little flat for a belgian strong dark. Its lacking some of the heavier fig characters I associate with the style. The mouthfeel is also a little on the weak side for me. It is thick, but not quite thick enough for me. As far as drinkability, this one goes down easy, but too easy in my opinion for the style. It should be a more sipping beer than a drinking beer, so it loses a bit there. Overall, it's not bad, but nothing to sing about.  Edit: Trying it again. The beer is a lot better than I gave it credit for earlier. The nose and flavor are very nice.

The smell improved as it warmed, with a definte malt and hop presence....hops had grassy and fruity notes. Taste was initially sweet and upon first taste, somewhat metallic. The metallic quality ebbed as the brew warmed and I noted what seemed like cherries?....it took on an almost wine like quality and ended with a lightly carbonated finish that was somewhat refreshing. Drinkability for the style is good....fairly smooth, but the warming quality reminds you of the ABV. Mouthfeel is suprisingly smooth and has a dry finish.

10099,1180,RenoZymurgist,3.08,Pours a deep red with a fine white head that takes it's cue to exit soon after being poured. The aroma has a hint of sweet malt and a fruitiness that is either contributed by esters or from the green raisins. The flavor is definetly Belgian as it reminds me of a good tripel yet the color throws me off as i keep tasting for sweet malt and carmel flavors. The carbonation of this ale lends more credibility to the Belgian qualities as it just has that Belgian feel that is hard to describe unless you have tasted hundreds of Belgian beers and talked about many of them. Flavor has a slight carbonic bite followed with sweet malt and with a clean finish but with a lingering flavor of malt. I can't taste the green raisins but i do think that the beet sugar gave it that belgian candy sugar quality. I love the innovation that DFH brings to the craft brew scene and i hope to try more of thier strange and interesting beers.,Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Belgian Dark Strong Ale,83
10099,1180,assurbanipaul,3.79,"Pours a clear dark amber with a thin off-white head. Nose is fruity and pungent, strange sour musty aromas mixed with the usual malts and hops. No lacing but thick enough to coat the sides.  Taste is like a strong, strong red ale. Caramel malt character dominates but is rounded out with some sweet non-citrus fruity elements like raisins, grapes or figs. Traces of tea, light tobacco or even whiskey-soaked wood, although it doesn't taste of whiskey. In fact, there's not a trace of alcohol in the taste at all.  Medium mouthfeel, smooth and oily with little carbonation. Finishes clean with no unpleasant aftertaste. My palate doesn't quite know what to do with this but it isn't bad. Unsure of how it matches up with the style but impresses me as sort of a hybrid lambic, sitting halfway between a gueuze and a Corsendonk. I would be real curious to see how this ages.

The finish was a lingering grape and hop flavor followed by alcohol warmth.  All and all a very drinkable beer but I don't think it would go good with food. Still a great beer to sit with friends.,Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Belgian Dark Strong Ale,83
10099,1180,filabrazilia,3.83,Pours a semi-clear orange amber with a small white head. Good lace drapes the glass.  A sweet malt aroma mixes with a faint fruity nose.  The malt is the dominant flavor in the taste but it's balanced by a grapelike presence. They are both balanced by a touch of alcohol.

10099,1180,NEhophead,3.53,"""Brewed with (among other things)...a sense of purpose""  Very carbonated, off white head that takes a minute or two to settle. Deep reddish/orange color that is a touch cloudy. Nice thin, intricate lacing.  Sweet, tart nose. Bouquets of raisins, dates, and possibly oranges. An overall sweet and sour smell.  A mouth puckering tartness that overides the beer's natural flavors. The peach, sweet raisin, and orange/citric flavors are there but not nearly as overwhelming as the ale's sourness. It's like drinking one of those sour Air Head candies.  Just an unbalanced ale. Too tart for the style: it just doesn't fit for a strong belgian dark in my opinion. The 8%abv is very well hidden and very well balanced with the flavor.  Easy to consume from a high abv standpoint, but the unbalanced sourness numbs the palate. More than one of these a night could lead to one of those annoying headaches the next morning due to the beer's sweetness.  All in all, not a bad beer, but just very unfitting of the style. Again you have to give the brewers at Dogfish Head credit for throwing out tradition and creating a unique concoction in its own right.

There was a minimal head, rather an off-white lacing around the edges of the snifter.  I tasted a very sweet and malty character initially with hints of plum & an alcohol presence in the finish. I also noticed an oaky, wine-dryness at points of the finish, almost like a Chardonnay.  Make no mistake about it, this is a strong beer (8.0% ABV).

The head that was produced was an off white/creamy tan color. Its consistency was fairly creamy and fluffy but was not long lasting as it fell to a ring on the edges and no center. The lace was there at times, creamy in texture and in sheets, but not lasting. The aromas were sweet, rich and deep to the back of the nose, tones of dark fruits, plums, raisons, sweet dark malts, a light spice tone, and intermixing throughout were alcohol esters and fruit soaked in alcohol notes. The flavors were a little more complex then the aromas, it was sweet and rich. I tasted in the first sip, hops (floral and spice) and dried leafs, then some dark fruits and malts. After the first sip passed, the other tastes that became noticeable along with the aforementioned were more dark malts, fruits (plums, raisons, maybe a hint of dark cherry?), some alcohol soaked fruits but subtly mixed in with the other fruits, an earthy tone throughout and finished with a hop and a bready yeast note. Also noted was that as it warmed the alcohol became more prominent near the finish. It left an aftertaste of dark malt, slight alcohol and the earth tones. The body was on the full side. The words of creamy, full and rich come to mind when drinking this beer. Side: This was bought as a case a few months ago, and the flavors were richer and more pronounced through the first bottle drank, as it aged, it declined slightly in flavors which surprised me considering the style based on which ages well IMO, but still a good drink.

Thin and sticky lacing. The aroma is a complex blend of sweet fruit (raisins), malt, caramel and brown sugar. Medium-bodied and well-nuanced flavors that are alternatingly sweet and tart.

The ABV is high in this beer and you can definitely tell by the high alcohol scents. After you get past all of that though, this is a rather complex beer... There is a certain amount of spiciness and fruit scents as well. The hop content in this beer is low, but still present in the taste. Among the flavors of this complex brew are dried fruit (apricots) grapes, and plums. This is a lot smoother than you would think for such a high gravity brew. Another solid offering from DFH.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Belgian Dark Strong Ale,83
10099,1180,FormatKid,4.32,"I picked up a single of this from Riverside Beverage in Chattanooga. Im a big fan of the brewery so Im looking forward to this one.  It pours out a deep, slightly hazy, mahogany brown. The color is somewhat light but opaque. There is no head or lacing at all to speak of honestly, beyond a little swirl of spittle in the middle of the glass and a thin ring around the edges.  The nose is very big and upfront with brown sugar, brandy-soaked raisons, and over-ripe plum. The brown sugar smell is very deep and rich and binds everything together. The slightest evidence of a musty yeast is detectable here as well. The alcohol smell is there, but seems to meld into that syrupy sweet aroma.  Taste is very astringent at first. This however flattens out into a smooth, sweetness (theres that brown sugar presence again). I honestly believe I can pick up the flavor of the green raisons in the middle. Hops ring about the edges and back of my tongue, and a vinous after taste like grapeskins is left in my mouth along with an ever so slight musty yeast flavor. The alcohol is present in the flavor but not as overpowering as some people seemed to have found it. Mouthfeel is medium and I detect little carbonation to speak of.  Dogfish head defies stylistic conventions again, and in my humble opinion..its a winner! For something that is brewed with Belgian yeasts I look forward to more of that musty characteristic but its forgivable. I definitely look forward to having this beer again.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Belgian Dark Strong Ale,83
10099,1180,BadBadger,4.15,"Yum. This fine beer lacked a head, even though I poured for affect. A nice deep copper coloring. A slightly sweet smell but definitely not in anyway overwhelming. A wonderful taste-somewhat sweet but very pleasant. No hint of alcohol, although it is certainly there. Give it a go.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Belgian Dark Strong Ale,83
10099,1180,AbePhroman,3.82,I do enjoy Dogfish Heads brews and this is no exception. Not much of a head when I poured it. Smelled strong of malts and fruits. An excellent taste. Malty flavors with a hint of wheat maybe? It is very drinkable for an 8%. The alcohol is very subdued.,Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Belgian Dark Strong Ale,83
10099,1180,Bierguy5,3.25,"Pours a pale golden brown liquid with a white thick creamy/foamy head that was white. The head disappeared quickly which was disappointing. Smells spicy to me, like cinnamon? Hard to pick up anything else. Taste begins with a decent malt sweetness, followed by a fruit flavor like banana. There was a slight spicyness to the finish. It was thin, I thought, but it was pretty smooth. This beer seemed to be drinkable, but it just didn't do it for me. Still, good to see beer like this. Nonetheless, I am glad I gave it a try.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Belgian Dark Strong Ale,83
10099,1180,abcsofbeer,3.83,"Dark amber color with very small head after the pour. Head disappears quickly, but leaves a nice lace 3/4 of the way through the glass. Musty, fruity flavor with a nice, but hard to pinpoint aftertaste. Finishes strong with the taste remaining consistent all the way to the bottom. Highly recommend this one.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Belgian Dark Strong Ale,83
10099,1180,BeerAngel,3.8,"Pours a clear medium mahogany with a nice smooth cream-colored head that shrinks to a 1/8"" long lasting layer. From the foamy head billows a musty fruit aroma with faint spicing in the background. The taste is again a musty fruit, more specifically grapes and raison flavors, with a non-stick yeast in the background and has a unique abrupt halt to the richness that just starts to poke through. It comes up a little short in the wave of flavors as the rug is yanked out from underneath your tastebuds. It still has the making of a good beer in this medium bodied offering that finishes slightly sweet.  Notes: Quite drinkable at 8%, but I think it is lacking in the finish department. Perhaps that's what increases the drinkability because the taste ends too soon. This one is hard to explain, but it's an overall decent offering. Cheers!",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Belgian Dark Strong Ale,83
10099,1180,rajendra82,3.42,"When poured into a Pilsner glass, the body was murky reddish brown with almost no head to speak of. The carbonation lasted for all of three seconds and then left the room. Aroma was complex and interesting. There were notes of rum, raisins, licorice, and candied apples on the nose. The taste was similar to the aroma: fruity, peppery, vinous, and dry. The alcohol content is high, but very well hidden. I think they went overboard with the adjuncts and neglected the malt in this beer. The result is a thin, watery, and disappointing mouthfeel. I have had better from Dogfish Head.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Belgian Dark Strong Ale,83
10099,1180,99bottles,3.15,"I've had this before, and I figured why not get one more bottle and give it a review? It's actually not that great, but I'll review it anyway.  Appearance: Pours a reddish-brown body with tons of sediment floating around. Is this an old bottle? Perhaps. Small, thin head due to the super slow pour. I still managed to dump most of the chunks. Poor retention on the lace.  Smell: Hmm. Sugary malts. I can't quite make out the other smell. It's sort of vinous and cherry like, almost like a dopplebock. Now I'm curious.  Taste: Not what I expected. In fact, not much of anything. This beer is seriously bland. There are sweet notes of caramel, raisin (duh) and very small hops at the finish. It's very sugary, like drinking syrup without the consistency.  Mouthfeel: Rather thin given how sweet it is. These go back like nothing, and honestly, there's not a lot there to slow oneself down on. 8% is a mystery and would probably catch up with you.  Drinkability: Easy like pie. But, why bother? I remembered this one being better the first time I had it, but even then, it was nothing to write home about. There are better DFHs out there, and much better Belgian Strong Darks.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Belgian Dark Strong Ale,83
10099,1180,Mitchster,3.65,"Pours to a clear dark-auburn with a slight chill-haze, requiring a very vigorous pour to form a tall light-tan latte-type head with a spongy texture. Retention is very good and lacing is average. Carbonation is mild. Aroma is fruity with dark fruit hints, black cherries, slightly vinous, sticky amber malts. The taste is rather mild...raisins, prunes, dust, brown sugar, caramel, port, peppery alcohol...there are fusels and acetaldehyde here, but my nasal congestion prevents it from being a burden. The solvent alcoholic esters are very prominent, like acetone/nail polish remover, as well and a bit stinging, interfering with the malts, though a bit of husky grain comes in towards the end. Bitterness is minimal, just leaving a hint of menthol/pepper sensation on the tongue about 3 minutes after my last sip.  Is this what candy-corn dipped in nail polish tastes like?  The mouthfeel is really smooth with a mellow finish. Brewed with Belgian sugars, but certainly not Belgian-style.  Despite all it's shortcomings, it's actually easy to drink owing to it's smooth mouthfeel and low carbonation. I can't normally stomach beers with this much fusel/acetone/isopropyl/solvent alcohol, but this doesn't seem to bother me. Again, it's my nasal congenstion, but the warming feeling is nice, and hey, it's opening my sinuses. I know, on any other day, the fusels would take off a point on taste, so I'll do that tonight despite the fact that my stuffy nose doesn't care. One bottle gives me a pleasant buzz on an empty stomach.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Belgian Dark Strong Ale,83
10099,1180,Lupe,4.32,"Hazy mahogany in color with a creamy off-white head that drops quickly to a thin sheet. Little lace is left behind in the glass. Aroma of caramel and fruit and hints of spice. Sweet malt flavor with caramel, light toast, some fruit, Belgian candy sugar. and a hint of chocolate. Hops are present only to balance the malt, and they do a pretty good job. Other then a hint of rum, I did not notice the alcohol at all. Finishes with some dryness, preparing the palate for another sip. Medium to full in body and super smooth. Very tasty and highly drinkable despite the higher alcohol content. Enjoyable.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Belgian Dark Strong Ale,83
10099,1180,Southernbrew,3.38,"Pours a medium-brown, good bubbly head.  Lots of sweetness in the nose, some sweet raisins and a sharp alcohol are noticable.  Medium mouthfeel, mouth coating sweetness. Raisin-like flavors that are sweet and not sour. Alcohol becomes more noticable and reminds me of a bottle of rubbing alcohol but not as strong. Leaves a sweet-alcoholic aftertaste.  More of a novelty than something I'd drink regularly.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Belgian Dark Strong Ale,83

Smell: Very aromatic with notes of spice, plum, toffee, malt, apricot.  Taste: Fruity esters abound, plum-apricot-peach, with a bit of spice, malt and golden raisin. The initial and mid-palate are relatively sweet though the finish is lasting and on the dryer side.  Mouthfeel: Full and Smooth.

I guess before I even start to explain my review, I must say that I reviewed it as a strong belgian dark ale, and this does not have the ideal characteristics of one that I have ever come across. It lacks the initial sweetness that I look for in a good belgian. One thing this beer does have on its side is a complexity of flavors hitting the mouth. From start to finish, you pick up many ""different"" flavors. The finish isn't bad, but not what a good strong belgian normally has. Overall, if this had not been labled a belgian strong dark ale (which happens to be one of my favorite styles), I may have reviewed it differently.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Belgian Dark Strong Ale,83

Sticks to your whole mouth. Lightly bitter and raisin flavors. Spicy. Did I mention very sweet? Very still. Long sticky molasses and light bitter aftertaste. This is ambitious to be sure but just too sweet for me. Beyond that, a good beer.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Belgian Dark Strong Ale,83
10099,1180,travolta,2.88,"12 oz bottle  Apperance: The color is nice. It is a golden amber. Not very red, but right in the middle of gold and amber. The head was thick, but not creamy or rocky. The head was mostly flat, but well balanced. A head you would see on a TV commercial for beer. Head retention is acceptable, and lacing is nice.  Nose: Rum, carmel, and alcohol. I dont get any raisins. Alcohol is very present. Actually, maybe a little tiny bit at the end (raisin). Carmel and malt are nice to smell here. A simple, but hard to discover nose.  Taste: Very alcoholic at first. now that I have tasted it fully, it is alcoholic all the way through. i still get some malt and carmel, but the raisin thing is almost non-existant. It is crisp, but not from carbonation. It is crisp from the alcohol on the nose and tounge.  Notes: The apperance of this brew is the best part. To be honest, the head and color and lacing are not all that inpressive either. It's an 8%ABV, so I respect it. Money well spent if your looking for a clean buzz at a decent price from nice beer.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Belgian Dark Strong Ale,83
10099,1180,ecoboy,3.26,"More interesting than terribly enjoyable. Recommended for the unique sensations than as a belgian strong dark exemplar. Rather rough on the number scale, I'm afraid.  To me, the scents of this ale and its flavor are well partnered: sweet dried fruits anchor the flavor and the aroma is redolent of fig, prune and dried sour cherry. The fruit flavors are complex. But the nature of the beer is all about that flavor, with no grain character prevalent in the flavor, and a bit of heaviness where a dazzling Belgian yeast might make this brew a little lighter on the tongue.  It's a ""here, isn't this interesting?"" beer.  Enough. This is certainly neither a disappointing, nor indeed any kind of negative experience. Someone with a steamy bowl of indian pudding with hard sauce or a slab of hot gingerbread might reach for this ale with flavors of Thanksgiving. It really seems like an old-fashioned flavor, and as I noted before, pretty darned unique.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Belgian Dark Strong Ale,83

The head, though, was smaller than expected and disappeared quickly. I loved the way it smelled with the rummy, raisin aroma with a background of alcohol. The taste wasn't quite as good but still okay. Compared to other Belgian Dark Ales, it would not make the list of favorites. As a beer, it feels good in the mouth and was drinkable despite the 8% alcohol content.

Beautiful fragrance. Taste is spectacular, Belgian-like but more than unique enough for DFH. Having brewed with raisins, I can tell they're in there, but masked behind candied fruit and a nice mild hop.  Simply wonderful beer from DFH, easily a top five beer for me.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Belgian Dark Strong Ale,83

The smell was of malt goodness with a little citrus and fruitiness, maybe a little pine flavor?.  The flavor was a blend of fruit flavor and malt with a hop aftertaste. Seems like a bad mix of good flavors found in most belgians.  The mouthfeel was syrupy and astringent.

Aroma: Slightly acidic and very sweet  Taste: Dazzling fruitiness on the tip of the tongue quickly followed by a very complex malt assortment. After the finish...the sweetness continues to dominate for 12 - 15 seconds.  Mouthfeel: This is a very big beer with effervescent qualities...kind of like a stout and a frambois all rolled into one.

10099,1180,BierReise,4.09,12oz Bottle packaged in Jan 03. Poured clear brownish orange with a head that thinned out quickly leaving barely a thin film. Aroma is slightly spicy and with sugar and raisins present. Belgian yeast also very evident in aroma. Crisply carbonated mouthfeel that is medium bodied and smooth. Alcohol goes undetected here in both aroma and flavor. Flavor is sugary sweet with notes of dried fruit. Very good flavors. Overall top notch Belgian style.

10099,1180,Stimack,2.81,"This brew poured to a cloudy red-brown color with a small light tan head that did not have much retention.  The brew smells of rum, very noticeable once poured, fruit (mostly raisins) and caramel. An interesting brew, but not one that smells really great.  The taste is upfront is pretty good, seems to be under carbonated but not bad. The finish reminds me of stronger alcohol as I have a taste in the back of my mouth that reminds me of rum.

In mouth, the body is medium, rather tongue cleaning. Respectable complexity, lots of yeasty fruitiness (pears, bananas, oranges) a bit like Dominus Vobiscum Ambrée, bready, malty and big notes of pepper reminiscent of Ambrel.

Smell is off dried fruits ( no surprise since its brewed with raisns) Taste starts off caramel like with notes of sweetness and more dried fruit. Hops arent strong, but slip in at the end to keep the beer from becoming a bit to cloying overall. Mouthfeel is a bit sweet and sticky but not overly so. Would be a really nice post dinner beer.

10099,1180,Quaffer,3.15,"The bottle states, ""A deep mahogany ale brewed with Belgian beet sugars, green raisins and a sense of purpose."" I'd like to know what that ""purpose"" is, because I had a hard time telling what they were trying to do with this brew.  Appearance: This was a hazy, amber-orange beer that poured with a coarse, almost white, head. It rose up to just under two fingers and was quick to disappear. A small amount of bubbles remained floating on the surface for awhile, but even this was gone well before the beer was finished. There was no lacing.  Smell: This beer was extremely sweet smelling. There was a combination of many different fruit aromas. I think that I could even smell the raisins, though the background information about the beer might have had me searching for the aroma. A little bit of tart cherry was detected as well, combined with a bready maltiness that helped give some body to the smell. Overall, it didn't smell bad, but it didn't do much for me either.  Mouthfeel: Almost medium-bodied, with a very smooth and coating feeling on the tip of the tongue. As the beer moved back in the mouth, it picked up a lot of carbonation tingle to the point of becoming too rough.  Taste: Whoa, this was not was I was expecting after the syrupy sweetness that dominated the smell of the beer. The first sip was very tart (in a good way), but it became more subdued after my palatte got used to the taste. It still remained rather sour, though, with a strong vinuous component to it. Tart cherry, green apple, red wine, and (yes, there they are again) raisins combined to form the bulk of the flavor. There was also a fairly strong alcohol presence that really came through on the finish. Some very light notes of malt sweetness finally emerged in the aftertaste, but they did nothing to combat the dry, tannic bitterness/sourness that also came through.  Note: After adding the yeast to the glass, the taste did soften up and balance out better, but the negative qualites (tannic and overly strong alcohol flavors) were still there.  This was an interesting beer, but not one that I would want on a regular basis. I'm really not sure what it is that they are going for with this one. The beer did nothing to hide the alcohol, and the astringent quality in the aftertaste was annoying. Maybe some age would help it out.

I really think there's some great mixing of sweet and sour in this brew. The mouthfeel is thicker than expected. It's not cloying and very drinkable.  Personally, I think this is a nice DFH brew.

Poured a very dark brown color with a compact ¼"" vanilla hued head that quickly dwindled down to a thin ring and left no lace. The smell was of brown sugar, bready malts, some dark fruit and an almost overpowering alcohol aroma. The aroma of medicinal alcohol came off the glass in waves and kept interfering with attempts to decipher any other other smells. The taste was quite sweet up front; lots of sugar and raisins with an earthy malt base. The sweetness crowded out any other flavors except for a strong astringent alcohol flavor that just overran the palate like a horde of barbarians laying waste to a medieval village. The feel was medium-bodied, rather crisp and puckering and dry. Overall, this just wasn't one of Dogfish Head's better brews, IMO. There was no effort to disguise the alcohol content.

I had no idea they offered so many kinds of beer. I picked up the Tackle Box to try some other kinds since I liked the porter so much and discovered that The Raison is not to be fooled with. It'll get you when your not looking. It poured out a nice dark brown in color. The nose was pretty sweet but it also smelled like it could have a bite. (and did) The head came and went rather quickly. You could definetly taste the green raisons which was much nicer than I thought. The flavor lingered long after swallowing.

It is not a bad beer, but its novelty wears off quickly. Pours a medium brown with zero head. And I mean zero. Smell is of raisons and alcohol. Taste is pretty much the same. Very sweet. At first the melding of the raisons and the belgian beer sugars is interesting, but eventually it kinda overpowers your taste buds.

Lots of bubbles racing to the top on this beer. The smell is really strong with alcohol and has a slight brown sugary sweetness. The taste is malt heavy on top. It's sweet but not residually sweet. Maybe thats the belgian beet sugars coming into play. There's a base of caramel malt in here also but it only hints at coming out never really becoming a strong flavor. Alcohol is present the whole time and becomes exceedingly strong towards the end. Belgian yeast provides a slight offset to the alcohol but not enough and is different in its own right. The body is rather thin, maybe because of strong alcohol precense or lack of carbonation, and it's not the smoothest beer.

Theres also a modest warning of alcohol to this one. I wouldnt be surprised if the ABV was higher than advertised.  Taste  The fruits came out more in the taste. This was very nice but I would have liked to have seen a little more yeast at the tongue. This has an excellent flavor though, and the dark mark is still noticeable.  Mouthfeel  No carbonation and somewhat thin for a BSDA. I would have preferred something a little more lively.  Drinkability  Very drinkable example of the style.

10099,1180,DagFishHead,4,"Appearance: Slightly hazy, copper/bronze-amber body, considerable frothy tan-orange head fades quickly to a thin, broken cap with creamy lace. Smell: Foxy grape, earthy, musty, sweet caramel/toffee malt, rum-raisin and a huge whiff of alcohol. Taste: Sweet carmelized sugars with tart vinous grape/raisin, full at the top with yeasty tartness and carbonation fizz at the top, impressive bitter hopping leaves a dry fruit afterteaste. Mouthfeel: Full-bodied malt, tingly/crisp but low level carbonation. Warm alcohol glow. Drinkability: Straight marks. A good choice if you're looking for a one-off ale to think about while sipping, as opposed to a session.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Belgian Dark Strong Ale,83
10099,1180,Maestro,3.35,"I have been curious about this beer. I am not a fan of Belgian-style beers but have heard good things about this beer. It is good but not anything to write home about. There is a sweet aroma that is very much in tune with the name. There is no head. The taste is somewhat layered with lots of fruitiness and maltiness. There is a citrus undertone that is quite a balance with the sweetness. The beer's alcohol content is warming and cheerful. That is the strong point, and that is not much of one. I won't seek this one out again but would choose it over many other things.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Belgian Dark Strong Ale,83
10099,1180,jed,3.7,"Appearance: Pours a dark, mahogany, reddish brown color with one finger of light, white head. Weak head retention, not much in the way of lacing.  Smell: Initially, green raisins provide immediate fruity smelly. Strong ester alcohol smell quickly evident and a bit unpleasant.  Taste: Very sweet, fruity nose  raisins, caramels, plums  with mild carbonation makes this fairly smooth. Again, almost overpowering alcohol content kicks in, with warm boozy aftertaste. Raison D'Être almost tastes like beer with some rum dropped in. Not much in the way of hops, although some malt is noticeable. Mouthfeel is slightly above average, although it could use more carbonation.  Drinkability: The huge, noticeable alcohol content of this beer detracts from drinkability.  The first few times I had this, it was almost undrinkable. I can now appreciate the flavor more, although the strong, unbalanced alcohol still detracts from the taste of the green raisins. An interesting beer and definitely worth trying, but not something I see myself going back to frequently.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Belgian Dark Strong Ale,83
10099,1180,UnionMade,3.7,"The beer is a chill hazed mahogany brown, topped with a dissipating mist of sandy colored head. The beer takes on a greenish cast when viewed through light. Interesting. The head dies to a thin ring almost immediately. The aroma is definitely complex. Lots of caramel malt, with a strange candi sugar sweetness and belgian yeast. Lots of esters, with heaps of pear, plum, cherry, and fig. The green raisin is apparent, with some vague herbal hops. A bit of coffee and chocolate. The flavor starts out malty sweet, with a slight burnt toffee taste and that wierd candi sugar. (I look at the label in my collection and apparently it's beet sugar) Slightly phenolic esters kick in towards the middle, providing loads of fruity flavors. Hints of clove, fig, plum, and lots of green raisin carrying into the finish. The beet sugar carries through as well, plowing through the hops, which make a whisper of an appearance before they retreat, allowing the raisin sweetness to carry through. The beet sugar and raisin flavors linger into a long finish, and stick around for a while in the aftertaste. Medium to full bodied, with moderate, unassuming carbonation. Definitely an interesting and complex beer. The beet sugar, while strange, proves to be tasty. The beer is certainly drinkable, although I don't think I could drink more than a couple pints before wanting to switch it up to something else.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Belgian Dark Strong Ale,83
10099,1180,BitteBier,3.97,"Slightly hazy copper-amber pour topped off with a small amount of brown foam. Thick, rich smell with notes of caramelized brown sugar. The substantial alcohol content is detectable in the nose as well, though not offensively. An interesting combination of taste and mouthfeel--silky sweet malts at the onset with a taste that thins out (bringing the alcohol to great prominence) while a powdery texture remains. The texture and chocolately notes are vaguely reminiscent of a glass of cocoa. This is the first Dogfish offering I've had that I would buy again.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Belgian Dark Strong Ale,83
10099,1180,BillyBrew,3.13,"Another Dogfish Head is lost on me. I do appreciated the effort on this brew, but it took a while to finish a sixer.  'Deep mahogany' colour, yellowy brown, not tan. Almost no head, but a fine ring with no stick.  Odd weak fruit nose, the raisons, I guess. Very light nose.  That malty taste conglomeration from Belgium beers that I cannot comprehend. Silky smooth, but 'off' tasting to me. No hop flavour, but not unbalanced (?). I can imagine raisons, but might be just my mind. I understand the appeal, but not up my alley.  Very smooth, silky medium body with a quickly fading aftertaste.  Cheers",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Belgian Dark Strong Ale,83
10099,1180,mschofield,3.08,"Medium red with a small white cap, no real head. An almost vegetable aroma with isopropyl alcohol. Molasses, rum soaked raisin, and again the vegetable in the taste. Medium body, very sweet. It feels like a lot of things were thrown together and not allowed to blend. Unfinished - they need to go back to the books and tweak this one. I could take or leave it, but I wouldn't buy again.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Belgian Dark Strong Ale,83
10099,1180,putnam,4.89,"Aromas of molasses, brown sugar, rum and whipped cream. As I rock it back toward my mouth my sinuses are filled with an impression of smoky hard wood.

10099,1180,erica,4.13,"A good one by Dog Fish Head. It was a nice amber color with a sweet aroma- almost too sweet I thought. It tasted good, sweet again but too sweet, a touch of spice, and some fruitiness. And I did taste that 'sense of purpose' that it's brewed with! The mouthfeel was not too thick or too thin, which I like in a beer. I dont like to feel like I might have to chew it, and if I had more than one at the time I drank it, I would've had more- great drinkability.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Belgian Dark Strong Ale,83

Can't say I'm impressed with this brew, but it's up against some topnotch competitors.  It poured into the glass a beautiful mahogany colour, but the minimal head quickly dissipated without any lacing.  Aroma of dried apricots and raisins raised expectations, but initial mouthful was of carbonation, hops,and yeast. Better let this one warm up a bit. Somewhat nicer nearer room temperature, but just not my style.

10099,1180,RockyTopHeel,3.85,"Shimmering copper color with suspended sediment - yeast and a thin, off-white head. Scent is soft with hints of candied fruit. The flavor has sweetness of golden raisins, with prevalent influence of a malty softness and intermittent hops, with a sweet kiss of alcohol in the finish. Underneath these more noticeable flavors is a bitterness--almost chocolate or coffee like in a stout, but closer to caramel in depth--that emerges as the beer warms. There's a definite richness to this one, but it's still drinkable, and the sediment I first noticed was a nice touch of yeast.  I like it.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Belgian Dark Strong Ale,83

I like the fact these guys take chances and are always trying new combinations (and they are local) but this one was a little to rough for my taste. The appearance was a deep mahogany color and the pour did not produce much of a head. A clingy lace hung down the glass till the bitter (and I mean bitter) end. A heavy scent of raison, figs, etc... were a change for me but overall it was a little heavy handed for me --- the ABV was way high and actually took over the taste of the brew overall. I couldn't drink a lot of this, but every once in a while on a cold winter night, this could be a good companion.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Belgian Dark Strong Ale,83
10099,1180,saltydog,4.42,"The beer seems to me to be seriously underrated by many of the other writers here, but here goes, anyway. Appearance: Reddish orange, clear, prominent head which leaves some very nice lace. Smell: Sweet, some fruitness and spiciness from the fermentation. Flavor: Very smooth. There is a complex flavor, with a mixture of malty, spiciness, the sugars and raison add up the a dense mixture of dates, figs, and fruitcake like flavors, but the overall effect is clean and uncluttered, amazingly enough. I remember this beer when it first came out, and it was quite tasty but much rougher than it is now. It is clearly a model in eccentric brewing these days.

Even though I don't rate this specific beer particularly high, I do give them credit for a truly interesting and original beer.  Raison D'etre pours with out a head. I egan to question the carbonation of this beer (no worris in that department though). Very little to no head. It has an amber-orange body with a very, very, thin head clinging to the glass.  An interesting and unusual, as far as the beers I've sampled, aroma. Smells incredibly sweet and malty. Almost comparable to sweet apples, plums, and (I hesitate) raisons. There is a subtle alcohol qualities in the aroma (I meant incredibly subtle).  The taste is, without doubt, sweet. Malty and decently fruity. Very little bitterness but the hops and alcohol succeed in balanceing the sweetness quite well. There is no single flavor that really stands out in this beer.  I genuinely like and appreciate this beer.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Belgian Dark Strong Ale,83

Little retention and light lacing. Aroma is fruity with some serious spice and alcohol. Rather intriguing, and a word of caution for what is about to come. Starts out thick and syrupy. Little to no carbonation. Tangy fruit and alcohol tastes overwhelm the palate. Almost medicinal in flavor. Spice and sweet caramel malt become more present. Hops are barely detectable. Aftertaste is dry and still heavy with alcohol.  This one kind of grew on me as I drank it. Maybe this is so because it warmed slightly? Nah, probably just the alcohol talking.

I couldn't make out any Belgian beet sugars, green raisins (or sense of purpose). The taste of the beer was also dominated by alcohol. Not particularly flavourful. Came across as quite astringent.

The deep amber to bronze body is fairly hazed to cloudy and is capped by a decent tan head that retains well and laces with gusto.  The nose is heavily caramel malt and this carries in to the sweet malt flavor that is dedicated fairly substantially to the sweet side of beer. Notes of pungent fruitiness seem to also come through here, perhaps a bit like dried friuts such as apple. The alcohol is noticeable and also limits, to some degree, the drinkability.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Belgian Dark Strong Ale,83

The aroma was sweet and the raisins were the most obvious part of it. The flavor was reeeaaaly sweet. It was a little malty and hoppy, but not very carbonated.

10099,1180,ngandhi,3.5,"Raison D'etre has no reason for being a Belgian strong dark ale. While styles can run into each other, I identified this as a doppelbock before I checked BA. The amber/mahogany beer is medium-bodied. Though a touch overfizzed in the mouthfeel, the head is still pathetic and subsides very quickly to a splotchy ring with some lacing.  As I bring the pint glass to my mouth, I take in very alcoholic fruits. The smell of alcohol -- straight, grain alcohol -- begins to overwhelm. Yet, when the beer is brought to the lips, those green raisins (or is it just the power of suggestion?) sideswipe the phenols and leave me with a Belgian meets doppelbock palette. The heavy brown sugar flavor (I'm guessing this is the beet) suggests malty doppelbock. Tons of pear. Considering Trois Pistoles is about as good as this style gets (even though it's made in Canada), DFH falls embarassingly short. Compared to Salvator, however, it holds ground. What's a BA to do?  The ultimate taste of this beer, though confused, is in the Belgian Strong Dark family -- the strong phenols, less than robust malt, gritty yeast, and bittering demand it; Raison d'Etre is a bastard child.  I like what the raisins do here, and I appreciate the use of natural sugars. Over the course of a glass, this beer grows on me (perhaps it's the alcohol talking). Nevertheless, it seems quite lost; drinking it is chaos, like the world's greatest clam chowder to a man lost in the Sahara.  As it warms, it mellows significantly -- I start to think dark Belgian. A lot of the hop bite and carbonated sting dissipates. Dark fruits flash their sweet, rich bodies and each sip finishes dry but fruity, almost like boxed red wine. Not bad. Not beer of the year.

Hints of brown sugar and molasses with syrupy undertones.  Taste: Nice hoppiness off the top accompanied by a trace of woodiness. The sweetness quickly appears and again is highlighted by brown/raw sugar and probably molasses. There is a hint of dark fruitiness but it is overshadowed by other flavours. Alcohol kick on the finish.  Mouthfeel: A moderatley lively beer with a dry fuzzy mouthfeel. The finish leans towrds the drier side.

Carmel melds with fruit and sugar to form a tantilzing dessert-like sweetness. Very silky to the tongue with light carbonation -- there really was almost no head on this beer except with a brutally aggressive pour. Alcohol gets obvious pretty fast. Aftertaste has an odd, almost-roasted bitterness that sweeps up everything but a barely lingering SunMaid raisin kick. Tossing any notion of style into the wind, I think this may be a bit of a love/hate beer. It's unique, and the alcohol is a bit noticeable.

Taste: Grape flavor continues into the taste. Not a lot of initial malt flavor, virtually no hop presence. It's reminiscent of the midas touch, except this beer has a much heavier mouthfeel.

The taste was very nice. Fully bodied and very malty. Light carbonation. Soft caramel. Soft fruit flavors, green raisin, even hints of grass. There was a firm bitterness and earth hop flavor, but they sat evenly with the malt. It had an almost creamy texture but at the same time was very smooth. It ended slightly bitter and malty, but died off rather quickly.  This is a very interesting beer because it's not exactly trying to be any one style. It's very malty, raisiny, and has the belgian yeast flavor, but isn't trying to be a belgian. It's just a smooth, wonderfully flavorful, malty, fruity, balanced beer that's addicting to drink.

What impresses me the most about it is the evenness of the flavor - for me it really starts and finishes the same and then the aftertaste is just a slow releasing of the same flavor.

This offering is a lively red-copper color, of the type that seems to give off more light than it draws in. Aroma is a slightly sugary harbinger of high-octane brewing, without revealing the entire flavor profile.  Taste is first and foremost highly fermented sugars, with an almost syrupy note of raisins. Belgian-style yeast makes itself known with moderate ester flavor. There is little traditional malt nor hop flavor to this, only raisins, sugars (from beets, according to the label), yeasty, fruity esters, and alcohol.

10099,1180,TXHops,2.88,"-ABV: 8% -IBUs: 36  Mmmmbeet sugar. Nothing beats beet sugar as a non-malt fermentable, except maybe green raisins DFHs Raison Detre refuses to compromise, and includes both The beer pours a solid, clear, deep amber and supports a better head than the 8% ABV would suggest, though its not great. An aroma of alcohol and cider do not make a promising first impression. The flavor is more beery than the aroma suggestsbrown sugar and cinnamon mingle with fluffy carbonation and no hop character to create a Belgian flavored, spiced English strong ale-type concoction. I tried this beer on tap once while in Delaware and thought it was too cidery and thin to merit any further tasting. The bottled version appears to taste less cidery (though still more cidery than most beers) and slightly more complex. Some of the other flavors seem to add a degree of Belgian spiciness and depth in the flavor that even the slightly vegetal finish doesnt detract too much from.  All in all, Id chalk this one up as Dogfish having pushed the envelope a little too far beyond the beer boundaries and into the experimental, novelty category. The concept is way more intriguing than the flavor. The beer finishes long, fluffy, slightly sour and fake. It tastes exactly like Id expect a beer with a large percentage of non-malt fermentables would tastecidery (again). Oh well, theres still the continuously hopped beers.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Belgian Dark Strong Ale,83
10099,1180,brewdlyhooked13,4.48,"Merriam-Webster defines mahogany as simply a reddish-brown. It's a good call on the color, I got no problem with it. No head when poured in typical fashion into a pint glass. Slightly cloudy and even a strand of suspended yeast when the last few drops were poured in a few moments ago.  Aroma has lots of malt and raisins with a side of yeast. Sweet smelling enough that if it were daytime and I were outside, those damn fruit flies would be taking headers into my glass and I'd end up drinking their dumb ass.  Taste is a mix of malt, raisins, and a certain 'greenness' and woodiness. Alcohol is hidden quite well when cold and only moderately more prevalent at room temps. Snappy, yeasty, perhaps even cinnamony finish. I remember that flavor from opening night at Hofbrauhaus Newport with the Weizen, I think the yeast was very rich that night and hasn't been as strong since :-( Hats off to the brewer for his generous proportions of ingredients. Progressing into the beer, the raisiny component develops some clove character as well.  Mouthfeel is heavier than average, but not overdone. Leaves a firm malty sweet residue in the mouth, maltheads will enjoy this beer.  I think drinkability has two factors, 1) does the alcohol level/presence invite me to enjoy a 2nd, 3rd, 4th?, and 2) is the taste good enough to warrant another round, and another? Raison D'Etre does a great job on both points, I would drink these all night, probably max out at 5, then just switch to water, call a cab, whatever...  Overall, it's not it my top *top* list, but among the leaders in my 'Above Average' category.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Belgian Dark Strong Ale,83
10099,1180,hotstuff,3.8,"This particular brew poured a small white head with small bubbles. The body was mahogany in color and there was no lacing on the sides of my glass.

10099,1180,Stopper,3.25,"Pours a relatively clear dark copper color, with a modest head that slowly fades. Aroma is of a chewy sweet maltiness. The taste is initally a bit of a bready malt flavor, with a lighter mouthfeel than expected from the aroma (due to the beet sugars I guess), followed quickly by a strange bitterness that feels a bit more astringent than a well-done hop bitterness. This bitterness slowly fades to the tip of the tongue leaving a slight burnt flavor, and then disappears several seconds into the aftertaste.  Not my favorite Dogfish Head, but I certainly wouldn't kick her out of bed.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Belgian Dark Strong Ale,83

10099,1180,TheDM,3.9,"This brew poured a small head of fine to mediumly sized off white bubbles and a transparent brown body. With a very mild malt aroma, the flavors and plalate of this brew are definately its stongest points.

10099,1180,SheepNutz,3.85,"I had this one in a 12oz. bottle poured into a pint glass. It pours a deep copper color with 1 finger of head that dies quickly. There is no lacing left on the glass. The smell is a mix of grapes and hops. Without the hops, it would smell just like wine. The taste is a bit of fruit and spice. There is just a little bit of hops. This is a fairly sweet brew. The mouthfeel is very thick. The drinkability is also fair for being 8%.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Belgian Dark Strong Ale,83
10099,1180,bmills1608,4.02,"Poured from the 12 oz bottle a deep amber brown color with excellent clarity. Head was quite weak, very small and faded to a wispy film in less then a minute.  On the nose was various baking spices (unspecified to me), caramel, cinnamon, cherries and some Belgian yeast.  Taste was clean and a bit tart at first, smooth grains, hard candy and alcohol, some more of the same spice that was on the nose and figs. Overall impression of the flavor was smooth and mildly rich. Finished with some alcohol, drying out with some more hard candy sweetness. Mouthfeel was on the lighter side for what I would consider a fairly ""big"" beer.  A very enjoyable ale that is interesting enough to keep you on your toes but is not overly complex or earth shattering.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Belgian Dark Strong Ale,83

The taste was very sweet, with hints of the raisons. The mouthfeel was fairly smooth, and the alcohol wasn't apparent at all. This is definitely a beer I'd have several of.  This is Dogfish Head's attempt to do a Dubbel.

This beer is supposed to be reminicent of a Beligium I have heard but I do not think that is the case. Still, I did not think this beer was as ""off"" as other reviewers have commented. A rather unique flavor to this one, definately some raison notes as well as some dark malt flavor to this beer. Alcohol is there and this is not a beer that I would session because, unlike many beers even of this abv, it felt heavy to me.

Taste also reminds me of pistachios and small hops contribution. I just have pistachios on the brain for this review. I won't have a chance to re-review since this isn't sold in Michigan. I do get some some of nutty flavor though. Slight vegetable taste - from beet sugars?,Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Belgian Dark Strong Ale,83

The aroma is almost overwhelming with a slight bit of hops but mainly a sweet and fruit smell. The raisons and beet sugar really come out in the flavor that is sweet, earthy, spicy and mildly bitter. the first drink is spicy at the begining but this soon dies and you are left with almost a carbonated fruit juice type drink (but in a good way). Overall a really good sipping beer.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Belgian Dark Strong Ale,83

It's smells like no beer i've ever encountered. there is a heavy raisin smell, almost like grape juice. i think there are some other fruity smells in there, but i can't identify them. It's taste is what i would expect from the smell of it. it tastes like a beer/wine hybrid almost. the raisins are again apparent along with some sweet malt flavor. the 8% alcohol is masked well as it does not taste that strong. it has a slight coffee/chocolatey finish. it's mouth feel is nice and pretty thick. overall a decent beer, but nothing i'm going to run out and get again right away.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Belgian Dark Strong Ale,83

Another great offering from Dogfish Head.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Belgian Dark Strong Ale,83
10099,1180,MissOrch,3.16,"This beer has an orangy amber color, with tons of carbonation. It looks like a dark soda, with some tornadoes of bubbles touching down every now and then.  The smell isn't very strong. I wonder if maybe I got a bad bottle because I remember this smelling much better before. Actually, last time I had it was from a cask, so maybe that had something to do with it. When I stick my nose way in there, I smell a little burned caramel, and I like to pretend I smell raisins too... and now my nose is all wet.  The taste is slightly sweet, and has a bitter finish. It leaves my mouth all fizzy and tingly. I can taste the hops, but not as much of the malty sticky sweetness I remember from the cask. Maybe when I went to the bathroom the beer troll came and took a piss in my bottle. Don't get me wrong, it still tastes good, just not nearly as good as I remember.

In a follow on tasting, I served it in a stemmed, tulip shaped glass rather than a pint glass. Wow, it improved the nose tremendously (OK, I don't have a great sense of smell).

Almost cordial-like, this one has a very unique flavor and a pleasant sweetness to it. Could be good if drank warm. A very full flavored beer and is quite drinkable. Beware though: I had this after dinner and went comatose on the couch for about an hour. The alcohol sneakingly crept up on me. I had the 20 percent Raison D' extra version once and that was one isanely sweet, strong and syrupy concoction. This is like a mini version of that beer.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Belgian Dark Strong Ale,83

Fellow BA Eckaholic's tip to serve this in a snifter or tulip shaped glass was on the money. I tried it first in a pint glass, and had my second in a big snifter, and the aroma and taste were more focused in the snifter.  Red Mahogany body, with a white head that disappeared straight away. The aroma was sweet, with raisins, grape, and fresh-cut grass.  Tasting it was special, indeed, with sweet malt, raisins, and caramel balanced with just the right amount of tang and bitterness from the hops and carbonation. Creamy smooth mouthfeel. It finished with a caramel sweetness and a nice hops balance. I didn't realize it was an 8% ABV until my ears got warm, and I looked at the bottle. Very smooth and drinkable, not a trace of alcohol harshness.  A pet peeve from reading other reviews- the spelling of raisin... the dried fruit ends with -in. Raison is NOT fruit, it's the French/Freedom word for reason, as in ""Raison d'etre"" -""Reason for Being"" It's fun wordplay on a number of levels, but it's not how to spell the word that describes the fruit.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Belgian Dark Strong Ale,83

A nice bouquet, but a little ambiguous and light. very pleasant taste, Can taste the raisons, but it's not too much. Feels very nice on the palate. And it leaves me wanting more... very rich.

The nose is grapey and quite fruity...interesting. Tasting reveals lots of sweetness, with a green apple-like note followed by slight slight raisin flavors, then a healthy maltiness picks up. Fruity flavors then become apparent with alcohol esters close behind. Just a minimum of hopping here. Finishes dry and strong/warming. One interesting and funky beer, this one is!

They get off-track and begin to throw ingredients together with no apparent direction in mind. Such is the case with the brewmaster of Raison D'Etre. While not a bad beer, it's clear that this is an experimental concoction. The deep amber color with red tint would be improved with any sign of a lasting head. The full malt body is sweetened beyond any reasonable expectation. ""Oh Boy, Green Raisins! Extra Sugar (""maybe this will help"", yum!)

Slightly sweet aroma, fresh and fruity with a whiff of hops.  First sip brings out a burst of fruit and heavy sweetness -- raisins and grapes and and a mild hoppy after-bite. Very, very rich. Gritty, with some charcoal after swallowing. Good carbonation.  The kind of beer that one is glad to have tasted; not sure I will stand in line to buy it again.

10099,1180,nomad,3.42,"A very muddy burnt umber color, not very appealing as it was quite hazy and a strange color between orange, brown, and ruddy red. Poured with little head that was thin and even, consisting of small tight bubbles. Lace was negligible. Nose was slightly fruity, on the side of bananas, cooked apples, and freshly dried raisins. Also had a woody undertone to it.  First taste was quite tart with a fizzy mouthfeel whose activity gives way to a partly yeasty, partly hoppy bitterness. The session showed it to give way to a consistently tart flavor that balances fruity tartness and a woody (like a oak-aged wine) tartness - for me, reminiscent of a oud bruin or red ale. The fruity sweetness is similar to the nose - a roasted apple and grape type. Subtly long finish as the sweet fruit, tart after-punch, and woody bitterness interchange back and forth on my mouth.  In all, like a toned down triple with more hearty ale-like features: same fruity and floral hop characteristics mixed with a strong earthy side peppery yeast and woody malts. Interesting, but I wouldn't get it again until they've mastered how to mix this experiment with the ratio of it many parts.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Belgian Dark Strong Ale,83

Dogfish is a brewery that might help temper my anathema to straying from Reinheitsgebot. The flavor is only a suggestion, another added layer to the quality of the brew itself.  Appearance: a luscious mahogany-orange, quite clear.  Smell: Not very assertive, but balanced and malty.  Taste. The hops are understated, malts hold the forefront, and a spicy gremlin lurks behind the curtains.  I'd buy it again.

This beer pours out a dark brown, murky red colour with a decent head to it that lasts for the life of the beer and leaves a nice belgian lace on the glass as well. This beer has wonderful aromas, of dark fruits, raisons, figs, currants, sugars, maklts, and some earthy flavors as well. This tasted great. Like a cross between a belgian dark a grand cru and perhaps an old ale...very well done combination of flavors and a good balance as well.

The first thing in the aroma that stood out was the fruit aroma (apples and raisins) along with some traces of mellow spice. The taste is the texture of a fine spiced rum, and there are also hints of the flavor in the brew. Very complex, yet utterly enjoyable, and refreshing. The high ABV of course gives the flavor a little bite, and there is also some candi sugar thrown in here for more sweetness. Alot of malt makes this a treat, along with a good medium body and a somewhat chewy texture. Drinkability is good, but it would be better if this weren't so drinkable with 8% abv one is enough.

There is little or no visible carbonation. The smell is of some fruit with clear malt flavors. The flavor was malty as well, but with some sweet fruit characteristsics as well. I don't know that I rate malty brews so high, this may be the highest malty brew I have rated.

Initial taste is very sweet and caramelized. Then it's toasty, raisin sweetness of course, and a hint of chocolate as well. Alcohol is noticeable but not bothersome. The finish is dry and just slightly bitter, leading to a long and enjoyable sweet aftertaste. A six pack of this beer could last me a week or longer because I didn't find it too easy to drink one right after the other.

Dogfish has successfully pushed the limits of a beer style before but alas, they failed here.

A decent foamy head topped the glass, but I was somehow not as impressed with the visuals here. The smell was very malty sweet, with a touch of alcohol scent. After a while I did notice a fruity, raisin-like smell, as mentioned on the label. Nice complexity. The taste surprised me somewhat. The expected maltiness was there, but the alcohol and an indescribable furity / smoked taste battled for my attention. Also very complex and hard to isolate the flavors. I see why this is labeled a Belgian specialty ale...rather uncharacteristic, but not bad. Very dry taste at the end, too. The mouthfeel was pretty average for the style, though...medium body with a nice tingle, but nothing little else worth mentioning. This is an interesting Belgian derivative that is worth trying.

I like the fact that like all Dogfish brews, this one doesn't easily fit into any category, but the sample case I bought was very disappointing. Hopefully some day I can get some 90 min IPA or WWS to change my mind, but the Tackle Box sampler is wack. The Raison is cloyingly sweet.

The aroma is a little bit of sweetness mingled with some herbal and woody notes. Interesting, bordering on weird. The taste is also odd. The main taste is hard to pinpoint, but it is essentially a woody, slightly smoky malt taste. Throw in a pinch of herbal tea and a splash of vodka to get the idea of this taste. It's not bad, just odd. There seems to be a bit of spice in there as well, but it's hard to pinpoint. Soke residual sweetness on the finish, with just a touch of bitterness. The mouthfeel is very full and smooth. The alcohol warms a bit as it goes down, like a good smooth bourbon. The drinakbility is average due to the odd yet complex flavor profile.

The second time i had it I did poor this beer out of a cold fridge and never let it get to a good temp so the flavors seemed separate.

10099,1180,comat0se,4.92,"Picked this one up in the bargain bin at Corral Liquors in Illinois. The bottle says bottled in April, but I'm not sure what year that it was. There is an 02 on the glass itself, so I'm guessing April 2002.  Unlike some other reviewers of this beer, this beer poured with a massive 1 inch, small bubbled, frothy head. This head had some of the best retention I've ever seen. The last sip still had at least a half inch of foam left. Amazing.  The first aroma I picked up coming out of the bottle was a winey, champagne-like aroma. Closer examination of the aroma from the glass reveals heavy malt and fruits. The appearance of this beer is outstanding: a deep, crystal-clear, ruby/mahogany color. I was expecting a lighter colored beer, and lighter in body (not sure why). This is not what this beer is about. It's a bright, and bold beer. Some might not agree with the beers sweetness, and think it diverges too much from ""what beer should be."" But I think not... I'm continually amazed by what beer can be. This beer has all sorts of things going on. You taste dark fruits, black cherries, chocolate, maybe even cherry coke, followed by a hint of roasted and a bit of pencil flavor (yes, wood pencil) and wisps of hot alcohol. The drinkability is almost soda-like, and it goes down fast, easy and refreshingly so. But this isn't any soda... and the mouthfeel immediately gives that away. It is moderately thick and luxurious, not impeded by a heavy carbonation, but yet having the perfect balance of carbonation. This hides its alcohol very well, only traces emerging from time to time remind you that this is no 3.2% beer. There are very little hops present in this beer. I couldn't detect any hop flavor, but yet the finish of the otherwise sweet beer was dry.  A very nice beer... I want another! Hope I can find it again.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Belgian Dark Strong Ale,83
10099,1180,ElGuapo,3.8,"pours to an amber with a very minimal head atop, but the bubbles that are there are there to stay for a while. you will get sweet malts, caramel, and a little spice in the aroma.  the beer is very smooth with carbonation in check. the body is medium with nice rich consistency. the malts are arranged well, and it is very easy to drink. you will get flavors of caramel, alcohol, and raisons. yes definitely raisons. i didn't expect this, but it was a really unique characteristic. definitely a new experience.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Belgian Dark Strong Ale,83
10099,1180,TheLongBeachBum,3.63,"Dogfish Head  Raison DÊtre, wow - quite a mouthful. Well the 6-Pack Box says that this beer was American Beer of the Year 2000. Hmm.  Pours a brown, deep amber, color, which has a coppery-red hue. Minimal carbonation gives a thin collar like off-white head. Nose is quite funky at first, but I wasnt sure what to make of it. Try again. A very deep inhalation gives Malt with some fruit and a freshly cut damp woody odor. Wee-aard. Tastes reveal a strange brew, akin to not much else that I have tried, like no other. Rather unique then. Warm malts introduce the beer, leading to a confused middle that is quite complex, or is it muddled? It has fruity traits with a mildly warming alcohol effect to which I am very partial. Sticky Toffee residuals are present in the finish. I wonder, if this beer ages well for a year or two, tastes like it would. I am struggling to understand this, and therefore adequately describe this beer. I keep tasting it hoping to clarify the situation  nope, its like as soon as I have drunk it, I forget what it is. A Twilight Zone beer, perhaps!  So this is supposed to be a Belgium-Style beer right?? Well OK, it has some claims I suppose, yeah and I am Howard Hughes love-child. For me, it is much more of an experimental beer, with a cheeky hint of Belgium. However, strange as it is, I think it works. Quite Good in a Weird Way actually.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Belgian Dark Strong Ale,83
10099,1180,ethosx19,2.46,"I got a six pack and was excited to try this. As much as I wanted to like it, I just can't. It poured a dark rich amber with very little head. The aroma was a mix of raisons and alcohol - they don't mix well. It tasted of malt and raisons with a creamy alcohol finish. I didn't like the raisons and I didn't like the alcohol taste. I'm going to age these a few months and hope they improve. On the plus side, one beer at 8% did give me a buzz on an empty stomach.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Belgian Dark Strong Ale,83
10099,1180,mickeymac,4.32,"Specialty beer, indeed. It's a nice brownish red with a smallish head. The smell is funky-fruit with a trace of hops and definitely unique. Green raisins? It sounds odd, but it works. The fruity flavor dominates, but it doesn't overwhelm the beer. The smell and taste of alcohol are noticeable but appropriate for an 8.0% abv beer. The drinkability is good, although this is certainly not a session beer. It seems to be a love it or hate it beer.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Belgian Dark Strong Ale,83
10099,1180,IrishRedRock,3.4,"This is an odd beer. I like Dogfish Head in that they are a somewhat adventurous brewery, but I don't really know whats going on with this brew. It pours a clear tan with no head at all really. Not much of an aroma either, some mild malt, caramel, and alcohol.  Taste has some malt character, but sadly there are not many hops to be found. Smooth mouthfeel backed with a kick of alcohol that is quite warming and pleasant, with a bit of a dry finish. Has kind of a cheap beer flavor to it, and unfortunately it almost tastes like a fine malt liquor. Anyone seen a 40 oz of this around? ;)",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Belgian Dark Strong Ale,83
10099,1180,MJR,3.2,"Appearance: Pours a clear, garnet/mahogany color with a small tan head that, like all of Dogfish Head's beers, disappears quickly.  Smell: Brown sugar, caramel, and a wierd sweetness I can't put my finger on.  Taste: A mixture of alcohol, brown sugar, caramel, sweet fruit, and malt. Not much in the way of hops. Finishes with a strong alcoholic bite.  Mouthfeel: Fairly light body with a dry finish. Strong alcohol presence from start to finish.  Drinkability: Well...it's not a bad beer. The flavor is certainly interesting, but I don't see myself coming back to this one. To me, this is one of those 'try it once and move on' beers.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Belgian Dark Strong Ale,83
10099,1180,feloniousmonk,4.73,"Small head, deep garnet color. Soft aroma, very subtle. ""Brewed with Belgian beet sugars, green raisins, and a sense of purpose."" Taste this beer and happiness follows! This is beautiful and unique! Low carbonation, high hops, little malt that I can detect, but just the right amount of sweetness, and an utterly original flavor. This is a special occasion beer, for when you need a special reward.Light texture, soft and sweet, it's the flavor that makes this a standout brew. Time and again, I turn folks on to incredible beer like this and they are amazed that there's great beer coming out of Kalamazoo or Pennsylvania or Delaware. Proof again that ""you can search the world over and never find a better beer"" than those made by craft brewers here in the U.S.A.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Belgian Dark Strong Ale,83
10099,1180,mrjimcat,2.56,Tried this brew and was not that impressed. The bouquet was heavy with solvent alcohol. The deep color was attractive but the taste was not that appealing. Interesting but not very appealing. The bitterness was appropriate and was followed by a strong and warm alcohol finish. The sample I tasted had virtually no head. It was not at all reminiscent of Belgians I have tasted which were all lively and bubbly. I would not buy more of this flavor.,Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Belgian Dark Strong Ale,83
10099,1180,purplehops,4.42,"This ale pours with a deep mahogany/redwood color and and head that fades quickly. For most beers I would say the quick fading head would be a negative, but I don't think it was a major distraction for this ale. The aroma coming from the glass takes your mind away from the head. The aroma is full of orchard odors, fruity and fresh, like a good Belgian ale. There is also a touch of alcohol in the aroma that hints to what is to come.  The taste and flavor is a complex arrangement of specialty malts followed by fruit and spice and finishing with a warmth of alcohol from the beet sugars. The alcohol stays with you long after the last sip. This makes for a very nice after dinner ale. This is also a nice sitting around the fire after long winter day ale. As the label states this ale has ""a sense of purpose"".",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Belgian Dark Strong Ale,83
10099,1180,QXSTER1,3.58,"I couldn't get excited about this beer. Everything is there but not put together in a sophisticated fashion. Deep copper color, and a non-existent head. Nose is sweet and phenolic with some fruitiness. The taste is one dimensional, a bit grapey but nothing jumps out to grab your attention. A wouldn't call this a Belgian style, the complex yeast notes and intense flavors just aren't there. It didn't improve with warming either.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Belgian Dark Strong Ale,83
10099,1180,rastaman,4.34,"Yeah!!! Very nice stuff. The only downer was it maintained zero head, beautiful mahogany colour. Lots of raisins, caramel, touch of port and some smoke. Palate is complex round, raisiny, port-like, toasty, oaky, spicy, with some peppery alcohol in the finish, very resiny, oily, creamy and round, lots of flavours to describe in this one, excellent stuff",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Belgian Dark Strong Ale,83
10099,1180,Wildman,4.19,"This beer poured a dark reddish color and formed a small bubbly white head that didn't hold and left little lace. Some carbonation present. An aroma of caramel and other candy frangrances. Flavor of caramel and raisins with a slight hint of the alcohol present. A good beer, but not a traditional style belgian. Typical Dogfish experimenting.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Belgian Dark Strong Ale,83
10099,1180,jreitman,3.78,"Nice nearly opaque dark brownin color with a white head that fades fast. The aroma very much reminded me of a less tart Rodenbach as it had a biting, tart smell. Belgian yeast and candy sugars smells were also apparent. As it sits, the raisins really start the show themselves in the nose. Mouthfeel was pretty lacking IMO feeling very oily and without much body. Fairly sweet flavored with some unidentifiable fruit flavors lying underneath. Finishes somewhat dry with a slight hop bite.  Thanks to NeroFiddled for hooking me up",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Belgian Dark Strong Ale,83
10099,1180,HopheadEd,4.2,"The last line on the label says ""brewed with a sense of purpose."" Well the purpose is to make me happy! Pours a dark mahogany color with a limited head that leaves patchy lace. First aroma is of fruits, not sweet, not sour. A taste of Belgian candy, alcohol, and a crisp finish. For an 8% ale, very drinkable. Excellent ale.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Belgian Dark Strong Ale,83
10099,1180,Winter,2.67,"I picked up a six-pack of this beer with high hopes, based on a friend's recommendation and the great reviews that it had received. Nice mahogany color. Thin head dissipated quickly. At room temperature aroma has hints of carmel and raisin. Initial bland fruit taste surronds then is swept away by overpowering alcohol flavor. Combination of carbonation and alcohol tingles the tongue. Complex finish gives the ale its ""sense of purpose"" as the label states. Flavor definitely seems to improve as the beer warms to room temperature. This is the first Dogfish Head brew that I've tried and it has taken 2 separate attempts at drinking it to warm up to it.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Belgian Dark Strong Ale,83
10099,1180,StevieW,4.32,"Deep burgundy color, thin beige head. Lots of rich warm smells of rum cake. Candied fruit apples and raisons are very noticable. Taste is smooth, sweet, and very inviting. Bready flavor matched with nice warming alcohol. Taste is much of liquid rum soaked raison bread. Very smooth, and rich going down, but also matched with a slippery candy, syrupy feeling. HIgh abv does catch up with you. One of these a night. This was a much anticipated beer, had multiple samples at the 2002 GABF.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Belgian Dark Strong Ale,83
10099,1180,jmatthew,3.06,"As the bottle states, this is a deep mahogany beer, to which I cannot disagree. Rather attractive in the glass, the nose is bread-like with hints of caramel and a bit of mustiness, which seems both promising and forboding. As could be expected from a beer of 8% abv, alcohol plays strongly in the flavor. Unfortunately, the alcohol was a bit too strong on the opening of the flavor, rather than rounding it out with some warmth. Once past the alcohol, candy sugars dominate with the green raisins surfacing nicely to give some identifiable flavor to the otherwise anonymous swetnesss. Not quite as much body as anticipated but decent warmth due to the alcohol. Undoubtedly some credit is due for a bit of uniqueness, but I felt the alcohol could stand to be tamed a bit. Didn't find myself longing for another.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Belgian Dark Strong Ale,83
10099,1180,pbrian,3.7,"I've never had ""rum soaked raisins"" but have probably used the description in past reviews. After this beer I can more confidently say that I've actually had them. Other than that, it seemed a little flat and alcohol-laden to me, but it was fun to drink one of them.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Belgian Dark Strong Ale,83
10099,1180,Jason,3.44,"This beer certainly has some chill haze problems, the head was not much better either. Smelled of rum, caramel, raisins, solvent alcohol and some other odd fruit.  The taste was the same with more of an expressive solvent alcohol that bordered on a rubbing alcohol flavour. Syrupy and slick with sweet malty and alcohol flavours, a bit softer and more palatable than in the bottle.  Not too bad, you just have to remember that it is 8.0% abv and not to suck it down like any other beer that is on-tap.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Belgian Dark Strong Ale,83
10099,1180,marc77,3.45,"Garnet hue w/ good clarity, topped by a quickly dissapating head. No lace is left. Leafy tobacco & raisiny, dark caramel Special B (and / or real raisins?) sweetness in aroma. Light acetaldehyde as well. Deeply caramelized sweetness hits the palette initially, but vinous flavors & mild bubblegum esters quickly follow. A bit cidery from the dark candi sugar in the grist. Hop bitterness is mild, but manages to offset the relatively high residual sweetness. Lightly bodied, w/ a mouthfeel that borderlines on being thin. Finishes clean, dry w/ a fading molasses flavor. Although a tasty brew, I was expecting greater complexity and richness. Raison D'etre is without flaws, however.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Belgian Dark Strong Ale,83
10099,1180,proc,4.6,"An incredible beer. Pours out to a darker than expected amber with a slight head. Smell is that of fruit. The taste is fantastic. Fruit and licorice seem prevelant and the alcohol is hidden quite well. As it warms up, it gets better.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Belgian Dark Strong Ale,83
10099,1180,NeroFiddled,4.05,"An unusual and interesting beer, but then aren't all of the Dogfish Head beers? It took a long time for this beer to grow on me. It pours a deep crimson-mahogany with a creamy light tan head that drops quickly to just a collar (probably from the high alcohol). I like the aroma of dark caramels (toffee) and fruit. The flavor offers up a lot of alcohol, some dark fruity (raisins) maltiness, and some balancing bitterness. The flavor is actually quite toasty with a fig-like fruitiness. The finish is dryish and not nearly as complex as the flavor but does have a lingering sweet raisin-like note that's quite nice. The high level of alcohol is quite hidden. Overall, this is an expansive beer that doesn't reveal itself at first and deserves some extra attention and a few re-visits. It's a beer that I drink when I know I'm not having another but I still want something unusual and rich. Very well done and certainly worth a try. I've also noticed that this ages exceptionally well with bottles that are at least 6 months old becoming much smoother, and bottles that are a year or more old revealing a deeper character.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Belgian Dark Strong Ale,83
10099,1180,Longstaff,2.93,"I bought a six pack of this due to the high reviews it gets here and other people's recommendations and I have been trying my best to like it. I tried it cold and warm, with food and without, even with a cigar, and it just doesn't seem to cut the mustard for me.  I find it to be overly sweet with brown sugar and raisin flavors that don't blend well with the alcohol flavors. I will say that this is a well crafted and complex beer, but all the different flavors just don't seem to come together. That makes me 0 for 2 with Dogfish Head. BTW, it totally ruined the flavor of the nice Cuban I was smoking.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Belgian Dark Strong Ale,83
10099,1180,Jdiddy,4.58,"I was really blown away by this. I guess it is considered a Belgian Ale, although it does not taste much like Chimay or the others. I actually like this a bit better than the usual Belgians. It is very full, somewhat heavy, and awesome all around! The smell is that of raisins and a touch of alcohol (but not overpowering). The taste is bold and fruitlike (raisins, currants). The alcohol comes through in the taste but in all the right places. Exceptional beer!!!",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Belgian Dark Strong Ale,83
10099,1180,aracauna,4,"I drank this in contrast to the Chimay Red I tried tonight. Less of the Y-grass/raw carrot taste than the chimay, but more of the raisony flavor a lot of belgians have. Perhaps because I also drank the World Wide Stout on the same tasting, I also noticed a lot more caramelly/toffeeish flavors than in a typical belgian. I like the dark malt flavors in this beer. Makes for a nice twist on a Belgian. Palate still heavily carbonated, but less fuzzy than chimay. This beer is also more ruby and less brown than the Chimay.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Belgian Dark Strong Ale,83
10099,1180,ADR,4.08,"Clear, deep-brown color, controlled 1/2 inch head. Aroma is a little fruity, touch of sharpness approaching skunk. Dense initial mouthfeel, lower carbonation. Sweet and just a touch of raisin and other dried fruit flavors. Actually, more of a plum taste in some ways. Hops are reserved to my tongue. Nice mixture of robustness and lack of greasy slickness. Sturdy without being heavy or overly fruity. Alcohol content was pretty unnoticed by me until close to the end. Cool brew, quality. Thanks to Bighuge for dropping off a sixer.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Belgian Dark Strong Ale,83
10099,1180,Bighuge,4.32,This brew pours pretty dark. Dark Ruby. Has a thin laced tan head that laces nicely. Interesting aroma. Like brown sugar and rock candy. Some malt tones too. Nice. This beer has some definite sweet tones mixed in with alcohol. It's a nice taste. Rock candy comes to mind again. An undenying sweet flavor. Some lingering alcohol and bitterness on the tongue. Body is medium to full. Nice brew here.,Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Belgian Dark Strong Ale,83
10099,1180,Thrasher,3.8,"Something completely different. Poured from the bottle to not much head. Chemical fruit aroma, like cherry cough syrup. You can smell the alcohol. Initially like wine, then chocolatey sweet, fruity but an alarming finish - incredibly bitter. Cleans out the back of the throat as it goes down. I'm getting very medicinal qualities from this. The alcohol is blatant. I like this beer, I admire this beer...

10099,1180,Andy,4.45,"Very different on tap than in the bottle. Here is a bottle review: Pours with a quickly dissipating head. Dark ruby color. Aroma is big alcohol, sweet sugar, and some nutty like cashew with spicy, yeasty hints. Complex flavor, sometimes mellow, with deep peppery hints and some yeast bite. Finish is smoky like true scotch ales.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Belgian Dark Strong Ale,83

(I actually managed to jot some notes down on the two beers.)  Anyway this brew has very nice deep copper / orange-ish color to it. The aroma is that of sweet malt, raisins and slight alcohol, all the same can be tasted on the palate, but the high alcohol is barely even noticed while drinking, it is so tasty and balanced so well. The mouth feel is creamy and smooth. Overall this brew was excellent!

Raison slaps you upside the head with it from the get go. There are some nice, rather sweet flavors going on in the background - fruity maltiness with some Thompson raisin and figgy/grape-y notes, but it's hard for them to say a lot with the alcohol standing up tall and screaming like that.  Different flavor profile in the bottle than on tap, where the alcohol was much more muted. The tap brew is much more drinkable and enjoyable, IMO.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Belgian Dark Strong Ale,83
10099,1180,Murph,4.13,"Pours a beautiful deep red/orange with a thick creamy head that lasts well. Smell is of sweet malt (caramel?), tartness of the raisins and slight alcohol. The first taste is of a slight roasted malt bitterness that is quickly erased by the sweetness of the brew. Not a sticky sugary sweet but a natural one that goes nicely (from the beet sugar?.) There is also some tartness from the raisins. The beer is creamy and smooth across the palate. The surprising lack of alcohol in the taste makes this beer extremely drinkable. I really liked this beer. Very different, this is one of my favorite things about this brewery, there products are always different. Even when they fit into a style they put a nice twist on the style.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Belgian Dark Strong Ale,83

I like this beer very much as a nightcap. It is a change of pace. It is perfect to unwind with but, @ 8%ABV be careful. Well crafted with unique flavor, it is rare to taste these divergent flavors of beet sugars, candy sugar, hops, and malt in an American Brew (or any brew).

Even the label that read: ""Brewed with belgian beet sugar....and green raisins"" couldn't deter me from trying this beer (luckily, neither seemed to greatly influence the taste) Upon sampling this beer, I was initially disappointed. Tasted like and old ale, with the sweetness amped-up. Then as I continued drinking (and as the beer grew on me), I realized the belgian aspect to the beer. Basically, this is how a strong ale would taste if monks were to brew it. Strong yet drinkable. It is an Interesting brew but not mind-blowing (which, judging from other Dogfish brews, I was expecting it to be).. However, it is a beer that as I drink more of it, the more I like it.
