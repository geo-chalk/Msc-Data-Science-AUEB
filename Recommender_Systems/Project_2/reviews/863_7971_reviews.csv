863,7971,dcotom,5,"Quite possibly the perfect beer. Sampled six weeks past the bottling date. Poured from 0.5-liter bottle into a thick-stemmed crystal goblet. Golden colored body, with a thick white long-lasting head that left lots of pretty lacing as it settled. Perfectly balanced, with just enough caramelly malt sweetness to provide structure while allowing the hoppy goodness to shine through. Big flavors of pine, orange, and grapefruit, with a floral note and lots of resiny bitterness. Each sip makes you want another, and it's so drinkable that you might forget that this a relatively big beer. The finish is crisp, with notes of orange zest lingering on the palate. What more could you want?",Russian River Brewing Company,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,100
863,7971,Scrapss,4.24,Poured from the bottle into a Nonic pint.  A: crystal clear light gold color with a nice 2mm head. Head dissipates to a 1mm full disk and very nice lacing grabs the glass with tenacity.  S: lemony fresh and aggressive west coast profile hop with a hint of light malt hiding at the edges. Yeast is inoffensive and minimal.  T: very good west coast hop profile with a solid grapefruit bitterness but not so aggressive that it becomes fatigued. Malt is light and appropriate.  M: body is medium light with a slight dryness and no cloying sweetness. Very nice finish with a hint of ultimate slickness that just works.  O: you should try it for a classic west coast vibe that just hits on all cylinders. Excellent.,Russian River Brewing Company,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,100
863,7971,selimoidar,5,"To me this beer is perfection. The key to success here is the undeniable malty foundation. With such a sturdy base the high floral and bittering notes of the hops really stand out as contrast and the entire sip becomes a journey. Hops for hops' sake is fine in the right vehicle, but this one is about balance. From first sip to last I dare anyone to find a better beer ounce for ounce.",Russian River Brewing Company,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,100

863,7971,JBWHOME,4.58,Finally got to try this beer. Slightly concerned the high IBU would be a bit too bitter for me. I read they have many hop editions throughout the boil. The taste really reflected this technique. A very balanced taste of grapefruit with a slight bitterness throughout the mouth feel. It was served on draft with a slight white head that dissipated fairly quickly. It had a clear golden appearance. I enjoyed this beer.,Russian River Brewing Company,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,100

863,7971,MonDak_Joe1953,4.76,"510ml bottle. Label is stamped with the bottling date of '111822'. Purchased at the taproom store. Nearly clear, light pale gold colored body. Two fingers of puffy white head. Leaves some scattered webs of lacing. Aroma, as described, is intense with pine, citrus (more orange and tangerine than grapefruit), and floral (aromatic). Taste is initially sweet with citrus (again orange and tangerine), then comes the bitterness of the pine. Also has a floral expression. Very full of flavors. Aftertaste is more of an afterglow of the original flavors, with some vegetal hops lingering as long as one may want to wait before taking another sip. Fuller mouth feel. Has a soft texture. Very good carbonation. Very well balanced with the malts and hops. Such a good mix of nose and flavors among the citrus, pine, and floral components. Definitely is a Goldilocks beer, and one that I would prefer more than most NEIPAs. This is because there is more bitterness here, which balances so well with the sweet and floral notes. Also the Santa Rosa taproom is so mellow and energetic at the same time, with that certain Sonoma vibe.",Russian River Brewing Company,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,100
863,7971,Victory_Sabre1973,4.45,"Fairly clear golden pour with a 1 finger white head. Decent retention and some lacing on the glass. The aroma has a pleasing hop aroma with pine and some citrus. Flavor is hops, of course. There's a mellow pine and citrus up front. This flavor builds toward the back. There's a grassy earthy flavor that comes into the mix. The body is quite full and decent. Somewhat sticky as well. Solid world class IPA.",Russian River Brewing Company,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,100
863,7971,cyclonece09,5,"Poured from a bottle into a tulip. Pours yellow orange with a nice fluffy white head. Smells of citrus hops with just a hint of tropical fruit.

The head recedes to an uneven ring, rocky cap and smattering of lacing. The aroma is moderate in strength featuring candied citrus, caramel malt and pine. The taste is bittersweet caramel malt with strong bitterness and notes of orange, pine, and tropical fruit. The mouthfeel is medium bodied with average carbonation and a mostly dry finish.

863,7971,kotocar,4.44,"Yes it's good. It's an exceptionally well done northwest IPA. I am super surprised that it is 8% alcohol. It taste like it is 6% alcohol. That is the biggest shock factor for me. I personally prefer a bit more caramel malt in my IPA's which is why I am not giving it a perfect score. There is no strange flavors like dank, mango, or any other gimmicks in this beer. If I had to describe it I would say it taste of suprinsgly I am tasting battery acid, grapefruit, and something bitter.  It's definitely chuggable.... but sorta expensive so best to enjoy it.

863,7971,Hobbs87,4.43,Finally had this in Napa after reading about it for sometime. Wasn’t overly thrilled maybe it was due to the build up to have it. Then had it a second time when it was delivered for a virtual beer tasting. Much better.

It is very fruity with some light berry notes.  Feel: It is smooth and incredibly hoppy and bitter without any sharp bitter notes.

863,7971,LucidoMMA,4.14,"Pours a beautiful golden color with a thin sticky head with medium bubbles. Hard for me to get a sense of an aroma from this brew.  Tastes of bitter grapefruit, hops and orange zest.  Leaves sticky, layered lacing. Very hoppy going into the finish.

863,7971,JesseJames81,4.56,"Appearance: Pours a clear, golden color, medium carbonation. A silky, frothy foam head. Leaves behind sticky lacing.  Aroma: A sweet, pungent hoppy aroma. Fragrant floral, citric, piney, and some herbal notes present.   Taste: A good, complex flavor profile. Starts off with a balanced blend of citrus rind, pine resin and grapefruit, and then evolves into a notable lingering tangy bitterness in the middle with some tropical fruits. All the while, subtle malts in the background compliment the whole thing, keeping it in composition. The bitterness rides all the way through the somewhat boozy finish.

863,7971,Radome,4.43,"Tasted on tap at Native Son Ale house in Rancho Cucamonga, CA.  L - Served in a clear plastic Solo cup due to the bar’s location inside a giant food court with outdoor patios. Light golden color with a touch of chill haze. Pure white head started out fluffy and a finger thick, but quickly faded to little more than a ring around the glass. Head may have been impeded by the plastic cup.  S - Again the cup may have lessened the impact of the nose, as it was hard for me to get much. Nice DIPA aromas of citrus and pine with some sweet, bready malt at a lower level. Not overly distinctive nose, but hits the right notes for the style.  T - Explosion of West Coast hops, with orange and grapefruit citrus notes, along with pine resin. Maybe a hint of pineapple. A light touch of bready malt that quickly fades in the surprisingly dry finish. The beer lacks enough malt to begin to balance against the hops, as I normally expect in the style.  F - Medium body and medium to high carbonation. Monstrous hops bitterness level that burns the citrus into your tongue. Alcohol heat is hard to pick out behind the hops burn. Very dry finish that leaves the hops aftertaste to linger.  O - I was very glad to finally try this beer after years of hype but not having any opportunities in Florida or in my travels. Is it a great beer? Certainly. Is it a world’s best, or an aging example? I won’t get into that debate. I can only say that, for my palate and preferences, this lacks in malt character to stand out as an Imperial IPA. To me it is more properly called an assertive West Coast IPA, and a great one, and I’ll leave it at that.",Russian River Brewing Company,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,100
863,7971,koberlin1,5,"Wow, have seen some sub 4 reviews of Pliny....wawhat??!! This is by far one of the best beers out there. Regardless of your hoppy beer type preference being pale ale, IPA, or stout, this DIPA will knock your socks off both with its wonderful taste as well as its effect. Pop this beer open fresh (I have only had it bottled...not on tap or canned) outta a cold fridge and get your nose on it for some wonderfully floral and hoppy aromas. At 8% this DIPA is strong and one 17.5oz bottle will set most right requiring a brief 20 min interlude before standing up quickly/getting behind the wheel to hop to the next tasting room/bar. If I could keep a constant stock of Pliny the Elder available in my fridge I would, but alas it is a rare find down here in San Diego. Should have bought a case while I had the chance while at the high-end uber boujee Seaside Market in Cardiff-by-the-Sea. Maybe they have some left....hmmmm...I'll be back!",Russian River Brewing Company,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,100
863,7971,firesidewithphil,4.5,"Pliny is synonymous with California beer. Whether it be the Elder or the Younger, the name is a brand within itself.

Smell was all hops. A lot of tropical and citrus fruit is in the aroma. Taste enters sweet with a healthy dose of grapefruit, orange, mango. Middle has a bit of pithy bitterness and more tropical flavors but its balanced by a nice malt backbone. Finish is balanced with a slight hint of alcohol. Feel is medium bodied, lower carbonation but enough to provide a solid base for the flavor. Overall, well worth the wait for this classic expression. The flavors were bold, bright, and expressive. The beer was well balanced even with the bold hop presence. I enjoyed this a lot.",Russian River Brewing Company,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,100
863,7971,thebigbambino,3.19,"Long time coming. I have been wanting to get my hands on this beer for a few years. If you know me, I love imperial stout, barleywine and double ipa. If it's not full bodied then probably not gonna rate very high on my list. This brew poured a very light tan with a thin head. Nose was very happy and floral. Mouthful was very light with little malt backbone. I was dissatisfied with the taste of a beer that is rated 100. Maybe 15 years ago but with the evolution of craft beer I find it hard to fathom this beer in the top 50 all time. I would rate it 3 out of 5. Just like Hopslam this beer is overhyped and in my opinion not worth all the accolades. Of I were to taste it on draft the outcome could be different, but like I said I prefer full bodied brews and lean towards other styles. So take it for what it's worth.  Cheers.

863,7971,Mdog,4.55,"Appearance: Very slightly hazy gold, nice carbonation, good head.  Smell: Strong grapefruit, slight rind.  Taste: Moderately sweet to start, then a balancing shot of grapefruit bitterness. Stays balanced between sweet and bitter before the bitterness wins out in the finish.  Overall: Bottled 7/18, tasted 8/13. Bought in Colorado and brought back, a long-time want finally obtained after 26 hours of driving round trip (I did do other stuff on this trip, not just beer shopping). Just a classic flavor, nice balance but plenty of hoppy bitterness. Definitely worth the trip.",Russian River Brewing Company,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,100
863,7971,Itsreck1,4.4,"Appearance: Clarity is clear, silky head, laces the glass throughout the session and has a long lasting head retention. Perfect pale/bronze color.  Aroma: Hop forward aroma as expected, but not deep or complex with a light malty sweetness in the background.  Mouthfeel: The body is a thin to medium body, solid carbonation that sings on the tongue, small alcohol warmth.  Flavor: Complex hop characteristics, gives small citrus flavor off from hops with some black currant like flavors and a solid touch of pine and a touch of floral/perfumy like flavors, from the bittering to flavoring hop additions. Small sweetness from the malt flavor to act as the backbone. Long lasting hop bitterness sticks with you after each drink that is still pleasant to enjoy.  This is a solid and most importantly classic/quintessential West Coast style IPA and shows exactly the path from the old school IPA 2000s vibes with the heavy magnum bittering. This beer shows the depth of hops from each stage of the beer making process to give deep complexity to the hop flavor.",Russian River Brewing Company,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,100

863,7971,JZH1000,4.35,"Poured from a 17.25 FL Oz bottle, bottled on 6-14-2022 so a month and 16 days old. Poured into spiegelau IPA glass.  On the pour a white nearly three finger head forms after a minute or two it slightly recedes making more room to pour, and I am able to get the head over the rim over the glass. Head becomes quite rocky but has very good retention. Carbonation after the pour looks quite ligjt and lazy. Body is a slightly dark gold. On the paler side of a lot of IPAs and with a very slight chill haze. Laces very nicely.  Aroma is quite bright with a hit of resinous grapefruit sweet hops. Some malt sweetness comes through, but the hops are very big on this one. A very sweet floral and citric smelling beer. Nothing off and very clean. More juicy than I expected.  Taste is similar to the aroma but a lot of the fruity qualities are traded for a big wave of bitterness that slowly fades leaving a resinous zesty but sweet and malty finish that lingers but is very nicely balanced after the big wave of hops. Despite the abv I can't really detect alcohol as the hops actually cover it up. Despite being super hoppy this isn't a mess and is very drinkable with a nice hop evolution that gives a good balance of bite to flavor.  Feel is soft and dangerously drinkable with a perfectly balanced carbonation bite to softness provided by the head. Honestly this is tasty af and I'm not an ipa guy nobody does everything right and maintains the balance. This feels like a benchmark and I could drink this all summer long if it wasn't 8% and so damn expensive.  Overall this beer is very hyped up. Don't get me wrong it's very good. There's essentially nothing wrong with it, the bitterness isn't cloying, but is pleasantly present, and it's big and hoppy without forgetting its a malt drink. It even looks beautiful. It's the perfect IPA, but everyone is trying to imitate it so unless this is you're whale you probably have a general idea of how this tastes, you've just had a similar but inferior beer. Is it worth the price? Maybe maybe not though. $7.99 for the bottle at a store in Colorado. Maybe I got scammed.",Russian River Brewing Company,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,100

The aroma doesn't explode from the glass, but it's nice. Earthy and piney, with pithy grapefruit. Think forest floor, littered with grapefruit peels. Potting soil, pine needles, pine cone, grapefruit peel, a touch of grass, and orange peel. Juicy yellow grapefruit, and bright fresh white pine hit in equal measure. Grapefruit and orange peels and juice take over and dominate, but earthy pine needles remain in the background. The malt is subtle, biscuity, slightly toasty, offering a slight sweetness but remaining subtle. It finishes clean and crisp, moderately bitter. Hop oils, grapefruit and pine linger on your tongue and make the palate sticky. Nice medium-plus body, good carbonation, moves quickly and smoothly on the palate but leaves a lasting impression.  This is every bit a world-class WCDIPA. Tastes phenomenal.",Russian River Brewing Company,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,100

Would you dare poop poo on a Tree House New England style IPA for being stuck in the past? For some reason only pioneer West Coast IPA's get this treatment for their style, never the pioneers of hazy IPA's of the Northeast. This beer is extremely well crafted and balanced, while punching a piney flavor burst to your jaw. Everything about this screams well balanced while adhering to the West Coat style. And whaddya know, this beer invented the damn West Coat Imperial Ipa Style!  I will say, their only competition would be Alvarado atm, along with Cellarmaker.  There's a couple up and comers. Another OG would be Boneyard brewing who took a malt heavy approach for their beers and somehow, they kept their integrity after the buyout and do have the price advantage over Russian River.

Nice fresh aroma with a nice mix of scents with fruit and freshness and herbs and sweetness. More golden than many with a slight haze. Nice dense white head that settles some with some lacing. Boy, those are some nice flavors. The bitterness level being high is certainly old school and a little more than I want, but it's not ripping my tongue off either. Hops are so fresh on this and almost clean. Flavors are a little more herbal and grassy than the aroma but still some nice fruit qualities as well. Body is only a little bigger than moderate but there is nice smoothness and richness that makes the feels soft and full. Not really sticky though. This is good.

I laid a few of them on their side in the bottom of the refrigerator for a couple of hours and I've just poured one into a large british pint glass. I'm halfway through this drink now and everything about this beer is absolutely excellent. I live near the beach in Los Angeles and I've been drinking beer for 50 years. I'm married to a Geordie expatriate from the northeast of England. I've had the opportunity to try thousands of great beers. This beer is absolutely remarkable. From the delicate astringency of the first sip to the final mustache wetting last gulp. My hat is off to the people brewing at Russian River.,Russian River Brewing Company,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,100
863,7971,Sparty1224,4.5,"Serving: 1 Pint 1.25 Fl. oz. bottle poured into a Tree House teku glass. Bottled on 3/29/22, making this 29 days old (or fresh).  A: Pours a pretty clear, golden yellow color. Bright white, foamy head.  S: A good balance of fruity notes and piney notes. Some pineapple and mango accented by a sweet piney resin. Doesn't really pop a ton though.  T: Nice pineapple, mango, some tangerine. Less piney on the flavor. Pretty bitter and dry finish. Again, doesn't really explode with flavor here.  M: Nice a full, very drinkable. Not a bruiser by any means.  O: I've only had this one other time, on draft about 8 years ago. First time out of the bottle here, and it's pretty fresh. Much like Blind Pig, which I had yesterday, there is really nothing that stands out on first sip to make you think this is a Top 30 beer. You have to think back in the early days when craft beer was just getting going, that, yes, this could be the poster child for the West Coast-style IPA and one of the best beers at the time. And then as the years go on, I think the hype just perpetuates and when people review it, they feel guilted into giving it a 5/5. I've definitely had similar beers, albeit ones indebted to Pliny, but still similar. Arctic Panzer, Perm Funeral, any of the latest IPAs from Short's. This is still a good beer, don't get me wrong. It's just not this amazing world-beater that's going to shock you anymore. And that's fine. It's a legend, it's the OG, and craft beer really wouldn't be where it's at without it.  Recommendation: Despite losing some of its luster, this is still a must-try for any beer lover.",Russian River Brewing Company,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,100
863,7971,Viaduck,4.24,"I finally get my chance to sample this legendary IPA. It was given to me by my sister’s friend, a nice lady in her 90’s who is friends with the owners of Russian River. The body is a hazy orange/amber with an off-white head that was smaller than expected. A fairly strong aroma of citrus, pine & hops greets the nose. Its taste is not as bitter as implied by the hoppy aroma & this is a hint of sweet, salty & tartness added as well. Flavors are as expected: tangerine, grapefruit, pine, hops & bread. Medium body with excellent carbonation, no sign of the 8%. Very thirst quenching. I would agree with those that say more recent IPA’s have surpassed this classic. It’s still great. Mr P. Elder has been on my list of must have beers for a long time & im glad to have finally enjoyed it.",Russian River Brewing Company,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,100
863,7971,Newbeergeek1,4.55,"On a cruise to San Francisco and found Gott’s and a Whole Food, one for draft and the other for few bottles. Drafts (I wasn’t driving so I had two) were wonderful and lived up to the hype and then some. I can only hope that the bottles will be close to as good as the drafts. Smooth, left a little lingering bitter taste in a good way, ABV didn’t overwhelm the taste. Being from the east coast I found the hazy vs clear IPA’s kind of a fun discussion with myself. My last beer if I am on death row would be Heady Topper so I am comparing Pliny to Heady and trying to be objective. I must say liked Heady better, but not by a lot! I have been hearing about Pliny for years now and it’s everything I hoped it would be. Absolutely glad I had it.",Russian River Brewing Company,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,100

863,7971,StephenLovett,4.46,"Pours a clear light gold with a 1/2"" head of a mix of white small and larger bubbles.  The nose is deceiving as it's dominated by a bold dry hopped ""Cascade"" scent that is almost overpowering leading a first timer to expect a typically over-hopped, nothing-but-hops IPA. Happily that's not the case.  The magic here is the balance, something that so many IPA's get wrong. All the more remarkable for it being a double. Most stronger beers strike a balance with the strong hop aroma and flavor that results from aggressive dry hopping by starting with a high original gravity. This results is a sweet/tart balance that leans in the direction of a California style barley wine and is easy to get wrong.  Consummate skill in the brewing arts yield something that I've never experienced before which is a very pleasing hop forward flavor profile with its resultant citrus / pine flavors, but still retaining the malt flavors, with no sweetness. This beer is just perfectly balanced. It really is a work of art.  Medium body, carbonation strong enough to meet the stronger flavors, but not overwhelm them. Did I mention balance?  It's a bit much for a daily drinker for me, but there is no denying that it's a really exceptional beer, and an IPA I really enjoy which is a rarity. More remarkably its big brother Pliny the younger strikes an equally skillful balance in a triple.

I don't know what more to say, so let's just get into it  Pours a clear yellow gold with 3 fingers of creamy off white head that slowly fades to a cap and leaves nice lacing. An endless stream of carbonation from the bottom of the glass  Oh man, the nose on this one isn't super complex, but it's right in your face. I'm picking up on aromas of resinous hops, caramel malt, fresh pine, orange zest, wildflower honey, and light white pepper  This is very expressive, but very balanced. There's nothing angular about this one; the beauty is in the balance. On the front end of the sip I'm tasting orange zest, floral hops, crackery malt, white pepper, pineapple, light honey, and tangerine. The swallow brings notes of caramel malt, peppery hops, pithy grapefruit, honey, tangerine zest, and toasted grain  A medium body pairs with gentle carbonation, resulting in a sharp and dry beer. Finishes totally dry and balanced  Oh man, this absolutely lived up to the hype for me!

Feel: Crisp and clean. Perfect carbonation. Very crushable.  Overall: Quintessential and style-defining.

The hop bitterness lingers with the pine forest dank scrubbing of the tongue tastes which I dont find in a lot of IPA's these days. The bitterness becomes astringent and quite powerful which a lot of IPA's have claimed but havent lived up to it. This comes closest to smelling and tasting a fresh hop you can get in a beer.

Lots of conifer and citrus hit hard and fast upon first sip and mingle and develop nicely as malt sweetness holds down the base. Tongue and tooth-tingling menthol-like notes are present throughout as well and closes with a nice bite Mouthfeel: Full, very clean, medium-high carbonation, and definite dryness on the finish Overall: This is tasty stuff. Not surprised in the least as to how good this is but it’s been over a decade since I had it last so was curious how I’d perceive it now with a much more developed palate. A classic WCDIPA hop profile – conifer and citrus but with a present, but restrained malt profile that lets the hops truly shine.

Being a Boston guy, I am a bit biased to the NEIPA as the dominant IPA style, but this truly is the grandfather of the genre. Elder you might say. Anyways to the beer. It pours into a glowing gold with a frothy thick head that caught me off guard and escaped my glass. A casualty, but nonetheless we march on. Carbonation bubbles dance to the top of the head from the bottom of the glass. To the nose, piney/floral aromas tickle your nostrils. A sip and immediately you are met by a light bitterness, but a very fresh hoppy and pine like taste. A slight citrus aftertaste and each time you put it down, you are lured quickly to the next sip. Slowly you are warmed by the alcohol and once gone, you are left satisfied and disappointed you are out of beer.

The nose is mostly pine and then some grapefruit. A little bit of cat pee. Mouthfeel is prickly and lighter bodied than given the ABV, so I suspect white sugar is added here to thin this out. Flavor again is pine and grapefruit. Not overly complex with a firm bitterness and a dry finish.  15 years ago, when there wasn't an absolute deluge of IPAS/ DIPAs on the market, I could see why this gained some notoriety. In todays market, it pales to the abundance of choices. Growing up in Michigan where two hearted is the norm, the same thing has happened here.

The taste is just about West Coast IPA perfect. That means there's a solid, but not sweet, malt body cleanly carrying a poignant resinous, yet dry bitter hop taste. Nothing out of whack, delightful across the tongue, rare is the beer better than this. A necessary advisory, this is from Philadelphia, three thousand miles away.

863,7971,Todd,4.87,"510ml bottled on 02/02/2021. ""Not packaged from resale."" Sample from the brewery. Thanks, Vinnie!  I've consumed Pliny the Elder hundreds of times over the years, and most of those were on draught at The Falling Rock when I lived in Denver, but I've never sat down with a bottle for a proper review on my own.  Pours a lively, light, pale, honey colored beer with a hint of haze and a thick, creamy head that laces down the glass with each sip. Big piney note in the nose with citrus and a soft floral aroma. Mouthfeel is sublime. Crisp and prickly on the palate, and then creamy, firm, a bit chewy, and incredibly smooth. Malty sweet with a light clean breadiness. Hoppy and fruity with pineapple, orange, ripe, juicy, fleshy, tropical fruits, and grapefruit rind. This is broken up by a dry bitterness with pine, resin, and an oily and ashy presence that sticks to the palate for what seems like forever. And I want it to last forever. Biscuit. Honey. Warming alcohol. Bone-dry finish. Spicy linger.  Despite the market being absolutely flooded with India Pale Ales, and good number of them being what I'd consider world-class, in 2021 Pliny the Elder still stands after all these years as the gold standard for both West Coast and Double IPAs.

Originally I thought it was imbalanced dry, but today that changed by a lot for good!!! *Aroma: Beautiful, floral, mild tropical, pleasant! *Looks: Beautiful light-amber with superb head that sticks nicely. *Taste: Superb, well-balanced, light, but nice hoppy bite. *Finish: Very Dry, but light & refreshing. Not too malty by any means, the dry hoppiness is over-powering but with a fresh bottle you don’t mind it! *Overall Verdict*: I can see why people like this beer.

It's big brother the younger is something I would truly like to try but it is nearly impossible to find short of standing in line on release day at the brewery.  It pours very light and clear with good carbonation. The head is decent out of the bottle but better on tap as nearly every beer is at the right temperature. Mouth feel is a bit on the light side for a DIPA and the taste is quality IPA with good hop smell with some florals and and easy finish.

All of the fruit/hop notes above. Building, pleasant bitterness, but very balanced with the bread malt. FEEL: Lots of tight carbonation throughout each sip.

Smell - tropical fruits: mango, pineapple, with a nice bit of honey-like sweetness. some malts detectable. very pleasant without feeling too sweet. Taste - whoa. a full blast of hoppy bitterness, with flavors that were not in the smell at all. In fact, the hop flavor is pine forward, with some balance from malts, and has a mildly sweet finish typical of some of the all time great IPAs. Feel - medium bodied, average carbonation, and a heavy hitter at 8% ABV in a 500+ ml bottle, with the alcohol barely detectable. Overall - there is a reason that this beer is an all time great. the inviting aroma, balanced flavor profile, and drinkability makes this not only a quintessential West Coast style IPA, but also a textbook imperial IPA where everything is done perfectly. a really special brew that I am fortunate to get my hands on.",Russian River Brewing Company,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,100

863,7971,just1cho,4.74,"*Poured into a Teku glass from a 500mL bottle*  This beer poured a clear yellow with a nice two finger thick white colored head. The head had some nice bubbles to it making it look nice and pillowy. It also had some great retention to it, making this beer look very nice but also made for a nice drinking experience.  The aroma on this was very sweet, syrupy, tropical, and fruity. Really amazing to smell. Had notes of sweet mandarin oranges, pineapple, mangoes, pine, and a fruity syrupiness reminding me of canned dole fruit cups. Again, very nice, fruity, and floral without having to be dry hopped to insanity.  I thought the taste of this was fairly balanced when comparing this to other Imperial IPAs that I've had. I got more of a bitter grapefruit character on this throughout while the notes of mainly mangoes, oranges, and the aforementioned fruits were more pronounced but light in taste in the front. The notes of tropical fruits faded towards the middle where I only got notes of bittersweet grapefruit which then subsided a bit to notes of biscuits and light caramel in the finish and aftertaste.  I have to say that this beer was super dry, smooth, and incredibly easy to drink. I must've finished the whole bottle within thirty minutes to a hour, because I could NOT stop drinking this. I thought that this was super crush-able and quaff-able thanks to its medium body, high carbonation, and dry mouthfeel.  I think this is in my opinion, the perfect imperial IPA. I've never had such a well rounded, aromatic, floral, and fruity tasting IPA before without it being a sludgy mess from insane dry hopping. The drinkability on this was insane, and since this clocks in at 8%, that's pretty dangerous. Thankfully, since I live in California, I'm super glad that I can get this fairly easily.",Russian River Brewing Company,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,100

Smell- Citrus (orange, grapefruit and lemon zest), tropical fruit (pineapple and mango), sweet malt, whiffs of pine and floral/grassy hop notes.  Taste- Similar to the aroma. citrus and tropical fruit, pine, sweet malts with a mildly hoppy bitter finish. Very well balanced.  Feel- Medium bodied, slightly sweet yet dry and really crisp, super refreshing. Medium carbonation on the tongue.

Get it fresh and it's a 4.5/5 if it's not fresh after a month it's a 4 at best, which is why I feel 4.25 is a fair and acceptable rating. I think it's over hyped and overrated.

Citrus, orange fighting to take over. There is a bit of caramel malt in the background to reign things in. Finishes super clean.  O: Wow. Truly one of the best beers in the world.

863,7971,fun2moto,4.48,"Ok,,, I know all the hype about this beer. I do not like IPA's nor do I like the bitter taste that comes with them. My local gastropub... havent been in a while do to COVID..... but last time i was there they had the ELDER on tap. My server knows my likes and my dislikes. He sneaked this one on me as a sample taste and I was kind of intrigued. I hate these kinds of beers but for some reason it just clicked with me. I had a 16oz pour and was actually liking it. Every sip I found something new. I am a Barlywine / Malty beer guy... the stronger it is the better.  After my mug, I decided to pursue the quest and try it again. Our local market carries this beer but on a only two per visit policy. Well with COVID going on I have a mask and sweatshirt and BB cap as I enter the store.. I purchase two and take off my sweatshirt and cap and look completely different and buy another two. LOL...  I have just finished my 4 beers 16oz bottles during the last two days. I have determined that it is a good thing to supplement my malty beers for the polar oposite and go for a piney IPA . I am now a convert... I have tried a few other IPAs such as Green Flash and a Stone AB ale.  I will stick with Pliney any variety. I have yet tied the younger , But I have tried Blind Pig and found it kinda of a watered down version of the Elder..  I now see what the hype is about and am now venturing out into the IPA evil world.  So any of you guys like me who love Malty triple's , doubles or Barley;s minus the hopps I think you may find a new world.  Cheers BA world and have enjoyed writing my first review...  As for the rating portion.  Look - Looks like a nice medium stray color, with a light head. Smell - Smells like I am out in the mountains among pine trees Taste - Wow this is actually good for an IPA hater Feel - Nice carbonation and the light oily pine coats the tounge perfectly as to really taste those hops Overall - I am a convert!!!!",Russian River Brewing Company,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,100

Aromas opens with subtle clementine, pine needles, and a quietly acidic grapefruit edging into a slight lemon zest in the middle of a seamlessly integrated malt character; soft tropical undertones shine forth with a lasting flow of overripe mango, peach skins, strawberry, and guava touches.  Taste presents tangerine prominently upfront with a sweeter pineapple building into a very quiet notion of evergreen needles and earth along the mid-palate; underripe grapefruit peel and hints of oregano precede and dark blueberry must and a flaky malt backing before a lingering tropical cream lingers beyond the swallow.  Mouthfeel offers an oily medium body with a medium carbonation perfectly entrenched in the background belying a near-unrivaled consistency across the mid-palate; flaky malt dryness eases to a deft coating of lupulin-laden hop oil contributing a mild though stiff bittering into a fluffy, truly effortless finish/swallow and a warming glow of innocuous alcohol presence.  A stunner of a DIPA refined to the highest level, running the spectrum of hop and malt harmony to an end product pure and comprehensive; simply the apex of the style, a dreamy culmination.",Russian River Brewing Company,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,100

Off the head the aroma is intensely hoppy - pine up front, as warms increasing notes of citrus, some ripe pineapple, and a creeping touch of dankness. The taste is deliciously malty with early sweetness - orange, orange peel, pineapple, and pine - the hops balance the sweetness with a wonderful but never over the top bitterness. Medium full mouthfeel - exceptionally smooth with a silky sensation on the palate and a mild lingering piney bitterness. The alcohol is present in a warming manner but in no way boozy.

For me, it was like watching ""The Irishman"" after hearing all the buzz about it being up there with ""Raging Bull"" and ""Goodfellas"" among the Scorsese classics.  And, just as was my experience less than halfway into ""The Irishman,"" my thoughts about this beer a few sips into my pint were ""um, is that it?""  I expected much more from such a madly-hyped beer.  My initial sip had me a bit puzzled. Why were there so many different types of hops competing to be recognized? Why is the color of the beer more like that of a Belgian tripel than an IPA? Is it trying to be all things to all people? While not unpleasant, by any stretch (mouthfeel was a balance of fizzy and creamy, with a little bit of metallic zing, finish left a bit of welcome sweetness), it still paled in comparison to far superior American and Belgian IPAs (like Troubadour Magma or Lawson's Sip of Sunshine, or even Sierra Nevada Torpedo), which for me all have better integrated malt and hops flavors. After a few more sips, the wheels totally came off the bus for me on this one. The competing hop flavors and aromas tended to all go to neutral corners, so rather than getting an integrated, complimentary overall flavor profile all I got were separate, discordant notes. Which left in the middle something that tasted like a pretty good pilsner.

I must admit the devil is always on my shoulder telling me to try and buy more than two with an inexperienced cashier, or to stash them behind other beers and come back, but I resist. I think it's important to follow stores rules so that more people get the chance to experience what a God tier IPA tastes like.  As for the beer itself, it's really a quite simple description that people like to complicate. It's a very, very smooth IPA. It is an 8% IPA that still has bite but finishes sweet.

The smell was a fresh & hoppy one with floral notes & a pleasant bitterness, some grapefruit at the end too but nothing overly pronounced. Citrus & grapefruit kick off the taste with a freshness, faint pine & subtle tropical fruits, most notably pineapple; the bitterness is slightly stronger here too. The body is strongly carbonated & medium with a clean feel & the alcohol content is hidden well too.

863,7971,hophead723,4.82,"superspak, I'm sorry you have never gotten to try this fresh because you would really like it. Here in Beverly Hills I can find it easily. Poured into a pint glass brewed only a week ago, it was damn fresh.  Look: Gorgeous light gold color, sporting a rich and fluffy head of pure white foam. It sticks to the glass and decorates it with clean bands of lace, and as soft as a cloud as you dip your nose into it for each glorious gulp. Steady carbonation streams from the base of the glass in organized pillars of tiny bubbles rising to fuel the aromatic head.  Smell: The aroma is bursting with pineapple, mango, grapefruit, guava, lychee, evergreen pine, mandarin peel, floral wisteria blossoms, and orange blossom honey. A kiss of honeysuckle and caramel biscuit round out the incredible and enticing aroma.  Taste/Feel: The hoppy, blissful bitterness carries with it lush notes juicy pineapple, guava, mango, lychee, pink graprfruit, and pine. Blasts of tropical fruits and aspirin bitterness sing in harmony with a masterfully executed malt profile. The perfect balance of hops and malt has been achieved! The extremely drinkable and smooth body glides across the palate. Slick and clean, smooth and satisfying. A barrage of deliciousness that is well orchestrated and evolves as the beer warms. For example, one gulp would yield peppery pineapple bitterness lingering at the back of the palate, while another gulp tasted identical to sweet mandarin orange for over a minute at the front of the palate. Superb.  Overall: Most brewers hope and dream of this immaculate execution. I wish it were more available.",Russian River Brewing Company,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,100

863,7971,Highaltituderun,4.68,From the tap poured into an Odell Tulip glass. It doesn't get much better than this. Pours an off hazy yellow-gold. The head at first was mesmerizing. Tiny tiny bubbles that hung around for a few moment then dissipated to a thin white ring around the glass. Aromas of mangoes and oranges. Crisp and delightful on my first drink. Powerful mouthfeel. Gave a sip to my girlfriend whose not a huge beer fan and doesn't like hops much. She enjoyed the sip... and I love hops. At 8 % alcohol you get a slight tongue bite but it is extremely palatable and drinkabke for the percentage. A wonderful double IPA and when I saw it on tap I almost freaked out because I didn't think it was real. A must try.  After about 20 or 30 minutes the beer has warmed up and has a very small patch of white bubbles remaining.

Very clean smell. T: Citrus on the front, pine on the back and nice long but mild bitter finish. Nothing too powerful and nothing really wants to take center stage. Very clean flavors in a very nice balance. F: Lighter and softer than I would expect. Not at all syrupy which is a problem with many IPAs. Good carbonation.  I'm pleasantly surprised. I used to drink Pliny regularly over 6 years ago when they distributed to WA and loved it, but the last time I had it a couple years ago it wasn't as good as I had remembered.

Light, nearly clear amber (hint of orange/caramel) color. Thick, rocky white head. Caramelized (medium toast) malt, floral (citrus peel and pine) and slight mandarin orange peel notes in the aroma. No trace of the 8% alcohol by volume to introduce the taste. Moderate floral hop bite floating on top of a non-sweet caramelized (medium toast)malt foundation.

Wow...one of the best beers I have ever had. I could describe the look, nose, flavors and mouthfeel to you, but others have described this beer more than adequately before me. And truthfully, nothing does this beer justice short of drinking one. If you have the opportunity, absolutely drink one (or I suspect 2+) of these.

863,7971,Sheppard,4.25,"Pours golden with chill haze. Floral nose. There's strawberry and grapefruit. It has remarkably clean flavors and none of the oniony character. The bitterness is clean.

Beautiful golden color, decent head and lacing. The smell is, I can't find the right words: pure? Golden? Wonderful? It's the taste that sets it apart, though. Perfect blend of hops and maltiness. Citrusy and floral, and just the right amount of bitterness. My top-rated brew for a reason.",Russian River Brewing Company,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,100

If the scale went this high, I would rate it a 10!",Russian River Brewing Company,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,100
863,7971,Stooven,4.15,"Being from Chicago, this beer was just a rumor. The times I have been to California, the story was always that RR shrank its distro area, didn't go here, didn't go there . . . so naturally I find two bottles for sale in the Colorado mountains having randomly stopped in a gas station/liq store for a Coke. I actually gasped when I saw it, like finding a soundboard Nirvana bootleg from the concert you attended.  It's a solid ale. Didn't look for the dating, but knowing ales it certainly tasted fresh. Ten years ago, I might have spread the Good News. But for the price, I'll look elsewhere next time. And I have several $20/4-packs that I return to despite bargaining with myself not to. Reminds me of Sculpin, in the above-average beer, way overpriced category. Not being contrarian; not saying ""I don't get it."" Just too much time has passed and too many brewers have caught up. Back in Chicago, cases of Zombie Dust are bypassed at Whole Foods and Binnys. (In a Budweiser world, kind of makes you appreciate Dom and Blue Label's perseverance. By the time I finally had Pappy, I was really impressed.) Pliny is a 70s film like The Conversation or Network, an album like Exile on Main Street or '77 that is obviously a benchmark, but doesn't stir the soul the way it maybe once would have. I'd go to the brewery and have it on draft for sure.",Russian River Brewing Company,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,100
863,7971,mappyLS,4.86,"I was on a road trip last month and happened to befriend some cool peeps in San Fransisco. They told me about this brewery and how they make the 'best IPA in North America.' Intrigued by their comments, I made a pit stop in Santa Rosa and went to a few breweries in the area before trying Russian River. I'm not a fan of restaurant/breweries, but I must admit, it was a fun atmosphere. When I ordered this beer I thought to myself, ""this is the best IPA NA has to offer? LOL!"" Then I brought that golden glass of goodness to my nasal passages and was pleased with the scent. The only thing left to do was let my palate have a little action, perhaps too much by the end of my evening. I was pleasantly surprised by how smooth this IPA was. I do wish there was more of a carbonation texture, but this is nitpicking. Incredibly balanced IPA and I have been searching for it ever since finishing my road trip. I also heard they make a small batch called Pliny the Younger and apparently puts this to shame...",Russian River Brewing Company,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,100

863,7971,FBarber,4.5,"Pours a clear crisp golden hue. Thin sudsy white head dissipates pretty quickly. Some light lacing is left behind.  Aroma is a lovely pungent array of bright fresh pine, orangey citrus, with some floral notes - orange blossom, honeysuckle, and a hint of bright fresh cut lemon grass. While the hops are quite aromatic, there is a balance to this as there is a definite light malt backbone coming through even on the nose.  Taste is follows the nose with notes of citrus - lemon, orange, tangerine and orange rind - along with fresh pine and a bright floral notes. Solid cracker-y malt backbone comes through. Incredibly balanced and restrained while still being flavorful and complex. Mild bitterness on the back end with some more piney notes coming through. The classic west coast profile comes through here but without trying to punch you in the palate.  Feel is light, crisp, and pretty smooth. Does have a slight slick oiliness to it. Moderate carbonation with gentle finish.  Overall, this is a lovely IPA with a well earned reputation. What was perhaps most surprising to me was its incredible balance and deftness. In a market saturated with IPAs that try to one up each other, this beer knows what it is and does it so well. Admittedly I've wanted to this one for some time and it did not disappoint - I hope this is not the last time I have this beer.",Russian River Brewing Company,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,100
863,7971,Nuttin_but_the_best_Clark,4.6,"Imagine my surprise to see this on draft when walking into a bar in Philly. Apparently, the only bar to serve this on draft (in a very limited supply) is the one I was in. I had three glasses. This was one of the original craft beer unicorns ... and for good reason. It's great!  I will say that beers have since started to catch up and I don't consider this to be an enlightening experience ... several good IPAs I've had are as good or better. Having said that, this IS an IPA to write home about and it's as perfect a double IPA as you'll find.  5-7 years ago I'd be doing cartwheels and rating this a 5 across the board. Today, it's a very good IPA ... one of the best. Still hard to find, even in CA! I think the hype surrounding this and it's February release with lines around the block, ticket lotteries and strict one beer per person limits brought this notoriety and high ratings.  It is very resin/pine forward with a crisp citrus base. If you had me test this and Lawson's Finest Sip of Sunshine, I'd have a tough time distinguishing. Maybe my preference would be for Pliny because it has a bit less bitterness and harshness as the Sip of Sunshine does. Pliny delivers on smoothness and taste without going over the top.  You must like IPA in order to drink this. To a non-IPA drinker, Pinesol would come to mind when tasting this. However for those of us who love IPA, though the hype may not live up to the actuality, this is as fine an IPA as you'll experience.  Though I had it on draft, I've seen it bottled and the packaging looks like genetic dollar store steak sauce. Completely cheesy and not at all indicative of the skill that went into the beer inside the bottle.",Russian River Brewing Company,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,100
863,7971,SierraNevallagash,4.61,"A massive thanks and appreciation to Tim for giving me the chance to finally try this beer. This was a big-time want for me. Still, like all of my reviews, I strive to remain as objective as possible, resisting hype or other influences, and everything I write is done in real-time stream of consciousness format.  500ml bottle - dated 060519 - poured into a large wine stem at 44F.  Pours a stunning clear deep honey golden, with a finger of fluffy bone white head, perforated with rings of air pockets, and leaving spots of lacing clinging to the glass.  Nose: I can smell this from several feet away. Gentle caramel malt, bursting with honey and flower nectar. The malt aroma is very tame, and really let's the hops have the spotlight. The spring-like floral notes emitting from the hops are unreal. Lilac, magnolia, gardenia, lavender, and honeysuckle, amidst a burst of nectarine, tangerine, mango skin, lemongrass, cedar, and new pine growth. The intense floral notes are the true star of the show here. It's like a flower garden in full spring bloom. Absolutely intoxicating.  Palate: The honey-like caramel malt gently greets the palate with a delicate nectar sweetness, before giving way to the bombardment of floral hops. Manuka honey, magnolia, lilac, and lavender surrounding ripe juicy tangerine, peach, ripe honeydew, and mango flesh. The overall flavour isn't tropical, but it definitely has a succulent, juicy, fresh-squeezed element to it. A rainbow of essential oils and floral terpenes just wash over the palate and transport you to an alpine meadow. The bitterness is decidedly delayed, showing up well into the finish. The finish brings notes of orange zest, fresh hops, and pine sap, before drying out, and shifting towards bitter pine resin and grapefruit pith. The longer it lingers, the more pine-centric it becomes, with a nice, firm, hoppy bitterness. Centennial absolutely shows, as does some Amarillo, but I am truly shocked that there's Simcoe in here. There are zero earthy, musty, or dank flavours. It's just so keenly balanced and rounded.  Mouthfeel/Body: The beer is on the lighter side of medium-bodied. The gentle malt sweetness and oily, resinous hops provide a nice smoothness to the feel, but the body remains quite light on its toes. I just had to double check the ABV, and that is quite surprising. This hides its ABV better than any other beer I think I've ever tried. In terms of heaviness, sweetness, drinkability, and alcohol flavour, this could pass for 6%, no questions asked. Effervescence is fine, and lively, giving the beer some nice lift, and furthering its crisp drinkability. This will go down very easily.  Overall: I've said this once or twice, but I'll say it again. I hate giving a beer the same exact score in each category. It looks lazy, when really, I spend a lot of thought, time, and effort meticulously reviewing the beers I drink. With this one, however, it truly does earn a well thought out 4.5 in each category. That places it just within the ""world class"" boundaries, and I think that's precisely where it belongs. This beer may not be a groundbreaking revolution in brewing today, but one must not forget that this beer was a trailblazer. It pioneered the path of hoppy beer fandom, and it has truly stood the test of time. This isn't just a boring run-of-the-mill West Coast IPA. It shows subtlety and nuance that hops are capable of. It's malt bill is simply a work of art. It hides its weight with near invisibility. It shows that one does not need to rely on any crazy cutting edge double dry hopping methods. It shows that a little bit of bitterness is good, but the bitterness doesn't fight for the focus, or subtract from the drinkability of this beer. It's planted, precise, polished, and pristine. It's cohesive, collected, refined, and impressive. I used to think Maine Beer Company was the father of incredible, super floral-forward, clean West Coast (style) IPAs. I see the influence now. I see how this beer shaped modern beer culture. It isn't just an icon with a cult status. There's a reason it earned that status. It's a perfect double IPA. I set myself up to be disappointed by this beer. Many hyped beers do disappoint. This one does not. It's the grandfather of IPAs. It truly is a world class beer.  Edit: After some thought, I am upping the ""Overall score by one notch, simply because of how beautiful this beer is. It is truly greater than the sum of its parts. I feel a 4.6 is an appropriate score for such a refined, perfected double IPA. It's an integral part of IPA history, and it has secured its renowned status for good reason.",Russian River Brewing Company,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,100

Poured a golden yellow with a 2"" head, impeccable lacing.  Piney hops in the nose, followed by floral notes that fade to orange peel, then bready malts. Taste follows the nose to a T. As it warms I get a tad bit of gumball (maybe the simcoe) and the orange peel takes on more of a mango/stone fruit vibe.  Again, very balanced. Nothing crazy attempted here but it's kind of like your first DIPA all over again. The piney bitterness fades shocks you then fades and you are quickly going back in for another sip.

The nose is really pleasant. Luckily, the taste follows the nose.  Mouthfeel is excellent. Lets you know your drinking an imperial IPA.  The taste is just like it smells, but in addition, there is a nice floral node. So incredibly balanced, it cannot be put into words. It is bitter without being bitter if that makes any sense. Dangerously easy to drink as the alcohol is well hidden.  Worthy of the hype and deserving of the near perfect score.  Even if you don't like IPA's in general, you really should try Pliny the Elder at least once.

863,7971,VoodooBear,4.55,"Presentation: Draft, served in a Revival pint glass.  Appearance: The thick, rocky, one and a half finger head stays around almost until the end and leaves behind some lacing in patches all over the glass. It's a beautiful, crystal clear deep gold color.  Smell: It's a strong aroma that unfolds in layers; starting with some citrus peel and apricot, followed by some earthier pine and floral notes and it finishes with a touch of grains in the background.  Taste: It's quite bitter up front with some citrus flavors of grapefruit and orange and a strong pine/hop resin oiliness that coats the palate as it goes down.  Mouthfeel: It's smooth, quite crisp and medium bodied with medium carbonation.  Overall: It's regarded as one of the best IPAs in the world for a reason. It brings together the fruity and earthy hop characters together beautifully and it remains relatively easy to drink (though the bitterness is quite high) despite the complexity in the nose and palate.

863,7971,GarrettB,4.51,"July 27th, 2015 - The time has come for Pliny the Elder, straight from the font. It's a legendary beer, and looks resplendent in its throne here in Santa Rosa. With a slightly sweeter smell exceptionally balanced against hops, the flavor is immensely deep. Even though I tend to enjoy hoppy brews more for the bouquet than the taste, this offers plenty of both. Sweeter, like a broiled grapefruit, it plays with its ethanol quite well. In contention for my favorite California IPA, it is only rivaled by the Blind Pig. And as I try to determine which I prefer, I suckle on the aftertaste which is punching and long, with a slightly resinous note to enjoy. It is one of the perfect IPAs, rare best served chilled, straight here at the tap.",Russian River Brewing Company,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,100

863,7971,dleurf,4.58,"Being an East Coast guy, I expected more. Maybe that's because of the hype. Still, this was a good beer. Transparent, piney, clean, crisp. The quintessential West Coast IPA",Russian River Brewing Company,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,100
863,7971,fmccormi,4.43,"Straight pour from a 1 pt 1.25 oz/510 ml pry-off bottle to a teku. This has a bottling date of January 08, 2019 printed in white ink near the bottom-left corner of the front label (“BOTTLED ON: 010819”), making this beer just under three weeks old at the time of consumption. Purchased cold, coming right out of the box on its way to the cooler.  Appearance (4.25): A solid three fingers of eager, whipped foam the color of custard comes right off of the pour, capping a crystal-clear, 24 ct. gold-colored body. The head dies down slowly, leaving a pock-marked cap and scattered legs of wide, foamy splotches that look like an archipelago of coral atolls. It dies down almost completely after some time, but still shows good retention.  Smell (4.25): A radiant, clean blend of citrusy fruit (even amounts of ripe pineapple flesh, navel orange zest, and kumquat) and a slurry of herbaceous and resinous notes (pine needles, fresh cut grass, and some ganja for good measure) dominate the nose. Very light, clean grain appears as well, offering a crisp, clean note of common crackers alongside stale, floury pita bread—just very clean, plain flatbread. This is all quite faint in the face of the bouquet of hops here, though.  Taste (4.5): Compared to the nose, the palate is (at first) dominated by ganja and pine, offering dank, resinous bitterness flanked by lightly astringent conifers and a hint of earthy spice, like rich tobacco leaf. It does have undertones of bright citrus, with a soft pineapple sweetness nearly obscured by the aforementioned resin while strong, pink grapefruit pith rises out of that bitterness and continues to ring loud and clear, long into the lingering finish (which itself trails off quite evenly and slowly, fading away with no sudden drop-off). There is a bit of grain hidden in here, again offering that plain but earthy feel of multigrain flatbread with a dry, slightly starchy, floury finish, but it really is dominated by the array of bitter notes that fan out from the middle of the palate all the way through to the finish. No sign of booze. It’s shockingly dry and clean, frankly.  Mouthfeel (5.0): Carbonation washes in with a soft, medium-grit body of gentle bubbles that tingle happily as they cover all surfaces. It easily holds up the body, which feels medium-weight but on the light- side of full thanks to just how dry and crisp it is. That carbonation foams up easily, floating all of the bitter hop compounds before they settle in and feel too astringent. Still, that bitterness really dries out the body, bringing it from medium-weight and crisp to almost vaporous. Again, no sign of booze.  Overall (4.25): What is this beer? The archetypal West Coast (D)IPA, in its most balanced, clean, crisp, and clear form. It’s not my favorite beer ever in that category, because I’ve had others that evoke bombast and utilize unexpected combinations of flavors and aromas—and those are the ones that typically stick with me longer. They may not be the best of the best within this substyle, because they often are prone to some imbalance and the more interesting they are, the more it feels like comparing them is an apples and oranges scenario. This, however, may be near the top of that substyle, thanks to its balance, very obvious technical precision in its brewing and production, and masterful use of hops to deliver a big, powerful bitterness without feeling too challenging (if you like hops). You don’t need me to recommend this beer. Of course you should try it. Will it change your world? Maybe not in 2019, but it’s worth trying to understand why it ruled the world in 2009—and it’s an amazing drink in its own right, even today, any day of the week.",Russian River Brewing Company,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,100
863,7971,NateGoyette,4.84,"Look: Poured from a bottle into a pint glass. Very light coloring, head dissipates quickly leaving some nice rings.  Smell: Strong smell for the coloring. Initial smell of pine, orange, hops, and some underlying sweetness like caramel.  Taste: Outstanding. Bitter citrus at first, then the hops really come through. Tastes like your typical west coast IPA but with an underlying sweetness that is tough to place. There’s no denying the obvious quality of this beer.  Feel: carbonation is relatively high but pleasant. 8.0% ABV and very drinkable. Mouthfeel is a bit oily and sticky but it goes down very easy.  Overall: I wanted to try this because of the hype and was able to find it at a local health food grocery store. There was a limit of 2 per person.

It's extremely crisp and clean. This is as clean and bitter as they come. There is tart, bitter citrus. The Amarillo, Centennial, CTZ, and Simcoe hops are amazingly flavorful and provide a strong, bitter bite. It's the quintessential West Coast IPA. It is crisp and dry with an easy drinking 8% ABV.

Super aroma with kaleidoscopic hoppiness: Pine, grapefruit, and thin tropical; sweet caramel malt and a earthy, leafy, herbal tea-like note. Taste is grapefruit and pine from start to finish back by malty caramel sweetness, a hint of toast and the leafy tea-like hint is there too. Very resinous.

S: Only OK part of the beer. Some dankness, but only very lightly so. Some pine and grapefruit, but not much else.  T: Very good. Refreshing and well-balanced. Lots of piney sweetness, some grapefruit (but not overwhelming), and a fair portion of tropical fruits. The sticky, sweet pine is the most prominent flavor. Great mixture of sweet and hoppy flavors.

Malt is robust and really carries the hops. Finish is super dry with grapefruit pith dominant. That strong bitterness limits ""drinkability,"" insofar as the beer itself sets your pace, encouraging you to wait, let the full flavor develop and dissipate on the palate, and then go in for another sip after due time. In this, Pliny differs from its best New England siblings (you know who I mean), which tend to invite you back for quick sipping. I appreciate Pliny's maturity on this front.

Absolute sacrilege, considering the label decor which clearly emphasizes the importance of freshness to the experience of this beer.  L: It pours with an opaque orange body like a Hefeweizen. The goblet holds precious little lacing from the finger of head that rises from the pour. The bubbles are extremely fine. So is the haze.  S: This is a very mild DIPA. I would even expect that I would say the same of it when fresh. Peach, mango, banana, apricot, plum, lemon, thyme, cooked onion and some very mild bread character are detectable on the nose, but nothing jumps out.  T: This certainly does a fantastic job of hiding the alcohol. Nothing particularly striking in the flavor, but enough of it to hold an 8% brew together. The onion/garlic richness and some oxidized peach take the lead, followed by a building herbal hop bitterness from thyme that ends in sweet honey and wheat bread. Very much like Hopslam. Hopslam is better. Actually this brew doesn't even make my list of top 10 DIPAs.  F: The texture is thick and smooth, but a bit of cloying sweetness lingers on the tongue, exacerbating the nausea from its sweetness. For the reputation, I’m not impressed.  O: If this beer did not carry such a reputation, I would probably be impressed. That said, if this is the best the world of beer can offer, I am sorely disapppinted. Fortunately, it isn't, at least by my taste. For certain I still need to try it fresh, but I honestly doubt that even the day after bottling that it would be hands down the best in the world. Rather than seeking out this rare whale, I recommend trying something more available, like West Coast IPA. Or Hop Stoopid. Or Pure Hoppiness. Or Enjoy By. Or Hoptimum.

863,7971,Henrythethird,4.42,Great brew by Russian River. It’s solid although I have had one bad bottle but overall the hops are on point and it’s something that’s very easy to keep sipping on!

863,7971,Thankin_Hank,4.59,"On draft at the Toronado in San Francisco, I was disappointed in the taste as seemed to be all hop and not much else. I would like to revisit this but that may never happen again since the limited availability. I thought it would be more like Bear Republic's Cafe 15 Racer or Dogfish Heads 90 Minute IPA. Revisiting Pliny the Elder, 01/28/22, in a 17.25 ounce bottle dated 122921. The aroma is fabulous. Has lots of carbonation. I can say near 4 years later and many IPAs ago, the taste is better now than in 2018. That's what drinking IPAs will teach you. A little drier and hoppier than The Blind Pig. The Elder is a fine IPA. I upgraded my review. I'm blessed to have a friend like @RaulMondesi who shared his California beers. Many Thanks Amigo!!",Russian River Brewing Company,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,100
863,7971,Czequershuus,4.79,"This beer pours a bright clear gold with a solid head. The aroma is classic through and through, with notes of grapefruit pith, orange peel, pink grapefruit flesh, and pine. The flavor is utterly clean and classic, with bold bitterness, grapefruit peel, orange peel, dry pine, juniper, and dry caramel. The mouthfeel is medium to full bodied with plenty of carbonation and a dry, bitter finish. Overall this is a spectacular beer. I have tasted before but this is my first full one. It really does live up to its reputation - there is nothing unique here, but it is instead a near perfect example of its style.",Russian River Brewing Company,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,100
863,7971,Wiskeytango,5,Simply the best ipa on planet earth. The color of this beer is just pure sexy. The nose is mind blowing and the taste and feel are second to 0 beers.

863,7971,ZenAgnostic,5,"I quit drinking 5 years ago, after having meticulously rated hundreds of beers. The white whale I could never catch was Pliny The Elder. But now I'm back, this once, for one last dance.  Pliny The Elder. 510mL bottled 02/12/18, 16 days ago. Poured into a Duvel snifter. Mailed in wine shipper by an amazing friend.  Appearance - Pours a big creamy off-white head with fine lacing. Swirling readily generates head. Deep gold body with slight, fine bubbling only at the snifter's etching.  Smell - Heavy grass. Bucolic liveliness appropriate for the coming of spring.  Taste - Very grassy hop with just enough malt underneath to balance the profile. The alcohol is impressively well hidden for such a high ABV beer. Aftertaste has a pleasantly bitter bite. No off tones throughout.  Mouthfeel - Astonishingly silky for the style. Crisp finish.  Overall - Extremely well balanced DIPA. No negative or conspicuous features of any kind. Best described as a standard DIPA without any faults.  5/5",Russian River Brewing Company,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,100

863,7971,Mason_Savoy,4.07,"This is a very good example of what can be done with hops, and a counter to what should not be done. Let's be honest. It's still too hoppy. There's really no call for it, but at least they've managed to get it balanced so that you get an interesting, complex and still drinkable flavor. Equally hoppy beers exist, but they are almost always undrinkable. This one isn't.

863,7971,TheBrewsky,4.76,"Bottled 4/5/18. Look: Dark straw color with unfiltered appearance. 1 finger worth of head from a very slow pour. Loads of lacing on the glass. Smell: Nice hop profile up front, with loads of pine. Hops are present in an earthy/grassy fashion, with some floral aspects. Some citrus on the nose, but the hops and pine are dominant. Taste: Follows the nose. Bright earthy hops with loads of pine on the back end. I do get a little more orange and lemon on the flavor than I do with the nose, which is pleasant. The hops are dominant, but very smooth and balanced. For a DIPA, it is very smooth and not overly bitter. Feel: Medium in body and light to medium in weight, with moderate carbonation. It does have a nice full feel to the beer, and is somewhat soft, despite bitter fizz. Very enjoyable feel. Overall: This beer is famous for a reason, and it is deserving of its notoriety. For a double, it is so darn smooth, and full of a nice hop/pine flavor. Each time I drink it, it always lives up to my expectations. I am grateful to have tried this beer, and to be able to find this regularly. Cheers!",Russian River Brewing Company,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,100

863,7971,SaltofOH,4.4,"Bottle dated 6-6-17. DFH Tulip.  A: pours a brilliant gold with one finger of very bubbly just off-white head. Little visible carbonation to speak of. Retention is good, lacing average.  S: some DIPAs can be smelled as soon as the cap is opened or the bottle is poured; in not getting that here. But as I bring my nose over the glass I am immediately inundated with tart, tropical, tangy, and resinous goodness. Kiwi, key lime, raspberry, hint of pine. All of it is underpinned by a clean sweetness.  T: dank! Arrival is immediately hoppy, citrus, grapefruit peel, mild, crackery maltiness with a hint, just a hint, of sweetness. Balance? No way! But I am surprised by how not bitter it seems. Toward the end it becomes less citrusy and more piney, and then dank - more herbal tasting than any beer I have ever had.  M: lighter side of medium, modest carbonation, pretty darned attenuated and only a little slick.  O: I would say this lives up to the hype. It is a crisp, clean, and super hoppy DIPA with no presence of alcohol whatsoever and not much bitterness. It is the definition of the west coast IPA.  Basically every IPA (and most pale ales) I've had over the last year are trying to be this. Five years ago I can only imagine what this was like to the devoted hop head. Alas, I am not a devoted hop head. An extremely generous friend brought this home for me, and for that I am endlessly grateful. However time and travel do this beer no favors.

One finger of thick white head atop a clear golden glass of ale with okay lacing. Resin, sap, chamomile and dandelion flowers, onion and garlic, pine, orange peel, prickly pear, tomato, alfalfa and the most brief scent of lilac fill the nose, with fresh bready malt in the background which smells a little more like sweet donuts after it warms slightly. It tastes extremely bright at the start then slightly malty, and very pleasantly bitter throughout, with a bunch of the orange, grass, and resin aromas coming through excellently with very subtle rosemary, kiwi, caramelized onion or fresh garlic, and lemon poppy seed muffin batter flavors. Big resinous, sappy, crisp and fresh flavors over top flaky biscuits which seems hectic for a moment before dissipating into a soft, very long-lasting citrusy bitterness. Creamier carbonation, but almost oily mouthfeel and frail influence from the alcohol all around, or at least until I reached the last lukewarm gulp where it showed a bit stronger.  An incredibly jubilant yet comforting beer, I can't get over how pleasurable it is to drink and it's phenomenal hoppiness and maltiness.

863,7971,WickedBeer,4.83,"Finally!! Picked up this beauty at Vendome Wine & Spirits in Beverly Hills, CA. Poured into a Bruges glass, Bottles On date was 04/24/17. 8% ABV.  Look: Deep golden hue, small head of foam, even carbonation flow from the base of the glass. Smell: An incredible combination of sweet breadiness, bitter citrus, and piney hops. Beautiful floral balance. Taste: An amazing hop explosion. Loads of grapefruit give a perfect balance to piney, resinous hops. Still a subtle breadiness, but just as a noticeable afterthought to the beauty that is Pliny! Feel: Very smooth. Sharp, seltzery carbonation that is very smooth as it goes down. Incredibly crisp, the perfect summer IPA (that for many is a one summer in a lifetime).  Okay so as I predicted, this beer is far from overrated. Its balance is incredible, and true hopheads will be able to truly appreciate the bitter grapefruit, herbs, and piney hops all being perfectly balanced into an amazingly easy drinking DIPA. If you ever get your hands on this, don't pass it up. The fact that you can still grab it for under $10 is beyond me, because I would easily pay more to try this again.

I expected more complexity from this beer - particularly given its pedigree - but it tends more towards one not, which it hits, and hits well. This beer trends more towards the blend of dank, thick, and piny that Heady hit so well, and did it well before that time. It's a great piece of craft beer history, and still holds up well, but though it's an exceptional beer, it's no longer one (in my opinion) that warrants a place among the best of the best.

Slightly sweet aroma with minor hints of ethanol, has a bright citrus zest note. T: Repeat of nose with bread and earthy flavor. However hops come through here with notes of citrus, mostly a sweet grapefruit rind note. Finishes with a very soft bitterness. To me, its impressive that this bitterness is so soft, and this is coming from a New England boy. F: Ridiculously smooth. Mouthfeel is soft, smooth, and easy-drinking. There's a bit of a crispness from the carbonation but its pretty balanced. Very refreshing.

The look was absolutely beautiful and crisp like a diamond. The smell was beyond what you would get with a typical DIPA a semi hoppy and friendly scent. The taste was probably the best part about this because the taste was so fresh and so delightful that grapefruit and the fresh hops and pine flavors all go extremely well together. The feel and finish was somewhat on the dry and somewhat bitter side I almost couldn't tell that it was this smooth.

863,7971,PlinyMeNow,4.65,"Had it a few times on draft and a few times from a bottle poured into a pint glass. I don't have much to add to the multiple exhaustive reviews. Currently drinking an extremely fresh one. I've had to downgrade its rating slightly after trying many other IPAs and DIPAs. However, I still marvel at how complex, yet simple it is. If that seems like an oxymoron, allow me to explain. It is complex in the depth of its layers. The smell is uber fresh, fruity and hoppy, citrusy and piney, spicy, grassy, woody, and even a little nutty. The flavor starts with a nice bitter grapefruit rind punch along with some apicrot, orange, lemon zest, and pine, and then you notice some grass and herbs, wood resin even. A faint malt sweetness comes into play as well as a dry cracker-like backbone that all serves to mellow out the bitterness, adding texture and body, like soaking up some lemon juice with bread. Finally comes a dry and bitter, fresh grapefruit finish, reminding you again of its primary mission and asking you to take another ride. I don't detect alcohol. Its simplicity lies in the ease with which these layers are identified -- its lack of busyness. Its mission is singular -- to provide a bitter, fresh, yet balanced and ultimately extremely drinkable DIPA. Each individual attribute may be found to a greater extent in other beers, but its precise balance of attributes is unique and maintains it as the reference standard for DIPAs.",Russian River Brewing Company,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,100

Minimal malt profile here but it is still a balanced beer meaning they loaded up this beer on it's malt base almost to the tipping point with hops but stopped short at the Percy amount!

863,7971,cjgiant,4.57,"Bottle dated 2/13 (one month old): (Revisit 4/4 bottle dated 3/21) Beer pours gold - like a perfect hue of golden - and very clear. The head buildup is significant on a medium pour, with a combination of soapy and frothy head adorning the clear body. Lacing is quite heavy.  Nose is of floral hops to me. There's a little honey-like sweetness with a bit of spice. I get a little evergreen note with some warmth and effort, not as obvious as others have noted. With this I also get just a slightest note of onion/garlic that some doubles give off. Revisit: Little more citrus orange rind and light sweet grapefruit pith, and a little more power overall, up a notch  The taste is a little more evident, especially in the pine notes. The beer opens as the nose indicated with a nice honey cracker malty opening. The pine is light on a colder brew, but blooms nicely as the beer warms. A light tickling of the carbonation leads to some anticipation before dissolving into the pine notes. These start more woody, but slowly move up the tree from trunk to green branch to pine needles. Further warmth allows me to note a light tangerine citrus rind note right after the carbonation fades. The malt opening comes out the other side as the bitter flavors fade, though the lingering taste is a woody pine bitterness. Revisit: maybe I took so long to analyze the first time, I'm thinking the same here, just a little easier to detect.  I honestly expected more from the nose, and my initial sips had me wondering about the hype. But as it hit a more proper temperature, there were some lovely nuances I started to notice. The interplay of malt and bitterness in the middle is fun. I also expected it to be more bitter overall, but I liked the malt component of this beer.",Russian River Brewing Company,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,100

From the very first time I had this beer, I knew it was something special, yet so austere and seemingly ""simple"" that it really does exceed the sum of its parts. Here is potentially the single best double IPA in the world. A consistent, sublime experience captured in a pint glass to be savored and enjoyed. A sincere thank you to my buddy Joe, who bestowed a bottle of this (dated 1/20/17) to me as a quid-pro-quo for shepherding him to and from Logan Airport so he could attend a homebrew release party my buddy and I threw last weekend. Your attendance and contributions are appreciated!  Pours a beautiful, clear golden color with a tight, simple and hugely-retentive head of bone-white foam that laces extremely consistently and never relents throughout the whole pour. Carbonation rises steadily in small streams up from the bottom of my glass and each new pour re-rouses the head with an intense vigor. Pouring the entire bottle in yields a slight bit of haze. What a gorgeous IPA!  The nose is bright and citrus-forward; surprisingly playful and fanciful, with a slight papaya note along with some hay and pine resin. Simple, evocative, devoid of trends... PtE is an exercise in perfect balance and execution, and the nose is no exception by any means. Slightly grassy and even a bit earthy, with some juicy tangerine and clementine in there as well. I'm also getting a bit of green onion, which I know is a note that a lot of people have an issue with, but which I find to be a surprisingly great element that contrasts well with the citrus peel and fleshy, fruity notes here.  Flavor is, of course, heavily bitter and reliant on pine and grapefruit to nail down the palate, though the subtle workings of biscuity, bready malt and the even-handed juicy/tropical aspects really bring the whole thing home. The flavor is probably where the concept of ""balance"" that PtE stands for comes across the best, I feel. The initial flavor is shockingly bitter with grapefruit peel melding instantly with clean, golden malt just in time for the piney and tangerine-like back. Finishes dry... really dry, actually, with a lingering oily, fruity note.  Feel is slick and palate-coating, with a tempered carbonation and medium body that belies its 8% strength. Ethanol is mildly present but not at all overabundant or intense. In my opinion, 8 to 8.5% is probably the best DIPA alcohol range, and this represents the best-of-the-best of the lower-ABV DIPAs. If you haven't had this, you're missing out. A simply amazing, balanced drink. Makes a mockery out of many lower-caliber IPAs.

I prefer lagers, wheat beer and belgian ales...more malt than hop, so these double IPAs don't do much for me.

863,7971,Kdouble,4.68,Bottle dated 12-22-16 poured into a snifter about a month old.  A: a clear and very clean amber color. Around 1-2 fingers of head and tons of lacing left as it faded.  A: The pine definitely dominant with a little grapefruit and a hint of some type of spice.  T: Multiple tastes in this one. An interesting flavor to start and then the pine really shows up. As I pause in between drinks I get a little more of the grapefruit and a little spice.  F: Hops and more hops with some bitter pine rounding it out.  O: A fantastic beer with an amazing hoppy taste. Left me wanting another one or two. Definitely hit the mark and lives up to hype. I really want to try the Younger version to compare.,Russian River Brewing Company,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,100
863,7971,gopens44,4.69,"Looks beautiful. Classy, almost fake looking advertisement contrived head. Two, nearly three fingers of firm, fluffy solid slightly off white foam provides a confident lacing that remains consistently about an inch high in design thoroughly across the glass.  Nose provides an equal portion of malt and hops invasion that results in slight pepper, a little bubble gum, mango, muted pine and a hint of vegetable earthiness.  Taste is equally satisfying, but departs from any sweetness that was in the nose while maintaining a solid attack of pine bitterness and alcohol bite that I was missing from drinking all the New style IPAs lately. With this one I can almost taste what went on to influence so many west coast IPAs I've come to enjoy.

S: Glorious hops... pine, resin, citrus and some herbal character.  T/F: Strong but light malts, some bready flavors and a ridiculously complex and delicious bitter hop kick in the ass. Strong pine and herbal notes with lighter citrus and grapefruit. Peppercorn... slightly floral... smooth and oily on the tongue. Sticky in the aftertaste. Medium in body. Grapefruit on the aftertaste.  O: A classic and a 'whale' for a reason. Just an all-around outstanding beer, and huge thanks to DEK196 for the hookup.

The thing is I only had it twice, but it still remember it vividly. Among IPAs, it is by far one of the easiest to drink. The perfect analogy is Jennifer Lawrence wearing a dominatrix costume. Its powerful, fragrant, hoppy, amazing complex but it light and unbelievably easy to drink, lulling you to a state of wanting to drink it over and over (of course, responsibly)  After drinking a huge array of IPAs, you realize that complexity and power are different things, and most IPAs confuse overly powerful flavors with complexity and general deliciousness.

863,7971,GeeL,4.93,"This is a long review, so I'll cut to the chase and give the ""Overall"" first: This is hands-down one of the best DIPAs I've had in a long time. The clarity of the beer, the crispness of the taste, it's clean and unmuddled. It's complex but simple. I'm glad I have 2 more bottles.  This has been on my ""must try list"" since I first heard about it. I have no idea how long ago that was, but I know the beer was legendary and I've heard about it a long time ago (it is now Oct, 2016).  The bottle I had was 1 month old when I tasted it, though it was in my possession for almost 2 weeks (I had been sick and taste buds shot so waited to have it figuring the trade off between being able to taste and extra aging was valid). Three bottles, and a few other beers, were shipped to MA from CA via a trade for Tree House and other beers local to MA. It was out of refrigeration for a little under a week.  There was a lot of build up for this beer. I shared it with a good friend.  L: crystal clear straw colored. The current craze is cloudy/unfiltered, so this was a nice change of pace. This was as clear as any pilsner. It looked delicious.  S: Clean, refined, quality. I don't know how else to describe it. These days saying it smelled piny, a hint of citrus, and some brown sugar is so typical for a DIPA it's become cliche. The smell was not muddled or complex. It's straightforward and just what a DIPA should seell like. I can only imagine that 16 or so years ago when this smell was relatively new to the beer scene that people went crazy.  Before I tasted it, I reminded myself to be objective. I wanted to taste this beer and compare it to itself, not to other beers. This beer has been around a while, it's a flagship beer of Russian River, and I wanted to put myself back in time to when this beer could not be compared to anything else.  T: After having a gazillion fruity hop-bombs on the East coast, NEIPAs they're called, I was hoping for a good honest beer. No tricks or gimmicks such as excessive cloudiness, hop blasting, etc. This was spot on what I had thought and hoped it would taste like. It fits the cliche for DIPAs perfectly: it has a huge amount of hop bitterness (piney, grapefruit, pineapple) that is supported by a strong malt backbone. There's some sweetness, almost honey-like. It's piny, some hint of citrus, but the taste is clean and crisp and incredibly balanced. I think that's why I say it's quality. It's not aggressive or in your face in any way. It's frigging refreshingly easy to drink. I had guessed right that it's 8%, but it didn't taste like it. A more significant observation is that the flavor didn't linger. It didn't fall flat, but it faded quickly and made me to want another drink sooner that other big hop bombs do.  F: It was thinner than I thought it would be. This made the taste fade relatively quickly. I almost gave ""Feel"" a 5 because back when Pliny was first made this beer would have been considered full bodied. However, even back then, I'm sure I would have thought it faded quickly due to a thin mouthfeel.  O: This is hands-down one of the best DIPAs I've had in a long time.",Russian River Brewing Company,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,100
863,7971,StuB617,4.27,"L: Pretty pour. Clear. Scant head with lingering lace. S: The best part. Pine. Citrus. Oak. Must. T: (Biased New Englander) Excellent beer but compared to... Thin and piney.

863,7971,Beginner2,4.52,"As non-hophead and as an occasional anti-hophead, I now know what you hopheads are talking about. (But it took the most iconic, if not your Holy Grail, to help me see your light.)  Of course, living in the Midwest... I never expected to taste this Pliny rave. But coincidence had me in San Francisco's City Beer store and after they diligently went through my ""1001"" list told me that Pliny The Elder would be there at noon in two days. I showed up at the appointed time and bought three. I took one to a party that no one drank beer (lucky me again.) I took the two remainders home with one going to another party and I found a fast way to make friends. (I may keep the last one to trade on BA, but I may also hog it myself this week... lucky me.)  Never has alcohol been concealed so well in a bitter beer... and never has the bitterness been so aromatic in my nose and linger so lightly on the tongue. Pliny will not convert me to the hophead ideology, but he has made me appreciate fully what I never thought I could.  10/10/19 Also at SF's City Beer store (in their new digs), I bought two more copies. Hard as I might try, I could only change a few words in the above review; nor could I update my rating (certainly my highest rated IIPA and well above my average of 3.8.)

Tropical fruits, peaches and battery acid, pine, pineapple, and sweetness.  Wow. Now I have tasted Pliny. What is most outstanding from the first sip is how smooth, rounded and refined the flavours are. I get the notes of pine and tropical fruits. I get clean linen as well. A fair amount of bitterness too.  Really hides the ABV. Feels like a medium to light body with a little to moderate fine bubbled carbonation. So smooth its incredible.  The hype, yes, and now I finally get to give my own opinion. I went to Russian River in Santa Rosa, CA today and picked up 6 bottles of this legend. Now, Sept 15th I am finally drinking it.

863,7971,logicalparadox,4.48,"Finally breaking 1,000 beers rated here on Beer Advocate. Go me! A celebration worthy only of a true legend, and a fresh sample at that: not even a month since the bottled on date. Props to my man out in Nebraska who hooked me up with a trade to bring this to my glass at last.  How does one analyze, assess, judge, rate, and/or compare a legend with anything close to objectivity? The answer is it's not possible. Not knowingly. If I'd had blind tasted this brew or (miraculously) hadn't heard of it before, then my lens would be more pure, without the weight of so much hype. It's like meeting a celebrity and realizing they are just a person like you: fallible, imperfect, a mere mortal. So it is here.  A: Pours a beautiful amber with an impressive head into my tulip glass. Foam has a nice, fine texture has that oozey, whipped cream like character that some brews have, rather than sudsy.  S: The nose is fresh, very clean, very sharp and hoppy, but much more subdued than expected. Grapefruit and orange, zesty. A bit of pine, but no at all resinous. Not getting much fruitiness otherwise. Not even a hint of alcohol or ester.  T: Pliney hits my palate with a flurry of small jabs, bobbing and weaving, working on me like some kung fu, jujitsu, ninja type shit. Not hooks, no upper cuts, not finishing move. Waiting for the haymaker that never comes, I realize my expectations are shaping my experience. This beer is subtle. Hoppy, yes. Firm and gripping bitter notes are present from the start to end of a quite long finish. Pithy, but not biting. Grapefruit and orange in the citrus profile, some herbaceous and grassy notes, but it's all well blended and none of it is in-your-face as I've come to expect from DIPAs today. Malts are even more of a shock... this isn't very malty at all, just enough to hold things together. Light, but I wouldn't call it juicy. Delicious and doesn't leave me with palate fatigue, but a surprise. Alcohol is entirely invisible (and at 8%). Very balanced.  M: VERY light bodied for the style, which can often be syrupy with malts to balance out an overwhelming hop character. This take is opposite of that: a DIPA that drinks like a session IPA. Refreshing and paired well with some shredded pork lettuce wraps as a nice palate cleanser.  O: Legends rarely live up to their reputations. How can they? They can only ever be the shadows of titans. It's more complicated taking timelines into context.  The craft beer scene, and the IPA scene in particular, has evolved so much in the last several years. Second and third wave interpretations (maybe more or less than that, I'm certainly not an expert there!) have moved the bar ever higher, making really, really good IPAs easy to get in all corners of the country. With Pliny being so difficult to come by due to such limited supply and such high demand, especially for someone like me on the East Coast, is it all worth it and does that figure into my feelings on the beer?  Every local or regional brewery has a flagship IPA as one of their first releases these days and they've all gotten respectable and some down right amazing. Other once sought-after craft labels have gone national and are easy to come by now. Is this really that much better than a Sculpin or a Hop Stoopid or a Dogfish 90 Minute? Perhaps that's not the right question, because ""better"" implies we are comparing like with like. Or, for that matter, what about other ""grail"" beers that are hard to come by and legendary in their own rights? Heady Topper, Zombie Dust (an APA, not a DIPA, but still), Jai Alai... those are just some of the ones from my personal hads list that come to mind. Is Pliny worthy of having and holding its number 1 status without risk of it being called ""overrated""? (I'm tempted to make an analogy to the way Twilight Struggle held the number 1 spot on Board Game Geek for so long, but that would go over the heads of non-boardgamers).  But IPA's, aside from better on average and utterly ubiquitous, have also migrated toward ever bigger, ever bolder beasts of beers over the years, and in several different flavor directions for that matter. The quest for more and more IBU's, fresher and more diverse hops, the use of hop oils, hop rocketing at the tap. There have been shifts toward the piney and sappy, the fruity and juicy, the citrus bomb, or toward more exotic fruit notes, or herbal forward takes. With all of that, Piny remains perhaps the best example of the ultimate zen that this style can achieve, and that is only ever found in balance. Pliny is all about balance, and is more of a beaujolaise than a cab sauv. I don't know if I've ever had a double IPA where the word DELICATE came to mind as a good summary description.  Past, future, present... hype meets reality... This is a damn good beer all the same. An amazing IPA that, if no longer undisputed king, deserves continued respect and admiration and, most of all, enjoyment.",Russian River Brewing Company,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,100

Smell - Mostly hops and pine, very clear, you know what you are smelling.  Taste - Hoppy, piney, resinous... has a great lingering flavor of pine and some malt. On the bitter side. Not a lot of lemon or fruit flavor, just a straight up IPA.  Feel - Smooth, medium body, bubbly in appearance but surprisingly low in carbonation.

Gone are the trends of today with the excessive haze, sweet malts, and tropical hop notes and in are the flavors of years past. Nice caramel malt backbone that carries the hops and allows them to shine in numerous ways- on the forefront of the palate is a quick blast of pine and resin, which mellows out into a grapefruit-like bitterness on the back end.

Nice puffy head of medium and big soapy bubbles sticks around, leaving thick lacing on the glass.  S: Major notes of grapefruit pith and dank, floral earth. Light, very slightly sweet malt in the background, but overwhelming bitter citrus and resin.  T: Follows the nose. Citrus dominates up front--lightly sweet grapefruit pith and lemon juice. Excellent mid-mouth balance provided by a lightly sweet crackery malt presence. Pine and spruce round out the taste, providing a lingering bitterness on that coats the sides of the mouth.  M: Archetypically west coast in feel, it's ultra potent in its up-front delivery of the hops and unforgiving throughout the taste, providing continuous waves of intense flavors. Medium feel is slightly creamy, but nowhere near the level of its east coast counterparts. The overwhelming bitterness on the finish stings the back of the mouth long after each sip.  O: Revisiting Pliny for the first time since I began exploring the hazier, 'NE-style' IPAs, Pliny certainly continues to hold its own. While it doesn't possess the fruitiness or creaminess that I've come to expect of similar world-class IPAs, it's not attempting to do so. Instead, it maximally delivers all of the floral, earthy, and bitter citrusy aromas/flavors its hops have to offer as best as anything else out there.

Taste follows, piney, resiny, grapefruity, with intense bitterness. Relative to that bitterness, and the abv, a pretty low malt profile. Much more about the bitter than the sweet. Love that. Reminds me of why this one is a classic. Terrific mouthfeel, too--balanced, with moderate, totally apt, carbonation.

This was dated 6/1 and I wanted to get to it while it was still fresh, which was thankfully the case!  The pour to this looked just like it did in the image up above - amber, luminescent, and full of a head that just never quit. It stayed throughout my session and stuck around on the side of my pint glass as the fullest and soapiest lacing that I've seen in quite a long time. Pine, resin, grapefruit citrus pith, and alcohol were all in the nose with even more in the taste. Unbelievably smooth for something this strong, to the point where there was no overt hop burn to be detected. The mouthfeel was that of a strong herbal, minty hoppiness with lots of resin underneath, as that stuck around on my teeth long after each sip went down. Truly, a ""West Coast"" beer from start to finish!  The alcohol was here but with a frest-cut grassy feeling and enough of a malty presence to give this body, you'd never realize that this even had any potency to it. So easy to see why this was on every ""must-try"" list that I've come across over the years - just like Sierra Nevada Pale Ale, this was the gold standard for it's respective style.

Big piney and a bit citrusy aroma, and then some pear and other stone fruits. Begins with mild carbonation, carrying a sophisticated combination of stone fruits over Pilsner malt sweetness, then biting pine and somewhat citrusy hop flavors take over, for an exquisitely crisp, just bitter enough finish.

The hop aromas are kept at a volume around 7 out of 10, in other words, solid, but not over powering. Taste is very much smooth pine hop qualities, with herbal and resin hop notes adding to the character. Pliny the Elder is a bit on the bitter side, but nothing overwhelming. It is well balanced, and well executed - the best part of this beer. Mouth feel is bubbly, with a slight abrasive quality in an otherwise velvety texture.

863,7971,BeerDocT,4.81,"BIG thanks to my friend Nancy for trading me one of my home-brewed quads for this Legend of American Brewing. My fingers are trembling as I type this...tears are streaming down my face...LOL! I love IPAs and Double IPAs...this really is an honor.  Appearance 4.0: Pours out a very attractive deep, golden hue. OK head (1/4"") and decent lacing. No particulate matter; completely clear.  Smell 4.75: Really fantastic bouquet! Pineapple Upside Down Cake immediately comes to mind, followed by a deep, malty, hoppiness. Very, very promising.  Taste 5.0: Front is somewhat dry and stays in the front of the palate. Almost a ""dusty"" flavor of hop alkaline bitterness. Very nice. Middle is like an explosion of hoppiness (hence the name of the beer; Pliny the E. died during the famed Vesuvius eruption), with well-balanced maltiness seeping in from the top of the palate. Still, this level is somewhat dry, which is remarkable given this beer's ABV. Finish is silky smooth and hoppy, with a very, very pleasant hint of alkaline hoppiness and a slightly sweet hint of sweetness floating around. Also a warmness in the mouth at this level, which indicates the high ABV. No ""booziness,"" though. Aftertaste is long and lovely: smooth, malty with a slightly piney hop hint.  Mouthfeel 4.75: Excellent level of conditioning for this style. Not an area where this legend lets you down.  Overall 4.75: Excellent and easily understandable as to why it is a legend and why it inspired its own parade of copies. What a genius blending of hops and hop additions. This beer is BIG...8% ABV will knock you out if you aren't watching and can really sneak up on you because Pliny does not have any hint of booze whatsoever. Experienced tasters may feel a slight warmness which indicates that this brew will kick you in the keister, but other than that, the focus is on the amazing hop blend.

First I would like to say that Pliny lives up and exceeds all expectations. Upon opening a bottle you get a strong aroma of hops, fruits and pine. The beer pours a clear golden with moderate carbonation, and leaves a bright white finger head. First couple of sips you are hit by the full flavor of hops, leaving a slight burning bitterness. But the more you drink, the more layers of flavors are revealed. Fruits and spice become more apparent as the beer settles. A slight sweet malty linger backs up the hops on the tail end.

863,7971,Zythophile,4.6,"Bottle Date: 6/2/16 Palate Contaminants: other beer  Okay, I'll try it.  Appearance is a very clear amber with a head that lingers.  Smell is a pleasant cedar scent. Some other floral smells, along with candied orange. It's not the hammer and anvil like Trillium, but it is super nice. I guess I should get my nose out of the glass and pour some in my mouth...  Taste starts out with a savory earthiness. (That's such a strange description, but it's what I get.) There's sweetness, but it's not sweet; there's bitterness, but it's not bitter. The hopping is perfect, but I'm not getting enough complexity beyond the earth tones – which are perfectly executed – to really drive the rating up. Cedar, other smoked woods, and non-sweet candied citrus are the predominant flavors. Don't get me wrong, what's there is pretty damn good.  Feel is the smoothest and easiest to gulp that I've had. It's also has some weight to it. A little swishing around the mouth intensifies the flavors a bit without getting fizzy. Overall, I'd say that it cannot be improved upon for me.  I have some bacon-wrapped shrimp on a cedar plank in my freezer, and I'm going to have to cook those up to consume with my remaining bottle. Man, some West Coast IPAs crank up the bitter, but this one has exemplary balance, making me actually really enjoy that gustatory sensation.",Russian River Brewing Company,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,100

863,7971,dexterk1,4.84,"Had this on draft in San Diego recently. Color is a beautiful golden/ light copper. This beer comes with a lot of hype and therefore a lot of expectation when someone who has been seeking it finally tries it. For me it lives up to the hype. Taste is an excellent balance of citrus, fruity and pine. Finish is excellent and leaves you wanting and able to have more. Ends pretty cleanly without much bitterness. Smell is almost better than the taste. Aromatic, clean and not heavy or overly piney/resinous. Overall, a beer worth seeking out an having for sure.",Russian River Brewing Company,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,100
863,7971,DaverCS,4.64,"Picked up a case while at Russian River on a beer trip with my dad.  Pours a filtered golden-honey color with 1 finger of a well retaining head. Phenomenal lacing on the glass.  Aroma is primarily dominated by pine, a bit of grapefruit, a solid amount of malt sweetness, and a kiss of citrus.  Taste is much more balanced than expected. There is a very prominent malt backbone that keeps the bitterness in line. I was expecting a hugely bitter hop bomb, but this is balanced. Sure there is a solid kick of bitterness but it’s not overwhelming. There is a mild amount of carbonation with a creamy mouthfeel. Taste is again very pine-forward and resinous. Some nice citrus notes come forth, as do grapefruit peel.  My overall assessment is that the beer is very good. However, the hype surrounding it is a bit insane. It’s a prime example of the class: no off flavors, well-balanced, and delicious. My only critiques is that the malt-backbone is a bit too much, which does mute some of the hops and creates a bit too thick of a mouth-feel for my preference. I see this pairing well with Pliny and beer bites of course! It gets a 93/100.",Russian River Brewing Company,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,100
863,7971,luisitoelmatador88,4.75,"Look: copper gold and clear. standard CA west coast imperial IPA colors.  Smell: very clean smelling brew with hops shining. I also get a nice citrus blend and floral. Very minimal caramel malt sweetness.  Taste: hoppy, citrus, a bit of stone fruit. You get a super amazing hop bit at the back in the finish and it smacks you right in the face. The subtle malts your get in the beer accentuate the sweetness you get from the fruity notes. The medium level bitterness can be compared to like an orange zest or orange pith type thing. This beers balance is spot on.  Mouthfeel: I pretty much this is the characteristic that has been setting this beer apart for me ever since I first had it back in the day. The mouthfeel is smooth and a little thin for an 8 percent but not in a bad way. In this scenario the light character of the beer gives it an insane drinkability and refreshing satisfying quality. After waves and waves of flavor pummel your palate, the piney delicious hop oils coat your tongue with a beautiful aftertaste.  Overall: Even though I am not as amazed with this brew as I was my first couple tries I am super appreciative of the path its paved for so many breweries and recipes that followed. It's been around for forever and its quality hasnt seemed to diminish too much. A super fresh Pliny the Elder at just the right temperature still hits the spot and is a real treat.

I could immediately smell some floral, pine and citrus aromas. The taste is more of a mix of the piney and citrus hoppiness with a caramel malt flavor in the background. The mouth feel is very smooth. This has to be the most perfectly balanced beer I have ever tasted. In fact I'm not sure that I knew what a balanced beer truly was until I tried this beer.

Totally delicious though. Color is paler than I expected. Smell is floral and inviting. Taste has a sweetness I didn't expect, but works well ... reminiscent of how Belgian beers use sweetness to complement the booziness. But it doesn't come off as something decadent and rich like you would expect from an imperial IPA ... it's something that I want to drink a few of because they are so damn drinkable.",Russian River Brewing Company,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,100
863,7971,Skrumpy,4,"So I know this beer gets all the highest marks, and I do think it's a good beer, but not a 5 or 100. I had an imperial pint at The Horse Brass Pub in Portland, OR. The head was thin and dissipated quickly. Minimal lacing. The color is golden amber, clear in appearance. The smell is very nice; pine, citrus and caramel malt. Also some earthy tones, and bread. The flavor is bright; citrus, pine and grapefruit, with a sweet malty finish. Bitter hops aftertaste, very resinous mouthfeel. An excellent beer overall.",Russian River Brewing Company,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,100

863,7971,CraftBeerApprentice,4.95,"Dated 4/26/16, consumed 5/13/16. Poured into a Spiegelau IPA glass. Has a clear, golden yellow hue with a white head. Strong lacing. Aroma yields notes of orange, tangerine, grapefruit, and pine. Very hop-forward taste with little-to-no perceivable malt character; taste follows the nose exactly. Fairly hefty body, but not super thick for a DIPA. Finish is perfectly balanced and super refreshing, leaving no lingering bitterness. Overall impression: this beer has effectively ruined other IPAs for me. The legends aren't without merit; this is one hell of a double IPA and basically sets the standard of what an excellent double IPA should taste like. It's flavorful, but not obnoxiously hoppy, and it doesn't use so much malt that it ends up tasting sticky or syrupy, but enough to support the citrus character and perfectly balance the hop bitterness. It's crazy to think the guys at Russian River crafted Pliny not because they knew what would make an amazing DIPA, but because they were trying to learn how to brew a DIPA. And I doubt they ever guessed it would become such an iconic, sought-after beer.",Russian River Brewing Company,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,100

For a double ipa the new it seems like the new breed is taking over but this is still the classic. A: Light orange and hazy. Nice creamy almost white head of very small to moussy bubbles. S: Pine and citrus on the nose with a little biscuit/breadcrust T: The pine and citrus from the nose are a smooth punch to the tongue. I get no grain and medium bitterness on the back end. Bittering hops linger through aftertaste and bring you back wanting more. O: The classic example of a double ipa. Is it worth trading your first born?

Much different than your usual hop-bomb IPA's.  F- Fairly heavy for an IPA, solid carbonation.  O- It's a very good IPA that I would buy regularly if I could reliably get it in my area.

863,7971,Christoffer91,4.44,"Fresh bottle; dated 4/14 I believe and tasted on 4/30. Everyone knows about this beer, so I'll just give my general impressions having had a lot of other west coast IPAs.  First, don't come to Pliny expecting ""tropical"" or ""juicy"" new American or NZ hop profile; it's a more classic hip profile, but a damn good one. I got a lot of Simcoe dankness on the nose, which I'm a fan of. Hop flavor opens up to more citrus notes. Again, no super-hype hop flavor citra bomb here, just all the best of what classic west coast hop flavor should be. Also, surprisingly not that bitter; we drank a growler of fresh Ruination 2.0 just before this, and it was night and day, with the Stone being much more bitter.  Next, the thing that blew my mind about this, and what I'm really taking away from my first Pliny is the malt character. Hops are important in an IPA, but this has to be the most delicious malt flavor I've tasted in a long time. For an ""epitome of the style"" type of beer, it doesn't seem like other brewers are nailing the Pliny balance the way they could be by this point in time. It's perfect; not sweet, but present, super uber clean, with substantial mouthfeel like a good pale ale has. I guess ""dry"" is a word that gets tossed around IPA a lot, and maybe the hops increased the perception of sweetness for me, but it was not thin (which a lot of IPAs are), yet not heavy (which a lot of IPAs are). So clean.  Great beer.",Russian River Brewing Company,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,100
863,7971,ChrisSchlosser,4.5,"My friend from California sent this to me, I've been wanting to try it for a while.

It really adds to the spectrum for me, however, I did have it almost 2 months after bottling. But I had no choice, they brought it to me from a case in the back. What was I going to say, don't you have a fresher one? I felt it was take it or leave it, and the choice was obvious. My mission will now be to drink it as fresh as possible, to see how much stronger the hop bitterness and presence can be. maybe I will have it on tap next since it seems easier to get it that way here in the Southland",Russian River Brewing Company,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,100

I like the look of its bubbles running up the sides of the glass. The smell is pretty standard. Can't pinpoint which hops are used, but their presence is obvious, a nice little malty ""aftersmell"" is present as well. Tastes good, good balance of sweet and bitter. I'm not much of a hophead, but I would have preferred a stronger hop flavor than it has. But it's a solid taste, I can see why people like it. It's got a clean, light mouthfeel. Very drinkable, so be careful, drink it too fast and you'll remember it's 8%! Overall, good brew. Did it blow my mind? No. Would I stand in line for hours to buy it? No. But it is good.

It's lightly carbonated with a solid medium feel and an touch of smooth slickness.  Overall a very well crafted IIPA that drinks like a lower ABV beer.

A beautiful light golden/copper color that is crystal clear (clear enough to read fine print through).  Smell: The aroma is pretty powerful. It is citrusy and very floral. Slight tart smell and slightly fruity. There is also a hint of caramel and malt.  Taste: There is a nice PUNCH of hops at first. Very crisp and “bright” tasting. The bitterness is pretty strong at first, then it fades a bit to let the other flavors make their appearance, but then it seems to come back. During this gracious pause from the hops, you get flavors of sweet caramel and a savory buttery flavor. There is also a nice roasted woodsy / earthy flavor as it starts to trail off. As the other flavors and hop bitterness fade, you are left with nice citrus and a slight charred wood after taste.  Feel: Upper light to low medium mouthfeel. Doesn’t feel this as it stays quite bubbly the whole time in the glass. It does feel quite slick (probably form the larger amounts of hop oils).  Overall: Great! Not sure about this being the perfect beer though. It is balanced quite well -some more sweetness would be ok though. All of my favorite hop flavors are in this one. This brew never lost its fizz and never a gap or hole in the foam. This was earthier than I expected.

The pour is magnificent with mango-apricot glows highlighted by pale edges as its light struck. Slight haze, 10% opacity. Head is huge, 3 fingers, and develops a reverse bowl in the middle.  Aroma is...holy smokes. Perfect combination of pine and fruits. Uhhhh...mazing? It's got herbal notes, spicy notes, as well as the trademark freshly peeled orange, cored pineapple, and pine needles. Touches of raw avocado, sushi style. As the head recedes, onion and dank resins come out that slightly distort the pure aromas here.  Taste? Wow. Pliny is neither overwhelming nor plain. I was expecting a palate buster but that's not the case. It scrubs the tongue slightly with a bit of oils and resins, but for the most part it stays very tropical with a hefty dose of malty biscuit notes. Mango, papaya, melon, cantaloupe, orange, pineapple...then the resins come in to dirty it up just a touch. Finish is dirty pine, dried mango, and hop resins.  Feel is thick, juicy, and enough carbonation to let it slide down easily and make it pleasurable.  Pliny is one HELL of a beer. It's no wonder it scores a 100 out of 100 on BA.

Hoping this doesn't affect the quality knowing fresh fresh is always way better. But took my chances anyway.  Pour is an almost-opaque golden/copper. Pretty clear without much haze to it. Foamy, two finger thick head that doesn't dissipate very quickly. Moderate lacing.  Smell is more citrus and pine foward than anything. Almost an earthy and grassy smell. Very slight tropical flavors, some mango and pineapple. But the fruitiness is very subtle. Pine tree bark and citrus pretty much dominates.  Taste is simple and effective. Very easily drinkable for a double IPA. No taste of alcohol, just the perfect balance of the sweetness, malts, and hops. Quite possibly the most balanced IPA I've ever had. But is that a good thing? Depends on what you're looking for. Because nothing with Pliny really ""stood out"" as far as flavors go. Moderately piney, moderately tropical, nothing expiremental. But maybe that's a good thing.  Overall, very well balanced and nothing over the top. Maybe I'm too spoiled by these big hoppy malty DIPA's. Or too spoiled by these NE-style juice bombs.

Parents went to Napa and shipped a couple of bottles back.",Russian River Brewing Company,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,100
863,7971,NeilSilber1,4.78,"Pours bright golden clear on draft with scores of tiny elevating bubbles rising to a big white fluffy crown. Notes of hoppy pine and IPA love without any added “flavours” make this the standard DIPA that others try to benchmark against. Fresh, crisp, slightly bitter and smooth with subtle citrus grapefruit and lemon citrus back notes. This is a great (set the) standard double IPA!",Russian River Brewing Company,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,100
863,7971,Sourbatch18,4.94,Ahhhh finally. I don't want to sound like a hype beast but this beer was so delicious. Got it on tap at Toronado here in San Diego and felt like I was in heaven. Aroma was dank and piney with a hint of grapefruit. Taste was so balanced with hops and malts. Definitely crossed this off my bucket list,Russian River Brewing Company,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,100
863,7971,SerialTicker,4.5,"Bottle from 2/19 and poured 3/22. Given to me unexpectedly from Tony -- as if you haven't seen it enough, thanks a ton! Obviously been high on my wants list since I started drinking craft beer. This is a big thing for me.  Appearance: Beautiful, clear, light amber color. There's a bright white head that dies down and leaves a shallow head on top with quite a bit of lacing. Plenty of carbonation coming from the laser etching at the bottom of my glass... seriously good looking IPA.  Smell: A little juicy, but very piney and resinous. Nice sweet malt. Very ""clean"" on the nose. It doesn't show its alcohol at all. Really enjoying the pineapple and mango aromas as it opens up/warms up a bit.  Taste/feel: In terms of a DIPA, I think it falls short of the best ones I've had only because it's a bit thin and light tasting -- but at the same time, that's what impresses me about this beer. At 8%, it drinks like 6% -- no alcohol, light yet intense flavor, and all-in-all delicious. This is such a stupidly well-balanced beer. There's a bitterness on the end that lingers a bit with a pine flavor, but I love it: it has me constantly coming back for more. The feel, as I alluded to, is a bit light. It drinks a bit more like a regular IPA, as it doesn't have a full feel... yet it doesn't bother me. It impresses me. The carbonation is perfect  I'm really trying to rate this as objectively as possible -- it's tough because my expectations have always been so high for this beer. I will say that it is absolutely fantastic, but that it's not a total one-of-a-kind beer that needs to be traded for at all costs. The chances are, if you've had one of the many world-class DIPAs out there, you've tasted something similar to this.  Without a doubt though, find this beer. There's so much history with it. Not only that, the balance is perfect for the style (leaning a bit towards more bitter, which I love), and it's so -- I know it's vague -- pure tasting that it's something every beer connoisseur ought to experience.",Russian River Brewing Company,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,100
863,7971,fireazzi,4.02,"Pliny of the ""big"" double IPA's did not win in a blind taste test. I am definitely more biased to east coast doubles but even in the blind test it didn't take me away.

Little streams of bubbles continue to rise throughout the whole experience.  S: A ton of citrus hops with mangos, oranges, malt and a bright pine finish. Lots of sweet aromas that are tempered slightly by the hops and malt.  T: A lot more hops and malt, especially upfront. Soft citrus and orange follows with a small twinge of bitterness that isn't overpowering and lingers nicely. Perfect balance of flavors!  F: Medium body, but very light finish due to the carbonation. Very drinkable and compliments the taste very nicely.  O: I couldn't be happier with the flavor balancing. Very sweet on the nose, but doesn't negatively affect the flavor and helps keep the bitterness under control without squashing it.

S - tons of citrus, very tropical. Pretty sure this was fermented from a can of concentrate banana-orange-mango juice my poor family bought from the dollar store growing up.  T - extremely subdued and not what I was expecting. Very clean/crisp/bright but also much sweeter than I expected. Zero alcohol. Very good, extremely drinkable.  M - High carbonation but thin. Drinks like a light beer.  O - I have no complaints with this beer really. It's well rounded and very good. But there's nothing ""WOW HOLY SHIT"" about it.

Lots of tropical fruits such as mango and orange mix with a touch of pine and sweetness. T. Balance is near perfect. For 8% I don't receive a touch of alcohol. A nice blast of hops up front leads to a sweet and smooth with a bit of a pine bite on the finish. F.

Malt extraction is near perfect, the hop profile says expert craft on display. M - Full n body, a bit slick on the palate, a sweet linger with just enough bitterness to close the deal.

Neither is never NOT there, but the hops slowly creep to prominence in a wave of citrus pith to pine pitch that ends in a vageuly warm, hoppy finish. Dryish, sweetish, piney, fruity, malty, hoppy.

Taste: Pretty straightforward with the blueberry and tropical fruit notes. This beer conceals the alcohol very well. Beer also does a great job of hiding the 100 ibu. No bitterness on my pallet until about 5 seconds after the drink. From there I got the lingering bitterness on the back half of my tongue. I never tasted the malts but there obviously there concealing the hop bitterness. Mouthfeel: Just a smooth easy drinking beer. No chewiness just smooth and drinks like a lower abv beer. Overall: Was super excited to get a chance to try this beer. My brother brought me a bomber back from his San Diego vacation. I can see why people think so highly of this beer.

Its not like a citrus bomb where you feel like your in a tropical paradise, but hot dayummm the nose on this brew is appealing.  Citrus up front, complimented by a subtle but definitely noticeable sweetish malt flavor. Finishes with a slightly sweet pine taste that sits really nicely on the tongue. Its all about BALANCE, achieved to perfection. Mouthfeel is on point.  It is hyped? Yes. It is a great beer? Yes. So who cares if its over hyped… or if its the best IPA in the world. This is all subjective of course. In addition, no point to compare it to Heady or SOS… because its completely different, which is great because variety is what keeps you guessing.

863,7971,thepenguin,4.57,"L: Pours an absolutely beautiful golden-copper with superb clarity, an abundant white head with good retention and lacing.  S: Grapefruit and some pine, with a bit of delicate malt behind it. Good, but the aroma could come on a bit stronger in my opinion.  T: Resinous bitter citrus rind flavors up front, showing signs of classic puckering US C-variety hops. As with the nose, it displays some delicate pilsner-like malt that adds a bit of bready caramel, particularly towards the back-end, bringing this beer into the realm of the DIPA. Long bitter resinous finish balanced by that dense bready malt. An excellent classic IPA flavor profile the leans towards drinkability. I could – though definitely shouldn’t – drink this all day.  F: Medium body with smooth retrained carbonation and a slick, silky mouthfeel. Just a hint of ethanol presence.  Overall: The OG of whalez, it’s hard to overstate the status this beer has held within and without the craft beer community. Is it the be-all-end-all of DIPAs? Of course not – no beer is or ever should be. But it’s an excellent one and it is easy to see why it garnered the acclaim that it has within its historical context.

Carbonation is clearly visible forming on the nucleation points at the bottom of the glass forming a pillar of bubbles up to the head.  Aroma is a mix of citrus and resin hops. Absolutely delicious makes you want to drink it right away.  So I did and was not disappointed. Body is balanced. Nice malty backbone with lots of bitter piney hops and notes of citrus.

863,7971,joeweis,4.89,"I had the good fortune of traveling to the PNW and then on down to Santa Rosa to get my hands on both draft and bottled Pliny. As many say the nose was the best part of this beer...until I tasted it. I got a lot of the citrus nose in the taste as well, balanced with the hoppy 'bitterness' too.  The importance of freshness is key as I notice a slight difference when I opened one last night (25 days after the bottle date). It's still a GREAT IPA and I'm sure would hold its ground against many others but the freshness is not to be taken lightly.  Pliny on draft was the mecca for me. Well done!",Russian River Brewing Company,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,100
863,7971,Sabtos,4.22,"Proud Pliny first-timer. The second I broke the airtight seal on the cap, before I even removed it, with my nose at least 3 feet up from the bottle, my eyes widened in awe with the immediate understanding of what everyone has talked about for so long. The fact that the scent could hit my nose that quickly, strongly, and pleasantly was truly impressive.  The nose on this is definitely the best part of the Pliny experience, for me. Very tropical, exotic, transporting to some other heavenly world without being fruit juicy or indicative of any of the upcoming bitterness. I'm not sure I've smelled anything quite like this from a beer that wasn't intentionally infused with an overpowering fruit or other ingredient.  That being said, the taste of this doesn't quite live up to the preview that the aroma gives. While it is a pretty delicious brew compared to most IPAs, the light tropical scent gives way to a typically hoppy-bitter IPA. While still citrusy, it's a flavor profile that a number of breweries have been consistently providing for years. I would throw out Gangster Frog, Jai Alai, or even 60 Minute IPA in a blind taste test and bet it would be very difficult to identify Pliny based solely the flavor.  I received the bottle later than I would have liked--it was around 20 days old, but still quite fresh. However, I'm sure that affected the flavor.

The hops are certainly resinous and juicy but not in the least bit bitter! The flavor is just incredible!  Feel: Drinks as smooth as silk. Almost has a creamy characteristic to it. I could drink this all day.  Overall: This beer certainly lives up to the hype and maybe even exceeds it! I would prefer this to Stone Enjoy By, Heady Topper, or even Sip of Sunshine; it's that good!

I was out of town for Thanksgiving, and it takes a while to smuggle this stuff all the way from California to Alabama. Look: Great head and retention. A full two inches of foam. The beer itself is a nice, bright, clear yellow. Smells sweet and hoppy. The taste is smooth and a little piney.

The appearance was a hazy bronzed golden orange to amber color with a beautiful one finger white foamy lacing running around the glass. The smell started off with a sly bittersweet luscious pine rolling into a citrus rind-like and pulp-like hoppiness. An ever so slight grassiness wants to balance. The taste was moderately bittersweet take the citrus and the pine to hit each other like two freight trains colliding. I'm getting it all at once. There's the burst of the sweet and the burst of the bitter. Its all there. The mouthfeel was about medium bodied with a sly sessionability about it. Carbonation seemed to feel exactly right for a DIPA. There's enough bitterness as a DIPA and enough sweetness to cling to my tongue extremely nicely.

863,7971,SHDoyle,4.27,"Description: Bright, clear, golden look that kind of reminded me of apple juice. The white head wasn't very thick but it did leave quite a bit of lacing on the glass. None of the aromas were overwhelming, but pine, citrus and floral were noticeable. The taste carried many more pine and bitter notes than the smell would have suggested and the aftertaste was very clean and dry. More hop forward than some the elite East Coast IPAs. Alcohol wasn't apparent and the feel was a little fuller-bodied than a normal IPA.  Suggested food pairing: A grilled white fish, maybe halibut  If you like this beer then you should also try: Head Hunter  Ideal time to drink this beer: This beer is so quintessentially West Coast, Central/Northern California that I can't imagine it being better anywhere else. Since that region is more commonly known for its wine production, maybe you could have a Pliny after attending some wine-centered event. It could wash the taste of condescending stuffiness from your mouth.  Overall: 4.25 (This beer is good and I would likely drink it again) This is a good, solid IPA but didn't really have anything that put it over the top for me. I thought it was better than Heady Topper, but not as good as Abner or Sip of Sunshine. As I drank the beer and it warmed a bit, I think the flavor and aroma released a little more, so if I had it to do over I may let it warm some more. It's a great example of a West Coast IPA, but I wouldn't go out of my way to find or try this.

Very good beer but not the ultimate",Russian River Brewing Company,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,100
863,7971,caplone,4.44,"Pours a clear gold with medium head and retention. Smells like walking through a forest of pine trees.

Great balance in the taste, toasty malt backbone with plenty of bitter resiny pine, strong grapefruit peel, floral notes. The flavor turns earthy, woodsy just before a super dry finish. Medium full mouthfeel is super soft and oily slick. Trend now is towards the big juicy NE IPAs, which I love, but it's nice to come back to this world class resiny bomb.

Smell is almost subdued for a double IPA. I get floral hops, grapefruit, with some pine and a little dankness. Very nice. The taste is a great blend of those hop characteristics with very little bitterness. Great balance. Damn, I am sold on this stuff. Definitely lives up to the hype for me. Wish I had another.",Russian River Brewing Company,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,100
863,7971,sittinggc,4.44,Poured into Teku glass and less than 2 weeks old.  Look: Clear golden color with a sticky white head. Good retention. Smell: Pine and grapefruit. Taste: Similar to the aroma with lots of pine and grapefruit. Hops are well supported by a nice malt presence. Though the malts compliment the hops and do not overpower. Nice bitterness. Feel: Smooth with a good level of carbonation.  Overall: Always a pleasure to knock back a pint of Pliny. Has earned its spot as one of the best IPAs around. Cheers!,Russian River Brewing Company,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,100
863,7971,anonymoose,4.25,"The beer comes in an amber color. The aroma is pretty muted with some pine, malt, and citrus coming through.

863,7971,erushing,4.33,"Probably the cleanest IPA or DIPA I've ever had. Similar reaction to the clean taste of a fresh Sculpin the first time I tried that. Very well balanced, very light drinking for a DIPA or 8%. Again, exceptionally smooth, clean and balanced and it's obviously very well made, but the hype is a bit much. For flavor, I'd still prefer Cafe Racer 15 for a DIPA, but they're just different styles of DIPAs. I personally prefer a bolder taste, but if you appreciate cleanness and balance, then I'm not sure how you could do better for this style of beer.",Russian River Brewing Company,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,100

Definite sweetness to the trail end of the smell. A tiny bit of alcohol. 5  Taste: Not as bitter as I expected at all, the hops come through, which leads into a citrus, then grapefruit with a slight taste of pineapple to finish the segment. The taste then shifts backs to hops, and the pine and resin come through in the aftertaste. For an 8% beer the alcohol is nearly undetectable. 5 (I'm a sucker for the hint of pineapple, very refreshing)  Feel: Very good mouth feel, crisp, not too much carbonation. 4.5  Overall: I am blown away by this beer, my favorite IPA up to this point has been the sculpin and I feel this is much much better. It appears once a month at the liquor store by my house and is limited to one per customer, so Ill be hunting for another. 4.75",Russian River Brewing Company,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,100

863,7971,ajm5108,4.6,"Nice medium lacing, gives an inviting visual to accompany the intoxicating aroma. Just waves of floral hops with a such a freshly squeezed vibrancy you'd think you were smelling it right off the vine. The taste is so smooth & elegant for an American IPA. This is the standard because they don't just toss massive amounts of hops in to hammer you with the flavor or the bitterness. You get a great sense and balance of the different hop flavors, so while it might not taste vastly different than many other great IPAs - your orange citrus, your grapefruit, your pine, etc - it is the balance and the ability of it to draw forth subtle hop variances to the surface that makes this such a well regarded beer. It is slick but not oily, lighter on carbonation than I expected and it has just a faint lingering bitterness but it never overpowers the palate.",Russian River Brewing Company,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,100

863,7971,Lucasballek,4.75,"Having had this a few times, I can say that this is best on draft. Bottles must remain fresh and cold for optimum flavor. It's always got a full nose, and the flavor is a great mix of refreshing, and bold. It takes the traditional Bitterness of an IPA, and glorifies it. It doesn't shy away from the bitter, rather leans into it.  Always good!",Russian River Brewing Company,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,100
863,7971,Dolphinsmarlins1,4.6,"Poured into a snifter glass, upon which a relatively thick head emerged. Fruity flavors on the front end that quickly get overpowered by the piney, resinous bite.

Malt provides a nice backbone and balances out the bitterness and resinous qualities of the hops quite a bit.

Flavor: A touch of malt with the predominant flavor being piney hops. Very well balanced. Great finish that stays with you just enough.  Mouthfeel: Not to heavy and not to light but just right.

Lacing is high and thick. SMELL: Strong aromas of piney hops meet strong aromas of apricots, peaches, mangos, papayas, tangerines, oranges, and grapefruits. Subtle sweet malts and bitter hops can also be detected. TASTE: Strong piney hop flavors enter initially along with mild sweet malts. Mild fruit flavors previously mentioned enter immiediately after along with strong bitter hop flavors as initial flavors persist. FEEL: Medium-bodied and subtly carbonated. Goes down extremely smooth. Finishes extremely dry. NOTE: Diss. A. Pointed... Way too bitter. Don't see what the hype was about. It was great, don't get me wrong. But this is not world-class worthy. Fruits were stronger in the aromas than the taste. Perhaps because the bottle wasn't THAT fresh (only 26 days old).

Little on the citrus side, just a little grapefruit rind. This is the father of all the floral, spicy and herbal dipas. Not too hoppy, and that's why perhaps you hear once in a while how this is very disappointing beer. There is a significant present of nice bready malts in here.  Appearance: Clear bright golden in color. Nice little white foamy head. Those bubbles are just so beautiful to watch. Has a nice carbonation for a dipa.  Taste: malty, sweet and bitter. Piney and spicy. Little herbal finish and nice little dryness. Wonderfull and complex.  Palate: The mouthfeel reminds me a lot of Blind Pig, very unique, and hard to articulate. Oily, sticky and very lively.  Overall: Pliny is unique. The mouthfeel, the carbonation, the spicy/herbal/piney notes here are unique.

863,7971,dd43,4.51,"Finally got my hands on a taste of Pliny after several years of hankering for it. Poured from a three week old bottle, which is about as fresh as you can get it on the east coast. This was an incredibly smooth imperial IPA, completely belying both the ABV and the bitterness/IPU number. Crystal clear filtered appearance, with a big hit of pine and bitter citrus peel on the nose. West coast IPA for sure. The malts supported the bitter finish and pine resin flavor notes, and the mouthfeel was superb with a level of carbonation that made this extremely drinkable and dare I say, refreshing. Pliny the Elder is famous for a reason, and imitator beers which try to ape its intoxicating blend of smoothness with hop bite are unlikely to touch it anytime soon.",Russian River Brewing Company,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,100
863,7971,tigerbeer90,4.37,"On tap at Toronado San Diego, kegged 1 week ago. This is my first time having pliny, after all the hype and searching I took a sip. It came out as a light golden pint, with a smell of pine and some fruit. It was a fragrant aroma, but not the best ever. With the first sip, I was instantly hit with the hop bitterness and pine notes, but it was very well balanced with the malts. The ending was extremely dry, leaving you begging for another sip. There is no doubt that this is a great IPA, but is it the best IPA I've ever had? I wouldn't say so. I think the hype and scarcity play a lot into this. I have waited almost 4 years to try this beer, and I would say I was a bit let down. As a bit of a comparison, upon my first time having Zombie Dust, I felt the hype was completely worth it. Now, before I am crucified on what I just said, this is in no way less than an excellent IPA. Everything from the hunt to the taste make this beer an experience, and the fact that with all the great IPAs currently on the market it can still be counted as a top 10 is extraordinary. If you ever have the chance to try a fresh PtE, take it and enjoy it for the quality and for what it has done for the craft beer world, a true legend.

Medium high carbonation was almost prickly on the tongue, but helped round out the mouthfeel of a beer that could have otherwise been a touch heavy.

So it's a wonderful start IPA, and as good an IPA as I could hope for, but it's a big commitment to call it the ""best.""  Both the nose and taste have a blast of citrus/grapefruit, which happens to be one of my favorite fruits so I love beers that taste that way. Admittedly, I have a sweet tooth for citrusy hops, but this beer is not really that sweet and it's hardly bitter at all - it's just crisp, tangy, zesty, and delicious. Not as complex as Heady either, which I think works to its advantage. Some beers do well with a complexity and plethora of flavors, but I think this one benefits from its straightforwardness. The minuscule amount of malt mostly serves to give this beer that thick, chewy texture I love in an IPA, and the 8% abv is so well masked, you could drink this all day until you realize you can't speak or stand properly.  Balanced, but has a clear sense of purpose, this beer is a perfect example of how to make a hoppy beer that doesn't rely on just having hops thrown at it until you're drowning in resin and bitterness. The main downside to this beer is twofold - first, that it's hype overshadows it's quality, and second, that it's historic value overshadows overall beer progress. As I said earlier, there are so many comparable, and much more accessible beers out there, that it's hard to justify going out of your way for this one for reasons besides curiosity. I have to take points off my score just because in this day and age, this is no longer a beer worthy of the exclusivity and prestige that it has cultivated. So bottom line, do whatever you can to drink it once and recognize it's majesty, and then go back to your other favorites.",Russian River Brewing Company,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,100

863,7971,MyThoughtsExactly,3.72,"Poured from a bottle three weeks old into a tulip glass. Look: Appears crystal golden and transparent. Aroma: Piny hop aroma with some sweet malt. Would like more citrus (I get a little orange) or even more pine. Kind of a disappointing nose. Taste: Fruit rine and pine. A little sweet malt. A good, balanced example of the west coast style. Feel: Medium to medium-low body. Overall, a good example of the west coast style and definitely balanaced as others have pointed out, but I was hoping for something more.

863,7971,JohnCassillo,5,"(can't believe I've never reviewed until now)  Sure, other beers have replicated what made it so hype-worthy, but it's still tough to top the original. It's bright, golden yellow and medium head are the ideal appearance for any West Coast IPA, and the insane floral and grapefruit notes are incredible -- especially so when poured fresh. Packed with citrus flavors and aroma, it's refreshing with a slight hoppy bitterness and you'd be hard-pressed to find a smoother drink (for an IPA) at this level ABV.",Russian River Brewing Company,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,100

The malts provide just enough support the citrus notes and clean but not overly bitter finish.  The grain bill shows its mastery in mouthfeel, too.

This is not to say that the brew is poor or subpar in any capacity, but it is just not the third best IPA in the world. Simply put: it is not the third best IPA in the world. It’s fucking good.

863,7971,Pray_For_Mojo,4.35,"Served on draft, poured into a pint glass.  Aroma: hops...pine and toasted malt. The hops are certainly present but not at such levels as to rape your olfactory.  Appearance: amber-gold and bright. Head topped out at one finger, which lasted the life of the beer, approx 30 min.  Flavor: piney hops and toasted malt. Despite the hoppiness, the toasted malt shares the stage. This beer is wonderfully balanced. The hop flavor is first on the scene but then yields to the toasted malt. Even in the finish, the beer maintains a wonderful balance of malt/hops. The toasted malt flavor reminds me of Stone's RuinTen. No off flavors whatsoever. No alcohol flavor.  Mouthfeel: medium, not so heavy as to prevent me from drinking several, but enough to carry the hops and abv.  Overall: a great beer. The best IIPA available? No, but one definitely worth pursuing. Just great balance. The beer is so smooth at 8.0%, well-balanced and conservatively hopped for a IIPA that this beer could pass for a standard IPA.

I've had it recently on draft at RR and picked up bottles while I was there as well.  The word that best describes Pliny is 'Balance'. It's just the right amount of malt base, with just the right amount of hop bitterness with a little juiciness like a DIPA should have. There's no question that PtE is expertly crafted.  That said, the smell and taste left me wanting something more. I like really juicy DIPAs. Heady Topper juicy. Hops you can smell from across the room juicy. If you're expecting Pliny to compete with a juicy, dank, citrusy double like Heady then you'll be disappointed.

Head is tight and retention is solid.  The only, slight, disappointment on this one is the nose seemed a bit weak to me. I feel like I remember more floral and pine scent but there's a bit of sweetness that comes through over it. The nose really is muted here for me with the malt far more present than on the palate.  Taste and feel are both perfect. For 100 IBUs you'd almost never guess it. I know some say this isn't supposed to be ""balanced"" but that's how I feel it comes across. The slight malt sweetness is present but the hop flavor profile is wonderful. It has a really great mouthfeel for DIPA - brash but awesome.  I know I'm not saying anything anyone else hasn't before but yeah, it's incredibly good.  Edit: Revisiting, added a couple notes but kept the scores the same.

863,7971,danpam1024,3.66,"Really? That's ""it""?  I've been a ""craft"" beer drinker for over 20 years. Back when it was cool to call yourself a ""micro brewery"" or more simply ""We make our own beer here in the back"" sort of pub. I've hunted beerz all over the east coast and Europe. I certainly do not profess myself as an expert, but I know the difference between new/exciting and old/tired.  I finally got out to the west coast (San Francisco) and my wife and I made an overt effort to make sure we could try The Elder before we left. Thanks to the incredible La Trappe Cafe, we found the supposive godfather of all IPAs. Needless to say, we were not too impressed.  Frankly, I believe it not the fault of Russian RIver, but more to the fact that today's brewers have caught up. Just two weeks ago, we were at (of all places...) Busch Gardens in Tampa Florida and we were served a ""Quackalope"" from a local brewery named ""Barley Mow"". Never heard of them, but this beer was incredible. To me, the folks at Barley Mow represents how far-along newers craft brewers have traveled towards great and updated tastes.  For those of you who consider themselves unsatiated until experiencing coveted beers such as Pliny the Elder, spend more time enjoying the selections of your local brewers.

863,7971,OGFGabv,4.86,"Definitely lives up to the hype. This beer is nothing less than exceptional. I am totally captivated by the nose, so much so, that I don't want to stop smelling it to take a sip! Grapefruit and Pine blend together perfect in harmony.

863,7971,TheDonster,5,"The first time I had this beer, I almost couldn't believe what I was smelling and tasting. I'm not sure you can really compare it to Heady, because they are entirely different beers. While Heady may be more easily drinkable, Pliny has more of a WOW! factor. I've had this on draft, and in a fresh bottle. Both were similar experiences.",Russian River Brewing Company,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,100
863,7971,Jason78,5,I had this beer on draft for the first time at a bar on 30th street in San Diego. It might be the best beer I have ever had. It definitely lives up to the hype. Awesome double IPA.

863,7971,Foggy_Memories_Beer,4.64,"Vessel: 16oz bottlepoured into a Russian River pint glass How it poured: Appearance : crystal clear, golden amber color. Tons of carbonation. Bright white, fluffy head. Smell/aroma: Super dank, piney, grapefruit, grapefruit pith. Very bitter, in your face hops. West Coast style at its finest. Taste: Upfront grapefruit bitterness, orange, pine, resinous, dank hops. Grapefruit rind, orange pith on the back end. Bitterness lingers, but the bready malts balance Pliny well. Overall: Pliny is a crowd pleaser. It is on point for a DIPA. Yes its worth tge hypr, get it fresh as you can. Everyone has their own tastes but from my POV this is a winner. Don't skip on the Blind Pig if your in the area as well!!",Russian River Brewing Company,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,100

Taste is fantastic and follows the nose. Some bready malt in the background and a huge, complex, balanced dose of hops: a dry, bitter finish with notes of orange, fir, and tropical fruits. Mouthfeel is great. Nicely carbonated, a bit of warming from the 8% alcohol. Overall, a fantastic double IPA.

863,7971,nheigelmann,4,"I liked pliney. I had some at the bar in santa rosa when i was in cali visiting. I bought a case to bring back to the house we were staying at. Blind pig was also very good. And they had another beer called Aud Blonde Ale that was really great. I will say though, i docked a couple points for two reasons. I dont think pliny is by far and away better than heady, larsons sip, or even sixpoint resin. Possibly my east coast taste buds prefer those brews. Also, there was a complete shitbag of a bartender working at the bar at RR. The other 3 or so bartenders were really cool and didnt have an ego stick shoved up their ass. This guy put a bit of a damper on my experience. He had an issue with me because i was a tourist, but he shut up after we engaged in great conversations with other attendees at the bar. Anyway, pliny is fucking good and they make some really good beers at RR. The food is excellent too. Sorry for the rant",Russian River Brewing Company,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,100

863,7971,ThisWangsChung,4.31,"HUGE thanks to aViewFromTheHOP for this one! 500ml bottle into a teku.  Appearance: Pours a gorgeous golden color. The head is three fingers high, and vaguely off-white in shade. Retention is fantastic, while the rocky head leaves behind thick webs of lacing on the glass. This one looks absolutely killer. (4.5)  Smell: This is a fairly typical DIPA aroma, all told. I can see where so many beers in the style got their influence from. Piny, grassy notes seem to dominate, though I do pick up hints of grapefruit. The malt backbone is wonderfully neutral - it brings touches of cracker and white bread, and that's about it. I admit gravitating more to the new school of DIPAs. But still, I'm not exactly disappointed by the nose by any stretch. (4)  Taste: At first, I get gentle hints of spruce, grass, and flowers. The more I drink, the more floral the flavor becomes. Malt appears past the midtaste (a bit more than the nose suggested), with some caramel, white bread, and sugar cookie flavors. Maybe even touches of earth, wood, and toffee. I could say that nothing about this brew really stands out...but I won't. No, every flavor here seems to pop with a bit more definition than MANY other DIPAs out there - and that's saying something considering how this is far more complex than the typical DIPA. (4.25)  Mouthfeel: This is amazingly crisp, and DRY (when I say dry, I mean frickin' dry). Some malt sweetness and heft does appear, but it's a feature that is less annoying than many others in the style. I could drink this one all day, that's for sure. I don't really notice the carbonation one way or the other - translation, it's doing its job perfectly. (4.75)  Overall: I knew this wouldn't be some super innovative, new school DIPA loaded with Galaxy hops. Nope, this is to DIPAs what Black Sabbath's self-titled album was to heavy metal. Even now, this has the finesse and sophistication that many in the style wished they had a tenth of. The first sip didn't bowl me over, and then I kept drinking it...and drinking it...and drinking it. Around the halfway mark, it dawned on me: ""this is a fantastic DIPA"". This isn't something you sample 3-4 oz of, this is something you down pint after pint of at the Toronado in SF, all while Dark Angel is blaring in the background (screaming match with surly bartender optional).

Really pleasant hop flavors without a big punch to the mouth. The finish is fairly clean, some hop character lingers.  M- medium body, creamy, perfect carbonation.  O- worth its reputation.

Beautiful orange/amber color with a finger of white head. Huge West Coast IIPA nose full of citrus (orange, lemon) and strong pine. Similar notes to taste, yet exceptionally pronounced. Opened up greatly as the brew was slowly sipped and savored. Clean, dry finish.

Taste is similar, tart, orange peel, with a pine finish. Great clean lingering pine finish.  Medium to medium low carbonation from the bottle. Had a couple pints at the source that seemed more carbonated. I preferred those. The slightly higher carbonation of the draft beer made the great hops flavor linger longer on the tongue.  Overall, for once, a beer mostly lived up to the hype. The best example of a west coast style IIPA I've ever had. Or any IIPA for that matter. One I will judge others off of.

T – A lot of hops, pine, woodsy, and low grapefruit. Intensely bitter, a significant hop snap comes in very quickly. A bit of orangey, lemon-lime zest. Grainy-malt sweetness, light bread crust, a touch of honey-like sweetness.  M – Moderate-low carbonation, medium-full in body.

863,7971,thorkelson,5,"This was my first rare/extremely exciting double IPA. I never reviewed it when I went out to the Santa Rosa brewery and experienced it for the first time. Oh, to go back again after having so many world class IIPAs like Heady, SoS, Trillium, Abrasive, etc. But drinking Pliny now reminds me why it is so highly regarded. To date, this is the most balanced and wonderful double IPA I have ever had. It has all the elements of a double that are done so well. There's no overwhelming malt liquor sting and the hop balance is so perfect. Ugh this is such a dream beer. I'll review it now that my uncle brought me back 6 bottles.  As I sit here in my girlfriend's coffee shop, I pour a 500ml bottle of pliny into my trillium tulip glass. Solid head, wonderful clean crisp yet hoppy citrus smell bursting out of the pour, the head retention is so perfect. Creamy, holds up very nicely. First sip is so nice, unlike NE hops, it's not overwhelmingly hoppy on the nose, it takes its sweet time. Finishes clean, crisp, bitter and dank, resinous yet somehow a bit dry. From start to finish this beer is a doggone treat.  I keep thinking I want to send a thank you note to Russian River for making this beer and introducing me to the world of what beer CAN be.

Straight from that lovely golden pour, the most delicious aromas emanated from the glass. Tropical fruits, malty sweetness, citric, resiny and piney hops, floral esters...it had it all! I was inhaling with gusto! What a delicious taste! A hop bomb with perhaps the greatest hops to malt balance ever. So complex; fruity, bready, piny, hoppy. A strong grapefruit and resiny hops finish. What a mouthfeel! I could swirl it in my mouth all day long. I'm so sad to have finished my 3 bottles. I am still dreaming of the taste and hope to feel it again soon.

A hint of grapefruit. T: The sweet maltiness is evident upon first sip, but it slowly transitions into a nice smooth finish of pine and grapefruit notes. Seems to taste very earthy and fresh. M: Medium carbonation with slight bitterness. The hops are somewhat prickly to the tongue. Well balanced DIPA. O: I finally landed the elusive PLINY!!!! I can check it off of my list!

The taste is a nice mix of pine and citrus with a good hop bite and it goes down pretty easily. I just think the hype has convinced people it’s better than it is.

Citrus, and pine are present from the first smell to the last the sip, thank you Russian River",Russian River Brewing Company,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,100
863,7971,YeahRightt,4.86,"Poured into DFH IPA glass  Look: Surprisingly pale orange with a bit of haziness, double finger head with a crazy amount of lacing.  Smell: Delicious. Pineapple, orange, pine, and earthiness. Booze is there, but hiding behind the hops.  Taste: The most interesting part of this beer is how the first sip throws you off. Its so easy drinking and sustained that it seems at first that you were let down, but you slowly realize the depth behind what just occurred. Its like walking past a beautiful piece of art and having to stop, go back, and really see what its intricacies were. The hops hit immediately and are sharp, a good adjective for this beer throughout the entire sip would be that very same adjective: sharp. A clean taste of orange and pineapple are present throughout but are never striking. I know that the word ""balanced"" is thrown around a lot on this website, but this beer is the epitome of balance. There is nothing that hits you over the head, but it remains extremely complex, delicious, drinkable, and clean. It is refreshing beyond any IPA I have ever had by a long shot, and its piney nature is like a drop in a sea of singular drops of fruit and earthiness. Delicious.  Feel: Pretty thin for a double IPA, but thats the way this beer needed to be. Its crisp, sharp, refreshing flavors are perfectly congruent with the slightly oily, light, and drinkable nature of this brew.  Overall: An apt metaphor for this beer would be as lengthily and complex as the beer itself is. This beer has some considerable hype backing it up, which could sway some opinions, but it should always be handled for what it is. What it is happens to be the most balanced, and drinkable double IPA of all time. It may not be the best 2xIPA of all time, but I have yet to have any brew in the style that comes even close to the drinkability and balance of this beer. This beer needs to be found and enjoyed by any person who enjoys the style, because they will then know what the term ""double IPA"" truly means.",Russian River Brewing Company,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,100

Light orange almost honey in color with a pretty solid frothy head that dissipates to a bubbly cap on top. Streaks of lacing transform to spotty in nature all the way down the glass edges. The aroma of pine, resin, citrus, and floral hops is rather subdued with nothing too overpowering. Flavor profile for this Imperial IPA is quite delicious. The pine and resin start off the flavors with a very nice grapefruit taste finishing the profile. Solid bodied and only a slight bitterness on the back end of the palate with a nice creamy mouthfeel.

That was prior to me getting in to the ""craft beer craze"" and trying many more different Double IPAs (and even Triple) over the past 3 months (late bloomer i know). My palate has adjusted a bit. While I still sense the pine, its not nearly as strong and now i taste a little resin on finish. It is incredibly smooth to mefor 8%, which actually is fairly moderate these days for a Double IPA. Perfect balance to me of hops/malt. Hard to find, but lucky my local place has it and can find bottles if i get to my liquor store early enough.

863,7971,1sophrosyne1,4.32,"Poured from a lovingly shipped aliquot (thank you MNishCT77) born on 021115 into IPA glasses and enjoyed in both sips and gulps over 30 minutes.  It fills a lustrous golden base with stinging clarity and ample lines of rising carbonation. Those bubbles feed a white head of soap suds that hangs on nicely, maintaining frothy clumps down to nearly the last sip. Lacing is pretty, but finer than the cap would predict.  The nose is surprisingly mute--not unpleasant at all. But dank and toasty in a way that mutes the expected fruits and evergreens. There's even a touch of musty, fermenting earth under the pineapple, mango, and dried spruce. With warmth, the bouquet gets a little more interesting with some apricot and unripe raspberry notes.  Flavors are so intricately woven together and shrouded in a thin coat of barley, that nothing stands out here either. It's a testament to expert craftsmanship, but also lacks compelling taste -- I find myself reaching for another sip and another and another looking for the flavors I thought would jump over my teeth. This creation does leave room for a nice note of sweet soil and organic hen blend, though. After a bitter beginning that is cut short by the feel of bubbles, there's a breadfruit and mango essence that slides across pithy citrus into just the right amount of hop twang and funk. But then, there isn't much to follow apart from a nutty chew that's part of extended length that offers only flavor suggestions in an almost watery watermelon and guava quench. Papaya comes out when it's warm. Bigger gulps offer more compelling hits of flavor and there is more fruit clinging to the yeast in the bottom, but man would it take a lot of drinking to enjoy it that way...  The mouthfeel absolutely tops the list of elements here. It feels so good to keep drinking and playing with, despite my yearning for more intense flavor. It appears to have more carbonation than it delivers; and that's just right for the light but clingy hop oils and muted earthiness. Those bubbles bring out a hint of spice mid-palate that helps it go with food (enjoyed my pork BBQ)--but this may be the easiest drinking double I've ever had because of how it lays out over the tongue and slides down.  This beer is remarkably assembled. I find it downright soft and buoyant, and there's nothing out of balance. Sadly, though, I find the lack of seams and absence of powerful flavors a bit disappointing. It lacks character, even though I appreciate just how technically sound it is. It's like listening to finely filtered Kenny G piped into an art gallery instead of John Coltrane live. I might pick up that album and listen again and again to marvel at the technique, but I'd really rather be in the smoke and sweat of a jazz club, even if going back means it won't ever be the same twice.",Russian River Brewing Company,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,100

While you are not a bad beer by any means, in fact, I would drink you far more often if the craft beer hipsters did not hoard you and if bottle shops would not gouge your price and/or hide you 'in the back'.  Pliny is probably the most balanced DIPA I've ever had. Drinks incredibly smooth for an 8% IPA. You get your nice hop aromas/flavor while being perfectly complimented by the malt profile.

The lace transcribed into Wachowski-bros-Matrix-title-sequence-like movement frozen into a Pangea by a Zack Morris timeout. The smell is starfruit and pomegranate mixed with a freshly opened pack of Upper Deck baseball cards.

They arrived well packed and cold, so I don't think mishandling is involved. My first impression: this is such an average feeling DIPA in 2015. Sean Lawson was brewing this same beer a decade ago in his shed. It is relatively clean, smooth and true to IPA form. But that standard sailed a half decade ago, at least in New England.

Smell was incredible, with an overall pungent floral smell with obvious hops and pine. Taste was a fresh, crisp fruity tartness, reminiscent of grapefruit. Perfectly astringent, with a slight but not overpowering pucker. Finish was a slow build of bitterness that progressed, but finished asymptotically smooth. Definite presence of pine and resin.

I was expecting a more pungent whiff of hops effervescing from the lip, but subtlety works well  The taste is just what an IPA should be: crisp, hoppy bold citrus flavor with notes of pine and grapefruit.

Exceptional clarity that rivals the most clear DIPA's I have ever tried. Moderate amount of carbonation bubbles. a most wonderful presentation of a beer.  S: A strong citrus, grapefruit, pine and Pineapple notes. I distinctly smell the aroma of the Simcoe hops in the forefront.  T: Very smooth with strong grapefruit and pine. Tastes exactly like it's scent. Extrodinarily juicy and lipsmaking hoppy. Nice malty backbone but does not overpower the hop forward flavors. Alcohol is hidden, The finish is extremely bitter and piney with a biting bitterness that hangs around and leaves you with the hoppy cottonmouth feel.  M: Medium body with moderate carbonation, very creamy and very dry on the finish.  Overall - This ranks as one of, if the the best DIPA I have ever had. After every sip until the very end, as the beer settled back into the glass, a wave of carbonation erupted into new foam that only improved the head in my glass.

S: Floral and piney  T: Exceptional. The first sip might have been the best sip of beer I've ever had and reminded why people love this so much. So crisp with just the right amount of bite. Perfect mix of piney, floral and citrus. Drinking as fresh as possible really makes a huge difference with this one.  F: Light and crisp  O: Definitely deserves all the accolades especially when consumed at the brewery. Bought a case to take with me. The first one consumed the next day tasted just as good as it did on tap, but I noticed my enjoyment slowly diminish with each one. Took about 3 or 4 weeks to drink all of them. Again, kind of a no brainer, but try to drink as fresh as possible. Some IPAs can sit a few weeks and you hardly notice a difference in taste. This is not one of them.

L: Golden brown, much lighter than a lot of ipa's I've had, BEAUTIFUL retention, perfect, I will compare all other ipa's to the stickiness of this beer's appearance.  S: Fantastic aroma, exactly what I look for in this style, citrus, pine, the works, since they are of very similar rank I will compare it to heady, not quite as dank but similar aroma nonetheless.  T: And I'm done. This is as good as it gets. There's a beautiful dryness to it like no other beer I've experienced, one that can only be found in a brew of this caliber. The flavors are nothing to speak of, if you've had a west coast ipa you know the flavors. What sets this beer apart is the smooth drinkability for such a big dry brew that you can only wish was more common.  M: Light, not very malty at all. Comparing to heady again it's much more dry and not as sweet, but trust me malt heads, this is not a bad thing.  O: One of the best beers I've ever had the pleasure of dissecting, it wasn't easy and I still don't think I fully accomplished it. Dry, palate cleansing, each sip prepares you for the next.

A - Perfect golden orange color. Very clear like it was bottled in the middle of the bright tank with a fluffy coarse white head and great lacing.  S - The most hop fragrance I've ever experienced in a beer! Tons of dankness and grapefruit just bursting out of the glass. As I poured it I could almost see the amount of aromatics coming off of this beer. There is some orange, pine, and herbal all to accompany the west coast hops. This truly is the most quintessential West-Coast DIPA.  T - Lots of hop flavor coming out of this one. Mostly the grapefruit and then the dank herbal character of the hops come across the palate. There is also a lot of pine, other citrus fruit, and a light floral tone that really make this beer shine. There is some malt but it is very light and no alcohol to be found. The bitterness is cascades throughout the flavor but never ravaging your tongue and only accentuates the hop character instead of lowering the flavor. It is very clean through out which I feel was somewhat of a sacrifice for flavor.  M - Medium mouth-feel with medium carbonation. It is definitely going for lots of flavor with lots of drinkability which it achieves but I know that they could have squeezed more flavor if it wouldn't have been so crisp and clean.  Overall, this is the most perfect example of a West-Coast DIPA and is an amazing beer. I can fully understand why so many people would be in love with Pliny but it is not the most flavorful DIPA ever. It has an incredible amount of aroma, a beautiful appearance, and great taste but could be even bigger and more hops. I would still strongly recommend this beer but probably isn't worth flying clear out to Cali for.

863,7971,brewqueno,4.35,"This is a good all around IPA/DIPA. I was lucky enough to give it a try last night and can't complain. Great aroma, nice color, feel... well balanced... almost perfection. Flavor is the only issue. It seems watered down in comparison to what I'm used to drinking - all the AIPA flavors are there, but it's all very subtle. Nothing overpowers, which is good, but when I grab an IPA, I'm looking for that hoppy wow factor and this just doesn't have it. That may be why it's so appealing to others, and if I wasn't big on IPAs, I'd probably make this my first choice. I think in the category of beer (in general), this is definitely a 5; but in the DIPA category, it's lacking....",Russian River Brewing Company,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,100

This beer did not cause me to stand up and cheer, nothing crazy in terms of smell or taste, but it is absolutely flawless in its delivery. Looks exactly the way a IIPA should, nice beautiful golden with a small head. Smells are west coast 101--pine and grapefruits. Bitter as hell on the palate, but the balance is incredible, leaves you dry and ready for another sip. So glad I had this beer. Would I go crazy to get it again? No, probably not.

Appearance: Pours thick nice pillowy head that lingers throughout the drinking of this one. Fairly light in color for a DIPA, more golden and pilsner-like, in the appearance.  Nose: Bready malts in there, some floral components but not as pungent as one would expect. Its fairly faint for the style  Taste: Very mild and light for an IPA, you can tell this one is very well made, but in the world of brutal IPA’s and DIPA’s this is not one of them. Its sweet but not overly so, its smooth on the tongue, but it has a bite on the back, but not assertive at all. Floral comes to mind, it is not as much piney as it has more of a tropical fruit flavor in there almost like you would find close to the peel of a mango.  Overall: Super enjoyable for the type of beer. I have had a lot of IPA’s over the years and this one is definitely different. Its similar but not like the rest either.

Amazingly clear gold with a bit red, a fine bubbled slightly off-white foam that has good stability and leaves lacing classic American hops aroma, grapefruit, citric and more and more pine, not in anyway pungent, compared to more modern IPAs it is gently and got nothing to hide not even the tiny alcoholic note fruity hops, again pine and grapefruit rather than citric and then lingering bitterness, and then even more bitterness, it comes back in waves. Almost no caramel malt too balance, more balance from the alcohol in my opinion The body is below medium, the carbonation is well integrated and spot on, the alcohol gives just the warming that reminds you that you are drinking a potent beer, little hop astringency.

863,7971,Twerp28,4.25,"It’s my smashingly good fortune to have a somewhat nefarious pipeline to this Elder concoction. Lacourt, my unwavering old sommelier was the first to acquire this grog on behalf of the estate; I’m assured at an utterly pedestrian price to boot! Of course, Monsieur Lacourt is accustomed to somewhat less modest orders of fine wines of sundry provenance, however my dear nephew Henry was visiting for a fortnight and much to my displeasure the poor boy imbibes not in wine or spirits, but solely that grain infusion of the tiresome hoards.  Nevertheless, I remain dogged in my appraisals. I shall persevere therefore in the format of those less fortunate.  The brew arrived in a hand-blown Thurgau crystal Burgundy goblet, one of the army I had purchased in a wholly impulsive transaction on business in Zurich. (Resolved from reviews past, I judge the caliber of the vessel has at least some measure of effect on the most vulgar liquid that unfortunately fills it. How utterly infantile is this foray on which I am embarking?)  Naturally, this copper fluid was retrieved from a bottle rather than a tap. I shudder at the thought of – as they say, “knocking back,” with the bitter, plebian masses. Lacourt tells me the barmen are clothed in mechanics jumpers! To think - I wouldn’t know whether to hand them the keys to my Quattroporte or to request an ale?  At any rate, the dubious nectar radiates the hue of the Calais sun making it’s Atlantic retreat. It wears a pale lather of effervescence (not unlike the fodder of resident scum the Calais harbor is known for.) Bawdy and sloth in it’s vigor, yet noteworthy in it’s persistence. A beguiling mousse in the most bizarre manner.  At this point I’ll have the reader know, I am not an absolute neophyte. I’ve had the displeasure of consuming numerous “craft beers,” in a downright economic, albeit somewhat self-serving, pursuit. I’ve closed many a rowdy account with the various Dallas oil barons over a Hopsmash, or whatever they’re called. I assure you I can never “hop” out of these vile summits soon enough. As a refinement of experience, I was heartily expecting this Pliny dribble to no sooner see it’s way to the drain than the amuse-bouche had ventured onto our table.  To the parties amusement, our aperitif was not the absolute abomination I had predicted. Indeed, the peculiar beverage lacks the finesse of the well-healed malts of Belgium, the quaff of which I became so fond as an adolescent student in Bruxelles. I suppose one must give this attempt it’s due, one mustn’t judge Americans by the exemplar of the old world. Like Hemmingway or Whistler, this libation remains charming despite it’s awkward proportions. It retains a sort of harmony despite its underprivileged poise, like a spindly, young girl learning Chopin.  At any rate, a bouquet of a warm Valencian citrus emanated from my goblet, pursued by an unmistakable musk of saturated pine forest. A time back I had kept a small bungalow just north of Bodega. After a light rainshower the decomposing floor would relinquish it’s hearty aroma; for a fleeting moment the saline winds would dance with the bucolic redolence of the earth, then, like a forsaken liaison the delicate perfume would evanesce leaving only a phantom of memory to the consciousness.  Regardless of my soliloquy, the palette continues the impetus grace. Lacking in nuance and feminine elegance. The liquor is bold and unapologetic like Tchaikovsky’s overture. One can hardly expect anything but an arrogant ostentation from the colonials, yet the nectar calls for another dram like a fine young Barolo. Madame Heathcourt thought it a ""Queer yet delightful refreshment."" (However, one must remember the Madame's taste for aesthetics has been weathered by two decades of appointment in Bombay, not to mention her Irish provenance.)  I suppose at this point, one would give this consumable a numerical grade, as if a pleasure can be quantified by a thing as banal as numerics! I forsee the day when great ale houses are brought to their knees and domesticated by the uneducated serfs. Look what that odious lawyer, Mr. Parker, has done to the great Chateux with his trifling little periodical. You will rue the day when the unshaven hoards become the arbiter of beauty.  However if I must – four and a quarter.",Russian River Brewing Company,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,100

This is my third time having this beer, and this really is a holy grail of Double IPAs. Poured out of a 16 oz bottle into my tulip glass, this beer pours a very clear, surprisingly clear I'd say, light to medium golden color with steady streams of lots of little bubbles rising tot eh top of the glass. Has a nice white head about 1/3 of an inch thick when first poured that eventually settles to a solid 1/5 of an inch with good retention. Good lacing here too. Fresh aromas of grapefruit/citrus, earthy, floral, and piney hops all packed in here nicely. Followed by some other fruity notes, but the hops sure dominate. Flavor wise there is almost no caramel malty sweetness, this beer is certainly dominated by citrus/grapefruit, earth, floral, and piney hop flavors. This beer is not overly bitter though. Each different aforementioned aspect of the hop flavors stand out from each other while yet also somehow intertwining and blending together so elegantly. Truly a unique flavor profile that is just down damn right delicious! Has a medium to full bodied crisp, somewhat prickly, resiny, yet smooth and slightly frothy mouthfeel with moderate carbonation. Drinkability is so easy and superb. You really just want to keep drinking the hell out of this and you wish that your glass was never ending. WOW!!!

Lots of grain character. A bit of citrus, like grapefruit, but mainly malt with some green hops.  Tastes like it smells. A lot of subtley bitter, piney/floraly hops with some citrus almost hidden in there. Grapefruit, mango, and a touch of pineapple. Very clean, distinct grain flavor. Like chewing on barley. I get a lot of wheat bread and slightly sweet caramel. The balance is damn near perfect.  Speaking of perfect, the body is so soft, airy/delicate. I could enjoy this without tasting it.

This could easily be called ""Piny"" the Elder as it is distinctly a piny IPA ... a very good piny, resinous IPA.

I still love Pliny, but I love pliny for what it is, a well made DIPA at a great price point, not because of marketing tactics or review sites such as BA. Batches vary, imo, I've had amazing batches and highly acidic/astringent batches, all within a month of bottling date. Try it, but don't jump on the hype train.

863,7971,aleigator,4.3,"Bottle from Lothore, thank you very much Tyler!  Pours a golden-amber hue, with a decent head, leaving a thin lacing. This beer smells wonderfull, as it is defined by intriguing aromas of grassy, fresh hops, along with oily pine, earthy malts and fruity papaya notes. As complex as the aromas are, the nose of this beer is very much hop centered, in a gentle, well balanced way - and I love it. As I had my first sample at the Cantillon Quintessence, I actually didn’t want to drink the beer at the first moment, because I never had experienced such great aromas so far.  Almost dough, smooth beginning with oily, wooden flavors of pine, until the hops become recognizable. In an impressive way. They deliver a fantastic grassy bitterness which gets coated up by wooden malts and pleasant, warm oak. Hops define the taste of this beer, without washing away any of the supporting, complex flavors. This allows a multi-layered depth on the palate, which results in a long, dry aftertaste, as hops take over in the end. Citrus peel, kiwi and lime add crispy, fruity hints to the hop impression, altough they don’t stand out too far on their own, but line up with the more present floral and herbal notes. The most pleasant thing about this Double-IPA is its perfect balance. While it is in fact very hoppy, nothing sticks out too much, nothing distracts from the unique complexity, very well done.",Russian River Brewing Company,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,100
863,7971,Erockruns,4.95,"First experience with this legend. Had on tap in Hollywood over the weekend and it matched the hype. A memorable experience indeed. Was much clearer than I had anticipated. Was expecting a hazy glow after drinking so many DIPAs with that profile.  The pine aroma was immediate and a pleasant surprise. Spectacular citrus-hop-piney balance and like many reviewers have said, the easiest drinking DIPA in existence that I'm aware of. The smoothness reminds me a lot of Lawson's Finest Liquids DIPAs but has even less of a bitter tickle. It's really amazing how smooth and balanced this beer is. I can certainly see why this is arguably the best DIPA in the world. Well worth the effort to find and having had Heady, Lawson's and others like Trillium, Tree House and Foley Bros.; Pliny deserves its due near the very top of everyone's list.

Hype can really kill things for me. As it poured I was struck by the honey color. Beautiful. 1.5 finger white head. The aroma was very pineapple-y. I took my first sip, and was completely blown away.

Great aroma but not as pronounced as expected. Taste is an amazing isolation of citrus hop flavor. Grapefruit, orange and tangerine in a wave of hop driven flavor with a perfect level of caramel sweetness to keep it in check. Not overly bitter which allows all that hop flavor to come through.

Pours a lovely golden yellow, slightly hazy with a big bountiful head. Aromas are off the charts with a lovely hoppy nose, not much else to be noted. Citrus, pine, earthy smells all converge at once, balanced and not overwhelming.  First taste is very surprisingly smooth. Overall, just very smooth. Hops at the front and back with just enough malt backbone to keep it in control. For the ABV it doesn't give it away. Doesn't drink like a 8%. Very smooth. Lovely mouthfeel. Just right really. It just feels good from beginning to end. Finishes crisp and smooth and a bit heavy.  Not a session beer. Begs to be savored mouthful after mouthful. Almost drinks itself as you have to process each swallow and savor it. Would be a waste to drink a bottle in under 25 minutes!  Amazing beer.

One of the most beautiful beers I've seen.  Aromas are huge piney hops, citrus - and the malt base sneaks in to make an appearance. This is gonna be great.  The taste is heavy piney hops, with the requisite resin to stick to your palate, a significant citrus component, and the rich malt base to balance this perfectly, to the point that you're pounding an 8.0% ABV beer and wondering where the alcohol is.  This beer receives rave reviews (this is another), and there's a reason - it's a perfect example of a big, West Coast-style DIPA.

Looks great in the glass with a nice fluffy head, mostly small bubbles with some larger ones peppered in. Nice and clear, it looks like this is going to be a hell of a refreshing brew.  Everything about the way this beer smells screams 'Get in my belly'. Hoppy, grape-fruity, lovely. Very inviting, and I admit my mouth is watering. Here it goes.  Wonderful hoppiness hits me at the front, malt cleans it up nicely but leaves a lingering bitterness that brings about the next sip. No sense of the 8% at all. Dangerously delicious.  In the mouth, the beer is just thick enough to coat your tongue and nail every taste bud. Swallowing clears it all out, and you can't help but crave the next sip. This stuff is great.  I really don't have anything bad to say about this beer. My overall impression is that I need to have this in my fridge at all times. Who knows when you're going to wake up thirsty at 3am!

S: Citrus and tropical fruit hops, pineapple mango and orange, pine, and sweet malt. I would use this as cologne if I could.  T: Big citrus and tropical fruit hop hit, orange and grapefruit stand out with a little mango and pineapple in there as well, some floral and pine notes, all held together with a solid malt backbone with a touch of caramel sweetness, and a nice grapefruit and pine bitterness that lingers on the finish.

863,7971,joaopmgoncalves,5,"Taken from my Moleskine.  Notes: this Pliny was not perfectly fresh when I drank it. It took almost 1 month to get to my mouth since it left USA.  I never had such an anticipated beer as this one. The excitement that went through my veins reached its peak when I opened this bottle. A strong smell of passionfruit got out of the bottle. And as soon as I poured it over to the glass, that same smell was all over the room. Meanwhile, a closer appreciation of the aroma revealed a less expressive passionfruit where there was now space for a mix of citric notes, pineapple and pine.  In appearance wise, it has a super cristal clear body. A nice yellow-orange-y color and white foam that almost lost all of it strength but it always there during the tasting, with some lacing as well.  In terms of taste, I couldn't be more excited than this: it was indescribable. The passionfruit was there, the orange was there, the pineapple was substituted by peach and the pine was all dressed up as resin notes that were felt in the strong kick of malt and hops. Yet, the best part was when I felt the power of the 100 IBUs that Pliny The Elder has in itself. What an amazing thing. All this bitterness was almost orgasmical. Perfect.  Yet, being the best beer I've had until today, it wasn't perfect. Maybe it's because of the spent in its journey to the other side of the Atlantic. The flavor and the bitterness didn't go very well. The transition was hard and it was only given by the resin notes and the hop flavor. I was hoping a bit more in this taste to mouthfeel transition.",Russian River Brewing Company,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,100

They are very well utilized, nothing getting in the way of their orange, lemon, pine, grapefruit flavors. That also mean, however, that there isn't any malt to counter it, so that means a very unbalanced beer, leaving a very bitter bite on the finish and your palate left wandering for any refuge of flavor besides the onslaught of hops. Good obfuscation of the alcohol content as well.  M: Good acidity, thick, effervescent. The creamy foamy head balances the rest of the body nicely.  O: A hopbomb, the real deal. Fresh, dank hops compose the entirety of this beer. Their projected image is done well, but unfortunately, with so many other beers that also utilize such fresh hops in such quantities, the name is one of the only thing that sets this one apart from the crowd. Maybe if I had a better hop palate I'd be able to more fully appreciate what they've done, but as it is, it's just another refreshing DIPA, albeit done very well.",Russian River Brewing Company,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,100

863,7971,WillHops,4.5,"I can't recall having a more well balanced beer of any sort, and for a DIPA, this seems to be the Holy Grail that the most celebrated brewers in the world have given up on achieving. The head is a beautifully sturdy frothy topping sitting a good 2 fingers above a gorgeous deep golden colored beer. The aroma of grapefruit and pine blend with a faint floral scent so harmoniously refreshing that the aroma alone could be marketed as a cologne by itself. The cleanliness of the malt is more akin in drinkability to an American Pale Ale and I have to remind myself that this is actually a DIPA!?! WOW Pure Magic!  In retrospect, after the excitement of having tasted one of the most sought after beers in the world... it's certainly not the BEST beer, best IPA, or even the best DIPA I've ever had. In fact, it reminds me so much of a Sierra Nevada Pale Ale that it reminded me just how good SN really is. The fact that a SN APA has never been an extremely difficult beer to acquire leaves me in awe that Sierra Nevada has been able to produce such a high quality beer & distribute it in such a capacity that I'm never left wanting for a great beer wherever I travel.  While Pliny The Elder is certainly a Stylistically perfect beer, but it lacks any true uniqueness or excitement that makes my brain giggle (this is the best way I can describe the feeling I get when I have something truly amazing)",Russian River Brewing Company,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,100

I have been let down by so many hyped beers (ipa's especially) like all of dogfish beers, Stone beers like Vertical epic, The abyss.....etc... This beer has upheld its long reputation. Most IPA's have to much weird citrus, earthy bitterness, or are to malty sweet, etc. Pliny has all the hop flavors I enjoy like sharp citrus, grapefruit, fruity, sticky resinous pine but all in a harmonious marriage of pale and copper malts. As IPAs get bigger and ""better"" I find that higher abv seems to equal sweeter. Pliny is a great balance of hops and malt, not overly sweet or overly hopped.",Russian River Brewing Company,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,100

Felt like chasing around a goddamn ghost just to get ahold of 2 bottles of the stuff, which I had to leave work early to buy separately from 2 separate stores! The guy behind the counter at Mr. Kegs said that less deliveries are coming down from Russian River because it's even more in demand than ever before, they don't accept new delivery contracts from retailers, and RR is producing less of their high-demand limited beers like PTE, PTY and Blind Pig because they are trying to be conscious of the drought in CA. UGH, DAMN DROUGHT, YOU RUIN EVERYTHING.  Today's lesson: DRAUGHT > DROUGHT  Anyhow, if you can find this darn evasive beer somewhere, leave your desk chair and cubicle and go get it now. It's fantastic all the way around, very dry and very complex taste profile, hops are evident and enjoyable, the beer hides its booziness pretty well too, which is nice. Just like the label says, don't sit on this beer, drink that baby right away (sub it out for your morning coffee if you have to) and remind yourself, you're a lucky sonofabitch to have even gotten ahold of a single bottle of it, LIFE'S GOOD.",Russian River Brewing Company,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,100

Pours a crystal clear amber with short head that leaves a bubbly slick as it dies down. Nose on this is out of control - super citric orange peel and tropical fruit mixed with a soft floral aroma. Taste is solid all the way through, you get a quick bite up front, some spice and citrus in the middle and a lingering resiny bitterness on the back end; this beer hits it all. The alcohol at 8% is barely noticeable, but does leave you with a nice warming sensation in the belly. Mouthfeel is medium with a delicate champagne like carbonation. Overall I think this is a great West Coast IIPA, but I prefer a little more malt balance, and I'd say FW Union Jack is comparable if you can't find this.

I picked up a bright fruitiness, lots of hops, and some light pine. When I had Pliny on draft, I noticed a thick aroma of pine resin. 4.25  T: Just delicious. Dominant flavors for me are pine, citrus, and dank, sticky hops. There's a light sweetness underneath those flavors that makes this endlessly drinkable. Huge bitter finish. 4.75.  M: Feels light but tastes like it's jam-packed full of flavor. 4.75  O: A fantastic beer, though not best in show in the DIPA category.

The taste was the best part. It reminded me of Sucks but there was more to it with some effervescence on the tongue that was reminiscent of Heady Topper.

Notes of very sweet/juicy orange, pineapple, and fresh flowers. Possibly a hint of grapefruit or pine.  Taste features much more grapefruit with a touch of floral pine, but this is mostly on the finish. Up front, this is a super juicy, sweet, and tropical citrus bomb with an unusual flowery character. More sweet and juicy than piney; just the right amount of resinous character to balance this out and still be true to the west-coast style.  Very smooth, medium-light body. Slightly oily, with a subtle amount of dryness from the resin and yeast character.",Russian River Brewing Company,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,100
863,7971,acread,4.02,"I have to say that even though this is clearly a really good beer, it's not without equal. In fact, I would argue that these days it has many equals. The strong bitterness of the hop profile is a little harsh and detracts ever-so-slightly from appreciating the nuances encompassed within the rest of the experience on the palate. The huge pine notes intermingled with citrus and hints of grass and tropical fruit are wonderful when detectable, though. Also, the malt profile does the beer no favors. The slight sourdough notes and marginally excessive maltiness again detract a little from the overall experience. Frankly, my favorite part of the Pliny experience is the aroma, which is amazing and unimpeachable. I know I'm splitting hairs and will gladly acknowledge that this beer is fantastic, but I just don't think it's worth the hype.",Russian River Brewing Company,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,100

T: Does not stray too far away from the nose profile, like a reliable wing man, backing up ya boy and make him look good. Getting no surprise here. Piney, a bit malty sweetness, dry bitter finish, like a good bottle of aged red wine.

Hops, grain, malt.. they finely crafted this one in every sense of the word. Head was a little light, but tight foams. Mouthfeel was very good for the hops which blended perfectly. finish was smooth. Is it the best beer in America? Um... no. Very very good, I would have it again and was able to buy a couple of bottles at a nearby store (2 bottle limit), but does it live up to the hype? Nope. The marketing strategy (and the limits on purchase) were brilliant and they have feed into the hype very well.... being from Utah it was my mission (pun intended) to find this beer and see for myself.. but honestly..

Again, very fresh smelling.  The nose didn't lie. This isn't an overly citrus nor an overly piney hop bomb. It is what occurs when everything is balanced. Nothing jumps out and blows you up. It's just a very easy drinking, beautiful hoppy lovefest. The thing that separates this beer from its imitators and competitors is that you really want to drink the hell out of it, not just taste it over and over because it's good.  Mouthful is nice, not too resiny, and malt is clean and fresh. As soon as you swallow it, your mouth needs a refill. Just balance.  Somehow the hype matched the eexperience.

Even the bottle cap smells like delicious hops  The first sip is ""wow"" smooth. Grapefruit and pineapple -- hello, citrus -- are predominant, and the earthy, forest-floor flavors that you get from some IPAs, even good ones, are absent. I expected balanced and bitter, but I didn't expect the mouthfeel to be so light. For an IPA of 8 percent and around 100 IBUs, this is just about perfect.

Here in South CA we can only buy one bottle at a time and when its on tap there a bunch of people waiting for it.  I didn't want to be one of those guys that must try it cause its the thing to do.  Well let me just say this. Its about as close as a beer can be to perfect.  It pours a nice color golden color plenty of head and beautiful lacing looks like my grandmas curtains!!  Now that aroma, just a cool clean piny scent with the right amount of grapefruit and those Hops. And the taste is just as good as you will get from any beer in the style. So complex yet so balance with the perfect finish slightly bitter but in the best way possible. It hate to admit there is validity to all that hype. Its well worth the trip to North CA to get a few cases.  Cheers",Russian River Brewing Company,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,100
863,7971,bol3by,4.84,"Lighter in color (almost lager-esque) than most ales, particularly IPAs; refreshing, floral aroma; VERY drinkable for an IPA, smooth, bitter notes appearing later; slightly more carbonated feel.

863,7971,Kustom01,4.45,Great Double IPA... it's hype is well earned.. only wish i had a steady supply of them. haha. I had this on my trip to the brewery while visiting San Fran.. was worth the trip up there to santa rosa.. the flight at the brewery is insane 16+ beers.. they make a lot of good stuff.. hope to get back there soon.. highly recommend trying this beer if you can get a trade for it or get up there yourself to visit.,Russian River Brewing Company,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,100

S- distinct tropical aromas consisting of pineapple, mango, and pine. Has a hoppy after smell. T- A lot like the aroma. A great tropical flavor with a very good hoppy and bitter finish. M- the carbonation is heavy when it first hits the tongue. Wrecks the palate and stays strong on the tongue for a moment. Medium to heavy bodied. O- Very good DIPA with amazing flavors and a very good mouthfeel.",Russian River Brewing Company,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,100
863,7971,Aaron_Ramson,4.03,"A: brilliant clarity, dense white head, light copper, almost gold color. S: very hop forward; tangerine, pineapple, lemon, mixed with some evergreen and herbal scents. Malt is in the background and compliments the hops without adding a lot of complexity. T: pine resin and citrus/tropical fruit flavors forward, with bready malt character as a solid backbone. Enough bitterness at the end without being overly aggressive or sharp. Not at all astringent or too wet; very balanced. M: medium-thick with a palate coating property that goes down without leaving the mouth oily. Carbonation is a little on the heavy side but compliments the flavor and helps it go down. O: a good, if not completely overrated IPA. I don't see what all the fuss is about. Russian River has created a mystique around this beer that is fun, but ultimately leaves one unsatisfied when it's finally had. Still, worth trying once, if only to see what all the fuss is about.",Russian River Brewing Company,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,100

Lemon, orange, and pine taste, but all subtle. This beer feels light and drinkable for 8% ABV. Perfect bitterness, and possibly the best balanced brew I have experienced.

Color- light gold with a white effervescent head  Smell - huge balanced hop smell with citrus and pine  Taste - a light citrus with huge hop flavor. not very malty a little dank  mouthfeel - good, not especially creamy, but a good bite and a fresh light feel.  This was my favorite beer. After trying heady topper, I thought I still liked this better, but after having them side by side, I have to give the nod (no pun intended) to heady for the grapefruit crisp easy finish. Still a cut above other beers though.",Russian River Brewing Company,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,100

The nose sells this beer for me. Pine and citrus, especially grapefruit. Taste follows nose for me. Big hops, but in a very well balanced format. Not the hoppiest DIPA in the world, but it might be the most balanced and well done.

863,7971,Antnego,4.73,"Popped open a bottle and poured into a chilled stein ... Big shout out to Neil at Red Carpet in Rancho Cucamonga for providing a bottle out of his personal stash!  A: 3.75 - Deep golden hue with almost no head on a slow pour, very thin and dark cream colored. Has an appearance of a typical adjunct lager. Lacing is insane, dense foam clings to the side of the glass.  S: 5 - BIG grapefruit, citrus and floral notes smack you in the nose, trailed by a dense, woody pine backdrop. I'm also detecting some dried fruit like cherries, peaches and figs. The fruitiness of this beer is VERY assertive.  T: 4.75 - The taste follows the smell, with a burst of citrus fruits, dried peaches, and deep pine notes. There is also a strong malty backbone with this one that keeps it from being overpowered by its intense hoppiness. The aftertaste is of strong bitterness from the hops that lingers for an eternity. It might be too much for the uninitiated, bit for hop-heads, it might be paradise.  M: 4.5 - Moderate carbonation, silky-smooth mouthfeel, intensely refreshing on the way down. Coats the tongue and throat quite nicely.  Overall - 4.75: All in all, this is my second divine experience tasting a Russian River offering. Normally, I'm not an IPA fan, but the fruity blend of hops here is so excellent - it's perfectly balanced with strong, sweet malt that keeps the aggressive hop flavor in check. The aftertaste was a bit strong, but that was easily remedied with another sip.

Lots of hops but a fairly generous amount of sweet and lighter crystal malts to it. The malts are just a touch too sweet for me.  Taste: opens up with a good dose of sweet crystal malts. Backend is full of hops. Pine is first, then comes herbal and some floral. Some citrus. A bit of bitter resiny hops.  Mouthfeel: medium body. Nice strong bitterness. Some lingers but not too much.

I'm not really sure what else I can say about this beer that hasn't already been said many many times over. It is a near perfect example of a west coast style double ipa. It has a huge nose of citrus, dank, and tropical fruit. Excellent bitterness level and hop flavor that matches what is expected based on the aroma. It has a low amount of body and a fairly dry finish as I believe all west coast ipas should have. The first time I tried this beer was after a day of hiking in the north cascades and it changed my life and my outlook on what an IPA should taste like.

Not much malt off the nose and I didnt find much pine or grass from the choice of hops used.  T- Very juicy with lots of fruity hops. Citrus and sweet hops dominates the malts. Doesnt get much better than this and I stand by this as being a top 5 IPA. For me, this is the staple of a west coast IPA. It sets a very high bar.  O- One of my favorite IPAs. Hard to find in the east, but luckily they distribute in the Philly area, which isnt too far from me.

Right off the bat I was already seeing how it would compare to Heady so it was a little unfair. That being said it is still a fantastic beer. Strong hop notes, perfect color.  It was bottled in March and we drank it in April so the freshness wasn't a factor (thanks Jon) I feel with some of the beer trading things tend to get outdated and you need good people who understand that.  It is definitely in my top 10 for IPA. It was fantastic. It lived up to the hype it is a damn fine beer. Exceeds what an IPA should be.

863,7971,rawfish,4.59,"Bottled on 051414, fairly fresh, 10 days mark.  Pours stunningly clear and brassy. Nets a head that tops out at 2 fingers but settles with good retention, very rocky and fluffy. Lace seemed to be a bit lacking, this clumps sporadic around the glass.  Stunningly refined much like the clarity. Proudly flaunts a bold west coast IPA citrus and pine hop character floral and perfume-like, starts to fill the room upon pouring. Notes of tropical fruit and grapefruit rind surface over a steady pine backing. Slightly sticky malt character but unable to characterize beneath all the floral hop.  Malt character is sweet bread like and just enough to push back the waves of pine and grapefruit hops as they cascade through the drink. The hop flavor just builds on top of itself and the bitterness is quite intense and flows in seemlessly towards the end of the drink. Bitterness with pine and mint lingers in the aftertaste, smooth and drying. Flavors don't seem too bold or overwhelming but it isn't hard to appreciate how well all aspects of the drink are integrated. A fine tuned machine of a beer.  Good body and smooth carbonation to keep the beer drinkable and balanced. Very smooth, alcohol hidden very well.  Respect your Elder. Admittedly there is some batch variation so it's one to keep drinking, this one is excellent. Truly the standard of which DIPAs are compared, while others may exceed this with certain features, Pliny is well rounded at all corners and will always be in the discussion of top beers.",Russian River Brewing Company,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,100

And boy did it live up to the hype and then some. Having it fresh apparently is the key to this beer.  It poured a translucent copper color with a sheets upon sheets of lacing and a bit of carbonation. Very inviting.  This is a perfectly executed double IPA. It's not a harsh bitter double but rather it strikes a perfect balance between ultra fresh hops and the classic west coast style while allowing your palate to taste all of the complexities.

863,7971,highTempo,4.86,"Serving: bottle poured into a pint glass.  After hearing tons of hype for years I finally found this at a bottle shop here in Portland. It was $7, which seemed a bit high to me but I really wanted to try it and they would only sell one bottle per customer. I guess it just blows out that quickly.  Such an unassuming bottle. There's not a lot of graphic design going on at Russian River. They don't need it with the quality of beer that they are producing.  The pour has a good, two-finger head. The retention is really solid. The color is fantastic: a (very) hazy pale straw yellow with a tiny bit of orange tone underneath.  I like unfiltered IPAs in general. I've heard people say that filtering doesn't change the smell or flavor but I don't believe it. There seems to be more yeast present, especially in the smell.  And the smell is fantastic. It's a really hot mix of pine and grapefruit with some bread-y yeast present.  The flavor is just as good. IPAs seem to be such a broad category. There are ""punch-you-in-the-face"" bitter IPAs and then IPAs that strive for balance. This is the latter. The bitterness of the hops and alcohol are present but not over the top.  I can't help it. I will jump on the bandwagon. This beer is wildly good. It lives up to the hype. I love it. I wish I could find it more often. Oh geez… Too bad it's so well known.

I was fortunate enough to workout a trade for some Jack Abbey and Night Shift for blind Pig and Pliny. Excellent, excellent beers.  The Pliny is in a class of its own with Heady Topper.  No other IPA I've had comes close to these two.",Russian River Brewing Company,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,100
863,7971,shadetree67,4.69,Bottled 11 days ago.  A. Pour yielded 1.5 fingers of frothy head. Clear golden amber in color. Nice lacing and head retention. A slow swirl rebuilds the head nicely. 4.75  S. Lots of hops. Malt is also noticeable. it smells well balanced. 4.5  T. Orange Zest and Pine. The malt is present as well. This is a very well balanced IPA; the hops are in your face though not overbearing. Finish is not sweet nor too bitter. 4.75  M. Medium mouthfeel and carbonation. Leaves a sticky feeling in your mouth with a semi-dry finish 4.75  O. I really enjoy PTE and have had it several times now. I can say that it doesn't age gracefully and is best drank as fresh as possible. Very well balanced and delicious. I would drink it all the time if it was local,Russian River Brewing Company,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,100
863,7971,whirliam,4.97,"This is a special one. Honey color, white foamy head with moderate lacing, rich citrus and tropical fruit smells hit you right away, sweet taste up front with a red grapefruit-y bitter finish. It’s bitter but balanced, sweet but smooth, complex but super drinkable. This is the gold standard my friends. Only to be enjoyed in the presence of a globe and leather-bound book.  www.goodwilltasting.com",Russian River Brewing Company,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,100
863,7971,airborncamel,4.46,"Appearance: Darker than expected. Somewhere between amber and golden and extremely foamy, creamy head; beautiful appearance.  Aroma: Smell hits me right after pouring. Heavy hop aroma coupled with a piney fragrance that was quite surprising me. Epic.  Taste: Holy god! This beer is over hyped but its extremely delicious. Pine, citrus, and an unexpected malt sweetness that balances this beer perfectly. However, it is indeed a palate wrecker. Fifteen minutes later and I still taste it!  Mouthfeel: Exquisite! Lots of heat from the alcohol Lucious foam gives way to chewy thickness that completely blew me away and made this stout fiend ecstatic!  Overall: Superbly delicious. A little hot for my liking. But definitely an excellent brew that makes this stout and porter lover want to continue searching for more hoppy and bitter treats, though few are as good as this one!",Russian River Brewing Company,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,100
863,7971,kflorence,4.69,"Snagged one of the last few at my neighborhood market. After quaffing this several times in the past month, I'm finally sitting down and giving this brew the review it deserves.  A: Pours a deep gold with hints of copper. Lots of creamy foam sits atop. Head retention is pretty decent, although it eventually subsides to a thin layer of film. Tons of lacing and ample carbonation. A beauty, I can't imagine an IIPA looking much better.  S: Lots of hops make their presence known in the aroma, as is expected, but a solid maltiness is also present. On a passing whiff, the overall aroma is light, sweet and airy; predominantly floral, with a bit of pine and citrus and some sugary, butterscotch tones from the malts. If you let it really percolate through your nostrils, however, the tones are much stronger and more earthy. It's almost as if you're smelling a fresh hop. As good as it smells, it cannot entirely mask it's higher ABV.  T: This brew wastes no time in mercilessly assaulting the palate in a spicy, floral pine and citrus tsunami of hop goodness. Sweet and tangy up front, the forefront of the assault is extremely floral and piney, climaxing into a bitter, alcohol and grapefruit rind concoction that paints itself on the tongue and seems to last forever. A tad bit pine heavy for my tastes, but I can appreciate the quality here.  M: Medium bodied with lively carbonation and a good amount of chewiness. The oils from the hops coat the tongue a bit and make this one slide down easy. Finishes dry with a little bit of cottonmouth. Can't ask for much more from an IIPA in terms of mouthfeel.  O: While not exactly my cup of tea, I was not dissapointed by the hype of this beers almost cult-like status. This has probably become the quintessential American IIPA and sets a great bar for others to strive for. Personally, I found it a bit on the piney side (Piney the Elder? :), and I don't think I could ever finish more than one bottle in a sitting without destroying my stomach (and did I mention, it's quite the palate wrecker), but I would certainly recommend it to others who are chasing the hop dragon. A must-have at some point for any beer aficionado. Cheers!",Russian River Brewing Company,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,100
863,7971,mattcrill,4.8,"Major thanks to Tammisbutler for the opportunity to sample this one.  Aroma: Big piney notes hop out of the glass. As the beer is swirled pineapple, grapefruit, and orange aromas are noted. Fermentation character is clean.  Appearance: Crystal clear amber pour with a 2-finger white cap that retains well. Leaves sticky lacing on the glass.  Flavor: Huge rush of pineapple and grapefruit character right out of the gate. There is a bit of orange slice sweetness in the background that lends a cool counterpoint. I think this light sweetness makes it drinkable and incredibly tasty so the hops have something to work with. Balance is to the wonderfully bitter and flavorful hops. Finish is bone dry. Aftertaste is lingering and powdery bitterness.  Mouthfeel: Light bodied, moderately high carbonation, and slightly oily. No heat or astringency.  Overall impression: A wonderful treat. Definitely worth the hype. Will seek out and have again.",Russian River Brewing Company,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,100
863,7971,Seanamonica,4.58,"Not going to lie...friends of mine hyped this beer up to be the second coming...I expected perfection. Although it was a VERY good beer, not worth the hype.

Always try to get my hands on a bottle for special occasions: birthday, graduations, and holidays. I recommend this to everyone I know. Opened a few weeks old bottle and poured into a tulip and saw a great 1.5 finger head form with great retention. Giving it a nice whiff you get a great scent for pine and other citrus notes. I had high expectations about this beer and after tasting it I can honestly say that they were meet. Not bitter at all very smooth and goes down at a relatively quick rate which can be a problem since its about 8%. I think the best part of this beer is that the more you drink it the more you enjoy it. It is consistently good and stays at the top of my top beers.

863,7971,Walshwi,4.87,"Preface: I've been around the world tasting beer and wine. I've had nearly every beer on the Beer Advocate top 250. I appreciate all styles but have a preference for Double IPAs.  Pliny lives up to its hype. While similar in style to Heady Topper, they are two very different brews. Heady Topper has a great initial taste (probably the best), but the overall taste pales in comparison to Pliny. Pliny is refined and elegant.  Pliny pours golden with a great head. As it is an IPA, don't tilt the glass when pouring! Pour it into itself to unleash the flavor.  One of the very few brews in which the smell is indicative of the flavor. It doesn't let you down. It smells of citrus, hops, and honey.  Taste is almost perfect from start to finish. It is impeccably balanced. The bitterness and malt backbone pair perfectly. The balance of hops is perfect. The sweet citrus and hop flavor flows throughout the sip. No bitter aftertaste and it has a smooth, clean taste.  This beer is perfect because of science. The most important ingredient - the yeast - is priceless. If you can get your hands on that proprietary strain, you'll be able to make your own cult beer. The other science is the blending of hops which ""attack"" certain parts of your palate. Much like the blending of grapes in a world-class French Bordeaux, the blending of hops in this beer is, itself, world-class.  The only negative aspect of this beer is the volatility of the hops. The taste is perishable. If it gets too hot or exposed to sunlight, the flavor profile is damaged. I've had BAD glasses of Pliny!! Some of the more negative reviews are probably based on the fact the flavor profile was damaged. When you make a trade for Pliny, it sits in a hot truck on its trek hundreds/thousands of miles. Make no mistake, when fresh, this brew is something to behold and I still haven't had anything close.",Russian River Brewing Company,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,100
863,7971,More_betterness,4.72,"Finally reviewing after having countless bottles over the years. Bottled on 4/9/14  A: Crystal clear golden amber with a two finger head after a careful pour. Brilliantly clear and beautiful beer.  S: Resinous hops. Dank pine, citrus rind, and pineapple followed by some grassy/floral notes. Orange zest and a touch of malt are also present. Masterclass.  T: Sweet tangerine and citrusy lemon upfront. Sappy and bitter pine coats the palate and lingers for minutes after each sip. Just a hint of bready malt character becomes apparent as it warms. Perfect balance of flavor and bitterness for the style.  M: Dry and light bodied with medium carbonation. The massive amount of hops have a noticeable oily/slick texture as well.  O: What can I say that hasn't been said? Just an epic beer that literally defines the style. When fresh it is always one of the best beers I have ever had, only surpassed by heady, the Younger, and BCBCS IMO. Can't recommend enough",Russian River Brewing Company,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,100
863,7971,ChrisL24481,4.71,"Finally was able to trade for a few bottles and I had extremely high hopes for PtE. After pouring into the glass, beautiful golden orange brew sat in front of me. A frothy white head sat atop the beautiful liquid. Some lacing was left as the head quickly dissipated. The nose and the taste are typical of west coast IPAs. Citrusy fruit flavors swirl around the mouth. It goes down smooth and it is not overly bitter. Very flavorful and very smooth. Very pleased with this, but would still prefer Heady over this great one.",Russian River Brewing Company,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,100
863,7971,wcoastbeerlover,5,"Pliny is the finest beer I've ever tasted. For a 2X IPA it's as crisp and refreshing as it gets... for ANY beer. Some people say it's overhyped, which I don't agree with, but it depends on what type of beer you like. If you're an IPA fan and you think this beer is overhyped then I don't sympathize. But if IPA's aren't your thing then I can see how you might not appreciate it as much as someone like me who drinks almost exclusively IPA's. It is so perfectly balanced and smooth. Hoppy, citrusy, fresh, and perfect all come to mind every time I have a Pliny.",Russian River Brewing Company,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,100
863,7971,Kramerwtmf,4.95,I am lucky enough to have enjoyed Pliny countless times both in the bottle and on draught.

863,7971,lochef81,4.73,"Wow!!! Finally got a bottle of this coveted ale and it definitely lives up to the hype. The pour is one of the sexiest golden copper colors I have ever seen. The head is thick, bone white, frothy and long lasting. Plus there is silky lacing for days. The nose is dank and citrusy. An abundance of grapefruit, pine, grass, mango, and tangerines abound. The mouthfeel is great but I'd actually like it to be a bit stickier. The flavor is a balanced bomb of west coast hops; taking all the notes of the nose and making them shine even more. This is mist certainly one of (if not the) best dipa I've ever had. Just wish it'd show its face in Michigan more often.",Russian River Brewing Company,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,100

Very dank with some pineapple, grapefruit notes maybe  Taste - up front you get that lovely hoppy bite, wow this one is great! Just a little over three weeks old, would love to try a fresh one! Beautiful finish with a mild malty biscuit taste.  Mouthfeel - definitely covers the palate with hops! Carbonation is great not too overwhelming. Lovely bitterness taste, leaves a nice bready aftertaste  Overall - Beautiful!! Been wanting to taste this for a long time. After recieving this in a trade, it met all my expectaions in this beer.

Taste: pine bitterness as it starts and finishes with a lingering citrus bite. No malt sweetness, just a hint of breadyness.  Mouthfeel: medium carbonation, medium-light body. Finish is very dry.  Overall: great IPA. Balance is the key here, very drinkable for such a hoppy IPA.",Russian River Brewing Company,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,100
863,7971,brewskis,4.13,"Pours a clear bright golden color with a two finger white head. Beautiful looking beer.  Aroma is decent, but not outstanding by today's standards. Get floral, grapefruit, tangerine, light mango, and pine from the hops. A hefty dose of bread and carmel come from the malt. Quite balanced.  Taste is balanced as well, but allows the hops to still shine. Get pine, tangerine, light grapefruit, and floral from the hops. The hop flavors have a nice brightness to them. Malt comes through in the beginning and middle of the mouth to bring a light carmel and sugary sweetness and some breadiness. The finish dries out nicely just like the pioneer of a west-coast DIPA would and leaves pine resin, citrus, and floral on the palate.  Mouthfeel is awesome. Medium body with a crisp, creamy, and very clean finish.  Back in the early 2000's, this would no doubt be deserving of high praise. However, as more and more breweries specialize in hoppy beers that are simply and truthfully better than this one, the hype becomes more and more ridiculous. Don't get me wrong, this is still a very solid DIPA with a good hop character, balance, and surprisingly clean finish. Nevertheless, this has to go down as one of those over-hyped beers in the craft beer scene. Still glad I got to try this though.",Russian River Brewing Company,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,100

T- Grapefruit,lemon, pepper, malty sweet breadyness, well balanced pine, smooth taste, very drinkable.  M- Well balanced medium body, juicy mouthfeel. Stays on your palate slightly, leaves you wanting more.  O- Overall you can tell this is a very good beer. I don't see any major flaws I just think newer beers have passed it up. This beer is going 55 on the highway when everyone else is going 65-70.

I grew up in Escondido, California, and saw Stone grow from a roll up garage to a big, pleasant machine. Enjoy By is good, but I think Pliny the Elder is a tad better. It may be because I drink Enjoy By often, or it might be because the Pliny was fresh. These two beers are comparable, I love both of them.

863,7971,itsratso,4.18,"thanx to my new trading partner robb for this one!  if you are a first timer, it is difficult to review pliny. a: the beer pours a nice clear orange with fluffy white head that lasts as long as can be expected for this abv. s: smell is tremendous, a nice mix of tropical fruit, pine and dankness. m: mouthfeel is good with a nice crispness and appropriate carb level. t + o: taste follows nose as you get a burst of nice citrus followed by pine and dankness. there is an underlying sweetness from the malt that is refreshing but not cloying. the bitterness level is much lower than most current ipa's. the problem with reviewing pliny these days is it tastes like a typical west coast ipa. I would probably pick sculpin above this if blindfolded, and I can think of a few more ipa's that I like more. but here's the thing - the reason all those other ipa's taste like this is because they ALL copied this. it is the blueprint, the archetype. I think this beer along with boston ale are the two most important American beers in history. without this, no IPA's and no explosion of interest in them. so although the rest of the field has caught up, I have great respect for this beer.",Russian River Brewing Company,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,100
863,7971,minterro,4.44,"Since beginning to drink craft beer in 2009 this beer has been on my wishlist. After moving to Denver, I have had this beer a couple of times. A first I wanted to purely take it in, but the time has come to give it a rating.  Bought at Little's Wine and Liquor store in Denver, CO. Bottling date is: 03/18/14 so about as fresh as it gets in CO, 16 days.  A&S: Big fluffy (about 2 fingers) white head that leaves networks of thick lacing along the glass. Head retention is great considering 8% ABV. The beer is a lively transparent light orange color. Predominate aroma tones (in no order) include: lemon, pepper spice, piney hops, and sugary sweetness.  T&M: Well mixed piny and citrus hops complimented by a spicy undertone. My favorite characteristic about this beer is the fact that it is a double with some sweetness, but it isn't overpoweringly sweet, malty and heavy. I understand that to get to some higher DIPA ABV (10, 11, ect.) you need to juice it up, but that juicing can cut through other important flavors in the beer. Incredible drinkable, not heavy on the palate, yet very flavorful. Alcohol is very well hidden (almost too much so). Majority of the spice hits midway though. A wave of bitterness punches your palate as the flavor begins to finish, leaving a lasting, but not heavy finish (as a disclaimer: Not nearly the tongue bruiser as I imagined it to be). Body is on the low side of high with some oily context. The carbonation isn't as high as I expected from the lively look to this beer.  Overall: Having high expectations for particular beer will affect the score you give it. Admittedly, I have seen the rating of this beer before, because it is top 5. This review might not be as high as some, but this beer, certainly belongs in the top tier of all beers. Also one of the best beers on the market for the price about $6.",Russian River Brewing Company,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,100
863,7971,IpaBeerDrinkers,4.82,"Very basic and uninspiring offering. Huge dissapointment. Taste is of a traditional west coast IPA, which is fine, but its a very unimaginative attempt at the style. Have had this fresh twice, felt the same way both times. Heady Topper is vastly better, as are most quality west coast ipas coming out right now.  Retaste- I had this again and felt the need to adjust the rating. I have no clue what was wrong with the first 2 I had, but 3rd time around and it was really good. Still not on par with the hype, but really good and it wipes out my negative view toward PTe.  4th time around- really, really good. No clue on the first bottles  5th time around- ok so the more i drink this, the more it stands out. I'm probably around 1,000 ipas as far as what ive tried. And pliny continues to stand out. I guess i finally have to admit what the cool kids have been saying; this is a top 5 ipa period.

The nose blows your hair back with a massive hop nose dripping of pine tar and grapefruit juice as well as other sweet citrus and some bready malt. On the palate, hops, hops and more hops!

The carbonation laces down nicely. The taste is awesome: all sorts of hops (I think a strong cascade hop presence ) right up front that gives way to a malt backbone that is sweet, juicy and able to hold up the heavy hops. The citrus flavor comes through the hops and is very different in character than other DIPAs I've had, there is definitely a lot of orange, and the flavor of orange or lemon peel even lingers on your palate after the hops are gone. The carbonation is soft and the mouthfeel is quite awesome. Overall I see why there is such hype, one of the most drinkable and balanced DIPAs I've had...

Reminds me of rose oil to a certain degree.  Flavor: very hoppy, but very well balanced. Easy to drink- too easy! Without the strong malt backbone, this would be tough to consume. With it, it’s a world beating beer. It has some spiciness, along with the grapefruit and other citrus flavors.  Mouthfeel: Medium/full body, but balanced and medium dry in the finish. Very smooth drinking.  Opinion: Being from Oregon, I get far more than my share of West Coast IPAs. I may have had a better one at some point, but I can’t say when.

863,7971,BradtheGreat7,4.85,"Thanks to my California trade connection(Jesse) for this one!  1 pint, 1.25 oz(510ml) brown bottle with a beautiful Russian River shape. This is what we've come to know Pliny the Elder to look like bottle wise. Beautiful green label with a red and white logo. Bottle informs you to drink this stuff fresh multiple times. Really a genius bottling. Poured into a large nonic pint glass.  A - yellow golden body with highlights of orange throughout. Nice haze and very active. White head poured very nice before settling into a ring of lace covering the top of its golden body. Very nice stick clings to the walls of the glass. Just a beautiful dipa. It's haze and glows in the light while providing a big active bubble effect on the pour.  S - the best nose I've ever whiffed. There is some classic hop notes up front with pine and grapefruit but turns quickly to big bold fruitiness of passion fruit, pineapple, and a touch of mango. It's actually west coast meets tropical sweetness. Just damn brilliant. Sweet malts and a hint of grain mellow everything out in the best possible way imaginable. This has big hop aromas balanced quite nicely and gets the nose across in a massive but a very smooth character.  T - wow.. I don't think I can stop drinking this to review it! It's that good. Bitter grapefruit, pine and faint grass notes to start only to make way for a gushing fruitiness of pineapple, passion fruit, soft mango, and pear. Fruity and citric! The hops are complex but there's so much going on with the fruitiness that the pine and grapefruit almost seem sweet. Pale malts paired with big bready malts give Pliny the Elder a balance unlike any other. Hop forward but with sweet malt undertones just sit Pliny apart from the rest of the world. Fruity alcohol esters, Resinous hop notes and fresh dankness sit in the finish and just make it impossible not to take the next sip.  M - big medium body and right down scary in texture and thickness. This is one of the greatest feels I've ever had. It's big and flavorful yet thick enough to add a crazy smoothness. It coats and drinks like a dipa should. Not overbearing but just down right luscious and delicious. The absolute best!  O - I have my favorite beers but Pliny the Elder is of another breed. This is hands down the greatest beer ever created and the best dipa in the world. It's just scary good and it oozes class. The sort of world class liquid we all strive to find. I am amazed every single time I have this, and we are lucky to have such a grand offering available in the world of craft beer today. Pliny the Elder is a treat and I look forward to drinking this again soon. If you love dipa's then you must seek this one out! It's just one of those experiences everyone should have at some point. Thank you Russian River for creating and delivering such an awesome ale!",Russian River Brewing Company,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,100

T Very piney up front, a bit rounded out by malt. Very clean aftertaste and very drinkable. M Very delicate and very well balanced in terms of the carbonation. This is very pleasant on the palate. O I think this is a great beer in terms of the drinkability; however, I think that this beer could be a little more complex. I think this is a very pine forward beer and that the hop varietals do not offer anything aside from said pine. I would like to see some citrus or a bit more malt.

863,7971,KornWallace,4.94,"Date: 4/20/14 Location: 98 Bottles (San Diego) Glassware: Tulip Appearance: Amber to Orange in color with a thumb size white carbonated head. The beer maintains a carbonated ring at its edge throughout. Little haze but the beer is opaque when put to light. The beer has a modest cling as the carbonation works it's way down after every sip. Aromatics: A wonderful aroma that starts with fruits like tangerines, pineapple, and grapefruit. A very flavorful tartness that comes from the many hops in the beer yet it still smells a bit honeyed. Flavor: Just a beautiful flavor as the yeast gives the beer a buttered silky flavor in the front. With the fruit rushing to the middle adding nice zest. Definitely getting the most from the grapefruit. The finish ends with the citrus pine and slight resin of hops. Mouthfeel: The mouthfeel is smooth and crisp as can be. Medium body with medium high carbonation. The tart stays on my tongue with some hop pine as the beer begins to fade after my last sip. Notes: Brought from San Diego from my brother.

863,7971,scotorum,4.61,"Another beer I never expected to be able to try at least until the next trip to visit relatives in California. That I can do so now is thanks to the seemingly unbounded generosity of BigStein88.  Bottled 1/17/14. Nearly two months old, but I'm not unhappy with that considering it travelled from California to New England and changed hands again after that.  Poured from the 16.25 oz. bottle into an Alchemist shaker pint. Couldn't resist the irony.  a: Clear dark gold with a two inch tall white head which dissipated slowly to rocky surface foam and patterned lacing.  s: Intense pine. Some floral notes.  t; Very smooth first impression, indefinable almost bubble gummy flavor followed by moderate hop bite and some floral notes. Bitterness lingers on the tongue but is mellowed by the floral aspect. Very ""refined"" tasting, although it becomes predictably rougher and more bitter as it warms. 8% alcohol? You've got to be kidding. Where?  m: Slickly smooth. Little carbonation.  o: If it's this good with nearly two months on it, what is it like fresh? Definitely one of the very best DIPAs I have had.

Bottled 2.6.14 Thanks chickencoop Poured into my tulip glass amazing amber color, with a thin quickly disappearing head that leaves a nice lacing as I drink this down. Smell is amazing grapefruit, citrus, pine needles and a nice sweetness. Tastes the same way it smells, there is an almost overpowering hop presence but the malty sweetness doesn't let it get to much, as the malt fades it leaves a nice bitter aftertaste. The mouth feel is silky smooth and delivers the hoppiness to my taste buds. I see how this was so mind blowing at the time it came out, almost created its own style that is often imitated but never equaled over the years.

863,7971,BeerZombies1,5,"American double / Imperial IPA 8% ABV 100 IBU  APPEARANCE: Pours a bright, vibrant golden hue. Seems to glow or burn like fire dancing with orange highlights. Dense, billowy three fingers of head with great lacing.  AROMA: Did I just snort a line of hops? In your face hops, intense pine and resin. Very dank and earthy that starts to give way to a fruit bomb of grapefruit, mango, papaya and citrus. End with light floral and grassy notes.  TASTE: like tiny angels dancing on my tongue! First taste is that hoppy bitterness that takes over your mouth. Once you get used to it the layers of sweetness from the fruit really shine. Light lemon grass and floral hits with that great bitterness remaining throughout.  MOUTHFEEL: Medium body with lively carbonation. Coats the entire mouth allowing the complex layers to really come out. Finished perfectly dry with nice lingering bitterness.  OVERALL: This is the IPA I hold all others up against. For me and my pallet it's perfect. I 100% understand the hype behind this beer. From popping the bottle to the last sip out of my glass it never disappoints.

Coming from the East Coast and having heard so much about this beer i was very excited to jump into a few of these on my vacation to San Francisco and the greater area. Unfortunately i thought Pliny the Elder was just Good, it wasnt Very good. I had rought a half dozen beers on the west coast i thought were better presentations. but i still enjoyed this beer  A - Great looking beer, was a deep Amber/orangish brew, had a nice fluffy head that retained well  S - Very jumpy pine and grapefruit at first gives way to a little dankier hops, but seemed less dynamic than i anticipated.  T - Grapefruite comes first and there is great balance in this beer with the strong hop notes and a nice malt backbone to hold it all together, only problem was it seemed like a short taste. there were flahses of citrus and some pine, but really not as robust and complex as many other IPAs i have had.  M - Mouthfeel was just right, had good carbonation, beer was very drinkable.  O - Overall Good beer, Very nice hop characters, very nice presentation. everything was very nice, i would buy this beer often if i lived out west, but there are many other beers i enjoy more, and i just cant give it a top score.",Russian River Brewing Company,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,100

Alcohol is not noticeable. Bubbles tickle the tongue. Just a subtle hint of bitterness lingers on the tongue. Really nice mouthfeel.  O - It really lives up to the hype.

A: Pours a sharp, deep golden and shimmers with light amber fire. The clarity is sexy perfect. It forms some gnarly head, slightly off-white, many fingers, tight, and web-like with fabulous retention. I could stare it down all afternoon.  S: Better than the appearance. Bitter-sweet with fresh and cool pine sightly girded by sturdy citrus of grapefruit and tangerine. The malt is perfect; receding into the background, it leaves a delicate trace of light crunchy caramel and graham cracker. There is also a light fruit garnish of apricots...why not?  T: The most complex thing I've had to date. The front is floral and gives way to an apparent resiny hop presence. The malt structure is there but not the star, yet nor are the hops. The balance is the star--the narrative journey tasting this takes you on. It moves and changes within the seconds so overtly that you notice the process and the change. Very cool stuff.

Expertly balanced with a beautiful mix of interesting, diverse floral hops complemented by a smooth piney backbone. The malts do a wonderful job of calming the typical assertive bitterness of an IPA, and especially a double.

Beautiful clear golden color with about a 1/4 head as compared to a more cloudy golden color of Heady. Smelled of amazing floral hoppyness. As far as a mouthfeel I felt it was a little thinner than Heady. VERY similar in taste to but with a little different finish at the end of a sip than Heady. All in All this beer is amazing and delicious. And left me wanting more and wanting to move to California for the rest of Russian River's lineup.

As soon as I saw it we realized the first one was the wrong beer. They have Damnation on tap as well and mistakenly given me one of those. The Elder pours a darker golden color with about a finger of off white foam. It didn’t linger long but did leave a little lacing. The nose was huge! Lots of grapefruit and pine notes.

Looks great in the Russian River pint glass I've been reserving for this for so long. We want this beer in WA!!  Really interesting beer. After serving it the hop aroma starts invading the room. Can feel it 2-3 feet away. Putting the nose in the glass makes it obvious, but not overwhelming. All kind of hops, dank, piney, fruity, citrusy. Malt is there too, way behind, though, but it's there.  Taste is hop forward, but balanced. So balanced it's incredible. Nothing goes out of proportion in this beer. Everything is exactly where it should be, everything is there but nothing is obvious. Not extremely bitter, highly drinkable. Something is sweet, but just right sweet. Just to balance the hops.  Mouthfeel is light, easy drinking. Maybe this is what drinkability means and not what the guys from the drinkability ads sell. Sip, gulp, want more, repeat, repeat. Darn, it's gone. Are you sure it was 8% ABV? Felt like nothing. I'd have another two, or three.  Not sure if it's the best IPA I've ever tasted it, but it's darn good. I hope I can go to Santa Rosa soon. I'll pack two cases of it and drive back. It will be an amazing month when I do it.  Cheers!",Russian River Brewing Company,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,100

863,7971,Matt_Schlamann,5,"The perfect Imperial IPA. (In my opinion). The limited availability, even for Southern California, makes it more of a scavenger hunt to find it. The aroma is a dank, hoppyness that can't be beat. The taste is amazingly mouthwatering, getting better as you go.

Followed by some grapefruit lemon and other dry fruits and maybe some honey?  T- that hoppiness stands out so well in this beer. Fresh pine followed by a sugary molasses. Leaves a rather pleasant bitter woody finish. There is a thick malt backbone that helps support the hop character. Very nice taste. the fruitiness in this beer is very subtle but it lets you taste the sweetness after you endure the bitter hoppiness. Honey is present on the back end of the beer that blends well with the bitterness.  M- a little harsh. Pretty carbonated as well and finishes with a bite.  O- a very good beer. Although it tastes very similar to ither IPAs i've had. I love the smell of this beer the most.

There are some light piney notes, almost a hint of mint. The finish ends long and dry with just a touch of spice and booze. There is some lingering grapefruit bitterness.  Medium bodied with a slightly viscous mouthfeel. Active, creamy carbonation.  Wonderfully balanced but big DIPA. This is one heck of a hoppy beer.

I've now had it both on draft and in the bottle and this bottle (bottled about 6 weeks ago) is the most I've enjoyed it by quite a bit.  Pours a beautiful dark golden color with about a half inch of creamy white head. Smell is dank, earthy, grassy and floral. Taste is much the same, malt takes a big backseat so that the hop flavors can shine though in a great balance with one another. Bitterness is there but the hop flavors are still the main act. Dry finish with flavors that linger slightly but don't stick to the tongue and leave your palette fried.  On other tastes I've been overpowered by bitterness but now I can finally perceive all the great dank hop flavors that are there. This is not a DIPA with tons of citrus or tropical hop flavors but if you can tease out the amazing earthy hop flavors that are there, it's a truly great beer.

The elder is still bubbling away but younger is not. 5  S - Same piney notes on both, but younger has the more complex citrusy fruit. 4.5  T - younger has the more complex and pleasant taste. More citrus fruit on top of the piney taste. 4.5  M - even though elder has the more apparent carbonation the younger mouthfeel is better to me. Younger has the best mouthfeel of any ipa I've had, so it'd be a 5 in its class but doesn't compare as well to smooth silky stouts like bcbcs, etc. 4.5  O - slightly less as good younger. So...

863,7971,Jeff17,4.83,"Bottle was less than 5 days old, and the freshness was very apparent. Clarity when pouring was the first noticeable thing. Very similar to Firestone Walker Union Jack in that term. Gorgeous color in the tangerine spectrum of orange. A fluffy head that stayed for a really nice amount of time. The greatest part of the beer was the aroma- and that is not short changing the taste- but the smell of this beer is just so wonderfully clean and complex. And that translated into the taste. Amazing how the malt characters come through so distinctly at the front with the amount of hops within this gem.  As with Zombie Dust, Westy 12 and BCBS, where there is so much hype and talk, Pliny lives up to every wonderful description.

Mild haze, certainly not able to see through. Head was nice but disappeared quickly. Lacing all the way down.  The aroma was nice but a bit more piney and not nearly as citrus-y as i had expected.  Overall, very carbonated, nice tiny bubbles. Taste's like a world class double IPA. I like a bit more melon personally, but who am i to complain. If i lived in an area where this was readily available i'm sure i'd drink plenty of it, though i think i may prefer Blind Pig.

Very good beer that is really easy to drink but the Lagunitas Fusion 20 SF I had before this was better. Glad to have finally tried Pliny but seems overly hyped.",Russian River Brewing Company,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,100
863,7971,Jackofallbrews,4.87,"My impressions of this beer were all good. I found this to be very dry, but not overly astringent. The hop aroma was strong and citrusy, with a light malt note to back that up. The flavor really matched the aroma well with no huge surprises. The dry finish and lack of alcohol warming makes this beer deceptively smooth and easy to drink, perhaps the most dangerous of the ones I tried. Folks not prepared for this alcohol content could put down a few of these before realizing just how strong they are! I have tried the bigger brawnier brother (Pliny the Younger) and that one takes it to the next level--more in line with a lot of the recent additions to the pantheon.",Russian River Brewing Company,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,100

863,7971,dar482,4.47,"The color is clear and light gold. It actually is really light in color.  The aroma has some deep and dank pine sweetness. It is a floral bouquet with tons of tropical fruit with peach, pineapple, mango. There's some breadiness in there too. Deep in, it's just pure hops. It just puts off the acids of the hops that few beers can do.  The flavor follows with pine, sweet mango, some tropical fruits. There then is a lingering bitterness that just cleans up the beer. The malt backbone is gentle, but strong enough to keep this beer balanced. The pine though is what stands out. It has a light malt body, tastes like pure juice, and stands out with lots of pine flavor as well as earthiness.  And that's the word, balance. With the huge aroma, the complex hop characteristics, and then that malt backbone. This beer really has everything wonderful about Double IPAs. The alcohol is not there at all and this could even be mistaken for a regular IPA.  Having had this again, the pine stands out for me, but it exemplifies the ""pure hoppiness"" of beers like Zombie Dust and Heady Topper. It attacks your teeth with the acidic hops.  In the end, this does it better than other DIPAs, but is not a game changer.

Gentle, warm toasted malt; biscuit and a touch of caramel all wrapped together with a bold yet soothing hop bitterness flavor. Medium-heavy body; smooth; clean and dry finish.  After hearing so much about this DIPA, I am glad to see my experience generally agrees with all the hype. Juicy body with a sweet melon tone melds together nicely with an all-encompassing hop bitterness that nicely complements the malt components.

863,7971,mikejonze,4.83,"Bottled 1-6-14. Poured into a tulip glass on 1-26-14.  APPEARANCE: Dark, hazy orange/gold with glowing corn yellow highlights. Looks absolutely beautiful. Single-finger bubbly white head that quickly settles into a thin foam that sits on the surface for the duration and leaves beautiful, slowly descending lacing on the sides of the glass – some of the best I've seen, especially for this style.  AROMA: Hops in your face! Fresh, piny, resinous hops. Very robust, earthy herbal & floral notes. Actually reminds me of the scent of weed. Once you've gotten accustomed to the blast of piny hops and that dank earthiness, the citrus notes start to come out: fresh pineapple, grapefruit, tangerine, maybe even a little mango. Loving all the different ways this thing is waking up my sense of smell.  TASTE: Medium to moderate hop bitterness hits you hard initially, but then tails off and doesn't stay with you, slowly morphing into a mixture of citrus fruits and sweet bread. The hop flavor still remains present throughout, but the other flavors come out and balance it all out very well. Pretty dry finish, but without leaving mouth feeling dry. Virtually no bite on the back end, 8% ABV is very well hidden.  MOUTHFEEL: Light to medium body, crisp and lively on the tongue, but somehow also feels very soft and smooth in the mouth.  OVERALL: An extremely well-balanced, heavily aromatic, complex double IPA. Mostly lives up to all the hype and definitely worth seeking out if you can't get it where you live.

863,7971,PaulyB83,4.63,"Bottled on 1/10/14, so I think this counts as fresh. Poured from 16oz. bottle into a tulip glass.  A- Light amber, very nice clarity, got a nice high white head that dissipated to a thin film. Very good retention.  S- Big dank pine, evidence of lots of Simcoe. Sweet and bitter grapefruit with a light papaya. It's not that punch in your face, smell from across the room hops that Heady Topper is but surely nothing to sneeze at.  T- Again lots of pine, got a much less bitter hop punch than I was expecting considering many of it's Sierra Nevada, Stone, and Green Flash counterparts. I like the smoother West Coast bitterness in this one though, really adds to it's drinkability. As it warmed I did detect the alcohol more but still very well hidden and right in that sweet spot of 8%. Also got some light tropical notes and a backing light toasted malt.  M- A bit lighter than I was expecting but it really adds to the drinkability.  O- A very impressive beer. I can see how it can both be overhyped as well as disappointing to some people. To be honest, my first reaction was of disappointment. But then I realized I was just mistaken as to what this beer is supposed to be. It is just meant to be a perfectly balanced IIPA and it is perhaps the best balanced and drinkable IIPA out there.",Russian River Brewing Company,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,100

Quick top note of citrus followed by a subtle aroma of pine and resin. A bit of lingering ""dank"" smell at the tail end.  T- Similar to the smell, a nice balancing of bright citrus and biting. hoppy pine flavors. A slight sweetness to counterbalance the hops. Starts bitter, goes sweet and then back to bitter. But all balanced and none overpowering. Lasting aftertaste of slight bitter hops that sticks to your tongue.  M- Nice, medium bodied beer. Great carbonation that provides a crisp, clean feeling. Lingering hoppiness gives it a slight ""chewy"" feeling  O- Near perfection. A wonderful change from the movement toward the over the top Citrus flavors in many IPAs. The lingering aftertaste of hops really sets this apart from many other IPAs. This is a beer that I could drink all day or linger over just one glass. The hop taste I'm left with is neither overpowering nor is it fleeting and disappointing. For me, most IPAs I can only have 2 of before I feel I have ""wrecked"" my palate for the evening. Having recently just had Zombie Dust, which is so smooth that you almost don't notice you're drinking a hoppy craft beer, I feel that Pliny succeeds at not being too smooth so you can still recognize the craftsmanship and hops.",Russian River Brewing Company,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,100

Citrus, flowers, grass, and pine notes. Quite pretty.  Quite tasty. Citrus- and pine-driven hop flavor, light and clean malt with just enough sweetness for balance, a touch of grassy astringency, and bold bitterness that lingers on the palate for quite a while.

863,7971,Zaso,4.93,"Poured aggressively from a 6 day old bottle directly into a sniffer.  Beautiful, golden color with a thin head that clung nicely to the glass as it was drank. A quick sniff brings about immediate notes of pine followed by a more subtle array of sweet, floral aromatics.  The first taste went right with the scent; A citrus taste that yields a well-balanced group of flavors. I can taste the typical DIPA flavors of grapefruits, oranges and lemon, but none of them are overpowering like with other beers of similar style. The backend of the beer keeps the same flavors, but with the sweetness of the malt and the small hint of alcohol as it goes down. A great beer from start to finish.  The freshness that is the signature of Pliny makes a huge difference when it comes to the head of the beer and the aromatics in the scent. Beyond that, Pliny is one of the best balanced beers of this style from the start to finish. There's nothing substantially different about Pliny compared to other greats, it just does all of the little things right.

On the palate, strong pine and grapefruit/citrus florals with huge hops balance well with smooth malts. Maintains head & lacing throughout. Moderate carbonation. Mouthfeel is full and thick.

The taste hits every note from the smell and is long and yum(couldn't think of better word there). The mouthfeel is light but rich and all the taste permeates.

Malt presence was definitely there, while it was hop forward without any doubt, the malt was assertive enough to keep the hops from owning the beer and give a boost to the body. Not overly sweet, the malt played its role and supported the fantastically complex orange, lemon/grapefruit, pine layers of the hops  Definitely a noteworthy IPA, now I understand where the hype comes from. reminded me a bit of jai alai with a splash of green flash ipa for some reason",Russian River Brewing Company,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,100

Keeping in mind that there's no such thing as a great beer, only a great bottle, my experience last night could certainly be a particularly great bottle of PtE and a less-than-great bottle (which was actually a can) of Sculpin, but there was no comparison on this particular evening. The Pliny was simply far and away superior. It is incredibly rich, despite its high bitterness and hop character. Floral, fruit and sweetness combine to make this a compelling drink on its own, and compared to other world class beers (we also opened a Belching Beaver Dammed DIPA and a Port Brewing High Tide) this was simply better, at least for my palate.

A: Poured somewhat aggressively into my tulip glass with hopes of conjuring up a fluffy head. Got it! About 2 1/2 fingers of creamy and billowy snow white head. The head has a really nice body to it. Nice and thick, and sticks around for awhile. Eventually it falls, leaving delicate lacing all along the side of the glass. This beer is beautiful in the glass. Exactly what a beer should look like in my opinion. Color is a light copper with honey tones. Looks really rich in the glass. This beer is bit cloudy, but not ""hazy."" The head has now fallen to about 1 finger and caps the beer nicely. Lacing is beautiful throughout the entire session.  S: Big citrus notes right from the start. Grapefruit, orange peel, honey, and some alcohol. Loads of sugar in the nose, but not in a sickly/sweet way. Notes of pine, resin, and sweet biscuits follow to provide a wonderfully complex and balanced nose.  T: A quick hit of bitter grapefruit loaded with sweet candied sugar and honey. The sweetness that comes through on this is perfect...Not puckering or cloying at all. Pure. I get faint hints of lemongrass and orange as well. After the initial citrus bitterness and sweetness subside, the hints of pine and resin come on perfectly to balance the flavors of this beer. And when those hop notes fade, the bitterness still remains, sensed on all sides of my tongue, with a faint astringency creeping up. Perfect layers of flavor that come forward at different times throughout the duration of each sip. Really well done.  MF: The mouthfeel of this beer is spot on for what it's supposed to be. Just enough body to bring out the flavors of the beer, but dry enough to stay within the style of a West Coast DIPA. The beer coats the mouth nicely, allowing for all of the different tastes to showcase themselves before leaving a perfectly dry and bitter finish.  O: I can see why this beer is considered legendary. I'm under the assumption that a bottle of this sweet nectar runs for $6.50 a pop, and if that's true...I'm moving to the left coast. I'd drink a bottle of this every day if I could. Well worth the hype, and thanks to a CA connection, I can get this once a year. One of the best IPA's, DIPA's, and beers that I've ever had.

Although I like a good IPA as much as the next guy, I wonder how much of this is just hype that builds on itself as more and more people review these particular beers. A few months ago I was privileged enough to try Heady Topper. Although it was very good, I couldn't possibly rate it as high as most people do. I feel the same way about Pliny the Elder.  A good pale ale to me is very clean and crisp. The malt base just serves as a barely noticeable background to let the hops shine through. Pliny definitely fits this profile but because of my individual tastes I can't rank it above many of the imperial stouts that I love so much. I can't even say for sure that it is the best IPA I have ever had without doing a side by side comparison.

In body the beer is crystal clear and clean, but does present a slight haze from the malt. On the nose, the beer smells of citrus and spicy pine. Floral and herbal notes dance around the edges of the nose but big citrus tangerine and grapefruit are the primary players in the beer. The nose is not blowing me away, but is just a very solid example of a hoppy beer dank pine and a touch of sweet caramel can also be sensed in the smell. As a whole, the smell tends to remind a little of a fresh pineapple blended with pine. On the tongue, the beer tastes surprisingly balanced. The bitters are big and coat the mouth, but there is a strong bready sweetness to add balance. Light stone fruit notes can be picked out in the hop character, as well. The finish sees the strongest bitter kick, which is a bit over powering and should feed any one’s bitter cravings. Acidity in the beer is light but bright on the sides of the cheeks. Again, this beer tastes like a classic DIPA. In flavor, the beer begins as sweet, candied citrus, expanding into fresh Florida oranges, with a touch of orange peel and rind. Grapefruit, pine needles, and pineapple dance in the back along with the malts superbly balanced sweet caramel bread, which helps to give the hops their candied quality. I wasn’t that taken with this beer on the initial sip, but that was foolish of me. Pliny is a subtle beast, building simple complexity from its hops, and making each sip different. Soft boozy heat can be felt in the back of the throat, but that is just another part of the complexity of this beer. This flavor is one I could sip all night. In the mouth, Pliny feels surprisingly on the light side of medium in body, with a fluffy carbonation that pillows the tongue nicely. Mouthfeel is slick, and crisp, making the beer dangerously easy to drink. Slight astringency can be felt as the beer moves across the tongue leaving the mouth only softly tingling with bitters. Saliva does gently pool in the cheeks, but overall the mouth is left rather clean and ready for further sips. Overall, this beer is a whale worthy of whaling after. Beautiful complexity and subtly make this a beer I could drink several of, which is dangerous for its ABV bracket. Where many of the modern DIPA’s slam you in the face with juicy hop character, Pliny is subtle and perfectly balanced. This will please the hop heads and even those that are skeptical to hops. My mother, a diehard stout fan, but “pale and hoppy beer” hater, actually loved this when I brought one over last night. My only complaint is that the nose is mild compared to some DIPA’s, but to be fair to Pliny, its recipe was developed before the designers of those other DIPA’s even knew they liked hops. Pliny the Elder is a pleasure to drink. I can’t wait to get my hands on more Russian River beers.",Russian River Brewing Company,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,100
863,7971,jdb288,3.89,"Bottle. Pours liquid gold with light head. Aroma is citrus and pine, some tropical fruit. Taste is tart apple, bright hop, resin. So well balanced (did that need to be said?). Short, clean finish. This is an amazing beer. Need to try the Younger for comparison.",Russian River Brewing Company,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,100
863,7971,Sm00thHoperator,4.83,"Full of pine and tropical fruits this beer captures the essence of what a American west coast DIPA is all about! One of my favorites!  Mouth feel is soft and balanced with the creation of malt and hops combined.  The appearance is almost a sunset orange my favorite colors on a DIPA.  No taste of the 8% abv and that super bitter hop bite or spice that sometimes turns your average beer drinker off to ipas, which is why I think this beer is so highly rated.",Russian River Brewing Company,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,100
863,7971,ANIMOUL,4.5,"Not much more to say than what's already been said; this is legit. Balanced is the best word to describe; everything - appearance, smell, taste, etc - was just 'right'.  Very hard to find in SD area. I only came upon a bottle when conversating with the beer store clerk about Port's 'Santa's Little Helper' when he let it slip that he had a 'stash' in the back. Curiously, he decided to sell me a bottle...  The shit's good... seek it, drink it, enjoy!",Russian River Brewing Company,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,100
863,7971,Moheban,4.5,"Have had it several times, but it's my first review of it. Poured out of a bottle into Russian river pint glass. Nice frothy looking head but thinned out fairly quick. Aroma is citrusy, grapefruit, very juicy, has some pine too. Tastes like the nose. very smooth and well balanced with the malt. Dont taste any of the alcohol. Overall, I think this is a fantastic DIPA, one of the first and best of its kind. Though slightly overrated, I think the high rating reflects the fact that this came out before most of the newer solid DIPAs in its class. I definitely don't think it's a top 5 beer , or even a top 5 DIPA anymore, but I'm sure it was both of these things just a few years ago. Now that competition in the DIPA arena has gotten tighter, there are so many other worthy competitors to pliny.",Russian River Brewing Company,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,100
863,7971,ONovoMexicano,4.63,"Picked up a few bottles at Toronado in early December 2013. Poured into a Samuel Smith pint glass.  A- Produces a gigantic head of four plus fingers that remains long after the pour... Head is foamy and forms into a peak with a plateau above a copper and golden liquid... There's a lot of carbonation swirling around in the beer... It's beautiful.  S- A blast of piney hops with some citrusy undertones. It gives a wallop of resinous hops with some spiciness and smells of the forest.  T- Very much like the nose, this is citrusy and piney, but with an excellent sweet malt balance. The hops have a spicy zest to them.  M- The beer drinks incredibly smoothly, but there's a lot of bitterness that is well-balanced by a creamy middle. The end is bitter and dry, but still mellow and easy to handle.  O- A masterfully done DIPA... Smooth, creamy, hopped up yet balanced and offering plenty of sweet maltiness.",Russian River Brewing Company,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,100

Flavor is grapefruit, pine and grassy, bitter n the front end and crisp. Mouthfeel is nicely balanced and carbonated. Solid but over rated n my opinion",Russian River Brewing Company,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,100
863,7971,CassinoNorth,4.5,"Appearance- Aggressive pour yields a nice thick head that lingers as a 1 cm head forever. Love the look...this is where Pliny excels vs HT. Really nice clean golden hue. Perfect look for a double IPA.  Smell- Big citrus bomb with a nice resiny piney type smell. A hop head's dream in here.  Taste- Like Heady, wave after wave of hoppy deliciousness. A couple waves of piney hop bitterness only to be taken away by a balance of bready sweetness. A bit of alcohol in the finish, doesn't diminish the beer though.  moutheel- Clean, I can easily polish off two or three pints of this before I realize what hit me. Nice dryness on the mouth begs for another sip.  Overall- The quintessential west coast double IPA for a reason. Every hop head needs to try this at least once in their lifetime. I believe I do prefer eastern style a bit more, but this is fantastic overall. A top 10 double IPA for sure.",Russian River Brewing Company,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,100
863,7971,BoldRulerVT,4.29,"My big thanks to my good friend Derek for bringing this bottle back from Cali for me. Poured into a Prohibition Pig snifter and split with my wife. Appearance is a really nice medium amber, clear and clean with one finger of white frothy head. Smell was moderate hops with a base of light roasted malts. Taste was a very clean, very nicely balanced flavor of hops (non citrusy) and lightly roasted malts. Mouthfeel was clean, crisp and refreshing. Overall, this is a very well crafted beer.  Being a Vermonter and drinking Heady, Double Sunshine and Hill Farmstead's IPAs on a regular basis I feel my palate is a bit different than many others who may view Pliny as possibly the best beer in the world. I feel Pliny was delicious and very well crafted. However, my palate felt that the hop presence was insufficient and the complexity I was hoping would be there, frankly was largely missing.  I don't believe all DIPAs need to be hop bombs, not at all. But I was hoping Pliny would have a similar hop presence to some of my Vermont DIPAs. I found Pliny's hop presence to be very mild in comparison. I feel Pliny the Elder has a profile similar to some of the more mild Stone IPAs than the Vermont IPAs I drink more regularly.",Russian River Brewing Company,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,100
863,7971,berlinabb,4.47,"Smells like cannabis in a glass when fresh. Not worth drinking if it's more than a month old. So much fresh hops in here to count or even make sense of.  Pliny has long been regarded as the best Double IPA around, however competition is fierce this days and there are more than a few breweries that can give it a run for it's money (Alpine, Societe...)  Bottom line, Pliny will always hold a special place in our hearts because it was the first and it is a damn good beer.",Russian River Brewing Company,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,100

Smell: Smells dank. 3 week old bottle. Sweet juicy hops, citrus, grapefruit, bread. It doesn't jump out of the glass but it's all there.  Taste - Taste mirrors the nose. It's not bursting with flavor but it's very balanced and that's what I like about it. It's not very bitter (a plus for me). Just really well rounded.  Mouthfeel: Light-medium mouthfeel. No booze at all in the taste.  Overall: Overall, a really great balanced IPA. Is it the best IPA ever? Nope. But it's really good.",Russian River Brewing Company,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,100
863,7971,PJ60,4.93,The folks at Russian River never cease to amaze me. Pliny sets the bar for all others. You could spend your remaining years searching for something better but you keep coming back.

I've tried to brew a clone of this 3 times now (because I can't get it in NY without trading for it) and it never comes close. This beer is pure genius.  When you pour this beer you'll see it's very clear and has good head. The smell is like nothing you have ever smelled. It's so aromatic, citrusy and piney. The taste is very smooth and floral. This is a double IPA, but it's not bitter at all and seems to use less malt than other dipas. It's perfection in a bottle, the fresher the better it is. Don't age this beer!

863,7971,McStagger,4.18,"Re review! Brother was just in Santa Rosa and picked me up a sixer as an early bday.  Brewed on 11/15/13.  A: Pours a marvelously clear brassy golden. Finger and a half of very creamy head. Excellent retention. Carbonation is lively, with tiny bubbles racing to the surface. Very fine bottle conditioning sediment in the beer. Barely noticeable at first.  S: Citrus is the name of the game here. Lots of grapefruit, with orange and some lemon. Malt sweetness is there, but this beer is definitely lacking the malted characteristic of most double IPA's. Smells clean and crisp.  T: Smooth, refined and sharp flavors here. Nothing is out of place. Everything is balanced, even if it's to the lighter and crisper side of the style. Big grapefruit peel bitterness comes off the front that lingers into an oily resinous that lasts the duration of the experience. Malt puts up a token resitance of cracker and slightly toffee sweetness. No alcohol present.  M: Definitely the star of this show. Sleek, on point and crisp. Not at all flabby, but in no way over carbonated. This one is built for speed.  O: One of the more difficult reviews I have written. I look at the pedigree and esteem that this beer has and I just don't get it. It's a great brew. Were this a single tier IPA I'd be giving it a nearly perfect rating. As is, it lacks the evocative, powerful aromatics and bracing bitterness of the really top tiered DIPA's. This one is crisp, balanced, refined and very drinkable, which isn't necessarily a good thing considering it's 8% abv. It is immaculately crafted, but I think it misses the marks for the style.",Russian River Brewing Company,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,100
863,7971,SaisonRichBiere,4.14,"Poured from a bottle into a 12oz. pilsner glass.  Bottle was 19 days old when poured.  Appearance- Crystal clear yellow with a bunch of fizzy bubbles at first, but subsided to a good half-inch head. Surprising in its clarity- looked like any full flavor American adjunct brew in the glass.  Smell- Big citrus, crisp hops, pine resin, huge tropical fruit notes, finishing dank and aromatic. This is strong. Amarillo and Citra hop fruitiness.  Taste- All hops, all the time. Big citrusy swell, followed by hop oil bitterness, finishing out a tiny bit sweet, and with only the slightest malt detection as the flavor dies out. Not much malt to speak of at all.  Mouthfeel- Clean and crisp as the appearance would suggest. Not at all heavy or syrupy like some imperial IPAs can be.  Overall- Hop forward beer. Hop juice almost. This beer was great, in that it provides a straight up appreciation of hops and hop character in the beer. Remarkable even- that it has almost no malt presence. Amazingly flavorful for how clear, clean, and crisp it is, but I expected more from this given the hype surrounding it. Despite all of the great flavors, I found it one-dimensional, and not at all complex, with no malt to hop balance. Not that these elements need to always be in balance for the style- I just tend to appreciate a more well-rounded beer. One of the greats nonetheless!

Poured from a 510 ml bottle with the bottled on date (10/3/13) clearly found on the label into a snifter and got 1 finger of head. The bottle says to consume ASAP.  A: Pours a bright golden, copper color and I get 1 finger of dense head the dissipates at a moderate rate and leaves a heavy covering on the top of my glass and the a covering and collar on my glass.  S: Big floral smell from a foot out. Tropical fruit and ruby red grapefruit.  T: Complex. This is not just an onslaught of pine resin; this is an interesting taste of mango, pear, and smooth mild ruby red grapefruit. It is just beautiful and tasty.  M: Refreshing and makes me want another sip. Medium-bodied and highly carbonated. Still, it is more smooth than having the feeling of a spritz.  O: Well, if I lived in the bay area; this would be a staple for me. I would have it often. I like it and recommend it. I don't think it is over-hyped like Dogfish Head 90 Minute IPA is.

So today I got to try it again as it is part of the hop fest at my local watering hole in Bucks co PA. What a let down. Poured a murky orange amber with barely any head. The aroma I remember was quite fragrant not today. The taste was hoppy and bitter with a balanced malt and hop taste but not nearly the hop bomb from days past. I feel sorry for all those people who drank it for the first time today, they definitely are not getting the best or freshest. Perhaps todays hoppy IPA's have caught up to this one time phemnom making pliny well ordinary. I'll try it again with an open mind when the oppertunity arises.

I heard everything from it being the Holy Grail of beers to it being the most overhyped beer ever. All I knew was that I wanted to try it. After searching I was able to find a shop that would deliver to NY, so I ordered 2 bottles of the elder, 2 blind pigs and Redemption. Figured why not make it a RR care pack lol. Well...  Appearance: Liquid gold. Golden in color with a nice white head about a finger thick. Had a very fresh, refreshing look to it.  Smell: Extremely floral nose, fruity, citrusy, some pine. It was a very pronounced nose.  Taste: Okay...all the people that told me it was overhyped either lied to me and they never actually tried it or they are closet fans pissed off that its not readily available near us. This is what it's all about. A beautiful assault of citrus and pine, hops, hops, hops charge with a solid bitterness that balances out with slight malts, but nothing that takes away from the awesome flavors.  Mouthfeel: clean, fresh, smooth and did I mentioned fresh. Slick enough to hit the palate and give you all the flavors without shredding it.  Overall: It absolutely is the most well balanced beer I've tasted to date. It's clean, refreshing, the perfect amount of bitterness, it is amazing and I couldn't wait to jump in to that second bottle. I've had Pliny now and I have had heady as well. They are pretty much neck and neck but I must admit that I enjoy Pliny a tad bit more. It's a little cleaner tasting and a tad bit more balanced.

The hop flavor is met with some clean, crisp malt and fades out into a big, bitter and dry finish. Pine and citrus rind notes linger on the palate for some time.

Mouthfeel is good, neither to thick or thin, with a little lingering resin.  The end result is just right, but somehow less than the sum of its parts.

Like all of my favorite beers, the hallmark to this one is balance. Hop notes are bright; the age of this beer is telling. At it's youngest, it pops and sizzles, nearly overpowering your palate with hop brightness; but you take the first sip, and it reveals the complexity of the malts. The underlying hints of sweetness recall fresh-cut lawns, and the superb finish demonstrates attention to detail.  As it ages, the beer loses hop brightness (duh!) but retains its malt characteristics, and you can sense the real depth of the flavors that Russian River has built in. Even aged beyond its hops, it's a great beer.",Russian River Brewing Company,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,100

Straight off the bat, it seems as though there may be an unpleasant bitterness to the taste and this may be due to a grapefruit-ness aroma. There are full piney notes and also a strong coriander scent. There are also beautiful notes of grapefruit that does not overpower, but accentuates both the piney notes and coriander scents. It is phenomenal. End of story.  T: The bitterness completely disintegrates as it passes through the tongue and you swallow the liquid gold. The piney notes definitely come into fruition just as it hits your tongue, but then the grapefruit notes creeps up on you. Hoppy yet not overpowering. The bitterness aftertaste fades away, just as a grapefruit would. Flawless.  M: Bold and crispy. The carbonation is not overpowering at all and just enough to keep it refreshing and enough to clean the palate to get me ready for the next sip of this golden perfection.  O: Wow... just wow.

A - Looks like any world class IPA, doesn't stand out in appearance as much as Heady. Still a beautiful looking DIPA. Pale, Cloudy orangish color. Lacing is amazing.  S - Can smell the fresh piney hops and abundance of fruits with some flowers.  T - Citrus hops with the hoppy piney taste that is not overpowering.  M - On draft and for a DIPA the mouthfeel was amazing, perfect level of carbonation  O - One of the best DIPA's i've had. Would put it right up there with Heady Topper. Wish i could try Pliny The Younger to compare.  Too bad I live out of Cali and out of the northeast where my top two DIPA's are made. Hopefully someday the distribution reaches out of cali and out of the NorthWest. Until then I will have to wait.",Russian River Brewing Company,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,100

Some tropical fruits, grapefruit predominantly.  Appearance- Pours a bright golden hue. A solid 1/2 inch of sudsy head. Good lacing throughout the session.  Taste - Big hop profile with lots of pine. There is very subtle notes of tropical fruits, just like the smell; Grapefruit, mango etc. The amount of hops is balanced with a bready malt.  Mouthfeel - Moderate carbonation. There is a good bitterness that sticks to the mouth. A slight sweetness that I could feel in my teeth a little  Overall - A very good DIPA. Not the best that I have had, but definitely one of the best. There was some good flavors there, but nothing too crazy. The flavors came out the more that I drank it. It actually got better and better as I went. I was happy to finally try this one and was not let down.

It's a must have whenever it's on tap and a take home when your local craft beer store has it in stock.  Taste: The ""piney"" taste is existent right from the beginning and the hoppiness is perfectly balanced. This is one of those that you just take your time with and enjoy.

863,7971,chickenflea,4.37,"Bottled. Courtesy of Jim - huge thanks. Clear orange pour with a foamy white head. What sets this beer apart is the massive fresh hop aroma. Incredible. I smell pine mostly, but my wife says floral. Probably a little of both. It's the oily richness of the aroma that counts. Good solid IPA flavor. Very smooth. Bitterness balances with the massive malty backbone. Earthy finish. Warming after a few sips. Overall a wonderful double.",Russian River Brewing Company,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,100

On the nose is wonderfully fresh citrus. Huge, fresh grapefruit. Mango and tangerine. Lemon zest. Just wonderful. Huge hop nose with some earthy tones beneath the citrus.  Taste mirrors the nose. Massive grapefruit tones and wonderfully bitter hops. Lemon zest and tangerine come through on the middle of the taste. Just fantastic. Crisp, clean finish with a big bitter punch on the back of the tongue. As I let the beer warm, some spicy notes begin to appear from the hops. Very complex and delicious IPA.  Mouthfeel is light with creamy carbonation. Really keeps the flavors moving and alive in your mouth. Delightful and refreshing.  What a beautifully brewed DIPA. Would absolutely drink again. Definitely worth seeking out.",Russian River Brewing Company,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,100

863,7971,stella77artois,4.45,"20 oz. bottle poured into a wine glass.  A - Pours an amber, with more yellow shining through the light. Approximately 1"" head formed after a slightly aggressive pour. Small amount of lacing stuck to the glass. Thin white head stuck around for the duration of sipping.  S - Lot's of malt and hops up front. Hops are a mix of bitter and floral. Once it warmed a bit, I noticed grapefruit and bitter flower aromas. Could also detect a bit of dankness, and the very slight cat piss smell some DIPA's have. Very nice smelling beer.  T - Yum yum yum. More malty and not as fruity as Heady (they're ""rival"" beers so it makes sense to compare), but it's not too far behind. A lot of bitter hops up front, as well as slightly sweet and carapils malts. As with the aroma, grapefruit becomes noticeable as it warms slightly, as does the dark/bitter floral taste. The malt and hops are very smooth. Doesn't have an extreme bite, which isn't a bad thing. A general bitterness that leads to slight fruitiness. Also a very slight lemon-lime citrus flavor in the aftertaste.  F - Doesn't feature the dry bite that many DIPA's do, which is the main reason why this beer is so drinkable. Has a good fizz feeling on the tongue and throat, so it can certainly be refreshing. Would be dangerous, but I could certainly session with this brew. Just a slight mouth coating, assuming from the carapils malt.  O - Won't overtake Heady on my list, but it battles Cafe Racer 15 as my second favorite DIPA. Bitter hops and tasty, smooth malts are the strength of this beer. Not as complicated as other DIPA's, but the perfect balance of hoppy bitterness and slight malty sweetness make this an outstanding DIPA. It certainly deserves the praise it gets.

Poured half bottle of it gently out of the bottle into a glass., drank then follow with second half slightly warmer. Initially no head, but still it started to slowly foam up and form a slight head. Scents of pine and citrus, the way it smells is actually quite incredible because it carries on the second pour as the beer warms. First taste and there's more citrus along with some sweetness that hides a lot of hop. Balances well and is not overpowering.

Smell was spectacular. Super strong aromas! Piney with strong tropical fruit, grapefruit, peach and orange. Booziness became more noticeable as it warmed.  Big pine, big grapefruit, big orange, some tropical fruit, and mild booze (especially as warmed). Huge resinous pine on the finish.  Mouthfeel was creamy with crisp carbonation. Medium body. Slightly dry finish.  Overall a really good beer - not so much for the taste, but for the superior quality of all its other parts. Good balance and character.

863,7971,tkdchampxi,4.39,"Edit*  My first review of this beer was just a plain 4.75 score without a written review.  Upon my second tasting of this beer, I have to say that Pliny can seriously suffer in quality based on how it is kept or served.  Pliny is Pliny, and if you've had it before, you know how good it can be.  Both times I had it, it was on tap at special beer events. The first time I had it, about three weeks ago, it was juicy, citrusy, hoppy, and delicious. The second time I had it, yesterday, a lot of the hop profile that made it so amazing had deteriorated. As I understand it, both pours came from the same batch at Russian River, and both pours were from recently tapped kegs. Nonetheless, yesterday's pour was significantly worse. It had all of the same hop and initial flavors at the fore, but it had lost so much if its special quality off the back end.  It was still good, but it wasn't better than the uber-fresh Victory Dirtwolf that I had it side-by-side with. For a pour of Pliny, it was honestly disappointing.",Russian River Brewing Company,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,100

Perfect carbonation, just an experience that is especially rare in my parts  M: cliche, but smooth, meaning that from fist sip to aftertaste is extremely pleasant.

Small carbonation bubbles can be seen rising from the bottom of the glass, evenly distributed throughout the beer.  The beer smells like you are walking through a pine forest in the early morning and hints at the amazing, complex taste that is about to follow. Smells like dank, resiny-pine, with sweet fruity notes. I let it sit for a while and the smell of alcohol became more noticeable.  Upon the first taste, I receive an immediate blast of pine & citrus, with a smooth, somewhat bitter, finish on the back of my palate. As I continued to taste, the bitterness faded and Pliny became smoother, fruitier & the booze more noticeable. The amazing taste lingers on the palate and leaves you wanting just one more taste.

Sure, there are a lot of other more EXTREME DIPA's and even IPA's out there now, but Pliny is just so damn drinkable, and consistent, every single time. It really took until the second or third time I had it to really appreciate it against all the other hoppy beers I've had. Actually, the first time I had it ON TAP, at the brewpub, was the real revelation for me.

In my opinion, the beer hits the right balance of sweet flavor, piney perfection, and IPA bitterness.

Smell: The aromas definitely give out hints of citrus, pineapple, grapefruit, peaches and a bunch of dank pine resins. I can't even smell any malts cause the hops are just so overpowering. Love it.  Taste: Like the aromas, it has a definite tropical character with alot of citrus and grapefruit, some pineapple, alot of pine resins and dank hops. This is a real hop bomb!  Mouthfeel: It has a low/medium carbonation with a very nice overall balance and feel.  Drinkability: It's a very smooth drinkable beer accompanied with great flavors and aromas.

The flavor was very bitter pine up front, moving to a nice orangey/grapefruity citrus flavor, followed by a nice sweet malty aftertaste - phenomenally well balanced.

Balanced by a sweet center and rounded out with well-executed pine. Mouthfeel is velvety soft, but still effervescent.  Overall, PtE is smooth and well restrained.

Bottled on 6/25/13.  A: 4.5 Bright gold with 2+ fingers of white frothy head that reduces slowly and leaves some lacing. Leaves a fair amount of head floating on the top throughout drinking the glass. S: 4.25 I will be the first to admit that the aroma on this has probably lost quite a bit due to bottle date vs consumption date. When I score fresh Pliny I will be sure to rereview and adjust as need be. At this point, the aroma is a really good blend of citrusy and piney. Nothing really takes lead, it's all around complex and balanced. T: 4.0 Similar to smell, very complex and balanced. However with taste I am getting pine in the front, with floraly citrus in the background. M: 3.75 Relatively low carb level for the style. At least low compared to what I'm accustomed to in like beers. Very smooth mouthfeel, and a semi-dry aftertaste. 0: 4.0 I am somewhat disappointed due to all the hype, but with the understanding that the fresher the better. I look forward to getting this one more fresh. I think this is definitely a solid DIPA, very complex, and well balanced.  ***edit/rereview.

863,7971,gigaknight,3.25,"A- Pours a totally transparent and luminous orange hue, capped with a solid finger of bright white head. Even as the foam dissipates, remnants of head form a halo on the edges of the glass and a light lacing on the surface of the beer.  S- Mellow yet radiant hop character greets the nose, rich in tones of overripe orange, apricot, canned peaches, and a light grassiness. Some tropical elements outline the aroma, suggesting hints of papaya and underripe banana. Just a bit of alcohol comes through, followed by wisps of very light malt.  T- A moderate piney bitterness takes up the forefront of the palate, supported by a cacophony of esters and a very faintly citrusy hop character. I'm surprised at the ratio of hop bitterness to hop flavor, as the bitterness is pleasant, but seems to overshadow the flavor of the hops. The flavors that do come through, however, are largely orange-like in nature, mostly the fresh juice and just a hint of the zest. The dry and rather assertive alpha acids carry straight through the finish and linger for some time on the palate after the sip is swallowed. The bitterness is beginning to strike me as more herbal than piney.  M- The mouthfeel is relatively light, featuring moderate carbonation. The brew errs on the dry side, with seemingly little residual sugar hanging around. The finish is crisp and the flavor lingers, but it isn't sticky. The 8% alcohol is barely noticeable, if at all.  O- In my opinion, this is a solid DIPA, but I'm baffled as to how it's maintained a perfect 100. I fear this is a case of opinions being distorted by the simple fact that this beer is as rare and revered as it is. Your mileage may vary, but I can think of a half-dozen DIPAs I favor over this one, some of which being dramatically easier to acquire. I say if you come across it, go ahead and satisfy your curiosity. But you certainly won't find me booking a flight to the Russian River valley to find any more of the stuff.  *I ought to mention that I opened this bottle 16 days after it was bottled, so I don't believe that its character could have deteriorated enough in that time to explain my lackluster opinion of the brew.",Russian River Brewing Company,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,100

Decent clarity, head and retention  S: Pine and apricot/citrus. Not hit you over the head strong but there and pleasing  T: Very refined balance of pine/citrus and drinkability. Honestly for a beer that rates a ""100"" I find it a bit over-rated - not to say it isn't a terrific beer which it certainly is and superbly crafted, but I didn't find it as distinctive as some other IIPA's I've had. Still an excellent excellent beer  M: Flawless finish and hop forward malt backbone  O: A superb IIPA, but not all that. Perhaps that's the nice thing about it - it isn't trying to hard to impress or make a statement, just a great example of a well-rendered brew.",Russian River Brewing Company,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,100
863,7971,mtahce,4.65,"My favorite double IPA. Great balance of flavor between malt and hops. Aroma is nectar like and doesn't flood the senses. Awesome sweet finish that doesn't leave any bitterness.

I realize that this doesn't mean much, but it's really what I'm looking for the style. Unfortunately, nothing about this is unique to me. I guess RR was the one to define the style, so the beer is perfect in that regard.  Nice and bitter. Crisp, with some tropical sweetness. To me, this beer is about the pine flavor, although I'm sure some beg to differ. A pretty big malty backbone. Perfectly balanced with the bitterness.  Mouthfeel is medium and crisp. A little resin after each sip.  Overall this is a delicious iipa. I don't feel like it's in the same category (or league) as east coast iipas, but it defines the bitter style.

863,7971,KYGunner,3.79,"Very pretty color of light radiant gold fills the snifter as a loosely built, fizzy head sets atop. The complexion is more reminiscent of a wine than an ale but it certainly looks good.  The aromas are earthy and natural with a grassy, mossy, floral and even cannabis leaf scent. Around the edges grapefruit makes an appearance.  I'm guessing this holds a lot of Simcoe hops as I'm bombarded with deep vegetative, leafy, mossy and yes, cannabis, flavors. The hops certainly stand out but it's not the flavors I desire in an IPA. It is properly complex with a lot earthy tones but again not desirable.

863,7971,utopiajane,3.96,"This pours a dark banana yellow, slight haze, golden honey color with a creamy soft white head that fell slowly and left really great lace. The nose took a while to fully realize itself. It had a light pineapple and a light pine. Pale malt and lightly breaddy. Hop resins even on the nose. Hop floral and a sweet honey with the malt. There was no alcohol on the nose but there was a nice deep round hop scent.  Taste was silky and smooth. The malt is soft but firm and very well done. it had a lightness to the body and a sweet bread that never took center stage away from the tremendous hop qualities. Fruits were fleeting on the palate. The pineapple gave way to tart grapefruit, then a little apple and pear showed up to add crispness and a touch of sweetness. Right in the middle it became bone dry and chalky. It had the taste of astringency or of an aspirin you chewed by mistake. Bitter hops flourished and this was delightful. They had a tiny bit of oil to deposit them along the palate and reside finally at the back. Light pine and a touch of malt. The resins are also light and they do their job keeping all those flavors lingering for a nice full aftertaste of a substantial bitter and the sweetness of the fruits. There was an alcohol warmth at the back of the throat but nothing hard from it on the palate.  This beer was great but in my opinion it did not live up to all the hype. It was rousing with a well done bitter, it had a malt that was one of the best I have seen but it lacked definition in the fruits. It couldn't have been prettier to look at. Not the best I have ever had but I am glad I tried it and would drink it again but I won't kill myself trying to get more. It was stronger then you might expect and I liked that.

Being from Chicago, looking forward to my first taste of Pliny. Smell was okay. didn't get the pine smell others mention. Taste is best described as boring. I didn't get any hop bite or tingling or malt sweetness. Definitely easy drinking but that's not what I'm looking for in an 8.0 abv beer.

Not much lacing but that may be more because of the shaker pint it was served in. Aroma is big and fruity, lots of grapefruit, pine, and lemon. Grapefruit and pineapple hit the front of the tongue. Finishes dry. Mouthfeel can best be described as smooth, medium-light bodied with light carbonation, drinks much easier than its 8% ABV.

863,7971,JasonLovesBeer,4.76,"My very first Russian River experience - no availability here in BC, but was recently in OR. Background: IPA's are actually a ways down the list of my favourite styles. I am a gueuze / lambic / saison guy by summer and imperial stout and belgian quad guy by winter. I still drink a wide variety of big IPA's just because they are so plentiful over the warm months and it's not like I don't like them or anything.  Nose: I expected to smell this beer pretty fast upon opening just based on its stats and legacy. Sure enough, it didn't take long before big citrus and deep, deep earthy notes pricked my nose. Brisk pine primary notes, with grapefruit citrus not far behind and floral notes in the background.  Taste: First impression is this a thick, full bodied IPA. It has the kind of body you expect from a quad, or even stout. Huge, rich bitterness of pine wood, earth, maybe a little bark. The important adjective is rich - the flavours are deep and encompassing. The citrus / floral qualities from the nose are back there somewhere but mostly it's just fresh, earthy hops flavour preserved and presented grandiosely.  Finish: The pine-like hops and warming effect last and last and last. I know the alcohol is playing a big role here, but you don't taste the alcohol itself.  Balance: Man, this is the part where Pliny I am sure gets its reputation. It's all hops here - it's not hoppy with a bready malt backbone, it's not hops with a little bit of alcohol prickling. It's just plain hops. I feel like in any other instance this would mean the balance isn't right, it's too much bitter and not enough body. However, in Pliny there is in fact plenty of malt, and it plus the alcohol work hard to do great things, and they do it completely anonymously - you don't notice them, they are behind the curtain, but they are boosting the hops so it can be all it can be.  Conclusion: If I were to search for something negative to say about Pliny the Elder, I'd say that the hops isn't particularly complex. I've had big IPA's with a lot more going on flavour-wise. In reality though, I know this isn't really a bad thing at all - the hops flavour is fresh and great, and thus complexity isn't going to improve the beer necessarily. I've never had an IPA before with the elegant balance and big body that Pliny has, glad I got the opportunity to do so.",Russian River Brewing Company,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,100

863,7971,BergBeer,4.75,"Look: Transparent gold with a very active white head! Lots of legs keep the head up high. Very active beer!  Smell: Pungent waves of pine, citrus, and fresh hops flow from the bottle as soon as I popped the cap. This beer is dank with a huge hop presence that clings to the nostrils. Getting pine, lemon zest, orange, more pine, a nice sweet malt with a touch of sweet honey but mostly sweet dank hops! I could live in that bottle.  Taste: Big citrus hops on the attack which is surprising given the amount if pine on the nose. Then comes a huge simcoe/centennial rush followed by a sweet malt with slight honey that holds this massive amount of flavor on its back. Then come a resurgence of piney hops on the finish to wrap things up in on very tasty, delicate, and beautiful hand crafted package. Awesome.  Mouthfeel: Sits medium on the tongue with a slight hop stickiness on the teeth. Coats the whole mouth and goes down smooth. No hint of ABV.  Overall: This is one beautiful DIPA. Every part of this beer pleases the senses and it manages to be a big hoppy west coast DIPA and yet still be balanced and ridiculously drinkable. A lot of craftsmanship went into this beer and you can tell. Deserves it's place on the top of American IPAs and is worth the general pain it is to find!",Russian River Brewing Company,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,100
863,7971,BalancingBrooms,4.6,"8/12/22 Golden to straw with one finger white head. Nose is full of grapefruit, slight pine, berries, and pale malt. Taste follows the nose with a well balanced mix of citrus, pine, berries, pineapple, tangerine, that folds into a pale malt, and ends with a balanced dank to sappy bitterness. Body is light to medium with similar carbonation. Ends in a perfect combo for dry, bitter, and crisp. Overall this is an incredibly balanced beer that is so easy to drink. To be honest I’ve had IIPAs that are bigger and bolder but none this well balanced. Is it what I remember from 9 years ago? Not sure, other than remembering it was so well balanced. Now that I have access to this regularly, it’ll work it’s way into my regular rotation",Russian River Brewing Company,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,100

It was served in a room temp glass and the beer was not all that cold. I guarantee this had a negative effect on the taste. For all the hype this beer gets I have to say that there are better beers out there. Russian River makes it so difficult to get a hold of and people perceive that as being a good thing. It's not. There are better beers out there people. Love the beer, dislike the breweries tactics.",Russian River Brewing Company,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,100
863,7971,jshusc,4.56,"Able to snag one of these from Krisp in San Diego. Thought about shipping it to myself, but it was already cold and I wanted it as fresh as possible. As a result, I had the bartender at the Courtyard Marriott give me a room temperature pint glass (not optimal, but what was available) and poured myself a nice one.  A: 3/4 inch head with a few sips left in the bottle. Darker gold with thick white head, typical of, if not optimal for, a good Imperial IPA.  S: Big, bold hops jump out and some citrus packed in their to balance. Excellent nose.  T: Lives up to the hype. Balance comparable if not better than Hopslam. A little alcohol burn that is appropriate for the bigger IPAs, but nice citrus to keep away any lingering effects. Well done.  Overall, this beer lives up to the hype. I went to san diego with one thought in mind: find a Pliny. Since I did, I figured it was the perfect beer for my first review. Really enjoyed it, and did not find that it was too built up in my mind, which is common for the ""white whale"" beers.",Russian River Brewing Company,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,100
863,7971,Jangles,4.33,"Had this on tap in a nice 17 oz mug at Hollingshead's yesterday, and had one with a sandwich at the same place last month (also on tap in a mug).  Yesterday, I sampled (1 oz) the Alesmith IPA just before this, and I am glad I did, as I remembered that as a nice, bright, hoppy IPA. The Pliny after that was just bursting with flavor and frankly put the Alesmith to shame, making it taste like a light beer.  I'm not an expert like many here, but I'll say that this was a delicious beer. I sat at the counter and sipped this bad boy for a while, and really enjoyed it.  It had a cloudy, honey-colored appearance and a minimal head. The pine notes were up front, but not overwhelming. Nothing about the beer was overdone, not the bitterness, not the alcohol. Just an extremely well-balanced and tasty beer.  I'm not the kind of guy to seek out a beer, or to wait in line for one, but if this becomes available again, I will definitely have one. It was perfect alone and when I had it with the sandwich. Definitely not my usual summer beer, and not something I'd drink every day, but I can certainly appreciate the craftmanship.",Russian River Brewing Company,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,100
863,7971,Libationguy,4.77,"Bottling Date: 06.25.13  Brilliant deep gold color with a bright white rocky head. Two fingers on the head with long retention. Brisk carbonation and delicate lacing visible in the glass.  Grapefruit zest, fresh pine needles in spring, fresh pine sap, delicate white flowers. Very clean on the nose and totally focused on hops.  Wonderfully clean on the entry. Vibrant hop notes all pine and sap. Very clean without much of a resinous quality on the palate. Firm but balanced bitterness all the way through with a long finish.  Full bodied beer with a rich warm mouthfeel. Alcohol is nicely balanced in the overall profile of the beer. Maybe just a touch too much carbonation makes the beer just a little edgy on the palate.  If you are looking for a West Coat DIPA, this beer is superb. Somehow they manage to get the beer to focus almost completely on hops without it being out of balance. If they could sneak in just a little bit of counterpoint and ease off the carbonation just a touch, the beer would be perfect. Definitely worth a special trip to get your hands on this beer.

When something is hyped this month it is hard to really enjoy it, but this really is the standard by which all other West Coast DIPAs are judged and rightly so. It was already almost two months old, so I must say I don't think I have had the full experience, but man...

863,7971,mverity,4.85,"My second Pliny, but first since 2009 and first full review. This bottle is courtesy of Eduardo. Pliny looks amazing. A perfect yellow/amber/pale orange color with half an inch of white bubbly head. It has fantastic lacing as well. Sticky globules that hang onto the sides of the tulip. Aroma is wonderful too. Very floral and sweet. I love the hop balance. Lots of orange scents, with maybe a touch of lemon zest. Very floral, reminds me of this tiny yellow flower that grows here in FL. It also has the faintest hint of pine, which I normally don't like, but seems to be done really well in this beer. But where this beer shines is really in the taste. It reminds me of Six Point's Bengali Tiger. Well balanced, hoppy/sweet combo and delicious. Pliny somehow takes this all up a notch! Everything I get from the nose, is doubled on my tongue, and in the best of ways. There is also the slightest of biscuity flavor too. Mouthfeel is simple, bubbly, very lightly creamy, and the hops do not attack my taste buds. I love this about Pliny. Most IPAs will sting your tongue with the aggressive hops. Also, this beer hides the 8% ABV extremely well; not as well as Compass from ST, but very very well. It drinks like a great single IPA.",Russian River Brewing Company,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,100
863,7971,SnifterWorthy,4.62,"2 month old bottle via r/beertrade poured into a snifter  Appearance: Gorgeous translucent, orange-tinged amber with 1/2"" off-white foam that holds for quite awhile before becoming a fine lacing.  Aroma: Not as intense as I would've hoped. Sticky pine sap, sweet caramel, slight booze, prominent fruity quality...pineapple? maybe some tangerine and subtle grass notes  Taste: Incredibly smooth, thin mouth-feel with low to moderate carbonation. Resinous pine coats the tongue and reluctantly gives way to some citrus fruit and a grassy bitterness that stays at the back of the throat for ages. Malt flavor is present, but only enough to balance the hops.  Overall: One of the best IPAs I've had. If you don't enjoy pine, this beer will let you down. Overall, the beer was just right in terms of bitterness; the balance is virtue here. The beer was a tad undercarbed for me, but smooth enough that I wish I had a few more -strictly for the sake of reviewing of course ;).

863,7971,ISmith87,5,"Second try (+compare to enjoy by 4/20) Bought this case of Pliny from the brewery. Totally worth the trip and glad to enjoy it on National Beer Day!  A - 5 - amber golden clear color with nice white head that sticks throughout and leaves a nice lace on the glass S - 5 - super dank, hardcore garlic/pine/grapefruit with nice bready malts in the background. T - 5 - again, very dank, citrusy beer with garlic/ pine/grapefruit/orange/mango/papaya flavors. A flavor from the sugar that I can always taste in beers they use corn sugar in... its there, but its OK and it is what it is. M - 5 - light-medium, alc covered, aftertaste is garlic/citrus/ grapefruit flavors. O - 5 - what can be said about an ipa this classic and legendary? People seek it out because of its reputation, and it deserves it.  Compare to enjoy by 4/20:  The thing ive found about trying ipas together is they have a way of knocking each other out even when trying two world class beers. The better beer always shines far above the other one, while it may be good as hell, it doesn't measure up when put up against something slightly better.  The hop flavor profile in the Enjoy by is less distinct than that in the Pliny. While Pliny had very obvious garlic/grapefruit/orange zest/other tropical fruits, the enjoy by is more ""clean"" with a fresh pine/floral/grassy smell, and a more garlic dominated flavor, with the tropical fruit more in the background.  Last review in August '13: I was starting to think I wouldn't get to try this for a very long time since I live in Phoenix and they don't distribute it out here. By some stroke of luck I happened to check Craig's List for brewing equipment and someone had listed that they had a case of Pliny and were selling individual bottles. I texted them and found out they had won a trip to N Cali and stayed in a hotel that was only a few miles away from Russian River. Like a good Samaritan they posted an add on Craigs List to see if anyone else in the area wanted some.  A - Crystal clear copper/orange color that has a finger of white head that stuck around the entire time with excellent lacing.  S - I was surprised to find that it didn't smell as pungent and some people say. Definitely has citrusy hops (grapefruit/lemon/lime/orange zest with some pineapple/mango in there), piney, and some garlicy/onion in there too. Great smelling beer, just not as intense as some people say it is.  T - This beer tastes amazing! The intensity of the hop flavor is unlike any other IPA I've had. It's definitely spicy, with garlic and onion at first that fades out to citrusy/piney hops as it warms up. There's grapefruit/orange/lemon/lime/mango/pineapple flavors in there. Really good, interesting and original.  M - light-medium mouthfeel, leaves a very intense hop aftertaste, sticky resinous feeling in your mouth  O - It lives up to the hype. Mainly just because of the intensity of the hops in the flavor. It's not really an IPA that I feel like I can compare to anything else either, because the flavor is so distinct. Some people say it tastes like Hop Stoopid, but I get much more spiciness and intensity from this. Amazing.",Russian River Brewing Company,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,100

Some very light and wispy lacing.  Really great nose. Floral hops are prevalent, along with a lot of citrus and fruit. Able to pick out some biscuit, honey, and caramel too. Nothing punches you in the face, it just keeps asking for another smell to see what you'll pick up next.  Extremely well balanced! Get the evidence of a sweet caramel malt base, but the floral hops immediately wash over that. Get a dry, citrus rind finish. Just want to keep drinking. Medium body with crisp carbonation.

Bad news was they limited it to one glass per person (was not loving that). Good news was the WOW factor. This beer is everything I expected it to be. Huge fruit bomb in the nose...super smooth drinkability with a variety of tropical fruits (too many to list going on here), hops, and some subtle bread notes. The hops were not at all overbearing as I sometimes find with this style of beer. The flavors were so balanced and tasty...This is without a doubt the best Double IPA I have ever had and could have easily drank this all afternoon despite the 8%.

My first from Russian River which I wish were available in my area. Nice to start with one of their best.

Mango, papaya and dry pine and earth. A hint of dry tobacco in the finish. A tinge of caramel around the edges of your tongue. Pineapple and bit of wood. Sweet cherry also stands out surprisingly.

I mean I was really, really disappointed. Maybe my palette was off? I was tired and waited until the kid was in bed. I had nothing but water leading up. The pour was strange; no head. Low carbonation. It was reddish in color. It was very hoppy in flavoring in the front, but due to the low carbonation, it lacked any yeast or wheat taste, which I like. It had a strong bitter finish that I just couldn't overcome. Not as strong or spicy as Knee Deep's Simtra, which has a better flavor. Pliny wasn't worth the search or wait. Stone Enjoy By is much, much, much better. Maybe my expectations were too high; I don't know. I'm really bummed. I'm not sure how it got a 100 on ratebeer.com or a 100 on beeradvocate.com.",Russian River Brewing Company,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,100

863,7971,tooth_decay,4.41,"Bought at whole foods, Bottle date 7/11/13  A- Nice and golden. The lacing is great after letting it set for a bit. Marks how big of sips you take.  S- The smell wasn't extremely overt, but once you got the nose deep down in it a nice hoppy profile on the nose. Though I'm writing the smell review after having drank a bit of it. When a breeze came through the house a definte piney smell wafted in.  T- Really large evergreen attack. if you take the time to savor the taste, you notice a very hidden sweetness before a large hop profile over takes your pallet. Large combination of hops makes it hard to really pick out any distinct hop profiles/flavors, but over all a large piney-ness that lingers and slows into a muted bitterness.  M- Mild to medium carbonation, a slight tinkling a long the cheeks and tongue. Medium body with a very dry finish.  Good enough to leave me pining for more!",Russian River Brewing Company,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,100
863,7971,guityler83,4.88,"A: Poured into a teku with aggression it produced a pillowy white head roughly 2 fingers tall that susatained for quite a while. As it fell it left honycomb lacing on the edge of the glass and small bubbles along the edge. The color was a soft orangish color with a small amount of haze.  S: Grapefruit and dank piney that can be smelled from across the room. A hint of alcohol in the nose, and nothing that I can detect that would be a malt aroma. Slightly grassy but not in a bad way  T: Big Bold Bright Bitterness that takes over the tounge with grapefruit and pine on the first sip. A complex yet distinct hop profile from begining to end with the more developed distinct flavors coming through at the end. Only a tiny bready grainy malt flavor detected in the middle, but it quickly is overtaken with lingering dank catty pine  M: Very dry with moderate carbonation and an slick mouth feel with all the hop oils. Yet a drying sensation with the strong bitterness (if that makes sense).  O: Not my first PtE and certainly not my last. This beer has quite the reputation, but if you like bright aromatic hoppy beers with a dry finish and huge drinkabilty. Check this bad boy out.",Russian River Brewing Company,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,100
863,7971,agreenman19,4.51,"L - filtered golden deliciousness.  S - initial aroma is pine and resin, but it quickly blossoms into a lightly sweet, deeply fruit smell. Mango, papaya, pineapple.  T - bright floral punch with a hidden dankness in the back. Alcohol punches through and resonates the flavor throughout my entire sinus structure. More tropical fruits balanced by a drying bitterness. Grapefruit. Tons of flavor.  F - smooth and silky, but a touch on the light side. Due to the filtration?  O - classically awesome.

863,7971,OregonGrown7,4.7,"Just hit paydirt when I stopped in at Beerworks in Medford Or. I had given up hope of finding Pliny in bottles, when, what is that over there? It's Pliny the Elder on tap! I walk straight to the bar and can only utter one word,""pliny"", which spurs the hippie bartender girl into action as she pours me my first taste of this beer that I have read so much about.  I am not going to dive into comparing the taste to nanner peels and fruits, because I don't know how to do all of that. I will say that this brew lived up to the hype. The most prominent thought that came to my mind was Balance, it was amazingly balanced with a very thorough complexity that made me think ""now This is a double ipa!"" As others have stated, I could drink this till I got tipsy, it is wonderfully easy to drink, even though it packs a delicious punch!",Russian River Brewing Company,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,100
863,7971,Knuckles_Nuclear,4.19,"After traveling 800 miles and visiting 4 Denver liquor stores, I finally struck paydirt. Picked up 3 nice Russian River products...time to determine what all the fuss is about. Starting with Pliny the Elder.  510ml bottle poured into an oversized wine glass.  A - Poured a nice amber/golden color with a tall fluffy head. Crystal clear. Not very bubbly, but enough to keep things lively. Nice spread of lacing that clung to the glass.  S - Immediate and distict hoppy hit to the nose...notes of pine, sweet malt, yeasty bread. I detected woody/earthy notes..perhaps some tart grapefruit back there, too. My palate prepared for an onslaught of hops.  T - The hoppy onslaught never materialized. Very well-balanced mix of complex flavors that melded together beautifully. To be honest, I'm not a fan of hoppy brews, but Pliny is a brew that must be tried at least once. Yes, the hops were there in force, but it didn't overpower all the subtle flavors. I was admittedly intimidated by the reputation of this brew, but I enjoyed it much more than I expected. It finished beautifully, and lived up to its reputation. A perfect mix of hops and citrus flavors.  M - A bit thin, but refreshing. Medium-bodied and dry.  O - Truly a great beer, probably the best DIPA, but that style of beer is not my favorite. I tried it, I liked it, but I'll move on. Honestly, I liked Supplication far better, but that's a question of style, not quality.",Russian River Brewing Company,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,100
863,7971,Roguer,5,"A - Huge, frothy, perfect white head (possibly an overly aggressive pour). Pale golden straw color, fairly translucent; looks like a lager. Nice bubbling and incredible lacing. Good head retention.  S - Strong, strong whiff of grapefruit, balanced with some sugar. Peel, light toast.  T - Strong citrus, slightly sweet, very mild peel. Lightly breaded malts with hints of caramel, but impressively smooth. Slightest hint of alcohol, and instead of an aftertaste, the citrus slowly fades. Definitely some impressive bitterness, mild astringency, but not unpleasantly so. Some slight...passion fruit? Tropical sweetness? Not exactly sure.  M - Lovely, creamy mouthfeel. Medium body, no sting, no foaming. A beer that invites you to savor it. Back of the tongue bitterness takes on a slight citrus peel flavor, but it's extremely minor.  O - I'm always worried when the hype runs wild about a beer, but the hype is well-deserved. I'm looking for places to subtract points with this beer, and...I'm not finding them. Certainly, it's a big, bitter DIPA, and that might not be for everyone's palate.  Bottled 6/17/13 (1 month, 3 days).

863,7971,carmike813,4.94,"This is pretty close to the perfect beer in my opinion.  The bottle itself is classic, i love the simple way the label states its name.  Beautiful golden appearance, with nice head. All of my hop favorites citrus fruity and pine. Love the grapefruit taste and the pleasant bitter range.

863,7971,DAllspaw,4.54,"Had on tap at RR Brewpub during a vacation to Yosemite and San Francisco. Pours a beautiful golden color with nice lacing. Kudos to the pub for serving in a proper imperial nonic glass.  Smell is intoxicating and everything I like in this style, heavy on the citrus and tropical with some pine mixed in.  Very nice malt profile, certainly enough flavor to contribute to the beer and a nice consistency, not as viscous as some other doubles with higher ABV but that's expected. Nice dry finish, with a slight alcohol bite. Very nice, was thrilled to try at the pub and was not disappointed.",Russian River Brewing Company,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,100
863,7971,Warlocks-Passage,4.69,"Had this beer multiple times, thankfully I live in northern ca....it is my favorite beer to date. Finally writing a review after I tried Heady Topper. This beer is amazing and it's a must try for beer enthusiasts and hop heads alike.  A- clean, refined amber/orangish color. Nice 2 finger white head that has nice retention. S- grapefruit,citrus and pine needles fill my nose. Just an amazing aroma that I wish I could capture. Slight malty sweetness is apparent as well. T- clean... citrus (particularly grapefruit and tangerine) and pine all come together very nicely....this beer is incredibly drinkable at 8%. Leaves the mouth with a hop bitterness that slowly disapates. M- perfect balance of hoppy bitterness and slight malt. This finishes by coating your mouth with a thin, citrusy, hoppy aftertaste. I can't explain the flavor bomb this is. Truly a masterpiece. O- overall the best beer (and double ipa) I have ever had. It is true to the style of the beer, and the execution is simply flawless. These men and ladies are geniuses at Russian River....thank you!  Edit 6/25/15- No longer my favorite DIPA...let alone favorite beer.

863,7971,Drunkenass,4.73,"I am about 10 miles from their brew pub and have had this many times. Yes, this is a great beer. It is best on tap, but the bottled version is also fantastic. This is my favorite double IPA hands down. I can't give it a solid 5 because I'm still questing after the perfect IPA. And the hype around RRBC is getting way out of hand. Yes, it is fantastic, but the hype turns me off.  A: golden goodness with a good head.  S: tropical fruity, citrus, and pine.  T: like biting into a fresh grapefruit with a lingering pleasant bite.  M: not as heavy as the beer is and is very easy to drink.  O: this is a great double IPA. I drink it frequently and really like this beer. I would give it a 5, but the hype is not attractive.

863,7971,Impunity,5,"Pliny the Elder is the world's best beer in my estimation, and I continue to be stunned at how delicious it is every I time I drink it on tap. In the bottle it's not quite as perfect, but what can you do.  The color is a deep golden hue that implies something more substantive than a pale ale, but your mouth won't know what hit it -- it just blows you away.  The hop balance is nothing short of ideal, and the alcohol lurks just subtly enough that you don't particularly notice it from a flavor perspective, but yeah, the first beer buzz is strong.  I feel sorry for people who can't get it on tap. The bottled version is worthy, but you owe yourself a trip to Santa Rosa or San Francisco area to try it fresh. I'm going to Rose & Crown in Palo Alto today for two pints, and I'm pretty excited.",Russian River Brewing Company,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,100
863,7971,pajeff,4.88,"I finally got to try this beer on tap (I live on the East Coast), and while nothing could live up to the hype that this beer gets, it is certainly a fantastic beer.  I'm not a BJCP certified judge by a long shot, but the appearance was a dark gold, with a good one finger head that lasted.  The aroma was the most surprising thing - there wasn't much. What was there was grapefruity and good, but very low aroma - maybe that has to do with it not being as fresh as possible since I'm in the East.  The taste was where this beer really shined - it didn't knock your socks off with hops; it wasn't overly malty - a picture of this beer should be in the dictionary entry for ""balanced"". As soon as I put the glass down, I wanted another sip - perfectly drying finish.  Mouthfeel was perfect - not too ""thick"", nor too thin. Carbonation seemed low, but not inappropriately so. An extremely quaffable beer, which isn't easy to say about many DIPAs.  Overall, a fantastic beer. I'm very happy that I got to cross it off my Beer Bucket list, and will certainly keep an eye out for it in the future...",Russian River Brewing Company,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,100
863,7971,YardmanFTB,4.68,Had to travel out west to finally try this beer. It was great. I don’t know if it is possible to live up to the hype that it receives but certainly a damn good beer.

863,7971,cjoc83,4.65,"Received as a present from my girlfriends college friend when she came back to Philly to visit. Bottled 6/25/13.  A - Pours a light golden straw color with excellent clarity and an initial 3 finger, creamy white head that hangs around for a while before receding to a cap, leaving generous patches of frothy lace on my Delirium Tremens tulip.  S - Lots of bright citrus and tropical fruit up front, with some earthy, almost spicy hop notes mixed in. A faint biscuity malt backbone holds it together.  T - Wow... Definitely not what I expected. What I expected was a hop bomb, but what I'm getting is just a lot of bright, clean citrus and tropical fruit. Mango, peach, papaya, pineapple, grapefruit rind. Middle of the mouth the malt backbone hits with some sweet, crackery flavors. Slight caramel. Then the hops take on a more earthy, floral tone before finishing out with a lip-smackingly great citrus finish. Barely a hint of booze. Just clean, bright hops.  M - deceptively easy drinking. Not heavy like many DIPAs. Medium bodied with an amazing finish that is both sweet and bitter, and on the dry side.  O - At first, I wasn't too impressed, because I was looking for some unbalanced, boozy hop bomb. But this beer impressed with its balance, clean feel, and amazing finish. A top 5 five DIPA for sure.",Russian River Brewing Company,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,100
863,7971,MWolverines66,4.73,"Had this one on tap at a bar in Philly. Poured a light amber color, a little head that quickly disappeared, minimal carbonation. Smelled a combination of tangerine, pine and a little grapefruit. The taste was very well balanced. The hops were definitely not overpowering like some of the other DIPA's I've had before, but left me with a nice bite at the end.  Overall a solid IPA, but the key word for this beer is balanced.",Russian River Brewing Company,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,100
863,7971,MarcWP,4.78,"This is about a 12 day old Pliny. Not bad given the brewery is under a thousand miles away. I've reviewed this beer several times before but I like to revisit so I can compare it with other world class DIPA's I've had of recent and see if it still lives up to my previous rating. I've had Pliny on draft in SF and the brewery for that matter so this might not be the best specimen to put to review but it will have to do for now.  Pours light golden with an eggshell colored head that hangs out and settles to a nice soapy half finger layer.  Aroma is bright citrus mainly Meyer lemon, key lime, golden peach, and pineapple with pine and dankness to support the fruit. Some bready malt character rounds things out nicely.  The palate brings lemon peel, juicy orange, nectarine, pine, juniper, light sourdough, and frolicking green weed throughout. Many don't understand the dank or weed flavor description. You really need to have had plenty of exposure to the stuff to be able to pinpoint it in an IPA. And if you've had that exposure, then I'll be damned if you can't taste it in this beer. It's rank! But what really makes Pliny stand apart from many is its beautiful mid level bitterness balanced out by those bready and biscuity malts. The hop profile is awesome, but the integration of the malts and yeast into that hop bill and hop schedule is what makes this thing a work of brewing mastery.  Mouthfeel is everything it needs to be. Heavier side of light body, silky feel for a DIPA, with a dry and juicy finish on the tongue.  Well, there it is. My rating has not changed if not maybe improved ever so slightly. And I'm now convinced I may actually prefer this to Heady Topper, though still not my favorite DIPA. The craftsmanship and genius brewing capability that Vinnie has attained over the years cannot be denied.",Russian River Brewing Company,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,100
863,7971,Darkmagus82,4.49,"Poured from bottle into a pint glass  Appearance – Pours a clear golden color with a two finger nearly pure white head. The head has a fair level of retention, slowly fading over time to leave a very nice level of streaky lace on the sides of the glass.  Smell – The aroma is heavy of a citrus aroma being both sweet and hoppy at the same time. The sweet citrus is of tangerine and orange while the hoppy is of grapefruit. Mixed with these smells is a bready aroma as well as a bit of caramel and some pine hop smells. Overall the aroma is citrusy, but yet still maintains a nice balance.  Taste – The taste begins with a smooth bready and sweeter taste with the sweetness being of a caramel, tropical and citrus fruit flavors of orange and tangerine. With these flavors so too comes some grapefruit hop upfront, which starts out at a moderate strength and grows stronger to the end. Along with the grapefruit increasing some pine hop flavors also come to the tongue while the caramel flavors, that were initially present begin fading. In the end with the hop increasing and the sweet decreasing a nice crisp and mainly citrusy hop flavor to be left to linger on the tongue.  Mouthfeel – The body of the beer is on the thicker and creamier side with a nice smoothness throughout. The carbonation is on the slightly lower side which when combined with the creamier body of the brew and the nice balanced sweet and hoppy taste overall create a very easy drinking feel.  Overall – A very tasty IPA no doubt, but not as amazing and overshadowing of other IPA of its strength and class as many make it seem, which is likely driven by limited availability/distribution. It is certainly well worth a try though if you get a chance.",Russian River Brewing Company,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,100
863,7971,Southsideeric,4.91,"I may have had this over a year ago when my brother brought one home from Portland, but damn I see what the hype is about.

863,7971,WolfsbaneBloom,3.94,"Appearance: Pours a clear yellow orange with a light and bubbly two and a half fingers of white foam.  Smell: Orange, tangerine, pine, and some earthy spiciness with a bit of sugary sweetness.  Taste: Follows the nose with grapefruit and pine and an earthy, spicy finish. Very well balanced with a little hit of alcohol as the beer warms.  Mouthfeel: Medium bodied, crisp, and refreshing.  Overall, this is a really solid double IPA. Currently the third highest rated beer on BeerAdvocate.com, I really had to keep my expectations in check on this one as I had been trying to get my hands on a bottle ever since I became an IPA junkie about a year ago. At first it didn't really blow me away. The aroma, while pleasant, wasn't really unique or particularly outstanding in any way. The taste was similar in that it was certainly enjoyable but nothing terribly interesting or exclusive. But then the beer warmed up a bit and surprisingly revealed itself as the extremely balanced and well-made beer that it is. It's not a hop bomb like so many IPAs released today. Instead, it quietly impresses you with its subtlety and balance. Despite this, I have to admit that it does fall short of the legendary hype but through no fault of it's own. It's still a beautifully made beer that I wound never turn down and if more easily available, would be a staple in my fridge.",Russian River Brewing Company,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,100

Nothing bad, but nothing really stood out either - fairly delicate, but there is not enough taste to keep it interesting. Maybe because it's a few weeks old, though kept in the fridge at all times.  I know DIPA should be had within a few hours on tap, but I've had many better DIPAs that's a month or two old from the bottle.

Aromas of grapefruit, tangerine, orange zest, lemon zest, floral, pineapple, honey, light caramel, bread, and floral earthiness. Damn nice aromas with good balance and complexity of hop and malt notes; with good strength. Taste of grapefruit, orange zest, lemon zest, tangerine, floral, pineapple, grass, pine, honey, light caramel, bread, and floral earthiness. Fair amount of earthy pine bitterness on the finish; with lingering notes of citrus, citrus zest, pineapple, honey, light caramel, floral, grass, pine, bread, and floral earthiness. Awesome balance and complexity of hop flavors with a moderate malt balance; and zero cloying flavors after the finish. Medium carbonation and body; with a fairly creamy, sticky, and lightly crisp mouthfeel that is nice. Alcohol is very well hidden with only a small warming noticed after the finish.

863,7971,Cubatobaco,4.69,"Poured into a Stone IPA glass from a bottle dated 5/21/14.  A - A slow pour reveals a light golden, translucent hue with a minimum amount of head. The remains as a crown around the glass and leaves a sticky lacing on the sides. There is a slow effervescence rising to the surface.  S - Of all the aromas you can pick from an ipa, this one tries to capture all of them. An exorbitant amount of citrus in the likes of grapefruit, mangoes, lemon zest, oranges, and stone fruit. Fresh pine can be found like I just pulled the needles off of a pine branch and smelled my hand. A light malt character plays in the background of the nose.  T - Here's everyone's favorite part! I've had this a half a dozen times, but this is my first time jotting down notes. This beer encompasses all of the aromas I listed above, but in flavors. The most dominant of them being the grapefruit and pine. there are so many citrus flavors going on that I find it difficult to differentiate between all of them.  M - Falls over the tongue with an acidic entry and coats the palate. I'd have to say this is a light to medium bodied DIPA as most are heavy due to the malt. Leaves a long finish.  O -There is a reason this is one of top IPA's in the world! It displays a degree of complexity that's hard to duplicate.

I believe that beer is beer and if it is stored properly, it can be drunk. that being said, my first experience with Pliny was not the orgasm I thought it was going to be. Don't get me wrong, it was delicious nad extremely balanced, but I could definitely tell that the hops in this had gone south.  After cracking open Maine Beer's MO just a couple hours earlier that was 2 weeks old, I can see now that in terms of hops and West Coast IPAs, freshness is everything and, again, while this was delicious I felt like Pliny was a little old and probably busted his hip. The MO blew it out of the water. The malts in this Pliny were definitely accentuated and the citrusy, tropical hops were not that present.

Only compared to The Younger, which I had prior to having this bottle, does it suffer a bit. If possible, the booziness came through on this one more so than when drinking The Younger. Again, the age did not do it any favors. All told still a world class beer deserving of its reputation.",Russian River Brewing Company,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,100
863,7971,cooler4life,4.55,"What a treat. I came so far to find you and now, we say our last goodbye.  A: Poured the most beautiful of tangerine orange. Two finger white head that quivers with ample carbonation. No floaties or any contaminants to adulturate the purity of the sun in my glass. Lacing coats the glass and never lets go.  S: Sweet pine, light malt, some wet grass, and earthy hops. Aromatic and soothing if you crave the hop power.  T: Closely follows the nose. Pine, honeydew, pungent hops, grapefruit, butter cracker, caramel with touch of lemon zest. This beer really showcases what fresh hops can bring to a beer.  M: Delicate yet effervesant. Perfectly carbonated. Finishes sticky and slightly wet. The 8% ABV is completely subdued by the floral and fresh hop flavor.  O: This beer absolutely sings of drinkability. Pliny does so many things well, it will hit you in the sweet spot....and leave you right where you want to be.",Russian River Brewing Company,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,100
863,7971,Pwnasaur90,3.78,"I finally was able to get my hands on the fabled Pliny the Elder and I have to say, i'm not all too blown away.  Appearance: The appearance of the beer is nice. Nice, copperish color with a golden hue and a remote cloudiness to it.  Smell: Pine. I'm not sure why, but I seem to be a little sensitive to that odor, so I got a fist full of pine stuck in my nostrils along with a nice hoppy bitterness at the end.  Taste: Again, the pine. Once the pine settles, it finishes off to be a very nicely balanced beer. The pine leads to a delicious hop profile with a refreshing bitter finish.  Overall: I'm sure my biased against the dreaded pine might have skewed my perceptions of this beer, however I think it's good mostly because of how well balanced the flavors are. To me, it's just not as mind blowing as everyone else says",Russian River Brewing Company,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,100
863,7971,BrianJohnson,5,"I was amazed with this beer. Having had numerous DIPAs, I expected this to be about the same. Boy was I wrong. This is absolutely the smoothest DIPA I have ever had. The hops, of course, were front and center. But it did not nearly have the usual ""hop blast"" that every other DIPA I've ever had has. My wife, who tastes every beer I give her, usually makes a ""scrunchy"" face over the bitterness of the DIPAs I give her to try. This one, even she said is really good. This is a phenomenal beer. If I ever get a chance to buy multiple bottles of this, I wouldn't hesitate for a second, no matter how much it costs, to buy as many bottles of this as I could.",Russian River Brewing Company,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,100

S: Tropical fruits, earthy hops, and bready malt come through. It smells wonderful.  T: Very easy drinking for a DIPA. Very crisp and refreshing. The hops hit you at first but don't overpower. This thing is packed full of flavor. For 8% ABV the alcohol is not noticeable even though the beer itself isn't as sweet as I thought it would be.  M: Full bodied and nice carbonation. It has a crisp bitterness that hits you when you take a sip but doesn't stick around too long and is not harsh at all. Dry finish. I could sip on this for days.  O: One of the easiest drinking DIPAs I've had. It's nothing out of the ordinary but just a finely crafted beer. Not the hop bomb I thought it would be, but it's so well balanced and the malt adds a great layer of flavor to the beer.

S: Mango, grapefruit, some pineapple. Smells like a citrus bomb. It's heavenly.  T: Very little sweetness for a DIPA. Instead of the juicy citrus flavors separating into distinct particulars, they merge beautifully (mixed with a hint of resiny pine). Ends on a pleasingly bitter note. Delicious and refined.

Decently sweet, I get some apricot, peach, and some citrusy notes like lemon and orange. Some pineapple as well. The smallest hint of alcohol at the end of the nose.  T- Very hoppy, but very smooth. I don't get as many complex notes in the taste as in the aroma. It's an overwhelming hop-bitterness and the aftertaste almost has like a piney kind of woody, outdoors taste to it.  M- I always find it just a little overcarbonated, but it works well to make the beer smoother.  O- This is always a treat for someone who lives in NJ. Can/bottle, I rate Heady Topper and Citra higher than Pliny, just my personal preference. But on tap, Pliny might be the best beer I've ever had.

I've had Heady and some great DIPA's, and I dont expect it to match Heady but if it can come anywhere close I'm in for a serious treat.  A - Unlike Heady it pours a brilliantly clear light crisp golden color with nearly 2 fingers of tan colored head, retention is fantastic and so is the lacing. Plentiful streams of carbonation rising to the top. Still a finger+ of head 5 minutes later, foam hanging off the glass from the top down to the fluffy tan head. Lacing becomes weaker as consumed although somewhat existing still.  S - The way I want every beer to smell, tons of citrusy hoppy fresh bitterness (grapefruit for sure). Not quite as bitter overpowering as Heady but just beautiful grapefruit aroma.  T - Oh yeah! Super crisp refreshing bitterness initially, quite bitter in the middle and then my mouth just begins watering from the citrusy deliciousness, the bitterness is damn near totally overpowered at the finish but reappears through the aftertaste where citrus sweetness is still very much present.  M - Super light crisp and bitter refreshing, medium+ carbonation but very much appropriate. Really a perfect body and bitterness for a hot day!  O - Overall this is amazing.

863,7971,TheCuriograph,4.52,"Very excited to have my first Pliny. Bottle poured into a snifter.  A - Pliny pours a crystalline clear gold with a fizzy head that holds firm with a bit of lacing.  S - A whiff reveals the citric quaff I'd exprect from such an archetypal West Coast IIPA. Grapefruit, mango, lemon-drop, and just a wee bit of earthy notes.  T - Much cleaner than I'd expect, even with all the advance press. A blast of fruit-tinged bitterness, but this evenly subsides into the malting. There’s no battle between malt and hop. The 8% ABV is dangerously masked. As it warms a bit, the caramel malt makes more of a statement, even though the citrus hold firm, becoming a bit sweeter.  M - Light and effervescent.  Pliny the Elder is probably the smoothest and most drinkable IIPA I’ve ever had. It’s light and charming, and I can see how it became so iconic for its style.

863,7971,TastefulNudity,5,"Favorite brew, about time I gave this one a full review.  A: Beautiful yellow gold. Two fingers of pure white foamy, sticky, lacy head. Constant stream of carbonation. Completely clear, no haze, chill or otherwise. The only fault I can find in it is the bottle and its Comic Sans font (dear god Russian River please ditch the font!)  S: Could smell this one as I started pouring the glass. Smells like opening a fresh bag of hops. Mostly pine I'd say, with strong citrus swirling around with it. Pine needles, grapefruit, orange, pineapple, mango, little sweetness on the back end. It makes my mouth water. I could smell this all day.  T: Malt sweetness hits the front of the tongue, transitioning in those pure hop flavors I listed in the middle, and quenches on the back end with a dry bitterness. The bitterness cleans up after the hop assault, but isn't lingering. No alcohol at all. Completely and dangerously drinkable.  M: Carbonation keeps things from getting too heavy and bites in the back of the mouth to compliment the hop bitterness. Not too heavy, not too light.  O: I can still say this is my favorite beer. As I said in my review for Heady, the two beers are completely different animals, and are perfect in their own ways. This will always be my go-to, and IMO sets the standard for West Coast DIPAs.

Pours a clear copper, white head with average retention.  On the nose some pine, citrus - mainly grapefruit.  Not actually hugely bitter like I've heard about. Slightly thin mouthfeel.  I don't get all of the hype for this beer, I've had far better DIPAs and why should the quality fade so quickly unlike some other great IPAs I've head, maybe because it's filtered.  Disappointed after seeing such high praise for it, I'd prefer Phillips Amnesiac or Stone Ruination any day of the week.",Russian River Brewing Company,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,100

Not the big hob bomb I was thinking , but very hop foward , very bitter and to me just sweet enough with a malty finish and the alcohol is hidden well , the mouth is on the verge of being a little weak for me but not enough to hurt the profile of the brew  Overall I'm glad I scored this beer in a trade , it really is to me the best DIPA that I have had , there are a few I think that stand down the podium from it but this is what all DIPA's should be judged by",Russian River Brewing Company,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,100
863,7971,rringler,4.83,"Oh Pliny. We've enjoyed each other for a while now; time to give you the full review.  A: Very clear, dark straw color. Pours with about a finger of white medium size head. While the head does dissipate into a nice bubble film rather quickly, it leaves behind a very nice, sticky lacing of micro bubbles.  S: A very balanced impression of grape fruit zest/sweetness, malty breads, and bitter hops. The beauty here is in how well balanced everything is.  T: Similar to the smell, the taste's strength is in its balance. It start with grapefruit sour/citrus, before moving on to moderate bready malts, but finishes with moderate+ bitter/piney hops. Very enjoyable, with no hint of alcohol at 8% abv. This is not news to anyone, but this brew defines the textbook IPA.  M: Medium- body, and a little quicker and less sticky than some IPAs. Mouthfeel usually determines how many brews I can enjoy in a session, and this brew gives me the option to enjoy a second (or third) if I care to. Carbonation is great.  O: This beer gets very high reviews for very good reasons. Lots of brews focus on single areas, but this one excels in all areas of the taste (the initial sweetness, the bready mid-tastes, and the hop finish.) It does all this without tasting boozy and the smell accurately represents the taste. All of this is accomplished with a mouthfeel that doesn't fatigue the drinker. In my book, this is a win; I enjoy drinking Pliny, and I'll always enjoy another.",Russian River Brewing Company,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,100
863,7971,Benish,4.99,"Man this is good! Just opened my first bottle and it's pretty fresh; bottled 5/09/13.I don't know if this is a good analogy but opening the bottle is like letting the Genie out the lamp. It's insanely floral and sweet just smelling from the tip of bottle. Kind of like opening a BRAND NEW canister of Folgers ground coffee in the morning.  In a glass, the beer presented a very light amber color. Very clear and transparent. Honestly, I am paying less attention to appearance and more attention to smell and flavor.  I taste a lot of floral notes, some kiwi, citrus, and pine. It's is amped up in flavor. It almost makes your tongue tingle! I have not tried that many Double IPA's but if there is one DIPA it compares to, it's Sosus from Toppling Goliath. I think both are equally good. But because Sosus is extremely limited (might have been made only once), I'm more than glad that Pliny is available!  The flavor is very balanced. It's both bitter and sweet. Neither side is overpowering. The beer is extremely drinkable. I'm savoring it but I can see why someone would say it doesn't take long to finish a pint.

Of note, I drank this back-to-back with RR's Blind Pig IPA, so feel free to see that review for comparisons.  A: 4.75 - straw yellow coloration, less hop haze than Bling Pig (could read blurrily through this one), white half-finger head subdues into subtle glass lacing, moderate alcohol legs for a 8% beer  S: 4.25 - after drinking Bind Pig, I was expecting an even bigger hop bomb, and, unfortunately, I liked the hop aroma on Blind Pig much better; nevertheless, there are similar notes: tropical fruit (mango, papaya), pine, resiny, dank with more alcohol in the background  T: 4 - again, less impressed than Blind Pig; on the front of the tongue, there is a moderate pleasant bitterness that subdues pretty quickly into pine, dank notes with a lingering appreciation; I definitely get more booze in the taste than many other DIPAs, which is surprising considering the relatively low ABV for style; yet, it's dry with a balanced biscuity breadiness that I like very much  M: 4.5 - best aspect of the beer, I think; less carbonation than Blind Pig but bigger and chewier; would go well with a nice cigar  O: 4.5 - I think that this is the third time that I've tried this beer, and unfortunately, it doesn't live up the hype for me; there are not enough hops in this one to warrant world-class status for style; I had older batches in the past but this was only bottled about two weeks ago! Anyway, I would consider this more of a single IPA anyway, and it's definitely excellent for that style; I wonder if this is one of those beers that were really great 5-10 years ago, but, now, there are much better examples",Russian River Brewing Company,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,100

Dry for the style. Creamy. Firm bitterness, but very pleasant with a long sustain.  O - a highly rated beer that deserves all the praise it receives.

863,7971,Nektar-der-Gotter,3.2,"This was my second DIPA (had Lagunitas Maximus in bottle the prior day). Was out in the Bay Area so drove up to Santa Rosa to try it right at the source - the Russian River Brewpub. Had a pint at the bar before dinner. It was definitely unique but not something I would seek out for future drinking. For me it finished too bitter and like the other DIPA I had (Lagunitas Maximus) had a hint of something rank on hitting the tongue. Comparing the two it was definitely preferable to the Lagunitas with more interesting flavor components and a smoother mouthfeel. I ended up getting a sampler of all 15 beers they had on tap after this pint, and ended up preferring several of their other beers (Perdition, OVL Stout, almost everything except the sour ales). Obviously YMMV and if you like DIPAs I can only assume you'll love this. Thinking about my preferences, I'd take a good Bock/Eisbock/Barleywine in the cooler months and a tasty Hefeweizen/Lager in the warmer months over Pliny any day.

While visiting SF I spied a bottle of this and was incredulous that it could be so cheap - a 22oz or so for about $5. I happily brought it back to the hotel and poured.  Appearance: silky white head that stays on and on. amber-gold brew with tiny bubbles.  Smell: This is just something else. It evokes a pine forest, mountain air and clear water at once. Really invogorating scent.  Taste: Another big wow. Every other double-IPA seems either too sweet or awfully bitter by comparison (except maybe for Capt. Lawrence's) after trying this beer. It's the perfect example of the style if I ever tasted one.  Mouthfeel: I don't think I could drink too many of these, but I'd have a wonderful time trying. This is a pretty clean brew but that much booze leaves a little stickiness.  Overall: If you have any interest in the style, or beer in general, this is an absolute must-try.

Smell hits first with that piney grapefruit and pineapple fruit notes. There's an herbal hedgerow character to it. A sweet buscuity note somehow slips through. It's mostly pine/herbal/grapefruit/pineapple.  Taste is straight up piney, peppery tropical fruit hops with that sweet sticky resinous quality. The back end seems to be a bit of caramel and biscuit. Pleasant the entire way through. Almost an orange quality also lingers on the tongue.  Mouthfeel is chewy and sticky but the carbonation is moderate so that makes it feel lighter on the tongue. Resinous, but still drinkable and seems to be a nice balanced feel for 8%.  Overall, this beer is great. It is a bit of a legend but I don't think it's ultimately the end all be all of the DIPA's.

863,7971,akang,4.57,"It's fortunately pretty accessible in California, so I've had it on tap and in bottles numerous times.  A - Light, relatively clear golden color.  S - Inviting mix of fresh hops and citrus.  T - The strong hop profile comes through immediately along with relatively muted hints of the citrus. The finish is dry and slightly bitter, but less so than some other DIPAs (such as Heady Topper). The overall balance in flavors is incredible.  M - Well-carbonated and easy to keep drinking.  O - After having this multiple times, I completely understand why this beer has been the gold standard for DIPAs. There are bold hops flavors but the emphasis on balance is awesome.",Russian River Brewing Company,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,100
863,7971,BuckKY,4.63,"I am filling this out from memory. So, forgive me. But this beer isn't that memorable. This beer had an excellent full but light mouth feel. A great medium bodied beer. The color was on the lighter side of red-gold. More gold really. It had aged a bit and this could be why it wasn't as memorable. The florals had dropped a bit but there faint echoes of it. I consider this a great beer. But, personally, not my favorite.",Russian River Brewing Company,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,100
863,7971,MadCat,4.95,"Appearance: A nice clear amber-ish gold, with a good white head that leave nice lacing  Smell: Fragrant pine and floral hops, with some light malts  Taste: Piney, floral, and the right amount of bitterness. At only 15 days old, I can taste why this is best fresh. You also get some biscuit and fruit in there. Very complex. Semi-dry finish. No hints at the 8% abv. It would be easy to go for another if circumstances permitted.  Mouthfeel: Medium body, good carbonation  Overall: A world class beer, but for me, not worth the difficulty to obtain.

I think its equitable and I was very happy with it.  A - Very light straw color, beautiful light golden color. Good two fingers of head and good lacing. I was told that the color is quite deceptive, which it very much is.  S - Light citrus and flowery notes. Earth tones come through bigtime here, as well as the hops. Quite piney, just a great outdoorsy auroma.  T - Sweet, but not too sweet. Extremely nice balance of hops and citrus, both making themselves very present, yet not over the top (although there my not be such a thing!). I get a little grapefruit coming through, it is so very refreshing and crisp, the earthiness is present here too.  M - So smooth on the palate its ridiculous. A buttery smoothness that ends with a lingering resiny aftertaste.  O - Leaves me wishing I could sit down and drink it on tap all night. The shame is that I have to savor every drop, and think about every sip, would love to be able to just have a few pints while watching some sports at the bar.

Taste is slightly sour, bit of pale malt. Light-medium body. Medium carbonation. Only a tiny bit of bitterness in finish.  Honestly, I am slightly disappointed. Don't get me wrong, it's still one of the best in its style. And I agree with Vinnie (the brewer) that pale is the way to go. But this beer has a certain soapiness/oiliness that I'd prefer not to have. Also, I've been appreciating the tropical flavors that beers down south (Alesmith, Greenflash) often have, which RR doesn't seem to have.",Russian River Brewing Company,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,100
863,7971,jdhowe,4.55,"I should note that Pliny (the Elder) is not a beer I have traditionally thought as highly of as many of my IPA-loving friends. But I do need to start critically tasting and reviewing beers, and what better to start with than this staple brew.  Bottled on 04/17/2013 -- the freshest Pliny the Elder I've had to date excepting perhaps a draft from which I don't know the date.  A: crystal clear, beautiful yellow/amber pour with a finger of off-white head dissipating to a good lacing around the glass with a thin film of head persisting. Definitely one of the prettier IPAs, largely due to its clarity.  S: Sweetness, hops, pine, and grapefruit/citrus. Very appealing.  T: This is where Pliny for me starts to get unexceptional. A fine body for a DIPA, but many of the flavors I expect from the nose just don't show through as prominently as I'd like. Instead, I get a somewhat weaker rendition of each flavor with a lot of alcohol and a bit of malt showing up toward the near the back of the tongue. Within seconds after the tasting, but not immediately, comes the bitterness that to me makes Elder just that bit worse than Younger, which lacks the bitter finish and is instead a little more full and syrupy with hop flavors.  M: Crisp, very carbonated, drinkable, and smooth. Not as much oily hop character as I would like.  O: A very good beer, and one that has slowly been moving up in my opinion. This is probably the 6th or 7th time I've had Elder, and while I wouldn't say this is my favorite (this bottle seems a little weaker in the flavor than some of the other bottles I've had), it is definitely a very good DIPA. I wish there was a little less bitterness in the aftertaste and maybe a fuller body. I feel like Younger does this right, but it is unfortunately hell to obtain.",Russian River Brewing Company,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,100
863,7971,JMScowcroft,4.88,"Russian River Brewing Company - Pliny The Elder  Thanks to my buddy (da_beers) I was able to sample the best the West has to offer, at least as far as DIPAs go.  Look - Pours like a light beer, as in clear, filtered, and golden like a lager. It proves its worth with an amazing soapy head and incredible lacing all over the glass. We were able to get one that was a little over two weeks old. Carbonation is moderate to heavy.  Smell - Signature west coast hops, similar to Lagunitas Sucks but a little more refined, more subtle and mouth-watering. Some sweet malts are present. Evolves a bit as it warms but don't let it warm too much as it can end up compromising the taste.  Taste - Smooth carbonated hop blend, light citrus (grapefruit and tangerine), some pine and resin here as well, so smooth and tasty.  Mouthfeel - Probably the most drinkable DIPA you can get. The 8% is invisible and it goes down smooth. Amazingly thirst-quenching and it lingers just right on the palette. Gentle and warming yet crisp and refreshing.  Overall - Phenomenal brew, absolutely amazing. So glad we were able to get some of this shipped out to us. Even a non-DIPA/IPA drinker and those who aren't super into hops can enjoy this smooth and unique brew.",Russian River Brewing Company,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,100
863,7971,LambicPentameter,4.6,"Poured out of a bottle into a 20 oz snifter. Bottled on 4/13/13, so nice and fresh.  Appearance - An crystal-clear orangeish golden yellow with a frothy white head two fingers thick. After awhile, the head dissipates to just a film and a line of foam around the edge with moderate lacing.  Smell - Pleasantly complex--it changes a bit each time I return for another whiff. Grapefruit, pine resin, even some tannins and maybe a bit of phenolic quality on a foundation of aromatic hoppiness.  Taste - Tangy hops and layers of citrus. More grapefruit with elements of fresh clementine. The hopes are again present, but provide what seems like a bit of earthiness under the citrus canopy.  Mouthfeel - Full-bodied and creamy. Fills your mouth, but doesn't linger with any kind of unsavory aftertaste.  Overall, a fantastic beer. I'm not sure I can say that it's my favorite DIPA ever, but it's quite amazing in the way it has so many things going on.

But the beauty is, it's not a hop bomb that singes your nose hairs either - it has the perfect amount  Taste - perfection in the form of an ipa. I love heady, but I like this one even better. There's such a perfect balance to the beer that it leaves you wanting more. There's absolutely no hint of the alcohol at 8% either. In short, one of the best beers I have ever drank.

863,7971,Agent1,4.33,"**HAVING SEARCHED FOR THIS BEER FOR ALMOST 4 YEARS NOW, I FINALLY GOT MY HANDS ON BUT A SINGLE BOTTLE. THIS MAY BE THE HOLY GRAIL OF BEER, ACCORDING TO LEGEND**  That being said, I will remain unbiased and impartial and judge this beer objectively.  **Bottled: 030813**  ---  Appearance – In all honesty, for a beer of this color and style, it really does not get much better than this. It looks great. Poured into a pokal-style glass. Bright copper orange. The head reminds me of Duvel Moortgat; bright white with excellent lacing and foamy, active bubbles. A very active beer. You can see the carbonation is mid to high just by watching the bubbles race to the top.  Smell – Super, super strong simcoe hops and fresh floral hops. Almost piercingly chemical or enhanced. I've never smelt anything like this from any Double IPA or IPA. Smells very fresh, like opening a vacuum sealed bag of hops. Pine needles and cleaner (not an offensive smell, necessarily, just extremely, extremely potent). This is a very powerful, bold aroma. Plants, citrus, lemon, orange peel, herbs and very strong, concentrated sugar smells. Not much malt is allowed to come through the hops. Very piny.  Taste – Great, clean taste. Definitely suits the style but does not add anything new or take any risks. Fresh hop taste and plenty of light, subtle toffee/ butterscotch notes. Soapy dry hop flavor (pretty standard -- tastes good). Amarillo is in the mix, but blends in with the others. The Amarillo gives this beer something special. Subtle lemon notes with stronger orange/ orange peel and grapefruit at the center. The alcohol is hidden well. Nice bitterness and use of sugars -- the two go hand in hand. Lots of grapefruit notes. I have drank this cool at around 6c, and warmer at around 12c. I wanted to see it change. Not a huge jump like most Belgian ales, but still a tad more enjoyable to me when warmer. Hints of vanilla and spice.  Mouthfeel – Impressive. This lightly stimulates all areas of the mouth, but mostly the roof. A nice clean finish with a hint of fresh hops on the aftertaste. Taste buds mainly feel this on the front-roof of the mouth. Nice and fizzy. The hops and carbonation work wonderfully together. Crisp and clean, buttery and smooth. A great use of carbonation.  Overall – This beer is definitely overhyped and overrated. It is very well-balanced and holds true to its style. An excellent beer, but not nearly as incredible as I thought it might be. I feel the aroma and look of this beer may be some of its most impressive characteristics. Dry, earthy, tart, yet sugary and delicious, this beer is a great Double India Pale Ale. I think it is fairly obvious that most of the beer nerds out there like to boast of Pliny's rarity and perhaps feel extra privileged to take part in the hype. It is very hard to find and I am fortunate enough to finally get my hands on it after approximately 4 years of searching. Do not get me wrong, this is an exceptional beer in its style, but definitely overhyped due to how hard it is to come by. Also important to note: there are plenty of other amazing IPAs and DIPAs out there that rival this specific beer. Overall, this does not disappoint. Pliny, you are delicious.",Russian River Brewing Company,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,100

Its balance and flavors are so good, and are still considerably unique among so many beers even after all these years. May be my favortite beer during the summer time. Such a fresh, clean flavor profile. Simcoe hops are balanced perfectly. The slight champagney mouthfeel gives you a deliciously refreshing beginning with a semi-dry finish that begs for another gulp. The smell is good, but does not represent the beers taste and overal experience. I did notice the hop smells came through more as it warmed up a bit, but this beer should be served colder them most IPA's.

Pours crystal clear, golden with a slight head. Nice carbonation, moderate lacing.  The aroma with this brew is off the charts for sure. Some pine, tinged with a melon fruitiness. Well-rounded and potent.  The flavor is wonderful- it just envelopes the mouth with a huge variety of flavors. There's a touch of booze that makes everything a bit sharp, but it signifies to me that this beer means business. There is pine again in the flavor, and a big springtime, fresh-cut grass flavor. The finish is a touch of citrus that's kind of like a lemon chaser to the big flavors that preceded it.  The mouthfeel is wonderfully dry. The flavors just last and last as you drink this one, too.  This really is a great beer that doesn't disappoint. Although, I wouldn't be doing my job as a new member of the ""Have enjoyed fresh Heady and Pliny"" club if I didn't opine on my preferred beverage. I prefer Heady, slightly, for a couple of reasons. First, I have history with it. I have had a lot of Heady and associate some great memories with it. I'd be lying if I didn't admit this was a factor. But second, I love Heady's viscosity, its dense, dirty look and feel, and it's substantial sweet backbone that Pliny lacks.

NIce and fluffy and does a great job of clinging to the glass with solid retention. Intense amount of carbination bubbles shooting from bottom to top.  S- Impressive, big aroma of robust amount of floral, citrus, and pine hops. Fresh hop oils. Resinous. A tropical scented freshener. A nice touch of biscuits gives me indication this isn't going to be a one note song.  T- Oh my. So, so smooth. Perfect job of following the great direction the nose was leading. Layers of complex hops that I smelled. Grapefruit, orange, some pine and floral notes. Then comes a mellow course of bready malts to give it just the right amount of balance for the style.

O- I wasn't sure it could live up to the hype, but I think it did. It is about as perfectly crafted a beer as I have had. I'll give it the slight edge over Hopslam as my favorite DIPA.

Pours a nice looking pale ale with a nice head that with moderate lacing that sticks to the glass, creating nice layers with every sip. The initial aroma is floral and super hoppy, but fades quickly. The light body holds only an initial hop flavor that fades quickly as your pallet declines with the bitter bite of the hops, and the flavor just seems bland after the first 2 sips.

It brings in a strong grapefruit flavor at first, with some tropical flavors in the middle leading to a big, resiny, piney finish that lingers for an eternity.

Beer is medium-bodied, easy to drink, incredibly smooth for the amout of hops in there and it packs a lot. Almost chewey and a dangerous session ale since you can't even pick up any alcohol, this beer is the exception of most DIPAs in that instead of crushing/drying out your tastebuds it wets them and leaves you wanting more.

O: I feel the strongest part of this beer is its mouth feel. Elder is very well crafted. You cannot argue Russian River really put effort into designing and balancing Elder. There was nothing that really stood out and I was not overly impressed with the flavor which is why I forgot it so fast. There are other Doubles/imperials that are on the market that are READILY AVAILABLE that I would rather consume. I was not a fan of having to go out of my way to find and try the beer after 3 years searching. Find it (good luck) and try it. But I would not go out of the way to drink again.",Russian River Brewing Company,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,100
863,7971,BrantleyJ,4.71,"One of the finest beers put out by Russian River. Had it on tap at the brewery. Very hoppy aroma hits you first, drinks incredibly smooth for such a big beer. It is hard to find but well worth the hunt.

863,7971,Treyliff,4.69,"Review #300 Served in a tulip glass  A- pours a bubbly crystal clear bright golden color with a creamy two-finger head that seems to retain permanently, patches of lace stick as the head dissapates.  S- the first thing I notice are the freshness of the hops coming from the aroma, notes of fresh cut grass, orange zest, a bit of pine and some tropical fruit. Just a trace of alcohol and sweet malt.  T- the complexity of flavors are so impressive. It starts with citrus and pine hops with some fresh grassy notes. Mid palate provides sweet tropical fruits of pineapple and guava, the finish is dry and extremely clean with fresh mint sprig and light clean alcohol with a citrusy linger  M- medium body with a spritzy-yet-creamy mouthfeel, moderate carbonation and a velvety finish  O- the flavors of this beer lived up to the hype for me. This is the cleanest and freshest hop profile that I've experienced from a beer. The flavors are so profound yet brilliantly balanced, it drinks as easy as a standard IPA. Glad to finally have a chance to try this legend.",Russian River Brewing Company,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,100
863,7971,Hendry,4.99,"The East Coast hop junkies, particularly those of us in Vermont, have been spoiled to Heady Topper,Lawson's Double Sunshine (among other splendid DIPAs),and Hill Farmstead varieties. The legend of Pliny The Elder was one that intrigued me, and thanks to my buddy & hop mentor, I was lucky enough to sample this nectar.  The pour and appearance are pretty standard, but there is a discord between the appearance and aroma: how could this clear as a bell DIPA have such an inviting nose? The aroma made my mouth water with a truly subtle bouquet of the sweetest tropical fruits you can think of.  The mouthfeel is light to medium, carbonation perfect, and the aftertaste is marvelously fruity (apricot,peach,pineapple,not your standard grapefruit blast). The drinkability of this beer is off the charts, particularly for a DIPA.  Pliny The Elder is completely worthy of the legendary status it receives, and has a drinkability factor that surpasses the mighty Heady Topper for my tastes. This DIPA is a masterpiece, one that has only been matched thus far by Lawson's Double Sunshine. Excellent work by Russian River Brewing.",Russian River Brewing Company,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,100
863,7971,Samuel906,4.97,"Before I had a chance to have this for the first time, I was worried that it was going to be over hyped; I thought my expectations were going to be too high, and I was going to be disappointed. Nothing could be further from the truth. This beer is simply fantastic. It puts all of my other favorite DIPAs to shame. It pours a rich golden amber that is perfectly transparent, with some bubbles effervescing. It has a nice thick dense, white head with great retention and lacing. The smell is amazing: fresh pineapple, mango, hops and grapefruit. The definition of fresh. The taste follows suit: sour citrus up front, some sweet caramel and mango in the middle with some herbal hints, and resiny hops to finish it off. Absolutely no booze. Silky smooth, crisp and refreshing. This beer is simply fantastic, and considering its price point, and availability (check local listings), I would go on a limb to say it is probably the best beer overall on the planet right now.",Russian River Brewing Company,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,100

Crisp bitterness and light sweet malts.  M – Crisp, clean, and smooth. Bright hop notes destroy any lingering malt notes – great!  O – Great as always.

863,7971,Lothar666,4.85,"A special thank you to Taylor Ross for hooking me up with this rare and hard to find brew.  A- Poured a beautiful semi-translucent body with a creamy bone-white head that left muddy lacing on the sides of the glass.  S- Sweet woody pine, citrus, and delicious hops. Notes of grapefruit and pine-cones dominate the nose profile.  T- More pine and less citrus in the flavor profile than in the nose. Strong hops and sweet grassy malts in equal measure make for a phenomenally well-balanced brew. While definitely present in the delicious lingering aftertaste, the bitterness from the hops is not so overpowering as to numb the taste buds like some other examples of the style. What shines through instead is a pleasant complexity that makes this brew a true credit to the style.  M- Crisp, refreshing, not at all cloying or syrupy and with a perfect balance that hides the relatively strong ABV incredibly well.  O- This is an incredible brew. Not at all what I was expecting from such a legendary beer, though the surprise is not at all unwelcome.

Fulfilling hop bitterness but not much hop flavor. The individual notes are lost in the carbonation. Some malt in the background. M. Dry, medium-high carbonation and a little watery  O. This beer is well balanced, but balanced rather like a Miata than a GTR. There is a lot of hop bite but the juicy tropical flavors that jump out at you in more substantial DIPAs are there to a much lesser extent and they are subdued by the carbonation. This beer would be nice served extra cold and it would pair well with buffalo wings or mexican food. I would not recommend giving it to anyone as an example of a DIPA, as there are American IPAs that are less bitter yet have more hop aroma and flavor. It is, however, very consistent.

S-- Smells of sweet grapefruit and green apples. The aroma is not overpowering, nice and mellow.  T-- The fresh hops remind me of rock fruit with a mild amount of grapefruit tartness. Although hop forward, the beer is not a hop-bomb. The taste clears off the palette quickly.  M-- The body is very light and not at all cloying. The carbonation is vibrant but not too much and works to clear the palette as mentioned above.  O-- This is a perfect be to pair with a good meal.

You get the nice citrus and sweet grapefruit (not bitter grapefruit) up front. The a wave of bread, biscuit, honey, sweet malt washes in. Finishes with a great floral hop with a nice bitterness.

A: Golden color, a little opaque, 2 finger pure white head with great retention and lacing.  S: Surprisingly subdued, may be due to it being a few months old. Much like Blind Pig, a combination of tropical fruits, orange, grapefruit, unripe mango, and some pine and floral notes, with a hint of malt sweetness.  T: Nice hop taste following the nose, a good amount of bitterness throughout without being overwhelming. The malt backbone is just perfect. In one word: Balance. Not a hop-head's dream beer, and not the biggest maltiest syrupy DIPA, but just really, really, well constructed. A little more hop taste for me and it'd be perfect.  M: This and Heady Topper are the only IPAs I can give a 5/5 to on mouthfeel. I don't know how they get the smooth, creamy texture so well, but it's just awesome. Full-bodied but not heavy, carbonation spot on, dry but not puckeringly so.  O: Damn near perfect. A top 3 DIPA for sure. Probably even better fresh.

Completely translucent. 2-3 finger head that begins as a fizzy consistency and quickly turns to silky. Fades into nice ring and laces the glass wonderfully.  S: Hop forward for sure. A little malt character, but it's definitely faint. Slightly bitter. Very fruity - grapefruit rind, mango, and some wofts of what almost comes off as papaya.  T: Follows the nose exactly. Very hoppy, without much malt taste at all. Not overly bitter, but some bitterness that comes off like citrusy grapefruit bitterness. Some citrus sweetness as well.  M: Surprisingly light for the 8% ABV. High carbonation. Very crisp and refreshing. Extremely drinkable.  O: I am not sure how it could get much better than this one. If it were possible to have a bunch of bottles of this laying around, it could get dangerous. It's amazingly smooth, crisp, and refreshing.

863,7971,dougfur,4.32,"Finally writing a review for Pliny. poured it into a pint glass from bottle. Bottled about a week ago. First thing you notice: this beer is CLEAR! A darker straw color with absolutely no haze and a pretty small head. The smell is hoppy, but not really in your face. Very much towards the citrus side of things, which I appreciate! Taste is just like the smell, reasonably hoppy with grapefruit/pineapple and a bit of pine. The balance of hops to malt will (and does) impress a lot of people, but I could use more hops here. Feels great in your mouth, though I think it could use a tad more body to it (just my personal tastes). Overall, it's an impressive beer. I'm not quite sure why it gets compared to Heady Topper so much as they're very different. Heady is hazy, resiny and just blasts you with hop aroma and taste. This is more subtle. It's about a lot of great flavors mixed together with skill and subtlety and while I could drink this one with regularity, I think the days of it being at the top of the DIPA crowd are about over.",Russian River Brewing Company,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,100

Bottled 1/25/13, less than a month ago. Allowed to warm as I drank it, served fresh out of the fridge.  A- Pours a crystal clear golden body with minimal rising carbonation, a small 1/2 inch head rises and falls quickly and reduces to a few foamy bubbles surrounded by a white ring.  S- Super fruity and juicy upfront. Smells like I Just stuck my nose into a can full of tangerines. Grapefruit, orange, citrus, tropical fruits dominate with a slight resinous hop oil aroma in the background. The aroma is pungent and forward - the second I opened the bottle my personal space was saturated with the delicious aroma. I wish I could bottle it.  T- Upfront I'm hit with a nice balance of juicy, tropical, piney hoppyness and a solid but not too heavy malt backbone. This develops into a subtle stickyness that sticks on the tongue for a few moments.  M- Medium carbonation, medium body. Easy to drink.  Wow.. my first PtE. My first thoughts were that this is a very impressive DIPA - I can see why it is ranked what it is. At the same time, it is gaining some pretty fierce competitors. First example: Lagunitas sucks, a beer with a very similar hop profile and a clear filtered character, which is more readily available and less hyped up (which is probably why it has lower ratings). Another example would by heady topper, which in a side by side test would defeat PtE in my opinion. It's raw, unfiltered character gives it the one-up on PtE.

Head fades slowly, and some remains throughout the duration of the drinking experience.  A balance of malt and hops in the aroma. Hop aroma is a blend of typical American hop varieties. Floral, fruit, and citrus. I expected a more pungent hop-forward aroma, but I'm not complaining. It has a certain subtle soft sweetness that's very, very good.  Absolutely perfect blend of malt and hops in the flavor. Soft and sweet at first, then spicy and bitter. Slight alcohol, but not what you'd expect for 8% ABV.  Mouthfeel is spot-on! Soft, pleasant carbonation. Medium bodied, spicy, bitter, lingering finish. Perfect.  I obtained this fantastic beer from a great trader on Reddit. This is my first time trying Pliny.

Great smoothness and malt presence here too. Perfectly balanced. This is criminally easy to drink. Crazy that this is 8% because its something you would never get tired of drinking. Goes down so easy with no lingering bitterness whatsoever. Medium bodied, medium carbonation. Dry finish.  Overall its probably my favorite IPA.

Not as hop forward as I was expecting but still very very hoppy considering its malt presence. Masterfully made and incredibly well balanced.

I must admit, I was prepared to be a little dissappointed based upon all the hype that surrounds this beer, but it rose to the challenge. Again, the only downside I see to this beer is the fact that you can't get it easier if you aren't in the Sonoma/Surrounding bay area.

Also, a strong malt smell to it.  T: Very hoppy up front, not overly hoppy though, more of a medium hoppy. Not very bitter in the end, rather smooth. Slightly malty in the aftertaste.  M: Not much of a aftertaste. Feel slight notes of maltiness.  O: Not a bad beer, but I don't really see what the big deal about it is. I'd rather have a Hoptimum to be honest. The only thing I truly enjoyed was the aftertaste.",Russian River Brewing Company,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,100
863,7971,Stevedore,4.62,"510ml bottle (bottling date 1/29/2013) poured into Bells tulip glass and consumed today, 2/19/2013- making for a 3 week old Pliny. Updated: I'm editing this review to reflect the multiple times I've had Pliny on tap at Monk's Cafe since the very first time I had it (which was out of the bottle).  Aroma: Primarily citrus grapefruit with floral hops, followed by a nice, sweet bready maltiness that evokes caramel and toffee. Honestly, as soon as I pop the bottle, it explodes with grapefruit aromas. A true delight to sniff all the way to the end of the bottle.  Colour: A beautiful crystal clear copper/burnt orange body. Pours with a big fluffy 3cm white head that dissipates within minutes. Lacing and collar is nice, bubbly yet viscous-like. Really has a great looking pale ale-type body.  Flavour: Floral +grapefruit hop blast at the beginning quickly balanced out by sweet caramel and toffee. Before the sweet maltiness comes into play, I quickly get a transition into a citrus bitterness, reminiscent of grapefruit and even some hints of orange and mango. Really well-put together DIPA with a malt backbone that gives this DIPA the complexity that makes it so well-received.  Mouthfeel: Medium body on the thicker end of the spectrum, wonderfully well-carbonated leaving the tongue buzzing with pleasure. Aftertaste is of the combination citrus and floral hop bitterness that coats the tongue nicely and doesn't let go. Just about what I expect from a DIPA like this. However what really sets this apart is how drinkable it is- despite its 8% ABV, I don't taste any booziness or heat at all, and it's scary how quickly this 510ml bottle disappeared. I'm not 100% sure what it is about this beer but I just want to keep drinking it. Also, when I'm in Philly, it's crazy how quickly 3 pints of Pliny and $22.50 disappears in a night out at Monk's.  Overall: A fresh DIPA that deserves the vast majority of the hype it gets on this site. Great drinkability, awesome complexity with its balance of bready malt sweetness and bitter hop characteristics , which is slightly skewed towards the hops. It's also a great looking beer for its class. An incredible beer that is a standard bearer for the west-coast DIPA. I have had this and Heady Topper and I can confidently say I would rather have Pliny over Heady if I could only choose one to drink for the rest of my life.",Russian River Brewing Company,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,100
863,7971,oddb0d,4.56,"Just a great solid West Coast IPA. They just do it very well. It is pretty traditional in it's taste compared with some of the newer beers. That being said, it's a great beer. If PTY is on tap I'm drinking that. It's a no brainer.  Nice amount of carbonation, great hoppiness without a bitter after taste. If you can get it, definitely try it. That being said don't beat yourself up to get this beer. A really good local IPA craft brew in many cities (at least on the west coast) can do something that is really just as good in my opinion. There is a lot of buzz which I think is making people over sell this beer.",Russian River Brewing Company,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,100

Good value; paid $6 for a pint. They give you the bottling date on the bottle...mine was 1/29; tasted today 2/16.

Taste is awesome, everything a double IPA should be, bitter, piney and aggressive. What makes this beer different for me is the smoothness as well and after a lot of hops it has a very smooth and clean finish with some lingering bitterness. Overall an incredible beer that I wish was more accessible and not so difficult to get. Got a few brought back from cali from a co-worker on a business trip. Had a another friend out that way this weekend and he was having difficulty finding it.

863,7971,jethrow44,4.44,"Major thanks to lymph for throwing this in as an extra. Bottled on 1/29/2013 Enjoyed on 2/15/2013  A: Crystal clear copper-orange . Pours a half finger off-white head that dissipates quickly leaving a small presence of a head. Decent lacing left behind with good retention. This is a gorgeous looking beer and I was surprised how clear it is.  S: Mostly orange notes at first with slight grapefruit and pine. Some presence of alcohol. As it warms the grapefruit and pine take over making the beer smell even better. Not as potent as other DIPAs but still a great smelling beer.  M: Medium bodied all around. Surprised how heavy it felt resting on my palate but has perfect carbonation.  T: My favorite part of the beer. Mostly grapefruit up front with some pine in the finish. The warmer the beer gets the more the pine comes out and stays with you until the next sip. Picked up a small amount of pineapple just before finishing the glass making this beer really enjoyable over a period of time. The grapefruit and pine blend perfectly together especially with time.  D: Dangerously easy to drink considering how bitter the beer actually is. Absolutely no presence of alcohol. Leaves a dry finish which is exactly what I was expecting. Left my mouth a bit dry after the glass was empty. This is a very balanced beer. I had to pace myself so I could enjoy it over time.  O: There is a reason for the hype and the Elder definitely delivers. I enjoyed every aspect of this beer. The taste has the perfect balance of citrus fruits, pine, and bitterness. I cannot get over how much grapefruit was in the beer. It looks gorgeous and smells even better. If you haven’t had this beer yet, seek it out! You won’t be disappointed.",Russian River Brewing Company,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,100
863,7971,Denmark,4.67,"Wonderful beer. But it's hard to stand a chance when the little brother is simply superior. And I just had Pliny the Younger before tasting this one. If not, the mouthfeel of Pliny the Elder would have seemed so much better to me. But this one makes it a close second in my book. However, the taste is lacking the smoothness and the smell is lacking the freshness of Pliny the Younger.

Just can't get over how clear and a perfect color for the style this is.  Smell: A big punch of orange up front which surprised me. This is followed up by a great pine balance to this orange citrus. Not a ""wow"" in the smell but just about right with everything in balance.  Taste: Seems like a reversal of the nose because I get much more pine in the taste than the citrus and orange that was so huge in the nose. Actually seems like the resin hops show up here as well leaving an outstanding slightly bitter aftertaste. I get a bit of sweetness up front but the piney, grassy, resin hops shine mid and in the back of the palate. Alcohol is non existent.  Mouthfeel: Medium bodied with a fairly high level of carbonation creating a bit of a bite. This is quite oily and coats the palate some.  Overall: This is an awesome DIPA for sure. If I had regular access to this it is one that I would enjoy when I could. Is it over hyped?

Big tropical notes, smell is out of this world.  Mouthfeel-Everything you want it to be.  Taste-Big tropical notes just like the smell. It is perfectly balanced, the hops shine in the beginning then the malt comes and engages everything greatly. Towards the end its all tropical fruits again, all pineapple and grapefruit shining on the palate.  Overall-I thought, ""No way does this live up to the hype"". But boy was I wrong.

Deffnitely a hop bomb here,  Taste: Piney bitterness up front, that turns to sweet citrus fruits in the middle of the mouth, and finally finishes again with a nice burst of bitterness that turns to a bone dry finish.

A: nice 1 finger off white head, holds for a while than fades, but leaves some great lacing. The beer is slightly dark orange in color. The cup used could have been better.  S: A great balance of citrus, pine, and a slight bread / malt presence. Very floral and amazing just too just smell  T: Citrus and pine from the hops right away coats the tongue and leaves a lingering bitter-sweetness. Not to drying, but it makes its bitter presence known, some light malt comes through. Smooth body with a hoppy, piney or (peppery?) after-taste. Nice carbonation.  O: Worth the hype, so glad I was given the opportunity to try this beer! It met my expectations yet it was a very modest beer that just hit all the right marks.

Super hop forward with tons of spice with a long bitter, but mellow finish. Seems like drinking hop nectar.

He is a beer nut who has travelled and brings in the best possible tap beers to his place in the Adams Morgan Area.of DC.  Brought several bottles of Pliny the Elder and Row 2 Hill 56 growler. He treated them with the utmost respect (buried in Ice and chilled glasses).  He has his seriously snobby beer friends around the bar and pours each of them a taste. It was so funny to hear the gasps like they were having an orgasm...no kidding. They proclaimed that this was the best beer ever in that bar. He carries some serious Belgium Ales and microbrews on tap from around the world. It was unanimous. Blown away with the Row 2 Hill 56. They identified the unusual hop taste.

S: Sourdough bread, accentuated with a little honey, buttery, with light floral and fresh grass components.  T: Bitter pine, but not too much so. Light bready flavor. Slightly acidic, with a touch of sweetness.  M: Although bitter, has something of a full hearty feel. Dry finish. Not much aftertaste.  D: Mmmm. I recommend sip and savor, although a smooth experience puts up little resistance despite the inflated alcohol content.  Atmosphere is really strong.

863,7971,Somebody_Else,4.94,"Poured into a pint glass.  First off, I don't think ""appearance"" should be rated. Described: yes, rated: no.  If you follow the BJCP Style Guideline, Pliny should have ""Good head stand with off-white color should persist"" and this beer has practically no head and that doesn't matter. So I gave it full marks because, screw it; it's meaningless; and I don't think it should detract.  Yes, I almost rated this a 5 across the board and I would NEVER turn one down if offered. I don't care if it was Sunday and I was on my way to church, I'd risk the wrath of the lord to drink a pint slowly and deliberately. But there are several beers in this class which are so equal as no matter, especially if you factor in price and availability.  This delightfully hoppy brew has everything I want in a California IPA. The nose is fresh and smells like Sonoma County. But that's not its strong suit.  This beer is clearly all about the flavor. And I guess ""mouth feel"" but I am just about ambivalent about that as ""appearance."" But screw that -- back to flavor. Forget all that fruity talk... it's hops. Delicious, crisp, bitter, resin-y, persistent hops. And it delivers in spades! This beer is a romantic ode to the hop, bless its heart.  And that resiny persistence which allows me to recycle that rich luscious flavor long after it has been swallowed! That is another high point for me. I believe this beer has earned its reputation at the top of the heap. Russian River Brewing Company, I salute you!  I think Little Sumpin' Sumpin' beats this in a smell test, but Pliny roars up from behind and trumps the fresh hop taste.  If someone asked me to defend the hop-forward movement -- be an apologist for it -- I would strive to get this for them to drink.",Russian River Brewing Company,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,100
863,7971,Omnium,3.55,"A - Slightly hazy yellow/orange, poured with not too much head, which I like.  S - An abundance of citrus and pine, light hints of floral qualities. Excellent aroma, that should be appreciated.  T - Citrus hop flavoring scattered with pine and light malt.  M - Light, and fresh, but fades insanely fast.  O - The famed, the highly acclaimed, pinnacle, grail, apex of double IPA's is nothing more than an absolute disappointment. Disgustingly over-hyped beer that is good, but not worthy of even half of the praise it gets. Bottled on 12/27/12 for all 3 bottles I acquired, consumed on 1/23, 1/24, and 1/26. Got these from a friend, and for getting this across country I consider it pretty fresh. What good flavors are here disappear nearly instantly. The aroma is great, but taste definitely leaves you wanting more. It seems, and this is just a guess, that the hops were added later in the brew, leaving you with just enough flavor to get what should be there. I expended too many resources to acquire not only one, but three bottles. And with each session, I got a slightly different taste from each. The best thing I enjoyed about this beer is its easy to drink. The 8% could sneak up on you, but its masked very well.  I can think of at least 20 other IPA's I've had that outrank this in every aspect, if you haven't had it, don't go too far out of your way to get it.

The head settles quickly into a thin bubbly layer along the edges of the glass. There is a good amount of lacing as it drinks.  S: The nose is big pine, and juicy orange citrus. It's not over the top pungent. It's just right. This beer smells great (ever after a month).  T: I am met straight away with a light malty sweetness, which transitions into huge juicy orange citrus, followed by some floral qualities. As it moves to the middle, I get a ton of spicy pine notes, but it's balanced well by the hops. The pine notes linger as the sweet malt moves off.  M: Medium bodied beer. It's sweet right away, gets big and hoppy in the middle, turns spicy and stinging towards the end, and finishes smooth.

Overall - Overall this is a very solid dipa. I hate to be the minority when I say that I was a little disappointed. I do not feel that this beer lives upto the hype.

Sticky lacing slides down the glass slowly leaving a jagged ring behind.  S- Punchy west coast hop aroma with great notes of pineapple, grapefruit, papaya and mango. Also a touch of malty sweetness beneath the tropical fruit. Delightful.  T- More grassy in the flavor with some cannabis notes as well as bright citrus. The bitterness is strong but still balanced enough to let the other flavors work within the overall profile. Juicy, smooth and hardly the amount of alcohol taste one would expect from an 8% beer.

Taste- Wonderful. Very balanced, probably the most refined Imperial IPA I've had. The bitterness is very well done, tons of hop flavor, and nice malt notes. Piney, pineapple notes, typical of such a hop bill. As the beer warms, mango and citrus come out to play, as well.  Mouthfeel- Smooth, dry, crisp, and not hot at all. Again, very refined for the style.  Overall- This did not disappoint at all. Way more balanced than I anticipated, and while it is immensely hoppy, it's not overpowering. Yeah, it would probably make a light beer drinker cry, but for a hophead homebrewer, this is a great reminder that a great IIPA isn't always just about tons of hops.

Wouldn't describe it as pungent as much as I would say it's fragrant. Very piney, citrusy, hoppy from the first smell. The beer poured a clear dark golden color with a fingernail length of head. First sip produces great waves of hops over the tongue followed by a citrusy balance. The result is an extremely clean and crisp IPA dominated by hoppiness without an apologetic malt backing. The mouthfeel is slightly effervescent, but not overwhelming so, just enough to make the beer refreshing as well as delicious. Definitely has high drinkability (if you were somehow able to get a lot of it!) My final verdict, Pliny the Elder is the prime example of the perfect IPA, everything you'd expect from the style. Russian River advertises that their beers are meticulously made, and Pliny exemplifies that. Pliny is often compared to Heady Topper. If you stack both of them side by side, it comes to a matter of personal preference. Pliny seems to be a more refined experience, while Heady Topper is like the race gas of IPAs. But don't take my word for it! Seek out both and enjoy, then decide for yourself!",Russian River Brewing Company,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,100
863,7971,Sarlacc83,4.41,"Bottle from 12.27.12. Consumed 1-13-13.  A; Clear golden yellow with champagne bubbles. Nicely carbonated head. A quick swirl leaves a treacly cascade.  N: Blend of citrus and pine. Medicinal, grapefruit, pineapple, mango, and earth. Grass and minor levels of biscuit.  T: So incredibly balanced and tasty. Pine and earth. Pineapple, mango, grapefruit. Has a lush deep fragrance of hops backed by a hint of malt sweetness. Peppercorn and more spruce. Quite bitter, but deliciously so.  M: Dry, sticky, and refined. No alcohol. This is sublime.  O: Still the standard DIPA. As the hops arm race continues, it’s a good reminder to us that we still need the all around complete version that doesn’t succumb to over-hopping or exotic varietals. Drink it, enjoy it, love it.",Russian River Brewing Company,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,100

It is cloudy but still semi-translucent no floaters  S: fresh citrus hop bomb heaven you can distinctly smell the hops and their freshness but also lots of orange and other citrus scents. I am very impressed this is way better then I remember it to be.  T: As before this is a fresh hoppy dipa with a great upfront hop taste that stays true as this beer is more well balanced then any dipa I have ever tasted as you get the tastes of the hops and bitterness but it is barely there in terms of power and makes this extremely drinkable while being true to its hop character it really is very impressive  M: crisp up front while being extremely smooth throughout and oily but not too much. Extremely drinkable with the alcohol being completely hidden and will come up on you fast if you do not take your time. Not thick but more thick then thin not watery or completely resiny but there is definitely some in there.  O: Lets start with ""the comparison"" heady topper is my favorite beer I like it better (I have tasted them back to back) but that being said I do not think they compare well HT is a hop bomb and Pliny is a balanced hop forward dipa for me there is a big difference and they are both great.

863,7971,djjacobsen,4.84,"Oh Pliny...the benchmark of all IPAs. It is fresh, it is piney, it is bitter, it is well, worth it! Some say its over-hyped, some say its the best beer in the world. I say it is the best rounded out IPA you could ask for. Its extremely drinkable. It has a great bitter component. It finishes great on the palate. Fruity, floral, earthy and piney tones all round out a great nose and taste. Super balanced. its never too much and never, not enough. I think the hype was over done, but I do think that it is a world class brew. Drink it sooner than later.",Russian River Brewing Company,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,100
863,7971,Chalkhead,3.75,"The easier to find, gentler Pliny. Great taste, STRONG like bull, awesome finish.

Aroma comes off this thing like heaven. Floral pine notes abound, with a zesty citrus on the nose. Thr flavor is a piney orange bite with a lot more body than I had expected. Citrus aftertaste balanced nicely with the malt backbone that still highlights that great hop flavor. Medium resiny mouthfeel. Very smooth. Hop candy for sure. Highly rated for good reason. I think there are a couple I like better in the style, but this is awesome.",Russian River Brewing Company,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,100
863,7971,Hamburgers,4.29,"10 day old bottle. Pours clear copper with a finger of off-white head. Aroma is piney with notes of tropical fruit and a touch of funk.

863,7971,Chadhowie,4.8,"Got a chance at a bottle of this while at Martin's Gastropub in Palo Alto. They only had 14 bottles left and I hadn't tried it yet, so I snagged one. Right off the bat, I loved it. One of the best beers I'd had. This class of beers is currently my favorite class and this beer sits at the top of the class.",Russian River Brewing Company,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,100
863,7971,Oakenator,4.74,"Pours golden yellow with a decent head. Complex lacing left on the glass but head disappeared to a rim. Smells of piney hops. Taste is big piney hops, but somehow also balanced and not over the top. Citrus undertone may help to smooth the hops. Caramel sweetness up front turns to an excellent bitter bite on the back.",Russian River Brewing Company,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,100
863,7971,Labeorphile,4.88,"Fresh and poured from bottle into a chalice glass.  Good clear straw color with a sticky thin head that leaves good lacing down the glass.  Lots of grapefruity hops in the nose and in the taste. I really like the hop varieties that Russian River uses, as compared to the more pine cone like hops in the Sierra Nevada offerings.  Lots of small bubbles and a slightly thin mouth make this a great IPA.  Well worth the effort spent to obtain it.",Russian River Brewing Company,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,100
863,7971,HugeBulge,4.05,"Pliny is a good Ipa, I look it as the best of the average and a baseline for a good ipa. Looks pretty clear and filtered, smells good with a nice body.

863,7971,KELPAK,4.84,"Fantastic IPA poured from the bottle into a tulip stem glass. I was fortunate enough to have this in the same night as the Heady Topper and Harpoon Leviathan IPA.  Smell: The nose has a great floral aroma with a citrus background  Apperance: remarkably clean with a golden amber tint. You can see straight through to the floor when drinking from a glass.  Taste: The first thing that hits you is the great hop taste with the citrus not to far behind as the smell had hinted at when you first open the bottle.  Mouthfeel: Smooth and crisp leaving the consumer wanting more long after the bottle has been drained.  Overal this is a fantastic IPA that anyone would be forunate enough to recieve and savor. However, i do believe i have to give Heady Topper the nod in my personal tasting.",Russian River Brewing Company,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,100
863,7971,IPA4LIFE,4.96,"Bottled on 27 December 2012, tasted/reviewed on 12 January 2013. Bottle poured into a tulip glass.  A- Crystal-clear honey golden color. Fluffy white head that drops pretty quickly, leaving a nice trail of clingy lacing sticking to the side of the glass.  S- OH. MY. GOD. This smells pretty much like burying your face in a bag full of hops. Sharp citrus zest, big and bold. Also lots of pine. The hops are really strong in this beer (I guess that kinda goes without saying, but it needs to be said). Overall, big grapefruit zest, a little mango, and some strong pine.  T- Surprisingly balanced. There is an initial malty sweetness that meets up with some wonderful fruity hop notes to make a flavor resonate of fresh buttered biscuits with orange marmalade. At the back of the palate there sits a solid bitterness that transitions from the orange marmalade notes to flavors of bitting into a fresh grapefruit. The lingering bitterness is complimented by a slight warming hint of booze, leaving the flavors to linger on the drinkers tongue for a long, long time.  M- Carbonation is great. Nice smooth mouthfeel. The body is thin enough to not distract, but thin enough to let the flavors come through.  O- Probably the perfect IPA. This beer is everything an IPA should be. Super hoppy, but clearly not made without regard for the malt characteristics of the beer. The malt bill is made to support the hops fully, and the balance is perfect. If I had to have one more beer before I died, fresh Pliny the Elder would be my choice without doubt. Best beer I have ever had.",Russian River Brewing Company,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,100
863,7971,TrevorWGrover,4.91,"I've had this beer for the first time on tap at the Tornado gastropub in North Park, San Diego.  It may be the perfect IPA. Citrus-fruity-sweetness helps balance Russian River's most popular hoppy IPA. I don't have it in front of me right now so I won't try to be too specific but I will say this beer lived up to the ridiculously high expectations created by hop-heads everywhere.  I do remember there was a poor head when the pretty young girl at the bar handed me my pint glass... so that is really the only flaw.",Russian River Brewing Company,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,100
863,7971,Spectre,4.21,"I have had this beer bottled and on tap. Not much of a difference.  A. Clear gold with thick white head.  S. has a strong piney smell, let's you know what your in for.  T. Great flavor for an IPA not too bitter.  Enjoy a sip at a time, do not burry the hatchet.

863,7971,Stephonovich,4.51,"Appearance Poured into a freshly wetted pint glass. Thick white head, which slowly dissipated. Color is dark straw.  Smell Fresh cut grass, wet forest, resinous pine, juniper  Taste Hop assault, heavy on Simcoe. Nicely balanced light malt background, which melodiously blends with the tapering bitter aftertaste of the hops. No alcohol burn.  Overall Awesome IPA - not too hard hitting on any one front, but does everything well. Heady Topper has a better aroma, IMO, but this is quite good.",Russian River Brewing Company,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,100

I won't go into a lot of detail because it's been so long, just the things that stuck out. The smell was amazing! I know lots of people talk about it but it was amazing. Sooo much Simcoe. As far as the hop taste, it makes it very evident that hop profile is more than just IBU's. Definitely big on Simcoe but I suspect Columbus, Centennial and maybe Cascades. I'm sure it died off a bit as it was almost a month and a half old when I had it but this was one of the only beers I have ever had where I started writing clone notes while I was drinking it.",Russian River Brewing Company,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,100

T- sweet pineapple, star fruit, and other tropical fruits, melon, slightly bready, lots of pine, fresh floral hops. So juicy. M- per usual for style O- very drinkable, lots of delicious juicy tropical fruits, piney floral hop profile, and it leaves a great finish, not overly bitter and perfectly balanced throughout.

A...pours clear, honey yellow with a white fluffy head. Lots of vey sticky lacing down glass.  S...wish I could rate the smell higher than a 5. Lots of floral smell at first, like a bouquet of fresh flowers. Then there is wonderful pine resin scent in here. I just want to push my nose right into this brew it smells incredible.  T...wow! I didn't think this could live up to the hype but it does. Hop head paradise. Every bit of that great nose is in the taste and then some. Lots of hops right up front that have a punch in the mouth bitterness without the over done malts like a lot of DIPAs. It gets a peppery tingle in your mouth before letting into an earhty pine flavor and finishes quick and crisp.  M...perfectly done. Carbo is just right and gives it a light mouthfeel even with such a full taste.  O...this is right on the money. It is hard to be better than this. I thaught I would be let down after finally tracking down this exceptionally rated brew but, I was not. Every bit as great as I would have hoped.

As you inhale there is a smells of pine, pineapple, and assorted citrus. The smell alone is wonderful. It definitely helps build as you wait to finally take a sip of this beer. There is a strong hop taste. It is not overpowering but there in your face none- the- less. In the background you get some of the taste from the citrus you just finished smelling. There is medium carbonation and it feels crisp and light on your tongue. It goes down quite smoothly.

A: Clear liquid gold  S: Tons of grapefruit, some pine and other assorted citrus, really fantastic  T: Huge grapefruit hops right off the bat with a beautifully balanced malt finish. This flavor balance is the reason why I love DIPAs and Pliny absolutely nails it.  M: Pretty smooth and consistent with nice carbonation  O: My number 1 beer easily, nothing but good things to say. Worth all the hype and then some. Don't get me wrong, I enjoy other DIPAs (esp Abrasive), but Pliny is Pliny.

Taste is similar to the smell. Citrus and pine dominate with a very subtle sweetness from the malt way in the background. So much hop flavor without being even slightly overly bitter. So very well balanced and such little alcohol taste.  M: Crisp, nice carb. So very drinkable.  O: At one point this was without a doubt the best beer I've ever had. I have encountered better beers (and better IPAs) since then but this beer will always remain legendary to me. Unfortunately, I've noticed a bit of variation in Pliny over the last 6 months or so but this particular 11 day old bottle was phenomenal.",Russian River Brewing Company,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,100

Nice full flavored without the overpowering hop flavor that usually just fills you up. Tastes like a fresh hop beer.  Mouthfeel: Light and thin. Sharp on the tongue and very clean.  Overall: Great beer! I would probably keep this in my fridge all the time if it weren't so damn hard to come buy. It's an extremely refined IPA. Would be a great summer IPA because it's not so heavy; it goes down easier than most IPAs.

Reeks of grapefruit and pine. Pure hoppiness (pun not intended). Tastes beautiful, no hints of anything. Full on flavor of hops, citrus, dryness. Light and refreshing, but substantial and satisfying at the same time. Great for all seasons, a rare quality. Mouthfeel - you will remember you just had an DIPA.

Pours a clear golden color with an inch or so of head, decent retention, a little lacing. What is REALLY AMAZING about this beer is the aroma; never have I smelled such a delicious scent; pure grapefruit hoppy deliciousness. Taste is of course great, perhaps not as good as other DIPAs that I've had (Heady Topper and Dreadnaught come to mind) but nonetheless, very, very good.  I would think no BAs who happen across this beer will think, ""Eh, it's too hyped I won't try it"" but, should you come across it without having tried it, BUY IT. The smell alone is worth the money.

Smells like earth, grass, pine, and a bag of ""herbs"".  Taste is sweet, nutty malts balanced by piney hops and tropical fruits. No alcohol flavor with just a touch of mint in the aftertaste.  Mouth feel is smooth and velvety. Creamy and prickly carbonation with a medium body. Slightly wet finish with just a bit of alcohol warmth.  Overall, a great beer. Worth the hype.",Russian River Brewing Company,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,100
863,7971,RickS95,4.94,"Pours an orangey apricot color, maybe peach. Not clear, not cloudy, something in between. The head is a finger thick and fleeting, mostly white. When all is said and done, it's a peach colored drink with a white ring around the top edge with a splash of lace.  OMG what a smell. It's like you're walking into a citrus forest, mostly pineapple, with an occasional pine tree mixed in. Just enough biscuity smell to give the citrus something to stand on.  The taste matches the smell. It's all citrus with a bit of pine. Oily resiny pine, all kinds of citrus flavors, with a bready taste. As you'd guess, the hops stay with you well into swallow.  It's sweet from the citrusy hops, then a bit acidic as the beer moves its way back. Once it hits the back of your tongue, it's all oily bitter. The hops coat and stick to your tongue just so you can enjoy the finish even longer. Extremely smooth for a DIPA.  Overall, it's everything everyone has ever said about it. It's the easiest DIPA I've ever had. Despite being what it is, it's very smooth and really is without fault.",Russian River Brewing Company,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,100

Fresh and bold flavors of citrus, bitter grassy hops, and a perfect balance of creamy malts. The lingering aftertaste is unique and really adds to the overall experience.

Did that with this one, but I was not disappointed, which is saying a lot.  Aside from terms used in the million other reviews, the main thing I want to add is how DRY this baby finishes!

Very inviting on the nose.  The color is a beautiful dark copperish variety, and looks like an ipa.  The mouth feel is thick enough but not too thick, and the texture this beer makes you want more.  The taste is an absolute 10 out of 10. One of the best beers I've ever had in this ABV range.

Pours a medium marigold, almost no head and minimal lacing on the top.  S: Easily the best smelling beer my nose has sniffed. My family puts up an artificial Christmas tree now, and the pine-iness of this beer brought me back to a smell from my youth.  T: Hop punch. But not in an obnoxious way. As a major hophead, this is basically what I am seeking in hopload from virtually any other IPA I try. As I write this, I am about 10 small sips in and can feel the 'hop tongue' settling in. Good thing I didn't want to try any other beers tonight after this.  M: VERY carbonated. Medium swallowability...definitely not a session beer, but not the thickest of beverages I've imbibed.  O: This one was incessantly hyped to me by a former colleague from the West Coast. He finally sent me one in a bottle share and...it's worth the hype. The pine makes me want to run through a Northwest forest searching for something, I don't know what, until I feel the need to sit down on a log in the midst of everything and pour myself one of these beers while I rest.

A- Poured into a tulip glass, elegantly murky orange bordering on an almost tan(ish) in the correct light. Two finger head on this particular pour.  S- Fresh Pliny smells like a dream, citrus, piney and of course hop characters.  T- Picture a hot summer day and your thirsty. You have a craving for a particular drink, let's say lemonade for this example, and nothing else will satisfy quite the same. After having Pliny every day becomes that hot summer day. I'm not saying Pliny is the absolute and indisputable best beer or anything like that, but what I am saying is nothing satisfies quite like Pliny. Delicious citrus, mellow but present bitterness and a superbly clean finsish. Textbook definition of refreshing.  M- Satisfyingly cleansing mouthfeel. Not too thin but not syrupy either, brilliant.

As it warms, notes of pineapple and other fruit make themselves known. Nice and complex. Very fresh. T: starts out surprisingly sweet, a nod to the malts that do a great job providing balance. The pineapple and fruit notes come forward soon after. Nice transition. Toward the back is where the pines and hops come through. However, its not overbearing. The perfect amount, I'd say. M: medium to high carbonation with a body sharing similar characteristics. Unexpectedly and impressively creamy. There's a smooth and bitter finish, but one that begs for another taste. O: what I really enjoy about this beer is pronounced flavor profile and incredible balance. The 8% ABV is well hidden and the brew is quite quaffable.

S: Pine and citrus hop aromas. I also think it smells like some really good weed.  T: Grassy, piney, and citrus flavors along with a slight bready malt backbone. Nice and bitter. Hides the alcohol very well.  M: Medium bodied with good carbonation. Easy to drink.  O: After my first sip, I was saying ""I don't know if this lives up to all the hype."" But after drinking it a little more I think it does. It's extremely easy to drink, especially for an 8% ABV beer. It has an enormous amount of hops, but it also has some malts there to balance them somewhat. I wouldn't say it's a perfect IPA, but it's pretty close. I'll gladly drink one anytime I can get my hands on one.",Russian River Brewing Company,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,100

863,7971,JeffBlue,4,"(Draft) Finally tried this beer last month at the Russian River Brewing Restaurant and it lived up to all the hype. Just the right amount of hoppiness with a fantastic finish. Right up there with many of my Lagunitas favs. Check out other selections from Russian River Brewing...they do not disappoint. (October 2012) 4.5  12/10/16, first revisit of this great beer in at least a couple years (bottled version this time) and this is still just as good.  2/12/17 (draft at the BIstro in Hayward) Maybe a bit unfair to drop my rating a notch, as it preceeded by a different beer (Alimony, Buffalo BIlls) but this time it was very good, just not as phenomenal as previous tastes 4.0",Russian River Brewing Company,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,100

A-coppery orange with 1 finger nice head with zero floaties. Very pretty beer.  S-Piney, grapefruit, citra hop dankness. breadiness/caramel malt backbone  T-wow!! didn't sip my HT yet but this did to me what HT did my first time having. piney, tart lemon peel, pine is more dominent than citrus.  M-coats the nooks and crannies of my mouth. Very drinkable, very very drinkable. Perfect carbonation.  Compared to HT...The main difference is that HT has more of that citrus, mango fruity hop and has a shiste load of floaties. I feel that HT uses a Hop extract while PtE doesn't. I enjoy the HT about .0001% better. Lovely!!",Russian River Brewing Company,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,100
863,7971,biboergosum,4.27,"510ml (?) bottle, 14 days old - fresher than I would ever really have expected. As I was approaching my 2500th review, I was at a bit of a loss as to which beer would be (potentially) worthy enough to mark this particular signpost of mine. Lo and behold, and damned near out of the blue, comes this early Christmas present, from the good DoktorZee - many, many thanks! Into my Laughing Dog Yankee pint glass this goes, in honour of my first bastion of hoppy indoctrination.  This beer pours a slightly hazy, pale golden amber hue, with three fingers of thick, bulbous, and melted marshmallow eggshell-white head, which leaves some broad streaks of sea-spray lace around the glass as it gently slinks away.  It smells of pungent tropical fruit - pineapple, papaya, and blood orange - a bit more pedestrian lemon and grapefruit pith, with some resinous pine needles and musty florals, all over a lightly bready, softly caramelized pale malt. The taste is bitter aged citrus rind - kind of a Cali fruit salad of orange, lemon, and grapefruit - all fresh and in your face, but, um, nice about it. Some further floral, perfumed hops flesh things out, until the unassuming caramel malt supporting act kicks in, along with a slowly simmering, mostly under the radar booziness.  The bubbles are pretty laid-back, just eking out their paycheck, the body a decently sturdy medium weight, and tacitly smooth - the hops and booze respectably keeping their distance. It finishes off-dry, but just barely, the melange of hops contending more with some uppity alcohol.  An on the level, well-rendered DIPA - you get your hop fix, in spades, and yet the inherent balance remains steadfast. I gotta say, it delivers, and though it isn't perfect, what really is? I can see why the hype exists, and will indeed persist.",Russian River Brewing Company,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,100
863,7971,tectactoe,4.87,"Finally got to try this one thanks to Johnny Ramirez. Can't thank him enough! This has been on my wants list as long as I can remember. Pours a perfect amber color with amazing clarity - something not necessarily expected from a DIPA. Very clean looking with a long-lasting head, super white, thick, and foamy.  The aroma is, bluntly put, motherfucking outrageous. Simply amazing. Heavy ass pineapple and citrus aroma, right along with orange zest and lemon. Hops-to-the-walls; piney, leafy, floral, perfume-like. This amazing balance on the nose between sweet-bitter and fruit-hops is incredible. The pineapple kills me - powerful and pure, not fake or artificial in any way. A total forest of hops, trees, pines, fruits, mangos, pineapples, etc. I want a goddamn Pliny the Elder air freshener.  The taste starts off with an up-front smash of hops; wet, bitter, and assertive, but not harsh, overpowering, or off-putting. These hops are perfect in every way. Piney, oily, and resinous. Alcohol presence is noticeable but never intrudes and is always welcomed. Heavy malt backbone balances everything perfectly. The sweetness from the pineapples and mangos are well-timed and synchronize perfectly with the hops. The flavor profile on this beer is executed eloquently and masterfully. Medium-thick body, mild stickiness, perfect carbonation.  I was scared the hype would ruin this for me. How can a beer seriously live up to the ridiculous amount of hype that Pliny regularly gets? Not only did it live up to those expectations, it surpassed them. I promised myself I wouldn't be swayed by the reviews and wouldn't ""say I liked it, just to like it"" - but it's impossible. There's a reason this beer is so highly acclaimed. It's ridiculously amazing.",Russian River Brewing Company,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,100

Bitter finish that lingers. Bright citrus notes with malty backbone.  M: Medium body, medium carbonation with crisp, dry finish.  O: Great beer, but competition is tough these days. A few years ago this was my favorite IPA/DIPA, but with the popularity of the style, there are so many other great West Coast IPAs these days that this one, while delicious, doesn't stand out above the rest in any real way.",Russian River Brewing Company,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,100

S: There are light to moderate aromas of grapefruit in the nose. T: The taste has flavors of grapefruit, notes of caramel malts and hints of pine resin. M: It feels medium-bodied and very crisp on the palate and has a moderate amount of carbonation. O: This beer is very drinkable and has no trace of alcohol in the taste. It also has an excellent balance between the malts and the hops.",Russian River Brewing Company,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,100

Absolutely perfect  Taste - A wave of tropical fruit pours over the tongue with pineapple leading the way. This transforms into a piney resin hop flavor that leaves the mouth coated and wanting more  Mouthfeel - Smooth and decently thick at the same time. Perfect amount of carbonation  Overall - This is one of the best IPA/DIPA's I have ever had and it is well deserving of all of the accolades it receives. The aroma is magnificent and the wave of flavors on the hop bill are absolutely perfect. A must have,Russian River Brewing Company,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,100
863,7971,BirdsandHops,4.13,"Bottled 11/1/12, so a little over a month old.  A: Pours a clear honey gold with a finger of white head that fades into a thin ring with a little lacing.  S: Bright citrus up front with pineapple, oranges, and some grapefruit. Mostly just sweet citrus here with few earthy notes. Simple, but quite nice.  T: Citrusy here as well, with pineapple and grapefruit dominating at first before some resin and pine notes kick in for a finish that is lightly bitter and earthy. Oddly, several seconds after each sip, I get a much stronger and more lingering bitterness.  M: Body is on the lighter side of medium with a decent amount of carbonation, giving this beer a nice bite to go with the hops.  O: A good DIPA overall. Not the best out there by any means, but definitely a great example of the style. I wish the aftertaste weren't so bitter and the nose were a bit more pungent, but other than that it's a very enjoyable beer.",Russian River Brewing Company,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,100

A: Translucent, honey-amber in color. White/off white two finger head on the pour. Quickly recedes, but lacing is decent as i drink.  S: Sweet flowers (Simcoe?), grapefruit, piney/resinous hops. Light bready malts. Slight tinge of alcohol.  T: Grapefruit! Orange. Wonderful balance of hop blast amidst a malt backbone. Pretty much the standard, IMO, for DIPA balance and perfection. For a straight hop fix I might choose several of the HF line or HT, but this is one for the ages. I'm thankful that I am lucky enough to taste all of these great beers on a regular basis.  M: Medium.

863,7971,rickyleepotts,3.67,"Boy, am I excited about this one. We ended up in San Diego for Thanksgiving this year, and being so close to the Russian River Company, I just had to track down a bottle of this. This beer is VERY rare, but not as rare as Pliny the Younger. That beer, from what I hear, is only available at the brewery and is only available a few times a year. But this beer is bottled, but is also rare. I didn’t realize that until I started calling around. I called BevMo! first, and was informed they don’t even carry it. I started calling liquor stores around the area (we were in La Jolla) and found a really small wine shop that had two bottles left. It was 10 miles away, but we went to find it and grabbed the last two bottles.  The guy behind the counter suggested we try one right away, and then try the other bottle in two weeks. This is a beer that will NOT cellar, and actually tastes better the quicker you drink it. Ours were bottled on November 1st, 2012. So tonight, after a long wait, we are drinking a bottle of Pliny the Elder. I. Can’t. Wait. Bottoms up, people!  In the Glass: It looks like a domestic in the glass. Thin, mostly clear, but a nice, impressive white head. I read on BeerAdvocate that the lace was nice, but I am not seeing a good lace here. But who cares? When I started to pour this, I could smell it. That is my focus! Let’s see what happens when I stick my nose in the glass. I might actually stick my nose in the beer this time… it is Pliny after all!  Nose: It smells like an IPA. That’s good, because I like that style. It is my favorite style, actually. But the nose isn’t overwhelming. People say this beer “isn’t worth the hype”. I hope the nose isn’t a prelude to that. I am sick of waiting. Let’s drink!  Flavor: It’s an IPA. I will give it that. It’s good, but it’s not overly hopped. The aftertaste, which I will get to in a minute, is the best part. They call this a double IPA… and like other double IPAs on the market, I wouldn’t consider them “double” based on my ideas of the word. The bottle reminds us to drink this fresh, and not to age it. Our bottle is nearly a month old, but it shouldn’t/wouldn’t be bad… yet. We will be trying our second bottle in two weeks.  Mouthfeel: The mouthfeel is elegant. Very thin on the palate, and easy to swallow. This is what some might call a “chugging” beer. Don’t chug it, though. it’s too expensive. The bottle also recommends drinking this cold. We did. For a beer with this much hype, I must admit… I had bigger expectations.  Aftertaste: This is the best part of this beer. The aftertaste is big, and hangs on for several minutes after you swallow. That is my favorite part of a double IPA… the lingering bitterness that the beer brings. This one packs a punch at the beginning, and lingers… but always reminding you an IPA has been enjoyed. This isn’t a beer I would recommend trying first, as it will destroy your palate.  Pliny the Elder is good. But it’s not great. The beer is VERY hard to find, and while not very expensive when you do, not that impressive. There are some unique characteristics here, but nothing to write home about. I wanted to like this more than I do, and while it is still a good IPA… it’s just that. An IPA. I wasn’t impressed with Dark Lord, either. There is too much hype over beers like that. Maybe that is what spoils it for me. Not sure. But Pliny the Elder is just that… a hyped beer that doesn’t live up to the hype. BeerAdvocate rates this 100. So do the bros. Would love to discuss this beer with them further. I can’t give it more than a 3.

It transitions nicely from hops to citrus to freshly baked bread malt. Heavy on piney hops, but I love that stuff.  M: Soft, good levels of carbonation.

This beer stands out from your centennial, cascade blast of most. It is full of love! I never give a five! Hint of fresh juice and maybe a sweet flower. Simcoe maybe but just enough.

The nose was fruit, grass, resin, bread, malt, and hops. Taste was awesome. It had a wonderful sweet malt profile which seamlessly gave way to a massive hop bomb on the finish.

863,7971,CAMRAhardliner,5,"Bottle purchased at the brewpub a bit over a month ago.  Pours a deep clear gold with red glints. Huge beads of carbonation sustain a big, rocky head that lasts forever, coating the glass in foam. Peach, green melon, grapefruit and . Resiny fruity hop notes explode on the first sip - thick, fresh lemon rind, peach, tangerine, honey dew, grapefruit and a small bit of pine. Bitterness build pretty quickly on the palate. Some honey coated biscuits make up the light malt backbone. The mouthfeel is medium bodied with a nice, velvety carbonation and some hop mouthcoating going on. A huge aromatic hop flavor and an impossibly long lasting bitterness makes up the awesome finish. Alcohol is completely hidden throughout the hop maelstrom, making this beer dangerously drinkable.  I don't give 5s willy nilly, in fact this is my first. This stuff is sublime. Its 100% worthy of the hype. Pure hop wizardry. Perfect in every way in my estimation.

Pours a hazy golden amber with impressive cream coloured head. Mouthfeel is refreshing and neither oily nor cloying, unlike some other 8% ABV DIPAs. Aroma blossoms as it warms, losing the initial boozy smell to a delightful mango and ripe tropical fruit medley.

863,7971,SkeeterBoganski,4.45,"Bottled on 8/14/12...YES, I realize this probably should have been enjoyed sooner; ""hoppy beers are not meant to be aged"", yadda x3; I hadn't encountered a Pliny until some time in August having kept my eyes open (albeit somewhat passively) for a couple of years, and then I encountered and bought 3 within a 5 week period; I was trying to save this last one as long as I felt I should, and realized it's now 2.5 months from the bottled date.  Pliny has a reputation that precedes itself, ranked regularly as one of the finest doubles; appearance is deep golden; there are some serious bubbles cranking in this, looking very effervescent; the head is massive and frothy; the lacing is sticky and staunch...after a sip the glass is barely visible from the other side.  The aromas make your mouth water; bitter citrus and grapefruit; heavy on the dank pine smell too.  The beer tastes like you think an IPA should: aggressively hop forward, slightly bitter but not overwhelmingly so; the hoppy flavors are not try, yet the beer keeps you grasping for more; there's a sweet-soapy taste on the backend and I fear it has something to do with me saving it, but feel I can remember this flavor from previous encounters; there is a tantalizing bread feel here too.  It's a smooth mouthfeel, a little cloying and just the right amount of carbonation; it goes down really smooth but leaves some sticky froth in the throat.  Obviously this is a top shelf beer and worth getting your hands on anytime...it's (usually) cheap too...only $6 for a 510ml. Russian River does a really good job with supply in that the manage to keep the demand heavy, maybe unnecessarily so but I don't work RR QC. That said, I've had better/comparable DIPAs that didn't evade me for years. If they made just a bit more of this and retained the quality, it just might be the best beer around for the money.

What I will say is that it isnt overly distinctive, rather I found its real appeal in how well it was put together. Unlike Heady Topper or Double Citra which are wonderfully artful and unique beers, Pliny the Elder seems less creative yet amazingly thought out and well planned, like amish furniture. A perfect balance and of malt and hops, both playing off each other. Sort of a fusion east coast/west coast IPA. Good body, if maybe a little thin, and lively but not intrusive carbonation. Really just perfect. This beer doesnt stike me as being a centerpiece and while Heady Topper seems somehow more interesting, I dont think you could really do too much better than Pliny the Elder.",Russian River Brewing Company,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,100
863,7971,PsilohsaiBiN,4.7,"This is my first review, and what a review it is! Not gonna lie, I'm kinda scared to even open this thing, but here we go. Bottled on 10/17/12  Smell: Hoppiness, now I'm not that versed in hops yet so I'm not gonna go rattling off specific varieties, but I'm getting a lot of hops and citrus, BAM! This is like sniffing a bouquet of flowers, which it technically is. Not sure how many hop varieties they use, but this is really like sniffing flowers, you pick out different hop strains and how some scents are ""heavier"" and ""lighter"" than the others.  Appearance: Golden beauty with a nice 1 finger head and some lively carbonation.  Taste: Delicious hoppy goodness up front, bitter in the back. Finish has notes of orange and grapefruit which linger on the tongue a bit before the next sip(if you even leave a second between sips). Bitterness lingers for a while after the sip has been consumed(this is an IPA after all).  Mouthfeel: Lots of lively carbonation with an oily, resinous consistency that coats the tongue and hangs on tight. Did I mention that this beer has a SICK amount of carbonation?  Overall: I'm very lucky to have been able to get this beer as fresh as I have. If I had anything to compare this to, it would be Lagunitas Hop Stoopid, only this is better. For what this beer is, it delivers in spades. Hops, hops, hops!!! I expected a beer that kills 90 Minute IPA, and although it is easier to drink than 90, I don't know if I'd say it's better. This is more about hops and less of the maltiness that some of the DFH IPAs are known for, and that's not a bad thing. It's different, and amazing in its own right. Only you can decide if this beer lives up to the hype, but it is great.",Russian River Brewing Company,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,100
863,7971,mick303,4.83,"Pint bottle, just over a month after the born on date. Pours a nice three fingers of soapy, rocky head, which has excellent retention. Colour is a brilliant med gold, carbonation appears fairly light. Leaves plenty of delicate curtain lace and a thick soapy film that last till the end, perfect.  Smell has a lot of pine notes, herbal hops, fresh citrus, lot of grapefruit. Malt character (fresh bread). Slight medicinal note. Very fresh, fragrant, and inspired.  Taste is bitter up front, but a sort of musty, herbal character with malt not too far behind. More pine and grapefruit, ripe pineapple, all blended seamlessly with the hops, it all feels very balanced and orchestrated. Dry grass, slight toast malt, it has plenty of herbal-ly hops but is so complex behind that and well balanced it challenges the palate to look beyond. Tons of character.  Mouthfeel is pretty full-bodied, but nicely crisp, and it drinks very nicely, alcohol is not too over bearing, slightly lozenge feel with the oiliness of the hops. A dry finish, with toasty hops, lasts long and strong. Works well, potent hop and alcohol quotient, but performs flawlessly, and very drinkable.  A heady brew, with a lot of hop character. Consumed fresh, it is inspiring, and probably the best Double IPA for its balance and complexity. It is very hard to point to where this could improve, it all works so well together. Excellent from start to finish, all put together wonderfully. If the other reviews and hype haven't driven home the point that this is one of the best beers out there, don't know what will.",Russian River Brewing Company,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,100

Aroma is good, sweet and astringent, apricot/orange and orange peel.The appearance is fine. The taste is unbalanced. The bitterness bubbles too strong to the back of the mouth leaving an unpleasant aftertaste. The palate is fine. Overall for my taste, sweetness and bitterness should have been blended better.

863,7971,brother_kenneth,5,"16oz bottle poured into a wine glass.  A- Very light in color for an IPA (or actually, double-IPA). Crystal clear golden color, as a matter of fact, with some nice bubbles from the perfect carbonation. Not a lot of head on this one.  S- Lots of citrus and hops. Definitely has the ""west coast"" smell. Absolutely wonderful smelling brew.  T- Probably one of the most perfectly balanced IPAs I have tasted. Lots of citrus and grapefruit and loads of hops, but nothing is overpowering. A nice sweetness is present, along with a nice piney flavor from the hops. Everything about this is great!  M- Tingles nicely with a good amount of carbonation, which lasts through the whole beer. Nice body and a great finish.  O- This is definitely one of, if not the best ""hoppy"" beers I have tasted. I do not think it is over-hyped at all. In fact, I can imagine that this would be my 6-pack per week beer if it were available in VA. Instead, I will order a bottle from CA whenever I have the chance. Spectacular Double IPA from Russian River! I can tell that other breweries have tried to do something similar, but I have yet to find one that is so perfectly balanced.

A thin white, dense head that sticks around with nice lacing.  S - Very noticeable grapefruit aroma with hints of pine.  T - Initial flavor is strongly grapefruit with a subtle piney flavor that lingers for a little while. A little hint of malt sweetness, but the hops definitely dominate the flavor profile.  M - Very crisp and clean with a little bit of carbonation prickle. No cloying sweetness as found in some of the East Coast 2xIPAs.  D - An overall great beer. Very drinkable. For a 2xIPA it hides the higher alcohol content well with a great balance with just enough sweetness to balance the hops bitterness. Excellent (or should I say the perfect) example of a West Coast 2xIPA.",Russian River Brewing Company,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,100
863,7971,jhadler,4.21,My brother brought a case of this back from his trip to out west. There was almost too much hype around this one before i had a chance to try it.

Bottled on 09/10/2012 which was 50 days ago, as of this review.  510 mL bottle poured into a Victory Golden Monkey Goblet.  Look: A magnificent golden-orange with a white, solid inch or two head that leaves a nice lace as it comes down. I'm loving the color.  Smell: Very hoppy, piney a little fruity - very pleasant - upon first smell a strong rush of hops is all I get which is wonderful. Best-smelling beer I've had - I could smell this all day. But on to the taste..  Taste - Pine. Some citrus. Just wonderful, not a hint of anything unpleasant. Really smooth. Leaves the taste of piney hops in the mouth afterward which is great.  Mouthfeel - Perfect amount of carbonation, pretty light for a beer of this strength.  Overall - This is a spectacular IPA and its reputation is well-deserved. So well balanced and drinkable. The flavor is an awesome combination of delicious hops, with a solid malt backbone. Everything about the beer screams excellence. Tasty.

S: Strong floral hops, some sweet malt, some pine a little alcohol and a bit of citrus.  T: Strong amount of citrusy and floral hop flavor that lingers on my palate for a very long time. As the beer lingers longer, I start to get a nice amount of sweetness from the malt.  M: This is by far the best feeling DIPA I have ever had. It gives a perfect amount of tingle all across the tongue and has a nice semi-full body.

863,7971,RossCain,4.54,"Poured from a 16oz bottle into a snifter. The bottle was just shy of three weeks old according to the bottling date.  A: The beer takes on a very clear golden color with a small, white head. The head was surprisingly thin and disappeared in a matter of a minute. It's alright, though; I wasn't looking into this beer for its looks.  S: The brew gave me exactly what I was looking for when I put my nose to the to glass: a swift, assertive punch to the face of west coast hops at their sweet, juicy peak. I couldn't wait to dive in.  T: The aroma of this beer does not fall short on any promises; it delivers with a a sweeping rush of gushy citrus sweetness right up front. If you're looking for an expertly showcased bouquet of flavors hops can impart on a beer, look no further. Grapefruit, tangerines, a bit of lemon zest mixed with some simple sugars a slight touch of earthiness.  M: Smooth, a bit slick, with a bit of an oily residue left on the palate upon each sip. Carbonation was just a touch fizzy, not in a distracting fashion. Bitter-sweet upon the tongue in the finish, but by no means overwhelming.  O: What more can be said that hasn't already?

A: Pours a super clean light copper / straw-like hue with a fat white head that sticks around for a few pulls leaving ridiculous amounts of lacing from start to finish.  S: Whiffs of fresh cut ganja, grapefruit rinds, dried hay, a hint of carmel malt, light alcohol and black peppercorn finish.  T: On point with the nose - classic Cali flavors in this one - big time floral ganja goodness, bitter white grapefruit, just enough sweetness from the light maltiness to round it out nicely, letting the hop run the show - as it should! Finishing extremely clean overall aided by the fresh water sources from the area.  M: Legit medium bodied ale with light carbonation that lends to the creaminess of this one nicely - bitter hop oils linger for days and coat the palate nicely with the perfect hop blend.

863,7971,gleemonger,5,"Mostly clear, yellowish orange with a nice white head. Nice lacing down the glass. A very pretty beer.  Piney, citrusy, grapefruit, a fruity hop explosion, followed by some light malts. Quite an amazing bouquet - very enticing.  Everything I got from the smell and then some. The flavors change throughout the sip, but never head in the wrong direction. Super refreshing and perfectly blended hop profile with just a light malt backbone. No alcohol really detected, despite the size. Just the right amount of bitterness to be interesting, but not wrecking my palate.  Moderate body with just the perfect amount of carbonation to cut through it and keep it refreshing. Smooth and a little creamy.  I get this one whenever I can, and thankfully, it is plentiful where I live. I've yet to find one better than this, and I've had quite a few great ones in the last year (some of my favorites being from homebrewers). True perfection, and worth all the hype, in my opinion.

A great looking beer  Aroma of strong hops, strong grapefruit, pine, tropical fruits, and citrus. Alcohol is well concealed, good example of how a double ipa should smell  Taste follows the smell quite well. Strong hops, pine, grapefruit, lemon, which a finish of malt and alcohol. Very bitter up front, ending with a sweetness from the malt. Everything blends well and nicely represented.  Feel is also consistent, with the all the flavors and feelings rolling from the tip of the tongue back to the very end. Carbonation leaves a nice biting tingle as you hold it in your mouth. Nice and dry finish, leaving your mouth sticky and wanting more.  So is it worth all the hype? It'd depend on the style you frequent most, with this being the godfather of the double ipas. Though I find my nine hour pilgrimage every couple months to be worth it, friends and family who aren't too into beer say it's simply ""alright,"" which honestly is probably the best you can hear from someone who hasn't developed a palate for dipas or craft beer in general.

Aroma was excellent. Strong floral and citrus aroma. Slight pine. Mildly sweet and a nice malty aroma. Hints of caramel. Great balance.  Taste was just as amazingly balanced. Big floral and citrus flavors up front. Good lingering piney, danky hop flavor that blends in to a balanced biscuity, malty backbone. Some mild sweetness still shows its a DIPA with notes of caramel. Bitterness still peaks through the malty profile and lingers lightly in to the finish. Mildly grassy and resiny in the finish. Finishes clean with no signs of ABV, just some lasting hop flavor and bitterness.  Mouthfeel was perfect. Medium body, medium carb and a dry finish.

It's appearance struck me as the way people tend to draw beer in cartoons- perfectly golden and with tons of head except it was real. It had a good strong hoppy smell to it that gets the saliva going and when you take the first sip that tasty bitterness comes through like lightning, accompanied by a little bit of a citrus note. Its surprisingly drinkable for how high in alcohol it is which is really not that perceptible. Towards the end I started getting a little bit of a soapy taste in my mouth though, but que sera sera.

What I remember from our 510 ml bottle:  A- A beautifully light and hazy orange. Poured over three separate snifters, first one about a finger and a half head, and the last hardly any. I drank out of the next-to-no-head snifter (I'm a sharing guy)  S- The aroma was dank. Pungent. Intriguing. Citrusy for sure, but nice pine aromas were beyond present, and a nice earthiness also.  T- The taste. The taste by itself was not what I was expecting. I expected something to stand out as far as individual flavors. But no. I had wanted this beer for ages, but there was no one flavor that made me love it. It was the balance that made it a necessity for more. Russian River brews their beer with very few specialty grains. Maybe this was the reason behind this. Citrusy hops dominated the flavor. A little pine, pretty much like the aroma minus the amount of earthiness.  M- The mouthfeel. Although it did not seem/look/hear very carbonated (and I said I had the least heady of the three), it left a nice, perplexing ""tingling"" feel on the tongue. Constantly enticing you to come back for more.  O- One of my favorite beers. I had many different ones on this evening. Including vintage. But this was one of two that stood out. Perplexing and satisfying all in one. The mouthfeel and balance is what stood out. While the aroma and taste were definitely strong, I expected that.",Russian River Brewing Company,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,100

Hugely floral with honey notes. No astringency or alcohol to speak of. Pure. That's the best word for it.  M: Imperceptibly brilliant.

Fully stipulating that my review is jaded because of the expectations I had when trying it.  Appearance was a light golden, very clean with lots of head on the pour. Pineapple, citrus, and piney hoppy notes on the nose. Could smell a bit of alcohol on the nose but knew this was going to be a hop bomb.  Thoughts after tasting:...that's it? Immediately reminded me of Ruination. A cleaner version of it mind you, but the heat from the alcohol, and very similar taste profile IMO. While this is a very well done DIPA I personally don't think it's anywhere near what it is hyped as. Must be something magical in combining west coast air and getting this on tap.

Floral and citrus flavor is short lived. Lingering bitterness is low and somewhat sneaks up.  Mouthfeel is light but pleasant, with some surprising alcohol heat.

The hops smell very sweet, with plenty of floral, bittery undertones.  T - not nearly as sweet as it smells, but delicious in all sorts of different ways. The orange goes from sweet in the smell to biting in the taste, like the peel rather than the meat. The alcohol plays a perfect role, somewhere right in the middle, not too prominent but not ephemeral enough to disappear completely.  M - also good. Perfect amount of carbonation helps this beer go down great. Readable beginning, middle, and end, just like any good IPA.  O - very good beer, I'll definitely get it again if I have the opportunity.

On top of the floral hops are hints of grapefruit and mango, so impeccably balanced one has to wonder what the secret is. I've heard that Heady Topper is superior so I put them head-to-head one night - pfffft, not even close, but to each his own.  It should be noted (and expected, I suppose) that the closer to the bottling date you have it, the better it is.

As the 2,768th person to review this beer, not sure how much I can add to the discussion, but I won't let that stop me.  Insanely drinkable. For some reason I was expecting this to be a behemoth, monstrosity of a brew with hop-tentacles coming out of the bottle when I opened it, but the bitterness is incredibly balanced and palatable. Lots of pineapple on the nose - that's a distinguishing characteristic that sets it apart from other IPAs I've had. Crisp, and refreshing for 8.0% IPA - mouthfeel is awesome, leaving almost no trace of resin-y after-effects. It's really a light, sessionable ale without sacrificing any of the backbone that a ballsy beer like this should have.

Might have held on to it a bit too long, but was saving it for the night when i could sit back and just enjoy all it has to offer.  My Duvel tulip is home to the king of beers tonite. Poured into the Duvel tulip, only used for the finest of ipa and dipa's, it has a nice billowing white head. I find the smell a bit disappointing, might be too cold from the fridge... Taste and mouthfeel are my favorite aspects of this beer.  How does it compare to Three Floyds' Dreadnaught and other top-notch DIPA's? It's every bit as good as Dreadnaught but is it better? Like I said earlier, I might have held onto it a bit too long to see what fresh Piny is like. But it is wonderful nonetheless.  The beer is a bit subdued to what I expected. Still a great beer from a great brewery. Cheers !!",Russian River Brewing Company,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,100
863,7971,gustogasmic,4.88,"The 2000th Review of Pliny in the bottle! Geek moment.  A- Golden-orangey, glowing. almost transparent. A vigorous pour leaves a 1/4"" head that disappears quickly, leaving thin and disparate white wisps. Lacing is perfectly even, and quite heavy. Really fast constant carbonation- tiny, tiny bubbles.  S/T/M-It's so singular, one lovely aroma. I want to say pine, or fresh pineapple, but it's just, the glorious hop. There's citrus, pine, and flowers, but I think the pine is certainly the most prominent of these essential hop qualities. The taste is a mirror image of the smell- the malts are incredibly clean, opening up the perfection of the flavor. Gave my dad (beer noob) a sip, and his words for it were ""sparkling"" and ""shining."" However abstract, I really like that, and agree completely. I can see how super-fresh Pliny would be even better, the beer is simply a hop showcase. It drinks so clean that I'm surprised it's a whole 8% ABV. Not sweet at all, and the alphas tingle and dry the tongue.  O- I will be seeking this beer fresher than fresh because this is simply the best IPA I have ever experienced. This is everything I want from an IPA: gushing aroma and flavor, lightish body, dry leave. I expected a bolder IPA from the hype, something you couldn't help but be blown back by. But no, this is perfection in its subtleties, in its sublime BALANCE, that ever-important elusive quality... I am being honest in marking down aroma and taste to 4.5, but this bottle is over a month old and I have this deep-seated feeling that it IS a 5, when just a bit fresher.... indeed the brewer's labeling suggests this. Wow. Santa Rosa, here I come.",Russian River Brewing Company,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,100
863,7971,CHickman,4.94,"Pours clear gold with nice 1 finger foamy snow white head that fades slowly, leaving a foamy layer on top and very good foamy lacing along the sides. Must admit I surprised at how basic this beer looks in a glass, but I can smell the hops from 6 inches away, so that made up for it.  Smells outstanding, like a handful of fresh picked hops; the pine and citrus notes up front are soft, sweet and juicy, like fresh citrus fruit mixed with lightly toasted grains. Aroma is sweet and hoppy overall, with fresh piney hops, grapefruit, orange, pineapple, lemon zest, citrus hops, toasted grains, tea leaf, grass, light caramel, floral hops, biscuit and light spices like pepper and coriander; the hops dominate, but don’t overpower the senses with just enough malt to make this near perfection. This is soft and inviting, yet completely hides the ABV and just begs you to take another whiff.  Tastes magnificent: it is juicy, sweet and hoppy with fresh grapefruit, orange, lemon, pineapple, tangerine, citrus hops, piney hops, lightly toasted grains, caramel, floral hops, herbs, sweet malt, biscuit and spices like pepper, mint and coriander. Juicy citrus and tropical fruit flavors come in waves that swirl in a complex tornado, yet let the grains and malt add balance and flavor so it flows down easy with only hints of the alcohol peeking through. The ABV is masterfully contained and the piney and citrus hops smack you with bitterness and then hug you with warm, wonderful complex flavors.  Mouthfeel is creamy and crisp at the same time, with a medium chewy body, average carbonation and a bitter finish that tasted like a glass of fresh squeezed tangerines. The citrus and grainy flavor that lingers are oily, but still on the dry side. It was like a coating of the delicious piney flavor purposely sticks around to remind you of how good each sip was and how good this beer is.  A hop lovers dream, this lived up to the hype for the most part, but I think I need to try it out at the brewery to maximize the experience. I agree this is one of the best beers on the planet, as something so strong and flavorful should not be this easy to drink, yet this beer was so smooth that I had to hold myself back and force myself to sip it at times – it was that damn good. Incredibly easy to drink and extremely tasty, I am very happy that I was able to finally indulge in this world glass beer. A very high recommendation that I will seek out again and even travel to Northern California to have again – it’s that good.",Russian River Brewing Company,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,100
863,7971,FlyingBull,3.73,"Had this tonight at Hamiltons in SD on tap. Have had it in a bottle and some home brew clones. On tap, it was very good. I was surprised since I wasn't too impressed with it in bottle. Nice mouthfeel, light amber color, very smooth, and explodes with hop flavor. Not as bitter on tap as I perceive in bottle.  I will say, there are sooo many West Coast IPAs out there that are as good or very similar, that to me, it's not that ""special"". It's become one of many... I like it very much; but there are so many similar others that I also like.",Russian River Brewing Company,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,100
863,7971,spoony,4.52,"510 ml bottle (dated 8-14-12, consumed 9-5-12) poured into a tulip.  A-Pours a strikingly clear copper-ish gold color. Crystalline looking body. There is about a half finger of light khaki head that dissipates pretty quickly into a thick collar. The collar hangs around for a while, leaving nice lacing on the glass.  S-Fresh pine and sage, but not as vegetal as some. I pick up a little black pepper and citrus. Fresh pineapple, too. Really nice mix of fruit, hops, and spice.  T-Nicely balanced hop-dominant flavor. There is a slightly bitter pine taste, but it is not mouth puckering because there is a hint of malty sweet fruit that comes in on the mid-palate. A little citrus and hint of spicy alcohol, but this is not lemon bomb.  M-Awesome. There is a resin stickiness and a really smooth flavor, but with enough pricks from the minimal carbonation to keep it from being too slimy.  O-This beer lived up to the hype for me. It was just so well balanced from start to finish, but at the same time, it had intense flavors.",Russian River Brewing Company,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,100

Smell – It smells like I am walking through a pine forest in the UP just after a rainfall. There is just a hint of malt in there somewhere.  Taste - A good balance of hops and malt. The pine resin of the hops is strong but not overpowering the sweetness of the malt.  Mouthfeel – The balance of the malts and hops play well on the together with just the right amount of carbonation to keep the head until the experience is complete.  Overall – There was no way that this beer was going to live up to the hype of the ratings and the beer snobs. It was a great beer but nothing that I would go to great lengths to search out. Though, if I could find it at my local beer store, it would be on the “To Buy List”.",Russian River Brewing Company,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,100
863,7971,boilermakerbrew,5,"Benn waiting to get my hands on this a while now, big thanks to APreacher for the trade!  Bottled on 8-14-12, so pretty fresh. Good since the bottle threatens you about drinking it fresh.  A- Pours a slightly hazy, brilliant gold hue. A little orangish, but pretty much as golden as an Olympic medal. Great 1.5 finger head that retains tremendously and laces nearly as well. Just a beautiful pour.  S- Great blend of bitter hops notes here. Not overpowering by any means. Mixture of pine and floral notes are most prominent. Balanced so well that I can't really detect any sweeter notes by themselves, just blended with the hops.  T- The moment of truth....wow....hype train doesn't lie. Great bitter hops flavors up front, but just like the scent, nothing too overpowering. The balance between malt and hops is brilliant. Washes over the palate and the full bitterness perks up a little towards the end, but damn this is delicious. Ends very cleanly with slight bitter hop aftertaste, with the slightest hint of sweetness lingering on the lips.  M- Maybe the best part of this beer. First off, the carbonation and weight hold the flavors perfectly. Despite having a fair amount of carbonation, this one feels slick and creamy. Not too heavy, not too light, and no alcohol to be felt. I wish I got a case of this.  Overall, PtE lives up to every bit of hype I've heard. So smooth, so balanced, so delicious. I love this beer. Needless to say I will be trading for more. This is the most sessionable beer I have had.",Russian River Brewing Company,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,100
863,7971,tronester,4.68,"Bottled on Date: 07/25/2012  This beer is just over a month old, so hopefully it is still fresh ;-) Pours a clear golden orange, with a hint of red highlights if held in the right light. The aroma is primarily lightly caramelized sugar and some grapefruit rind. There is also a hint of mint. The taste begins with a huge candied apricot flavor. Next is a dry table water cracker malt middle. The finale is an herbal, super citrusy toungue wrench... In a good way of course. Every few sips you get a burst of super sweet pineapple in the beginning. Mouthfeel is rich, despite how dry a DIPA this is. Overall an exceptional DIPA. I will say that Pliny the Elder is not my personal favorite DIPA, however, its not surprising to see it ranked so highly. You really can't go wrong here.",Russian River Brewing Company,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,100

Three fingers of creamy, eggshell-white head retains very well. Lacing Is spotty. easily one of the best looking IPAs out there.  S: Fresh hop bouquet of mango, melon, pineapple, white grapefruit, and a slew of other tropical fruits. Somewhat dank. Oily, leafy, herbal edge. Aromatic pine needles. Just the slightest whiff of a shortbread/biscuit malt base.  T: Pine up front. Spicy, herbal, and leafy as well. Gripping, oily bitterness. Hemp seed. Bitter grapefruit. Bursts of mandarin orange, mango, and other tropical fruits. Very well-hidden alcohol presence carries tropical esters of pineapple and star fruit with it. Peppery. The malt base is barely a factor, with just a slight taste of toasted biscuit coming through. The finish is all hops, and the gripping spicy, herbal hop oils don't want to let go.  M: Medium bodied. Creamy and full-ish. A restrained stroke of prickling carbonation supports nicely. Very smooth. Great.  O: When talking about West Coast IPAs and DIPAs, this is the standard to which all are measured. Rightfully so. It's pretty much perfect from stem to stern.

863,7971,MeowTom,4.12,"A- Pours a clear gold with a huge foamy head. The head sticks around for a while and never really goes away.  S- It's a huge piney hop smell. I could smell it when it a couple of feet away away. It's like I'm walking though a pine forest.  T- A huge hoppy bitter taste I was however expecting more from the way it smelled. I think it is a wonderful bloom as it sits on the tongue.  M- Thick body with a wonderful smoothness mixed with the carbonation.  O- Some really great things are happening with this beer and it is one of the top IPAs I have had, but the rumors of the greatness have disappointed.

M: I feel this is the only part of the beer that is lacking. I felt the beer could use a little more body, but I am just being picky at this point. O: Just a fantastic beer.

863,7971,BuckyFresh,4.7,"Reviewed from notes. A big thanks to TCHopCraver for hooking me up with one of these!  Appearance: Poured into a large wine glass. Golden/amber color with a decent head and sticky lacing. A slight haze barely clouds the glass. Not a ton of carbonation visible.  Smell: Loads of pineapple, grapefruit, orange, and a nice bready malt backdrop. Elements of pine and a touch of alcohol linger in depths of the aroma.  Taste: This beer has to be one of the best at packing loads of complex and nuanced hop flavor into a very balanced and drinkable concoction. I feel like I'm getting the hop punch I desire without suffering the typically obligatory taste bud fatigue associated with most hop forward IPAs. Nice citrus pine aftertaste that is slowly warmed away be the alcohol on the back end.  Mouthfeel: Medium-bodied and a fairly dry finish. A touch of alcohol rounds things out. Well balanced and very drinkable.  Overall: It's hard to live up to the hype with a beer like this, but the Elder comes pretty darn close. One of the best DIPAs out there.",Russian River Brewing Company,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,100
863,7971,ThePaleRider,4.51,"A - a little light in color. Just a little darker than most pale ales. One finger wide, white head, that leaves no lacing on the glass.  S - Pine, citrus, and smooth malts. One of the best smelling beers out there.  T - So smooth. Hops and malts blend perfectly and leaves you with a nice bitter finish. Super easy to drink for the style.  M - light with a little less than average carbonation. Doesn't stick around long after you drink it.  O - Definitely one of the best tasting DIPA's out there. I really enjoy the drinkability of this beer. A little pricy for the 16 oz bottle, but I guess when you have a beer with a following like this one you can charge a little more.",Russian River Brewing Company,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,100
863,7971,ESPNman,4.65,"Served at Pete's Brass Rail & Carwash in Danville  A - Pours a transparent straw-gold with a hint of orange. Two fingers of thick, foamy head with solid lacing and retention.  S - One word that I'll use several times in this review is ""balance"". This is one extraordinarily balanced beer, and it starts with the nose. Sweet malts provide the backbone for what is certainly a very hoppy beer. Citrus, floral, and piney hops are present, but not overpowering. A bit of mango accompanies the sweet malt structure.  T - Balanced and essentially perfect for the style. Yes, this is a bitter and hoppy brew, but it's shockingly drinkable and balanced for an 8% ABV DIPA. Much like the nose, it has the solid bitter notes of floral and citrus hops, but it also has bready, sweet malt notes that balance the beer out perfectly. It finishes with a perfectly dry, bitter, hoppy aftertaste. I've had many DIPAs in my day, and even in blind tastings, Pliny consistently comes out as my favorite.  M - Although it's great for the style, it's not my favorite. I prefer the thickness of a Ruination 10th Anniversary or a Sierra Nevada Hoptimum. Yes, it is well carbonated and not too thick on the tongue... but it's just not my favorite. It leaves a dry finish, and isn't too thin for the style. It's just not as heavy on the tongue as I would prefer.  O - Overall, this is my favorite beers. It's the epitome of balance. No one characteristic of the beer stands out as being the ""most"" of anything. It's not the hoppiest, it's not the booziest, it's not as thick or intense as other DIPAs (such as Hopslam, Double Jack, or Dreadnaught), but it is balanced and it is delicious. It is the DIPA by which all other DIPAs, or even beers for that matter, are measured... and it is well-deserved.",Russian River Brewing Company,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,100
863,7971,EnemyWithin,4.22,"Bottle on June 5 2012 into Duvel tulip. Approx 12 days old from bottling.  Appearance - 4 Golden yellow with a half inch white head.  Aroma - 4.5 Initially it bursts with volumes of thick juicy citrus, grapefruit, mango, tangerine, & hops. Faint sweetness of malt in the nose. These flavors tend to subside a few minutes after opening the beer, but make a gradual return as the beer becomes warmer.  Taste - 4 Initially a sharp, piney bitterness with a touch of resin, lemon and faint subtle tropical flavors. Get a very mild contrasting sweetness of the malt with notes of biscuit and very faint notes of caramel; more on the centre of the palate. Midway through get intensification of sharp acidic dry bitterness. Finishes with a moderate lingering piney bitterness and the more tropical juicy flavors of the hops make a return on the palate, although muted in comparison to the aroma. As the beer warms, there is slightly more sweetness in the malt and fruitiness from the hops.  Mouthfeel - 4 Mild to moderate body with moderate carbonation. Overall finish is dry, although faint notes of sweetness from the malt. Hops does leave a sharp finish to the beer, which is quite refreshing.  Overall - 4.5 How can you truly evaluate a beer that has so much hype, as well as personal meaning, as pliny the elder. It is very difficult to be unbiased in evaluation. At minumum, it is an above average IPA, very typical, if not defining, of the west coast style. Is it the best beer out there, or best IPA? I'm not sure. I think I would have to re-evaluate some of the other IPA's I've had in the past. The nose of this beer is quite good, although I may have found other beers better in this category before. As for the taste, it is quite brash in its hops presesnce, yet still has some balance with the malt offering a refined feel.  Overall, very enjoyable and incredibly easy to drink. If I was in a location where this was a regular offering, I could see it being a regular pick regardless of its hype factor. But back to whether it's the best beer out there - I can't say at this time. Still, it is a beer any craft beer afficianado must try.

Some straw and grass but mostly orange zest dominates the scent. The flavor has an incredible hop bite and bitterness. Straw and orange peel, with a pronounced bittering midpoint and a dry zesty finish. I enjoyed this until the last drop.  This was my one year anniversary review!

Poured a lovely golden with a thick, creamy 2"" of light tawny foam that persisted for ages and left thick rings of lacing from the top to bottom of the glass. Very inviting.  Smells immediately of pine resins, hop, lightly tropical and then light sweetness. Not imposing, but just right, fresh, crisp.  Taste is essentially a story of layers of various pine resin hop character. Unique in it's flavors as it's not a palate dessicating hop bomb (this is a DIPA?) so I wouldn't be able to tell it's 8% ABV. The mouthfeel and body are creamy, smooth and nicely carbonated. Nuances of lightly sweet bready malt, honey, pineapple, starfruit and flowery elements are presented in perfect balance with a refreshing slightly bitter finish which one could continue to sip, drink or quaff all day and night.  If you're looking for a hop bomb look elsewhere. If you're looking for a carefully crafted DIPA with complexity, drinkability, balance, outstanding mouthfeel..and appearance, this is the package.  Update 2013/Dec -  Chris acquired five bottles of fresh Pliny t E on his way through Colorado so we really plowed into it..  It's still phenomenal. Definitely not a bitter hop bomb, but much nuance of papaya, pineapple, grapefruit, pine, passion fruit and all sorts of tropical elements combined with a lightly sweet malt backbone to reign in the hoppy attack. Such a smooth and creamy mouthfeel too. It's certainly right at the top of the heap of excellent tropical citrus tasty type of DIPA, IPA and PAs such as Zombie, Pseudo Sue, Arctic Panzer, Abrasive, etc., etc. No question.

Big tropical and pine hop aroma, maybe a little papaya and pineapple.  Subtle malt sweetness melds flawlessly with the more tropical fruit elements of the hop flavor. The sweet fruity flavor up front transitions to a slightly bitter fruity flavor in the finish. Hop bitterness is smooth and somewhat subtle.  Medium body and carbonation, no astringency, and just a little bit of alcohol warming.

Pretty good lacing, not a ton but certainly a pretty beer to swirl and examine. It was very inviting.  S: The first thing I noticed was pine and then hops with a bit of sweetness at the end. It wasnt an overpowering aroma that knocked me off my feet but it smelled very fresh and crisp.  T: I couldnt tell that it was a DIPA because it wasnt a massive hop bomb, but that was fine with me. It was a perfectly balanced beer that I felt I could just sit and smell/drink for ages. The main notes were hops, pine, bready malt in the backbone, and a really great yellow honey note that I couldnt get enough of. The flavors were all spot on and I don't think I have a bad thing to say about it. However, it isnt some god like nectar that people make it out to be. Its damn god, but I wouldn't call it the best.  MF: Wasnt too oily or thick which I liked, but it certainly had a good body to it. Again, very well balanced.  Overall: This is a fantastic beer. I recommend anyone try it if they can get their hands on it. However, it is certainly not the gods gift to men and it doesnt really live up to the massive hype surrounding it (but who cares, its delicious!).

Great spice, low carbonation and perfect creamy mouthfeel contributes to an ideal balance. Dangerously drinkable but not to worry as the taste is long lasting. 8% ABV is lost in the robust and classic biscuit and caramel flavors. Gets smoother and creamier as it warms. Ruins the tastebuds for a lesser IPA. It's 3k mile journey to my table led to lofty expectations. In the end, Pliny delivered.",Russian River Brewing Company,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,100
863,7971,spark3148857,4.59,"On tap in Denver:  AP: Pours a clear light orange with straw edges. Slight white head.  AR: Wonderful balance of citrus, floral, and pine.  TS: Balance is the name of the game. Not overwhelming in any direction. Certainly more balanced than I expected. Some bready maltiness is present. A great combination of hop bitterness lingers on the palate.  MF: Above average.  OV: Well this set the standard for DIPAs so what can I say? Was I a little underwhelmed? Yes, but there is so much hype behind Pliny. It is a fantastic DIPA that I would always return to but I tend to favor the DIPAs such as Myrcenary or Hopslam.",Russian River Brewing Company,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,100
863,7971,TBoneJones,5,"It is what it is. Much hyped, and much anticipated to drink when I received this bottle with care from the northwest coast. After taking the bottle out of my beer refrigerator, I allowed it to get to a bit above 50 degrees (I wasn't going to pair this with anything but tasty cheese, bleu and aged cheddar in this case). My wife happened to have made a nice salad of corn, cilantro, tomato, black and garbanzo beans etc. Anyway, the pour, a beautiful golden haziness. Vivid white fluffy head. The smell, as great as any other regarded IPA I've enjoyed (citrus/piney splendor). Artful lacing in the Chimay chalice used here. When I tasted this I immediately realized this is a benchmark brew. The balance is impeccable for a hoppy ale. Bitter sure. And the malt is there, but everything else is too and it is well, well done. Like I said a benchmark. Drinkability off the charts. If i have to pick one bottled beer that epitomizes quaffability, thus far this is it. I can only hope to vacation in northern CA soon in order to sample the Younger!! The only disappointment I had, and it's nothing that can impact the perfect scoring, is that I only have one of these! But then again that's all I need to realize PTE deserves the cult-like status it possesses. As a double IPA, everything is right-on.",Russian River Brewing Company,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,100
863,7971,jivex5k,5,"Had my first Pliny ever. Got it through a trade on this forum and man am I glad I did. I got 6 of em so I could share with my friends. We cracked one last night and man I gotta say it lives up to the hype.  The appearance was great, this beautiful golden yellow with a nice head about a fingers width or so. I mean this brew was bright...shining like a beacon of light seductively beckoning you to come close.  And I did just that to take a whiff of this golden beauty. Man...smelled fresh, sweet, a deliciously fruity hop smell. The smell made promises of great things, and boy did it deliver.  Upon touching this sacred liquid to my tongue I awoke suddenly as if the rest of my life had been a dream. It's a testament to Russian Rivers brewing ability. An outrageously hopped IPA that is somehow completely balanced. It's sweet and bitter, hoppy and malty, black and white, yin and yang.  It doesn't finish overly bitter, it finishes with a slight bitterness lingering that tastes just as good as the beer you've just swallowed.  I'm glad I went to the trouble to try this beer. If your a beer lover and haven't had a Pliny get one! It's definitely worth trading and there are plenty of reputable BA members that would be willing to trade. It's easy for some to get, for me it was well worth the trouble.  They were bottled on 6/7/12",Russian River Brewing Company,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,100

Smell: Burst of grapefruit and pine. Caramel sweetness plays in the background.  Taste: Pine that quickly changes into a caramel maltiness. Bitter grapefruit and pine. Caramel and peppery bitterness linger on the palate.  Mouthfeel: Very juicy and drinkable, without an overwhelming bitterness. The balance in this is textbook perfect.

Sweet malt backbone supports the hop onslaught. There is a nice hop spice as well, paired nicely with the dank, norcal hop aroma.  Bright, citrusy and juicy hops awaken your palate as the refreshing bitterness and fruity aromatics satisfy in a big way. Definitely some fruity complexities such as mango and papaya. The hops present themselves in a tropical , bitter and playful way. Cascade, Chinook and Citra hops I believe are present. The malt base supports the hops well. Amazing balance.  Oily, juicy, sweet, wheaty, dry. Amazing.  I believe Pliny the Elder deserves the respect it gets.

863,7971,carolinabeerguy,4.85,"Poured from a 16.9 ounce bottle into a Duvel tulip. Bottled on June 14, 2012 printed on label.  Appearance: Pours a clear medium gold with a 2-3 finger fluffy eggshell white head. Nice head retention and lacing.  Smell: Amazing bouquet of hops featuring sweet citrus, grapefruit and pineapple with sweet malt and just a touch of pine and alcohol.  Taste: Ruby red grapefruit, pineapple and tangerine up front followed by caramel malt in the middle before ending with a blast of pine, lemon zest and just a touch of alcohol at the finish. Extremely well-balanced flavor. Aftertaste is bitter and long-lasting. Maybe my favorite aftertaste to date.  Mouthfeel: Medium-bodied with the perfect amount of carbonation - not too heavy as to be overpowering, but not weak enough to be considered flat in any way. Very smooth and the hop oils really coat the mouth. This beer feels perfect.  Drinkability: Excellent drinkability. This one goes down very easily for a beer with 8% ABV.  Overall: Amazing beer overall. This beer is incredibly hyped and deservedly so. The only other DIPA that I would compare to it is Bell's Hopslam from 2011 (2012 was far too boozy for me and not very balanced, in my opinion). If you see it, try it. If you don't see it, trade for it. Whatever you do, try some fresh Pliny the Elder.

Solid lacing. Looks very unassuming.  S - so bright and hop forward. I get a really nice citrus smell. It has almost a hemp smell to it. Other than the taste the smell is the best part. When I put my nose in the glass I just can't wait to drink it.  T - extremely well balanced. Hop forward clean crisp bit to it. With a floral aftertaste. Clean finish without a bitter aftertaste. It's just so tasty. I could freeze it and make Popsicles with it. It's a great DIPA because the hops are center without being bitter and without overloading it with malt to balance it out.  M - lightly carbonated and slightly thin body. Not as thick as I thought it would be.  O - great IPA, DIPA and beer. It's one of the best IPAs around If not the best.",Russian River Brewing Company,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,100

863,7971,DelMontiac,4.68,"Lucked out when a friend of a friend brought 12 bottles of PTE back from Colorado. I tried not to let the hype take over when I poured it into a heavy pint glass.  This beer is beautiful - clear golden honey with a lingering tight white two-finger head. The lace is a fine curtain marking each sip, just the way I like it.  Very piney and grapefruit rind-like aroma. I can pick up minimally lemon grass and pale malt.  Flavorful and well balanced - grapefruit, lemon, sticky bun, and bitters towards the end. Not blown away, but very good, indeed.  Medium sticky and smooth feel. More creamy than most DIPAs I've had. Perfect.  Overall, an excellent DIPA. An idol worthy of hophead worship.",Russian River Brewing Company,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,100
863,7971,tut2528,4.24,"A: Huge 2 fingers worth of head retention, a nice sharp golden color with high transparency. Retention is great with huge lacing. Thin film remains  S: enormous piney hoops with a secondary grassy hop note. This is well complemented by grapefruit, pineapple and mango character along with orange peel notes, alcohol is completely hidden. This is one of the more amazing smelling IPA beers  T: Well deserving of the hype and a huge hop lovers dream. Huge piney hops well complemented by a grapefruit character with a slight touch of honey (not quite as much honey as the Hopslam though). I also get touches of pineapple and mango. Alcohol starts to come out just a touch but its enjoyable.  M: Very light on the tongue and a bitterness sits at the back of the molars.  O: An awesome brew well deserving of the hype. I personally find Hopslam a touch more appealing due to the honey character. wish i could get this at store level in the Midwest...asking price (via trade) is too high for me. 90 minute or Alpha King will be a fine substitute for now.",Russian River Brewing Company,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,100

A- Pours a mildly hazy perfect golden color with 3 fingers of thick, almost creamy white head that is sticking around a while, and leaving amazing lacing on the glass.  S- Getting lots of grapefruit, floral hoppy notes, plenty of fresh pine, and tropical fruits. Smells great.  T- Extremely balanced for a DIPA. Not near as bitter as some of the other options out there. It follows nose well with the bitterness of grapefruit, but the fresh sweet tropical fruit tastes of mango, and passion fruit. Crisp and refreshing.  M- Not as thick as some other DIPA's, which gives it it's very easy drinkablity. It's hard not to just gulp it down, being so perfectly balanced, and refreshing. Perfect amount of carbonation.  O- Lives up to the hype. At first glance it would seem like this is hard to get, but I'm sure at around 5 bucks a bottle at the brewery there are some BA's out there willing to spread the wealth and let others enjoy it.

Lots of notable carbonation and bubbles sticking to the glass.  S- Like any good DIPA, Pliny has a great aroma. Of course it has that hoppy, piney smell to it that I was expecting, but it has lots of grapefruit aromas in there, some citrus like lemon or orange, pineapple, even a hint of mango.  T- Still bitter and hoppy the way you want it, but all of those smells in the aroma work well with the taste. More and more grapefruit and citrus with a bitter orange aftertaste.  M- Lots of bubbles on the tongue, helped this beer go down smooth.  O- This is my third favorite IPA, behind Citra and of course Heady Topper.

Mango, pineapple, spruce, rich pine, for having such a boring label this thing can really tango.  Big and bitter but subtle and smooth. Tremendous hop balance.

863,7971,hoody711,4.37,"Got 4 of these in a trade. Very excited. Held off on the review because, to be honest, was completely underwhelmed. Let it age a little bit, even though the bottle says not to about 100 times.  A - poured vigorously into my same old Sam Adams ""I'm smarter than you, just look at the beer glass I have"" glass. Pours a golden straw, paler than I remember. I know this isn't smell, but I smelled this bad boy as soon as I popped the top. Don't remember that happening last time. Fluffy pearl head, about 2 fingers that settles to 1 and leaves copious lace. Good carbonation. Great clarity.  S - make or break time, personally. Smell is incredibly important to me, and this doesn't disappoint. I get citrus (grapefruit, passion fruit, lemon zest) and maybe a little bread/earth, but the citrus dominates and holy shit on a stick is it good. Rivals my #1 ZD easily.  T - I remember spicy and peppery last time, and it shows up again, but not as strong as I remember. The citrus has left a little bit, and that may be a result of my silly aging. I get maltiness up front, followed by the hop punch (slap? It's not that strong) and a little alcohol burn on the way out.  M - medium to heavy, coats the palate and stays there for sure.  O - Blah, I hate myself for not giving all 5s. I guess I'm just not as sophisticated as you guys. This beer delivers everything up front with appearance and smell, then drops off a little with the taste. I wish that smell translated a little better into the taste, but what can you do?

Great, golden appearance with just the right carbonation. Wonderful, grapefruit nose with all the things you love about hoppy beers and none of the stuff that scares you away.

There is the slightest of haze in this beer. Nose is citrus, predominately grapefruit, pineapple, and some pine. A touch of alcohol is present, as well. Great balance of citrus hops and malt backbone on the palate. The hops present themselves up front then give way to bready malts. A welcome bitterness returns in the finish. Mouthfeel is silky smooth, punchy, and crisp all at once.  Worth all of the hype and wish I had access to more in South Florida.

A: Light golden color with a thin head that dissipated fairly quickly leaving slight lacing on the glass.  S: Very strong citrus notes (especially grapefruit) with the hoppy aroma much lighter than I expected.

O - The hype is pretty damn high on PtE, thats for sure. But damned if it does not meet or exceed all my expectations. There are alot of great IPA/IIPA out there, but Pliny is the leader.

Head is off white, 1 in. of tightly grouped bubbles, dissipates to line the top of the beer. Medium carbonation. Heavy lacing.  S: Huge resinous and citrus notes eminate with a solid malt underbody. Very citrusy and pleasant aroma.  T: Follows nose very closely. Huge hop notes hit all parts of the palate with a very bright citrus and resinous qualitiy. Robust malt base kicks in giving a bit of balance to this beer, but hops dominate. Hop bitterness is substantial, but expressed in a way that is very palateable. Light sweetness along with the malts. Aftertaste is very hoppy and lingers on the palate for a noticable amount of time, bready and sweet malt flavors noticable as well.  M: Medium/heavy body. Medium viscosity. The sheer magnitude of hops in this beer create a very resinous feel, but the malt base adds quite a lot of body as well. Wet finish.  O: This beer is great. Based upon the reviews I had read and stories I had heard, I was a little under-whelmed. Actually, compared to some of the other DIPAs/IIPAs I've had, there are some I perfer over PtE. That said, again, this beer was fantastic. Great hoppiness and I loved the resinous quality to this beer. I would never turn this beer down and will seek it out again.",Russian River Brewing Company,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,100

The nose is very nice hoppy, with some very nice citrus, and pine note. The taste is very very nice, hoppy, maybe a slight malt note, very nice citrus, and some nice pineyness. Medium body, with a nice little chewyness, and a very nice dry/bitter finish. ABV is hidden very well. Overall, a treasure to drink, glad to see some bottles lying around at the store. Highly Recommended!  Thanks goes out to dsgolovin for this extra from a recent trade.  I had this back in 07 in a bottle from a growler.

The presentation was very nice. The beer was poured into a pint glass by the bartender.  Right away, you can tell this beer has character. The color and smell combine to intrigue.  The taste is pretty strong at first. Hops to the face. Clean finish.  I'd drink again.",Russian River Brewing Company,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,100
863,7971,haddon,4.65,"The color of this beer is a beautiful golden translucent hue... if you've ever dabbled in homebrewing, then you know how difficult pure gold color is to achieve. an aggressive pour gave a thick 3-finger head and lacing all the way down the tulip.  On the nose, amazing. All good IPA's have citrus notes but this is like walking through the produce aisle at Fresh Market... pineapple, orange, grapefruit with an oh so subtle malt note. close to perfect!  lots of world class IPA's find that great flavor profile balance between citrus & pine... but this is the standard by which all others are measured. Citrus notes come across as pineapple & orange peel. There is definitely a piney, pepper bite that many in this class are missing. I love the balance it brings.  Body is medium with a thick, velvety texture. just right amount of carbonation.  Well, I've been reading about the PtE hype for years... this. does. not. disappoint. this is probably the best IPA I've had that mixes the perfect hop blend of citrus & piney bite.  Well done, Russian River. You almost make me want to move to CA (not really... folks out there are a bit odd).",Russian River Brewing Company,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,100
863,7971,Cyberkedi,4.52,"Strong, hoppy aroma has a strong overtone of grapefruit. Very grapefruit-y. It pours a clear amber with a respectable white head that leaves some good lacing.

No wonder this is so recherche.",Russian River Brewing Company,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,100
863,7971,denver10,4.35,"Had it on tap, now getting to have it via the bottle.  Pours a bright golden with a creamy white head and continual bubbles rising to the surface. A sweet, fruity aroma of some grapefruit and its sugars, its rinds, and a nice malt underbelly that gains in influence as the beer warms. Taste follows suit; grapefruit and its sugars, some rind, and a gentle malt underbelly in addition to some floral qualities that show itself throughout. A creamy, silky mouthfeel with some nice activity. Overall, a very nice beer. Perhaps it was simply a case of the tap being fresher but I do think the tap experience was noticeably more enjoyable. No knock on this bottle though which is still really good, and probably would have been better if I didn't have that initial experience to compare it to.",Russian River Brewing Company,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,100

Splotchy lacing surrounds the edges of its straw like peachy hue.  Tropical pine heaven on the nose. Just one sniff showcases the balance between hop and malt. Pine, pineapple, and nectarine meet a rounded complimentary caramel malt backing.  As in the aroma, I am very satisfied with the balance. More pronounced in the taste is the piney resin. Pineapple and tangerine play within the taste with a supremely mellow malt backbone tying it all together.  A mellow medium-full feel in the mouth with drying in the end...very nice.  Nothing in this beer is new, nothing blows me away, but it is strong in all areas without flaws. I could drink this all night and be happy.

863,7971,Blargimus,4.42,"500 ml bottle poured into pint glass. Bottled on 4/3/2012.  Lighter than more DIPAs I've had. Crystal-clear and straw colored. A few fingers of pretty white head that settles and sticks around. Pretty beer, but not mind-boggling.  This is probably the most fragrant IPA I've ever smelled. Heavy pine with floral accents. Maybe a bit of sweetness, but this is hop heaven.  Taste is certainly hop-forward, but it's remarkably well-balanced. Really superb. I do think I detect just a hint of alcohol, but not as much as 8% would have you expect. The aftertaste is clean and crisp, and bitterness doesn't stick around too much. This is a selling point for me.  Carbonated really well, it's almost creamy. Really the one criticism I can think of is the lack of any resinous mouthfeel, but that's more of a personal preference.  Yeah, this beer deserves most, if not all of the hype.",Russian River Brewing Company,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,100
863,7971,bobbypaulson,4.47,"As a person who lives in Minnesota Pliny the Elder is not available as easy and as often as I wish it could be. I was lucky enough to have some fresh bottles sent to me (as fresh as they can be) however I was even more lucky in early January to get a growler set to me the same day it was picked up from the brewery and delivered to me super quickly!!! I can still remember the huge pop of the 2L swing top growler. So from the grower into a tall pilsner glass the color was light orangy brown in color with a thin white head that disappears quickly. The smell is very big and hoppy and sweet. The taste is super balanced with the amount of hop and sweet. All this high ranked IPA are all so hard to rate because they all are so amazing, it's hard to decide which one is better.",Russian River Brewing Company,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,100

A: Clear light yellow/orange with a one finger off white head that gave way to big bubbles. Decent lacing.  S: Major piney. Floral. Like walking in a forest of evergreens. May the hops be with you.  T: A hop/malt combo. Crisp, not bitter. Grapefruit, oranges. A clean finish. Oh, so smooth.  M: Light to medium. Light carbonation.

One inch head that dissipates after a few minutes with a moderate pour.  S - Pine and mango with hints of pineapple.  T - first taste is lightly sweet that then reveals its hop-awesomeness. Bitter, but not over the top. Just enough malt backbone to let you know it's there. Also finishes sweet with a hint of caramel and bitterness.  M - a little thin for the style. Doesn't coat my tongue or mouth as much as I hoped or remember.  O - A very good DIPA. A lot of competition in this style nowadays. Alpine and Kern River are worth competitors that are sort of local to SoCal but are arguably harder to find.

T - Similar to the smell but with lots of hops, grapefruit, pineapple, orange, lemon, pine, as well as some floral and other earthy flavors. Considering all this, it isn’t too bitter. There is slight bitter presence, but there are so many other flavors it isn't overpowering. The fruit flavors provide a very subtle sweetness along with some pale malt as well. M - Medium to full body with a nice balance of carbonation; very creamy and smooth. O - Absolutely delicious, the best IPA I've had!

863,7971,thebornotaku,4.38,"A note: This beer was bottled 5/14 and I am doing this review just past midnight making it officially 5/19. The bottle says to enjoy it fresh, so I figured I will listen to it...  Appearance:  Starting with the bottle, you would never assume much about this beer. While a lot of other brews sport complex, flashy labels, Pliny stands out in it's own right. It has a dark green label with a big red circle and the words ""Pliny the Elder"" written inside it. Minimalistic. Perhaps Russian River wants the beer to speak for itself? Given the reviews, I would certainly say this is the case.  The bottle also makes it very clear that this beer should be enjoyed cold and as soon as possible. So I'l oblige it.  Second part of the appearance is the pour. Pours an amber-goldish color with minimal head that dissipates quickly.  Smell? Hops. Obviously. This is a double IPA, and seeing as how it's named Pliny The Elder, you should fully expect hops. If you're looking for anything else, turn away. The smell is robust but not overpowering. It's inviting and not overbearing. Unfortunately I'm battling with some allergies right now (damn you Sonoma County! Being close to the brewery has it's perks, but not without it's disadvantages...) so it's hard to pick off some of the finer nuances of the smell.  On to the important part though, the reason why we drink beer, and the reason this one is so popular... the taste.  It's hoppy without being too bitter or overpowering. The one-dimensional hop attack that is most IPAs and especially double IPAs certainly doesn't apply here. It's certainly a lot hoppier than it is malty, but that's the point. Because it's fresh, I'm picking off a lot of floral and citrus flavors. The flavor is complex and balanced. I was expecting overpowering bitterness but that isn't the case here. Russian River says that it's 100 IBUs but don't let that be offputting. This beer is just a drinkable as any average 50 or 60 IBU IPA. Not to mention, this beer hides it's 8 ABV well. There's no hint to let you know that you've just downed a half a liter of 8% ABV beer aside from the side effects. Usually when things start climbing in the ABV range I add ""booze"" to the list of flavors but that isn't the case here.  Mouth feel is good. Decently bodied, a little carbonated. Again, well balanced. Crisp and refreshing enough to make each sip truly enjoyable, but with just enough creaminess and body to leave a little lingering in your mouth until the next sip.  Overall, I'd have to say that this is indeed a damn fine beer. It didn't live up to the legend it's been made out to be, but I figured that people would exaggerate a bit, and plus because I live near the brewery, it has the whole ""local following"" aspect as well. I should note however that it is better than similar DIPAs of higher costs (cough cough Double Jack...), at $4.39/ea at my work (when you can find it...). Certainly a good buy if you're in the mood for an IPA. I would even recommend picking this up over most ""normal"" IPAs because it's drinkable enough that spending the extra dollar or two on the bottle will earn you something that's that much better. If you're considering buying it though, or are ever in the area by the brewery, I would say don't hesitate and just do it. You'll be glad you did.",Russian River Brewing Company,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,100
863,7971,gaugebozo,4.65,"Because I'm drinking one a little out of date (bottled in February, it's now mid-May), I'd like to not put numbers in, but am forced to.  A - Well supported head, medium/light amber color with good lacing.  S - Great. Piney, grapefruit and lemony notes.  T - Great, but to be honest, I've had better. Strong hops flavor, but well balanced malt and bitterness. Sometimes IPAs toss in a lot of caramel malts and get too sticky or go super bitter and are hard to drink. I really appreciate how the hops are allowed to shine.  M - Pleasing body, and perfectly carbed.  O - This is a great beer. I think not giving it a perfect rating comes down to a few things.  1). I've had IPA's that have better hop flavor and aroma, bordering on sitting in a room full of hops while you drink them. This could be because this one's a few months old. 2). Would expect better lacing with an IPA like this. 3). Smell mainly hop flavors, could be more complex. Again, this is all IMHO.  Altogether an awesome beer that could be better.

Leaves a small cap on the beer for the duration. Solid carbonation pulls from the bottom of the glass. It's missing some of the copper notes I would expect from the style, but damn if it isn't pretty.  Smell: Pine, citrus, and copious amounts of resin. Big malt body works to back up the hops. Nice level of caramel sweetness comes through as well. Oily, slick, and floral. So much hop aroma and depth. Bready and slightly earthy. Crazy level of hop aroma. Did I mention tropical fruit as well? Mango and pineapple. There's also that thing that smells like cotton candy that I've encountered in other DIPAs of this caliber. Faintly toasted malts round out the back.  Taste: Bitter, straight bitter. Pith. Loads of pine and citrus. Deep floral contribution as well. Mango and pinepple on the back of each sip, and that's just the hops! Malts are bready and sweet and offer a nice backbone to the hop explosion. Big slick hops everywhere. The hop profile is intense, but never overbearing. Incredibly balanced for such a hop-forward beer. Bitterness lingers throughout. There's not a lot of room for improvement here. Drinking it fresh makes all the difference in the world.  Mouthfeel: Medium body with a moderate carbonation. Smooth, a touch creamy, and a bit dry on the back. So very slick and delicious. Yup, this is how they're supposed to drink.  Overall: Damn near perfect. Pliny really is everything it's cracked up to be. There's a ton of flavor and an incredible level of balance for such intense flavor. You could easily drink 6 of these and never feel the tongue fatigue.

863,7971,Hopstamon,4.55,"Poured into a standard pint glass, this double IPA showed off a murky orange/amber color topped with a firm, resilient off-white head that left clumps of lace down the glass. The aromas of pine needles and juicy grapefruits delivered a slap to the sinuses. Once getting past the pungent hops, I could make out a grainy malt aroma that added an added incentive to taste. Taste I did. The sweet malts were noticeable briefly before getting shown the exit in favor of an avalanche of fresh hops. Lots of potent citrus flavor, slightly sticky pine sap taste and feel, and the light warming sensation of alcohol in the finish to warn of the well-concealed ABV. The feel was medium-bodied, vaguely prickly with carbonation and quite dry in the finish. Pliny The Elder is one top-notch example of what appears to be a growing style.

The aroma is full of citrus, some floral notes, and some sweet notes like tangerine/orange, nice and crisp, mostly hops in the nose. The taste is pretty amazing, some of the bitterness can be strong on the first taste but once the malts catch up on the tongue, by the second taste it settles in to be incredibly balanced with sweetness. The malts are nice and caramally (is that a word?) with maybe some breadiness to them. The hops are strong in citrus flavor. The body of the beer falls pretty inline with other double IPAs as a medium bodied beer with moderate carbonation.

The head is a frothy white head about 1 finger tall that drops to a thin layer and leaves some really nice lacing.  Firm bitterness upfront but not tongue destroying. Hops come across just like in the aroma, citrus tangerine and grapefruit goodness. The mid palate has a sweetness and finishes with a grainy after note which rounds out the beer well.  Body is light-medium with moderate carbonation and finishes dry on the palate. Overall this isn't greater or worse than what I expected, it is exactly what I expiated in different ways.

863,7971,rodkin,4.47,"Ticking a pretty big want. Thanks to tripelhops for getting me this bottle. Bottled on 4/17/12.  Pours a nice golden haze, about 1/4"" to 1/2"" head that reduces nicely to very slight film of bubbles. Visible carbonation rising up the glass. Looks maybe a tad thin? I mean, it looks great, but I'm nitpicking here.  Smell has some pretty awesome citrus. Pineapple, orange, grapefruit, maybe a little bit of peach sweetness. Not really getting much malt in here. It's really just all about the hops. No complaints from me at all, though. The smell is just about perfect.  Taste has a lot of the same citrus as the nose, especially the grapefruit. Getting more of a malty, grainy kind of flavor too, but it's pretty mild. Some pine. There's a significant bitter bite, but it's not a tongue bruiser. It is, as all the reviews say, fantastically well balanced. Everything goes together really smoothly, and nothing tastes out of place. There's only the slightest hint of alcohol in here. Dangerously easy to drink.  Mouthfeel is great. Really nice carbonation, medium body.  Did it live up to the hype for me? Yes and no. I'm looking for flaws and they're just not coming up. This beer is really perfectly executed, and for what it is it's hard to beat. That said, it didn't wow me as much as I thought it would, and I think it could definitely be improved on.

863,7971,falloutsnow,4.5,"From: CE, from Colorado, much thanks Bottled: 4/3/12 (review 6/29/12) Glass: tulip  I enjoyed this much more out of the bottle than on tap. This is certainly one of the excellent examples in the DIPA style with some very nice fruit-forward hopping and substantial depth going on. That being said, I still don't think this is the ""best ever"" beer. Would be quite satisfied to have this regularly available, but there are enough solid varieties out there that I don't miss this one's unavailability.  Pours a tall, off-white head of 2-3cm, made up of small bubbles, that has better than average retention. Head gradually fades to a thin cap atop the body with a thicker ring around the perimeter of the glass. Head leaves some solid lacing along sides of the glass. Beer is nearly opaque from sediment, but still slightly see-through. Golden orange in color, with light bringing a yellow hue to a lighter orange body. Carbonation is visible along the sides and bottom of the glass, looks to be fairly active.  Aroma of very nice, mildly sweet apricot preserves, very deep grapefruit rind, faintly sweet orange rind, and fairly bright malt sweetness nestled nicely behind all this.  Tip of tongue picks up slight malt sweetness with hints of apricot and orange flesh. Front of palate accentuates these initial flavors with deeper toffee-like malt sweetness, and bolder apricot and orange flavors. Mid-palate brings out extensive grapefruit flavor and bitterness, allowing just a bit of the continual apricot and orange flavor to persist and seep through. Back of palate captures more grapefruit bitterness and citrus flavors including grapefruit, tangerine, and tart orange. Closes with a brief flash of ethanol, leading to a long-lingering bitterness that's on top of some lightly sweet toffee-like malt.  Beer is medium to medium-heavy bodied, with medium-level carbonation. This causes the beer to foam up a bit on the palate, resulting in an at-first crisp mouthfeel, then one that feels smooth and fairly creamy. Finish is dry with ethanol only being noticed in the close, and then, only a small amount.  Had on tap at Bobby G's in Berkeley, CA Served in a Pliny the Elder pint glass (standard US) Review from notes Original rating (4, 4, 4, 5, 4)  Pliny the Elder is a very good, balanced DIPA, but that balance, for me, does not make this the ""holy grail"" of beer that it seems to be. Enjoyably grapefruit-accented with touches of pine resin and malt components, this is a good, classic DIPA. While I'm not sure this deserves the accolades it receives, I would not pass over another glass of this, and am curious to try it out of a bottle. However, I'm not sure I'd be this curious if it weren't for the hype, mystique, and limited availability of the beer.  Some questions: what makes this more impressive than a very good IPA or any other very good DIPA? Is balance equivalent to excellence? Why is this considered so special? I asked myself these questions during the course of drinking this, and had no certain answers; I suggest that all beer advocates consider them while partaking, too.  Arrives with a small (1.5cm) head of white foam, composed of fairly dense, small bubbles. Head eventually descends to a ring around the glass with some thin islands of foam atop the body. Leaves some spotty lacing along sides of glass, which is renewed with each sip. Body is a rich golden yellow color with slight orange tints. Carbonation is easily visible through the transparent body.  Aroma of grapefruit-like hop contributions, along with some pine resin as well. Not predominantly tropical or over the top with explosive noticeability of hops. Some pale malt sweetness tempers the hops. I don't detect any ethanol. Good, but I don't notice anything out of the ordinary relative to a good west coast IPA.  Taste is similar to smell, with grapefruit-like flavors; noticeable, but not overwhelming bitterness; a bit of pine resin; more detectable malt sweetness than in aroma, which also contributes a hint of grain. No ethanol flavors, which somewhat suprised me given the ABV. Quite good, balanced, but again nothing that astounds me or makes me think this is somehow miles apart from any other solid IPA or DIPA.  Beer is medium to medium-heavy bodied, with medium-level carbonation. This causes the beer to foam up a bit on the palate, leading to a slightly smooth, but still crisp mouthfeel. Finish is dry, from the hops. No ethanol burn felt. Very impressive for a DIPA in all aspects of this.",Russian River Brewing Company,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,100
863,7971,Beer21,4.86,"I picked up my bottle at the brewery so it is fresh. Poured it into a Russian River pint glass. It pours a beautiful golden with a half finger head. The head is nearly white and lingers shortly.  The smell is absolutely wonderful and full of hops. Lots of citrus and pine. I have had beers with more hops aroma, but this one is near the top.  The taste is right up my alley. Full of bitterness and simplicity. Very crisp and refreshing. The malt is very subtle which helps accentuate the hop profile. It is very similar to Russian River's Blind Pig.  The mouthfeel is appropriate for the hop and malt profiles with a crispness, moderate alcohol, and thin consistency. Well balanced for a hophead like me.  Overall this is one of my favorite beers, but hard to come by in my home state of Florida. It is not the best IPA I have ever had, but it is one of the top five.",Russian River Brewing Company,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,100

O: Probably the best beer that have I ever had. I was caught by surprise. I only ordered it, because it was the only IPA at the butcher shop that I hadn't drank before. I was just blown away by how complete and balanced this was.",Russian River Brewing Company,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,100
863,7971,WeedKing4,4.23,Had this at the brewpub. Tastes very hoppy with a bitter finish that attacks your tongue nicely. Lots of citrus and grapefruit notes.

While it definitely lived up to the hype, not sure that it's my favorite of this style.  Pours a transparent golden/orange color. Medium sized head with a vigorous pour.  Smell is of citrus, hops, and floral scents. Taste is similar to the scent and what you would expect, but I also get the slight addition of pine.  The alcohol in this one is well hidden and I don't get to much of it.  Overall there is a reason this beer has the overall rating it does and I can see why. Will be looking to find it again.",Russian River Brewing Company,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,100
863,7971,raynmoon,4.03,"Re-review. Had this beer many times. 9 day old bottle.  It pours a very crystal clear golden orange with a nice creamy white looking head. it disappears pretty quickly, but some lacing sticks around nicely on the sides. Exactly what a west coast style IPA looks like.  There is virtually no aroma on this beer, if there is, it is very muted. I do get some classic piney, notes, some grainy sweetness, but not much. Disappointing.  The taste is better, mostly a nice balance between caramel sweetness, bitterness, and piney hop flavors. There is nothing new with this beer, and for those who have never had it, but are very familiar with the newer India pale ales on the market, you'll likely be dissapointed.  The feel is very fizzy for some reason. But not too noticeable. Light to medium body, appropriate.   Overall, I don't know what has happened to my taste buds, or this beer, or both. But I've had it numerous times in the passed year, and every time I've had it I've been upset by it. I can't even count the number of hoppy beers I've had that are better than this one.   Still, it is the original, the classic. Still tasty, just doesn't do it for me.",Russian River Brewing Company,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,100

Hop forward for sure, but there is some malt in the background.  T: Hoppy, yet sweet with a nice malt backbone. Tropical fruits, nice crisp finish that is not bitter are tongue wrecking. Very, very clean and amazing balanced.  M: Medium body, average carbonation, nice slick feel to it.  O: Dangerously drinkable. The 8% is hidden very well.

Not too overpowering. I was expecting a little more but was pleasantly surprised.  T - This is a very good IPA. Great hop balance with malt - nothing over the top. In general I was surprised. This is an excellent example of the style - probably one of the best - but I don't think this is a 100/100 beer. I could easily drink this beer for a long time but I'm not sure it's quite lived up to the hype.  M - Great spiciness combined with he nice malt profile. I wonder if there's a little rye in here or if it's just the hops.  O - Again, a great beer.

I had had it once before on draught out at the Lagunitas Skunk Train Event off of a cold plate at a revelers camp site and remember it being phenomenal!  A - Poured into a Duvel glass it poured a thick but bubbly (was probably my fault in the pour) head that retained very well. Had a golden orange haze in color.  S - Smells of citrus and pine.  T - Nice hop presence, piney, grassy, orange with a mereinge creaminess. Abv potency is not very prevalent.  M - Mouthfeel is rather creamy, I actually expected more body.  O -Although this beer is really very delicious, I think the hype has spoiled my impression. I remember it much better than this, although my first taste was on draught at the Lagunitas Skunk Train tail gate which you know may have leant some environment pluses to the impression.

863,7971,CaptDavyJones,4.72,"Finally had Pliny The Elder on-tap at the Neighborhood in San Diego. Crystal clear golden-orange color with a nice one finger head that dissipated fairly slowly. Aroma and taste live up to all the hype. Lots of tropical fruit in the nose; grapefruit, citrus and pine with some mango. Perfect balance of hop twang and malts. Words don't do enough justice to this fantastic brew. Tastes almost like freshly squeezed hop juice, with just the right amount of bitterness balanced with sweetness. Lots of lacing along the insides of the pint glass. Very easy to drink considering it is 8% alcohol by volume. One of the best DIPA's that I have had....period.

Huge hops featuring pine and citrus, but also a malt backbone. The hops really let you know they're there, but aren't overpowering, and the rest of the beer comes through in balance making for a really tasty drink. M: Gives you a hop kick but overall is medium-bodied with pleasant carbonation and integrated malt/alcohol.

863,7971,Yoda22,4.77,"Ahhh the holy grail of IPA's, finally a chance to try. Poured from 500ml bottle into large pilsner glass. This is pretty fresh as it was bottle last month.  A- Pours a mostly clear light orange with 2 fingers of frothy white head that sticks around pretty long. Good lacing.  S- I think I died and went to hop heaven. There is at a minimum some floral, citrus and pine character all in one. There is also some sweetness which may be the hops delivering some passion fruit type aroma? Could be malt also but with the amount of hops in here i'm guessing hops. Can't ask for more awesomeness.  T- Such complex balance and taste. I don't think any description I can conjure up will do it justice, but i'll try. The hop character definitely dominates throughout; more balanced early and mid with a little more lingering bitterness late that hangs around for a long time. The taste does not hit you with all citrus or all pine or any one thing in excess; it's just this insane blend of so many different things (balanced out so very nicely by the malt). But I guess it leans closer to citrus/mango/grapefruit/passion fruit type flavor than anything else.  M- A pretty perfect medium body and low to medium carbonation. Not much prickly sensation from the hops (how is that possible!?) and coats your mouth like a warm hoppy blanket (you like that right?).  O- Not much I can add other than to say it's definitely one of the best beers i've tasted. I knocked off a tiny .5 from appearance because i've seen beers with a little better head retention and lacing, and I took off a tiny .5 from taste because I like a little more piney hop character like Lagunitas frequently includes; but this is a top notch beer that all hop heads should enjoy one time or another.",Russian River Brewing Company,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,100
863,7971,StonedTrippin,4.55,"after years and years and years of waiting for this one and reading the heavy hype, my new beer drinking girlfriend sourced 2 bottles of this for us. apparently she called all over denver and finally hooked it up at mr. b's liquor. thank god she did. this mythical beer pours a slightly cloudy honey orange color with a one inch bone white head that has excellent retention. the smell is amazing, really tropical hops. im picking up passion fruit, clementines, and something even more intense like a pau pau or a mango, im not quite sure, but its all from the hops. makes me think there is nelson sauvin in here, but i cant confirm that, similar profile though. flavor has all the same hop essences, but is rounded out with a crackery seedy malt flavor that lays just under the hops, which arent in any way overbearing and bitter. this is really sensational. mouthfeel would be a 6 out of 5 if that was a choice, it is light feeling and smoothly creamy despite its squarely medium body. its got this perfectly made richness of feel when its held in the mouth, it gets foamy and huge and cloud-like. well carbonated but not like soda pop, its more tame and gentle, different vibe totally, but equally bright. quite a surprisingly dry finish, but appealing in this context. the aftertaste is legendary, hanging on forever. forever. every tastebud on my tongue is firing, bitter ones are dancing up front, sweet ones are tickling me in the back, and fruity like the islands somewhere in between. my inner beer geek is just brimming with accomplishment and radiating joy. this is fucking excellent. worth every dollop of hype, i cant wait for my next go!  edit: even more perfect on tap, at the brewery. if you like hoppy beers, this is a sojourn worth taking. just sensational!  edit: as time has gone by and everyone has at least caught up to this, it still stands out, rises above the rest of its peers by head and shoulders when fresh, literally unbeatable as a west coast ipa type, the gold standard without a peer, even all these years later...",Russian River Brewing Company,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,100
863,7971,zac16125,4.27,"500mL bottle poured into a snifter Born on: 04/03/12  A: Pours a hazy dark straw color with just under one fingers width of sea foam white head which dissipates fairly quickly to only an outer ring.  Tiny sedimentation particles can be seen suspended in the glass.  Leaves a fair amount of patchy lacing.  S: A big citrus hop aroma with notes of pineapple, peach, orange, lemon zest, and grapefruit.  There is also a resiny, piney hop presence, and grassy/floral characters.  The malt backbone is almost negligible on the nose.  Very nice.    T: There are significantly more malt characteristics present in the taste then on the nose.  Initially it's bready malts upfront and biting piney hop bitterness on the backed.  There is a prominent smoky characteristic as well, which I find pretty unique for the style.  As it warms, other flavors come out, including a malt sweetness and a citrus hop presence that consists mostly of orange and some lemon zest, with a hint of peach as the warming continues.  It's well balanced, but lacking in the big citrus character that's present on the nose.  M/D: There is a great smoothness to this beer, which is one thing that helps separate the men from the boys when it comes to the DIPA style in my book.  It has a nice medium body with an appropriate carbonation and a nice drying finish.  The ABV is in no way noticeable, and the drinkability is dangerously high.    O: I've had PtE a few times on tap, but this is my first bottle experience.  It's good, very good, but to me it doesn't live up to the hype.  The aroma is great, but the taste just doesn't quite do it for me.  I wish the citrus explosion from the nose was more prevalent on the tounge.  Now don't get me wrong, this is a really really good brew, that I will drink any chance I get.  However,  when it comes to the big DIPA's, my order is Hopslam--&gt;Heady Topper--&gt; PtE, and I can even say I've had a couple non 'big name'  DIPAs that I think are better offerings.

Appearance: Pours a beautiful, crystal clear, pale orange with a 2 finger tall pure white head that leaves thick curtains of lace down the sides of the glass as it recedes. Gorgeous.  Aroma: The hops absolutely burst out of the glass with distinct aromas of big juicy grapefruit, pine needles, ripe peach and little bit of pineapple. There is a distinct note of slightly sweet, bready malt to bring absolute perfect balance in the nose of this incredible IPA.  Taste: Huge, juicy citrus to the palate right away; mostly grapefruit and some impressions of tangerine. There is a sizable pine presence that follows up the initial bite of citrus, but the pine soon gives way to a brief note of lemon zest as the soft and chewy biscuit-y malt backbone cushions your palate from the positively explosive hops. The beer finishes very dry with a delightful bitterness that is intermingled with leftover whispers of the clean, crisp malt bill.  Mouthfeel: Very full bodied, moderate carbonation, dry.  Overall: The quintessential double IPA, created by the brewer of the first Double IPA, Vinnie Cilurzo. I've had this beer hundreds of times and every time I drink one, I am continuously taken aback by the balance, drinkability and sheer quality of the hops in this beer. There has been many imitations attempted by many craft brewers, but I have yet to taste a single Imperial/Double IPA that toes the delicate line of balancing in your face hops and bready maltiness. Do plenty of other craft brewers make bigger and hoppier beers? Sure, but none can make me appreciate the finer things in life as much as Pliny does.

A crystal clear copper body is topped off by a couple of fingers worth of thick bone white head. Head eventually settles to a ring. Plenty of lace is left coating the glass in its wake.  Pliny hits the nose with an amalgamation of hop bomb perfection. Citrusy and juicy grapefruit strike first. Juicy oranges meld with the grapefruit. A strong tropical quality, mangoes and passion fruit, flow with the citrus notes. A light herbal, mint perhaps, note hits underneath the fruit. Just the barest hint of bready and caramel malt manages to break through the hops.  The taste is quite impressive. Hops barrage the palate. They wash over with a drying quality that urges one to take another sip. Bitter juicy grapefruit takes hold first. Juicy oranges join forces with the grapefruit for an assault of citrusy goodness. Tropical fruits show up mid palate. Mango notes are a bit stronger on the palate. Bitter grapefruit again take hold in the dry bitter finish.  Pliny The Elder is a nice medium bodied brew.

While I would have, if reviewing it today, used many different descriptors and verbiage from the above, by and large the tasting notes haven't changed.

863,7971,DM1293,5,"Lemme tell you a story.  I used to not drink hoppy beers at all. I stuck toward more malty brews, or simpler beers like Coronas and Heinekens. When I did start drinking in the craft brews, it was hefeweizens and red ales. I worked my way around, dabbling in porters, and stouts. Light lagers. When I stared reviewing beers, I had tried a fair share and retried others later...but I had never had a hoppy beer. Finally I couldn't put it off, and took a chance at BJ's, to sort of commemorate my 10th beer review. I took mild surprise at the taste not being as bad as others put it up to be, with the high bitterness.  I'm not a hop-head. Strictly speaking, I wasn't much of one either until I tried Red Chair and much of Deschutes pales, which is a recent thing.  Pliny the Elder? This could convert me to full hop-head status.  Appearance - It looks incredible. There was such a variety of shades to it; it shone gold and copper and tints of light light green. The beer almost looks like its shimmering, a slight oily nature to it. Its a trip to look at and shine in the light.  Smell - Lush and citrusy. You can tell its a hoppy beer. A wonderful boquet of hops of all styles mingled here.  Taste - Its every bit as hoppy as a double IPA should be. Its every kind of hop as far as I could tell, with an orangey-grapefruity citrus right up front, into the grassy piney hops. Malt gives it a little more backbone substance, but its a background flavor to me. A bitterness keeps it from being too sweet, and as soon as you get the flavors across and down your throat, the bitterness goes away at the same time. Its perfectly balanced.  Mouthfeel: Nice and crisp and a light lingering to it thats not unpleasant at all. It stays as long as it needs to without being overpowering.  Overall - Congratulations Russian River Brewing Company. You've made me a hop-head. I don't like this beer. I don't love this beer. I ADORE this beer. It has such good flavor with incredible balance. I could (and would if it wasn't so strong in ABV) drink this anytime, anywhere, anyplace. I can't think of a single thing I could do to improve upon it.  And for the price? Its damn hard to find, but so reasonably priced, only five bucks?! I've had craft beers higher priced that didn't taste half as good as this. Well deserving of a 5 in my book.",Russian River Brewing Company,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,100

The back end is where it falls apart, nothing but bitter bitter bitter.  M: Pretty standard for the style, nothing more to say.  O: Great beer. I've had far better IIPA/DIPA, but a good example of the style. I expected more from it due to the great scores on BA, however it was still very good. Deserving of its rating? Not to me!

863,7971,DocJitsu,4.5,"Pours a copper golden color with a huge, fluffy, white head. The head seems to have a life of it's own and taunts the would be consumer with contempt. It's like a watched pot that never boils. I've never seen a head retain so well. You think you're taunting me beer? Well, guess what, I'm reviewing you on BA, so I've got time. In keeping with the theme of this weekend past, the bouquet is as if a golfer at Augusta National had missed the fairway and ended up in the pine straw. While he waited for his partner to hit his ball, he dropped the big, juicy grapefruit he was eating into the pine straw. Hints of biscut malt come through as well. The mouthfeel is nearly perfect for this style. The oilyness is very pleasing and complimentary to the flavor/aroma. This is a masterfully balanced IPA. Everything works together to deliver a whole-is-greater-than-the-sum-of-its-parts experience. It not only involves, it demands the attention of your sight, olfactory, taste, and tactile senses.

Two finger fluffy off-white head protruded above the glass. Settled in to one finger of pillowy foam. Left some minor sticky lacing. Very nice golden color.  Dank, skunky, resinous, piney and citrusy hops. I did catch a little bit of malt at times, but this beer is obviously all about the hops. The smell reminded me of certain activities that I used to take part in while in college *nudge nudge*  Very nice citrus an pine bitterness. An earthy and grassy taste emerges near the end with VERY minor sweet malt for the finish. The bitterness lingers for a while. Absolutely delicious.  Very bubbly, but also smooth. Leaves that nice resin feeling in your mouth. Very clean.  I made sure to try to look at this from the style standpoint and not the exclusivity of the product. This is one fantastic beer.

863,7971,keepitsimple1990,4.65,"Picked up a bottle about 20 minutes ago, in Orange County. Bottle date 03-20-12. Fresh. First review for this, but i've had it before many times. Message me if you need help getting some, because we have it every week at several places down here.  Anyway.  Appearance: Darker, clear, almost syrupy looking IPA. So darker is implying a almost golden like green yellow. When tilted and looked at along the edges, i've noticed a green tinge to it.  Smell: If you want that specific Pliny smell thats like few others, then your going to love the smell. I think it's almost indescribable. But resin, hop buds, and a ton of skunk. I've heard it described as the beer that ""stoners"" would like because of it's intense skunkyness and resin like qualities, it's just hoppy goodness.  Taste: I do not know what the name is of the main hop that I can taste in Pliny. But I think it's also used prominently in Avery's IPA's and a limited few others. Maybe simcoe I've been told. Anyway, It's amazingly resiny and floral, and lemon, and grapefruit (very small) but citrusy. (Ugh I just finished it :( haha).  Mouthfeel: I like the somewhat heavyness of it. It's *% so the alcohol is there. But at only 500 ml a bottle there's no fear of taking big sips. But they are sips. Chuging some sips, and I've done it, will ruin the nice slick smooth mouthfeel and you wont get the taste. I don't care if your not into IPA's, the mouthfeel will at worst make it seem like your drinking weak alchohol, it's that smooth. The brewing and carbonation are in perfect ratio every time I've tried it.  Get your hands on some. I'll help you out. It should be shared.  P.S. One of the best, no the best. And thats still saying so much.",Russian River Brewing Company,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,100
863,7971,DSlim71,4.8,"Big thanks to Matt (Crawbee87) for sending me a few RR goodies. This happens to be my last bottle of Pliny. Bottle dated 3/5/12.  A - A slightly hazy, light golden hue that generates an off white, 1 1/2 inch head that leaves some nice lacing on the glass.  S - Hop dominated aroma with pine leading the way, followed by grapefruit and fresh peach. You could smell this immediately on the pour.  T - A blast of pine and citrus that really leaves a solid bitterness on the tongue. I love the balance between the grapefruit and piney flavors RR is able to achieve in this brew. The sweetness from the malt does a great job of holding everything together, but you know this beer isn't about the malt. Finishes bone dry with a little sweetness left behind.  M - Medium body and carbonation, sticky and resinous from the hops.  I could drink this all day if I didn't have to get it from the other side of the country. Also, the 8% abv is extremely well hidden, and falls right in the range where I like my DIPAs. This brew deserves to be towards the top of most lists.",Russian River Brewing Company,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,100

I was on a rented motorcycle when I stopped in at the Russian River establishment. And believe me this isn't what one should be drinking if they have to drive.

863,7971,Gambelli,4.98,"Rated this beer a couple years back, now time for a full review. 16.9 oz. bottle from Craftshack. Bottled on 5/21/2015, imbibing on 6/16/2015. Into the Sam Adams perfect pint glass it goes. Crystal clear yellowish-gold with a one finger head. The smell is not as pungent as I remember, but still great stuff. A plethora of tropical and citrus fruits with a hint of the onion/garlic component found in many of my favorite DIPA's. I could sit and enjoy the aroma for quite some time, but on to bigger and better things! Taste is moderate hop bitterness up front followed close behind with all the fruits mentioned in the aroma. There's also a bit of pine and herbal notes here. Sturdy malt backbone supports all the hops nicely, and that's where this beer really shines. It's perfect balance. Not overly carbonated, enhancing flavors and drinkability. Dangerously drinkable in fact, and more than one of these will get me talking to my ancestors. Not as heavy as many other DIPA's and I like that quality. Perfect lacing rings around the glass at the finish. I am one of the believers of the hype surrounding this brew, and it is a treat to score a bottle of this.",Russian River Brewing Company,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,100
863,7971,DrFayhee,4.32,"A: Golden-yellow color, clear with a medium-thick head. S: Rich sweet hops. The first fruity hit gives way to aromas of rose-hip, tea leaves, flowers, with some faint pine scents. T: Matches the smell pretty well. A real hop-bomb that packs quite a bit of tartness. M: Very clean, medium-bodied and medium carbonation. Quite dry.  Not sure I understand the wild obsession with this beer. I guess it's like the ideal of IPA for some people.",Russian River Brewing Company,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,100

Amber color with large bubbles in carbonation.  S- Spicy hops, very hoppy smell. Tasty and spicy smelling with lighter citrusy fruits.  T- Hoppy, but wonderfully so. Has the attacking flavor of a DIPA and slight bitterness but finishes floraly hoppy and warm.  M- Medium bodied, very smooth texture, clean linger. Wonderful.  O- I see what the hype is about. A delicious beer.",Russian River Brewing Company,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,100
863,7971,Ruds,4.76,"Thanks to Deeblo for carting the bottle some 6,000 miles to me ! Bottled 3 weeks prior to me drinking.  Poured into a tulip glass to a golden amber colour with a decent finger of white head which retained well, it looks a treat almost too good to drink !  Hoppy aroma of grapefruit, pine and to a lesser extent orange. The smell was good but didn't bowl me over have smelt better DIPA's but as for the taste ...  Everything one could wish for in a DIPA!  Hops, pine, citrus fruit, grapefruit, tangerine, orange a little malt and breadiness in the backbone, excellent bitter/dry finish - spot on !  Mouthfeel pitched absoultely to perfection in terms of the correct level of carbonation, body, taste.  Overall a fantastic well balanced DIPA that belies the 8% alochol level in drinkability.

Probably my favorite part about both Pliny the Elder and Younger. Smells of citrus, pine, hops, and just freshness  Taste: Swirl the beer around in a cold tulip, take a deep smell, and then a substantial sip...glorious. This beer is so much better to me fresh out of the bottle than it is every time I have it on tap. Citrus, floral notes, balanced hops and malt, and amazing smell make this beer so unique. I have had it many many many times, and a fresh batch out of a bottle is by far the way to drink theis DIPA.  Mouthfeel: coats the toungue, but not syrupy.  Overall: One of my favorites and I am very happy that they distribute to my area quite frequently. I have had many double IPAs and this one is still the king to me (although I am DYING to try Citra IPA because it sounds like Pliny 2.0). Fresh, citrusy, liquid gold.

863,7971,NoLeafClover44,4.55,"Thanks, Jeff. 500 mL bottle poured into standard pint.  A - Pours a hazy golden-orange color with a one finger white head. The head retreats to a sticky lacing.  S - Extremely floral smell with good grapefruit citrus. The hops are piney and pronounced and some biscuity malts round it out.  T - Starts with a big tart citrus character made up of grapefruit and lemon zest. Some floral spice and a little bit of malt in the middle. The finish is full of bitter pine hops, but the citrus continues throughout. Very balanced and no alcohol.  M - Nice prickly carbonation pairs with a medium-light body makes for a nearly perfect feel. I was actually surprised at how light and tingly the feel was for such a flavorful DIPA.  O - I obviously opened this beer with very high expectations. I was impressed by how much citrus was in this beer. Reminds me of an ""Imperial Zombie Dust."" Incredibly balanced and overall, very impressive. Every once in a while I have a beer that has the flavor to sets it apart from the rest, and this is one of those cases. I drink alot of DIPAs, but this was a little bit different, and I thoroughly enjoyed it.",Russian River Brewing Company,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,100
863,7971,Groulxsome,5,"From my notes. Drank on March 9, 2012, bottled on February 6, 2012.  A: It's much lighter than most IPA's I've had, near a tangerine orange color, maybe more amber than copper. The lacing is subtle, but firm. It's really a pretty beer.  S: Syrup sweet malts, with resiny piny hops. There are layers of passionfruit and pineapple too. It's a combination of those tropical fruits from the West Coast with a sweet malt and pine that is pretty unmistakably a Pliny (I've had it before on tap and in bottles when it has been fresher).  T: It opens with citrus. There is almost a sour note, like a saison or some lemon zest, in the citrus which could either be the hops or the yeast. It grabs the back of my tongue a little with the sourness. Then there is the malt sweetness, some caramel but really balanced with the hops which are more grapefruit, citrus and tropical fruit. The bitter is rich but tempered to the rest of the beer. Nothing out of control.  M: Thick, smooth, with only a light amount of carbonation. A tinge of alcohol at the end.  O: Ok, so maybe this is the prefect exercise in balance. That sour taste with the balanced hops and bitter, the sweet, syrupy malt, the, well, the everything. Its all just right. I don't know if this is the best beer ever, it's a damn good beer. Is it worth the hype? Probably. But, really, versus something like Firestone Walker's Union Jack, Stone's Double Bastard, or Great Divide's Hercules DIPA, I'd be hard pressed to choose a favourite. It would depend on where I was, what I was doing there, and how much the bar was charging for each.",Russian River Brewing Company,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,100

A - It poured a pale transparent apricot color with a small white head which did not last long. There was a descent amount of lacing that stuck to the edge of the glass.  S - Floral hops, pine, slight tropical friuit, and some slight sweet aroma in the background. Nothing is overpowering; it just smells really good and refreshing.  T - It's extremely well balanced. Nothing overpowers you in this brew. It's masterful in that way.  M - This is one of the easiest DIPAs to drink. It's not heavy or too strong tasting. It's a brew you could drink throughout the day.

The one thing that really stuck out to me about this beer was....nothing. I mean that in the best possible way. Not many imperial IPAs leave you feeling like you could drink them all day.

I was very impressed by the balance though. Not overpower like other DIPA's by any means!  M: Very pleasant, not heavy, extremely drinkable, this is an IPA to go for.  O: Given its high rating and scarcity I had to try it. I would say give it a try once and make sure to get as much as you can when you do. I took a quick 15 min tour of the brewery with the manager and he said this stuff sometimes doesn't even make it to the kegs and goes strait to the taps. Was $5 for 500ml at the Russian River Brewery so not too bad at 8%. What a great brew and an even better brewery! I see why it's rated world class.  The brew I had was bottled on 03-19-2012.

Recently had a fresh one next to another that had sat in a car for 2 days (in mild cool weather) unrefrigerated and the piney, resin flavors/aromas were noticable diminished in the older sample.

The appearance is a nice golden color, nice head and lots of beautiful carbonation.  The smell is all hops and pine; if I could make a candle that smelled like this I would.  Taste is not overly bitter, but very hoppy. The flavors of the hops are balanced perfectly with the bittness and alcohol. Exactly what I think of when I imagine an IPA.  The mouthfeel is medium bodied, excellent carbonation, and the alcohol is very well masked as I stated earlier.

Slightly hazy...lots of bubbles rising up. Two finger pillowy white head with tight bubbles. Slowly settled to a cap that covered the entire top throughout. Much lacing.  S: A forest of resiny pine. Some graham cracker crust or brown sugar.  T: The aroma was decidedly understated compared to the waves of flavor that you are hit with. Woody pine resin and grapefruit is featured. Some grainy malt and just a touch of sweetness. I suspect there is a good amount of malt in this but this bottle is fresh enough that it’s still way, way in the background. Alcohol is well hidden behind the hop avalanche.  M: Body is medium and carbonation lively. The abrasive pine is all up in your business...drying out your tongue. Nothing objectionable for a hophead however.  O: The gold standard in aggressive hop-forward beers. The thing that sets this apart from many others is that it pushes the limits without going over and has such a nice smooth finish for such a massive hop profile.

863,7971,WankelEngine,4.82,"Poured from a 500ml bottle into a pint glass Bottled on date: 02/13/12  A: A fairly vigorous pour yields a 2-3 finger, just off-white head. It leaves beautiful curtains of lace. The beer itself is a light golden-amber color with a lot of visible carbonation.  S: Smells of pungent, resinous hops. This provides both bitter pine and grass as well as some citrus and grapefruit flavors. There are some light tropical scents behind this, creating a very full, hop-centered aroma.  T: Hop-forward and delectable. Similar resinous pine from the smell, but the fruit flavors open up. Tropical, citrus, grapefruit, pear and maybe apple. There is a hint of the alcohol content which increases as the beer warms, but only serves to complement the pine. There is a light malt backbone which provides good balance and some light toffee. The finish has some lingering bitterness.  M: Smooth and almost creamy. Medium bodied with just a hint of alcohol and light to moderate carbonation.  O: One of my new favorite IIPAs.

863,7971,MONKandTUCK,3.86,"A - Very bright. It's yellow, rather than warm orange. The head-retention sucks.  A - Plenty of orange, bright citrus. But there's even more fresh pine. Kinda reminds me of a car-freshener, then backed by a fresh-squeezed juice note. This doesn't blow me away, but it's refreshing and familiar.  T - Juicy, a little prickly, definitely sweet. For being so hoppy and sweet, the bitterness is relatively smooth and the finish approaches dry. It's not as crisp as other IPAs, but for being such a sturdy beer it remains tight. The bitterness has degree of harshness requisite of an IPA; anything else and the beer would lack character. I'm not blown-away by the flavor profile. This beer is far from pedestrian, but Centennial-oriented IPAs just do it better.  M - Coming out of the winter months, and just passing St Pat's most have become accustomed to big malty beers. I'm sure other times of the year perception varies, but presently this beer qualifies as lean on compact, very drinkable.  O - It's a flavorsome beer that does so many things so very well. If I were to dedicate several weeks to drinking only this beer I'd have more confidence and depth in my opinion. Drinking beers like Nugget Nectar, Great Divide's Barleywine, and Weyerbacher's Double Simcoe recently, I feel that my palate has been skewed by larger beers.  What I like about Pliny is that it gets as big and sweet as a beer can be without ever becoming boozy and heavy. Further, the copious amount of hops never impart any offensive flavors.  I can quickly name several IPA's which I prefer to this one. So, I gotta add that the hype is overrated.

Yes, after years on BA and hundreds of beers, the time has finally come for me to taste this beer. This is one of the 5 most hyped beers in recent craft history. Poured into a tall, antique Czech pilsener glass that easily swallows the entire bottle.  The beer produces a thick two fingers of pillowy head that seems to last forever. The body is light gold and almost totally clear. Lighter than the average IPA.  The aroma is truly hoppy. The hoppiest I have ever smelled? Probably not, however it is very fresh smelling and very bright. Sweet, freshly cut grass, split ponderosa logs, a fistful of pineapple and grapefruit chunks, and touch of basil and mint make up the highly bitter, bright nose. Well done.  The flavor is truly good. Possibly the cleanest and brightest DIPA I have yet tasted. Truly resinous in a wonderful way. If hops had juice this bottle would say ""not from concentrate"", which is interesting since RR uses some hop extract in this beer. As I sip this I keep coming back to the idea of juice, and I think it is because of the surprising sweetness in the beginning of this flavor. I did not see this factor coming. It kind of tastes like what I would imagine the juice of ""hop fruit"" would taste like, if such a thing existed. I have never tasted an IPA that was this sweet, and the further into the glass I get the more I find myself wishing for less sugary sweetness, but it sure does make it drinkable!  The mouthfeel is medium bodied with medium carbonation, which is exactly where I like things in a DIPA. It could have a touch higher ""hop oil"" feel (if there is such a thing) but I am really just being nit picky. Well done mouthfeel.  Conclusion: Today there are hundreds of IPAs and DIPAs that all taste basically the same. My biggest fear with Pliny was that it would turn out to be just another like so many of the rest, and that outside of a slightly fresher taste it wouldn't stand out. I am glad however to find that it actually is unique, with a flavor that isn't quite like anything else I have tasted. It is an amazingly unadulterated liquid form of fresh hop cones, which is pretty awesome. I can now cease scoffing at the masses for hyping this beer up beyond reach, as it truly is a magnificent DIPA. The best? Nearly, but it doesn't quite take gold in my book. I remember a time when this beer could be seen sitting in the cooler at a local store! I never paid any attention to it and by the time I realized what it was, so had the rest of my town, and now it never even makes it onto the floor, and only lasts a day or two when kept out of sight.",Russian River Brewing Company,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,100
863,7971,kc44,4.58,"Flawless, golden color that is as deep as it can be before it starts to move towards bronze. Could retain its head just a bit more. Smell is great, nothing but a one-stop education in American hops with their citrus, pine, and resin, but its strength is also its weakness; I feel like there could be more depth to the hop bouquet. I don't believe DIPAs need to be one dimensional on the nose, since in my opinion the best ones certainly aren't when it comes to flavor. Taste is a perfect balance of towering hop bitterness on a firm malt foundation, not too sweet, not too dry; while this is obviously a thoroughly bitter beer, the rest of the elements keep it in check and prevent it from overwhelming the palate. Goes down nice and smooth, just a little overcarbonated, but that isn't an entirely a bad thing as it kept my pace more toward where it should be. Overall, an absolutely stunning beer, a must-have, not the undisputed greatest double IPA I've ever had, but it is certainly fairly high up on the list.",Russian River Brewing Company,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,100
863,7971,ThePorterSorter,4.42,"Approximately 2 months old, I know some people would toss this little guy in the trash...but I think it'll do the trick.  The beer pours a clear, mildly dark amber with a bleach white foamy head. There's generous carbonation and a ton of lacing. This looks elegant, but doesn't blow my socks off based on appearance alone. The smell on the other hand...good god there is a tremendous amount of citrus fruit and alcohol. This smells excellent in summary. The taste doesn't blow my socks off either, but exudes balance. There is nothing out of place and it's incredibly drinkable. The hops shine through with an expected amount of puckering citrus tartness and resiny bitterness while the sweetness carries it through to a perfectly balanced gulp. There is a light residual bitterness, but it's not at all unwanted. It has a nearly perfect mouthfeel. Overall, for a $5 bottle out in cali, this is surely an incredible beer that I'd drink as often as I could. Unfortunately, it's hard to get (especially at peak freshness) and I have to reflect that in my overall review... However, I can see why this beer is worth the effort.",Russian River Brewing Company,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,100
863,7971,AgentMunky,4.14,"Served in a pint glass at Toronado in San Francisco.  A: Little head. Super clear light yellow. Unimpressive.  S: Loads of astringent hops. Pine a citrus. Nice enough.  T: Better than from the bottle, I'll admit. A hopbomb heavy on the citrus, with a resiny-bitter end taste. Drinkable, if you can stand the moderately astringent hops, but more balanced than I remember. A touch of herbs or garlic on the aftertaste.  M: Not as thin as the bottled version, for which I'm grateful. More carbonated and chewy.  O: Still not fantastic, but recommendable, if a blunt and rather boring West Coast DIPA. I think I'm done with Pliny.",Russian River Brewing Company,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,100
863,7971,jtingue,4.95,"Bottle dated 2/13/12. Poured into a tulip.  Appearance. Crystal clear golden yellow in color, almost champagne like. Pours with 4 fingers of white dense head, which becomes less dense as it dissipates.  Smell. Wow, I can smell this 2 feet away from the glass. Lots of pine, and tropical fruit. So simple, yet so powerful.  Taste. Starts out with a piney bitterness. Floral hops accompany a nice sweetness, that leads into a dry fruitiness, with mango and citrus. Huge resinous bitterness is present throughout, but not so bitter as to become cloying. The finish is piney, again, with a lingering bitterness. Again, very champagne like.  Mouthfeel. Moderate syrupy body. Light carbonation, the only thing that differs from champagne.  This really lives up to its hype. This is my second time having it, and it remains the finest crafted DIPA I've had to date.

T - This journey treks back and forth through the palate starting with a bold grassy pine and a tiny sweet at the front and sides of the palate then off to a plethora of hops from floral, herbal, and citrus with mainly pine and grapefruit notes. More apple fruit to follow with a final game winning shot of smooth dry bitter finish with a touch of fiery alcohol.

Very well balanced taste that makes this beer very easy to drink.  mouthfeel - very satisfying and full, again not overly bitter or sweet, very well balanced  overall - I thought I was dreaming when I saw this on tap, I knew immediately I must try it or the chance may not come again for a very long time.

It's supposedly a double IPA, but in my opinion lacks the hoppiness to be even called a West Coast Style IPA, less that of a DIPA. The smell is reasonable, the taste is just ok. For the money and availability of this beer, the number of other beers outweigh any reason for me to enjoy this product. The color is nice, but that's hardly an achievement.

The brew is crystal clear and beautiful golden yellow in color. Good showing from the lacing as the brew is consumed, leaving behind a series of broken webs and some spotting.  Smell - The aroma hits on notes of citrus and pine with a but of stonefruit pit and a light cattiness.  Taste - Follows the nose. Pithy citrus character of orange and grapefruit, with lesser pine sitting beneath. Malts are buried, but hit on some faint, generic bready sweetness. Dry, stonefruit pit nuttiness in the finish, with lingering pith bitterness.  Mouthfeel - Medium in body with moderate carbonation. Decent smoothness with a crisp, dry finish.  Overall - High-time I re-reviewed this legendary brew. While its still great, it's hardly the most interesting DIPA on the market anymore. Many brewers have taken DIPA's to another level, both in flavor and in smoothness.

It was bottled on 2/6/12 so it's about as fresh as I'll ever get in MN. I expected a much larger aroma punch as I thought this was double dry hopped. Any who..not dissapointing at all.  taste - taste is great. It's balanced, with citrus up front and nice meduim body and sweetness from the malts in the middle. Finish's piney and bitter on the end but not as crazy bitter as expected.  mouthfeel - medium mouthfeel with a lowish level of carbonation  overall - This is about as perfectly balanced a DIPA as I've ever tasted. I was expecting over the top everything, and what I taste is extreme balance and consideration to blending of flavors. I'd drink this any time I could get my hands on it.

863,7971,Sudsanonymous,4.24,"I really enjoyed old Pliney. I love in the midwest so, it was a nice treat to get my hands on a couple of these... theyre rare. Fortunately, a buddy of mine sampled too many beers at cincybeerfest a couple weeks ago and decided I was in greater need than he, and gave me his last two bottles..  I Poured Pliney into a pint glass. This beer has a nice amber color with about a 1 inch head that didn't dissipate too quickly. Pliney has a fine citrus scent as IPA's should. This is a DIPA, however I felt it tasted more like an IPA. The flavor is right, but the hops aren't there for me to consider this a DIPA. Don't get me wrong, Pliney IS hoppy and I think Russian River has a nearly PERFECT beer here. I just think that Pliney is more in the neighborhood of an American IPA rather than a DIPA. Mouthfeel is great, the carbonation seemed a little low but, as I said this was a hand me down from a buddy that he got in a trade so, I don't know how long he had it. Either way its great. One of the best beers Ive had all year (I know its early, leave me alone!)

Earthy notes such as resin and spruce fronds. There's a decent amount of bitterness, and what feels like eating grapefruit, but not much grapefruit flavor. There is some very faint biscuit flavor just after drinking.  M: With the mouthfeel, the beer has good bitterness and carbonation, but it doesn't feel dry enough for my liking. Despite the wealth of hops, it is fortunately not a harshly bitter beer.  O: Overall I'm very pleased with this beer. Again, I wish it had a drier mouthfeel, but that is a more personal preference.

Great retention on a head that lasts for days.  S - Sweet tropical fruits of pineapple, grapefruit, and mango. Pine needles and sweet caramel. Less aggressive than I recall, but perhaps that's a good thing considering the amazing balance this beer displays. Surprised that it doesn't keep up with others that I love (Sculpin and Double Jack come to mind as have better aromas).  T - Talk about balance. I haven't had this in over a year, but I remember how well it balances hop with malt and various hop flavors with one another. Bitter hops, resinous pine, sweet caramel, sweet tropical fruits. Finish is a bready/grainy warming wonder. It has everything, and it it perfectly composed.  M - Mouthfeel is divine. Medium body, smooth with some crisp carbonation.Finishes a bit drier than it starts but only just the right amount.  O - Long live the king! That said, Pliny's dominance isn't nearly as clear to me as it was the first time I drank it. I've had many amazing beers, many of which are DIPAs, since I first drank this beer. I'll probably rank this highest, because it is in perfect balance and tastes incredible without overwhelming with hops (definitely still a hop monster, though!). This is a beer that I'd die to have easy, regular access to. It has a drinkability that these other world class IPAs (other than Double Sunshine) don't quite have.

The pure white head looks like a cloud that's been plucked straight from the sky, and this golden nectar tastes as if the beer god Osiris brewed it himself.  A - Before I even opened this beer I loved it. The odd shaped bottle, with the cool vintage looking label gives it a very west coast look. I poured this pretty vigorously into a plain pint glass. Has a perfect clear golden color with a hint of orange to it. Gorgeous pure white head, about 1 1/2 inches worth. The head is very airy with some huge bubbles.

Grapefruit, lemons, and some other tropical citrus upfront with an amount of very piney, earthy hops following it giving it a nice balance. Really no malt to speak of, this aroma is all about the hops  T - Hoptacular! Hoprageous! Hopsanity! All kinds of hops but they balance the beer very well. The piney more earthy hops give the more bitter, and citrusy hops a much better balance, and keeps it refreshing. The piney hops also do a great job hiding the 8% abv, no alcohol flavor what so ever.  M - Perfect carbonation gives this a very refreshing feel.

863,7971,JaredKent,4.9,"Appearance: The head pours a modest finger’s length, but has the residual power to stick around for the long haul. A nice, thin layer of foam sits atop the glass consistently through out the tasting. The color is a golden amber with a bit of an orange hue. Around 11 SRM  Scent: The aroma coming off this beer will fill your nose a hoppiness unmatched by most beers. I get a lot of floral notes and a bit of pine, probably from Simcoe. I dont get too much citrus the first time around. Underneath the hop aroma is a layer of malt that shines through just enough to make itself known. The malt isn’t the star player here, but it works wonderfully to bring the hops to the forefront.  Taste: The hoppiness once again shines through, not only providing a wonderful flavor, but providing a high level of bitterness you would expect from a Double IPA. The maltiness continues with the underlying flavor allowing just enough sweetness to balance the bitterness out a bit.  Mouthfeel: Although there is a strong bitterness, it is relatively smooth, making this a very drinkable 2xIPA. The body falls into that medium range, not too heavy. Carbonation works perfectly to bring the flavors right up front on your palate.  Overall: It was definitely worth getting my hands on and trying. I’ll be honest though, this is a very good IPA, but I don’t think it’s mind-blowing. It does everything right and I don’t think it has any flaws, which makes it a fantastic beer, but the hype surrounding it almost leads you to expect a life changing experience. I recommend everyone try it if they can get a hold of some. It is very good. Just take the hype with a grain of salt.",Russian River Brewing Company,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,100

863,7971,rmcnealy,4.07,"Finally got ahold of one of these from a great West Coast BA'er. Thanks Matt!  Served chilled in a snifter. Poured a medium amber that was only slightly translucent and appeared to be totally filtered. Produced a froathy head that was tightly laced and didn't flee overly fast eventually ending up as a choppy, inconsistent layer on top. The smells are of beautiful, fresh hops. Citrus everywhere! The dry, bitter kinds... grapefruit and tangerines. No malts in sight. Smells are great. The tastes mirror the smells with that great citrus hop. It isn't very bitter, however. Extremely crisp and smooth. Unlike many other dIPA's. I'm having mixed emotions on the taste/mouthfeel. Having been on a steady diet of Hopslam and recently trying Heady Topper, I think it's just missing a little bitter bite at the end. 8% abv is on the low end for dIPA's so perhaps this has something to do with it. Very good, otherwise. The smells and front hop note tastes are great. I'm glad I had the opportunity to try this one and am looking forward to eventually trying Younger. This is my first Russian River offering and a definite thumbs up!  Enjoy!",Russian River Brewing Company,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,100
863,7971,cps98,4.7,"Well after a long wait I finally got my hands on a fresh Pliny. Bottle date is 1/16/12 and I drank it last night on 2/15/12. Poured into a tasting glass.  A – Pours a really nice, clear autumn yellow. A really nice 1 finger head was seen but dissipated rated quickly to a ring of bubbles around the edge of the glass.  S – The dominant smells I get are pine, and citrus mainly grapefruit. I get no malty sweetness at all.  T – The hops are up front but not over powering like other DIPA’s I’ve had. Everything works together very nicely in this beer. There was some citrus but the malt was well hidden by the hop flavors.  M – Super smooth, really nice carbonation added to that tingle on the tongue. I would put it between full and medium bodied.  O – I was really amped up to try and this beer and am super grateful I got a chance. I was really impressed at how smooth the beer was for the over the top IBU’s. Wish I lived out west so I could drink this guy all the time but unfortunately it will just have to be one of those surprises every now and then.",Russian River Brewing Company,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,100
863,7971,MBrausen,4.3,"Reviewed from notes. Poured from a bottle into a CBS snifter.  A. Pours a cherry orange, nice one finger head, rests at some nice bubbles and a thick ring, very nice lacing on the glass.  S. Smells of sweet orange, pine and light grape fruit, and some white grapes. Very sweet smelling.  T. Tastes of smooth citrus, mild grapefruit, a warm tangy finish that I can't quite describe.  M. Medium heavy body, large feeling, a little creamy, medium carbonation, slightly dry finish.  O. A pretty good beer. Sweet with some nice flavors, a bigger feeling IPA. I think this is much over hyped. Just not the mind blowing beer all the ratings pitch it to be. A great beer for the $6 you pay for it on the West coast, but not worth trading a fortune for. Glad I tried it, but I won't likely search it out in the future.",Russian River Brewing Company,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,100
863,7971,BeerFiend2002,5,"Poured from pint bottle into chalice  A- Apricot color body with a big pillowy two and a half finger, white head. Love that shade.  S- Smell is powerful but awesome. At about 20"" away even after just opening the cap, I was still getting the hop aroma smacking in the face. Grapefruit, citrus, floral, pine, and some of the malt. A lot going on in there.  T- Hop bitterness, pine and grapefruit up front are quickly followed by a sweet malty citrus that just overtakes it mid-pallate and gives way to a piney bitterness on the back end. The taste is so clean. I'm blown away.  M- It is medium-bodied and has a juicy feel in the mouth. This drinks like a single and would not have known it was a double unless I never found that out before. It is so smooth and it just glides effortlessly across the pallate as it finishes with that crisp, dry finish that I love in a West Coast IPA. The dryness begs you to keep sipping, but it is oddly so so quenching.  O- I can see how this beer generates so much hype and has such a cult-like following. Its hopped to insanity, aromatic, delicious, and with an amazing feel. It even looks appetizing. This beer is simply an all-out sensory assault. It also is incredibly balanced and offers high drinkability. Basically, its what every west coast IPA should aspire to be. I can nitpick at times, but this beer is perfect. Hopslam was my favorite IPA, but Pliny wins in a landslide and if I could give it a 6 I would. A thanks goes out to my brother's girlfriend for bringing me back a bottle from vacation in San Diego. I hope I am lucky enough to revisit this one sooner than later.",Russian River Brewing Company,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,100
863,7971,output01x,4.35,"Poured from a 500 mL. capped bottle (Bottled On 011612) into a snifter glass.  An aggressive pour yields a 2-finger off-white head that dissipates after a couple minutes to a thick, clumpy dusting and thick foam ring. The body is a clear golden amber with just a few rising carbonation bubbles. Some thick lacing can be seen clinging to the glass in splotches throughout consumption.  Pine and citrus aromas come together very nicely in the nose. Notes of tangerine and grapefruit are most obvious along with just a hint of bready malt in the background.  Mellow citrus flavors sit on the tongue at first sip with notes of tangerine and orange cream. Upon swallowing, a piny bitterness quickly sets in but is rushed away by flavors of sweet citrus and grainy malts. Then, as these fade, the piny bitterness reemerges and sticks around until the next sip. The bitterness is rather tame compared to some other DIPAs. However, this beer is not supposed to be a ruin-your-taste-buds hop bomb, but is supposed to be well-balanced - which I believe it accomplishes rather well.  Medium bodied with moderate carbonation, this beer is fantastically drinkable for an 8%. The body is smooth and easily drinkable. The carbonation is slightly fizzy when the beer is held in the mouth but does not detract from either the impact of the flavors nor the drinking experience.",Russian River Brewing Company,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,100
863,7971,thecheapies,4.38,"Pliny! Thanks to whitefire. First time around on this one. Bottled 01/26/12.  Snifter glass for the pour. Beautifully clear tangerine/honey color with a bone-colored head of two and a half fingers. Holding strong, too. Patches clinging to the glass.  Mango, juicy orange, cantaloupe, and big leafy hops. Not getting a hint of extreme bitterness, but we'll see.  Huge bitterness upfront with lovely citrus notes. Oily hops leave a slick residue in the mouth. Melon, clementines, and a strange nuance of pickled fruit. The finish lasts a long time; bitter and evolving. Sickly smooth, drinks like an regular-strength IPA with amazing complexity. Rigorously dry middle with some of the sugars pulling through at the end. Letting it warm up brings out some lemon and lime.  Mouthfeel is crisp and clean. Let the 8.0% catch up with you, because there's no other choice. Medium body with medium fizz. Any slicker, and it'd be perfect.  World-class smoothness and complexity. Totally worth dealing for.",Russian River Brewing Company,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,100
863,7971,kagent777,4.9,"Bottled on 01-03-12, about six weeks old poured into my beer goblet. I wish I could get this local, but I understand that Utah would destroy this beer by storing it at room temperature for weeks before it made its way to room temperature stores. So I bought it in Denver this weekend and brought it home. I have wanted to try this for a long time.  Appearance: A very nice light golden with a slight haze, I suspect from the yeast. The head was one finger thick and white and left lacing as it went.  Smell: Pine and citric hops. A malt back bone that can be smelled as well. A touch of alcohol.  Taste: This would be bitter to someone who did not know what to expect. I, on the other hand, do not think that this is out of balance at all. The biscuit maltiness stands up to the bitterness of the hops. The pine tastes are noticed on the front end and then the citrus notes show up at the back. The beer has a little sweetness at the front and then dries out during the long finish.  Mouthfeel: Middle to heavy on the body with perfect balancing carbonation.  Overall: I am happy to have had this. It can easily define the DIPA style for me , as well as many others. That being said, there are many DIPAs that are equally as good, but maybe without the pedigree. I will have a hard time obtaining this in Utah, until I travel some more. I will not seek this out until I travel because we have a few in Utah that are only right behind Pliny, IMHO.",Russian River Brewing Company,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,100
863,7971,ThickNStout,4.42,"500mL bottle (thanks to BeerSociety for the trade!). Bottled 1/16/12. Served in a Southern Tier snifter.   Pours sparkling amber with a fine 2 finger near white head. Nice lacing as it goes down.   What a delightful bouquet of floral and citris goodness. There's orange, grapefruit and a little pine.   The taste is a fantastic blend of hops. Grapefruit, oranges, sweet bread. Bitter and sweet, it goes down smooth with a long pleasant aftertaste of hops. Never any hint of alcohol.   Body is much lighter and less resinous than I expect from a DIPA, with a fine light carbonation. It's perfect for a standard IPA but just too thin to put in the same catagory as other big DIPAs.   Pliny the Elder is an excellent hoppy drinking experience. Overall this is by far the best IPA I've ever had. But, oh wait, they call it a double. At 8%, it's less than 1/2-1% more booze than most IPAs and it's just too thin without a big malty backbone to take solidly into double territory. It IS really good but like most hyped beer it just can't live up to the ""best beer ever"" that we all read about. I'll never turn it down but I certainly won't go out of my way to trade for it again.",Russian River Brewing Company,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,100

863,7971,kotayk,4.84,"Here we go – Pliny the Elder – a benchmark DIPA that every nuevo beer geek name drops (Yes we know – you knew Vinnie, back from his Korbel days)  If you are on the east coast – fugetaboutit – you are not gona get it unless you are in PA, which for some strange reason RR distributes to, or trade. Even on the west coast its fairly hard to come by. You have to be in the know – you have to speak in tongues to cheese monger at whole foods – or be in the know at certain bottle shops  So …does it live up to the hype, does it deserve to be in the beer hall of fame.  Cracked a bottle - dated 1/16/2012 – poured into a tulip About a finger and half of off white cream colored head – that dissipates fairy quickly – not surprised at 8%abv. Color is a very nice, perfectly clear (a first I might add for me – usually there is a hop haze) golden color The nose – wow – text book west coast DIPA – citrus, pine, mango, but also malts. A great looking and smelling west coast DIPA.  The tastes follows the nose, initial bitterness which is telling you that I’m a DIPA but its quickly counterbalanced by the malts and tropical fruits – ends dry and leaves your palate wanting more  I can not emphasize how balanced this beer is – perfect carbonation, medium bodied, it hides the IBU’s (listed at a 100) and the EtOH so well.

T-The hops are in charge upfront and in the finish. Really heavy on the pine needle and sap character. Some fresh grass here too. Some malt in the middle but is quickly dominated by more hops. Finish is long and definitely bitter.  M-Is a bit pine sappy and sticks to the palate with resiny bitterness. It actually starts making my mouth water after putting a few ounces down. Plenty of lively carbonation there as well. Alcohol is non existant-well done at 8%.  O-This is a must for hop heads-definitely leans heavy on the pine tree type hop flavor. I prefer more of a tropical hop bite versus this resiny pine tree style. If you like your bitter receptors pounded into oblivion this is a great beer for you.

Finishes with intense bitterness but not the clean light bitterness you see sometimes. Not much malt action going on here, some alcohol in the taste. Did I mention that this beer is absurdly hoppy? Mouthfeel is medium-heavy and somewhat syrupy. So hoppy that there is some mouth puckering and a dry finish.  This is a very intense DIPA, the most intense I've had after Greenflash DIPA (mostly due to its earthy cannabis notes). One of the best DIPAs I've had but not the best, that may fall to Burton Baton. For someone not on the west coast this is the holy grail of beer, partially due to the fact it is nearly impossible to get.

863,7971,pcents,3.94,"Got a couple bottles of it and I can say I was a little disappointing for such a critically acclaimed beer. It had a beautiful golden, slightly brown appearance. Lacing seemed to be lacking on the glass the first bottle but the second it stuck on very well, though I was using a wine glass since I was at a friends house. I also was not able to pick up much of an aroma and I was not the only person of the group to feel this way. While it does emit a citrusy and slighyt sweet aroma I feel it should have been a little more pungent. Also I found it to lack the hoppiness I would expect to find in an Imperial IPA. It is a little bitter and has a light mouthfeel. I really did enjoy the beer and would definitively drink it again, in about 5 minutes when I open up another. bottle 11-6-11 and drank on 1-29-12",Russian River Brewing Company,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,100

A: golden orange body with a cloudy swirl of hop resin and thick fluffy white finger and a half white head that leaves a beautiful lace along the sides of the glass. Head stays throughout the beer until last sip. Impressive! S: initial smell was a HUGE hit of pine and tropical hops then more of a focus on the citrus notes. Some sweet malt escapes at the end T: explosions of tropical and citrus that is sweet yet bitter then back to sweet. Interesting how the beer is taking my tongue on a rollercoaster like this. M: smooth light body with a moderate amount of carbonation O: good dipa but didn't live up to the hype for me.

Head retention is good. Lacing is decent, spotty but easily rendered.  S: Lots of tropical hops, but balanced by a distinct resin quality. I get pineapple, grapefruit, and orange zest. But all of this bright, sweet flavors balance against a bitterness that smells of fresh pine needles. Very distinct and very delicious smelling.  T: Bitter pine, caramel malt, and citrus zest on the finish. Pretty malt heavy. Drink smooth and sweet, but would have enjoyed more hop presence.  M: Very well balanced. Flavors are well-integrated and carbonation is spot on. None of the flavors really overwhelm, though I have had more hop forward beers.  O: Definitely a solid DIPA here. Distinctive if only for the nice blend of sweet citrus and bitter resin. Flavor profile is very smooth and balanced. But there are better IPAs and DIPAs out there.

I just realized I hadn't review Pliny yet!  Poured from bottle dated 12/28/10 to Sam Adams perfect pint glass. Perfect sized glass for the whole bottle and really presents the beer and aroma well.  A - The beer pours a clear gold/orange color with some excellent gold color highlights. 2.5 finger soapy bubbly white head which lasts well and has good lacing.  S - Wow! Overpowering aroma present almost immediately. I poured the beer in the corner of the kitchen and it really filled the whole area with huge bold hoppy fruity sweet aroma. Nice citrus, pineapple, resinous piny, floral, and sweet hops tones. By far the most pungent beer I've had. Really one of the highpoints of this beer.  T/M - Very similar to the aroms the palette is assaulted with huge hoppy flavors - though not overpowering like a Ruination or anything, it's very flavorful and complex yet refined and smooth. The beer presents itself with the citrus, pineapple, resinous piny, floral, and sweet hop flavors while combining a mild malty tone. The beer starts bright and crisp and then transitions to a more bitter flavor with a light alcohol warmth and finishes incredibly clean. The mouthfeel is just about perfect for the style and perfectly cabonated.  D - The most drinkable IIPA I've ever had.  Overall, it's a pleasure every time I get to enjoy a Pliny. I was speaking to a fellow beer buddy about the idea that perhaps this beer is rated so high and we enjoy it so much beciase we might only get it eveyr month or two. That may be a little of the appeal but after sampling compared to a local IIPA and another highly rated IIPA Pliny really is, in my opinion, worthy of the reverance. Highly, highly recommended.

The hops are definitely strong, but is balanced out by just enough sweet maltiness. Very complex overall.  M - Crisp, thin, very drinkable.  O - Surprisingly easy to drink.

It has a beautiful amber golden color that allows light to pass through it. Nice light white head that sticks to the glass. The smell is great. I get very piney hops and citrus. I am guessing the pineyness comes from the Columbus or Chinook hop. The taste is bitter but well-balanced with the malt, as you would expect. The piney resin comes through but also that piney bitterness seems to be balanced with the citrus notes. I don't believe I have had a hoppy beer taste like that before or at least I've never noticed it. The 8% is hidden masterfully. For me though, the mouthfeel is what really impresses me most. This beer is so light compared to other DIPA's and finishes dry. The sip you take leaves you and you want another one right away.

863,7971,NODAK,4.8,"Sharply hoppy aroma on this one...a fight between grapefruits and floral notes going back and forth. Seems to be a solid mix between the two. Very nice.  Pours dark golden in my glass with a big, fluffy head. Very good.  In the taste, they've really achieved a really nice balance between the citrus and pine notes in the hops. The pine may be a little more predominant, but not by much. Some DIPA's are ridiculously bitter, some are sweet and boozy, and some are pretty balanced. This one definitely is on the hoppy side but it's a comfortable, tasty bitterness from beginning to end. Very balanced. From the sip to the finish, there's no doubt that the hops rule this beer (as a beer should that's named after the person who discovered hops), and it's really well done. Malt wise, there really isn't much. I do detect a little peppery biscuit underneath the grapefruit and pine notes, but it's where it should be....the background. Another thing I like is that there isn't a lingering aspirin bitterness here; it's a clean finish with a resinous bitterness to it. It's refreshing. That's how it should be. And the booze is covered up.  One of the best, if not the best, DIPA's that I've had.

A dry, piney flavor with slight bitterness from the hops, with just enough sweet citrus pineapple flavor to balance it out. Love the dry finish.  M: Really crisp carbonation.

Smell: Definitely smell the piney hops right away and detect some more subtle floral aromas as well. Made me very excited for the first taste.  Taste: First impression is that this beer isn't as hop heavy as one would think. That said, Pliny bursts with incredible flavor that starts with very fresh piney and citrus hops and a subtle malt sweetness . The piney and citrus hops are there, but for a DIPA, this is something that I think the admittedly non-hopheads of the world will enjoy. It might just be a perfectly balanced American Double.  Mouthfeel: Medium mouthfeel with just the right amount of carbonation. Drinks very, very easily.  Overall: Although the relative inaccessibility of Pliny contributes to its legend, there is no doubt that this beer lived up to much of the hype.

Thanks to Brian H. who brought a bottle of this baby back from its homeland in Northern Cali.  Poured from a 500 ml (16 oz.) bottle into a tulip glass. Freshness date on bottle reads “12/15/2011″. (Consumed on January 4th, 2012).  Appearance: This beer pours a golden straw color, crisp clear and transparent. A few light carbonation bubbles float in the body. White lacing thinly traces the rim of the beer after a medium strength pour. The brew leaves behind a sticky white lacing. 4.5  Smell: West coast hops lead all the way, as expected. Light, bright citrus and floral aromas waft into my slightly stuffy nose. Orange, grapefruit and some pine are the predominant aromas. I wonder how amazing this would smell right out of the brewpub taps. 4  Taste: Magnificent blend of juicy citrus hops and a sweet malt comprises the taste. Juicy orange, bitter grapefruit, floral and sappy pine flood my tongue. A sweet carmel malt provides a nice backbone to the hops. The balance of malts and hops is perfect. Very hop forward as a west coast IPA should be. Dryness and mild grapefruit bitterness lingers in the aftertaste and draws one back for another sip. Citrus flavors open up even more with the beer’s warming. Doesn’t get better. 5  Mouthfeel: Pretty light for a double IPA, and consequently very drinkable. A tad sticky from the hops. Mild carbonation and bitterness. 4.25  Overall: This was a surprise appearance for the night, but I couldn’t let it go another day in order to enjoy as fresh as possible. Of course I was more than happy to enjoy this much talked about brew, and enjoy it I did!

863,7971,jegross2,4.77,"Reviewing the infamous Pliny the Elder from Russian River Brewing Company. This is universally hailed as one of the top ten beers in the world by beer connoisseurs and is only sold in California. This is my first experience with the brew and the brewery. Thank you BeerAdvocate user LieutenantSours for hooking me up with this one!  Score: 97  Bottled 12/15/11, served in a brandy snifter glass, and enjoyed 01/09/12.  Appearance: Pours a gorgeous, ""bright"" and transparent honey-orange color with one and a half to two fingers of frothy off-white head that settles into a quarter finger layer. Excellent lacing sticks to the side of the glass. 5/5  Smell: Bright, zesty citrus. Not as in-your-face citrus as Heady Topper or Zombie Dust, but still a really fresh tropical fruit aroma. Tons of orange, grapefruit, lemon, mango and a fresh piney hoppiness. A little floral too, with a scent of freshly cut grass. Getting some smooth maltiness in the aroma with deeper whiffs. 4.75/5  Taste: My first impression is that the beer is a lot less hoppy than anticipated given the citrus/pine hop aromas and imperial IPA label. Flavor is a very smooth, malty citrus throughout without much bitter hop bite. Malty sweet citrus on the mid-palate. Finishes with a prickley pop of citrus/pine hops flavor on the tongue. Definitely tasting some fresh pine/grass flavors before the finish too, but they are more ""complementary"" to the flavor profile than most imperial IPAs that I have had in the past. This bottle is nearly a month old and I hear this is one that is optimally consumed within three weeks of the bottled on date, so perhaps some of the beer's hoppiness or intensity has faded. Once I get over the ""it's nothing like Surly Abrasive"" expectations gap, however, I find myself really appreciating the nuance this brew has to offer. Few imperial IPAs strive for this kind of drinkability and flavor balance, aiming for the aggressive. The beer gradually grows more zesty, bitter and hoppy as it layers too, closing that initial expectations gap. I am finding myself enjoying this brew more and more as the amount of beer in the glass dwindles. 4.75/5  Mouthfeel: Medium-plus bodied with medium carbonation. The carbonation in the beer is just enough to make the hops flavors ""pop"" on the tongue without leaving the beer too crisp. Finishes dry and bitter. 4.75/5  Overall: While I can't say that this is the best imperial IPA that I have had to date (that honor belongs to Surly Abrasive Ale), this is nonetheless a fantastic brew. Russian River pioneered the imperial IPA, and Pliny the Elder is still one of the top of the style.  Recommendation: An absolute must try imperial IPA.  Pairings: Hamburgers.  Cost: $7.99 for a 500 ml bottle",Russian River Brewing Company,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,100
863,7971,StoryOfTheGhost,4.18,"Nice orange color with a beautiful white head  Smell is terrific. One of the piniest smelling beers I have ever smelled. Citrus, but not as citrussy as I expected. It just smells very fresh.  Taste is just like smell. Piney at the forefront. Citrus. Not as bitter as I would like. Great tasting beer. I think that I hyped it up too much in my mind prior to tasting it, and had too high of expectations. So, I was a bit disappointed, but it was no fault of the beer itself. It really is a terrific beer.  Mouthfeel- It has a nice carbonation, and you can feel the hop oils on the tongue and teeth. Taste does not stay with you as long as I had hoped.",Russian River Brewing Company,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,100
863,7971,Souleman,4.82,"This has got to be one of my favorite beers of all time. I first tasted it at the brewery in Russian River land (after visiting a farm where we picked fresh hops). The place was packed, they had a ton of beers on tap, but I went straight for the Pliney. The aroma was identical to the fresh hops we had picked and was blown away after tasting it. Looks and smells are beautiful, and the taste is untouchable. Nice balance of hoppiness and spice that really puts this beer above the lot in the Imperial category. I recently did a tasting and went through at least 5 different IPA's that I had liked in the past. I got to the Pliney at last and it hit the marks on every level. Still one of the greats in my book.",Russian River Brewing Company,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,100
863,7971,phisigben,4.54,"The color is pretty standard but what stands out is the nice fluffy white head, its about 2 fingers width and lingers for a while then it leaves very nice lacing with each drink. This is one of the best smelling beers I have ever had absolutely huge piney aroma that smacks you in he face then a hint of some citrus. Taste follows the nose perfectly huge pine flavor right off the bat then some citrus and finally just a touch of sweetness from the malt. I wish there was a touch more sweetness to this but still its pretty outstanding. Mouthful is good for me its thin compared to other DIPA beers that are out there, and the carbonation is on point. This is a great beer I wished we could get some in Indiana at a price point of about $5 for a little over a pint I think this would be a great once a week beer to grab off the shelve if you could.",Russian River Brewing Company,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,100

Appearance - Rather unremarkable color, though a nice head formed with good retention.  Smell - Fantastic aroma from this beer. Can't wait for a taste.  Taste - Very complex hop profile. Not too bitter up front, but definitely leaves a bitter aftertaste. Very well balanced with the malts, but just a hair too bitter on the back end for my taste.  Mouthfeel - Nicely carbonated, medium body. Perfect feel for a IIPA.  Overall - This is an outstanding beer, and I'm glad I was able to find a bottle in CO.

A: Impressive 2+ finger white eggshell head forms, slowly dropping to a ring around the glass and a thin residual head that sticks around. The lacing left behind after each sip is beautiful. Excellent presentation.  S: Hops! Pine, grass and grapefruit dominate the nose. Piney bitterness more noticeable early, slowly the grapefruit takes over as the beer warms. A little alcohol.  T: A great balance between piney, dry hoppiness and grapefruit flavors. Sweet malts.  M: Thick and smooth but not syrupy. Good carbonation. A little residual hop stickiness but not a whole lot for a DIPA. 4  O: I really enjoyed PTE, but it didn't have the wow factor that I get from Heady Topper, Abner and other HF DIPAs.

863,7971,Netdigger2,3.64,"Very fresh bottle acquired in a trade, reviewed from notes.  It pours a hazy yellow orange with lots of white head and heavy lacing.  The smell is pine, citrus, and caramel wound together. The effervesence died as time passed.  The taste was pine, citrus fruit, a bit of light crystal or Maris Otter malt sweetness and some floral remnants on the palate.  Mouthfeel was good, it washed off the palate quickly and had medium carbonation.  With as much of a hop bill as this beer has, my guess is that everything is put in the last 15 minutes of the boil or so. I, disappointedly, did not get any of the enjoyable bruising bitterness indicative of a 250 calculated ibu beer.

863,7971,natemort13,4.97,"Pours a solidly beautiful orange with a slightly off white head.  The aroma is brilliant. Bright pine on the nose complemented perfectly by a floral citrus background. It's the perfectly balanced aroma for me that brings out all the major characteristics of an ipa. Grapefruit, pine,  Bitter attack with an undercurrent of spicy pine. I get some orangey notes as well. Finish is dry. There's also an oily hoppy character to the finish that lingers. I made my brother my brother (usually a bud light drinker) try modus hoperandi once, he said it was like drinking hops, this is similar but its got a complementary maltiness that stands up well to the deep hoppiness.  Mouthfeel is full bodied, stands up well to the hoppy assertiveness of this beer. Any less body and the hops would totally overwhelm. Instead, the body makes this ipa practically ideal.    So I'm really missing Michigan brews in California, but goddamn this guy really helps me get through the homestatebeersickness. Definitely gonna make a trip up for the Younger in February, don't really know how to improve on the elder but I guess if anyone can do it it's gotta be RR.",Russian River Brewing Company,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,100

863,7971,Bouleboubier,4.43,"first had this in PA 3 years ago - struck me as unique: light gold in color, very crisp, very dry, like hopped champagne... fast forward to recently - second and third times trying it: at Monk's Cafe in Philly and at Russian River 3 weeks later - both tasted virtually identical yet quite different from that first time - could've been a hoax, although they had 3 other RR beers that first day which all matched up in later tastings.... anyway.... my thoughts on the recent sips....  A: suntanned orange-peel hue, faint turbid hop haze, looks unfiltered...thick pad of dense, cottony foam, decent cling in broad bands  S: fragrant dried orange peel, orange creme, maybe papaya muddled with mint, fresh cut flowers.... mostly hops.... the esters and alcohol are either absent or woven well within... malt does seem to come in later as a bit angel-food-cakey, but mellow  T: solid, bold, yet smooth flavors, but nothing unique.... just a tight construct that is memorable for just that - the flavors stand out, have more of a refined definition than most contemporaries, not a mess.... the spicy-orange-y hops, just the right balance of pungency and bitterness, neither really aggressive... the alcohol, mellow and far in the background, no heat or even that much warmth.... I happen to be a malt fiend, yet I'm perfectly at ease with the sugar-cookie malt just quiet and in excellent balance, just along for the ride, no syrupy or sweet sugary flavors  M: not as dry as the first time (man, was that wonderful!) - in fact, this came off with a more rounded malt body, though still pretty damn pillowy/feathery.... this just had a faded wash while the other one snapped off taking some saliva with it... really, it curious how a lot of breweries just don't understand that this style needs to be nearly crazy dry.... they do well here  O: I'm sure it was a revelation back in the day, but I can't help but feel I've had more interesting, (personally) enjoyable double IPAs.... on its own though, it's an indisputably solidly-rendered strong hoppy beer.... I'd definitely put it up there with the best and feel inclined to re-test it again and again to further shape my opinion (Bbb, May 2013)",Russian River Brewing Company,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,100
863,7971,BreworFerment,3.9,I just don't get the hype. There are plenty of other IPA's out there that I would rather drink. I wouldn't turn it down but having a choice I'd try something else.

863,7971,Bobheed,4.83,"A: Shimmering golden, with a crisp whit head, exactly the way an IPA should look. Picturesque  S: Lots of astringency, got some grapefruit in there as well as an overwhelming pine hoppiness. Absolute hops through and through  T: Just about perfect. A true west coast hop bomb. Lots of fruitiness to it, put the piny hop characteristics as well. The Simcoe hops seem to be most prevalent, and I'm okay with that. Well balanced in being both very intense, but very smooth and enjoyable.  M: Nice medium consistency, good carbonation, and the intense hop characteristics played well off of that.  Overall, this is one of the best beers out there. It's a regular for me when I can get it, and this is an IPA everybody should try.

S- A hop bomb as you'd expect. Tons of pine, citrus, grapefruit aromas.  T- Tastes like it smells. Very citrusy and bitter. Awesome.  M- Light and easy to drink.

S: Subtle fruits are present, mostly pears and apples, with a little bit of grassy hops thrown in for good measure. The solid caramel malt backbone is well integrated.  T: Malty body with some subtle citrus type fruits. Follows the nose pretty well. There are some herbal/grassy qualities as well.  M: Off the charts drinkability. I can drink this like water. It's so smooth, just the right carbonation level to keep you interested. Buttery mouth feel.  O: Well it's not a game changer by any stretch of the imagination, but it's insanely drinkable.

Carbonation appears healthy and strong.  Floral hops upfront followed by piney, bittering hops. Plenty of sticky sweetness and resiny bitterness. Simply stunning balance. Citrus and tropical aromas intertwine throughout.  Grapefruit, pineapple and pine resin burst on the palate. Piney hops and resin are backed by a subtle honey sweetness. Good bitterness and depth. A well-balanced and flat out delicious flavor profile.  Soft and silky mouthfeel with some creaminess. Medium bodied and appropriately carbonated. Smooth and easy to drink. Finishes with a slight alcohol burn that slightly hinders the drinkability.  Pliny certainly lives up to its high praise. One of the more balanced and spectacular hop profiles that I've tasted in a beer. Just make sure to drink it as fresh as possible to get the optimal drinking experiences that this beer affords.

The bottle I had was perfectly carbonated with a marshmallow fluff white foam head and bubbles that rise throughout entire consumption.  The aroma of this brew is unmatched. So many layers: grapefruit, lemon, orange. Not one ounce of sour in this smell. Literally can smell it from across the table.  Flavor is balance of caramel/toffee with citrus and grapefruit. Slightest hint of cherry as the beer flavor lingers. No alcohol character, which is how a 8% IPA can be, but seldom is. Carbonation is plentiful, but not overwhelming.  When you put your mind to it, a great product can be created. Russian River is committed to making outstanding brews. Pliny the Elder is a testament to that commitment.

I can't add much more than what's already been said; this is a great benchmark for what an American IPA should be. The smell, taste, and feel of this beer are all outstanding. The first time I tried it, I described it as tasting a bit like a forest. A lot of earthy hops balanced with a nice malt background give it a complex flavor. It's very smooth and inviting, and you definitely don't taste the alcohol, which at 8% can catch up to you quickly.  The craft beer scene has put out a lot of good IPAs recently; I would say some even surpass Pliny, but this beer will always be the standard by which those other beers are judged by.

DIPA's are usually not my first choice of beers, so the fact that I'm rating this at the level I am, certainly says something. It is one of the best looking beers around. That golden honey coloration with the orangish tinge creates a prism like quality. The citrus nose changes as it warms, with a floral undertone emerging. Taste is spectacular and the expected bite just isn't there. It smooth, clean and damn near perfect.

A healthy one inch pillow of creamy white head forms & lingers. The beer is crystal clear, no haze, and is a honey amber color.  S: Potent hops aromas are of tropical fruits mostly. Scents range from pine needles, pear, apple, pineapple, and grapefruit.  T: Initial clean bitter hop bite, but much less bitter then expected given the smell. Flavor notes of hop oils, medium caramel malt, toast & a smooth faintly dry finish.  M: Light to medium carbonation, oily, and a touch of lingering faint dry bitterness.  O: Excellent DIPA.

Leaves full rings of froth.  Smell is nice and balanced, but just maybe the hops win. HA, just kidding. There are hops everywhere in it. sticky pine hop resin and oranje juice concentrate. Malt is sticky and sweet, like honey. Hops also have slightly hearty herbal feel.  I really like the balance in the taste. Yes there are some nice and strong pine and citric hops, but there is a very nice balance from the malt. Its slick and sweet. Like runny honey. Initial hop tastes are bittering and resinous. Upon exhale, the nice floraly herbal hops leave a nice feeling, almost light like tea.  Surprisingly light body. I still just cant get over the nice full hop cone; the herbal, leafy notes are what set this apart from all the other DIPAs. It makes it feel light, while still carrying some serious weight. Those hops are showcased front and center, built on a pedestal of sweet, slick malt.

This shit glows. Not much of a head--which is really the only chink in The Elder's armor, if it's even that--with some residual puddles randomly residing across a viscous, nectar surface. Spiderweb lacing makes up for the lack of much head. A gorgeous beer.  S: And it begins...The nose explodes with ruby red grapefruit, floral aromas, tropical notes, just loaded with fruity esters. An underlying sweetness ties it all together in one of the most complex and mind-blowing noses I've ever experienced. Perfect.  T: And it continues...Wonderfully hop forward, with conspicuous grapefruit character, additional citrus notes (lemon, lime, oranges), loads of pine needles, and an underlying sweetness. Not as great as the nose but still excellent.  M: Prickly hops, of course, some mild warmth from the alcohol, and some light carbonation. Nice syrupy body.

863,7971,starrdogg,4.12,"Big thanks to locke459 for sending this along as an extra. I've had Pliny several times before, but have never gotten around to reviewing it. Consumed alongside Heady Topper for no particular reason.  The beer pours a clear yellow/gold with a white head. Smell is awesome, it's both grassy and citrusy and is quite strong, definitely the best part of the beer. Taste is a bit of a let-down after such a great smell. It's hoppy, that I can definitely say about it, but unfortunately, this beer is a bit one-dimensional. It's not particularly sweet or citrusy, and the bitterness definitely comes out here, especially when compared to Heady Topper which is so smooth and easy to drink. Mouthfeel is medium-bodied, nothing particularly exciting or bad to say here.  Overall, as I've said many times, Pliny's not a bad beer, and if I had regular access to it, I'd probably drink it all the time. However, for me, a huge DIPA fan, this beer has always been a bit of a disappointment. I just don't understand the massive hype it gets, and when drinking it next to Heady Topper, it really pales in comparison. I'll always gladly drink Pliny, but the days of going out of my way for it are long gone.",Russian River Brewing Company,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,100
863,7971,Flounder57,4.85,"I had this on draft at the Falling Rock Tap House in Denver yesterday. it has been since the '10 EBF since I have had it.  Appearance: one inch head, amber golden yellow, carbonation looks great, and there was nice lacing on the glass all the way down.  Smell: citrus, grapefruit, tangerine, some pine, and toffee and caramel notes from the malt.  Taste: all the scents above blended nicely. The bitternessblends very well with the sweet malts.  Mouthfeel: medium carbonation, smooth, medium bodied, very easy to drink, delicious, and a little chewy.  Overall: This beer is as good as I remember it from almost two years ago. Extremely happy I was able to find it here in Denver. Might have to go back to Falling Rock to get another.",Russian River Brewing Company,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,100

863,7971,sukwonee,4.8,"After my 3rd bottle of this beer (at three different occasions), I finally get to review this. Poured it into a tulip glass  This is definitely my favorite double IPA. It looks, tastes, smells, and feels good. Long lasting hops, fruits, a bit of bitters at the end... so so good... 8.0% alcohol content is well hidden... very well balanced. a bit lighter body than I expected though.  I will be seeking for more of this in the near future for sure!",Russian River Brewing Company,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,100
863,7971,Tearik,5,"A: Poured a pale golden - orange color. Got a perfect amount of head resting on top, that had no intention of going away. Fair amount of lacing as you empty your glass.  S: Smells extremely hoppy, with a followup of citrus.  T: ||Not even close to as bitter as I expected from a double IPA, very very smooth and easy to drink. Honestly if there is one thing this brew could benefit from it would be a hint more bitterness. Its pretty fruit forward (to borrow a term from my wino friends) and you can really taste the malt.  M: Very light on the mouth. Doesn't make you feel like you're trying to chug syrup. Easily the creamiest/lightest IPA I've had to date.  O: If I had easy access to this brew and the funds to do so, it would be my one and only. I was so excited when I finally got my bottle, and I was in no way disappointed, I can not wait to get more.

863,7971,tylerprince,4.47,"On tap at the Falling Rock Taphouse in Denver.  A: Clear golden amber. White two-finger head resolves quickly but leaves an excellent lacing.  S: Hop oils, grassy, with some floral and fruity undertones. Hints of grapefruit, pine, citrus. Nowhere near as strong or as citrusy as the Heady Topper, but still excellent.  T: Just like it smells. Starts off bitter with hop oils, grassy, fruity undertones, pine; finishes off crisp with a bit more malt. Alcohol is well masked.  M: Crisp, with perfect carbonation. Incredibly drinkable. Bitterness doesn't linger much.  O: I wouldn't say this beer lived up to the hype or to its $7 price tag, but it is to date one of the best DIPAs I've had. I would definitely buy again, but for the price I would say there are some other beers out there that are a better choice.",Russian River Brewing Company,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,100
863,7971,Topher78,5,"The cap came off and I was treated to what I can only describe as heaven in a bottle. No other beer has ever had such a wonderful aroma to me as Pliny. I poured this magnificent brew into a sniffer glass and was rewarded with a medium golden colored brew that gave a fingers worth of fluffy white head and good lacing. The well balanced aroma's of citrus, grass and pine pleasantly greet your nose. The taste is amazing, the crispness of citrus was perfectly balanced with a strong malt backbone that left a slightly sharp aftertaste on the tongue. Despite having a relatively high IBU count and above average ABV, this beer is extremely drinkable. I can't help but think, this is the perfect DIPA!",Russian River Brewing Company,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,100

Dissipates to leave a small mound of froth in the middle. Great streaks of lacing.  S - Holy hops. A glorious burst of citrus and pine. Pineapple, grapefruit and tropical fruits were all present. A slight sweet malt smell could be found in the background.  T - Copious amounts of citrusy hop goodness. Pineapple, grapefruit and mango all play a role. Piney and resinous hops pop out in the middle. A sweet malty backbone helps balance everything out.  M - Medium bodied with moderate carbonation. A nice bitterness covers the palate but doesn't become overbearing. The bitterness lingers around just long enough to be pleasant. Finishes clean. Very drinkable.  O - This beer deserves all the praise it gets. Russian River really knows what they are doing when it comes to beer.

863,7971,Jugs_McGhee,3.72,"500ml brown glass bottle with standard pressure cap served into De Molen stemware in low altitude Los Angeles, California. Reviewed live.  A: Pours a 2.5 finger head of nice cream, good thickness, and good retention - especially for the style and ABV. Colour is a transparent yellow.  Sm: Fresh floral bittering hop notes. Maybe cascade? I'm bollocks at guessing hop varietals, but I do know that it's wonderfully pleasant and inviting. A moderate strength aroma.  T: Lovely fresh hop notes and floral notes. The balance is sadly off, with too much bitterness in the 3rd act and finish. It's a shame because the first two acts are so fresh, pleasant, and wondrous. It's quite well built. Deep, layered, and complex for the style. I'm impressed, but it's not without its shortcomings.  Mf: Smooth, pleasant, and wet. I'd definitely stop short of refreshing, but it's pretty good. Complements the flavours really well.  Dr: Very drinkable and pleasant for the style. Hides its ABV very well. I'd have it again on-draught - which is a rarity for me given the style. It's good and pairs well with meat, but it's not quite exemplary. I've had better IPAs.  --- Having tried many more beers in the style, I decided to revisit this one on 12/21/12. Bottled 11/30/12. 510ml brown glass bottle served into a conical Samuel Smith's pint glass. Expectations are high. Served straight from the fridge.  A: Pours a beige three finger head of nice froth but little cream, good thickness, and great retention considering the ABV. Body colour is a clear yellow/pale copper. No visible yeast. No bubble show.  Sm: Pine, pleasant citrus and floral hops, lemongrass, and nectary hops. No detectable hop bitterness, yeast, or alcohol. Pleasant and fragrant. Above average in strength. Appealing.  T: Grassy body with complex floral notes across the board balanced well against its subtle pine. A bit nectary. Flirts with a light soapy character but never quite crosses the line. Pale malts lend it body without compromising the well-executed balance. No yeast or alcohol comes through. It's very refreshing and enjoyable, with minimal hop bitterness. Very balanced and tasty, if somewhat simple compared to other beers in the style.  Mf: Smooth and wet. Nectary. Refreshing. Good thickness and palate presence; very light for the style and ABV. Complements the flavours well.  Dr: I know far more now about the style than I did when I last reviewed it a year ago (12/08/11 review above), but I still have to give it the same score. There is more to be done with a double IPA, and this is not the best one out there. I recall liking Heady Topper and Port 15 far more than this. An excellent Double IPA that would pair very well with any food. Hides its ABV well. Well priced for the quality ($3.25-$6.99 in L.A.).  B+  *** 06.20.17 impression on-draught at Freshcraft in Denver. Cost was $8.50 USD per 16oz pour.  Vibrant copper body colour. White head 2cm in height.  Aroma brings floral hops, pine, and vague fruit. Pale malts seem to balance out any hop bitterness. Aromatic intensity is average.  Taste and texture: Creamy, smooth, wet, not unrefreshing, well carbonated.  Floral and vaguely fruity, with some light resin in there as well. A robust pale malt backbone keeps it balanced.  OVERALL: Drinkable for its ABV, but the balance isn't quite dialed in and I've certainly had expressions of the style that boasted more intricacy, diversity, and depth of flavour. Hop profile could be more interesting.  B- / WORTHY  *** 2018/09/08:  Grassier than I remember. The simcoe character borders on oniony. I rarely use the descriptor ""catty,"" but I think it'd be fair to apply here.  B- / WORTHY",Russian River Brewing Company,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,100

Secondly, I am a diehard Imperial Russian Stout fan and I never thought that I would find an American Double/Imperial IPA that I would enjoy until I tasted Russian River Brewing Company's Pliny the Elder. All I can say is WOW and what an outstanding beer! From the very first sip I feel in love with Pliny the Elder. The aroma and taste (fresh grapefruit) is truly something to behold and I am really impressed with this DIPA to say the least.",Russian River Brewing Company,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,100

A: A light golden orange, with a 1.5 finger foamy head that sticks around for a while. Tons of lacing on the glass as the beer is consumed.  S: Mild amount of hops with notes of juicy orange and pineapple.  T: Medium bitterness from the hops (the perfect variety). Feels great upfront, though I want a touch more bitterness. I'm sure a three week old bottle would give me that. Great notes of sweet citrus forward as well, over a sturdy, but unobtrusive malt base.  M: Really light and creamy. Easily the creamiest IPA I've ever sampled. It's almost bizarre how light and creamy the beer is, especially at 8%.  O: So glad I got to try Pliny. It was much lighter than I expected-I could definitely drink three or four of these in one sitting.

863,7971,Parrotshake,4.47,"Some pals of mine were awesome enough to bring this home for me from the States without me even mentioning how great it would be if they did. Champions. Had a pint or two of this on tap at the brewery about 2 years ago and adored it. This bottle is about 3 weeks old.  Pours into the Buffalo Bill's Pumpkin Ale pint glass they also got me (lol?) a slightly hazy yellow-orange with a finger of white head, which sticks around a while leaving patchy lacing. Immediate rush of grapefruit and tangerine on the nose, with some underlying pine, floral notes and a hint of pepper.  The thing I LOVED about this beer on tap was the initial sharp, savory grapefruit character, a big wake-up call to the taste buds. This bottle is somewhat lacking in that at first. Pine, biscuity malt, citrus notes dancing around but not the assault that I remember. I worry briefly that bad things happened to this beer on it's way to me. Then after a few sips, my palate is sufficiently coated in hop oils and that remarkable slightly briny tang of fresh-squeezed grapefruit starts to dominate, subsequently making me drool. So fresh-tasting and moreish.  Mouthfeel and carbonation are around medium but you barely even notice. So friggin fresh and crisp and sunshiney that it never occurs to you that you're drinking something of such gravity.  A beer that I really love and sadly probably won't have again for a while.

863,7971,jsurfs82,4.82,"I gave a simple 5 out of 5 a few years ago when I first tried Pliny. Part of that may have been my lack of exposure to world class IPAs and part of it may have been the allure of obtaining this hard to obtain beer. To that end this beer holds up to my original rating and below I reflect on my latest experience.  I am enjoying this beer 05-09-2015 and the bottle on date is 04-22-15. So this beer is just over 2 weeks old.  The appearance of this beer is a clear golden yellow with a nice clean white head and some sticking lacing on my IPA glass.  The smell is a subtle piney earthiness not overly pungent but just right.  The taste is just iconic as what you would consider a perfect West Coast IPA. Not overly bitter as many other examples and finishes very dry and easy to drink. This 8% DIPA drinks easier than most 6.5 and 7% IPAs.  Overall this beer hits all the right points for a world class example of the style. With all the new hop varieties and hopping techniques being presented this beer still holds up as one of the best if not still The Best example of the IPA or DIPA.  This beer is truly the beer that has thrusted the current IPA to the mainstream, it's approachable, dry, aromatic, and truely showcases what the perfect example of a West Coast IPA is.

Oh yes, thank you for this beer RR.  Mouthfeel - Nice chewiness and carbonation.  Overall - Such a phenomenal beer, a beer all IPAs should aspire to be, was it worth the hunt? Yes.

S: Pine resin dominates far and away followed by grapefruit citrus and honeysuckle. The malt plays little to no role in the aroma.  T: The resinous flavor of this beer is staggering and it melds with the citrus and some of the milder tropical fruit components beautifully. The maltiness is no slouch but mainly provides a light caramel base rather than much sweetness.  M: Slick and thick with some chewiness due to the prodigious malt base.

The orange and yellow moves about the glass, and the opacity is different depending on which angle you view the beer from. A sticky IPA, the lacing is pronounced. Medium retention.  S: Definite floral hops with citrus notes. Very inviting smell.  T: A buttery, delicious, citrus flavor. Starts out quite sweet and ends with a heavy, bitter bite. The hops are there but aren't as pronounced as a lot of IPAs.  M: I don't think there's any room for improvement here. A bubbly, carbonated wave radiates the flavor through the mouth.

S - Beautiful aroma. Notes of tropical fruits like pineapple and mango swirl around with citrussy oranges and grapefruit. A touch of herbal spice too, coriander maybe?  T - Flavors are strong yet delicate at the same time. Like in the nose, the floral hops mesh perfectly with acidic citrus hop flavors. So smooth, not a palatte cutter. So fresh too, fresh hop juice, the nectar of the gods, or at least those on the west coast. Finishes with a flourish of acidic orange.  M - Full mouthfeel yet medium bodied. Moderate carbonation level is perfect. Dextrinous and creamy.

863,7971,BilbosNuts,4.5,"Poured from a 500mL bottle into a tulip glass.  A: Poured a clear golden color with a bit of light copper mixed in. A big, frothy, creamy white head appears and stays around for a long time (throughout the drinking experience actually). It leaves some scattered lacing behind. Numerous very small bubble streams rise to the top creating a lively and inviting appearance.  S: The first aspect I noticed was a blast of fruits. This included orange and lemon citrus and mango and pineapple tropical fruit aromas. A touch of floral hops finishes this one off. Very nice.  T: The taste is quite different than the aroma, but certainly not in a bad way. There is a significant increase in piney and resiny taste that isn't found as easily in the smell. A mild spicy hop profile is also noticeable. The citrus and tropical fruits are present, but not as up front as in the nose. A slightly hop bitterness acts as the conclusion.  M: Definitely on the heavier side for an IPA. A resiny feel coats the tongue while a perfect amount of carbonation allows the flavors to dance across the palate. Its nice, crisp finish prepares you for the next tasting.  O: I have enjoyed this DIPA for quite some time and finally got around to reviewing it.

S: pine, some garlic or musty onion. It's very earthy, and there is some hop here that's offputting that I didn't notice when I had it on tap. That's slight, though, and it smells pretty good. I don't get the citrus much at all on this bottle, though.  T: tastes bitter and delicious, with pine and slight citrus. Again, it has that weird hop flavor just a bit, but it's less so than in the smell.  M: thin for such a big beer, but it's crisp as it's meant to be. Good carbonation that isn't drowned out by malt.  O: good beer, but far from an A+ on the bottle I had. Might have to try it again later in life. Is 3 weeks too long to wait from the bottling date to actually drink it? That would be odd.  UPDATE: tried plenty more bottles, and really liked the last one I had. tasted like a drier Hopslam almost.

863,7971,jzmaxson27,4.46,"First, a huge thanks to tony223366 for trading me this beer, and getting me started off right on my reviews by breaking my beer geek ""cherry"" in the right way!  Reviewed 11/31/11 from a bottle dated 10/14/11.  Appearance: Beautiful golden colored pour with a fluffy white two finger head that fades to a thin cap. Sticks nicely to the glass on the way down and leaves very nice lacing. Carbonation is visible in a steady stream of tiny bubbles. Overall a beautiful looking beer.  Nose: Really nice citrus, grapefruit is the dominant smell though there may be a hint of lemon and orange. Not really getting much of the breadiness that shows up in the taste. It certainly makes my mouth water though. Not quite the ""dankest"" IPA or heavily hopped APA I have ever smelled however. Very nice nose, but not a standout.  Taste: Follows the nose. Again, a TON of grapefruit here down to a very sharp bitter bite to the back of the tongue, however there is a nice breadiness or cracker that helps to balance the bite. As it warms a bit the breadiness becomes more and more apparent, this is NOT just a crazy hopbomb, it is incredibly well balanced.  Mouthfeel: Easily coats the tongue, but not in an unpleasant way. A very full and robust mouthfeel that I would expect out of a barleywine, but not an IPA. Really pleasantly surprised here with how robust this is.  Overall: Absolutely delicious beer, and worthy of the praise. Slightly bitter for my personal tastes, but easy to see why this granddaddy has spurred so many imitators over the years.

The aroma gets you right away with strong grassy and citrus hops, grain malts and a moldy cobweb scented yeast with notes of orange peel and lemon zest.  The taste was ever so nicely bitter-sweet and slightly malty with a touch of lemon at first then had a nice hoppy bitterness come through with a nice does of orange peel at the end. The flavor lasted a good long time allowing for the hops and citrus to blend really well leaving a wonderful lingering aftertaste.  Mouthfeel was light to medium in body with a nice dry texture and a soft carbonation.

863,7971,dfernandez77,3.3,"Appearance: Lovely rich warm golden color. Very clear. Big rocky head thet drops fast and leaves little lace.  Smell: It's got Simcoe all over it. Resin, desert sage, asparagus, frankincense, and ghee (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ghee). Malt aroma is there, but hard to pin down. It's supposedly 2 row, Crystal and Carapils, but the characters I get are Pilsner? Marris Otter? Special B?  Taste: Big front end hop bitterness. Lots of pine, citrus blossoms, almost hot feeling in the bittering. Malt is burried, but there are raisin notes (that's where I get the Special-B) and ghee again - and the heat of dextrose. Hugely hoppy - lands on the tongue like a flashbulb in the eyes.  Mouthfeel: Starts slippery and oily. The middle is astringent. The finish bitter and dry.  Overall Impression: This is supposed to be a hop ride - and it meets its mark. There's Simcoe all over it and a couple other big C hops. If you like hops, this is a monster that will please you - especially when it warms. But there's a couple other hop monsters I've had that are more more balanced in their approach. PTE hits you like a 300 pound defensive lineman, where some other double IPAs have at least the grace of the dancing hippos in Disney's Fantasia.",Russian River Brewing Company,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,100
863,7971,Nachojon,5,"The myth the legend, thanks to my dad for hauling this beast out from California for me. Bottled 11/17 FRESH.  A- Looks like a Double, looks fantastic. Nice white head, laces beautifully. Awesome golden hay color with just a tinge of orange. Hazy.  S- Awesome fragrance, dense hops, pot, pine, pepper. Fresh grass and awesome citrus.  T- This is it. Starts mild with hints of grapefruit and moves into intense fresh hop flavor, pine, slams you with the bitter and then off to a chewy finish with a pucker. For a hophead this thing is just a blast from start to finish. Awesome aftertaste.  M- Crisp and clean, taste is just overwhelming, nice mouthfeel really adds to it, perfect carbonation keeps it on the tongue just long enough to taste it all.  O- In my opinion this thing lives up to the hype. It's a great beer. Something I would love to be drinking everyday. Just brings me back home to Northern California.

Poured a totally clear golden amber color with tiny rising bubbles. The off-white head is thin and frothy.  Aroma is full of flowers, pine and tropical fruit.  Tastes pretty fresh. This is fairly bitter and slightly acidic. Theres not much malt flavor here. There is a light and easy touch of sweetness.  Feel is slick, lightly crisp and a tad sticky.  This is pretty awesome.

S-Piney and citrusy, great hop aroma, very appealing. Not much malt there but still really nice.  T-Lovely bitterness, led by a great grapefruit attack with some resinous undertones. Just enough malt to provide some balance. The hop flavors are complex but restrained.  M-Medium bodied, nice lingering bitterness is not overdone.  O-The classic example of the style.

Instead it's quite balanced. Good hop bitterness throughout but not overpowering at all. Nice tones of grapefruit, a honey warmness from the alcohol (8%). For an IPA it's creamy as well. Honestly, for such a big IPA, it's extremely drinkable. It finishes very cleanly with just a bit of bitterness on the tongue.

Pours a nice crystal clear golden orange that sent up a nice creamy white one finger head that fell down to a film that leaves a nice sticky lacing all the way down the beer. Wow, what a nose. Hops, big time. Lots of tropical fruit, tangerine, orange, pineapple. It's sweet but smells like you just stuck your face in a bag of hops. It hits the tounge with lots of sweetness, fruit and sweet malt, but then quickly changes to a nice hoppy kick of bitterness, citrus, hop and orange rine, leaving a sweet flavor on the front of the tounge and a nice tingeling bitter sensation on the back. Mouth feel is nice. Big carbonation, a pretty full body, a nice oily hop resin coating, lots of stuff going on after the swallow with flavors sticking around. This beer has certainly lived up to its name. Really well balanced. I can't begin to imagine how this would have tasted 10/15, because I am having a pretty hard comprehending this beer being any better than this.

863,7971,wrycon,4.78,"Much thanks to TicoCali for the trade. Very excited.  Bottled 22 days ago (10.25.11)  Really amazing color. Seemingly translucent, shiny copper. Certainly the lightest-looking DIPA I've come across. Smells fantastic. Lots of tropical fruit and grapefruit, but anchored by an herbal, piney backbone.  So, let's give this bad boy a taste.  Quite good. The taste sensation is really pretty interesting. Not to get too abstract, but it's like an ocean wave - you're crashed intially with sweet floralness and expecting the taste to increase in intensity, like with other DIPAs, but it doesn't happen. Instead, the middle consists of a crisp, semi-oily, pine feeling that lulls you into a sense of complacency, like the undertow reeling the water back in. Finally the wave crashes back over your tongue with a robust carbonation and bitterness. The mouthfeel at the end is clean and oily at the same time, prompting another sip.  Overall, it is a great DIPA. No question. Picturing sitting at a bar and ordering pints of it and thinking it would be a phenomenal way to get inebriated.  Like It?

863,7971,harrmatees,3.5,"For us people on the east coast it reminds me alot of Dogfishhead 90 minute IPA, very hoppy. If you like hoppy beers this is for you. The alchohol is very well hidden.  I do not like that much hoppy flavor. I would much rather have Trappist Westvleteren 12 or 8, both of which I loved.  I would like to add that I would highly recommend everyone trying this beer, with so many good reviews I am sure I am in the minority. I am just not a big hop fan.

863,7971,rapidsequence,4.72,"16.9 oz bottle, just arrived in a box from Tim today. Bottled 10/25/11, so its right at 3 weeks old.  Appearance: Extremely clear golden orange. Off white head, above average retention. Beautiful lacing.  Smell: Orange slices and grapefruit stuffed into a quarterbag. Very pungent, dank hops aromas. There's some pale malty sweetness that's slightly crackery. Its pretty great.  Taste: High hoppy bitterness that doesn't become harsh. Very fresh and green tasting. More pine in the taste than the smell, and more bitter citrus than sweet. There is a bit of biscuitlike sweetness somewhere in the middle, then a lingering bitterness in the finish that is slightly grassy, but not bad.  Mouthfeel: This is not a huge sticky DIPA. Its medium feeling, with carbonation on the higher side for a little soft tingle. Resiny finish.  Overall: Its an excellent beer. Sort of an tweener between the bigger standard IPAs like a Green Flash and and really big DIPAs like a Hopslam, though it excels in either category. So much fresh, green hops, and lots of bitterness.",Russian River Brewing Company,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,100
863,7971,osusullins,5,"Thanks to some awesome friends for letting me taste this gem. Poured out of a bottle into a pint glass.  Beer pours a beautiful rich golden color with a thick white head. Nice lacing.  Smell is exceptional. Tons of pine hops, some citrus. Everything you would want in the bouquet of a DIPA.  Taste is OMG amazing! Rarely does anything truly live up to expectations, but Pliny definitly did. Great, simply great. Pine hops dominate from the start. The citrus comes into play somewhere in the middle. Great, bready malt backbone gives this one a nice balance. I LOVE THIS.  Mouthfeel is creamy. Almost nitro creamy... out of a freaking bottle. This beer is deserving of all the praise it gets.  Overall I couldn't have enjoyed this more. The people that shared this with me deserve great Karma to come there way. This was on my bucket list of beers and it lived up to everything. Great beer.

863,7971,tony223366,5,"A: Beautiful golden color. 2 plus fingers of creamy white head. Lots of lacing. Tons of lasting power to this head. Can't imagine a better looking IPA (given that there are a lot of DIPAs that look just as good).  S: Tons of piney and citrusy hops. It is just about as good as an ipa can smell.  T: Follows the nose with a huge amount of fresh hop flavor. Big pine and citrus. But the best part about PtE is the biscuity malt balance. As powerful as the hops are... the malts hold up and provide balance. It was done by a very careful hand. Peppery and bitter finish. Fantastic long finish.  M: With the lasting head adding tons of creaminiess this medium bodied beer has excellent viscosity and carbonation.  O: This beer is like no others. I'm hesitant to give that perfect score but... I've had all of the other beers that would try to take PtEs crown but I honestly felt they have fallen SLIGHTLY short in other ways. This has been (for years) one of my favorite beers and even as my palate has grown it has stayed one of my favorites.

There is pine and hop that are very strong and are balanced perfectly by citrus and caramel.  M: Perfect carbonation and decent viscosity.

You can usually find ONE thing to complain about in any beer, but not here.  Its a beautiful clear gold in color, the aroma is a huge citrus, pine bouquet, the taste is shockingly balanced, allowing you to taste both caramelly sweet malt tones yet tons of hop flavor and just the right amount of better. A lot of IPAs will smack you with too much blunt bitter, but this is the good hop flavor that we know and love.  Its light and crisp on the palette, remarkable for 8% ABV.

863,7971,deadonhisfeet,4.35,"Thanks to ThaFATkid for sending this west coast jewel to me here in ``Kentuckiana''.  Oh boy! I've wanted to try this beer for a long, long time. The bottle says this baby was born on 10/14. I drank it on 11/11. 29 days isn't a very long life, but this baby died valiantly.  It poured out a hazy apricot with a nice 2-finger head that dissipated quickly and left some thin lacing on the glass (did I mention I bought a new glass for this occasion?). I got a nice IPA nose of lemon, grapefruit, orange rind, and fresh flowers.  The taste is awesome! It's tart and prickly from the hops, but still maintains a nice malty smoothness with cookie-like flavors underneath the bite. I get big flavors of lemon, grapefruit, and kiwi with some subtle hints of biscuit, honey, and butter underneath. It has a nice, firm mouthfeel without being creamy. It lacks that sweetness that a few IIPAs have that can make them taste medicinal. I didn't drink another beer this night because I wanted to see if I'd still be tasting this one the next day (I did).",Russian River Brewing Company,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,100
863,7971,matttttYCE,4.89,"This review is for a growler of Pliny purchased right from the brewery on Thursday 11/10/11. Poured into my brand new Russian River stemmed glass. I also had Pliny there on tap on Thursday and from a bottle earlier this evening and all three really seem to match up quite well.  Appearance - Pours a brilliantly clear yellow-golden color, with almost 2 finger high, foamy, off-white head. Lace is minimal and the head fades to a light covering over top.  Smell - The smell is really out of this world. Lots of juicy sweet tropical fruits, grapefruit, nectarine maybe, pineapple, floral qualities, sweet citrus, bubblegum, light honey, almost a sugary sweetness to this, and maybe a bit of pine. Simply fantastic smelling DIPA!  Taste - Follows along with the aroma quite well. Lots of sweet tropical fruit, grapefruit and pineapple, maybe some apricot, citrus notes that are both sweet and sharp, substantial bitterness that melds wonderfully with the citrus and sweet fruit flavors, a bit more pine than in the aroma, with a bit of honey from the aroma as well. Wonderful tasting DIPA. I'm really not sure that it could get any better than this!  Mouthfeel - Mouth is what I think a DIPA should be. Consistency is creamy, carbonation is moderate or round (just right actually), body is medium-full but not too heavy by any means, and the finish is about average length, with lingering bitterness and light tropical fruit and citrus sweetness.  Overall - This is, without a doubt, completely deserving of a world class rating within the DIPA category! As I said in the taste section, I don't know that it could get any better than this. I made the trip to Russian River Brewery on a whim and boy am I glad I did. Pliny the Elder is simply amazing! Cheers!",Russian River Brewing Company,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,100
863,7971,julian89,4.46,"One of my good friends and I lucked out this past week. I received a bottle of Founders Canadian Breakfast Stout and he bought two bottles of Pliny the Elder. We had the most epic beer tasting afternoon ever. We began with the famous beer from the Russian River Brewing company...  Appearance- Very clear with a head of 1 finger and minimal lacing. It has a nice amber color with visual active carbonation.  Smell- Crisp with notes of apple, apricot, plum, and light malt.  Taste- Initial attack was a a smooth fruity mix with excellent carbonation. The progression across the palate leads to a perfect ""bittering hops"" end. The hops explosion in this beer is fantastic and one has to admire RRBCs' ability to balance the ratio of aromatic to bittering hops.  Mouthfeel- It is a light-bodied brew. I have to comment on the carbonation again, perfect and ideal to accent flavors and mouthfeel.  Overall- Excellent and lives up to its name. Very drinkable. I would love to head out to California to try the younger.",Russian River Brewing Company,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,100
863,7971,jpbebeau,4.38,"1st review, ever—forgive the inexperience. Made it a Pliny, which I was excited to pick up recently. Bottled 10/25/11.  A: Pours a clear golden amber into my new Duvel tulip; small carbonation bubbles release from the center. First pour failed to produce much of a head due to user error—and split w/ my wife—but I bought a few bottles and cracked open the second tonight as well. A nice one-and-a-half-finger head on the second pour, slowly dissipating as I sip, but clinging consistently and frothily to the side of the glass.  S: Maybe I'm a bit congested, but I wasn't overwhelmed by the aroma. A pleasant floral smell. My wife caught a bit of honey, and I'm inclined to agree, but only after hearing her say it. Picking up some melon toward the end of the glass.  T: Strikes the palate with a hint of sweetness, giving way to a quick bit of malt and then the bitterness of the hops, which never threaten to overwhelm me, but remain pleasantly present for a few moments after I swallow. Getting a little grapefruit at the end, too. Though I can feel the alcohol—now into my second glass—I'm not tasting it. Hops calm even further as the beer warms and I reach the bottom of the glass.  M: Full-bodied; a comfortable middle ground that's neither too thick or too thin. Little, if any, carbonation—but certainly not flat feeling.  O: All-around, a highly-enjoyable DIPA. I can see why it's so highly regarded, but I was expecting to have my mind blown, and didn't.  I remember really enjoying a Firestone Walker Double Jack I had a couple months back, and I'd be curious to try it again with the same critical/less-inebriated eye I've turned to the Pliny.  This was my first attempt at a beer review, and I was hesitant to display my ignorance, particularly on such a revered beer.

My girlfriend and I settled up to the bar, she ordered a Schneider and I dove head first into the Pliny.  Bright orange in color with a thick, creamy, white head. Tons of citrus and fresh hops in the aroma. Very appealing. The flavor lived up to my hopes. Strong, bitter grapefruit and pineapple that is nicely balanced out by bready malts. Rings along the side of the tulip glass all the way down. So drinkable for a double IPA. Not usually my favorite style, but this beer won me over.

863,7971,nc41,4.77,"Lives up to the hype which is rare. A citrus/grapefruit bomb, but nicely balanced and very drinkable. Very hoppy and definitely not a sweet DIPA, maybe a bit thin for a DIPA. IMO just a notch below 2008 Hopslam in overall greatness, and much better than the 2008/2010 Hopslam which IMO seemed a tad too sweet. The only problem is obviously distribution and freshness. I would guess most styles like this the hop hit would fade quickly, I'm sure a two month old Pliny wouldn't be as good as as 30 day brew.

T - tastes like it smells with a huge pine and jumper hops profile with hints of citrus in the background; so well balanced and enduring; just enough malt to balance it out but the hops are clearly the star. Elegant and powerful.  M - slightly oily and cut nicely with some sharp carbonation; still maintains a relatively light body in spite of all of this power  D - definitely for hop-heads  Clearly a classic; powerful pine hops that permeates every inch of this brew but still maintains an elegant balance.

Bottled on 9/21/11 - this is my third bottle, the first of which I had on 10/15.  Moderate pour left about an inch of stark white, soapy head with tight bubbles. Poured a crystal clear yellow-amber. Visible carbonation flowing up from the center of my tulip. Great retention and lacing all the way down.  Smell was fantastic. After I popped the top, I caught a burst of citrus and pine hop aroma - I hadn't poured it yet. Once poured it was more of the same...very hop forward with a touch of a cracker scent. Not smelling any residual sweetness at all. Just like anything ending in ""IPA"" (that is brewed in the US) should be.  Taste is delicious. Bold hops sting the tongue with bitterness and floral, pine and citrus notes. Just enough light, bready malt to keep a little bit of balance. Finish is dry and bitter with a lingering hop presence. Do not be fooled by the fact that this is an IIPA, there is only enough sweetness to balance some of the bitterness. There is not a significant malt taste at all - it is a hop lover's dream, a hop tea without being overly astringent, bitter or puckering. Just full of robust hop flavor.  Personally I like a thinner mouthfeel with my hops, and this delivers. It does not present the typical feel of an IIPA, it is thinner. Has moderate carbonation which helps prick the tongue, keep the feel rather light (despite the ABV) and release the aroma.  Best DIPA I've had.",Russian River Brewing Company,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,100
863,7971,Auracom,4.35,"Many thanks to my friend Al from California for getting this to me. Bottled just about one month ago, so it's not exceedingly fresh but it's close enough. 6-7 oz. into my C&B tulip on Halloween 2011.  A - Translucent gold coloring with a single-finger's worth of eggshell white head. Good retention, fantastic lacing and legs across the sides of the glass. Understated and I like it.  S - Pine cones, malty (caramel) sweetness at the front. Underneath I'm getting light citrus notes, mainly grapefruit, along with flora.  T - Wonderful initial hop bite that moves through the mid-palate with absolute ease. Hop oils and resin combine with more pine, caramel, honey, and malt grains. Backend is grapefruit zest and a reduced hop bite. Finish is quite dry - the hops really suck moisture out of the sides of my cheeks in this one. Lingering bitter aftertaste.  M - Thin-medium body. Quite smooth and even a bit creamy, which I find surprising. Carbonation is just fine.  D - I'm honestly surprised. A combination of midwest (Three Floyds) bias and the belief that Pliny might be overshadowed by newer DIPA entries left me expecting something not nearly as delectable as this. Pliny's hop character is considerably better than what I find in FFF Dreadnaught but Pliny doesn't achieve the same level of balance. Honestly, I'm not sure this bothers me. It is a great, great offering and finally, FINALLY, I can say I've tried a Russian River brew. :)",Russian River Brewing Company,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,100

A- A very vibrant golden copper color, very very thin bone white head. Plenty of carbonation, doesnt look overdone though. Slightly hazy.  S- Extremely fresh citrusy, pineapple aromas. Smells sweet, grainy, piney, awesome aromas coming from this guy. Smells of tropical fruits, more sweet candy flavors. Fuggin awesome.  T- Perfectly balanced bitter hop flavors and malt sweetness. Piney citrus goodness followed by a sweet bitterness and goes to a lingering bitter fruity aftertaste. Excellent.  M- Slick and lively carbonation, easy drinking, very good.

863,7971,HopsHopenstein,4.65,"Everything about this beer is Exceptional all the way down the line. The best IPA/DIPA that i have ever had. The apperance is a clear golden color with perfect carbanation and head. The smell hits you as soon as the seal is cracked on the cap. Its a beautiful arrangement of hops and grapefruit (almost tropical) with a very small amount of pine fragrance. No alcohol in the nose at all. Taste is extremely hoppy but not overly bitter. As with the nose its a balance of citrus and hops with a great crisp finish. And for a beer with an 8.0% tag on it i dont taste or feel the alcohol. Mouthfeel, very clean very crisp perfect carbantion. Overall like i said in the beginning my favorite Ipa/Dipa i have had to date everything about this beer leaves me craving another. And given the fact that its extremely drinkable i can have a couple more. Everyone should try this beer at some point in there travels. It lives up to its hype.",Russian River Brewing Company,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,100
863,7971,mtschmitz,4.88,"Probably reiterating all of the other posts but a Benchmark DIPA for sure..  A) poured into a pint glass and fit to the very last drop. Great light amber color almost a green tea color characteristic of an IPA. Good head rests on top.  S) hops, hops, hops, citrusy hops. Great pine resin smell.  T) This is definitely a benchmark ipa/dipa. Very hoppy up front as you would expect. Very crisp and not over-the-top bitter. Lemongrass. Well-balanced finish.  M) Crisp without a sticky finish as you might expect from how hoppy this is.  O) It took me a while before I ran into this, even living in San Diego. I went into it knowing the surrounding hype. It did not let me down. While it's definitely a benchmark dipa it's one I will only have from time to time to savor :)",Russian River Brewing Company,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,100
863,7971,pattermj,4.62,"Decided maybe I should get into reviewing again so starting with a good one. Picked up 3 fresh ones on my trip back to the parents place.  Appearance: Golden clear with a strong presence of bubbles. Minimal head which is why it only got the 4.5  Smell: Great smell of fresh hops without being incredibly overpowering. No sense of alcohol.  Taste: Nice and hoppy, but I wish it had a little more complexity but a good flavor overall. Does not overwhelm the tongue and goes down smooth afterwards.  Mouthfeel: A little light on the carbonation but by no sense flat. A nice dryness to the mouth after finishing.  O- If we had more IPAs like this in the area I would be hard pressed to pick between RIS and IPAs. But as RISs can last longer I have to stick with them. Still nice to have again.",Russian River Brewing Company,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,100
863,7971,seasmokiee,5,"I have never been a fan of the insane IPAs brewed on the west coast (or anywhere for that matter), but this one is amazing.  Appearance was not even noticed due to the aroma tickling my nose as soon as I poured it out of the bottle. I wouldn't mind this as an air freshener for vehicles. Pine, grapefruit.  Smell...see appearance.  Taste- I can tell you what I don't like about other IPAs. I hate overly bitter (Listening Stone) IPAs; it is a sign you are working on the gimmick of being a strong flavorful beer. Toast would be more flavorful if burnt to a crisp...yes it would; but taste like crap. This has all the wonderful flavors of hops in an odd and precarious balance with the malt. Dry, bitter finish and mild lingering to refreshing in seconds...Magic. Drinks like a mild pale (INSANE).  mouth-feel- I don't like viscus corn syrupy IPAs (listening Hercules/ Dogfish head 90 min [60 is OK]). If I wanted cornstarch in my beer, I would by one with it. Surprisingly light for a DIPA.  Overall- Vinnie has destroyed the constraints of the DIPA. There is nothing like this anywhere. I do see however some striking differences in the reviews of the persons who got this on draft...I will have to go to the brewery to try it out and see.",Russian River Brewing Company,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,100
863,7971,ncketchum,4.97,"Served in a Sierra Nevada Imperial Pint glass  A = pours a golden yellow, good amount of carbonation, white one-finger head which dissipates, leaving a good amount of lacing  S = a heck of a nose, hops, grapefruit, botanicals, no alcohol. Pliny smells very good, I could sit and smell this one for awhile  T = hops, hops, hops. Intense complex bitterness without being overpowering, then citrus, only a hint of alcohol.  M = perfect, nice amount of carbonation, not thick and sticky like some other DIPAs, very clean.  D = outstanding. the combination of all the above make Pliny the Elder just a phenomenal beer. I could easily drink a couple of these in a sitting, I'd just be worried I'd run through my supply too quickly.

863,7971,nandemo1,5,"Poured a crystal clear gold with a full finger of frothy white head that stuck around a while and left a lot of lacing. Carbonation bubbles continued long into the glass.  Smelled strongly of citrus, grapefruit and tangerines, as well as pine. Taste is pleasantly bitter with an extremely well balanced sweetness, includes some earthiness with that grapefruit twang.

S - Strong hop, moregrapefruit than piney, aroma dominates the aroma.  T - The hops coat the palate with a strong citrusy profile, grapefruit, a bit of pine, but with a very nice malt backbone. No real sharp finish from the hops with the malt smoothing the finish.  M - Medium bodied with good carbonation.  O - Great aroma and flavor! Everything a strong IPA should be. I can see why this beer is so popular!",Russian River Brewing Company,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,100
863,7971,ectomorph,4.65,"Thanks again to McCafferty for the trade.  A - Golden orange body, crystal clear, bright white head fades quickly leaving some small lace.  S - Pine sap, tangerine, and sweet apple hops. Very clean and appealing. Little in the way of malt is fine by me.  T - Awesome. True west coast hops attack. One thing I noticed here was the substantial bitterness is not at all harsh. It's is a more round bitterness that flows into the knock down hop flavor. Pine needles, oranges, tangerines. Fantastic. Zero alcohol warmth or presence makes this one dangerous for someone like me.  M - Nice and dry, hops in the aftertaste are sweet. Clears well and again the masking of the 8% ABV is astounding.  O - World class for a reason.

Pretty much nothing but hops, but very complex. i got a little bit of light grain as well, after a few sips.The taste buds are hit by soapy, bitter hops. Some sweet pale malt goes with the aggressive, but light hop taste. Bitter, pine hop flavor lingers. The feel of this beer is perfect. Wet, thin, perfectly drinkable. Easiest DIPA I've had to date.  What more can be said about Pliny? It made DIPAs drinkable and was the first IPA I had that I thought I could introduce my wife to, who, at the time, hated hoppy beers. The complexity cannot be overstated, especially for a beer style that is known for just kicking you in the face.

863,7971,ebrauser,4.64,"Bottled one month prior to drinking (9/21/11 to 8/22/11) Note: I did my best to judge this vs. the style as I am aware that this is one of the most popular and highly rated DIPAs around.  Appearance: Pours a huge, resistant head of cream colored foam on top of a light, straw-gold body. This seems a little light of a color for this style. Clarity is a shade less than brilliant.  Aroma: Sweet, fresh hop oils, sweet cream, and some pine and citrus, though neither of those play anything more than second-fiddle.  Flavor: Strong pine with touches of lemon. The bitterness and hop profile is very large, as an american DIPA should be, though it is balanced sublimely by a subtle malt force that acts just enough as a dampening factor to keep the hops from accelerating beyond control. Alcohol is noted in the far finish.  MF: Perfectly fits the style. Drinkable, likable, not sweet or syrupy. This is a drinking, not sipping beer.",Russian River Brewing Company,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,100
863,7971,Chris585,4.77,"Poured into pint glass after I made sure the temp was right.  Light color, great lacing and HUGE pineapple nose with pine and malt in good cadence. Seemed like each quaff was different and enjoyable. CHEWY. The sharpness up front was spot on for the style and seemed like the normal DIPA for me, but the END was subtle and even more enjoyable...I think this is where the drinkability comes in to play as all the other reviews have stated. The alcohol burn was noticeable for me, but blended quite well with the malt and hops in this. TOTAL EQUILIBRIUM.  I waited awhile to get this from the west coast. Sent to me from my brother who was there a week ago and ended up having to send to me from Philadelphia. Not sure if during that time the profile had changed, but I think I got the main components of the brew. The appearance was normal for the style, the nose was excellent, and taste was sharp up front and subtle in the end, which keeps you wanting more.  At this point in my quest to find my favorite DIPA, this ranks right up there. There are many that have better taste profile, but drinkability and aftertaste quality of this beer is exceptional.",Russian River Brewing Company,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,100
863,7971,duffcalifornia,4.68,"Poured from a bottle dated 8/18/11 into a Duvel tulip.  A: Giving the bottle a generous and vigorous pour, I got about 2/3 of the bottle into the tulip before the gorgeous head threatened to spill over. There's at least 2"" of thick fluffy head that fades slowly and provides amazing lacing. Beer is a slightly hazy golden amber. Could not ask for a better looking DIPA.  S: Smelled primarily of citrus hops, hops, and then more hops. Perhaps a bit of herbal tones as well, and just the hint of malt underneath the mountain of hops. I knew this was supposed to be wearing the crown for hopheads, and now I understand why.  T: Perhaps this is due to the fact that this beer is sixty days olf - ""the hops fade in hour 23"" jokes aside - but I find this has more dominant malt backbone than I had anticipated. Obviously floral and citrus qualities abound here and are the primary flavors, but there's a certain breadiness that hits on the finish which is not unwelcome. If the hops have faded in this at all, I'm almost afraid to know what they tasted like fresh.  M: Pliny feels appropriate carbonated and medium in it's feel down the tongue. Doesn't coat the tongue quite as much as this RIS lover might like, but that's inherent in the style. Can't fault RR for that here.  O: Despite not having them at the same time, I'm inclined to say that Hopslam is my favorite DIPA due to the huge citrus tastes and the hints of honey. However, given that this is a year round brew and a very fairly priced one at that, this receives top notches. I can't think of a better year round beer for the hophead among us.

863,7971,DCon,4.58,"Received a 1 PINT .90 FL.OZ. (500 ML) bottle of this from mdvatab in a trade. Poured from the Forest Green bottle with Pliny the Elder labeled in a Red Circle & is bordered w/ sayings like ""PLINY IS A HISTORICAL FIGURE, DON'T MAKE THE BEER INSIDE THIS BOTTLE ONE"", ""CONSUME PLINY FRESH OR NOT AT ALL!"", & many more into my 0,4l New Belgium Oversized Snifter Glass. Has BOTTLED ON: 071911 on the side in a box & enjoyed during Game 1 of the World Series- STL vs. TX. Go Cards!  Aroma- A very strong citrus aroma starts it off with TONS of hop character. Has a grassy aroma as well but more in the background. A bit of fruit and alcohol are also found. Not the same as the aroma I had on-tap but definitely reminds me of how Pliny was this summer in CA.  Appearance- Pours a 2 finger head that lasts for a great amount of time. Has a nice golden colored body that is clear. The lacing is made up of suds but its very big on the glass.  Flavor- Grapefruit flavor and strong hops make up this brew. Seems like very rare hops are used because the taste is very rare! Citrusy and a bit of booziness but not too overpowering. Perfect finish, medium-full on the bitterness.  Mouthfeel- Medium-Full Bodied, Medium Carbonation, Smooth, and has a nice alcohol warming with hops mixed in.  Overall Impression- Thanks again Mark! This is one of my favorite IPA's once again (go figure). I did enjoy it more on-tap back this summer and this may have been due to how fresh it was @ Naja's Place.

863,7971,heysuz,4.66,"Intro: I must say up front the review is from notes that were taken at the time of tasting. Posting the review is done much later. The “Bottled on Date” is 07/11/2011  Appearance: Pours a bright, light copper color. It’s evident that no barrel aging has taken place. It seems somewhat pale in comparison to other IPA’s. Head is abundant and very light colored, again indicating no barrel aging. You get your first indication that this beer is going to be different. It gives the appearance of a very clean and tidy brew.  Smell: WOW!! Hops, citrus, and pine. Again, beauty in simplicity is the impression I am left with.  Taste: Again, very straightforward and very simple. Hops and citrus. You get quite the taste of citrus peel/zest. Nothing fancy, just plain in your face Dragnet/Joe Friday “just the facts ma’am”.  Mouthfeel: Very dry. I seem to be left with the resin oily feel. Not over the top but definitely noticeable.  Overall: I’m left with the question of “Is this what they mean when they refer to “Left Coast IPA’s”. It was different than most of the IPA’s I’m used to, being from the Midwest. Not bad, just different. I’m not saying I didn’t enjoy the beer but it was not quite what I expected from all the hype that surrounds it. HopSlam is another very hyped up beer but that exceeded the hype for me, this did not. The best I can describe this beer is “Simple Elegance”. No bells, whistles, bourbon or brandy barrel aging.

863,7971,bwmichaud,4.5,"500ml bottle poured into an imperial pint glass.  What an awesome brew this is. I picked up 12 (fresh) bottles last year or so while in Oregon and thought it was a great brew. I just scored another (fresh) bottle this week and it's certainly better than I remembered. It poured a nice hazy orangy color which I love but others seem to deduct points for. I'm right, they're wrong. The hops and malt seem to be in balance with neither standing above the other. While this is an exceptional DIPA, there are a couple out there that are better (but not many). This is certainly a beer that I would pay a premium for and if it were available to me on a regular basis, I would drink the shit out of it. I like that the price point is reasonable for the quality of the brew.",Russian River Brewing Company,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,100
863,7971,ales4baldo,4.79,"Presentation-Seems to be in a very simple labled bottle. Like how it refers to the freshness of the beer and makes a constant reminder to not age and drink as soon as you can. Freshness is key to this beer.  Appearance-The beer itself seems to be a nice soft golden orange with a cloudy touch to it. Get about a finger and a half of truly delicious head. The lacing is wonderful, showing amount of sip taking each time.  Smell-As your nose starts to reach the beer, you smell strong odors of hops to no end, tons of grapefruit that you cant hide. Bitter flavors that sit on the sides of your mouth. Maybe a mix of green apples here and pine. Dont really taste much of a pineapple, could be my palate.  Taste-Boom! Thats how i would describe this beer. The second it enters your mouth its strong to deliver what a DIPA should be. Pine needles are present so are stints of wood and lemon. The draw is powerful and finishes with a slight bitterness and lingering dry hops on your tounge that ultimately leave you wanting another sip. Probably why i tend to drink this beer quite fast.  Mouthfeel-Like a DIPA this beer seems to be heavy when it enters your mouth. Almost like taking in a full chew of some form of food. Its delicious and extremely refreshing. The notes of hops come alive and malts seem to creep their way in there also. Again the grapefruit is sampled all over the place and the carbonation is well porportioned to really give it a full and bold drink and a solid crisp.  Overall-Ive never really been a big drinker of IPA or DIPA until recently and ive had quite a few different ones throughout the months and i have to say this one is by far my top 3. Probably could be the number one. Theyre rather easy for me to aquire being that i live fairly close to the brewery so i have 5 in the fridge right now. Picked up three today. A great beer and fine DIPA, everyone should at least try this beer. Drinking a fresh opened bottle poured into a pint glass or pilsner glass nice and cold tastes better than the beer on tap.

This is a very attractive beer with great lacing all the way through.  Smells like fresh pineapple, pine, and resin. It is a delight to the nose. I could crawl into my glass and go to sleep.

Very clean, very grapefruit, very citrus. Taste is great as well, clean, pretty dry, very citrus hop forward, with a big bitterness that follows everything else. Very enjoyable. Screw balance, this beer is all about the hops. Mouthfeel is surprisingly light for an 8% beer, with mid-high carb. Overall what a great beer.

The appearance is lighter in color, but don’t let that fool you. The aromas are intense. The taste lingers and lingers in your mouth, way after swallowing it. It has a more refined blending of flavors from top to bottom. Definitely a beer you have to drink at least once in your lifetime. You can tell there was a lot of time and effort put into this.

863,7971,Fux,4.48,"Bottle opened one month and a half after it was brewed : time to come to France and rest after its long trip from California.  A : Lots of fine bubbles racing through a light and clear orange see with glints of yellow light to a nice foaming surface. The head is dense, smooth and lingering.  S : Begins with an engaging floral hoppiness. Next comes the bitterness : overwhelming grapefruit, lemon also. More and more resinous as it warms.  T : Nice balance between maltiness and hoppiness. The acidity foreseen with the nose is not to much present. The taste is mainly sweet caramel malts, citruses and pines flavor. Finishes with a quite long lasting bitterness, although not overpowering as it could be for the style.  M : Very pleasant. Good carbonation. Creamy but salivating. Nice lingering aftertaste.  O : Nothing original in this beer despite its rarity, but a very good balance between the sweetness of the malts, the aromas from the hops and the bitterness.

Finish is a satisfyingly dense, lingering hops that grabs the back of the tongue with tenacity. ETOH is evident, but not hot or harsh.  There are other very good DIPAs out there, and this certainly stands among them.

863,7971,flannelman808,4.4,"""...PLINY THE ELDER IS A HISTORICAL FIGURE, DON'T MAKE THE BEER INSIDE THIS BOTTLE ONE...""  A Long awaited new vs ever so slightly old Pliny review awaits...  Ok, so I have wrapped up two different batches of Pliny the Elder in paper towels so that they are indistinguishable. One of two bottles is the most recent batch released, (and is the most recently available in Los Angeles) and is likely a bit less than two weeks old. The other bottle is the previous released batch, which is something like twice as old as the first (still not very old, even by IPA standards). I did not commit the specific bottling dates to memory and don't want to remove the blindfolds which make each a mystery, So I will post them once I'm done reviewing both bottles in full.  This review is going to both incorporate a review of Pliny the elder, and the effect of aging over a short period of time. This effect, which may or may not be perceivable to this not so humble reviewers palate. The warnings on bottles, and quote from said bottles at the top of this review, would lead one to believe that Russian River feels something distinctly negative happens over time to this beer. This is true of all IPA's but to what extent and for how long does a beer stay worthy???  ---Ok bottle #One (again I have no idea which it is)---  A: let it be known there is light. Pliny is crazy bright and is not unlike petrified amber. The air however isn't trapped, It rises up and releases a pretty nice looking head. The foam is just barely off white and has ok retention. In it's wake it leaves a spiderweb lacing.  S: The nose is of fallen pine needles first and foremost. While it has a fairly pronounced bouquet It's mostly of green and forest floor aromas. I will say as this warms it presents a white grapefruit like perfume in addition.  T: A refreshing quaff... much more citrus is pronounced on the tongue than ones nose would lead them to expect. White grapefruit which reminds me a little bit of Haribo white grapefruit sour candy minus the sour. Green and brown pine lingers on the finish and resonates for some time after the citrus is gone. In the end a touch of subtle sweet malty caramel flavors adds it's hand in this beers complexity and helps balance the more astringently dry nature of this beer.  M: Sticky, Prickly.  O: I don't think I really need to comment here. This is a fantastic beer and to which all other DIPA's are put up against. Finishing with more perceivable dryness than sweetness, yet leaves room for a little bit of sweet balancing malt.  ---Blind Bottle # Two---  Ok, with a bit of a palate cleanse its on to Bottle #2 (I've no idea which is which still):  A: So a similar looking beer sits before me. I would dare say however that its just a touch lighter in color (on the yellow side of the spectrum). Other than that it's tit for tat.  S: Once again the pine needle is in the lead. Citrus peel is an a bit of an afterthought as it warms up though it's present. I do feel that this one is less pronounced on the nose and I sense a bit of caramel in the aroma as well which was not noteworthy in the first pour.  T: As the nose aroma would have had me believe The big difference factor I find between the two is the presence of malty sweet flavors. Brown pine needles (not green and brown, just brown and dried) and caramel malty granola sweet flavors are markedly more present. The citrus present in glass one is only a faint afterthought.  M: Smooth with a tickle.  O: All and all this still carries most of the flavor of glass #1 but lacks the PHAP-ZHOU perceived drying quality which is so important in this style. I have to assume at this point all of this is due to the limited aging potential of hops and that this is the older brew. Still bitter overall, I am being very specifically picky, all of this is not to say the older version is totally bad. It is to say that I think it is different in ways which are felt by the drinker, and could easily lead to a misperception as to just how good this stuff can be.  Ok... Am I a total fool????  Bottle one date: 100411 or exactly 12 days old. AMAZING!  Bottle two date: 091611 Exactly 1 month old!!! wow I didn't look at the actual date on the bottle before pouring but it was bottled a month ago today.  I have always been curious as to the breaking points of IPA's. At what point has a beer changed in a good or bad way to the palate of its taster. IPA's are more susceptible than just about anything to father time but I find different beers of style tend to remain ""good"" for varying amounts of time. Why and which? More to come...

863,7971,scruffwhor,3.48,"Loads of thanks go out to n8dietz for picking this bottle up for me whilst in CO.  Bottled on 09-16-11  Clear, light copper color with good bubbling. Two finger head after the pour and solid foam for all 500ml. Lacing was just barely there.  Strong, astringent grapefruit hop resin aroma. Maybe catch a little toasted barley malt in the aroma. A little earthy, but mostly powerful citric hop aroma.  Powerful, astringent hops of a grapfruit rind and floral nature. Pretty dominant from start to finish. The middle lets a little toasted malt come through in the way of bread crust and biscuits. But this is pretty faint amidst the fresh atringent hop bomb. The finish has even more added astringency thanks to the 8% abv.  This beer is just a little resiny, but mostly metallic on the tongue.  I'm so glad I got to try this hyped up beer thats unavailable to IL residents.

T-The sweet aroma carries into the first taste of the beer with grapefruit character. The malt backbone reveals itself and balances nicely with the hops and bitter finish.  M-Takes over your palate with a lasting bitterness. Starts slick but finishes sticky and mouthwatering.  O-The aroma to flavor transition is terrific.

Massive sticky lacing on the glass. The smell is bold, a combination of pine and citrus, a very clean aroma that's not overpowering. I'll admit, i don't drink a lot of IPAs or DIPAs, but this beer is extremely tasty. Again, the pine, citrus, grapefruit flavors are all well balanced and work harmoniously. The mouthfeel is crisp, smooth, and for lack of a better word, perfect. Overall, I waited a long time to try this beer, and in fact I had to overpay for it on Ebay just to get it. To say that I was skeptical is an understatement, as this beer has reached mythical status. But I can attest to it's reputation, this is a fine, fine beer. I'll probably never have it again due to the price, but I'm glad I got to see what all of the fuss was about.

Decent 1 inch head dissapates to leave a thinb white film and nice lacing all down the glass.  The smell is absolutely fantastic! Fresh, oily hops dominate.The smell is a fresh citrus with a bit of pine. It's hard to detect much else over the mouthwatering hop aroma.  Taste is right up there with the smell. At first contact on the tongue there is a wonderful blast of hops, just slightly bitter. This deliciousness continues all the way through the swallow. It never turns overly bitter. Just a delicious, oily hop flavor.  Mouthfeel is no exception to this fantastic beer. Nice smooth, creamy feel. It is never too heavy or thin. The ABV is absolutely hidden. Carbonation is just right.  This beer is magic. While I prefer it just a touch on tap, it is still excellent in the bottle. It never gets old.

Two finger frothy head with nice lacing until the last sip.  Smell: Smack in the face of grapefruit and pineapple. Smells delicious. Lots of citrus hops and slight bitter aromas as well. Little pine and resin in there somewhere. I wish I could have this aroma as an air freshener.  Taste: Burst of citrus hops. The flavor follows the nose very well. Definitely get a lot of the oils from the hops, with a little bitterness, and pine. The balance between the hops and the slight malt character is outstanding. Malt lingers on the tongue. No booze taste at all.  Mouth feel: Very light on the tongue, not thick and syrupy like some higher ABV IPA’s I’ve had in the past. Nicely carbonated. Resin from hops let it coat your whole mouth to get the full flavor.  Overall: I honestly think this is one of the best IPA’s I’ve had. At least on the top five list.

A: Just a fantastic looking beer. Pours a very pretty gold with some copper highlights when held to the light. Fluffy white head rises and falls, resting into a bubbly, lacy white head that leaves thick walls of lace behind.  S: Strong, ripe and juicy fruit. Mangoes, pineapple, grapefruit, wonderfully floral hops. This is one of the finest aromas I've ever come across in a beer. I'm finding that all of these rumors are coming through in spades.  T: Sharp, oily hops up front followed by a rounded bouquet of citrusy rind. Bearably hot. The sweet malt is supportive, yet lets this outstanding balance of different hops shine. Oddly, I feel like the nose is so outstanding that it dwarfs and maybe steals a little bit from the overall taste. Still, fantastic.  M: Definitely a palate killer, takes over the palate. Nice prickly but not overbearing carbonation, lets the beer really move all over and coat the palate.  O: This is definitely a top tier beer. Strong and bold yet very well rounded and drinkable.

Taste is very similar, although notes of backbone malt are there just enough to balance out the hop bite. Notes of tropical fruits come out as well.

This beer is like Tom Brady, too pretty to be so good. Gorgeous and clear, a clean and golden orange with two fingers of just off-white head that leaves sticky rings of lace all over as the glass becomes empty.  Massively pungent grapefruit and pineapple presence on the nose; aromas of fresh cut grass and pine, supported by a bread malt undertow.  At first sip, this seems fairly straight forward, but its deceivingly complex, revealing its nuances as it warms. As the nose hints, tropical fruit and resinous in the forefront, with a tongue prickling spiciness and subtle medicinal quality sneaking through to accompany an assertive hop bitterness. Balance is lent by a modest malt sweetness to round it out.  For the ABV and size of this bottle, it was gone too damn quick. Medium bodied, crisp and semi-dry in finish, this boasts a sticky oiliness from the hops along with perfect carbonation levels.  What more needs to be said?

It was bottled on 9/16/11.  The appearance was good, as good as it should be. There was a healthy amount of head, and the color was just right. The smell was typical.

863,7971,Phelps,4.1,"Enjoyed from the tap at Stone’s bistro inside some stemware. I’ve tried this beer twice from the bottle and rated it less than favorably (well, compared to everyone else). Having been heretofore unimpressed, I’m excited to see what a difference a tap and guaranteed freshness can make.  Almost perfectly clear pale orange and capped with one finger of pure, sticky, frothy white. The head dissipates slowly until it becomes a thick, frothy ring. So far, so good.  The nose isn’t ass-kicking or intensely sticky, but it is bright, sweet and tropical. Grass, mango, apricot and citrus peel all show up, with some resin in the back and hardly a hint of malt.  While resin may have largely stayed out of the aroma, it’s certainly made its way into the flavor. My first mouthful is thick with sticky resin, grass, orange peel and hints of pineapple and mango. Honey and crackers do their best to support the bitter backbone and seem to be bent about as far as they can be. It’s like drinking distilled hop bitterness, which make sense with this beer’s use of hop extract.  I’ll say this for Pliny: for such a hearty brew (8 percent?), he’s surprisingly easy to drink. The light, thin body contrasts the big, sticky flavor and lends itself to easy quaffing, offsetting the heat in the throat and moderate bitterness.  Well, my world wasn’t shattered, but it’s not hard to see why others clamor for this beer. Very tasty, very drinkable.

Pliny has the lead a little because sometimes ruination can have a little bit to much bitterness to it. love the color of this beer pours a nice clear burnt orange and the hop scent for it is spot on perfect. because of this beer I now know that simcoe hops are the bomb and I'm always on the hunt for beers that have that piney simcoe taste.,Russian River Brewing Company,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,100
863,7971,beerdweeb,4.92,Fresh Pliny is out of this world. Definitely one of the best DIPAs around. Pours a medium amber color with sticky white head. Aroma explosion of citrus and pine. Straight dankness all around. Fruity and piney with a sweet malt backbone on the tongue. Hop profile marinates and lingers. Medium bodied. Deserves its reputation as being one of the best DIPAs in the world.,Russian River Brewing Company,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,100
863,7971,STKPICR0720,5,"Overall WOW thanks Mike for sending me this brew. Bottled on 8/18/11 this brew pours a very light golden hue. Hops up front, in the middle and in the end. Very easy drinking 8% abv. I also picked up on a buttery taste that made the beer even smoother. I honestly really cannot explain how good this brew really is. Find one or move to California and get it all the time. Awesome brew and once again thanks Mike for the trade.  Cheers",Russian River Brewing Company,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,100
863,7971,quirkzoo,4.68,"Beautiful, almost dayglo, orange with a thick sticky white head. Smell is pure hops. Lots of pine and grapefruit, very clean with almost no vegetal or malt aroma. Taste blasts you with bitterness. It is strongly bitter but again very clean. The hops dominate with more pine and grapefruit which are so strong it was hard for me to detect much subtlety behind them. Everything about this beer is super clean which lets the strong hops and bitterness shine, front and center. Good carbonation and a very easy drinking beer. Overall this is a great beer. I didn't give perfect scores for smell and taste because I like a bit more complexity but what is there is very strong and clear and enjoyable.",Russian River Brewing Company,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,100
863,7971,JohnnyHopps,4.56,"Pouring from the bottle, one is immediatley struck by the yellowish orange color of the beer. Notes of hops, pine, and citrus are striking in the aroma. Even before tasting, it is very apparent that this is not your average beer. The beer is uncommonly smooth. The hops and well balanced with the smooth texture. There is potential for this beer to go down easy, and consume in mass quantities. It is not an IPA, just for the sake of being hoppy. Pliny the Elder is not trying to out-hop other beers. It has a unique flavor and texture which sets it apart. A well designed beer.",Russian River Brewing Company,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,100
863,7971,burnstar,4.92,"Pours a clear orangish gold. Nice sized head. Lacing on the surface and sides. Smell is huge piney, citrusy, and spicy hops. Cloves, lemons, and grapefruit. Taste is tremendously hoppy and sharply bitter. Bitter grapefruit. Resinous. Piney. Hops overpower everything throughout. Some sweet maltiness far in the background. Lingering bitterness. Full bodied. A bit boozy. Well carbonated. Overall a hop powerhouse. Really great stuff- an awesome DIPA.",Russian River Brewing Company,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,100
863,7971,alisah318,5,"An amazing fresh and hoppy beer. In the top five for me, although I am a hop head! Hard to find though.

863,7971,MrVonzipper,4,"Crystal clear golden-peach color with a solid frothy white head with nice retention and lacing.  Nice mild pine, pineapple and citrus hopped nose with a mild malt backbone.  Nice mild caramel malt flavor supporting a floral and mild pine hop character.  Mouthfeel is medium bodied, fresh and crisp with a mild stickiness and medium carbonation.  Overall a very nice DIPA. I've had it several times and this by far was the best I've had.

863,7971,Jules11788,4.09,"A: Pours a golden straw color; small head, light lacing  S: Fruity, earthy, very floral, like sticking your nose in a bouquet of flowers  T: Lots of hoppy bitterness, some earthy/peppery flavors, finishes smooth and bitter as the flavors open up at the end. Was not nearly as citrusy or floral of a taste as I expected from the reviews, more of a traditional IPA but perfectly balanced with lots of subtle earthy hop flavor.  M: Medium-thick, creamy, no hint of booze at all  O: This was a little disappointing with all the hype surrounding it, but it was still a very delicious beer nonetheless.",Russian River Brewing Company,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,100

S- Smells very good but not amazing or anything. A lot like many other good Double IPAs. Marmelade and pine all wrapped in some nice alcohol.  T- Great. A little more woody and grassy of a finish than I'd like. Extremely smooth taste.  M- Medium carbonation which foams up just enough. Perfect amount of dryness. Mouthfeel is also great. S  O- A very very good IIPA but it's not exactly a life changing experience. Tastes like many other great ones.

863,7971,beer2day,4.92,"On tap at The Library in Santa Monica in tulip glass.  Deep gold color with 1-finger raw paper cream head. Light retention and sheets of lace on backside of the glass.  Nose is outstanding. Complex, with pine and citrus notes. Lots of pine but a deft mix of pineapple, grapefruit, apricot ... very nicely done.  Absolute explosion of hops on the tongue. Gets very spicy towards the middle of the pour with light pepper. Again, a bountiful mix of pine resin and citrus flavors. Exceptional mix. No hint of the abv here.  As strong at the flavor profile is, it would be hard for the body to match. It comes very close.

863,7971,jamescain,4.92,"Poured into a Duvel tulip glass, bottled on 8/9 (I believe) consumed on (9/6).  Appearance: Clear golden orange with small bubbles rising to the top with an off white colored head about a finger thick that clings to the side of the glass and fades into a thin lacing.  Aroma: Pine, pineapple, peach, tropical fruit, citrus, lemon grass, and grapefruit very fruity and exceptionally blended.  Taste: Complex, a hint of sweet malt, pineapple, peach, citrus, and grapefruit. This is what separates the good IPAs from the exceptional, world class, IPAs, the depth of flavor.  Mouthfeel: Incredibly drinkable, the huge amount of hops and the higher alcohol do not take anything away from its drinkability. Medium carbonation and a medium-light body with a crisp dry lingering finish.  Overall: It definitely lived up to its hype, I would love to try a fresher version though. At a month old it was pretty much on the decline at this time, but it was still phenomenal.",Russian River Brewing Company,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,100

S - Pine, grapefruit, mango, and pineapple.  T - Pine upfront, then tons of pineapple, bitter earthy finish, then a slightly (very slighly) hint of peach sweetness on the aftertaste. Really hits all the hop flavors.  M - Medium carbonation and medium mouthfeel. Good amount of thickness and silkyness.  D - Medium high. The refreshing taste and carbonation make this go easy. The medium body of the beer is the only thing holding me back.  A solid beer. World Class, maybe?

It has a medium white head of foam that quickly fades. Has a mild amount of carbonation.  S- Is incredibly potent. Has a huge hoppy smell, citrus, piney and even notes of honey.  T- Its amazing. Has a HUGE hoppy burst. A crazy assortment of mixed hops. I great citrus burst right up front. Nice amount of honey, spearment notes. A very grassy taste. Leaves your mouth with a nice sweet citrus finish.  M- Fantastic drinkability considering the abv is pretty high. Huge bold upfront hopes leaves you with great hoppy finish.

Thick, foamy white head leaves very nice lacing and sticks around.  S: Piney hops, pine sap, and spearmint leaves.  T: Very complex and well-balanced. Biscuity malts, pineapple, grassy hops, and honey sweetness. Strong hops presence without ripping your tongue out. Only gets better as the beer warms a bit.  M: Excellent mouthfeel. Exceptionally smooth for the amount of hops and high ABV. The alcohol is masked very well and warms without ever being a component of the flavor. Extremely drinkable for what it is.

L: Slightly hazy golden yellow, creamy white head that dissipates slightly.  T: Resiny, very bold resiny and pine hops up front with a soft bready sweetness. More layers of hoppiness follows a medium high citrus bitterness. Perfect balance of malt complements the resiny hop finish, semi-dry.  M: Medium full body, medium carbonation.

863,7971,dbmernin83,4.89,"A growler fresh from the brewery. Definitely the freshest Elder I've ever had. Pours a dark golden with an inch white head. Great lacing. Carbonation appears to have held up well. Huge pine hops on the nose. I have this frequently on draft in LA and it never smells this strong. This beer tastes like awesome marijuana. I know hops are in the same family, so it makes sense, but this is a gigantic skunky hop bomb on the tongue. The bitternessisnt overwhelming, just huge piney hop flavor. This beer had to have been brewed with some malt but it's nowhere in sight. Correction, while the beer warms a sweetness whispers as the hops scream through a megaphone. For the flavor profile, this beer is light. It goes down too easy at 8%. I imagine this is what hops in a blender + water * carbonation would taste like. I always thought the freshness thing was a little ridiculous. I get that a beer, especially an IPA should be fresh, but the difference between 2 week old Pliny and maybe a few days old Pliny is ridiculous. Love Pliny in the bottle or at your local beer bar? Try some fresh from the source. Incredible.",Russian River Brewing Company,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,100
863,7971,schwaeh,4.3,"Bottle sent as an extra by HeavyTaste. Bottled 8/26/11.  A: Pours a glowing golden orange color with several fingers of fluffy white head. The lacing is very sticky.  S: The smell is a combination of pine, juicy citrus, and a nice grapefruit bite. I can smell the alcohol in this one. Malt is hardly decipherable amongst the bouquet of hops, no east coast DIPA here. The aromas are sweet and very bright.  T: Orange, mango, and pineapple wash over the tongue in a wave of fruit followed by a bitter piney sensation. You can tell right away that this is sticky and sweet with lots of hop oil. The bitter grapefruit and pine start to take over the citrus after a few drinks. Very nice balance of bitter and flavor, it doesn't rip your tongue off but it sure makes itself known as a big DIPA.  M: Medium body, very resinous and coating. The flavors linger for quite some time.  O: This last month has been hop heaven for me and this one holds it's own with the best of them. Extremely drinkable for the higher ABV.

The aroma is a hop exploision. Very hoppy, very refreshing and crisp. Orange and pine are at the front with some mellow tropical fruits comming in as well.  This beer is amazingly balanced. It is super hoppy but the sweet and bready malts shine through beautifully. The piney, resiny hop character really comes though, with some orange rind on the end. Really great hop flavor.  Mouthfeel is very resiny and slightly drying from the hops. Carbonation is spot on and the alcohol is very well hidden.  Awesome beer, not much else to say about this one.

863,7971,jayhawk73,5,"Bottled Sept. 7, 2011. 10 days old at review  Pours a beautiful light golden color w/ a really nice off white two finger head. Head sticks around for a while too, eventually goes down to a thin head. Massive amounts of carbonation and lacing on my snifter. Really amazing looking beer, and tops for the style that I've had. First thing I notice is that it's a really clean, smooth, and refreshing nose. Hops, pine, floral, and minimal malt notes are all there. I can't believe how smooth and perfect this is. Nose is so good I could smell it all day, but there's the whole tasting of the beer I need to experience... Taste.... Wow. It's so good... and complex.. and smooth.. and drinkable. Simply amazing. The taste is even more superb than the nose, but they're both 5's for sure. I can't imagine any part of this or the nose being any better. Feel is really great too, full bodied, w/ a major zing from those hops. Very smooth/crisp/chewy, and the flavors just stick around on the aftertaste forever. Overall, this beer totally lives up to the hype for me. It's simply one of the best beers I've ever had, and I'm glad I finally got to try it.

T: Very very hop forward, hardly any malt in this which is awesome. A very good fresh hop taste, lots of pine and floral notes. Yum  M: Probably the smoothest drinking IPA I have had.

863,7971,sdmvd6,4.89,"Bottle date of 8-18-11...poured into a Duvel tulip  A - Light orange with about a finger of head that dissipates relatively quickly to a thin ring around the glass. Little lacing is left.  S - Pine, grapefruit, and mango hit the nose instantly. Then more citrus and a bit of toasted malt.  T - Big hop bitterness up front with flavors of pine and citrus, notably grapefruit. Bitterness bridges the gap between these fruitier flavors and a toasty malt backbone. [Edit: After having a few on a recent trip to CO, I have noticed an ever so slightly nutty flavor between the initial hop profile and the bitterness in the finish. I have not found this particular flavor in any other IPA, and I really think it contributes to the balance that sets Pliny apart.] The finish contains a touch of aspirin-like chalkiness and more bitterness that lingers well after the last sip.  M - Lots of sticky, resinous hop oil is present in this medium-bodied IIPA. The finish is effervescent and very dry.  O - This is a wonderful IIPA by RR that definitely lives up to the hype in my opinion. This is the third time I have had the pleasure of tasting it, and it has never disappointed.

863,7971,Neorebel,5,"I made tasting this beer a bit of an 'event.' In a Glencairn Scotch glass to get more of the nose... which was a very complex & reminiscent of a spring meadow and sweet nectar. The taste lived up to the hype as well as the amazing aroma- hops of course up front, with a juicy citrus right in the middle of the flavor, finishing nicely with a pleasant bitterness. Did I mention fresh?? it's ever so fresh, it reminds me of drinking the purest bottled water. What's amazing about this beer is how balanced it is, and how the alcohol is masked... almost every IPA is somewhat undrinkable 'all day' in that it is not refreshing - it gives you a dry mouth after a while.

I think this one might have been a little old... probably about 3-4 months old... it was a bit ago and I didn't write down the bottle date so I can't tell you exactly how old it was. Regardless... poured a slightly hazy orange color with a finger of foamy white head that retained pretty well and left a little lacing. The aroma had notes of citrus and piney hops, with some sweet caramel thrown in. Not as much hop aroma as I would've liked, but see above. The taste was nice and balanced, nothing too overly present. There were notes of caramel, pine, citrus and some grassy hops. The mouthfeel was relatively smooth and finished clean.

Produced a very nice two-finger billowy, yet dense, head. Moderate retention, with some very nice, sticky lacing. Great deep honey, apricot color. Deep but super clear, no haze, no sediment. Very nice.  Smell is of fruity hops. Loads of pineapple, a bit of pine, and some subtle grass notes round out this hop dominating nose. Not astringent, very clean, but could've maybe used a bit more punch.  Bountiful tropical hop flavors upfront; more tropical than citrusy, lots of pineapple. Piney in the middle, followed by some nice bready malt, with a super clean dry finish that lingered just long enough. While exceptionally tasty, I think a more complex and layered hop profile could be achieved.  This is easily the most drinkable DIPA I've ever had. It drinks like a strong Pale Ale; super smooth, great carbonation. At 8.00% this is still drinkable enough to be a session beer. Wow.  Overall this is truly an exceptional, world class beer. Whether or not it's the greatest-of-all-time DIPA...well I haven't had them all so I can't say. Is it the best I've ever had...hells ya! I'm glad I have another in the fridge. Thanks again jimmy2282.

Not subtle, and its intentional. I could smell 80 of the 100 IBUS.  Taste - This beer is well-built and made to last. It is unbalanced and does not try to be, it is a hoppy beer for hop lovers. Hits the mouth sweet and crisp full of pine and citrus then the hop bitterness grows and finishes with some alcohol and citrus hops. The body sits very well and drinks very well. After reviewing, I ended up opening and drinking my second bottle that was planned to come home to Raleigh with me.  Overall - Well-hyped, but worth the hype.

The taste is that rare and perfect combination of luscious malt and spicey, tangy hops. Phenomenal balance. Russian River hits it out of the park with Pliny. A superb American Double IPA.

Mmmm: Candied pineapple and other tropical fruit dominates the aroma, with some citrus and a little pine underneath. There is a very unique depth to the nose -- it is quite different depending on how far the glass is from your face (more Centennial-like sweet orange from far away and resiny Simcoe up close). No malt to be found, which suits Pliny well. Amazing nose.  Serious hop complexity on the palate. The flavor is similar to the aroma, but much more intense. While still more tropical than citrusy, the oranges and grapefruits come forward significantly compared to the aroma. There is so much fruit flavor that it evokes a slight sense of sweetness. This and just a bit of pale malt sweetness help assuage the hefty but smooth bitterness. Just delicious.  The medium carbonation is perfect. The body is on the higher side of medium, and is light enough to make this beer quite drinkable. Overall an absolutely outstanding beer.

863,7971,Nugganooch,4.58,"100th Review – PtE  Really not much that can be added to the millions of great reviews here but this is just my little ode to Pliny.  Story goes Pliny the Elder came to fruition through a mere miscalculation…an oversight by the brewer who did what he thought best to counter his mistake. Like a modern Sir Alexander Fleming accidentally discovering penicillin and saving millions of lives. Yes it is that good.  In fact:  -Pliny is so good it never reads in bad light. -Pliny is so good it will take your mother out for a nice seafood dinner and then have the decency to call her the very next day. -Pliny never jaywalks. -Pliny rescued the Chilean miners. -6 month old Pliny is still better than your beer. -Pliny always wears a condom. -Pliny helped build the Great Wall of China as well as tear down the Berlin. -Pliny would never hit on your wife or girlfriend. -Pliny will always have $5 on it!!! -Pliny ended the cold war. -Adding Pliny to any beer will actually increase that beers rating however adding any beer to Pliny will only result in diminishing its greatness. -Pliny landed on the moon first. -Pliny is just as good, if not better, than those times you get to drop off some incredibly well mannered kids at the pool. -Pliny always eats his vegetables. -Pliny is so good it always wears a seat belt and never texts while driving. -I bet if you blended Pliny the Elder with Pliny the Younger you could travel back in time like some sort of tasty hop vortex. -Pliny shot Bin Laden  Okay so I love me some Pliny. Pliny Pliny Pliny…Here it goes down, down into my belly!  A: A golden straw color hue woven with Angels Hair no doubt. Equipped with a fluffy pure white 3-finger cloud of foam. Bubbling away and lacing ever so nicely.  S: Intoxicating smells of sweetened apricots, tangerine rinds, Cali-greens, sunshine and beautiful women.  T: See “Ambrosia”  M: Superb mouthfeel with a smooth creamy texture, light stickiness and dry crisp clean finish.  D: See “Pliny the Elder”  In my opinion there is no hype behind Pliny. Pliny is the real deal. All other IPA’s can only inspire to be as good as Pliny. While some may come close in comparison, Pliny is the OG of the big West Coast style IPA.

Mouthfeel: Creamyness from Head. Slight carbonation.

863,7971,liamt07,4.5,"Well, damn. Thanks Pino (peensteen) for bringing this out for me, been wanting to get my lips on this since I first got into craft. Mouth was watering the entire bus ride over. Thanks a ton dude. Bottled July 19, 2011 - enjoyed August 29, 2011. Just over a month old.  Poured a golden orange, filtered, with a fluffy white head that fades to some moderate head with great lacing. Nose has some bready grains and pungent citrus hops, unique to anything I've ever put my nose to before. Resiny, tropical fruits and pine all come through in varying degrees. Awesome. Taste has more tropical fruits, bitter pine notes and some sweet maltiness in a lightly sugary way working its magic secondary to the hops. Light alcohol as the sip fades away. Nice medium body, dry finish on every sip. Very bitter finish. Great drinkability, and everything I had expected from this - the gold standard from what I want in a drier DIPA. Fantastic, and I can only imagine this being divine when on tap. Get me more.",Russian River Brewing Company,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,100
863,7971,BigCheese,4.67,"On Tap at Brew Pub in Santa Rosa.  A: A brighter Orange/amber, with a nice fluffy head. Decent lacing.  Smell: Smell is strong, but not boozy strong, definitely a citrus grapefruit/orange/mango scent, some hints of caramel malts in there.  Taste: Wowzers. The essence of hops, I'm not sure what else to say. A Very citrus-sy hops at that, incredible fresh tasting. A wetter hop expirience for sure. Still has a good bready/yeast balance.  Mouthfeel: Great thick oily chewy texture. For 8% dangerously drinkable, medium ammount of carbonation.

Not only is it the most balanced and refreshing IPA I've ever had, but the hop flavors, my god, it was unlike anything I have ever tasted. They melded together into one unified lupulin note that rode a delicious juicy malt wave down my tongue. No harsh bitterness or alcohol present.

Appears a light golden color with about a 3/4"" super white head that dissipated quickly into a small ring. Good lacing.  Smells of malts, pine nuts, and sweet grapefruit. Very typical scents, but they are more balanced than other dipas.  Taste is very balanced and there are no off tastes as are common with others of the style. Hops are muted my the malts and grapefruit shines through. Very little lingering hop bitterness and a slightly dry finish. Awesome.  Mouthfeel is sticky sweet and perfectly carbonated. Slightly tongue numbing, but not tongue tingling like some.  Overall this beer lives up to the hype.

863,7971,nas5755,4.33,"Big Thanks goes out to Futra123 for this awesome beer!  A- Clear golden orangish straw color, with a nice thick head. Amazing retention and solid lacing. All around a very nice looking beer.  S- A heavy dose of citrus and pine. Very well blended  T- A very clean and well blend citrus-pine hop taste. The citrus is focused upon oranges, tangerines and grapefruit. The bitter pine is right there adding a nice resinous progression that is brought on by a very dry finish that reminds me of the citrus notes. The malt is very well balanced in the west coast tradition of DIPA's.  M- Carbonation is on the medium to medium low side but only slightly. Nice smooth mouth-feel, really love the dry finish.  Overall- This is my 3rd time having Pliny and I believe that this is one amazing beer. This beer is the standard by which all DIPA's should be measured by.

A Pours a clear golden amber color that almost looks like apple juice. The head is nice and thick with a nice white color. Lots of bubbles are visible.  S The nose of this one is superb.There are strong grapefruit and pine notes from the hops. Along with a sweet malt note.  T Lots of strong grapefruit notes along with floral and pine notes as well. There is also a lot of biscuit like malt which balances it out perfectly. How a DIPA should taste.  M lots of carbonation but very pleasing.  Overall I now understand why this is considered the standard by how other Imperial IPAs are judged. It is incredibly hoppy and has pretty much everything you could hope for in terms of hop flavors yet it is balanced nicely by the malt.

A: Slightly hazy deep amber, golden-orange color with a creamy white head that reduced to a ring around the edges. Lots of lacing.  S: Perfect bouquet of pine, citrus, and floral hops with a light sweet malt that makes this smell incredibly balanced and delicious. Oranges, pineapple, mango, pine.  T: Zesty hop bite with sweet fruit flavors mixing in with resiny pine. The malt balances things out a bit in the middle but is quickly knocked away again by dry lingering grapefruit flavors.  M: Perfect. light-medium body, medium carbonation. more on the dry side, but still super drinkable and refreshing.  O: Definitely in my top 3 beers of all time, possibly #1.

863,7971,Satchboogie,4.5,"It seems that the more I drink this beer, the better it gets (or perhaps the more I appreciate it?).  2nd Review: 8/9/11 bottle, consumed 9/1/11, poured into a balloon tulip.  A: Pours golden orange yellow, fairly clear, with a 2+ finger tight white head with great retention and picture perfect lacing.  S: Tons of tangerine and tropical fruits (pineapple, maybe mango and apricot), pine and floral notes right behind it. Just a touch of sweet pale malt. Very ripe and fleshy.  T: Definitely better the second time around. Very bright, but mellow citrus and tropical fruits with some floral notes adding a little depth. There's a bit of pine, but not all that much bitterness, at least compared to huge bitter-bombs. There a nice slightly sweetness from a fairly solid pale malt base in the middle. The citrus hops turns soft and fleshy from the middle to finish. Slight pine and lemon/orange peel (pineapple too) finish with little lingering bitterness. Very soft. NO alcohol noticeable at all and I get no unpleasant esters either. The downside is the flavor intensity goes a little limp rather quick as it dies a bit in the middle mouth.  M: Medium to slightly light bodied, moderate carbonation. Extremely smooth and soft for a DIPA, not quite as resinous, sticky, or bitter as I'd like, but it's insanely easy to drink.  O: This is far better than the last batch I tried, much more bright and vibrant with a bigger flavor profile. There is no doubt that this is one extremely well crafted and finest DIPAs on the market. That said, I put this a notch below Hill Farmstead as I prefer that punch of bitterness and more intense hop flavor. I also found that the big, bold flavors lasted forever while the hops in this go really mellow/soft and fade rather quickly. Top 10 DIPA, but not the best I've ever had. ----  My first bottle, 7/19, consumed 8/11. Poured into a wine-style tasting glass. Reviewed from notes:  A: Pours golden pale yellow, surprisingly clear, with about a finger of head. Leaves pretty good lacing.  S: Big citrus and tropical fruit hop nose with plenty of pine and floral notes to balance/add depth to the hop profile. There's a slight herbal dankness in the background. A big, balanced, and juicy hop profile.  T: Follows the nose, but not in intensity. Has a rather soft hop profile with the citrus and tropical fruits and a decent helping of pine resin, though not as potent and bitter as I would have expected. There's a light malt base with just a touch of sweetness, just enough to let the hops shine. Fairly dry finish with a little lingering bitterness.  M: Medium body, very smooth, moderate to slightly light carbonation. Has a soft and clean feel with a fairly crisp finish.  O: While this was a solid DIPA, the taste was a little bit of a let down compared to the nose. I was expecting a big, bold hop profile, but it was rather soft and subdued with just a little bitterness. It kind of reminded me of the difference between Hill Farmstead's Citra DIPA and the Abner/Galaxy (Citra soft while Abner/Galaxy was just huge and in your face). Perhaps this is indeed a tame batch, I'll definitely give the next batch another try. Best DIPA I've ever had? Not this bottle, no. Great, but not the best.",Russian River Brewing Company,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,100
863,7971,NickRivers,4.95,"Bottled about 12 days before enjoying.  A&S - Pours a super hazy, light sunburst orange, with a finger of thin soapy white head. Smells very sweet, pineapple, citrus hops, throughout with faint alcohol hidden away. Smells more refreshing than anything i've ever smelled.  T&M - Hits super crisp and bubbly, tons of sweet but not thick pineapple/citrus flavors, Hops start biting as the crisp fruit turns to alcohol with a ever so gentle kiss of alcohol burn. finishes sweet yet hop aggressive begging you to come back for another sip.  M - Medium, very well carbonated, super drinkable. I must admit and 3 sips I started chugging, got to half the glass, stopped myself, and had an emotional breakdown. Pliny told me things were gonna be okay, just to take it a little slow. So I did. And I enjoyed it.  I must say this beer was everything and nothing I expected. After enjoying Unearthly from Southern Tier and realizing how amazing its Pineapple and Fresh hops qualities were, I told myself theres no way someone can top this. Pliny did. I know its hyped up, but it deserves to be. I gave the appearance a 5 because I love me some cloudiness. The aroma and taste was there but some about the mouthfeel told me 4.5. However!

Very nice scent, with a huge hoppiness right up in the nose (pine and some citrus), and some decent maltiness behind it. Nice flavors, with a nice two-row malty sweetness and a huge piney and slight citrusy hop flavor that is very much in front; good overall, but very unbalanced, even considering the style.

I guess I'm used to more of the east coast style IPA, but it was delightful nonetheless. Solid head.  S - Very strong citrus-like aroma. Quite appealing and inviting.  T - Incredibly smooth and easy to drink. Strong citrus flavor and pleasant hop presence. The bitterness and maltiness are very well balanced.  M - A little thinner than I was expecting, which is not a bad thing in this case. It's quite refreshing on a warm day.  O - While I wouldn't say it is the best beer in the country, as Zymurgy magazine boasts, this is definitely a world-class beer. Maybe the best IPA I've had to date, but it's not something godly as some make it out to be. The ABV, though not incredibly high, is quite deceiving.

A - Light Amber/Slightly copper or brassy color with Big foamy head(maybe 2.5 fingers). Very bubbly white, almost like a Hefeweizen, but disappeared quickly.  S - Rather sweet with hops, citrusy with a little maltiness. Lots of pine, citrus and pineapple. Very nice smelling. I would almost wear this as cologne, haha.  T - Holy Hell. I had heard all of the rumors and hype about this brew, but my god. Very clean and present hop flavor. You can clearly pick out each different hop's favor as it cross the tongue. Big & bold but very balanced in terms of bitterness vs fruitiness. Crisp finish that makes it incredibly drinkable. The after taste after a few swigs becomes rather nutty and lingers for a good while.  M - Watery for a flavorful IPA like this, and very drinkable. This one is almost chuggable (not that I WOULD, but still)  O - I really see why this is at the top of the list on BA. I've been a huge DIPA fan and I love Stone's offerings, but this just rocks my world.

Poured into an Allagash chalice.  A- Poured a clear brighter golden hue that sits a orangey brass color in glass. A 1"" paper white head forms. A mixture of big chunky bubbles and creamy clusters. Great lacing.  S- Lots of fresh cut pineapple. Crisp, smooth hops with some sweetness in the end. Great strong aroma. A touch of tangelo citrus.  T- As good as I remember. Loads of citrus and piney hops upfront. There is a piney resinous quality that comes in the middle. A mellow sweetness lingers in the background. A bitter grapefruit rind note peaks in near the finish. Malt bill is light, but there for some background support.  M- Hops are pretty bold on the palate. Lingering bitterness holds on for a while. Not a palate ruiner but strong. A zesty quality on tip of tongue. Starts wet and only lightly dries. The rind quality stays on palate as well.  O- One of my favorite DIPAs. So easy to drink and enjoyable. This beer is very well priced that i'm constantly blown away. This 500mL was $4, other DIPAs that people claim to rival PtE are often twice as much and don't come close. Always easy to find when visiting my CA family.

Well, the generous leschkie sent me a bottle as an extra, so now I have the opportunity to revisit this one properly. Thank you very much Kurtis! This one was bottled on 06/29/2011 and consumed on 07/15/2011; this review is from my notes.  This beast pours a hazy copper and yellow colored body with about a half inch of foamy, sticky, ghost white head. Ample wet lacing is left in its wake. The nose is greeted with a blast of lemon, grapefruit, other citrus, and hops. Some grass, straw, and piney scents make up the rear. Already, this one screams ""big, west-coast DIPA."" The taste begins with a rush of bitter hops, pine, and straw before lemon and citrus take over. Really just a well balanced, thought out brew. Being so fresh, the malt is nearly indistinguishable, and that is perfectly fine. I wouldn't change a thing about this tasteful experience.

I hope it is still good.  Appearance: Beautiful pour - bright, clear orange body with a large white head that displays great retention and leaves superb lace.  Smell: The nose is absolutely bursting with raw hop power! Citrus (sweet mandarin, white grapefruit and lemon rind), tropical fruit (sweet melon and pineapple) and tons of resinous pine needles.  Taste: As with the nose - world class flavour, bursting with pungent hops overlaid on clean malt. Grapefruit, pineapple, melon, lemon rind, floral notes and masses of resiny pine. Malt is just noted as a slight sweetness before the hops steal the show. With this amount of hop flavour I was expecting my tongue to be violently assaulted by the bitterness and am a little disappointed to find that the bitterness is actually pretty average (could it be the age?) for a big IPA.  Mouthfeel: Medium-full, slightly oily body with perfect, crisp carbonation. Long bitter, hoppy finish and perfect Abv. cover-up.  Overall: Superb IIPA and most certainly the best I have had to date.

863,7971,bigsquirrel,4.42,"Finally got my hands on a Pliny the Elder thanks to a good friend's trading skills.  We were so excited to get this big boy in that we called a few other friends over to taste with us.  I just have to say I was underwhelmed. Maybe it was the hype of this being #2 or #3 overall on BA, but I just didn't think it was necessarily one of the top 5 beers in the world, especially in the IIPA category. This being my first review, it probably isn't going to be the best, but I've had many, many great beers in my years. I just haven't had time to really review them.  Let me start by saying it was great! I thoroughly enjoyed it! However, I followed it with a DFH90 from tap, as a comparison, and truly enjoyed the 90 so much more. Much more flavors. More complexity. Better color and mouthfeel. Not sure what else I can say.  I also had a Founders Double Trouble the next day and felt like it was an overall more balanced, enjoyable brew.  Review notes: We had it in the cooler from the minute we received it, but took it out about 30 minutes before pouring, just to let it warm a little and not be 35 degrees.  The color was a nice, pale orange with a thick, creamy head when agitated. Great hoppiness on the front end, with no real lingering effect. Little flavor on the back end. Didn't get much malt backbone. Don't remember anything in the middle. The PTE tended to just be hoppy to be hoppy, with no real other flavors.  Summary: I know I would be pretty upset if I traded some of my favorites for Pliny the Elder. Not saying I wouldn't enjoy another one, but I didn't feel it lived up to the hype. I'm sure I'm the only one that feels this way, and that's okay.

Smelling this beer, I detect pine, citrus and a little grapefruit note, engulfed by a great selection of hops. Tasting the beer, the more fruity hops are up front, followed by more piny and earthy hops, bringing great balance to the beer.

Bottled on 8/18/11 Hmmm only 7 days old, I've had this beer many times before, but never this fresh, pretty excited.  A- Poured from a 500 ml brown bottle, powerful white puffy head, gorgeous looking yellow to gold body, very pronounced active medium size bubble carbonation. Almost looks like a fine Pilsner, only darker.  S- Ash crisp fresh Grapefruit, pineapple, mint, lavender. Hint of sweetness maybe from the malts more likley from the hops though. Strong fruit acidity, catching some nice floral notes as well. From the smell only this beer is a good buy, especially when its fresh.  T- Medium body, again getting really powerful strong grapefruit and orange, blood oranges to be specific, hints of tart lemon. Aspirin like bitterness at the very end that lingers oh so pleasantly. Surprised to see a melding between fruity citrus flavors and pungent floral aroma and taste. They really did a good job, also hints of mint and lavender I’m picking up as well, really makes this beer unique.  M/O- Has a really nice dry crispness to it, drinkabilty, I could have a few of these so its on the high end of being drinkable, even though it has a high ABV at 8%.  Look, I didn’t want to hop on the bandwagon, and give this beer a A+. However, this really has to be the best IPA I have ever had. I'm a big fan of the style to begin with. So I'm pretty picky about my IPA's. First sip I was convinced. Delicious beer, you have to try it.",Russian River Brewing Company,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,100
863,7971,HoosierInOhio,4.75,"Bottle on 8/2/11 consumed on 8/24/11 first taste at 50 degrees. Picked up on a trip to Seattle 2 weeks ago.  Served in my brand new Pike Brewing tulip glass  A - Gold with a hint of amber, not opaque, 2 finger head. Lacing all the way down until I was finished.  S - Piney, Citrus-y, grapefruit maybe. Underneath you can get a smell of the malts. Excellent smelling beer for sure. I sometimes have a hard time picking up smells but this was no problem. As it warms it was easier  T - Solid through and through. Buttery Smooth as well. Maybe one of the most balanced beers I can remember. Bitter hops at first, followed by malts and it finishes with a slight alcohol zip. Each sip makes you want another. Just great. If there was a text book Imp IPA, this would have to be it.  M - Exceptional.  O - A fantastic beer. Hard to beat on any account. Some may like more hops, some more malts, some more alcohol, but this beer just gets all 3 perfect.",Russian River Brewing Company,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,100

On tap the beer in taste and smell is a bit more ""upbeat"", that is the best way I can describe it.  A -Looks great, medium head that dissipates pretty quickly.  S: Great smell, I just want to continue to smell this beer before drinking it. My wife was in the kitchen when I popped a bottle, she said you smell like beer, nope not me, just the smell from PTE coming out of the glass!  T: This beer tastes great. A bit on the sweet side, especially the bottled version.  M: Feels nice in your mouth, I cant wait to get another sip of it. I feel the taste of alcohol more so in bottle version then tap.  O:This is a great beer, no doubt.

863,7971,detroiter,4.95,"This is an exceptional beer. Especially if you do as the label says and drink it extremely fresh.  I have had this several times from the bottle in a variety of settings, some not the most ideal for tasting beers but it's always delicious.  A- Nice pale orange and translucent  S- like heaven, I mean hops  T- Being a ""hophead"" this is bout as good as it gets, a huge bouquet of floral and citrus hops matched nicely with caramel and sweet malts.

863,7971,Morey,4.7,"500 ML Bottle with bottled 7/19/11 stamped on the side of the label. I'd like it fresher, but sister-in-law picked it up for me while in Cali, and I'm stoked to have it at all.  Pours a beautiful orange color with nice clarity into my Samuel Smith Pint glass which perfectly held the entire bottle (head and all). Good amount of carbonation bubbles in the glass are on their journey northward towards a fluffy white head that stands about an inch tall following a medium pour. Pretty good head retention, and the head itself is still hanging around after several minutes.  Nice big citrus kick in the aroma with orange zest and juicy hops being the most notable. You can tell just by the smell that this is an elite Ipa.  Taste doesn't disappoint either. I'm getting orange and grapefruit right off the bat. A bit of pine as well, and just enough of a malt backbone to make this supremely drinkable.  Medium bodied with spot on carbonation (enough, but doesn't get in the way of the flavors at all).  An elite Ipa overall. More drinkable than most other WC Ipa's.  Morey's Bottom Line: Man, I've been waiting to try this for quite some time, and I can honestly say that it holds up to the hype. I prefer my DIPA's to be hop forward, and not overly malty or thick. This delivers. Actually reminds me a bit of Hopslam. Not identical, but they're similar.",Russian River Brewing Company,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,100

M - Has a nice bitter, hoppy bite. Nice drinkable body. A little bit bubbly.  O - Not the first time I've had PTE, but this brew never lets me down. Its easy to see what the rage is about.

Sweet malts come out as well, striking a rather nice balance with the bitter hops. Just a touch of alcohol comes through.  M - Smooth and crisp with a slightly dry finish.  D - Delicious brew.

863,7971,montecristo2,4.57,"Had this on tap at the Russian River Brewery. Found out they not only make great beer, but awesome pizza and ""Pliny Poppers"" which are jalapeno poppers made in a Pliny beer batter. Awesome!  Beer arrived with a nice two fingered head.  Smells strong of piney hops. Others mentioned grapefruit- I really got the pine and nothing else. I was cool with that, it smelled awesome.  My anticipation to taste this beer was great-I had heard such great things, and I was not let down. The taste was really balanced and delicious. A perfect blend of piney citrus and bready malt-nothing too powerful on either side.  Left nice lacing on the glass.  I had another, bought a six pack for travel, and was a happy man.  *Adding to previous review-had this in bottle format. Totally taste the grapefruit now, and the pine mixed together makes for a splendid smelling and tasting beer. Top notch!",Russian River Brewing Company,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,100
863,7971,CaptCleveland,4.75,"Traded Hunahpu for another historical figure (thanks Azurescens). Bottled on 8/2/11, poured into DFH glass. Clear, honey-amber colored elixir with thin, white head. Plenty of Belgian lace from top to bottom. Citrus, grapefruit predominantly, but also orange/lemon; hints of licorice. Super balanced, medium bodied brew. Hops of course at the forefront, but not overpowering or bitter. Smooth with the alcohol (8%) well hidden. Very tasty. Pliny straddles the line between what I think of as a DIPA vs an IPA. Alcohol is certainly in the DIPA range, but the brew is super smooth and balanced, without the bitterness and alcohol flavor that one expects from a DIPA (see Founder's Double Trouble; FFF Arctic Panzer Wolf; Green Flash Imperial IPA). This would certainly be my go to brew if I lived close enough. There are many who could learn from this fine beer.",Russian River Brewing Company,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,100

Good bitter hops, predominantly citrus/pine resin, with a good hearty malt backbone.  M - Really nice, ABV isnt that noticeable. Smooth carbonation Very drinkable and very oily with the pine resin.

863,7971,TheBrewo,4.43,"This brew pours a toasted amber color. It holds a one and a half finger cream colored head that retains nicely. It holds a latticework of huge bubbles, leaving monster lacing as it goes. Carbonation appears active and there is a faint haze to the beer. Little bubbles stick all around the snifters, submerged under the golden liquid. The nose is a walk through the grapefruit grove. Hops are bold, piney, and citric, with a sweeter twinge of tropical fruit way off on the back. The malts, too, are sweet, with a small toast and pale character. The sweetness goes one step beyond the fruit and the hops, with a dash of raw honey to round off the nose. As we sip, a beautiful balance between bitter hops and sweet hops is stricken. This gives a big grapefruit and citric sweetness, but also a biting grassy pop as well. Through the middle, alcohol moves over the tongue, with more steely bitterness of hop and grain. The flavors become crisper here, with a faint toast to the malt, and surprising darkness (not black, but certainly deeper than pale) that wasn’t palpable in the nose. The finish is with more bright grapefruit and gloriously citrusy hops. The sweetness also returns, with a metallic and sour grain, to offer further balance to the finale. The aftertaste breathes bitterly of more hop, flecks of alcohol, and the tiniest hint of grain. Again, big hops steal the show. The body is medium, and the carbonation is medium. The nicely retained head and bubbles offer a nice creaminess and smack to each sip. The mouth is coated, but quickly dried and left a bit salty. One negative is that we expected a slightly thicker body and feel to it, where at times, it came across borderline thin. The abv is appropriate and the beer drinks with great, refreshing ease.  Overall, what we enjoyed most about this beer was the overt grapefruit in the nose. They really showcased big citrus in the hop department here, making for not only a robust flavoring, but a unique beer in the sense that it didn’t really blend the hops, but rather had them all sing on their own. This is a standup beer for the style, and is something we could sip the summer away with.",Russian River Brewing Company,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,100

I have read many reviews on this beer and have been uber excited to try this one out. hear it goes...  500 ml bottle poured into my stone arrogant bastard pint glass.  A- golden, golden straw like color, about a one finger head, frothy and absolutely delicious looking.  S- definitely smell pine followed by a very sweet fruit smell, almost that of pineapple. notes of citrus present.  T- wow! this beer is awesome!!! strong pine flavor with a strong bitterness. I also taste the sweetness i smelled earlier. definitely citrus, not so much that pineapple i smelled from before.  M- very refreshing, slightly dry finish and not too thick. makes me wanna keep drinking it.  O- I really like IPA's and Double IPA's and basically any beer that is hoppy.

The head slowly subsides leaving a thin layer of fine bubbled froth and a beautiful web of fine delicate lacing on the glass  Aroma: Strong scent of fruits and hops. Sweet pineapple and melon with a bit of citrus. A slight bitterness in the smell.  Taste: A complex balance of hoppiness, yeast, malts, pine , with a bit of sweet fruit and citrus. Slight bitterness at the start that subsides and then comes through again in the finish. The 8% alcohol is nearly impossible to detect. As the beer warms the alcohol begins to peek through, but only to further add to the complexity and ingenious of this beer.  Palette: Soft on the pallet (only increase as the beer warms) with decent carbonation. Slightly dry with the lingering bitterness.

863,7971,stakem,4.3,"I have enjoyed Elder a number of times via draft and bottle. I give the nod to on tap being my favorite experience until this point. Huge thanks to Smoked for bringing a growler of this to my place after visiting Russian River.  Poured into a snifter, this brew appears a golden orange color with some fine particulate floating around in suspension. A creamy off-white finger if head appears and holds fairly well across the top. As it slowly recedes, it leaves a webbing pattern of lacing effect on the glass.  The smell of this brew is exceptionally bright with fresh juicy hop quality. Quite dank and almost cheesy with a bounty of the expected notes of citrus oils and pine resins. More sniffs reveal fruity and floral aspects overtop of a toasty grain base.  The taste is quite toasty with grain that provides a pleasant toasted character without any backing of sweetness. Almost excessively bitter and by that I mean it pierces the tongue with an oily quality that lasts long after each sip. Rind-like bitterness of orange meets grapefruit with an accenting fruity kick of alcohol. The brew gets a little floral as it warms along with grassy notes, sulfur, cheese and dank to herbal weed quality.  This is a medium bodied brew with a modest level of carbonation. Easy drinking and very oily with hops. So bitter yet so enjoyable. Very drying on the tongue thy promotes an easy transition into the next sip. This is without a doubt the brightest and more fresh sampling of Elder I have ever had. Pretty much the only way to top this experience would be to go to the source the day a new batch is released.

Wonderful aroma of, strangely enough, pine hops, warm and inviting with a note of creaminess.  Tastes just like it smells, wonderfully balanced pine bitters with a small dollop of the creaminess in the aroma. Very little sweetness. The bitterness remains on the tongue, lingering for quite a while. Unlike poorly brewed IPAs, the bitterness doesn't fester, remains a tongue sensation rather than an annoyance.

863,7971,amanofbeer,4.92,"It pours beautifully. The bouquet is already obvious and potent, but I'll get there soon...beautiful pale orangish gold not much head or lacing.  I was anxious...was it going to be piney or citrusy, or skunky? Well...it just smells good. A nice combination of the lot. Most certainly some pine, but it really is a huge lot of aroma. I wouldn't call it complex, but it is not basic by any means. The hops are wonderfully blended to the nose.  Beautiful balance. Starts with a citrus and skunk burst, and finishes with a skunky pine, then a dry sort of grapefruit extended lingering. Fairly simple, but extremely delightful.  The only reason I do not award this beer full marks for mouthfeel is that it isn't my style. There is absolutely nothing wrong with it...it has a relatively high abv, but I still like a bit more body. More head and lacing would be appreciated...more dextrin would do this beer a favor.  This beer (especially for the price: $4) was no disappointment. It is a truly artistic chemistry of hop flavors, and I would never have imagined such a balace of skunk, pine, and citrus. I spent the day at my aunt and uncles, with cousins, young and old hanging off of my arms and shoulders.

The smell is wonderful with evergreen/pine and grapefruit on the nose. This is an intense tasting experience, with grapefruit, orange (tangerine or clementine) and pine resin balanced nicely by bready malts.

Nice creamy head on the beer quickly dissipates and leaves some nice lacing. Gold liquid.  S- Hops! And lots of 'em. Lotsa hopsa. Citrus. Pineapple. Maybe even some mango. Smells amazing.  T- Tastes like a dream come true, really. Much like the nose, there's a bomb of citrus and pineapple.

863,7971,Jinholic,4.8,"Finally I get my hands on you Pliny last bottle in the store too guy pulled it out the back and only gave it too me because I was from Phoenix, that guy is the best.  Appearance - Clear orange body lots of bubbles going rapidly upwards. Off-white/cream colored head dies down leaving a thin layer of itself.  Smell - Big bomb of citrus up front, followed by a rush of malts. Topping all this off is a hop bomb making it smell like IPA heaven.  Taste - Sweet malts all the way through this a bit richer than I thought it would be. Up front I get all the citrus hops but that all fades into overly sweetness of the malts on the finish perhaps its only downside.  Mouthfeel - Smooth from start too finish, not refreshing at all with the thickness and sweetness as it sticks too my mouth. With all the carbonation I saw when I poured it I thought it would be a bit crisper but it settled down after a few minutes leaving it much smoother.  Overall - A world class beer is all one hears when Pliny gets its name dropped. Has it lived up too the legend for me though, almost I've got to say the only thing that brings it down is the sweetness it has too it making it a bit much by itself I'd like to pair it with food and see if that takes the edge off on the finish.

A touch of spiceyness and sweetness from the malt help finish off this well rounded beer.  A lot lighter on the mouthfeel than I would suspect hits the tongue just a tad light, but has a nice redeeming creaminess that comes out as the beer glides over the palate.

863,7971,trygger87,4.47,"I have already reviewed this one, and in my previous review i stated iv had it (pliney) many times before. I said it was a three day old bottle. Well this time i managed to get my hand on a bottle that had been bottled with in the last 24 hours :) Its been a while since iv reviewed a beer and iv had some time to let my palate and understanding of craft beer expand. In my last review i gave the Pliney a higher rating on appearance, now that iv experienced more beers of its style i think a solid 4 is what it deserves. Now here's where super fresh Pliney excel's and leaves all other IPA's in the dust (with a Few exceptions, and i mean few). When i smell this Pliney that's been bottled with in a 24 hour period , beer is the last thing im thinking. It smells like tears of joy from God. Extreme tropical fruit, candied papaya dominates up front. Then peach and mango crash the party like, ""oh, you forgot about us, well here we are!!"". Then it finishes with a super sweet smell reminiscent of agave nectar. The taste is pineapple with pine tar, but in a good way. You get the tropical fruit's from the smell but not as much as you would expect (like Averys Maharajah, where the smell translates exactly to the taste). Its a bit more astringent then one would expect from the smell, but none the less a stellar example of what an IPA should be. The mouth feel is bubbly and welcoming. Not cloying at all despite the extremely sweet smell. Excellent mouth feel. This beer clocks in at 8%, wheres the booze? No, and i mean no alcohol taste what so ever. This beer is dangerous!",Russian River Brewing Company,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,100

It doesn't rip my tongue to shreds, it's nice and sweet, and perfectly balanced in every way. I love the way it rounds off in the middle of the drink and then makes me salivate after it's gone down the hatch.  I bought a case of Pliny. I'd like to share before I drink myself to death.

863,7971,rrski198,4.03,"A: Color is a deep yellow to amber color. Not all that complex in terms of hues but the main focus here is the head. Wow! Big and really sticky. The lacing is all over the glass. Nice job  S: Heavy pine dominates the scent. Floral, earthy, citrus peel. It smells thick and creamy, odd? The hops don't smell as fresh and pungent as I would expect from a west coast ipa, its not bad, just not as over the top as other big IPAs.  T: Piney hops come through right up front followed by an awesome creamy bitterness. The alcohol is there but just hangs out nicely in the background. The malt backbone provides just the right amount of sweetness to balance out the hops.  M: Oily, creamy, slight spice form the hops and booze. The bitterness lingers on the back of the tongue and onthe roof of my mouth. Really nice.  O: So i have to take the hype of this beer out of the equation and just try to evaluate it for what it is and how it compares to others i've had. The one thing I would say is that the scent leaves something to be desired, only in comparison to IPAs such as Green Flash and Ruination, which just explode. I'm not saying this beer lacks a quality scent, I have to say that it is not the best. Flavor as well is greatly balanced, but lacks that bite or punch. Might be my personal palate, but this isn't thebest IPA i've ever had, however, it was damn good and I would buy again if i had the chance.",Russian River Brewing Company,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,100

Mine was bottled on 071911 and I tried it on the 25th.  First off, its overhyped. Second, it is amazing in other ways than what I expected. More balanced and more drinkable than I imagined. In my mind I expected a hop bomb, but it was much calmer and easier to drink. Very balanced.  It poured a slightly hazy golden honey color with a medium off white creamy head, great retention, and thick creamy walls of lace.  The aroma was complex and amazing. Pine up front with citrus, grapefruit rind, peach and apricot on the the middle. Clean toasted malts with smooth bitter front end full of floral and grass. Tart, resiny pine.  The taste followed the nose with tons of citrus, grapefruit, peach and apricot. Floral qualities and grass. Nice malt background that is clean with a touch of caramel.  Very well balanced. Smoother and milder than expected. Very drinkable. No trace of alcohol for an 8%.  Overhyped on the hoppiness in my opinion. Underhyped on the balance and drinkability.

There is a kiss of malt in there too for balance. This is a remarkably balanced beer. Pliny has a wonderful hop forward profile but nothing that punches you in the face, it compliments the well rounded and nuanced malt profile which has just enough caramel going on to be interesting but not so much that it ruins the hops party. Moutheel is wonderful. Somewhat silky for an IPA, Pliny has about the perfect amount of carbonation when makes all the flavors pop just right.  This is a terrific beer. There's not much more to say about it, it's as good as the hype and it stands up to repeated drinkings. As much Pliny as I've had (and I've had a lot) I never get tired of it.

It has moderate lacing but that special carbonation that recollects Hello Kitty perfume and locks on diaries. A certain friendliness is embued in its loving gold appearance. It is not 24k in nature, but its adjuncts result in a harder, less malleable experience.  S: There, of course, how could I forget, exists, smells of grapefruit, pine, lemon rind, and citric comma overuse. After so many dates and crestfallen experiences, the number of the Elder becomes a solid staple in your phone, even those moments of weakness, at 2 a.m., when you could just go to sleep, his elderly voice beckons, imparting amazing grassy knowledge.  T: A single taste is like dipping your toe into the river of styx and viewing the scope of past accomplishments and future failures. You get strong notes of tangelo, then apricot, some grapefruit rounds it out with a gentle lull into a juniper bush. You brush a few cones from his threadbare skin and embrace your elder lovingly.  M: The mouthfeel is light but imparts a tart lasting wisdom that lingers an herbal dryness that expands with time. It feels like wading through thick grassy kudzu with a celerity that imparts a lasting knowledge. How you wish you could order more, or warn your old friend of the looming danger that Pompeii holds. Hindsight is 20/20 and such is the case with your elder. Goldfish crackers strewn about your apartment are a testament to same.  D: This is incredibly drinkable beer and your hold on the hem of his robe is none the less tenacious at the final imparting words.

863,7971,magictacosinus,4.97,"This is quite possibly my favorite beer ever, as it's the craft brew that I have drunken the most ever since I discovered it in February. I'm glad to have found a freshly bottled Pliny, which as of this writing is 4 days old. Yay! This was poured into a tulip glass as well to enhance flavor (even though I usually take it in a pint glass).  Appearance: An strong, beautiful orange color unlike any double IPA I've seen yet that's instantly recognizable. A lacy head maintains, carbonation completely disappears as well.  Smell: Pine, citrus, hoppy and fruity aromas everywhere! It smells extremely fresh and as a result every whiff slightly clears my head.  Taste: The overwhelming feel of hops in this beer is obvious upon an initial sip, but it ends up being sweet, flavorful and refreshing by the end. Passion fruit, grapefruit, caramel malts, oranges... the list of varying flavors goes on and on. The high amount of alcohol enhances the sweetness as well.  Mouthfeel: Extremely overpowering on the palate, yet not where it needs to be an acquired taste in order to be enjoyed. The hops remain on the palate viciously, yet the alcohol itself warms up mouth while simultaneously refreshing it. It's damn dry as well. However, I'm not drinking this beer for it to be gentle on my mouth - I'm fully embracing its explosive attack in return for incredible flavors. UPDATE (1/6/2014): I must have been high when I wrote the above description some years ago. After having it fresh out of the bottle and on tap (at the brewpub, no less) for about a week straight over the holidays, I can safely say that it doesn't get better than this in terms of a beer that DOES pack a punch on all bases yet maintains a clean, crisp, pungent drinkable character. Simply put, THIS is the golden benchmark for a strong hoppy American IPA - the hops serve the primary purpose to cleanse the palate after the initial flavor, in the same way a high quality German Riesling does. There's nothing that could be improved here, PERIOD.  Overall: Simply put, an incredible beer that is unlike anything else. Whenever I allow people to taste this beer, even those who usually hate too many hops end up loving it. This is perhaps due to the unreal fruity taste that Pliny has. On tap, it's quite exceptional as well: the malty sweet flavors and hops are released even more strongly, yet just as great. Don't ever pass by a chance to drink this, yet make sure it's as fresh as possible for the full experience!  UPDATE (1/6/2014): If my life could be told through a beer, this would be the one to do it for me. I have so many fond memories with Pliny - more than I could ever give myself credit for. Romance, inspiration, and celebration have crossed paths with me and this beer. It's a beer I'll hold personally close to me for a good long while, and I'm privileged that I still have full accessibility to it so far. No beer is perfect... But in terms of maintaining a strong, pungent flavor, crisp feel, and a wholly diverse flavor profile for pairing with just about any food... Pliny wins. In my life.

I actually blind taste tested this against 3 other DIPA's and had 2 other people try them and they chose Pliny as the least tasteful each time. I thought it was quite boring actually. I mean it was a good drinkable DIPA, but doesn't pack much punch, lacks on the alchohol, and lacks on the hops...maybe thats why it is so popular, is a more of an ""appealing to the masses"" style, rather than a good 13% or so DIPA like many others I've tried that will knock your socks off.

863,7971,BeerAmbassador,4.92,"Poured from a 16 oz bottle into a pint glass. Freshness date is 7/11/11, which puts it at a whopping 9 days old. It's strange, I used to live in northern California about 40 minutes from the brewery and I don't know if I ever got one in a bottle this fresh and now I am in San Diego. Go figure. Pours an ever so hazy orange-yellow. Frothy white head that leaves a little lacing and a thin foam on the top. The aroma virtually defines the word ""hops"" citrus (grapefruit, orange) and pine. A bit of malty sweetness and finally on the end I get another aroma that my friend used to describe as a ""funky aged cheese"" aroma. I thought he was a little crazy for a while, but I think I finally get what he was talking about. I also get a bit of the bubblegum backbone that people are talking about and I guess I would associate that with the malt sweetness I mentioned earlier. Medium bodied on the palate, with a nice bit of carbonation. One of the things I like about this beer is that it is not a thick sticky-sweet DIPA. It actually finishes fairly dry. That brings me to what might be my favorite and most impressive thing about Pliny. The balance. I think that in here at Beer Advocate and in the beer world in general, balance is under-appreciated. People get a taste for hoppy beers and they seek out more and more extreme examples of them. The beauty of this beer is that it has incredible complexity both in hops and malt, but one never totally dominates the other. In my opinion that is much more difficult to do than make an over the top hop bomb.

Not my first RR offering, and typically hype may push me to try a beer, but it doesn't make me a believer, or keep me drinking. If anything, hype typically ruins an otherwise decent beer. I expect sooo much, when if fails to live up to it, I rate it badly.... Well, this isn't one of those beers. There is hype behind it for a reason. Although, be forewarned, if your looking for a pure hop bomb, This is NOT your beer.  A- Wow, for a DIPA, very light I'm color. A slightly burnt yellow. Not quite orange, topped with a finger of white medium bodied head, leaving a very nice lacing.  S- Mmmm, pineapple, grapefruit, mango, crisp pine, and a little bubblegum at the finish. Nothing over powers, all is balanced and clean. Sublime  T- Very similar to the nose. I get all the same tropical and citrus fruit, especially the mango and grapefruit. Subdued malt adding a nice balance. Hop presence is more subdued than I was expecting, but definitely hoppier than the Blind Pig. This isn't a hop head's wet dream, but a masterfully crafted DIPA, focused more on balance, and precision.  M- Lighter than expected, just like the appearance would suggest. Not overly sticky like a lot of DIPAs. Nice carbonation, lifts it off the tongue, and even as it sat and warmed a bit, still no tackiness in the palate.  O- Outstanding, now I know I didn't rate it as a perfect A+, but..well, it's that hype this at work. I think because of the hype, I almost didn't want to like it, but, it was amazingly good.

Almost hard to grab it, kind of teasingy/cloying  The appearance is light, almost a perfect color for an IPA, but not quite the darkness customary for a IIPA, not a bad thing though. A nice, rustic golden color.  Taste is hoppy and bright, but almost reserved for a IIPA. If this were a single IPA it could most likely be the best IPA I've ever tasted. I'm not entirely sure that it deserves the hype but I'm not going to debit it for that either, it's solid, very much so. The alcohol is almost completely masked by the earthy floral of the hops, and the flavors blend into a cohesive unit, very well integrated.

A great example of a well-balanced DIPA, plenty of hop character but offset by the malts.",Russian River Brewing Company,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,100
863,7971,ltjska04,3.78,"I've been waiting to get my hands on this beer for years, and my future mother-in-law just returned from a trip to Napa Valley and brought a single bottle of Pliny the Elder home for me. To my pleasant surprise the bottling date was 7/11/11... 5 days ago! Let's get to it!  A- Clear orange/amber with a fluffy, sudsy white head that recedes to a thin film with clumpy white islands and lacing on the sides of my snifter. A single stream of tiny bubbles emerge from the bottom of the glass.  S- Tropical fruit/citrusy, piney, a little herbal, a hint of wood? Grapefruit with a bit of sweetness... while lots of hop characteristics are present it isn’t the hop explosion I was expecting.  T- Hoppy, but not overly so. The malt is there to balance the bitterness with a bit of honey-like sweetness. The bitterness lingers a bit but it is not that strong. The flavor seems a bit flat and muted. For this fresh a bottle I thought the hop flavor would be overflowing. This seems like it'd be a very sessionable beer if it weren't for the higher ABV; the flavor isn't overpowering but I could drink it all night.  M- This is probably the driest DIPA I’ve every had. I feel like it’s lacking carbonation; higher levels would bring the hop flavor out more. The body is thin for the style.  O- Overall, I hate to say it, but I’m disappointed. This bottle is only 5 days old but tastes much older. I don’t know if it was the cross-country trip or some other issue but this isn’t what I expected. I’ve had many better DIPA’s that are a lot easier to come by in my area. I would definitely drink this again but wouldn’t go out of my way to obtain it.",Russian River Brewing Company,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,100
863,7971,RodneyX,4.7,"Beer pours an orangish color with some yellow and a big white head. Left a lot of great lacing on the sides. Smells of super pine hops and just a little bit of malt. Lots of citrus and other things going on, smells great. The taste isn't any type of let down, with great pine hops and things that turn bitter on the end. It doesn't have tropical fruit notes that other ones do, more of a piney grapefruit beer. Really like this one, fantastic on tap.",Russian River Brewing Company,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,100
863,7971,sergeantstogie,4.85,"Bottled on 062911.  As hard as it was to score the two bottles I really had to resist the urge to hold on to my bottles and give in to Vinnie's advice on the bottle to drink it fresh. I am very glad I did.  This has been a summer of many very good IPAs and IIPAs. The trend being bigger and bolder. My assumption was Pliny was going to be the biggest, baddest, boldest asskicker of an IIPA on the block. My first taste corrected that assumption and in the same moment gave me a more profound understanding of the other Russian River beers I have drank recently.  Pliny poured a gorgeous glowing gold. It looks like the mystery contents of Marcellus Wallace's brief case when viewed by Vincent Vega.  The smell is pure grapefruit.  The taste is grapefruit as well, but not over powering. Many of the IPAs and IIPAs I have had recently in brewpubs boast loud and proud about the perfection achieved in the balance of their product's bitterness, aroma and malt flavor. However, Pliny absolutely nails it. No one flavor is competing to out do any of the others. It is a very happy marriage of citrus, slight pine, tiny hint of dank and a ridiculously smooth and ever so sweet and clean malt background.  The mouthfeel is light and airy.  Overall, as I said in the beginning, this beer gave me a profound understanding of what exactly it is Vinnie is up to at Russian River. His beers are subtle in the way any man who is sure of his abilities can be subtle. In confidence, a well crafted beer can be flavorful, strong and smooth all at the same time. It is only when one of these qualities is out of balance that the need to call attention to itself arises. All of the Russian River beers I have had so far have shown this. Pliny better than the rest!",Russian River Brewing Company,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,100
863,7971,ibryce,3.9,"This beer is good. I don't understand why people freak out with A+ ratings. For me, Ninkasi's ""Maiden the Shade"" is a better choice for a similar beer.

863,7971,Kubus,4.45,"Poured from a 500mL bottle purchased at the Russian River brewery into a highball glass in a San Francisco hotel.  A: Pours a nice golden yellow with a nice fizzy head which bubbles away quickly and leaves a nice white ring around the glass. Very fizzy with no cloudiness.  S: Mango, papaya, rosemary, a hint of hops, peach, orange, and many other citrus scents (Tangelo?)  T: Begins with a rush of citrus and papaya flavour, very nice. Follows up with some pine and rosemary and concludes with a light hop aftertaste. Very gentle, doesn't ruin the flavour with a huge hop aftertaste, just reminds you what you are drinking.  M: For a DIPA this is extremely smooth, actually I would venture to say it is one of he gentlest beers I've ever tasted. Light tastes wash over your tongue over and over, none really overpowering, all well balanced.  O: after being disappointed by Supplication, this beer was a welcome change. Again it is fairly overhyped by BA, but the difference is that this one at least comes close to matching the hype.

863,7971,VicSlick,2.21,"I dont know I f I got a bad batch of this beer but it is definitely NOT WORTHY OF AN A+!  Bought four pint bottles from Whole Foods Cupertino. Thre reason I bought four is because I was expecting an awesome brewski.  Appearance is average. It pours a Budweiser Yellow. Lets be honest.  Smell is okay. I dont really judge any beer off its smell.  Taste. This is where it gets weird. I took the first sip of beer and I tasted the intense flavor of ALCOHOL. I know a Double IPA is gonna be a strong beer but the smell and palate feel was that of a post vodka shot. I hope this is a bad batch, cause I really wanna enjoy this beer. I just didnt.  Mouthfeel. SEE TASTE.  Overall, I would not pay $5 a pint for a beer I had a bad experience with ever again, but if a friend buys me one, I would be open to trying it again in hopes that the batch was on point.",Russian River Brewing Company,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,100
863,7971,jmarsh123,5,Finally got the opporitunity to try this while on my business trip to SD.  Wow this is everything I had hoped for. Poured a hazy orange. This is literally one of the most beautiful beers I've ever seen. The color is just outstanding. Too bad I can only go 5.0 on here. Very little head and some lacing down the glass.  Smells of grapefruit/citrus with a little bready malt presence.  Taste is a hops overload of delicious citrus with a nice strong bitter finish.  Lighter bodied for a DIPA which is perfect for me. The hops really shine through on this and before I knew it I had drained the whole pint with little effort. I just wish I had a way of getting this close to home.,Russian River Brewing Company,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,100
863,7971,ajsdad06,4.47,"500 ml bottle poured into a snifter.  Pours a clear orange amber color with a small fine white head. The fact that this looks like many other IPA's doesn't do the rest of the experience justice.  The aroma upon opening the bottle was inviting: caramel and toffee melded with a bevy of fruits (citrus, grapefruit, pineapple,), pine and floral notes.  The flavor balances nicely between the moderately sweet caramel maltiness and the bitterness of the hops; pine, floral, and resiny. I don’t get much in the way of alcohol, probably because the aroma and flavor are too distracting. This is an excellent beer. Medium-full bodied and super easy to drink. I can’t wait to try this on tap someday.",Russian River Brewing Company,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,100

I had this on draft at O'Brien's in San Diego years ago and remember loving it, but this is my first review.  Pours a light amber/dark gold in color with a big foamy head that reduces to a thick layer with lots of lacing. Hard to improve.  Deep earthy, herbal and citrus aroma from the hops, with a hint of alcohol.  The taste is bitter and hoppy, but still restrained somewhat. I was expecting a big bitter beer, but this tastes almost balanced. Don't get me wrong, it's good, just not excellent. I'm surprised, I was expecting more. I don't believe this bottle is old at just past a month from bottling?  I would consider this an approachable double IPA.

Tons of hops but some balance as well. Nice citrus hops with some earthyness mixed in.  Mouthfeel is a bit bigger than I expected but inline for this style. Taste is row after row of hops.

Citrus, orange, grapefruit, with a pine backing. It smells nice enough. It's not quite as vibrant as I would have liked. The taste follows the nose with all the fruit and pine. The midpalate seems a bit lost and hollow. The flavor is good but it's not deep. Pleasant upfront, with a dead spot near the center, finishing with nice bitterness and an exhale of hops.

Not quite a Sculpin, but beautiful none the less.  S: Gotta love those powerful floral hops that are accompanied with subtle hints of grapefruit and pine.  T: Gotta say, the smoothest DIPA I have had to date. It maintains perfect balance between its ingredients and allows each one of them to make their presence without being overpowered by the rest. Perfection!  M: Crisp, clean, medium bodied brew that tingles ever so slightly as it goes down the throat.

You get hints of pine and very mellow caramel. Also evident are the smells of peach and tangerine followed the zesty grapefruit and pineapple.  Palate: The drinkability of this beer is sublime.

863,7971,dnrobert24,3.92,"First of all, I love Russian River. I've been looking forward to trying this beer for a long time. Well, the time has come. The beer pours a nice golden orange with a decent head that settles into a thin ring. Aromas are beautiful: Sharp acidic citrus fruit, grapefruit namely, with pine undertones. No doubt this is a west-coast IPA. The hops and malts play nicely with each other on my tongue--dry saltine crackers and oranges with dabs of piney herbs. All-in-all it is an extremely balanced IPA, but at 8% ABV, I'm tasting booze way more than I should be. Unlike some IPAs, I did not regret reaching the end of the glass. Certainly worth seeking out at convenience-store prices, but please don't go mortgaging your home for BA's number 3!",Russian River Brewing Company,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,100
863,7971,Klym,4.68,"A: I'll be damned if this isn't one of the prettiest DIPAs ever brewed. Pours a majestic, clear gold with just enough haze to it to indicate its flavors. The head comes up at just the right pace and slowly drifts down from an attractive two finger to a small but really respectable layer. Lacing all around the glass from where the head previously was. This beer is beautiful, it almost seems fake it looks so good.  S: Pine is all over this with a complex web of tropical fruits and a little citrus sewn into the smells. Really full aroma with some biting power from the hops and pine/resiny smells, but mellowness given to it by the sweetness of the fruits.  T: So nice. Tones of pine/resin/citrus running all over the tongue and following up with a sweet tropical dessert that still pays homage to the original flavors. This is excellent.  M: Whenever I drink this I feel like someone is almost lathering my tongue with the beer then dumping more into the rest of my mouth. It has a really fantastic mouthfeel, and I don't think much complaint can be made about it. This also has done awesome and retaining a consistent mouthfeel and level of carbonation from start to finish in the drink.  O: When I first had Pliny the Elder I actually said I didn't like it (on tap at the brewery). This was no commentary on the quality though, but rather that I had just gotten into craft beer, saw that at the time it was number one on the top 100 of BA, and had such ridiculous expectations that it was only possible for it to disappoint me. Since that time I've had a lot of beers, I've had a lot of IPAs/DIPAs, and returning to it now I can say that this beer is truly fantastic. If you haven't had it, don't panic and trade an arm and a leg for it because it's not going to destroy your world but definitely get it because it will deliver you a top notch, as-good-as-it-gets DIPA experience.",Russian River Brewing Company,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,100

I inhale again, this time deeply - and pick up fresh-cut grapefruit, a glacier-fed mountain creek, and a cool breeze whispering through lonesome moonlit pines and bare Sierra granite.  The first sip is aromatic hops up front - but then the malt asserts itself with just the slightest hint of booze. Mouthfeel is smooth and seductive, begging me to take another sip. So I do.  What puts this beer above so many others is its exquisite balance; it's Beethoven in a glass. The aroma, taste, mouthfeel, malt, hops, alcohol, water - all work in harmony, and also with restraint, with every sip. And even the occasional, indulgent gulp.

863,7971,Cavery,4.6,"500ml bottle dated 6-11-11, into Oversized Wine Glass; after work offering. I was pleasantly surprised to find this in Bristol farms while looking for Black Butte XXIII in Palm Desert, CA. This is the first time I've seen Russian River in my local store, and I felt like I had to be supportive of this by purchasing 6 bottles. This might have also been due to the lack of bottle limit by the store (haha, they'll catch on soon enough).  A: Orange marmalade with a healthy dose of honey. A two finger soap sud head rises like biscuits over strong currents of carbonation. This is quite a large head considering the wide mouth of the glassware, and it should be noted the head left massive curtains of lacing. Honestly, this is a cover shot of a lot of beer magazines.  S: Very juicy grapefruit dominates a citrus forward nose. Light sweet grasses and very clean fresh rinds reassure the drinker of the brews freshness. A rather flirtatious nose that is more suggestive of craft than it is of a lack of flavor. You can almost sense the bursting flavor by the smell.  T: This is just such a fine blend. The way the whole grapefruit plays with your taste buds is just incredible. First you get the hop-infused rind, then the flesh for days, and then the rine again. It's like you get to ride on the magic schoolbus through the most wonderful grapefruit you've ever had. Perhaps the cleanest and most refined hop linger in the business. Cumquat rewards the completion of your journey with an aftertaste that never seems to go away. Just astronomical drinkability for an 8% DIPA. If this drink was a book, it would be called James and the Giant Grapefruit. It's that good.  M: The mouth very much follows the theme of the taste. A flirtatious bit of tingling that explodes into big bubbles. Just like a great song with a great buildup, you get goosebumps all over. While that might have something to do with the alcohol, you'd swear this event was mutually exclusive. In any case, the mouth-feel brands you with an experience that forces you to pay homage to the elder.  O: The elder is truly one of the greats. A lot has been said to tarnish the throne that Pliny has sat upon for a long while now. However, this does little to change it's status among the very best DIPAs. Every time I'd try to take a gentlemanly sip, I'd find myself choking through the third swallow. The drinkability is practically beyond a matter of free-will. There is a magnetic relationship between the glass and the drinker's stomach. The key to enjoying pliny is quite simple: Drink pliny with your mouth, and not your ears or your eyes. If there is a DIPA on the west-coast that is deserving of hipster cults, then it is this one. After all, it is only natural that something this good develop some. In any case, Pliny itself remains unchanged, and the institutionalization of store purchase limits remains unquestioned. Pliny the elder is crazy delicious, a worthy flagship of west-coast IPA's. I will not say it is the monarch that it is sometimes claimed to be, but it is certainly a member of the distinguished nobility.  PS&gt; I am glad to see that the first time having it out of a bottle did not disappoint. Anyone who has this fresh is getting the real-deal.

Those in the Southeast like me, know it is impossible to find this without either going to the west coast to get it or through a trade. In this case I actually did both to get it. Thanks a ton to jeff1973 for the trade. You are the man!  Pours golden/copper-ish with a one finger white head. Dissipates to a thin layer and leaves patchy lacing.  Smells of grapefruit at first. Initially didn't detect much of the pine that I recalled from the previous bottle I had of this. But halfway through the glass the pine showed up and actually began to dominate the nose with the grapefruit playing a supporting role. Interesting how it changed like that. The layering of hops that Mr. Cilurzo has created with this brew is truly remarkable.  The initial taste is also grapefruit. Good supporting malt character. A nice bite lingers on the tongue well after each sip. But it's not overly bitter. It's just the right amount of bitterness to balance the hop flavors and the malt. Slight alcohol warmth.  Medium to full bodied. Feels thick when it first hits the tongue, and leaves the lips a little bit sticky.  This beer is about as good as it gets. Comparing it to any other top rated beers is like splitting hairs.

Honey colored and hazy with minimal carbonation noticeable. Very thick lacing.  Smell: Heavy dose of hops slaps you in the face before the cap is all the way off. Flavors of pine and tropical fruit. Begs to be sipped.  Taste: Heavy dose of juicy hops hits immediately, pine and lots of grapefruit rind. Although it's extremely hoppy, Pliny is nicely balanced which makes it very refreshing. Finishes sharp and lively leaving behind a slight flavor of grapefruit that reminds you that it's time to take another sip.  Mouthfeel: Medium bodied, extremely lively and sharp, the combination makes this brew feel rather thick.  Overall: Quite an impressive IPA. Bitter yet smooth and refreshing. Probably one of my top three (along with Victory Hop Wallop and Southern Tier Unearthly).",Russian River Brewing Company,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,100
863,7971,angrybabboon,5,"Cheers to Goblinmunkey7 for not one, but two of these... and a pint from a fresh growler  Review adapted from notes taken 12/21/11  Note: 100th review posted to BA, 1st and only beer thus far that I feel earns a solid 5.0  Appearance: Pours a beautiful golden orange, mostly clear, perfectly carbonated with a nice white head that fades to subtle sticky lacing  Smell: Incredible - amazing mix of hop aromas - pine, resin, citrus - various hints of tropical fruits, pineapple, mango, tangerine - it's like sticking your nose into a fresh bag of hop pellets, minus any herbal or grassy harshness - the nose seriously has everything that I enjoy about hops - some lightly toasted malts in the background  Taste: Personally mind-blowing - the hops are bitter, yes, but they do so much more - so many flavors, as mentioned above - resin, citrus, pineapple, etc. - the flavor of the hops is utterly absurd, but it's somehow not over-the-top - the malts are light, flavorful, impart a nice, delicate sweetness that adds the perfect amount of balance - honestly, the balance that this beer has doesn't even make sense  Mouthfeel: Medium bodied, well-carbonated, smooth - not very heavy despite the absurd amount of flavor, but not too light, either - refreshing  Overall: Currently my second favorite beer of all time  I wish I could say that this beer was all hype. I think that would make me feel cool and edgy. But that is not the case. The first time I had this beer was on-tap at the Falling Rock Tap House in Denver, CO. After my first sip, I think my brain exploded. I was simply incapable of talking or being a functional human for a good 10 minutes. When I had this again, I learned that it wasn't a fluke. This is liquid magic.  Update: May 11, 2012 After not having this for over six months, I find myself enjoying another bottle. Tropical. Balanced. Majestic. Classic. However, I must admit that Heady Topper may be taking my ""second favorite beer of all time"" slot. It's really unfair to compare these two DIPAs, however, as they approach the style so differently. The profiles of the malts and hops are so very different. And while I need some time to recover from Heady Topper's assault of hops, I think I could drink Pliny the Elder every day. Hmmm...  Update: May 27, 2012 Drinking another bottle, less than a month old. This is a masterpiece. I love Heady Topper, but the drinkability of PtE secures it into the number two slot. Dilemma resolved.",Russian River Brewing Company,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,100
863,7971,huhl23,5,"I tried this double IPA on tap at the Russian River Brewery, and it was a focal point of my trip out to California. Needless to say I was not disappointed! The serving was in a standard pint glass, which sort of surprised me; I was expecting a 10 oz. pour. The nose of the beer was incredibly floral, which gave a good indication of the hefty hop presence. [Being a hop-head I was very happy with the level of hops included in this beer] The mouthfeel was somewhat standard compared to other double IPAs I've tried, but the taste lasted just long enough to entice another sip. I would definitely say that I thoroughly enjoyed this beer, and would recommend it highly to anyone who can find it. My only problem with this beer is that it is very difficult to get on the west coast.

863,7971,UnionMade,4.35,"Bottle dated 050311, picked up at Argonaut in Denver. Poured into a Stella glass. Very pretty golden tree sap color (that would actually be amber, wouldn't it?) topped with about an inch worth of fluffy white foam. A soft haze, with suspended particles as i look into the glass. The froth laces pretty well, and keeps with a nice, solid topping over the beer through most of the glass. Smells predominantly of resinous, piney hops. Very aromatic, with a gentle malt sweetness behind. Really nice and clean, with little in the way of estery fruit or anything of that nature. Of the flavor, my very first impression, which sets this apart from other brews, is the soft, super fine carbonation. The mouthfeel is heavyset and sturdy, yet surprisingly delicate. Kind of like that fat friend that can dance really well. Hops dominate the flavor throughout, providing citrus up front with the toasty malt sweetness, and moving into something more piney and earthy towards the end. The alcohol is very well hidden, and this is nothing but drinkable. A bit of yeast flavor, coming off as cookie-like, in the back end. I can really taste this as a step above the standard craft beer offerings I drink on a regular basis. There's something intangible about it. A different level of complexity, or something more ephemeral. That being said, I'm not getting much out of this that's vastly different than something another great California brewery couldn't do just as well, except that you can pick up their flagship brew at just about any store that sells beer. I'm thinking that there might be just a little hype behind the limited availability. Really nice, but I'm a bit disappointed about the limited quantities. I guess this beer would lose some of it's luster if i could pick one up whenever i liked, so preserving it for an occasion is something special. A great brew, even if the limited availability has an effect on the scores.",Russian River Brewing Company,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,100

A- Light orange color with a nice quarter inch head that disappears, but leaves \a nice foam on top  S- Floral and citrusy as always, but I have to say I am a little disappointed it doesn't smell any fresher to me than one that was bottled a couple weeks ago.

863,7971,Blakaeris,4.47,"Pours a clear bronze-orange color with a decent head that hangs around awhile, leaving globs of sticky lacing.  Aroma is mild pale and biscuit malt. Then dense tropical citrus hop takes over along with a good bit of resinous pine.  Taste is what the nose lead me to expect, but much more intense. Biscuit and caramel malt up front. Then the grapefruit bitterness takes over with a hop oil resinous quality. Finishes dry and bready with plenty of light tropical fruit notes - notably melon and pineapple. Alcohol presence leaves a slight warmth.  Mouthfeel is medium bodied, slick and resinous.  A very tasty and easy to drink DIPA. Although the grapefruit hops are dominant, the biscuit malt also has a solid presence bringing balance and depth of flavor.",Russian River Brewing Company,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,100
863,7971,bashiba,4.35,"It looks great, perfectly clear bright orange with a huge pillowy head.  Has a very nice green fresh smell, very fresh light pine and citrus.  The flavor is very balanced, suprisingly malty, a very english bready toasted malt flavor mixing in nicely, very green with light citrus notes.  The mouthfeel is light with a bit of hoppy resin leaving a nice light coating.  Very nice IPA, flavorful without being over the top. Complex and a bit understated at the same time.",Russian River Brewing Company,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,100
863,7971,PatLarsen,4.5,"The beer pours a slightly hazy orange/amber color with a big foamy white head that slowly recedes leaving behind lots of lacing. There is a steady stream of carbonation throughout the life of the beer. The aroma fills the room with floral, piney hops as soon as the cap is popped on this gem. The aroma really opens up as the beer is being poured and starts to showcase some citrusy notes as well. No real malt aromas to speak of The flavor is bursting with piney, floral hops. Not nearly as much citrus in the flavor as in the nose. Surprisingly there is really not much in the way of alcohol presence, hard to believe this is a 8% beer. Medium bodied and smooth with a moderate amount of carbonation and a dry finish. Really quite good, and I can see why it is rated world class.",Russian River Brewing Company,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,100
863,7971,azdback,4.32,"Poured into a Spaten tumbler. Bottle dated 05/24/11. Bright pale orange, almost yellow color. Very clear and filtered in appearance. Lots of tiny carbonation bubbles lead to a bright white two finger head that is soapy to sea foam looking. The lace sticks in a nice patchy pattern.  Smell is absolutely fantastic!! Lots and lots of bright, fresh fruity smells. There is some grapefruit rind, pineapple, some orangey sweetness. These are all balanced nicely with musty bread, and big pale malts. As it warms, the yeast is taking center stage in the nose.  Taste is quite bright. I think I will describe this as, grapefruit oil, wrecking bitter... at least at first. There is some sweetness I don't taste on my tongue, but lick off of my lips. I am really stretching here but as it warms a bit more I do get just a bit of orange sweetness. I am not getting a whole lot of the malt I remember the first time I tried this. The alcohol is very well masked also.  The mouth is fantastic as well!! Bright and effervescent. Very easy to drink and dry at the end. The bitterness from the citrus wipes the tongue clean.  Overall, As the nose and mouth on this blew me away the taste really fell short for the category.

863,7971,BarryMFBurton,5,"Here it is, the greatest beer in the world (according to you BA’s): Pliny the Elder. I turned 21 only three months ago, and here I am now, savoring a classic. It’s amazing how quickly the culture of craft beer just sucked me in; I don’t think I’ll ever find a more engrossing hobby. I love it!  “BOTTLED ON: 050411.” A month and a half of age on Pliny might be too much in some people’s eyes, but good enough for my first try. I promise, though, that I will update this review whenever I sample a fresher batch. In fact, put that on my bucket list: one day, I will have a Pliny on the same day it was bottled. It’ll be tough for a guy living in Indiana, I’ll admit, but I’ll find a way.  Thanks again to dmsohyea for this great moment in my beer journey. You rock!  A: Pours a shining gold-amber – the body is brilliant. Not a lot of breweries achieve that vivid luster, but this one absolutely does; no question. The head comes out fast and fat, presenting a delicious white creaminess at the top of the glass. It’s very inviting; in fact, whipped cream is the first thing that comes to my mind when I scope out the foam. A ton of bubbles run up from the bottom of the glass as well, which, along with the thick lacing, provides ample energy in the body’s visual. It looks fresh and friendly, to say the absolute least. I wish more beers put off that vibe, especially when it comes to pale ales. Can’t wait to take a whiff…  S: Such a succulent hop aroma! Mango, grapefruit, pineapple, apple, grape…the fruits grow with every waft. Bready, slightly roasted malts and farm-fresh wheat scents combine to form a moist, green bouquet. THAT fragrance, not an ultra-bitter hoppiness, is the true heart of an India Pale Ale; this fits perfectly into that style definition. Excellent execution. There’s some residual sugars as well, with caramel, molasses, and marmalade syrups hidden beneath the most prominent characteristics in the nose. Intriguing and fresh – the true spirit of an Imperial IPA!  T: It’s hard to describe a beer like this. It’s like the funniest movie you’ve ever seen, or a book that constantly keeps you turning its pages – everything that it’s supposed to do, it does (without a hitch). “Wow” is all I can really say. A mellow smoothness comes over the entire palate, within the same realm as the freshness in the nose. It’s homey and again, farm fresh. The hops are very interesting, almost baffling at times; I mean, how can they be so bold without being harsh at all? That incredible quality must be why this beer is one of the greats. Anyway, the hops are fruity first, with a nod to everything mentioned in the nose (plus cherry/berry and citrus zest). The balance is incredible, though, with thick malted barley gracefully appearing soon after the hop blast. They are well done, too, settling comfortably right on the edge of light sweetness and syrupiness – it’s perfect for the palate. As far as the symmetry between sweet and bitter goes, I would honestly say that it’s the best I’ve ever had in a pale ale. The yeast that shows itself in the endgame is very subtle (as is the case with many DIPA’s), but it works. Its lively, acidic character doesn’t need a huge platform to make an impression here. All in all, there’s really only three words that can describe this: perfect palate craftsmanship. Nothing short of legendary taste.  M: I was a little bit worried about Russian River’s performance here. Really, the feel of an Imperial IPA can change so much about how the drinker perceives it; even more than in other styles. If it’s too thick, it can turn the whole thing syrupy, and if it’s too thin, a less-developed palate can really show through as watery. I’m glad to say, though, that RR achieved the best possible scenario here, too. It’s light enough to be good for the style and super-drinkable, but just heavy enough to show that it’s meant to be taken seriously as a sipper. This area gets another world-class rating from me.  O: Balance, balance, balance. An incredible array of tastes and textures like this shows so much care and awareness on the part of the brewer; Russian River deserves every bit of the recognition they get. And once I get my super-fresh-Pliny bucket list situation figured out, I’m sure I’ll agree even more.  The reason I love beer, condensed into sixteen ounces. It doesn’t get any better than this.",Russian River Brewing Company,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,100

Dank pungent smell of resinous pine, with hints of tropical citrus fruit and floral hops.  Taste is also incredibly potent pine at first, grapefruit and more pine in the middle, and a crisp tropical piney finish. I don't pick up any specific malt flavor, yet it tastes incredibly balanced. The taste of hops is potent but not overpowering by any means, the bitterness in the finish is fairly low, making it very easy to keep drinking.  Very smooth, medium carbonation. Sticky coating that doesn't last too long, giving it a mostly clean and crisp finish.  This skirts the line between IPA and DIPA with its incredible balance, drinkabilitiy, and slightly low ABV for the style.  This beer gets a lot of (sometimes negative) hype about being a hop bomb.

T- Lot's of tropical fruit including pineapple and mango. Some peach, orange zest and grapefruit and sweet malt follow after. Very well balanced.  M- Medium carbonation and medium bodied. Slight oily mouthfeel that coats the tongue.  O- Not really adding much here, but it's indeed one of the best IPA's available.

863,7971,dleemiller,2.99,"I was quite surprised to find a bottle of this in Steamboat, CO. It seems to be a rarity in most parts. As a lover of all things IPA, I had high expectations, which were not met.  Before drinking the beer, I probably knew less about it than most who purchase it. I like my IPAs heavily dry hopped, but the pleasantries of the dry hopping procedure were greatly overwhelmed and sidelined by the bittering hops. I was somewhat uncertain that the beer had even been dry hopped. I also felt the beer was overly thin in the mouth resulting from a total lack of malt.  Overall, I found the beer quite uninteresting. I'd be willing to try it again from tap, but not in a bottle. Maybe it loses its qualities in travel, but it could not have been very old, considering the extremely short length of time it's available in store coolers. I suspect that the hype for this beer has been manufactured by limiting the supply, as I can think of at least a half dozen DIPAs that I would prefer.

First I get the citrus hops, tangerines and sweet-bitter grapefruit.  Midway  there is a subdued bready malt, quickly followed by more bitter grapefruit.  It finishes with a piney resin, which also stays around to provide a very pleasant, dry aftertaste.  Mouthfeel is medium body, low-medium carbonation, and leaves an oily hops film.  Very nice.

Smell is surprisingly sweet through the citrusy hops. So well blended in the aroma that nothing stands out, yet everything does at the same time.  Taste- the hops make this beer exceptionally bitter and blends well with the maltiness. The beer is also heavy on the citrus (grapefruit) tones from the hops. There are rich spicy notes that occassionally creep in. This beer finishes with a lingering grassy taste. The taste is long and full.  Mouthfeel- this beer is full bodied and has such a lingering aftertaste that the beer feels heavier than it really is. It feels crisp, fresh, but still has a long and flavorful finish.

Who said hops arent a drug?!?! This is king of all DIPA/IPAs in regard to aroma, in my humble opinion.  Taste is a little tang sweet upfront with the tropical fruits coming through very nice & smooth. Wow! This is one tasty beer. I was expecting a tad more hops & thickness. For a DIPA, this one is really light and not so hoppy. Its just right for being on the tropical side. Everything blends together nicely. In the aftertaste, the hop bite can be found - but it isnt a Hercules of a bite.  Purchased this one through a vendor who shipped to FL. Got 2 bottles of PtE + a bottle of Supplication for $38 (including shipping).  I dont think I will be getting this on the regular since it is really expensive to get shipped out here.

No alcohol at all, super smooth drinking.  M- Light-Medium; Really smooth and creamy but doesn't get that wateriness that some other beers get from being the soft.  O- Awesome double IPA.

Finger-finger and half head with a lot of perseverance. Golden straw, honey, yellow color.  S - Mango/papaya explosion. Pine needles, white flowers, shortbread, honey.  T - That same tropical fruit blast accompanied with almost perfect balance of piney hop bitterness. I'm running out of words. Bready fruity esters on the back end. Smooth as hell. No booze burn despite the 8% ABV.  M - Medium body as the beer just keeps having a dance party up in there.  O - Blessed be.

Arrived with just a tiny bit of head which resulted in just a tiny bit of lacing.  4.5 S: Pliny is extra piney on-tap. Grapefruit and super flowery. From a bottle is good, but fresh on-tap is better.  4.5 T: My friend once drank one of my Pliny bottles that I got in a trade and said, ""This is how beer should taste."" I'm tempted to agree. Lots of pine, grapefruit, and whatever the taste equivalent of flowery aroma is. Moderate bitterness. Malts are, for the most part, completely hidden, which is fine with me.  4.5 M: Lighter medium body. Good moderate carbonation.

863,7971,Scrumtralecent,4.92,"Poured from a bottle into a teardrop beer glass. Bottled on 05/26/11.  A - A hazy golden orange with a bubbly white head.  S - Lovely grapefruit and citrus hop aroma. It has a sweet tinge to it that reminds me of honey. Great smelling beer, I sat and smelled it for a few minutes before even sipping it. A smell to savor.  T - Citrus hop flavor with a nice malt backbone to smooth the bitter taste. Great hop profile and well balanced taste make this incredibly tasty. Complex as well with the bitter hops giving way to the smooth citrus that lingers well after the beer is gone. As the beer warms, and more sips are taken, the hops just bombard and take over. But it is such a delicious hop profile of bitter and sweet, that I'm ok losing this war of attrition.  M - First thing I thought of honestly was silky for an DIPA. The hops bite but the mouth is oddly smoothed after it all and left with nice soft mouthfeel. After a while, the hops begin to win and cause fatigue, but the soothing mouthfeel after the first few sips was unique.  O - An incredible DIPA. It takes the beautiful citrus hop flavors well known in west coast IPAs and creates a complex, balanced, and complete IIPA worthy of its ranking. From first hit of the lips to moments after you swallow, this beer does not disappoint.",Russian River Brewing Company,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,100

863,7971,fox227,4.92,"Here's the most important part the review: Bottled on 6-3-11, consumed on 6-15-11. This would make this Pliny in its absolute prime. A month old Pliny is in the shadow of two week old Pliny. It's not even in the same league.  A: Dark Golden color, creamy head that quickly falls, at least in my tulip glass. The lacing is attractive, however.  S: The massive fruit profile of the smell is incredible: pineapple, peach, apricot, citrus - the whole gamut of pleasing hoppy smells are present here.  T: taste follows the nose, and finishes with a bit of warm alcohol. This is what is so unfortunate about month old Pliny: much of the above flavor becomes subdued but the heat remains. Fresh, however, and it's a fruity explosion of massive IPA flavor. Something should be said for balance, as it's not aggressively hoppy at all, so those who fear excessive hops need not worry when buying this world class brew.  M: Carbonation is medium/high - just right. The head is somewhat creamy, and offers a smooth balance to the ever present bubbles. A delicate experience.  O: If you don't like super fresh Pliny, then you might want to start drinking something other than beer. Be sure to check the dates, as this beer fades considerably at around the month old mark. But for those most part, the beer sells out quickly enough that freshness won't be a problem. Happy drinking!",Russian River Brewing Company,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,100

Fluffy 1 and a half finger head, very slightly off white. Big bubbles throughout the head. Lacing like you wouldn't believe.  S: Immediate huge hop aroma. Sweet apples. Oranges. Pineapple. Lots of other citrus aromas mixed in. All topped off with a very fresh pine tree scent. Just enough sweet caramel malts coming through.  T: Very sweet caramel right on the tip of the tongue. Mostly piney hop flavor throughout the rest of the mouth. Hop bitterness is not overpowering at all. An almost perfect blend of hops and malts. Finishes super dry with all the fruity flavors converging together for just a second or two. Then it's gone. DAMN! Another drink.  M: Great feel. How the caramel sweetness wraps the tip of your tongue making the fruity piney hops run and fight for the rest of your mouth. It all lingers for a few and disappears in a flash. First beer where I've really experienced the Dry Finish. You actually feel your mouth dry back out.  O: I had figured that this beer was way over hyped (probably like a lot of us did). This beer blew me away. I was expecting some huge bitter hop explosion. But the beer focuses on the hop flavors and doesn't destroy your palette.

Followed by grapefruit, pine, and a solid bitterness. The finish has nice toasty notes and a bready finish with lingering bitterness.

I'll skip the details, since they've been covered in other reviews.  Suffice it to say, this is that rare creature that not only lives up to the hype, it exceeds it. Usually, even the best brews give hints to their make-up; how they're created. Pliny is a mystery. It defies explanation. Somehow it manages to be terribly complex and stunningly simple all at once.

T: Mild compared to some other top Imperial IPA's but not in a bad way. Extremely complex to the point that each sip brought forth a new twist. Much more piney than citrus to the taste but balanced so that both tastes are noticeable.  M: Very thin and refreshing with some body to let you know it's not a fizzy yellow offering.

Some spices and more fruit.  Taste is of strong hops, with a little fruit and some maltiness attempting to bring a backbone. Strong pine and lots of grapefruit bringing the bitterness. A hint of caramel helps to balance this out a wee bit.  Smooth, creamy, and way less alcohol flavor than the 8% might indicate. Very drinkable. Medium body and good carbonation.

Great floral aroma, rich with piney hops and citrus. The taste starts out biscuity and crisp with sweet, pale malts.

863,7971,HikerCT,4.31,"I received this beer from lisomiso in Urbancaver's NOOB BIF.  1 pint bottle poured into my imperial pint glass.  This is the second Russian River I've had and so far I've been very impressed with the clarity of both beers (the other was the Blind Pig). Really remarkable clarity.  Had a good head on it that lasted for quit a while. But was a bit rocky/chunky as it fell.  In terms of IPAs, I think this was much more balanced than Russian River's Blind Pig. I can taste more malt in this beer and I dare say it's not as bitter as Blind Pig.  Initially, I'd say this beer finishes dry. But the more I drink it, the more it's developing a sweet sort of finish. This is a well balanced IPA. It's got both the malt and the hops!  Now the elephant in the room: This beer is currently ranked in the top 3 beers on BA. Does it stand up to that rating? I'm not sure. It's a good beer and I definitely like it. I'd buy this in a bar. I think it's a solid example of an IPA. In terms of hoppiness, I'd say it doesn't really approach Dogfish's 120 Minute IPA. But this is still a great IPA, one that I'd buy again. Lucky for me, lisomiso was kind enough to send me two bottles, so I've got one more to enjoy! Looking forward to it!  Overall, a really well balanced IPA.

863,7971,Roke87,4.8,"500 mL bottle, chilled and poured into a Duvel tulip. Bottled on date: April.28.2011 Thanks to evilinc for hooking this one up!  Appearance- Pours a clear golden amber colour with a big fluffy two fingers of white head that takes a long, long time to reside to a very thick top of foam and a nice bubbly ring around the glass leaving lots of lacing throughout till finish.  Smell- From the second I opened the bottle I got a strong whiff of grapefruit. Upon pouring it into the tulip it does have a very strong grapefruit aroma, lots of resiny pine smells, and lots of citrusy fruity hops in there as well, I also get a small smell of sweetness thrown in there.  Taste- Exactly what a DIPA should be, very strong and crisp citrusy grapefruit tasting hop flavours right off the bat paired with that resiny pine taste, finishes with a well-balanced malt flavour and almost sweet as well, I just can’t put my finger on exactly what it is that is giving this one that sweet aroma and taste as well.  Mouthfeel- Light to medium bodied with more than above average carbonation, this is one smooth and crisp, easy drinking DIPA and hides the higher ABV very well, not overly bitter either for such a hopped up beer.  Overall- Wow what an amazing DIPA, although it does remind me of other east coast DIPA’s that I have tried before, I do understand why it has such a big hype, this beer is simply outstanding. I wish I had regular access to this one as my fridge would probably be full of it. Great aromas right away once the bottle is opened to the great balanced tastes throughout.

I ended up buying two bottles of Pliny. LOVE my liquor store!

863,7971,Dope,4.3,"11 day old bottle sampled in this review.  A: Pretty typical of a DIPA, a nice medium amber color. Very fluffy off-white head with good retention.  S: Immediately apparent and quite strong. Smells like pine most of all but you can detect the bready malt in the background too. A nice combo and the kind of aroma you keep coming back to sample some more.  T: Instant up-front hop bite typical of West coast style IPAs. Very piney with a bit of citrus rounding it out. Surprisingly well balanced, it's not ridiculously hopped just for the sake of being the biggest palate ruiner (like a Ruination might be). Malt backbone is apparent but not intrusive. A sort of bready graininess sticks around in the aftertaste. No indication of alcohol at all despite being 8% ABV.  M: Medium in body with a bit of oily mouth coating that you get from big IPAs. Not as bad as some but it's there. Very smooth, carbonation isn't harsh at all. Aftertaste sticks around for a while but isn't annoying.  O: Overall a very impressive beer. It does everything well. Honestly for as much hype as this beer gets I thought it would be better (like KBS or Westy 12 type ""wow"" factor). It's quite good but not out of this world. This isn't a strike against it, it's easily top 3 DIPA for me. I think this is better than Maharaja (Maharaja being a bit too big and malty and overpowering in general) but a little worse than Hopslam (which blew my socks off).

Poured into a Duvel oversized tulip  A - Rusty, clear and firm, good foam dissipates quickly and leaves nice soapy lacing  N - Wow. Fresh tangerine, tropical but not sugary fruits maybe pomegranite? Just such a bright, perfumy nose, so much going on. The tangy characters wrap around a dense, resiny hop character. A little fresh squeezed pineapple juice, some orange peel more cedar to piney resiny notes, the breadiness comes in more like golden raisins or figs, and very subtle in the backdrop is strawberry, or some fresh picked fruit, I believe.  T - Wow. Fresh cedar or pine up front, a nice thick blanket of hop character kind of sits on the palate, definitely a rib sticking beer (would love to pair this with bbq brisket), a little warming brandy-like in the finish, love it. Fleeting suggestions of tangerine, orange peel and definitely big fresh pineapple is present. I can't think of another beer or food that this reminds me of (maybe a lemon tart desert or pineapple upside down cake), everything about this is world class. The unsung hero here is the wonderful texture, very rich and velvety, nothing I mean nothing overpowers this beer. It has a real savory, umami component.

M: I felt it crisp, not chewy at all, but finished with a fair amount of carbonation. O: I enjoyed this quite a bit. It's a shame here in Ct. , it's quite hard to find. I'll savor the memory for a while.",Russian River Brewing Company,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,100
863,7971,MikeM40,4.5,"Poured from a 500 ml. bottle into a SA Perfect Pint glass. This beer pours a golden honey amber color with a large foamy head which leaves a ton of lacing. Aromas of pine,hops,citrus...particularly grapefruit and touch of malt rise from the glass. Fresh citrus is up front which gives way to a strong pinyness,followed by a hoppy bitterness. The finish is balanced off with a slight malty sweetness that tails off to a dry finish. Mouthfeel is very good and there is plenty of carbonation to accent the crisp,clean nature of this beer. Alcohol taste and presence is well hidden. For me this brew lived up to expectations.   The bottle reviewed was 2 weeks old.",Russian River Brewing Company,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,100
863,7971,vfgccp,4.47,"A – Crystal gold amber with a fluffy white head.  S – Herbal forward with clove, sage, dill and soft thyme. There’s an interesting sweet note that almost comes off as a thinned out condensed milk. Delicious orange zest and pineapple citrus throughout.  T – Soft malt sweetness into a smack of grapefruit and pine. The bitterness is broad but resists escalating out of control. Middle to back end brings out flavors more akin to the nose; thyme, orange, and pineapple.  M – Medium body with a soft mouthfeel. Well carbonated. Lingering herbal bitterness.",Russian River Brewing Company,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,100

S- All I can smell is some Grade A Medical Cannabis and possibly some pine and citrus. I wish every beer smelled like this.  T- This had 3 levels of flavor. The beginning was smooth an I was yearning for more. As the beer warmed, the hops dominated and felt like a Jackie Chan side kick to the jaw. The ending tasted just like the beginning, made me want more.  M- Pretty damn smooth with the perfect amount of carbonation. I can see what the hype is about.

863,7971,Supersweetshirts,4.92,"This was the perfect double I.P.A., no question about it. The beer pours a hazy golden color with not much head. I found it to have more carbonation that some of the other double I.P.A.'s I've had. Pliny gives off an incredible aroma of pine with barely a hint of fruit. It was a little too cold for our first few tastes so the hop explosion was very intense, but as the beer dropped in temperature you could taste every element to this beer perfectly. An initial hop explosion that leaves a citrus, grapefruit, taste lingering behind with absolutely no undesirable aftertaste. The only thing that I can find wrong with this beer is that it is incredibly difficult to find. Places were sold out of it or had limited quantities.

Sugar coated grapefruit? Some piney resins creep in with a touch of alcohol on the finish.  T- Sugary sweet grapefruit and powerful citrus on the front. Smooth caramel sweetness gives way to a piney and astringent hop bitterness. Finishes dry, but not overbearingly so.  M- Medium in body with a slick feel. Carbonation helps on the finish.

S-Hops, hops, hops, pineapple, pine, and citrus. And all very fresh. Smells like being in the woods and breathing in a fresh, brisk, spring air in the morning after it's been raining.  T-very unique hoppiness. it almost ""bites"". like you're eating a handful of hops and there are some pine needles hidden in there that prick your mouth. a little faint sweetness. not as complex in the mouth as it is in the nose though.

863,7971,EricCioe,4.54,"Early April bottling date, so six weeks old. Thanks headyglassdotcom for both the beer and the awesome oversized wineglass I'm drinking from.  This pours a full gold with a two finger white head rising up and then dying down to a thin cap, leaving moderate lace. On the nose, there are great resin and grapefruit notes. The fresh pine resin is the biggest note, with the citric notes hanging out behind it. I'm not getting much in the way of any evidence of a malt backbone, but that's just fine. In the mouth, the pine resin melts over the whole palate at first, the grapefruit and lemon zest coming out later. There is some malt here, a simple, bready backdrop for the resin and other stuff. The finish is surprising medium, not as exceedingly bitter as I'd have guessed, but it's still good and quite dry.  Overall, this is a fine, fine beer. I don't think it blows everything else out of the water, but it's quite clearly in the top tier of beers of this style.",Russian River Brewing Company,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,100

Nice sticky lacings on the glass. Very smooth with a slightly resinous feel toward the finish. Big tropical/citrus aroma, grapefruit and orange the most prominent, with a hint of pineaapple. After your nose gets accustomed to the hope aroma intensity, the sweet malt aromas begin to show through. Burst of citrus hops on the palate with a delicate malty feel underneath. Finishes with a touch of piney hop bitterness. Although this a showcase of hop aroma and flavor the flavors and feel are smooth creamy and delicate.

Taste:The grapefruit and citrus fruit aromas are conveyed in the taste. The alcohol is not a factor in the taste. It's extremely well hidden. I'm not sure if the hops were subdued due to this one being sampled 1+ months after bottling but I find the hops well integrated not obtrusive. Very clean refreshing taste.  Mouth-feel: Medium body with a moderate level of carbonation.  Overall: Good beer.

863,7971,aficionado,4.67,"Bottle Date: 4/28/11 - Served in a Duvel Tulip.  I've several different batches of 2 week old, 3 week old, and 5 week old Pliny. The 2 week old bottle tasted like Angel's tears. The 5 week old was less than stellar. A really stale taste from the hops that lacked the same pungent aroma and awesome flavor. I can see how someone would give older PtE a B rating. The 3 week old bottle is actually what I tasted last... so onto the 3 week old review...  Thin layer of white head atop of a translucent orange body. The most awesome shade of orange you'll ever see. Lots of sticky lacing left on the glass as you continue drinking.  Huge aroma of inviting pine followed by some dank marijuana and a bouquet of citrus; mostly grapefruit and tangerine.  A total pine assault from start to finish. More grapefruit and tangerine on the palate as well. Has a tiny bit of caramel malt sweetness to combat the pithy bite while still managing to remain inherently bitter. Simple, but well executed.  Perfect body for an Imperial IPA. Moderate carbonation. Manages to be crisp and juicy, yet retain dextrinous body. Not too sweet or heavy like some can be.",Russian River Brewing Company,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,100

Vigorous pour leaves a good two finger length of head. The head stayed around almost the whole time. Lots of lacing. Sticks to the glass a lot.  S - Loads of citrus here. Smells awesome.  T - Perfect balance here. Bitterness up front that is immediately followed by a nice sweet citrus taste.  M - Exactly the way an IPA should be. Perfect amount of body and carbonation.

863,7971,bobhits,4.63,"Pliny the Elder!  22 days old and from the trade who did this in person, never not refrigerated/cooled outside of a short plane trip.  Pours a crystal clear body, only a few random bubbles are coming up here, nearly dead, and clarity like few other double IPAs. The white head is there and certainly seems to cling to the glass. A part of seem is impressed with the perfection in clarity, and part of me wanted something more.  Wonderfully balanced hops and malt in the nose, grape fruit, pine pine apples, and just well balanced.  Pliny has a bite and I mean a BITE from the hops, but it falls back into a mellow creamy malt bed that is simply dreamy. This is an amazingly different double IPA for me. It doesn’t really take on the grapefruit citrus notes nor does it swing to the fruity floral or even the piny. The malt wonderfully blends with the bite of the hops and give off a wonderfully, perfectly balanced double IPA. Often I feel critical of double IPAs for their great many flaws, this one shows how right I am to be critical.  Light for a double, but simply right in so many ways. I really want more people to think of this is how double IPAs should be in mouth feel.  I suppose I expected my life to change after having this. I guess that was a but lofty to expect, but still this is wonderful...amazing beer! I still rank fresh dreadnaught a hair above this, and I think hopslam’s sweeter heavier nature has traits that far surpass this, but this is simply amazing beer. I think this is one of the few examples of a beer that attempts to match stone’s dominance of IPAs without over charging or under producing.",Russian River Brewing Company,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,100

863,7971,Naugros,4.67,"Just about to top 1000 on karma so I figured I'd do so in style and pop my Pliny cherry.  You can smell this hop bomb as soon as you pop the cap, but still you want to get your nose into it and breathe it all in for a bit and enjoy the grapefruit, pine and orange hops characteristics balanced perfectly by the malts that throw off a light caramel note. I really don't want to taste it now...I'm good right here.  The beer itself is really pretty. Light orange with an internal glow that speaks to the quality of their processes. The head is white and foamy and leaves behind tons of clingy lacing.  The taste falls just slightly short of the nose, but only in the sense that it gets a wee pithy for my taste, but it's still perfectly balanced and throws down with some major citrus backed by pine. This is a phenomenal showcase for American hops.  Why talk about the mouthfeel? It's just as it needs to be for an IPA. It finishes very clean but still allows the bitterness of the hops to linger a bit. It's excellent. And that goes for the overall. Many think this beer might be overhyped...I am not one of them.

A: About as good as you can get, pours a clear golden color with a slight chill haze and a ton of sticky white head.  S: Great balance of juicy citrus & tropical fruit, malt and pine; West Coast to a 'T'. A touch of alcohol too. Very nice.  T: A good amount of pine and malt up front. Middle of the tongue the citrus fruit characteristics emerge as well as some more of the malt sweetness, and the bitterness begins to cling to your tongue. Not quite as bitter or dry as I thought it would be though.  MF: Not 'thin' but a lighter mouthfeel; good carbonation.  O: A+, I like its balance more than anything; this beer has pine-y, juicy, resin-y characteristics but they don't overwhelm you.

863,7971,lookitsmp,4.44,"appearance: Pours a slightly lazy but mostly transparent golden orange with about a fingers worth of head which leaves some lacing. A pretty nice looking double IPA.  smell: Grapefruit dominates the aroma for me. Very sweet smelling. Some pine scent and, of course, lots of hops. This beer smells amazing. I immediately compared the smell to Bell's Hopslam.  taste: Much like it smells, I taste a wonderful balance of grapefruit and pine. It's like a balance of a traditional double IPA and a west coast double IPA which usually are dominated by pine notes. These two tastes blend exceptionally well. Starts off sweet and ends with that great bitter hop finish.  mouth: Very smooth and slightly carbonated. The hops dry leave your mouth dry and ready for the next sip.  overall: This is a very good beer. It actually smells much better than it taste (and it tastes very good). The fusion between grapefruit and pine works very well and its something unique that I have yet to taste in other double IPA's.

863,7971,zeledonia,4.15,"Bottled 6 April 2011. Not quite as fresh as I'd like, but for my first time drinking it, it'll have to do.  Pours a translucent golden orange, with nice streams of bubbles rising from the glass's nucleation point. One finger + head, very white and frothy; lasts quite a while and leaves amazing lacing. There's froth all over the inside of my glass.  Piney hops dominate the nose, with some fruity (oranges and grapefruit) hops, and a bit of floral. Malt aromas are there to provide support, but they're definitely a distant second fiddle to the hops. I tend not to like pine-dominated hop smells, but this one is really smooth, full, and well-rounded. If it tastes as good as it smells, I'll be happy.  It does not taste quite as good as it smells. It starts out rather malty, before the hops come in heavy. I don't actually get much from the hops other than bitterness - where's the piney resin that's so prevalent in the nose? Where's the citrus? Pine is there in the finish with the bitterness, but that's about it. Well-balanced, but not as hop-flavorful as I want it to be.  Mouthfeel is quite good - medium-bodied and good carbonation. Clings to the mouth and holds on to the bitter finish almost until I'm ready for my next sip.  A very tasty DIPA, but the hops just aren't there in the taste as much as I'd like them to be. I've heard tell that this beer fades fast after bottling, and I recognize that this bottle may have suffered from that.

A - It pours a radiant brassy golden hue, and is capped with a heaping of fluffy butter-cream colored head, depositing much lace.  S - The nose is just grade-A totally insane; it is like being blasted with sticky citrus-fruit in the middle of an evergreen logging operation.  T - Again, if you dropped a tangerine-grapefruit-mango bomb on a pine-spruce woodland, some volume of PtE would necessarily be created.  M - I really enjoy DIPA with a feel like this, not so viscous, and not getting confused with BW.  O - I enjoy this at least twice as much as I have week-old bottles. I am not sure if it is a freshness thing; three days difference seems to miniscule to produce that much change, but I may be wrong about that.

Small but frothy head that clings to the glass really well. The hop aroma springs out of the bottle as soon as it opens, and the same can be said for the beer in the glass. It smells like an amalgam of straight up pine with some citrusy smells and earthy hops.  Tastes great, and is surprisingly very smooth going down. The hops are extremely present and not overwhelming for the palate at all. I was so surprised by how dry to finish was on this beer. It is extremely reminiscent of DFH 90 min and Troegs Nugget Nectar. Like, both of those beers but in a blender with an exceedingly dry finish.  So good. Lived up to the hype for me.

863,7971,locthebloke,4.32,"My bottle bottled on 6 April 2011. Consumed on 16 May. Not a lot to say about Pliny that hasn't already been said, but here goes.  A.) - A slightly cloudy amber/orange. A frothy 1'' head with moderate retention. Good lacing as the glass is tipped.  S.) - A pungent aroma of fresh hops hits the nose as soon as the bottle is opened. It's no wonder the bottle urges the drinker not to age it. The sheer freshness of the ingredients will hit you--pine/hops are dominant with a faint essence of orange peel. Milder in the hops dept. than I expected; I was pleasantly surprised.  T.) - Malt balance is provided against pleasantly intense hops--just the right level. Actually less hoppy than I expected given its reputation. Hoppiness is dominant, but a savoring in the mouth brought out its slight sweetness and orange zest flavors. Finishes really bitter. Hops linger in the mouth long after the bottle is finished. Alcohol minimal despite being 8% ABV. Dangerously drinkable.  M.) - Smooth, medium body with moderate carbonation. Hops ignite the palate long after the beer is gone. Pretty sticky on the lips.  O.) - Finally got to try the celebrated Pliny the Elder after getting a hold of a bottle at last. As I said, a dangerously drinkable brew that will leave you warm and feeling pleasant after one bottle. Everything is perfectly balanced here. Less hoppy than imagined, given its reputation. A pleasant surprise. I expected Pliny to be an overrated, overly hoppy beer that would inevitably let me down given the hype but I was wrong. Quite sore it's not available in Wisconsin. I paid $20 for the bottle. Is Pliny a $20 bottle of beer? Probably not, especially considering it's a year-rounder, but worth it for the one time experience if it's not in your area.

Smell is of pine, citrus rind, hops and more pine. Beautiful earthiness to the smell. Very nice.  Taste is what you'd expect after the smell. Very well balanced with the pine flowing to the citrus and hops. Finishes dry with a christmas tree like feel in the mouth. I typically enjoy the west coast IIPAs that are more grapefruit and mango based, but this piney dryness is excellent.  Mouthfeel is top notch.

863,7971,kevinv,4.62,"Bottled 4/28/11, consumed sometime early May. Reviewed from notes.  A - Pours a clear honey color with a frothy white head. Good retention and wonderful lacing.  S - Aromatic piney hops, very floral, and light citruses. Quite the handful of hops here, as expected. Very inviting.  T - Well balanced combination of malt and hops, but the hops are definitely dominant. Delicious hop profile that's full of citrusy notes like grapefruit, pineapple, and lemon. Nice pale malt backbone. Finishes bitter and dry. Slightly sweet.  M - High-medium body with a prickly medium carbonation. Slightly sticky.  D - Very drinkable, even at 8%. I'm not sure what's left to say after over 2,000 reviews that hasn't already been said.

863,7971,LaCoursiere,4.65,"Bottled on 04/28/11 - First time trying PtE, big thanks to eyeenjoybeer!  A - Poured into a New Belgium globe. It has an impeccably clear yellow amber color. A gentle pour yielded a nice cream colored full finger head that stayed for a long time. Lots of lacing that sticks and stays.  S - Amazing aroma of fruits; pineapple, mango, grapefruit, orange and lemon all backed by light pine notes. There are fresh bready malt notes in there as well.  T - Bready malt up front fading to slightly sweet hints of honey, brown sugar and orange. There is a bit of hay/grass flavor in the middle as well. The bitter finish has notes of resiny pine, fresh lemon zest and pepper. The bitterness hangs around until the next sip.  M - Smooth and creamy to start followed by a burst of light carbonation and a bit of dryness in the finish. The carbonation level compliments the flavor profile very well. barely detectable alcohol warmth  O/D - I'm hooked. This beer is great drinking experience; the outstanding appearance and intense aroma set up the balanced flavor profile and excellent mouth-feel exceedingly well. It's a good thing I have a few more of these because this one sure went down easy. Can't wait for the next one.",Russian River Brewing Company,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,100
863,7971,shangwang,4.8,"picked a bottle up during at City Beer in SF during a recent West Coast visit. bottled on 4/28/11. I've had Pliny on draft before but its been about a year and I haven't tried it from the bottle until now.  Poured with a heavy layer of head, at least two fingers. Dissipated slowly and left some heavy frothy lacing. Great golden hue with perfect clarity. The smell was dominated by a piny, hoppy bouquet with hints of citrus and a spicy clove quality. The taste mirrored the smell nicely, bitter hops with a delicate fruit sweetness. Light mouthfeel- watery and light on the tongue. Very smooth finish, left a lingering sweetness.  Obviously this beer's reputation precedes it, and for good reason. PtE has great taste, a balanced complexion, and it nails the West Coast style as well as or better than any other DIPA. Awesome brew. Wish it was a little easier to get our hands on, but being in Philly I guess I can't complain!",Russian River Brewing Company,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,100
863,7971,nickshep7,4.97,"Clear honey golden base (maybe a touch of hop haze) with 2 fingers of bubbly, slightly off white head. Initial smell is all tropical fruit – fresh pineapple, sweet orange, and mango. Pine needles and an elegant astringency from the hops follow the initial tropical fruit attack. Taste echoes the smell with the initial attack really showing off those tropical, sweet fruits. The fruit is followed by a nice transition to bittering hops. This is virtually the only IPA/IIPA that I’ve had the pleasure of tasting that has such a fantastic transition from the start to the mid-palate to the finish. Overall, bar none, the best IPA I’ve had the pleasure of enjoying. If/when I am on the west coast and this is available in bottle or on tap, it will be sought after…. By any means necessary.",Russian River Brewing Company,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,100

863,7971,BeerMaverick,4.28,"Thanks to ccm414 for this extremely famous and rare beer!  My notes take into consideration the age of this bottle...it is probably a couple months old, so it won't be up to par with standards.  A - Burnt orange color with 1/2"" of white head and decent retention. Lacing is present all over the snifter. Beautiful representation of the style.  S - Hops are up front with citrusy bursts similar, but slightly more active than Nugget Nectar. I am pretty certain the famous fresh hop esters have dissipated over time.  T - Again, hops dominate the forefront of this facet with a nice orange-peel citrusy aftertaste. The malt comes through in the aftertaste as well and combines perfectly with the hops.  M - The malt/hop balance really comes into play here...the bitter hop notes play up the fruity sweetness and coat the tongue all over.  O - This is a fantastic beer overall and it is one of the best DIPAs that I have ever had. I am pretty sure that if I had this within a few days of bottling, it would be my favorite, but it is amazing nonetheless. The alcohol is completely hidden my the hop bitterness and the citrusy character.

Appearence: Golden.. very little head in the glass.. slightly hazy  Smell: Amazing amount of citrus and pine oil. From the tap aroma explodes way more than from a bottle. I could smell the glass sitting in front of me without even getting close.  Taste: Definitely get IPA right away. Hops all over the place along with citrus, primarily grapefruit.  Mouthfeel: Carbination level made this rediculously drinkable. Very smooth in the mouth, all the way down.  Overall: I've always counted Pliny as one of the best beers I've been privaledged to try.

863,7971,jhughes23,4.92,"Bottle poured into Tulip Glass  Beautiful Clear Light Amber color with a nice fluffy head that disapated to a thin but respectable layer that laced nicely.  Beautiful perfume of piney, sweet hops. A hint of citrus in the nose as well but the piney smells are the most pungent and lovely.  The tastes are the same as the aroma, piney hops with a slight touch of sweet maltiness followed by a smaller hint of citrus flavors. the Maltiness is perfectly balanced with this hop heavy brew, the alcohol and bitterness are perfect.  The Finish is one of the best i've had. Very clean and not much lingering on the tounge. Wich in my case is a bad thing, makes it way too easy to drink when all you want to do is savor it slowly!  All DIPA's should aspire to be this awesome. Even some of the best DIPA's are too heavy on the malty side or bitter side. This is perfect.

Beautifully clear and golden, with just a touch a fluffy white head. Head dissipated almost instantly. Not too much lacing.  Smells incredible. Smorgasbord of citrus fruits.  Tastes just as good. Hop bomb full of grapefruit and a hint of pineapple. Alcohol, carbonation, and malt backbone all work together to balance out the huge hop profile.  Nice and dry, keeps you wanting more.

Aromas of orange peel, lemon zest, earthiness, and very light breadiness. Tastes of citrus fruits and rose water up front, followed by medium bitterness, and finishes w/ light pie crust/croissant.

Taste: Wonderful balance between malt and hops.Lightly acidic with potent juniper berry and fruity grapefruit and lemon flavors.Not sweet like a lot of Mid West IPA. Alcohol is well masked.  Mouthfeel: Creamy, smooth, comfy, pleasant and sticky in the mouth. Medium body and dry with a fairly soft carbonation level.

863,7971,Chaney,4.62,"Bottled on 4/15/11 and poured into a tulip.  A: I poured it hard and summoned up a massive two finger or so, mildly off-white head that stayed a clumpy froth throughout the session. Very cloudy, melted orange sherbet in appearance.  S: Wonderful duet between the pine and the citrus (orange and grapefruit)... however, no peach ala. Sculpin. I got a tinge of yeast for balance.  T: Bitter, very tempered sweetness-wise, and downright tasty. Bitter and citrusy on the front, citrus and pine in the middle, and then a nice yeasty kick to round out the hop profile on the finish.  M: Like I said, the VERY disciplined sweet element was the thing about this beer that impressed me the most. The carbonation was picture perfect, the bitterness was knocked down (eventually) by the fresh clean cotton-like yeast. The lacing left on the glass was splotchy, prominent, yet still stayed somewhat moist.  O: I've always viewed Sculpin as the pinnacle in this category. Is Pliny as good?

O = Well the legacy this beer possesses is pretty incredible. Does it live up to the hype?? I venture to say, Most Certainly. It's a fantastic DIPA and probably the best of that style I've enjoyed.

T: Hops are prevalent, but I guess I expected more, and therefore not quite as fruity as I had hoped. Not a huge fan of the aftertaste.  M: Light, medium and perfect amount of carbonation.

Mellos out a little as it sits there and you get a couple sips in.  M: lots of hops leads this to be a palate killer. But its completely worth it. Well carbonated.

The hops also give some nice floral and earthy notes. A nice hop blend - I can pick out the Simcoe.There is just a tiny bit of sweetness to balance out the hops. It takes a bit of time for all the flavors to work out.  M - slick, resinous feel. Not heavily carbonated, just fine.  Overall - There's a reason why Pliny is the standard Imperial IPA. It does everything right. It may not be the most innovative beer out there, but it doesn't need to be, much like Sculpin is to single IPAs. I find it hard to find faults here. It doesn't have some of the cool hop flavors that I like in other beers (like the tropical fruit flavors in Nugget Nectar), but it's the most well balanced imperial IPA I've had.",Russian River Brewing Company,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,100

A- much more yellow than i thought it would be, gold can be seen when the light catches it the right way.  S- strong pine and grapefruit nose with a little bit of alcohol underlying. Very fresh hop presence.  T- the first thing you get is fresh hops and then it is followed by some pine and citrus notes. the alcohol isn't as well hidden as i would like it to be especially since its only 8%, but it does dry out the beer and keep it from being too sweet.  M- this is fairly dry ale, but the carbonation and thinness of this brew give it a mouthfeel of a pilsner. atleast that is what i get from it.  0- overall this beer is a solid representation of the style, but not the best IIPA ive ever had.

Very resinous.  S: Great aroma to PtE. I cracked the bottle and I could smell it across the kitchen. High in citrus, specifically, grapefruits and lemons and a nice floral note as well.  T: The flavor to PtE is exceptional but not the powerhouse the reviews led me to believe. Citrus and caramel with a light hop bitterness and some grass in there too.  M: An extremely balanced brew. Not too much carbonation and not too much hops. Maybe the balance of it is a bit misleading as to how hoppy this brew really is. If so, its still great.  O: I found Pliny to be an excellent brew but too overhyped. I find its excellence to be in the incredible balance of Pliny.

A: Glowing ripe tangerine in color. A careful pour yields a two finger head and reasonable lacing, though it's not as spectacular as I'd expected.  S: Sweet alcohol esters, fruit forward hop oil and bitter, halved pink grapefruit topped with sugar.  T: A rush of mango, with the appropriate sticky, almost cloying bitterness following behind. I Continue getting hopsmacked, as the fruit, spiciness and hints of juniper continue dancing on my palate. The concentration and depth of the flavors is wild. As it warms, the hops settle down, and it all converges into one of the most balanced DIPA's I can recall.  M: A richer mouthfeel then RR's Blind Pig, but still not quite what I'd expected. The carbonation is a bit soft, like a feather pillow for my tounge. It drinks incredibly well.  O: I can't say this lived up to the immense hype, but damn if it isn't a truly great beer.

863,7971,spicelab,4.38,"Thanks to Adam@Platinum Liquor.  Delectably clear orange-copper with a two-finger solid white head populated by mostly small bubbles but with a fair whack of large, sudsy bubbles sitting on top. Drops over a couple of minutes leaving incredibly strong lace and retaining most of the sudsy carbonation. Solid as it gets.  First impressions are ultra-fresh pineapple, orange zest and apricot danish with a good deal of doughy malts accentuating the sticky, marmaldey, jammy and savoury characteristics which ultimately create a very solid backbone. Bitter herbs occasionally show through, but they're quite subdued. Not overly complex, but certainly lip-smacking.  At first the flavours merge into one. Slowly they differentiate into a rough hierarchy of pine needles, marmalade, radicchio, mint and aniseed. There seems to be a real ascendancy of bitter hop flavours with the more fruity, tropical notes struggling for a voice. Some almost buttery, beefy notes really crank up the volume of the whole shebang. Terrifically juicy and yummy, but I was hoping for a more even distribution of hop character. That said, the further I get into this the more the flavours wickedly assert themselves across the palate. The effect is quite intoxicating - and no I don't mean the ABV.  Rich and syrupy mouthfeel with relatively high bitterness, especially on the back palate where it feels somewhat chewy and agressive. Moderate carbonation. Certainly let's you know it's there.  The standout aspect for me is the damn-near alive, pungent and juicy freshness that gives this beer one heck of a presence. It has the ""bigness"" often associated with a serious red wine. However it seems to lack a little depth and doesn't quite open out enough on the palate. I'd be very keen to try it on tap or from the source some day and do a re-review.",Russian River Brewing Company,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,100
863,7971,Fippy_Darkpaw,4.62,"A - Pours a golden orange. Quite a looker of an DIPA. The head came easy without much pressure and created a nice pillow above.  S - Just like I was in a pine forest. Also caught hints of citrus and a little grapefruit. Very hop forward.  T - Taste just like it smells, pine all the way. Very complex with grass, dirt, and earthy flavors which were surprising in a good way.  M - Medium carbonation. As it warmed up it became almost a little chewy, as if I was slowly gnawing on the hops themselves and enjoying the nectar.  O - Part of me was hoping that this beer was all hype and that I could discount it as a hype bomb, the other hoping to enjoy it immensely. The latter won. One of the best DIPA's and really shines when fresh. If you're on the east coast like myself, demand this fresh or decline.

Poured into a brandy sniffer that I wish I could swim in for a summer or two. Appearance is a beautiful apricot that poured with about two inches of foamy head which disappeared rather quickly as it settled into the glass. Smells of grapefruit and pine. Hints of apricot and peach. Hops extraordinaire! Taste is a dream. Sweet, bitter, herbaceous, and syrupy in the best was possible. Definitely a double but not overwhelming alcohol or abusive bitterness. Mouthfeel is again, syrupy with a remarkably clean finish. Overall it's everything they say it is. It's the more mature fraternal twin of Dogfish's 120 minute that doesn't need to be loud to make a statement. It's power is in it's complexity.",Russian River Brewing Company,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,100

A- Beautiful straw color, golden with a great 2 finger head that has great retention and lacing. It's holding on to the glass quite nicely. Pretty clear.  S- Mmmmm, citrus resin, grapefruit, floral, with good malts in the back.  T- Taste resembles the nose. Grapefruit, other citrus fruit, all the floral hops that I love. A good balance with the Malts. Good clean finish.  M- A good clean mouthfeel and solid finish.  Overall- Great DIPA. Dangerously drinkable at 8%. I'm glad that I have been able to try it so many times.

Bottled 4/6/11  Brassy golden with a big, creamy ivory colored cap that leaves sheets of crusty lace on the glass. The aroma..yeah, real nice. Fruit juicy and resinous grapefruit rind and sticky pine sap with subtle caramel cube sweetness. The flavor is a perfect combination of some of my favorite hops, Columbus, Simcoe, Chinook and Centennial and the aromatics really bring out the flavor with each sip. The big resinous hop notes are just balanced with malt sweetness. Medium bodied, slightly sticky and smooth with soft carbonation.

There's also a lot of bitterness, but it doesn't linger or impede any of the other flavors; it just makes itself known and gets out of the way.  M - Medium mouthfeel. Smooth, moderate carbonation.

Taste is alot of bitter piney hops upfront, a touch of earthiness, rich malts that balance nicely with a hoppy finish, not overly sweet.

863,7971,Dan3279,4.7,"I have to thank my buddy Nick for the trade and getting me this beer fresh! The bottle is only 21 days from being bottled. I poured the bottle into a pint glass to find a great golden colored body with an one inch white head. As I drank the beer you could see the white lacing sticking to the glass. The aroma is dominated by the grapefruit hops and at the same time is very inviting. The taste is exceptional the floral citrus flavors hitting your pallet immediately. Though at the same time it has a great balance and is not over powering at all, its clean and crisp. There is a perfectly balanced bitter - sweet aftertaste that after a few seconds leaves you wanting more. The mouthfeel was great, like I said its very balanced and you don't really notice the alcohol at all, especially being at 8%abv.  Overall this is an exceptional beer and I think its worth the hype. My first thought is that its sad that you can't sit on this beer and save it for a special occasion.

N- Heavy kumquat, red grapefruit, Valencia orange, tangerine. When this beer is fresh, you really get a tropical fruit explosion. Papaya is possible. The hop extract used here is quite a change.  T- Even when fresh PtE is quite astringent, piny, resiny, with bitter peel and melon rind. Fruit and oil up front move quickly to an onslaught of IBUs in the finish with bitter Brazil nut and Kola nut.  P- A little prickly, sharp carbonation, mostly oily and thick/oily.  It's definitely an amazing experience, but with so many amazing West Coast DIPAs out there, it's really not much better than things like fresh Sculpin, Double Jack, and greatly inferior I think to Alpine Duet.",Russian River Brewing Company,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,100

Two good inches of head that slowly dissapears, leaving about a 1/2 finger head thats been pretty stirdy for a while now. Nice lacing.  Smell-This is exactly the aroma I want on my air freshener in my car, house, and cologne. Hands down the best aroma I've ever smelt coming from a beer, or anything. Instantly slapped in the face with different tropical fruits and citrus. At first I got the Mango, then the citrus(lemon, grapefruit), then some pineapple and back to the mango. Perfection.  Taste-Hops aren't as much as the star as I thought. They stay around throughout the whole experience, strongest on the finish along with the pine. Off the bat you get a light, crisp, citrus flavor, and towards the middle you get some of the tropical fruits. I'm stuck between a 4.0 and a 4.5.  Mouthfeel-Creamy, smooth, crisp, once again another perfect trait. Medium bodied, great carbonation, no alcohol detected, no burn.  Overall-This beer is so easy to drink.

A few of my friends have come across it in the Philly area on tap, but I had yet to have it. Split this bottle with my buddy Greg to celebrate his newly acquired fatherhood.  500ml bottle dated 3.21.11 (one month and one day old) -&gt; Duvel tulip.  A - Cloudy bright gold, foamy off white head, light sticky lacing. Small head retention through the tasting. Steady carb streams at first.  S - Extremely aromatic, complex hop and citrus notes. Some dank earthy hop tones creep up as it warms.  T - Up front citrus sweet, mild hop bitterness. Middle is tart and creamy orange sweet. Feels extremely well balanced between the sweet and bitter side. Both sides shine!  M - Decent carb fizz, feel thin to medium bodied.  O - Tastes and feels very well balanced, looks gorgeous and there's no hint of alcohol. Very easy drinking and not a palate killer. This lives up to the hype. It's an extremely well made beer.

863,7971,KYBrewgrass,4.67,"Thanks to Preismj for helping me obtain this one! Drank from a tulip glass on 4/19/11, bottled on 3/21/11... Tough to get it much fresher considering my circumstances, though I'd be curious to know the difference that a few weeks made! Next time I'm out west...  A- 4.5 Pours a pretty, pure and clean golden yellow with a tremendous two finger fluffy white head. It is just transparent. As it dissipates, it leaves what looks like half-melted ice cream in the center. This reduces to about 1/2 - 1 finger throughout. The brew leaves very sticky lacing all over the glass as I make my way through, and there's a gentle layer of tiny bubbles under its head with every movement. Very uniform. It looks great, though I suppose I expected just a tad more color.  S- 5 This smells of hops and citrus, especially grapefruit. There is more fruit here as well, maybe peach... What sets it apart from others within the style that I've come across is that it has a sweet, flower-like aroma to back it up that is very appealing. At first I find more of the hops to come through, but as it warms it really does open up to more of the sweetness and fruit-like blend. Excellent.  T- 4.5 The elusive PtE (midwesterner, here) tastes as was hinted by its aroma, and is very good. I again get its hops up front, and that is followed by a citrus. Grapefruit and orange come to mind; I'm not getting as much of the floral as I did from the scent, but there is just enough sweetness to balance its finish well. Also, its alcohol is very well-masked.  M- 5 Honestly, it is perfect. Medium in body and the carbonation is just right. It goes down easily and crisp, but finishes with a very complementary touch of creaminess that I'm not sure I've had before in the style, and this just makes it top notch. There's only the slightest dryness, and i find myself wanting more of it as soon as it is gone.  D- 4.5 I would happily take down this brew with the slightest of restraint... It is very tasty, powerful, and balanced. I think it'd be something that I'd savor for nice occasions. Part of me saying that is due to the fact that I can't just go out and buy it where I am located; maybe it'd be different if I could get it all the time. Either way, I had high expectations because of its hype and it really did live up to it. I was probably more critical of it than I am on average given the circumstances, and it was still tough to find fault. An excellent beer that is deserving of its praise, and I hope to enjoy it again.",Russian River Brewing Company,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,100

863,7971,Jparkanzky,4.25,"Thank you Brian for bringing this bottle to Lakewood!  A) Golden color to be expected from an IPA, but the head leaves a thin layer of bubbles that cover 90-95% of the top resembling the fog over the swamps of Dagobah.  S) Hoppy, and perhaps a hint of citrus that is difficult to pin down.  T) First impression is ""This isn't that hoppy, what's the big deal here"" and then the tart flavor of Grapefruit rushes in and brings me back to fond memories of fresh-squeezed Grapefruit juice in a small hotel in Argentina. As a person who ALWAYS chooses grapefruit (in addition to coffee) when given the option on a breakfast menu, this was a real treat indeed!  M) Tart, biting, acidic and dry... If you close your eyes, you could truly believe you are in fact drinking grapefruit juice.  O) An all around great beer.... still not the ""knock it out of the park"" life-altering experience the hype would lend oneself to believe, but a really great beer that I'm very happy to have had the opportunity to taste.

Puckery grapefruit, and in comes the deliciousness - a cocophany of bitter but tasty hop aromas - flowery perfume, oily pine resins, citrusy grapefruit with the rind. Mild sweet undertones from some malt, but not as forthcoming as the sweetness in the Pliny the Younger.  Medium-bodied and spectacularly drinkable. Make that dangerously drinkable. A bomber of Sculpin and a couple bottles of Pliny the Elder in my fridge spells a lot of trouble for me. Just begging to be quaffed. Good carbonation.  This is a great beer.

Freshly mowed grass. No malt to speak of.  Flavors of bitter, citrus hops, a hint of a malt backbone. Grapefruit and grapefruit zest. This is all about the hops. Finish is long, bitter, and full of grapefruit. For the amount of hops used in this, I'm pleasantly surprised their isn't a grassy note to the flavor.

It's amazing to have a double IPA so dry and crisp. Way too drinkable. M-mmmm O- Yes, and yes. Simcoe makes this beer just wonderful. Drink it fresh - don't get an old bottle on sale, that's bad form for this style of IPA. Yum.",Russian River Brewing Company,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,100
863,7971,jggibbs,4.92,"I lived in SF for the past 5 years and this brew was fairly easy to find. Walk to a local Whole Foods and grab a few bottles. No sweat. I've had my fair share.  Now that I moved to Seattle, this is an elusive little bastard. A distributor friend of mine says it ships every 8 weeks and only 100 or so bottles show up for the whole greater Seattle region. Bummer. I've been searching and hyping it up to my friend since I moved back here in January, we missed out on PtY and so far we were unsuccessful until this past weekend.  My buddy and I finally found a few bottles at Brouwer's. Much to my chagrin, the server told us they had it on tap this past Thursday but were all out by Saturday Happy Hour. Oh well, bottles it is.  Bottled 3.28  Poured a golden amber with a very faint cloudiness and off-white, 1 finger head. Little to no visible carbonation.  Smell is hoppy, pine and maybe even grassy. Beneath is citrus and florals. Incredibly refreshing scent. Perfect pick-me-up to remind me it actually is Spring. My amateur nose didn't detect much malt, if any.  Taste of hops, for sure, but not nearly as oppressively as I had thought in the past. I blame that on my changing tastes and my relatively new familiarity with IPAs. After the hops, i get citrus. Bitterness from grapefruit in a delicious way.  Light to medium mouthfeel. Very easy to drink.  Overall, it is definitely a favorite of mine and my friend said it lived up my hype. However, the Double Jack I tried last weekend blew me away. This is right there with it a 1 and 1a in my book.",Russian River Brewing Company,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,100
863,7971,cpmichael,4.62,"Bottled 3/21/11, if I remember correctly. Anyways, it was super fresh.  A: Pours a beautiful golden yellow, with a nice white foam retention.  S: Smells very hoppy, almost like sniffing a bag of hops. Maybe a hint of a skunk to it, but it's very pleasant.  T: Hop bitterness right away, citrus notes with some lemon/lemon grass to it. Also, pine tree sap.  M/D: Perfect carbonation, not an absolute tongue bruiser, which is nice, very balanced as a dipa goes.

Probably the third time I've been lucky enough to have it.  light golden appearance with a foamy white head. Plenty of froth f assist the considerable aroma.  Tempting citrus and floral aroma. Bright fresh hops, even earthy and vegetal its so fresh. The aroma you want to have when you expect hops.  By no means one dimensional. Big malt backbone (whatever that means) carries the huge hop flavor and bitterness. Incerdible balance which seems to hang on a knife edge but never steps out of line.

863,7971,Alieniloquium,4.75,"500 mL bottle poured into a pint glass.  Appearance - Beautiful white head with lacing that clings to the glass. Golden with just a bit of haziness. This is what an IPA should look like.  Smell - There is no way to justify the aroma of a fresh Pliny. Hoppy, citrusy, barely a hint of malt. Strong grapefruit smell. Clearly a hop bomb.  Taste - No surprise: hops. Fresh orange and grapefruit flavors and a bit of pine. Slight sweetness, but it stays behind the hop flavor. Very little bitterness in the start. The bitterness lingers with the finish. The only reason I don't give this a 5 is that it is that the quantity of hops brings it dangerously close to a grassy taste. It's not there yet, but you can tell how close it is.  Mouthfeel - Light for a DIPA, which I think is great. Tingling carbonation adds to the freshness and brightness.  Overall - This beer is why I don't enjoy other IPAs anymore. I know what an IPA can be and I expect it out of every other one I have.

You'd never guess this beer was about 100 IBU's. M-The hops give this a nice dry finish with just the right amount of malt.

Moderate head retention leaves some lacing around glass.  S: Lots of hops in the nose on this one, a big bouquet of citrus and pine notes, barely let any malt aroma through. Slight grassy smell hiding behind the citrus and pine. Great smell for its style.  T: Again, lots of hops. Lots of hop bitterness up front which slowly fades as the hop flavors bombard my taste buds. Some faint malt comes through in the middle and finish, but the hops are what dominate the taste. I can still taste all the hops in my mouth long after taking a sip.  M: Medium-light bodied with good carbonation, very smooth and finishes dry with a lingering tingle on my tongue from all the hops.  O: This is undeniably a great imperial IPA.

T: Got crisp citrus hoppiness. Mild malt backbone to control this hop monster. Very clean. Bite upfront with a mellow center and nice crisp finish.  M: Nice mouthfeel. OK mouth coating, not too agressive. Finish that sticks around a bit.  D: VERY drinkable for a DIPA. Too bad it isn't readily available in these parts or I would have sucked down the whole lot that I traded for.

Elder is clearer than Younger, but cloudier than Blind Pig, with a nice head, and great lacing.  The aroma is the best of the three. It's very similar to Flower Power and Sculpin.  The taste is very well balanced between the malt and the hops - seems sweeter than both Blind Pig and Younger. It again reminds me of Sculpin and Flower Power, though more of the latter, as it's less bitter than Sculpin.  This is one of the best and most balanced DIPA's I've had. The closest comparison would be Flower Power, followed by Sculpin.

A foamy white head developed up to about 2 1/2 fingers, at which point I had to start pouring. Medium retention and some lots of lace.  Smell: Sweet and soft with lots of citrus smells and some piney undertones. Makes me think of grapefruit and fresh apricot.  Taste: Pine and dry grapefruit dominates, and the fresh (but not sweet) apricot aroma comes through even more. Sweet malt on the backend with low-medium bitterness, making for a pleasant balance. After a bit, most of the flavors peel off of your tongue, with the exception of the pine and pale malt.  Mouthfeel: Medium bodied, medium but very soft carbonation. Bubbles aren't at all harsh on the tongue.  Overall: This is a really solid IPA. It isn't really overpowering in any one flavor category, and certainly tastes delicious in all of them.

Smooth malt grain notes are in the middle of the beer. Slight bread and sweetness. Floral notes and some nice dry bitterness finish off this near perfect beer. Extremely balanced brew that lives up to all the hype. Mouthfeel is perfect. Oily and silky and with great carbonation to make it refreshing as well.  O - This beer is a gift from above.

Wonderful bitter hop upfront with notes of pine and citrus. Middle is slightly sweet and ends again with a hoppy bitteriness. Very well balanced with a long lasting finish.

Appearance: Poured into my DFH Signature Glass. Pours a deep yet transparent orange with a quickly receding one finger white head. The beer produces bubbles from the bottom of the glass from many different points, and keeps going throughout the times it spends in the glass.  Smell: Great hop bouquet. It is hops hops and more hops. I can smell citrus and pine. It is so inviting and radiates from the glass.  Taste: I love this stuff. Hops right off the bat and they keep on coming. There is just the right amount of bitterness to back up the fruitiness. I do taste some malt backbone, just the perfect grain bill to balance out the hops. My mouth is always watering for more.  Mouthfeel: Nice and bubbly. Perfectly smooth. Too drinkable especially for an 8% beer but each sip is just dry enough to leave you thirsting for more.  Overall: I love this beer. The perfect DIPA, so far only Surly Abrasive can compete IMO. I have had this beer side by side with others in the DIPA style and none of those hold a candle to this.

T: similar to the nose, big time hop flavors. stuffed grape leaves. a linger of citrus that cuts between tangy and earthy. however, both the upfront flavor and linger provide fairly refreshing characteristics.

863,7971,veinless,4.51,"Pours a beautiful crisp and clean caramel burnt orange, with creamy whipped pure white head on top that laces like a dream.  Smells very citrusy (grapefruit) and floral, with lots of pine in there too. Resin is large and in charge as well. Caramel malt is big too, even in a less than week old fresh batch. Maybe I'm biased from having just had Surly Abrasive, but this beer is great but has clear superiors in my mind in the smell department.  The taste follows suit, as the hops are strong, and the pine is all over the place, to go with tons of citrus. However, the bitterness is so well spread out, and the malt sweetness in the back keeps it so balanced, that this thing never gets out of control. Smooth from start to finish, with a spectacularly clean finish that is between dry and sweet...and toes that line so well that I just want to keep drinking more of it. I've had better, but can't say there have been too many.  Carbonation is perfectly balanced with the hops and citrus to leave a tingle on the tongue to go with the pine, but is flat enough that you really get a feel for the beer and can taste everything without struggling to cut through the bubbles. Drinkability is on another planet due to the balance and finish, and the 8% abv is a complete nonfactor. I could have as many of these in a row as my body would allow, and it would be just as good at the end as at the beginning. At 4 bucks a bottle, there is no better deal on earth than this.",Russian River Brewing Company,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,100

Taste is hot, rich, and spicy. It tastes like chili pepper hot to me. A nice mouthful of flavor, but hard on the cheeks with all the slicing intensity. Long burning flavor goes on and on. Bitterness is a never-ending story. Great example of Hops Uber Alles.  I'd say the ""sippability"" is good, as long as you don't intend to actually taste anything after it.

T: Hop florals hit you right away challenging the senses of what your tasting. A mixture of grapefruit, grass, lemon. The middle continues to provide you with hops. More bitter and dry now. The finish is surprisingly not too dry. Very well balanced for a double Ipa.  M: Malty and medium bodied. Carbonation is medium and doesn't take away from the goal of this beer.

Smell: I had this next to the younger, and the smell is the only place where I thought younger won. Sweet mildly citrus hops with some malt sweetness in there as well. Not very strong.  Taste: There is less sweetness in the taste than there is in the smell. Bitter citrus peel hops hit the tongue pretty hard, there are also some pine notes in there as well. The finish is quite bitter with hardly any alcohol present.  Mouthfeel: The body is medium with a good amount of delicate carbonation. The finish is sticky and extremely dry.

Beer poured a wonderful orange with a frothy 3 finger white head and nice carbonation bubbling. Nice sticky lacing as well.  s - Unreal. The hops are fresh and perfect. Just as in the bottle, only fresher and better. This beer deserves a 10 for smell. Candied hops and perfectly balanced pine smell. Really awesome!!!  t - WHO HE! My face is blown off by the hops. Pine pine and a bit of pine hops. Finishes a bit bitter. As it warms, the hops back off a bit and the sweetness comes out and the balance in the smell comes out in the flavor. The initial hop in your faceness is a bit shocking to the palette but once you get used to it, amazingness rules. Make no mistake, this is a hop forward beer and might not be for anyone, but if you enjoy an IPA, this is it.  m - Mouth is bitter and a bit watery. Alcohol tingle is nice.  o - Overall when it comes to DIPAs, this one is the king. The smell is the highlight, but the flavor profile is a close second..gets better as it warms.

Good amount of sweet fruit, mixed with a full amount of floral hops. You can smell this beer as soon as you pour it in the glass.  T - The smell comes forward into the taste. The grapefruit is featured most prominently along with other sweet fruit. Fades into a great blend of flowery and piney hops. An absolutely remarkable taste. It's a hoppy, but soooo incredibly balanced. and blended perfectly. Incredible taste.  M - Perfect mouthfeel. Not syrupy, not dry. The sweetness and bitterness, again, blends just perfectly in this beer. That bitterness stays in the throat and the ABV is completely hidden.  Overall - A beer that lives up to the hype.

863,7971,tewaris,4.66,"100 IBU's 500 ml bottle, bottled 03.21.2011, poured chilled into a snifter on 04.01.2011. Thanks beerific/ineedbeer.  The Elder pours straw golden, bright and clear, and appears a deep shade of orange in the glass. The crown is big, like three fingers big, and creamy off white. The head retention is very good -- good to the extent that I had to sip on the foam to finally get down to business, and the lacing is great. Belgian ales have trouble lacing this snifter of mine and PtE does an excellent job of it. As noted, this is a clear beer, but not brilliantly so and that's welcome given its hop content.  Maybe my sense of smell is off today but I don't get the intensity I was hoping for. Smooth, orange candy like notes, and some pine/resin/yada yada yada but not the pungent hop aroma I wanted to get out of it. Is it too young? Maybe. Vinnie Ciluzro has said that Elder peaks in 2-3 weeks and it might still need time. Fortunately, I have more of it! Thanks again beerific.  Taste, a pure hop assault, but well lubricated. Pliny is bitter but deliciously so. Full of flavor but not fruit, this is how I like my IPA's. I am having a hard time not finishing it. Dank, bitter, sharp, cleansing, resiny, this one has all I want out of a D/IPA. Add to it the fact that it's not creamy-smooth but crisply carbonated and deeply, did I already say bittering? Doesn't coat the mouth in any way but leaves its bitterness right down to the throat after its amazingly dry finish.  What a beer! I could drink it all day. There are times when I crave a hop assault and none of the locally available beers is able to satisfy me; well Furious and Masala Mama do the job but I drink them too often. I wish I had access to this silent killer every day of my lifetime.  Mr. Ciluzro, nicely done!  Scores: Appearance 5/5; Aroma 4/5; Taste 5/5; Mouthfeel 5/5; Overall 4.5/5  PS: Anyone paying attention to my not-perfect-on-all-counts scores, don't.

863,7971,PintOHops,4.42,"Glass - Tulip  A - Hazy golden/apricot color with soft C02 bubbles. It produced a soapy pillow of head that held decently. A thin ring held atop my beer and left a couple splotches but no lacing.  S - Right upfront I get a wonderful burst of fruity hop aroma's, it smells very very fresh and inviting! I get big mango, papaya, pineapple, orange and lemon & orange zests. I also get a bit of herbal hop quality underneath the tropical fruit basket aroma. Malts are muddled and give off some bread and soft grain notes.  T - Upfront I get all the tropical fruits that I picked up in the smell. I think the juicy orange fruit stands out the most with pineapple and mango following close behind. Right in the middle I get a nice balance of herbal hop qualities with a bit of lemon zest, bready and toasty malt characters, bitterness and hop oils. It finishes with resinous hop flavors and a bit more fresh orange for good measure, the bitterness is balancing and lingers on the tongue for a good while.  M - Smooth and a bit oily with soft C02 and a medium body.  O - Wow this beer good! I think it somewhat lived up to all the hype surrounding it, and I'm happy to finally try as I live in CA for beers sake! This DIPA is definitely worth picking up time and time again, and even though it comes in at 8% ABV, it's still very smooth and can be a little dangerous because of how delicious it is.

863,7971,JosiahS,4.45,"glass: Tulip  Great looking beer when pored, nice 3-finger soapy head with a clear yet hazy golden yellow body.  Smells like fresh hops and certainly a west coast bouquet can be recognized instantly. A little alcohol peaks through for a moment but overall: sweet mango, pineapple, lemon, fresh/wet pine and spruce with soft bready notes. A simple and well blended smell, yet a complex medley of aromas.  It seems as though i've pretty much summed up the taste in the aroma portion of this review. There is a noticeable bitterness that's nice but unexpected. It starts fruity, blends with alcohol and hop bitterness straight through to the end. Lingering bitterness is there and hold off just enough as to not become off-put by it. A zesty quality comes through about mid to finish which i believe is a combination of floral hop bitterness and carbonation, it's an alright feature (if i had to comment on it).  Overall, this beer is doing everything right for me, except for the lingering bitterness. It tends to stick (or be sticky) around a little more than i like and sort of overpowers the taste buds for the next sip. I love hops and the flavors of hops but i can be picky about bitterness, especially when a beer is so mellow and well blended, such as this one.

M: Nothing too special here, but that's not to say it's bad. Good level of carbonation and good balance; this beer is full of flavor, but not so overpowering that it needs to be sipped.

Huge floral and citrus hop aroma - bright and clean, piny, resinous, hunger inducing.  T- Exceptionally balanced despite the hop overload. Hops flavor is typical west coast- clean and bright and not at all muddled. Alcohol plays in the background but does not interfere. Vinnie is the man.  M- Reasonably high carbonation keeps the beer light on the tongue, finishes clean and refreshing.

Usually I won't drink a trade beer until both sides are complete (mine is still en route) however I couldn't pass on Fresh Pliny. Bottled 3/21/11. The beer pours a beautiful amber/gold with a nice tall head. The smell is citrus and orange, the taste is the same.

863,7971,whatthehull,5,"Poured into a New Belgium snifter  A - Beautiful golden sunset, very minimal white head and pretty lace  S - Wow, the hops and the malt are so balanced. you can smell a bit of the alcohol, but very pleasing. The hops are all so complementary, pine, grass, some fruit, flowers and a bit of citrus. The malt smells really sweet, but the sweet is perfect smelling. Doesn't smell to toasted. Wheat and yeast are noted as well  T - Perfect balance again. Not to malty, to hoppy or to sweet. Just right. The yeast is nice, a bit of wheat. The grass and flowers are up front, really nice citrus and fruity hops in the middle, the yeast and sweet malt on the back end. The water used is so so fresh. Awesome  M - Perfect. Light, fluffy, a bit of carbonation. Sits on the palate nicely. The taste only gets better and it lingers in the mouth. Nice sweet meets bitter  D - 8%? Wow, this drinks like water. It's so nice and pretty much perfect. Great beer.  Final thought - Wish you could find this beer more often. Other than that.

863,7971,Preismj,4.88,"Thanks to badboyrsl84 for helping me get my hands on this. Never been more excited to get something in the mail.  a: like liquid gold. A nice rich amber that is perfectly translucent. Easily the fluffiest head I've ever seen on a beer. Thick creamy lacing with moderate retention. Edit: This guy is sticking all over the glass as I drink it...  s: Very floral scent. I am getting a lot of initial hoppyness here with a small bit of malty sweetness and a fruity citrus smell. Hints of orange and peach.  t: quick shot to the palette of hops. Bitterness right up front but it quickly clears the path for a rush of roasted malt...gives off a presence of toffee and butterscotch. Not at all an over powering malt flavor though...very mild and it doesn't stay long. I get a hint of peach, mango and orange...very tropical fruit flavor mixes at the end and is welcomed back by the floral taste of hops. As it warms, the fruit flavors come out to play much more...the initial hop flavor fades. Leaves the palette very dry yet it is incredibly creamy. You don't even know when it is gone.  m: creamy, fluffy, thick and sticky. This coats the palette so well you don't know that it is gone.  o: tremendous brew...the creamy layer in the aftertaste is what I love most about this. the first few sips hit you very hard with the bitter hops, but as this warms and your palette adjusts this becomes easily the best IIPA I've ever had and you can see why so many people search for it and love it.",Russian River Brewing Company,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,100
863,7971,Hibernator,4.87,"I had this beer on tap at Falling Rock in Denver....  Pours a golden orange with a slight haze that leaves awesome trails of sticky lacings.  The nose is phenomenal with a floral aroma and whiffs of freshly cut citrus fruits and pure dank hops.  Syrupy sweet with a strong malt backbone and a super aggressive hop presence with flavors of oranges, pineapple, freshly cut grass and peaches. A rather medium body and the finish is interestingly dry.  This is only my second on-tap review out of 800+ beer reviews on this site, but I had to document this world class beer.  Unfortunately, Russian River doesn't distribute to Massachusetts. I can only hope for the day when they do.  I noticed myself developing an insatiable thirst for this hop juice. An absolutely amazing beer and highly recommended, Pliny The Elder is one of the best beers out there.",Russian River Brewing Company,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,100
863,7971,StoneTSR,4.54,"Thank you so much to Robb at Poppy's Pizza in Estas Park, Colorado for this one. Check out my review of Poppy's and please go there next time you're in Estas, had a great time and he is one of the friendliest beer-geek restaurant owners I've ever met.  Also, I figured this is an appropriate beer to review for my 100th.  After searching for almost two years for a pint and having several close-call disappointments, Rob finally delivered two gorgeous tulip glasses full of Pliny to my girlfriend and me last Friday night. What a great find.  APPEARANCE: Orange and ever so slightly hazy. The head was not enormous, but bubbles continued to flit to the top of the glass throughout the pint. The lacing was very solid, with a thick wall of lace on the opposite side of the glass.  SMELL: My notes say that the Pliny ""smells like flowers. Like delicious, hoppy, magic flowers."" I had my nose in the glass for about five minutes before taking my first sip and I kept sticking it back in throughout the two beers I had.  TASTE: As I mentioned in my review of Founders Kentucky Breakfast Stout I mentioned that sometimes the greatest beers in the world are not as shockingly different as we might expect, rather they are simply exactly what we are looking for within a certain style of beer. This concept would apply to Pliny in my mind. It takes the palate on the precisely balanced ride that it is supposed to go on with every DIPA. It may sound odd to say, but it is a very technically sound Double IPA. Starting out sweet and piney, but not quite as sweet as a Hopslam, it slowly dries throughout the sip. The hops kick towards the end of the sip along with strong floral flavors with just a hint of honey. Elegant is Pliny the Elder in a word.  MOUTHFEEL: As I mentioned above, bubbles continuously floated to the top throughout the entire pint and that seemed to keep the beer lively during the whole experience. It was certainly better carbonated than many DIPAs, but it also had a slightly oily feel to it.  OVERALL: I am very happy I finally tracked down a couple pints. The hype is well-deserved, but may have served to disappoint me just a bit. This is everything a Double IPA, and in my mind, a beer should be - almost perfect balance with an absolutely spectacular nose, but not quite the life-changing event some have made it out to be. That said, I thoroughly enjoyed this beer and it would have been easy to keep drinking this stuff all night.",Russian River Brewing Company,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,100
863,7971,Brad007,4.26,"Finally, the day has come where I can sample the word-class Pliny The Elder.  Pours a amber-gold color with a decent head into my glass. Absolutely thrilling presentation for the style!  Hints of grapefruit and tropical fruit tingle the nose. The malt stays in the background.  Bursts of grapefruit and biscuity malt coat the mouth upfront. It's not too overpowering and the malt seems to balance it out.  Mouthfeel is full of lingering grapefruit, alcohol heat and biscuity malt. It's one of the most mellow examples I've had.  It's excellent but quite honestly, it's certainly not THE best. Worth it though!",Russian River Brewing Company,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,100
863,7971,d_hondo,4.53,"Huge thanks to Jlt6116 for sending me 6 of these in a trade. 500ml Bottle poured into snifter; bottled 2.17.11 A: Pours a beautiful clear amber. One finger white head dissipates within a couple minutes; light lacing through out beer. S: Pine, resin, little bit of citrus: grapefruit maybe? T: Great pine hop tones throughout. Little bit of malt sweetness in beginning and middle to balance but hops linger on in the end. M: Medium bodied and a slightly syrupy viscosity with good carbonation; exceptionally smooth. O: I tried not to let the hype surrounding this beer affect me too much, but this really is an exceptional beer. It's the most perfectly balanced DIPA I've had. It's not so much better than other IPAs/ DIPAs I've had (for example, Hopslam) that it blows them out of the water, but again, it is an exceptional beer.",Russian River Brewing Company,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,100
863,7971,Avagadro,4.43,"Special thanks to kingkong for hooking me up with this bottle. Dated 2-24-11  A: Deep amber in color, great clarity for a style that is overrun with hazy brews, and prevalent lacing. Head looks great to begin with, but fades to a thin film quickly. Its saving grace, however, is the fact that it leaves the layers of froth on the side of my glass that I have come to expect from an IPA.  S: Bouquet is vibrant, with tropical fruit, pine, herbs, and resin all playing their part.  T: There is a slight sweet note from the malt right at the beginning, but it is almost immediately overwhelmed by an onslaught of hops. As promised by the nose, pineapple, mango, juniper, and rosemary are all presented in the finish.  M: Medium body, great carbonation, and a touch of astringency on the finish.  O: A great brew, for sure, but I'm not sure it is really worth all of the hype. It is also guilty of a new trend that I find to be exceedingly annoying; demanding that the customers consume the product immediately. I know, I know; hops fade with time, but does 6mos really make a huge difference over 3?

T-the taste is so well integrated and smooth. the flavors really just play together and nothing seems out of touch at all. the hops are strong, lots of grapefruit and notes of pine. hints of malt underneath with a touch of sweet caramel but this is a minor presence to present the perfect balance for a hop lover.  M-lighter body but still full feel, not thin, soft on the palate with a creamy note up front and lively carbonation in the back. hint of driness and very crisp clean finish.

863,7971,suspect,5,"Poured from 16.9 oz bottle into a Duvel Tulip. Bottled on 2/24/11 (approximately 1 month old). Thanks to HEADYGLASSdotcom for the trade.  A: Wonderful amber/golden mix. Frothy white head was about 3 fingers tall after a mildly aggressive pour.. Disappeared about 8 minutes after pour but remnants of the head remained throughout the beer as I drank it. Steady stream of bubbles from the bottom of the glass to the head.  S: Obviously hop-forward, strong grapefruit presence, smell of the fruit as opposed to the smell of the rind. Hint of orange smell at the end of the sniff with pine and malt.  T: Bitter hops , sweet malt and strong citrus combine for the best tasting, most balanced IPA I've ever had. The aftertaste, which is quite welcomed, lingers for several minutes after I swallowed it.  M: Wonderfully balanced just like the rest of the beer. Coats the mouth with the creamy, but not syrupy. Tiny little carbonation bubbles coat the mouth for a few seconds before disappearing.  O: This is the best beer I've ever had. Quite frankly, I don't know how an IPA gets much better than this. I probably, unless a miracle occurs and I'm in the right place at the right time, won't get the chance to taste Pliny the Younger but I can't imagine beer gets much better than this.

863,7971,legalpete19340,4.92,A: Bright yellow bordering on gold. Thick sea foam head that stuck around and laced the glass beautifully for the entire drink.  S: Lots of citrus with lemon and pine sap coming through. There is a lot here but I cant place it all. Maybe some fresh cut flowers too.  T: Wow. Lots of bite upfront with immense orange and lemon. The pine sap comes around in the end with a final bite of pure bitterness. The malts really stand up throughout this thing without ever coming over the top. The alcohol slowly warms me up at the end.  M: Lighter than expected but not light. Not syrupy. Just medium.  O: Awesome beer. Get me another now. Huge hops but well balanced and layers of flavor. I wouldnt change a thing about this beer.,Russian River Brewing Company,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,100

Great copper color with a thick, foamy white head. This is the standard on what a DIPA should look like. Smells of citrus, earthy and grassy hops. Before each drink I always take a second to take another sniff. Taste is absolutely amazing. Taste like bitter, bitter hops. A lot of grapefruit notes shine with every drink. This one doesn't lack any carbonation. Perfect mouthful with each drink. Overall this beer is one of the worlds best. If you don't believe me read the 1,000 reviews.

He spoke if the Spinnerstown Hotel as if it was a sacred holy land of beer... He wasn't too far off! Long story short about a year after he mentioned it to me I saw the S. Town Hotel got it in on tap! I wanted to leave work early that day and fly down there asap! I walk in the door and the same dude from a year ago is tossing back Pliny's like he just bought the keg. I walked up to the bar and got my 1st one. The guy didn't remember me from before and got upset that I was ordering ""his"" beer! I told him that it's his fault because he tipped me off about it...

Russian River has clearly generated quite a mystique around this brew with their tight reins and limited distribution. In fact, at two extremely well stocked local retailers, I actually had to ask for it because they refuse to stock Pliny on their shelves, keeping it refridgerated 'in the back' for specific requests and VIPs!  Not overly hopped, and the ABV seems perfect. Excellent aftertaste. A wonderful overall experience that quickly jumped into my personal Top 10 on first try.

D: Very easy to drink, even with its bitter kick.  The first bottle I had of this I did not like at all, but this 2nd one was well worth it. Pliny the Elder is a beer well worth the effort to find.

I responded with, ""I've definitely heard of it, but this will be my first time trying it."" He told met that I was in for a treat. He was right. This had a beautiful bronze coloring to it, that normal run-of-the-mill IPAs cannot accomplish. (to be perfectly honest-I don't even like IPAs that much!) However, this was AMAZING. I was a fan immediately by the fact that the nose was lovely and floral and the taste was the smoothest IPA with the most IPA flavor. It wasn't choking me with hoppy bitterness.

The smell is incredible. The hops are a floral citrus with pine and *WoW* what a nose! Among the hop aromas you get the malt and a bit of grassiness as an accent, not a fault; quite an achievement in a DIPA.  The taste really shows the backbone of this beer. Some might call this hoppy but I call this an ultimate balance between malt and hops. The grapefruit citrus nose is there at first sip and blends sooo smoothly into a long lingering complex finish of pine and malt that rivals the complexity of a fine blended scotch.  The overall mouthfeel is a fusion with the smell and taste. Carbonation accents flavors and does not overwhelm. There is no hint of alcohol heat. The palate is left with no sharpness from harsh hop bitters.  There is no beer that I've enjoyed that matches this one, except for perhaps PtY, and honestly I rate the Elder slightly ahead of the younger.",Russian River Brewing Company,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,100

It pours up a nice hazy orange / golden color with a nice head. As the glass empties the head clings to the inside of the glass & leaves a beautiful lacing all the way down. It has a very nice piney hop aroma, very resiny & a little sweet fruitiness.  The first sip coats my mouth with a spicy, piney hop bitterness. It mellows but still maintains a nice spiciness all the way through the middle of the taste. It finishes dry & bitter but still has a pretty nice crisp, smoothness to it - it must be the malts coming in to balance it out a bit. The alcohol warms you as the aftertaste sets in but really isn't present in the flavor at all.  The anticipation of this brew really made the tasting tough on me. I was expecting to be absolutely blown away, and while the beer is very good, I wasn't. I think a few of the seasonal releases (Hopslam in particular) are better. This is still a very good beer.

A - Beautiful straw hay, slightly hop hazed, with a 1 finger head. Sticky lace and foamy that stuck to the glass.  S - Wow. Even made my wife smell it and she said Wow. She's not a hop head either. Wonderful array of floral, citrus, pineapple, grass, with a little bit of bready malts.  T & M - Smoooth. Wonderful medium body, big on taste, citrusy hops with a nice kick of juicy hops in the middle and finishes sweet with some biscuity malts. Perfect balance.  D - Polished my bottle and was craving another. With only one in reserve, had to fight off the temptation. Alcohol is nicely hidden in this at 8%. Very drinkable.  Well worth the hype. So glad I was able to pick up my first Pliny!",Russian River Brewing Company,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,100

863,7971,jakeaustin,3.82,"Bottled 2/7/11  Poured from the bottle into my dfh snifter. The slightest foamy white forms but disappears quickly after a vigorous pour. Only heard the slightest hiss when the cap was popped. Hardly any bubbles rising. Fairly clear amber color.  Smell is pleasant but fairly muted. Some hops but more bready, sweet malt than anything.  Taste starts off with a decent amount of grapefruit hops. A solid sweet malt flavor quickly takes over. As the beer goes down your lift with quite a bit of bitterness on the sides of your tongue. Hop flavor improves as it warms but is never all that strong.  Mouthfeel is fairly thin which doesn't bother me with this style. The lack of carbonation leaves the beer feeling flat and lifeless though. Finish is quite dry considering the sweet, malty flavor. Alcohol is well hidden.

I've shared a couple Ellder Plinys with friends, but this time I have the whole pint to myself, poured into a chilled chalice.  The appearance is strikingly clear golden with a small bit of froth that disappears quickly. What a great looking clear beer! It doesn't have the thickness/haziness that many DIPAs, but mysteriously still packs a tremendous hoppy punch!  Pliny the Elder smells great, though there are some other DIPAs with a stronger smell, like Left Coast Hop Juice and Green Flash Imperial. Pine and citrus come through the nose here.  It tastes great! Getting better as I progress through the pint, this is probably the most balanced DIPA I've had. Don't let the clear appearance fool you, this is a championship DIPA. Mouthfeel is also great.  Elder Pliny is dangerously drinkable! Here in the High Desert/San Bernardino county area it's hard to find though, so I'll probably stick with Green Flash Imperial @ $5 per 22oz bomber for my DIPA fix.",Russian River Brewing Company,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,100
863,7971,haazer,4.73,"Was graciously served this at the Blue Dog bar in Chalfont the day before it was to go on tap. The Beer Gods were with me on the evening of 3/12/11.  A- The head was one finger strong of everlasting white head. Great retention, refused to go down. As the beer drinks there is lacing smeared in portions of the tulip. The color is a beautiful dark gold, blended with orange and yellow highlights.  S- Nice aromas of grapefruit juice, citrus, and piney piney hops.  T- Just incredible. Lemon rinds, orange, grapefruit, such a fruity blend of flavors. Then there is a hop concentrate flavor, is how I'd best describe it. Definitely the best hop flavor I've ever tasted. The ops aren't overbearing though, the amount of bittering is perfect. Feels like a fresh hop cone in your hands, broken up and put in liquid form.  M- Medium bodied DIPA. Perfect bubbling but non prickly carbonation felt on the tongue. Incredibly smooth drinking for a DIPA.  D- Insane. Alcohol is not felt at all. Could drink many of these in a night. So thankful to have had this fresh on tap and lucky to get it when I did.

Bottle dated Feb. 7th '11  Aroma: Big fruits... almost candy-like... pineapple, grapefruit, yum...  Appearance: White foamy head, light orange  Taste: Maltier than expected, hops obviously hit right after the malt then the bitterness comes through at the end. Smoother than Hopslam in my opinion, not much alcohol presence... definitely more sessionable than a Hopslam, which is scary. Pine hits around the end as well, glad it doesn't take center stage as I think that's why I'm not a huge fan of Two Hearted. Surprised at the balance considering it's a DIPA.  Body: Medium body, drinks like an IPA almost...  Drink: Could easily drink multiple, great drinkability.  Overall: I wasn't completely blown away to be honest. It was awesome, but I think the hype is a bit much. Definitely would seek this out on tap though, I'm sure nothing compares to week old Pliny.

D-For a Double IPA, it is very drinkable. Not exactly a session beer, but tasty none the less.  This was my first Pliny the Elder and after all of the phenomenal reviews, I had nothing but the highest of hopes.

Mostly clean pineapple with a slightly dank/weed finish. Just enough bitterness.  M: Definietly not syrupy or thick, but full.

Appearence - Pours an extraordinarily clear amber-yellow. Quite a transparent straw beer. About a finger of head sits on top. Very impressive lacing that clings to glass quite heavily.  Smell - Definitely some hints of pine and citrus right away. A strong malt profile with slight caramel notes. Not overpowering in the nose at all. Light lemongrass makes itself noticeable immediately.  Taste - Wow. Some light lemongrass presents itself immediately as it dances around with citrus and zest notes. Extraordinarily crisp and refreshing. The malts in this are delicious, with a good mix of bitterness and sweetness in them. Slightly heavier on tangerine in the finish. A toasty and bretty hop/malt profile.  Mouthfeel / Drinkability - A good concoction of sweetness and bitterness. Easily drinkable thanks to the rewarding malt aftertaste. Quite dry on this finish. The ethanol is masked and blended very well. I feel like this should be classified more as an IPA as opposed to a double, but it is delicious none-the-less. Fairly excellent carbonation that is well-balanced.",Russian River Brewing Company,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,100
863,7971,pgaveau,4.8,Served from a bottle (bottled 2/7/11)aquired in trade with HuskyinPDX(Thanks man). Paired with cave aged gruyer cheese.  Bright gold appearance with a thick head. Pretty good looking beer in a tulip glass. Smells like a giant hop cone in a glass. Fresh floral aroma. Very appetizing for an IPA fan. The taste is very bold and pungent but does not linger. No long aftertaste or bitterness. I could drink this all day. No hype here. This is great beer.,Russian River Brewing Company,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,100
863,7971,StJamesGate,4.4,"Pours clear amber gold with a steady, creamy whipped egg whites head that leaves speckled trailers from the first sip. Straight fresh hops on the nose: oil, grassy, citrus and skunk. Orange, pear and angel food cake malts get bullied from the start by branchy hops which blossom into a sine wave of hops flavors: orange, nettle, chalk, and resin, with the grapefruit and pineapple that others refer to in there as well. Sweet orange rind finish and a dry, bitter but not harsh linger. Round, creamy, sticky, with the 8% well hidden.  Contains more aspects of hop character than I've ever had in one beer. Tastes more like hops than I'd imagine hops themselves do. It's not balanced - the malts barely register - but it is structured: the hops are somehow both aggressive but controlled. And for a beer that is obviously high in IBU, the flavor is still there and it never turns into a tongue-scrapper.  I'm a believer.

About a fingers worth of head that dissipates rather quickly. Really nice vibrant color. Just what you want out of this style  Smell: tons of pine, citrus, grapefruit(?), not too sweet. Finishes with a nuttiness in the back. Very well balanced scent.  Taste: Even though the bottle isn't the freshest (1/24) it still pounds your mouth with lots of citrus and pine. Those are definitely the two primary. A great bitterness that puckers your mouth but is balanced well with a slight sweetness.  Mouthfeel: Bitterness and tang. The best example I have ever had of this style. It doesn't rip your mouth apart but just leaves you feeling like you drank something worthwhile.  Drinkability: Dangerously good and easy to drink.

863,7971,GhettoFabulous,3.45,"I poured this from a 500 ml bottle into a pint glass. The label of the bottle assures me in ominous tones that something awful will happen if its contents are not consumed as soon as humanly possible.  This beer looks and smells like a standard DIPA - its cloudy golden hue exudes a smell of straight up hops, though not as many hops as I'd like to smell coming from a highly reputed DIPA. This smells more like an IPA and is surprisingly tame.  Upon taking my first swig of this, I swished it around in my mouth furiously, forcing it between my teeth and into every conceivable corridor of the pallet. There is not a lot here. Straight up hops with a modicum of citrus. The hops are balanced and done very well, but there is little else to render any complexity or excitement. I was hoping for all sorts of flavors that would accompany the hop punch, but there is only a slightly palpable hint of some nameless fruit possessive of a rind.  I look at the label again and realize this beer is only 18 days old. The label's dire warnings about letting too much time pass before you drink it might seem like an excuse for the mediocrity of the beer if this were a few months after production, but in this case, it seems a bit silly since I'm hardly worried that the rather uncomplicated flavors of this beer will fade away over time - there is not much here for it to lose.  If this beer was merely titled ""IPA"" and produced my a brewer of less repute, I couldn't imagine it being nearly as esteemed as it is by the beer community. Sculpin, Tricerahops, and especially, Double Jack, are far superior to this underachieving brew when it comes to delivering a dynamic DIPA that enlivens and challenges your senses.  This beer does well to accompany some tacos or nachos, or to throw back at some scenic relaxing vista like a creek or lake or mountainside, but on its own, it is merely an above average IPA.",Russian River Brewing Company,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,100
863,7971,pmoore311,4.63,"I have finally had the opportunity to try this elusive beer. Bottle on date of 2/7/10.  Appearance - Amazing clear amber color, creamy white head and lots of small bubbles.  Smell - Smell is great, though if I can find a flaw in this beer, I prefer the more floral nose of some of the other DIPAs out there, particularly Hopslam seems to take this category for me.  Taste - WOW, WOW, WOW, piney resinous hops, with some citrus and pineapple. The middle and finish are very dry to let the hops shine.  Mouthfeel - PERFECT, stinging light carbonation compliment the in your face hops.  Drinkability - Well the hops would really take a toll on the mouth but I could easily drink a bottle probably 2 in a sitting.  Overall this one lived up to the hype for me. Being from Michigan I have always stayed away from the Pliny vs. Hopslam debate because I had yet to try Pliny. Hopslam edges it out in the smell category, but overall I would have to give credit where credit is due and Pliny is a really really well crafted DIPA, and can say the best I have had to date although by a much closer margin than many people may think over Hopslam. To me the difference maker is I really prefer the dryer finish of the Pliny. Hopslam has a slightly sweeter taste and is certainly a top contender in the style.

Taste: the taste seemed to improve as I drank the beer, but the hop flavor was certainly very noticeable. However, this was not truly a detriment to overall taste.  Mouthfeel: one of the first things I noticed about the mouthfeel was the smooth initial taste and the complexity of flavor that helped improve on some of the extreme presence of hops.

S: Wow. Hops of all stripes. I get grapefruit and tangerine, pine and earthy must and some floral smells as well. It's all so well balanced, no one smell is pushing itself to the fore they just sit there waiting to be explored. There's an almost estery sweetness that comes from the cobination of aromas.  T: Just as I expected, layers and layers of hops, but nothing overpowering. There's a lot of pine and sweet citrus. I'm even getting a hint of fresh mint? Honey, bready sweetness from the malt makes a nice background against which to explore the hop flavors. I Passed the glass to a friend who isn't a fan of IPAs and he said something along the lines of ""if they all tasted like this I'd love IPA's."" I agree, this is how it should be done.  M/D: Carbonation is just right, on the lighter side for the style but it's appropriate for something with this flavor complexity. I'm guessing that this could be around 7%, but I hardly detect the booze at all until it warms, and even then it's muted. This is a world class beer.

T- Smooth taste, and an interesting note, about opposite taste profile of Founders Double Trouble. Where DT hits you with the citrus first, then the pine, PtE does the opposite.

Last time i had this beer it was a bottle that was a year old, i wasn't impressed and i believe that to be warranted. This one I expect to be much better, FRESHNESS is key!  A: Pours a two finger white head of thick foam that is holding in my FW pint glass for a good chunk of time. Lacing remains pretty good from sip to sip.  S: Citrus fruits come through first followed by a burst of piney resinous hop aroma. Malt is present but this beer is obviously meant to be hop forward.  T: As much as i thought this would have more citrus fruit type hops, i forgot it is a west coast IPA and exhibits powerful resinous bitter hops but they aren't upfront. Instead they crash like a wave that starts of slow but slowly mounts once it settles in your mouth.  M/D: This beer goes down smooth, almost too smooth. It has the velvet consistency of an imperial stout with the hop kick of a double IPA.

The head is slow to dissipate and leaves a ton of lacing as I drink it.  Smell: I love the smell of Pliny. Lots of resiny pine aroma, grapefruit, and fresh hops.  Taste: The taste mimics the aroma quite a bit. I taste a lot of citrus notes, pine (or nutty), and floral character. I think the hop profile helps this beer come across as more balanced than say a Ruination, since I can still feel the enamel on my teeth.  Mouthfeel: One of my favorite things about drinking Pliny is the way the resiny bitterness lingers and sticks long between sips. The carbonation is perfect. The beer is as refreshing as can be for an 8% DIPA.  Drinkability: At the previously mentioned 8%, this beer is dangerous. With the exception of maybe Sculpin, Pliny is one of my favorite hoppy beers to drink. Its the right amount of alcohol and hops without destroying my palate like some west coast beers. Well balanced and delicious. Don't really have anything to complain about.",Russian River Brewing Company,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,100

Nice retention and fair amount of lacing.  S - Strong citrusy and floral hop aroma. Grapefruit and other tropical fruits are also present. Very pleasant.  T - Full of citrus hops from the start to finish. Accompanied by some piny taste on the side, but not much. Aftertaste was oddly sweet and bitter. The hops does not have as much of a bitter bite as most other double IPAs I've had, not necessarily a bad thing.  M - The perfect amount of carbonation and body for the flavor. Not quite sure what would be lacking.  D - One of the best double IPAs out there if not the best.

863,7971,Janderson91,4.63,"Finally, the famed Pliny the Elder. Big thanks to domtronzero for sending me this one. Bottled on 01/12/11. Enjoyed on 02/27/11. Poured into a DFH pint glass.  A - Definitely the best looking beer I've encountered. A bright, clear gold color with a big white two finger head. Huge bubbles and leaves great looking lacing.  S - Grapefruit, citrus, juicy hops. Some caramel and candy sweetness also.  T - This is a more balanced beer than I was expecting but the hops are the star of the show here, there's no question. What do you expect from a beer named after the man who discovered hops? Quite bitter and citrusy initially but that gives way to a fantastic grapefruit hoppiness and caramel and candy finish. The grapefruit stays on the tongue for just long enough so that when i put it down, I want to pick it right back up again for another sip. This is the best DIPA I've had.  M/D - Mouthfeel is right on for an 8% beer. I can't even tell there is any alcohol in this thing. The easiest to drink DIPA I've ever had, it's delicious.  I was very reluctant to buy into the hype of this beer and tried to go in with an open mind, but the more I drink this beer the more I love it.

Clear and crisp, lacing like crazy.  S- A dry piney mix of hops/grapefruit/lemon. The citrus is prominent, and the hops smell fresh and pungent.  T- Much as it smells, a dry DIPA with strong piney notes. Citrus flavors of orange/lemon/grapefruit come through. The aftertaste is just amazing  M- Nice and light and crisp, but still retains a good body. The carbonation is also excellent.  D- I could drink this all day.

N: Citrus, pineapple, peach.  T/M: Hops! Citrus (grapefruit) bitterness with a peach sweetness. A dab of malty biscuit in the middle of the tongue. Bitter but so smooth and crisp. Clean body and mouthfeel with lingering oil residue (and bitterness) on the tongue. Alcohol is very well hidden on this one. Dangerously drinkable.  A little flat even though I had just picked up the growler the day before tasting; good nonetheless.  -edit- What really sets this beer aside from other Imperial IPA is mostly the crispness and clean finish. The bitterness is obviously present, but it kind of lacks that sharp ""bite"" that other DIPA have when the flavor perception transitions from the nose to the tongue.

863,7971,patm1986,5,"from the notebook  Thank you Hulmeville Inn for just rockin the S@#t every time you have this. Poured from tap into 12oz cooler glass.  A- a rustic, reddish glow of amber-orange, like the rind of a blood orange. it gathers a short, thick head at the top of the glass and settles slowly. this was poured well, too. the lacing on the head gathers a light thread-y froth.  S- hint of pine and grass and light, light malt syrup, but the GEM of all the aromatic notes is citrus: grapefruit, tangerine, a little orange-oil-or-extract-like sharpness (just a little).  T- jesu cristo. that citrus in the aroma comes to your mouth now in a mellow-bitter conflation of nearly every hop characteristic in one smooth run up the line. most notably though, i get the citrus most, which for me is king hop flavor. It's just so mellow on the alcohol and smooth on the pithy-hop finish. this is an extremely refined, restrained piece of hop art.  M- smooth, so smooth. from initial sip to bottom-swirl-and-down, it coats the mouth full-bodily. it didn't thin-out or settle into something watery and stagnant. it's a consistently carbonated and rich body all the way.  D- off-the-charts. because of it's mellow alcoholic flavor and tantalizing complexities that often come through subtly, you want to keep drinking ol' pliny to discover more and more. its body makes this quaff-able, the mild hop-bitterness makes it continually palatable.  this is it personally. it really is--haven't had younger yet though. but this it as far as DIPAs are concerned or any style I've come across. it seems the most exciting and excellent aspect attributed to this beer beyond the beer itself is its ability to fight the hype and deliver at the level of its reputation and beyond; this fact is something that not many beers can handle, personal preference aside.",Russian River Brewing Company,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,100

I have not had this on tap but it was excellent from the bottle. I had high expectations for the beer from all of the hype and it surely did not disappoint.

863,7971,hophopandaway,3.35,"Drunk at Toronado SF yesterday. The appearance was a slightly darker than norma amber-orange with no head and literally no lacing at all.  The first thing I got on the smell was alcohol and then sugar. I don't know if I had a bad pint but the beer tasted sweet, syrupy and very tangy. The start had some good flavours, thecitrus and pine flavours turned in to a rather sweet and alcoholic maltiness that I just didn't enjoy.  I'm probably wrong, just as there are people that don't like fois gras or caviar, I don't really like this. Jst a matter of taste I suppose.  I found this beer strong tasting, over-carbonated and quite thing for its high ABV, the flavou was, I thought, just hops and sweetness.

863,7971,CarolinaCardinals,4.74,"Original Review 2-23-2011 Have had Pliny multiple times on tap now. Had a couple of pints today at the Toronado in San Diego for $5.50 each. Beer was served a golden orange with a decent head that left some lacing behind-4.0. Nose is wonderful, piney and citrus hops dominate-5.0. Taste is excellent, a strong malt backbone stands up quite well to an assault of pine and grapefruit-5.0. Mouthfeel is good, medium bodied and lively on the palate-4.0. Drinkability is exceptional. This is the finest balanced double ipa i have had to date. The amazing thing is that the alcohol, although very strong, is very undetectable as one enjoys a pint-5.0 (4.84 overall)!  2nd Review 2-3-2022 A friend of mine visited Colorado for a family Christmas and he brought back a bunch of RR goodies 12-31-21 including this 510 ml bottle for $5.99. Bottled 12-3-21; consumed 2-3-22. Beer poured golden orange with a nice white head that is leaving some lacing behind-4.25. Nose is still damn good, very floral with loads of citrus. I think a lot of brewers have figured out how to make the aromatic hops work better in their process as Vinny did years ago-4.5. Taste is still that perfect WCIPA! Substantial pale malt base is greeted with a boat load of floral, grapefruit, pine, and some orange mixed in. Finishes with a perfect pine bitterness; 8/10 on my scale-5.0. Mouthfeel is light to medium bodied and still refreshing yet smooth-4.0.  Overall a near perfect beer, so drinkable and satisfying-4.75 (4.74 overall)!",Russian River Brewing Company,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,100
863,7971,websherpa,4.48,"Appearance: A clean a clear pouring beer. 1 finger of head, modest lacing.  Smell: This has the pineapple and grapefruit that so many beers have. It doesn't have the bitterness or booziness associated. It's a strong clean and clear scent, but not overpowering.  Taste: Wow. So after all the hype I just came to assume this would be an ""extreme"" beer. I was expecting massive massive flavor. Instead this beer comes with an almost quiet confidence. The beer is delicious in all aspects. It's hop flavors are distinct but well blended. The malts are subtle and offer a sweetness to compliment the hops without getting overly complicated. The finish is long and delicious. At no point drinking this beer does anything jump out of place and scream ""hey check this out"". There are hints of booze coming through that keep this form a perfect score.  Mouthfeel: Well executed.  Drinkability: This beer is great. However, for the effort and price I will never make this a regular, which is a shame. PtE doesn't make a big statement, it makes an eloquent one. This is something I would regularly and I can save the big statement beers for special occasions.

Depending on the pour it could be sediment-free or have a small amount from the bottom of the keg or bottle. Some lacing, but not a lot.  S: Strong scent of pine and citrus. Such a perfect bouquet of hops that lingers through the whole glass. The best smelling beer I have ever encountered. When this beer is fresh, nothing beats it. I would give this a 6 if I could.  T: Perfect balance between malt and hops. Starts off with a slight bitter punch and finishes perfectly smooth with malty sweetness. Tastes like you're drinking pine tree extract in the best way possible. Tastes better than Younger, IMO.  M: Smooth, medium-thin and moderately carbonated. Luscious, silky, and the perfect 'weight'. Such a smooth and delicious brew. Did I mention this beer is smooth? For an 8% beer, no alcohol is detectable.  D: Obviously I love this beer and will order and drink it whenever it's available.

A- Poured into a tulip glass... a brilliant white one finger head that drips away a leaves hints of sticky goodness. Beautiful hazy orange color with a bit of carbonation.  S- A grapefruit explosion!!! Tons of piney citrus! Lemoncake, pineapple, candy corn, with a touch of sweet malts.  T- Gigantic flavors abound! First sip is piney hops mixed with a A-bomb of citrus and fruit! Grapefruit, lemon zest, ripe pineapple, and fresh picked oranges. I love the sweet honey left on the backend of the tongue after the finish. It's fantastic, alluring, and seems to be teasing me!  M- Nice bitter hop bite with sweet and bitter grapefruit rolling around the tongue. Nice caramel sweetness, without ever overpowering the citrus blast!

863,7971,jgasparine,4.74,"Big thanks to Johnny O for this gift!  A- Poured from the bottle with a massive off-white rocky head over mildly carbonated orange-amber colored body. The head recedes to reveal some nice lacing.  S- This smells just like a bucketfull of fresh-picked sticky hop cones. I have never smelled such a wonderful hop character in a finished beer. The hops come through as piney, vegetal and earthy all at the same time. Not to say that the malt isn't there- a substantial crackerlike- almost nutty malt quality to the nose as well. Amazing.  T- I was bracing myself for some of that citrus-rind bitterness associated with big West Coast IPAs, but I was pleasantly surprised to find this beer to be a wonderful replicate of the nose. As a matter of fact, nothing about this beer struck me with the impression of citrus rind- it was all massive piney, vegetal and earthy hop flavor, with a big nutty malt backbone. The finish is equally impressive- the hops linger like a resin on the tongue long after each sip- one of the longest-lived finishes I have ever experienced in a finished beer.  M- A medium-plus body with a nice soft carbonation. Mild astringency, as to be expected from a DIPA. Surprisingly no EtOH heat detected.

Nice solid sweet malt backbone which gives a perfect balance to the bitterness of the hops.  M- Silky smooth, crisp, refreshing, and nice medium body.  D- This has everything I would want in an IIPA.

863,7971,bosox941827,4.14,"500mL bottle poured roughly into an Ayinger gold-rimmed 0.5L glass (+ room for head); poured cold and warmed as tasted A - Pours a slighty cloudy (yeast in the bottle) orange/amber; rough pour yields a rocky, foamy head that takes a while to settle and leaves lots of foam on the sides. S - Other-worldly; like crushing a pine cone in your hands; very persistent and floral. Probably in top 3 best-smelling beers I've tried (Hopslam & Sculpin just above it, IMO). T - Interesting; this is MUCH better than a bottle I had back in December. I decided not to review it then, b/c my opinion was not good. Glad I decided to wait....in any case... Malty sweetness (with a bit of hard candy in there too) off the sip, which is quickly pushed aside by the piney hoppiness. There's a real earthiness to the hops, almost like there's a bit of dirt in there (but in a GOOD way). The bitterness persists for quite a while and becomes a bit dour, with a metallic edge to it that is not as pleasing as the initial flavor. M - Low carbonation lends a smooth mouthfeel and hoppiness keep this from feeling too heavy. D - Medium; nice up front, but that aftertaste would prevent me from having too many of these. Do NOT have this issue with Hopslam, which is just as hoppy and has 2% more ABV.

863,7971,Smakawhat,4.6,"Well so this is the first Pliny out of the bottle I have had. Bottled Jan 11th 2011 and we are good to go. Opened at 10:30 in the morning having rested my palate through the night with nothing to eat or drink for fourteen hours. Thanks to TKEAnimal for the bottle.  Pliny pours a nice gold out of the bottle and leaves a simple large fist sized off cream white head. Nice uniform pinhead bubbles in the head also. The body is an incredibly clear twenty four carat gold color, with next to nothing for carbonation from the bottle. The occasional bubble pops up. The head has basic soapy tight retention and leaves sticky lacing fairly well. It really looks like a beer that came out of the tap.  The first thing off the bouquet is how incredibly balanced this beer is. Nothing is overpowering, but it contains a simple grapefruit sweet but not bitter and oily, and fresh hop character to it. Each gets a change with each other nicely.  Taste is quite enjoyable. Once again this is really balanced with a great body and feel. It's taste resembles it's nose in a balanced mix of hop and grapefruit citrus that isn't bitter or rindy with fresh apple juice qualities. Nice aromatics off the swallow also like a fruit basket quality. Eight percent alcohol level is virtually unnoticeable or detectable.  The beer also looks and tastes like something that comes out of the tap, not the bottle.

I would almost call it a good musty flavor....if only musty was a flavor. Regardless, very tasty.  Mouthfeel is viscous and lush. Perfect.  I want another now!  This was a damn good beer.

It cost $4.99 for the 22 oz. but a shitload more money in shipping!! Bottle showed bottled date of 2/7/11 **Fresh**  Poured into my ""Crab House"" pint glass. Nice head with great lacing. Looks like a great beer. Nice color and carbonation.  Smells exceptional, much like Hopslam that I drank when they first came out down here in FL. I'm not usually an IPA fan so we'll see how this goes.  T- Wow, that's nice. Very hoppy but not too bitter on the tongue. There is a strong lingering aftertaste that I have been getting used to. The taste lingers for a LONG time after I swallow this. It taste kind of like straw and grapefruit. I don't like grapefruit but this is sweeter and doable. It really hits the sour part of the back of the mouth. I'm not used to that as I am a stout drinker. As it warms the bitterness is really moving forward.  M- Great, really I don;t know what the ABV is but I remember it being fairly high. Well hidden with no alcohol burn. Hell, with the bitterness of the hops it would pretty much hide any alcohol.  D- Yeah, if I lived near RR I'd definitely get into trouble knocking back a BUNCH of these. I wonder how one of these would taste with some age on it?

Taste is predominately piney with some citrus with the alcohol being very well hidden and then the bite from the bitterness comes in on the back end.

863,7971,BerkeleyBeerMan,5,Appearance: Bright golden Orange. Nice creamy head forms. It's retention isn't perfect but it does cover the side of the glass with some mild lacing. This beer doesn't need carbonation to jump out at the drinker because it just looks plain downright good to drink.  Smell: It has notes of lemon and pine. There is a seriously sticky resinous character. This Ale presents sweet backing malts that are bright and inviting.  Taste: It really isn't as bitter as you would suppose. But it is impossible to ignore the potent hops. What matters in this beer i that the hops taste fresh. The sweeter side of the malts do come to the rescue and help the beer go down smoothly. Pliny the Elder has a delicious sour character that makes you want to pucker your lips. The taste is reminiscent of taking a bite out of a grapefruit sprinkled with sugar. The ale is punchy and tart. Luckily for the drinker the balance is so great because it takes a brilliant brewer to make a high ABV beverage like this go down so easily.  Mouthfeel: It's medium-bodied It's worth a good swish or two because that is when Pliny the Elder really presents itself to your tastebuds. Take some time to think about this beer but drink it up also. This tangy beer finishes great.  Drinkability: This is the second time that I've had Pliny the Elder. The first time I split it with some friends. It even appealed to the non-beer drinking members of our group. Tonight the bottle belongs to me alone . I am delighted to relax with this lively and stimulating beverage. I am lucky enough to live close enough to the Russian River Brewing Company. But even close to my home this beer is hard to find.

This beer certainly punches you in the nose. I got some fresh basil and citrus as well.  Taste is an amplification of all the smells from before. There is a very nice level of bitterness but overall the taste is incredible smooth.  Mouth feel is a good level of carbonation and overall is very light and smooth.  Drinkability is very high. It was not difficult at all to finish the entire 500ml bottle and more would have been OK to. This was definitely a unique IPA for me.

863,7971,SupaCelt,4.6,"Bottle dated January 24th:  Not much can be said that hasn't been said. The pour produced a strikingly clear and well carbonated body of a lovely burnt orange hue. A giant head rose from the depths and then slowly receded to a chunky lemon meringue pie cap with chunks of lace hanging all about. Cara pils malt head retention.  The nose revealed itself as the cap was cracked and the pressurized hop aromas diffused into the atmosphere. Gorgeous hops. Quite green and raw, which certainly is a sign that the bottle's rule has been abided and the beer is being consumed fresh. Not much in the way of malts, mostly just plant matter and chlorophyll tones and a generous and succulent pine bottom with a twinge of citrus twist.  The taste shows a nice malt presence. There is a very mild sweetness allowing the hops to flourish on the palate while still maintaining a superb balance. So fresh and so clean. Everything positive about hop flavor shines through in the taste and just a perfect bitterness comes through without beating the palate senseless. Pine, green, sweet, juicy, sap, leaves, all can be imagined riding atop one of the most delicious malt bases ever bottled.  The mouthfeel follows suit with a perfect texture. Medium bodied. The tangible, fluffy head is a glimpse into the substance that lurks within the bottle.  The drinkability is phenomenal. This beer could be enjoyed until it tells you to stop. Amazing flavors, great mouthfeel, hefty yet not overpowering in the slightest. It is easy to see why this is a beloved beer in our world.

863,7971,lbk105,4.97,"Much has been written about how this beer tastes after the bottle is more than even a few weeks past its bottling date, but after drinking easily over 100 bottles, I've made the following observations:  1) Keep it refrigerated! Even if your local distributor and local beer store don't do it, if you want to preserve the flavor cool it ASAP and keep it cold.  2) Don't serve it too cold. Below 40 F your taste buds are numbed, around 45-50 the aroma and the flavor are at their peak IMO.  3) Turn the bottle upside down (unless you are pouring all of it into a glass) for a couple of minutes before opening so the hops resin in the bottom re-mixes with rest of the bottle.  4) Prepare your taste buds before you drink it. Something salty or sour works for me.  The latest bottling date I have is 12-28-10, and it tastes as good as it did a month ago. This is my favorite beer in the world, and the very best amongst all IPAs (the Younger is great too, but the Elder is one you can actually take home in bottles).

863,7971,mavbrew,4.8,"Poured from 500ml into Portsmouth Brewery snifter. Bottled on 01/24/11.  A: Pours a light orange golden color with a nice frothy, creamy white head that slowly dissipates (I mean slowly) and leaves massive lacing down the side of the glass.  S: The scent has floral hops (piney scent) and huge fruity notes (mango, pineapple, hints of orange).  T: The taste up front has bite, there is a spiciness to the bitters that tingles the palate. A nice citric burst follows the bitters and then immediately following is a bit of sweet malts that balance out the hops quite nicely.  M: Medium bodied, average carbonation. Tingly feel on the palate, spice and bitters remain throughout and well into the aftertaste.  D: This is a perennial DIPA, it lived up to all the hype. Very well-balanced, everything a DIPA should be. Not a hint of the 8% ABV, just an excellent, well-rounded beer.",Russian River Brewing Company,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,100
863,7971,ClassicBrad,4.84,"Finally got my hands on a bottle of this after having it a handful of times at beer festivals. Bottled on Jan 24, 2011 and reviewed on February 9, 2011.  Pours a straw gold to sunburn orange into a Duvel tulip with a sticky head that laces very well down the glass.  Smells of sweet, citrus Simcoe and Centennial hops and more hops. This is everything I hope for when cracking into an IPA. So refreshing and crisp!  Mouthfeel is very bright. Refreshing and crisp. A gentle swirl causes a real eruption of head. Carbonation compliments this beer very well.  8%? You don't say. Just give me more.  All in all, everything its supposed to be. This has become the holy grail of hops. Glad to see this hype is well deserved. Very seldom do I have such a flawless, clean IPA with such a brilliant marriage of bitterness and sweetness.",Russian River Brewing Company,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,100
863,7971,hopburster,5,"As you can see, almost 2,00 people have eloquently described the qualities of this world class ale. Rather than adding another description, I will just say that this is a beer you must try if you love well-balanced, hoppy beers.  I've been drinking West Coast craft beer for more than 25 years and I've probably drank most of the the top-rated West Coast IPAs/DIPAs out there...Pliny is right there at the top of my list---believe the hype.",Russian River Brewing Company,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,100
863,7971,SmilinMofo,4.6,"Appearance: Golden and a little hazy.  Smell: Pine and grapefruit burst from the glass.  Taste: At first I was not getting as much a I thought I should be getting from this caliber of a beer. After letting it sit in my glass for about twenty minutes it began open up. The hops were crisp and clean and reinforced why this brew is one of the top Imperial IPA's. The freshness of the hops on my palate really surprised me.  Mouthfeel: The bitterness of the hops made the side of my mouth sweat like they would if I were to have been drinking a really dry cab. The bitterness transformed into sweetness with the finish.  Drinkability: Great beer. Remember to drink this one at the right temp, so you can truly enjoy this great brew.",Russian River Brewing Company,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,100
863,7971,oysterchef,4.82,"What can I say about this ale that hasn't previously been mentioned? Let me start by stating that I am a Chef. For years I have been writing menus and creating dishes around a wine list...so I guess I sort of understand flavor pairings. When it comes to beer, I am still a novice. Pliny is a perfect shellfish pair along the lines of a great Sauvignon Blanc. Many citrus aftertones, especially those of Ruby grapefruit and yuzu.Would work well with sashimi, crudos and ceviche. Can't wait to get my hands on more elder and hopefully get to taste the younger",Russian River Brewing Company,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,100
863,7971,palma,4.65,"This is truly one of the best double ipas on the planet. Might even be number 1. Two charateristics that really stand out to me are the mouthfeel and drinkability.  Mouthfeel is light and airy yet still chewy. It's just a perfect balance. amazing that a liquid can even act like this. where's the physicist. Its rare that a mouthfeel of a beer makes you keep wanting another sip (usually its the flavor), but this beer is a clear exception.  Drinkability is off the chart. This beer drinks like an english bitter. Pliny = session beer? not at 8%, but it sure drinks like one. This beer is going down like my favorite ESB.  Its not the taste or aroma of this beer that intrigues me so much, but rather the unique mouthfeel and incredible drinkability. The other aspects (appearance, smell, taste) are only close to exceptional.  hophead, or no hophead - seek this beer out.",Russian River Brewing Company,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,100
863,7971,KevinBrewer,4.85,"A- Clear copper with a billowy off-white head that dissipates rather quickly, but sticks to the glass fairly well.  N- Herbal, resinous hops with a touch of grapefruit and tropical fruit. Underneath, subtle caramel malt provides a nice balance.  T- Luscious herbal, fruity, piny, resinous hops blanket a strong toasty malt backbone. Citrus accents brighten your mood instantly. The complexity of the hops is pretty amazing. Perfectly balanced toasty sweetness with a smooth but firm hop bitterness. Aftertaste of resinous pine and toasty grain. I cannot taste the slightest hint of alcohol. Very well done.  M- The mouthfeel is perfect for the taste of this beer. The taste is full and chewy, but it has a medium body with a stickiness that keeps me coming back for more.  D- This could easily be a chugger if not for the alcohol. I tend to drink this beer in huge gulps and wait for the lengthy aftertaste to subside before taking the next.",Russian River Brewing Company,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,100
863,7971,trenchtown4,4.35,"I was extremely excited to try this beer, i had to bribe a co-worker to bring it back from CA for me. Drank it on 01/07/11, bottled on 12/17/10 so the hops were there in full force. For the build up to trying this, I was some what let down. The hops were bright and powerful, but I felt it lacked a malt backbone. I do enjoy west coast IPA's, but I just felt the beer wasn't balanced enough for all of the hype. I know that is sacrilege on here, but that's how I feel, personally I prefer a more malt balanced DIPA, like a DFH 90 min or Lagunitas Hop Stoopid. Overall it was a good beer, but not at the level I had been reading.",Russian River Brewing Company,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,100
863,7971,hopmonkey,5,"It is exceedingly rare that something lives up to the hype and expectations that spread like germs across the internets. So a bigtime bravo goes to Russian River (and its reviewers) for something that managed to exceed my own unreasonably high expectations.  The general characteristics have already been described much better than I know how. Suffice to say, however, that I dislike the west coast IPAs that try to outhop each other and end up with a bitter mess. Pliny is so well-balanced; the hops so delicate but powerful at the same time; and the finish so bracing but not bitter that it is easy to call this one of the best (if not the best) beers I have ever had.",Russian River Brewing Company,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,100
863,7971,Stinkypuss,4.7,"Special thanks to Owsley069 for this one.  Appearance: Poured from a slender pint bottle into a Piraat glass. Soapy, long lasting head. Decent clarity on a deep golden body. Nice lacing around the edges of the glass.  Smell: Pleasing hoppy aroma, pine, grapefruit and some malty bready note. As it warms it has a fruit snack smell. Sweet hops.  Taste: A nice mix of different hop flavors. Pine, grapefruit, pineapple and resin. Malt body carries the hops well, but the citrusy hop flavor drains it out. Juicy and a bit drying. Nice hop bite. After the final sip I immediately became depressed.  Mouthfeel: Light/medium bodied. Crisp drying finish.  Drinkability: A fine double IPA. Worthy of being sipped and savored. My first Russian River brew, would love to try more from this brewery. Similar to a Nugget Nectar.",Russian River Brewing Company,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,100
863,7971,hickmancase,4.2,"Bottle from luck at Total Wine.  A: Sticky. Innocent looking for what it is. Two finger head.  S: Bright. Hoppy. Strongly present but not overpowering.  T: Like smell. Unique IPA flavor.  M: Sticky. Syrupy but not thick. Perfect carbonation.  D: Delicious IPA. Were it not for the lack of availability, this would be the go to IPA.  Still an IPA.  9/10",Russian River Brewing Company,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,100
863,7971,CruisaC,4.3,"Many thanks to bay cat for hooking me up with a super-fresh bottle for my first Pliny  Bottled 1/24/11---I don't think it's possible to get it much fresher here in Cincinnati  Pours a nice light golden copper with about an inch of off-white head  Smells of grapefruit, hops, pine trees...I'm not adding anything new here  Taste is mild bitter hops without much sweetness. Some citrus minus the sugar of a Hopslam. Very clean aftertaste without much lingering bitterness which is a plus for someone like me (who ranks IPA/DIPA as probably their 5th favorite style)  Nice soft carbonation that clears nicely and implores you to take another sip  This is a quality brew--no doubt. You don't need my review or opinion to know that. I am certainly glad I've had the opportunity to try this beer and thoroughly enjoyed it. I can think of other beers in my cellar I'd go to before this one which is part of the problem with IPAs for me--I don't want to feel rushed to drink them. This one was as fresh as it gets but I might have saved it for another night, a special occasion, etc. I guess the special occasion was tonight--lucky me.",Russian River Brewing Company,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,100
863,7971,julian,4.4,"Bout time I review this beer...  Bottled on 01/12/11 - Here we go!  A: pours an amazingly clear pale copper color. Nice white head that builds up slowly but more than adequately and lasts.  S: Grapefruit BLAST, pine. hop resin.  T: This is not for the faint of heart. The hoppy bitterness of this beer doesn't phase me anymore (nor others of its style) but for the uninitiated, this would be swallowing a hop grenade. Nevertheless I can think anyone can appreciate the clean hoppy flavor in this beer. It's resiny and highly hoppy up front, lots of pine, a little citrus grapefruit in the middle and finishes rather smooth leaving little to no bitterness on the tongue, which lends me to believe there's enough malt in here to balance it out. Very nice.  M: Nicely carbonated, clean, crisp, refreshing. Pretty much what you'd expect from this style, and a beer of this caliber.  D: I could drink a few, heh.  Notes: someone else mentioned this as well, but the minimalist labeling is dope. I dig the whole minimalist movement, and am a minimalist at heart. Just goes to show you, you don't need a multi-billion dollar marketing budget to sell your beer when you are making good beer to begin with.",Russian River Brewing Company,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,100
863,7971,Hellabeerguzzler,4.5,"FIRST THANK YOU Ktown67 for the threesome of Plinys!  Fairly non-descript label telling you not once, not twice, but at least 10 times NOT to age this beer. This bottle is no more than a few weeks old - fresh enough for me.  The pour of this beer was perfect. Light carbonation gave it's IIPA amber color a beautiful thick head and some bubblies as well. The beer isn't crystal clear but not murky at all. The head settles leaving behind some lacing. It's beautiful and I want to drink this right now. So I will.  The smell is beautiful hops. Oh, the hops. Not since Hopslam has a beer been so beautifully fragrant with piney hops (more so than Hopslam), a little citrus, grassy, earthy. Sort of like filtering a bucket of grapefruit juice through a earthy burlap sack full of fresh lawn clippings and spruce branches. Delightful. Head is still present as well as lacing.  The taste is way hop forward so make sure you like your hops. For me though, it was not nearly all just hops. There's enough going on there that keeps you interested in taking another bite. It's a little chewy and I sense... is that caramel? Brown sugar? Who cares. It's delicious. My other favorites in this category have some flavoring added to offset the bitterness of the hops but this beer seems to do well without anything really noticeable. Very well done.  Mouthfeel is perfectly nice, not gummy, oily, or palate destroying. It's hoppy, it's flavorful, it's bubbly, it's excellent.  Drinkability is good as described in the mouth, it's very drinkable and I don't expect to have any left in an hour.  I scored this as high as I could in all categories while leaving some room for improvement but good luck trying to do that. I was expecting to be not bowled over after the previous reviews but the rating reflects this ale accurately. Superb.",Russian River Brewing Company,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,100
863,7971,wmthorne,4.7,poured into a chimay snifter on a recent trip to California. Lucky that bristol farms held me a few bottles out after I called before visiting.  I have looked forward to sampling this for some time. It has the perfect amount of fresh hops and carbonation. I did not sit on this Pliny.  This brew is worthy of its exceptional rating and I look forward to quaffing more on my next trip. The grapefruit/citrus taste from the hops is exceptional.

Very potent  T- Grapefruity hops! Very hoppy, a bit more hops, and then some hops in there. There is a bit of bready malt in there but not a whole lot. Mostly different waves of hops. Citric, minty, piney, grassy, etc  M- Medium bodied, sticky, good level of carbonation and oily from the hops  D- Very good beer.

Mango,Pineapple, super fresh citrus and pine resin blend in with the light body of this, extremely smooth 8% masterpiece. A ray of sunshine lighten up the room every time I can relive this magical moment. The brewery in Santa Rosa will not impress you with the food or decor, but a fresh Pliny of the brewpub's tap will blow your sucks off for sure. The best way is fresh here. Reasonably priced for being so expensive to brew. The fact that it is still difficult to get in CA shows that there is no compromise made by the Russian River brewing company. All about quality not quantity. Well done .",Russian River Brewing Company,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,100
863,7971,robbrandes,4.68,"What more can be added to the well-deserved impeccable reputation of Pliny? No beer has ever burned such a clear first impression in my mind.  From the first pour, the warm orange glow, wonderful head, the perfect blend of pine-citrus-alcohol aromas blasting out of the glass....  And that first taste. Is it possible to have so many competing tastes complement each other? Yes. The malt-alcohol-pine-citrus-on-and-on balance is sublime.  If you're a beer-lover, this is a must.

It pours a translucent light orange and golden color with a nice white head showing good retention and lacing.  Smell is lots of citrus grapefruit, tangerine and some piney. I also get faint sweet malt presence as the beer warms up. Very balanced aroma.  Taste has lots of grapefruit, tangerine, pineapple and piney! Bitterness follows but it is always light and delicate. Nice lingering hop aftertaste complements the fruity hop character.  Mouthfeel is extremely smooth and light for the abv. It really feels like a 5% beer. Stellar drinkability.  Does it live to the hype? Sorta. I'm amazed by the mouthfeel and drinkability, definitely perfect in that aspect, but Ive had better hop profiles in the nose and taste. I guess it is a matter of personal preferences at this point.

863,7971,mondegreen,4.48,"500ml Bottle into a Founders Balloon Tulip. Bottle dated 01/12/11. Consumed 02/01/11.  After a voyage across America, this beer is finally in my glass. It has seen more states in the past week than some people do in a lifetime, traveling by ground from California to Illinois to Georgia. Thankfully, it's cold outside, so I'm not worried about it sitting hot. Big thanks to the trader that sent me this now-legendary DIPA.  Pours a crystal clear amber orange with a frothy white cap. As the head slowly falls, it leave gorgeous lacing on my tulip. This beer is beautiful. I love a cloudy, raw IPA as much as anyone, but Pliny shows he is pure with a transparent yet bright body.  Nose strikes a gorgeous hoppy balance. I get elements of all that is right with hops - fresh citrus, bright pine, and a slight rich of dank earth. A masterful display of hops.  The taste is big and hoppy while maintaining a slight balance. A hint of sweetness in the middle with a dry, lingering finish.  Smooth as can be, this beer shows a love of the craft. Those who can get this off the shelf are lucky souls. The DIPA category is chock full of good beers, and I've had a handful that are as good as what's in my glass now. That said, I've never had one better, and I'm glad I had the chance to savor this icon of American Craft Brewing.",Russian River Brewing Company,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,100
863,7971,Beerme5,4.06,"Finally got my hands on a few bottles from John's Marketplace in Portland. Upon opening, the smell of fruit wafted out. The hops hadn't quite opened yet. It poured a hazy, golden orange. Tons of sediment and carbonation present. Upon pouring, this really opened up the nose with lots of grapefruit and apricot. The first few sips were heavy with apricot and citrus, but the back end packs a good hop bite. As the beer warmed up, the hops were more prominent, and the beer kept good head retention. I was surprised at how fruity this beer was, but how it balanced out so beautifully with the hops. Will definitely reach for another if given the chance.",Russian River Brewing Company,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,100
863,7971,tvault,4.68,Got this beer about 2 weeks old so still fresh. Looking forward to drinking some. I plan on getting a few more soon. Was as good as promised...

863,7971,letsgopens,4.72,"One of my big, hyped holdouts. Finally got my hands on some, so here we go... Bottled on 12/13/10. Pours a crystal clear orange gold with some bright golden highlights. The head is moderate in size and appears bubbly and soapy. A few sparse wisps and chunks of lace stick around behind.  The pungent aroma is evident even before I get it to my nose. Giant, bold hops: citrus and tropical fruits. Grapefruit, pineapple and resinous, sticky pine. Sweet, dry and lots of floral notes. Very overmatched, faint, toasty grain. Oily citrus zest mixed with pine leaves a lingering impression. Lusciously hoppy.  Tons of resinous pine and bright, sweet/bitter/tangy citrus. Grapefruit zest and pith along with lots of floral, piney hops. Just a hint of raw, toasted, grainy malt. Some residual sweetness blends nicely with the sticky, icky hops and citrus character. Bright and really crisp initially then quickly developing to another dimension of sticky lingering bitterness. Some peppery booze makes an appearance with the pleasantly, palate numbing bitterness. A faint note of unripened peach as it warms. Very much like Blind Pig, the unique nature of the carbonation really accentuates the mountain of hop character and creates a whole new dimension of flavor.  Again, like the Blind Pig, the flavor elements are phenomenal but what puts this brew in the 'World Class' category as far as I'm concerned is the unique and particularly well crafted mouthfeel. Very well controlled carbonation levels and bubble texture helps to expertly meld the hops, faint grains and booze notes in to a hop-forward masterpiece.  Drinkability is certainly above average for the style, mostly because of the mellowness of the still present booze notes. Despite the hype around this one, I'm attempting to be objective but for obvious reasons, having difficulty; I can't help but measure how it stacks up to the all-time DIPAs. I'll start by saying it absolutely does not disappoint. An excellently crafted brew to be sure. With that being said, I wouldn't go far as to say that it's head and shoulders above the rest. It's definitely in the mix though.  Elder's selling point for me is its amazing use hop essence while not being obnoxiously overpowering, cloying, or outrageously boozy once it warms. The mouthfeel is unbelievable and it satisfies a hopheads every desire. Certainly worth seeking out.  Although my bottle is only approximately a month old, I look forward to the opportunity of trying an even fresher sample on tap as I hear the freshest Elder is above and beyond.",Russian River Brewing Company,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,100

Smell: Somewhere between Grapefruit, Melon and Pineapple. Mouthfeel: Medium bodied but pleasantly creamy. Taste: Again, as with the aroma, this beer is very fruity, but with a good amount of bitterness. The finish is very long....I get honeydew melon and pineapple. Drinkability: Generally, I don't care for any form of IPA's, nevertheless, I think this beer is very pleasant. It definitely lives up to its hype.

863,7971,sweetLew,4.49,"Commencing my BA review career with the beer that kickstarted my craft beer obsession, and the first one that showed me that quality beer makes a statement. My bottle is dated 1/24/11 - the golden nectar has only been in the bottle for five days.  The beer pours a deep gold color, with a moderate white head that settles quickly and leaves nice patterned lacing on the glass. Reminds me of the sonoma county hills in august, with the fog just rolling in off the coast.  Whoa! Is there cannabis in there? Nope, just a rich blend of hops that create a mouthwatering aroma reminiscent of norCal's infamous agricultural crop.  The first sip brings a rush of piney and floral bitterness, followed by a subtle malt background. Each successive sip brings waves of hop personality. Tinges of lavender and grassiness continue to exude some faint cannabis qualities.  The mouthfeel is light and effervescent, easy on the palate considering the pure force of the hops. I'm a malt fiend, so I am left craving a bit more chewiness, and maybe a bit less lingering hop aftertaste.  A pint of Pliny goes down real easy - actually three of four go down real easy, just don't expect to be able to taste anything else after a few.  So what is the statement that Pliny the Elder is making? Northern California in a bottle. And it works - you can smell, taste, and revel in the Sonoma County sunshine with every sip, cannabis not even required!",Russian River Brewing Company,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,100

Tastes bitter and piney. Ha ha ... Too corny. But honestly, it's a bit too one dimensional for me. It's certainly a solid dipa but not as impressive as abrasive and hopslam.

863,7971,birderbeerer,4.74,"Pours a translucent amber/copper with a white, two-finger head. Some sticky lace, but it doesn't coat the glass.  Aroma is a lively, biting hop. Pineapple, pine, grapefruit/citrus. The hops aroma is as sweet as it is bitter but it packs a fragrant, pungent punch. Beautiful. Hop aroma flies out of the glass.  Taste follows the aroma. Big pinch of hop bitterness with an equal dose of sweet, tropical fruit flavor from the hop. And so smooth. It bites and makes you want more. Buttery biscuit malt follows but the finish is a dry piney hop. Mildy sticky.  This beer is not in competition to be the biggest beer or the most hops. Rather, it presents a manifestly smooth but powerful hop. Lush tropical fruity hops dominate. It's like hop juice distilled to the perfect point.",Russian River Brewing Company,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,100

Really well balanced: not overly hoppy or bitter, not too sweet...and that's awesome cuz I'm not really into super hoppy beers. Do IPAs get better than this? (Future edit: yes, they actually do!)  M: medium-bodied and active. Creamy nitro version plz!  D: most IPAs get low marks from me here, but this one is quite smooth and easy to put back. Doesn't get much better for an IPA.

Hoppy and fruity on the front end. Piny notes. Exceptionally well balanced. Even the burp tasted exceptional. Excellent lingering hoppiness. This is hands down the best IPA that I have ever had. I agree somewhat with an earlier review that it could have a bit more malt backbone in the finish but I think if it did then it would be like the Arc of the Covanant and my mouth would burn off when I tasted it.  I can't get past the smell, every time I tip the glass to my mouth it surrounds my nose with amazing fruity notes. I could smell this for hours.

Had this again on 2015-07-02 in Columbia, PA from a bottle I bought at the brewery. It is 6 days old. And again on tap on 2016-10-15 and 2017-02-04 in Wayne, PA at Teresa's. Most recently at the Windsor brew pub in July, 2019.  A - Almost clear gold with a slight haze with a 2-finger white head and good lacing.  S - Strong hop floral, tropical fruit, citrus and a bit of pine that fills the area in front of me.  T - Complex tastes that are heavily floral with grapefruit/orange peel/tangerine and tropical fruit flavors blended with an oily hops/light-pine resin, biscuit/chocolate malt, warming alcohol, and plenty of well-balanced and significant clinging-bitterness and malt taste in the finish. Super.  M - Resinous, a little prickly yet creamy and smooth with medium body and light-medium carbonation. It also manages to be crisp and refreshing and exceedingly well-balanced.  D - Fabulous. Glad to be visiting the LA area where it is available. Wish I could have this every day. Tastes as good in the bottle as when I've had it on draft. The only difference is tonight for some reason I'm getting a little more biscuit/chocolate malt flavor than I remember on draft. I'm diggin' it though.",Russian River Brewing Company,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,100

Poured into my Ithaca tulip  A- pours a clear, light orange with a great head of foam on the brew that is both fluffy and full. Lacing all over the glass as the carbonation rips through it. Really represents the face of a DIPA  S- massive pineapple and citrus hops absolutely slap around my nose. Good pine resin and some sweet caramel at the end too. It's perfect  T- taste is incredible! More absolute piney and citric hops all around the taste. While there is some sweetness, there are also some dry and bitter attributes. The finish is very dry and it closes out the initial sweetness. This is some incredible taste  M- good carbonation and crisp flavor that turns into a good coating on the mouth  D- believe the hype! This brew is the real deal. Not only are all the properties off the charts.... but also it's scary drinkable. I can only imagine living in Caly and getting this all the time. What a winner this brew is!

863,7971,4DAloveofSTOUT,4.33,"reviewed via notes taken on October 28th 2010. a friend from Denver brought this home when visiting family, I was very greatful.  Poured into a sam adams glass.  Appearance: golden yellow & some orange color too... briliant color with a thick white head. Good lacing sticking to glass.  Smell: Floral, citrisy, grassy, earthy & pine.  Taste: Grapefruit, pineapple, herbally pine, mint, mellow to moderate bitterness that is very pleasing. Some malty sweetness lurking in the back ground.  Mouthfeel: Sticky & slick at the same time. I can count every sip from the defined lacing lines on the glass.  Drinkability: This beer drinks like its a light bodied beer, but it not a lightweight. More of a midweight.  All U Hopheads Must Seek it Out!",Russian River Brewing Company,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,100
863,7971,Jeffo,4.01,"Big thanks to Doops for the hook up.  From a 500ml bottle into a snifter Jan 2011 bottle drunk right before Hopslam.  APPEARANCE: Pours a 2+ finger, medium looking, white head with great retention. Perfectly clear with medium carbonation evident. Amber-orange in color when held to the light, though more gamboge when not. Head slowly fades to a good wisp and leaves sticky lacing to the glass. A good wisp remains until the end and leaves lots of lacing down the glass. Pretty nice looking.  SMELL: Pale malts with citrus and lemon notes, sweet mango aromas, floral hops, and lots of pine notes. A nice nose with lots of hop qualities, though it could be a little bolder.  TASTE: Pale malts and lots of bitter pine flavors. A real pine bomb. Slight citrus and floral notes in there as well, with a touch of sweet mango notes, but they don't compete with the overload of bitter, piney hops. Big and bold; much bolder than the nose had suggested. Big and lingering aftertaste is plenty bitter with big pine flavors. If you like your hop bombs piney, this one is was made for you.  PALATE: Medium body and carbonation, and somewhat light on the palate. Creamy smooth, goes down smooth and finishes somewhat dry on the palate. I've had bottles that were definitely too astringent, though this one is a little better there.  OVERALL: Perhaps they can call this one Piney the Elder. This is a real pine bomb, and if you like that in your DIPAs, then you'll love fresh bottles of this stuff. I like a little bigger of a malt backbone in my hop bombs, so this wasn't my nectar of the Gods, so to speak. Still, this is a very enjoyable and flavorful example of the style, but I don't think it's in a league of its own. Worth drinking on a regular basis if it's available to you, and worth trading for once.  Final Comparison: Both Hopslam and Pliny the Elder were decent brews. They both looked fantastic and were enjoyable in their own way. They were very different from each other as well. Hopslam was more balanced with a stronger malt presence, as well as a bigger alcohol punch, while Pliny was a straight up pine bomb. In the end, if I had to choose one, I think I'd chose Pliny, but there are others in the style I'd have first.",Russian River Brewing Company,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,100
863,7971,SuperWale,3.74,"This is a good beer, certainly overhyped though. Well, its hard not to be over hyped when its the most hyped beer in the world but what can you do.  Appearance: Nice color, true to style.  Smell: fantastic, lots of citrus, pine and bubble gum. A little hint of sweetness and no apparent alcohol smell.  Taste: Nice and bright and hoppy. There is a strong piney taste on the finish and not much else. It is decently balanced but could use some more malt backbone.  Mouthfeel: Its a little dry on the palate not as much as Blind Pig, also it has some astringency that makes the overall coating of the mouth not as good as it should be.  Drinkability: For a Double IPA it is fairly drinkable but with the mouthfeel issues that I had with it I think that it certainly is not an everyday beer.

A: The beer is an orange-gold color, clear, with a light tan head of over 2 fingers with moderate retention.  S: This is one of those beers you can smell from several feet away. Up close and personal, it's a hopfest. Pure chaos on the olfactory glands. Pine and orange rind at first, but then like a creamsicle sort of note comes out. Citrus rind is big here again. Balanced slightly by a bready sort of character and then washed over by hops again.  T: Surprisingly balanced, and I can see why people would say this is the best. Starts with a creamy and bready sort of character with lots of hop of course, mostly citrusy, but a light pine character in there as well. Simply tastes fresh, and has that satisfactory feeling of buying farm fresh produce and having it be amazing. Finishes nicely with citrus rind and a balancing slight malt character with just a hint of alcohol, then dry on the way down. Good stuff. As the beer warms it takes on more and more pine notes. Very nice and highlights the freshness.  D: Dangerously drinkable, and goes way too fast. This is leagues ahead of many other DIPAs just for that sheer fact alone.

S - Very sweet and floral smelling. Get a good bit of lemon and grapefruit. T - Citrusy and grassy. Grassy may be perhaps an exaggeration, but it definitely tastes ""green."" Bitterness sets in about halfway through, making my mouth water like crazy. A hint of alcoholic flavor but nothing super strong. Very very clean flavor. MF - Light and creamy. I would prefer just a touch more body, but this is nearly perfect. O - Super easy drinker, given the ABV etc. I think that Heady is better (sorry, WCers), and this time it isn't so much a function of age. (Bottled on 3-21-10).

However, I don't have ready access to this so this is Pours a hazy orange with a small fluffy white head. Leaves considerable lacing. Smells slightly grassy, slightly fruity, lemony and grapefruity. Good amount of pine to the odor; interestingly, reminding me somewhat of pine nuts as well. Definitely a slight caramel element. Tastes somewhat citrusy, but I'm not getting that hoppy, mouth-puckering burst that I have come to expect from my favorite DIPAs...as it warms up (during my review) the flavor is blossoming somewhat, but not much. That being said, the bitterness profile is amazing. It begins with a mild touch of bitterness and throughout the swallow cascades beautifully (almost stepwise) down to a soapy bitter residue left at the back of the mouth. Basically - bitter profile - awesome. Fruits are lacking. I would attribute that mainly to the age of the beer. Mouthfeel is fantastic; tingly carbonation, it could be upped just slightly even. DB - alcohol is slightly present after warming but it is still quite drinkable for the ABV.  I would LOVE to review this on tap; I'm sure that this would be the A+ beer that I see others reviewing it as.

863,7971,jnelriley,3.01,"I had high expectations about this beer, its reputation certainly preceded it because it seemed to appeal to most beer drinkers. This is a beautiful beer, it has good color and looks quite appealing, however I thought that the mismatch of its grapefruit aroma and it's highly tart smell and it's low citrus draw made it oddly unstable on the palate. The extreme hop flavor was overpowering and only on the back end did I get any of what I was expecting. The taste is, as an Imperial IPA should be, a kick in the face of flavor, but it left me confused and wondering what the brewers thought when they tasted this paradox of smell versus taste. There are other Imperial IPAs that are true to their aromatic profile and I think that this beer seems to be an ultra-hopped beer in disguise. A good beer, but not something that I would tout as an example of a perfect beer.",Russian River Brewing Company,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,100

This was bottled on 1/12/11 so about a week and an half old.  Pours a a clear amber orange with a quarter inch of creamy egg-white head which dissipates to a ring at the edge of the glass. Some small micro carbonation continually stream to the top of the glass.  A very strong, pungent hop aroma with some faint sweet wheat/grass in the background. There's also some grapefruit and musk mellon fruit aromas. This is one of the better IIPA's out there. Very well balanced.  A much more mellow half hop/malt taste profile than indicated by smell. Very well balanced with a moderate hop/bitterness bite at the tail end which lingers for a few moments. The balance between the two is what makes this an outstanding beer.  Medium bodied with moderate carbonation. Enough to keeps things lively and refreshing.

Translucent body with appropriately light head for the style, and modest lacing.  Smell - Grapefruit immediately, layered with pine; it's very apparent that the hops is going to be killer. Malt and yeast smells are hard to detect under the pungent hop aroma. The beer just *smells* sticky... and citrus fruity sweet.  Taste - The hops bind up the tastebuds fairly quickly with fruity pine. The hop character is powerful enough to almost conceal the sweet rich caramel of the malt. This brew is much sweeter than most other brews with such a huge hop character. The grain even comes through with a little hop spiciness to usher it along. It finishes with remarkably little bitterness.  Mouthfeel - More carbonation that what is visible. Sticky as soon as it hits, creamy while it's in the mouth with almost no alcohol burn. The mouth and tongue become numb after a while between the hops and the carbonation. Quite memorable.

The taste also highlights piney hops and a mellow grapefruit flavor on the back end. It's a wonderfully tasting beer. The hops don't overpower. They're balanced and not overly bitter. There is just enough malt backbone to balance out the intense hopping.  The carbonation is spot on for this medium bodied DIPA. The drinkability is insane.

T - extremely clean hop flavor with the perfect amount of bittering and earthy flavor. Mostly pine, but there is a nice little hit of grapefruit to balance the hop profile.

863,7971,mjsheehan08,4.63,"Pliny  First ever Pliny experience at teresas next door in Wayne Pa.   Pours an orangey rusty hue. When held up to light, explodes into a fiery deep orange. Nice little cream head that minimizes after first sip and leaves a nice little rim of head. Lacing clings to the side of the glass in clumps.   I am a little disappointed in the glass that I was served in. It was like a mini champagne flute that does not bring out alot of the aromas of the beer. I get mild floral aromas and hops. I am thinking about spilling it out on the bar to try and get a better whiff, but I don't wanna get kicked out before I have had another beer.   Taste is amazing. Piney as hell, with alot of floral notes, pineapple, grapefruit, and a really great bitterness at the end that lingers for a while. This was def worth the wait and lived up to the hype.   Mouthfeel is full, and it really makes it's presence known on the palate. Minimal carbonation up front and it bubbles hard in the end.   This beer hids it's booze well in the taste, but I haven't eaten lunch and I can feel it in my head. This review is taking me forever.

The lacing spreads all over into a spider web of bubbly stickiness.  S - Extreme amounts of pine and then citrus of all kinds. A very crisp finish without noticing the alcohol. As I drink this beer I notice sweeter notes like butterscotch.  T - A huge hoppy beer with tastes of grapefruit, pine needle & pineapple. An excellent slightly dry and bitter finish that is just right.  M - Medium bodied that is a little creamy yet so well balanced to the carbonation. Most satisfying to the palate with some bleu cheese and crackers.  D - For an 8% beer it is highly drinkable. You would not think the abv was even that high.

Clear honey amber gold with a fluffy white head. The head left a nice lacing on the glass until I finished it. Perfect amount of carbonation and the head retention was spot on.  Aroma of pine and fresh grapefruit. Fresh citrus taste up front with piney resin in the middle leading to a slight malt backbone. Dry. Yum. This is anything but cloying. The balance is perfect. I can taste the hops. I'm surprised the beer doesn't have a green tint to it.  Light body masks the alcohol. So drinkable it's scary. I could have a six pack of these. Delicious.  I must make a trip to Russian River and Toronado to sample the ""fresh"" Pliny.

863,7971,lnashsig,5,"Thanks to Augustgarage for popping my Pliny cherry and introducing me to the kickass world of California IPAs!  Poured into a dogfish head snifter- about 3 fingers of head that lingered for about a minute before residing into some intricate lacing on the glass. Smell- hardcore pine, grapefruit, big citrus flavors on the nose. I'm already aware that I'm not worthy of the beer nirvana I'm about to experience. Taste- big beautiful bitter hops hit my palate on the front, some nice brutal hop burn here. The bitter hops quickly makes way to a nice big malt backbone that evens out this hop monster. Mouthfeel- I noticed some really nice carbonation here, also nice silky finish.  This really lives up to the hype, period.

863,7971,BobZ,4.1,"Thanks to Mike (mrunseen) for the trade. 16.9 Oz. bottle. Poured into my Duvel tulip.  Appearance: Golden yellow, nice billowy head initially that only dissipates to about a ½"", excellent sticky lacing.  Smell: As expected big hops, heavy on the pine and citrus especially grapefruit.  Taste: Follows the smell verbatim, strong on the bitter grapefruit coupled with a pine flavor on the finish. Frankly, I'm getting little or nothing from the malt, not a lot of depth or complexity to this one, dominant hops. A nice aspect is how pleasant the grapefruit bitterness is on the palate, it does not linger. This aspect helps give this beer a clean, crisp flavor. This is a very good beer for the style, but not as multi-dimensional as I generally prefer my beer.  Mouth feel: Very smooth on the palate, nicely carbonated.  Drinkability: Very nice beer and the 8% ABV is completely masked. I had two of these before deciding to review, the first was almost 2 months old and the latest was just a month old. I must say the younger beer was better (this surprised me, as I was skeptical with regard to ""how fresh"" people have said you need to drink this beer). To my taste the older beer had far more of a pine flavor, the citrus was barely there, hidden in the background behind a big pine cone. The younger had the taste I described above.",Russian River Brewing Company,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,100
863,7971,joshuaseresse,4.59,"Bottled on 12-28-2010. Big thanks to Diomede for these Fresh bottles! Split with some people at the local liquor store:  A - pours a nice orange, bronze, amber color with a slight bit of head that dies into a foam ring. I've had Pliny's with frothier heads but it may have been the glass that I poured it in. Lacing was pretty good but just didn't stay.  S - Nice citrus notes! Pineapple, grapefruit, orange and lemon rinds. Also great pine notes and slight maltiness. Smells awesome!  T - Starts off with the nice citrus notes of pineapple, grapefruit and orange, but was also followed by a pine bitterness and resin notes which lingered long after the drink, leaving a bittering flavor in the mouth (which is not a bad thing.) Little bit of maltiness and bread but that is covered quite quickly by the fruit and pine.  M - Great carbonation and smooth mouthfeel. Refreshing and crisp.  D - Way easy to drink. I love the smell and flavor of this brew. I've been drinking a lot of DIPAs lately and this one is up there, although I do enjoy Abrasive much more :) Solid brew from Russian River and is also on my seeking list.",Russian River Brewing Company,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,100
863,7971,Boitnott,4.38,"I poured Pliny the Elder into a Dogfish Head large snifter. With a dark orange hue, it looks exceptional. A cloudiness is present which makes the beer translucent. A light white colored head appears righr after the pour and lingers throughout the drink. A decent lacing also exists.  A rich hop, floral smell permeates from this beer as well hints a citrus. This continues through the taste with a nose of light citrus and a bit of pale malt flavoring. This is finish is nothing short of amazing. Lots of hops come through in the taste. The floral tastes also come through and linger after the sip goes down. For a double, the hops do create an overally bitter taste. I read in a brewing book that this effect is created by dry hopping.  The mouthfeel is great for this one. The carbonation goes great with thr flavoeing of the beer and it goes down very smooth for an IPA. I had 4 of these so far and they have all been great.

863,7971,CuriousMonk,4.5,"I understand that PTE is brewed with 40% more malt and over twice the amount of hops as compared to Russian River's already hoppy IPA beers. I was able to acquire a Pliny bottled on 12/13/10 from a contact in California. The beer poured a golden/copper light hue; remarkably clear. This beer gave off a bitter hoppy taste initally and then picked up heavy hints of pine. Admittedly, it lacks some ""oomph"" that some IPAs do. I can see why this is a popular beer among Imperial IPA purists, but I might think this is an overhyped beer as the #2 beer in the world via Beeradvocate. I am glad to have drank this highly sought-after beer which will serve as a nice benchmark against other Imperials. I very much look forward to trying Pliny the Younger on tap someday. Updated: Tried a more fresh batch from January 2011 and this beer tasted way better than the December batch. Therefore, I've upped my rankings from a B to A.",Russian River Brewing Company,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,100
863,7971,jbertsch,4.49,"Bottled on 12/17.  Appeared orange with soft edges. Faintly clear and faintly hazy at the same time. A half-finger, white, sudsy head dissipates to a film but hangs out for the duration. Laces well.  Aroma is bright - as bright as I've ever smelled any beer to be. Grapfruit and pine hops are very upfront. Also a bit floral with subtle notes of white grapce and orange.  The taste offers up tons of fresh hop flavor - and hops is the star here. Citrus notes are dominant. Finishes bitter, but the bitterness doesn't linger too long.  Properly carbonated and alittle prickly on the tongue.  Drinkability is good in slow moderation.  I see what the hub-bub is about, but I honestly feel there are other DIPAs out there that are just as good. WOuld love to have this again, but maybe not worth jumping through hoops to get it again here in Massachusetts.",Russian River Brewing Company,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,100
863,7971,basica,4.7,"A - Pours a bright, hazy orange-golden into my snifter with a one-finger thick milky white head and medium to good retention; moderate carbonation was visible amidst the liqui (4.5)  S - Upfront hoppiness on the nose with notes of citrus and pine along with big fruity suggestions with notes of grapefruit and passion fruit (4.5)  T - Pleasantly hop forward on the palate with an intense fruit explosion, well blended with a moderate touch of sweetness; fruity suggestions include notes of grapefruit, passion fruit and other delectable juicy, citrusy flavors. Past the middle and towards the finish, pine flavors were revealed along with some malty notes and a slightly above moderate amount of bitterness which, surprisingly, only comes around the finish, lasting into after taste along with the fruity notes. This is, by far, the best tasting DIPA I've ever had (5)  M - Medium-bodied thickness with a slight syrupy stickiness, apt for the style; slightly higher than moderate amount of carbonation and a creamy smooth texture as it goes down with a slight and pleasant warming (4.5)  D - First off, the PtE is the fruitiest DIPA I've ever had; in fact, it's almost to the point of being juicy and definitely to my delight. It's also not as intense or as bitter as some of the West Coast DIPAs; very juicy, delicious yet balanced for a DIPA and not overly bitter as well. Thus, very drinkable and a session that every DIPA lover would wish easy access to (4.5)  The PtE is the final of the 5 DIPAs in my horizontal taste comparison. I am glad to say that the PtE did not disappoint on the taste factor though I was expecting to be slightly more blown away by the nose and the feel. I loved the fruitiness and ""juiciness"" in the PtE and am very keen to revisit the Gordon Ale from Oskar Blues which I also recalled to be very fruity.  So without further ado, here's the ranking of the 5 DIPAs: 1st - Pliny the Elder (4.7), 2nd - Moylan's Hopsickle IPA (4.45), 3rd - Stone Ruination IPA (4.1), 4th - Dogfish Head 90 Min (4.1), 5th - Souther Tier 2XIPA (3.8). I would not strictly put the DFH 90 after the Ruination as the DFH is something you can easily enjoy a few pints of at a sitting whereas the Ruination would have destroyed your palate after half a glass.  In terms of hoppiness, bitterness and fruitiness on both the nose and flavor, the West Coast DIPAs easily trump the East coast variants and the Ruination sits on top when it comes to bitterness; Hopsickle ranks second and PtE third (Ruination and Hopsickle were considered a bit too bitter). The East Coast DIPAs were just touched with just a slight bitterness that was no where near the intensity of the West Coast IPAs. Appearance wise, none of them are stunners or a big story to bring home but the Hopsickle and the PtE looked a cut above the rest. The most easy drinking of these DIPAs (without too much of a flavor comparison here) would have to be the DFH 90 with the PtE following in second place.",Russian River Brewing Company,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,100

S: Hops are featured foremost in the smell, almost all grapefruit citrus with scant floral and pine accents. Toast and caramel are faint but detectable as well. No smell of alcohol is detected.  T: Begins off-dry and eagerly hoppy, with bitter and aromatic grapefruit peel backed by more juicy citrus fruit. The middle is drying and delicious as hop flavors lose some ground to restrained cracker and toast--though never grainy. The finish is more lingering than it is intense, with more toast and bitterness that still tastes of grapefruit peel. No alcohol is detected.  M: Thin to medium viscosity, slightly sticky but extremely smooth, with moderate carbonation.  D: A beguiling brew to be sure, this beer is famous not for the intensity of the qualities it presents, but for the way they are united so seamlessly in the final product. Pliny the Elder is so surprisingly smooth that it could change a lot more drinkers' minds about extreme/traditional/artisanal beer styles, if only more had the awareness and ability to seek it out.

The beer was poured into a pint glass, and it poured a cloudy, golden-copper color with a thin, foamy head. The beer has smells of hops and pine, with lemon-lime notes. The flavor ursts in mouth, with citrusy-sweet notes surrounded by the bitter-greens from the hops. Perfectly balanced and smooth in mouth, with a crisp finish. There is a light, sour balance to the bitter aftertaste, and no linger despite the strong flavors and characteristics. Wow! I think I just made a mess in my pants!

863,7971,Verecund,4.62,"Review #199.  Bottle dated 11.22.2010. Enjoyed on 1.7.11. Generously received from HoldensHomebrew.  Pours a slightly cloudy persimmon orange with a foamy, one-finger white head. Settles down to a ring of head and one straggling group of bubbles, with thick-bubbled lacing.  The combination of pine, citrus, grapefruit, and floral hoppiness is not unique to Pliny the Elder, but the complexity here is deeper; this is a case where clarity through words is hard to come by. The pine is sweetened through what smells like caramelized sugar; imagine sugared grapefruit for breakfast and you're close.  Lots of citrus and resinous flavor without imparting too much lingering bitterness. There's more caramel backing than I expect or remember (the bottle may be just a week or two ""older"" than perfect), but it's really driven by the grapefruit and citrus bitterness. As I get further in, I pick up on some orange and just a hint of sweeter tropical fruit notes - this is my favorite part of the beer, coming in mid-to-late palate and only as I get further through the glass.  Medium-full bodied without medium carbonation. Somewhat sticky without distracting.  The standard for a style I don't always appreciate. Drinking this now, it brings back memories of sub-par DIPAs of the past, really putting them to shame. Other DIPAs roam the earth, ghostlike, growing ever staler and hoping to be like Pliny.

I enjoy a few IPAs, but this beer was outstanding. It completely lived up to everything I had read on here about it. The perfect mix of grapefruit and pine with a perfect malt backbone.  Hands down the best IPA I have had to date. There have been a few beers on here that had excellent ratings that I found disgusting (Celebrator Doppelbock that tasted like rancid soy-sauce), but this concoction was great.

One IPA / DIPA I'll never grow out of.  Moved onto PtE and after the first sip, I just started laughing to myself and was reminded again of, and said out loud to my wife: ""This is the best beer I've EVER had.""  I won't elaborate on whats already been said in previous reviews... but at the source it's the best. I drink it at Toronado at least once a week and have a couple bottles every week. (Yes, batches vary some)  It's IPA perfection, I can find no flaws and wouldn't change a thing. True craftsmanship. Crisp, bright, clean...such a clean beer and every sip keeps you wanting another. So packed full of fresh cut grass, dank, tangerines and almost a faint strawberry-ish pineapple if you look for it underneath the tangerines. At a loss for words almost while drinking it.  Dangerously drinkable. Stays crisp and freshest of hops tasting, I could drink this all day into the night. Doesn't become sweet after a few like many of this style do. Body is a bit thicker on draft than in the bottle which to my preference is great because the bigger the PtE the better in my mind! Can't wait till Feb for PtY.

863,7971,zhanson88,4.48,"Got this one off of a trade; big thanks to Mages64. Bottled on date of 11/30/10.  Appearance: The Elder Pliny pours a clear light golden color with tons of pillowy white head. Retention and lacing are phenomenal. I really can't imagine a DIPA looking much better than this.  Smell: As expected quite a bit of grapefruit and citrus up front, I really get a lot of florals and grassiness in this one as well. The smells seem to be just a touch muted overall, but still very good. It is slightly over a month old so I'm guessing that plays a role.  Taste: I can't imagine much better than this. Pretty grapefruity up front, with a bit of malt mixed in as well. Slight citrus and a bunch of florals hit on the back end. The finish is hoppy without being overly bitter, with a clean finish. This is a very well crafted beer indeed.  Mouthfeel/Drinkability: This is a very smooth drinking beer. It's a bit on the light side with very fine carbonation. Is this beer drinkable? Hell yes, so much so that it borders on supernatural. I had to force myself to slow down and savor.

863,7971,TylerBGoode,4.46,"It's a rare sight to see a Pliny in Oklahoma. I'd only heard about the mythical beer in bed time stories and only seen it grainy photographs. Somehow though, thanks to a fellow Bartian and humanitarian, I scored an elusive bottle of Pliny the Elder.  I write this beer review not to inform the unaware public of the greatness of this brew, but rather to use it as a badge of honor to prove the fact that I actually landed a rare bottle. The appearance of this beer is light gold and filled with sediment, less than a finger width of head on top. The smell is actually not nearly as pronounced as I figured it would be, though the citrus and hops do come across. The taste is what this legend is made of though. A strong citrus hop flavor, a warm alcohol finish, a malty back bone throughout, this beer is obviously a winner. It's well balanced and highly drinkable (if only I had another to drink...). Overall one of the better beers I've had the privilege to consume. Now I know what the fuss was about.",Russian River Brewing Company,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,100

Nothing overwhelming, but good. Flavor is balanced. Extremely balanced. Hoppy, not sweet, but all in harmony with the beer. Masterfully crafted such that everything falls into place. Not a syrupy iipa by any means, this is smooth and drinkable. This is what other iipas should be compared to. Not a transcendent experience like some have claimed - this is like drinking the best of the old guard, the invention of the style.

The familiar west coast floral hop bouquet hits my nose when I go in for my obligatory nose inhale. The hops are everywhere and when drinking, blend perfectly with malt backbone. Its obvious that the brewer went for balance rather than an all-out hop war on the palate. The beer massages my taste buds the entire time.

863,7971,trippoint,4.8,"Bought six bottles today at local store - six was the limit I could buy.  This was the first time I had tried it, despite it's easy availability for me. I'm just getting into craft beers and this is my first review.  A: Not as murky as I'd thought it'd be. Imperial IPA's usually are a bit more cloudy in my experience. It's a beautiful golden orange color with a nice thick head. The head was concentrated with small bubbles in the middle forming an island surrounded by foam.  S: Citrus is the main thing you smell as soon as you crack it open. A closer whiff brings some pine forest undercurrents. Slightly sweet, yet earthy. Smells yummy.  T: The taste of this IPA puts the great smell of it to shame IMO. Again citrusy, yet slightly effervescent. Reminded me of a dry champagne, which considering the sweet smell surprised me. Hoppyness was not as strong as I had expected. It's superbly well balanced with the malts, which is why I think it excels. The high ABV causes it to evaporate off your tongue, leaving you with a crisp slightly medicated aftertaste. This is easily the best beer I've ever tasted.  M: This is hard for me to pit into words, as this is the first beer I've tried to review. It was good that's for sure. Definitely nicely carbonated, and not to thick.  D: Super smooth and easy to drink. The alcohol while obviously there is not present in a cloying amount. It was hard to sit there and review it as I wanted to drink it up right away. If it was more readily available I'd of had a couple in a row.  All in all it lived up to the hype and was as I said the best beer I've ever had.

Appearance: this beer poured a nice golden color, but produced absolutely no head, and seemed under carbonated. this could have been a by product of shipping.  Smell: the beer is extremely aromatic, its bursting with citrusy hops and a small amount of piney hop aroma.  Taste: this is where this beer truly shines. starts with a nice citrus hop flavor, followed through with a nice hop bitterness, and balanced out with just the right amount of malt backbone.  Mouthfeel: this beer is in the right place along the lines of dryness, and amount of malt that comes through, but the low carbonation hurt it a little bit.  Drinkabliity: this beer is verry drinkable, would probably have been more so if it were at the right carbonation level.  would definitely recommend this beer to anyone looking for a hop bomb, and I would love to get the chance to try another one, especially one with the proper carbonation so I could re-review it.",Russian River Brewing Company,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,100
863,7971,CooperEllis,4.35,"From marisatheyounger, thanks so much for getting it here in time for Christmas. Bottled on 11/30, consumed 12/25.  With the admonishment fresh in my ears from my brewer friends that I'm not letting enough head form, this pour was 1/3 head, 2/3 Pliny. There is so much lacing, light and fluffy full of delicious aroma and generally tracing webs up and down the glass. I like the brightness of the liquid combined with the dense bubbles which make a nice pour and release a good amount of the aroma.  I'd have to say this was the best Pliny of had; now it was the 'freshest' but I believe the pour may well have had something to do with this. Pliny is, to my taste, so light and yet there is so much favor pushed into it I feel a bit like a kid in a cheez-it commercial. Though I will say, I always miss the full citrus that I often see folks mention with this. I get the sour but not the sweet. I do not consider this is an overly 'citrusy' IPA but instead a very well balanced flavor.  The mouthfeel is nearly perfect, though my complaint with Pliny is the very bitter note I usually have at the finish which I don't enjoy. A slight bit of the booze to remind you you're drinking a brew and not a tea and it's a wrap.  (69)",Russian River Brewing Company,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,100
863,7971,claspada,4.28,"Pours a dark lemon yellow with a huge soapy white head. As the head recedes it leaves crazy stupid resiny lacing.  Aroma is an immaculate citric and grapefuit hops, with some slightly sweet maltiness in the background (pretty far back to be honest).  The taste is a hophead's dream; waves and waves of resiny, lemon, piny hops balanced out by some pale/caramel malt sweetness. Not for the faint of heart. This is the deinitetion of a Pacific DIPA. My preference is usually for more malt and more East coast hops, but I can appreciate this high quality of this offering and why it is so highly regarded.  There is great carbonation helps bring out the flavor profile and cleans the palate slightly from the hop assault. The beer feels very smooth and full bodied, but still an extremely balanced well made brew. Definitely bitter in the finish but by no means a palate wrecker thanks to the balanced sweet bready maltiness.  Overall, this is one of the top class beers on the planet for a reason; it's the epitome of great intense flavor yet retrained to dominate too much in any one category. I had this beer when I was a hop newbie and I hated it, but I am having it now right after a Hopslam and I have to say I enjoy this more for it's retrain and yet amazing flavor profile.",Russian River Brewing Company,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,100

The nose was really big with all of the standard floral hop notes. The taste was the same with a mouthfeel a little too thin to support the flavor.

A: Pours yellow-orange-rusty hue with 1 full finger head. Head dissolved slowly into the beer leaving heavy lacing sticking to the sides of the glass.  S: The nose is dominated by citrus, specifically grapefruit and maybe some orange. A slight pine aroma is present.  T: The citrus was present, but not overpowering and not as dominant in the taste as it was in the smell. Not overly bitter, but did have a nice hoppy after taste.  M: Medium bodied with a nice mouthfeel. Not overly carbonated.  D: A smooth and easily consumable beer.  Comments: I wonder what this beer would taste like if it was very fresh rather than being bottled 7 weeks ago. Next Pliny needs to be fresher. However, even after spending a near two months in a bottle, the Pliny was still better than many DIPAs.",Russian River Brewing Company,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,100

Body is clear, golden-honey in color (I poured carefully, seeing a buildup of sediment at the bottom of the bottle). A small (1/2-finger) whitish head settles on top. Sheets of lace left behind.  S: Smells of grapefruit juice. A nice nose if you like hops. As it warms a tiny bit I also get some pine.  T: Very nice - this is a hophead's dream beer. Grapefruit flavor dominates, but there's also plenty of resiny pine, which lingers into the aftertaste as an almost spicy, peppery bite. Malt foundation is there as a slightly honey sweetness - but only barely.  M: Very nice as well - juicy & smooth but without becoming syrupy.  D: Excellent. Classified as a DIPA, but it doesn't get as sticky as many that are ""bigger,"" at, say, 9% ABV or higher. Goes down more like a straight IPA, though the buzz seems to catch up to you pretty quickly.  Notes: I had a fresher bottle a couple nights ago (it was bottled 11-22 versus 11-12) and it seemed harsher all around than this one, with less of a malt backbone. I tend to doubt 10-12 days can make much of a difference, so I'm crediting/blaming the previous beers I'd had that night for making this beer seem harsher then than I feel it is now.",Russian River Brewing Company,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,100

The scents are dominated by a fresh pine hoppiness. Malty undertones come through in a biscuit honey type smell.  The taste is great, the hops shine through in the fore with a sweet citrusy taste which is followed by a palate dominating pine bitterness. I taste fresh plants and if I could eat a combination of chinook and cascade hops this is what I would picture it tasting like.  The mouthfeel is solid, creamy and not overcarbed it slams its foot down on your palate and doesn't let up.

Decent lacing all the way down my all too little glass.  s- Expertly blended hops had a great balance that is remarkable compared to most. Grapefruit and pine were the primary aromas.  t- Had a very nice balance to the pale malts, which shone through despite the high IBU. It didn't quite pack the hop punch I expected form such a notorious brew.  M- Great carbonation and a very nice aftertaste that led me wanting to finish off the whole keg!  D- At 8% this is great beer because really if this was available in PA on a non-gouging basis I would drink it all the time.  This is a damn fine IPA but I don't think its worth all the hype that some people make it out to be. I don't think I would pay the outrageous eBay prices or anything.  EDIT: Word on the street from my boys is that this is a stale keg from Craft Brew House, and that I should get a fresh bottle since it was not an accurate representation.

Lacing stays around throughout.  Smell: Great lemon and grapefruit aroma! Very strong. I don't even have to put my nose down to the glass to pick it up.  Taste: Taste of hoppy bitterness without much of the bitterness itself. I expected it but then it never came. I appreciate that being not much of a bitter beer drinker. Little bit of a citrus kick in there also.  Mouthfeel: There's the hoppy bitterness. Not bad though. Better than 90 Minute if your asking me. Again, some of the citrusy notes hanging around as well.  Drinkability: Very drinkable, especially for a DIPA. No booziness despite the 8%, and the bitterness wasn't over the top, which is more to my liking.

863,7971,weizenbob,4.51,"Received in a trade with jmkratt. Thanks John. Pliny the Elder is currently the highest rated American beer on Beer Advocate. Let's see if it lives up to the hype. 500mL bottle (dated 11/22/10, reviewed 12/23/10) poured into an oversized wine glass. A creamy finger-tall head forms and slowly subsides, leaving some thick lacing down the glass. The brew is auburn tinted and somewhat hazy. It's what you'd expect an IPA to look like.  The aroma coming off this beer is amazing. Citrus and floral hops waft effortlessly off the brew. Grapefruit and orange peel mingle with the scent of white pine sap. The floral character is somewhat subtler but is reminiscent of crushed apple blossom petals and marigolds. It smells absolutely heavenly.  In the flavor department, Pliny is a pleasant surprise. I'm not getting beaten over the head with hops as I was expecting. Hops are certainly there in spades but there's a good balance of other flavors as well. Fruity flavors are up front. There are slightly under-ripened tangerine notes that provide a nice mellow sweetness and open the door for bitter grapefruit and orange zest flavors. Subtle hop notes begin transitioning off the fruit flavors beginning in a citric fashion before becoming full-blown floral. The beer finishes bitter, with hop oils staking claim to all of the real estate in my mouth and settling in for a long residence.  Pliny the Elder also excels in mouthfeel. When I reviewed Short's Huma Lupa Licious I declared that it had the best mouthfeel of any IPA I've come across. I'd have to compare them side-by-side but I believe we may have a new champion in this category. Body is on the heavy end of medium. It is sweet without being syrupy. Plus it is incredibly smooth for a beer with such a bitter barb in the finish. How is that possible?  In speaking on the drinkability, I should first mention that IPAs are not normally my style. Having said that, I thought this bottle of Pliny drank very well. 8% ABV is pretty much hidden but the simple fact is that it's not sessionable. The scents and flavors are very pleasant; the mouthfeel is amazing. The citrus vibe even makes it somewhat refreshing. However, the bitterness is enough for me to be satisfied with just one bottle in this sitting.  I'm really glad that I had the opportunity to drink a bottle of Pliny the Elder. Is it the best beer in the country? Well, while this is very very good, I pray that this is not as good as it gets. That's not to detract from this excellent IPA but I know there's something better out there for me. Here's to the journey.  ---  The Two Schlitz Scale: (see my profile for an explanation) Without question I give two Schlitz for this beer. I know that I'm not going to come across Pliny the Elder very often in Michigan, so I'm certain that it will be a treat every time that I have the privilege of drinking it.",Russian River Brewing Company,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,100
863,7971,Bookseeb,4.8,"Just happen to find this at Collins Pub in Seattle and finally get taste what the rave is all about. Appearance has a light yellow amber with a nicley held head leaving nice lace. Smell of big malt, piney, citrus grapefruit with a big hop aroma. Taste was more mild in the hops than what came out in the aroma, but still foral and complex. A very clean honey malt sweetness that balance very well with the hops with no interference of alchohol. Mouthfeel is a nice medium with good carbonation.

T - This is Blind Big taken to the next level. More flavorful, hoppier, and bigger all around. Yeast. Citrus and pine. Malt. More floral than I detected on the aroma, with some rosemary and thyme and maybe sage. Everything is in ridiculously perfect balance. This beer is so clean tasting. ""So fresh, and so motherfucking clean."" This is like tasting perfection. This couldn't be crafted any better than it is. I'm blown away.  M - Mouthfeel is everything for this brewing company. They really, really, really understand how to craft a beer so that every part of it is uber complementary. This beer is so balanced it's blowing my mind. Man is this great. Wow.  D - I've been a beer lover for just a little over a year now and I've heard so much about Russian River and Pliny the Elder. My expectations were very high for this beer. That said, this is nothing like I expected this beer to be. I expected this beer to taste awesomely different and be this truly revolutionary thing. What I've realized after drinking it is that it's not that different from other beers - it's just better crafted. In fact, it's perfectly crafted. This beer couldn't be any better than it is and that is truly something that is extraordinary in the context of every other beer I've tried. Including beers like Founders's Breakfast Stout and Troegs's Nugget Nectar. Those beers are great, but it's because they're huge. Pliny the Elder is a pretty simple brew, honestly. But it's better than those other beers because it perfects simplicity. This is a truly perfect beer. If I had advice for people who are just starting to enjoy beer, it would be to not make this your first IPA. In fact, don't drink this until you've drank at least 30 IPAs/DIPAs, because you won't appreciate it. It's not that much different from other imperial IPAs - it's just on another level. It achieves a level of greatness that no other beer does. While other breweries might eventually achieve the level of greatness of Pliny the Elder, they will never exceed it, because this beer can't be any better than it is.  Drinking this makes me feel like I finally understand beer. Pliny the Elder takes my appreciation, affinity, and love for beer to the next level. I take comfort in the fact that I know I won't ever taste anything better than this, because nothing should ever be better than this. This is the absolute perfect beer. I am truly blown away. I am amazed that human hands crafted this. I feel like I should write a thank you note or a note of congratulations to the brewers with a tip.

It had a wonderful piney hop taste without very much booziness or carbonation. This is the first time I had to travel to seek out a hard to find beer (at least on the east coast) and while it may not be the best beer on the planet, it is definitely the best IPA on the planet.

Awesome aroma of melon and citrus, with floral and pine hints. While some beers seem to lose their aroma after a few minutes, the aroma of Pliny hangs in for the duration.  The flavor is dominated by hops with the skeleton of malt sweetness supporting the show, but hiding in the background. Tangerine and a big grapefruit flavor yield to black pepper, lingering to a bitter piney finish.  Mouthfeel is juicy and amazingly smooth for such a bitter and big beer. The carbonation is modest, leaving the mouthfeel slightly flabby, especially toward the end of the glass.  An amazing, highly drinkable beer.

The fresh hopped taste gives a wet hopped silk to the body and really has a nice prolonged lingering finish. D: I could crack bottles of this all day, as well as drink it from draft.

Blind Beer #Bonus - http://flic.kr/p/93uF2S  Well, I have a huge hunch as to what this beer is, but I'm going to play dumb. Wrapper on this 500ml bottle says pint glass, so I opted for my GL Blackout Stout pint. Pop the black duct taped cap (I love that duct tape btw) and sniff the bottle, yep its an IPA. I was too busy enjoying the aroma to really observe the head, but there is sparse carbonation bubbles and a thin coating remains.  Aroma is juicy tasty fruit, my mouth is watering as I type this. Grapefruit, orange, and a bit of pine (simco maybe?). Flavor is some light to medium malt with a nice kick of bitterness. The bitterness is balanced well and doesn't linger long at all. A subtle resiny taste is in there as well.  So, my guess is this is Pliny the Elder.  Yup! Bottled 11/30/2010 so nice and fresh. Thanks for taking the extra effort to send me this beer.

Absolutely drinkable when compared other DIPAs that often are heavy. Edit-I had side by side with Heady, Heady clearly won. But still is an amazing brew.  Edit- Added bottled date.",Russian River Brewing Company,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,100

863,7971,tzchandler,4.69,This is a well balance beer that wants to come out and play. Light yet full of hops and flavour. 8% ABV yet it feels well balanced.  This has a lot of that craft brew taste. Fresh and hoppy. The hops are not overwhelming but are front and center.  I can only hope to find this on tap some where.

A: Pours a clear golden-orange color with a big white to beige head which dissipates leaving some lacings around  S: The smell is a must: Incredibly grassy-earthy-herby-flowery hops. Never ever felt such a fresh perfume of citrus hops in a beer. The malts and yeasts foundation is also perfect. Really unique  T: Well, the taste is just perfect. Perfect American double IPA. VERY refreshing considering the 8% ABV. Amazing bitterness, balanced. Really impressive...  M: Full body. Good carbonation. Hoppy bitterness as aftertaste  O: Extremely drinkable and refreshing beer.

863,7971,heebes,4.85,"500 ml bottle Thanks to oregone for the hookup.  Pours a light straw orange amber, semi-cloudy with a one finger off white head. Nice lacing remains. The nose is perfection; citrus and pine hops blended with a malt backbone. Taste is sublime; a hop forward IPA - bitter in the middle and lingers long into the finish. Pine is noticable upfront with light citrus notes. Maltiness is blended so well. Medium bodied mouthfeel. Such a drinkable beer! If only this was available here, it would be my beer of choice every day. Amazing.",Russian River Brewing Company,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,100
863,7971,TheSevenDuffs,4.77,"Review notes from 12/7/10. Bottled on date of 11/11/10. Thanks to BrianTheBrewer30 for this fresh bottle!  Poured in to Duvel Tulip glass.  A - Poured a slightly hazy orange/yellow colour. Not completely cloudy, some light passes through. One finger of bubbly off-white head formed. A little bit of lacing.  S - Bursting with bitter citrus hops that are fresh and juicy. Some light pine notes as well. Grapefruit, tangerine, mango and pineapple. A noticeable but not predominant sweet caramel backbone. A truly exceptional nose.  T - Bitter hops up front. Relative to the nose, more pine and less citrus, but both are still very present. Some grapefruit, orange peel and pine; the tropical fruit notes from the nose aren't evident in the palate. A nice sweet caramel malt backbone that is just present enough to provide some balance. Definitely a hop-forward IPA though. A nice bitter dry finish.  M - Medium body; silky and chewy. Oily. Lightly carbonated.  D - Definitely one of the best I've had. Right up there with Hopslam.",Russian River Brewing Company,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,100
863,7971,skivtjerry,4.57,"Pours with a medium sized sticky head, golden color, slightly hazy. Aroma is,uh, hoppy; nice pine and citrus with some cannabis notes. Taste is much like aroma, plus slight sweetness and alcohol. A little sticky on the tongue - a good thing for a DIPA. Mouthfeel is medium all around, dried out by alcohol but sweetened by fruity hop flavors. Bitterness is slightly harsh, a little out of balance with the hop flavor. I can't really say I'm disappointed with a beer this tasty but it doesn't quite live up to the legend. In fact, I preferred the Blind Pig we had just prior to Pliny. It might be an age thing - my bottle was bottled on 11/11 and drank on 12/11... I hope to someday have it fresh on draft.",Russian River Brewing Company,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,100
863,7971,SirRuss,4.7,"A: Golden orange with brilliant clarity and a clean white head. Retention is brief, but the tight cohesive foam suggests quality carbonation ahead. The lacing is moderate-good, but in no way unusual for the style.  S: Pine and soft citrus gently usher in notes of menthol, and a peculiar underlying subtle funkiness - almost reminiscent of sweating cheese - hides unexpectedly in the background.  T: The front-palate presents a light, non-descript freshness, accompanied by a sprinkling of powdered sugar. As the delicate malts transcend into the mid palate, their buoyant sweetness is framed by the proud, sharp entrance of the hops. Initially it appears as an ornate frame with bold peripheral biterness distracting from the delicate complexity of this brew. But as the transition continues, the subtleties roll in and out of one another, and it is this exquisite interaction which -for me- makes the beer so god damn good. If you want to talk flavors, citrus zest and grapefruit, powdered sugar, pine, resin, and a very slight biscuitiness are the cast of this show, but like an unforgettable independent film, it's the behind-the-scenes players - the producers, the directors - who make it come alive.  As the head hinted - excellent carbonation. It carries the flavours expertly, acting like velvet wheels on a royal carriage. I could talk about how well the alcohol is disguised, or the way in which the crisp freshness and bitter hops sit in perfect balance with the oxymoronic charismatically-modest malts. But what needs to be noted is that this brew is iconically quintessential. It's like a chic elite party. Everyone who's anyone is in attendance; they've all come out looking their best; and everybody mingles with flawless, elegant etiquette. To read a review is like looking at the photos the next day - you can get a idea of what went on, but the only way to capture the true atmosphere is to attended yourself.",Russian River Brewing Company,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,100
863,7971,mdaschaf,4.7,"Thanks to forgetfu and THECPJ for bottles recently.  A: Pours a golden color with a large white head that lasted for quite a long time. Beautiful lacing remained the entire length of the glass.  S: Smells incredibly fresh. More pine than citrus, but both are present. There is a lot going on here, some spruce/pine as well as some earthy/grassy hops with some grapefruit and other citrus near the end.  T: In a word, perfect. Very well balanced. Upfront there is a hop bitterness, similar to the nose with tons of pine and a malt sweetness to round it out. The citrus is subtle, but adds nicely to the overall flavor.  M/D: Medium bodied, very crisp. Feels relatively light for a DIPA. Overall, its an amazing beer. Very smooth and easy drinking, one of my favorites.",Russian River Brewing Company,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,100

There may be slight malt sweetness. Aroma, again, is an explosion of citrus with a wonderful pine hop finish at the end. Medium to Full body, Finish is surprisingly dry. Got this from my sister in Puyallup Washington.

863,7971,SkunkWorks,4.1,"Thanks jenray for the trade and the opportunity to try this!  Bottle dated 11/11/10 and drank on 12/8/10, so its just under a month old. One thing I already like about this beer is that they print ""Drink fresh or not at all"" on the bottle and then actually print a bottling date. Nothing is worse than no bottling date on an IPA.  500ml bottle poured into a tulip glass.  Look: started with a conservative pour but noticed I wasn't getting enough head, so I gave it a more aggressive pour to end up with a one finger head. The body is hazy, orange/amber. The head is slightly off white and it retains fairly well and ends up leaving a decent amount of lacing in my glass.  Smell: grapefruity, floral, and resinous hops with a hint of pale malt in the background. Given the hype around this, the smell is quieter than I would've expected but it is still quite good.  Taste: follows the nose nicely. There's grapefruity, citrus hops and some floral hops along with some malty flavors like biscuit and toast with resinous hops giving it a dry, hoppy finish. Again, given the hype around this, the taste is fairly subdued. Where's the orgasm of hops in my mouth? Its still quite good though.  Feel: sticky, full bodied, moderate amount of carbonation and the alcohol warmth is hidden very well. Great mouthfeel.  Drink: very drinkable. I could drink this quite a bit.  So, you know when someone talks up a movie to you for a long time? ""Oh, man its so good! Its the best movie I have ever seen! Its totally gonna sweep the Oscars! YOU HAVE TO SEE IT!"" then you actually do and its a let down because well, it has to be because nothing is as good as the hype. Well, Pliny the Elder is that in beer form for me.  Perhaps it isn't fair, but because of the hype it gets in the forum and the fact that it is the number 2 beer in the world right now, but as soon as I sipped it I began comparing it in my head to beers such as Ithaca Flower Power, the Southern Tier DIPAs, Captain Lawrence IPAs, Stone's Ruination IPA and regular IPA, Bear Republic's Racer 5 and I can't help but think this is up there with them but it doesn't stand above them.  Maybe it is because what I had wasn't fresh enough or because it isn't on tap, but since I am reviewing what I have in the bottle in front of me and I don't think less than a month is enough time to kill a beer, nor should it be enough time to kill a beer. I will however endeavor in the future to have this on tap at the Russian River brewery and hopefully I can see what this is all about.  You definitely should try it given the reputation this has but I recommend you do so with an open mind and try your best not to buy into the hype. Its definitely enjoyable and if DIPAs are your thing, you are probably required by law to try this one. I also can't wait to try the rest of the Russian River line up.

863,7971,CBlack85,4.42,"Thanks to JAYBLACK for this one.  Bottled on 11/2/10 Consumed on 12/7/10  Poured from a bottle into a Smuttynose big beer balloon glass.  The beer pours a slightly hazy orange/amber color with a big foamy white head that slowly recedes leaving behind lots of sticky lacing. There is a steady stream of carbonation throughout the life of the beer.  The aroma fills the room with floral, piney hops as soon as the cap is popped on this gem. The aroma really opens up as the beer is being poured and starts to showcase some citrusy notes as well. No real malt aromas to speak of  The flavor is bursting with piney, floral hops. Not nearly as much citrus in the flavor as in the nose. Lots of hops, but not as bitter as I would have expected. Just the slightest malt presence provides a hint of sweetness to help with keep the bitterness in check. Surprisingly there is really not much in the way of alcohol presence, hard to believe this is a 8% beer. Medium bodied and smooth with a moderate amount of carbonation and a dry finish.  Really quite good, and I can see what much of the hype is about. I tried to make sure that I did not approach this beer with my expectations too high (based on the tremendous amount of hype), and was very happy with this west coast style IIPA.",Russian River Brewing Company,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,100
863,7971,ToAzwethinkweizm,4.57,"Date: 7 December 2010 Glass: Standard 10oz snifter Type: 500ml bottle  It's been over a year since I sampled this with my best friend Vince (chenzo). It was a time when I knew little about beer. Vince shipped this to me from the West coast. Thanks guy.  Bottled 18 October 2010, but kept cold. Poured 60ºF into two standard 10oz snifters, producing a thumb-sized head with better-than-average lacing (only slightly runny). Color is pure clear gold. Head reduces to a film. First noticeable aroma: lavender. I've used it in homebrews before...and this is the first time I have smelled it in a craft beer. This double IPA is not over- or under-hopped in the slightest. Aromas of perfectly balanced pine and citrus (grapefruit mostly), and a slight sting on the nose like...mint! Mint? Wtf? Well, I like it. Swirled, then tasted, begins with light pine, tropical fruit in the middle, and ending with sweet malt on the palate. Excellent balance between bitter and sweet, hop and malt. This beer hides the 8% ABV perfectly, making it a sneaky session beer in my book. I could get flamed for saying that, but my definition of a session beer is a beer in which you can drink one after another for the rest of the night without the intention of getting drunk. Most people would probably think that 8% is too high. Since I can handle my alcohol, this would be the perfect beer to have all night long. The mouthfeel makes me think that this is a light-bodied beer, although I could be wrong! Is my mind playing tricks on me? Nope. Instead, we give credit to RR for a wonder double IPA.  I wish I could write more about this beer, but not until I visit Vince in California and drink this on tap.",Russian River Brewing Company,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,100
863,7971,BruChef,4.22,"Had the chance to try this the first time from my wife's cousin Chris who was generous enough to share it with me (along with a Westy 12 the same day. Chris, you da' man!). Reviewed when I had it again after my buddy kyle brought it back from his honeymoon in Cali. straight from the brewery, born just 3 weeks ago. Thanks for thinking of me bro!  Poured into a Bordeaux glass and took pleasant notice of the somewhat rustic, slightly hazy, golden, orange color. Slight off-white head, lingering, about a finger and a half inch thick. Aroma was well balanced, slight caramel malt and fresh, piney, citrusy hops. Even more well balanced was the taste.  This is not a hop bomb like i initially thought it would be. The hops are forward but countered by a complimentary amount of malt presence. What can't be ignored, especially if you had a fresh bottle, is how fresh the hops taste. It's just too hard to explain. It's especially easy to drink because the alcohol is barely detectable...until it warms up a bit. The hops also really intensify as it warms almost making it pleasurably harsh if that makes sense. Mouth feel is slightly sticky and medium bodied. Carbonation is pleasant enough but i feel like a tiny, tiny bit more would help the already fantastic aroma become even more explosive.  This beer is hella drinkable but should be savored too, in order to experience it at various temperatures. I don't know that i've had an (double) ipa in which flavor characteristics change so much as it warms. A fantastic beer overall. Split it with a worthy friend to enjoy the perfect amount.",Russian River Brewing Company,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,100
863,7971,orangesol,4.6,"Served on-tap into a snifter at TJ's 7th anniversary party. Not the first time I have had this one but still one of the best.  A - Pours deep, hazy, orange with a small cap of white head that stays strong throughout the entire glass leaving thick lacing down the glass.  S - Strong piney, citrus, hops hit you full blast. A bit of sweetness from the malt helps balance it out but once it begins to warm up, more and more hops keep coming out. Absolutely intoxicating.  T - Starts with a bit of pale malts giving way quickly to a massive onslaught of citrus hops. Finish is a bit sweet with lingering hop biternes. I have had this beer quite a few times now and it is still one of the best beers I have ever had. One of the best DIPA's out there.  M - Medium body and flavor with moderate carbonation. Tons of hop bitterness in the finish that lingers for some time. Very good but it could be a tiny bit better.  D - I think I could drink this every day for the rest of my life. With out a doubt one of the best DIPA on the market today. My personal favorite, thats for sure.

863,7971,BigDoug,4.97,"Bottle dated 11/2/10 poured into a tulip.  Finally got one!!!  Pours a perfect creamy white head. Little soapy foamy bubbles. Slightly cloudy pale orange. Lacing is medium and spotty.  Smell is drop dead amazing. Inviting me to a hop party. Tropical fruits, pine trees, mango, grapefruit, with a pinch of biscuit and caramel malt under it all. I wanna smell this forever.  Taste made me sad I only had one bottle. Same as it smelled. Perfection. Bitterness is potent but unbelievably balanced. Hops hops hops and biscuit left in the aftertaste. Most brilliant tasting beer I've ever had.  Mouthfeel is dead on my style. Oily and medium. Perfect carbonation.  Drink is unreal easy to drink. No alcohol detected. You'd think a beer with this high of IBU's would be hard to drink more than one but I could drink a few of these before feeling completely overtaken with hoppy glory. Sadly, only bought one bottle due to the big price tag and limited availability. Thank you Russian River for making my night just awesome.

863,7971,nmoreilly,4.69,"Had this for the first time at the Monk's Kettle in San Francisco CA on Thursday, December 2, 2010.  A - A bright golden sligthly orange color. I expected it to be more cloudy for some reason but it clearly was not. A light, foamy head of just over one finger I would say  S - Wow. Lots of citrus, oily pine, a hint of caramel, floral and maybe even freshly cut grass. Became more intense after it warmed up a little. This is without doubt the best smelling IPA I have experieinced  T - Unmistakeably west coast, fuity, piney hops in the front. I didn't get too much in the way of malt. Bitter towards the back but not overpowering. No alchohol  M - Good carbonation but not over the top.  D - Very drinkable for a IIPA. In fact it's too drinkable.

I'm getting grapefruit, orange, a little apricot and pine in there as well. More citrusy than piny which surprised me. A little malt smell in there. Just incredible.  T.  Again, outstanding. piny hops and malt up front. A little of the citrus hops in there as well. The bitterness is there right up front, but the malts continue throughout the drink and really smooth it out. I little more piny tasting than I'd like, but expected for a west coast IPA.  M.  medium bodied beer with absolute perfect carbonation. This beer goes down so smooth. I wasn't expecting this from a DIPA.  D.  If I had easy access to this I'd drink it every day if I could. Such a smooth tasty DIPA. I feel fortunate to have a friend out in Northern Cal to ship me these.

863,7971,Estocker,4.79,"Served on tap at the RR brewpub.  S - One of the most enticing aromas of any beer I've had, Sculpin being right up there as well. Huge whiff of grapefruit and wet pinecones. I can't detect any malt or alcohol.  T - The taste is incredible. Unlike some (I)IPAs who leave something to be desired after inhaling their aroma, this one does not disappoint.

863,7971,AndyAvalanche,4.54,"Thanks to bombadil for the trade. 1 pint 9oz. bottle poured into a Duvel Tulip Style Glass. When I cracked it open the foam crept it's way to the top of the bottle and one big bubble came up and came over the top. I've had that happen a few times but usually the bottle in some way got shaken up a little bit, but not this time. The beer pours out a light golden/amber color, a little lighter than I expected, slightly lighter than most DIPA's I've had. There was initially a big, thick, orange, creamy colored frothy head. I thought there was going to be a fair amount of lacing, but there really wasn't, the lace trickles it's way down after each sip. A little disappointing, but still pretty good.  The smell is exceptional. It gets even better as it warms up. There is a hoppiness to it that is truly complex and intriguing. A beautiful blend of a various array of hops. Citrus, pine, foral, herbal, and even has a nectar/honey sweetness like aroma to it. It maintains it's potency without being to strong. Probably one of if not the best smelling DIPA's I've ever had.  If I were to describe the flavor of this beer in one word it would have to be ""complex."" The same multiple hop notes carry over from the aroma to the flavor. Initially it really isn't anything special, but there is a lingering effect that is quite tasty. It starts bitter then sweetens up a little, but the sweetness seems to be coming from not only the malts but the hop combination has a play on this. There is still a sweetness to it that I can't quite put my finger on, it brings me back to that honey/nectar but I don't think those are really ingredients, could just be the way it's brewed I guess. On a strange side note, this beer burps up awesome, which is what bumped it up to a 4.5 in my opinion.  The complexity continues in the mouthfeel. It is both light and full bodied all at the same time. It has the light fruitiness and full maltiness aspects of big DIPA's. The Drinkability is outstanding. It's a slightly lower than average alcohol for a DIPA, but has a lot of big flavors as the big boys.  I'm a little conflicted, I really did enjoy it, but I enjoy this style. I wasn't as blown away as I expected. I guess I just gave into the hype. I'd love to review it again sometime and get the opportunity to review a fresh one. It's not available in MA so I gotta trade for it. I feel lucky just to have the opportunity to try it, and I don't think it'll be the last. Who knows maybe some day I'll get to CA and get to review a fresh one, sounds like a pretty good day.",Russian River Brewing Company,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,100
863,7971,bernie879,4.62,"Poured my first Pliny (props to Jolon for hooking it up) into a Duvel tulip with the aroma filling the air.  The ale had a brilliant orange-gold color, capped by a 1cm white head, which dissipated after a min. leaving a nice display of lacing.  The freshness of the beer is clear not only in the bottling date(11-02-10), but also in the aroma which is composed of nice citrus meets floral characteristics. Beneath the hops lies a sweet, breadiness from the malts.  Taking the first couple sips, the beer comes across with a medium body. The carbonation is just about right on, allowing the ingredients to make the impression by just being high enough to enhance the experience. Right before the beer slides down the throat, a dryness comes out which results in my body begging for more.  The taste seems to higlight the grapefruit, citrus notes of the hops more than other characteristics. The hops also create a pleasant spicyness which comes out more in the flavor than the mouthfeel.  This has got to be one of the most drinkable 2xIPAs I have had. The hops levels meet the maltiness just right allowing the beer to be enjoyed for what it is while my general experiences of 2xIPAs usually results in a muddle of malts and hops. PTE is smooth, spicy, sweet, dry, floral and citrusy IPA that is simple in terms of enjoyment, yet complex once one delves into it.",Russian River Brewing Company,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,100

As the foam settles the carbonation remains.  S. Sharp evergreen hop aroma with a hint of sweet orange peel. While the nose in overwhelmingly resiny hops- there is a sticky- sweet malt undertone lurking in the darkness.  T. The taste is effervescent, piney hops from the very beginning. Many DIPAs are overwhelmed by such hops but this one has plenty of other things going on. There is a dry biscuity malt backbone to carry the hops along with a fruity sweetness and firm bitter finish that leaves you wanting more.  M. Chewy and bold it is light but still satisfying. The carbonation is just enough to accentuate the hops and keep things entertaining.  D. A true pleasure, and something everyone should try. I cannot even begin to think of what I would do to get this distributes in my area so that I could savor it more often.",Russian River Brewing Company,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,100

863,7971,mfunk9786,4.89,"From notes (2010 Capone's Black Friday event). Hype doesn't become hype by mere coincidence, you know...  A: Orange. Neon freakin' orange, with slight rays of sunshine. Think Pumking. Really stunning in the glass, looks like a warm summer's day.  S: Grapefruits, lemons, oranges, and Christmas trees. Total hop bliss. Like hops that've shed their scent into warm water for hours. Hop tea. I would dab this behind my ears if it were accessible as a cologne.  T: Just picked today grapefruit flesh and lemon juice, not too bitter. Juicy, juicy hops - the west coast style that favors juicy citrus flavor over earthy bitterness.  M: Startlingly light, easy on the tongue. Absolutely no detectable alcohol presence.  D: If sessioning this beer were possible in terms of price and availability, I could imagine it sneaking up on the drinker remarkably quickly.  Like everyone, I'll just point out that if this were more readily available in bottles, I'd buy a case every couple of months. Really lovely, even surpasses Ruination IPA in terms of west coast DIPA glory.",Russian River Brewing Company,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,100
863,7971,Jemonster,4.9,"A: Very beautiful gold/amber color with faint white head. I poured it slowly so it didn't build much. It leaves a sticky lacing. When drinking, the tiny bubble carbonation moves in the glass like fireworks.  S: Wonderful! Peachy and sweet.  T: The first flavor is a peachy sweetness with grapefruity citrus, followed by hoppy IPA bitterness. Then at the end there is the peach again, and a lingering hop bitterness. I think that the bitterness hangs around a little too long at the end and its a little too much to me, so I can't really give it a solid 5...it's more like a 4.8.  M: Viscous and tingly. It's just great.  D: It would be a 5 if only it weren't 8%, and the bitterness faded just a little faster.",Russian River Brewing Company,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,100
863,7971,wrightro07,4.4,"What is there to say about this beer. It has been reviewed over and over again. It is a great beer, plain and simple so to speak. I received this beer from a friend and the appearance was a nice amber colouring that just glowed in the light. The smell had a great hoppey quality that you just had to smell before every sip. The taste was good not exceptional. The reason why I say this is due to the fact I believe that it would have tasted better fresh. The bottle I had seemed to not be as hoppey as I would have hoped. Basically the drinkability is please may I have another. If you have not tried this beer get one fresh and don't wait to drink it.

863,7971,bernardus1212,4.85,Finally my first Pliny. Poured into my favorite westmalle chalice. Beer is a darker shade of orange but still glowing. The smell is a perfect balance of sweet and acidity. The sweet is pineapple tanderine and the acidic is orange and a hint of lemon zest. Taste is off the wall! Ive always said that a perfect beer is well balanced. This one comes as close to percfection as it gets. The mouth feel is soft and inviting. I could drink this all day long.,Russian River Brewing Company,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,100

A - Great slightly hazy golden orange color with a nice 1 finger eggshell white head that has nice retention to it.  S - Incredible aroma here. Fresh pine and citrus hops all over the nose. Earthy and grass notes come out slightly as the hops really take the forefront here. There seems to be more pine than citrus present.  T - HUGE hop punch on the palate, but in the most pleasant and pleasing way. Pine and citrus flavors roll over the tongue. Pine and grapefruit seem to be the most noticeable flavors. Absolute perfection.  M - Nice and crisp and quite refreshing really. Slight tingle from the hops but a nice clean finish. Aftertaste is everything I would want a beer to be.  D - So nicely done that it really is one that could be had all day. The hops are so well integrated that it doesn't kill the palate like most big IPA's can do.

However, that head was thick, rocky and beautiful. It stayed around for a long time and was wonderful to work with. Te beer itself was a wonderful clear orange. Just a marvel to look at in the glass.  The nose reminded me a lot of (512)'s IPA that I had earlier in the week. Just a ton of hops. Citrusy and piney.  The flavor of the beer was like drinking a citrus juice. I could swear I tasted some grapefruit pulp in there... There were some nice piney hop notes, too. The malt backbone was solid, but definitely more of a role player. This beer reminded me a lot of (512)'s IPA, but it finished a lot cleaner and was more balanced. The carbonation was wonderful and I kept coming back for more sips. I started the night with this beer and I had to come back to it to finish the night, too.

863,7971,Gmann,4.6,"Bottled on 10/08/10  Pours a slightly hazy golden honey color with a large dense off-white head that slowly slowly settles into quite a puffy cap with a sheet of lacing on the glass. The aroma is of grapefruit hops with some tropical fruit notes; some pepper as well. It is a nice fresh aroma but seems to be a touch muted. The taste is quite similar to the aroma. Nice grapefruit and tropical fruit hop aromas, with a dash of pine. An unassuming honey malt serves as a base for the beer but helps showcase the hops. The feel has a solid moderate feel with some tingly carbonation, finishes with a piney hop bitterness. The carbonation does a really nice job breaking up the malt body. The ABV is nowhere to be found. A very enjoyable DIPA; great balance between the hops and malt. I appreciate a hop forward DIPA as opposed to those sweet malt bombs. The bitterness doesn't linger so it clears the palate nicely. I am probably looking for a bit more fresh hop flavor but you can't beat the balance.  Review #1100  2/20/11 Update  Had another sample which is about 4 weeks old compared to the 7 week old previous sample. The hops have a much more ""buddy"" flavor to them. They kind of taste like what weed smells like and I like that. All of the other stats remained constant.",Russian River Brewing Company,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,100
863,7971,philipashley,5,"I doubt I can add anything more insightful to the already stellar reviews of this beer, but I feel compelled to add my cent(s).  I have had this beer in bottle and recently on tap at the Russian River Brewery (took a little trip to Santa Rosa last week). Both experiences were delightful.  The thing that most impresses me about this beer is that it manages to avoid the heavy or syrupy consistency one can get from a double IPA. To get at the high alch level, there must be an abundance of sugars, but this beer doesnt come off as heavy as other DIPAs. It has a wonderfully clean and dry-ish finish with excellent grapefruit forward flavors (my favorite fruit note in an IPA). All in all, this is a perfectly crafted DIPA and I wish I could install a tap line from Santa Rosa directly to my place in DC.  Well done, Russian River! Also, check out their Sours...amazing.",Russian River Brewing Company,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,100
863,7971,jtk,5,"This is my first 'real' beer review/tasting ever. I hope to get better at this and I realize it is not very detailed and probably derivative of other reviews, but the following is what I noted about this superb beer.  So here it goes:  Appearance: A bit hazy, gold color. Poured with one finger head.  Smell: Pine. A hint of strong citrus.  Taste: Pine first and foremost, then citrus (grapefruit maybe?), with an earthy finish.  Mouthfeel: Crisp with perfect carbonation to match taste. Almost creamy which is an added bonus for an IPA.  Drinkability: Yes. All night if I had the money and tolerance, which I don't on either count. I'm usually good after one of these. Sometimes two. Then I'm really good.

But it was the freshest I could score and I'll come back to update this when I have a newly minted one to review and compare.  That said, for its lack of freshness it was still a solid solid brew. A great initial bite nearly comes through the nose along with florals, and looking at the pour it's a lovely headed amber/golden hued West Coast IPA through and through. Exactly what you would expect, and done well. The taste follows that hoppy bite with a citrus presence, and a bit of a malt backbone. Sorta sits there like a Sculpin.  Ahh, and a clean finish too. Although start to end I couldn't say this stood out from other well done WC IPA's, I can easily say that I'd drink it again. When I'm in the mood for getting slammed (that's what she said?) with hops. Or feeling special.  ----UPDATE--- Yeah, it was the freshness, and that the beer was unsettled. This is a damn great beer.

Nice clear pint glass with no logos. Nothing to distract me. Man and glass and beer.  Fresh smells jump out of the glass. More pine than citrus. More earth/grass than usual for standard IPAs (like a cross between a regular IPA and a fresh hop.) Given how wonderful the taste is, I felt the smell could have been more intense, but I'm nitpicking. Would have rated it 4.75 if I could have.  Taste is simple, really. Pine then citrus then grass then earth. No tropcial notes. No alcohol. Just balanced enough with a straightforward malt sweetness that helps the hops shine without bruising my palate. Flavors wonderfully integrated and in their proper places. No significant floral or buttery tastes to muddle things.  Great mouthfeel. Zesty, crisp. Heavier than a typical IPA, not heavy like DIPAs. Clean finish. No odd flavors linger or show up on the aftertaste. Next sip please.  This is the platonic ideal for an IPA in my eyes. It's not as interesting (tropical) as some others.

Hoppy and balanced with a decent malt character. Little bit of bitterness but the hops are more there in full flavor rather than overly bitter. Very tasty. The fact that it's 8% is masked by the full body of the beer.  Seeing that this is well carbonated I'm surprised as to how smooth it is. It's very easy on the palate and is a treat.  This was my first RR ever and I'm glad I had the chance to get my hands on some. This is quite the tasty brew and definitely one of the best IPAs that I have had. I could drink this all night.

Big Hop Aroma is the least I can say, this boy gives you a chariot ride of fireballs rushing through the night sky listening to Rush - Tom Sawyer. In all honesty, tons of floral hops hit the nose, followed by a citrusy almost pineapple like sweetness. Delicious.  Taste is where it all comes together. Balancing this heavy of a hop load with the right amount of malt is where I came to appreciate this beer for what it is. Epic. Heavy on the hops, balanced perfectly by the maltiness. f balanced  Moderate carbonation, with a fairly oily mouthfeel. Alcohol is barely noticeable.

Hop taste is exactly as it smelled, very strong, but balanced with bitterness perfectly.  Drank 6 bottles weekly. 1st bottle was a week old and delicious.

Taste- Fresh and bright with none of the resin that is so often the bane of DIPAs. The bitterness that comes through at the end is strong but not overwhelming.  Mouth- The carbonation helps keepthe mouthfeel light while still maintaining the fullness that is associated with the style.  Drink- This is not a one and done beer as many in the style are.

The taste was just like the smell. Hoppy grapefruit. It starts strong and fades to a creamy sweetness, unbelievably enjoyable. The feel is very creamy especially after the beer is swallowed.

This is a hop head's delight. The finish is bitter. The aftertaste is clean, matching the flavors, all of which linger on the palate. This is the second time I have had Pliny and it is as good as I remember. If you like American hop forward IPA's, this is a classic, excellent and high benchmark example of the style.

Light refreshing mouthfeel. The alcohol will leave you a bit fuzzy in the head if you don't drink much like myself, but you definitely can't find any traces of it otherwise.  I'm not a huge IPA fan.

M - the great carbonation and slight maltiness make this brew almost float across the palate while adding great flavor from the hops and citrus.  D - I only have two but could go all night. Awesome!",Russian River Brewing Company,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,100
863,7971,unclejimbay,4.5,"Enjoyed on one of a few BA/Rare Beer Night Tastings during the month of September 2010. I was not able to take deatiled notes on this one, but I did make some shorthand and took mental notes in order to prepare a small review. I plan to take more deatiled notes on my next opportunity to try this rare find.  I was able to try a ""fresh"" one and one a few months old during the 9/2010. Enjoyed them both as fine examples of a hop flavor fwd IPA with citrus character. More on the dry side for an IPA, looking fwd to trying one again and taking more detailed notes.",Russian River Brewing Company,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,100
863,7971,StephenRich,4.32,"Another infamous beer is siting in front of my face. A few months ago I was able to enjoy the Westvleteren 12, the highest rated beer on the planet. Now I am about to enjoy a bottle of the Russian River Pliny the Elder; the second highest rated beer on the planet. I have learned quite a lot about drinking these so notoriously famed beers, most notably is not to concern yourself so much with its fame. This could be the most powerful influence on your perception of taste before you have even had the beer. So to best enjoy and evaluate the beer you must ignore it. So I will say no more of its rank.  Russian River's Pliny the Elder is a West-Coast Double American IPA. Pliny the Elder was actually a Roman Naturalist, scholar, historian and writer. Russian River seemingly dedicated this beer to Pliny's memory because he was among a few who created the botanical name for hops, lupus salictarius, which later became known as humulus lupulus. There is no IBU measurement listed on bottle or the web site, but simply because of its dedication and origin, we can rightfully expect something pretty hoppy.  The Pliny comes in 500ml bottles and is available year round in California. I do like that Russian River is selling it in a 500ml bottle rather than a 355ml. Honestly for a quenching IPA, even one at 8%, more is better, and 355ml usually just wont cut it.  I opened the Elder up cool around 8C (45F) and poured it into a few snifter glasses to share with my friends. The pour was smooth and silky unfolding out of the glass with a oil-like texture. It hit the glass hard and built up with a heavy glowing amber liquid. A head was slow to form, but by the end of the pour a solid pale white foam had build 1 inch over the beer showing relatively dense carbonation and a creamy cap. The beer was really shinning at me. It was a bright and shimmering orange with hints of amber brown and big golden streaks beaming through it. The Pliny was totally opaque, and settled into a smooth and attractive beer.  The nose is all hops showing a resiny punch of west coast, and highly aggressive earth aromas. The biggest up front is a sticky pine and woodsy aroma that bring with it a soft wave of citrus, grapefruit and lemon peal. It has hops written all over it and is brimming with the oily aromas of fresh humulus lupulus. Malt sweetness shows hints of sugary caramel and a balancing act of mellow pale malt, but they are nonetheless only there to help showcase the triumph of centennial, warrior, chinook, simcoe and columbus hops. It is actually very nice and smooth and not pungent or sharp. Great aroma.  With my first few sips I tried to get through the wall of hops to try and find some malts, which I did... But there was no fighting it. This beer was built with a purpose. Smooth and gentle waves of hops ride into your palate showing a layered complexity of hoppy flavors. Piny fresh needles, citric fruits, clean zest and sweet earthiness all play along together in a harmoniously quenching hop symphony.  There is a mellow and smooth malt sweetness that does shine though. It is clean and gentle with classic pale malt and gentle caramel flavors. Smooth and easy is its duty here as to not disturb the presence of the hops. At the back end of this beer hops still shine though. The tangy sweet hops that came in front brought tropical flavors of pineapple, orange zest and grapefruit. Now though I am being quenched more by earth, apples and pine needles. This is a hopehead's beer, that is for sure.  From start to finish this beer was quenching and very delicious. What impresses me is the complexity and layers of flavor that the hops bring rather than just a simple one sided hop blast. The texture and mouthfeel too are perfect with a smooth and elegant feeling balancing off moderate, but appropriate carbonation. It finishes cleanly with more citrus and pine leaving you with a fresh palate, and wanting more. The only thing I could still want is a slight more malt. Enjoy the Elder with spicy foods, chicken wings, steak, soft cheeses, dark chocolate deserts, or a cigar.

863,7971,spinrsx,4.5,"500ml Bottle  Bottle acquired in a trade with swedes21 - thanks buddy! Bottled 10/18/10  Appearance - The beer pours a slightly hazy amber/orange colour with a fair size fizzy and frothy off white head. There is a very high amount of carbonation showing and there is some very nice lacing on the sides of the glass. The head stuck around for around 5 minutes before it dissipated.  Smell - pine, hops, pineapple, citrus zest, floral notes  Taste & Mouth - There beer has a spectacular mouth feel - it doesn't feel as carbonated as it looks. It has a nice light feeling while remaining creamy and velvety. The beer starts with a sweet sugary pineapple flavour and then leads into a piney hop bitterness. It finishes with a strong hop aftertaste that lingers within my taste buds even after a few minutes have passed.  Overall - I wasn't sure what to expect with all of the hype about this beer. It is without a doubt the best imperial IPA I have had to date. You can really tell that they used very high quality ingredients in this beer. Worth seeking out.",Russian River Brewing Company,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,100

863,7971,gkunkle,4.67,"I was fortunate enough to have some Pliny shared with me. This particular beer had been bottled only 28 days before we opened it, so I feel confident it was a fairly accurate representation of how it should taste. This poured a deep golden or copper color with a decently sized white head. Head retention was good and it left a little lacing. Smell was of citrus and fruit in addition to the hoppy smell. I found it interesting that the smell highlighted the citrus but the beer has more of a pine flavor in the taste. Starts out with the citrus and a little bit of pine hop, then hits the little bit of malt in the middle and finishes off with a bitter pine hop. Mouthfeel is good, light/medium body with moderate carbonation. At first I didn't really appreciate Pliny, but I think I get it now. It's been a few months since I tried it last and now, as I sit outside a SoCal bar I appreciate Pliny. It still isn't my most favorite IPA or DIPA but it definitely makes the top 3.

D - Very drinkable.  Overall - I had heard a lot about this beer and I had to find it when visiting CA. I had one on tap at Stone Brewing and was extremely impressed.

863,7971,misinformed,4.57,"500ml bottled on 10/8/10, enjoyed 11/3/10 in a pint glass.  A- Clear golden orange beer with active carbonation. On this occasion I only got about 1/4"" of large bubbled white head that quickly faded to a small slick. Nice blobby lacing left behind as well as thick glass coating curtains when swirled.  S- Excellent smell. Inviting sweet citrus & fruit with pine undertones. Sounds cheesy, but this is my definition of an intoxicating aroma for sure.  T- Doesn't dissapoint one bit. Great citrus and pine flavors up front with a touch of mellow malt for backbone. I almost can't taste the malt at all. Finishes with a mellow, but long bitter/pine finish.  M- On the lighter side of medium, I'd say. Good carbonation. Faint mouth coating which helps with the lingering bitter finish that keeps me reaching for my glass. Incredibly clean.  D- Destined to disappear fast. I wouldn't have guessed this was classified as a DIPA. Incredibly smooth and easy drinking. The balance leans towards the hops of course, but the taste is just perfectly balanced between the citrus and pine hops. A supremely drinkable, enjoyable and all around awesome beer, although there are other IPAs and DIPAs that may be more interesting flavorwise.",Russian River Brewing Company,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,100

The color is a bright apricot peachy orange tint.  Aroma is heavy on the citrus and grapefruit mixed with a bit of a pine sap eeking through.  Taste is off the hook citrus bitters and followed by a balanced butterscotch sweetness. The finish is a touch more of the bitter only slightly piney.  mouthfeel is very balanced.

The resiny hop goodness is what makes this so palatable, not the carbonation.  D- If I could get this every day, I would drink it that often.

A: Absolutely beautiful hazy orangish copper color with a large white head that dissipates slowly. Very thin collar remains with exceptional lacing that decorates the glass with each sip.  S: Pungent aroma consisting of red grapefruit, grass, and hops. Surprisingly, to me, the hops are not dominant, but rather, in perfect balance with the citrusy and grassy aromas to make it a very ""deep,"" layered smell. There is also a hint of coniferous foliage, but you have to work to find it hidden behind the dominant aromas. Very, very nice.  T: Corresponds well with the smell, with fresh grapefruit and hops tamely biting at the tongue. Lively resin and spice blend in on the finish for a wonderful, long-lasting aftertaste that is quite memorable.  M: Very well carbonated, with tiny effervescent bubbles that make this exceptionally smooth yet full and coating. Not overly dry nor bitter, which makes this stand out quite a bit from others in its class.  D: Overall, this is very, very drinkable, but certainly one to savor, especially if it's not readily available. I'm very glad I was finally able to give this a shot, and will seek it out again. Really a remarkable beer.  That being said, I was a little let down by all the hype. There is another DIPA, which will remain unnamed, that is almost identical in every aspect, and shines a bit more to me than this.

T - Very much tastes of hops. You get a pine/citrus taste at first and then the bitterness of the hops afterwards. That is the only thing that turned me off from this beer was i wanted the pine taste to finish with my drink instead of a strong bitter hop taste.  M - Very smooth again as you start your drink. I never wanted to swallow this beer it just had so many cool flavors in it, but alas the flavor ends as you swallow and all you can taste is hops.

863,7971,WVbeergeek,5,"Appears a pale copper slightly hazed body with a nice sized off white orange tinted head. This stuff appears to be super fresh bottled on 10/08/10, poured from a 500 ml bottle that gives a message about not aging this beer, duh. Head retention is great lacing is chunky and left behind in uneven patterns on my imperial pint glass. I was digging the history lesson about Pliny on the label, nice touch all hail the man who dubbed the hop plant.  The nose of the beer is like hop perfume, I didn't even raise the glass to my nose and I was smelling was pure grapefruit/citrus peels, floral, and pine accented hop bursts. The pale malt base is subtle and is just there to support the blasts of hops coming at me, probably the best smelling beer ever.  I served this one up slightly chilled, well let's see Fed Ex dropped it off about 20 minutes ago and it was already chilled from mother winter. I did put it in the freezer for about ten minutes just to make sure I was starting cold enough. Flavor is barrage of hop flavor and bitterness but it's got finesse to it, it blends the sweet and bitter brash flavors perfectly. A spicy floral, super citrus peel, brash pine and earthiness come through in the hops with just enough pale malt sweetness to make the hops pleasurable still.  The feel is of course a bit resinous with hop oils, but body is a full medium that simply glides across my palate and down the gullet without much effort this glass is disappearing. Carbonation is appropriate very natural and smooth nothing tickles the back of the throat, no harshness this is all love. I do have back up bottle for myself and a bottle each for my brother, Dante and brother from another mother, Kolby. Those will be shipped out today to beer it forward, South Bay Drugs has this stuff right now call Joey if your craving some West Coast IPA/DIPAs, they will deliver.  Overall drinkability and experience stands on it's own, outside of the hype of trying one of the best beers in the country. This one really stands up to all of the hype and allure behind it. I paid four dollars a bottle plus shipping costs, and that was well worth this experience. By far my favorite DIPA, but other versions of the style are more accessible for me and fulfill the hophead cravings. This is a must and it definitely makes me want to do a Santa Rosa pilgrimage in the future.",Russian River Brewing Company,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,100

It poured a rich, a small bit hazy, slightly effervescent golden-orange. Rich big-bubbly head, that stuck around for awhile.  Smell was very pleasant. Given the hype, and my own pining to try this beer for a while now, I was somewhat nervous in my anticipation for that first whiff. Very nice sweet floral aroma; citrus, pine. I can imagine having this within days of bottling must be a real treat.  The taste is extremely well balanced. The bitterness/hops are definitely there, but the pine+sweet maltiness+citrus zest really melded into what I think is a quintessential DIPA flavor.  Mouthfeel was superb.

863,7971,nhindian,4.75,"500ml bottle poured into an oversized snifter. Huge thanks to russwbeck for this bottle, Russ is good people. Bottled on 09/21/2010  A - Upon pouring the first half of the bottle, it looks like your typical IPA. Pale, straw, light amber and crystal clear. Builds about a one-and-half-fingered head that dissipates fairly quickly. However, leaves some fantastic lacing that gives even the top-notch Belgians a run for their money. What is left of the head floats around in little clumps of islands on top of the beer, just masking the ocean of goodness that lies beneath.  S - Even right after the opening of the bottle I got strong whiffs of piney, citrusy goodness. Nose is almost entirely hop and pines, but can definitely get some notes of grapefruit, orange and lemon goodness. Smells bitter, but incredibly enticing. Refreshing and crisp.  T - Interestingly, you get a lot of bitterness within the first couple seconds, which is then counteracted with a smooth wave of malts and citrus. Not much alcohol taste at all in this one. The huge benefit of having a hop-forward bitter rush at first is that it leaves the palate ready to drink me and doesn't overwhelm. I'm more than 3/4s done and each taste is as good as the first and is begging me to drink me. Certainly a fantastically made beer.  M - Mouthfeel is light-bodied and carbonated just enough to entice the tastebuds and tingle the mouth. Feels great in the mouth.  D- Drinkability is astonishingly high for such a high alcohol DIPA. Really benefits from the smooth finish and is addictingly flavorful. The big bottle benefits greatly in this regard.

863,7971,ElGordo,4.57,"Poured from the 20oz bottle into a Maudite tulip glass. Body is a slightly cloudy golden-orange color, topped by a swirling, creamy white head that gradually recedes to a thin coating, leaving some pretty lacing on the glass. Aroma of floral, grassy hops, with notes of grapefruit and pineapple, accented by just a touch of cereal-grain sweetness. Palate is assertive hops that last from the tip of the tongue until long after the swallow. Notes of grass and citrus blend with just enough sweetness from the pale malt (with a touch of caramel) to ensure that it's not just pure hop juice. Finish is still more hops, with a lingering bitterness on the finish. Body is full but not super sticky, and definitely lighter than I would expect from an 8% beer. Carbonation keeps the body somewhat creamy, too. Not much heat from the booze, either. Overall, an incredibly drinkable beer that packs a huge punch of hops. Very, very nice.",Russian River Brewing Company,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,100
863,7971,FosterJM,4.03,"13th review on BA Bottle poured into a snifter. Bottle date of 9/23/10 (purchased today and drank today 10/22/10)  App-Hazy sunset orange, very thin head that quickly left. Great lattice as slides down the glass though.  Smell- Smells the way a DIPA should. Bold, full, hoppy. Makes you wanna swim in the glass.  Taste- Hoppy, bitter but balanced. It was a quite different but beautiful taste. Had that bite of an IPA just kicked up a little.  Mouth- For me a little thin, but bordered on a medium feel with a little carbonation.  Drink- Great beer to me but not an A+. Would be good to try on draft to compare the two.",Russian River Brewing Company,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,100
863,7971,Manoftyr,5,"Appearance-Pours into glass a shimmering, golden-yellow with about two fingers of long lasting, persistent and lacy head. As I hold it up to the light the orange-ish highlights shine outward and and seemingly bathe this beer in shimmering gold. The lacing on this beast is so sticky it's downright nuts, it just won't drip down the rim, and the head refuses to go away; if this ain't a 5 I don't know what is.  Aroma-Hops, just, sticky, resiny, flavorful hops. There's that big citric grapefruit kick upfront followed by a truck load of citric goodness and pine-like overtones all meshing together perfectly, it's so pungent, but yet at the same time not overbearing, that I can practically taste it as I smell it.  Taste-...my mind has been blown. This is at once so intensely hoppy yet so perfectly balanced in flavors that you hardly even notice the thing is bitter at all! I get grapefruit, lemon, lime, orange rinds, pinetrees and just a 'hint' of crystal malt balancing things towards the middle as a pine-like aftertaste rides the back end all the way to the finish.  Mouthfeel-Fluffy, resiny, slick but still light as a feather in the mouth; boggling really.  Drinkability-The bottle is almost gone and the only reason it isn't gone yet is because I've been forcing myself to drink it slowly so I can sip it throughout this review, it's so, so, so drinkable.  Notes-I...did not expect to like this beer as much as I did, I mean, I expected to like it but not be on the verge of literally founding a cult in its name; all hail Pliny!, and much thanks to my friend who through some convoluted means managed to get a bottle of this and was generous enough to part with it.",Russian River Brewing Company,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,100
863,7971,321jeff,4.57,Pours a hazy golden color with about two fingers of fluffy white head.  Aroma is massive amounts of piney hops with hints of citrus in there as well.  Taste is much of the same with lots of pine bitterness but nothing too offensive. Just the right amount of malt sweetness to back it up.  Mouthfeel is also spot on with a medium body and plentiful carbonation. I could definitely see myself drinking this on a daily basis if it were easily available.,Russian River Brewing Company,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,100
863,7971,acurtis,4.1,"Naven hooked me up with a fresh 500ml bottle of Pliny. Bottled 9.23.2010 Poured into large red wine glass. Copper color with 1/2 finger white head that sticks to the glass. Head fell, left small and bubbly Super aroma dominated by flowery hops with some citrus. Amazing flavor balanced with hops and malt. Spectacular soft carbonation.

863,7971,Dreadnaught33,4.54,"A legendary beer, heres my two cents... notes from 10/16/10  A: Clear bubbly golden color with a small bubbly head, not much lacing. Looks to be lighter than a normal big hop beer.  S: Wow. Awesome citrus, pine and sweet hops that are pronounced exquisitely. Huge hop presence and also just enough sweet and malt to balance.  T: A great hop profile that was preluded exactly by the smell. Juicy, tight, biscuit malts that don't get in the way of the hops, amazing balance and pristine clean taste. Very earthy, grassy hops, only could use maybe a bit more of sweetness for me. I'm amazed by how the flavors all work with each other rather than detract from each other.  M: Lots of carbonation, light-medium feel, perhaps a little on the prickly side for me, but overall very nice and true to style.  D: What can I say that hasn't been said, excellent beer, also easy to go through quickly!",Russian River Brewing Company,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,100
863,7971,jlmarshall,4.35,"This beer is a clear gold with about a half inch foamy head and bubbles that just keep rising. The smell is very refreshing with apples and maybe pineapple. It makes me think of early summer fruit. The mouthfeel isn't quite what I expected. A bit salty at first. Quite bitter. The taste is overwhelming and takes a little bit to get used to. It's quite flowery and the hops are very noticeable. Not as clean and fruity as I was expecting from the smell. A very nice beer, but I don't think I would drink this regularly.",Russian River Brewing Company,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,100
863,7971,patobandito,4.9,"Found this on tap at a bar in Ft. Collins.  Pours Bright golden color. Beautiful to look at. Nice lacing as well. Smells most of hops of course, with a nice pine note. Taste is mostly hops, but well balanced with a pleasant malt flavor. Not as overwhelmingly hoppy as some DIPAs get, but still a bit too hoppy for the casual beer drinker. For us beer nerds however, this beer is pure hop nirvana.",Russian River Brewing Company,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,100
863,7971,Double06,4.73,"I actually never planned on reviewing and will probably not do a ton of them. However, I feel like this beer deserved my time to do a review. Bottle Date: 9/23/10; Review: 10/16/20  Graciously trekked back in a suitcase from a co-worker's trip to San Fran and poured into a Brooklyn tulip.  A: A bright hazy orange with 1/2 inch or so of fluffy white head. A small amount of lacing on the glass...  S: Doesn't have the big nose of some other IPA/DIPA and not a huge punch in the face like so many other IPA/DIPAs. Faint hints of pine and citrus equally balanced against each other. The best way to describe the smell is subtle and coy, because the nose does not do this beer justice.  T: Hands down the best DIPA I've had. Incredibly crisp and clean with the hops shining throughout but with enough malt and sweetness not to burn out your palate. The pine hits first, then a swath of citrus followed by a a flash of sweetness and a subtle pine finish.  M: Slightest bit of that resiney hoppy goodness that coats your mouth, but not to the extreme of most other DIPAs that do some work on your tastebuds and palate. Just enough carbonation to make your mouth happy and not overly drying.  D: Off the charts. I could and would drink this all day if I could. Not the slightest hint of the 8% ABV this one packs. I imagine after 2 or so, the alcohol would bite me in the ass, but I wouldn't care. This is so damn good.  Well deserving of its A+ rating and a beer I would seek out over and over if I could.",Russian River Brewing Company,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,100

I even compared this to a bottle that was only 1 week old and the tap version blows that out of the water. Pours a straw color with a tick, rocky head.  Citrus and grass in the nose. Like you're mowing a grapefruit tree and you put your face in the grass collection!  So amazingly bitter and fresh. Citrus juices, piney flavors, grassy notes. Just perfect. PERFECT!  I easily finished a growler's worth of this stuff over two days.

A- Poured a golden orange color into snifter with 2 fingers of milk like head, leaves a nice lace along the glass.  S- Smells strong of passion fruit and hops. Not as hoppy as i'd imagined, but a fair deal non the less.  T- Phenomenal. Crisp bite of hops, a little grapefruit citrus taste. Finishes nicely on the palate with lingering citrus/pine notes.  M- Smooth and refreshing, Crisp and bubbly. No unwanted after tastes.  D- High. If I lived in an area where it was more available, It would be a staple in my refrigerator. Very refreshing.

863,7971,DrewZ926,4.9,"500 ml bottle into pint glass (bottled 9/29/10)  A - Very nice amber pour, almost golden in the light. Very white head with great retention. Pristine, thick lacing, as the sips went down.  S - Robust piney hops, hints of citrus, mainly lemon. Grassy too. Very fresh all around.  T - The balance was nothing short of perfect. The sharp bite of the fresh hops was rounded out by the sweet malt background. Finished very smoothly after the spike of hop flavor to start. The body was fuller from start to finish than any other beer in its class.  M - Great carbonation. In the glass bubbles emanate plentifully but complement the taste nicely once imbibed. Mouthfeel is very smooth, not the same bitter aftertaste as other double IPAs.  D - Quite sessionable despite the 8%, the alcohol was extremely well hidden and left only a hint of warmth in the mouth, added to the nice finish.  Basically, I wanted to see what all the hype was about surrounding this beer. I had my expectations set high, but Pliny certainly met, if not exceeded them. The balance of malts, hops, sweetness, and bitterness is, as far as I have experienced, unmatched. Easily my favorite IPA.

S - Not a strong smelling beer at all, but definitely hints of piny hops, fresh citrus fruit and spice.  T - This is where you really start to realize why Pliny is one of the top-rated beers in the country. The taste is hoppy pine notes with definite grapefruit sweetness. The malt provides a smooth backdrop for the hops as well. Somehow manages the hop taste of an IPA without any of the overwhelming bitterness/aftertaste.  M - Definitely has a good amount of carbonation, but feels smooth and almost juicy in the mouth.  D - I could drink this one all day. The only thing that stopped me after two was the effect on my wallet. While the 8% abv is relatively high, you never taste it.

Bottle was approximately 1 month old. Not super fresh but certainly fresh enough for a tasting. I will revisit this review when I get hold of a fresher bottle.  Pours a slightly hazy golden color with faint orange hues to it as it catches the light. Small white head, leaves decent lace on the glass.  Smells wonderful. Maybe not the best-smelling IPA I've had (Oracle may still take the cake on that one) but this was still great. Nice balance between the bitter piney hops and the less harsh fragrant floral/citrus ones. I got some really sweet grapefruit, almost to the point of a semi-ripe orange. Pine is at the forefront of the profile on this one though. After smelling I immediately thought, ""this is special a beer.""  The taste also surprised me a little. I expected a straight-up west coast hop bomb and got something a little different. The hop profile is certainly the backbone of the beer, and certainly composed of mostly pine and more spicy esters, but there is still a faint sweet citrus undertone and some very mild maltiness to smooth it all out.  As far as mouthfeel goes, this is very well carbonated, but drinks super smooth and super easy. I was amazed at the balance of flavor and sensations in this beer. Hop forward and prickly, but not too biting or in-your-face as to put one off from going back for more.  Is this the best IPA in the world? Not so sure...

Nice lightly hazy golden color thru the smaller diameter part of the glass going to a darker reddish amber in the thicker diameter of the glass. 2 finger head that bubbles down in a few minutes.  Smells of Pine, hops, citrusy grapefruit and a nice mild buried sweetness of apple to my mind! 8% alcohol is well hidden.  the Pliney (pine) hop tastes hit your tongue first along with a nice bubbly zing and hops on the tip of your tongue. Citrus then comes thru, but the fruit sweetness is pretty well buried. As it warmed the pine hops stood out more in smell and taste. Nothing overboard I preferred this.  Medium Light in the mouth. Good zip in the carbonation. Finished dry on the tongue with some bitter hop finish and alcohol warmth in the back of the throat...more alcohol warmth as it warms.  I love hops and this one was well worth trying. Great balance of pine, hops, citrus, touch of sweetness and malts to keep it all balanced nicely.

I'm a hop head at heart though I rarely trade for IPAs as who really knows when a beerwas bottled unless it says on the bottle. This one, bottled 9/24/10  A - Golden straw and transparent. A flmy white head with bubbles that stick around with every swil of the glass.  S - Grass and pine thru and thru. This is really the standout to me.  T - The grass is heavy up front and right tru til the end. I get a touch of pine in the back. This is very dry but extremely balanced. The malt backbone is present but at 8% man this is well put together.  M - Great light carb, sticky hops and dry  D - Cannot taste the 8% here at all.

Nose is very bright, loads of hops express white grapefruit rind, dank pine forest, and almost a candy-like quality. Balance of flavors is straight up deft here, walks a brilliant line between bright, bitter citrus and a chewy candy sweetness. Luscious and juicy in the mouth.

Pours a semi clear heavy duty amber to orange color with a solid wispy white head on top which leaves some nice lacing on the side of the glass. Nice looking.  Smell. Oh GOD what a nose this beer has. Huge, massive citrusy and piney hop nose hits you like a ripe hop vine falling on your face. Nose seems more citrus forward, with orange and grapefruit the main players, and a hint of lemon in the background. Pine resin is also there, giving complexity to the nose. malt sweetness creates a nice backbone for the hops to live on.  Taste is an explosion of hops again. Pine plays more of a role in the taste than it did the nose. This beer manages to pack a ton of hop flavor, yet keeps the balance between hop and caramel malt within view.  The beer is light on the tongue, allowing for the flavors to fully penetrate your tastebuds. Carbonation really releases the flavor.  This beer is so freaking drinkable. The flavor explodes in your mouth, and is so forward that each sip is a treat. Yet, the beer is light enough to never impede in your fun.

T - Foresty pine and spruce, citrus fruits of grapefruit, orange, tangerine. Very slightly sugar malts in the back.  M - Medium body. Initial juicy, oily resiny hops.

863,7971,luisfrancisco,4.67,"So I finally had a Pliny. I guess my conclusion is that it does live up to the hype. The beer pours a light yellow and is somewhat clearer than I expected. It may only look gorgeous because I knew what I was about to drink. I guess the look is just all right, but nothing extraordinary. I have to say I expected it to be a little cloudier, so it does have a nice clean look. There was a one inch very decent head. The smell is just fantastic. Best smelling IPA ever. Just pure piney hops. Taste is also exceptional. Hops up front, little and subtle malt background. Some citrusy flavors, bitter and bone dry. Also, you couldn't tell it was an 8%ABV beer. Alcohol is well hidden in this one.  I shared a fresh Pliny with a couple of friends and we just loved it. But what really puts this beer apart from any other IPA I've tried is its fantastic smell. Very nice.

863,7971,Bobthenailer,4.95,"I felt I needed to drink this beer a few more times before attempting to review it. At first I thought that the explosive taste and bold flavor might have been a fluke. I've had beers before that were inconsistent from bottling dates, so I've tried 3 different ""vintages"", all consumed within 30 days of bottling. So far, and this appears to hold true in speaking with other aficionados of this beer, the quality is remarkably consistent. What is really vexing about this beer is that it is produced in small batches and can be quite hard to get. One of my local stores has a ""waiting list"" on which I'm number 31. It comes in once a month, the beer manager starts to call the names on the list, and it is all gone within a couple of hours from the time it arrives. It is also limited to two bottles per customer. That being said, it's now time to talk about the beer itself... The beer comes in 500mL brown bottles with a simple green label with red symbol and white writing, nothing fancy. It does have several admonitions to drink fresh, not to age or ""save for a rainy day"". It is best served cool, not super cold, as the flavors and aroma come alive at about 50 degrees. Poured into a large tulip glass, the head upon first pour measures about 1.5 inches, then settles to about half with time. The aromas of citrus and hops aren't overpowering, just right. The color is golden with a touch of copper in it, very pleasant to the eye. Then there is the flavor... Like I said before, it's bold, explosive and utterly memorable. Definitely not for the faint hearted, this beer has complex flavors that play on your mouth without the nasty bitter aftertaste some of the hoppier IPAs can leave on your mouth. I am not a technical beer drinker, I don't analyze the contents, the ABV, the density or the bitterness units. I leave all that to the experts. What I am is an avid fan of this amazing, fantastic beer, and though it lessens my chances of getting it regularly, I tend to extoll its virtues every chance I get. So, in short, (although it might be too late for that) if you run across this beer by choice or chance, get it, enjoy it and count yourself lucky.

Feel was pretty much medium bodied, slightly crisp, and clean.  Easy drinking.  EDIT: Drinking Pliny first, instead of during a tasting definitely helped me take notice and appreciate it more.  Aroma was more noticeably floral. Taste was more noticeably lingering, with a combined intense bitterness and malt sweetness dancing on my tongue long after the sip.

Also, I'm just a noob of a beer drinker but I'm just lovin craft brews.  8.5% alcohol I believe, and a double IPA. Golden-straw like in its color, slight head but barely there.  I love double IPAs, I hate IPAs since I dislike overly hopped beers but double IPAs use the hops to smooth out the strong alcohol content and this the is perfect example of a double IPA.  You'd think this would be a heavy, syrupy beer but it isn't at all, surprisingly light and drinkable with a slight carbonation. just fabulous.  The taste is amazing, nice presence of hops, citrusy and pine tastes, tomato vines too. The more interesting flavors is that there is prominent lychee taste to it, a very interesting tropical tone. Usually for beers with this alcohol content the alcohol itself would overwhelm or be detectable but it's hidden quite well here with gorgeous tasting hops.  This beer really is quite exceptional and really is one of the top beers out there. It is so incredibly refreshing and drinkable, i just really love it and would totally rank it as one of the best beers I've ever had so far. truly phenomenal.",Russian River Brewing Company,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,100

Appearance: Pours a slightly hazy golden-orange color with a large, very thick white head that has a slight orange hue. Head dissipates very, very slowly and leaves behind many spots of lace.  Smell: All kinds of hop aromas- pine and earthy aromas are the most prevalent, with some passionfruit and tropical aromas, and even mild floral hints. Every imaginable West Coast hop aroma seems to be represented, and represented well.  Taste: Begins bitter with some sourness and a piney flavor. Finishes with herbal and citric hop flavors and just enough buttery malt flavor to keep this from being overpowering. This is extremely hoppy, but it is not an all-out hop blitz. Wonderful.  Mouthfeel; Lighter body than expected, still in the medium range though. Balanced, natural carbonation and a finish that begins sticky and finishes dry.  Drinkability: I now know where all of the hype comes from. This is quite possibly the perfect beer. Definitely not for the uninitiated, but this is beer nirvana. A wonderful brew that I must savor, as I cannot readily get this on the East Coast. Time to end this review, to go back and savor.

Pine, pineapple, bread, lots of hops. Mouth feel is difficult to describe, smooth, almost oily. Taste if malt, fruit, then hops hops and more hops.

On separate nights, I tried three 500ml bottles, two poured into a Maudite tulip the third poured into a oversize snifter.  Each poured a dull amber, almost orange color. It looks a lot like freshly brewed ice tea. It averaged two fingers of foamy white head which stuck to the glass for several sips. The nose is full of hops with a little bit of a pear aroma lingering. It is very smooth, almost like the carbonation is completely missing for a brief period before striking toward the end. It tastes of citrus and tons of bitter hops which stay on the palate for a long long time.

The hops are strong and present, but not overpowering. Strong notes of both grapefruit and pine.  RR has done an excellent job of making an imperial IPA drink as smooth as a regular IPA.

863,7971,beerdrifter,4.42,"Thanks to Eric and Doug for hooking me up with this as part of our trade. This is my last one so I figured I better review it before they're all gone. Cloudy orange-copper pour with decent head and great lacing. Lots of citrus in the big west coast nose. Huge tangerine and grapefruit aroma with a hint of pine and orange zest. A nice tangy hop bitterness is present and builds throughout, but is nicely offset by the sweet malts, making this a very well balanced beer. Nice crisp, dry finish, and the alcohol is almost non-existent for such a big beer. This is one of those scary drinkable beers and gets better as it warms. It reminds me a lot of Alesmith IPA, one of my favorite beers. I'd love to try this on tap. This beer lived up to the hype and I'm glad I had the opportunity to try it. Thanks again Eric and Doug!  Re-reviewing this one that I picked up in a trade, bottled on 28 May 14. Clear yellow-orange pour with a gorgeous two finger meringue-like white head with great retention and lacing.

Big West Coast citrus notes along with pungent hops, pine, sweet caramel, tangerine, grapefruit, and orange peel.

863,7971,eclaycamp,4.9,"Pliny the Elder. The word legendary comes to mind. Russian River's famously hopped IPA has been out of reach for me, at least until now. A recent excursion to Denver for the GABF yielded a surprisingly bountiful harvest, including a fresh bottle of the Elder. To say I'm excited about finally getting the opportunity to sample this beer would be an understatement. In many respects, I feel like I've been waiting my whole life to try this brew.  Let's get out snifter for this one, it seems appropriate. Pliny pours a dull gold, with a very nice head that immediately billow up before recedeing, like the tides on the beach. Shockingly (or not) the nose is pretty much all hops. Hops hops hops hops hops. I get some spruce notes up front. It's this big ass pine nose that is incredible. It tears at my nostrils like a demon from hell, determined to drag me down.  Holy cow, this beer is incredible, just based on scent alone.  The first sip is an assault on the palate. You aren't prepared for this. But it's not bad. There's bitterness, but it is pleasant. Luckily this bottle of Pliny is super-fresh, so I get that scratchy hop characteristic of a beer that was seemingly made yesterday. The mouthfeel is great. It's super thick, with this great malt sweetness backing it up. But it's never syrupy. The light carbonation lends to the overall experience and actually makes it quite easy to drink. The Elder strikes quite a nice balance.  It's all about the hops though, and this beer is a hop chameleon. It seemingly changes with every sip that I take. I get spruce pine, followed by grass, then citrus, and then flowers. And, just for good measure, It's generic, I know, but it's what I get. This thing is a hop grenade in your mouth. There's a number of hops just sucking you in and then trying to claw their way out of your mouth. The only way to really appreciate it is by trying it yourself. What's incredible is that the malt profile backs it up.  Wow.  It's like someone beamed down from another planet with the perfect IPA, and Russian River was bestowed with the recipe. All others pale in comparison. Holy crap this thing is f'n incredible. I didn't think I would say this but it's totally worth the hype. I'm going to be having dreams about this thing.  Yes, it's that good.  The hop character draws you in. I haven't had a beer with this kind of amazing hop flavor. It's so fresh and delicious. Ridiculous. But there's a great malty sweetness that backs everything up. Trying to describe the malt profile is like hitting a moving target - the more you zero in on the sweetness the more the hops come back up and remind you that they're there. Man. There's simply nothing wrong with this beer. And honestly, there's only one way to think of this.  This is the best IPA that I've ever had.",Russian River Brewing Company,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,100
863,7971,ToasterChef,4.87,"Reviewed from my tasting notes of a decent sized sample I consumed at an epic tasting event held with the members of the SMBDC. This bottle was opened on August 28th and had been bottled on August 15th.  The liquid is clear and golden. The head is soapy and white. Not much rising carbonation is visible within the glass. It has a robust hop nose. The smells aren't too strong--in fact, it's near perfect. There is a great hop build-up in the flavor. It starts out sweet, but the hops build to a great crescendo as I swallow. Most impressive! Medium bodied. The carbonation level can be felt. It is exceptionally drinkable. It just slides down my throat. I don't mind this level of hops at all.  As one of my friends commented when we opened another bottle from this batch at a tasting a few days later: ""the beers we've had are good, but when you taste Pliny you can tell you are drinking a special beer.""

T- Very clean, not overly bitter, more balanced. Bitterness also does not linger on palate excessively.  M- Light and bubbly, not overly carbonated though.  D- For a beer with an 8% ABV, drinks exceptionally smooth. My friend who brought me back the bottle said that this beer is offered by the pitcher at the Falling Rock.

Hoppy and sweet in the nose, the smell is powerful and inviting. the taste leans slight more toward malty with a hint of grapefruit. The taste is incredibly balanced. While the hop presence is strong, it's not as bitter as many hoppy beers are and just goes down smoothly. I love this beer. First time I had it I felt a little underwhelmed from the hype, but the more I drink it and compare it to other DIPAs, I realize it's beauty as the balance is what really makes this beer excellent.

863,7971,msmezher,4.92,"***Update*** I'm editing this because my friend was recently lucky enough to get his hands on a bottle of The Elder, and kind enough to share it with me. Perfectly fresh, and nearly as good as it was on tap, the taste was a little less floral and was more dominated by the herbal hoppy flavors also strong in the draft I had. The Elder in a bottle is an A+, on tap gets extra credit.  I had Pliny the Elder on tap at Beachwood BBQ the other night. I'll start out by saying this is the best Imperial IPA I've ever had. The Elder is as perfectly balanced as a beer can be, which allows you to taste the hops, malts, and the exceptional herbal and floral notes present.  A: My pint glass was practically glowing. A slight foamy white head over a hazy golden orange body.  S: Hoppy, herbal, and floral. I miss the smell almost as much as the taste.  T: What I like in this IIPA is the strong herbal hoppy taste, but without an overpowering bitterness.  M: A little bite (which I like) but otherwise medium to full bodied, even the entire way through.  D: I wish I were still drinking it.  Conclusion: Pliny the Elder is incredible either as a standalone or paired with food, definitely the best IIPA I've ever had.

863,7971,silentjay,4.53,"here it is. the holy grail. bottled two weeks ago.  pours a slightly hazy, yet glowing copper with a large-bubbled perfectly white head, that recedes to a thick film and laces extremely.  aroma is slightly piny with a lot of sweet and bitter citrus. a lot sweeter than I expected, which is unfortunate. a slight let-down, but I'm still drooling in anticipation.  lots of citrus follows into the flavor. grapefruit (sweetened with a sprinkle of sugar) comes to mind. a touch of pine and grass, but its just juicy citrus with a tiny bit of alcohol burn (screwdriver or greyhound cocktails). a slight astringency is there, but it is completely overpowered by juicy hops. delicious? yes. I like it. I am not quite completely wowed, however. I don't think anything would have reached the expectations I had, however, flavor-wise.  medium bodied with a ton of resin, but a crisp dry finish and a slight citrus acidity that sticks around a bit.  though I wasn't quite wowed on the initial sip like i thought i would be, i quickly make my way through the bottle and am thirsting for another.

A. Great looking in the glass. A hazy but glowing orange with an inch and a half of bright white bubbly head. Lacing is pretty good but not the best I've seen.  S. Intense white grapefruit and super ripe orange immediately roll out of the glass. Some piney and biscuity malts are present but this is pretty much the quintessential citrus bomb. A little tropic fruit, mostly pineapple.  T. First off, I'll start by saying the bitterness level for this beer is perfect for an DIPA, not many can get it totally right but Russian River does. Bitter juicy grapefruit with lots of tangerine and some moderate pine notes. Also has this slightly bittersweet white grape note that I don't pick up as much in the nose. The tropical/pineapple element is there but its not super intense. Has a nice clean balancing bready malt taste that really completes it. Undoubtably one of my favorites.  M&D. Nice medium mouthfeel withn ample carbonation, in general I find it to be slightly better on tap than in the bottle.

863,7971,BeerAdvocate,4.87,"Review from BeerAdvocate magazine Vol. III Issue I:  One of the best labels in the world and a great wake-up call for overzealous über beer geeks who feel the need to age any and all beers.

""Respect hops, consume fresh!""  Light honey amber in color, topped with a big, fluffy, creamy white head with a ton of glass stickage. Massive ripe pineapple aroma in the nose, with pine, mint, sappy resins, powdery pale malts and a hint of alcohol. Silky smooth, medium bodied, with a very firm consistency and slightly chewy back. Hop presence is artfully chaotic. Nice prickly stab on the palate up front, semisharp bitterness, grassy, zesty grapefruit, deep smacking of ripe pineapple and pine. Juicy fruitiness, notes of apple and pear too. Dry middle with suggestions of chalky aspirin. Bready malts, soft and sweet, provide a nice backboard for the hops. Oily and ashy hop resins stick to the palate and follow through into a dry, bitter linger. Alcohol becomes sentient as the beer warms, speaking to us in tongues.

A: Beautiful hazy golden amber color with a quarter of an inch head and very slight lacing.  S: Very prominent pine nose with a little floral hops and a touch of honey peaking through. Its tough to pick out any other characteristics other than the dominant piney hops.  T: The taste is very similar to the nose. Extremely piney with some floral hops that dominate the palate but not excessively like you would expect from an imperial ipa. There is some hint of malts that balances this beer without taking away from the hops.  M. The mouthfeel of this beer is spot on. Not too thin but not too heavy like some IIPA'S. Light carbonation with a clean dry finish.  D: The alcohol is very well hidden. You can tell its there, but it is not noticeable at all. I could see myself drinking a few of these with no problem.  I have looked forward to trying this beer for a long time and I have to say I was very impressed but I was not completely blown away. That might be because of the epic hype surrounding this beer or that I did not get to drink it as fresh as many people recommend. I am not a huge fan of piney hops and I generally prefer a little more malt backbone to balance out the hops but it did start to grow on me after a few drinks of it.

S: Freshly picked pine needles, sap, citrusy hops, sweet floral notes fused with a rich malt profile in the back end.  T: Hoppy bitter bite, though extremely balanced by the added malt, floral hop notes finishing with a squeeze of pink grapefruit on the end of the palate.  M: Smooth and creamy, balanced carbonation.

863,7971,soze47,4.5,"I've now had PtE several times while out in CA visiting relatives. Each time, it has been in the standard pint bottles, but I did find it on tap once at Beachwood too. This is a review of the bottled version, although I should note the hops popped much more on tap.  Appearance: Nice honey orange color with really impressive lacing. It kind of looks like a good DIPA should.  Aroma: This is a great smelling beer. Saying it is citrus is selling it short. It has notes of lime flesh, lemon zest, grapefruit, and hints of orange/Clementine. The malt is not too forward on the smell.  Taste: The malt comes out just enough to keep the hops from being too bitter. The same flavors come out from the smell, but hit at different times to create a tiered flavor progression. The bitterness comes first, which is a bit odd for a DIPA that I find usually start sweet and finish with a lingering rind taste. This one finishes with the fleshier flavors.  Mouthfeel/Drinkability: This is a medium bodied beer that drinks like a much lighter brew. The carbonation keeps it loose and light on the tongue, but it is heavy enough to cling a bit. It isn't very hot considering the ABV, but I get a bit of heat toward the end of the bottle.  Overall: This is a great beer. If you come across it, give it a try.

As it warmed the smells became slightly more apparent, but not overly so  T - very balanced between bitter hops and sweet malt.

It was with these expectations that I tried my first Pliny.  Poured from the bottle into a tulip. Pours a hazy orange/light amber with a fantastic looking fluffy white head that takes a while to dissipated and never goes below a nice ring around the glass. Leaves OK lacing behind, but nothing special in this area.  Smells delicious. I get pine, lemon, bright orange, and some tropical fruits. No sign of the 8% abv at all.  Taste is the best I've ever experienced. Huge flavors of pine, lemon, grapefruit, orange, mango, and passion fruit, but with a noticeable bready malt backbone that somehow manages to maintain balance in a brew with awesome hopw flavors. IMO, this beer is a testament to the fact that adding an absurd amount of hops and malts is not necessarily the key to a great beer; Pliny is very hoppy, yes, but what makes it so delicious is how the use of its malt flavors perfectly balance the flavors from the different hops used. Spectacular.  Bottled 19 days ago.",Russian River Brewing Company,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,100
863,7971,ballz50401,4.5,"Poured from a 16.9oz bottle (bottled on 8/25/10) into a Duvel tulip glass. Have to give a big thanks to my buddy Beek out in Santa Rosa for sending me this 3 week old bottle.  Appearance: Pours a bright golden copper/orange. A nice amount of carbonation bubbles produce tiny little beads of foam that leaves it's mark around the edges of my glass.  Smell: I think this is brewed with hops. A very nice array of floral/perfumy/herbal hops accompanied by a nice touch of light caramel malts.  Taste/Mouthfeel: So this is what a brewed wet dream tastes like. Tastes like a nice combination of citrusy hops that mingles around my tongue before some caramel and honey sweetness balance out the experience. Perfect balance. Mouthfeel is almost perfect. Meduim bodied with a slight creaminess that has a soft bitterness with a dry finish.  Drinkability: Overall, this is a great year-round DIPA that goes down very easy. I can see why this is so popular. There are also some very good local options like Abrasive Ale, HopSlam, and Illumination that will keep me plenty satisfied for my fix though. Would I like to drink more? Hell ya! Would really like to try this on tap at the brewery someday.",Russian River Brewing Company,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,100
863,7971,Gosox8787,4.97,"My unofficial 250th review. I waited a little bit before posting this review, it is copied directly from my notes. Pint bottle poured into a snifter glass. Bottle is dated 8/16/2010 (review written 9/9/10).  Appearance: Golden orange in color with a one finger white head. Pretty good retention.  Aroma: Fresh oranges from the grove with some pineapple and grapefruit also contributing heavily. Really fresh, aromatic, and balanced.  Taste: The hops really hit hard here. Orange zest, , grapefruit, and pine notes are all everywhere. The sweet citrus notes are dominant and leave very little bitterness for the amount of hop flavor here. The bitterness does build throughout but never is overpowering. Devastatingly hoppy while maintaining balance.  Mouthfeel: Almost unbelievably crisp, with a smooth, light mouthfeel and great crisp carbonation.  Drinkability: The ABV is not even noticable and this is as crisp and refreshing an IPA (of any strength) that I've ever had.  Overall, the hand down best IPA I've ever had. Great combination of hop flavors and crispness. So refreshing its dangerous. Absolutely my highest recommendation. The only hard thing about this review was deciding whether this was a perfect 5 or not. A truly sublime IPA.",Russian River Brewing Company,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,100
863,7971,aewinte1,4.72,"A- Pours nice golden orange with a little bit of haze. NIce 2 finger head from standard 45 degree pour. S- The smell of this beer is one of the best I have ever smelt. Combination of delicious citrus and resiny hops. T- Taste is extremely balanced for such a hop forward IPA. Nice citrus notes with lots of hops at first that are somewhat balanced out by a nice malt backbone M- Carbonation is great and makes this beer especially refreshing D- Drinkabillity is pretty good because the alcohol is well hidden, but the hops become rather overpowering after a few and you cannot taste anything else.",Russian River Brewing Company,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,100
863,7971,yeahnatenelson,4.53,"200th Review -- Thanks again to wavers1 for setting me up with this growler.  Appearance -- Pours a rich orange/amber with two fingers of stiff white head.  Smell -- Lots of citrus and resin, dry bready malt, muskmelon, and a dab of honey. Not too shabby, but as I got the first whiff of this I would've assumed it was any number of top notch IPA; good, but not distinctive.  Taste -- Up front is tons of bright citrus fruit and pine resin. Tempering the hop flavor and moderate resin bitterness is the faintest bit of honey malt and melon. Overall, the malt is dry, but with just enough sweetness to give depth to those hop aromatics. The finish is long and reisnous. Alcohol cannot be perceived.  Mouthfeel -- Medium in body with moderate prickly carbonation. Wish I could somehow go into further elaboration here, but it just felt 'right.'  Drinkability -- One would expect an IIPA with such a cult following to be intense to the nth degree, but what you have with Pliny The Elder is an incredible flavor profile that is perfectly balanced and incredibly easy to drink. I offered this growler up for my best friend's birthday party, but I could have just as easily drank this all by myself. If I lived in CA, this would be in my fridge at all times. A nearly flawless beer.",Russian River Brewing Company,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,100

Leaves copious amounts of lacing on the side of the glass. Aroma is floral, citrus, pineapple and resin.. There is a very citrus-y, sweet quality overall. Being a west coast dIPA, I expected lip smacking bitterness but there a a great deal of balance here that I find it very drinkable. Piney, and earthy hops on the back of my tongue. Decent amount of carbonation that I find just right for this type of beer. Very drinkable. I don't find that my tongue takes a lashing from the bitterness.  I really enjoy Pliny, as I've had it more than a few times before finally sitting down to review it. It's awesome with a big, greasy bacon cheeseburger!

863,7971,beerhan,4.24,"After so long I was finally able to try this mythical beast...  initial thoughts after finishing the giddiness of looking at the bottle:  What a pretty looking beer. Nice thin white lace head with a golden amber body to it.  Aroma of caramel and very floral hops and a hint of pine.  Tastes very piny and leaves a tingly feeling on my tongue. Sugary at first followed by a mild bitter aftertaste.  Very easy to finish, the alcohol is not too over powering overall a very nice beer.  Closing Comments: For being an IPA this is a real nice beer and I do respect it for advancing the style but IMHO there are other beers I would rather drink such as 2XIPA or hopslam. Personally I enjoy east coast IPA's (And Great lakes region) just more than west coast. Nonetheless I would drink a Pliny again in a heartbeat.",Russian River Brewing Company,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,100

S - Floral and piny hops and a touch of sweetness. Completely inviting.  T - Begins bitter and hoppy, eventually unleashing a total wave of oily hop fury. Explosive and unforgettable, with a touch of fruit and floral hops to prevent the beer from spinning out of control. Malt balance establishes equilibrium with some caramel, before a delicious wave of hops dry out the palate.  M/D - Ridiculously drinkable for the style, medium body, dry, alcohol is masked impeccably.  This beer lives up to the hype in nearly every way.

863,7971,Macky20,4.09,"Bottled 8/16/10. Poured from the bottle into a standard pint glass, leaving a one finger head, opening up wonderful aroma with citrus that involves grapefruit and orange. The aroma is an great pre-cursor.  I did not expect this beer to have this much body and bite! I love it though of course... Hops and Grapefruit are here in mass. leaving a definite tartness on the back of the tongue. A well constructed beer indeed....  Mouthfeel is great. Though the beer looks a bit on the thin side after pouring, it feels perfect in the mouth. Drinkability is good, but is negatively effected a bit by the bitterness left in the throat IMO.  Fantastic beer, just as I expected it to be. I am quite an explorer when it comes to hoppy beers though, and there are still quite a few IIPA's that sit above this one on my list of favorites.",Russian River Brewing Company,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,100

The hops deliver a blissful smack to the nose.  T - the bitterness of the hops is incomparable to any beer I've ever tasted. Huge floral and grapefruit flavors conquor the palate.  M/D - chewy yet creamy mouth that is unbelievably smooth considering the IBU.  Notes: I was dying to try this for a long time. While it's not my favorite ipa, it's probably the most impressive one.

863,7971,LiquidCucumber,4.42,"A - Slightly foggy light orange that is bordering on yellow. Finger and a half of foamy white head.  S - Citrusy hops; lemon, orange, grapefruit with a hit of some more tropical fruits like pineapple and mango, but not as much. Smells herbal and a bit medicinal as the hop resins come out.  T - Light fruit with a serious hit of intense hop flavor of pine, citrus and resin. I am not detecting much malt, but there is quite a bit of sweetness. The hops totally dominate the whole palate, tastes like I stuffed them in my mouth.  M - Prickly hops sting the whole mouth. Leaves a coating on the tongue that is reminiscent of cough syrup. Seems too light for a DIPA but that doesn't mean its body isn't full (of sticky, juicy hops!)  D - Goes down clean and smooth, the tingle from the obnoxious amount of hops makes it one step from being able to be funneled.

This rating comes from my notes and the first time I had the beer about three years ago. An incredibly good DIPA. On tap at Father's Office. Pours with a large, thick, off-white head covering a slightly cloudy orangy body. Lace ring per sip! Aroma is quite nice blend of toffee, some spice and lots of pine, citrus, and grapefruit. Taste is very piney, with some spicy hops and a nice sweetness backing it all up. Great aftertaste and the alcohol strength in the taste is quite nice as well.

T - Big bitter, hoppy, reisny pine and grapefruit taste hit you upfront. Nicely integrated malt backbone balances this beer so nicely.  M - This beer is creamy, smooth and perfectly carbonated.

Large foamy white head dissipates quickly but leaves a pretty nice lacing on the glass.  S - Sweet pineapple and pine hops, very resinous and a little skunky. A tad of sweet malt is notable.  T - Sweet citrus and piney bitter hops up front. Just a glimpse of sweet malt. Bitterness carries for a long time, not offensive, but not what I was expecting. I think this beer is lacking in terms of complexity to be considered a DIPA. Not enough of a malt balance for me. Tastes a lot like some other American IPAs i've had, but it is delicious nonetheless.  M - Low carbonation, crisp and clean bitterness, refreshing. Not as big as most DIPAs. Real good feel, but feels more like a regular American IPA to me... I guess that is probably a good thing.  D - Very drinkable for a DIPA, then again this is as light of a DIPA that I have tasted. Very good beer, I'd drink it on many occasions if I had access to it. Not gonna lie though, this one did not live up to expectations for me.

So I'm reviewing it from Tap. but I've had the pleasure of having it out of bottles that were filled the day before, so that was beyond fresh.  This beer was my first taste of russian river and I knew from then it was love at first beer.  This golden, hazy hayish, treat pours with a slight viscous that makes the mouth water. It left an off white head that had a medium thickness. The aromas vary I find an initial sting of lemon zest that fallows with a sweet ""fresh"" hop. It by no means over powers your nose with just one distinct smell. It's so balanced. Again the citrus and hops come out in the flavor without an enormous bitter. I find a hint of sweetness in this beer too. Drinkability?

Fresh smelling and a little earthy. Really nice malt smell that compliments the hops.  T- Bitter hops with grapefruit and pine. Starts out really bitter and hoppy, but then the malts sneak up and balance the taste. The hops remain on the back of my tongue. Very well balanced beer.  M- Feels good and fresh. Very nice body.

(big thanks to my wife for fetching the long awaited PtE from california.)  pours an amber/golden yellow with a touch of haze and maybe a finger and a half of creamy white head; moderate retention and lacing.  the nose, in a word, is wow. hands down the best smelling DIPA i've ever whiffed. big, bold piney hops followed by potent citrus - notably grapefruit, a bit of lemon zest - and a few floral notes round out the incredible aroma. IMO this is the archetype of how a DIPA should smell.  more of the same characteristics pull through in the taste. tons of pine, grapefruit, and some malts to balance it out. a bitter finish. delicious. not quite the mind-blowing flavor profile the hype (or the nose) led me to believe it might be - not sure anything could substantiate that amount of buildup (especially for an east coast guy) - but a complex and really flavorful beer. alcohol presence is practically nonexistent; they don't make 'em much better than this.  medium bodied, moderately carbed. pretty damn drinkable, too. one of the greats, i'll give it that; i gotta say, though, call me crazy but for my money dfh's 90 matches up pretty well.",Russian River Brewing Company,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,100

While not an expert by any stretch, this was one fine beer- I cannot say that it's one of the best in the world. Russian River is well worth the visit, if able. The food is very good and the price reasonable. There's always a bit of a wait and you'll have to deal with a few local beer snobs. The 20-tap sampler alone is worth the trip.

The flavors are great, piney crisp hops and mildly sweet malts. The hop flavors mellow out further into the glass revealing an interesting and very well balanced beer.  Very drinkable.

Bottled 7-14-10  A- A slightly hazy copper/orange liquid with a thin white head that has excellent retention and leaves some nice lacing.  S- Very fragrant marijuana, fruit, and pine. There is a bit of a caramel backing at the tail end. This really opens up as it warms.  T- Bitter hops combines nicely with a great candied fruit aspect. A bit soapy with some pine in there as well. Complex and wonderful.  M- Sweet but not rich. Smooth carbonation with a long lasting and numbing bitterness.  D- A bit of a sipper for the alcohol content, but the hops are monstrous so it makes sense.  I am shocked that I enjoy this more with with a bit of age on it, but apparently it allows it to open up a bit.  Bottled 5-26-10 (Reviewed 5-30-10, 4 days after bottling)  A (4.0)- A clear orange liquid with a creamy white head that has excellent retention. If there was any haze whatsoever to the liquid this would be a winner.  S (3.5)- Surprisingly faint. Some earthiness, caramel, a touch of citrus, and a bunch of pine. Not as in your face or as fruity as I expected.  T (4.0)- Earthy hops, caramel, citrus, and a boat load of pine. Sweet, but a little on the faint side. Enjoyable, but not cutting edge.  M (4.5)- A long lasting bitterness, but the carbonation is very nice. Exactly what I look for in the style.  D (4.0)- Tasty and enjoyable. The beer really takes some time to open up as it warms.

Fresh hops of all kinds, grapefruit, pineapple, pine, peaches, flowers, grass and a hint of earthiness. The malt takes a back seat and is more noticeable as the beer warms as a light and sweet bready character.  Flavor is big, but by no means overwhelming or astringent, it is surprisingly smooth for its strength. It begins with floral sweetness and light malts that move into pungent earthy tones and a bready background. Toward the finish the hop bitterness increases and covers the tongue while still allowing the sweet malts to come through. Lingering hop bitterness and flavors of fruit and earthiness make up the finish.  Mouthfeel is medium with medium/high carbonation and a nice coating-the-mouth feeling.

You also get a whiff something similar to walking down Haight Street around 2 in the afternoon on a sunny September weekend. With the first gulp, you get hops, a shitload of hops.

Considered by many to be the holy grail of IPA's, I've decided to re-review this beer since it's been a while since I've had it, and I've accustomed a bit more of a taste for hoppy beer since then :)  Serving type - Bottle into Snifter  A - Pours a lovely deep orange hue, with a thick, off-white head, leaving a pretty thick lacing around the glass.  S - Smell is of candied orange peels, grapefruit, lemon, pine, cascade hops, and just the slightest hint of caramel. An absolutely outstanding aroma from this beer! Truly among the best in it's category.  T - Light, toasty caramel malts and candied citrus fruits (orange and grapefruit) hit the tongue at first, quickly giving way to an assertive, piney hop profile, with lingering lemon notes. Leaves a very light, lingering bitterness for a moment afterwards. Has just enough malt for some balance, but make no mistake, this is a hop-heads paradise right here.  M - Medium bodied and mildy carbonated. Does not leave the sticky, malty feel that many DIPA's do, which makes this one a little easier to drink IMHO. Damn near perfect here.  D - Scarily drinkable for 8%. And I mean REALLY drinkable. It's like any other world-class beer, in that, you'll easily forget how much alcohol is in it because of how good it is!  Overall - Pliny certainly deserves the hype that it gets. While I'm still not sure if it's my #1 IPA, it is without a doubt one of the best.

Pours clear gold with an eggshell white head that is immense, has excellent retention, and leaves chunky clouds of lacing.  Aroma of lightly toasted malt, salt and white pepper, and very floral, perfumy green hops. Smells fresh and clean. Even the aroma in the glass a day after tasting remains strong and inviting.  Tastes first of mildy sweet biscuity malt, but that is quickly eclipsed by green hop bitterness with an end note of grapefruit rind. But overall, it tastes very fresh and clean. The hoppy finish is long and intense.  Body is light and the carbonation level gives it a very creamy mouthfeel. Numbs the tongue a bit and finishes dry, and that just makes me want to take another sip.  This is a very drinkable beer, and the alcohol is low enough to make this sessionable. It is just a joy to drink this beer.",Russian River Brewing Company,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,100
863,7971,mwa423,4.97,"A - Pours a perfectly clear golden color with a finger of white head that disappears but leaves a nice lacing.  S - A beautiful hoppy blend with citrus, pine, and light fruitiness. Basically the perfect level of hoppiness in a beer.  T - Taste is incredible, lots of hoppiness that rounds out the flavor with different types of hoppiness. There is tons of citrus hops some floral and pine hops as well.  M/D - Mouthfeel is perfect with the best amount of hoppy aftertaste. This is a beer I could drink exclusively until the end of time.

863,7971,Ryan011235,4.69,"Poured into a snifter on 1/26/10  Bottled on 1/6/10  Massive thanks to jamdugan for my first bottle of Pliny  Moderately dense orange/tangerine color; similar to pineapple juice, only darker. Held to the light it shines gold around the edges & has the range of color akin to a faded tobacco burst Les Paul without veering much toward brown hues. Poured two fingers of foam that protruded above the rim of the glass. After a few minutes this has mostly dissipated, leaving a thin layer of bubbles. Mild swirling helps retention. Decent patches of lace at the onset, though lace thins throughout.  Right after the pour it didn't smell too strong as the dense cap held back the aromas. I'm glad it thinned out because this smells amazing. This may well be the most potent hop aroma I've encountered. Bold citrus notes of grapefruit, tangerine, lemon zest & hints of orange. Notions of pine throughout, as well as floral overtones. There's a spicy component, too. I'm having a hard time appreciating much malt. Seems to be just a faint notion of sugar cookies.  The smell is so good I can almost taste it before I take the first sip & it tastes even better. Intense amounts of spicy bitterness. Leading the way is dense pine sap followed immediately by rapid bursts of citrus - mostly grapefruit with some lemon & ripe orange. Initially the floral qualities seem overpowered by the pine & citrus; however, warmth brings them more to the fore. Spiciness makes me think Amarillo hops. Malts be damned. Something has to be present, pale malts or some such, but they are timid here. Very faint solvency.  Leaning toward the heavier side of medium bodied. I can't tell if the carbonation is moderately low or if it's having a tough time moving the weight of the beer. If I have any critique it would be for more sizzle - a minor complaint for sure. Resinous without being gritty; very impressive. Piney bitterness lingers briefly on the finish. Nothing in the way of alcohol heat.  Excellent drinkability. It's gone all too soon; much like RCA Selectavision, pogs, Berry Berry Kix, Audioslave & my '88 Ford Taurus Wagon. Ah, to live within Russian River's distribution network. Y'all are lucky indeed.",Russian River Brewing Company,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,100
863,7971,thatsfine,4.65,Had this on tap a few weeks ago but just chose to enjoy it that day and not try to think about it. Reviewed from a bottle from notes 8-4.  Gold color with a two finger head and good lacing throughout the glass.  This has a lot of pine smell and quite a bit of citrus. But the smell also shows that this will have a nice malt backbone. Balanced smell.  Strong hoppy taste. The great thing about this beer is that there are tons of hops but they are well balanced. A lot of DIPA's are just too overpowering with hops. This is perfect.  Medium body and carbonation. Just what it should be.  The drinkability on this is unreal. I finished my first pint on tap in about five minutes. It is so good that you don't even realize how high the ABV is. I took much more time with the bottle serving though since that is the one I reviewed.,Russian River Brewing Company,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,100
863,7971,hughesm4,4.72,"Split a growler shipped to us in here in Ohio.  It has a light golden color with an epic amount of head and has a medium amount of haze.  This is one of the best smelling beers I have ever had. It a very hoppy smell that fills the nose, but isn't overpowering.  It didn't taste as I expected it to. The initial taste is nice and hoppy but nothing overpowering. The hops fade from the mouth and leave a slight malty sweetness. The beer is very drinkable and I would love another if I ever get the chance.  My wish has been granted, I am honeymooning on the Oregon Coast and on a random wine tasting I happened to find Elder on tap. It gets better; the place is called Basket Case Wines and is run by Chenin Carlton and her husband, who happen to be sister and brother in law to the head brewer at Russian River.  After the euphoria passed I ordered another hoping that the tap wouldn't blow before I got a glass. It didn't and the beer was just as good as I remember, if not better. The beer looked delicious and poured a nice thick head. The taste and smell were nice and hoppy but not overpowering with a mild sweetness.

Approximately 1 finger of head with nice lacing  Smell - Had a bit of a head cold at the time, so all I could smell was grapefruit and some floral notes  Taste - Fantastic, with almost no hint of alcohol. Lots of grapefruit, but still balanced.

Typical of the better examples of this style. I like slightly lighter-colored DIPAs (a little less malty).  S - Big piney, citrusey hop forward aroma with a little bit of pale malt character. Low esters.  F/M - Along the same lines as the aroma - piney, citrusey (oranges and grapefruits). Low bready malt character. Fermentation characteristics are kept in check, which makes this a well-balanced, extremely clean example of the this style. Medium bodies with moderate carbonation, aftertaste is clean and pleasantly hoppy.  D - Excellent. This beer finishes clean, with no astringency and plenty of carbonic bite.

863,7971,whahoppened,4.49,"As a deep-rooted east coast treestump, I tried and failed to be cool when I saw PTE (for only $5!) in the first San Francisco bar I visited on a recent California beer pilgrimage. When the publican reached for the tap handle and I realized that this legendary brew would actually be mine, I quivered like a tweenybopper stricken with Bieber Fever. I accepted a cool pint glass of honey-colored ale, yellower than the average IPA, a little hazy with a stiff inch of foam on top. A deep whiff: stonefruit, flowers, something faintly pungent that isn't quite spice. Very complex. Huge intensity from the first sip. More of the peachy fruit character, lavender, pine needles, a peep of acidity on the midpalate. Strong taste of alcohol on the finish tangles the flavor tapestry just a little, but what else do you expect from a mega-brew like this? Lovely texture--I had downed three by the time I returned to ""Earth"". The hype is real, the volume is eleven. Truly the ""Back in Black"" of beers.",Russian River Brewing Company,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,100

Takes me to a fresh farm with newly cut grass, newly sawed pine logs, ripe grapefruits...a fantastic bouquet...best I've ever smelled. I'd rather smell this beer than drink many others.  Taste...all that the smell promises. Not just a hop bomb...the hops are so full of flavor that I actually can't call this beer bitter...just flavor-packed. I paralleled this with a Racer 5 and it actually tasted less bitter (but WAY better.)  Mouthfeel is fine...not the hallmark of an IPA anyway.  Drinkability is just amazing. Down to the last sip (of my 10 oz, not 12 oz. glass due to California law) the flavor was perfect, even as the temperature was sure to have risen at least 5 degrees. (I savored this thing.)

A: Poured into a snifter, this beer is golden straw in color, with about an inch of creamy white head. Slightly hazy. The head dwindles down to a nice, thin cap that leaves fantastic lacing.. the best I've seen in a DIPA.  S: As soon as I opened the bottle I could smell the hops! From the snifter its yields a beautiful bouquet of piney hops and citrus. A slight touch of malt is in there, as well.  T: Wow, so much going on in the flavor. Immediately there is a punch of piney hops and grapefruit. The citrus and sweetness carry through to the finish, which is so beautifully balanced with the heavy presence of hops, tangy citrus, and just a touch of sweet malts. Hands down, the best DIPA or IPA I have ever tasted!  M: Great body and spot-on carbonation. Slightly creamy, velvety feel to it. I'm liking it.  D: Out of the park!

Smell is all immense sweat-sock hops, huge pine resin, and the malt to back it up. Very heavy, with the citrus aromas trying to catch up. Very good.  Taste is exactly what you'd expect, thick pine hops dominate, giving way to a malt that is rather heavy handed. The hops bleed into the finish, which is not a bitter as expected and thick with hop resin flavors. The aftertaste is all thick hops, with no real booze at all.  Mouthfeel is very thick and sticky, but the carbonation is low. The flavors stick on your palate forever.  Drinkability is decent, but the hops are very heavy.

Nice to finally get a glass of what everyone is talking about, though I wish I had the opportunity to have this more readily available to me. It deserves more than a couple tastings.  Appearance - Nice dark blonde color (with just a tiny bit of haze). A good one inch head which was bare retained through the pint  Smell - one sniff, and I think ""Oh, that's what they're talking about."" Pure citrus is the first impression, but also fresh pine sap, and a pronounced spice. Fairly heavenly  Taste - It's bitter (appropriately) and even slightly astringent. The hop aromas, especially the fruity ones, carry over to be represented in the taste. Herbal notes are there, and I taste some estery notes also (a nice touch)  Feel - It has some heft to it, but fairly velvety still. You can feel warmth (and it may even be a bit hot) from alcohol presence  Drinkability - For an Imperial IPA this is quite drinkable and I can easily imagine ordering too many.

863,7971,mklinger,4.88,"I had my first PtE thanks to a friend who just came back from a CA vacation and brought back a bottle for each of his homebrewing friends. It was bottled on 7-28-10, just 2 weeks old.  Poured into an imperial pint glass with a small 3 oz taster filled for my wife. Golden color. Others tlk about a slight haze, but mine was crystal clear. Super rocky, stiff head that was a good 1.5 to 2 inches that left ridiculous amounts of lacing. The prettest looking IPA I've seen.  Aroma was awesome, though not necessarily what I was expecting. As a homebrewer, I had seen Vinnie's recipe for PtE and thought it would just be so far beyond anything I've tasted before in terms of hopping. Well, it's certainly full of hop aroma but not that much beyond other IPAs. What it is a strong and balanced. Tons of pine and citrus/mostly grapefruit. Great bit of malt in there too.  Taste was simply the perfect IPA I've had. And I keep saying IPA rather than DIPA mostly because, for me, the biggest surprise about this beer was how IPA-like it is instead of DIPA-like. At 8%abv it really is close to the 7+% we see these days for standard IPAs. And this beer tastes like the most perfect standard IPA I can imagine. Very, very hoppy & bitter but very very balanced at the same time. Great stuff.  Easy to drink like a standard IPA, body was light, too. This is such a dangerously drinkable beer, that if I had access to it, it would be easy to drink pints & pints of it.

Recedes to a rocky solid cap with big gobs of lace stuck on the sides.  Sweet citrus aromas. Pink grapefruit, lemon zest and a hint of bubblegum.  An assault of hops on the mouth. There is a hint of malt sweetness off the start that balances out the hops a little, but a second or two later it's gone and the hops come to the forefront attacking your taste buds. Long lasting bitter hop finish.  Medium bodied oily mouthfeel. Moderate carbonation.  Drinkability would be higher if it was more balanced, but an American IIPA is going to be heavily hopped.

Fills your nose with fresh pine and fruit - strawberries, pineapple and grapefruit. A bit of damp haystack in there.  T: First thing I noticed was how slowly and smoothly the flavor builds up, then releases. Hop bitterness rolls through your mouth, leaving just a mild trace. Sweetness from the fruit on the nose provides a nice balance.  M: Great medium body, with just the right amount of carbonation - leaves a slight tingle on your taste buds.  D: For 8%? Absolutely.

Medium carbonation. oily  D:dry, hoppy, pine tar bomb, as expected. I could not stand another, not as easy to drink as some DIPA I had. But its not terrible.

Not as ""balanced"" as the East Coast IPA's/DIPA's, but far more enjoyable.  M - Great carbonation, not too syrupy, yet not too thin. Hop attacks the palate, but covers the 8% ABV!

Maybe something like a warm dinner roll, but it's hard to pick out.  T - Super bitter up front and then finishes with a slight sweetness. Pine and Floral hops are very apparent and hints of lemon and citrus fruits. A few more sips in open to nuts and those bready malt flavors which were so hard to detect in the smell.  M - Harsh on the pallet, but that's a good thing for something this bitter. Kind of dry, leaving you wanting another sip. No detection of it's 8% ABV.  D - This one would get a 5 for drink if I could get it on a regular basis, but it just doesn't come to this right coast. Bottle date is 071410, which is just under a month out.

Unlike other imperial IPA's the hops are very well balanced. Bitter citrus and pine, without tasting like you're licking pine tar or pine-sol. Light floral hops lingers for a little while.  Good carbonation releases additional hoppy aroma in your mouth, resulting in an explosion of IPA goodness as you swish it around.

This is a very hoppy beer, but sweetbread-like malts so perfectly balance the hop bite that a singular flavor forms. This combines with alcohol overtones, especially as the pint warms. Notes of lemon zest, mint and honey can also be detected (the honey also becomes more distinguishable as the beer warms). Because of the bitter-sweet balance, the aftertaste doesn't linger, finishing dry and leaving your palate clean and refreshed.  M: If the tight carbonation and large foamy head weren't enough of a clue, the tiniest sip will leave little doubt that this is one oily-rich IPA. The beer feels thick and rich and viscous on the tongue, but the light carbonation carries away any residue, leaving the finish perfectly clean.  D: As mentioned, the combination of bitter hops and sweet malts is perfectly balanced (I mean PERFECTLY) leaving the 8% alcohol an afterthought. Dangerously drinkable. As drinkable as any session beer you might have a sentimental attachment to, but too high in alcohol and hard to acquire to become a regular ""party beer"". The full flavors with little lingering aftertaste make this as drinkable as soda, and also make PtE great to experiment and couple with a wide range of food.  There's no question this ale lives up to the hype. I've been drinking PtE for some time and it's evolved into its own, trademarked ""Pliny Flavor"" on my palate, so I really had to sit down and notice the nuances, which are many. One of the most striking things about this brew is, as mentioned, the perfect harmony of bitter and sweet. Truly one of the most balanced ales in existence, and a brew that beer geeks and novices alike will find delicious, even on the first sip. One of the best beers on the planet and the standard-bearer for DIPA.",Russian River Brewing Company,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,100
863,7971,chiefgtx,4.92,My New Years resolution for 2010 was to drink as many different beers as I could possibly find. So Far so good. I have had 597 different beers from January 1st at noon until today July 30th and Pliny The Elder is by far my favorite. A friend in California has managed to get me not 1 but 2 of these to Massachusetts (thanks Sue!) and I can honestly say that this beer makes me want to move to California. The Aroma will hit your nose from two feet away as soon as you pop the cap. Grapefruity and inviting. If you have ever eaten something so delicious that you find yourself craving it weeks later...well....you know where I'm going. I have read reviews knocking this hoppy delight and reviews praising it. My opinion after almost 600 different beers in 7 months is...get one ...drink one....it really is an outstanding beer. There's Filet Mignon...There's Dom Perignon...and looking down on both of them is Pliny The Elder.,Russian River Brewing Company,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,100
863,7971,glazeman,4.15,"Poured from a 500 ml bottle into a snifter. Bottled on 7/5/2010, split with airohead2001. I had this one time on tap in Portland, Oregon, but this review is strictly from the bottle  A: Golden straw color, in general I like my DIPAs a little more amber or orange than this. Nice one finger white head. Moderate retention, Excellent lacing  S; Intense smelling beer, but not all that complex as I get mostly pine, with a little bit of floral notes in there.  T: Lots of pine throughout. Nice balance though, as it is not overly bitter until the after taste, then you get a hit of the hop bitterness. Other than pine, there is a tiny bit of grapefruit. In fact, to be honest, I didn't get much citrus, but there's some malty sweetness at the beginning that mellows this out a bit up front. I would characterize the malt profile as light syrup. The hops though, are really the star here and are quite good.  M: Very nice mouth feel. A little more than average carbonation for a DIPA but it works well here as it gives the beer some crispness in the otherwise medium body.  D: Excellent. This would be a great beer to have with dinner and goes down smooth and easy. Not a top 10 beer in my opinion, but very good, and a must try.",Russian River Brewing Company,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,100
863,7971,airohead2001,4.1,"The DIPA of DIPAs - one I've had several times before, but have never taken the time to review. This one is fresh - bottled 07/05/10 - courtesy of glazeman.  A - Slightly hazy, yellow, orange with a one finger head that soon fades to a few bubbles that line the rim of my pseudo-snifter. Excellent lacing that coats the walls of the glass. This is a bit lighter looking than many DIPAs, but overall, this is a nice looking beer.  S - The nose on this one is sort of disappointing. Smells great, but is very non-descriptive to me. I get a little bit of mango and grapefruit, but that's about it. Some citrus and piney hops - but not intense enough for me to be part of the ""explosive floral and mango hops"" team.  T - This is where Pliney shines. It's easy to be let down by a beer that has so much hype, but honestly, I am not let down at all. This beer just about has it all - a blend of citrus and piney hops through out with a harsh, cutting bitter finish, right before we get a taste of the oranges again at the very end.  M - Again, Pliney excels in mouthfeel. Less carbonated than many DIPAs - as the brew first enters your mouth, it is flat as can be, but manages a copious amount of bubbles that bring out the fresh, juicy, hops right before it heads for your belly.  D - Very drinkable. I split this with glazeman, but easily could have downed a bottle or two on my own. Smooth, crisp, and no EtOH burn.

S- strong, beautiful citrus and tropical hops. I think I'm actually getting some mango out of it too...absolutely amazing.  T- fantastic tropical fruit hops with a nice finish of that piney bitterness. I'm also getting some pepper and maybe a little spice in here...the balance is amazing.

863,7971,pmlondrigan,4.67,"Big big respect to Spdkilz (Carleton) for being such a great BA!! Pliny bottled on 07/05/10. I'd say this pours honey orange with a great poofy white head that sticks around for a while. After that head fades it leaves a fare amount of lacing around the sides of my Duvel tulip glass. The hop aroma coming off of this beer is something I've never experianced. It is like I am sticking my head in the hop fridge at my home brew supply store. 1st resinous piny hops, then citrus and grapefruit huge aroma. The taste is a hop assault. The malt profile is just so that it allows the hops to shine. Bitter, citrusy, fruity and sprucy/piny and oh so good. I think this is the 1st beer I've given 2 5.0 ratings too. The mouthfeel is what I would expect from an ipa. Yes folks pliny is great, but whether I could drink more then 2 of these guys is another story so a little lower score for drinkability.

T: Clean malts are quickly overpowered by pine resin and faint floral hops.  M: Smooth body and clean finish.  D: Probably my favorite aspect of this beer, it is extremely drinkable for a DIPA. Well balanced and a great representation of the style. The hops are clear and purposeful but not overwhelming or muddled in any way.  bottled on 6.30.10, drink mid-july.",Russian River Brewing Company,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,100

S - Wet, piney hops, not unlike walking through a forest after a thunderstorm. Grapefruit and lemon. Has a slight ganja quality to it ;)  T - More BIG grapefruit and pine resin with a mild biscuit malt backbone and a subtle honey sweetness. Amazingly balanced for such a hop-bomb, this is truly world-class!  M - Very smooth and creamy with a great crispness that can't be beat. Carbonation is nice and perky, the bubbles do their dance on your tongue.  D - Amazing drinkability, this bottle disappeared quickly. There's a reason there's so much hype for this beer, it's easily one of the best DIPAs on the planet.

A - If you can imagine what a million dollars lokks like in a glass, that is what this beer looks like, beautiful golden honey color with just the right amount of head.  S - (pour in sniffer glass) The expolosion of hops, hops, and more hops, slightly citrusy, fresh clean grassy aroma about it.  T - Your palate explodes with the hopiness of the beer at first sip and then it is tamed by a slight smoothness that leaves your mouth watering for another mouthfull of hops. Great combination of flavors in the beer. It is like a magic trick, hoppy bitterness at first then it finishes extremely smooth.  M - Good clean smooth feeling, quite refreshing.

S - Big citrusy hop aroma, hop bitterness, honey type sweetness, pineapple, grapefruit, and it is just really great smelling.  T - The hoppy bitterness hits first, then the honey sweetness, and grapefruit. Very well balanced!  M - Smooth and creamy mouthfeel, good carbonation and pretty luxurious in the mouth.

863,7971,Arbitrator,4.56,"Yes, I'm reviewing this a third time, this time out of a growler. Why not?  Growler filled on 7/18. Refrigerated since then and opened 7/22.  A: Pours a clear golden-amber body with 4 fingers of off-white head. Great retention and tremendous lacing. Clings to the glass with ferocity. I honestly can't picture a better head, better lacing, and better retention for a DIPA. Top marks.  S: Pine to the max. Kind of a wet pine needle aroma with an undercurrent of citrus. It's not as pungent as I remember, though not lacking in aroma.  T: A weed-like, pine-needle flavor sets the tone. There's a biscuit malt flavor that provides just enough contrast, but the one-two of pine and citrus is too much for the malt backbone. Grapefruit, lemon, some orange. The only thing that stops it from getting a perfect 5.0 is that Vinnie brews a better IIPA (Pliny the Younger) and of course, Citra has moved in.  M: Drier than some of the big DIPAs I've been drinking lately. I don't know why I used to call this beer balanced; even for a DIPA, it's really not. Not a ton of malt or residual sugar or presence: just a hop delivery vehicle. At the same time, what sugars there are mask the alcohol pretty well. Great carbonation: very cleansing.  D: I'm on course to finish a full growler myself. When it's on tap I always get it. I can't really name a beer I would drink more. It merits a 5.0 here.",Russian River Brewing Company,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,100
863,7971,ThreeWiseMen,4.43,"Stopped at Russian River Brewing Company because one of us was sure that they brewed Pliny the Elder. One of us was right.  Reviewed on tap on Tuesday July 20, 2010. Paired this with Kasseri Cheese and Carr's Table Water Crackers.  Wiseman Justin Reporting:  Appearance: The lacing is of the wall; simply beyond belief. It's golden amber in color. Clear in appearance. Epic lacing ability. Lacing is a 6 on beer advocate's five point scale. I ding points for a truly unimpressive head.  Smell: Wet, Piny hops. Citrus. Specifically lemon and grapefruit. Smells somewhat like weed which is a good thing in an IPA. Well done but somewhat on the weak side.  Taste: Very delicious and hoppy. But I am cursed to want every beer to taste like Union Jack. First of all pair this beer with your favorite cheese and crackers. Very awesome. This beer has hit the balance jack pot. It's piny, hopy, and phenomenally easy to drink for an I2PA.  Mouthfeel: Very easy and light (especially for it's style). Slightly slick, doesn't really stay with you other than a slight after taste.  Drinkability: Even more ""drinkable"" than most IPA's The 8% will catch up to you. But it won't stop you from wanting another Pliny.  Pairing Score: A. IPA's pair well with cheese.. No surprise.",Russian River Brewing Company,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,100
863,7971,gregshead,4.52,"Appearance is a copper/amber color. I have seen some IPAs lighter but for a IIPA, this was about right. Good amount of head too.  Smell was citrus and floral.  Taste was awesome. Very hoppy but the citrus and other taste balance it out really well.  Mouthful: smooth. exceptionally smooth for an IIPA.  Drinkability: Quite possibly the most drinkable IIPA/Double IPA I've ever had. Will definitely have it again.",Russian River Brewing Company,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,100
863,7971,mdwalsh,4.55,"My sixth bottle enjoyed starting 8 days after the bottled on date (May 12th) until now (July 20th). A combination of reviews.  A: Pours a big white head, almost three inches in my tulip, with biggish bubbles resting on top. Very clear golden orange with lots of active carbonation. Really an ornate looking beer. Unfortunately, the head lacks dexterity.  S: Citrus. Holy wowwy. It's like there's a bowl of fresh cut, right off the tree oranges, lemons and grapefruits right in front of me. Really not much pine, but a little. It really fills the space around me. This is I think my favorite part of this beer. It is a little dank, so not as much to my liking, but still very good.  T: Again, more intense citrus, though there is a slight sweetness buried in there. More of a sharp citrus though than the floral bouquet in the nose. I'd still like a little more pine, ans a bit more malt backbone.  M: Sort of too thin for a beer this big. I would like some more malty backbone in there both for flavor and body.

Amberish copper if that makes sense with a dense white head.  Floral sweet and seductive hop aroma that is detectable from the moment the glass is passed over.  Taste is a hop heads dream. Just like the aroma just more present and a bit more balanced but hops hops hops. Citrus, sweet, a tad piney (not pliney...). Wow!  Perect mouthfeel and leaves you wanting more.

Smooth and creamy, with a decidedly medium body. Chewy and juicy as it warms.  Citrus rind and tropical fruit flavors meld with moderate bitterness and waves of fresh, green hops, pine resin and layers of biscuity malt that provide the foundation for a surprisingly well-balanced offering. Finishes bone dry.  A beer that lives up to its perennial hype, Pliny is deserving of its position amongst the upper echelon of American DIPAs.

Some citrus and a lightly bitter aftertaste. The mix of the malt and hops are perfect. As mentioned in previous Imperial IPA posts, I get the impression that Imperial IPAs are either over the top or delightfully subdued. This fits into the latter. The hops are flavorful and the bitterness is perfect - 5.0/5.0  Feel - Extremely smooth, not as bitter as I would expect.

I went into this with an open mind and said mind was blown. absolutely incredible. best ipa i have ever had in my life. poured a dark copper...not a lot of head or apparent carbonation. Immediately I could smell hops, wheat and peaches and the taste matched just that.. very complex but not overdone. Tastes of peaches.. but not too sweet..nothing like a lambic or sour mash so do not get that impression. This beer had the perfect amount of hop-ness and bitterness to go with the fruit and earthy feel. Mouthfeel was great.. perfect amount of carbonation gave way to a very clean finish.

863,7971,djmichaelk,4.75,"Growler from the brewery, into a perfect pint (many, many times...). Had this many times, finally sitting down to review it in the perfect environment -- home!  A - Huge four-finger head on the initial pour, pillowy at first, then receding into a somewhat thick, rocky cap that lingers forever. Golden straw color, fairly clear with just a bit of haze. Plenty of lacing down the glass. Simply beautiful.  S - Very likely the best smelling beer I've had to date. From the moment you pour it, the room is filled with grapefruit, mango, passionfruit, and citrus aromas. This is the kind of beer that makes you keep your nose in the glass for hours.  T - Bitterness from the hops wallops you in the face. The citrus in the aroma doesn't quite come through in the flavor as much, but it definitely there. I've never has the sensation of eating fruit with an IPA as much as I do when drinking this beer. There's a sweet acidity to it, but again the bitterness just overwhelms it. No alcohol to speak of. Fantastic.  M - Thick and sticky, this coats my tongue like any substantial beer should. And then after a minute, it's very dry. It's very there and then it's not. Carbonation is perfect.  D - Well, the abv is there, no doubt about it. A few of these, and you're thinking about which cab company to call. But... every sip I take has me thinking to myself, ""how do I get more of this?"" The flavor just leaves you wanting more and more.  O - Up to this point, I can't think of an IPA or DIPA that I enjoy nearly as much as this one, and really only one other beer in general. I'm lucky to live where I do, in that I can have this pretty much any time with a short drive.

863,7971,Khazadum,4.17,"500 milliliters bottled on 5/26/2010, served into a 12 ounce brandy snifter, drank at 50 degrees and 55 degrees. Received via phone order from a California store.  Vision Poured in low light in my front room. It appears at first to be an aged honey color with one finger of snowy white head. When held up to a light source it shifts to the color of movie theater butter while holding its virgin white head. The lacing is truly something to be admired in this brew. It defies gravity on the edges of the snifter and pleases me as I agitate for the bouquet. Long after it has been consumed, a lacing exists around the glass.  Bouquet Upon first breath it holds a mysterious sweetness that is missing in most double IPAs I've seen. It takes a second attempt to identify tangerines. The citrus is unique as of this date for my smelling pleasure. There are brief hints of pine but only when searching for more.  Flavor Profile The smell was not misleading me. Citrus flavors explode initially on the palate and lead me to believe there is tangerines in my brew. They fade appropriately leaving a finish that starts hinting of pine, but quickly erupts into a mouth of tree branch.  The close is like walking through a winter forest looking off into the distance. Calm, quiet, clean. Everything is as it would seem. You notice the snow on the trees around you, but unfortunately you missed that tree branch that just rammed itself into your mouth. A quick punch of pine before it goes down the hatch making you wonder if it was really there as you continue staring at the scenery.  It is not a clean finish, but its damn close. The bitterness lingers pleasantly but does not overwhelm. I welcome it to play with my taste buds. All flavors blend well and play at their allotted times sip after sip. There is no one note, but a grand symphony.  Oral Sensations When it comes to mouth feel I wasn't expecting the enjoyable body that Pliny has. It flows and lays its gentle head upon my tongue, but after swallowing it only lingers for a moment. The feel is exactly as it should be.  Closing It is one of the most drinkable DIPAs as of date. No problem consuming the entire bottle solo, and would drink another if desired.  As a double IPA, it is most certainly a pleasant experience but not my favorite one. Bias and hype may have raised my hopes too much for this beer, but that does not mean it didn't come close to meeting some of them.",Russian River Brewing Company,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,100
863,7971,KickInTheChalice,4.55,"Lots of thanks to realmpel for shipping this to me. As an IPA lover (in all forms - DIPA, IIPA included), this was THE one I have been waiting for. Poured from a 500 mL bottle into a tulip. Freshness date 6/21/10.  Appearance: Great looking right from the start. A slightly hazy orange amber color with a tight fluffy white head, with a few large errant bubbles on top. Some resplendent carbonation rises from the bottom of the glass. Pretty good retention, and there are rings of lacing down the glass.  Smell: An elegant aroma, extremely hoppy but oh so balanced on the nose. Pineapple, grapefruit, a bit of orange, and tons of pine overwhelm my olfactory system.  Taste: Starts out and stays strongly hoppy the whole way through. Such a wide range of flavors that all work well together. Pine is the single strongest noticeable flavor, but orange, pineapple, grapefruit, and a bit of herbal goodness are present throughout each sip. The malt is not of the same strength as the hops, but it does not let me down like in some pure hop bombs. Some soft sweetness and a little spicy flavor keeps me interested. Lingering bitterness after the sip, but I do not mind it.  Mouthfeel: There is not a way to make this smoother while keeping the great crisp feel. The carbonation is not overdone, but it is a smooth operator, bringing a great pop to the taste.  Drinkability: This beer keeps getting better and better. There was absolutely no way it could have met my expectations, but it came pretty close. It would be a treat to have this available more often.",Russian River Brewing Company,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,100
863,7971,cbak999,4.82,"I was lucky enough to receive this bottle from a friend. I was super excited knowing the hype that surrounds this and many other Russian River beers. The bottle was dated 5/10/10. I poured the beer into a snifter.  A: A golden orange color with a 1/4"" of head that laces the glass with each swallow. I could count the number of sips as I neared the end of this great sample.  S: All hops. Very earthy and piney with a hint of citrus.  T: Again...hops. But not overbearing. A super nice balance between the hops, alcohol, and malt. One of the best balanced IPAs out there.  D: As decribed by the taste, this is super good going down. Not knowing the ABV, you would think it's in the 6.5 range.  After drinking my half (I shared with a friend), I now can appreciate this beer as the 6th best in the world. It was amazing!!!",Russian River Brewing Company,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,100
863,7971,timonan,4.92,"I finally snagged an ever-elusive bottle here in Southern California. I got the last four bottles of a 3 case shipment that just showed up a few hours ago. Man, this beer disappears fast.  A - Bright gold, clear, with a nice bubbly, foamy head that dissipates fairly quickly and leaves a thin lacing.  S - Floral and piney, a classic and vibrant IPA bouquet. The wonderful smell of hops just leaves me eager to drink it.  T - A light and smooth start, the hops don't hit immediately, but slowly find their way onto the tongue, unleashing a refreshing and intense burst of bitterness and flavor. Pine, citrus, sweet, floral, all combine simultaneously in a wonderful balance. Most IPA's feel very divided to me in their flavors, and the hops can be too harsh, simply for show. The Pliny melds them in a perfect combination - nothing is too overpowering or unnecessary.  M - Smooth and simple carbonation, not very bubbly after a few minutes. A stronger carbonation might help stir up the flavor more, but still, it is light and soft on the tongue, which provides a nice contrast to the bitterness and lends to a clean and crisp finish, sweet and satisfying.  D - One of the most drinkable IPA's I've ever had, particularly for a double. A wonderfully complex and satisfying drinking experience from start to finish. This is my new favorite IPA, perhaps my new overall favorite.  I can see the attraction, almost obsession that this beer creates - it is well deserved. The man at the store I picked up the beer at (do I dare say where?) said that they can't order near as much as they would like to - the demand far outweighs the supply Russian River can turn out. Hopefully soon that won't be a problem, but in the meantime, I will continue the search for this Holy Grail of IPA's.",Russian River Brewing Company,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,100
863,7971,HosP,4.53,"Received from Scottfrie in a trade, thank you very much!  A- Golden, with a slight haze. Small head that left lace down the glass.  S- Very hoppy smell. citrus and pine mostly. Not as strong as I imagined it would be.  T- Full of hop flavor, just like it should be. Bitterness is there but doesn't take over the beer. Just enough malt taste to keep it smooth!  M- Medium body. Good balance between hops and malts. Good amount of carbonation.  D- Makes me wish I lived on the West Coast! I am a big fan of Dreadnaught, which isn't normal, but this is an ideal dipa!

Originally tasted: 5/1/2010  On tap (at Toronado!) into a glass pint. 45°F~  S: Pine hope aroma gracefully dominates with hints of apricot citrus floating in the background. Well balanced and far from aggressive. Hits you in the face and makes you say, ""thank you.""  A: Deep amber body filled with shimmering haze and topped with a big loose head that recedes quickly leaving a generous sticky lace and a thin bubbly ring around the base.  T: Sweet caramel and bready backbone showcasing an undeniable pine intensity and lovely grapefruit flavor. Well balanced throughout giving way to lingering bitterness.  M: Medium body and medium carbonation. No resin stickiness. Bitterness prickles the tongue.  D: Great beer, but not something to overdo. Have one and enjoy it, then process it. This is a special drink.  O: Worthy of the hype. A special DIPA and a special beer period.",Russian River Brewing Company,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,100
863,7971,Chizoad,4.62,"Baby steps. The first time I had this one I wasn't prepared. Now I've revisited it after some ""seasoning"".  Looks great in the glass. Nice off white head with a clear amber color and some bubbles dancing around the edges. Smells of a wide range of citrus, with the hoppy bitterness promised but somehow not overwhelming.  This is exactly how the beer tastes, but everything blends ideally to make something that is unbeatable for the style. Pine, juniper, maybe even cedar, jumbled amongst orange and grapefruit rind with lemon in there too. Enough sweetness to actually do some good balancing.  Resin never overwhelms the palate, with medium body and carbonation. Shockingly drinkable, probably because it tastes so damn good.  Even if you don't take price into consideration, this is a stupendously good beer. For $4, it probably can't be beat.",Russian River Brewing Company,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,100
863,7971,sm007thie,4.44,"A- golden color, slightest haze, lumpy creamy head if poured aggresively.  S- smell is absolutely fantastic. if you take your time, you can smell every fresh hops odor imaginable. grassy, citrus, piney, resinous goodness. wow!  T- exeptionally smooth given the intense hops character. each sip has a pleasant grapefruit flavor followed by an split second of hops bite and a sm007th, complex hops finish. malt is present enough to balance, but is definitely playing a minor supporting role.  M- carbonation seems to reverberate off of the toungue giving pliney a refreshing feel.  D- obviously a beer of this intensity and ABV wasn't formulated with ""drinkability"" too much in mind. however, everything works together so well to create an invigorating brew.",Russian River Brewing Company,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,100
863,7971,earthling,4.9,"Like so many other obsessed enthusiasts and alcoholics, this is one of my all-time favorite beers. Its heavy, strong, and sometimes overwhelming aroma is incredible and inspiring. The pungence of Pliney commands any pot smoker to drink beer and any beer drinker to pay attention. Pliny is the secret mistress of any IPA lover, its contact-high inducing aroma erecting senses and inducing appreciation.  Pliney the Elder makes people happy, as does its proclamation ""DO NOT AGE!""  Any home brewer leaves incredulous after tasting this beer for the first time, whether he likes it or not.  Pliny's intensity nearly commands a new classification for beers. It's so well crafted that the incredible amount of hops used don't contribute unduly to its bitterness. The citrusy, evergreen, even piney of pliny balance the bitterness and malt to create a truly amazing beer.",Russian River Brewing Company,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,100
863,7971,TMoney2591,4.47,"Served in a Dogfish Head snifter.  Thanks to stoutjimmy for this bottle!  My second Pliny, but first review thereof. It pours a hazy, golden amber-straw, topped by a quickly-dying finger of white froth. The nose comprises a hella-ton o' pine, along with some grapefruit, orange peel, maple sap, and a tiny bit o' caramel in the back, trying to maintain some semblence of a malty backbone. It's got me convinced it's hoppy... The taste follows very similarly, though the two DIPA elements are both sharpened for battle: The hops are especially fruity and flowery, while the malts (caramel and toffee, natch) are stronger, more up to the task of balancing out the hops. I gotta say, the hype has been dead on: this is the most balanced DIPA I've had in a long time. And quite tasty, too. The body is a light-ish medium, with a moderately active carbonation and a fairly dry finish. Yup, this old Roman naturalist lives up to the hype. Get some!",Russian River Brewing Company,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,100
863,7971,sfprint,4.47,"A: Hazy, ice tea brown. Bubbles racing too the top. Quickly dissipating head.  S: Excellent. Excellent. Sweet, pine, apricot with very mild hops. Beautiful smell. Apple juice too. Can't detect any alcohol.  T: Not too bitter, like I find many IPA's to be. It has more depth than most IPA's, multiple flavors that come in parallel. The bitterness is separate from the almost fruity, tea like layer. Interesting and very nice.  M: It's not special, but it's very good. It lightly carbonated, and feels great going down.  D: great. If you can hang with the bitterness of IPA's this is among the top.",Russian River Brewing Company,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,100
863,7971,GarrettMD,4.88,"A - Pours a very nice golden color with a two finger white head that dissipates fairly quickly. Good lacing. Great heavy carbonation, same as most RR brews.  S - Extremely piney. Slight citrusy background that goes well. mostly piney, floral, hops though. Very slight bready smell as well.  T - Great taste, very close to the smell, still very piney, but the citrus flavors come out more. Slightly sweet, but the malts balance that out. Overall, the hops are not too overpowering, they are in perfect balance with the rest of the beer.  M - Great mouthfeel, carbonation with the hop bitterness just gives your mouth a lot to process.  D - Extremely drinkable. Doesn't taste anything close to 8%. Very smooth and the well balanced hops don't cause this beer to be too bitter.  If I could get these more readily, I would drink them much more often, because it is by far my favorite IPA. I haven't had Pliny the Younger, but I can't see any way to improve on this beer. It just seems to be the perfect IPA.",Russian River Brewing Company,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,100
863,7971,elgiacomo,4.25,"500ml bottle courtesy my sister from Seattle. Bottled May 17, 2010, consumed a little over a month old.  Pours a hazy golden amber with a large fluffy off-white head that recedes nicely to a foamy island and ring. Leaves thick clumpy rings of lacing.  Aroma is piney, citrus, grapefruit, tangerine, tropical fruits, some floral hops, caramel malt, yeast and bread. Pretty fruity and sweet, almost sugary for a DIPA, but as it warms the pine and citrus rind really come into play.  Flavor is some nice juicy citrus, grapefruit, pineapple, pine and resinous hops, some spicy malt, a little sweetness, then an excellent lingering bitterness on the finish. Not a whole lot of alcohol, which I like, glad this is at 8% ABV instead of 10%+ like some in the category.  Mouthfeel is pretty full, quite sticky, medium carbonation.  I've been looking forward to finally cracking open a Pliny, and this was a real treat. Really runs the gamut on flavors and evolves a lot as it warms.

This review is based on my two most recent encounters with PtE at Hamilton's Tavern and the Neighborhood.  A- Pours a deep golden color with minimal head and slightly sticky lacing.  S- Floral and citrus hops are still there but much less assertive than in the past. There is some sweet malt aromas mixed in that weren't always so prominent.  T- I still really like the flavor of PtE more than other IPA's on the market but there is a lot more residual malt sweetness nowadays. The zesty citrus and floral hop flavors are still there but it isn't as dry.

At the first sip there were strong citrus and grapefruit taste with the right amount of hops.  It is a very decent beer, but not sure if it lived up to all the hype.

S: Citrus and pine balanced out nicely by malt backbone.  T: This may sound ridiculous but the taste is very balanced----both the hop flavors and the hop/malt balance. I know this is a DIPA but I wouldn't refer to this as a hop bomb. The various hop flavors all complement each other-- lemon, orange, pine, grass,etc.  M: Fantastic! Solid medium body.

There is just heaps of fruity hops, including that wonderful mango pineapple peachy taste that clears the sinuses. A really bitter back that finishes almost sweet, and just forces you to come back for more.  Mouthfeel: Very dry and crisp, leaves your tongue sticky.  Drinkability: This is true hop head nirvana.

A - Poured into a tulip glass with a beautiful head that dissipates slowly.. at least an inch head and great lacing. Looks a dark orange great IPA color..  S - Wow it jumps out at you.. this is one you love to smell and it's very hard to peel your nose away from this. smell those fresh grapefruit/pineapple hops... excellent!

D - again with low abv it's so hard to believe this stuff is 8%. much thanx to smutty 33 for getting this a few times as we're in CT and you can't get it out here.. that makes me very sad... lol.. excellent beer.. i'm with the other million people that have reviewed this and said A+..,Russian River Brewing Company,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,100

863,7971,Augustiner719,4.74,"Poured from a 12oz bottle into a tulip glass, bottled 5/12/2010. One month exactly.  Appearance: Pours a very light orange sunset color with a touch of hop haze. Almost a yellow orange color with a nice 2 finger white head that recedes to honeycomb like bubbles with great lacing.  Smell: This is the most intense nose on a DIPA i have ever experienced. Huge mango, pineapple, grapefruit peel aroma with a touch of pine sweetness but mostly citrus fruits. unbelievable potent. A touch of honey sweetness on the backend.  Taste: Upfront sweetness followed with a stingy but good hop bitterness and finishes with pineapple sweetness on the back end. Nice midpalate of bitter pine, grapefruit pith and then balanced out by a smooth malty backbone. This has good balance for such a hop forward DIPA, but it does lack the strong malt characteristics i like, but i guess this is obviously a west coast style.  Mouthfeel: Light and crisp on the palate. Very clean finishing and refreshing for such a flavor packed beer. 8%abv is hidden and it feels like a regular IPA on the palate.  Drinkablility: Scary how easy this goes down. it is intense but for what its worth, its perfect in this category because its got the structure to hold up its huge hop profile.

863,7971,Briken,4.49,"Clear light amber with orange tint and very aggressive tan foamy head. Aroma is a very compelling, super citrusy hop with a little pine and a sticky sweetness if you believe you could smell that. A big hop slap upfront is pine mostly but mellows (as much as this can possibly mellow) into orange and lemon and light sticky sweet background. But the sweetness seems to come from the hops, and not the malts. There is no malt flavors to speak of, in fact the feel is almost like a tea of hops in carbonated water. That being said, it does round out a bit as it warms. The hop bitterness in the finish is strong but isn't overblown and lingers for quite some time though not unpleasantly.  I was all ready to think this beer was just an overblown hop head beer. It really is a hop lovers dream come true but the balance of hop characteristics is quite unbelievable. I will say that no beer is worth being obsessed about as much as it seems a lot of prople are but certainly a great beer that has to be tried to be believed. I'm glad I finally got the opportunity.",Russian River Brewing Company,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,100
863,7971,oregonskibum,4.68,"Consumed PtE many times, but thought my 100th review would be a good time to review it. Plus it's fresh, bottled 5/26, consumed 6/12.  A: Color is a bright tangerine orange with hints of gold at the edges. Pours with a healthy 1 1/2 inch head, gradually dissipates leaving some limited lacing.  S: Can't get enough of the smell. Huge resiney, piney hops dominate. There may be hints of citrus hops and some bready flavors. Knocked down .5 because I know in a side-by-side that PtY knocks this flavor up even one more notch.  T: Taste continues where the smell leaves off with more oily, green, piney goodness. A healthy malt backbone provides a slighly sweet taste that balances out the beer. The finish is bitter with enough hop flavors to make for a very nice finish. No noticable warmth from the 8% alcohol.  M: Medium body (light for style) with moderate carbonation. Very dry and easy to drink. There are 5% beers that feel bigger than this. So very nice.  D: I'll admit to being biased. I have long considered PtE to be one of the best beers in teh world and if stock on a desert island, this would be my choice.

863,7971,hopsbreath,4.22,"Picked a few bottles of this up at Beaumont Market and split all three with the wife today in a pair of twelve ounce tulips I picked up at the Dollar store. The glasses are an awesome value and highly recommended. The Pliny's were bottled on 05/26/2010. I've reviewed this on tap once before but wanted to review the fresh bottle form now as well. On to the review!  The appearance is quite good. The body is a lite yellow gold in color and is very clear with minimal unfiltered sediment goodness in suspension. A few fingers of ivory soapy head hang over the top of the liquid and slowly recedes to a thin cap. Lacing remains where the head formed but doesn't continue down the glass.  Smell is piney, fresh oily hop, tropical citrusy goodness! Some honey exists as well lending to the wonderful bouquet. It may be the highlight of the drink.  The taste is mainly oily bitter pine. Sweet tangelos add to the light malt backbone that exists only to embrace that wonderful fresh hop goodness. Some alcohol shows up to lend some warmth to the end of the drink but is in no way unwelcome.  Is this 8 percent? You could've fooled me. We plowed through 3 half liters like it was nobody's business and wanted more. The appropriate carbonation helps this go down oh so smooth. I will be looking for this next time it comes to Portland and recommend anybody who sees this available to buy a bottle or three! They can be hard to find so don't pass them up!",Russian River Brewing Company,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,100
863,7971,appenzeller,4.62,"Bottled on 5/17, which is 3 weeks ago.  Pour is an orangish gold with typical clarity for the style. Thick one-fingered head that recedes quickly.  The freshness of this beer shows up front. Smell is all about hops, citrusy, fresh, bright. Taste is perfect for the style, great freshness, bright and citrusy in the mouth, good balance of sweet and bitter. The single thing that impresses me most about this beer is that it showcases hops in abundance (American I believe) without being way over the top. It is bursting with flavor yet exceptionally smooth. A bright lingering aftertaste of the citrusy hops. I certainly do love IPAs/double IPAs and this is as good as any I've had for sure.  This is indeed an outstanding beer. Frankly, if I wanted to show someone that the States makes good beer in its own styles, this would probably be the first thing I'd hand them.",Russian River Brewing Company,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,100
863,7971,axeman9182,4.77,"Glad to crack a beer of this caliber for my 50th review, and cheers to psiweaver for the May 12th 2010 bottle. The beer pours a burnt orange in my Duvel tulip, with a frothy, 3 finger off white head quickly forming and lingering. The lacing is decent, but just a bit short of earning a 5 for appearance. A pungent hop aroma is present even as I pour, and grapefruit, pineapple, and bitter orange peels are appreciable. Each sip leads off with the briefest of flashes of bready and caramel malt sweetness, before a shotgun blast of hop bitterness asserts itself. This fades into a more citrus hop flavor, largely pineapple and grapefruit. If the hop bitterness vs flavor balance was tipped a little bit more towards flavor Pliny would get a 5, but it's not quite there. Carbonation is high, but to good effect as it helps highlight all the juicy hop goodness, and I'm surprised at how creamy the mouthfeel is given the relative lack of malt presence. I wouldn't expect to notice much alcohol at 8%, but I don't find any at all as I sip on Pliny, and it's so damn tasty that it's a struggle to stop and savor this despite the bitterness. Truly world class, and the template against which all DIPAs should be measured.",Russian River Brewing Company,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,100
863,7971,rawthar,4.42,"A- Hazy golden blood-tinged yellow, with a thin white sticky head that left some pretty traces of film and collar.  S- A brilliantly bitter hop assault, more on the pine and grass side than citrus. Nary a malt tone sneaking past that concrete wall of hops.  T- An intense hard bitter hop, with a sharp tar/rubber tire backbone, a lot like PtY, but with a tad bit less of a complexity. Can't wait to try them side by side next year.  M- Thick, full, and robust.  D- If there weren't so may other awesome beers to sample at this Philly Beer Week event, I'd have been drinking this all night.

Orange grapefruit, mandarins. The smell is making my mouth water; can only hope that it tastes as good as it smells.  T- Boy does it ever! Piney, sweet, grapefruit, lemon rind. The bitter hop oils puts a smile on my face.  M- Creamy, silky, bitterness tingles my cheeks. The feel is just perfect.  D- This is by far the most drinkable DIPA I've ever had. Nowhere do you realize that this is 8%. It's too bad I'm 2500+ km away because I'd never drink another beer.  Extra special thanks to whitebricke for supplying me with this! It's travelled very far, and we hit a couple hiccups on the way but he was right; it was WELL WORTH IT!! This definately is a world class brew and I'm so glad I got to try this.

S- Heavy doses of bitter hops, and earthy pine smell along with some citrus compliments. Some citrus fruits noticeable as well, pineapple and maybe grapefruit to be specific before they are drowned back into the hop oils.  T- There may be the faintest hint of malt that is overwhelmed by hop bitterness. The grassy and pine tastes very evident as citrus notes dart in for a glimpse of taste before fading back into the extreme hoppy taste. Finishes with a slight but smooth taste of alcohol that leaves you refreshed.  M- Medium body with a moderate amount of carbonation that makes this smooth drinking for a summer day.  D- Surely a palate killer as this one attacks the mouth pretty well, but still remarkably easy to drink the entire bottle.",Russian River Brewing Company,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,100

A - The glass arrives at the table with a lightly hazy golden yellow color with a thin white head from the pour and good lace left all over the glass.  S - Pliny just reeks of American hops. It's got a huge, bold aroma of grapefruit citrus and a hint of lime and pine. Pale malts back it all up nicely. A fantastic hoppy nose.  T - The flavor mirrors the aroma with a bold grapefruit citrus punch and lemon and pine hints. The malts are overshadowed in the taste but, really, that's ok.  M - This beer packs a bitter punch to the finish. The hops just tear you up. Medium-bodied and well carbonated.  D - I love this beer and it's flavor and potency but it's just a little bit bitter for me to put down more than one of.",Russian River Brewing Company,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,100
863,7971,Gorgoroth,4.8,"Special thanks to mattc7301 on eBay for this excellent acquisition. Bottle date: 04/23/10 Reviewed: 05/16/10  Presentation: Lovely brown glass bomber with the minimalistic, post-modernist-looking label using primarily bold red and green contrasting colors. Contains some humorous messages about drinking Pliny while fresh around the perimeter of the label.  Appearance: Steady pour into an oversize snifter yields a deep gold body with orange hues, creamy off-white head which dissipates quickly to small, foamy islands, leaves creamy, spotted lacing; active carbonation.  Smell: An assault of floral hops on the front of the nose with elements of spicy black pepper, honey, and pine.  Taste: Sweet floral hops up front with a bitter and dry hop finish; notable malt character with honey notes on the palate.  Mouthfeel: A rather thin body with a creamy texture from the head, lively carbonation, and a smooth but very dry finish.  Drinkability/Final Thoughts: A very potent but also very drinkable brew. I figure at a few weeks after bottle-date, I'm drinking it about as fresh as I ever will in Michigan. And as such, I was a little surprised to find that it is not the most outrageously hoppy or powerful Imperial IPA I've had. But that doesn't detract from the beer itself. I do think it lives up to its infamy and am very glad I was able to come by a bottle, especially such a fresh one. If they were available in my area, I'd probably buy them often, but as it ends up costing me nearly $30 to get a bottle of this in my hands, I'll probably stick with just the one for now.",Russian River Brewing Company,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,100
863,7971,Brabander,4.52,"My 100th review!!  Got the beer in a trade with SevenB. Many thanks to my BA brother Troy from Oregon!  This is my very first VERY good American beer that i drank. I can see why this Pliny is on the 7th place in beerheaven.  Poured in my Struise glass, a gift from Urbain from the Struise Brouwers, the beer shows itself very well. A nice big white head with a fluid which has a lot of carbonation. That's what i like in a beer.  The smell is exeptional, i am not the best 'smeller' but here i smelled a lot of nice fruits like peach and a bit of pineapple.  The fruittaste gives the beer a very good mouthfeel. A hell of a beer, can i get some more?  Drinking an aged pliny? Read here:  We had a beertasting at Beerpirates place on sunday the 15th of may 2011. Jeffo, Claark13, Bierschenker, beerpirates and i drank a whole bunch of beers. Thanks for your hospitality Wim!  Poured in my Westvleteren tastingglass this beer still looks good. almost a year old it has lost some of it's hops. Very good to drink though!  I had a third pliny in august 2011. To be honest the pliny was not as good as the Elliot brew from the Struise brouwers. Too bitter....",Russian River Brewing Company,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,100

S- alot of hops. i picked up some nice citrus hops as well as some nice tropical fruit aromas. also a backing of pine and earthy hops here. there's a decent malt backbone to the aroma as well that holds up nicely against the hops.  T- not what i was expecting. i was expecting a bitter hop blowout all the way through. exact opposite. nice fruit hop flavors mainly citrus and tropical fruit with some pine and earth in the background. good maltiness helps carry this beer along and doesnt let the hops beat the hell out of ur palate.

863,7971,MbpBugeye,4.67,"Stoney73 sent me two bottles, the second one was an awesome surprise. Both bottled on 5/17/10. I finally get to try some PtE.  A- Very nice looking. Super clear and bright, glowing orange with yellow highlights. The head is very dense and very white. It sticks around for a while before it fades into some soap sudsy looking pillows. Spotty lacing all the way day is the result.  S- Wow, amazing smelling. Obviously its heavy on hops. All sorts of hops. The pine is the first that comes to my attention. Lots of very spicy hops, rosemary, parsley and sage. Swirl this around after it warms slightly and there are notes of orange creamsicle and grapefruits.  T- I was slightly let down in the taste department. I cant give it a 5 here. I wanted more of that creamsicle, grapefruit and juiciness I was getting on the tail end of the nose. There is lots of pine and spiciness. Alcohol comes around from time to time upon the finish. Towards the end of the glass, after it got slightly warmer, malts came out. They were toasty and nicely sweet. A big wash of bitterness lingers well after each swallow. While it is very good, its not the best tasting IPA Ive had.  M- Dry, lingeringly bitter but not oily. The body is right around medium as is the carbonation.  D- I really could drink this stuff all night. It goes down way too easily.",Russian River Brewing Company,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,100

I poured this into a Duvel Tulip. Look: A hazy, pumpkin orange with moderate carbonation. Large, 2 1/2 finger head that stuck around for about 5 minutes. Moderate lacing is left behind. Smell: Hops all over the place. Lots of pine and citrus notes and some less pronounced earthy hops in the background. There is a sugary alcohol at the end, but it isn't too overwhelming. Taste/Mouth: Almost as good as on tap. Just like it smells. Unlike a few other DIPA's I've had, they really found a great mixture of hops that are strong and bitter, but not overwhelming. Goes down smooth and dry. Drink: Great price, great beer. It's a big beer but won't knock you down. I could sip on a few of these often enough.

863,7971,ryno09,4.45,A little bit fruit and some pine-yness - just your typical west coast IIPA nose. Bottled on 5/12 this is about as fresh as I could get.

I get floral grapefruits and oranges in both the smell and the taste and the balance of grapefruits and oranges tilts to the oranges as it warms up in the glass a little. The feel is perfectly viscous, the carbonation is perfectly carbonated, and the look is perfect looking. It's a bright orange sunset with bubbles.  This is my favorite beer and I consider myself lucky to have it within a 5 minute walk of my house. I never drink more than one in a night and rarely more than one a week.

Lots of grapefruit, a little pine with some baked bread in the background. Tantalizing.  Tastes great. Awesome balance between the citrus and pine like flavors. The citrus has elements of grapefruit, oranges, lemon zest. Starts out with the sweetness of fruit and the bitterness flares up briefly in the finish. Doesn't feel too carbonated or too syrupy, huge fan and wish that RR distributed to MI (really enjoyed the other couple of beers I had from them).

863,7971,homebrew311,4.89,"Received as a kick ass extra from an awesome trader- thanks millah! I've been wanting to try this for a long time now. This bottle is 2 weeks young!  A: pours a very pale golden yellow color with a half finger head upon pour, head leaves sticky splotches of bubbles, head doesn't retain itself for long  S: holy hops! huge pungent juicy aroma of grapefruit, lemon, pine, some grassy notes, and a nice noticeable malt backbone, bready notes with yeasty accents. This stuff smells amazing.  T: the front has a lot of nice sweetness with notes of honey and grapefruit, this gives way to a huge hop bitterness, nothing overwhelming but certainly in your face, this then gives way to the malt backbone that I noticed on the nose. The balance is perfect. Everything is big and bold, but nothing overwhelms. As I sip on this, I wonder where the 8% abv is, because it drinks like a 4%er. Wow, I have been missing out on this brew- extraordinary!  MF: clean crisp mouthfeel, medium carbonation, very smooth going down  D: this is a world class DIPA and I am thrilled to have finally tried it, and super fresh as well.

This beer is clear to mildly hazy with a creamy, bubbly, white head. Nice lacing forms and lingers all over the glass. A truly beautiful beer!  Smell: There is the distinct aroma of evergreen pine, zesty grapefruit, spearmint, ripe pineapple and sweet candied orange with a suggestion of honey.  Taste: Hop bitterness lead by citrus and pine flavors are balanced by some bready malts and candied oranges. Also, the hop bitterness is experienced both up front and on the back of the tongue with artful equilibrium.  Mouthfeel: High carbonation. Again, nicely balanced, not too thick or thin. The feel is smooth and silky over the palate with just the right amount of syrupy consistency. It becomes more impressive and discernibly complex as the beer warms a little.  Drinkability: Exceptionally drinkable with incredible balance. In addition, the alcohol hides in this beer, quietly providing gradual warmth.  Comments: An outstanding beer overall!

A- Golden (with a hint of orange), hazy- with a 1 finger foamy head that reduced to a lace-foam that painted murals on the glass.  S- Hop heaven- citrus, pine, citrus, pine, and citrus. Part of the experience of this beer is the nose full of sweet hop aroma with each sip.  T- Full hop flavor, but the bitterness does not overpower up front. Dryer, subtle finish with more of a hop bite on the back of the tongue.  M- Nice balance-doesn't feel thick (for a DIPA); good carbonation, medium to full body.  D- If there were a hotel next door, I'd continue to drink these until I'm just able to walk to my room. Unless I have friends along who can carry me, if so pour me another!

S: loads of fabulous piney hops with nice sweet malts, citrus fruits, caramel, and hints of honey in the nose as well.  T: beautiful pine hop notes like the nose but the sweet malts balance out perfect and cirtus fruits, caramel, and sweet honey propel the overall flavor experience. Really great balance of ingredients that go into this treat.  M: medium body with moderate amount of carbonation to accent the overall flavor of the beer that has a nice refreshing bitter finish and lingers on the palate.  D: I really appreciate this beer the more I drink it. I can't say enough good things about but I'm glad that I have access to it on a daily basis.

863,7971,DrMalt,4.5,"A - somewhat of a hop haze? A midpoint between orange & yellow. Fantastic 2 finger sturdy head with loads of lacing.  S - Not the twangy grapefruit, pine that I was expecting, but indeed a pleasant sweet floral & citrus bouquet.  T - Again not what I was expecting - no over the top bitter, astringent flavours, however, what super way of carrying off the hop flavours of grassy, pine & citrus. No off or indifferent flavours whatsoever. Just a well refined profile.  M - This is where Pliny makes his mark! If I closed my eyes I thought I was drinking a draught version. Very, very creamy and smooth, with a lighter body and mouthfeel. Alcohol is subdued for a DIPA.  D - Well that was a different DIPA than I was expecting for a West Coast brewery. I used think that best was boldest - not true anymore. What a wonderful hoppy & drinkable DIPA.  Thanks to a fellow beer hunter for directing me onto this last bottle of PTE in the store!

Small but thick white head that recedes quickly and leaves lots of lacing behind. Nose is hugely hoppy, mostly citrus hops. Taste follows the nose with tons of hops. That hop bitterness is off the charts but in a good way, not like some other double IPAs that just fry the palate. Despite the abundance of hop flavor and bitterness there is a distinctly malty note towards the finish. The high abv is well hidden, although as it warms some alcohol notes find their way through. Drinkability is great too, could drink these all day were it not for the high abv. This is a GREAT beer but I think I got a little swept away in all the hype as I felt a bit disappointed. Maybe I'll see if I can get a fresher bottle next time around but I doubt much could have possible been lost in a little over a month.

Poured from the bottle to a pint glass, the review is from notes taken on 5/22/2010.  Appearance: Pour is a crisp, golden and coppery color and starts with a 1/2 finger white head with pretty decent retention; head eventually fades to a full, but uneven skim; body is perfectly clear and shows light carbonation; the beer leaves nice washes and spots and small curtains of lacing behind as I drink it down.  Smell: Tons of wonderfully bitter and smooth citric hops (grapefruit and orange peel) -- nose is super strong and just makes my mouth water thinking about drinking this beer; a slight malty and sweet backing kind of sneaks in there, but the hops really dominate and they're awesome!  Taste: Holy schyte, near perfect! Tons of wonderfully bitter and citric and flavorful hops -- a perfectly balanced beer with a slight honey-sweet malt backing that allows those hops to dominate -- wonderfully simple, but amazingly awesome and refreshing.  Mouthfeel: Body is of medium weight, and the carbonation is smooth, yet present; doesn't sit heavy at all which is a little strange for a DIPA, but damn, I'll take it! Very crisp and refershing; a nice thick coating is left on the mouth.  Drinkability: This is definitely an all-day kind of beer.

The flavor is fairly sweet with a nice crisp maltiness of caramel beneath an abundance of hops. Hops, hops and more hops. Great juicy fruit aromas and notes of pine-needles.

Grapefruit rind, lemon and lime, a bit of mandarin sweetness. A dash of pine for good measure. Big hop nose.  Tastes like one real hoppy beer. Orange sweetness right up front followed by a strongly citric ride of hops from middle to ending. Despite so much focus on bitter flavour, it comes across as smooth tasting.  Light bodied but a bit slick/oily. Carbonation just above average. Good feel to it.  Despite being 8% abv and full of hops, this is no sipper, it drinks like a session beer.

863,7971,LukeD23,4.92,"Thanks to a friendly beeradvocater I am getting to try this beer here on the east coast! Thanks so much!  Pours a very nice pure golden color with a bone white head.  Aroma of pine, fresh cut grass, and tarragon are smelled upon cracking the bottle. The hop aroma is so close to a fresh hop vine it is hard to believe. I get a slight grassy note, with grapefuit and a backround of pear.  Flavor - ok let me tackle the malt first..malt character is a subtle sourdough and caramel malts, obviously this beer is not about the malt, but, it is a very nice backround to the beer. On to the hops, I am utterly amazed at the hop flavor in this beer. As a homebrewer this beer is as close to eating or drinking a hop cone as I have come, there are lots of herbal notes coming through and a small amount of citrus lime peel, and finishing with a spicey punch. There is alot of that dankey hop flavor coming through...I hear this beer is calculated at some 250+ibus, but the bitterness is amazingly subdued, It tasted like a 90 ibu beer, but the hop sweetness is so full so rounded, I am blown away. (subnote, just gave my fiancee a taste of this beer and she said it was nice and balanced! Im so proud!!!)  Mouthfeel is so solid, it supports the hop flavor. It is medium bodied and finishes dry. Not very dry, but dry. I could drink multiple pints of this stuff, dangerous at 8%. mmmm  overall- I would say this is by far the best double IPA I have had, it has so much hop flavor and aroma, yet is drinkable, I have had alot of double IPas that leave me reaching for water to try to cleanse the palate, not with Pliny. As an east coaster I am blown away, I live next door to Dogfish Head, so I love hoppy beer, but this one is like 90 through 2 or 3 randells. Thanks Vinnie!",Russian River Brewing Company,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,100
863,7971,sidetracked,4.33,"Pours clear gold with a light cream head. Bottle dated 4/29/2010, consumed 5/14/2010.  Smells of pine, grapefruit, and citrus with a bitter crispness.  Taste is bitter pine and grapefruit with a light toffee malt middle. Finish is bitter and mostly pine and grapefruit peel.  Light to medium body with good carbonation. Slightly dry finish.  Much better than the last bottle--more citrus/grapefruit aroma and flavor without the odd chalky bitterness. Nice mix of pine and grapefruit, enjoyable hop presence, and easy to drink.  --- Original Review - 4/30/2010. 4.5/4.0/3.0/4.0/3.5  Traded for at Dark Lord Day and drank last night. Bottle dated 3/26/2010. There is a lot of sediment in the bottom of the bottle.  Pours a hazy pale amber with an off-white head. Good head retention and lots of lacing.  Smell is bitter piney hops.  The taste follows the smell with strong piney hops leading way to a minuscule malt presence. Odd bitter finish reminds me of orange peel or unripened fruit. No bitter grapefruit flavor to be found.  Mouthfeel is between light and medium bodied with a somewhat high carbonation level.  This was not what I was expecting. The hop/malt balance is good, but the hop flavors just didn't appeal to me. The bitterness wasn't pleasant and the flavor was very one-dimensional. I'm going to give this the benefit of the doubt and try to seek out another bottle based on others' reviews.",Russian River Brewing Company,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,100
863,7971,Skywave,4.12,"Pours to thick white head and lace, hazy orange-yellow color. Aroma is piney, citrusy and a little sweet malt thrown in.

Overall very good but not living up to its hype.",Russian River Brewing Company,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,100
863,7971,busternuggz,4.43,"Poured from a 500 ml bottle into a pint glass. Beautiful deep golden color with a nice fluffy head. Delicious smells of grapefruit and orange and a little pine, which also came through in the taste. Has a nice malt balance and a pleasant aftertaste too, not too bitter, held on just the right amount of time. The most remarkable thing about it was the super creamy and smooth texture of the beer, unlike any IPA I've ever had. Very drinkable, had the whole bottle myself and could have had another. I don't know about it being in the top ten, but this is definitely one of the best IPA's I've had. I think I liked Blind Pig a little better though.",Russian River Brewing Company,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,100
863,7971,chaz01,4.22,"Sharing a bottle with my wife courtesy of a trade with mobz24. Freshness date indicates bottled on 042310. Served in a large Belgian style tulip glass.  A: Clear golden color, lots of bubbles rising up from the bottom, good sized creamy white head with some lacing.  S: Wonderful piney and pineapple aroma truly makes this beer.  T: A bit average bready cracker-like taste up front that turns into more of a citrus flavor. The beer wows you at the end with a burst of intense hoppiness in the finish. Somewhat piney and grapefruity, the taste lingers in the mouth for a long time.  M: Very nicely carbonated and medium bodied.  D: Very smooth and refreshing -- 8% ABV is well hidden.

Nose is somewhat floral with honeysuckle, pine aroma, caramel malt, grapefruit hops. The flavors are very clean and balanced. There is nice grapefruit, pine resin, caramel malt, and a bitter hops finish. The palate is nearly perfect. Just enough coating with medium carbonation and a long, but very pleasant bitter finish. Overall, this is an excellent IIPA.

863,7971,honestdave,4.82,"Received this one in a trade with Gabriel. Thanks again! Bottled on date of 4/05/10. Pretty fresh stuff!  A: Pours a hazy golden hue with a very nice, fluffy, egg white consistency head. Lighter appearance than what I would have expected from a DIPA.  S: Really piney and citrusy nose. Smells as fresh and hoppy as DIPA's get. Can't wait to taste!  T: Grapefruit skin. Intense bitterness. Bright hoppy zinger! Much more hop forward and less malty than many of the other DIPA's that I have enjoyed. As I drain this bottle...I'm already wishing for more.  M: Refreshing, dry, lighter than I would expect for something as flavorful as this.  D: Easy to drink and easy to enjoy every last ounce. Wish I had more. Wish I could drink several on tap. Maybe Russian River can send me a plane ticket and bring me to CA so I can indulge?  Summary: Deservedly at the top of every WANT list. Has the hop bitterness that can be enjoyed again and again...assuming you have the resources to trade or fly to sunny CA!

863,7971,pastradul,4.87,"i have had Pliny before on draft...and I never really was impressed by it all that much. So I decided I wanted to try it out of a fresh bottle.  Had on 5-7-10, the bottle was brewed on 4-25-10. Doesn't get all that fresher!  Poured a bright yellow with a nice white head on it.  I can smell the pine and hops from about 2 feet away!  The taste is amazing. Crisp pine and citrus with an amazing hop bite at the end. A nice bitter taste left on the mouth.  i am sold, fresh pliny from the bottle is no joke!",Russian River Brewing Company,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,100
863,7971,DrDoitchbig,4.92,"It's finally time for me to sample my first bottle of Pliny. Bottled 4/23, thanks to a very generous trader!  Appearance: Poured a few shades darker than honey, with glimpses of orange and red. The head was off-white and looked quite creamy. It started out at around two fingers, it dissipated within a few minutes there was enough left for some generous lacing to be had. It seems to share the odd quality of it's little brother Blind Pig. Both of them just seem to glow in the right lighting.  Smell: Wow. This is just phenomenal. It's just so lush, juicy and fruity. Tropical fruits come to mind, mango and pineapple specifically. There's also a big kick of grapefruit. Some flowery pine hangs around in the background. If I said I was picking up any malt here, I'd be lying. My novice nose can't get past the wondrous hop explosion.  Taste: Every damn bit as good as the aroma. It might be even stronger. All the tropical fruits are here and I do believe they are even bigger than the smell. The grapefruit is huge and nearly as strong as the tropical fruit punch orgy. I said it before a moment ago, but really I just can't get over how juicy this is. Past that there is some subdued pine along with some grassy tones. I can pick up on the malts in the taste, they're far in the background providing a bit of sweetness. But I can't quite compare them to anything specific.  Mouthfeel: The body is perfect for the style. The carbonation is just right where I want it to be, it's got a nice crisp finish. Awesome creaminess with a bit of slick, resinous jag in there also.  Drinkability: I could drink pints of this stuff until I can't see straight. This is exactly the kind of DIPA that I seek out. I love the tropical and grapefruit vibes and this has them in droves. It's not a palate wrecker either. Just delicious and refreshing.  Overall I do believe I've found my new favorite DIPA. I can't even imagine what it would be like to be able to stroll into my local beer shop and find this on the shelves. If I could do that I'd certainly pick up a couple bottles on every trip. I'm always skeptical about these hyped beers, but this one has earned every bit of it's spot in the Top 10.",Russian River Brewing Company,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,100
863,7971,nelnutter,5,"Poured 16.9 oz. bottle into snifter. Bottled on 4/23/10.  A: Pours a golden/copper, very slight haze, with a good 3/4"" white head of foam that dissipates pretty quickly and leaves nice sticky lace patches.  S: Grapefruit, pine, fresh cut grass, and pineapple. Very inviting!  T: Citrusy grapefruit and orange, pine, resiny hops all coat the tongue nicely. But man this is well-balanced as there is some nice biscuit malt somehow standing up to the onslaught of hop bitterness. Almost zero detection of the alcohol. Very long, bitter, dry finish. Absolutely delicious.  M: Medium-bodied and perfectly carbonated.  D: This is easily the most drinkable DIPA I've ever had. So refreshing and tasty and I only wish it were easier to find out here on the East coast!  This was the first PTE I've ever tried, and it lived up to everything that I'd heard about it! Gotta thank my friend Adam in Cali for sending a couple my way for my birthday!",Russian River Brewing Company,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,100
863,7971,hoppyhampy,5,"This may be my favorite beer of all time. I first had it at a brewfest years ago and nothing has really ever compared. I found a liquor store right down the street that carries the 16.9oz bottles and I couldn't be more excited. Russian River's distributors do a wonderful job of ensuring the freshest possible product makes it to their customers and in the case of Pliny the Elder is makes a world of difference. This bottle is dated at 4/5/10 and was poured into a tulip glass. The color is a cloudy golden amber, reminiscent of a Belgian tripel. A rich foamy head arises and it retained with fine lacing. The smell is gloriously fresh and floral hops with enough of a citrus-like honey sweetness to again remind me somewhat of a tripel. The wonderfully bitter hops on the palate are balanced with an interestingly subtle malt that gives the taste an orange peel quality to it. The fresh and resiny hops linger through the finish so much so that its almost like I've been chewing on a mouthful of them. The carbonation is spot on, giving it exceptional mouthfeel and allowing the full and glorious flavor of the beer to be spread broadly across the palate. Everything combines to make this a beer that beckons to be sipped deeply and savored. I really tried to think of a way this beer might be made better and the only thing I could come up with was if it was on tap fresh at the brewery. I may be somewhat biased because this is my favorite style but I have had enough regular and imperial IPAs to say this one clearly trumps them all.",Russian River Brewing Company,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,100
863,7971,thetomG,4.22,"Allright... FINALLY reviewing this one... sipping on a pour from a 4 day old growler hooked up from my new buddy baker (wavers1) out inn Cali (thanks again dude!!!)  Pours a very clear and light golden color with a nice small fluffy white head. The smell is VERY nice - slight sweetness with some pine and a hint of citrus. the flavor matches the aroma nicely, but finishes with a very solid amount of bitterness. Not TOO bitter mind you, but juuuust the right amount - very well balanced with none of the flavors overpowering the others.  This is an incredibly drinkable & tasty beer, but my own personal preference leans more towards DIPAs like Surly Abrasive and Bells Hopslam. Not trying to knock this one at all, but the fruity & sweet aspects of those two definitely float my boat a bit more.  Nonetheless, this is undoubtedly an EXCELLENT beer and something I would definitely drink again.",Russian River Brewing Company,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,100
863,7971,klikger,4.48,"Bottle dated 3.26.10 poured into a standard pint glass  A - Orange-yellow in color, quite cloudy. A massive white foam transforms into exquisite lacing as the beer is consumed.  S - Fresh, piny, citrusy hops. It's been months since I've had a semi-fresh Pliny...smelling this is torture!  T - Hop heaven - floral/summer fruit, piny, and grapefruit flavors are plentiful. As it warms slightly, I can taste a bit of honey, but it's still no less than brilliantly bitter in the same moment. Oddly, the hop assault increases in magnitude as the minutes go by. Over the half hour or so that it takes me to start and finish the bottle, I feel like I'm drinking nectar of Fruit Loops - this has the aura of lemon zest, zings the sides of my mouth like sour cherries and raspberries, and although the tart lime is overpowering, I still get hints of orange every now and then. The final 3 oz. pour is crazy funky with yeasty sediment. This may have been my favorite part.  M - Light and bright for an IPA of this caliber. Spot-on amount of carbonation.  D - This is refreshingly easy to drink given the abundance of hops, the 8% abv, and the complexity. Profoundly bitter yet nicely balanced at once.  I'm going through withdrawal already, and I just finished my lone Pliny (luckily, I'll be in Santa Rosa in two months...light at the end of the tunnel). Wisconsin is a beer drinker's paradise, but I sincerely wish I could buy this on a regular basis.

Grapefruit, and spicy pine. Also a good malt aroma.  T- Exceptional taste. First came the hops with lots of grapefruit, spice, pine, and tropical fruit. Mango flavor sticks out. Incredibly balanced with a good sweet malt taste.  M- oil, medium carbonation. nice medium body.  D- Supremely drinkable beer. every aspect of the taste is balanced.

Some grassy notes.  T: Very fresh and very green, but not in a too-ripe kind of way. Hop forward without being to top-heavy and very large citrus flavours throughout.  M: Neutral, but nice. Balanced with no fringes or defining characteristics, making it very well rounded.  D: High drinkability for a stronger ipa. It's fresh, clean, and quite refreshing.

Pours like no other.  Smell/Taste: Smell is like walking into a thick pine forest after a heavy rain... Sappy and fresh. Hops attacks your palate from the beginning with a smoothe creamy malt sweetness at the end.  Mouthfeel: Pure joy with this one, like PTY, a little heavier but very smoothe. Mild cabonation helps hops intensity just explode and dissipate intense flavor.  I am sure glad this brew is available every time beacause I cannot be without it... Stock up.

863,7971,sitarist,4.77,"Pours a hazy, honey, golden, amber color. It glows in my 420 Hop-fest pint glass. There is a fat, fluffy head that falls to about 1/4"" with lots of thick loose lacing. Smells like powdered sugar and candied oranges. This really isn't that complex, but it is almost perfectly balanced! Might I say; a orange dream cycle or orange scone from Panera? There are faint hints of pine but the sweet citrus rules this treat. Flowery kindness; earthy and Funky it begs to be tasted! The candied orange-orange dream cycle thing dominate the flavors as well, but there are hints of tropical fruit, apricot, and black pepper. Hail the cannabaceae family! Medium body, it realy sticks to the palate, coats the mouth nicely.  Danger Will Robinson!!! This beer is highly drinkable; it may impair you ability to think straight! This beer is a treat to ones senses! Two of these big bottles is enough though. This beer does to my taste-buds, as the Cowboy Junkies do to my ears.

863,7971,chicano4craft,4.75,"Poured into a tulip. A great orange and slight copper color. An easy two fingers of fluffy head. An awesome appearance.  The nose has citrus, grapefruit, and fresh cut grass. The malt lends a slight sweetness. It's like sugar sprinkled on orange slices. The aroma sticks around for the entire session.  Taste is amazing. There's alot going on, but it's always in balance. The hops are first with a blast of citrus. Not overly bitter at all. The malt is right there to lend a bitter sweet finish.  Pliny is easily the smoothest Imperial IPA I've ever had. But that doesn't mean it lacks any flavor. The balance leads to dangerous drinkability.  This is the freshest Pliny I've had. Bottled about three weeks ago. This is one of those beer that lives up to the hype. You almost expect the hops to be right in your face.

It pours golden copper with a thick and lasting white head  The smell is like most other good IPAs. Lots of earthy hoppiness with hit of some sweetness.  The mouth feel of this blew me away. I could literally let this bad boy sit in my mouth forever. Not a lot of carbonation to this one which i feel makes this even better beer.Just like the smell i get a taste of earthy hoppiness with a smooth sweet finish.

A nice coppery gold color, tiny bit hazy, and a nice fluffy white head that coated the glass as I took drinks.  I wish they had Pliny the Edler air fresheners available, as both my cars would have them! Perfect balance of citrus and pine hops. I think the citrus stands out more but definitely room for both.  It tastes so... balanced. Nothing jumps out as being overbearing or off balanced. You catch some citrus, some pineyness, some malt, some sweetness up front with a bitterness at the end. I cannot tell that this beer has been shipped across the country and exposed to unknown temperatures for sure! I definitely trust this beer is any.  Mouthfeel was pretty standard of a good IPA. A tingle from the alcohol and a bitter coating on the tongue.  The drinkability for me is great because it didnt leave me wanting another.

A - Pours a golden copper with a 1.5 finger head of pure white foam. Head dissipates, but sticks around with delicate lacing on the side of the glass.  S - Smells like a pine tree growing in an orange grove. Tart, slightly sour, but very inviting aroma.  T - Pineapple, grapefruit, and fresh hops dominate, with very little malt balance. However, the brashly hop-forward profile is ridiculously refreshing and remains so as the beer warms. There is a burst of citrus fruits at the front of each sip that is absolutely delightful. The finish has just enough burn to remind you that this is a 8% beer.  M - Medium body, very crisp. Near-perfect levels of carbonation keep this a compelling drink. I finished it faster than I thought I would.  D - It's compelling, but not undeniably so. The persistent hops-bitterness gets a little overwhelming by the end. Overall though, a great-drinking DIPA.  Worth the hype? Since I'm more of a stout guy, I may not be the best person to ask, but I'd put this in the same league as Ruination, my current favorite DIPA.

The hops are good but not strong, the malts are soft yet have enough body to hold the beer together.  M: The feel is good but almost any double India is going to have good mouthfeel.

T: Light malt with grapefruit and floral hop flavor. A lot more bitter than what I was expecting. The taste is good, but the didn't live up to what I was expecting based upon the smell.  M: Medium in body, with a good decent amount of carbonation.  D: Top notch DIPA. It will definitely remain on my wants list so that I can hopefully score some more.",Russian River Brewing Company,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,100
863,7971,scottfrie,4.77,"500ml bottle into Gulden Draak tulip.  A: Pours a cloudy honey-citrus color with a large tan head that slowly reduced into a thin film that left thick chunky sticky lacing all the way down the glass. S: Very sweet fruity and floral hops with some notes of pine and fresh cut grass. I pick up passion fruit, pineapple, and tangerine peel as well. T: Huge spicy hop bite destroys the palate and leaves you wanting more. Tons of pine, fruit and spice. M: Alcohol is hidden well. It is only barely noticeable in the finish. Bitterness lingers on after you swallow and the finish is dry. Carbonation melts in your mouth. D: Definitely one of my favorite DIPA's and beers in general. Everyone should try this beer to know what a great DIPA tastes like. I may not pick it up every time I see it, but it is a great brew to have on any occasion. Definitely lives up to the hype.",Russian River Brewing Company,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,100
863,7971,regspeir,4.97,"bottle into Duvel tulip I have had this beer several times on-tap and I am anxious to see how the bottle version compares. A ""Bottled on"" date was the month before. Pours lemony orange with a 3-inch white head which settles . Lacing is elegant and lasting. Nose is pine, orange and grapefruit. Taste though, my goodness... so refreshing, so balanced. First the citrus and some bitterness hits you, but it quickly gives way to malt biscuity sweetness. The carbonation is perfect, influencing the appearance and the mouthfeel. I can't add much to the hundreds of reviews found here. This is just a GREAT beer, period.",Russian River Brewing Company,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,100
863,7971,weatherdog,4.53,"500mL bottle poured into a Duvel tulip, bottle dated 020810 and drank with a little under two months of age  It pours slight hazy bright tangerine. A billowing off white pillowy textured three fingered head come alive during the pour and dies down to an almost permanent one fingered cap. A minimal amount of lacing coast the sides of the glass as the liquid level lowers.  The first thing that hits me is a very realistic orange aroma, it's very juicy. There is also a complimenting piny smell but it takes a backseat to the orange for me. While the smell is good it doesn't blow me away like the highest rated available DIPA should.  The taste is unsurprisingly all hop and no malt. I'm picking up much less orange type fruit and much more florals with distinct grassy taste at the end. The flavor itself is really a complex play of hop flavors, more than I've experienced before. The bitterness in this beer is what is truly sets it apart from others in my opinion; it's fully present but it's so smooth. The problem I have with a lot of DIPA's is a harsh and lasting bitterness (Ruination I'm looking at you). This beer had none of that and didn't even leave any type of lasting bitter aftertaste. A truly impressive flavor.  The mouthfeel was nice and dry as I like it but had a too much carbonation for me, even with my Duvel tulip releasing a constant stream of bubbles. This also is probably tied with Hopslam as the easiest drinking DIPA I've encountered.  I was really glad to finally try this raved about beer. I really try hard not to let preconceptions or hype sway my opinions. I also am not a biggest fan of DIPA's and my ratings can reflect that. This beer really did blow me away and I could really fall in love with the style if more beers were similar to this although I have a feeling many brewers are already trying to emulate Vinnie's creations.",Russian River Brewing Company,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,100

A: Great looking, foamy head, big bubbles, popping to the surface as it dissipated, it looked like sea foam to me.  S: pine needles, once you've held freshly stripped white pine needles in your hand you've held the hops aroma of this beer. It had hints of beer and citrus in there.  T: Great, but I've had better IPA for sure, Hopslam fresh, Double Crooked Tree, Tossing some love out for my home state brews here.  M: Like a beer should feel  D: This beer was actually refreshing.

A: Hazy golden yellow amber, it poured with a good white head that died slowly to a good film. S: Not as extreme as I remember (I had this one at the brewpub a year back), but it has very earthy noble hops that come off as grassy. There is some tart, bitter fruit, like blackberries, behind apple muffins and apricots. T: Earthy, almost like a Belgian IPA or Golden Ale, with biting earthy raspberries and blackberries lingering on the finish behind an apple muffin sensation. The hops are billowing and resiny, slightly tart and dry, and grassy on the finish. M: Mildly syrupy, spritzy and slightly frothy. It has a dry, clean finish that's almost astringent. D: Good, but I wouldn't want to have more than a couple pints.  After having the beer again, I adjusted ""Drinkability"" 4.0 to ""Overall"" 3.0.

Starts out with citrus hop tastes with some biscuity, bready malts trying to come through. Transitions smoothly to floral hop bitterness in the long finish.  M - Medium body, medium carbonation. Perfectly creamy smoothness across the palate. Thick, resinous pine hop oils thickly coat the inside of my mouth through the finish.

863,7971,livewire78,4.7,Huge thanks to route66pubs for this one!!  Poured a beautiful peach colored cloudy yellow orange hue. Almost perfect. Lacing develops into almost complete coverage of the glass by the end.  Smells of citrus and pine at the same time. How they did that I don't know. Pungent and soothing simultaneously. Incredible.  Still nothing prepares you for the taste. Near sensory overload of sweet citrusy grapefruity piney goodness. Smooth isn't even the word. Nice drawn out and crisp finish. Near perfection.  Mouthfeel is light and refreshing. Exactly where you'd want it to be in a brew this caliber. Amazing.  The 8% is super well hidden. You'd want to drink this instead of water if you had the choice.  This is an amazing beer. It lives up to and surpasses the hype by a long shot. Are you kidding me? I almost feel guilty for not having this on a special occasion. Damn near flawless!,Russian River Brewing Company,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,100
863,7971,Wantbeer,4.95,"Pours an amber color with a medium head that falls slowly and leaves plenty of lacing on the glass. The aroma is WOW. Hops then some hops. But there is an underlying sweetness that has a caramel character. Smells very nice. The flavor is surprisingly balanced. Lots of hop flavors, but also there is plenty of malt sweetness and caramel flavor. I'm the opposite of a hop head, but this beer tastes great to me. The flavor hops aren't over the top like most I2PA's. It just blends and adds the bitterness at the end. Very nice beer. The body is moderate and the drinkability is great for 8%.",Russian River Brewing Company,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,100
863,7971,VWBuggirl,4.62,"This is a nice straw yellow with a small head and lots of lacing. The scent is very hoppy right off the bat, then you get a great floral scent that has a slightly sweat citrus smell, like a ripe tangerine.  As for the flavor, wow! Hops come out right away and quite strongly as anticipated. You definitely get that floral taste at the end and it is very earthy and enjoyable. I don't get much of the citrus that I smelled, but it isn't necessary.  This is decently carbonated and nice and dry. This all goes to making it very drinkable. More so than most.

863,7971,largadeer,4.68,"I've had this beer roughly a billion times now, and its aromas and flavors are pretty much ingrained in my psyche at this point. 500ml bottle with a ""bottled on"" date of 04/05/10 poured into a tall mug, this is much hazier than any draft pour of Elder I've had. It's peach-colored, moderately cloudy and topped by an exceptionally frothy cap that not only sustains well but leaves thick rings of lace around the glass.  The aroma is rich with pine, grapefruit and orange along with a bit of tropical fruit, predominantly pineapple. There's nary a hint of sweetness and any hint of malt is obliterated by the hop assault. Maybe it's because I've consumed so much of this beer over the years, and maybe it's because I'm a drunken hobo, but there's something comforting about the aroma.  Taste mirrors aroma with this one: citrusy, tropical fruit hits the taste buds first - pineapple, orange, grapefruit - followed by a smack of pine (this stuff almost tastes ""green""). There's very faint malt presence, biscuit-like, and a bitterness so perfectly balanced with the flavoring hops that it goes almost unnoticed until the glass is half empty. The mouthfeel is arguably where this beer excels the most; it's so light, so crisp and dry, it could easily be mistaken for a beer with far more modest alcohol content.  Drinkability is...well...my pint is almost gone, and it seems like I just poured it a moment ago. It's a beer difficult to savor.  Hyperbole aside, the bottles aren't quite as exceptional as the fresh draft pours, though they're still outstanding and priced quite reasonably given the quality.",Russian River Brewing Company,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,100
863,7971,urwithdave,4.3,"Tnx to mrstevens for sharing. Poured into a snifter. This bottle is just a little over 3 weeks old.  A- Pours golden orange in color. A inch of a off white head that sticks around for a bit and comes right back with a little swirl. Nice lacing left.  S- Big piney hops and some citus notes, primarily grapefruit.  T- U guessed it....an explosion of hops in my mouth. The citrus is blended in well. The grapefruit aspect is very distinct. I'm missing the malt profile that I love in most E coast DIPAs. I don't think it's as good as hopslam, but I'm not complaining.  M- Bitterness isn't overpowering and it leaves a nice dry finish.  D- Just about perfect!!! The only knock here is the fact that I prefer a little more ""sweetness"" from my DIPAs. All in all a great beer that I would def drink again.",Russian River Brewing Company,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,100
863,7971,Provocajade,4.82,"1st review- had to be something great.  Bought bottles from Total Wine&More in Rancho Cucamonga, Ca. Poured into oversized tulips.  A- golden in color with a moderate head with fine bubbles.  S- hoppyness is obvious, but had also a light sweet/delicate floral note in the background. It was strong coming out of the bottle/during the pour, but was more subdued when in the glass but still nicely fragrant while sipping.  T- I love that this beer has a ""evolving"" bitterness. The first layer is a bit of a citrusy, green grassy, fresh hoppy bittnerness then leaving on the palette the bitterness becomes a bit more mellow and sweet floral/herbaceous (kinda taste like fresh tree bark/leaves) background and ends almost a bit fruity and honey-ish, with a whisper of a almost tangy bitterness on the back of my palette. Very complex and smooth in transitioning its flavors. I find it a bit hard to explain in a good way.  M- not very heavy on the palette, light in its carbonation, alternated to being almost creamy and then gave a dry finish. This probably was a big aid in its ""evolution"" in its flavor.  D- Drank this twice- once at about 2 weeks old, another time at 6 weeks. The older was very slightly more mellow...a bit less ""green"" in the front end , but not by much- still a bitter beast.  The drinkability for me is exceptional.I get why it has such a reputation- I seriously love this and I came into opening one and thinking I will appreciate it, but did not expect to love it so. I can't quite see myself drink more than one in a sitting, but it is a beer that I will be excited about and enjoy through and through. I ""get"" bitter now and respect how its done in The Elder.  My BF on the other hand, appreciated it, liked it, but did not love it. He feels its something that he wouldn't quite seek it out as its still a aquired taste...not quite the flavor for him when it comes to IPA/DIPA.  Still, its a favorite that definitely will be a common occurrence in my fridge, at least for me. Thank my lucky stars that my mom lives in California.

There is also a subdued fruit essence taste present.  M - Carbonation was somewhat flat but the beer was very smooth and fresh.  D - This is a very, very good beer. I know this is a different style of IPA but I enjoyed this beer much more than Blind Pig. This was a very good companion to my BBQ feast.  I definitely will be going after more of this brew.

S- Piney citrus hops obliterate your nose up front with a faint malt background and a slight tropical fruitiness.  T- Strong hops hit you up front with a sweet solid malt background as a base. This brew is balanced pretty perfectly. You get a serious dominant hop bitterness with a great tropical finish that lasts in the aftertaste.  M- Medium bodied with moderate carbonation and man is this a bitter bomb. Leaves you dry and wanting more.  Great freaking IPA, finally understand all the hype over this beer.

Smell was extremely bitter as soon as the cap was popped. A very distinct hoppy aroma,equivalent to someone just picking the hops from the vine and stuffing them into the bottle.  Taste starts out with a punch of malt to the chops. Immediately replaced by what it makes you think of a sprinkle dusting of hops. A bit of biscuit and sweet malts try to overthrow the hoppiness but is immediately torn down by a spicey stab to the tongue of bitterness.  Mouth is lighter in bodied, absolutely amazing thay it is 8% ABV and so very light and crisp in the mouth.  Drink is absolutely amazing.

863,7971,Pahn,4.97,"500ml bottle into Duvel tulip. Bottled on 3/26/10, so only 20 days old. Big thanks to BA mob2332 for giving this to me!  Appearance: Moderate pour yields a big, 1.5 inch, fluffy, just offwhite head that dissipates steadily leaving spots of lacing. Pours a hazy, light golden amber. Leaves spots and streaks of lacing all around the glass.  Smell: From the bottle there's dank, piny hops. In the glass, the same dank note along with even bigger citrus (grapefruit), floral, grassy hops. There's a lot of sweetness in the smell; lots of tropical fruit, almost melon-y. Smells amazing.  Taste: First sip: a big hit of hop bitterness, characterized by pine and grapefruit, with a dry finish. Not much malt backbone, but huge, resinous hops flavor. Nowhere near as sweet as the aroma suggests. The aftertaste is great; it has more hops complexity than the whole experience of most other IPAs. Halfway through some biscuity malt emerges, but the constant barrage of various delicious hops flavors remains the star. Alcohol is completely hidden.  Mouthfeel: Medium-bodied, alternately creamy and juicy, with a dry finish. Just the right amount of carbonation. The beer fills the mouth, with the mild carbonation, large bitterness, somewhat hefty body, and dry finish all contributing to make the experience huge. I'm noticing more and more that the mouthfeel can really make or break a beer for me, and PtE's is the perfect vehicle for its big hop flavor.  Drinkability: This would *easily* become my go-to (D)IPA if Russian River distributed where I live.  I've started to get mildly self-conscious about the high scores I give beers I like, so I didn't want to throw out all these 5s... but really, the smell, taste, and feel of this beer are just flawless. And ease of consumption? I could easily keep this on hand at all times and make sure to drink all of it fresh.  PtE isn't regarded so highly because it's so difficult to get outside of the west coast. It really is a perfect DIPA.",Russian River Brewing Company,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,100
863,7971,Chico1985,4.23,"Well, here it is. My first Pliny the Elder, at 7 a.m., after work. Bottle date is 3-26-10, 20 days old. Pours a bright, fuzzy orange with great rocky, fluffy white head. Looks just like the Blind Pig from yesterday, although the head on Pliny retains better and leaves some more lacing. Very little sediment. Smell is lots of pine and earthy notes. Citrus hides in the background. Taste is the same, pine and earth and lots of it. Dry hops. A bit of a biscuity feel, I don't really pick up any fruit flavors at the start but towards the middle I start to pick up citrus, grapefruit, and lemon. Nice hop burps. The balance here is seriously excellent though, and the mouthfeel is probably the best I have encountered in an IPA, period. Truly a creamy elixir, perfect carbonation. Alcohol taste is nowhere to be found, I would never guess this is 8%. Drinkability is also pretty great because of this. Truthfully I am a little let down, the taste isn't quite what I expected, I actually preferred Blind Pig to this for sure. But the mouthfeel, overall balance of malt+hops, drinkability, and the masking of alcohol are huge highlights, and it succeeds maybe better than any other DIPA I've had in all those categories.",Russian River Brewing Company,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,100

The classy, simple bottle sitting next to this tulip filled with a hazy golden orange ale is a truly nice sight. 3 fingers of soft white, meringue-like head forms a perfect cap to a great looking beer. The head sticks around for a long time and leaves good lacing down the glass...  Beautiful aromatic hops in the nose. Piny and earthy, resinous. With a couple more whiffs I start to notice a plethora of citrus fruit hop aromas, grapefruit really sticks out...  Sweet, but dry and bitter at the same time. Earthy, pine, dry hop tastes and feel. This gives way to some undertones of tropical fruits, not as citric on the tongue as it was on the nose. This beer leans more towards to floral, piny dry hops with a bit of an oily, resinous flavor...  Medium bodied, somewhat chewy, oily and sticky. Carbonation is there but doesn't really dance on your tongue, somewhat slick, maybe a bit too slick, but still a substantial, pleasant mouthfeel...  Very happy with this beer.

863,7971,Reaper16,4.82,"Served on-tap @ Falling Rock Taphouse, Denver, CO, into a pint glass  Pours a light and golden shade of honey yellow. Maybe its the pint glass, but the lacing was unimpressive compared to how the bottled PtE pours. Still, this was a prototypical DIPA in appearance. I can't fault it for being the color that it is with the fluffy white head that it has.  The immediacy of the aroma is quite impressive. Oily resins -- the pure distillation of the hop flower -- tingle your nosehairs. This smells like pollan and earth and vines and petals and medicinal secretions and astringent roots and maybe a little bit of gauze or band-aid. All at once. This is served into a pint glass and perhaps that is subduing the aroma... because bottles versions tend to be a wee bit more intense. Still, this is lovely.  ""Oh, fuck me!"" Pardon the coarse language but that is exactly what I uttered after my first gulp of this wonderful stuff. Its just so exquisitely intense in its hoppiness. Leafy, floral flavors smack you on the tongue with all of the strength of eating a garden. As you swirl the beer around in your mouth, the fruity lupulin flavors develop. Grapefruit and, unmistakeably, passionfruit coat the tongue. They aren't just passing mentions; they are deep and resonating with juiciness. With fruit throbbing on your palate, the pine-dominated finish spreads like a pandemic all over your mouth. The aftertaste is surprisingly low-key. Its bitter, sure, and pleasantly so but it isn't harsh. As the beer warms, you can appreciate some of the toasty and caramel malt flavors but let's be real with it -- they are an afterthought, exactly where they are supposed to be. This beer features all aspects of the HOP like few other beers. This might be the very Platonic form of the hop flower.  I generally prefer single IPAs to doubles because I prefer the thinner, juicier mouthfeel that singles feature. The thickness of the doubled malt bill is, while not exactly a put-off, less pleasurable for my tastes. Pliny the Elder, like no other good double/imperial IPA that I've ever had, is like a single IPA in mouthfeel. Its perfect for my preferences and perfect for carrying home the essential hop flavors. As far as drinkability goes, well, I drank three pints of PtE tonight. This is brilliant and oh, so tasty.  Pliny on-tap was, without a shadow of a doubt, the best beer on-tap that I've ever had. I don't see how any beer could better express the flavors of the hop flower. Perfection in taste.",Russian River Brewing Company,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,100

Pliny's nose is strong; lots of citrus up front with a good hint of orange rind and a toasted undertone. The hops, of course, also make their presence known. The hops dominate on the palate, too, but not at all in an off-balancing way. The citrus and malt sweep in to clean up the mid-palate and prevent the beer from being overwhelmed, but the bitterness hangs in there for a long, delicious finish.

Citrus hops are balanced with the piney hops perfectly. I like my DIPA's citrusy and this one does not disappoint. I'm really impressed with the bitterness the pine flavors bring without dominating the beer. I'm sure there is malt in here but I honestly can't pick out any specific flavors!

863,7971,hckyfn9999,4.85,"Pours a hazy golden orange color with a soapy white head. The head leaves sheets of lace as it slowly disappears. Aroma is of full of citrus. Taste is more of the same, citrusy hop overload. Lots of fresh grapefruit and orange flavor along with some pine. Plenty of bitterness. A great beer. One of the best Ive had. After having a couple of Blind Pigs and PTE's, I think the PTE is just a notch above the Blind Pig, but both are beers by Russian River.",Russian River Brewing Company,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,100
863,7971,thisisxxmyIPA,4.67,"A- Golden straw color. Thin bright white head with beautiful lacing.  S- Amazing hop profile. Citrus, bitter grapefruit, pale malt, sugary sweetness, alcohol. Extreme hop aroma is perfectly balanced with sweet malt aromas  T- Sharp hop bite on the front, pale malts in the middle, and finishing with one of the more intensely fresh bitter hop bites that I have ever experienced. Grapefruit tastes last throughout and the fresh taste of the hops is impressive. I'm glad I got this fresh as RR recommends. (It's only two weeks old). Just a bit of sweetness to round it out, though a bit more malt backbone would have been welcome. Warming alcohol makes Adam's chest feel NICE.  M- Mouthfeel is just full enough to keep this from being hop water, medium carbonation.  D- For as bitter as this is, it's incredibly drinkable. Almost laughably drinkable.

863,7971,Bulkman,4.5,"This one was bottled on 1/14/10. Obtained this 500 ml bottle from raoulduke37 (Art) in our trade. Thanks Art!  Poured into my Tilburg footed stick glass with an active, 3 finger head from a semi-aggressive pour. As the head gradually recedes, it leaves behind abundant lacing that sticks to the glass & does not fall, even as I finish the last of the beer about 35 min. later. It is a brilliant light amber color, with excellent clarity.  The aroma is a great meld of citrus & piney hops. Since the hops dominate, malt is not noticed, but that is in no way a negative with this beer. Amazing.  Taste is as you might expect from the aroma, but the malt does make it's presence known here. Moderate malt backbone contributes to the medium-bodied mouthfeel that also delivers with perfectly balanced hop bitterness, followed by a crisp, tangy finish.  Drinkability is exceptionally high, and I easily finished this bottle by myself in just over 1/2 hr., even with the time spent typing this review.  I have eagerly anticipated trying this brew for a long time, and it was everything I expected. It takes the hype on & scores a knockout, which is why I gave it 4.5 across the board. Bring on PtY!",Russian River Brewing Company,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,100
863,7971,Lazerlobe,4.87,"Got this from South Bay Drugs online. Thanks Geoi. Bottled 3/21/10.  A: 2 fingers of eggshell head crown this ruby-orange brew. Thick lacing left behind as this recedes.  S: First whiff made me squint to avoid getting some of that grapefruit in my eye. I can't believe how potent this is. The Pavlovian trigger made me begin to salivate. There is definitely the expected tangerine and pineapple players on the field too. This is a sweet smelling beer, rapidly approaching nectar. Underneath the citrus I get some light malt sweetness but I actually don't care too much about the smell anymore, I need to taste!  T: Some piney bitterness is mixed in this fruit-punch but quickly is overpowered by the puckering citrus. The grapefruit is present in flavor too, as well as unsweetened lemonade, baby tangerine and some other fruits that morph too quickly to catch. The pine resin leaves a thin coat over the palate too but it is not as bitter as others. Some sweet light malts attempt to balance the hops but it's like a toddler and the circus fat lady on a see-saw. Still, this ratio is ideal.  M: Medium carbonation and a moderately and surprising light body make this a sipper that I am using rapidly fading self restraint not to gulp.  D: Yes. Drink=All the time. My first thought was ""Curse you west coast, and all that get steady shipments of fresh PtE."" That was over 10 minutes ago and I still feel the same way.  The hype is warranted and I will try to work this in to my trading rotation. This is what I want my IIPAs to taste like.",Russian River Brewing Company,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,100
863,7971,twiggamortis420,4.32,"500 mL courtesy of my dad, who brought this back from a recent trip to Colorado - mad props for this one dad! Bottled on 020810. Pours a not-quite-clear golden color with a fluffy, off-white foam. Average retention and good lacing.  Smells fantabulous, hop juice galore. Grapefruit, sweet/sour candies and some grainy malts. Fresh, clean and delicious smelling beer. I like how the malts are kept very light and do not hinder what is important here....the cones!  Taste is grapefruit and citrus hoppiness with very little malt backbone, which is how I like my DIPAs...really lets the hops shine bright. Has a ton of hop flavor and a high, but tolerable, amount of bitterness. Lingers on the palate for quite some time. Has a smooth, ganja-esque taste that is pretty nice. If I lived in the Pac-NW, I would treat myself to a PtE once in a while and I rarely find myself repeat purchasing DIPAs. This beer has a very tough task of living up to the mega hype that surrounds it, for the most part it does a good job but I cant say I will go too far out of my way to get this again.",Russian River Brewing Company,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,100
863,7971,cavedave,4.82,"Thanks to knucks999 for this work of art.  Forget the LATMD format, this beer is in a class of its own, gonna give a review in a style Pliny inspires in me.  The pour is not a lot to write home about, cloudy gold, a bit of head fading to a cap then islands, some oily lace. The smell is merely the confirmation of what that oily look foretells, that there are a massive assortment of unmuzzled attack hops in this baby.  Here's my review- The first sip was like a fireworks lover seeing the aurora borealis. I do my beer worshipping at the altar of hops and here was the shrine at last. This beer is a masterpiece of brewing. Forget careful dissection of attributes, and comparisons to other beers. The pure citrus blast of the sip propels my palate through an orgasm of extreme hop florality, sweet pine, and an intense, clean, afterburner of citrus and pine bitter upon sweet that never quite appears but is always there. The range of citrus keeps f***ing with me, always deliciously surpassing the previous rendition as it warms, and the pine positively explodes, in the mouth it's perfection for the style, doubt this can be surpassed, beyond clean, beyond easy drinking, this is nirvana, I am going to cry when this bottle is finished.

863,7971,emmasdad,4.24,"Pours from the bottle a beautiful golden color, with a rocky white head that quickly settles down. Smells incredible, with all kinds of hoppy goodness going on, especially citrus (orange, grapefruit, tangelo) and pine. A nice malt foundation does a great job of supporting the wonderfully fresh hop flavors here, especially all that citrus, along with a bit of pineapple. Dangerously drinkable, as the alcohol is not noticed until it is too light. A truly great IPA/IIPA. Too many inconsistent bottles lately.",Russian River Brewing Company,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,100
863,7971,wedge421,4.37,A - Light Orange with a bright white head of about 2 fingers. Small amounts of lacing are present. There is the ever present hop haze from the all the hops in this beer.  S - Amazing hop aroma as soon as the bottle is opened! Bouquet of citrus and floral notes. As the beer warms a bit I am getting sweeter notes mixed in with piny flavors. Just amazing aroma on this one!  T - Very similar to the aroma. Very bitter at the front of the mouth with a mixture of peach and grapefruit notes. As it hits the back of your mouth all of the sweet malt backbone is present. A very well balanced beer!  M - Great malt backbone makes this one have the perfect mouthfeel mixed with the cleansing ability of the hops.  D - Uhhh yes please! This beer is 8% and that can really sneak up on you!,Russian River Brewing Company,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,100
863,7971,papat444,4.15,"Big thanks to jzeilinger for this treat. Enjoyed while watching Beer Wars.  Poured from a 500ml. bottle, bottled Jan. 6, 2010.  Appearance: Huge frothing white head (2-3 fingers easy) with a liquid gold body and lots of active carbonation. Slightly hazy and looks quite nice.  Smell: Wonderful aroma of tropical fruit, tangerine (orange maybe?) and melon. More sweet than bitter comes through. Juicy and fresh (even if it's 3 months old).  Taste: Good hop bite right off the bat. Some nice fruit-like bitterness. I get some grapefruit which is weird because it didn't come through in the aroma. Lots of fresh fruit but most prominent for me is melon with a touch of citrus. Solid malt backbone that eventually takes over the bitterness. You can tell the hops are on the decline but it is still quite tasteful.  Mouthfeel: Creamy with a full body and average carbonation. Quite pleasant in the palate. Feels right at home.  Drinkability: Better than i would have thought though i still had to pace myself. Which i could get this more easily.  Overall: Very gracious of Jeff to get me something i probably won't have again. This must be killer when fresh off the line. Seek it out for sure.",Russian River Brewing Company,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,100
863,7971,Adoxander,4.92,"Poured from a bottle into a large snifter. Beautiful golden hue with a touch of amber. Thick, foamy head that lasts for a decent amount of time, excellent lacing. A bit of a thick, chewy mouthfeel dominated by a floral bouquet of lemon and citrus flavors, with undertones of an earthy pine flavor. A bit more of the earth tones come through in the aftertaste, I get a hint of ginger as well. Definitely a top notch IPA.",Russian River Brewing Company,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,100
863,7971,crnipeter,4.59,"Bottling date: 1. February 2010 so let's open the bottle before the hops start to deteriorate. The beer pours slightly hazed liquid-gold with orange to light coppery hue. Head quickly dissipates to a stable bubbly coating. Aromas are rich and refreshing, like a night walk on the Mediterranean beach with an air filled by wind-carried scents of citruses (predominantly grapefruit), pines and cypresses, resin of coniferous trees and elder blossom. Besides citrusy hop character, another kind of fruitiness derived from either hops or fruity esters is evident and clean malty sweetness penetrates through the thick sheets of aromas. Excellent. Flavors showing less diversity then the nose suggested are of grapefruit and coniferous resins; semi-dry finish with lingering unharsh bitterness. The light-medium body is delicately carbonated. Finally, but not least important the eruption of finest hop qualities was crowned by nearly complete absence of perceivable alcohol.",Russian River Brewing Company,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,100
863,7971,Clydesdale,4.5,"A: Pours a slightly hazy golden orange color. The tall, fluffy head has a similar tint and very good retention. Lacing is also quite nice.  S: Some mild honeyish maltiness. Fruity citric hops are quite vibrant - bitter orange pith and grapefruit. A bit piney and tropical as well, with hints of alcohol.  T: An even malt backbone provides some mild sweetness up front, with a bit of honey and biscuit flavor. Hops obviously get the lead billing, and they don't disappoint. Grapefruit rind, orange pith, pine resin, and some pineappley fruitiness are prominent before fading into a bracing, crashing bitterness in the finish. Some alcoholic heat is noticeable for sure.  M: Fairly full-bodied. An oily, resiny mouthfeel, with gentle, well-balanced carbonation. The finish is warmly alcoholic and extremely dry due to the hoppiness.  D: I was excited to spot this here in San Francisco, so I picked up a bottle without a second thought. An excellent Double IPA that is bursting with fruity, bitter hop flavor.

Had it on tap at The Eastside Club in Olympia, WA. It poured a beautiful golden orange color with a dense solid white head. Absolutely gorgeous...  Smell was tropical fruit all the way, mostly pineapple. With a slight piney hop note towards the end.  Taste was really good. Not as bitter as i was expecting. Dry and smooth but all the flavors were there. It really reminded me of Blue Dot only stronger and better.  Mouth feel was exceptional. Just the right amount of oily hops with a dry and refreshing finish.  Drinkability was also exceptional. I could easily drink this all night long or until i fell down, whichever comes first.

The citrus has splashes of orange rind and pineapple. The aftertaste has a light minty kick that quickly fades into sharp bitterness.  Mouthfeel is lightly carbonated and fresh.

The smell featured a sweet juicy orange hop with a light pale malt.  The taste consisted of a balmy citrus hop and a moderate round malt. Good residual spice.  The mouthfeel was typical of the style.  Overall a full bodied DIPA. Certainly above average.,Russian River Brewing Company,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,100
863,7971,HitokiriNate85,4.8,"Thanks to Arbitrator for hooking me up!  A - Hazy orange and golden. Thick, off-white cap provided by a steady stream of very small bubbles. It's cloudy, but the particles are very fine and give a much nicer look than chunky yeast would have.  My second pour is what really pushed this up, as it created an unreal amount of lacing and rocky insanity.  S - This is my second bottle in two days and it honestly has jumped right up there with the best smelling IPAs for me. Big citrus notes with just a small amount of pine. Where things get interesting is that this is one of the few IPAs that is definitely 'catty,' as some people like to call it. There's also a great dankness to it, which I love in IPAs.  T - Follows the nose practically to a tee, except that behind all of the amazing hop flavor there's a lightly sweet pale maltiness that just barely lingers. The temperature is at the sweet spot right now, where the slight chill is bringing out the bitterness really nicely while still having warmed enough to accentuate flavors. The thing that is really nice and noticeable off the bat is that Pliny is almost mellow for a DIPA. It's very flavorful and bitter, just manages to be 'balanced' in a way that it doesn't just destroy your mouth. Also, what makes the flavors so great is that they're incredibly juicy and fresh.  MF - Medium bodied, with the carbonation really washing away the bitterness after each drink and leaving my mouth full of sticky, dank, citrus goodness. It's plenty oily and sticky to let you know it was there.  D - By far the most drinkable DIPA I've ever had. So far more drinkable than others that it's difficult to imagine giving it anything other than a 5. While I probably am going to suffer from a burned out palate, it sure doesn't feel that way. When it comes to DIPAs, I tend to be one and done because I know I won't be able to enjoy the second as much.

S - Pine trees...strike that, a pine forrest! Subtle citrusy grapefruit came through as well, but this truly smelled like a glass of pine. T - Very complex, full bodied, yet mild American imperial IPA style. The hops delivered exactly what the aroma would predict. A lot of pine flavor, a little citrus and grass, but somehow, not a lot of bitterness to this one. Not sure what the IBU's claim, but the malt, while not a prevelant flavor, must have been doing something to balance the bitterness. The hop flavors were powerful and dominant, just not overwhelmingly bitter. This was an incredible balance between extreme flavor and mild bitterness. Very well done. M - Thick, but not creamy. D - I could drink this as a session beer, discovering new flavors each sip.

Smells balanced, yet assertive. Brings me back to the first time I had this a year ago.  Taste: The mild carbonation and bitterness play well together across a malty background. Very, very balanced for a west coast IPA that has an abv of 8%, I cannot wait to try Pliny's nephew. There is some hype to this beer, but I can honestly say it is one of my favorites. This beer starts hoppy with a slight bitterness, then a sharper bitterness that fades into sweeter malt taste eventually. The thing I love about this beer is that you get the smell and taste of fresh hops. Wonderful. This is the IPA that taught me to love the style.  Mouthfeel: Very refreshing. Creamy.

Smells of citrus and piney hops. Smells like it is going to be hoppy.  Taste follows the nose. Taste starts off with a grapefuit and citrus taste, and resolves into a fresh piney hop taste. The citrus lingers on the tongue for a little bit, and then it fades away leaving a clean, refreshing taste. The hops are strong and add an excellent kick. Bitter but not overly bitter, and they stay on the tongue for a while. A very crisp and refreshing brew.  Mouthfeel is not very thick, and medium carbonation.

The hops lend pine, citrus, earthy and grapefruit notes. There is actually hints of malt which balance the nose for me. The taste is very similar. Very good hop profile balanced by a great malt backbone. The hops are citrus, piney, grapefruit and other fruity notes. The level of bitterness is perfect for an IIPA. Mouthfeel is also great. The medium body is very smooth with low-medium carbonation that suits the flavor perfectly. A bitter coat is left on the tongue. The beer has no alcohol presence, taste or MF, for me.

Pliny the Elder is one such. Fortunately, business brought us to the area and no time was lost in making the pilgrimage to the fount. Beer is a pale amber slightly hazy with a not much head but a decent lingering lacing on the glass (for what that is worth). Major impact on the nose with an intense full-on grapefruit explosion mixed with grassy and pine overtones. One can scarce forbear to taste and it is not disappointing: predominant citrus, some butterscotch undertones, that give way to lingering dry bitter finish.

863,7971,bump8628,4.92,"Bottled on date of 2/11/10. Poured into a large wine glass.  Hazy orange with a soapy, white head that laces all over.  The nose offers up a big, pungent pine aroma, like walking through the middle of an evergreen forest, accompanied by strokes of citrus.  Pine also leaves its mark on the palate, but makes room for more of the juicy, citric hops. A leafy, herbal bitterness lingers but never becomes harsh. The hops do all they can to suppress anything resembling malt, but I know it's there because Pliny the Elder still tastes like beer and not raw hop squeezings. The finish is quite dry, which enhances the perception of the hops even further, and the vast quantity of hops leaves a pleasant oily hop texture behind.  What can I say?

Lovely bright color...almost appears backlit as it sits in the glass. Fluffy head that clings to the glass and hangs around for a while.  S: Amazing. Loads of pine and citrus. Maybe a little bubblegum. As close to the scent of fresh hops as any beer I've ever smelled. As far as smell, Nugget Nectar has always been tops for me..but PtE is easily as good, if not better.  T: Taste mirrors scent. Big Pine and grapefruit. Again, freshness is amazing. Pliny has captured the smell and flavor of fresh, whole hops better than any beer I can remember. PtE demonstrates a little more balance (not much) than some west coast IPA's. Its not mouth puckeringly bitter. The hop presence isn't a palate wrecker...its just amazing. My vocabulary isn't up to the standard of describing this beer.  M: Damn near perfect. Carbonation is spot on. Has a certain creamy feel. Leaves my mouth with a dry, crisp, smooth feeling. Each sip makes you want another.  D: There is nothing about this beer that doesn't make me want more and more. At 8% this is not a huge beer by today's standards, but its certainly nothing to sneeze at. However, the alcohol is not present in the smell or the taste of the beer. I'm starting to feel the abv as I get to the bottom but if I didn't know better I would have guessed maybe 6-6.5%  Initially I was blown away by the smell, but not the taste. Very high expectations definitely have a lot to do with this. As I continued to drink, however, I really began to appreciate the beer more and more. This beer is everything its cracked up to be. I'm a total East Coast fanboy, but RR hit the jackpot with this one. I will NEVER take this beer off of my wants list unless Vinny decides to set up a RR satellite microbrewery in my garage that produces nothing but PtE. I can't wait to get my hands on some more of this and my desire to try Younger has just increased exponentially.  Edit: I just realized that 4.7 is the highest score I've given.",Russian River Brewing Company,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,100
863,7971,TJBurgess,4.57,"Got a bottle in trade from 2ndloveofmylife, thanks Michael!!  Bottle is dated 1.10.10, opened it 3.16.10.  A: pours out liquid gold with a 2 inch head of sticky white foam. Looks a bit cleaner than I had originally expected. You can almost see all the way through the glass.  S: smells of light hops, slight orange and citrus. It isn't overwhelming or too strong which is probably why I enjoy it so much. I wish my wife would wear this as a perfume!  T: there's a rush of hops and citrus on the front end of this, finished with a light malt. No sensation of alcohol at all. Everything is well balanced, yet not quite as complex as I had expected.  M: light and crisp. Plain and simple. There is a nice lingering of carbonation, but it helps hide the alcohol.  D: more please! I could make this a staple in rotation.  Overall, I really enjoyed it, and it is probably my second favorite DIPA, behind Dreadnaught, to date.  Cheers!",Russian River Brewing Company,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,100
863,7971,bulletrain76,4.88,"Draught at the Bistro. I have long awaited the day to try Pliny the Eder. Maybe I was expecting too much. Hype is a horrible thing. Piney and grapefruit peel-bitter hops are done exquisitely, within a clear golden body topped by a sticky white head. Aromas of pine needles and flowers. Light and dry as the most drinkable IPA. Not like any IIPA that I've had. So dry and crisp. Bitter, endless finish. I love the dryness and drinkability; it's like a single IPA that manages double the hop load, but The hop profile still falls a bit short. I'm missing the tropical, fruity notes that I get out of some other west coast IPAs. Pliny does it's thing almost perfectly, but that might just not really be my thing in the absolute realm of the hop. Rerate: I get it now. Forgive me, Pliny, for not even a fiery death at Mount Vesuvius could quell your awesomeness. The dryness IS the beauty. I guess it depends whether I am in the mood for a thicker DIPA or a dryer, thinner DIPA, but the power of the hops in this one is outdone by none so far. Rerate: My first bottled sample, at about three weeks old, as well as draught a couple times in the last two days. Awesome floral hops in the aroma. The flavor is so hoppy, yet the bitterness is so soft and inviting. You really could drink this for a session and not burn your palate out with bitterness or sweetness. Every sip leaves you longing for another, with a perfectly balanced, dry finish. Stunning stuff, but the glass I had at the grad showed how much this can drop off if not properly fresh.  Just having this again on tap at the brewpub; yes, it's better than Younger. Mouthfeel and appearance are perfect. The dryness and drinkability combined with an absolute avalanche of hop aroma and flavor just put this over the top.",Russian River Brewing Company,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,100
863,7971,kirkpjr,4.72,"Poured from a bottle dated 2/8/2010 into my new Bruery tulip. Huge thanks to route66pubs for a chance to try this one!  A: Pours a beautiful golden orange color with one finger of head. The color is somewhere in between an orange and lemon. Pours 1 finger of head with decent lacing. Slightly opaque.  S: Fresh citrus and piney hops. Loads of orange, tangerine, and pine. Also a scent of manderin oranges. Could smell this one all day.  T: Wonderful powerful yet clean burst of citrus and piney hops. Perfect balance in the front the taste, yet no real malt detected. Smooth on the front end and a hoppy stickiness on the back end.  M: Moderate carbonation. Resinous hops stick to the palette.  D: Most drinkable DIPA I've ever had. No hint of alcohol - just a clean, crisp, refreshing hop bomb.",Russian River Brewing Company,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,100

It dissipates slowly and leaves some lacing  S: Huge hop profile. Pine, grapefruit, orange. Just spectacular  T: As you would expect, begins with an explosion of hops. There is also fruit all over the place - grapefruit, orange, pineapple all blend together nicely. The alcohol is non-existent  M: Very smooth and perfect carbonation. Great bitter taste left on the tongue  D: Superb. This is what all other DIPAs should be modeled after.

863,7971,sweemzander,4.76,"500mL bottle poured into an imperial pint. Bottled on 02/08/10. Huge thanks to mb2696 for the bottle!  (A)- Pours a crystal clear yellow/orange color that produced a huge 2+ finger fluffy white head that has some great retention behind it. So much so that its just clinging to the sides of the glass as it very slowly dissipates. Left huge clumps of stickiness everywhere.  (S)- Just oozing of fresh yet creamy citrus of lemon, pineapple, & lime with a respectable pine needle background. Tons of good hop aromas. Creamy due to the combo of citrus & pine with a light dash of a honey-like sweetness.  (T)- Again, a blast of awesome creamy citrus & pine that is quickly followed with a massive dry bitter pine kick, but again, quickly smoothes out on the finish with a twist of honey sweetness & more of the creamy citrus. Dynamic taste that keeps your taste buds busy.  (M)- A superb carbonation & balance. Big hop flavors with just enough light honey malts to smooth out the edges of an otherwise dry & bitter monster. Never stops changing from creamy fruits, to bittering pine, to sweet malt. Very crisp & refreshing. Surprisingly smooth despite all the bittering dry hops.  (D)- A fantastic DIPA that most definitely lives up to the hype. Has everything that makes a great DIPA. Dynamic with a constantly changing mouthfeel that keeps your tastebuds busy & at full attention. Crisp & refreshing which I like. A great drinker that I could easily have a few of if given the opportunity, particularly since the alcohol level is lower than most DIPAs out there. I am definitely digging this one. Truly just a damn fine beer that I wish I could always have in my fridge.",Russian River Brewing Company,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,100
863,7971,SiepJones,5,"I sought this beer out and received it in my first trade. Served from a bottle into my snifter.  Appearance of golden liquid in the glass topped of with an inch and a half of fluffy, bubbly head. This beer is very opaque. There is a small amount of bubbles rise through this beer. The head sticks to glass as it dissipates, forming what look like clouds in the sky.  Taking a whiff from the glass yields a powerful smell of sweet citrus hop with a piney finish.  After having a sip I notice a lemon/citrus hop flavor on the front end which transforms into a grassy/earthy finish upon swallowing.  The feel of this beer is soft on the tongue and gums, while slightly slick when moved around the mouth. I also felt a light tingle or carbonation on my tongue as I swallowed.  This beer lived up to the hype as it was very drinkable. 8% seems low for this beer as you can hardly taste any alcohol. The mouthfeel is soft and the combination of scent and flavor keep you wanting more.

863,7971,ChainGangGuy,4.25,"Bottled on - 011410.  Appearance: Pours out a clear, brilliant, pale gold body with a sudsy, enduring, white head.  Smell: Quite a vibrant nose with many a perfumy aromatic - expressive notes of fresh florals, citrus oils, resinous pine, and even peaches fill the air.  Taste: Starts with a simple introduction of extra pale malts with some cracker tones to it and a relatively light sweetness. Flavors of oily lemon peelings, pine needles swimming in sap, meadow flowers, white grapefruit, and even white peaches usher in a bold bitterness. Picks up some spicy accents on the back end. As one would expect, it finishes dry and bitter with a lingering resinous quality.  Mouthfeel: Medium-bodied. Medium carbonation. Has a slight oily slickness to the mouthfeel.  Drinkability: After well over a thousand reviews, I'm not sure what there is left to be said. PtE is a stalwart of the style.

863,7971,sanjosey19,5,"Those that have already tried Pliny the Elder understand why there's a big A+ at the top of the page. Those that haven't, let me summarize all the reviews you will read: Pliny the Elder is very very good. Like hops? Try it. Now. Don't want a ""bitter"" beer that fills you up? Grow a pair, and then try it. You'd be short changing yourself if you didn't.  A - Amber, almost orangey color. Very good head retention and good lacing make it an obvious DIPA. Even the head is a bit orange.  S - Excellent, citrus, tangerines, grapefruit, the floral hop aroma dominates.  T - Very closely resembles the aroma, but with extremely well balanced malt characteristics. Sometimes I can even pick out a slightly roasted malty flavor. I like to call it a peanut buttery flavor, but no one I've mentioned this to seems to agree with me, but whatever. I am a bona fide hop head, so this beer is a dream for me. Some people might find the IBU's to be a little much, but I find that the hops are so perfectly balanced that I can pick out two or three different hop flavors.  M - I love the DIPA's because the higher levels of alcohol tend to subdue excessive carbonation, and develop a very smooth, silky mouthfeel.  D - Weighing in at 8%, I doubt I would ever risk drinking two of these for fear of not being able to enjoy all the flavors Pliny has to offer. The first thing I noticed about Pliny was how easy it is to drink. Of course, ""drinkablilty"" is extremely subjective.  In conclusion, if I could only drink one beer for the rest of my life it would be an easy choice, Pliny the Elder...that is until I get to try Pliny the Younger.",Russian River Brewing Company,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,100

T-Dry, bitter grapefruit with a really mild, subdued finish.  M-Really smooth, medium bodied with low carbonation. There's a lasting dryness that lingers in the back of your mouth begging you to drink more.  D-I was surprised at how easy drinking this was.

I get abundant pineapple, tropicical fruits, some pine at the end. Smells awesome.  T-Starts off more pine forward but certainly contains the pineapple ans tropical notes with a nice malty thread throughout that holds it together nicely. Lingering tropical fruits .

863,7971,hayesez,4.57,"Thanks to bricktop for including this in a recent trade. I've had PtE several times now and figured it is about time to toss up a ranking.  Poured into a standard pint glass. Pours a deep hazy bee yellow with a frothy two finger-head. This remains throughout the entire drink and leaves an impressive condensed lace throughout the depth of the glass. A very impressive looking beer.  I love the nose on the Elder. For my money, it is right up there with Hopslam and Pliny the Younger...some of the best smelling beers out there. A very citrusy hoppy beer. Some very sweet smelling citrusy fruits with the strong kick straight from Vinnie's boot. A piney touch one would expect from the extensive hops dumped into it to complement a modest floral component. This beer has it all!  The taste of the Elder follows suit with the nose. Very citrusy, hoppy fruits. A wonderful sweet finish that slowly transforms to a lingering bitterness. The best part about this is that you can dig your tongue into the corners of your mouth and pull up some more sweetness...only to see it morph into that hoppy bitterness - and let me tell you the bitter is in your face, and fantastic.  The mouthfeel of Pliny the Elder is one of the few areas that are lacking just a bit. It's tough when you compare to its closest kin, the Younger, as the latter laps the field in this department. The elder is still impressive with a smooth, medium-bodied, well carbonated feel.  I will say that this (as well as many of this style) does not do well with aging. While I'm not going to sit here and tell you that I personally could distinguish between fresh and 2-month PtE (although I would hope I could...), I'm sure there are those that would nail it every time. That being said, I would certainly not review this beer unless you had one bottled in the past month or so. This is a beer that bases its fame on freshness...humor it.  Overall a damn fine beer. It's a shame that the only times I get to drink it are when I travel west or when I have a fellow trader who is gracious enough to toss one in as en extra - this beer could be my wingman anytime.

Apricot, mango, peach hop aroma - so freaking good, and this is probably a couple months old now.  Perfectly balanced, juicy DIPA with tropical fruit character, passionfruit and mango, along with some apricot. Yeah, it's hoppy, but it's not hoppy for the sake of hoppy, there's artistry here. Little to no alcohol noted. I really do think this is a better beer than Younger.  Feel is resiny and a little creamy. Extremely well done.  Drinkability very high for a DIPA.

With the reputation PTE has and the 1000+ reviews I'm not exactly sure if there is much for me to add. As expected with such a hop happy beer, scents of citrus and pine dominate the aroma.  I found it to be well balanced and, to me, not a hop head, didn't find the hops to be overpowering as some of the lower reviews would suggest. I'm sure this is because it has sat for 4 months.  Overall, I guess what I am saying is that as much as it is stressed to drink this beer as fresh as possible, IMO, waiting a few months certainly didn't hurt the beer.

The mouthfeel is a litle thick which is unsurprising given the alcohol content and big taste. Amazingly drinkable, probably the best IPA/DIPA I've ever had.

The head is about two fingers thick and leaves a soapy appearance after a few sips.  The smell of this brew is one of its best features. It has a floral, apricot, and grapefruit aroma to it that just tickles my noise hairs.  It has a nice level of carbonation that brings out the bitterness of the hops, however it's not over abundant and gets you excited about the next sip. There is obvious notes of grapefruit and citrus in the flavor, but it doesn't leave you parched. I'm amazed that it's a DIPA, because it doesn't have the malty/alcohol presence that some DIPA have.  The carbonation has a nice sugar presence to it which makes it refreshing.  Drinkability: Everyday if I could. I live in Texas and sadly they RR does not distribute out here. The hops don't destroy your palate like some DIPA do. The hops dissipate rather quickly which leads me take sip after sip.

Maybe a dark gold with 2 fingers of head and sticky lacing. I see some sediments too.  Smells of grapefruit and a little pineapple? Never smelled pineapple in a DIPA, but it works nicely. Also smells fresh, grassy, and a little piney. Not noticing a whole lot of malt, but there are hints of some sweet maltiness shining through.  Taste is fresh grapefruit and citrus. Even a bit of orange/lemon. A little pine towards the back of the throat, but finishes malty then citrus. Very refreshing and clean finish.  This is just right on mouthfeel. Sometimes you get that piney feel that coats your throat, but not here. Carbonation level helps this one smoothly down my throat... And the clean finish makes it even more enjoyable.  If I could get this one all the time, I would certainly drink it regularily. If you can get it, drink it. If you can't, trade for it. It really is very nice.

The taste is great, loaded with hops, lots of dry hopped grapefruit flavor. The fantastic thing about this beer is it's dryness.

863,7971,zoso493,4.89,"Poured this guy from a 500 ml bottle into a pint glass. Bottled on 1/14/10. Split the bottle three ways.  Appearance: Pours a very bright golden color that is much lighter than you'd expect in a DIPA. There's very little amber to be found, but it is a very hazy brew. I didn't have a complete serving but it still produced a nice one-and-a-half finger head that left some moderate lacing on the glass.  Smell: This one has a very nice fruity scent to it. It's much more subdued than I would have thought but it's masterfully laced together. There's also a huge caramel sweetness to the smell, which is just beautifully pronounced. It smells like the sweetest nectar and it's to be consumed.  Taste: Well damn. This is a tremendous IPA. It retains the huge fruity hop character but has the most delectable, pleasurable and intense hop bitterness to it. This is not to say the malts aren't present, as the caramel malts just make the hops seem like they are crusted in sugar. Make no mistake, though, this one is all about the hops, and it is a masterfully bitter IPA.  Mouthfeel: Very nice, crisp mouthfeel. It's not the thickest DIPA you'll find but it's very nicely carbonated and very smooth.  Drinkability: Despite all the wonderful bitterness, this one doesn't destroy your palate so you could have a few of these. In fact, I would love to have a few of these at a time. All the time. This a beer that I could never grow tired of.  Overall, this is just a truly fantastic IPA all around. It's the first beer I've had from Russian River and it's left a huge impression on me. It nails the style with a wonderful fruity hop bitterness but keeps the hops somewhat honest with the chewy caramel malts. If you haven't tried this beer, you should make it every effort to seek it out, because it is a wonderful beverage.",Russian River Brewing Company,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,100

863,7971,DIM,4.27,"a: This was a slightly hazy golden color. It was served to me with thin whisp of a head.  s: Lots of fresh lemon and a little pineapple backed by a little caramel and vanilla.  t: Not much to say that hasn't already been said. Copious amounts of fresh citrus barely balanced by a touch of rough caramel and brown sugar.  m: Creamy feeling overall, very nice.  d: My first time having this, what the hell took me so long? I'd love to have some more.",Russian River Brewing Company,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,100
863,7971,erosier,4.62,"L: Pours a nice clear orange yellow with a medium sized and thick bodied white colored head that laces the glass very nicely on the way down. The look is actually a bit deceiving in this case as it looks lighter than it is going to be. S: Smells of sweet toasted malts, then a rich piney, earthy, slightly citrus-y mix of hops that pretty much takes over the nose. T: Tastes of a very nice sweet toasted malt base, with a big earhty, grapefruity, piney, and floral hop taste to it. The hops don't overpower, they just take over but there enough of a malt backbone where it tastes very good. M: Very crisp, refreshing, a little heavier than it looks, slightly warming, perfect amount of carbonation. D: Very drinkable beer, this was a really good one and gone in no time.",Russian River Brewing Company,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,100
863,7971,jcnd9803,5,"Thanks to krtman for sharing!  a -Pours a light caramel color with about an inch head that retains really well and provides outstanding lacing.  S - Ridiculous..Really strong fresh pine and pineapple.  t - Crazy hop flavors are what jump out on first sip, accompanied by a fresh pineapple citrus  m - Crisp and refreshing. And even though it smells and tastes so hoppy, it's amazingly not dry. How do they do that?  d - I really do love a good IPA, but feel that many double/imperials take it too much in one direction to try and achieve flavor that ends up hurting the drinkability. This beer however has a crap load of IPA flavor and brings it well. Bravo!",Russian River Brewing Company,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,100
863,7971,FreshHawk,4.75,"A - Hazy golden orange with a good sized white, foamy head.  S - Big fruity hop smell. Lots of grapefruit, pineapple, orange, and just a little lemon. Good amount of pine too.  T - Similar to the smell. Lots of hops, grapefruit, pineapple, orange, lemon, pine, as well as some floral and other earthy flavors. Considering all this, it isn't too bitter. There is bitterness present, but there are so many other flavors it doesn't seem overpowering. The fruit flavors provide a very subtle sweetness along with some pale malt as well.  M - Medium to full body with good carbonation. Very creamy and smooth.  D - Great drinkability. Goes down easy and taste wonderful. The hop flavors work so well together and it is quite refreshing. Would love to sit back and enjoy a few, unfortunately the ABV (and at the moment availability) prevents that somewhat.  Notes: Wonderful beer with lots of West Coast type of hop flavors. Really good mix of hops that compliment each other. Also considering what it is and the amount of hops that are tasted, it is well balanced. There is a nice bitterness, but that is more in the background.",Russian River Brewing Company,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,100
863,7971,donkeyrunner,4.15,"Flown in fresh from Cali via duffextracold.  Large white head over a clear, light orange beer. Bubble pile retention leaves delicate coral lace stuck to mine glass.  Aroma: soft pine hop jumps on top of sweet citrus candy hops with a sexy third party pepper hop. Corn muffin?  Thin, dry biscuity malt under a citrus hop medley--kind of like a bunch of those sugared candy fruit slices.  It's good...it's very good.

Grapefruit, tangerine, tropical fruit, floral, spicy, piney, herbal, resiny. Light biscuit-like malt in the background.  Fresh and juicy - floral, orange, grapefruit, and tropical fruit. Spicy dank herbal resins, pine, slight ganja. Just a touch of toasty biscuit like malt that sets the stage for the hops to attack the palette. Big resinous piney bitterness. yum  Sticky, mouth coating, dry, yet crisp and refreshing. A nice drinkable body. And well carbonated.  So drinkable, a refreshing hoppy masterpiece.

863,7971,happilysurly,4.85,"500ml bottle. Pours burnished bronze. Aroma is pineapple and grapefruit and fresh wet hops, not piney. Big, full flavor. TONS of hops, much less malt flavor. Has a bitterness that is not overpowering, not sharp, but lingers. It isn't overly sharp like a lot of ipa's or alcoholy like a lot of imperial ipa's. The balance is quite remarkable. Finish is tropical fruitiness.

863,7971,pants678,4.53,"On tap at Father's Office in Culver City.  Came in a tulip type glass with a narrow top. The head was a single finger, white and frothy with excellent retention. The body is a clouded gold, pristine yellow.  A well hopped citrus with notes of pine and an underline of yeast on the nose.  I'm not one for the IPAs at all, but this was beyond genre and type. The subtle mix of fruits, grapefruit, orange and mango is a perfect match for notes of coriander and pine with a dry hop back. The Elder's just bitter enough, off-setting the grain/grass without ever being sour. A musty-sweet. No reminder of the 8% by volume.  Smooth and tart as the best hefeweizens, crisp as the best czech pilsners.

A: Moderate pour yields one finger of white head with very good retention. Hazy golden amber liquid. Beautiful!  S: Solidly hoppy: pine, garlic, slight citrus. Some esters provide a vehicle to keep the hop aroma aloft.  T: Very bitter, yet with a great malt character too. Rich flavor, I want more! Balanced DIPA, but definitely on the hoppy side of the style.  M: Round, full, bitter. Rich.  D: So high. I want another right now! I will definitely buy again.

863,7971,Jason,4.5,"NOTE: If you are drinking this beer about 2 months past its freshness date then you are not getting the full experience.  500ml brown bottle with a bottled on freshness date.  Mildly hazed orange golden color, solid two fingers of head leave a nice crowning of sticky lace that leaves thick rings on the glass. Big hop aroma of evergreen, clementine rind, pineapple and fresh cut grass. Super smooth with a modest amount of carbonation. Prickly spicy hop bitterness with citric, mint and wild flower flavors that linger far into the aftertaste. Hint of nutty yeast and a big handful of biscuity malt are thrown at the palate and actually shows that this beer has balance. Full bursting orange grove flavor. The 8.0% stays hidden for the most part yet does yield a slow warmth about half way through the pint, a bit of ripe tropical fruitiness within from the esters. Finishes with that long drawn out hop bitterness and flavor as it leans towards the dry side.  Epic, a deserving epic as well even with all of the hype surrounding PTY.

863,7971,imblane,4.92,"I finally decided to review this one after drinking God knows how many.  A - crystal clear golden pale yellow with a nice two finger head that leaves strong lacing as it dissipates.  S - Big hop aroma! The freshest hop nose of any beer I have tried. The Columbus, and Simcoe hops are king. There are a few Centennial there, but citrusy piny Simcoe seems to be the signature here.  T - Wow, is this beer really 8%? nice rounded bitterness from the Columbus hops and the Simcoes come in and round out the hoppiness with an adequate malt backbone. No alcohol noted which is significant in an 8% beer.  M - Dry with a crisp hoppy bite. Not too dry but not cloying at all.  D - I can drink 3 or 4 of these easy! The abv creeps up on me about that time and smacks me in the back of the head. The most drinkable of any 8% beer I have tried.  To me this personifies the style. I have had Pliny's younger nephew, but for the average evening I prefer the Elder! Of note, I had one of these this evening after a PTY and it was the last pour from the keg. It had a sinificant amount of yeast in the glass and it looked like a Hefeweizen! The server offered to pour me another or give it to me for free, but I declined.

863,7971,WanderingFool,4.25,"I drank several ounces of Pliny the Elder at the Extreme Beerfest. It's basically Pliny the Youngers little brother.  The beer pours a clear, honey yellow color with a creamy, small white head on top. The aroma is very hoppy with grassy and grapefruit citrus notes.  Each sip of this medium to full bodied beer is very smooth with a mild fizz on the palate. The flavor is mostly hops with notes of grass and grapefruit citrus. A fair amount of sweet dry malt and fruity yeast notes balance out the hops. It finishes dry with linger citrus hops once the beer is gone.  This beer is easier to drink than Pliny the Younger. It's smoother, lighter bodied, well balanced and very flavorful.",Russian River Brewing Company,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,100
863,7971,TheycallmeTim,4.1,"Bottle with a date of 1.6.10 poured into a Hennepin flute.  A--Orange like a lollipop or Skittle body, two finger creamy white head. Picture perfect. Looks juicy.  S--Soft, in a weird way. I am getting some earth and a lot of fruit that grows where there's lots of sun, namely orange, mango and pineapple. But also gentler floral notes pull through toward the end of my sniffs. Surprised how not in-your-face this was. Happily surprised.  T--Again, tastes accomplished, for lack of a better word, in terms of the way it was hopped. Very little malt, so the ""balance"" is between the sweeter fruit and floral flavors and the more bitter sawdust pine. What's nice is how earthy the hops are, too--is this what Crystal hops do? If so, I gotta get me some. The earth makes for a nice foundation for the other hop flavors.  M&D--Mouthfeel for me shines brightest. It's creamy and smooth as hell. Absolutely nothing demanding your palate with regard to the carbonation or overall feel. Complements the flavor profile perfectly.  Good drinkability, but, ok, I gotta say it: given the price point, given how hard this bugger is to get, is it /really/ that good? I smell hype, and it's a little rotten. I just don't see a marked difference between this beer and Sierra Nevada's wet hop harvest, and the latter's cheaper and more widely distributed (not to mention the lower ABV lets you drink more of it while still tasting its complexity). I guess the holy grail factor makes this beer more highly rated. Not that I'd turn it down. Ever. Clearly the product of a great deal of experience and precision.

863,7971,Bubba83,4.58,"I got this bottle off the Pliny tree in my backyard. Finally realized I've somehow never sat down and reviewed old geezer Pliny. Poured into a tumbler at ~45 degrees.  Bottled on date of 01/14/10. OMG, it's over a month old, surely it must have lost all it's incredible flavors by now!!!  The appearance has no faults. I poured at a somewhat slow rate down the side of the glass and ended up with three finger widths of glowing white head. Texture of the head is foamy looking, with bubbles of all sizes. Head retention is excellent, and there is a decent ring of sudsy stuff on top that sticks around. Splotchy lacing that has really good cling to it. The body is a mid-range orange color with some straw highlights and tiny bubbles rising from the bottom of the glass.  Smells quite impressive, and has a unique quality of deep forest to it that no other company can seem to achieve. There's also some grapefruit pith, but mostly just lots and lots of pine. If I reviewed this before trying Younger it'd probably have a 5 in aroma, but the Younger is quite a bit more pungeant and has more complexity as well. I also get a hint of tropical fruits like pineapple.  Tastes great, even late. Smack of grapefruit rolls across the tongue, with some very faint caramel-like sweetness picking up in the midrange. Tropical fruity type flavors are here too. Grassy flavors take it from there and lead into a ridiculous amount of pine needles and spruce for the finale. There's some lemon zest in the finish too. Just absolutely fantastic flavor bursting out everywhere in my mouth.  Mouthfeel is spot on for a DIPA. I've found a lot of other DIPAs are too thick, overly creamy, and just not ""lively"" enough. It has just the right amount of slick oilyness to it while retaining a good bit of carbonation. Finishes quite dry for a big beer which is Vinnie's M.O. when it comes to brewing IPAs.  Drinks great, though it's pretty damn bitter with almost no sweetness for balance. I don't mind the skew but others might not care for it. There are very few DIPAs that I can actually say are refreshing to drink, and this is one of those few. Vinnie, please have my children.",Russian River Brewing Company,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,100
863,7971,goatgoat,4.18,"Bottled on 1/6/10. Poured into a pint.  Pours a light sunshine gold with honey tints. A nice meringue head and strings of thick lace. An earthy pine is upfront, followed by grapefruit and a bare hint of tropical fruits. There's a resin in the aroma as well. This beer is surprisingly thick in the mouth. Taste is predictably hop-forward. More tropical notes come through in the taste. A nice clean bitter finish. An odd balance between coating and drying.  This is nice... but maybe not as nice as I expected. The curse of high expectations perhaps. Or maybe it's the fact that I'm moving towards lower ABV brews. Either way, I preceded this with a Blind Pig and for me, the Pig is the way to go.",Russian River Brewing Company,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,100

Smells of pine, orange zest, fresh flower bouquet, ripe fruits and grass. Taste is not a letdown, tastes as it smells. Large piney flavor with citrus and breadiness and an amazingly smooth bitterness throughout that leaves its lasting impression. Very well balanced and smooth, not an overbearing hop bomb - has a slight maltiness to keep it under control. Light carbonation dances gaily upon my tongue. Greatness. I must admit that I have had this fresher and that the hop does seem to fade slightly over the time.

A: Pours a light golden brown color, clear, and with a beautiful frothy, white head. Some lacing is left behind on the walls of my snifter.  S: The first and strongest scent that I pick up is of pine. After that I get some faint tart tropical citrus notes. Backing up the hops is a bread-like malt backbone.  T: The nose doesn't lie. The pine flavor is strong up front, and quickly fades into tart citric peach and grapefruit flavors. There are some other citrus flavors in there too, but the aforementioned ones were most dominant. Again, the hops are backed up by a bread-like malt backbone that is there, just enough, to lend a hand in the flavor department. 4.75/5 .. I adjusted the Smell up to 4.5/5 from 4/5 to account for this.  M: Nice and creamy mouthfeel and a medium amount of prickly carbonation hits the tongue. There is also a substantial amount of hop resin left behind.  D: This beer is always a pleasure to drink when super fresh. After about a month and a half the hops, which are pretty much all this beer is, fade quickly and the brew degrades.

863,7971,krisandajt,4.77,"A huge thanks to cloudskipper for hooking me up with this bad boy. I raise my glass to you, sir!  Appearance: An easy pour into my Sam Adams Perfect Pint Glass reveals a clear, light bronze/golden colored brew. Much lighter in color than what I expected. Sitting atop this brew is a good half inch worth of white bubbly head that fades away rather quickly leaving behind plenty of thick soapy lacing.  Edit: As I pour the bottom half of the beer into the glass I see the beer turn from clear to cloudy. No other changes in characteristics.  Smell: I could smell the hops from this the instant I opened the bottle and began to pour. Plenty of ripe, citrusy goodness throughout with a nice sweetness balancing it out. There's even a bit of pine resin squeezed in there just to add a bit of complexity. Very inviting.  Taste: My taste buds are immediately assaulted with heap loads of fresh, clean, crisp hoppy goodness. A robust hop profile, bittersweet grapefruit and pine, delicately balanced with (but not outdone by) a clean, sweet malt backbone. I don't want to put the glass down, this is outstanding.  Mouthfeel: Smooth and full bodied. I could have used maybe a little bit more carbonation, but that would just be nit-picking.  Drinkability: There's not much I can add to this beer than what has already been said. This is simply an outstanding beer. The hop profile is, what I like to call, clean...it's not just a heap of bitterness thrown about like a monkey sh!t fight at the zoo. The hops have character and are finally balanced with the malt. This beer's only rival would have to be its ""Younger"" brother. Highly highly recommend.",Russian River Brewing Company,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,100
863,7971,HopNuggets,5,"First review ever is a hophead's dream Pliny the Elder. In my book, the standard for DIPAs. This one was brought back to CT for me by a coworker on a San Diego area trip he went on for work. Poured a 500ML bottle dated 01/06/10 into a snifter.  A - Pours so smoothly with an amazing 1+ inch head that dissipates to a 1/8"" head that stays around to leave amazing lacing down the sides of the glass. Bright sunrise orange color with tiny bubbles rising to keep the constant head.  S - Smells of citrus and piney notes stand out. Citrus is grapefruit with some orange in there too. A hint of caramel malt comes out as it warms towards the bottom of the glass.  T - Taste if of citrus, orange with a bitterness in the back of your mouth that at times makes your cheeks pucker in. AMAZING! Keeps you going back for more. There is a bit of caramel malt in there that lingers after.  M - The feel is extremely smooth with slight carbonation at the beginning of the glass but carbonation fades towards the bottom of the glass.  D - Watch out for this one at 8% it's very drinkable. If it wasn't so damn hard to get my hands on I would drink this all day everyday.  Today is 2/12/2010 and it's my second Pliny. My first was from the same bottling date but I drank it on 1/29/2010.

The nose on this beer is fantastic - floral, fresh, some citrus, and the stiff pine resin that I just love.  Taste and mouthfeel were as good as any DIPA I have tried. Having never tried Pliny before, I have no idea how much the hop punch fades after a few months, but I thought the freshness was still there. I am of course now curious to try one right after bottling, but who knows when that will be.  I don't care what anyone says about pellets versus extract versus whole-cone fresh hops, this lived up to the hype.

863,7971,sisuspeed,4.63,"Thanks to tjensen3618 for sending this one out east. Bottled on 1/14/2010.  Prying off the cap reveals a sweet rush of grassy, piney hops. This should be a good one. Poured into a tulip glass, Pliny is a clear, peach-orange color with a sticky white head on top. Nicely webbed lacing is left along the glass. Looks great.  The aroma is filled with citrus-infused, pine-laden hops. Lots of grassy hops in this one. Oranges and a sweet malt backbone make up the rest of the aroma.  After a couple of sips I can see why this beer holds the ranking it does. Pliny tastes like someone squeezed fresh hops from their hand right into the glass. Lots of citrusy, bitter, sticky hops. Oranges come out as the main citrus fruit, with a touch of grapefruit settling over somewhat bready malts.  The mouthfeel is very interesting with this DIPA. Your mouth is initially assaulted by bitter hops and then a wave of sweet malts, but the finish is light and refreshing. Lower carbonation, yet somewhat prickly. Pliny manages to be a big beer without a huge malt presence, which is nice.  Drinkability is superb. I could drink Pliny all day and wish I had easier access to it. The alcohol is unnoticeable and the finish is refreshing and light.  Like everyone has already said, this is an excellent DIPA. I think one of the main aspects of Pliny that sets it apart from other DIPAs is that it is so well balanced. Lots of amazing hops upfront, malts in the middle and light on the finish. You just want to keep reaching for this beer, especially if you love hops. Russian River has hit the nail on the head with this one.

There is a slight dankness opening for resinous pine, black peppercorn, grapefruit, Clementine orange, and lemon zest. Also carries a nice herbal note of cloves and cardamom sweetness. T: The taste follows the nose very well. Slightly herbal with nice citrus and pine highlights. Blood orange leads the citrus sweetness followed by a slight but noticeable sugar cookie sweetness in the malt profile. Tropical fruits and pineapple linger on the palate. M: Has medium body, nice carbonation but could be a little more robust. Overall one of the best IPAs I've had the pleasure of drinking. Extremely well balanced taste with great complexity. The flavors just keep evolving and developing through the whole bottle. Leaves me satisfied but still wanting more. It's really too bad that this beer doesn't see distribution in Michigan.",Russian River Brewing Company,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,100

863,7971,OttoBomb,4.62,"500 ml bottle poured into Dogfish Head signature glass (February 5, 2010). ""BOTTLED ON: 011410"" is printed on label. Received this is a trade with vasdef42. Thanks & Cheers Jared!  Eyes: A nice, slightly hazy rangy-copper-honey color. Two full fingers of light fluffy, cloud like head. Lacing is clingy and significant.  Nose: The reputation of Pliny made me expect a good nose, and it delivers. Sweet honey-hops with floral notes abound. Fresh grapefruit and lemon peel erupts from the glass and I'm looking forward to taking the first sip.  Tongue: The taste matches what the nose promises. This is a very potent, bitter hopfest, but it got that one feature I need to enjoy any IPA: balance. The grapefruit and lemon peel is much more pronounced than the aroma, and there isn't a whole lot of malt here, but there is just enough not to be completely showed aside by the hops.  Mouth: Good carbonation, some bitter aftertaste, but the massive tongue pounding hop character is smoother than most any other DIPA I've had.  Libation: An absolutely lovely creation. Potent, tasty yet smooth enough to make it very easy to drink. The 8% ABV simply cannot be felt/tasted and it's easy to down more than one bottle even though they are half a liter each. Cheers to Russian River brewer Vinnie Cilurzo for his efforts here.",Russian River Brewing Company,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,100
863,7971,sophisticated,4.44,"Oh man. My little sister out in Oregon sent me a bottle for my b-day. Thanks sis!  A) I poured this into a Sam Adams perfect pint glass. I don't know if it was just the glass, but it looked more orange at the top, and more yellow towards the bottom. The liquid was hazy with 1-2 fingers sudsy white head which quickly receded leaving a bit of sticky lace. Not much visible carbonation, and a slick/viscous layer against the glass.  S) Oh man. When I opened the bottle hops just poured out! Hop heaven. Orange, pineapple, pine, grass. Mango. A bit of spice. All begging me to drink!  T) Mmmm...Sweet citrus, mango followed by bitter pines and a bit of pepper or other spice. Each sip leaves a huge hop flavor in my mouth. I feel like I'm going to be tasting hops forever. Delicious.  MF) Medium and the taste sits in your mouth forever.  D) Really good! A little too bitter for me, so one to take your time with. Definitely wish I had another afterwards.

A: Pours a nice, clear deep orange honey-like color with a one finger head that settles into a small lacing. decent retention.  S: An incredible piny, floral and citrus hop filled aroma. Pine sap, grapefruit and flowers are all dominate figures in the nose. Extraordinary.  T: Reminiscent of the flavor-- and that's a great thing. Juicy, piny hops again up front, followed by a great grapefruit-like citrus flavor. The taste sticks to your mouth well after putting down the glass down. Alcohol is very well hidden. Insanely clean finish. Wow.  m&d: great crisp mouthfeel; drinkability is great-- really refreshing. I really wish I could get these all the time.

863,7971,afausser,4.67,"Bottle courtesy of BeachBumC--so glad to have tried this one, thanks!  Before drinking this, I'd like to point out the bottle. I like it when breweries put effort into their bottles/labels--it's sort of like reading the liner notes for an album and generally makes the entire ""beer experience"" more enjoyable as a whole. This one keeps it simple in appearance, and has text (and good beer advice!) in basically the entire free space of the label...for example: ""PLINY THE ELDER IS A HISTORICAL FIGURE, DON'T MAKE THE BEER INSIDE THIS BOTTLE ONE!"" and ""CONSUME PLINY FRESH, OR NOT AT ALL!"" Okay, okay, fine!  Appearance: Pours a hazy golden orange/light amber with fast moving, medium-sized carbonation bubbles and nearly an inch of fluffy bubbly head. The head disappears exactly the way I would expect it to--it's somewhat persistent but as I type this a great deal of the bubbles pop and what is left is increasingly larger bubbles and a sticky ring of foamy, web-like lacing that have the consistency of soap in a bubble bath. The part of the head that lasts any amount of time (about a half a finger) seems like it'll be sticking around for a bit and ends up being a more consistent, medium bubble size. The carbonation bubbles are not entirely evident from an arm's length (where it sits on the table next to me as I type this up) but when it's held to the light you can see the fine, medium speed and medium sized bubbles moving straight to the top of the glass in just a few lines--doesn't look over-carbonated from here though what there is seems to promise to be decently big.  Smell: Floral hops and honey are the huge notes in this brew, as well as a strong pink grapefruit scent--no huge surprises there. It smells absolutely wonderful, and has a mellow tone to it. I'm also getting notes of sweet molasses, maple syrup, caramel and, to a lesser extent, brown sugar out of the nose as well as a slightly spicy alcohol and hops note which comes across as black pepper and maybe the slightest hint of wintergreen (though this isn't at all hot and is blended entirely nicely with the other scents in the beer. I'm also smelling cold apple juice. There's a very mild citrus note--maybe a slight lemon zest and a tiny squeeze of orange juice blended in. I hate to compare beers to one another, but because these two are quite similar--it does smell quite a bit like Hopslam, though a more mellow, slightly more honey-toned version. Smooth and creamy. I should note that as it warms, the honey notes come out more and more and it mellows, smelling less like the familiar, crisp Hopslam I have come to know and love and more bready, grainy, apple toned and dark. It retains its heavy floral notes, however, throughout the life of the beer.  Taste: The first notes that I get out of this, oddly enough, are white grapes and pears (though they are not particularly dominant as I continue to drink), followed by a light, lemon and grapefruit hop aftertaste. There are also apple and orange juices present here, but their sweetness is not very dominant due to the bitterness of the hops, which is quite intense. The bitterness itself is not sharp and biting, but dull, dark, and in the background--though quite persistent. This gives it the impression of an almost funky note, though it is still more hoppy than anything else. The floral smell of the hops really changes to hay and grass--and a slight pine--in the taste. Definitely becomes far more orange and lemon juice flavored--and significantly sweeter--as it warms. There's a definite honey note, but the citrus and bitter hop notes dominate far more (though I will note that the warmer it gets the more the nice honey note comes out as well as a maple sugar note, though it's not very syrupy. These both blend very nicely with everything else). The smallest hint of yeasty, sweet, bread comes through as well, though that's not to say that it's malty. Also as it warms, there's an ever-so-slight sourness that starts to come through.  Mouthfeel: Not biting, and the carbonation keeps it crisp yet subdued. The aftertaste is very persistent and bitter yet manages to not be abrasive. Very smooth and creamy. I'm trying to figure out words with which to describe the very present, very persistent, yet non-abrasive carbonation. It is there at exactly the right moments and disappears at exactly the right moments to perfectly complement the taste. A higher carbonation level would have resulted in it being too abrasive and a lower level would undercut the great flavors present in the taste. No heat whatsoever.  Drinkability: One to sip, but it's entirely delicious. The only thing really holding this one back from going down quicker is the bitterness, which is great and totally acceptable for the style and ABV. The combination of smell and taste is really quite excellent. I love when a beer can have significantly different yet still complementary smell and taste elements--nicely done.",Russian River Brewing Company,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,100

The smell has a ton of grapefruit, caramel malt and very pungent smelling hop 'dankness'  The hop bitterness rules this castle of flavor, citrus and grapefruit give a juicy kick. This is backed by a decent malt sweetness. wow!  The feel is a bit oily from the hop resins, but the high co2 fixes this and makes for a perfect mouthfeel.

863,7971,zoolzoo,4.74,"Fresh bottle, dated 01/06/10  A: Poured a cloudy golden/copper color, frothy white head  S: The aroma has got to be one of the best ive experienced from an IPA/DIPA, no wait... maybe one of the best out of any beer. The pine is sitting right there on your nose yet all of the mango/grapefruitish citrus notes are very, very evident. The aroma is strong and distinct enough where I can easily pick apart the hops, pale malts, and citrus.  T: As opposed to many DIPAs I feel like the citrus bites first which is enticing, followed by of course hop bitterness. Malts are waiting until the end to make an appearence here, but citrus and pine still dominate whats left of the sip.  Where many IPAs leave me with a bitter pine cone in my mouth for an after taste, Pliny leaves me feeling like I just ate a lemon or an orange. Excellent!  Alcohol is not apparent until a pleasing warming shows itself way at the end of the sip.  M: Mouthfeel is medium bodied, but just thick enough for a DIPA. Carbonation is medium to low, but suits this beer quite well.  D: I could have a few pints of this without a doubt. Its 8% sure, but this is so tastey and smooth.  Ive had many IPAs/DIPAs, and I think Pliny lives up to the hype, period. Im glad I got a chance to try this, and its a shame that everytime I want a Pliny I need to check ebay or seek out a trade. Truely a tragedy!  EDIT: I'm editing my review because I just recently had another Pliny from a different, newer batch, and man this thing is consistently awesome. Additionally, I believe the ""taste"" element of this beer warrants a 5. I'm moving to California because of a beer, bye.",Russian River Brewing Company,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,100
863,7971,llllDrGONZOllll,4.59,"22oz Bottle poured into a tulip  A: A straw like yellow mixed with highlights of gold hazy clouds in the center make it glow when held to the light. A luscious head of off white tops this DIPA.  S: There is a lot to take in all at once but the hops are the star here. Lime and mint first come to mind Christmas trees touches of alcohol and grapefruit. I am picking up hints of hay and fresh cut grass with slight floral whiffs, but the citric is the most dominant. It is as lovely to smell as it is to taste...well almost.  T: Grapefruit citric mint and a slight hoppy sweetness. I say that lightly cause the clingy hop bitterness defiantly squashes any sweetness left from malt or hops. This truly is a hopbomb and more than likely the hoppiest brew I have consumed to date. Is this the wall where do I go from here? I cannot imagine more hops packed into the upfront taste through the swallow and quite a time after the swallow. Truly a fine crafted ale BRAVO Russian River I know understand where all the hype began.  M: This ale glides across the tongue, tingling from hops and carbonation. Pliny goes down easy and is pleasant to take large quaffs. The body is not too thin for the dryness of this ale.  D: If I lived closer to this DIPA it would be even more drinkable, that is the only thing that is holding me back from cracking the other two bottles tonight. I find this brew to quite drinkable the 8% ABV is not even noticeable in the mouth... just the buzz. Most IPAs that I enjoy are 7%+ so this brew just seems slightly bigger.

I could be wrong.  S= I get mint, lime peel, and Christmas trees. There are some sweet but floral notes hidden in there.  T= Up front there is a very citric bite that lingers through to the end. This is accompanied by the Christmas tree. There is a little malt sweetness to balance it, but you may want to ignore that and bask in hoppy crispness.

Super clean aftertaste and mouthfeel, nothing in particular lingers.  Overall: A fantastic beer indeed. I went into this glass a bit hesitant; the intense aroma kind of put me off as I really don't have much taste for heavily hopped brews, but the complex taste and spot on aftertaste had me enjoying sip after sip.

Also a very strong pine backbone. So far I'm very impressed.  First sip is like drinking hop juice. I mean this in a great way. Onslaught of grapefruit in the front with the strong, bitter pine as the finish. Surprisingly not very aggressive at all. Aftertaste is very delicious and beckons you to take yet another sip.

There is rumor that deep in a barely lit cavern, worshipers perform nameless rites to a giant bottle of P.t.E.  It is a high quality DIPA. The color is crystal clear copper unlike many cloudier DIPAs. The head is pils like and leaves an impressive lacing.  The aroma is over-loaded with hops: pine, citrus, frankincense like.  The flavor is a dense bitter, oatsy hops. It is extremely dry and nutty. Unlike many other DIPAs there is only a tiny hint of malt sweetness. The balance here is not between the sweet-sour typical of DIPA but instead a balance between solid bready grains and sharper spice.  It has a good, smooth but not terribly unique mouthfeel.

Very clean and crisp. I get a distinct orange and lemon presence blended with piney resin. The taste is agressive! Lots of citrus and pine up front.

Insistent but flexible grapefruit with almost no hop 'bite' until the smoooth bitter finish. As it warms, develops a slight farmhouse-y flavor.  Oh so smooth. Out-of-this-world drinkable beer.  Alot of DIPA or IPAs tend to be quite similar, but Pliny stands out in both it's complexity and character.

Appearance is a beautiful golden copper pour with a wonderful head that recedes to a finger or less with lacing. TBH I'm still not sure why lacing means a damned thing, but I list it because other people have been. I don't think lacing enhances the beer experience at all other than making sure you have to rinse out your glass before the next one.  Smell is wonderfully piney citrus hops. Strong, raw, grapefruit, it's like smelling salts...it'll wake you right up.  Taste is off the chart... your mouth begins to feel something different, you feel a bite..that's the hops... it washes through your mouth infecting every possibly area.

It is obvious that the makers of this beer know what they are doing.",Russian River Brewing Company,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,100
863,7971,BuckeyeOne,5,"I've had PtE from the bottle many times since it hit Seattle on a regular basis. I didn't get a chance to have it on tap until recently. Fresh PtE is definitely a step up from the bottle.  Let me begin by saying that this is my favorite beer, hands down. I would have a PtE anytime, anywhere. I will have some in my fridge at all times, as long as the beer stores are stocked.  It pours a beautiful golden amber with an excellent white head and lacing that holds true.  I remember the first time I cracked open a bottle, poured it in my glass and was confronted with a pine forest aroma and the backing of grapefruit. I was floored. I couldn't imagine that a bottled beer could smell so incredible. It was nothing compared to a fresh PtE from the tap. Freshness prevails.  The taste followed the smell. But what is starkly different in PtE from the tap is the true lack of balance. Bottled PtE, for me, is sweeter --- you can taste the caramel malt. I got none of that from the tap --- a true hop bomb. And I was better for it.  Once I built a tolerance for DIPAs, they've become my session beers. Sick.",Russian River Brewing Company,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,100
863,7971,alpinebryant,4.25,"bottled on date 12.23.09 Pours a clear yellow with a light white head that soon was only at the edges.  Strong smell of citrus, grapefruit, and tons of pine. Yes there is actually malt used to make this beer - you can smell that as well, it is just completely outdone by the insane hop presence.  Tastes very strongly of Pine, grapefruit, citrus, long bittering sensation aftershock after you have taken a few sips. Definitely not undesirable, just possibly not my favorite way to have an ipa. I prefer an IPA more on the sweet side - seems to be a slight dry cloying bite at the very end. Light carbonation, light to medium mouthfeel that is very good for the style. Two of these would go down smoothly",Russian River Brewing Company,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,100
863,7971,CaptMurdock,4.55,Big thanks to youbrewidrink for this trade.  Look: An amber hue with rays of sun pouring from the center. The head rises a good two fingers up and leaves a lovely sticky lacing throughout.  Smell: The hops take center stage and lean toward the piney side with citrus playing a supporting role here.  Taste: A very hoppy brew that works flawlessly with the biscuity malt to create the perfect taste for an IIPA. The piney nature of the initial flavors is very well balanced with the sweetness of the bittering hops. There are also fresh floral notes that really compliment the overall flavor.  Mouth feel: The carbonation is slight and perfect. The medium body is very welcoming and the mouth warms as the alcohol rolls over the tongue. Very nice.  Drinkability: The ABV is about as well hidden as your likely to find in an IIPA which makes this dangerously drinkable.,Russian River Brewing Company,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,100
863,7971,tegelaar,4.92,"Picked up a few bottles at the pub on a holiday vacation. Bottle dated 12/23.  Pours a dark hazy orange with thick foamy head. Head is golden and sparkles in the light (no really). Head goes away eventually and leaves gobs of lace on the glass. The smell is amazing - tons of hops and citrus. Reeks of farm fresh oranges. Taste is appropriately bitter and sweet with a tremendous hop kick. More citrus and honey with a small malt backbone. A true hophead's dream. Alcohol is very well hidden too. The mouthfeel is great, less thick than most DIPAs which I like. Extremely drinkable as the 500ml is gone before I even realize it. Luckily I bought a bunch! This one completely lives up to the hype.",Russian River Brewing Company,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,100
863,7971,dougofthefuture,4.75,"Bottle dated 12/23/09 picked up on a business trip. I've had this beer a few times. Better review it, as it is hard to say when I'll have it again.  S - I would usually review appearance first, but this is a beer you smell before you see. The moment the bottle is opened, the room smells like hops. After the pour it is only stronger. Pine is here, and a citrusy pineapple is hiding out as well. Are there hops floating in the bottle?  A - The appearance adds to the sense that this is a delicate beer. No floating hops, contrary to what my nose guessed. Instead, very high clarity, and just slightly amber color. The fluffy head is very slow to dissipate.  T & M - I agree with the general sentiment that pine dominates, but I remember it being even stronger in the past. I wonder if this bottle has started to fade? Either way, the strong pine and citrus hops sit well on the fragile malt backbone.  D - The final effect is the most drinkable IPA/IIPA ever created. For this alone, it deserves its reputation.",Russian River Brewing Company,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,100
863,7971,LordAdmNelson,4.47,"Gotta throw a big cheers to alleykatking (Josh) for this one. What a treat of a brew. And, it was bottled on 1/6/10, so pretty much as fresh as you can get for this one around here!  Pours a golden-tawny-orange color with moderate white head that laces nicely. Looks good for an IIPA... I tend to find darker (with a bit more amber/red notes) more visually appealing, but this one looks refreshing and delicious.  Aroma is chock full of hops, big grapefruit notes, big pine notes, big floral notes. Basically it's all hops all the time. I love it.  Taste follows the nose, although the splash of hops in this brew aren't puckeringly bitter or overwhelmingly robust. That's good, IMO. Big citrus notes initially, followed by a rush of pine and resin. I do love pine bombs. Says my buddy and fellow BA Sench: ""It should be called PINEY the Elder."" Essentially, there is very little to complain about here--clean with no off flavors. My only complaint here is that the malt backbone seems lacking. I know this isn't a barleywine and that it is a very hop-forward brew, but I tend to prefer a bit more malt in my IIPAs.  Mouthfeel on this one is oily and medium-light bodied. Not exactly creamy, but definitely crisp and refreshing. A great brew.  Drinkability is off-the-charts. If I could get this regularly, I definitely would. One of the best IIPAs, I've had. Definitely a hop-forward brew, delicious. Cheers to Josh for this one!",Russian River Brewing Company,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,100

M--Nice mf, silky.  D--I just dont enjoy over-hopped beers. The only beer that I really enjoy that is an IPA is Two-hearted, which in my humble opinion, kicks this beers ass.

863,7971,PartyBear,4.5,"Pours a hazy warm, almost golden amber colour with light carbonation and a big creamy white head.  Huge floral aroma, with lots of citric fruits, and a giant blast of piney hops, and pungent grapefruit. Very powerful aroma.  The taste starts with clean bitter hops before fading to a smooth honey caramel in the middle before coming back to the bitterness in the finish. There are flavours of grapefruit, pine, lemon, honey, and hints of biscuity malts. There is a slight warming finish but no sign of the alcohol.  The feel is silky smooth with just a touch of carbonation.  It is so incredibly drinkable, even though it has been hopped to hell it is still a perfect balance of bitter and sweet.",Russian River Brewing Company,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,100
863,7971,climax,4.5,"Bottled: 12-23-2009 Sampled: 1-16-2010  The Elder poured a golden amber, excellent clarity into my snifter. The head was quite large, good retention before I stirred it up a bit. A constant film is held atop and some nice spotty lace is an added bonus.  The initial nose is extreme hops, but more complex notes begin to sneak in as I search deeper and the beer warms. Hop profile is quite smooth and not overly soapy. Abundant resiny pine, and sweet pineapple, and grapefruit citrus are matched well by increasing toasted malt sweetness and some spiciness. Fresh fruit, caramel, and spice dance in the background.  The flavor, even being hop heavy, has excellent complexity and malt profile. The pine resin and citrus flavor take a strong hold and last throughout. The warmth of alcohol is well apparent after it hits the mouth. The malt begins to shine towards the end, toasty and sweet tones round it out before a lingering hoppy finish.  The feel is excellent, hard pressed to be better in fact. The beer coats the mouth like a jacket. Silky stickiness is held in check by the perfect amount of carbonation to keep it sharp and crisp . Body is full and chewy, the finish is long and dry. Mouthwatering at the end of every drink, this one's a champ.",Russian River Brewing Company,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,100
863,7971,zoso1967,4.75,"I have to admit, after trying to track this down for about the past year and a half, and reading all the hype, I thought I would end up being disappointed when I found this beer on tap at Teresa's Next Door in Wayne, PA . Luckily I was in for a pleasant surprise...  Served in a tulip glass, it was golden amber with some slight cloudiness, a nice sticky looking head and great lacing. Mouthwatering aroma of American hops with lots of pine notes, and some sweet bready fragrances in the background. I was blown away after one sip by how a beer with so much bitterness and hop flavor can come out so balanced. Loads of pine and white grapefruit hop flavor in the forefront, but with plenty of malt sweetness to back it up. There seemed to be a little bit of cannabis like skunkyness in the ultra dry finish that mixed in with the seemingly endless piney hop aftertaste and just the right amount of alcoholic warmth. Unlike other doubles like 90 and Hop Wallop, this beer finishes very dry, despite the amount of sweetness. This dry finish and the medium body make it all too drinkable. Vinnie has crafted a very well done beer that does a great job of distinguishing itself amongst a crowded style. Bravo!",Russian River Brewing Company,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,100
863,7971,brewerburgundy,4.27,"From the cool, mod labeled bottle with a bottled on date of 12.23.09 into a red wine glass and consumed on 1.8.10.  A pale gold, light yellow flowing to the red wine glass where it becomes golden yellow, golden rod, anodized gold/yellow. Quite clear with a white head impressive from the lupulin monster here. Looks sticky. Lots of consistently rising carb. Good looking.  Dank, chronic-like, everything in spades. Pine influenced herbs, pineapple bite, apricot, kumquat, Meyer lemon zest, blood orange, grapefruit pith, rind, and juice. Peachy.  Bitterness, moderate to high, runs backup the tongue and mouth first. Peachy, tropical fruitiness, some pineapple I'd say. Pear and the zing of an orange peel and its oil.  Like fancy bottles water, the mouthfeel is delicate and very slight on the palate. The seemingly non-existent malt bill makes this pretty damn light.  I could smell Pliny the Elder for days as perverse as that sounds, but honestly wouldn't want to drink it that long. I'd be pretty trashed. Ok, extremely trashed if I drank it for days. Add a couple more pounds of malt is my opinionated, home brewer's opinion. Just do not change the most perfect bouquet of Pliny the Elder.  Updated review 7/28/21 of beer bottled 6/22/21.

Clean and juicy. Sweet. Resiny from the hops, like a pine tree. Some pineapple, and possibly a hint of sulfur.  T: Bitter but smooth. Spicy with the fresh, dry hopped flavor disappearing to a buttery finish. Some sweetness in the palate, but it is quickly covered by the hoppiness.  M: Medium astringent, what you'd expect for an IPA. Makes the back of the tongue feel sticky.  D: Medium. A good beer for a giant IPA.

863,7971,billshmeinke,4.62,"Poured into a wine glass.  Pliny is the quintessential West Coast DIPA. Before Hazy NEIPA's were all the rage, Pliny was the gold standard. And it still is. The mouthfeel is incredible. Pillowy soft, and oh so smooth. Looks like a belgian pale ale, almost. Frothy massive white head that leaves plenty of cakey lacing behind. Clear golden body with tiny delicate bubbles spritzing up. Almost champagne like, but a darker golden color. Tastes of biscuity malts with grapefruit and pine hop notes. Bitterness is there, but nothing overwhelming. Probably middle of the pack for DIPA bitterness. Balance is great. Mouthfeel is outstanding. Looks as good as the best of them. The taste and smell are great too, but I feel like the composition in terms of look and feel is where this beer really shines. Smells of honey and lavender with an earthy hop funky dankness. Taste is similar, honey drizzled lavender biscuits with grapefruit slices. It even has a grapefruit like numbing property. Probably from the alcohol. If you can find it, try it. Even if you don't like IPA's, it's worth trying, especially fresh. It is what all DIPA's should be measured against. Pliny is the quintessential West Coast Double IPA, and it is highly unlikely that any beer will ever steal that title from it.",Russian River Brewing Company,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,100

Pours a brilliant orange with yellow highlights with a one finger that dissipates after a minute or two. Decent lacing as the beer is drank down but not too much head retention.  The smell might just be the best part of the beer. A blend of floral and citrus hops. It's crazy how aromatic this beer is. Whenever I pop one, you can smell it from atleast an arms length away. It's just awesome.  Taste is massive amounts of hops up front with a calming backbone of malt. This is the ideal taste for an IPA in my opinion. A perfect blend of sweetness from the malts and hops mixed with the bittering hops to offset it. Just perfect.  Mouthfeel is excellent. Low carbonation with a medium body. Very true to the style.  Drinkability is as high as it goes. Can get a little dangerous since the brew is clocking in at 8% though.  Overall, I'd say this was one of my first beer I had a 'holy shit!' moment with. I've had this a few times since then but it still blows my mind how perfect this beer can be.

Hazy light amber color.  Smell is of clove, pine, floral hops, kind of earthy, notes of citrus, lemon, and maybe a very faint hint of pepper.  Right up front there is a orange flavor that quickly changes to a floral bitterness, orange peel, notes of tobacco, a leathery bite, has a nice chewy mouthfeel.

863,7971,inspektor,4.92,"Bottled on 01/06/2010 Poured from a 0.5L bottle into my Great Divide Pint glass which produced an amber copperish body with a 1.5 finger off white head, which dispersed slowly, leaving traces of lacing in its place. The scent immediately lets you know that this is a DIPA of high pedigree. Astounding floral hops blended with pine lets you know you're in for a treat. The taste is one of the most perfectly balanced DIPA I've ever experienced. The malt initiates the set, while the hops follow through with the spike, powerful yet reserved and smooth. Definitely a dose of citrus which isn't over prevalent, but adds to the balance of this brew. Mouthfeel is excellent carbonation, with a medium mouthfeel. Extremely clean and crisp with no hint of alcohol which leads one to question the 8% ABV, surely this cannot be a DIPA. Extremely easy to drink, one may easily consume 3 bottles before they ABV sneaks upon you.

This is definitely about the hops. Starts out with very focused hop bitterness. Some tingle from the carbonation. No sweetness really to speak of. Some fruitness in the middle. Finishes with a lingering bitterness that is very focused. Very refreshing.  M-Carbonation is perhaps just a little too much. I was somewhat surprised a the lightness of the body considering it is 8%.  D-For 8%, about as good as it gets. Drinks almost like a 6.5% IPA IMO. Could easily drink a couple bottles in one sitting - although I'm sure the 8% would eventually catch up.  If you're looking for a double IPA with a nice balancing malt sweetness, this is not it.

High clarity, looks good.  The moment I popped the bottle, I took a whiff and was hit in the nostrils with ripe juicy mango.

A monstrous and fantastic nose, reminiscent of their similarly fantastic Blind Pig.  Flavor is likewise fantastic, seems to work perfectly with the aromas. No surprises here. Huge pine and citrus hops up front. A nice scratchy hop bitterness on the tongue, all over the place. Light cookies in the background. Big but also perfect example of a West Coast IPA. A big drying beer. Incredibly smooth. Tastes how an IPA does in my head, if that makes sense.  Good medium body with busy carbonation. No issues here.

The mouthfeel is a little thinner than I expected but that doesn't detract from the overall experience. Very drinkable beer with a complex hop flavor profile, but the beer is still very well balanced. I can see why this beer is rated as highly as it is.",Russian River Brewing Company,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,100

Appearance, whoa, straw yellow, but so damn clear, but I never like anything this color, so I can't say its exceptional. Everything else is. Delic uber (subject to deletion, not English?) hoppy resinous grapefruit make your nose hairs stand up aroma. Taste is almost like you feel your dopamine kick in and give you a physical addiction to the beer. Mouthfeel and drinkability = forever. Its got a gripload of delicious hops throughout it.

Appearance: Hazy dark golden beer with lots of fine sediment in suspension and a bright white cap that shows really nice retention and a bit of lace.  Smell: Actually more subdued than I was expecting; it's not a ""rip yer face off"" kind of beer, it seems. Nevertheless there are gorgeous citrus and pine aromas; fresh, vibrant, clean, and supremely inviting.  Taste: I'm at a loss for words here, I really am. I was unsure what to expect from Pliny, as it's a beer whose reputation precedes it. There are not unforseen flavors here, etc. It's got the typical citrus/pine notes of the best American IPAs; they're fresh and juicy with just a touch of dry maltiness in the background. There's nothing outrageous here; rather, everything is in perfect balance. This is fresh, with just a hint of hoppy sharpness. Alcohol levels are hidden dangerously well, and while the bitterness is substantial, it's not overly aggressive or overwhelming. Pliny just puckers the mouth slightly and makes you want another sip.  Mouthfeel: Medium-heavy and supremely smooth.  Drinkability: High  Conclusion: It's a legend; I'm so glad I finally got to try this. Thanks SO much to Tolann for this, what an awesome trade. I can honestly say that this is everything I was expecting and more (and I was afraid that I would be disappointed because of the hype that this beer carries with it).",Russian River Brewing Company,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,100

A: Great golden color, with a thin head (beige? off-white, at least) and decent lacing. Exceptional clarity in spite of the beer's sparkling nature. Fantastic.  S: Wow... nothing quite like this. Strong pine and citrus scent, but nothing overbears. Each time I smell it, it's wonderful. High character!  T: Pine right off the bat, on the tip of the tongue, side of the tongue, doesn't matter. BUT, it's assisted with ye ol' citrus flavor. Hop characters all around, but there's a sweetness underneath that keeps it balanced and... seriously, this beer is amazing.  M: Body may be a little thin, but there's really good carbonation. The alcohol has no presence, greatly hidden. Aftertaste: fantastic.  D: Gimmie some more! To give you an idea: the store I bought this at put a limit to 4 per customer, because otherwise it'd never be in stock. High drinkability.  Overall/notes: I drank this and watched In Bruges.

Poured with a very persistent head that settled to a thick lace. With just a swirl of the tulip glass the head would form back up nicely. The nose is intense with lots of pine and citrus, great malts to balance. On the palate the hops are aggressive but work well into the overall richness, body, and complexity of this beer.

M: Bitter, yet slightly sweet. Med carbonation give an nice refreshing sensation. D: I could drink it all night! I wish this was available in VA.

Average lacing also but afterall, lacing is nice to look at, not really indicative of anything I'm concerned about. The bubbles marched like ants, in perfect line and cadence, all the way up the sides of the glass.  S: Enormous and somehow (almost miraculously) tame hop aroma.

There are esters of pineapple and pear that only add more complexity.  The mouthfeel is so smooth and rich. I really couldn't ask for a smoother drinking DIPA. The alcohol is very-well hidden and it finishes suprisingly dry enough that I could keep putting these away if only it was sold in the area.  A truly solid DIPA.

The color reminds me of a tropical, thirst quenching elixir, which is arguably pretty close to its essence.  The Aroma of PtE is arguably its most standout quality. Tropical fruits (mango) are prominent with some floral notes scattered about. Beneath this sweet hoppy aroma are some undertones of pine.  The taste is very smooth, with no astringency at all. Some tropical fruit and biscuit malt is noticeable as well. PtE really showcases the sweet, refreshing, and crisp qualities, that hops can impart to a beer. Malt sweetness definitely plays a supporting role, and there is only the smallest touch of lingering bitterness on the aftertaste. There is some pleasant alcohol warming at the end of the swallow.  Lightly carbonated with a thin body, but perfect for the refreshing nature of this beer.

Pours a lighter than average, clear golden straw color with pillowy head that rises to the top of the glass and leaves sheets of lacing down the glass.  Nose is downright spectacular - full of tropical fruits (pineapple, mango, tangerine), citrus fruits (grapefruit, orange, lemon), floral hops, and a hint of pine resin, all backed by the most delicate of malt bases... pure artistry.  Coming from such a glorious nose, the taste is a bit of a let-down though in no way is it faulty. The fruit flavors are dialed down to meet a beefier, though still restrained, light malt base. Hints of pine and flowers. Moderate bitterness starts in the middle and lingers into the finish, it's not punishing like some but aiming for balance. Nothing over the top but it seems like there could be a bit more of everything and still be balanced - I'm thinking that what the tap version would taste like - fresh, balanced, big.

Pours a rich gold with a white head that dropped to a film, but left lots of lace on the way down. Good retention. The aroma is massive, full of mango, pineapple, grapefruit, pine and toffee. Its massively enticing and one of the best I've come across on an imperial IPA or any other type of beer.  The flavour is very good, but not as vibrant as the nose. The bottle is two months old, and while not super-fresh I'd expect it to hold up a little better if there has been some degradation. That said, this is still a solid four out of five in my books. Resing hops combine with citrus, though much of the tropical fruit has dropped out to reveal a caramel / biscuit base. Decent bitterness is bracing and lingers in the finish. Medium body and carbonation is well suited for the style.  This is a very nice imperial IPA, but I'm gonna go against the flow and say its not in the very top tier for the style. The nose held huge promise, and while the flavour delivered on some of it, the vibrancy was a bit lacking. I'm sure this would be a killer fresh on tap.

Appearance: A nice double IPA amber color, with a bubbly thin white head leaving solid lacing.  Smell: Mouth-watering citrus hops. Grapefruit and tangerine. Some pine in there too. Nice, complicated hop profile. I'm excited.  Taste: Bitter as hell, as those pine and citrus hops have their day. I'm picking up the grapefruit more than anything else. There's a bit of tropical sweetness underneath. The whole thing is way more subdued than I'd have guessed from the smell and reputation. That's not a problem, just not quite what I was expecting. Very yummy.  Mouthfeel: Medium bodied, and more crisp than any dIPA that I've had. Refreshing.  Drinkability/Overall: I can't taste the alcohol whatsoever. Another one of the dIPAs I'd drink all day, every day.  It's amazing, and it earns its sterling reputation. Still, it doesn't quite take the dIPA crown for me (DFH 90 Minute still wins).

863,7971,woosterbill,4.83,"Review #100. Big thanks to sed777 for hauling this all the way from CA for my first in-person trade. First trade, first Pliny, top-ten beer, first morning review. I'm excited.  500ml bottle, bottled on 10/08/09, into a Duvel tulip.  A: Deep, rich, slightly hazy body with perfectly light carbonation, topped by a two-finger head of dense white foam. Impressive retention and a uniform spiderweb of feathery lace all around the glass. I honestly can't imagine a better looking DIPA - it's just dark enough to suggest body, but light enough to promise a whole-hearted hop attack. Beautifully clingy lacing really ties the whole package together. Wonderful.  S: Ahh, hops. How do I love thee? While it's tough to count all the ways, this beer reminds me of several right off the bat: ripe citrus (mostly grapefruit, but also some orange zest), cleanly aromatic pine that becomes more pronounced midway through, and always just a hint of smoothly sweet tropical fruit - pineapple? The pine definitely stands out as the dominant aroma, though, and it a good way - it's amazingly fresh and inviting. My expectations were almost certainly impossibly high for this beer, but the only way it lets me down is in a slight lack of intensity. The smell is fantastic, but I really have to dive in to the glass to pick up everything. Still, a fantastic display of the versatility of hops.  T: Whoa. I was not ready for that. Everything I smelled in this beer I'd smelled before (if not in the same proportions), but this just delivered a full-force judo slap to my tongue. I don't even know what to say about the first sip, other than holy shit. I can't wait to see how this develops. As I go along, I continue to be amazed at two things: the sheer piney intensity of bitterness that sets the back of my tongue on delicious fire, and the fact that this amount of bitterness is in no way unpleasant. A couple other major hop-bombs I've had have been so over the top as to be distasteful (I'm looking at you, Hop-15), but this manages to surpass anything else I've had in terms of sheer hoppiness without turning me off at all. But I digress. As I get further into the glass, I find that the pine (while maintaining dominance) starts to give way just enough to let some bright-tasting grapefruit rind come into play, as well as a decidedly smoother touch that even starts to incorporate just the faintest hint of lightly toasty malt. This in no way detracts from the supremely dry, puckering, finish, but makes the beer all the more drinkable. Simply amazing.  M: Nice, round medium body with extremely fine, delicate carbonation - just not quite enough of it for me to give it full marks. Still, a great-feeling beer.  D: Hands-down the highest flavor-to-drinkability ratio I've ever encountered (especially among hop-bombs). If I were ever going to attempt suicide by beer, this would be what I'd turn to to down the requisite gallons. Unbelievable.  Notes: I might move to California just so I could get this beer fresh as often as possible. I don't know how comparatively old 8 weeks is for this one, but the label's incessant harping on freshness makes me all the more desirous of tasting this straight from the bottling line. Hugely hoppy, hugely flavorful, hugely complex, and hugely drinkable, this is a brew that deserves all the accolades it receives. I'm so glad that my foray into trading over BA resulted in such an incredible beer experience. Thanks to BA, Scott, Vinnie, and, of course, Pliny.

Inch-high head that sticks around, leaving lots of thick and sticky lace around the glass. Head is a creamy off-white.  Tropical and pungent fruit aromas, along with piney hop character in the nose. The citrus fruit smell is certainly dominant and smells exceptional.  Hoppy flavor, but certainly balanced. The fruit flavors come at the end and make the sides of my mouth pucker. Along with the brilliant hop bitterness, I taste grapefruit, pineapple and lemon. An exceptionally balanced and drinkable DIPA; the alcohol is hidden exceptionally well; well done!  Incredibly drinkable, perhaps too drinkable? Not heavy or thick in the mouth, goes down quickly and easily; this beer is absolutely refreshing, which I wouldn't often say about a DIPA.",Russian River Brewing Company,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,100
863,7971,oceanman,4.54,"Bottled 10/21/09, opened 11/29/09. Pours a rich copper color with off-white head. Soft but vivid aromas of pine, floral (lavender), bubble gum, vanilla, with a dank, leafy undertone. Palate shows same floral/grassy notes, sharpened considerably by the bitterness. Mild carbonation, smooth feel for such a broad, rich palate. Very flavorful, but not a palate-wrecker. 500 ml will leave you wanting more.",Russian River Brewing Company,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,100
863,7971,Chinon01,3.62,Appearance - 49er football helmet color with soapy spotty lacing. Implies a tempting density and mouthfeel.  Nose- Sticky weed resin with malt sweetness lying on top.  Taste - Similar to nose with some tropical fruit and lemon. Bone dry finish with lingering hop presence. Malt disappears quickly revealing solely hop in finish. Not balanced.  Mouthfeel & Drink - Thinner than I thought it would be but it works. Hops are aggressive. Drinkability is limited due to aggresive hoppiness but not awful.,Russian River Brewing Company,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,100
863,7971,nerow,4.73,"Had on tap at Fathers Office II in LA.  A-Dark Golden color, beautiful, creamy, thick, one inch head. Lovely lacing.  S-Citrus hops, slightly grassy, moderate pine as well.  T-Begins with some tropical fruits and pine, followed by a mellow grassy flavor and finishes with a charming citrus. Nice subtle sweetness across all parts of the tasting experiance makes this the best rounded IPA I've ever drank.  M-Superlative. Creamy, refreshing. Wow.  D-Entirely too high for a brew with 8% ABV. The alcohol was buried amongst the complex rich flavors.  I've been waiting for a long time to try this beer, and it certainly didn't disappoint. This is one of the overall best balanced beers I've had, with no weaknesses discernible in any area. A standout for sure in terms of the taste, it's wonderful that Russian River didn't succumb to the typical California brewing philosophy of IBU's over flavor. It also complimented my meal extremely well, and didn't overwhelm the subtle flavors of my Office Burger. Supremely drinkable.

863,7971,mattp,4.84,"Had it on tap lst week at the Falling Rocks Tap House in Denever while in Colorado for work. Really great beer bar.  The pint was a orange/bronzy color with a touch of haze. Hopalicious aroma! Citrus, pine-you name it. As expected the hops were the first thing noted when tasting the Pliny, which then yielded to an earthy fruitiness as the pint went on. Yummy. Even though it was 8% I was happy to have a couple of pints in fairly quick succession.

It was served to me in a goblet, golden in color,thick creamy head. Many citrus notes, orange,lemon perhaps grapefruit. The mouthfeel was so very smooth. This is 8%ABV, you sure could have fooled me.

Golden orange and clear in color  Smell: Strong, fresh and rich hop aroma that is a combination of pine and sweet hops, smells like walking through a hop field even though I have never but that is what I would imagine it to smell.  Taste: Opens with a strong piney hop profile which becomes slightly grassy and tangy/sour in the middle as a green and bitter hop profile finishes the beer leaving a mildly hoppy aftertaste. The flavors in this are very nicely balanced and rich and complex.  Mouthfeel: Medium bodied with moderate carbonation, smooth and slightly dry on the finish.  Drinkability: I would have this again and recommend this to those who need to try the gold standard for IPA's.

863,7971,velosuds,5,"Edit 3/17/2011: I never get tired of this beer. I have enjoyed it amazingly fresh (bottled direct from the brewery 3 days after bottling) and many times as much as 2 months old. This has been amazingly consistent for a DIPA. Perhaps my favorite beer. Hands down, hands up, hands tied behind my back. No cliché is wasted on this magnificent brew. Absolutely delicious. My only regret is I can't get it on demand. Awesome beer, worthy of all its accolades.  Poured from a 500ml bottle into a clear pint glass. Bottled on 11/09/09. Purchased at 99 Bottles in Federal Way, WA.  A-Pours a gorgeous golden-orange color with a two+ finger, bone white head with great retention and copious, sticky lacing. Beautiful appearance. Nearly perfect.  S-Floral and citrus hops are wonderfully fragrant. The aroma is almost intoxicating. I love this beer.  T-God, I love this beer. Very well balanced, yet complex. Hops are aggressive without overpowering the taste buds since it is balanced by a delicate malt sweetness that is absolutely delicious. A real treat. No bitter after taste and alcohol content is hardly noticeable for its 8% ABV. Extremely well constructed.  M-Very smooth and extremely well balanced. Carbonation is perfect.  D-Dangerously smooth given ABV. Tastes great cold and as it warms.

I got this bottle in a shipment from South Bay Drugs, bottle date is 10/21.  Poured from a bottle into my Harpoon IPA shaped glass. Pours with a nice white head and had very nice lacing down the glass.  Aroma is exceptional, the floral and citrusness of the hops is wonderful.  Taste is also exceptional. The citrusness and the grapefruit flavors are nicely balanced with the bitterness.  Very good drinkability, I could have a few of these if I had more.  Overall, after having this the first time this became the beer I measure all other IPA's to. A few come close but Pliny remains a world class beer in my opinion.

I love this place. Shared with capra12. Poured from a 16oz. bottle dated 10/08/09 into a Brooklyn Brewery pint glass.  A: Gentle pour yields a huge 4 finger fine, white, fluffy head with retention like I've never seen before. Brew is a semi-clear, partly cloudy grapefruit that reveals moderate carbonation. Lacing is second to none, marking ever sip that we take.  S: Sweet grassy grapefruit and other citrus notes, hops, and a slight yeastiness that is barely detectable.  T: Light hoppiness that is very clean and pure. Hops and malts build and mingle towards the middle and do so in an incredibly balanced manner. Finish is slightly sweet and subtly hoppy, leaving a nice hop aftertaste.  M: Light to medium bodied and smooth as hell. Mouthfeel is watery and finishes wet and messy Mouthfeel lingers but it only adds to the taste of your next sip.  D: Really the definition of drinkability.

Just fabulous.  Bright and crisp hops dominate this beer. Lots of citrus and some pine. Lots of grapefruit, not unlike straight up grapefruit juice. Some pineapple, a bit of grassiness. Nice grapefruit aftertaste makes me go back for more. Tasty as can be!  Some active carbonation on the palate. Crisp and refreshing. Extremely dry finish with a nice hop bite on the tongue. Lighter than medium bodied.  Unbelievable that this is 8% as it is not detected at all. So tasty and easy to drink. I would buy this beer all the time if I had access to it.

Hoppy, but not overpowering at all. Served around room temp.  M: Good overall.  D: Very drinkable, but not quite the IPA I'm used to here on the east cost. Very enjoyable. Maybe for all the hype, I found myself a tiny bit disappointed.  Like the damnation I had the same night, I've heard so much hype about Russian River beers that I just had to try this one out. Either the bar I visited where I sampled this (and the tap system) didn't do this beer justice, or I'll have to try this beer a lot closer to the brewery itself for a more fitting review.  Update: 9//18/15. Bought a bottle from the brewpub. Bottled on dat was 9/3/15. Kept cold & refrigerated. Poured into tulip glass. So freaking good. Aroma is like a bouquet of hop flowers. Classic pine & citrus hops. Nice white foamy head with ample lacing. Superbly drinkable at 8.0% ABV. So glad I had this fresh.

863,7971,Lunch,4.5,"Served from a 16.9oz. bottle (bottled on 10/08/09) (thanks to davidsk for the trade) into my new Russian River goblet at around 45 degrees (11/17/09).  A: Pours a slightly hazy golden color with a slight orange hue capped out with a nice and chunky two finger head with decent retention and exceptional spider lacing.  S: An incredible bouquet of pine, flowers, grapefruit, and tropical fruit with a delicious nectary hop scent and just slight hint of malt. One of the best smelling beers there is.  T: The smell continues into the taste which assaults the palate with an aggressive hop profile of pine, flowers, grapefruit, and tropical fruit with a slight bitterness in the finish which pleasantly lingers. A hint of sweet malt is there, but it is very slight (wish there was a bit more).  M: Medium-bodied with low carbonation and an oily slick mouthfeel that coats the tongue.  D: Even with a 8% abv. this beer is extremely drinkable as the alcohol is completely hidden and the flavors work so well together. This is a beer one could session.  Overall this is an excellent beer that falls just short of its hype for me. Don't get me wrong, this is certainly one of the top DIPAs in my mind, but it has me thinking that the malt found in some east coast DIPAs (Otter Creek Imperial IPA) perhaps adds an additional dimension. Maybe, since this was my first venture into the world of Pliny the Elder, my tastes need to develop further (luckily I have five more). Highly recommended.  Looking back at this review has me embarrassed as fuck...that last paragraph is just sad.",Russian River Brewing Company,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,100

It smells like... stepping outdoors. It's medium bodied, minerally and crisp. The finish is clean. It's nice and bitter with a full hop flavor. There are notes of flowers, grass, herbs and fresh ground black pepper. This is how a double IPA should taste.

Everything else at this point forward is a bonus. Ok, I'll drink it. This beer has been described at great lengths before me so at this point it is redundant to add to the pile.

A - Probably poured a bit too vigourously, but I get 2 finger width of head and the foam is very chunky. The lacing on the glass is phenomenal. It's a murky golden color. The head dissolves into a thin layer after a few minutes the continues to linger.  S - Delightful, hops balanced by sweet floral notes. A little bit of pine; this is great!  T - Slight grapefruit taste with lots of floral accents and some pine. A little bit of hop bitterness on the back end. This is pretty much the benchmark in tastes for Double IPAs.

863,7971,deapokid,4.17,"Tried on tap at Tria on Tuesday evening (reviewed from notes):  Served in a goblet, which is quite the presentation for an IPA, this rarity is a golden yellow with a firm, one finger head. The dim lighting at the bar gives it an otherworldly glow and, I must say, that I'm really excited to sip on this brew.  Aromas range from orange and tangerine to hops and hard candy. Scent is never strong or coarse, giving off a full-bodied sweetness that is rather enchanting.  Profound hop flavor is surprisingly well balanced for its strength, packing ripe citrus flavors before unleashing a hop explosion. Unlike Stone's Ruination (which I often consider my favorite double IPA), the hop character doesn't scratch the palate and is felt more in the nose than on the tongue.  The liquid itself is gentle to the tongue and the shift in tone occurring in the flavor never disrupts the overall oral experience.  For something with such a strong hop flavor and an 8% ABV, this little number maintains a high level of drinkability, due mostly to its well-masked booziness and a refreshing dose of citrus fruit.  After trying this mythic ale on three separate occasions, I must officially admit that all the hype isn't just internet gossip.

S - Nice any hoppy right up front with bright citrus, pineapple, and fresh grass notes.  T - Bright grapefruit tight up front without being too powerful, then revealing a depth of citrus (light lemon and tangerine), tropical fruit, and delicate floral flavors. Some malt and a nice nuttiness are revealed in the finish. Really beautifully layered and complex. Pleasingly bitter, but with a soft sweetness. Really well balanced DIPA.

It doesnt leave you with a bitter taste in your mouth like some IPA's do.

N: Like waking in a campsite surrounded by Douglas firs, stepping outside the tent and taking a big huff of the dewy air. Also hints of grapes, apricots and apples.  T: The fruits really come out strong in the taste as well but the bitterness of the hops adds something to chew on. The flavors are well-balanced with the fruitiness leading into the lingering bitterness of hops providing the finish.  M: Solid, heavy. Each swig is an experience, not to be taken lightly.

Appearance- Pours into my snifter with a nice finger and a half of head over an amber body with lots of carbonation drifting up out of the bottom of the glass. Pretty good head retention and it sticks around before dying back to a thin skin over the top of the beer. Active carbonation throughout though.  Smell- Lots of big fruity hops on the nose. Huge notes of orange and grapefruit rind. A big ole' punch of hops in the face. Very nice and speaks of good things to come.  Taste- Like a big hoppy, orangey, grapefruity creamsicle. Huge fruity hops dominate again on the flavor profile. Big, flavorful DIPA. Malt mildly evident though a touch in the creaminess. Very nice.  Mouthfeel/Drinkability- Slick, well carbonated, and dangerously drinkable. If you like hops, this is for you.  Overall, a very well crafted DIPA. Deserving of its reputation.

863,7971,drabmuh,4.72,"Beer poured a bottle dated 10/08/09, so its a month old. Pretty good for a trade (THANKS!). Beer served in a goblet. Beer is yellow and hazy, carbonation is mild to moderate. A white head of medium sized bubbles formed but the head collapsed. There is some lacing left on the glass, even after the head collapses. Head gravitates toward the walls of the glass.  Beer has that sweet pine smell of hops. This is a double IPA but I don't smell any malt really. Not any alcohol either.  This beer tastes wonderful. The hops are obvious but the beer overall is so smooth, its amazing. Some of these hop bombs leave an acidic taste in the back of the mouth. Finishes cleanly but the beer in general leaves a film all over you mouth. Second taste, its almost as if it finishes dry but starts wet. The beer isn't dry at all, but its finish is so nice.  Mouthfeel is great. There is plenty of flavor to connect some (the tiny amount) of sweetness at the front with the hop bitterness and flavor. Its so good. Medium body, can't taste the alcohol at all. Drinkability very high. This is one of the best DIPAs I've ever had in my life. I wish this were sold locally.

863,7971,cvstrickland,4.87,"One Duvel glass, one chilled slope-shouldered brown bottle courtesy of Murchmac, my 1964 Schlitz can punch and bottle opener, and it's on...  Good Lord. Upon the crack of the crown a tornadic wisp of cold steam emerges from the bottlemouth reeking of fruity-green goodness. What the Hell? Maybe it's hop-smoke?  A slow pour yields a brew with a sparkling-clear body that matches the color and brightness of an electrified tangerine, capped with a solid two-finger deep topping of creamy white atop. As the bubble crown recedes ever so slightly, it plasters the innards of my tulip glass with a ragged film of the spongy polished-ivory foam. Fluffy rings adhere to the sip-lines, connected to one another by that same scattershot sheet of lacing.  The aroma that greets my nose is of mildly medicinal green citrus, green chiba, green pine needles, green herbs, green grass, Hell, maybe even green giants. It's stunning to me that not one iota of maltiness, no caramel, no toast, no cereal, no nothing passes the Green Monster-sized green wall of juicy green hop essence. Uh, yeah, Murch, I think they're plenty fresh.  Wow, I'm actually nervous about finally getting a taste of this legend, but here goes... I am once again amazed as my first long pull of Pliny is silky-soft and creamy-smooth, and otherwise pretty damned wonderful. Hop notes abound, to say the least. Grassy, evergreen bitterness and stickiness a-go-go bitchslap a dryly toasted malt base deep into the nether regions of darkest outer space. Malt? Malt who? What malt? This thing is little more than a hop-juice delivery vehicle, which works just fine for me. Persistent notes of dried pine rosin, freshly-cut grass and bitter citrus peel oil provide a one-two-three combo punch in the mouth, but in a nice and friendly fashion that I'd be happy to get smacked around by anytime.  The drink is medium-bodied with heft, silkiness, and extremely fine carbonation. A sticky trace that I perceive as hop oils lingers on my palate long after the drink is long gone. Eminently drinkable, Pliny is indeed 'all that', and walks the talk in spades, big-time. Thanks for the opportunity, Tim.

863,7971,MrDanno96,4.83,"Received in a trade with bret27. This will be my first RR experience. Thanks Bret!  A: Pours a clear golden amber color with about 2 fingers of foamy head that exhibits pretty good retention. It looks like you could balance coins on the foam. Lots of sticky lacing on the sides of the glass.  S: Big aggressive hops aroma with pine, pineapple, and grapefruit. Definitely a double IPA by scent, but I'm impressed with the amount of sweetness that finds its way through as well. My mouth is starting to water...  T: Quite similar to the nose. Grapefruit, grains, and pine upfront give way to some very strong hops and some citrus in the finish. While the hops flavor is definitely quite pronounced and bitter, it is extremely well balanced with the sweeter flavors and doesn't leave you with an extremely long lasting bitter aftertaste like a lot of others IPAs do. As far as IPAs and DIPAs go, I don't think taste is getting much better than this.  M: Medium body with a moderate amount of carbonation. The hops leave the sides of your tongue tingling and asking for more. Some warming effects from the alcohol help finish off a nice feel.  D: Extremely drinkable. You could either sip this slowly and appreciate the great balance between bitter and sweet or session a few in a row, though the alcohol content will catch up to you pretty quick.

Super clear golden with a giant fluffy white white, which settles down to a solid 1/4"" that hangs around. Tons of sticky lace. Aroma is sweet hops coming forward as pineapple and other vaguely tropical smells. The flavor is super juicy, hops, sugary lemons and pineapple, despite initially sweet, it finishes dry, tangy and lightly acidic along the sides of my tongue. The ABV leaves a light tingle.

863,7971,darklordlager,4.72,"Tasted alongside Coronado IPA for comparison  A:Pours a clear golden bronze, with a 1/2"" bright white head. A little resiny lacing, nothing too notable. Some lacing as it goes down the glass.  S: Smell is of fresh skunky hops! This smells like a wet-hopped beer. Whiff of its cousin, grapefruit, all kinds of citrus. Grapefruit rind is up front and center. Slight lingering malt (which knows it's place--in the background), just there to provide the hops some company. A bit more honey-like sweetness that I remember than last time around.  T: Mmmm. If a Double IPA's hop profile could be harsh and smooth at the same time--this is it. The bitterness is almost indistinguishable from the dry hopped leafy citrus, yet both are there in droves. Smacking bitterness up front, a little sweet malt and citrus, then the bitterness comes back, lingering long into the aftertaste. Amen.  M: A little more carbonation than I'm used to, but works well for keeping that incredible hop flavour moving along.  D: Sweet baby Jesus. Bittering Hops, meet Dry hops. Meld together, produce beautiful children, intermingle, become one. This is fantastic, I wish it was more available.  I was not disappointed upon cracking the Coronado (situational enjoyment, perhaps?), but this just blows it out of the water. The only thing that I would protest (slightly) is the carbonation. However, this is from someone longing for the cask ale that was enjoyed a few months (far too long) ago...",Russian River Brewing Company,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,100
863,7971,Intelligentsia,4.73,"Can't believe I haven't yet reviewed this beer. One of my first great IPAs I ever had. While I've had it on tap and prefer it slightly over its bottled brethren, I'm reviewing Pliny poured from a 500mL bottle chilled. Bottled 10-21-09.  It pours a marvelous tangerine bronze with a very fluffy white head leaving behind delicate lacing that looks very sticky. Definitely a beauty.  Smells like heaven. Straw, citrus, pine, caramel but not in any overpowering way. A very understated nose, though. Lovely.  Tastes of grapefruit, straw, pine, resin, alcohol as it warms up.  I've had this on tap several times and always recalling it having just a bit more than when bottled. I'll have to review it next time I see it.  With very low carbonation and a slight mouthfeel. Definitely one of the most quaffable beers out there.  Bottom line: you're not going to do a lot better. I still get excited when I see it.",Russian River Brewing Company,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,100
863,7971,BarrytheBear,4.48,"Nice pale orange pour with a island mass of fluffy clouds that sits atop the surface.  Smells like summer...straw, grass, hints of lemon rind, and sugared orange candy slices.  Tastes of mild grapefruit up front. A pleasant bitterness follows and wraps around the tongue. This bitter grip follows, not unpleasantly, into a firm tingling in the cheeks. Finishes grapefruit, orange, and grassy with a remaining long lasting tingle.  Sticky, oily, resinous mouthfeel that lingers long after the sip. So very drinkable at 8 %. Carbonation on the low end.  Drinkability is through the roof.",Russian River Brewing Company,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,100
863,7971,californiakulak,4.32,"I bought this beer in San Fransisco and poured it into an Anchor Steam pint glass.  A. It poured a little lighter than I had expected. It was a goldish orange color with a little haziness. I got a two inch head that was thick and lasted for a long time. There was beautiful lacing all the way down the glass.  S. The second that I opened the bottle I was overwhelmed with the pine like hop aroma. I smelled a lot of citrusy notes a subtle amount of biscuity scents.  T. Like the smell the taste is loaded with wonderful hop bitterness. Citrusy and pugnent.  M. A perfect amount of carbonation. A dry bitter finish.  D. This beer is very drinkable. The alcohol is hidden well behind layers of hop and malt flavors. Overall this is just a great beer. I had extremely high expectations when I opened this beer, which usually spells disappointment for me, but this time it more than lived up. Great beer.",Russian River Brewing Company,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,100
863,7971,anchordrinker,4.74,"Finally, my favorite beer in growler form!  A- Orange-gold in appearance with a small head that dissipates pretty quickly.  S- Sweet and citric aromas dominate, with some herbal, floral, and piney undertones  T- Sweet and pungent fruity and citric flavors up front, followed by sweet caramel maltiness that balances the sharper citric flavors until a satisfying bitterness cleans up at the end. It's hard to imagine a beer with a more complex and enjoyable flavor profile. I think it gets even better as it moves closer towards room temperature.  M- Really delicate, fine carbonation, of which I would not want more or less. It strikes me as being pretty damn light in body for 8%, but without that consideration I'd call it medium-light bodied.  D- Unbelievably drinkable. In fact, I've yet to find something as drinkable that even approaches the complexities in this beer.  This one is as good as it gets.",Russian River Brewing Company,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,100
863,7971,NoahSYGG,4.94,"As a lover of the american IPA, this is superb. Thanks to the kind heart of Rick at Big Z beverage in Huntington, I was able to try this beer. It had a wonderful piney hop aroma. It was probably the best smelling beer hopwise that I have ever experienced. The color was a cloudy orange with a nice head. The flavor was extremely balanced. The flavor of the hops was not overpowering nor was it too bitter. The malt flavor was hidden by the hops which was ok for me because the hop flavor was so explosive. This is a must try for any IPA fan. I could drink this IPA all day. Russian River is amazing.",Russian River Brewing Company,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,100
863,7971,wnh,4.25,"500 mL bottle poured into a Goose Island snifter.  Pours a rich copper-amber hue, clear despite chunks of suspended sediment due to the lack of filtration, with a thick, creamy light tan head that sticks around for the duration of the glass.  Aromas of pine resin and juicy tropical fruit--primarily pineapple, with mango and grapefruit zest--on top of a rich caramel malt backbone on the nose. Very well balanced on the palate, with very little bitterness that lingers ever so slightly. Smooth and silky with a quick, short finish.  This is a very well-made beer, make no mistake, but over hyped in my opinion. Quite balanced, but I prefer a DIPA that clearly leans toward the hoppy side.",Russian River Brewing Company,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,100
863,7971,vidisad,4.77,"This is my very first beer review. This is my second IPA beer to try ever. First IPA I ever tried was Stone's Ruination. After first glass I had it enough, couldn't finish it. After reading so many favorable reviews for the Elder I couldn't wait to find it and give it a try. This morning I made a special 20mi trip to WholeFoods in Cupertino to get my hand on this iconic beer. I got two 500ml bottles. Rest of the day i was running around and had Round Table Veggie Gourmet pizza for lunch. I didn't drink anything afterwards sparing my thirst for the Elder. What a drinkable beer. I keep asking myself is it because of my thirst? Couldn't believe I would like an IPA so much. After second bottle I still like it very much. So different than my stouts and strong ales, bur lovely beer. Light, hoppy, citrusy, carbonated but overall very well balanced beer. Love it very much so far. I'll have it chilled when i'm thirsty.",Russian River Brewing Company,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,100
863,7971,jzeilinger,4.74,"Was on the west coast last week on business and finally had a chance to try this very sought after D-IPA. Had on tap and also in the bottle, I much prefer the tap version, for this review, it's a bottle version.  Poured a hazy bright orange in my glass with no head and ever so slight lacing around the glass. I was surprised, I thought a double IPA of this magnitude would have been a little darker, it's quite light colored. The smell of this brew is what I really love, it wreaks of grapefruit, pine, slight apricot (but very, very faint). The aroma of this beer is among the hoppiest I've ever smelled, typical of the west coast IPA style and exactly the style of IPA's that I've grown to love so much. At the first sip there's a very quick undertone of malt followed by the same piney citrus notes picked up by your nose. The malt is just faint enough underneath as the hops roll over the top of your tongue to show the malts who's boss here! The mouthfeel is medium to light medium body and just a hint of carbonated bubbles hit the tongue as it goes down. I would prefer more texture on my tongue as it's a little on the thin side. This beer is incredibly drinkable and one that I would love to keep in my fridge year around. Unfortunately, being on the east coast, this one is a little tougher to find.  I did purchase a case of this last week in California and brought it home, I was very surprised at how reasonably priced it was considering the status of this beer. Granted, it wasn't cheap, but for what I paid for it, it definitely was reasonable. Pliny is exceptional, but with the number of talented brewers out there, it definitely stands out in the crowd but not heads and shoulders above the rest. It's perhaps a little bit hyped but I have to say I really enjoyed it. If you're not a hop head, run away, this beer isn't for you. I absolutely love this one.",Russian River Brewing Company,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,100
863,7971,BDLbrewster,4.94,"Thanks a Fuk-ton to my Cali connect for this gem!! Bryanbrick, you sir are my hero.  Pours a wonderful hazy pumpkin hued pale yellow color. Small frothy head that dissipates very quickly leaving gobs of sticky lacing all around my glass. Lots of tiny bubbles rise gracefully to the surface.  Ahhh... The nose is super ripe with massive amounts of citric grapefruit goodness. Smells like pure pink grapefruit juice on crack, passionfruit also comes to mind after numerous whiffs. Some subtle pine and very little else. Any hint of malt that might be there is buried under miles of fruity goodness.  Simply amazing. A quick burst of sweet, very lightly caramelized malt on the very front of the tongue. Next in line is an unprovoked tongue fuck of sweetened grapefruit juice saturated with tiny nibs of pine needle. Not the type of pine that make you think pinesol, but the kind that makes you think over-ripe mango. For how unnoticed the malt goes in this brew, it really does a spectacular job of supporting the crazy amount of citrus this brew carries. Surprisingly the finish carries very little residual bitterness for a big DIPA. Once again I am just amazed.  I rarely say this, but the mouthfeel is something out of a flippin fairy tale. Not syrupy in the least and luxurious, yeah, I said it. Luxurious. This brew is sooo light in my mouth, I feel like I am drinking a mich ultra (this is the only time I will ever say that in a good context.)  Overall, wow. 8%? Really... I mean really??? 8, I mean come the fuck on. Balanced is not always a good word when it comes to DIPA's. Pliny is balanced, but in an extremely good way. I wish I could put how I feel about this beer into words. But I can't, I can only think of one word to explain my relationship with Pliny. Wow.",Russian River Brewing Company,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,100
863,7971,Offa,4.88,"This is my review for PLiny the lder on tap, in which form it is simply an incredible beer, by far the greatest double IPA I have ever had. I'm not just saying this because it's from my hometown, either, for this beer amazingly combines assertive hop character with firm maltiness, yet restraint, incredible balance, and a perfect feel that is neither to heavy nor too thin.  It's beautiful, like most Russian River beers. Pale amber - deep gold with a copper hint - it has a big, creamy, long-lasting, faintly off-white white head that shrinks very slowly to a smaller permanent creamy layer. It usually has great even rings of nice lace, though occasionally the lace is weaker.  The aroma has a definite traditional west-coast IPA quality to it, but is unusually complex and balanced. It has light grapefruit and resin/pine, but actually the overall character is predominantly fresh muscat grapes, plus a little general citrus, raisin, and hint of pineapple. It smells fragrant and sweet but rather restrained.  The taste is an incredible masterwork of balance and integration, with lots of hop character plus a firm malty base, bitterness and sweetness in equal balance. Always on the verge of just becoming bitter, esp. in the immediate finish, it never actually quite goes there. Overall, it has balanced character of fruity, toasty-bready, slightly raisiny malt married harmoniously with cirusy, leafy hops, vigin elements of light raisiny, faintly caramelly, toasty bread, citrus, leafiness, resininess, and a mix of orange marmalade, lemon, grapefruit. All of it is so well-integrated and balanced, though, that it forms a unified, balanced, consistent whole from start to finish.  The fel is incredible, being just slightly oily enough to give slight slickness and fullness, without being sticky or syrupy, and retaining a light, lively character.  I find that many double IPAs are far too sweet and syrupy while others are overly aggressive in their bitterness and almost all are other one-dimensional, tossing aside complexity and balance for simple lop-sided strength. This beer suffers from none of those problems.",Russian River Brewing Company,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,100
863,7971,berley31,4.55,"A: Poured with a large, white, frothy head that hung around for a bit before easing down to 1/2-finger or so. Body is a really nice-looking golden orange color, and hazy.  S: Oh yeah, now that's a strong-smelling IPA! Average hops (actually not overpowering at all) that are very perfumed, with citrus, pine, cut grass, and celery coming through. The pine in particular is quite strong.  T: This is a damned smooth-drinking beer. Of course the hops are present throughout the whole time, but the finish is much milder than I would have expected from that powerful aroma. Pine and citrus are very present and in your face, but they don't push their luck. 8% ABV? I would never have guessed that high.  M: One of the smoothest, creamiest beers I've had, with a perfect balance of soft-average carbonation with the full-body.  T: I was a little nervous about trying this beer... no way it could live up to the hype. But it pretty much did... one of my first (THE first?) DIPAs I've had...

Soapy rings of lacing coat the glass.  Very floral hop aroma with dank earthy bus notes, resinous hop oils, sticky pine, citrus peel slight alcohol. Lemon peel and grapefruit are prominent with a good bit of earthy pine. Subtle malt backbone but this is mostly all glorious stinky hops. Probably the best smelling beer I've experienced.  Dry bitter floral hop blast up front with a lot of chewy resinous oily hop notes. There are so many different flavors going on here and this is the most well balanced, drinkable beers I've ever had. Lots of sweet citrus notes, mostly lemon peel and grapefruit ans a nice creamy body with subtle malt that provides a perfect balance. Dry sticky pine notes come through in the finish but it is stiil very floral and extremely smooth and quaffable. There is a very slight alcohol warmth towards the end of the swallow and in the finish but otherwise the ABV is very well masked.

863,7971,eallured,4.95,"I have little reason than karma to review this guy since its reputation is well set and I won't everforget the flavor of this delightful creation. That being said... Pours gold to light amber, a little cloudy with a large inital head that dissapates moderately, at first to a fluffy white cottonlike head and then to a single layer of large bubbles perched just above the nectar. Aroma is of a pine forest after a summer rain while eating a grapefruit flavor spiked nectarine and approaching a Mendocino farm field. The sweet, engulfing smell of American hops covers any other aromas that may be perceived. It is interesting that the aroma very much reminds me of hop stoopid, another dipa using hop extract. Vonnie says he uses pure resin from CO2 extract and hop stoopid uses an in house CO2 extract. Flvor is again hop dominated, but the bitterness is very smooth and flys below the radar. The pale color allows doesn't seem to require as muh bitterness to balance the thick caramel of many other dipas. Stone fruit and citrus dominate the flavor. Body is fuller than expected from the color but understanably thick to allow the hop orgy to delight the more olfactory taste buds withou waking the bitter-sensing neighbors. Carbonation is moderate to high and sharp on the tongue, smaller bubbles breaking. As I have remarked many times before, I can drink this until I can no longer stand up, and then I could continue until I can't see. No beer can be 5s across the board so I will knock a half point on mouthfeel for slightly sharp carbonation. Just distracts with bubbles instead of smoothing or adding a welcome creaminess.",Russian River Brewing Company,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,100

Taste: Strong bitterness before any flavors can be detected. The pine and earth flavors grab hold, but fade into their citrus partners - lemon, orange, and even a little apricot. As the beer warms, the fruity aspect of the hop flavor becomes more present, giving the beer a more rounded and pleasant flavor.  Mouth: Very thick and flavorful all the way down. Can't believe that this beer is this strong and you can't tell and until you stand up. Not much alcohol taste or burn at all amazingly.

That was our last stop of the night and I dont remember much of it. Needed to try this again with a clear head, friend was nice enough to ship a fresh bottle out to me.  A - normal pour yielded a one finger head, bubbly and somewhat creamy texture, shrunk rather quickly to a floating island in the middle of the glass, sticky on the sides. beer is a somewhat unique goldish color, very cool.  S - deliciousness. hops and more hops, not stinging or obtrusive, just screaming DRINK ME. put it right up there with some of my other favorite DIPA's, which i would be happy smelling all night. piney, floral, citrus, all in one. i need to find a place that makes hop scented candles.  T - perfect balance of in your face, middle ground, and subtle hop flavors. just enough malt on the bottom end to kill the hop bitterness before it can really take hold. its like this beer was programed to come alive in your mouth.  M - just the tiniest bit under-carbonated for me, but barely noticeable. sticky on the mouth, tongue, and especially the back of the throat. more stickiness, feels like i ate hop flavored pudding. impressive mouthfeel considering the somewhat light body of the beer.  D - would drink more, but i only have one. struggled to let this sit here enough to warm up a bit to serving temp, was just so refreshing when chilled (poured it at 45F). alcohol is just *barely* noticeable. burning slightly at just the right time to remind you this is a man's drink.  notes: also one of my favorite bottles. i'd put this up there with my top 5 DIPA's easily. a real treat.",Russian River Brewing Company,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,100
863,7971,Soneast,4.5,"Pours a clear, orange-ish color, with a good amount of carbonation cascading up the side of the glass. Forms a pretty thick, white colored head, that recedes to a dense layer of bubbles, leaving a very intricate lace pattern on the glass.  The aroma is quite pungent, I could smell the citrus from the bottle the instant I removed the cap, my wife who was seated in the next room asked if I was peeling an orange, and to save a couple wedges for her. Admittedly, she does have an above average sense of smell. That said, I found the predominate aroma to be of the orange variety, with a sort of grapefruity tartness detected as well. Pungent, citrusy, with next to no malt aroma detected.  Not unlike the aroma, the flavor is also chock full of citrus. An amazing hop flavor,there is a very mild malt backbone consisting of a touch of very light caramel, maybe even honey-like. Overall, however, this is pure hop. I detect mostly a citrusy flavor overall, while the aroma was quite ""orangey,"" I found the grapefruit to really take over in the flavor profile, with maybe a touch of pine resin. The finish is, of course, quite bitter however, it isn't out of control, I have had many DIPAs that were extremely bitter to the point of ruining the hop flavor in the beer, whereas the bitterness in PtE is more of a complimentary bitterness.  I hate to buy into the hype, but wow! this was a very good beer. I certainly doesn't hurt the the bottle I received was only 7 days old. Incredibly drinkable, with, I think it's safe to say, absolutely no alcohol presence. I am definitely going to have to trade for more of this!

Light transparent orange poured into a pint glass, with a finger of white head leaving a nice lace throughout most of the glass. Pine and grapefruit notes are prevalent, with some added bitter citrus and well-balanced hoppiness. Taste was lighter than I had anticipated, but was plenty complex and had great hop presence and citrus chracteristics, balanced by a subtle maltiness that becomes more apparent as it warms up. Not as sharp and destructive feel as some other DIPA's, and just the right amount of carbonation to compliment the bite. The 8% abv is barely noticeable, and this is an extremely drinkable beer. I could go through several in an outing if unstopped. This is always in high demand throughout local beer stores, and is truly one of the greater DIPA's on the market.

It is a pretty unique color. The head is bright white and compact, it leaves some decent lacing.  The smell is phenomenal on this one. A cornucopia of hoppage, with scents of citrus, pine, and a hint of sweetness.  The flavor is also amazing. A barrage of grapefruit, lemon, bitterness and pine hit you like a freight train. There is a subtle bit of malt that provides some sweetness and rounds out the taste, but don't let this fool you, this is hoppier than your average DIPA. It is a hop bomb to the fullest. The bitterness is overt but not offensive in the least. The mouthfeel is perfect, subtable for a massive hop delivery with a medium body and prickly, active, though not overt carbonation.  As far as a DIPA goes this is as drinkable as it gets, not only does it smell and taste like heavenly hop nectar, the alcohol is nonexistent. The bitterness is never tiring, but assuming you are a DIPA lover like me, you won't even think of it anyways.  This is one damn fine beer, it just edges out FFF Dreadnaught as my favorite in the category.

Very green resinous hops can be smelled from the crack of the bottle.  The flavor is much in line with the nose. I will admit I am somewhat surprised be the relative balance to this one. Solid malt back supports a heavy hop profile but does not seem to be overwhelmed the the big bitter presence. Well rounded hop profile features flavors ranging from citric to piny with a slight grassiness as well.  Medium body with moderate yet appropriate carbonation. Smooth and creamy while finishing rather dry.  Remarkably drinkable. Alcohol masked well and goes unnoticed through out. Easy and enjoyable to drink.

863,7971,DrScotch,4.42,"I am not usually a fan of the exceptionally hoppy IPAs, but I heard good things about RR brewing company, so I figured I'd give this bad boy a go.  Pours brilliant orange-gold with just a hing of green. Tight tall head that you could shave with.  Even before I took a deep smell, I could tell what I was going to get. Solid pine, grapefruit, lemon, fresh-cut grass and cannabis aroma.  Hits the tastebuds bitter, rapidly brings through the flavour, little hint of malt or the alcohol.  The bitterness carries the flavour, the flavour carries the bitterness. The key to an IPA of this boldness is balance. Some have it, others don't. This one's got it in spades.",Russian River Brewing Company,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,100
863,7971,schinebd,4.55,"A - When held up to the light the beer is a clear golden yellow. No cloudiness. When shaded a bit it takes on a more orange/very light copper hue. The white head settles to a very minute thickness, but leaves itself sticking to the side of the glass, leaving a temporary coat before slowly ebbing back downward creating a nice spiderweb on the sides of my glass.  S -Strong pine and citrus - orange and lemon notes over freshly cut and damp grass. Very assertive hop aroma really masks any other smells that might otherwise surface.  T - Strong bitterness plants itself before any flavors can be detected. Once my tongue is used to the bitter character, I can detect its components. The pine and earth flavors grab hold, but fade into their citrus partners - lemon, orange, pineapple. There is some definite and detectable biscuit malt, but it is light and only serves to provide some mild balance. As the beer warms, the fruity aspect of the hop flavor becomes more present, giving the beer a more rounded and pleasant flavor.  M - The highlight of this brew. Smooth, thick, syrupy without being sticky or gooey; the carbonation somehow doesn't affect the smoothness at all. I've never had another beer of this style or similar body that was able to retain such a great feel.  D - The dry finish coupled with the lingering citrus fruit flavor begs for more sips. 500 mL comes and goes. The feel, the flavor, the entire brew really come together and provide quite the drinking experience.",Russian River Brewing Company,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,100
863,7971,MCfunkyJ,5,"Have heard of this DIPA but never gazed my eyes on it until today. I have to say that I'm extremely happy that my local bar carriers this for only $4/pint during Happy Hour 2pm-8pm.  Pours: gold/yellow with a nice thick head that quickly dispersed  Aroma: sweet fruit, pine, citrus and hoppy smell  Taste: exceptional Hops explode all over your taste buds with a tint of pine and citrus.  Mouthfeel: medium, naturally sweet  Drinkability: the aftertaste leaves you wanting more and before you know your glass will be empty",Russian River Brewing Company,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,100

T: Hops are bold, with plenty of resiny pine, citrus rind, candied pineapple, slight toffee sweetness is overpowered by the assertive bitterness.  M: Well-attenuated, moderate body has a drying finish.  D: Hops are a little harsh, but it's not too sweet & the alcohol is subtle. The way a DIPA should be?",Russian River Brewing Company,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,100
863,7971,wiseguy142,4.12,"Thank you to my college roommate for picking this up for me in LA. This is my first PtE so obviously I was going to chug it and call it a day but I changed my mind at the last minute.  Color is unbelievably clear golden yellow with a frothy off white head. Random bubbles float up from the middle periodically.  Aroma is very rich and a diverse range of the hop spectrum. First a piney cascade, then an earthy centennial, and finishes with a more juicy hop aroma that I always like in IPAs.  Medium assertive bitterness starts the taste out. Nice balance of crystal malt to hop flavor. The end of the crystal malt taste is sharply cut off by the hops, but it's a double IPA so it's ok. It still finishes watery in terms of malt but there's a solid 45 seconds of hop flavor that lingers on your tongue. Not a lot of grapefruit, which I found surprising. Pine, earth, slight juice- but less than in the aroma.  Mouthfeel is ok.. a little to viscous for me and good carbonation but I think the ""smoothness"" is a matter of taste. It bothers me in a lot of Saranac's beers but in this case it doesn't take away from the flavor.  After drinking a bottle of this the only thing that reduces the drinkability is that damn earthy bitterness that just sort of makes you feel like you've been eating hop cones straight.  I think this beer basically boils down to the earthy bitterness and overall pine flavor that surrounds it. To be honest, I can't see why this is so hyped. Maybe it's a west coast thing. It's a very good beer, absolutely. Probably one of the best DIPAs I've had. In the end, however, even as I try to distance myself from the hype surrounding this beer (especially since I don't get to try many hyped beers), this is not one of the beers that gets under my skin and makes me love beer. But it is a damn fine one.",Russian River Brewing Company,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,100
863,7971,beerwolf77,4.53,"The excitement is building like a huge wave as I await the opening of this bottle. Thankfully the time has come for the meeting of this epic beer and my tastebuds.  Poured into my pint glass the beer is a fairly clear golden yellow with an enormus bone white head. The head itself looks like a vanilla milkshake. After some serious waiting the head has slowly receded and left some of the thickest sticky lace around the top of my glass.  The aroma is pure heaven. Pure floral hops. Pungent pine sap and bitter grapefruit yet it has a pleasant sweetness that seems to reign in the overpowering hop pressence. Usually the hop bombs tend to just have the whole pine needles air about them but, not this one.  The first sip is everything I hoped it would be. It's so perfectly balanced. Hop bitterness followed my smooth malt backbone. The hops seem to stomp all over your tongue then the malt comes in almost insantly and gives your tastebuds a hug and smoothes things over. The DIPA's I've experianced in the past tended to lean one way or the other never finding the absolute perfect mix. The Elder gives you just that.  Medium body with plenty of carbonation. The Elder isn't sticky like some hop bombs. It just washes down pure.  Overall the top DIPA of everything I've tried so far. I'm glad I was able to obtain a few fresh bottles so I can enjoy this beer more then once. Some day I hope to get to the area so I can try on tap. All acolades are well deserved for this one.",Russian River Brewing Company,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,100
863,7971,Mistofminn,4.92,"Thanks to BevmoIan for sending me two very fresh bottles of this! Thanks Ian!  500 ml bottle dated 9/22/09 consumed all the way out here in Minnesota. Poured into a standard pint glass. Pours an orange-straw yellow. Large slightly off white chunky head produced, with decent retention. Leaves some dotted lacing around the tulip glass.  The nose is a huge whiff of floral and fruity hops, grapefruit, pineapple and mango to name a few. Just excellent, very inviting and even my girlfriend who is far from fond of IPA's found this very enjoyable.  The taste is spot on. Dank and moist floral hop juices just dance all over your mouth. Lemons and grapefruits, mellon and pineapple. Excellent combination of hops, just great tasting stuff. Even a non craft beer lover could enjoy this.  Mouthfeel is smooth with a nice lingering bitter aftertaste. Appropriately low carbonation.  Drinkability is through the roof, this is some great tasting stuff, and it goes down too easy.  Overall, all I can say is I wish I had regular access to this beer. Just awesome stuff. In all honesty, probably not my favorite IPA, but Top 3 for sure. Excellent stuff. I'll be moving to the West Coast after I graduate, thats for sure.",Russian River Brewing Company,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,100
863,7971,sprucetip,4.35,"From notes. Clear, copper, active, thick foamy head lasts and lasts, patchy lacing. SMELL is piny, citrus, floral and sweet. Complex, and with long legs and a hint of heat. TASTE floral and citrusy hops first, malty sweetness emerges and balances, followed by sharp citrusy hops and bitterness, which fades into the finish and then lingers a bit. FEEL pleasant medium bodied texture, slight lingering bitterness. OVERALL very flavorful, not too filling, well hidden alc.

863,7971,GJ40,5,"Sampled from a 500ml bottle. Bottled on date was 9/22/09 so it's nice and fresh.  A - A pale golden color with good clarity and a moderate white head. Great lacing.  S - A very floral and fruity hop aroma with pineapple, mango and grapefruit. They really know how to keep that aroma fresh. It's just like opening a packet of hop plugs.  T - A very complex citrusy hop flavor with a reasonable malt backbone and a mild alcohol presence. It's basically liquid hops in a bottle.  M - A smooth and silky consistency with a low carbonation. It lets the flavor run wild and coats your mouth on the way down.  D - This is a flavorful beer but it's still very easy to drink. I've enjoyed many, many Plinys in the last year and the love has only grown. If I had to pick one beer for life, it would likely be this one.",Russian River Brewing Company,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,100
863,7971,psyphin,5,A masterpiece of a beer. It poured a tawny copper color with a nice fluffy white head. Hopalicious aroma. A distinct pine and grapefruit aroma. The taste has a decidedly balanced flavor for such a hop monster. Nice breadiness compliments the grapefruit flavor from the hops. A nice medium body with average carbonation.

863,7971,COBeerBuff,4.8,"500mL bottle received from saulcharlesworth. Bottled date is 8/31/2009 so decently fresh considering we're in Kansas...  Appearance: This beer pours the clearest yellow, orangish amber that I've ever seen. The head is about two fingers, bright white, and interspersed with both large and small bubbles. The top is soft and billowy, and the head has amazing retention with more lacing than I ever thought possible from a beer.  Smell: The hop presence in this beer is incredible. The hops smell almost as fresh as barrels of hops at the brewery itself. Tons of pine, citrus, and pineapple scents. And a malty sweetness that's pretty much untouched as far as these nostril are concerned.  Taste: This is a hoppy mothertrucker! My fiancé compared this beer to drinking a grapefruit. Not just the juice, but the entire fruit, rind and all! I love the hoppiness of this monster. The zest from the citrus combined with the bitterness from the juniper flavors creates an interesting sensation on my tongue. The end is all malty sweetness, twinged slightly with a hop bitterness that just won't die.  Mouthfeel: This beer is smooth, clean, sticky, and gooey, all at the same time. All of these sensations are so well done though. None is overdone. This beer creates a party in my mouth, and I wish it brought friends.  Drinkability: This beer definitely lived up to the hype, in my humble opinion. Its sub-$5 price point makes this beer a steal (if only we could get it out here)! The 8% ABV is well-hidden, but then again, most everything is well done with this beer. After tasting this brew, one gets the impression that nothing was accidental with this beer. I, for one, am thankful that Russian River and Saul gave me the opportunity to try this beer. Thanks guys!",Russian River Brewing Company,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,100
863,7971,jampics2,4.8,"Bottle from a trade with GilGarp. Thanks!! I've been fortunate enough to have this awesome beer several times, the freshest being a 7 day old bottle I had in Seattle. This beer is best when experienced in the first 3 weeks and goes SIGNIFICANTLY downhill at week 5+. Keep that in mind if you're trading for it!!  Appearance: This beer pours deep golden color with a touch of orange. Poured into my Stone Levitation tulip, a two finger head dissipates into nice lacing and a ring that sticks around.  Smell: Smells like a hop field at harvest time in the hot sun. Floral and tropical with nice citrus too. An incredible nose - only Hopslam does it better IMO.  Taste: Amazing hoppy bliss. Tickles my tongue and refreshes without compromising anything on taste. WOW. This is just world class in every way! A crisp light malt bill provides just enough sweetness to compliment the pineapple hop flavor. This is to die for!!  Mouthfeel: Silky and sexy, just enough bubbles to make it dance in your mouth. Slick and resinous without over-doing it on the oily feel.  Drinkability: Could crush this all day. One begs to be followed with another. - difficult to do when you're in OHIO, but this is easily the most drinkable top 50 beer out there IMO.

863,7971,abecall98,5,"Poured it from a bottle, dated on 9/22/09, so that is hella fresh. I just had a Sculpin before this, so not only will I be able to review a beer I have loved for over a year, I can also compare the two.  A - I love the look of Elder. It is light, clear, and has a very white bubbly head that laces amazingly. This is how I want my DIPA's to look, Pliny is the standard in my eyes.  S - Oh hoppy goodness. Very strong citrus and pine smell. The hops in this beer smell are so inviting.  T - Oh boy, this beer is one I cannot get enough of due to the amazing taste. This beer is hoppy, sweet, piney, PLINY!. The beer starts bitter, goes into sweet, hits roast for some reason (yet I love it), and finishes malty with the citrus explosion.  M - sticky, smooth, carbonated. The mouthfeel is all over the place in a good way. The hop bite and roast stays around, but in a very pleasant way I just love.  D - This beer is damn drinkable. The 8% is very well hidden, the taste and mouthfeel leave you wanting more Pliny. I love this beer and will drink it whenever I need my hop fix. Having had my freshest bottle yet, tonight the Pliny has been my best one ever.  I liked the Sculpin I had before this, but Pliny is still ahead of it in my opinion for IPA/DIPA. I believe Pliny is the standard for a West Coast DIPA. It very well deserves the title in my eyes.",Russian River Brewing Company,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,100
863,7971,Ezekiel81923,4.52,"Served to me on tap in a 10oz snifter at the Craft Ale House in Limerick soon after their Grand Opening. What a line-up they had this day!  Appearance: Pretty light in color. I've seen pale ale's darker in color. Nice white fluffy head that stuck around for a while before dissipating to a good looking rim around the top of beer, leaving lacing down the side after every sip.  Smell: This is where, in my opinion, this beer separates itself from the rest. A magical, resiny hop aroma of pine, citrus, floral notes and even some tropical fruits. I would pay $5 a snifter just the smell it for an hour. So many hops in the aroma, with a sweet hint of malt backbone.  Taste: Not overwhelming. Not a malicious onslaught of hops that you might have expected from the nose. Not an overly biting hop presence, more of wool coat of hops that wrap your tongue in delicious floral flavors and pine.  Mouthfeel: The resinous, oily feel of the hops stick to your tongue and inside of your mouth and stick around for quite some time. Not overly bitter, just a nice carbonation feel on the tongue while you sip and swallow.  Drinkability: I had four of these while I was there, to get my fresh Pliny fix. This is a very easy drinking DIPA.  Is it worth the hype? Yea, probably most of the hype. I've had other DIPA's and regular IPA's that I've enjoyed more, that are cheaper, but I would certainly never turn down a Pliny.",Russian River Brewing Company,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,100

Had a great time at the Brewery and in the Bay area. Definitely worth a trip!  A=Pours clear and golden. Color almost seems to light for what it is! Initial head is very nice and leaves a thin lacing on the glass. S=Perhaps my favorite part of this excellent beer. It has such a deep pine aroma coupled with notes of citrus. I could thrive off of the aromatics alone! M=Just right. Good solid weight without being to light or cloying. T=The smell of the beer travels with the initial sip. Pine and prickly needles on the sides of the tongue give way to a strong malt-balanced hoppiness. The equilibrium this beer achieves is fantastic. D=It would be wonderful to have this everyday, but then I probably wouldn't like it as much as I do!  What an excellent piece of work. Glad I got to have this in a bottle and on draft at the brewpub.

T-- Loads of citrus, apple, pear, and floral aroma, but i couldn't get over the smell, so HOPS!!! of course.  M-- Smoove. Nough Said.  D-- A true pleasure to drink.

863,7971,EPICAC,4.39,"Pliny the Elder is mildly hazy and copper in color. It's topped by a creamy, off-white head that retains well and leaves fluffy lace clinging to the glass. The aroma can be summed up in two words ""intensly hoppy"". The hops are herbal, piney and strongly resiny. Swirling the beer brings out even more resiny hops. There are fruity notes of apricots and oranges, malty sweetness, and toastiness that comes out on swirling. It's like sticking your nose into a bag of hops.  Overall this beer is pretty balanced. It's not overly sweet like a lot of other DIPAs. The intial malt impressions are toasty and bready with only a mild sweetness. Malts move towards a sweeter, caramel flavor in the center, but still not overly sweet. Hop flavors also make themselves known towards the center. There's a citric bite with a floral, orange blossom quality. Towards the finish there's a mild peppery bite with a good slighty herbal, strongly resiny hop bitterness in the finish that lingers long into the aftertaste. Pliny the Elder is medium-bodied, and has a prickly carbonation that cuts the sweetness somewhat. There's an oiliness towards the swallow that trails off leaving a final impression of thinness.  This DIPA is very balanced. The malts are present, but aren't cloyingly sweet like other examples of the style. The hops are present, but their main contribution is a nice finishing flavor and wonderful lingering bitterness.",Russian River Brewing Company,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,100
863,7971,quinnsi,4.82,"Appearance is copper-orange and spectacularly clear, pouring with a nice sized head of soapy foam, which dissipates leaving nice lace along the glass.  Wow, what a nose! One of the best noses on a beer I've smelled, offering huge nose-fulls of powerful, resiny, fresh hops. Hop smells range from pine, to floral to ripe citrus. Excellent.  Once I finally pulled my nose away from the beer and actually began to drink it, I was startled by how mild this beer starts out. I was prepared to have little hop devils pitch-fork my tongue into submission, but that is not at all what happened. Instead, the hops gradually wash over your mouth, filling it with wonderful floral hop tastes that eventually become quite resiny. Pliny finishes very well too, with the hop aroma lingering in your mouth without becoming bitter. The finish of this beer is world-class.  Mouth feel is good for such a hoppy beer, as Pliny always feels good on the tongue. All this combines to make it one of the most drinkable DIPA's I've come across.

863,7971,jhoban19,4.92,"500ml bottle, hand-delivered from San Francisco to Chicago by my cousin. The beer I'm reviewing is the last one of the 10 he brought.  A: Bubbly, slightly hazy golden/copper/amber color. solid 2 finger white head, decent retention. lacing dangling the full length of the glass as I drink.  S: Hops, hops and more hops, with pine and hints of floral and some citrus. I seem to get a little something different with each sniff. I can't quite seem to distinguish the specific citrus smells. A bit of malt introduces itself as Pliny warms.  T: this baby tastes almost exactly like it smells- big hops with varying hints of pine and citrus- some moreso than others. just enough malt to balance the hops.  M: Not enough O's in smooove to describe this one. Perfectly carbonated. Moves swiftly to the back of the tongue with an orangey flavor that whips back up toward the front of your mouth. Hop bitterness lingers perfectly throughout.  D: Absolutely cannot get enough of Pliny. Unquestionably one of my top 5 favorite beers, if not my favorite. As much as I'm enjoying this beer, I'm sad that it's the last one. Even knowing that, it's hard to take it slow with this beer- it goes down so smooth it's gone before you know it.

Very nice appearance, dark golden body with a thick bubbly head that leaves a nice level of lacing on the snifter.  The smell isn't overwhelming, nice citrus and pine scents. Almost all hops in the nose. From the smell you can definitely tell you are getting a DIPA.  The taste is of hops, lots of hops. Citrus, grapefruit and pine, emphasis on pine. Bitterness at first with slight malt detectable in the finish. Nice crisp taste, lots of pine hops, but not too bitter.  Great mouthfeel, bitter hop bite with medium-high carbonation, yummy.

Floral and citrusy, resinous hops dance around the palate with grapefruit, fresh flowers, and pineapple. The finish is crisp and dry, and lasts for what seems like minutes.

Not quite sure why I've been holding off on reviewing this one. I suppose I never thought I could do it any justice.  Today on tap at FO, though, I had another incredible experience with the beer. It must've been ridiculously fresh. I couldn't get enough. Pours a light gold with a great 1/2 inch pillowy white head that retains well but eventually dissipates to form a cover over the beer. Lacing is nicce. It's a look I'm quite familiar with. Pavlov's dog when this gets poured....  Smells of incredibly ripe fruits- apples, pears, oranges, citrus notes even--coupled with a great floral aroma. This one smells HOPPY. brilliantly so.  It tastes even better.

Appearance is great, golden yellow with a chunky 1 finger head. Massive lacing on the glass as it empties. Smell is exceptonal, the hop aroma punches you right in the face. I could smell the glass all day long. Taste is the same, huge hop burst followed by the ever so slight malt presence. This beer goes down like water, mouthfeel is excellent. Drinkability is very high. I had 2 10oz pours and I was itching for more. Too bad I had to drive myself home, they can kick you in the ass at 8% abv.  Overall this is one of my favorite beers.

863,7971,mechamifune,4.7,"I doubt I have anything to say about this amazing beer that hasn't already been said on here, but I liked it so much I can't resist. I had this on tap and in a bottle this past week while out in oregon and california. I found the (very recently) bottled version to be slightly more enjoyable (thanks to bier one in newport, or). Amazing hop/citrus aroma out of the bottle, more so than any dipa i've ever had. Color and complexion are pleasant but nothing out of the ordinary.  Wonderful, crisp, citrus taste that stays consistant throughout the bottle. Almost no sense of alcohol is retained, which is pretty remarkable for an 8%er. All this adds to great drinkability and I would have had no problem taking down a couple more pints at russian river if it hadn't been my third microbrewery stop of the day.  All in all it goes slightly ahead of Dreadnaught and Founders Double Trouble as the best DIPA i've had.",Russian River Brewing Company,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,100
863,7971,BeerBelcher,4.62,"First off, a big thanks to my cousin for bringing this beer with him to OH on a x-country trip from CA.  I've had this beer at festivals on draft, and thought it was amazing. However, I usually don't rate from samples, so I haven't rated it until I got my own bottle. And while the bottle was very good, I don't think it was as fresh as the samples I've had on draft. Because while the bottle I got was certainly very good, it wasn't the hop ecstasy I experienced in the draft form. So, in this review, I'll likely split the difference.  Color is far lighter than I would've expected. It looks like a golden ale - not too thick, a very light blond/golden color, with a nice amount of head piled on top - a nice picture. Aroma was very hoppy (but hoppier on draft) and was very pine-y and resin-y. Beer was balanced with a nice malt framework...even though this beer is packed with hops, it didn't unbalanced.  Mouthfeel is light and pleasant. I swear I could drink a gallon of this stuff without feeling stuffed and like my mouth was coated with cotton candy (the way I would feel with other very hoppy, sticky IPAs).  This beer deserves its accolades. It really is one of the best!",Russian River Brewing Company,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,100
863,7971,SkinnyElvis,4.79,"Cheers to a certain mail order beer company who sticks it to the man & will ship to PA! 8/19/09 batch. Pours with a big head which settles slowly. Color is a bit light for a DIPA. Smells & tastes of citrus & pine hops and not much else. Mouthfeel is smooth considering the hoppiness. An 8% ABV helps make this very drinkable for the style. A huge DIPA which is worth seeking if you are a hop head. I have had this on draft many times & it is just as good in a bottle. One of my favorite beers, period.",Russian River Brewing Company,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,100
863,7971,DNA,4.57,I'm not a big fan of IPAs but I've tasted quite a few and Pliny the Elder is arguably the definitive IPA. The hop aroma is incredible - like my nose was buried in a double handful of fresh hops.  The appearance is typical for an IPA - a nice golden color with a slight cloudiness. The taste is exceptional with a distinctly fresh hop bitterness that lingers.  The only downside for me is the extreme hoppiness that prevents me from wanting to drink another glass. For what is described as a double IPA I would expect a little more malt flavor to come through and help balance out the fresh hop bitterness.,Russian River Brewing Company,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,100
863,7971,natelocc787,4.55,"I'll be the guy who says that for me-this beer didn't live up to the hype. Great IPA but I was expecting something legendary like the Pliny to be phenomenal and it wasn't. It was simply as good as other great IPA's. Which lucky for the Pliny's score, I happen to love great IPA's.  The appearance was impressive. Great retention and lacing-we all know the color of an Imperial IPA, no need for me to try and discern what shade of whitish color the head is or what shade of golden orange the beer is and find some new color of crayola to name it.  The nose was outstanding. My homeboy (who apparently has a much higher sense of smell than me) said he could smell it as soon as he cracked the bottle. I however, had to actually get the poured beer closer to my face, but wow. Really well crafted. All the floral, herbal piney and citrus aromas really stand out. Hoppy as heck! Reminded me of the Ruination methinks.  The taste was like the smell. I enjoyed the pineapple aspect in addition to the tangerine and key lime pie flavors. Nice balance I must add between the citrusy and and pineyness of the hops. If this was a seesaw battle I suppose it would lean a little more closer to the ground on the piney side. Tasted siimilar to a better balanced Ruination or a slightly more floral Hop Stoopid.  Mouthfeel was nice and silky but lacked crispness. Could have been thicker and more syrupy for me as well. A little bit too watery for me to give it the 4.5. Maybe my bottle was slightly affected by it's long journey to the Pliny-less state I dwell in, Texas.  Very drinkable. No problem putting this back and the alcohol was well hidden. Very tasty as well, I look forward to many more next year when I move back to Cali.",Russian River Brewing Company,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,100
863,7971,jxhill,4.47,"Clear amber color with sizeable creamy white head. Absolutely delicious and citrusy whiff of hops with the faintest toasted notes behind it. Hops fills the mouth with zesty and tangy hoppiness which is well balanced between aroma and bitterness. The grapefruity citrus notes linger on the tongue until fading late into smooth bitterness and nice alcohol warmth. Body is deceptively light. Lots of beautiful lacing.  So this is the Pliny I've heard so much about. And it lives up to its billing. Like so many DIPAs, it is powerfully hoppy. Unlike most DIPAs it manages to be both floral and bitter in well-balanced combination. It is easy on the eyes and complex on the nose and tongue. Certainly a superior DIPA.",Russian River Brewing Company,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,100

S: Mouthwatering ripe and slightly acidic citrus and, orange, and lemon. Floral, pine, and grassy hops. I am a malt head through and through, but there is such depth in the nose here. T: Again, ripe fruits explode on the tongue. Almost chewy hops. Floral, pine, and grass. A huge hop flavor without the over done bitterness. M/D: A medium body and carbonation. A nice crisp snap on the tongue. Not hard to drink considering the alcohol and the style. A good sipping beer.  If more DIPA's were like this I would drink them more often. There is a huge hop flavor, but it is not just bitterness. For an admit malt head this is very enjoyable.

863,7971,NittanyBeerFan,4.59,"Thank you to redbrewer83 for this. Received in a trade only last Wednesday, drinking this while it is still nice and fresh. Bottled 070909. I had this on tap once and apparently never reviewed it...so here goes.  A: Pours a coppery amber color, with a nice inch of thick head. The head dissipates into a film of head, with nice retention. The lacing left is clumpy and patternless.  S: Every bit as good as I remember it, and I think not being in a bar makes it even better. This is one easily one of the most appetizing beers of any style that I have ever had. Floral hops abound and make my mouth water. I love me some Cascade hops. There is a delectable aroma of apricot nectars, with just a touch of pine in the background.  T: Pliny does not disappoint. Tons of bitter hops, completely hidden in the smell ambush my tastebuds. The hops begin to leave the bitter character and assume a citrusy character of grapefruit and lemon zest. The sweet apricot rounds out the flavor with some floral hops as well.  M/D: Stuffed to the brim with sticky hops, this beer is clean and crisp. It has a lighter texture and feel than most DIPAs, and this makes is supremely enjoyable and refreshing. The bitterness makes my mouth pucker as I sip, but the smooth finish really rounds out this beer nicely. The fruity component adds a layer of complexity that I was not expecting. I am a big fan.",Russian River Brewing Company,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,100
863,7971,rvdoorn,3.69,"According to the beeradvocate reviewers, one of the best beers on this planet. After months of waiting, I finally managed to buy two bottles in a beershop. Does it live up the hype...? This beer should potentially the best one of my second beer tasting evening with PapaEugene. Poured into a Rochefort glass. The beer pours hazy-dark yellow (had to think about morning urine immediately), with a beautiful snow-white head that disappeared fast into a somewhat messy lacing.  Smell: WOW, what a smell, extremely strong floral hops (obviously), peach and honey  Taste: My first reaction was WOW again, very very bitter and hoppy, and then a surprisingly a gradual change to nice sweet grapefruit... cool, I always love such different taste-layers in beer! The beer has a fresh bitter, but very soft (like silk) finish. After two or three sips, the previously mentioned grapefruits now seem to be more lemon. Interesting...  Mouthfeel: Medium carbonation with a light body.  Overall: Well, I have to say, that at first I thought this was truly one of the best beers I ever had. But after 4 sips, I had to drink water to clean my taste buds and re-hydrate my mouth. This ritual I had to repeat the whole time. This beer is so bitter (which is great), but it makes the mouth dry and insensitive for any other taste (and apparently I'm not the only user that thinks so recently). What a pity, because a beer should also be drinkable. I think the drinkability is highly overrated, the taste, for sure not. It feels a bit strange this beer is rated higher than Rochefort 10 and Westvleteren 8 on Beeradvocate, I personally think that the ratebeer.com rating reflects the quality of this beer better. But still, worth to try? YES! if I drink it again....? well, I still have one bottle left....",Russian River Brewing Company,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,100

Leaves a nice foamy white head that lingers for quite a while. Lots of lacing on the glass. The color is a light orange shade and very cloudy. Tiny bubbles work their way up the glass. I could smell this beer when I opened the bottle. Wonderfully strong in the nose. Lots of hoppy aroma. Noticeable citrus and pine presence in the aroma. The taste is much the same. Absolutely delicious. Big hoppy bite, followed by a strong grapefruit taste...almost tastes like a grapefruit rind was dropped in. A fair amount of bitterness but not overpowering. A real lip smacker. Very strong taste and nicely balanced. Medium body and not a lot of mouth stick. It's got an almost ""oily"" mouthfeel to it and it makes me want to chatter my teeth. This is real easy to drink, but I need to sip this and savor it. Who knows when I'll get more Pliny. I had high expectations and those were certainly met.

863,7971,pixieskid,4.53,"Reviewed today, 9/12/09, freshness date 8/23/09. Poured from 500ml bottle to a small ""pint"" style glass at City Beer in San Francisco. A- Poured a glowing hazy orange, with a surprisingly small head. S- (I have a weak sense of smell) but citrus hops were definitely present. T-Incredibly balanced, very smooth, has a rich sweet malt upfront, balanced by a nice citrus hop flavor throughout. Finishes velvety smooth with a mellow bitter/ slight sour taste. M- rather thin body for a double ipa, perfect carbonation. D- This is the most balanced DIPA/ beer I have ever had, the alcohol is almost not even present, and the thin body/carbonation make it highly drinkable. However, it has an incredibly dry finish, something I am not a fan of, especially in an IPA/DIPA category. It almost leaves my throat dry as if I am having an allergic reaction?  This was my first encounter with Pliny and despite the issue I had with it's dryness, I will definitely be trying it again. I am hoping that the next one lives up to it's reputaiton. P.S. Thanks papaeugene for reassuring me that i am not insane, and that Pliny has a strange dry/ dehydrating affect on ones throat. I shall be trying it on tap tonight at Toronados,SF, and I have my fingers crossed.  Update: Turns out that I was indeed having an allergic reaction, but not to the beer. Since this review I have had Pliny on numerous occasions and must say that it truly is an exceptional beer. Wonderful balance, great undertones, and not overly dry by any means. I have thus updated the rating.",Russian River Brewing Company,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,100
863,7971,PapaEugene,4.12,"Should be the most promising beer from the second beertasting session with rvdoorn. We split a 500 ml bottle.  A: HAzy dark yellow color. No head worth mentioning. Big bubbly irregular lacing left.  S: HOPS all over the place. Honey, peachy, citrus and something floral.  T: Starts of with a bittersweet citrus/honey taste but after a few sips it shows a great grapefruit taste. Main part is obviously dominated by hops. Aftertaste is bitter but soft.  M: Medium carbonation and a light body. Very pleasant mouthfeel.  D: Being very impressed by smell/taste initially, somewhere half through my glass I feel my mouth drying out and the bitterness taking hold of all my papilla. To keep enjoying this beer, I went to rinse my mouth with water a few times. This left me in doubt about trying this beer again.",Russian River Brewing Company,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,100
863,7971,Ek0nomik,4.92,"Poured In: Tulip Glass Attained through a trade.  Appearance: Pours a golden yellow color with a trail of bubbles running in the middle of my glass from bottom to top with a finger of head. A nice amount of oil covered bubbles are showing up in the head. As time passes by a thin layer of head remains as the beer quantity slowly drops down. A generous amount of lacing at the top of my glass, with an enormous amount of lacing in the middle; my glass has turned from clear to white. I'm surprised at how bright and clear this beer is. I was expecting something a little more cloudy and more copper in color.  Smell: This is what an IPA should smell like. Finally a West Coast IPA from my trade that I want more of. Nothing except resinous hops on the nose. A fantastic blend of grass, citrus, and flowers.  Taste: Bitterness comes up first, with almost no malt flavor (which is great! - not that I hate malt, but in an IPA I want nothing but hops) followed by a great blend of hops. A nice blend of earthy hops, including grass, flower, and pine, followed by a blend of grapefruit and orange. I love the feeling of the hop oils coating my tongue. The grapefruit aftertaste leaves me wanting more.  Mouthfeel: A medium bodied beer, with a nice level of carbonation. Hop oils coating my gums, teeth, and tongue.  Drinkability: Russian River, please start distributing to Wisconsin. This is a beer I could have multiple of. A fantastically brewed beer by RR. This was the first PtE I had, and the first beer from RR. I'll be asking for this in a trade many times in the future.",Russian River Brewing Company,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,100
863,7971,berkey,4.58,I picked up an extremely fresh batch for the recent holiday weekend and enjoyed it so much I decided to re-review. Just getting around to typing up notes now. Bottled 08/31/09 consumed 09/05/09.  Forms a great fluffy white head with amazing retention. Body is a very crisp and clean amber color. Leaves rings of beautiful lacing as it goes. This is about as good looking as they come.  Aroma is dominated by stong pine notes with some underlying bitter pungency. A healthy dose of citrus can be picked up here followed by a sweet cereal-like malt backbone.  Flavor follows the aroma fairly faithfully. Deep resinous pine is outstanding on this fresh bottle. I notice that seems to be the first thing that fades on other bottles I've had with only about a month on them. This tends to create a slightly unbalanced hop profile that makes it much less enjoyable. The way the different flavors are stacked against eachother to create a unique balance is really the strenght of this brew. A fairly sweet beer at moments but the dry bitter pungency hides the moderate booze incredibly well. The citrus from the aroma is still here but more as a supporting player.  Drinkabilty is so high on this one it's tempting to session it but at 8% that's usually not a great idea. Clean and crisp on the mouthfeel. Possibly the most refreshing DIPA I've tried.  The label is no joke: DO NOT AGE! I can't think of any other beer where freshness makes such a dramatic difference.,Russian River Brewing Company,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,100
863,7971,0tt0,4.84,"I've had this at Toranado in San Francisco and I was fortunate enough for a friend of mine to bring me back two bottles from his recent visit to Sonoma. According to the label, it was bottled on 8/19/09. It also implores me not to lay bottle #2 and drink it fresh. Not sure if I'll heed that one...  The beer pours golden in color with some amber hints at the edges of the glass. Really, its the color of a dried apricot. Head is stark white with some tight bubbles.  The appearance is certainly nice, but its the nose that lets you know right away that this is something terrific. It smells like hops that have just been dumped into the boil: green, citric, grassy, and somewhat sappy. I feel like part of Pavlov's pack.  The collar dissipates quickly, but a quick swirl of the glass brings it right back. In fact, when swirled, it looks like a tornado, albeit a very pretty tornado. First sip is, just as suspected, all fresh, wet, green hops. Tangerine dominates the citrus flavors up front. What's remarkable is that it shifts as it slides across the tongue to a grapefruit note that is immediately balanced by the malts kicking into gear. The malt is hard to pin down--not as sweet as honey, nor as ""dark"" as caramel. Whatever it is, its lovely. The finish is where all the hops really assert themselves: sappy, almost like an American barleywine, with some warming alcohol that was well cloaked up until that point. It is deceptive.  This is an exception DIPA, probably the best there is in terms of a fresh, grassy hop flavor and a great malt balance that never forgets that the hops are the star of the show. In a weird way, I'm almost glad I couldn't have this beer every day. Instead, I'd rather have it every year or so.

863,7971,spwalshesq,4.42,"My beer buddy and I had been dying to try Pliny the Elder after reading all the rave reviews and high marks, but because Russian River doesn't distribute to the right coast, we had to reach out to a left coast contact to have it sent east. It is a great beer and worth the wait.  Pliny has a golden honey color with a nice, 2-finger head which receded to sticky lacing. The aroma was pure hop heaven - almost hempish - this beer should be enjoyed in a large tulip glass in order to fully appreciate the nose. One of the better smelling beers I've had the pleasure of sampling.  Pliny the Elder has an interesting taste. It's piney, a hint of citrus with a faint sweetness at the end. Let this brew swirl around your tongue to discover its character - it has a palate-smacking lasting flavor that lingers much longer than most beers. Its high hoppiness has a very clean, almost astringent aftertaste. Don't chill this beer too much -- its full character comes out as it warms a bit.  This is a very drinkable beer for a DIPA. I've had some DIPAs that are maltier and more full-bodied which are more appealing to me. So while PTE is one mighty fine beer, I guess I can't say that this is the best DIPA I've ever had. I think Southern Tier's Unearthly tops Pliny as far as Imperials go, but if you're going to have more than one in this style, you might be wise to go with Pliny.

T - Excellent hop flavor - piney, citrusy, and a little floral - with sweet caramel malt and sugar providing that perfect balance.  M - Smooth mouthfeel with hop oiliness fairly low for a DIPA and body a little lighter than I would have expected, which is not a bad thing at all. Finish slightly bitter and dry.

863,7971,HopHead84,4.72,"Consumed on 9/7/2009 and poured into a tulip. I'm ashamed to admit that I take this beer for granted. Fresh bottles are always on the shelf at my local store and it's always on tap at a nearby bar, yet I rarely drink it. I realized the other day that I hadn't even reviewed this staple, so I picked up a bottle today. This is dated 8/31/2009 so it's just a week old. The beer appears golden orange with a silky and frothy two finger white head. The head lingers for a few minutes and as it recedes it leaves a thick coating of lacing clinging to the glass.  The nose is astounding. It's a nice balance of pine resin and bitter grapefruit. Other citrus is peach, orange peel, and mango, and some floral character is evident. A hint of crackery malt is present far beneath the hop display.  The flavor is initially slightly herbal and bitter grapefruit with pine, with just a touch of sweetness that is quickly enveloped by dry bitterness. The malt provides some balance, but only a trace of its crackery presence is detectable in the flavor. The hops are in top form tonight, exhibiting tropical fruit flavors and a nice high level of bitterness. The long finish is dry and highly bitter with lingering pine and citrus. Alcohol is well hidden and only makes a brief appearance in the finish.  The beer is light medium bodied with a medium level of carbonation and a dry, sticky mouthfeel that is near perfect.  Pliny is the archetype and one that has influenced a myriad of stellar Double IPAs yet has managed to remain the leader of the pack. This is arguably the best Double IPA on the planet.",Russian River Brewing Company,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,100

I've been holding this beast in anticipation for a short while, and today was my son's first birthday so I decided to crack it. Imagine a kid getting locked in a candy store but also have the unfortunate disadvantage of diabetes or something, that's what it was like not just destroying this beer immediately.  A: It's got a strangely erotic bright orange color with some light haze and light frothy head that sticks around lightly. Super clear color. Even my eyes are thanking me.  N: Hops just dominate and the pine and citrus just rip my nostrils ashunder. The light malty goodness and slight sweetness also dance around the nose, but the added slight grapefruit at the end add a nice touch. A gentle floral adds lightly to it. Earthy beast-like hops ravage my nose, with lots of fresh hop oils.  T: OK, after months of waiting (since I first setup the trade, not waiting on this beer) its time... guhhh, groggle, slurp, very wet and juicy hop burst, not so much of the crazy pine and dryness as expected, its got a delicate citrus grapefruit and slight malty body, perhaps some tropical juicy hop as well. A nice poignant zip. Theres a touch of spicey hops and earthy tones that seem to build up the more you drink it. But there are some nice piny citrus hops as well. This seems to touch each category of hops except grassy. The alcohol is hidden very well.  M: A light malty body with some light carbonation, a slight sticky and juicy feel.  F: Huge hop smash towards the end, lots of bitterness with citrus and pine but still pretty juicy, slightly dry but doesn't dry out as much as I thought it would for the huge hop kick. The intense bitterness fades quickly leaving you begging for more and ready for the next sip. It's got a big juicy slab in the middle of the end that just makes the drinkibility astronomical. I'm just slamming this thing back like it's going out of business, which is dangerous for 8%.  Final thoughts: This is an incredible beer, as expected. I had huge hopes and it didn't smash them. Perhaps could have used a slight more malt (I'll prolly get reamed for that) but thats IMHO. The hops and flavors are so balanced that it was just amazing to keep drinking and drinking. So many different hop flavors that balance out well and come from every angle, like getting gang jumped. I can't wait to get more.

I wish it was available in my area, but the absence and relative difficulty of getting it makes it that much more gratifying to try.  Poured from the 500ml bottle with the plain, no-frills label. Pours a yellow golden color with a decent white head of about two fingers width.  Smell is very fresh and earthy smelling with notes of red grapefruit flesh, other citrus, and a hint of toffee backbone. The hop aroma is very organic in quality, almost as if smelling the flower on the vine.  Taste is really nice and balanced with elements of grapefruity citrus, a peppery, bitter finish that lingers long after the swallow coupled with a decent malt backbone that is merely a catalyst for the acidic hops.  Mouthfeel is quite adequate with a medium carbonation.  Drinkability is awesome.

Poured from a 1 pint .90fl oz bottle into my pint glass  Pours a light copper color with a two inch slightly off white head. Average head retention that when fades leaves soapy lacing scattered on the sides of my glass.  Smell is of mango, some grapefruit, pine needle hops, grass, and earth like.  Mellow taste of slight citrus that blends nicely into some bittering hops. Very slight malts could be tasted in the backbone but the bittering hops dominate it.  Mouthfeel is medium bodied with high carbonation. Easy drinking even with the medium bitterness.  This is not as fresh as possible, but seeing how its not even 2 months old its pretty much going to taste like this. Overall I was kind of disappointed since Pliny is a very respected beer in the craft beer world.  Its good to experience drinking Pliny, but do not get into the hype.  ***UPDATE*** Had this beer today and it was 3 weeks old this time.

Lots of pineapple and orange hop notes. A good bit of malt richness with toffee and bready notes. The bitterness steadily increases towards a finish of fruity hop flavor, biting bitterness and toasty malt struggling to show through.  M - Medium thick body, moderate carbonation, and a slightly sweet finish.  D - This is a very good beer, but it is not perfect. The bitterness is just a bit harsh and well... thats about all I can come up with to complain about. The hop aroma is great and the flavor is exceptional. It is well balanced and a really nice DIPA that remains drinkable despite the huge flavor.  I have been looking forward to getting ahold of one of these for a while. So, the question is; does it live up to the hype? Well, probably not, but it would be almost impossible for it to. It is not that this isn't an exceptional beer, it is just that there are other DIPAs that are just as exceptional.

($5 a bottle, not bad) says it was bottled 08/19/2009, so this is about as fresh as a Washingtonian can get from the bottle.  A- Pours a nice dark golden color with a good finger of head. I poured it into tulip glass and I poured pretty slowly so didn't get as much as some might have. I am liking the bubbles coming up from the bottom of the glass. After drinking it some, I notice the lacing is awesome, just foam sticking everywhere.  S- Oh Christmas!!! The first thing I noticed was an awesome piney Christmas smell. I also smell some fruityness to it. Mango? Grapes? Orange? Grapefruit? Very fresh smell. It really does smell quite awesome compared to some IPA's I have had lately. The strong smell puts a big smile on my face and I am anticipating the taste which is to come.  T- The fruity pine needle is definitely there. The hops flavor is perfect. Not overpowering at all. It likes to linger on your tongue for a while which keeps you going to the next sip.  M- Goes down very easy and as said before, the taste lingers on the tongue forever and it is wonderful. If you swill it in your mouth a bit, the bubbly feeling is quite nice. Feels very pleasant going down. I can't taste the alcohol but it feels very warming. So far, this beer has very much lived up to its reputation.  D- Can I open my second bottle yet? It doesn't seem to make me feel too full or cause lots of beer burps. I could very easily drink a number of these in a row and I highly doubt I could ever get tired of it.  In conclusion...  I love this beer, plain and simple. I have been teasing my palate with different kinds of IPA's and Imperial IPA's lately but so far, nothing has come close to the amazing explosion of smell and flavor this beer has just provided. I am prone to being disappointed when I have high expectations for something and this one of the few instances that I can say that this beer certainly lives up to its expectations, and then some.

Hands down best beer i've ever had so far. 500ml bottle poured into snifter A - Pours a beautiful golden/orange color with a 2 finger white bubbly head that sits atop the beer beautifully.  S - Fresh citrus hop aroma that is outstanding! grapefruit, peach, floral hops, tropical fruits....amazing  T - Citrus hops, piney hops upfront, grapefruit, peachy/tropical fruits present. Nice bitter aftertaste but its very pleasant. The balance of hops and malt is out of this world...perfectly balanced.  M - exceptionally clean and fresh, feels like silk over the palate. Alcohol is hidden extremely well  D - extremely drinkable, i savored every sip. I drank this one too fast and wish I had more.  Let me just say Pliny the Elder is a freaking experience, the beer is amazing to say the least",Russian River Brewing Company,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,100
863,7971,ShogoKawada,4.82,"""From Oakland to Sacktown The Bay Area and back down Cali is where they put they mack down""  -Tupac  Poured into a wide snifter from .5L bottle. 28 days old, from bottling to my glass. BIG thanks to augustgarage, who hooked a Rhode Islander with this fabled beer.  A- Full-bottle pour into my snifter leaves a shimmering golden beer with hints of orange and copper colors. An aggressive pour leaves a frothy, delightful head on the beer which laces immediately.  S- Hops... sweet hops. As far as other IPA/DIPAs go, this has the hop sweetness similar to the 90 min. DFH, but lacks the malt sweetness of the 90. Grapefruit, citrus, and pine hops all blend together to create a fabulous bouquet. Possibly the best-smelling DIPA I've ever had... with exception of the DFH Squall IPA. I love this smell like a fat kid loves cake.  T- This is the real deal. I think this beer just blew my mind. Powerful hops here. Follows the nose, grapefruit, citrus, and pine hops. Incredible hop flavoring here, finding it hard to put into words. It's like someone created a blend of hops that eliminates everything an over-hopped beer does wrong. It's sweet but not too sweet, a bit tart, mildly bitter, but wonderfully concocted. A hop head's dream, I cannot imagine improving this flavor at all. Haven't tried PtY, but who cares? I sure don't. Gimme more Elder! Pale malt is there to provide a nice body, but do little to add to the flavor. Fine by me, this is expertly crafted.  M- Pretty decent body, almost like silk in your mouth after you sip. Good carbonation, too. Mouthfeel is hard to pin down, the flavor is all my head can wrap itself around right now.  D- Moderate to insanely high depending on your ease of procurement. If I could buy this at my local store, I'd buy this by the pallet and drink it morning, noon, and night. Since I have to trade for it, it's kind of a pain to get (although the trade was mind-boggilingly easy). I want to thank augustgarage for the chance to try this beer... Hope to have this on tap someday, and will look into procuring some more at some point.  My favorite DIPA is still the Squall... unfiltered and bottle conditioned = awesome, but I doubt I'll get another fresh bottle of that unless DFH brings it back. This beer handily beats out the standard 90 min in a bottle.. and I'm somewhat of a DFH groupie. RR ain't fucking around with this beer.  Long story short: Overhyped? Nope.  This beer is a bear, a burly beast, a hop conquistador here to take over your tongue. World-class. The 600-pound DIPA in the room.",Russian River Brewing Company,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,100
863,7971,ledomelor,4.79,"On tap at O'Briens pup in San Diego, 16oz glass  A: Golden nector color A little cloudy with a white frosty head, some lacing  S: Beautiful pine hop aroma with hints of fruits, I think mango, orange and grapefruit but I'm still trying to refine my olfactory skills. This smell will make your mouth water  T: The citrus and pine hops hit the palette first but is very well balanced with the mango, and peachiness flavors that are only present as the beer warms up. Don't drink this beer cold (or any IIPA for that matter), or you will mask many of the flavors. Also pleasantly bitter and a small amount of sweetness. Very complex tasting beer  M: Really clean and fresh after taste. The 8% sneaks up on you. The flavor lingers in your mouth, and it was really hard for me not to order another one, so I did  D: Very drinkable, remember to slow down, this is a beer I could drink too fast.  Overall: One of the best IIPAs I've ever had. Just another reason why it's great to live in California. Very well balanced, and amazing aroma",Russian River Brewing Company,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,100
863,7971,mikey711,4.62,"Big thanks goes to AgentZero who hooked me up with this in a trade. Poured into a few tasting glasses to enjoy with friends.  A: It's slightly cloudy with a touch of very white frothy head. Excellent lacing and a very nice color gold.  S: As soon as I opened the bottle I could smell this beast. It's a very appealing mixture of various citrusy fruits(mango, peach, pineapple, orange, grapefruit.) The aroma is not intense at all and is just making my mouth water. When swirled a lot of pine notes come through.  T: The citrus hops come through very nicely, definitely alot of peachiness and mango here. Also, it has a very pleasing bitter finish. The Sweetness is subtlly there, but takes a back seat to the glorious hoppiness.  M: No harshness or booziness what so ever. Very light, crisp, and refreshing. Makes me wish I didn't share...  D: And it's gone...I seriously need more Pliny in my life.",Russian River Brewing Company,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,100
863,7971,McDiddyPop,4.6,"Got this growler from ipa247. Thanks go to Jeff for hooking me up with this bottle of magic.  Poured into Brookyln stemware, this one looks bright hazy golden orange. A sudsy off-white head sticks around for a few minutes before settling to a thin cap. Tremendous lacing all over the glass.  Smells amazing. Nice grassy and citrusy hops followed by a hint of peach or tropical fruits. Wonderful.  Tastes like it smells. Fresh citrusy hops with a nice minty/ herbal quality. Very fruity and delicious.  Nice crisp mouthfeel. Good carbonation. Absolutely no hint of the alcohol. This one is a treat!

863,7971,Pup,5,"Because I love this beer, I will review it in the voice of Emperor Vespasian, close personal friend to Pliny the Elder.  Sup Romans, tis I, Vespy the eternal and holy, anointed by God, yada yada. Enough about me, let's talk about my main homes, Pliny v1. Ive been a fan of the brotha ever since his Nero bashing in the Naturalis Historia, that fiddle-playing malcontent. Am I rambling? Maybe cause, I've quaffed about 5 of these delicious hoppy beers named after the Plinster.  Me and the Senators went out to mourn the poor bastage's passing after his whole ""blown-up-by-a-volcano"" thing. Luckily this beer is taking the edge off that harsh. Pours a orangy, amber with pillowy head, smelling of tangy citrus hops. Tastes of crisp fresh citrus hops with just the right amount of carb. As Pliny used to say, fortune favors the brave, so with that, I crack my 6th. Salud!",Russian River Brewing Company,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,100
863,7971,Imbebe,4.85,"Had it on tap in a local beer bar in Folsom CA, it's was a wonderful experience. First glance, pour very cloudy with murky yellow. The smell was very extremely present, it went down quite nicely and it was very smooth. The Elder is a well balanced beer, world class beer.",Russian River Brewing Company,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,100
863,7971,qchic,4.57,"Pours a deep gold with peach highlights. A finger of head displays thick bubbles. The aroma is bursting with hop goodness--tons of grapefuit and pine. First taste is all grapefruit, and then that west coast bittterness, drying pine, fruity sweetness, some alcohol, melon. It definitely coats the tongue and finishes long and dry. Not sure that I would want to drink more than one 500ml bottle in one sitting, as it is so satisfying and flavorful, but it would be a regular treat if I had the access. No wonder Russian River can't keep up with demand!",Russian River Brewing Company,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,100
863,7971,JohnnyDuvel,4.82,"For my second bottle of Pliny, I decided to do a head to head taste test with another of my favorites to get a really good feel for this brew. I chose a Two Hearted Ale. I did a blind taste test. The Pliny was much cloudier in appearance, and the smell was far more dramatic. The hop fragrance lept out of the glass. It had more depth and body, and was the smoother beer overall. I love the Two Hearted, but it was a bit thin in comparison (I guessed the beers after a short time with the blind test). I also tried a bit of a HopSlam in comparison, but it is past it's prime now - too much honey, not enough hops. The Pliny is an extremely well balanced IPA, as good as any I've had. I would love to try it against an Alesmith IPA.",Russian River Brewing Company,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,100
863,7971,michaeltrego,4.18,"First timer for Pliny the Elder, and I must say the anticipation was intense. Thanks to saulcharlseworth for the trade!! We can't get it here on the East Coast. Respect hops, consume fresh! First impression: golden nectar color, crystal clear with bright white, medium head and pleasing piney hop aroma that doesn't overpower. First sip: mmm, nice but I think it's a bit too cold - it's masking the flavor. Swirl, let it sit for a few minutes. Mmm better, more aroma and flavor coming through. Nicely balanced, medium body, about 7.5-out-of-10 on the hop-richter scale. Halfway through, smooth, balanced, simple pleasing hop profile, that's not trying too hard. Final: well made, very well balanced, 8% sneaks up on you. Wait, I don't think I tasted everything, can I have another? Nutshell: fabulous as an IPA, but only great as a DIPA/Imperial.",Russian River Brewing Company,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,100
863,7971,nkersten,4.27,"Poured from a bottle dated 7/06/09, a vigorous pour resulted in about two and a half fingers of thin white head above a dark golden brew... In my opinion, this is what a IPA/double IPA should look like. Not too heavy on the dark malt to let the excellent hop character be the center of attention. Smell is of canned pineapple and grapefruit, with a little grassiness thrown in for good measure. A truly amazing smelling beer. Taste is similar to the smell, with pineapple coming in a slight bit less then the smell would have led me on to think. Lots of citrus and grassy flavor with just enough malt. As it warms the alcohol starts to lend itself to the flavor a little more. Mouthfeel is light yet not watery, with the hops being the dominant player here rather then having a sweet sticky mouthfeel from too much malt. Drinkability is good but not amazing. I really like this beer overall, but usually after 500ml I am ready to move on to something else. Overall this is an exceptional beer with only a few serious rivals in the best DIPA category.",Russian River Brewing Company,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,100
863,7971,Bung,4.45,"Received in trade from nomomentwasted, 2 weeks old not bad at all, especially since 5 of those days were spent in transit. Golden/orange pour, substantial white head. Sticks to the side pretty well as well. Is that a Christmas tree I smell? With a fruit basket under it. Surprising amount of malt characteristics. Citrus fruits, especially grapefruit and herbal piney hops. The hops really stay in control though, which seems so hard to find these days with all the hop nukes around. Really doesn't linger much in the throat, but you know you drank it, especially if you feel the need to belch. Wow is this a great balanced DIPA and the alcohol being just a hint lower is nice to. Can easily drink a whole bottle by ones self. Had little 2 oz. tastings before, but this is the first substantial quantity I've had and it does not disappoint.",Russian River Brewing Company,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,100
863,7971,fiver29,4.58,Bottle pours a clear golden color with a nice frothy white head. Has a real nice aroma to it. It reminds me of pine and citrus right away. The mouthfeel is medium and leads into a great upfront citrus blast. That leads to a great caramel malt flavor that finishes with a pine flavor. Overall this is a really nice brew. I am not sure how they managed to avoid hop haze with this one. It was so clear. Good stuff.,Russian River Brewing Company,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,100
863,7971,realmpel,4.5,"Hoppy birthday to me, hoppy birthday to me. This is an excellent double IPA, super hoppy in aroma and flavor. Pours a bright yellow with 1/4 inch head. Bright carbonation brings the pine and hop aromas to the nose. The taste is nice and bitter with the unmistakable taste of fresh hops.  It packs an alcohol punch, but it's a mellow punch. It's like getting whacked hard with a pillow. At 8%, I could drink a couple of these. They are so tasty that I just might do so.",Russian River Brewing Company,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,100

A solid IIPA appearance. On the nose is pine, citrus, lots of sweet hoppy notes. Very nice, one of the best noses around.  The first thing I notice is the mouthfeel, very full and thick, it's great. Got some really nice toasty notes sticking around at the end as well. Taste is really great as well. Got a lot of nice hoppiness to it, very complex with lots of really complex and interesting flavors. every sip is giving me more and more. Excellent beer.

863,7971,joshuadlight,4.22,"Reviewing my first bottle after having Pliny on tap a couple weeks ago. This is good but not as great as on tap. The beer is very, very fresh. Bottle on July 20th, less than a month ago. Golden tree sap appearance, small head leaves curtains of streaky lace. Spruce and other pine notes throughout the smell. The taste allows more of the balance that makes this delicious. Its great to be able to notice the malts on such a hop driven beer. The malts are not as noticeable, however, as the on tap version. Its just so fresh, the hops are lively and vibrant. Fluffy mouthfeel with billowing carbonation is pleasant, and the after effects suck all the moisture out of the mouth leaving it sticky and dry. I'm not feeling a ton of drinkability tonight though. One will be enough.",Russian River Brewing Company,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,100
863,7971,PSUBeerman,4.37,"Growler filled at the Craft Ale House, tulip glass  Pours a rich and clear golden color with a tint of orange. Good retention with the off white creamy head. Very sticky to the sides of the glass. Each swirl brought the head back.  Strong hops aroma, pine essence and a floral background. Citrus (grapefruit & orange) predominant as well. I could smell this as the glass was still on the table.  Flavor of course hits you hard with hops Citrus notes, great balance of bitterness and sweetness with a malty presence. Some creaminess, and many other flavors noticeable. Lots of things going on here.  Mouthfeel was tangy and smooth, great carbonation. This was very refreshing and well worth the wait. I am glad I have more in the fridge.",Russian River Brewing Company,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,100
863,7971,bret27,4.77,"Just an exceptional brew in every way. Been rated and praised so much I'll keep it brief.  Smell: Floral, oranges/lemons, pines, sweet hops.  Appearance: Gold Orange. Light yellow head.  Taste: Same as smell, but able to discern various hops in more detail. Tastes like they actually squeezed the straight nectar out of hops. There must be some malt in here to balance the hops but I can't really taste it. Bitterness on end of tongue. Hop citrus lingers in mouth, w/dry finish.  Overall: The thing about this beer isn't that it's the highest abv or most hoppy, but I think its the perfect balance of it all. You could drink it all day(which I kind of have) and it doesn't get old. It's the kind of beer where if you see it for sale in a store you just have to pick up a bottle. Whether its for personal consumption or to trade, its always a great beer to have on hand. Slightly better on tap than bottled, but freshness is key.",Russian River Brewing Company,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,100
863,7971,badbassrandy,4.5,"Half-pint poured at Falling Rock tap house in Denver, CO  A - Pretty, deep golden hue; transparent nectar; billowing craggy eggshell-white head and impressive lacing  S - A hop-head's dream: sweet and bitter hops of fruity, earthy, dank, citrus, spicy notes which erupt from the head and hint at the 8% abv  T - A brilliant boutique of hop varieties that dominate and overshadow the lovely malt base; tropical, citrus, sweet tones jump out and are overwhelmed by juicy, wet-hop tasting, dank bitterness that prickles the tongue; bitterness is in check, but this is clearly a hop bomb  M - Medium-bodied for a DIPA; gripping textures and a subtle-but-lasting cloying hop presence that prickles the tongue; bitter hops residue makes itself at home in the mouth  D - For hop lovers like me, easy to lift and swill and appreciate sip after sip until, sadly, it is gone and -- if one is lucky -- it's time for another. Drinkability for the style is marvelous, but the assault of hops and sharp, bitter, alcohol presence on the tongue means this is a palate-bruiser of a beer.",Russian River Brewing Company,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,100
863,7971,flagmantho,4.67,"Really looking forward to this one. Poured from 16.9 oz bottle into a pint glass. Bottled 7/6/2009.  Appearance: light tawny golden color with a rocky, persistent head.  Smell: I could smell this the instant I opened the bottle. I could probably smell it across the house. Great gobs of fresh hops, mostly what I would call spicy but some softer, more floral notes as well.  Taste: quite smooth; I guess I was expecting to be blown away with bitter hops, but this beer is more sophisticated than that. The hop flavor is spicy, sweet, smooth and fantastic.  Mouthfeel: medium-thick, this guy roams around your mouth, coating your tongue with its impeccable flavor.  Drinkability: despite the high alcohol content and the intense hop flavor and aroma, this is a highly drinkable beer. It could easily get me into trouble.  This was my first Pliny (of any generation) and it was delicious. I am still growing into my appreciation for Imperial IPAs, but this was a darn good place to start.",Russian River Brewing Company,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,100
863,7971,morimech,4.67,"Thanks nkerston for this beer. Bottled on 072009. Pours a hazy dark amber color with one inch of white head. The head slowly settles to a thick cap. Just a little lacing is left on the glass.  Aroma is a complex combination of hops. I pick up grapefruit, pine, and fresh cut grass. With all these hops it still is not overpowering like a lot of DIPAs can be. This might be an example of less is more.  Not surprisingly this has a hop centric flavor. Nice citrus and pine elements. Malt does make an appearance with just a touch of sweetness and some mustiness. Bitterness is high without being harsh or extreme. This truely is the benchmark for DIPAs.  Medium body with nice carbonation lending a soft texture. Even with the high bitterness this beer remains a pleasure to consume.  Highly rated or hyped beers usually do not score as high for me but this one is one very well crafted beer.",Russian River Brewing Company,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,100
863,7971,Natural510,4.53,"Pours a hazy orange color with creamy head and a complete layer of lacing which sticks to the sides of the glass. Bright perfume of citric & floral hops immediately hit the nose. Flavors of pine, grapefruit and honey; characteristics are fairly subtle and blend well together.

Flavor is classic IPA which is probably my favorite part its just more of it big hops bigger grapefruit and citrus flavor the complexities in this beer are amazing and all blend together to bring a very big but very classic tasting DIPA  Smooth and complex on the palate medium body with a perfect carbonation level, leaves a bitter sweetness on the mouth from drink to drink.

863,7971,naterock,4.77,Poured into a tulip with a one finger rocky head that sticks heavily to the glass.  Smell is incredibly complex with a grapefruit and citrus hop aroma with a piney nose. Some Apricot from the citrus and a sweet malt character that resembles candied sugar.  Tastes really unbelievable with the same complexities in the taste as the nose. Sweet grapefruit flavors and a sweetness that really impresses.  Mouthfeel is oily and decently carbonated with a long lasting aftertaste. Drinks easy but the taste makes you sip every last drop slowly.,Russian River Brewing Company,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,100
863,7971,Tomas77,5,Everytime I drink a Pliny it's like i'm opening one for the first time and each time I can't believe how incredible it is.  Appearance-Dark golden with an orange tint to it. Brilliant clarity with a small but tight white foam head. Good legs throughout. Incredible. Aroma-Huge hop nose right off the bat with a burst of lemon zest and pine. Some light fruit malt aroma is detected along with some bready notes that follow. Incredible. Flavor-Strong hop flavor with just enough malt backbone to support this imperial ipa. Very bitter aftertaste but not harsh. Lots of pink grapefruit shows up this time around rather than pine. Alcohol is evident at this stage but doesn't overpower the hop presense. Dry finish. Incedible. Mouthfeel-I love the way this liquid sits on my tongue. Body has a chewy maltiness with a resiny hopfeel throughout. Alcohol present but smooth. Incredible.  Unbelievable. I mean incredible.,Russian River Brewing Company,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,100

A- Poured into a snifter glass it appears a hazy orange color with a creamy white head that lasts throughout the session and produces great lacing.  S- Smells of both piney and citrusy hops, but also seems to have a solid, sweet malty backbone. A definite change from the other hop bombs I've had in the past.  T- A hoppy bitterness dominates up front, but seems to mellow out and give way to a sweeter finish.  M- Smooth and slightly syrupy, with appropriate amounts of carbonation.

863,7971,lifeboyq,3.67,"Huge thanks to the sommelier at my local grocery, Bruce, for pulling me aside and letting me know he got his hands on some of these. I've been wanting to try this for some time but it is hard to find in Washington state.  Poured into a Duvel Tulip. Smell is of high alpha percentage hops showing acidity and grapefruit. Not much malt character in the nose coming from the pale malts. Appearance is very clear with the proper amount of carbonation for the style and shows decent lacing. Taste is very one dimensional of over hopped grapefruit apparent in high abu offerings. The offering is crisp and clean and well balanced but lacks complexity. Mouthfeel is smooth and stays the same from the front to the back of the tongue and lingers powerfully. Drinkability depends on the desire for the lingering of fresh pinestraw.  I can understand the advantage of this beer among the style, as is it is clean and crisp. In my opinion it doesnt offer the complexity you would seek among the top beers of the world.  Update 8/11/09: Revisited this beer at a lower temperature given my rating is off from the norm. It is much smoother not showing the inordinate bite but masks the slight complexity that it offered at the higher temperature more complex offerings usually shine in, but improved drinkability. I've heard of strawberry tones but knowing the ingredients and yeast, feel that is a bit of a stretch. Perhaps fermented at higher temperatures and changing the yeast offering. Really solid imperial IPA but again, very straight forward. Should have accolades for the style, but definitely not even remotely close to a world class beer as this style is not suited for the highest rankings.  This beer in the top 50 beers is beyond laughable and 100% completely due to ignorance. Learn to brew and this is not a hard beer to duplicate or even improve. Try brewing an authentic world class Belgian quad.",Russian River Brewing Company,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,100
863,7971,jrallen34,4.65,"I drank this beer from the bottle into a chalice.  This beauty pours a pale dark gold, I'd say almost peach in color with a nice white head that disapears quickly. Lacing is ok, not special.  It smells like a typical IPA, citrusy, and hoppy. The hoppy seems sweeter than normal and notes of apricots.  The taste is very smooth and the bitter IPA ending is the best and most memorable I've had. It begs you have more and experience it again and again. Its so resfreshing and rewarding, simply one of the best I've had.",Russian River Brewing Company,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,100

The smell and taste have a perfect balance. The malts are delicious, with tastes of grapefruit and other citrus flavors. At the same time, the hops are strong with a great presence in the aftertaste.  What a great beer!

863,7971,bonbini26,4.97,"Fresh Growler  Finally, this is what I've waited for, this is why I drink beer. The cream of the crop from my favorite style of beers (well this and the Younger, but that will have to wait).  A- Pours a bright golden color, a lot lighter than most double IPAs, more single IPA looking. Fluffy white head that leaves a swiss cheese lacing down the glass  S- As soon as I removed the cap from the growler a burst of pine, citrus, grapefruit, fresh christmas tree almost with fresh fruits hanging from it  T- The taste of citrus, grapefruit, pine hits the tongue, some malt to balance out the hops. Has a dry finish at the end.  M- Silky, oily starts, not has heavy as most 8% DIPA's. The hops start suttle at the beginning and then highten in bitterness as you swallow it.  D- The drinkability on this is ridiculous, it goes down so easy and smooth, you do not taste the alcohol at all, you only feel it. Like most people say, I was trying to sip and savor this beer, but it didn't happen. This beer is so damn balanced with the hop bill and just enough malts to keep it in check.  Its almost a bittersweet feeling having this beer. I'm estatic that I was finally able to have this beer, and not in some lame 4oz. pour, but a whole growler of it. But now I don't know when the next time ill have this beer, maybe thats what makes it so good. Did it live up to the hype/anticipation, I think so.

863,7971,gmcfarre,4.69,"500 mL bottle poured into St. Bernardus chalice Bottle on 040709  A - Pours a cloudy burnt orange color with a respectable 3/4 inch frothy eggshell white head.  S - Whammy! Delicious, fresh hop scent overwhelms the senses with strong bubblegum and grapefruit coming to mind. A really nice subtle sweetness only adds to the pleasure and intensity of the hop flavors. Pine contributes with just a touch of alcohol spice.  T - Begins with some slight caramel sweetness that soon transitions to powerful hop flavors. Again, bubblegum & grapefruit dominate, with pine following. Somewhat floral. Lemongrass and citrus add to the mix. Finish is slightly bitter, but always leaves you wanting more.  M - Medium body with a delightfully chewy mouthfeel. Bitter, but never too bitter like many DIPAs.  D - Alcohol is there, but never plays a large role in flavor, scent, nor effect. Certainly one of the better DIPAs I've ever tasted. A must try. Glad they are shipping these to Colorado now!",Russian River Brewing Company,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,100
863,7971,SFLpunk,3.83,"500mL brown glass pry-top bottle. Dated 07-09-09.  Crystal clear orange amber with white sudsy thin head. Lots of dry pine up front followed by an earthiness and funk like manuer, light caramel malt, cardamom and pollen. Painfully complex nose. More sublte on the palate than I expected with more caramel malt than I'd think. Subtle waves of bitter orange peel, leafy bitter greens, and lots of palate gripping bitterness.  Decent, but not really my favorite IPA. Aroma is the balls and is why I score it so high, but the flavor doesn't deliver. Sorry.",Russian River Brewing Company,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,100
863,7971,erz316,4.72,"500ml, bottled on 05.26.09, served into leffe snifter. bought on ebay from lakerfan858.  A - a mid honey orange colour with a light cream-orange head, big crackly foam on top but the bottom is made of small bubbles. head doesnt form all that well, but it eventually does and retains very well. a pleasing colour for the body, sunset orange-yellow; it is the head that keeps this one from a perfect look.  S - amazing nose: apricots, alcohol, pine resin. the sweetness of the apricots blends perfectly with the piney, floral hops. maybe some grapefruit or lime rind.  T - the taste is good, but could be a bit more powerful. intial tastes are of light grassy/piney hops, slight apricot (though more like dried ones now, no sweetness), and some malt keeping the background lightly sweet. its nothing I'm by which i'm overwhelmed, but it is a solid start. the hop to malt balance is impeccable, perfectly even, but I would want to see the hops be much stronger than the malts for an iipa. the balance is an interesting interpretation on ingredient ratio, and flawless if this is what they were going for. the finish sees the traces of grapefruit and lime come out, this is where the beer picks itself back up from the evenness of the initial taste. this ephemeral existance of the citrus fruits goes back into the pine/floral hops, all the while the malts are giving strong backing. the aftertaste is of resinous hops and of course a perfect malt balance. the only thing I would have liked to see is more of a hop dominance, but the flavours in this beer are so incredibly varied and intricate that any lack in the preference category easily brings up the rating.  MF&D - the feel is too thin for my tastes and should have been a bit thicker, though not like syrup; for this beer would not benefit from being a hop syrup: the malts are too well balanced. nevertheless I would have preferred to have seen this brew a bit thicker. otherwise the complexion is pefect! the beer is very well carbonated and the beer has just the right amount of creamy mouth-coating-ness.  An exceptional beer, indeed. though I was not taken aback like many others, I cannot deny the excellence of this beer, but that certain would make it even better.",Russian River Brewing Company,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,100
863,7971,GRG1313,4.55,"Ordered today on tap with a great hamburger at Father's Office in Santa Monica. Great lunch!  Pours golden dark amber in color with a nice white head.  A nose of fresh pineapple and sweet pine. This is all about the hops! Huge fresh, crisp and bright grapefruit, grapefruit skins and citrus character and flavors. Lemon and lemon oil tones in nose, mouth and finish.  There is a quality character to this hoppy brew and it there is no question but that it is out of balance with hops. It's great! I love it. More brewers should make out of balance, hop heavy brews like this one! A winner, especially on tap.

863,7971,Cuzco,4.57,"Received this beer from steadydose in a trade. HUGE thank you Russell! Immediately put it in the fridge to chill for tonight.  The hype/anticipation of this beer had be slightly worried. Would it live up to my expectations? No, it didn't, it surpassed them.  A: It pours a crisp clear orange color with a ""fluffy"" white head that dissipates quickly but leaves a beautiful white lacing around the glass that stays throughout the experience.  S: Pine and citrus hits the nose immediately. Think freshly cut Christmas tree decorated with dried citrus fruit. This is a very good thing.  T: The pine and citrus continues from the nose to the mouth. This beer lives up to the smell. It has a dry finish that lingers on the tongue after each sip.  M: The mouthfeel is slightly lighter than expected with the appearance and smell. This isn't a bad thing at all just a bit lighter than expected.  D: This beer could go down way to fast. The alcohol is masked completely and you would never guess this beer was 8%.

A: Pours out a golden color with a one finger head emerging, head is white in color and frothy and bubbly in texture, good clarity in the body, head eventually settles to a few patches of foam that sit atop the beer, no lacing down the glass as I drink this.  S: Pine and grapefruit smack the nose as soon as the bottle is opened, possible detection of some other citrus in there but dominated by pine and backed up with grapefruit.  T: Exactly how it seems, just for me it was the grapefruit first followed up by the pine, nice bitter finish after each sip, alcohol is completely hidden, love the way this beer tasting and being less than three weeks old makes it even better.  M: Carbonation is done very well, good feel to the body of the beer, goes down very smooth, after each drink an oily resin texture coats the tongue.  D: This beer is amazingly drinkable, goes down super smooth and a great hop bomb with the pine and the grapefruit flavors, if you can find this beer very fresh (less than a month old) pick it up and drink it.

Grapefruit, mandarin and other citrus hit me all over with lops of great hop aroma. Not the best aroma I've ever had in a beer though.  Tasty. Nice a bitter but well countered with large doses of citrus hop. Good lingering bitterness. A truly great tasting beer and I'm glad I got to try this delicious nectar.  A nice rich mouthfeel with average carbonation that doesn't overwhelm. This really works well here.  Tasty, tasty tasty. There is lots of bitterness but it doesn't overwhelm and it just works really well.

863,7971,AgentZero,4.26,"A - Beautiful golden hue, huge head on this beer, a good 3+ fingers deep. Quick fade on the head, leaving some impressive lacing.  S - A lot of hops in this one, massive citrus and grapefruit smell overpowers anything else there may be. You really have to try hard to get anything past the initial strong, citrusy taste. Smells like it's going to pucker your mouth.  T - Hops hit you really hard, very agressive kick as it first hits your mouth. Drinking this is almost like drinking three different beers. In the middle you almost can't taste the citrus, as the smooth malts appear for a second. Finishes up quite bitter.  M - Minimal carbination, but works well with this beer. Solid feel, not oily or watery.  D - Very drinkable beer, not for those (like myself) who aren't huge hops fans, but you can definately appreciate how well this is put together. A very complex, impressive contribution from RR.",Russian River Brewing Company,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,100
863,7971,Skidz,4.55,"Pours out bright yellow and sits a gleaming gold in the glass with a large frothy white head, lending good lacings all around.  Hop bomb all the way in the nose. Grapefruit, lime, orange, caramel, bits of crisp apple, honey and rose petal-like sweet floral tones.  Bright and invigorating hoppy freshness in the mouth. Boldly hoppy overall. Light, crackery malts lend a touch of sweetness which supports the big dosage of hop oils and their aforementioned citric qualities and is abundantly rind-like in its delivery. Quite bitter on the finish, and will be feeling it for some time after this bottle is gone.  Delicate and crisp in the mouth with a moderate and finely delivered carbonation.  This beer is to say the least, most excellent. Were it readily available to me, I could perhaps see myself taking to one of these on occasion--but nothing more. I like my hops bombs just like anyone else, but this is one of those beers that makes you stop tasting anything else after drinking it.",Russian River Brewing Company,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,100
863,7971,scottyshades,4.85,"Thanks to vasdef42 for the trade!  A: Pours a transparent golden/copper color that produces a massive, monster off-white four finger head that dissipates slowly and leaves amazing lacing along the glass.  S: Holy hoppiness! A bouquet or floral and bittering hops dominate this aggressive nose- piney and resinous. Citrus and grapefruit are present and give this brew a nice fruity aroma. A small touch of malts help to balance the mass dose of hops, but only helps. I was not too impressed with this nose because of the perceived lack of balance (lack of malts), but for all you hop head out there, you will be in heaven.  T: Pure hoppiness! Again, piney/floral/bittering/and resinous hops right up front to slap you in the mouth. A little low on the malts to balance the unchecked, rampant hop attack, which makes this brew a little bitter. Nice bite at the end. As it warms, it becomes sweeter and more balanced, also the alcohol comes out eventually.  MF/D: Nice and full body. Finishes bitter and a little dry.  Believe the hype!!

The head dissipates into a patchy layer on top leaving decent lacing.  Smells of tropical and citrus fruits with hints of pine and just enough sweet malt.  Tastes similar to how it smells. The hop flavors are phenomenal but the malt flavors still manage to hold their own. Bitterness is strong and sneaky.  Mouthfeel is great. A nice thickness with grainy carbonation.  Drinkability is also great. I could drink this all day every day.

A - Golden in color. Transparent (DIPA, really?). Big white foamy head, maybe 3 fingers.  S - You can smell the hops as you open the bottle and once you plop your nose down in the glass it's just like brewing and opening up a fresh packet of hop pelets. Smelled a lot like Simcoe to me. I noticed some fruits as well.  T - Some people might like a heavy grain bill, maltiness to balance the crazy amount of hops but this one did an amazing job by making the taste of hops very smooth. It's like they just melted hops and bottled them.  M - An exteremly clean finish with ligth mouthfeel. Good carbonation to let the hops dance around on your tounge.

A finger and a half of fluffy white head emerges with the pour and is slowly fading, leaving a nice, sticky lacing.  Smell - A pleasant aroma emerges after the pour. An amazing smell of citrus, hops, and pine is prevalent. For the citrus, there is a distinct grapefruit/pineapple fragrance.  Taste - This is my third PtE and each time it just keeps getting better. The taste is superb, with the taste of grapefruit at the forefront for me (in this sitting - I swear it changes slightly each time). Extremely smooth yet bitter - complex in nature. This IPA really does put others to shame.  Mouthfeel - Smooth, relatively carbonated, but in a good way that enhances the overall character of this brew. Thicker than it would seem from looking at it in the glass!  Drinkability - Enormously drinkable. This beer continues to blow me away. They hide the higher abv perfectly, and this beer keeps me calling back for more and more. If I didn't have to drive tonight I would sit here and enjoy the other two I purchased!

S- This one is a hop/citrus bomb! Huge rush of grapefruit, orange peel, pine, and lemon aromas all make up the nose. Some light floral notes are present as well as some tropical fruit scents (tangerine, pineapple, passion fruit). I really hope this tastes as good as it smells...  T- Confirmed....it tastes just like it smells...delicious! Strong wave of grapefruit and orange bitterness. The hops show dominance and really pack a punch. There must be a trace of malt sweetness in there somewhere because the initial wave of bitterness recedes a bit. Finish is long and bitter. Really a great flavor.

The apperance was pretty average. It looked like an IPA, nothing more. The aroma was sweet, inviting, hoppy. The taste was pretty good. Not too hoppy considering. Resinous, piney, slightly citrusy. The light malt imparts very little flavor which is to be expected. The one thing this beer has going for it is the amazing drinkability. No alcohol presence at all.  It's a hop bomb. A pretty good one too. Very little complexity or depth of flavor. Just a really hoppy beer.

Hopiness is floral, piney, citrusy with a nice pineapple finish. There's a good malt quality as well that reminds me of honey. Mouthfeel is smooth, full-bodied & perfect.

A really well balanced double IPA. The smell of the hops made me think it was going to really shred, but it balances with just enough sweetness to make me want to gulp the beer down like juice. The foam is great, soft, delicate and fluffy when first poured. Then it breaks down into a thin silky/soapy layer with lots of lace.

Pours a rich golden color with a two-finger, rocky head that shrinks, but lingers. The smell (to me) was like a pine tree, but not nearly as pungent as I've had in regular IPA's, let alone DIPA's. The taste is hoppy, to be sure; but there's some malt there to keep it in check. The hops linger on the tongue quite a while after swallowing. Mouthfeel is nice -- light, with good carbonation.  Drinkability is a problem for me, however. (What is it with me and drinkability?) If all you're drinking is IPA's and DIPA's, it shouldn't be a problem. Otherwise, you should save this for the end of a session. The hops really do linger in the mouth, and could overwhelm subsequent beers.

A: Pours a hazy orangish yellow color with a finger thick white head that consists of very tiny bubbles. There is a decent amount of lacing that is left behind as the beer is consumed.  S: Beautiful aroma of citrus hops. Tangerines, grapefruit, and lemon aromas mix with just a hint of malt to remind you that it is a beer instead of a bowl of fruit that you are smelling.  T: A nice initial maltiness comes through on the first sip for about a millisecond. It is washed away with loads of citrus hop flavors that are not overly bitter like so many in the style. Grapefruit, pineapple, and oranges make this one taste a lot like fruit juice that happens to be bitter. The finish is nice and dry.

Small amounts of sediment in bottle, guessing it is hops from the dry hopping, maybe im wrong. Beautiful 2 finger head that laces the glass beautifully.  Smell - Oh my god the pine, it is wonderful. A wide array of hop styles can be smelled, piney, citrus, grapefruit, honey. Pine dominates here. A bit of malt and alcohol at the end.  Taste - Biting on a pine tree, drizzled with lime and lemon and a hint of honey. Bitterness comes through, fits along so nicely. This is amazing for a DIPA, this is the best I have had.

863,7971,marvin213,4.38,"Light brown, like a lightly dusted pine cone, the head caps a prototypical beer. Even to the commoner, the non-drinker even, this looks like a beer should look. Undoubtedly, I'm influenced and affected by the hoopla surrounding this beer. The bottle's unique, the label's informative, and the forthright marketing that encourages immediate consumption are all great. The beer offers a light, even straw-colored glow. It some ways it looks ordinary, but as it sits, the foam retracts ever-so-slowly, shedding its thick residue as it settles with liquid. It looks extraordinary.  The smell is very good and--as i expected--hoppy. There's definitely a more piney hoppy than any other variety. I'm not good enouch to ""name that hop,"" but pine predominates. Acknowledging time as a potential factor, I smell less citrus than I expected. Bottled on 5/18/09, only the cross-country journey could've hurt the beer. It must of been my mistaken memory (because the beer is fine and good--I tasted it), but I recalled from my first sample taste months ago that it was a much more citrusy pine. Instead, I sense more hop. The beer looks and smells serious.  The taste holds up to expectations. Looking for a some sort of flaw with this beer, I do think it's a little hopped up. I know, I know--it's named after Mr. Hop--but if you were to hand me this beer in a glass, me knowing nothing about it, I would comment on a subtle chalkiness attributable to the hop. Though I taste more lemon than I smelled, I would appreciate some more. The earthy, hoppy mouthfeel pulls more at my tongue and cheeks than it does at my teeth, and that's unusual. Perhaps I'm losing that sensation, but I expected more of that from this Pliny. It's 3,000 miles away and probably has to suffer some sorta despair on its undistributed route here. The raw power of the hop, however, shant go unrecognized. It's a great beer, and I wish I could partake more regularly.",Russian River Brewing Company,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,100

Acquired in a trade at DLD and consumed when I got home, about a month after it was bottled.  A: Pours a lovely, hazy, glowing peach color with a small yet creamy, bright-white head. Ropes, gobs, and sheets of sticky lace.  S: Incredible aromas of fresh-cut pine bough blended with peach, apricot, pineapple, mango, and other tropical fruit.  T: See above. Pine is most prevalent but this also includes loads of tropical fruit, apricot, peach, and spices.  M: Definitely spicier with more of a bitter edge compared to how it smells.  D: Worth every bit of the hype. Absolutely world class!",Russian River Brewing Company,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,100
863,7971,mothman,4.35,"Edited review due to having a fresh bottle from cali. Also had on tap in cali. Bottle dated 12/23/09  Poured into New Belgium Globe Glass  Pours almost 1 and 1/2 fingers of creamy beige colored head. Good retention. Leaves some splattered lace. Color is a nice hazy bright peach orange.  Aroma: This is smelling great. Everything a DIPA should smell like. Grapefruit citrus, some bananas. A bounty of fruits. Floral and pine hops tingle the nose (interesting).  Taste: Massive floral hops. A ton of citrus. Grapefruit, pine, honey. This beast is nice and hoppy, but not as big as a floral kick as blind big. Bananas and peaches are also present. The malts are very bready. A touch of alcohol is also near the end.  Mouthfeel: Not as bitter as I would expect, but the bite is there. I can imagine it being much more bitter when it is very fresh. Medium bodied. A nice amount of carbonation here. Leaves the typical dry hoppy aftertaste with a touch of booze.  Overall, very drinkable at 8% abv. Great beer at a great price. When I get to Cali I want to find this beer as fresh as possible (well, I got there). I really like this DIPA. I was however really confused that blind pig had a much bigger floral and hop taste. I think this is a great DIPA, but I was just a little confused with this one.  One more edit: after having them side by side I realized that Pliny packs a huge punch. It brings a ton of flavor and has a much larger body compared to blind pig. I am glad I had both of them side by side so I could realize this. It makes blind pig taste so like and almost watery.",Russian River Brewing Company,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,100
863,7971,Jmoore50,4.83,"Okay, so I did not understand why this was such a high rating brew until I actually started reviewing it, then I realized that giving it anything low would just be so supremely unfair.  The appearance is amazing. It has a great golden orange liquid gold color that comes with a nice one finger head that stayed only part of the time and left a medium to light lacing.  The smell was exceptional. It was everything that I thought it could be and so much more. It had citrus, a hop variety that made me explode in my pants, a sweet honey sugar smell, well damn it smelled perfect.  The taste was great. I like hop bombs that tear your head off and just give it to you like it is. This is not that. This is so well balanced that I could easily drink like a half keg of it, or until I exploded. This stuff tastes hop bitterness with hop sweetness with honey and sugars and citrus and goodness. It is entirely enjoyable the entire way down. For me this is awesome, but there are brews out there that in my opinion earn a higher ranking. Overall this is amazing and mind blowing but. . . I can most deff. say that it is not the best D.I.P.A. I have ever had.  Just overall amazing, would kill for Pliny the Younger. Going to grab a ton of bottles to bring home with me. Stunner!  J  EDIT: Had this again the past weekend in S.F. both at the Toronado and in bottles. The bottles were only one week old, thus me changing me review of the taste to a perfect 5. One of my favorite beers ever.",Russian River Brewing Company,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,100
863,7971,jdklks,4.52,"A- transparent, with a slight haze, amber-gold body with a beautiful pillowy white head that has great retention. looks like a west coast ipa through and through.  S- Sweet, sweet hops! or rather, bitter, bitter hops. again, smell is characteristic of west coast ipa. how i love to live on the west coast! citrusy, piney, with a hint of malts and fruity sweetness.  T- good overall flavor, though less so up front than in the finish. the finish has that hop bite that makes well-made ipas so good. up front it is slightly more balanced, with a strong malt presence, and less of a flavor explosion than expected from the smell. the finish is dominated by citrusy piney hop greatness, with a grapefruit bitter aftertaste.  M- a little thinner than would be desirable, but the after-effects of the hop oilyness that keeps your mouth watering and craving more makes up for it.  D- drinkability could be no less than a 5. could it be more? if only they allowed for it...",Russian River Brewing Company,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,100
863,7971,GeoffFromSJ,4.2,"A very good and well-made beer but... (there is always a ""but"") this did not live up to the hype for me. Don't get me wrong. This was a darn fine double IPA. Definitely in the top-tier of double IPAs.  Found in Tria Cafe in Philadelphia. Somewhere in the amber range with shades of yellow. Nice head in snifter glass. Lacing is good but thin.  I'm not picking too much off the smell relative to other double IPAs. Nice balance in the taste, if an imperial IPA can be balanced. Sharp bitterness at the end of the sip.  Final verdict: nice, but I'll stick with 90 Minute or Torpedo for my double IPAs.",Russian River Brewing Company,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,100
863,7971,drtth,4.52,"Served in a small snifter. Glass of cold water on the side to sip from periodically.  Appearance: The beer as served is a clear light copper/orange color. There is virtually no head, but there is a thin ring of foam around glass with patchy foam on surface of liquid. For most of the beer sipping leaves modest rings and lacing.  Smell: The aroma is mostly pine and resin, with hints of caramel and light toffee malt. The citrus here is buried in the background and is hard to pick up.  Taste: As expected from the aroma the flavor is predominantly pine and resin, with enough caramel malt and light toffee flavor to soften and cushion but not replace the hop flavors. Some background grapefruit citrus plays a supporting role as well but the lead belongs to the piney hops.  Mouthfeel: The mouthfeel is medium-bodied, with an adequate but not generous amount of carbonation, The finish is long, bitter and dry with pine and citrus again barely noticeable. Although there is clearly a malt presence it never breaks through to replace the hops, just supports them a bit in the background.  Drinkability: This is very drinkable. I kept wanting another sip. I would have had second one if time permitted, I'll drink this again in the future.",Russian River Brewing Company,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,100
863,7971,chicagobeerriot,4.32,"Acquired thanks to a trade with goodbyeohio. Pours a thinly veiled gold with two fingers of fluffy white head that creates some nice lacing as it dissipates. The relatively plain appearance does little to signal what lies ahead (call it the Clark Kent of DIPAs). The smell is mango and pineapple with some light pine and vanilla underneath. Mouthfeel is surprisingly light for a DIPA with lively carbonation that helps convey a variety of hop flavors without ever feeling too heavy. Not as much malt balance as some may like: a pleasant but brief vanilla/mango sweetness at the beginning is quickly dispensed with as the hop show begins. However, Pliny is not a blindly flailing hop jambouree either; there is some subtlety underneath the brawn. When the sweetness fades, the grapefruit hop flavors come in, providing a delicate transition before the stronger pine notes treat your tonsils like a boxer's speed-bag. The finish gives a delayed dry smack to the back of the throat and then a prolonged hop aftertaste that contains only a hint of the 8% alcohol. Very drinkable for a beer this flavorful: despite its complexity and intensity, the mouthfeel keeps Pliny a lively elder. Pairs nicely with sweet & spicy BBQ.",Russian River Brewing Company,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,100
863,7971,fbinla,4.9,"Poured with a huge fluffy head that disappeared shortly. Aroma is an intense grapefruit and cheesy? the incredible hop aroma is exactly like opening and inhaling an entire bag of fresh hops (as a home brewer i have done this many times). My wife describes it as smelling exactly like the cousin.  On the palate a huge hop bite then a small taste of maltiness with little to no sweetness then back again with a huge hop bitterness, this beer isn't about malt it's all about hops and it doesn't let you forget it. The bitterness stays with you and prevents you from drinking anything else but another Pliny and that's not a bad thing!",Russian River Brewing Company,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,100
863,7971,schmitter,4.64,"Well I finally know what all the fuss is about. This was definetely worth the trip. Got it on tap at the flying pig in Malvern, PA thanks to a tip from a fellow BA. Came to me with about a one finger head and appeared a deep, cloudy gold. It had a very strong, deep smell, almost skunky, with a hint of fruit. It tasted a wonderful lemony bitter, obviously hoppy as shit and herbal. Lavender came to mind after a few sips. So smooth and delicious. It left a very dry tast in my mouht afterwards, almost as if the hops were absorbing everything in my mouth. Now I will be honest, at first, I thought to myself 'whats the big deal"" its just another hoppy bear...' but clearly this is something else. just to be sure, i sampled the longtrail double ipa next and it was a joke compared to the pliny...now i just need to taste the younger!",Russian River Brewing Company,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,100

Unassuming label nothing fancy here. 500ml for $4.99, not bad considering the prices at the pubs. Nice size too.  Ok, I must say that there are many double IPAs out there but what makes this one so special is the aroma. Completely floral and pineapple-ly --- intoxicating.  Head is rocky, nothing special here. Taste is well balanced with the bitterness -- not over the top. Good sweetness and not that tongue coating you get from some other DIPAs.  Wonderful ale -- highly recommended.",Russian River Brewing Company,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,100

S: Every awesome hop smell I can think of: Pine, grapefruit, peach and pineapple. The smell reminded me of the first time I ever homebrewed: I sat next to the stove with a freshly opened bag of hops, inhaling them for about 5 minutes.  T: I was a little nervous after the smell, thinking that this would have a lingering bitterness to it. To my surprise, it didn't at all. It's all hop flavor without any of the negative aspects. I can't believe how much hop oil is crammed into a single beer. Tropical fruits dominate. There is some malt to back it up, too.  M: Way silkier than I was expecting. This is perfect. I think the mouthfeel is what prevents the IBU's from grabbing a hold of your uvula and refusing to let go.  D: Simply put, when fresh this is the best beer I've ever had. The only negative with it is its shelf-life. If you don't drink it within 2 weeks of bottling, you aren't getting the full experience. That is a tragedy.",Russian River Brewing Company,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,100
863,7971,blackc5,4.82,"Basically everything I said about the bottled version, but even moreso. On tap, this beer is just something really special. The flavors are all there just as expected, but the mouthfeel is really improved - silky smooth with a bit more carbonation and perfect body. Truly a joy to sip and enjoy.  All that said, I just updated my bottle review with a bit lower taste score. The last few bottles, dated 6/10/09, seem to have lost a bit of the hops flavor profile.

It poured a yellowed copper color with a lasting head and decent lacing. The smell is mostly citrus hops with a light herbal hops in the background. The taste was amazing. Not much malts, but they're not a feature of this style--just enough to get a nice balance. Pliny the Elder was very smooth (probably the smoothest beer I've had) and had great carbonation.

Very hop-forward taste as well, again with a lot of citrus and herbal qualities; really complex hop profile. Quite bitter, but still very palatable. Very light biscuity malt in the background.

There is some sweet pale malt in there, I can smell it if I really try, but the huge hop aroma overwhelms. Hop flavor and bitterness hit up front and alternate across my tongue. The same citrusy and resiny hops dominate as well as some pine and a bitter herbal flavor. The bitterness is so pronounced that I can feel it in my throat a bit, but the beer is still totally drinkable. Some fruity esters pop up in the finish, pairing well with the hops.

As i opened the beer I was fixated on its delicious smell. floral grapefruit goodness, like a summer flower garden in a bottle. the taste is comparable to a lagunitas having sex with a stone ipa, DPing your tough. very smooth and hoppy, boy i gatta get some more.  Good lucky finding it! i was told they don't make enough so if you see it buy it!!! i paid $7 for a pint bottle so yea try not to get ripped off. and as i find myself ending this review Im also ending this beer, Shit!! well at least i still have a lagunitas in the fridge. enjoy",Russian River Brewing Company,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,100

The taste is really good, follows the nose really well...a big hoppy flavor, citrus and pine, but not so overpowering like some DIPAs with also just a hint of sweetness.  The beer has a medium body to it, again which is a definite plus as most DIPAs are heavy and feel like syrup. The beer is smooth and rich with excellent carbonation.

863,7971,brokensail,4.97,"Seeing as Pliny has such an incredibly high rating, it has quite a bit to live up to, it has never disappointed me.  I chose to review it (finally) after my girlfriend brought me a 2 liter growler full of it when she had stopped at the brewery on her way back to So. Cal.  The color of this beer is a nice golden/slightly orange straw color with a good head on top.  The smell of this beer is amazing. I would say it is by far the most aromatically pleasing beer I've come across. Usually a (D)IPA has a pleasing smell, but this is on a whole different level. It's really difficult to describe, but lots of citrus and some mild pine, very floral. The smell of this is better than the taste of many other beers I've had.  The taste is as you would hope/expect it to be. Lots of hoppy citrusy and bitter goodness. Hardly any malt on this one, but just enough to balance things out on the end. Many times with a really hoppy beer you get a powerful/off-putting aftertaste, but nothing of the sort here.  Definitely the best beer I've had to this point.",Russian River Brewing Company,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,100
863,7971,ikats,4.97,"Pours slightly hazy, darker yellow in color (maybe a touch amber). Wonderful hoppy aroma - grapefruit and sticky pine notes. They should bottle just the smell alone. Taste is of course about hops as well; however, there is just enough base for the hops not to be overwhelming. There is some sweetness at the tip of the tongue and then hop bitterness fills your mouth and sticks with you for some time. Although this beer is very bitter it is not too over the top (I don't feel that it's all just about hops). The body is light to medium. Very pleasant mouthfeel. And for the style it is very drinkable.  This one tasty beer. I don't want it all the time, but it is just so terrific at the right moment. I brought a few bottles with me from LA a few months ago.

Clear w/a lighter orange-yellow color toward the narrower parts of the glass. Well-carbonated, coating the sides of the glass with thick foam.  S: The nose is loaded with hops; its thick and resiny. Pine and grapefruit notes dominate, nicely sweet with a hint of tree.  T: The hops are blindingly bitter, sweet with grapefruit and citrus notes. A floral, herbal flavor that's hop-heavy - the ale is quite fragrant, loaded with hops and not bashful in this regard. The caramel malts are most evident in the aftertaste, adding a graininess that mixes nicely with the hops.  M: Satisfying, deceptive and enjoyable. The hop profile is clearly the star.  D: The 8% alcohol is hidden behind the Spector-esque wall of hops. An epic DIPA.  I've heard (read) the hype. I'm a believer.

It is hands down the best brew I have had ever. Great for special occasions.  COLOR: Great color with a clean golden hue.  HEAD: Nice oily head fizzing with aromatic hops.  SMELL: My first whiff of the opened bottle was like being transformed into a giant sensitive nose with wings soaring over rolling hills full of huge piles of pine and orange grapefruit and lemon trees that had just recently been run through a shredder. I felt like I was being taken to another realm of beer. The combination of hops just smells choice.  POUR: beautiful orgasmic fluid with leggs sticking to the inside of the glass after the head subsides. Truly a magestic experience.  TASTE: The best part. Nirvana. Its like dying and going to heaven full of beautiful women wearing hop flower string bikinis. Packed with a crisp, fresh, piney, grapefruity, orange citrus taste. Full of delicious oily resin that coats your mouth leaving it with a tastey lingering hoppy eutopia. It lasts too.

863,7971,BBThunderbolt,3.65,"Served on tap at the Green Frog Cafe in Bellingham, WA from the only keg to make it north of Seattle. After years of hype and expectation, could this beer live up to it's reputation?  A decent looking medium/light straw color that poured with a lot of carbonation leaving more head than I prefer. The beer was very clear and the head left a solid amount lacing.  Yes, the aroma was predominately grapefruit hops but the pine scent lingered in the nostrils.  This beer was all hop flavor with little to no malt foundation on the tongue. The citrus tastes gave seamlessly way the sticky pine flavors, making for a nice flavor progression.  The body was very thin and gave a less than great experience in the mouth.  Drinkability was good but the beer drank too smooth and easy for an IPA. The beer drank as easy as water. Not saying that the beer was watery, but without the hop sharpness and malt backbone that make IPAs enjoyable.  Overall a good, solid IPA that I enjoyed, but found not worthy of it's place among the immortals in the heavens. A couple other thoughts. I had several of these over the course of a week so this review reflects the combined experience, not a single glass. I thought that 8% was a little on the low side for an Imperial IPA, Hop rod Rye is also 8% and considered a standard IPA, and in my opinion a much better beer. The beer may have suffered in my eyes due it's reputation, but I did not think this was the 7th best beer in the world as the rankings here show.  Edit 8/4/20. 16oz bottle ( courtesy 2beerdogs/Roguer. dated 6/29/20) poured into 14oz teku. Most of my above review holds true. I've had it several times now, and happily drink it each time. It's still a really good brew, and should rightly be considered an American classic. Drink it whenever you get the chance.",Russian River Brewing Company,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,100
863,7971,angelmonster,4.22,"Had this on tap at Falling Rock  Pours a 2 finger white head. Transparent golden, orange body. Head retention and lacing are good.  Smell is of sweet grapefruit, pine hops, not much else  Taste is of sweet citrus hops, slight alcohol. Not too bitter, has a nice balance  It is slightly over carbonated. Mouth feel is smooth going down. Light body but not watery  Drink ability is good for such a high abv. Hops dominate the beer but are not over powering. I need to buy a bottle of this and try it again as I thought it was good but not amazing as many people claim it to be",Russian River Brewing Company,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,100
863,7971,nomomentwasted,4.92,"I've had this beer a few times, both out of a pint-size bottle and on tap at Stone Brewing Co. most recently. The on-tap is better if you have the chance, the flavors really come out a bit better.  Appearance: looks great, good rich color and pretty decent head for a Double IPA. Nothing above any other good IPA, but great nonetheless.  Smell: Awesome. Rich pine and hop smells come quickly, with a slightly floral smell. One of the more fragrant noses I've experienced, especially on an IPA.  Taste: Great. Crisp, with major notes of hop and pine in a great balance. Barley is understated, with bitter and strong hops.  Mouthfeel: Crisp and fresh, the bite isn't too heavy on the drink, with only a slight bitterness afterward. Nice and pleasant  Drinkability: Awesome. The 8 is masked well and very session-worthy. Always leaves me wanting more, and have yet to be disappointed.  Comes highly recommended, as the reviews would imply.",Russian River Brewing Company,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,100

M-Very crisp and dry with a nice bite. Medium body, for my tastes the carbonation level is perfect.  D-I could easily put quite a few of these away without thinking twice.  This is an excellent DIPA.

Served nice and chilly with a white bubbly, foamy head. Great smell of floral and fruity hops. Clear and deep golden with an amber color. The taste is great, but can change depending on when/where you have it. The best I've had was actually from the bottle - a great refreshing taste of strong floral hops up front, then the fruity hops hit your palate, followed by just the slightest hint of well-covered, crisp alcohol. Very refreshing and drinkable for a double IPA.",Russian River Brewing Company,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,100
863,7971,TheViceBlog,4.97,"Everytime I drink this one I enjoyed it more than the previous. The fresher the better!  I've yet to have Younger, but I've had most of the other ""major"" IPAs and this is the most fragrant and tasty one I've enjoyed so far. So, so fragrant, like sticking your face right into a pine tree.  More pineyness and floral flavors on tastes, an explosive hops sensation, beautiful balanced, delicious.  A smooth, smooth mouthfeel, even for a fairly big boy this goes down as easy as a flat macro. I could drink these all night. Unfortunately, living on the east coast, I rarely get access to PtE. Actually, maybe that's a fortunate thing. I'd certainly abuse it like a crackhead if I could!  Can't wait til I one day get to try this on tap straight from Russian River.

S- The first thing I get is citrus and pine! It starts out grapefruit and pine needles that transition to pine and tangerine. Awesome!  M- The mouth feel is very nice, it's not too light, actually almost creamy.  D- Great carbonation that has a piney, peppery and hoppy finish.

Very clean, dry and in your face woody hop cone aroma!  T - Again, hops all over the place with hardly any sweetness at all.

S - Great scent w/ a blend every grapefruit you can think of ruby red, pummelo, and pine needles w/ sweet orange blossom and valencia notes  M - Crisp dry feel w/ only the slightest malt sweetness. drenched in hop oily texture and high amount of bitterness w/ low astringency. The texture is resinous w/ floral feel and has a dry, acidic warm finish  T -The pleasant bite of citrus grapefuit tanginess and acidity w/ piney hops sharp edge and more resinous pine flavor w/ mild lemony sweet orange notes. The taste has a light sugar tinge w/ floral elements and a finish that is dry and spiced hop taste similar w/ warmth similar to a jalapenos kick  D - A fantastic Imperial IPA any way you slice it.

Solid all-white head and leaves great sticky lacing.  S: Piney piney piney hops with a faint background of grapefruit.  T: Follows the nose, with an addition of a little bit of meaty/bready backbone. Hard and lasting bitterness.  M: Each sip inadvertently takes a while to swallow. This beer is so coating for me that it takes a couple gulps to get the entire sip down (maybe it has something to do with what I just ate) Medium-low carbonation.  D: Hmm, hard to say for me. With some good food I would love to have several of these, but alone honestly I don't think I want more than one (I feel like I need a change of pace).  I have to say that I am just a little bit disappointed. I know there is a huge debate about this so take it for what it is worth, but I would have liked some other flavors to be present here balancing (somewhat) the hops taste.

863,7971,farrago,4.07,"Pours a moderate one finger head of off-white, mixed bubble size foam, some stickiness to the lacing whereas the head mostly gone in about a minute or so. Light golden-yellow in color with a metallic orange tinge which brightens more than darkens, comes extremely close to transparency. There's a certain bluntness to the nose, like it kicks there door open and then just stands there unmoving in the door way, thick pink to white grapefruit, tangerine citrus notes resonant yet not juicy nor zesty per se, in turn the floral notes more citrus blossom than well-rounded ""musk"" and the peach, nectarine, pineapple, papaya fruit scents present more thrust than expansiveness, not insanely hoppy nor grassy but sufficient enough to put any malty scents way in the background. Medium-bodied, too tightly wound as well as aggressively carbonated to really get full-bodied. Peppery mouth entry, quite spicy, forestalls the grapefruit, mandarin orange citrus component for a tick or two. Pine resin clearer here, florality a little more hidden. Doesn't come off as that dry, hence more juice in the peach, nectarine, mango fruit and less tropical bite. Sweet tea leaf oils accrue with time and at the very end you can tease out some cocoa powder. Can't say it's not balanced but when you don't risk many agile dance moves, hard not to be.

Half-inch, off-white foam holds steadily, leaving a sudsy lace. The hop dominant aroma leads with pine notes, as citrus fruit stays more in the background.  The taste begins with a wonderful orange/grapfruit tang, balanced decently by the toasty malt. Solid bitterness, but less than I expected. The finish is excellent as the dry pine notes leave you wanting more. All aspects of the flavor agree nicely, and nothing gets too intense/harsh. The overall taste is nearly perfect, it seems effortless. Medium body, moderate carbonation, very nice mouthfeel.  Overall a world class IPA. Always best fresh.

The head really stuck around on this for a while, it was quite impressive. I was about half way through the pint and there was still a thin layer of foam. Beautiful lacing on the glass.  S: Not as much of a hop punch as I was expecting, but I had rather high expectations. Pine, citrus, floral. It's wonderful.  T: Wow, as soon as I had it I knew it would be the only beer I was going to drink all night as moving to anything else would leave me disappointed. Pine, citrus, wonderfully bitter and well balanced by the malt.  M: Mouthfeel is good, it didn't blow me away, but there's nothing I would change about it.

Appearance: Pours into my tulip a light golden color with the slightest hints of amber/strawberry highlights. Skim of white oily lace is left from a 1/2 finger fast-fading head. Slippery, sticky lacing slides around the walls of the glass with the clear, somewhat viscous-looking carbonated liquid.  Smell: Smell is slightly sweet and slightly bitter, some dry, peppery rye or pumpernickel, light piney, oily hops, slightest fumes of alcohol. Really nice and surprisingly mild.  Taste/Mouthfeel: The taste is so impressively mild and well-balanced. Slight notes of many different hop profiles - floral, citrus and pine altogether. The pine shines through with toasty malts, slight stick-sweet and oily. Light bready grains and rye in the aftertaste along with a mild, yet ever-present alcohol vapor. Feel isn't terribly carbonated but really nicely matched with the style. It has some weight to it that fills the mouth well, but doesn't feel too heavy or sticky.  Drinkability: Surprisingly high for a DIPA.

863,7971,GSK,4.82,"This is my first BA review. Went on a trip to CA bay area and found this in the cooler in a wine shop in Napa, and had to have it based on all the BA reviews I had read previously.  Bought the 500 ml bottles on 5/28 and noticed they were bottled on 5/26! Unfortunately we only had our plastic hotel water cups to pour into. It did pour a nice head which didn't linger long, and looked to be a deep golden color. (Hard to tell in the plastic cups.)  The smell and taste were very piney hops with undertone of grass and grapefruit. It felt very good in the mouth and had a long lingering bitter, but satisfying, aftertaste. For a high hop beer this is very drinkable.  Very good beer and very drinkable. I will definitely be getting this any chance I get!

Smell is pretty much all bitter piney hops, slight citrus presence but wish for a larger one.  Taste is earthy piney hoppy goodness, fairly raw tasting with a bitter aftertaste, would have preferred a more citrus presence though.

Must be getting blasé  My second pour (yes, MF, I had TWO), was quite heady - about 2F of frothy white head - plenty of sticky lacing, and it was a partially opaque, orange color with some carbonation.  Lovely bouquet of floral, citrus, and piney hop - touch of malt in there as well. No turn-off from the alcohol, which can sometimes make a DIPA a bit scary.  Flavor & Mouthfeel was all-dat-n-more... Punch of west coast hop bite, but so well balanced with a rich, piney sweetness that it just makes you smile.

Back end of a sip settles into a nice, dry, almost mouth-puckering pleasingness. Alcohol is prevalent, but definitely in the background.  Mouthfeel - As I said before, very nice refreshing citrus up front followed with the impending dryness experienced by any IIPA.  Drinkability - Unbelievably refreshing, I could (and probably would if given the chance) drink this until sleep or unconsciousness sets in. The best IIPA I've had in terms of drinkability.  Overall, one of the better IIPA's I've had, though not the best. Overwhelming citrus taste, but lacking the complexity I expected.

863,7971,stephens101,4.67,"My first RR brew. Highly anticipated, highly legendary, and I'm highly thirsty for some of that addictive bitter elixer called the double IPA. Thanks to jwelsh for the hookup.  Two fingers of foamy and bubbly light tan head sit atop a hazy and visually pleasing bright copper and orange brew. As the head recedes some broken sheets of lacing appear at first, and eventually diminish, turning into small dots. My wife likes the aroma, and that is promising. Or not. An initial whiff reveals some effulgent citrusy hops with some resiny notes mixed in. Upon a second whiff some orange peel, sweet bread and a hint of sweet malts figure into the equation. All the aromatic elements are distinct, yet concerted.  On the palate, citrusy and oily hops, sweet malts, bubblegum, cotton candy and lemon all exist. The taste is surprisingly subtle, and it's not the hop-bomb that was expected. This subtlety is it's genius, and sets it apart, as all the elements are noticeable, but cohesion usurps the extra bitter superfluity many DIPA's strive for. The alcohol is well concealed (although it becomes a bit more apparent as the brew warms) and the drinkability of this beer is stellar, especially taking into account the style. Mouth-feel is a pure medium; not overly heavy, and not overly light.  When I approach a beer that is this highly regarded across the board I have two initial thoughts. First I think that hype and trend probably sway a lot of folks, and it really can't be THAT good. Secondly I wonder if I might subconsciously rate the beer higher than I normally would, just because of the aforementioned hype, which can be very subconsciously persuasive.  I can honestly say negative to both counts, as this is beer lives up to it's name, and shows us why we rate beers, which is so we can explore our doubts, work through our skepticism and hopefully realize what each unique beer means to us good or bad.",Russian River Brewing Company,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,100

A - Pours a slightly hazy golden color with about one finger of white, fluffy head that leaves ample, sticky lacing. Nice retention on the head as well.  S - Very floral hops with a slight, sweet maltiness in the background. Complex hop aromas including citrus(grapefruit), some ""flowery"", and a bit of pine.  T - Quite similar to the smell. Citrus (mostly grapefruit) and pine flavors dominate with a very nice floral, hoppiness that has somewhat of a ""flowery"" quality to it in the background. Very intense and complex hop flavors with just enough light, sweet maltiness to balance it out. Nice level of bitterness that isn't too overdone.  M - Medium bodied with a fairly resinous mouthfeel. Fairly light on the carbonation. Smooth drinking.  D - For a DIPA clocking in at 8%, this beer is extremely drinkable. Very well balanced and it has so many nice hoppy flavors.

I read it as December 5, 2008, meaning...NOT FRESH! But I don't really know for sure...  Poured into my SN pint glass. So far, it reminds me of Blind Pig...two finger creamy head, with some sticky lacing. The body was a bit hazy with a burnt copper color.  The smell is not at all what I expected. It was somewhat simple like an IPA. Mostly spicy hops with some citrus notes. No real malt detected...very floral...lilac???  Taste...WOW!! Good solid hops up front, not faded as I would have expected(maybe I can't read the freshness dates right). There's that sweetness again. Is that a West Coast thing? This is what I call balance. Nice bitterness midpalate.  The mouthfeel is thick, yet smooth. It seems low on the carbonation, but it works here.  Drinkability...the alcohol is well hidden, making this a super refreshing quaffer of a beer!  Overall, is this the best beer in the world? IMO, no, but is it worthy of all the praise? Yes!

This is a smooth drinking beer.  This tastes terrific! Piny hops and some bitterness but not out of control. Russian River has kept this beer in perfect balance. Some alcohol later on.

T - Crisp and fresh, this brew has the best flavor profile of any IPA I've tasted. The bitterness of the hops is perfectly matched by the malt. Lots of citrus - the orange and peach flavors stand out, as they did in the nose. I love the tropical fruit flavors, too: papaya, mango, even a touch of pineapple! The finish is long and complex - the floral notes on the nose come forward most prominently on the finish. So well-balanced and so addictive.  M - I can't get over the deliciousness of the citrus flavors - drinking this brew feels like biting into a ripe summer peach.  D - The hype is very well-justified on this beer. This is an absolute joy to drink. I would say that this is the best IPA I've ever tried, and maybe even the best beer I've ever tasted.

Lots of lacing down the tulip.  The smell is powerfully floral, like dandelion crossed with honeysuckle, maybe a little cedar scent.  The taste is all of those, with pine, leather, honey, some mineral tang. The finish is plenty bitter but not overwhelmingly so. There's very little alcohol burn. As it warms, the floral notes come out stronger.  It's mildly carbonated, seemingly a little more viscous as it warms.  It's one you want to gulp, but sip out of admiration.  An excellent beer.

Pliny the Elder keeps a thick and tall pillowy head all the way down with light carbonation. it is cloudy with very little amount of floaties. It does so much more than leave lace, it adds a whole white screen around the glass.  the smell is of citrusy hops and maybe some barely there caramel malt. The hops are so, idk, rich like passion fruit.  t- early light caramel right citrus and then more grassy hops, very enjoyable. an exciting load of candied mandarin oranges.  m- all the complexity of great hops and lots of hops with a great body.

Very nice looking tho.  Smell- Clean, hoppy, slightly bready. Notes of citrus. Quite inviting.  Taste- Mmmm...hoppy....aurghghgh. But seriously, nice blend of up-front hops with malt and malt sweetness. Obviously, the hops dominate. Notes of pine and citrus come through loud and clear. This ain't the best DIPA I've ever tasted, but it's pretty damn good.  Mouthfeel- Medium body, good carbonation. Nothing great, but it fits well within the style guidelines.

I was really expecting this to be way better than Hopslam and Nugget Nectar.  Lighter in color than most DIPA's...moderate head. Aroma is of fresh hops, like you just opened a package.  Taste is predominantly fresh hops. The malt is a bit thinner than Nugget Nectar but a bit thicker than Stone IPA. The crafting of this beer is impressive. It is not a hop tea, but the malt does not get in the way of the hops...at all. It is very well ""balanced"". Maybe a bit heavy on the grapefruit for me...  Carbonation is a bit high, but the mouthfeel and drinkability are both excellent.

The nose seems to be remarkably stable given it seems as intense from the bottle I bought in Washington as it was when I drank it from the tap at Russian River. The ""C"" hops are holding nothing back from the nose to the mouth as the piny citrus notes dominate everything. Given its status as a double IPA it is surprisingly uncloying with a clean lasting finish. However, the lasting impact of the hops on the tongue and roof of my mouth gets it a slight ding for drinkability.

Pliny pours an amber orange color with a nice glow and a faint white head with nice lacing. A great looking beer.  The smell is amazing, one of the all time best smelling beers I have ever encountered. Just a blast of fresh grapefruit, citrus and hops. The smell of this beer alone is worth all the hype and all the work to get a glass.  The beer tastes just like it smells, grapefruit, lemon a faint trace of pine underneath. What an intense hop flavor, the hops just burst through the front of the mouth all the way to the finish of the beer and they linger...  The mouthfeel is smooth, nicely carbonated, crisp and well balanced. I like the mouthfeel of the Vortex I more, because it has a drier finish with a slightly calmer after taste, but this beer is excellent.  Very, very drinkable.

863,7971,DannyS,4.73,"Finally, I have the privilege to review this one, acquired in a trade with Chaseabeer. Poured into my Duvel tulip from the distinctive 500 ml bottle with the humorous and minimalist label. Bottled on March 9th of this year.  A - Amazing. A beautiful hazy orange amber with a thick, resilient pillow of foam that clings like mad, and leaves heavy, sticky lacing. reminds me of Duvel's super-duper pure white head.  S - sweet floral pine comprises the fragrant hop aroma, backed by good malty sweetness. Citrusy grapefruit also wafts up to the nose in a delicate ballet of nature aromas.  T - Bitter? A little bit, but hardly overwhelming. The hops are so strong and flowery, but the bitterness is so subtle and subdued. Slightly sweet and grapefruity, with more pine and malt to round out this ridiculously balanced flavor profile. I was expecting a tactical nuclear strike of hops, but the attack is varied and balanced, winning the war of my taste buds. Finishes surprisingly clean, and not dry at all, with only a little bit of lingering bitterness.  M - A full, heavy mouthfeel combined with modest carbonation makes this a fairly weighty brew, but still manages to be easy drinking. Would be perfect if it were just a tad more bubbly.  D - The alcohol is hidden with unbelievable expertise, and it's just so tasty and easy drinking. If this were available in my area and had a more modest ABV, I'd drink this religiously.  Overall: Hopslam surprised me and slammed the door open to the world of DIPA's. DFH 90 minute took the time to further entice me. Ruination almost ruined me to the whole style. And now, Pliny the Elder has preached to me the good word of the hop, and I'm sold. Every bit of hyperbole this beer has garnered is well deserved.

863,7971,portia99,4.87,"500ml bottle (bottled on 4/7/09) poured into a Duvel tulip glass. Received in a trade from Arbitrator - thank you, thank you, thank you.  A - Poured a beautiful clear, orange gold with a dense 1 1/2"" white head. The carbonation bubbles are incredibly small and fine, seem much smaller than I find in other beers. Head lasts a few minutes - dissipates to leave fine lacing on the glass. Steady stream of carbonation rises from the bottom of the glass.  S - Amazing. Very fresh bottle. Dominated by piney aromas, but mixed with citrusy, grapefruit aromas. There is no containing this. Just about perfect for me.  T - This is the best tasting DIPA I've ever had. Hops dominate the flavor. Grapefruit and pine are prominant. Enough malt to balance, but hops are the real focus here, as they should be. Everything a DIPA should be - this really sets the benchmark.  M - Full and maybe slightly oily. The incredibly small carbonation bubbles give a fairly unique mouthfeel. The carbonation is still quite prickly, but there is a real smoothness to this. Not quite like a nitro tapped beer, but the smoothness starts to approach this (don't really know how else to describe this, or how they accomplish this - a definite plus for me though).  D - For a DIPA, I would call this quite drinkable. I'm not noticing the alcohol too strongly in the flavor, but I'm already feeling it a little half way through the bottle. I figure I could have a few of these in one session though (if they were readily available in MA, oh well). Don't go down as easily as the Blind Pig (exceptionally drinkable), but I didn't really expect it to be either.  Wow...this is an amazing beer.

The lacing that is left behind once that head resides is very nice leaving behind fine bubbles like you just washed your glass with soap. The hop aroma hits you before you even bring the glass to your nose. Citrus and pine come through so wonderfully. The taste is what you would expect from the aroma and it being a DIPA.

I'm also picking up something that is in the direction of mango with pineapple.  Taste is grassy and dry up front, with a reflexive mouth pucker from the hops leaping across the palate.

Liquid is a clear SAE/ECE amber, a large seashell head blooms rapidly with promising retention. The lacing is dense and adhesive, and fine bubbles surface continuously as you drain the glass, nearly to the very bottom.  The nose erupts with hops, but presents cleanly: grapefruit, pineapple, tropical flowers, a little grass too once it begins to warm.  A malt backbone balances the hop flavors and relieves the palate from the bluntness of astringency; though, the astringency is there in successive waves well into the finish. At the end of the finish it isn't clear if it is a mild sweetness arriving or a bitterness departing, either way it is very pleasant.  Light-bodied, highly carbonated, slightly warming...

Also a little sour note to it. Very faint bready smell to it. The hops for sure overpower everything else in the smell.  T- Oh man that is a wonderfully fantastic beer. There is a nice underbalance of malts and hops with the hops taking more of a high road. But still this seems to be a really balanced beer. Does that make any logic at all??? Nice crisp hop bite with grapefruit and citrus tones to it. I can taste a little malt backbone but not much.  M- Good carbination..making the mouthfeel lighter and seem to float over the palate. Nice hop oily feel on the tounge that makes this beer stick around for a while once it goes down the hatch.  D- This thing is so dangerously drinkable.

863,7971,HalfFull,4.17,"Unimpressed by Blind Pig on tap I gave it a chance from the bottle. It failed but I thought I'd do the same for the Elder. Decent on tap but not overwhelming, I've found a sample bottled all of 7 days ago. Fresh is best they say, doesn't get much fresher.  Poured from a 500 ml. bottle into a large wine glass, this guy pours a similar golden honey in color yet offers a nice half inch of medium density slightly off white head which leads to some nice lacing, eventually just some scattered surface bubbles remain.  Smell too is improved in the bottle vs. the tap. The same blast of hops is there but a bit more complex. Improving as it warms to offer some ripe fruit and occasional pine notes.  Taste is interesting with some citric notes initially, a hop oil flavor in the middle, finishing somewhat coarse and bready. At first this hit me a bit too hard and had a smoky flavor, becoming more balanced with a little exposure. Somewhat creamy on the feel as the carbonation settles a bit too swiftly exposing the malt underbelly and segueing to the thinness of it's tap version. Still highly drinkable, particularly given the strength, and I can now see some association to the Younger in this bottled version.  Surely better than the tap glass I had and surely much fresher at 7 days old. I might have confused this with Pure Hoppiness, though perhaps a bit more viscous and buttery.

863,7971,amneziak,4.57,"Appearance: Like Russian River's other IPA, Blind Pig, Pliny the Elder pours a bit lighter than one would expect of an IPA. This one is a slightly cloudy pale orange color with a very nice amount of lacing that coats the glass. There is not a severe amount of head, but enough to really help carry the aromas and open the beer up in the mouth.  Smell: The smell is one of the truly remarkable elements of the beer. I don't think I've smelled an Imperial IPA that is this clean before. The hops are very bright here and smell just like you'd want them to smell. It doesn't take on too much of the pineapple and mango qualities as much as it does peach and mango. This is definitely one of the more supreme smelling hop beers I've tried.  Taste: Along with the aroma, the taste of this beer is very clean and hoppy. There is a fair amount of bitterness that does take over the flavor. I'm surprised at how light this tastes, but that is one of the great things about Russian River - they always make clean and intensely flavored beers. I'm really loving just about everything that's hitting my mouth right now.  Mouthfeel: I would say this is medium bodied just bordering on being light. As I said, the bitterness is very nice and the light nature of the beer makes this very enjoyable on the palate. If this were something I could get on a regular basis, this would be my BMC of choice. Very drinkable indeed.  Overall: As with most people outside the small distribution area of Russian River I had really high expectations for this beer. I can tell you that my expectations were met and maybe even exceeded a bit. I had previously had the Blind Pig, which seemed very subtle (yet well-made), and the same can be said about Pliny. While it is definitely more intense than Blind Pig, it's not as big as some of the other greats (Dreadnaught, Hop Stoopid, Hopslam, etc). It is, however, worthy of all the praise it gets and deserves to a place in the ring with the others.

There is a slight refreshing burn at the back of the throat, either from the hops or the alcohol.  M - Crisp, slightly burning from the hops, but smoothed by the malt.  D - easily drinkable for all occasions, especially with the relatively high ABV.",Russian River Brewing Company,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,100
863,7971,Duhast500,4.85,"My 150th review:  Poured from a 22oz. bottle into a pint glass.  The color a light yellowish orange, hazy with a great amount of foamy and bubbly white head.  The smell is very piny. The floral hops are very evident here. It tickles your nose and gives you a preview of things to come.  Finally the taste, the taste that has been building for months and it is good. The amount of hops is pushing through all other flavors. Being an IPA it gives you just the right amount of hops, floral and some citrus hops as well.  It has a great feel to this beer. It is a fantastic brew. An IPA for the ages and it really is worth the wait.",Russian River Brewing Company,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,100
863,7971,jake19drinks,4.97,A: Ive been fortunate to have had Plenty before and I would definetly have to say not as excited due to the last batch. This one had a light amber ale appearance. The previous one was a much lighter color close to yellow. Still all and all I thought it good representation.  S: The smell is overwhelming of wonderful hops. Highly intense aroma right off the bat. Very pleasing to the nose for those who love a good wake up call.  T: The first sip I took was wonderful. Immediately covering my tongue with some intense hoppy oil. Not really much of a trace of malt. I mean it's there but that's not what you'll find in front. It's something I can sip on all day and night.  M: Mouthfull is very nice. It's makes me want to swish around my mouth for a while then finish up with a nice gargle before swallowing.  D: This is a no brainer. If I could get this on a regular basis I would be their biggest contributor.,Russian River Brewing Company,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,100

S: Huge grapefruit up front with some other citrusy flavors blending in. You also get a really big whiff of sweet oily hops.  T: Big on grapefruit and citrus again. Nice oily hop flavors saturate your tongue on its way down. Finishes slightly dry with a very pleasant bitterness.  M: Its actually pretty full bodied, but its not as heavy as some other full bodied IPAs.  D: I love fresh Pliny. Phenomenal example of the style I would drink this beer anytime, anywhere!",Russian River Brewing Company,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,100
863,7971,katan,4.2,"500ml into a pint  A - Pours an orangy hue of a color. Head formation is fairly strong, but breaks down to a light white film. A bit hazy - not very filtered, but I don't think it is yeast.  S - Ahh - a RR beer, can't miss it. Very earthy spicy hop slap to the face. Reminds me of a field on a hot Iowa summer day - like pollen. I can't detect much more than hops, hops, and more hops.  T - Starts off more sweet than I thought it would be - generous amounts of two-row sweetness here. Mid-stream the bitterness builds very quickly. Finishes with a hard hit of the earthy hops detected in the smell. Aftertaste is more of the same hop bite, but it almost tastes like a malt+hops science experiment on my tongue. By far a hop assertive ale, but not near as out of balance as I found blind pig.  M - I find this beer to be moderate to light in weight for the DIPA style. What is there is built on a creamy body and not really from the carbonation. The alpha acids that this beer is undoubtedly made from leave an oily texture on the tongue.  D - Not sure how to define drinkability here - this beer's abv isn't too bad but at the same time the alpha acid beat down does begin to wear on me. Not filling - so as far as DIPAs go, I can probably handle this one well.  A strange experience - I love the beer but at times I feel like I'm gnawing on a plant while walking beans back home.",Russian River Brewing Company,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,100
863,7971,JamesP123,4.82,"Served from bottle. Bottled on 4/7/09 - drinking as I type.  A. A dark yellow hue, not quite an orange or amber color. Half inch of slightly off white head. A tad bit darker color and it would have been a 5.  S. Oh man, great piney scent, grapefruity with a little malty sweetness. Smell is intoxicating.  T. Amazing balance of hops and malt. The flavor is delicate yet powerful, and not over the top. Mildly bitter, just enough to keep you coming back. Not going to eat your tastebuds like other IIPA's.  M. Mouthfeel is smooth with small carbination. Crisp bite rolls across yuor tounge. Not overly thick or resiny as one might expect from all the Hop flavor.  D. May be the most easliy drinking IIPA I've ever had. A truly epic beer that sets the bar for IIPAs",Russian River Brewing Company,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,100

Pretty good lacing.  S: Strong smell, of hops, pine, hints of fruit. Smells great.  T: Much like the nose, hoppy but balanced, great hop aftertaste. All kinds of flavor, and the alcohol is hidden.  M: Good carbonation and smooth, a little sticky.  D: Could keep going and going, but the ABV would eventually put an end to that.  This is a great beer, and you should try it if you can. On tap if you can find it, but from the bottle it's still great.",Russian River Brewing Company,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,100
863,7971,alovesupreme,4.42,"Served in a snifter. It should be noted that the bottle was about 6 months old. A dark yellow color with a little haze. An interesting head that was not foamy but bubbly and looked like soap bubbles. Lots of pineapple, honey, a little alcohol and white pepper. Spiked pineapple juice is probably the dominating feature. Once again honey is present along with orange and a slight hop bite. Very syrupy consistency, would be nice if a little more carbonation was present. A fantastic beer. Im sure that when this beer is fresh it is at the absolute top.",Russian River Brewing Company,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,100
863,7971,seaoflament,4.7,"I bought this bottle yesterday at SouthBay Drugs and Liquor. I first reviewed this beer from the tap during the Stone 11th Anniversary Event, back in the summer of 07. Just recently I noticed that I haven't reviewed this beer from the bottle and that tap review doesn't do this beer justice so now I'm reviewing this beer from the bottle. Bottled on: 040709...How is that for fresh!  Into my Pizza Port pint glass it goes. Pours a golden orange color with a rocky two fingers of foam. Great retention with some lacing.  Juicy orange, grapefruit, sweet lemon, and hints of pine with a sweet cracker and caramel malt background. A little more pine and some grass later on. More tropical aromas of tangerine, apricots, papaya, nectarine, peach, and some mango. A bit of orange candy too.  Very similar to how it smells. Starts off with a combination of bitter orange and caramel malt with a bit of toast as well. Medium bitterness with orange zest, lemon zest, caramel malts, toast, and a pine finish. There's also some bitter nectarine, un-ripe apricot, and a fruity alcohol just barely noticeable in the finish. A bit of orange candy near the middle with dry and bitter lemon in the finish. After a few sips I can taste hints of papaya near the end...not a big fan of papaya but I sure don't mind it in my pliny. There's just so much flavor in this beer. There is quite a bit of hop flavor (fruity, citrus, piney, grassy, slightly herbal) and then the light caramel, cracker, and toast malt so perfectly balanced.  So smooth with medium-low carbonation. Truly a benchmark for the double IPA category.",Russian River Brewing Company,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,100
863,7971,mullenite,4.03,"Not a 100% fresh bottle but I won't get to drink this again anytime soon so I'll review it anyway. It's about 3 months old.  8/17/09 - Had a fresher bottle (about a month and a half old) last night so I will update my review as such.  Poured a slightly hazy light orange with a TALL foamy white head and thick beautiful lacing all the way down to the bottom of the glass.  Smell is very strong pine hops, no notable malt character to the scent at all, just pine hops. [Fresher bottle had a slightly more noticeable citrus/grapefruit thing going on mixed in with the pine but not very strong. Scent is still dominated by pine]  Taste is, again, mainly pine hops. Maybe a slight biscuity malt flavor in the background but the pine malt stands out the most. Some grassiness as well with very little grapefruit lingering on the back of the tongue. [The slight malt flavor in the taste of the older bottle isn't there, the beer is not overly bitter but the flavor of the hops is the strongest part.]  Medium body with perfect carbonation and a bit of a sticky finish. The hop taste lingers for some time.  Very easy to drink, I can't imagine how hoppy this stuff is a couple days away from the brewery.  [Overall, having the notes to compare to there was little difference in a 3 month old bottle and a month and a half old bottle, despite what the brewery says this beer seems to hold up just fine for at least 3 months. It's close enough that I don't need to change any of the review numbers.]",Russian River Brewing Company,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,100

Poured into my Piraat tulip, the cloudy apple juice colored beer looks more like an unfiltered hefeweiss than an IPA. 3 cm head fades quickly but leaves some nice lacing. Nose is pure floral hops and it smells great, nothing else there that I can detect though. Taste is very smooth and perfectly balanced. Hops linger from the start to finish but are never over pronounced. Malt balances the beer throughout. Beer is light bodied and it's tough to detect the alcohol, hard to believe we're looking at 8% on this one.

Delicious and with a bitterness that isn't going to make your cry. Alcohol is cloaked in it's citrus blanket. Prolonged almost orange rind like linger.  M: Nice oily medium body.

Taste is crisp and clean with a good amount of carbonation. It starts with a slight pepper that quickly fades to a bitter pine with some tangy grapefruit. It's the perfect hop balance, light on the peppery centenials or cascades and a hearty dose of floral varieties. There's a caramel plateau with a nice toffee crispness.

Taste isn't as hopped as I thought it would be. I've got to say I'm a little disappointed, but it's still a great taste. Mouthfeel is exceptional, alcohol content is absent which is great because it doesn't take away from the flavor the way most IIPA's do.

You can only imagine my surprise and delight to see this at a tasting. Big thanks to wespatrick for sharing.  Pours a clear golden color. Small head dissipates quickly, leaves a small ring of foam, but with plenty of bubbles.  Smells like a citrus grove in the middle of a pine forest. Very nice sweetness.  Pine isn't my favorite. I like to read reviews before trying IPAs, because I'm heavily citrus-biased. That said, I still loved Pliny. The pine isn't overdone; it's not like drinking a glass of liquefied pine needles. The piney finish is actually pleasant for me. That's when you know you have a good brew...when they take a flavor you don't love, yet still make you love it. The ABV isn't at all noticeable. Fairly clean finish.  Pretty light feel with good carbonation. I could easily drink this all night if it were readily available. Just delicious.",Russian River Brewing Company,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,100

This is another of the beers that are difficult to come by in Utah, So I hope you'll forgive me my moment of star struck exuberance.  The pour from the bomber into my snifter is a beautiful one. Radiant honeyed gold with a medium white head. Aggressive carbonation keeps it around. Elder laces well.  The smell and flavor are incredibly hoppy, and particularly strong in the pine/citrus arena. There's a thin candy shell of sweetness wrapped around the whole thing, but the chewy center? Hops. Many of them. Angry legions of hop ruffians out to mug your palate and steal your senses. Later on, there's a transmutation toward the finish to a flavor that has at least traces of dough like breadiness. Very, very, very good. traces of florals and fruitiness are found throughout.  The mouthfeel is a solid medium body with good carbonation. The two combine to deliver a wonderful aesthetic treat for my mouth.  Drinkability? Wow. How drinkable is Pliny The Elder?

Immense aroma of sappy pine needles, grapefruit, papaya, and faint sweet malts hiding in the background. Entry is much like the nose, with strong oily pine and citrus hops coating the tongue in a most pleasing manner, sticky to a degeree. Malts although present, playing a meek second fiddle. Finish is semisweet malt with orange marmalade and grapefruit fade. I would like to drink this for the remainder of the afternoon into evening, but you just can't. With the some of all it's parts, one would think this would be cloying or over the top after a while, but it's not. The alcohol is extremely well integrated here, to the point where trouble could and would come very easily if one hasn't planned out a safe way home already. Beleve the hype on this puppy.

863,7971,rasta16ry,4.6,"I've been hanging onto this bottle of Pliny since late February, so I figured I'd better drink it before it gets any less fresh. I've had it fresher before, and I'm sorry I didn't just drink it the day I got it, but it ended up being awesome anyway. I poured it into a pint glass, and it was very bubbly and a bright kind of yellow/orange. It had a pretty one inch head, and it kind of sparkles when it's sitting there. Really a nice looking beer.  The smell is great, piney and Christmas and citrus and hops and grapefruit and all sorts of bouncy scents. It really smells and looks great.  Plus the taste certainly matches the smell and look too. It doesn't even taste like an IPA to me, it's kind of its own category. Maybe I'm exaggerating, but I really wouldn't lump it in with any kinda style because I feel like it cheapens it a little. It's more refreshing than an IPA usually is, even though there is some bitterness at the end of it. It really is a hopzilla, and no malt to speak of. But the pine, citrus and other stuff is definitely in there and it helps to make it taste refreshing.  This beer very much reminds me of Christmas, and I think I like it better than the Blind Pig. I will get as much of this as I possibly can, whenever I can. I'll even save it and have it less fresh, because it's still great even then.

Smells like a pine tree and a hop garden had baby's. This is that offspring.  Taste is much like the smell, but better balanced. If it wasn't for the lingering aftertaste(which isn't a bad thing) this would be a perfect 5.  Mouthfeel, again that aftertaste comes into affect but its amazing aside.

The lacing is good, not overly sugary, but still shows where you've pulled.  Smells rather like that Maharajah, in as much as it permeates hops straight away. Some slight sweetness in there that hides the overly citrus hops that hit you straight away. I swear to goodness, I smell something that reminds me faintly of cheese in there....but in a good way. Slightly floral notes in there like those of the Hercules DIPA from great divide.  Tastes like it smells, at first. Hops and wet grass, some tree bark in there too. Then the initial citrus acidic hit of the hops are washed away as the malt takes over. I actually find this beer to almost get more hoppy and acidic as the beer goes down.  Great full to medium mouthfeel with minimum effervescence, just the way an IPA should be.  This goes down well, and masks its 8% well, unlike other DIPA's who's over exuberance in becoming high in abv can lead to an over powering alcohol taste.

863,7971,asabreed,4.47,"16.9 oz. bottle into a Brooklyn tulip. Bottled 03.03.09, so it's still pretty fresh.  Appearance: Slightly hazy peach color with good carbonation and raindrop lacing. I noticed a lot of yeast on the bottom of the bottle, so we'll see how that changes the dynamic of the flavors with subsequent pours, if at all.  Smell: Hugely piney more than anything, though as it warms there's heavy peach nectar and tropical fruit. Lots of resin and sap aromas too. A big spiciness to everything. A bit of a floral and herbal component also as it warms. Big and complex with a lot admire each time your nose is in the glass (which should probably be a tulip, chalice, or snifter, in my opinion).  Taste: What I like is the tropical fruit and peach aromas come through in the taste, but it's still a kick-your-ass DIPA, not one relying on a huge malt backbone. This is definitely for a hophead. A bit of breadiness and nice apple skin as far as the fruit goes. But the bitterness is full on, and very nicely done. Long finish with huge citrus flavors and spiny, spicy hops, along with some juicy apple and ripe peach poking through the bitterness and grapefruit characteristics as it warms.  Mouthfeel: Nice carbonation with both an admirable medium fullness and enough micro-like bubbles to help the flavors come out without being too much on either side. It gets better, not surprisingly, with subsequent pours and as it warms.  Drinkabilty: Hell yes. I'm not sure it's my favorite DIPA, but it's certainly up there, and is worthy of all the talk. They do a hell of a job with this. And for as complex as it is, it's too easy to drink, mostly because there's are so many things to taste and pick out. Which is, of course, awesome, and awful.

863,7971,sarahspat,4.77,"I've been looking forward to drinking this beer for a long time. Thanks to raoulduke37 for hooking me up with this and so many other great brews!  Beautiful peachy, sunset orange color, with a steady stream of rising bubbles early on. When I hold it to the light, I see quite a few tiny floating particles, which I actually like, even though this causes some people worry. Sizable fluffy off-white head, which leaves a few globs of lace behind.  The nose is comprised of christmas-tree-caliber pine, citrus, peach, pineapple and subtle floral notes. In short, a very nice DIPA smell and then some. I've seriously never smelled such an amazing pine scent in a beer before, but the fruit smells are no less powerful. Gotta love that candied pineapple!  The taste is just amazing. It even exceeds my (very high) expectations. It echoes the smell, but surpasses it in force. It starts off bitter and piney. There is a full-force, but short-lived glimpse of sweet tropical fruits, candied pineapple and white grapefruit, and fresh oranges somewhere in the middle. Pine sap and bitterness slowly take over and become increasingly more dominate leading into the finish, which is very piney, very bitter and dry. What else can I say about the taste?... Hops... Hops... Not much malt here, or if there is, you can't hear it over the volume of the hops.  This beer has probably the fullest mouthfeel of any DIPA I've ever had. Very thick and smooth. It's pretty drinkable too; I put back the whole 16.9 oz. bottle without much trouble. Not much of an alcohol flavor, but the bitterness is a little extreme... suits me fine, though.

This is awesome.  T: Unbelievable. I don't drink many IPAs, let alone DIPA's and this beer is ridiculously good. It's crisp and refreshing, it is not bitter at all, creamy, lots of hop oils. This is my favorite ""pale"" anything beer. There is orange oil in the taste too. Deep, complex, and refreshing.  M: Perfectly carbonated, oily slick, and creamy. I couldn't ask for more.  D: About as good as it gets for the style. I could have more than 1 of these no problem.  I was skeptical when I heard the hype, but it still exceeded what I had heard about it.

This beer involves the senses. Smells of fresh lupulin glands. Incredibly floral. This is honest prologue for what you are getting. Perfect bitter for my taste, and an exceptional pine-forward aroma hop, graduating to fresh citrus, and sweet flowers from some retro-olfactory sense.

Pours a murky, cloudy orangish gold. Huge frothy white head billows on the top of this beer. Gorgeous. Great fluffy retention. Some globs present on the glass edge. Little whisps left behind as well. Really a beautiful beer.  The nose on this is like no other. Just a perfect bountiful smack of pine, grapefruit, pineapple, hibiscus, and a nice spicy finish. I just wanted to dip my nose in deeper and deeper. I could snort this froth. Mouthfeel is nice and crisp, clean, and slightly wet. Very easy to drink. Not thick, not thin.  This beer packs the punch on the flavor, no doubt about it. Huge grapefruity hop presence that finishes with a hint of burnt toast. Slight alcohol zip mixed in as well. Just an absolutey magnificent beer! This is dangerously drinkable as well. Much more so than the Younger. With the alcohol value where it is, this could do some damage for sure.

What a beer.  Pours a downright beautiful golden and copper with a slight haziness to it. The off-white head billows and bubbles leaving phenomenal spider web-like lacing all over the glass. I can't wait to taste it again.  This is by far the hoppiest, most floral-smelling IPA or IIPA I've tried yet. Hints of lavender, vanilla, and the usual citrus including some lemon zest.  This is a powerful, hop-infested IIPA, but it is not overpoweringly bitter like some of its less balanced cousins. There are definite malt highlights here, with the pine taste of hops. It is great that the grassy hop spiciness is only a highlight to all the sweetness going on.  Finally, the mouthfeel is clean and crisp but also very creamy. It's great to taste the brew with the foam at the same time - like a fine beer sampler platter, without all the fried calamari and shit. As far as drinkability goes, this would be my ultimate go-to session beer, if I could get it on tap around here, without having to drive to L.A.  This beer was one of the first I ever had at Toronado SF. It completely changed my views on IPA's, and beer in general. This is my ""gateway"" beer for all new potential beer advocates. It usually does the trick.",Russian River Brewing Company,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,100
863,7971,SpruceFish,4.57,this was my 1st pliny  A- hazy amber this is how DIPAs should look off white head with some white lacing around the glass  S- super fresh hops very floral and citrus grapefruit maybe even some lemony smell is great  T- wow this tastes great every DIPA and or IPA should taste like this; huge fresh hop taste wow i love it; very floral and citrusy  M- very smooth great carbonation  D- if only i had another one  notes- this beer really does live up to its reputation,Russian River Brewing Company,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,100
863,7971,MasterSki,4.65,"Thanks to nanoslug for sending me numerous bottles of Pliny of the past six months. This one was bottled February 24th, '09. Served in my Kuhnhenn tulip.  A - Huge three-finger pillowy off-white head that has solid retention and patches of spotty lacing. Hazy golden apricot color with lots of tiny bubbles racing to the top. Not quite as handsome as Pliny the Younger.  S - Huge hoppy goodness, with loads of citrus (fresh red grapefruit, orange, lemon zest) as well as some pine and floral notes. There's also a delightful caramel malt backbone. Extremely well hidden 8% ABV.  T - Usually my big complaint is that beers don't taste as good as they smell. In this case, the taste is every bit as good, with loads of citrus and some tropical fruits as well, mixed with pine, and a few floral hints. Again it's got some nice caramel sweetness at the fringes, but the hops are front and center. The aftertaste is bitter, but not overly so.  M - Smooth, creamy, medium-bodied, with the perfect (moderate) amount of carbonation. Finishes slightly dry, but leaves tons of oily, sticky, hop resins behind. There's a touch of warmth as it goes down. Just wonderful!  D - Even more drinkable than Pliny the Younger, which is quite an accomplishment. Perfect level of carbonation, superb taste and texture, well-hidden ABV, and moderate residual bitterness. It's exactly what I want from a DIPA.  Oh, I love the 500ml serving size too.

Some sweet fruitiness  Tate: Still piny hops but they take a back seat to big grapefruit flavors. Hop character is big but balances very well with the sweet malts. Complex sweetness that stands up well to the hops.  Mouth: crisp and a big dry on the finish. Alcohol is laid back but become more noticeable as the beer warms  Drink: Highly drinkable, as in drink until you can't lift the glass anymore.

863,7971,doppelmeup,4.37,"Poured a sunshine yellow with nice sticky lacing and a pillowy head.  Aroma was very nice. The closest fragrance I can think of to describe it was grapefruit marmalade. Also hints of pine and orange.  Flavors of pine, bitter grapefruit. Not much sweetness to balance the huge hoppiness. I would like it better if it were a bit more balanced.  Fairly light and dry mouthfeel, with the beer sticking to the top of the mouth and lingering for quite a while after swallowing.  Overall, this was a very good beer. I think I was a little disappointed, given the beers high ratings.",Russian River Brewing Company,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,100
863,7971,mykie73,4.57,"At many times but first time with notes.  bottled 2/24/09; drank on 3/04/09  a) beautiful transparent gold w/ tiny champagne bubbles. plenty of carbonation. two finger head w/ bigger bubbles that remind me of a root beer float  s) cascades, grapefruit, citrus, pine needles, want to walk through a forest of this beer  t) delicious sweet, balances, hop juice from first taste to finish. Faint bitterness on back of throat. No alch taste at all. would like maybe just a hint of more bitterness.  f) nice and light, no coating. my preference in a DIPA  d) can drink this all night...and have on a few occasions. i like this much better than younger imho...younger is just so rare and one of a kind...this is one of a kind on its own",Russian River Brewing Company,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,100
863,7971,Ranbot,4.65,"Bottle dated 2/24/09 thanks to a trade from Docer. Poured into pint glass.  Nice orange-gold color with good head - moderate lacing. Very floural hop smell. Taste of sweet malts and very floural and slightly piney hops. Some fruity pineapple flavors. After taste has hops and some malts lingering in a way that makes you thirst for more. However, there's so much flavor after swallowing that it's a perfectly fine beer to sip for a long time. Mouthfeel is very light and refreshing, but not at all watery.  An excellent IPA, no doubt. I love IPAs like this because I can drink them slowly and savor them for a long time. It reminds me a lot of Bells Two Hearted to be honest.",Russian River Brewing Company,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,100
863,7971,JohnQVegas,4.55,"Bottle into Sam Adams Lager glass. Bottled 3/23/09, Drank 4/3/09. 12 days old is fresh in my book - Huge thanks to henry (Bankhead) for landing this one in Brooklyn.  Pours a slightly hazy copper-gold, with a fluffy, pillowy one finger head that settles into some soapy suds, with lots of nice lacing.  Nose is nice - sweet citrus and grapefruit rind, clean and unfettered, followed by a nice whiff of fresh pine. Green and fresh. Very nice.  Taste is - hops. Pretty much all hops. Clean and piny. Grapefruit rind and huge pine keep any malt presence shoved way down towards the bottom of the glass. Almost no astringency, and bone dry to boot. Finish is long and lingering, more of the same, maybe just a bit tannic, pine and grapefruit rind. Beautiful in the same way super fresh Nugget Nectar is beautiful - the hops here are just set up on a pedestal and worshipped. Hop tea as much as it is beer. Oh, and 0 alcohol presence - this could have been a 3% beer, which is kind of astounding.  Mouthfeel is fairly moderate all around - medium bodied, moderate but not overwhelming carbonation. Like all well carbonated beers, the flavor is never overwhelmed by the carbonation.  Drinkability? This one is perfect in that column. No way you could make a more drinkable 8% beer with these kind of hop levels. Brewers take note: it isn't about bitterness and IBU's, it's about hop flavor and character. I love my syrupy DIPAs too, but this one is in a class of its own. Fantastic.",Russian River Brewing Company,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,100
863,7971,Genghis22,4.7,"500ml bottle, dated 3-9-09  A - Pours a beautiful golden honey color, with a nice creamy white head. Lots of little champagne like bubbles floating in the viscous nectar.  S - Smells like a hardcore, in your face, West Coast IPA! Hops, Hops and more Hops. There is a subtle sweetness as it first enters the nose, but it quickly turns to pine heaven.  T - This beer takes no prisoners. It is an all out hop assault, just what I like in an IPA. Huge amounts of pine with a sweet taste at the end. The aftertaste is bitter with a slight alcohol dryness.  M - Thick, syrupy, and overall very pleasing. Moderate to heavy carbonation, but the bubbles seem to very fine, like a good champagne.  D - This is the benchmark for a West Coast DIPA. I'm hard pressed to think of a better example. This is not for everyone though. If you're looking for sweetness and balance, this is not your beer. If you're a hop lover that thinks a DIPA should be first and foremost all about the hops, this one is for you.",Russian River Brewing Company,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,100
863,7971,isubsmith,4.39,"Had one of these last night that was brought back from CA by a friend.  Appearance: Golden yellow with an off-white head  Nose: Lots of citrus hops smell. Grapefruit, grass, pine.  Taste: Very clean, not overwhelming. Crisp and refreshing. The hops provide a nice up front citrus taste. Finish is a bit sweet.  Mouthfeel: Very smooth. Medium carbonation.  Drinkability: Not being a huge hop head, I was surprised at how mellow and drinkable this beer is. Probably my favorite of the night which was really surprising. The 8% ABV is completely hidden. I'd love to get some more of these.",Russian River Brewing Company,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,100
863,7971,timmay41,4.8,"500ml bottle, 1/23/09 bottling date (just before my birthday, kind of cool).  A: Pours a hazy marigold with light yellow highlights. Offers a solid 1+ finger thick, fluffy eggshell white head with medium sized carbonation bubbles. Good lacing and retention.  S: Incredibly strong, flavorful, pungent bouquet. Pine, oak, and semi-sweet citrus scents that combine orange & grapefruit with thick malt character.  T & M: Really sharp hop bite and bitterness with the first few sips as well as lots of carbonation. I've had quite a few DIPAs lately in anticipation of this one and it still delivered the most aggressive and awesome initial hop bite. Incredible. Character grows more complex as the temperature warms--slightly sweet malt quality comes through, along with pine needles and a distinctly resin hop taste. Medium carbonation that contributes a crisp, lively quality to the mouthfeel and taste. Dry, aromatic hop finish and aftertaste.  D: I'd love to have a brewery fresh bottle, but it's tough being over 3,000 miles away. I'm honored just to have tried this one. I could put this down until my face turned into a hop plant. There's alcohol here? A world class offering that lives up to the hype for sure.",Russian River Brewing Company,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,100
863,7971,merryjoulton,4.48,"Poured a liquid goldenrod color. Decent head retention that laced down the glass for the entire experience. Smells of grapefruit, pine, and peach.

863,7971,Kegatron,4.72,"On tap at O'Briens (San Diego, CA) on 3/20/09. Part of a full day of Russian River beers here. Served in a pint glass.  Pours a crystal clear gold with a finger of rigidly foamy brite-white head. The retention on this is just fantastic, with a rich and creamy look that leaves awesome looking sticky lacing back. The aroma is simply phenomenal! Just the perfect blend of floral and piney hops, tropical fruits, caramel, and toasted bread. Nothing takes control at any one point, with equal bits of hops and malt. Perfect.  The taste is pretty much right there with the aroma. Lush with resinous hops and tropical fruits that should probably pucker the mouth but don't, thanks to (once again) that perfect balance which comes courtesy of an almost candied sweet tasting mix of caramel and toasted bready malt character. For me, the hops really only show their true strength in the finish, emerging once again with a spicy lingering bitterness that hangs for a good bit in the mouth with a dry feel. The mouthfeel is medium bodied with an incredibly smooth and creamy feel to it. There is maybe just the tiniest bit of warmth present (but not nearly enough for a 8%) beer. Just fantastic.  There isn't too much more that I can say about this beer that I haven't said already in my bottle review of it, except that it's just that much damn better on draft! One of my absolute favs and definitely my favorite hop forward beer period.",Russian River Brewing Company,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,100
863,7971,ryrust5301,4.22,"Appearance - Light gold color with a chalk white head that bubbles up similar to dish soap. Bubbles do lay down to rest on top for quite some time to give it a nice crown. Very soft looking, as it's very very clear and easy to see through. Almost looks a little too light, like it might be laking in body and a bit in flavor. I hope not.  Smell - Ubber hoppy like all good west coast double ipa's should be. Of course there's some grapefruit and citrus notes, but it's very soft so as to not upstage the breadwinner. A sweet note is also detected somewhere behind all the crushing hops.  Taste & Mouthfeel - As I thought in the appearance, this one drinks clean and is not very heavy at all. Very refreshing crisp taste, which helps not to bog it down and makes it easier to drink. There are multiple kinds of hops combined to give this beer it's backbone, but they just don't stomp on your tongue as much as they should. Citrus and a little bit of honey carve out a sweet side to give this beer a little bit more of a changeup to throw at you.  Drinkability - Let me just say that this is a pretty good beer. I don't know if it's deserving of the top 10 accolades. I like my double IPA's to be a little bit more of a palate crusher with a bigger body and a thicker mouthfeel. This one is a little to clean and soft for an elite score. I sure as hell will never turn one down though.",Russian River Brewing Company,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,100
863,7971,ShrLSU,4.62,"I've had this a few times but I'm drinking the one davod23 sent me so I'll credit him with the shoutout and thank you!  A - Clear golden orange with a light bubbly head around the rim and a slight have on the top. Leaves nice lacing on the edges.  S - PINE!!! Straight up pine hops to the core. Some slight citrus notes as well but pine dominates.  T - Nice and sweet up front with the citrus hops then a big burst of piney hops. They mellow out in the mouth with some traditional bitterness but oh so smooth!  M - Medium to high carbonation, a nice clean feel in the mouth.  D - Refreshing to the core. This is a great beer for hop heads. You want hops, this has hops. It's just the right amount. Anymore and this beer would be oversaturated.",Russian River Brewing Company,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,100
863,7971,HeroJH,4.5,"Finally got my hands on a few bottles of this. I've heard the hype for so long, and it didn't disappoint.  A - Some nice sediment on the bottom, so depending on if you include it or not (I always do). Great head, long lasting and nice lacing. Gold/Yellow color.  S - Pretty good smell. Nice amount of the whole spectrum of hop smell. A fresh herby smell, like fresh basil (not dried basil). Clean  D - Nice bitterness but it also has good full flavor. There is still a good beer behind all those hops. Again the taste of hops and a touch of fresh basil.  M - Nice gravity on this, it has substance. Clean and refreshing.  D - wow, 8%? Very easy to drink, you wouldn't know it. I had trouble drinking this slow, as I just wanted to constantly taste it. I could have a few bottles, but considering how far I have to drive to get it, I just have one at a time.  I really liked this one.

863,7971,LilBeerDoctor,4,"On tap at Capone's. Pours orange with no real head. Aroma of citrus, grapefruit, and hops oils (similar to Younger). Flavor lacks the grassy hops I got in the bottled version. More malty and not as fruity as I remember (although more citrus comes out as the beer warms). Nice hop oils. Quite tasty, probably a tie between the tap version and super fresh bottled version. Ironically, the fresher this is, the more malt I get from it, not sure why.

Agree with everyone else about the head and lacing, Great pine, citrus, sinsemilla nose, wonderful. The taste is balanced with just enough malt sweetness for me, I confess, I'm a hop head. Mouthfeel was spot on too perhaps just a little too slick. Drinkability depends on how far it is to bed, I feel it's more than acceptable to drink this one until fuzzy.

A: Pours a pale yellowish amber color with frothy white head and lots of lacing on the glass  S: Smells like major hops, citrus, grapefruit, some pine...the usual great DIPA scents  T: Tastes just like the smell, but the hops are less prevalent that I expected. I'm not sure if the hops have faded some, but with a bottled on date of 2/16/09 and it only being six weeks later I wouldn't think so...still very good though. some malty balance in there too. I guess I expected a hop bomb, which this isn't.

863,7971,ffejherb,4.8,"On tap at Capone's on 3/29/09. Served in a shaker pint.  A - Clear golden/light orange body with minimal carbonation and one-finger foamy, bubbly head that receded to a thin layer of retention and produced sticky, decorative lacing.  S - Pretty muted nose (compared to the Younger, anyway), though more balanced with a sweet caramel malt presence. However, hops still dominate with a citrusy character and a hint of pine. The citrus notes really opened up as the liquid warmed.  T - Nicely balanced DIPA with plenty of citrus hops and piney accents. Malt is sweet and caramely with some light toasted grainy notes. Grapefruit really stood out as Elder warmed up a bit.  M - Medium bodied with an oily texture and moderate carbonation. Bitter on the palate, but doesn't linger for too long. Nice creaminess and smooth mouthfeel overall.  D - The Elder is certainly wiser and more accessible than its more head-strong counterpart, and boasts a fantastic drinkability that is perhaps unparalleled amongst the pantheon of DIPAs. While the aroma of the Younger was off the charts, I found Elder to be a bit more drinkable overall while still maintaining tons of hop flavor.",Russian River Brewing Company,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,100
863,7971,btuthill,4.58,"Poured from 500ml bottle into new belgium tulip. Bottled on March 9, 2009 - reviewed 20 days later. Huge thanks to my friend Scott for lugging this back from California.  Color is a hazy amber. Large 1.5 finger head is fluffy and stays forever with heavy lacing following the beer down the glass. Smell is intense and very fresh for lack of a better word. Smells like fresh-cut grapefruit and pine needles - absolutely delicious. A little bit of orange zest and peach, too. The taste is incredible. Very little of the pine from the nose, but a lot of the fresh citrus and peach. At no point does this taste like a hop bomb, though. The fruity flavor of the hops is very well tethered by a noticeable malt presence. The flavor lingers forever - if you're planning on drinking something after this, may I suggest some crackers to cleanse your palate. It is smooth without being too cloying, and is properly carbonated. I would love to drink a handful of these, but my better judgment advises against more than a couple.  A fantastic DIPA - perhaps the best I've had. I would love to try this fresh at the brewery, but thanks again to Scott for bringing back this fresh batch of bottles.

First cracked open the bottle, the smell is definitely hoppy. A scent of orange and a slight scent of pine as I pour it into a Pizza Port pint glass. Golden orange appearance with tiny bubbles floating to the top. The taste is hoppy but not overwhelming. Nice aftertaste and very refreshing to my palate. 3/4 of it gone and starting to feel a nice ""feeling"" from it. Mouthfeel is definitely still refreshing and hoppy as I finish drinking the Pliny. Overall, this is a very, very good beer that is definitely a top 5 on my list. The bottle is very tasty and when I can find them, I always take a few home. Starting to really feel ""good"" now. Nice! Tried this on tap at Father's Office 2 in Culver City. Wow! Hard to drink the other beers on tap because Pliny just kick a--! If you find this on tap, definitely try it.

The head has a slight yellow beer tinge to the fluffy lacyness that is the head. Great sexy looking beer.  S- The smell is everything you expect in this beer, piny yet grapefruity.  T- The taste is piny hops that really give a nice kick to the tongue's senses. Pliny is a great beer, one that other DIPAs strive to be. Nice sweetness in hops, yet has a nice tasty bitter hop taste as well. Best of both worlds.  M- Great mouthfeel, still a palate killer, yet if this is all your drinking tonight your good to go.

A - Pours a bright, clean, (but not entirely clear) pale gold, with a few amber highlights. A small 1.5 finger head forms, then dissipates to a thin cap, leaving moderate lacing behind  S - Big hops up front, with a juicy, resiny theme coming through. Piney/grassy up front, and then a very appetizing citrus presence back up the hop profile, also, this doesn't smell as one dimensional as one might expect, with a small bready malt presence making itself known.  T - An incredible burst of hops comes through, but the hop profile in the taste is almost the opposite of the aroma of this beer. Citrusy and juicy up front, with a definite resin finish. A great sweet, malty presence throughout keeps this well balanced, though still deliciously hoppy and bitter.  M&D - Moderate carbonation gives this beer a nice, drinkable smoothness on the palate that complements the hop bitterness very well. I could (and have) put a few of these back before the ABV caught me.",Russian River Brewing Company,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,100
863,7971,Pencible,4.55,"This poured a hazy gold with a bit of off-white head. I'm surprised it wasn't darker or have any more head. It smelled more subdued than expected, like apricot and mango, with some lemon and honey. It tasted very tropical and sweet, but also very cleanly bitter. Main flavors were apricot, mango, and pineapple, supported by some resin (not really pine) and plenty of honey malt for very balanced flavor. A bit of alcohol was noticeable. It was slightly thick with no carbonation, and had a slightly bitter aftertaste. Overall this was a very clean and surprisingly sweet and balanced beer. Fantastic flavors with the different hops and malt playing perfectly together. Only a touch of alcohol taste made this very easy to drink. Could this have been better? Maybe a bit stronger scent and slightly fuller body. But those aren't really complaints, as this was a delight to drink.",Russian River Brewing Company,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,100

Left a very thick lacing down the glass  S--Balanced well between citrus and piney hops, with the citrus getting a slight edge. Very juicy and pretty much exactly how a DIPA should smell.  T--The opposite of the smell...very well balanced between citrus and piney hops with the pine getting the slight edge. Remarkably balanced actually. The hops are powerful yet do not overpower with bitterness. The citrus profile is juicy, and the pine profile isn't so huge as to make you feel like you are chewing on a pine needle.  M--Coated the mouth wonderfully and left a lingering aftertaste of pine  D--Went down very easily, a pint satisfies me plenty.

Apricot and mango are also primary scents. Possibly either guava or papaya in here as well. However, it's that strong resin scent that jumps out most to me.  T: Apricot, mango, and bitter hops on the first sip. Searching for citrus, but finding more like resiny hops or pine on the second. Definitely piney on the aftertaste.  M: More like juice than beer, in the sense that it's a medium body with little carbonation at all. Almost reminds me of a cask beer in that sense.  D: Moderately drinkable at refrigerator temp.

T: Extremely smooth beer. Caramel malts up front, bold hop flavors soon follow. Hops have a mild grassiness to them. Lemon peel is most dominant flavor I get from the citrus flavors.

863,7971,SwiftyMcBeer,4.68,"I approached this review with a little trepidation as the bottles I managed to score where 4 months old. It's my understanding that PtE is a lot like a more familar beer to me, HopSlam, in that it ages quickly and loses that luster. Still, I wanted something special for review 50, so I pushed on regardless. I should not have been all that worried, it lived up to the hype, maybe being stored in a cold beer cave at the store I got it at helped. What a good looking beer, clear, light orange, great head that retains forever. You smell a smorgasboard of hops flavors, citrus up front, but it the piney notes that take the day and linger with you. The first taste is that bitter hop smash we all know and love but then it gets more complicated. It's the second half of the taste where the bitterness mellows and you can really appreciate the underlying flavor that makes this beer so great. The greatest aftertaste I've ever had in a beer . . . these great subtle pine notes just linger on your palate for minutes after your first taste. Has to be the best DIPA I have ever had. I am leaving some room on my score on the off-chance that I get my hands on a fresh bottle because I did think the front bitterness was slightly faded. That being said, it didn't deter my enjoyment one bit. Worth the hype. Thank you to the caring beer man in Denver who thought to keep this joy cold for my enjoyment.",Russian River Brewing Company,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,100
863,7971,IronCitySteve,4.89,"Had on tap while winery hopping in the Russian River Valley. Had at Korbel of all places:  A: Pours a cloudy but rich amber color. Offers a one finger foam head with plenty of sticky goodness on the side of the glass.  S: Lots of hops, pine, citrus and floral hops are the most dominant scents. I have yet to smell a beer this good.  T: Probably the best beer I have ever tasted. I knew of its 'legend' for a long time and it did not disappoint. Love how all the pine, citrus (grapefruit) hops blend together.  M: A well balanced beer that leaves such a great hops taste on your palate (kind of messed with my wine tasting the rest of the day, but I did not care!)  D: Despite the high ABV, I think this could be one of my top 2 beers all-time. Wish I could have shipped the beer to myself while I was out there!",Russian River Brewing Company,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,100
863,7971,twelvsies,4.73,"Ok, yeah it's that good. Had literally countless pints on draught at Falling Rock in Denver as an introduction and then plenty in bottles from various stores. Brought some back and just cracked 'em last night with friends so I am reviewing the bottled version. A sharp looking beer. Super crisp and clear and light orange amber with a head that just don't quit. This beer has all aspects of hoppyness covered. Fruity, yes. Lots of citrus zest, orange, lime, and big plump pineapple juicyness. But the main flavor is pungent pine, bitter all the way through. Totally numbs my entire mouth, makes me all tingly, I like. Lingering long after the swallow too. You could take a sip of this beer and probably still taste it a minute later. I like that this IPA isn't just full of fruity hops like a lot of beers from the west coast, which can be nice, but it has that wrenching bitterness to it that really completes the bold character of the beer. Dry, yet quenching. Somehow crispy on the palate but plenty of body and just a pure pleasure to drink. I hiked a mountain in Colorado with a coupe of these in the back-pack and drank them at the top with me Lady, right outta the bottle too. That was nice.",Russian River Brewing Company,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,100
863,7971,photomike,4.65,"Man, I love this beer.  Pours radiant gold with a beautiful white head. Tiny specks of delicious float throughout this beer that you can see if you look carefully. I eagerly anticipate every aspect of this beer up until the entire thing is in my belly, from the pop of the cap to the lingering aftertaste of the last sip. One of my all time favorites.  Once poured, its like your nose is walking through a forest of hops. In fact, I usually use the word ""forest"" when describing the smell of this thing. Beautiful piney, grapefruity hop aroma fills the room.  While the emphasis in the aroma is pine with grapefruit in the background, the roles reverse when tasted. Lots of citrus and the perfect balance of citrus and malt. Only the slightest hint of alcohol as you get deeper into the beer. So well balanced, this is just beer making at its finest.  Mouthfeel is nice...not so clean that it leaves you as soon as you swallow, there is a velvety smoothness that leaves an oily pine coating in your mouth, so you keep on tasting this one. Love it.  Dangerously drinkable given the ABV.  Wow.",Russian River Brewing Company,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,100
863,7971,Keith238,4.6,"serving: 500ml bottle, received from a trade, thanks Jesse.  I first had this brew at Monk's in Philly, on draught and I fell in love. The only thing that kept me from drinking them out of their supply was the Mrs.  I'm not really sure why I'm reviewing this one because if you haven't had this beer yet, I doubt my review will convince you to try it. Anyway, here it goes:  Golden colored ale with pure white head. Head dissipates into lacing that clings to the glass with each sip. The smell and taste have strong notes of grapefruit, pineapple and pine. Crisp and clean with no aftertaste. Easily the most drinkable IIPA I've ever had and at 8%, I could have a couple of liters. Looking forward to trying the Younger!",Russian River Brewing Company,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,100
863,7971,Klgkenny,4.42,"Thanks to jason for this great california beer.  Poured from a chilled bottle into a room temp pint glass. Presents as a honey colored amber. A vary faint head rest atop the body. Very strong pine and flowery hop smells with the slightest hint of citrus and other fruits waft up to the nose. The taste is overpowered (in a good way for all the hopheads) by a piney/flowery hop taste. There has to be a malty backbone to supplement this hop_beast, but it is unapparent in the mouth. A medium mouthfeel, even for an IPA. Better than average, but still, I would like something a bit chewier. Overall, I could drink these all night long. Thank you russian river!",Russian River Brewing Company,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,100
863,7971,NickMunford,4.15,"A - Pours a nice amber color, with a light frothy head, about a finger thick. Good retention, and I wouldn't say it looks like ""lacing"", but it does stick to the side of the glass.  S - Citrus, hops, slight piny aroma. Smells near perfect for an IPA to me. Not overpowering, but it definitely tells you it's an IPA.  T - The taste matches exactly what you get from the smell. Citrus, nicely bitter hops, not overpowering. Great for an IPA.  M - I'm finding myself rather indifferent towards the mouthfeel.  D - It's very drinkable. It's hopped perfectly. Enough to let you know it's there, but not so much that it gives you that unpleasant bitter pinch in the back of your jaw that a lot of hop bombs do. I'd be happy to have a case of this in my cooler!",Russian River Brewing Company,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,100
863,7971,scifan,4.25,"Big thanks to sirpsycho for this. I just got this today in a trade. I'm so excited to finally try this beer. This was bottled on 7/30/08 so I'm sure that some of the hop presence has faded some so I'll try to take that into consideration. Looks really good going into my pint glass. It's slightly hazy, orangey honey color. Has a nice head with good retention and lots of lacing on the glass. Still smells really good. Lots of piney hops, also a slight citrus aroma as well. Also getting a malty backbone, its not balanced but that's what we're looking for right. Taste is very similar to smell. Nice piney bite at first, then some slightly sweeter citrusy hops, followed by the malty goodness, then a burst of bitterness to wash it all down. I wish I could try this a little more fresh to fully experience all that is Pliny. Feels a little thin in the mouth wish there was just a little more there, but the carbonation is nice. I'm not getting a hint of the 8% alcohol this baby is certainly smooth. Awesome brew.",Russian River Brewing Company,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,100

863,7971,roopy40,4.75,"A - Gold in color. Fine, white, foamy head. Dimples of air open in the head like you see in a pancake that is being cooked. Head leaves way to gorgeous lace left on the glass. Head retention is ridiculous. As you look at the glass and agitate, you can see minuscule specks that float like sand would through the middle of a wave in the ocean.  S - Grapefruit, zest of citrus, pine smell like you've carried in your Christmas tree.  T - Great follow up to the smell. Grapefruit, citrus zest, pine, touch of sweet tropical fruit as well. As I slowly sipped this wonderful nectar, I agitated, looked, tasted and just got more and more depressed that it was running out. I think myself and my two cronies took a good 45 mins to an hour to savor it. It was a first taste for all of us and we loved it and extended it as long as we could.  M - Great carbonation, thick, slick feel. Tingles on the buds on the way down and slaps your palate with a nice sting of hops.  D - I only wish I had more to drink that night or any night for that matter. The 8% is totally disguised. This DIPA is one of a kind.",Russian River Brewing Company,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,100
863,7971,paulxqx,4.77,"I have been looking forward to finally writing my review of Pliny the Elder for some time. It is one of my favorite beers... I think it would be safe to say that if I was ""stranded on a desert island and could only have one beer with me for the rest of my days..."" it would probably be the Elder. Now on to the review...  Although I have had it on tap, this review is for the bottled Elder.  Bottled January 23, 2009. Drinking one today, March 18th, 2009. I bought a case of Pliny the Elder for $100 at Hollingshead's Delicatessen in Orange, CA.  A: When poured into a pint glass the carbonation bubbles are visible in the dense orangish/amber hue of this beer. It looks like unfiltered orange flavored honey! The bubbles take their time getting to the top, it is really beautiful. One finger head which is close to white; like fine sand. As you drink lacing is noticeable.  S: Pliney and resiny, I mean PINEY and resiny, like spring time. Pine with citrus, mainly pineapple, grapefruit, hint of orange. Sweet.  T: It tastes just like it smells only better. A lot of fresh piney hops that are very well balanced with citrus, pineapple, grapefruit, and a hint of orange.  M: The beer sits well in your mouth and swallows great. The flavors are well balanced and dense which give it somewhat of a heavier feel but completely refreshing. Fine carbonation like cool beach sand.  D: Refer back to that desert island thingy : P  Overall, this is one of the finest beers I have ever tasted. And to put it simply, when I drink Pliny the Elder, I am happy and content like the end of a classic fairy tale. I hope everyone has an opportunity to try one!",Russian River Brewing Company,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,100

I finally got a chance to try it again during Philly beer week at Local 44.  The beer was a nice hazy yellow color and had 2 fingers worth of fluffy white head sitting on top of it. The aroma was great. It smelled of pine and floral hops. The taste was as good as the smell. Amazing hop flavors. A little spicy bite. Some citrus flavor. Great bitter finish that was just right. Not to overpowering. Wow, is this beer smooth. It has just the right amount of carbonation and goes down great.  The booze was not playing any tricks on me the first time i tasted this beer.

Deep oranges; sweet like orange marmalade, grapefruit, and honey. The most refreshing and clean hop aroma that I've ever smelled. I really don't get anything from the malt.  T. Caramel and honey malt sweetness blended with earthy-tasting hops. Very resiny and sticky-sneakily bitter-touch of booze in the back of the throat and a dry finish. About as complex of a DIPA I've ever had.  M. Thick, oily, and sticky in the mouth. Carbonation is right on track for the style.  D. A refreshing drink with uber complexity.

S: Smelled sweet, hoppy, fruity, and of citrus.  T: Tasted really great, of hops (naturally), honey, sour fruit, and ginger.  M: A large amount of carbonation, easy on the tongue though.  D: Overall I preferred this over PTY just a personal preference as the really really strong hops taste isn't really my thing but if I ignored this and just thought of it neutrally, it was still a great beer although I can see why other would prefer PTY and think it is ambrosia from the beer gods.",Russian River Brewing Company,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,100

T: i was surprised how light and delicate the taste was. there is a front note of floral hops with an almost herbal character, nothing too bitter, the bitterness comes in but is finished with a dry and very clean finish, its almost like you get a backwash of malt to clean out the taste. i was surprised how little this beer attacked my senses, but was pleased by its balance  M/D this beer is almost sessionable at 8% the lightness makes it extremely smooth and easy to consume. you have to sit back and sip it to really appreciate its character because of this  very good solid beer",Russian River Brewing Company,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,100

So, Pliny the Elder on tap. What a dream for a Midwesterner. Served in a pint glass. Hazy deep copper, perfect off-white foamy head that lasts forever. Heavily carbonated.

863,7971,tdawgydog,4.67,"Finished of my Cali trip with a sweet bottle of Pliny the Elder. I've had enough hops this past week to last me quite a while.  IPA's are not one of my favorite styles but I've grown a new appreciation for them. Pliny The Elder is without a doubt the best IPA that I have ever had.  The bottle I had was dated Feb. 26, 2009. I heeded the warnings on the bottle and enjoyed it immediately. It pours a nice golden yellow into my Stone IPA pint glass (boy this glass earned it's keep the last week) there was a 2 finger head which quickly dissipated to leave a nice lace on the glass.  The scent was sweet, not as hoppy as most of the other IPA's that I have had. The pine in this brew really stood out to me.  The taste is sweet, very citrusy. You can taste the pine and then the whole thing is followed up by some of the best hop flavor to ever be put in a beer.  I was enjoying my .5 litre bottle just before going to bed. It went down very smooth after a long day of doing nothing...  The beer has much more body than it's appearance would lead you to believe. Again overall it was very well done. If IPA's were my thing, this would be at the top of my list. I could still drink a few of these as it is.

Nice white head with blankets of matured lacing (don't ask me what that means).  - Smell is bountiful with citrus, floral.. and fresh hops.. with strong pungent rye notes and hop. Many might not like the pungent aspect of this, but i do. My favorite IPA's have that quality.  - Taste is so smooth. Cantaloupe, pine, floral, citrus... bursting w/ hop madness. (Song comes to mind ""Can we play w/ 'hop' madness""). No alcohol strength whatsoever.. very smooth.  - Leaves the mouth watery, not dry.. no pucker, no squint. Just a satisfied pallet.

863,7971,PDXHops,4.17,"Got a chance to visit the brewery and enjoy this beer on tap. It proved to be quite different than my previously reviewed experience with the bottled version. Below I've made some notes about the bottled version in parentheses for comparison.  Looks good, but not great. Served in a nonic, there's only a half finger of white head on top of the bright gold/tangerine body. Head retention and lacing are OK, but the lacing is not plentiful. (Bottled version I gave a 4.5, as I had a huge puffy head which lasted til the end and laced from the top to the bottom of my tulip glass).  Smells of abundant juicy, pungent hops, but not as strong as expected. The nonic is no way to showcase this beer. (Bottled version I gave a 4.5. A tulip or snifter really shows off the massive hop aroma).  Tastes incredible. The hops are chewy, sticky and pungent. The very definition of ""hop bomb"". Massive pine and grapefruit, with pleasant hints of sweetness and toast. It's not balanced, but it's damned tasty. (Bottled version I also gave a 4.5. The tap version I think is slightly sweeter, but both are great).  Mouthfeel is pretty good. Moderate carbonation makes for a ""tamer"" version of the beer, really smooths things out, allowing a touch of sweetness to join the bitterness in the finish. (Bottled version I gave a 4.5. It was aggressive, crackly, sticky, resiny, and the bitterness felt like it lingered halfway down my throat.)  Drinkability is good, and the 8% ABV is well hidden. (Bottled version I gave a 4.5. I found it slightly more interesting and enjoyable.)  Overall impression: A great beer, but I prefer the bottled version, at least if the tap version is served in a crappy glass. Russian River should really showcase this wonderful elixir in some proper glassware.",Russian River Brewing Company,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,100

S - up-front and clear, very noticeable hoppy citrus vibe. Very inviting!  T/M/D - slight carbonation, and hops everywhere on my first sip, citrusy bitter like a grapefruit, not quite as sweet as I was expecting from the smell. The hop bite is up front and the flavor stuck to my mouth for quite a while. I drank this one slowly, and it came together more after a few minutes and it warmed up a bit. Then the bite settles back a bit and I found a little maltiness in there too. Very enjoyable!",Russian River Brewing Company,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,100
863,7971,NCSUdo,4.73,"16.9 oz bottle  A: Very clear copper body under about a half to 3/4 inch white head. Good retention and lace.  S: Very hoppy, but with an identifiable caramel malt backbone. Hop is a mix of earthy, piney and citrus hops. I expected much more citrus, but am very surprised at the balance. Maybe a little underwhelming, but the balance helps make up for it.  T: This where the beer starts to earn its keep. Everything is perfectly, and I mean perfectly, balanced. Malt backbone is there, followed by a nice citrus hop twang, with a finish of mild pine and mostly grapefruit, rind-like citrus. The bitter finish perfectly done it that it hits you but doesn't squeeze any of the other tastes out. Some spice mixed in as well, and I even pick up some mint type character here and there.

Bottle was from 11/04/08 has is lost its edge already? I don't know but I would say the SN Torpedo I had earlier in the day was far better than this...cheaper too.

863,7971,ColForbinBC,4.7,"On-tap at The South Philly Tap Room  Appears a slightly hazy golden orange with a fluffy, yellow infused cap that faded shortly after the first sip. Very light lace with no discernible patten and some pretty active bubbles for the style.  The hop aroma covers all angles here....pine and spruce, grapefruit and orange rind, mangoes and apricots, and fresh cut grass. Overall though, the floral, fruity side seems to be more dominant. Assertive without being bold, but pleasing and inviting.  The flavor has a prickly hop bite to it with every sip. Floral and citrus rise to the occasion with a sweet, bready malt background. I'd be remiss not to mention the strong fresh cut grass and mint flavor in the slightly bitter aftertaste. Very unique to Pliny. This is surprisingly balanced. It's a hop bomb, but not in the ""bitter, knock you over the head"" type of hop bomb.  Smooth with pretty active carbonation. Not a big, chewy dipa by any means. More resinous and oily. Finishes slightly bitter and dry.  The 8% is almost non-existent. It wasn't until the very end that I got even a hint of booze.

T- Soft citrus fruit and sweet caramel initially then some great pine flavors come through. More fruity orange flavors come through the pine with hints of caramel and vanilla, then another burst of dry pine bitterness. The beer finishes sweet and juicy with some lingering dry pine bitterness.  M- Medium bodied with a great refreshing juiciness to it. Hops cut through with some nice dry bitterness and balances things out.  Overall I would say this is one of the more balanced and well made DIPA's.

863,7971,josiahschlender,4.92,"I was very excited when the Belmont Station got ahold of some Russian River Bottles. Double IPAs are my favorite style, so getting my hands on what many consider one of the best has been on my mind for a while.  Poured into a wiine glass, very pretty looks. Fairly light for the style, polished golden, very clear until some yeast sediment poured out at the end. Big white head lasts fairly well, leaves an average amount of lace. I also notice that the beer kind of coats the glass in a ""thick"" way that many beers don't.  Amazing hop aromas immediately upon opening the bottle, which only expand with the pour. Wow, lots of grapefruit, floral nectar and pine resin. Complex and intense, both huge pluses in my book. How does this beer do it? The hop aromas and flavors seem out of proportion and almost impossible.  Flavors are also complex and intense, in a hoppy way. Many DIPAs have more malt balance, but I'm just fine with the hops being nearly completely dominant. With a little warmth, I note some sweet, bready malts for an instant before getting drowned out by the hoppy bitterness at the end. Not an unpleasant bitterness, but enough to remind you that this is not an ordinary beer, nor even an ordinary DIPA.  Feel is hard to pin down with my taste buds spinning. It has a medium body that well matches the style without detracting from anything. In the same way the liquid coats the glass when you swirl it, it also coats my mouth and keeps the flavors lasting and swirling. I love a long and complex finish like that.  Definitely a world class beer that lived up to the hype for me. Now I want to try the Younger. To top it off, it wasn't even that expensive! I'll definitely be getting this beer again. The only two detractors from drinkability for me are that it doesn't pair well with many foods, and that it's really hard to find here in Portland.",Russian River Brewing Company,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,100

I expected a lot from this beer and it didn't let me down. Very clean bitterness upfront, followed by citrusy notes, some sweetness is there too (perhaps some beries), but in very tiny amount.

863,7971,Source,4.7,"This is a post cold update. One of the two best hop fixes one can get, IMHO.  Appearance: Amber with a 2mm head that dissipated quickly to a nice lacing on the pint glass. Hazy - very grapefuit juice like.  Smell: Intense hopitude. I detected grapefruit citrus, pine, and some floral notes.  Taste: Here's where the beverage really shined. Superb hoppiness from the first sip to the last. Strong grapefruit and pine with more complexity than I expected. Similar in taste profile to Bell's HopSlam. In fact I'd like to do a side by side of the two... but I digress. Bitter, but not too bitter finish. Even at 8%, I found the alcohol very hard to detect - which is very dangerous for me. ;)  Mouth: Light with just the right amount of carbonation.  Drinkability: It goes down extemely well.

863,7971,JoBoTo,4.89,"Acquired from Dakotah13 on a Hopslam trade  L- Poured a somewhat dull brownish amber. Dull was due to the way that the clarity was unexpected. In the bottle it seems clearer than it does in a glass. Not clear, but not opaque. Just a rich honey brown, that smells wonderful. Well pleased with my pour on this one. 16.9 oz bottle, and used the entire 22 oz Duvel Chalice to contain it all, head covering the last two fingers of glass room.  S- Was smelling this right out of the bottle. I can honestly say that I have never smelled hops like this before might be a variety I haven't had the pleasure of shaking hands with, but am well pleased that we have now met, seems very piney, like a stroll through the forest in mid summer. Somewhat sweet but not prominently. After sitting for about 2 minutes, the citrus comes out. Grapefruit, and pineapples come forth. Really trying not to let hype intrude here, but it is one of the most pleasant smelling beers I've had. Incredible amount of grapefruit on retro-olfaction  M- Medium thickness, filling mouth, but not chewing on it. Tongue tingle is slight to none. There is no alcohol taste, slight burn when it approaches your heart area of chest .Becomes frothy when played with.  Taste oooh, the taste. Hops is throughout, clearly, and obviously, but there is always this sweet overtone, almost lost unless you let tongue tip play in the beer bath too. Leaves a piney flavor coated over your tongue. Reminds me of the wax coat that some scotches leave, but with hops. Really need to figure out what type of Hops this is. Really smooth transition down the throat, no hop-bite, no real bitterness, just seems very smooth hop delivery.  Room mate asked to try, having only started being exposed to craft beers, I was somewhat dubious as to whether he would like it or not. He's tried a couple of my IPAs, DIPAs, and such, but doesn't seem to have acquired that hop taste yet. He wouldn't stop talking about this. He loved it, and tried to steal the rest of the glass.  D- I am somewhat saddened by the fact that I only have 2 bottles of this. There will be many many more trades trying to acquire this from across the country. I fully understand why this is one of the elite beers. There have been recent talk about freshness and this one was bottle on 2/16/09, then shipped across to Jax, so makes me wonder how good this is on tap. I was expecting something more in my face, given its popularity. Its like meeting Elisha Cuthbert, and she farts then picks her nose before shaking your hand. You're still amazed by the whole experience, but the simple labeling, and the lack of beer angels flowing from the bottle, no fanfare in the background, and every BA friend of yours, isn't ringing your phone off the hook to see how it really was. Guess I've put the top 10 or so on a pedestal. A marvelous beer, well worth trying, and loving. Easily worth the trade. Thanks Dakotah13 you've made my day.",Russian River Brewing Company,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,100

Head retained almost the whole time I was drinking it and it left decent spots of lacing. Just a great looking beer in a glass.  S: Citrus and pine, and just the least bit flowery but not too much. I would use this beer as an air freshener if I could!  T: Excellent and worth all the talk! The aroma really comes through in the taste and the finish leaves just enough bitterness from the hops. Just the right temperature left no hint of alcohol taste.  M: Perfectly balanced with the carbonation and the aftertaste wasn't too strong. A very comfortable beer.  D: This is a great beer!

863,7971,brewdoc75,4.72,"I've dreamed of getting my hands on this beer for so long, now I finally have it. My buddy Mike made a trip to San Diego and brought back 5 bottles of Pliny. When he went to the liquor store he brought up 2, one for me and one for him. The guy at the counter said ""have you had this before."" Mike replied ""no, is it good?"" The gentleman countered, ""Dude, this is the best f#$%ing thing you will ever have."" On that note, here is my review for the Pliny the Elder.  Bottled on 2/3/09, pretty fresh I guess.  A: Transluscent yellow-orange. Crisp white head as I pour it into my Duvel tulip. Perfect carbonation.  S: ""Oh my god"" I said as I took a whiff. Hops, hops, and more hops. Tangerine, pine, and grapefruit predominate. Very floral and very prominent hop aroma. But wait, there are malts too. A slight sweetness and biscut aroma underlies the hop onslaught. This beer smells so good, if it were a cologne, I would wear it every day.  T: Excellent hoppy bite. More of that citrusy tangerine and grapefruit flavor followed by a piney bite. Not so bitter it would rip your chest hair off, but very well balanced. The malts are solid as well with a nice sweetness. I am longing for just a hint more malts. It may just be my personal taste, but I like my DIPAs a little more maltier.  M: Very crisp, very clean. Thin to medium bodied which makes this dangerously drinkable.  D: A definite ""5"" based on the aroma and the flavor. I can't think of many other beers I could drink more of. It isn't terribly alcoholic for a DIPA either. This definitely adds to the drinkability. Overall, this beer was the epic beer that everyone raved about. If I ever find it in a store again, I will buy as much as I can. Those of you who can get this locally are some of the luckiest bastards around.",Russian River Brewing Company,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,100
863,7971,StarlightSeraph,3.88,"500 ml bottle, bottled 8/25/08. Thanks to deliriumfest for this one. Poured into my Chimay goblet.  Appearance: Pours hazy and golden-orange, with a finger and a half of frothy white head. Left blankets of lacing.  Smell: I could smell hops and citrus floating into the air as I poured the glass. Piney and grassy notes out of the glass, with a honey sweetness in the background. Mild citrus notes in the background.  Taste: Intense hops, grassy and piney...and, well, not much else. Maybe a slight citrus tang in the background, but its the pine notes that dominate. Long, lingering bitter aftertaste. Couldn't really taste the alcohol, but there was definitely a warming sensation going down. As the beer warms, a lemony-citrus flavor becomes more noticeable.  Mouthfeel: Nice and thick, and good carbonation.  Drinkability: This well definitely satisfy anyone's hop craving. It would be dangerously easy to put down a few of these.  I have to say, Pliny the Elder was a bit more one dimensional than I was expecting. There wasn't much in the background, and I couldn't help but feeling slightly underwhelmed. Was it a very good beer? Absolutely. Would I have another one given the chance? Absolutely. Would I go out of the way to get one? Well...probably not. Still, a beer I am very glad I got the chance to try, and enjoy.",Russian River Brewing Company,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,100

Yeah, you know, just throw in a pliny for an extra. I wish I lived in Cali sometimes... Regardless, this is one awesome beer, I've had the privilege of trying once before, and now I got a whole bottle to myself, and it's my birthday, this rating might be inflated...heh Pours out a cloudy golden orange with a nice white cavernous head that laces sporadically. Nose is huge hops, pine, citrus, flowers. Hits the nose with this bombardment and leaves you begging for more. Taste is likewise starts almost floral with a hint of lemons and grapefruit leaves with a pine everywhere. Coating the mouth and lingering for quite sometime. Nice biscuity malt background somewhat makes this beer not too overwhelming and still drinkable even for the amount of hops that hit you. Overall a solid beer, I think I prefer the Blind Pig to this one, but that's kinda my taste and not knocking PTE. Overall a really nice beer glad I got to review it finally.

863,7971,DaveFL1976,4.5,"Thanks to raoulduke37 in Ventura, California for this brew. This is my first Russian River brew. For us East-Coasters, Russian River and the Plinys are a mystical thing. They'll probably never be distributed over here so we have to rely on you folks in the Pacific Time Zone to get them to us, bottle by bottle.  My Pliny, bottled on Jan 23 '09 and drank on March 4 '09 poured a hazy golden/orange color with a thick, luscious head. Not a huge head; just tiny bubbles. You know what I mean. The smell is both citrus and pine and really not a whole lot of malt. It's sort of like stuffing your nose in a pine tree.  Mouthfeel is a bit on the thick side thanks to the big amount of malt in there, but the nicely-balanced flavors have you coming back for more. Drinkability is good, but can be bested by some other 8% beers. But perhaps by not many 8% IPAs.",Russian River Brewing Company,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,100

A- Not hazey not clear, thick or light, A nice color of meduim. Finger of head, nice lacing.  S- Sweet with citrus fruit. With a hop like bouquet of buds.  T- An amzing journey on your palate. You have a enjoyable welcome of malty citrus, backed up by a creeping of pine, like your first trip to the woods, then a variety of hops to tingle the buds that is Bitterness. The perfect blend goes down so smooth you don't relize its a Double and your about to cath a buzz.  M- great carbination, but so smooth you don't realize its there, it what its suppossed to feel like.

Pours crystal clear and golden, fitting for such a famous beer. Creamy, two-finger, white head with great retention and lacing. Smell is great. A nice blend of hops. Some citrus/grapefruit but not overpowering, like some other west coast IPA's. A strong floral presence as well, some sweet malt too. Taste is boderline perfect. At first the hops seem somewhat mellow and controlled, but it hits you with a strong, bitter aftertaste that you dont want to go away. Detected both some piney and citrus hops and well as a distinct, but not overpowering, sweetness as it warms. Mouthfeel was medium, but still somewhat light. Very smooth and silky. Overall this is a great, well balanced beer. I guess I never noticed, until I did this review, that it is a Double IPA. The mastery of the balance is amazing and it does not come off as a Double and the ABV is undetectable.

863,7971,imagineiii,4.82,"Thanks to Gilgarp for the chance to try this BA legend. Bottled on 1-23-09. Poured into my trusty DFH snifter. I dont ever remember cracking a beer and it immediately filling the room with the aroma of hops before.  Slightly hazy amber hued beer. Appears to be rather viscous in the way it suspends the slight bit of sediment, rather suprising for such a new beer. Head retention is decent to above average. lace is a major plus.  my living room smells of pine sap, and tropical fruits like pineapple and mango. a little citrus is hidden. maybe a little bit of mint. nicely done so far, just slightly different than most.  And then it hits my tongue...its creamy, full bodied and smooth. texture reminds me of another DIPA ive had lately but cant wait to review: hopslam. flavors dance on the palate, leaving no undesired taste behind. Desite warming effect in the stomach, the minty and citrusy hops seem to cool the palate. The balance of this beer is unlike any other with 8% alc and this much of a hop character to it. Wheres the alcohol?  Carbonation is very subdued which i think might be the key to this beer. without overly assertive carbonation to upset the palate, the beers true colors can shine thru. alcohol and hops combine to only injure the palate a slight amount. this beer is a party in my mouth.  its amazingly addictive, you want to follow every sip with another sip just to see if its REALLY that good. well guess what, its pretty much THAT good, so stop sipping it so fast. does it leave me wanting a second one? not exactly. a second one just wouldnt taste as good... i mean it cant. right?  i refused to review this beer based solely on the hype. but then this beer got inside of me. it went straight from my stomach to my head and started running circles around my brain. black was day, white was night, and pliny was still f*ckin awesome.",Russian River Brewing Company,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,100
863,7971,discovolante65,5,"Finally got my hands on some of this. After trying to trade, trying to get ""friends"" in CA to buy some and ship it, fellow BA bought some online and brought it over for beer night. Thanks Roop40!  I tried not to believe all the hype. I tried to think of all the DIPA's I have had and how great they all were. I tried to remember all the great East Coast brewers and their DIPA efforts. I tried to remain East Coast bias. In short, I was ready to pick this fucker apart. Even though part of me wanted to love it.  Poured into my Troubadour tulip. Pours the finest Golden Orange color I have seen. Nice one inch off white/ golden head. excellent lacing. Some ""stuff"" whirling around like a small tornado when agitated.  Smell is typical of DIPAS. Grapefruit, pine forest, with a little honey note in there as well. It has a ""bigger, fresher"" aroma than I am used to. I could have huffed this thing all night.  What an incredible balance of flavors. Sure, others have these great tastes in them, maybe some even have more hop presence, maybe a little more bitter, maybe some more malt, but NONE are as balanced as this is. Perfect blends of hops and malt. I am blown away by this one.  Mouthfeel is right where it should be. Just the right amount of carbonation, the bite washes away nicely and finishes dry.  Drinkability- Perfect DIPA? IMO- ABSOLUTELY! Everything about this beer is just right. The look, the smell, the taste, the feel, perfect. If I had more than one I would've drank it. If I had five, I would have sipped them one by one until the sun came up.

863,7971,herbalist,4.42,"After hearing so much about this beer from this site I was really excited to see it on the shelf of the local specialty beer store. I grabbed a 500 mL bottle and poured it into a glass. It pours a deep golden color with a very slightly orange hue. It has a white foamy head a lil more than a finger thick and although most of it disapates rather quickly some of it remained to the very end.  It smells richly of hops, alcohol and citrus. A very distinct grapefruit smell is dominant and you get the sense it is very alcoholic. At 8% ABV it is not excessively alcoholic but from the smell alone you get the sense that it could be.  It tastes very much like it smells with citrus being the dominant flavor and it has a nice hoppie bite. It is def. bitter but not in a way that is overwhelming and if you are a fan of hoppie beers then you are going to love this. I honestly think the citrus-fruity overtones the beer has stands out more than the bitterness.  It has a decent amount of carbonation and is not very heavy at all. One could easily drink a couple of these and enjoy each one. It is def. a top notch beer with high drinkability and excellent flavor.",Russian River Brewing Company,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,100

This pours out looking like glowing golden honey with a thick white head and terrific lacing in my Duvel tulip..  Pungent citrusy hop aromas assault me as I smell this one... Grapefruit, orange. Pineapple, and a hint of pine in there have this one smelling terrific... Already much better than the first bottle... Much better..  Oh yeah, world of difference in the two.. There's nothing subdued about this brew.. Its an all out hop assault with its juicy, tangy, citrusy goodness..there's a hint of pine present but this one is West Coast citrus all the way here...and its delicious...this things leaves my mouth feeling numb from all that citrusy goodness..finishes nice and bitter and has me reaching for the next sip..

Aroma was of the usual (for a DIPA) citrus and pine, along with a honey like sweetness.  Taste was very much the standard grapefruity hops but had some nice sweet malt to counterplay against the bitterness. I really liked the fact it didn't taste like a one dimensional hop bomb as so many others these days do. Alcohol was well hidden.  Mouthfeel was thick and smooth, but I'd have preferred a bit more carbonation.  This is a better than avergae DIPA, but one of the best beers in the world?

I knew I was going to get to try some beers I can't get back in Michigan while I was out here, however I did not expect Pliny to be one of them.  A- Pliny the Elder pours a hazy golden orange, with a small amount of white head. It is very bubbly after it settles in the glass and a good amount of white sediment is slowly settling to the bottom. S- I think the huge aroma is the highlight of the beer. Piney and citrusy hops are the most noticeable, with some honey like sweetness as well. T- Very nice balance between intense hops, and malt backbone with the sweet honey from the aroma as well. If anything maybe a bit of a let down after the aroma. It's great, don't get me wrong but the combination of the hype surrounding Pliny and the aroma had me expecting more. M- Lots of carbonation, medium bodied.

He came back on Xmas day and there was a bottle of PTE under the tree for me.  Pours a nice pale straw color with a fairly white head. Not nearly as amber as typical IPA's I'm used to, much lighter.  Smell is overwhelming with hops. Lots of pine and citrus and the usual American IPA hops.  The taste blew me away. This beer was much hyped so I was really expecting it not to live up to it...but it did. I think my journey for the perfect hob bomb of a beer ended with PTE. Tons of hop flavor and bitterness to match. Just a little malt in the background to balance it out but very dry besides that.  The body it also perfectly balanced for the style, medium. So many IPA's I try (especially this strong) have a heavy body, which isn't always bad, but this is just so much better. Dry and crisp with hop oils and not malty chewy.  Also extremely drinkable.

A faint nose of citrus and pine. First taste is of pine and spice but it's backbone is citrus and some floral aspects. There is just enough sweetness & breadiness to balance the hops. I was afraid any review of this beer would be based on the reviews past, I tried to review only on it's own merits. This is an extremely good DIPA, with more balance than is usually seen in this type. It hewed to a leaner style than I generally prefer, but pulls it off quite well.

Bottled on 1-23-09.Thanks to an amazing trader (bring) for the bottle. 500ml bottle poured into a huge Riedel wine glass and a Sam Adams Boston lager glass--for full analysis.  A: Pours a beautiful, hazy orange with miniscule cream colored particles suspended while tiny bubbles of carbonation drift upward and past. The head is white and reminds me of pancake batter just as it begins to warm on the stove with a myriad of bubble sizes that vary, then as the head recedes become smaller and similar in size.  S: Ripe, ripe honey doused citrus fruit basket comprised of ruby-red grapefruit and rind, apricot, key lime, tangerine cream dessert, freshly cut pine and grass. A resinous, luscious hop driven nose with vanilla malt accentuating. Nearly flawless. Nearly.  M: Extremely soft, velvety, silky, what have you. Medium carbonation. Everything is in balance.  T: Starts off sweet, then the citrus arrives with a bang; lime and grapefruit translating extremely well regarding sweetness before the bitterness of the hops take center stage and remain there through the finish, which is seemingly endless. The malt makes a return after, oh, I don't know 20 or so seconds.  D: For an 8% beer, you'd never know. You pour the beer, and trust me, a few minutes later it's gone.

The flavor is a beautiful bittersweet grapefruit malt blend. I occasionally think of piney hops here too. One of the better IPA's I've had! Very dangerously drinkable. There is an earthy potatoe-like underlining. A perfect feel for the style, smooth and just a hair resinous. Very, very nice.  Update in July 2009 - A cloudy apple juice color with a decent bubbly white head and nice streaky lace. The aroma is very pleasant but decidedly pissy citrus hop, a little floral hint and some grainy malt. The flavor is deliciously blended citrus hops and almost herbal toffee, smooth, mid-bodied or better with a malty sweetness playing through the bitter beauty of this classic hoppy brew. There's bready lemon and a bit of a dry finish, yet it's quite refreshing served cold. It deserves it's reputation and is highly sessionable for anyone that enjoys their hops.

All in all nothing out of the ordinary, but very nice nonetheless  S: this is where it gets great. A truckload of sweet and floral smells. Hops are bursting with smells of oranges, white grapefruit, pineapples, and fresh grasses. A boutique of greens! I think no further explanation is required  T: lets start by mentioning the soft biscuity malts and delicate yeast notes within, hidden in some regards, and yet play an integral part in balancing this hop driven brew. Otherwise, it is as close to hop heaven as you'll get. I find the hops flavors raw, spicy, and bitter all while being refined. What is really enjoyable is this delicate tropical fruit palate that I am conjuring up. Tastes are as smelled with a few additions: oranges, fresh pine, lemons, grapefruits, and a squeeze of passion fruits. A major coating for the tongue of high alpha hops. Loaded with hops and balanced with accuracy  M: a solid medium standing and does a great job of holding a light sticky character and is not very syrupy as some intensely hopped brews can be.

It is amazing that a high alcohol brew with a lot of IBUs can be blended in such an accessible way.",Russian River Brewing Company,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,100
863,7971,washburnkid,4.85,"500mL bottle poured into a stemless large red wine glass  A: Very hazy and thick dark orange and copper hues; white frothy head dissipates to a clustering of bubbles and a ring on the edges. Nice lacing on the glass. S: Heavy citrus and floral hop esters with some alcohol pulling through as the beer warms slightly. T: Exactly what the aroma promises. Citrus, floral flavors. My palate was attacked by a hoppy punch of dry herbs/flowery hops about 3 seconds after I swallowed. Some notes of sweet earthiness. M: Medium bodied; mellow carbonation; slides down smoothly leaving tons of perfume-like residue. D: This beer is smooth, flavorful and powerfully characteristic.

863,7971,squaremile,4.08,"Memorable Quality: The time I had on tap super fresh it was one of the best beers I have ever had. Super dry finish, mouthwatering boquet of hops in the nose, perfectly creamy mouthfeel. I never wanted to stop drinking it, the bottles are a half step below this.  EDIT: I'm downgrading my review. Something is going on with Elder. The hops seem thinner, I'm getting more caramel as it warms than before, and overall it just seems to have changed for the worse. After having this side by side with Younger recently, the flaws of Elder were easier to detect.",Russian River Brewing Company,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,100

Tastes fruity and floral, with a bunch of grapefruit and lemon. Hops follow through with a vengance in aftertaste, which balances out the malty start well. Fantastic mouthfeel: great body and perfect carbonation. Light and refreshing. Tastes fantastic and relatively gentle on the palate, which makes this beer exceedingly drinkable.

863,7971,mithrascruor,4.62,"500 mL bottle poured into a mug. (Bottled 05 Jan 2009.)  Appearance: Pours a lovely copper hue, clear but with some particles floating at equilibrium within. Thin white head with some big bubbles sits on top and leaves some good lacing.  Smell: Fresh spicy hops! Grapefruit and some light florals.  Taste: Similar to the aroma, it tastes of grapefruit and has some mild floral hints. Spicy, especially at the finish and a bit into the aftertaste. There is something ""mature"" to the flavor: it doesn't come across as being in-your-face with the hops like many Double IPAs seems to do.  Mouthfeel: Medium-bodied with light carbonation. Smooth too.  Drinkability: Strong? Yeah. But damn, it tastes so good.  Seems so much better than what I remember when I had it on tap a year ago.

Smell- Like plunging your nose into a fresh bag of hops with hops fairly stinging the nose.  Taste- Explosive hit of citrus and resinous pine hopiness. Not well balanced, but with all the hop presence it couldn't hope to be. There's just enough malt lurking in there to be of note. Grapefruit peel finish that I think I'll still taste at breakfast tomorrow.  Mouthfeel- Moderately carbonated, bitterness to the point of mouthwatering. Sticks to the palate.  Drinkability- Hops so commanding that I could detect virtually no alcohol. Beware the eight percent ABV. Hopheads, this will be one of your all time favorites. Save these for session ends as you will not be able to go backwards to lighter bodied or less hoppy beers after this.",Russian River Brewing Company,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,100

863,7971,ThirdLap,4.92,"This is one review that is long overdue. The Elder was among my first memorable IIPAs, and the one I've returned to most frequently. This review will be from a bottled example, as I imagine that is how many BAs will get to experience it. I'll follow with an on-draft review next time I encounter it.  Poured into a Duvel tulip (hey, why not?), this three-week old Elder pours a deep burnt orange with a two-finger-thick off-white head. Agitation returns a hearty amount of head and reveals lots of lacing.  The nose is dominated by a huge bouquet of hops, with pine and grapefruit each doing their best to grab your attention. Although I don't partake in its use, nuances of that certain other plant that is close relative of the hop plant are also quite apparent, an olfactory characteristic even the brewery does not deny.  The initial bite is both sweet and bitter. Quickly following is a realization that what I'm tasting is a near-perfect example of the style... THIS is what an Imperial IPA should taste like! The grapefruit, pine, and various tropical fruits you pick up on the nose are each individually discovered as it sits on your tongue, complemented by a near-perfect malt presence. This is fiinish is soft and clean, leaving the perfect balance of sweetness and bitterness on the tongue.  Mouthfeel is smooth and creamy with carbonation levels right in the middle.  I can see why the RR brewpub has so many regulars. I'd drink this everyday too, given the chance.  Along with the Younger, this is the best IIPA I've ever had.

S - Pine, Citrus/Grapefruit and Hops  T - Similar to nose, heavy on the hops, followed by a citrus and pine and a little spice. Hop heads will love this one. It's not a hop bomb persay, it's just right, great balance with the malt!  M - A little thin on side in the mouth, could use some more body, but nice carbonation. For as hoppy as it is.

Poured a nice hazy orange with a nice frothy white head that disappeared rather quickly to show some bad ass lacing that was glued right to the glass. I repeat BAD ASS  Smells like a hop bomb should. Straight up piney hops all up in your grill. Also a tad of great grapefruit up in there as well, but mostly HOPS, HOPS, and more HOPS... then again HOPS. one more time?  Taste is again HOPS, duh. Also citrus grapefruit and some great malt presence as well. The piney hops deffinatly overpower ALL in it's path. Make's you pucker and your eye will twitch... twice.

This Beer has a wonderful new smell to it for me. A very strong Piney, woodsey, and Hoppy smell to it. Witht he slightest hint of fruits in the background.  Again this beer has a very refreshing Hoppy and Piney taste to it with hints of fruits in the background. As I went threw the beer the taste of fruits slightly disappeared but the hop and pine flavors intensified.  It's a sneaky beer that you would like to keep drinking do to the taste, but the beer will catch up to you!

With a med body head that disolves quick but has some nice clingy lacing.  Aroma is mainly hops, definately grapefruit and a bit of cracker but the hops do take over.  Taste is pretty smooth for an 8% beer. Nothing harsh, just nice hops and a well balanced malt profile. Very rich and flavorful, not as much of a hop bomb as I expected.

863,7971,tjsprague,4.77,"I have had a lot of very good beers the past few days and I feel like I am writing a lot of positive reviews. But even with all of these great beers and great reviews this beer may be my favorite of all time.  This beer pours surprisingly light and golden yellow. If you have never had it you would be suprised at the depth of flavor for a beer that looks so light.  The smell is just hops. Floral and excellent dry hopped aroma that betrays the color and lets you know that the beer in the glass is full of flavor.  Where the Pliny excelled for me is the taste. While I love hoppy bitter beers the Pliny manages to incredibly hoppy without being weighed down with too much bitterness of thickness. The mouthfeel of the beer is fairly light and fruity (for a beer with this flavor). It doesn't leave that thick hop resin or bitterness that you can get with some very hoppy beers. The taste is just what I am looking for in this type of beer, an excellent floral and fruity hop flavor without some of the heavy bitterness that can weigh down some beers.  For drinkability I think this beer is excellent. Like I said about the bitterness, the floral aspect of the hops makes it refreshing. Its the kind of beer I could enjoy with a summer bbq or a cool winter evening.

A - Poured into a tulip glass with a couple of centimetres of fluffy white head that falls fairly quickly. The beer itself is a clear dark gold with an orange hue. S - Smell is dominated by piney hop aromas. There is some tropical fruit notes in the background. Possibly faded away a bit over the few months. T - Piney and slight tropical fruit hop notes also in the taste backed up by a nice sweetish but not cloying biscuity malt character. M - Medium bodied, fairly low carbonation with a moderately bitter, dry finish. D - 8% well hidden. Not quite the ""hop bomb"" I was expecting; just a very drinkable, well balanced DIPA.

863,7971,bhalter8,4.8,"Thanks to mhewes for sending this in trade this week. Have been very excited to get my hands on this. Pours a light golden color with with a solid 1"" frothy white head. Leaves nice lacing on the pint as the head recedes. Maybe it is the DIPAs I have had, but this one looks lighter than most. A far more earthy/pine aroma to the hops, versus the citrusy hops that many IPAs have. The taste is exceptional, a strong hops punch, but surprisingly balanced. There is an interesting sweet taste, faintly, in the background that adds to aids in that balance. The ABV is well hidden, as this goes down smooth and easy. Definitely deserving of the hype, I only wish I could stock my fridge with them, as a self proclaimed hop head. A second tasting on 4/13/09 (bottled 1/23/09) has caused me to better appreciate the aroma and taste in this beer. The look is still very pale, but that doesn't come through in the taste. The crisp pine in both smell and taste is incredible, and yet balanced. Very light considering what it takes to get to this ABV and IBU. A third tasting of a three week old bottle has only further enhanced my appreciation of this beer. Amazing, I wish I lived in CA.",Russian River Brewing Company,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,100
863,7971,jminsc76,4.37,"The initial aroma is incredibly piny, like a deep, fresh breathe of forest. Upon swirling the glass and opening it up, slight aromas of creamy vanilla come through, with a big head that forms but diminishes rapidly upon settling. Tastes of bold hops, slightly bitter but very smooth. Pine all the way through. Complements the Mediterranean-style lamb dish I am having very well.  The body is a reddish golden, with the top exhibiting a nice cloudy appearance prior to agitation. Nice punch to the mouth via the hops but nothing too severe. Decent aftertaste but can become a little much if I don't follow up with a sip of water or another bite of lamb.  As the beer warms up a little, the taste becomes sweeter, less fresh pines and more grapefruit and other citrus.  This ranks among my top three favorite IPAs (Stone IPA and 90 Minute being the other two), and I have noticed little difference between drinking it from the tap versus from the bottle. Both are delicious - very full-bodied, fresh, and hitting the taste-buds just right without overwhelming them.",Russian River Brewing Company,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,100

Aroma was of honey and citrus fruits; I could smell tangerine and grapefruit in there.  Deceptive taste! Slightly sweet at first followed up immediately by a big bitterness reminiscent of lime. Not unpleasant however, pretty good and not what I was expecting. Very unique I would have to say.  Aftertaste sticks to the back of your tounge with a bitter lemon-rind like flavor. Good carbonation and medium bodied taste help this beer go down quick.  Good enough to have 1 or 2 but I would probably find the oily bitter aftertaste a little unpleasant and overpowering after that. Not as hoppy as I expected it to be (I'm not a huge hop-head). I'll definitely have another one sometime soon.",Russian River Brewing Company,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,100
863,7971,callmescraps,4.35,"Grabbed this one after trying the Younger. It was a pretty good night, I have to say.  Appearance - A nice, deep amber color. A couple inches of whispy head leave a little lacing. Deeper color than the Younger, but I actually liked it better.  Smell - Nice grapefruit. Definitely more pine hops. It's got a real earthiness, but lots of nice citrus as well. It's a good smell. It's heavier, with a real hop smell. Not messing around, that's for sure.  Taste - Pretty heavy hops. Definitely less balanced than the Younger. It is a little harsh on the hops. Pretty sweet up front, with all that citrus goodness. But then it gets heavier with the pininess. The aftertaste is nice and smooth however. It's very good. More of a traditional hop-bomb here. It doesn't sparkle on the tongue, but lays down big tracks.  Mouthfeel - Pretty good, but a little syrupy. Not as crisp as I'd like it to be.  Drinkability - Certainly not as great as the Younger. The alcohol warms a little, but generally mellows out. The syrupyness and the heaviness makes it a little tough. That said, it's so damned good that you want more.  If the Younger seemed a little ""thin"" at times, this one has no such problems. It's definitely a hop heaviness, without as much balance. It's almost hard to handle. The lady friend really liked the Younger, but this one was ""too hoppy"". It doesn't have that supreme craftsmanship and balance of the Younger. But, it's almost better in a way. It's hoppy, and doesn't apologize for anything. That said, it's pretty heavy.

S: An earthier kind of grapefruit than i have experienced with the hopslam and hopknot and very citrusy ipas. Grassy, but still extremely hoppy ad citrusy.  T: Wow. Hoppy, yes. What else would one expect. But not in the way i imagined. nowadays i expect dipas in particular to be all hops, no balance, no real complexity other than in your face ibus. the citrus hops are very present, but backed by a milder sweetness reminiscent of melon of some kind. It's dry as well, which is very pleasant.  M: Doesn't coat, but stands. good body on the whole mouth with a slight effervescence that goes with the hops very well. lifts the citrus, bitterness and dryness off the palate.  D: very very much so. I have found other dipas to have very low drinkability simply due to their abject lack of balance. somehow, even though it's not a balance with malt, this beer accomplishes that balance and is very pleasurable.",Russian River Brewing Company,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,100
863,7971,djeucalyptus,4.39,"realized I hadn't jotted down a review yet, so here' goes...  pours a beautiful glowing hazy (chill-hazed?) golden amber hue with a fair one-finger bubbly cap off of a vigorous pour. Fair retention before sinking to a ring that leaves some beautiful lacing.  Aroma is heavenly. Citrus, pine, floral, and herbal all take equal part in creating an intoxicating aroma on top of a biscut malt. Sweet, sugary, hoppy, grapefruit, pine trees and Lilly.  Taste is hop bittering right up front. Citrus and pine dominate, with a fair bit of floral and herbal. nears medicinal at times. A caramel and toffee sweetness is definitely present, helping to balance the heavily hop-centric brew.  Mouth is clean, crisp and full bodied. Carbonation is solid but not overbearing. A touch on the light side of being chewy. A bit drying, and a definite lingering bitterness.  All in all, pretty impressive. I've had a few here and there since last summer, and it always pleases. I can see how it's rated as one of the top brews, although I can't say I'm completely overwhelmed/floored. The bitterness is high, almost to the point of getting medicinal. The head isn't quite as stunning as I'd hope. But all in all, impressive.

So clear and such a nice color. The head is so white and frothy looking. Almost as if I got it on cask. Man it is a beautiful looking beer.  Smell is incredible. So much hop aroma. I have never smelled a beer with so much aroma. So much citrus/grape fruit/pine. It smells sublime.  Taste is off the wall hops. Nice and bitter and crisp but a TON of hop flavor and malt balance to make it very enjoyable. Man I love this beer.  Mouthfeel is perfect. Just enough carbonation and maltiness.  Drinkability: I would drink this all night at a bar and it will be a beer I keep around in my fridge for sure whenever I get a hop craving.

Pours lighter than one tends to expect from an IPA. Hazed and yellow orange in the glass it certainly fits the style but for some reason I was imagining something more amber orange? The scent is downright punchy. Citrus and floral hop scents seasoned with lemon zest and flowers. Hits the nose as soon as the bottlecap is popped. Flavors are even more so. Dry and crackery with a really nice bite of hops. Fresh artisnal bread comes to mind; some sort of hint of fresh tropical fruit is in there, too. At 8% alcohol this is dangerously pleasant and drinkable. I would love to have this is my go-to double IPA.

T - Full bodied but not malty by any means just straight up hoppiness from start to finish...grapefruit.  M - Attacks the tongue with a decent amount of carbonation but then slips right off and dissipates completely.

After the pour this beer just sort of chills out in the glass looking nice and waiting to be drank.  Smells of intense citrus, grapefruit smell is very very strong, wow I love it. The hoppy aroma this beer emits is just ridiculous. Definitely lives up to the hype in this department.  Sip is taken, slight whiplash is received from the sheer hoppy bitter beauty of the first taste. My tongue is instantly numbed, not a huge amount of malt backbone but I'm not really looking for it in a hop bomb like this one. Lots of lemon and grapefruit taste that just comes out in every sip. Absolutely delicous and stunningly hoptastic.  Pliny to me is almost like someone put a little tiny miniature invisible Randall inside the bottle filled with super compressed fresh hops and thats what this beer poured through before entering my glass. I'm not sure how so MUCH flavor and aroma can come from a clear amber liquid.  If I had more than one of these I'd certainly be looking forward to a second one.

863,7971,taez555,4,"Thanks to my fellow BA speakorspasm for hooking me up with this beer via convincing our fellow co-worker Alice who was in CA to pick up some bottles.  bottled on date 123008, tasted 020509  This beer pours a clear orange body with a decent sized white head.  Nose is extremely piney and just screams hops. Not a whole lot in the way of any distinct fruit smells, or strong citrus, mostly just pure pine needles. There's this mild herbal, almost potpourri type smell that sits quietly in the background.  Taste is full bodied with an immediate hop attack, yet what really strikes me right off the bat is how well balanced it is. Alcohol is very warming, right from the first few sips. Hops very much overshadow the malt base giving no real distinct malt flavors other than just some basic grain and caramel touches. Very bitter from start to finish, with no roller coaster ride of bitter moments, it's basically just there on the pallet the entire time. As for the hops, again like the nose, extremely piney, but in the taste a lot of that hop resin and fungal citrus really shine through. The full body and alcohol really make this beer seem bigger than it's 8%. Ends with a long lingering hoppy bitterness.  This is a really good DIPA. In my opinion though, maybe not the best. I still think Great Divide's Hercules on tap and/or Stone's Ruination have this beat, but... still a strong contender for one of the better DIPA.",Russian River Brewing Company,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,100

The nose is just incredible on this one: tangerine, grapefruit, orange zest, and pineapple, with some sweet caramel and doughy malts lingering in the background. One of the best DIPAs I have ever smelled.  Taste begins with some bitter pine and grapefruit rind, before some sweet citrus and caramel. The sweetness quickly subsides before a long, dry bitter finish.  Mouthfeel is on the fuller side of medium-bodied. Very smooth and perfectly carbonated.  Perfect drinkability for me.

Bottled Date: 11/28/08 (Sampled on 2/4/09, so just over two months old)  Appearance: A slightly hazy gold-orange body with a two-finger head. The head lingers for a goodly period of time, and provides ample evidence of its presence by the lacing formed. Carbonation is moderate with very small bubbles supporting head retension.  Smell: A fruit-salad of smells. Plenty of crisp/clean citrus aromas that is present from arms-lengh. More citrus that piney. Very inviting and quite robust.  Taste: Smooth opening that gradually increases in crisp hop presence at the midpoint, resolving to a mellow malty dry finish. I don't get the feel of the 8% ABV, it is well hidden behind a hoppy estery body. There is a cleansing finish on this beer, but not due to an ""over-hopped"" bitter bite.  Mouthfeel: Suprisingly dense which I can only attribute to a good malt base upon which to build upon. There is again a smoothness that transports the beer around your mouth and doesn't leave an overbearing bite.  Drinkability: This is an IPA, not a Belgian Strong Dark Ale. I was very much expecting a ""hop-bomb"" from the hype surrounding this offering. That was not to be. Yes, this is an exceedingly hoppy offering, but there is a ""balance"" to this madness. I very much felt the presence of the earthy malty sweetness that ""did battle"" with the hops for balance. I am NOT an IPA fan by any stretch of the mind, but I had to feel this one for myself.

Smells of extreme pine and some peach and other fruit delicacies.  This beer actually grabbed the back of my tongue, like arms on a grasshopper would grab a grass stalk, and it implanted a big old hop cone into my tongue. As the hops are in the forefront of this beer there some beautiful flavors in the malt. Soft and subtle sweet malt flavors follows the hop punch.  This hop maharajah is truly a treat. Thanks to the people who traded with me for this beer.",Russian River Brewing Company,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,100
863,7971,Lunchmade,4.72,"Been hearin' about this brew and finally got a taste and was very pleased. Rolled over to Toronado in San Diego and was excited to see this on draft. It definitely lived up to the hype. A beautiful golden brew with a nice white head. Citrus and floral scents up the nose and a filled and coasted the mouth as smooth as it can get. A gentle, nice pine flavor accompanied every sip and I turned to my bro and said, ""this could be one of the best beers I have had in a year"". It might of been that I was achin' for a beer Saturday afternoon, but I believe that Pliny is an exceptional Double IPA without the harsh alcohol flavor and it was so tasty and I NEED MORE!",Russian River Brewing Company,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,100
863,7971,Gilgemesh,4.58,Thanks must go to Med who managed to not drink the growler himself and bring it by for me to have some.  A - A nice Amber color with thin white head. It just looked great sitting in the glass.  S - A nice citrus hop aroma with a hint of woodyness. The hop notes were nice and complex.  T - Tastes great. There's orange and cherry notes with a nice earthy finish. The hop characteristics come through great without being overly aggressive. Nice balance  M - Good full mouthfeel. Perfect carbonation. Did I mention it tasted great?  D - I could have way to much of this if it was always near by.,Russian River Brewing Company,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,100
863,7971,kwakwhore,5,"Review number 150: I wanted something special for this one. Ordered from Southbay Drugs in San Diego and picked it up from Fedex today. Bottled on 12/30/2008 so this is fresh! Beautiful peach/orange color with a smallish white head. Copious lacing on the glass. Pine dominated scent in the aroma with floral accents. Pine scents stay with the beer all the way down. On further reflection this deserves a 5. Best smelling DIPA ever. Deliciously grapefruity hops dominate the flavor but in a subtly understated fashion. The bitterness doesn't smack you in the face the way some other west coast IPAs do. An underpinning of malt provides a bit of balance, again in a subtle way. Bitterness persists in a deliciously long lasting finish. Surprisingly light and refreshing mouthfeel contributes to an exceptionally drinkable beer. I could drink this beer all night. I'm not sure what I was expecting, but this was a complete surprise. For an 8%abv beer this is an amazingly delicate, subtle beer. I've had a lot of really good DIPAs but this is truly in a class of its own.",Russian River Brewing Company,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,100

Very strong aroma of resin, sweet, floral and pine. Starts with a good resiny flavor that is well balanced with caramel. Stays this way throughout, just a nice continuous fresh hopfest. Ethanol is moderate. medium body. Nice lingering bittersweet aftertaste.

Smell - Hop notes fill the nose and draw your senses immediately to the beer. Taste - Blast of grapefruit and citrus hops with extraordinary smoothness before a crisp, bitter finish. The bitterness is minimal for such a hoppy beer. Mouthfeel - This beer has a light mouthfeel, but there is some creaminess that gives it a larger body than one expects. Drinkability - Incredibly drinkable and refreshing. Just remember this is a high ABV beer.",Russian River Brewing Company,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,100

I'm not a big hoppy drinker but this beer was excellant on tap. Never thought much of Pliny till I joined ba and saw it was. A top 100. So I bought me a bottle and as of tonight the elder is my 2nd favorite beer. The hype is right on. And I'm not a ipa drinker.

Maybe less on the pine, but the main difference is the mid palate. Though it was huge and dominating. Maybe a bit more amber? and I thought a tad more sweet though others didn't. Really excited to try and felt it was different and maybe a tad better than regular kegs. Some felt recent bottles are the best Pliny Elders because the freshness.

863,7971,Foxtrot,4.97,"Since recently discovering my liking to IPA's and DIPA's I was really looking forward to trying this. Here is my take.  Poured a very beautiful and crystal clear straw/gold with a nice white had and plenty of lacing.  The aroma's coming off this thing was out of this world. I must have stuck my nose in my glass for about a good 10 minutes because it was that damn good. Filled my nostrils with immense aroma's of fresh herbal hops that is to die for.  One taste of this beer and I knew that this was THE best DIPA I have every had. A considerable hop presence caresses the taste buds and picks up with exquisite citrus and grapefruit flavors and finishes smooth. The thing that really stands out is that it really doesn't have a huge hop bitterness that one finds in other DIPA's, gives this beer a whole other dimension of appreciation. The sky is the limit with this beer, its that damn good!  Mouthfeel was absolutely superb, coats the mouth with a nice body. Crisp clean body makes this hugely fantastic.  I have to give Vinnie at Russian River a big thanks for imagining and creating such a masterful brew for the world to enjoy. This is THE BEST DIPA I have ever had the grace of putting to my lips.

863,7971,jeff2486,4.94,I was attracted to this world of craft beers by IPA/DIPAs but I have never had anything like Pliny the Elder. I had a blind pig the night before and really enjoyed it and never imagined this would be so much better.  The beer's appearance was not that impressive but everything after that was fantastic. There is such a strong hop presence but the bitterness of the hops are so well hidden. You receive all of the amazing flavor with none of the bitterness that turns some people away from beers high in hops.,Russian River Brewing Company,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,100

863,7971,PerzentRizen,4.87,"Thanks to BrewerB for the amazing beer trade. This is one fine individual.  This is quite fresh - bottled December 30, 2008. Excellent!  I poured my Pliny into a Duvel glass. It is amazingly clear and has a great head/lacing. This is just beautiful.  The smell is piney and floral. It literally smells like you're in the middle of a pine forest and the rain begins to fall around you.  The taste is trascendent. Like bitterness then a big hop kick and a dry piney finish followed by intense hop flavor makes this one amazing IPA. It is now my favorite. Russian River doesn't drown you with hop oil to get the IBU's up but rather uses a finess to coax the gentle delicate hop goodnes.  The mouthfeel is really light and airy but with the body of a great IPA. Excellent!  As far as drinkability I could drink this all day. The flavor is amazing, the body is rich but smooth. The only reason it doesn't get a 5 is because at 8% ABV it will start to drink me after 3 or so.  Great brew!!!",Russian River Brewing Company,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,100

S: Not as much grapefruit up front as any of the times I've had it on tap. Still there, though, just a bit more bitter. T: Again, less amazing than on tap; the grapefruit is much less strong and the hoppy bitterness comes out considerably more. M: Remembered it having more carbonation.

863,7971,WickedSluggy,4.87,"Avon Liquors in Avon, CO had a great selection of beers including two from Russian River (Blind Pig was the other.) I was pleasantly surprised to find these there.  Before opening, I let the beer warm maybe 15 minutes out of the stores cooler temperature.(fresh dated 12/5/08 opened 1/23/09)  A - Amber orange with plenty of pale colored dense foam.  S - The Citrusy bouquet was almost like an appetizing perfume on a beautiful girl that makes your mouth water. Very nice. Got to have her right here on the steps of the Comfort Inn.  T - She didn't only look good and smell sweet; the consummation of the act was just what I hoped it would be. While the base of this beer is perfect, the perfection of the malt base is like what a good piece of bread is when you want to feature the jam. And the jam is the hops. To date, I have not experienced a hops flavor that surpasses this one. It was just what the bouquet had suggested. Flavor hops was extraordinary -fruity, grapefruity, piney.  M - You do not want to drink after me when I let the beer flow into my mouth like this. I am disgusting. I swam in this one like I do when I drink a good barleywine.

863,7971,ajr24,4.62,"I hunted down this beer a few times this past Fall when it finally came to Philly. I thank this website plus its users for all the inside scoops!  A- Pours a sparkling and hazy orange with a creamy and strong white head. Held up to the light or stuck in a dark cellar this beer still holds a delicious appearance.  S- Woo! A lot going on in the nose of this one, and that ain't a bad thing. Not really many overpowering aromas present in some DIPAs but citrus-orange would be the most prevalent. Underneath all of those west coast hops you can find its delicate malt profile. It's amazing how well the aggressive hoppiness complements the fragile maltiness in this beer.  T- DEFINITELY from Cali! The onset of this beer is a hop-punch followed by a soothing malt backbone- when I paid attention I found some caramel, wafer type flavor. Its hop character is powerful but harmonious- like I said, not overwhelming.  M- Pretty explosive but eventually settles down. The hops bounce around with the carbonation and it's pretty exciting. This beer has an energy that you can feel.  D- Like most good DIPAs I rate the drinkability quite high and the same goes for this one. Its high ABV isn't exactly a force to be reckoned with.  Overall this beer was a treat. I'm happy that I finally tracked it down. NEED MORE!",Russian River Brewing Company,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,100

M - Thick, but not too thick. Between a normal IPA and a stout.  D - Very drinkable. High in alcohol, but you don't notice it at all. I could easily put down 3 of these and be ready for more.  All in all, a very worthy, delicious beer and a fine example of a proper Double IPA.

S: Strong aromas of sweet citrus and floral hops. Individual aromas of tangerine & pink grapefruit. Lots of underlying bready malts -- extremely inviting aroma.  T: Sweet fruity malts followed by a light bitterness pop. From the smell, you think you're are gonna get slammed with hops. But Pliny is one of the most composed and balanced DIPA's I've ever tasted.  M. ""Wow factor"" -- real luscious. Coats the palette nicely -- real smooth like a baby's bottom.

As it warms the citrus aromas take the front seat.  M - Medium in body with a fairly smooth, somewhat creamy feel to it, despite the hops oil.  T - This has some complex flavors going on, for sure. Some floral hops followed by some bready malts. This is followed up by citrus, orange, lemon and a grapefruit finish that's only slightly bitter. This increases the beers drink-ability dramatically. The alcohol is practically non-existent in the taste.  This is by far one of the most drinkable DIPA's I've ever tasted.

Finishes clean with a hint of grapefruit remaining. The 8% alcohol is well hidden.  Medium bodied, clean and bright, with a sharp carbonation.  Hops, hops, and more hops...and I love it.

I just knew I would love this, and I was...right! There's not much to say that hasn't been said, but this review is as much for myself to look back on as this sets the standard for the style.  A: Standard hazy orangy looking IPA, nice 1"" white head, looks just like I pictured it would.  S: Here we go people, Pungent aroma of flowery hops. I detect a citrusy scent of grapefruit, orangy lemon zest, and pine and hops again.  T: First blissful taste impression...this is complex. Nice spiciness, flowery hops, someone locked me in a greenhouse and I need to eat my way out! The finish is CRISP, not bitter, the aftertaste is mildly bitter and the alcohol warmness kicks in. AS with any quality brew, mouth swishing sets of a chain reaction of complexities. This is wonderful.  M: Oily, clings to the palate, substantive, wonderful!  D: Oh yeah, I could drink these, but well no I can't because I live in the Northeast, so I'll need to pop one at a time, and wait for my next trade.  This is the IPA from which all should be measured (for me). Did I say Crisp? Damn! The hops are obviously prominent but the typical overt bitterness is squashed by the proper amount of malt. A hophead's delight for sure, and a damn near perfect brew. Hope to get it on tap some day!

863,7971,BARFLYB,4.62,"Had this many times and finally getting around to reviewing this gem. 15oz pour into a stemmed glass at Union Jacks Pub.  A- RR Pliny The Elder has a very pronounced orange, slighty amber color to it, a shade darker than the Blind Pig. Also no hazyness to this as it's quite clear. A nice 1/2 inch off white head showed itself then took an exit. Not much lacing going on here.  S- A good heap of piney hops up front and a bunch of grapefruit and floral qualities which was expected. Some pineapple and earthy tones. Like with all Russian River offerings, I smelled this for at least 10 minutes before indulging, it's just that good.  T- California GOODNESS. Pliny comes off with the expected citrus hop flavor with a minimal amount of caramel malt sweetness to get in the way. This is not a hop-bomb in my eyes, more like a very nicely balanced DIPA. A sort of grainy, bready feel towards the middle. A bit of bitterness, nothing overbearing. Had this in a bottle also and I think tap is the way to go.  M- Sure, the hops attack the palette, but in a good way, not killing off any taste senses, but i'm sure that would happen after a few. Medium mouthfeel and slick body and much smoother than the blind pig. I never say this but the alcohol was hidden tremendously. A double IPA that drinks like an IPA. Quite a feat.  D- Smooth sailing for the drinkability as pliny does not attack the tounge leaving it's mark forever. The malts used to offset the hops are used perfectly where other ""Hopbombs"" lack in this area. Balance is key, and Pliny provides that. I would and have the ability to seek this out on draft when it's available in my area and i'm very grateful.  Cant wait for pliny's younger brother to show up at Philly beer week 09.",Russian River Brewing Company,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,100

Very unbalanced but tremendously delicious hop treat.  M- Oily and thin. Coats the mouth well and leaves a lingering aftertaste of bitterness.

Relatively gentle bitterness for 100 IBUs.  Enough malt to balance the hops, but not enough to get in their way. Body is light; just like it should be. This is one drinkable DIPA.  Very good, but nothing transcendent. I really wish this had wider distribution. I would be buying it often.  Also...

863,7971,DoesntMatter46,4.54,"Appearance is very clear, not cloudy at all. I'd say its a pale copper color, nice layer of white head when I poured the half liter bottle in to my half liter Mousel Luxembourg beer stein.  Smell is very floral, very hoppy and very noticeable as soon as I started pouring it an arms length away. A slew of hops must have been added right at the end, as they show up much more as aroma than as bitterness.  Taste is obviously based on the hops. It's very piney and spicey. There's no strong alcohol taste, and the malt doesn't give much body, this beer is all about the hops. Overall, not too bitter, and for its style, well balanced.  I could easily sit and drink a few of these, but with so many West Coast IPAs, this beer is not the be- all, end- all, holy grail some have talked it up to be.

863,7971,InsolublePancake,4.42,"Bottled 11/4/08. Purchased online from South Bay Drugs.  A- Light gold with hints of orange; quite light for the style. Pours with a nice, fluffy head and leaves quite a bit of lacing on the sides of the glass.  S- Mainly citrusy hops with a nice sweet orange juice aroma. There are some big floral and pine notes, too. Really a superb DIPA smell.  T- Starts out with a touch of sweetness before the hops take over. Citrus rind and pine are the main flavors here. A cracker-like malt balances the hops out just enough so that they don't get out of control. Finishes dry with a strong but not overwhelming bitterness. Very nice.  M- Nice medium body with a good carbonation level: not too high, not too low.  D- Very good for a DIPA. It doesn't have the extremely high alcohol and cloying sweetness that hinder some examples of the style. I could easily have a couple (or more) of these.  This is a great beer, although it's not transcendent. I can see why people might be disappointed when they were led to believe that they would reach Nirvana upon tasting it. I try to ignore the hype surrounding a beer and rate it based solely on my tastes and how I think it compares to other similar beers (the key word here being ""try""). To me this simply ranks as an outstanding beer worthy of a great deal of praise. Is it the best DIPA ever?

It's a very good IPA, but for me, it didn't live up to the hype that proceeded it. If you want hops, go for Green Flash's IPA.

Pours slightly hazy honey colored with thick bubbly head after a somewhat aggressive pour. Large bubbles clung to the glass, bridging to the diminishing head that thinned but stayed around to the last sip. Very nice warm floral hop aroma. Nicely balanced initial flavor with bitter hops and malt transitioning to a slowly evolving sweet malt and floral/bitter hop aftertaste that seemed to have a peak sweetness in the middle and a long bitter aftertaste that sits on top of the tongue. Mouthfeel is medium to full bodied, moderately carbonated, somwhere near the line between syruppy and crisp. Very nice.

863,7971,BattleRoadBrewer,4.41,"Served cool from a pint bottle at about 36F into a Boston Lager glass.  Pours with medium thick body and a nice heavy off white head about 1"" high.  Color is light amber, leaning towards golden, with no haze.  Aroma is very hoppy, citrusy, sweet. Notable level of diacetyl not present in a growler I had previously.  Taste is very well balanced between hops, malt and alcohol. Lots of residual malts making it sweet, but not too much.  Mouthfeel is moderate thickness for the style, slick, with a hint of alcohol warmth.  As it warms in the glass, it perfectly maintains its balance.  Overall a really drinkable beer, but it loses something in the bottle vs a growler.  Edit 2015: Vinny has finally fixed the bottled version problems. I still like it on draft best followed by growler followed by bottle.  Edited on 3/3/14: Tweaking my earlier review(s) which were based on what in hindsight were old/abused bottles. Zero defects, no DMS, no diacetyl, just a fabulous beer.  Edited on 1/4/12: Just had another Pliny in the bottle. No diacetyl this time, instead DMS. Nose had no hops, just cooked corn. Still good hop flavor and overall balance.  Original review: Brewed on 12/7/11, less than 30 days ago. WTF? RR should give up bottling PtE, since PtE on tap is tied for best beer I've ever had, and in the bottle it's dependably junk. Maybe they should CAN it instead?",Russian River Brewing Company,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,100
863,7971,Ineedabeerhere,4.62,"Believe the Hype. Had the privilege of consuming this brew on a few occasions- most recently thanks to the generosity of great traders like MiScusi and swnicholson.  I've had this everywhere from one month old to about three. It certainly deteriorates faster than Blind Pig for some reason, but upon opening even a 3 month old bottle, the aroma is mesmerizing.  Most Recently, 500mL bottle (11/10/08) into a Bruery-Branded Tulip yields a gorgeous light colored-yellow/amber brew with an inch of ivory head. I can almost smell it from across the room!  Tons of piney, citrusy hops fill the nostrils. I have never had anything else smell like this before. Fresh cut grapefruit and golden pineapple, with some grassy notes.  To me, in the taste is where it isn't a Double IPA. The 8% abv is borderline- tons of single IPAs are 7% and most doubles are over 9%. Regardless, its all a matter of definition- who cares it's a delicious beer! Just as the nose would suggest, the flavors play through with a wonderful caramel malt presence that doesn't get in the way of the hop flavors, but is still the slightest bit noticeable. Aggressively fruity from citrus to peach to pineapple, with a certain stickiness that is akin to an herbal grassy flavor. Plenty bitter, but such great hop flavor that it becomes negligible.  The alcohol is so well hidden, you would never believe it clocks in at a solid 8%, very very drinkable although you wouldn't want to drink more than one or two, as it surely does a number on your palate. Every time I get one of these in a trade I have to savor it though its hard with such a great drinkability. Now I need to get my hands on some of the Younger.",Russian River Brewing Company,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,100
863,7971,Brewsmith,5,"From a 0.5L bottle purchased at Hi Times Cellars in Costa Mesa.  Aroma is thick with hop oils, musky, like I stuck my head in a bag of Cascade or Centennial.  Golden yellow with a fluffy off-white head. Fairly clear.  Flavor is again bursting with hops, orangey pine. Amazingly the malt still balances and t is not over the top.  Clean and dry with some lingering bitterness that is quite refreshing. Not over carbonated. Just about the best Double IPA I have ever had.",Russian River Brewing Company,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,100
863,7971,sonicdescent,4.77,"Thank you skourtis for the opportunity to try this!  Pours a light golden color with a frothy two finger head that coats the side of the glass when it disappears.  Orange and pineapple scents way out front. The fabled west coast DIPA strikes!  Tastes..wow, I was expecting a hop bomb but not at all. Definitely something I am not used to in an ipa. Strong, but not overly bitter because of it. The word tropical comes to mind.  Mouth is medium/thick and carbonation is low/medium.  Incredible and lives up to the hype. If only I could easily get my hands on the stuff.",Russian River Brewing Company,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,100
863,7971,Phyl21ca,3.92,Bottle: Poured a deep orangey color ale with a large foamy head with good retention and some lacing. Aroma of medium bitter hops notes with some well crafted citrus notes also dominating. I thought the taste of malt was somewhat subtle and overshadowed by some citrusy and bitter hops. Full body with great carbonation. Although this is a very well crafted IIPA is still think it is lacking some of the grapefruit notes that can elevated the style to another level.,Russian River Brewing Company,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,100
863,7971,Needsbeer,4.79,"16.9oz poured into my unmarked 16oz pint class. Bottle design is very mellow and straight forward with plenty of history as well as warnings not to age Pliny.  Appearance: Very clear light golden hue, pour gives moderate, but persistent, pearly head. Very noticeable lacing throughout.  Nose: Fantastically floral nose with strong notes of resin and earthiness. Hops dominate.  Taste: Tons of citrusy hops that are quickly balanced by malt sweetness. The resin flavor sticks to the tongue for a few moments and is replaced by a brief memory of bitters at the back of the palate. Lots of grapefruit.  Notes: Tremendous beer and one of my favorite DIPAs. Russian Rivers comes through on this one. Alcohol warming is present but subdued. The intense hops are balanced perfectly with malt and result in great drinkability. Perhaps it's only downfall as a DIPA is that it is almost too balanced.

863,7971,JToad,4.83,"Got a bottle of this courtesy of CPFerris.. Thanks Chad, you're awesome!  Poured into my Samichlaus goblet. Dark tan, blood orangish in color. Perfect head, that dissipates quickly, nice frothy lacing on the side of the glass.  Smells of pine right off the bat. Grapefruit definetely there, not over the top. Very well balanced smell. One smell does not overpower the other.  An incredibly smoothe IIPA. Loads of hops, without being way too bitter. Alchohol is not very noticeable, which is unlike a lot of other hopbombs out there. Unbeliveably well balanced. Everything about it. Smell, taste..it all compliments each other very nicely.  My first beer of the night, and after half a glass, the alchohol just hit me like a ton of bricks. Im writing this as I drink it, and I feel a slight buzz already. Definetely creeps up on you.  All in all, this is worth the hype. I would find this impossible to turn down, if I could actually get it in Indiana. DIPA's are my favorite style, and Im not sure there is a better one out there. Pliny the Elder is def. the most well balanced Imperial IPA I have ever had. Truly a remarkable beer.",Russian River Brewing Company,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,100
863,7971,scootny,4.77,"A hazy light gold liquid that delivers a good head with nice retention. Better is the abundant lacing. Goes all the way down. Mild carbonation keeps the glass covered in light sea foam.  Smell is grapefruit and pine forrest. A small citrus grove of orange and tangerine hide beneath with a strong amount of toffee and whole grain breads. Yeasty fruit esters subtly tie it together.  Taste is just not to be believed. I believe balance is the key to DIPAs. Yes hops are king but they must have a good malt stage to play from. This beer has that in spades. Multilayered hop bomb hits the tongue first. Grapefruit at the fore. Malted grains and yeasty, toasted, multigrain breads in the middle. Finish is dry. Grapefruit skin and an astringent, puckering bitter hoppiness that hangs and blends back into a graham and toast flavor.  Mouthfeel is lighter that you would expect. Flowing with an effervescent liveliness that scrubs the mouth and hits the back of the throat perfectly. A subtle creaminess can be detected from time to time.  Drinkability is obscene. No alcohol, light in body and feel. A quaffer from the word go. Only problem is spelling quaffer after two bottles of this sneaky brew.  The paradigm DIPA. Not as high in abv as some and that is is good thing. This one is all about the taste and drinkability. Glad I have two more bottles. Big thanks to swnicholson for this one.",Russian River Brewing Company,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,100
863,7971,tjthresh,3.54,"Bottled on 090208. Yellow to light orange. Soft soap bubble white head. The aroma is and flavor are full of pine and citrusy goodness, but to be honest, I feel Blind Pig really have a better aroma and more hop flavor. This was very easy to drink and pretty enjoyable, but I'd never think of it as Imperial or Double. I guess that is a good thing.

863,7971,IPAs4lyfe,4.89,"This is just one hell of an epic beer. The head wasn't too great, but plenty of lacing, good carbonation, and pale amber in color. The smell. My god. Best smelling beer I have had the pleasure of smelling, like a beautiful bouquet of fresh flowers with some pine and citrus notes. The taste was exceptional. Whatever hops they used, its just perfect and we'll leave it at that. Awesome mouthfeel, and the finish is a lovely bitterness that lingers in your lymph nodes that makes you just want more, and more, and more. Drinkability is outstanding; for 8%, the alcohol is WELL hidden, I could drink this all night every night. I may be fluffing this beer a bit much, but it is my absolute favorite beer as of now, and im just glad that Russian River decided to start distributing in CO. I might have to order a case because its so hard to find and in such high demand. Simply Outstanding.",Russian River Brewing Company,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,100
863,7971,Rayek,4.17,"A: Hazy deep gold with mild carbonation from tiny bubbles. Puffy cream head has good retention and leaves substantial lace.  S: Lot's of grapefruit, plus pine, pepper, spruce and a little brown sugar.  T: Very bitter, but not over the top. Tart lemon and grapefruit flavors dominate the rather complex bitterness. A faint taste of sugar syrup rides in the back. Finishes dry, with a lingering citrus bitterness.  M: Medium-heavy body feels creamy, oily and a little leafy. Carbonation level is about right.  D: My first beer off of the BA Top 10 list. Because I knew that going in, I think I was expecting a little too much from it. Very nice overall, but not earth shattering. I'm still glad that I tried it.",Russian River Brewing Company,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,100
863,7971,vacax,4.58,"500 mL of Pliny in bottle form from The Wine Country in Signal Hill. Bottled 11/26/08.  A: Mildly cloudy and straw colored. Thick white head that leaves enough laces to tie shoes. Not my first time having it on bottle (or tap for that matter) but lighter in color than I seemed to recall. Good amount of carbonation is evident.  S: Rutti tutti fresh and fruity. Citrus, mango, pineapple, and some pine in there.  T: Seeing and smelling this liquid cannot prepare your tastebuds for the quantity of flavor in every sip of this beer. Tongue stinging hops bring a bushel of piney and citrusy flavor. Heavily bitte bring a sort of masochistic ecstacy to the tongue. Mildly alcoholic taste that meshes will with the bitters.  M: Medium to light body with quite a bit of carbonation. I have no doubt that this is the right combination for the flavors in this beer, though. Relatively light and bubbly mouth adds to drinkability of such a large flavor profile.  D: This is one of the rare enormously flavorful beers that begs to be drank in terms of pints. So hoppy and savage one second, can't wait to take another sip the next. Rare victory of a big beer that one simply cannot get enough of in a sitting. The only drawback is this isn't packaged in a six pack instead of 500 mL singles.",Russian River Brewing Company,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,100

S - Pine, citrus, flowers and caramel, oh my!  T - Pine, citrus, flowers, and bittering hops. I cannot taste any malt.  M - Very filling, but definite hoppier balance in the mouthfeel. Expected for a double IPA.  D - Overall a good beer that wants to kick your teeth in.

Very healthy white head thats rocky with medium-sized bubbles. Great retention and nice lacing as well.  A: Umm...a fucking boatload of hops, mostly reminiscent of grapefruit, pineapple, and some grassy notes. Toasted caramel malt underneath. Every time I drink this, it just reinforces the fact that this is one of the best smelling beers on the entire planet! Unbelievably explosive!  T: Hops just burst onto the scene and commence to whippin' ass. They seem to erupt on the palate and spill their bitter goodness which blankets every taste bud. Biscuity malt is present, but its definitely ""riding bitch"" on this trip. Starts with an orange rind type of bitterness, and is followed by what tastes like an actual bite into the juiciest grapefruit known to man! Sweet underneath with flashes of caramel malt, but that malt backbone is just enough to hold up the hop attack while still staying out of the way of its brilliance. In other words, it does a great job of providing a springboard for the hops to shine without invading on this monstrous hop bomb. Finishes dry and leaves the tongue tingling from the hop assault. Aftertaste lasts forever! Alcohol is next to undetectable.  M: Incredibly smooth, medium-full bodied, crisp & clean, refreshing, and a bit sticky.  D: We need a higher scale to measure the drinkability of this one!  Notes: This is absolutely awesome! Now that I have been around the block with some of the other top-notch DIPA's out there, I can honestly say this is the cream of the crop! A great example of why I love craft beer.

Clear light golden, little no head that comes as a disappointment. Doesn't look as well as I hoped it would.  Tons of fresh citrus hops. Great grapefruit scent that really hits the nasal buds well, a little bit of a pine scent to it.  Really smooth onset that leads up a decent hop kick with a little bit too malt backbone. Not much complexity and really light and slightly watery.  Rereviewed.  This was one of the stickiest DIPAs I have encountered. Huge citrus component with incredibly pine tastes.

It's the perfect hophead beer with a touch of caramel and a TON of hops.  Mouthfeel is pretty good with an excellent masking of the abv and a fair amount of carbonation  This one is pretty damn good.

863,7971,Phillyduke,4.45,"My first review of 2009! After suffering through a post-Christmas cold, I decided to start the year off the best way I could think of and finally enjoy the beer that has been calling to me from my fridge ever since I received it in a BIF last fall. I'm not feeling quite 100% yet, but I'm awfully close, and I'd hate to let this sit any longer. Reading the label I feel guilty holding on to it as long as I have already!  A: A 500 ml NR with a bottled date of 08/13/08 poured into my Duvel tulip glass. Beer is a gorgeous deep copper orange. 2 fingers of off-white foam so densely packed it could have passed for a tempur-pedic mattress sit atop the glass capped by soapy sticky bubbles. Head shows great retention and leaves trails of fine lacing down the sides of the glass as it recedes. Beer is remarkably clear and shows some active carbonation from the laser etching in the bottom of the glass.  S: HUGE citrus hops in the nose. There are hints of some honey-like sweetness, but the smell is dominated by oranges and tangerines throughout the progression of the beer. I could literally smell this all day and never tire from the enormity of the inviting hop presence.  T/M: Initial sips reveal primarily bitterness. After enjoying the nose so much my first thoughts are that I hope the beer hasn't already peaked, and that my lingering cold isn't interfering with my tastebuds. I wish the citrus came through on the palate as well, and it starts to more so as the beer approaches room temperature. The somewhat sweet malt backbone never competes for attention, but helps to provide tremendous balance and drinkability to a beer that's otherwise all about the hops. Mouthfeel is silky smooth with a creamy carbonation approaching cask-conditioning. Finish is bitter and relatively dry, and the well-hidden ABV becomes more noticeable in the last few sips.  D/O: A beer that is well-worth the hype, and even better if you can find it fresh on draught. One of the easiest drinking and most balanced DIPAs around, I hope this finds wider distribution in bottles, as I'd like to try a brewery-fresh batch with no lingering illness.",Russian River Brewing Company,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,100
863,7971,swizzlenuts,4.32,"The beer is poured with a good fluffy one inch head with a orangish copper colour. Great retention and lacing. Looks great, but could be slightly darker. The nose has a huge hoppy aroma. Some citrus hints, but it primarily dominated by piny/resiny hops, and a little bit of caramel sweetness comes through at the end. This should be a cologne. The beer is incredibly bitter, which is to be expected. The hop flavour is definitely quite grassy/piny/resiny. The beer has a lot of flavours that are hard to put my finger on, but once you've had a few sips the bitterness goes away and the caramel malts comes through. The mouthfeel is good, fair amount of carbonation and slightly creamy. The beer is fairly drinkable.",Russian River Brewing Company,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,100

After I poured the first bottle, my brother in law could smell the pine 10 feet away. The beer pours a deep yellow, when held up to a light it is very clear. The head is impressive and leaves a respectable amount of lacing. The taste follows the nose. The pine flavors are up front and intense. The aftertaste lingers well after the beer is sipped.

863,7971,b3barron,4.89,Scored this thanks to the kind brother of a fellow BA and consumed it on Christmas day. 500 ml bottle poured into a tumbler.  A - Normal pour produced a 1 inch frothy white head with good retention and a decent amount of lacing. Soft orange/copperish color that reminded me of a glowing sunset when I squinted and held it up to the sunny sky.  S - Freshly cut grapefruit and tangerine. Also very floral and reminded me of Two Hearted in this regard.  T - Citrusy hops up front with lingering notes of orange and grapefruit. Very soft malt backbone with pronounced bitterness throughout. Slightly dry finish. This was a fresh bottle and was very thirst-quenching.  M - Medium bodied and extremely smooth. Moderate carbonation really delivers the freshness of the hops.  D - Through the roof for a DIPA. Love the dry finish and hop-leaning balance of this beer. I would consume this regularly if I could as it is almost as drinkable as many of my favorite regular IPAs.  Perhaps my favorite DIPA to date. Many beers in this style have disappointed me lately and this was a welcome treat. I highly recommend any hophead seek this beer out.,Russian River Brewing Company,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,100

Perfectly brewed DIPA that I feel has no real weakness unless you count the mild lingering aftertaste....though it is not unpleasant. Hoppy, fruity and nice lacing on the glass.

A lightly sweet, pale malt background sets the perfect background for the massive hop profile to do .The flavor is deliciously juicy, with bitter, resinous citrus and lemongrass hops,lightly toasted toffee and caramel malts,with a hint of honey. There's nothing overly complex going on, but it is so well blended it is incredible. Medium-full, smooth, slightly sticky body. This is so incredibly drinkable.

Having not heard of it yet I was somewhat reluctent to try.  Poured with a stong head that left lacing down the whole glass to the last sip.  The smell of hops was extiodinary! The taste is equally as amazing. No extreme bitterness, just good ole hop flavor. Slight sweetness that seemed to make it easy to drink.  I was surprised on the mounthfeel and drinkability. Much much lighter then I would have expected for a beer with this much flavor and 8% ABV. The first sip it almost felt watery but after drinking this I was glad it went down so easy. You could really concentrate on the flavor. I could easily put a few of these down in a session and enjoy every second.  Overall just an all around amazing beer.

863,7971,laituegonflable,4.34,"Pours an orangey amber colour with a thin, pockled off-white head. Not much carbonation, bit of a lacing cradle but slides quite steadily down the glass. A bit dull and lifeless-looking, really. Disappointing.  Holy shit that nose peels a layer of skin off your nose. I mean really, that smells like hop pellets smell. Very strong and herbacious with little else to it. I like it, not all that complex but impressive.  Wow, again intense hoppiness on the palate that's like rubbing basil leaves against the inside of your mouth. Intense hop hit - cascade maybe - on the front palate that is like a miniature Everest of hops rising on the flavour. Mid palate is a bit more mild with nice malty characters and it lingers for the back palate to create a delicious bittersweet finish. Palate is very well constructed to hit you hard with hops, then pull back to leave you with a very, very pleasant, satisfying aftertaste. Mouthfeel is smooth and basically, the more I drink, the more I want to drink. That finish is just immaculate, and the alcohol is hidden beautifully.  Delicious.

863,7971,JoshuaCain,4.61,"could not wait to finally try this brew. poured a golden and copper blond color with a great, frothy 2 finger head. aroma is like a botany lesson about hops, its citrusy and piney and grassy and exiting. the taste made me grin uncontrollably for about 5 minutes. a super hoppy but well balanced beer. its like an initial hop kick in the mouth, followed by a sweet and malty french kiss, finished with another hoppy slap to the jowls. but in an awesome way. grapefruit, pine, eucalyptus, peppery greens, pipe resin and baby tears are all present. feels nice but not outstanding. all in all a great beer, and a nice introduction to double IPA's, a style I have not had too much experience with. will drink many more very soon.",Russian River Brewing Company,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,100
863,7971,taylorhamrick,4.87,"Everybody wants to talk about hype. But open a bottle of this within a few miles of the conversations, and it's like...you were saying?  I don't know if I can write one of those reviews. I'm usually not very descriptive, at least not in the right sort of way. But I did have an experience. About the beer: It pours out a straw yellow color, with a bit of amber. Sometimes I like my IPAs a little more copper. It suggests that your skull might not be burned out by bitterness. There's quite a head, too. I remember one little cloud of bubbles that sat on top the entire time. I had a bit of lacing, but not the strata effect. The smell is hops. I mean, you open a bag of fresh hops and smell, that's what you get. What are the keywords: citrusy, piney, spicy, herbal, grassy? I have to use one of those right? It doesn't matter which I choose, insert one here: ___. Now forget about trying to describe the smell without smelling it. Can't be done. For those of you who aren't lucky enough to have one of these, sorry. Get one. The taste is as if someone made hop tea. Sort of. The smell matches the taste, and you could never get a better understanding of hop taste than in this beer. There isn't the incredible bitterness that people seem to expect from the style. There were finishing hops! And lots of dry hops! Almost all aroma and flavor, with the little kick of bitterness to remind you that it's a beer your drinking. Sweetness? You could try and find it, but why would you want to? This is what all other DIPAs should try to be. The mouthfeel, if you haven't gotten the picture yet, is just like a bouquet of hops, with a little bitterness. Easy enough. Of course I want another Pliny. Good thing I have one. I know I didn't give it a perfect score, and I don't expect to be able to power through a bunch of DIPAs in a night. Or even two. But I wish I could, and I know I couldn't do it with this either. I actually remember waking up in the middle of the night, and my tongue was numb. The hops had invaded, and I didn't want to taste anything else, ever. I think I'm okay now.  I know I didn't give it perfect 5s, and I doubt I will ever give anything such a rating. What can I say? But if aliens came to Earth and asked for the purpose of human life, I would give them a bottle of Pliny the Elder...Wait, if I had a bottle, I would probably bludgeon them to death with a nine iron, then drink it myself. But it's the thought that counts.",Russian River Brewing Company,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,100
863,7971,SaCkErZ9,4.98,"Thanks to 011x0110 for this wonderful beer via SS08.  Bottled on 100208.  Pours from a 550ml bottle into an imperial pint glass. Beer emerges a rather light colored, pale golden color with a small white head. Some good lacing going on while the head leaves fairly quickly. By the looks of this one, this might be awfully hoppy.  Aroma is pure hop goodness. Loads of grapefruit and lemon and even some grassa and a touch of piney goodness. The looks gave this one away. Without that caramel color, I had a feeling the hops would lead the show, and they do.  More hops in the flavor. This one has lots of hop flavor as well as some hop bitterness. Being a DIPA, the bitterness is kept well in check and the hop flavor seems to be the star of the show. Very grapefruity in flavor with some fresh squeezed orange juice as well.  Mouthfeel was a touch thin for me. This could be a perfect IPA but listed as a double IPA makes this one fall short a touch. I could easily drink this any day, all day. A hop lovers dream without the extreme bitterness.",Russian River Brewing Company,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,100
863,7971,jackorain,4.92,"I stopped by Alison's Two, a newer place by my office and saw they had PtE on tap, wow.  The bartender poured a perfect draft in a stemmed glass. The slightly cloudy liquid was yellow with a tinge of copper. The head was an egg shell color, near stark white. The head stayed around for quite a long time while I took the appearance notes. As it did fall it left gobs of sticky thick lace behind. The lacing effect was so interesting to look at, I didn't want to pick it and drink for fear of ruining the look. But alas...  The aroma was a big hop blast right up front. Huge grapefruit, pine and tangerine. The malts in the aroma take quite a back seat to the hop aromas but they are present in the form of caramel and biscuit.  On first sip, the hops come pouring through. On the front line are pine, white grapefruit, grapefruit zest (lots of it). The second line brings the tangerine and ruby red grapefruit. It is interesting that both the bittersweet white grapefruit and the sweet-bitter ruby red are easily discernable in the beginning and the middle, respectively. The malts are caramel and biscuit from the nose, but there is a bit of simple syrup that rounds out a semi-sweet malt profile. On the finish, the bitterness set in and lingers quite along time. It is not an overwhelming bitterness but one that is welcome and draws you in for the next sip.  Interestingly, the body of this beer is not as full as I would have thought. I would say it ahs a medium body, leaning a little to the lighter side. As it warmed, the body got even lighter. The carbonation is both lively and creamy at the same time. The finish is a touch astringent, leaving the pallet a little dry and a touch puckered. This is cured by another sip.  The drinkability is top notch for a DIPA. The 8% does not show itself and the beverage quaffs very easily. With an unlimited supply of both money and this beer...  This is one of the finest Double IPAs I have had.

863,7971,jjboesen,4.77,"This exquisite elixir honors the great philosopher who perished in the eruption of Mount Vesuvius. From this tragedy comes this delicious brew from Russian River. Well ... there really isn't a direct connection, is there?  But I was honored to pay homage to Pliny the Elder at the recent Oregon Brewers Fest, where the line for this was a long, but worthy, one.  It pours a thick head that dissipates into a lathery lacing with thick clingage. The beer is a light amber color with a reddish tinge. There are intense notes of banana and citrus, the latter being somewhat reminiscent of mandarin oranges. Add to this, the expected hop heaviness; however, there is some balance to the mix that makes for a very complex mouthfeel. You may need to adjust your palate to such effect.  I can't add much to what has been written by others. This is your basic desert island beer.

863,7971,LoRezDave,4.59,"Pulled the 500ml bottle out of the fridge, let it warm up 15min, then poured the first glass.  The appearance is a bright golden, with a impressive chill-haze that clears up once I get 1/2 way through the beer. Good beer lowers my threshold of patience. Medium tight head dissipates to about 1/2 finger that sticks around thanks to oily hop goodness... which also produces sticky lacing yum.  Aroma is a double-handful of complex hops. Not a slam, but a beautiful aroma. Resinous pine dominates with some florals in the middle.  Tast is suprisingly fruity. Believe me, plenty of hops on the front, but in the middle there lots of ripe pear and tangerine with more floral and resinous hops.  Mouthfeel is creamy and full and sweet/bitter hop aftertaste.  Absolutely delicious. Never had a better IPA in the bottle.",Russian River Brewing Company,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,100

The nose is of grapefruit, oranges and pine.... big hops :) The taste is very strong, especially the grapefruit hops flavor, and this beer does pocess a large malt base to be able counteract the massive ammount of hops. The mouthfeel is nice, a little undercarbonated in my opinion, but for such a huge DIPA the dry feeling afterwards is minimal.

863,7971,dsantos,5,"Wow, Happy Holidays to me. I got my hands on a bottle of Pliny the Elder this afternoon and decided today would be the day to review this exceptional brew.  A: Pours a golden orange. Not much suds, light head.  S : Definite pine smell, overpowering pine and hops.  T : Extremely smooth and full of hop. More than anything it is CRISP. Not thick, light with some carbonation but just amazingly smooth.  D : Easy to see why people rank it so high. Many of the reviews were right on. It is a highly drinkable beer, the alcohol does not hit you like other beers at this percentage. Great 2IPA. Very deserving of it's high status!  Fantastic beer, so good my friend and I cracked into another bottle this evening because it was so impressive (also deserving of one of my first reviews).  Can't wait to have Pliny the Younger, if I can find it.",Russian River Brewing Company,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,100
863,7971,LilMatrix,5,"A - Pours clear and light gold/orange with some nice lacing that sticks around for the entire ride.  S - Piney, citrus/grapefruit, floral & hoppy. Smells like one would after frolicking in a field of hops.  T - First taste is hoptastic... goes down smooth and gets even better once the palate adjusts to the hops; light malt sweetness starts coming through. Every sip is more enjoyable than the one before and dissipates in the mouth into a refreshing clean hop taste.  M - Great mouthfeel on this one... Crisp and light going down with medium carbonation and effervescence.  D - Zoinks scoob... this is one tasty beer. 8% you say? Blasphemy! Usually I can't drink but 2-3 IPA's since my palate gets overwhelmed and I'm left with a dry hoppy taste in the back of my throut... but this one... I could drink Pliny all night.

863,7971,TexIndy,4.5,"Shipped back from Denver during my trip. Poured from a 500ml bottle (bottled on date on label) into a pint glass. It was a hazy golden yellow color with a ton of yeast floaters. Almost no carbonation but great lacing. It had a finger of white head that slowly settled into a foam and collar.  The aroma was major league hops. Floral, citrus and quite a bit of pine. Didn't get the grapefruit that others mentioned. Fantastic aroma. You can tell this one going to be a tongue shredder. And it was. Amazing hop bite. Starts out slowly at first and then bam the hops hit the back and sides of the tongue. No mercy given. Great balance as it has the hop bomb hit but doesn't cross the line into overly hopped. Mouthfeel is great.  Overall, an excellent beer that I finally got to try. Well worth the hype and the high ranking. Highly, highly recommend.

The color is a light orange/tan when light passes through (I usually prefer a slightly darker color for a double-IPA). The taste is amazing, hops are perfectly balanced and the malts are very present despite its lighter color. Its hard to tell if there is a dominant hop flavor (citrus, pine, melon...), but overall the hoppiness is very pleasant. The alcohol is not noticeable on the palate but after awhile the stomach begins to warm up. The beer has a good amount of carbonation. The drinkability is high if you are a hop-head otherwise it may be difficult to drink.

Probably the Best IPA I've drank ever. Some others were close, but not lick this one. No big bite, or over bitterness or sour tasting. Just a soft pleasant taste of hops, with hints of some candied citrus.",Russian River Brewing Company,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,100

863,7971,Finkel,4.83,"I got extremely lucky that I found this; I love my beer geek friends and their ability to start a phone chain. Served on tap at Mad Mex in West Philadelphia.  Served in a snifter, it looked really nice. Golden, pale color with a thin, but frothy looking head. Lace surrounded the entire glass as it went down - absolutely gorgeous.  The smell was an orgy of hops. However, I don't know what hops they use other than a ton of 'em. As a hop head, I was excited as hell to finally have this in a glass in my hand. I've heard only good things of this IPA, my favorite style.  The taste was superb. This beer is EXTREMELY hoppy, which even blew my mind. If you're not a big hop person, I wouldn't waste your time with this. However, if you do, this is a punch in the face and I was freaking out at how good it was. I had heard this was one of the best IPAs; it deserved ALL of the hype it's been given.  The mouthfeel was very nice as well. Although it was on the thinner side, as I swooshed it around in my mouth, it actually became a bit creamy, which was surprising.  Although this is an IPA, I found it to be extremely drinkable. I only had two of them (yay for $3/glass) but I was hit hard by the ABV. Due to this, I found myself wanting to have a few more, especially at such dirt cheap, generous price. However, I controlled myself as it was only 7 PM.  Very complex beer and very mind blowing. This is definitely the best IPA I can remember having.

863,7971,HoustonTX,5,"Pliny the Elder, an especially great honor for my 300th review.  Pliny the Elder pours out beautiful transcending orange, with streams of refined carbonation, and a small frothy head.  The aroma is extremely fresh, and covered with that good ole West Coast IPA familiarity. Lots of Columbus, Centennials, and Warrior hops to provide a nice barrage of citrusy derivatives. Dank and resinous, almost leaving your nasals dripping with ripe hop oil. Lots of alpha acids, but also an extreme balance - overall a very intense aroma.  At first sip, I muttered ""I'm in love"". Yes I am, I thought to myself quietly.  The complexity of the hops is absolutely astounding. Incredible depth of intensely fresh bittering dry citric hops, fresh florals, and resinous pines and spiciness.  The citrus hits the palate first, clean florals surround, followed by resinous piney bitters. Grapefruit rinds, acidic orange peels. Deep aromatic florals with a flowery pepper spice profile. More pine and resinous sap with a biscuit malt coating. The pepper and spicy underlays blend perfectly with the citrus and pine notes. Creating such a refined, complex, yet balanced DIPA, that words almost can't describe.  Silky smooth mouthfeel, and just a phenomenal balance. The complexity of Pliny the Elder, is just absolutely mind blowing. This beer has lived up to the hype and surpassed. A West Coast masterpiece, heavenly and divine.

863,7971,lynx1245,4.68,"Appearance: Pours golden with light cloudy sediment that clears quickly. White head recedes quickly into large bubbles floating on top of the golden sea. There actually was some lacing submerged in the liquid - never seen that before! I love how the head dances around as you swirl the beer in the cup.  Smell: Wow! This has an INTENSE smell. I could smell some orange peel in the background but what really sticks out is the smell of weed. Only a day before I tried Pliny I actually tried a homebrew that I later found out was infused with marijuana. There is no doubt, Pliny has the exact same smell! I guess that's what fresh hops smell like... (or maybe its another secret ingredient).  Taste: Unlike the weed beer I tasted, this beer was excellent. Pine, big hops, grapefruit, malts. This has it all! There was still a slight hint of mary jane but that might have just been the smell that greeted me with every sip.  Mouthfeel: Nicely carbonated. Very smooth and dry finish. Definitely just feels green and clean.  Drinkability: One is not enough! I need more more more!

Nice 1"" head.. eggshell white with alot of lace and stuck around forever.. brew is only slightly hop hazed golden straw.  Nose is wonderfully fruity hoppiness.. citrus.. pine.. pineapple.. you name it.. reminds me of Flintstone Vitamins my mom made me take as a kid..  Flavor is a huge fresh hop smack in the tongue.. not nearly as bitter as expected.. very balanced with an obvious battering ram toward the hop flavors.. minerally and fruity hops.. pine and grapefruit zest without a bit of pith.. finish is looong and fruity... I am not gonna lie and try to pick out all the supposed maltiness.. there is just enough maltiness and no real sweetness .. but the malts that are there are just enough to push forward an incredibly balanced brew... I love it.. I reallly love it. If I had access, there is no doubt.. I would stock up every shipment and this would be a fridge staple in the front of the pack... and Vinnie and crew would never ever have to worry about any bottles being ""aged"".

863,7971,jpiper,4.75,"Pours a wonderful orangish-yellow with a thick head which is retained for quite some time. Pillowy off-white head which leaves foamy rings as the beer is enjoyed.  The aroma is amazing - so much floral hops. Some fruit, but its dominated by the hop profile.  The flavor too is very hoppy and floral with just enough malt backbone which is in no way sweet... seems to be there just to balance. As the flavor dissipates, the bitterness catches up - it's there, but not dominant. There is citrus fruit on the palate as well it lasts all the way through. It makes the bitter end taste like grapefruit rind/pith. A very clean, balanced flavor.  The beer is well carbonated and very clean feeling. So much of the carbonation is used to build the head, but there is enough remaining.  This is an incredibly drinkable beer. It's quite enjoyable after a day's work in the yard, and it's perfect for an introspective evening of beer enjoyment. Right now, I'm enjoying it as a session beer during the Brown's game.  I'm lucky to have picked a case of this up while in the Bay area a few weeks ago. I'm keeping it cold and enjoying it this winter.

863,7971,csmiley,4.18,"A - This one pours a darker color of gold with some orange highlights. The white head topped out at just under half inch and ends up a white / orange cap after a minute or two. Lacing remains very nice for the duration of the brew.  S - Hops are dominant and have both citric and pine qualities. Seems to lean a little more toward pine. Citrus is bitter like grapefruit. Some sweet sugary aromas round it out and I swear I got a hint of cookie dough. Alcohol is barely noticeable through the hops.  T - Citrus starts it out with hints of orange, grapefruit, and mango. Hints of pine sap and grass quickly follow the fruitiness. Some sweeter flavors linger briefly (hard candy and syrup) before giving way to a wall of bitterness and alcohol. That is pretty much it for the flavor. Good, but I was expecting more.  M - Medium bodied with a carbonation level that works well. Smooth overall with a long, dry, bitter finish.  D - This one is very easy to drink. The alcohol does not get in the way at all. Once the taste buds are destroyed by the bitterness it just starts drinking very smooth for the style. I would gladly have another one of these brews. Russian River has brewed a very nice beer in the Pliny the Elder.

863,7971,beerhappy,4.63,"So... here we go with the Lafite Rothschild of the DIPA style (according the fanfare surrounding this beer). Purchased 2 bottles from Hi Time in OC. Both were bottled on 10/2/08 making each 64 days old when consumed. The bottles not only contain a freshness date but also encouragemnet to drink the beer before it turns: ""respect your elder: keep cold, drink fresh, do not age! Pliny the Elder is a historical figure, don't make the beer inside this bottle one!"" and so on...  Opened the first bottle and I suspect that something went awry with this particular bottle during the bottling process because not only did I not get any ""pffft"" sound upon application of my trustworthy opening device, but absolutely no head either (on a rather strong pour). This circumstance did not deter me though... & all I can say is WOW!! this beer, even though apparently succumbing to some oxidation, still smells... wonderful! Unbelievable! I was expecting the worst and Pliny delivered an explosion of hoppy, citrusy, piney goodness! Mindjarring! in a ""bad"" bottle... really?  The wonderful flavor is an extension of what the nose had originally suggested... I'm not quite sure what kind of hops the brewer used here as I'm not well versed on that sort of thing, but it seems to be a superior quality of hops, or perhaps, just a superior brewing method than most other craft brewers are offering. Grapefruit, citrus... bitter and sweet in perfect combination.  The second bottle was opened with a familiar sound and it seems to have not suffered the same fate as the first. The pour contains a wonderful head that perfumes my senses immediately, from a distance, with the same wonderful smell that the first bottle had provided only at close range except a bit more pine. The taste is the same barage of hop wizardry.

863,7971,coldmeat23,4.79,"GLASS: Over-sized Wine Glass TEMP: Cellared @ approx 45 degrees Fresh Vintage (11/04/08 Bottling Date) Thanks to RodBurg for this one!  Nice, clear, golden honey color. Small one-finger head of white foam. Minimal retention. Decent lacing, slightly better then minimal.  Okay, I've not detected hops 'evil' cousin in the nose of a beer before, but this one is it. This smells like some mighty fine weed! If I thought that I could dry this out and smoke it, I'd try to. Very 'green' and earthy smelling. Pine resin and grapefruit, with a hint of citrus, mostly orange. Nice floral presence. This has got to be one of the best/nicest smelling DIPA/IIPA's that I've ever had.  Wow, the taste is much smoother than expected. Based on the hype and the nose, I expected to pucker-up with this one. Not the case, at all. Very nice citrus/floral balance, here. Sure, there are a ton of hops in this. There is also a nice balance provided by a nice bed of dry malt flavor. A good grapefruit showing mixed with tangerine sweetness and the zest of pine needles. A good counter balance of caramel malt sweetness. Excellent balance. No bitterness, no over-the-top sweetness.  Very nice. Truly a crisp, clean brew. Light and refreshing. Just slightly too thin for me to rate it a 'perfect' 5.0, though. 4.5 is pretty close.  I could drink this by the barrel-full. Although, I'd probably choose something that was bigger, thicker, and maltier. That's the only reason it misses the 5.0 rating on drinkability. Just personal preference.

863,7971,Douglas14,5,"This is like a religious experience. It's one of those beers that you drink and you get thrown back in your chair in awe and say ""Holy shit!"" because you didn't know you could still be impressed this much by a beer. It only happens every-so-often, and it is no doubt what I equate into a ""leveling-up"" in your beer enlightenment...the way you just thought about beer just changed (hopefully again), and it hit you HARD! I live for moments like these with beer.  On to the review...  Pours an golden color with immaculate clarity. The head is full, thick, white, and absolutely beautiful. The retention is incredible and it leaves awesome and plentiful lace. The aroma is phenomenal; it's super hoppy (obviously), but it's like no other hop aroma you have experienced. A tad but of resin, some pine, some outdoors. Nothing hidden and perfectly balanced. As for the taste...where do I begin. The only way I can describe the taste is that it is the most perfectly balanced DIPA (or even IPA) I have ever had. I'm in awe in the of the hop utilization in this beer: the best I've experienced...I don't know how they did it...simply awesome. The mouthfeel is ridiculously awesome. To say I could drink this all day long is a gross understatement.  Do whatever it takes to get your hands on a bottle.  For your own good, if you are going to trade for it, get it from someone who can get it close by to the source so they can send you a fresh bottle.

863,7971,mynie,4.72,"Half liter bottle dated 2-25-08.  Pours firm, nicely unfiltered and hazy with a big, soapy white head. Very nice pour for a Double IPA.  Smells very nicely hoppy even 9 months after its bottling date. Huge hop complexity, no off nodes, no sense of it being excessive for the sake of being excessive, nice sweet malt backbone. Wonderful palette, wonderful balance.  Tastes nearly as good as it smells. Starts off with a strong balance between the bittersweet, dry malt and the citrusy, piney hop profile. Malt is pleasantly buttery, not like diacetyl, more like a Ritz cracker. Really nice, and it's its unique malt profile--not, surprisingly, an especially complex hop profile--that makes it so tasty.  Very big, bitter hopGoes down remarkably smooth, considering all the hops and alcohol.",Russian River Brewing Company,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,100
863,7971,dondeez21,5,I received bottles from 2 different trades w/ JamesCrames and Bbothen and was blown away. This is one of the few beers to truly live up to all of the hype. The appearence is a light golden yellow with a very nice thin lacing. The aroama hits you as soon as you open a bottle. Citrus hops can be smelled from a few feet away. The first sip is truly amazing. With so much hop aroama you would think the beer would be way to bitter. It is the total opposite. This beer is extremely balanced with just the right amount of bitterness. Overall I think this is one of the best beers I have ever had the chance to drink and would recommend it to anyone even people who wouldnt consider themselves hopheads.,Russian River Brewing Company,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,100
863,7971,JeffV,3.99,"It poured a light gold color with a slight tint of red. It was not the color of IPAs and other typically hoppy beers. The head was not especially thick and was characterized by big bubbles. Despite the thin head it was very active in the glass and it retained its head nicely. It had great lacing.  It smelled exactly how I imagined. Hops, flowers grapefruit, pine.  Nice and bitter taste. Floral notes and piny bitterness.  This is no session beer but it is relatively drinkable. It is surprisingly light on the palate and it was legitimately fun to drink.  A pleasurable beer but I must say; What is all the fuss about? It is just one one many hoppy, fun beers.",Russian River Brewing Company,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,100
863,7971,MrFootstones,4.8,"I've had this many times, from a bottle, growler, and on tap.  Pliny pours a golden amber color, with the richest looking head I remember seeing. Very creamy and robust, that is. Not thin or quick to dissipate. Lacing all the way down the pint glass.  The smell is heavenly, what I imagine pure hop extract would smell like. Citrusy, very floral, but not stinging. Even my dad who doesn't drink though it smelled good.  The taste is of course also phenomenal. Along with all the typical hop characteristics of resiny pineyness, citrus, and flowers, I notice for lack of a better word, a very rounded taste, almost reminiscent of cantaloupe or honeydew melon. Despite being so heavily hopped, it is not bitter at all. There is no acrid taste here, and no malty sweetness, pure unbridled hops.  The mouthfeel is nice. It is very luscious and rich. This is where the creamy head comes from. It coats the palate in the most velvety way, and has just the right amount of carbonation to round it out.  Drinkability is pretty good. This is my favorite D/IPA. Period. I must say though that I would never want more than a pint at once. This is a great pleasure to drink but it is no session beer.  When I first went to Russian River, I wanted to try a barrel aged beer or The Younger, but there were none of those to be found. A local said ""Get the Elder, you won't be disappointed!"" Well there began my love affair with Pliny the Elder, hands down my favorite hoppy beer I have tried.",Russian River Brewing Company,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,100
863,7971,Dukeofearl,5,"500 ml bottle from La Bodega in Riverside, CA., $5.99 a bottle (I think).  Let me say this one is not getting my standard review of the 5 elements of a BA beer review. It's too good for that.  This is just one of a few classic, exceptional, first rate beers of the world. I think this is the archetypal American Double (or Imperial) IPA, period. Lots of hops with a great perfumy citrus nose (grapefruit and sweet orange) while refusing to be overpowering, great body without being too big, flavor in every direction without being confusing, and huge drinkability even for its appreciable alcohol content. This is one of my top 5 of all time.  I know it now comes from northern California, but this style started in Riverside County, and for that we shoud all be grateful. Cheers to a great beer.",Russian River Brewing Company,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,100
863,7971,LunaChick,4.11,"3 servings now--3 different meals. Pliny: You nail it on the nose. I've been on a mission to taste as many IPA's as possible to find out what it is about you that everyone loves so much. Are you a good DIPA? sure Are you better than most? absolutely Are you the best of the best? No.  You appear as most west coast IPA's. Crisp amber. Thin head. Faint lacing in the glass. Its the nose, my friend, the nose. A wash of amazing citrus and floral hops. I'm sitting in a grassy field with cute fuzzy animals dancing around me. Your aromoa is fresh and bright. I can smell you in my sleep. If only...your taste is typical of a west coast brew. A burst of fresh citrus and pine followed by a lingering astringency that makes me want 3 glasses of water. An hour later and I can still feel the subtle puck in in back of my throat. What makes you different? A very refreshing burst of hops that is mellowed only so slightly by a quiet malt body. No buscuit. No bread. No syrupy sweet. But there, in the finish. There it is. The alcohol. Boom! It warms my throat and will not leave. Yes, Pliny. I can taste your alcohol. Is your flavor unique? No. No my friend. You are not so special that nothing else compares. You are great. But there are others. In my mouth a subtle balance. Crisp carbonation? yes. Too much? No. A lingering bitterness and alcohol warmth are your downfall. More than an hour now and you linger. Like a date that needs to end. I do not want another. Pliny: You nail it on the nose. Few, maybe only one, can exceed the magical aroma. Everything else? Smell is the strongest sense tied to memory.

863,7971,chaz410,4.32,"I had this at a friends place, lets just say I was a little excited to try it. The nose on this beer was very sweet and hinted with hops and wheat notes. It is obvious both in taste and smell that hops are the main flavoring but there's a complexity to the hops that you don't find in many IPAs. The tast is very hoppy but mostly sweet and citrus flavors integrated. It has some bittering notes but just during the swallow, not at the end where IPAs usually get bitter. The mouthfeel is smooth and refreshing. Easily one of the best Double IPAs I've had, I highly recommend it.",Russian River Brewing Company,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,100

The taste of this beer is what should be expected of any great IPA. As mentioned in countless reviews, this is a very well balanced beer.  mouthfeel is good, creamy, slightly wet on the palate. very nice.  deadly drinkable, cant set this one down. i love IPA's, and this one is pure heaven.  well, there you have it. one bottle of pliny the elder down, and one review in the can. next i'm going to make a black and tan with the remaining bottle of pliny and an Old Rasputin i had laying around. wish me luck.",Russian River Brewing Company,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,100

Pliny the Elder gives a wonderful citrus/grapefruit finish, and in addition to lots and lots of hops, has a good balance of malt.  Talking Bob said, ""One of the most-balanced double IPAs I've ever tasted.""  Russian River stresses that this beer should be consumed fresh.

The nose alerts me this is going to be one wild ride right off the bat...strong citrus with a hint of the bitterness that will balance it out. The Pliny coats my tongue in a complex way setting off taste buds on both the bitterness and citrus areas....a light grassy finish with a balanced hop oil residue on the sides of my mouth.

863,7971,RunDWP,4.42,"Having heard all the raves for this beer, and never had tried it, I was expecting a let down, since it would be hard for this beer to live up to all the hype. To my pleasant surprise, it did.  I don't have a strong nose, but the moment I opened the bottle, I was hit by an orange, citrus aroma with a little pine in it. The 500 ml bottle filled up a tulip glass with a light orange brew, with a centimeter or two of solid foam, which gently clung to the glass as I sipped. It's pretty amazing how this much bitterness tasted this smooth. The flavor had orange and grapefruit citrus character, as well as a note of cream, with a stong bitterness that was smooth and refreshing, rather than simply punching me in the mouth. Mouthfeel was creamy as well. Surprised that at 8%, I really couldn't taste the alcohol. Interestingly enough, as it warmed, it didn't change in it taste profile as a lot of beers do.

The aroma is relatively strong with loads of citrus (mostly grapefruit and some orange) and a big dose of sweet cotton candy. The taste is more of the same with accent on the citrus, plus biter hops followed by cotton candy on the side and back of the tounge. The mouthfeel is medium malty with a crisp note and the carbonation is lively. The finish is long with biter-sweet hops. This is one of the great IPA's, I'm glad I can get it locally.

Prior to this experience I was not a fan of IPAs/DIPAs, but Pliny has converted me. I loved this brew. The malt provided a good balance to the hops especially as the beer warmed.

863,7971,dalion037,4.6,I finally got a chance to try this IIPA. The offering was a pint on tap. The beer was a nice golden color with a nice silky taste.

Thick pine and suttle citrus in the aroma, very very pleasant and quite big, actually suprised me a little that as soon as I cracked the bottle I got hit by a wave of pine.  Very complex flavor on this beer, balancing citrusy bitterness, pine flavors, all with a nice malt background, a slight carbonic bite on the sides of the tongue. Alot going on in this beer.

863,7971,jeffthecheff,4.94,"Color was good with a golden amber. Tried pouring an aggressive head but it wouldn't keep for long.  The aroma from this beer is perfect. No beer of this style has come close to this. The aroma is all in the hops. Strong pine aroma, with some fruitiness that resembled apricots. Not only did it deliver is quality of aroma...but this was a huge bouquet that no other beer can match.  This beer had the best hop flavor as any beer I've had...with some malt in it to add complexity. The first taste will match what you smell, which is inevitable given the strong aroma. I put this under my tongue to get the caramel malt flavor which was very complex for an IPA. The hop flavor is so complex in here, you can set your mind to taste whatever you want. Pine, citrus, apricot...these are some things I tasted, but if you read anybody's review, there will be more flavors found and they are all there if you look for them. Amazing. The bitterness is light if you want it to be but strong if you focus on it. I bet someone that doesn't like a lot of bitter beers can appreciate this.  Mouthfeel and drinkability both get 5's when style is taken into consideration. This is a IIPA, but the bitterness won't make you pucker your mouth, and you will want more after each sip. Most IIPA's would have to be considered strictly ""sippers"" that must be nursed, but this can be drank in the same way an IPA would.",Russian River Brewing Company,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,100

The pour was nice with the only problem being an overflow from the bottle when I first opened it. Poured a nice slightly hazy yellow/copper color. Minimal head and medium lacing.  The smell jumps out at you. Almost an orange rind component and maybe some telltale grapefruit aromas as well.  The taste is awesome. Slightly sweet and creamy malt character. Nice bittering hops character as well. Nice crisp hops aspect. The citrus carries over into the taste as well if ever so slightly.  Wonderful mouthfeel! Not very heavy and a nice amount of carbonation. It was a pleasure to drink. Wish I had more than 1 left...guess I better head back to Denver to get more!  Drinkability is VERY good.

Aromas of peaches, piney hoppy goodness, light citrus, banana. Very refined nose.  Tastes like winning! Starts out with a crisp hoppy flavor, mid-palette goes to tropical fruits (pineapple!) but finishes with the hops again: zingy and spicy with a great malty finish.  Mouthfeel has many trends: Begins with sharp hops, mellows out in the middle, ends with some more acid, then dissipates into a sweet finish.  As drinkable s any I've ever had.

S- Pine upfront, slightly dank and almost cheesey, followed by slight citrus notes, and more exotic fruit; such as pineapple and pomello. Biscuit lingers in the background but is really an after thought comparatively. One word that describes this aroma is - intense.  T- Sort of a let down from the aroma.  It still assaults the palate with hops. Very resinous, and once again dank. The malt shows itself more in taste than aroma with a grainy and biscuity note in the middle and towards the finish, but is still subdued. The exotic fruits show themselves slightly at end, in the form of citron and lemon pith. When slurped the alcohol is present.  M- Oily, Resinous, and definitely numbing. My taste-buds are scourched and will be for some time, (CAUTION: If your not into: sick, nasty, over-the-top, circus-freak-like hop intensity+dryness this is not the beer for you.)  and thats the way I like it.

Thick sticky globs of bubbly lace line the glass walls.  Aroma is intensly grassy hops with wiffs of pine and spice. Malt backing up the hops in a sweet carmelly aroma. Hints of somokey tobacco, fresh cut hay, hemp and more hops! Yum.  Wow, this is good. Great hop balance with malty sweetness. Upfront is smooth mild carbonation. Sweet buttery caramel, with spicie peppery flavors. Hops are almost chewy, so thick and delicious, with an oily slick texture.

A thin soapy head of white doesn't really amount to much but does leave some solid filmy walls of lace around most of the pint glass.  Aroma - some light grapefruit rind and a major pine smell are pretty much what this aroma is all about. Has that BO-ish kind of bend but it is an intense hop experience.  Taste - a light biscuity caramel with a quickly engulfing citrusy flavor of juicy pink grapefruit. Fleshy, flavorful, very citrusy, awesome hop character. The swallow begins immediate drying with the bitterness just edging out in front. Fantastic intensity without the medicinals that are so often associated with hoppiness on this level.

The hops aren't all that overwhelming either just a nice full grapefruit flavor and a bit of pineyness.  Rather full creamy body, medium light carbonation and some light astringence  I was expecting this beer to excel in a different way. I figured that all of its flavors would be extremely out there. Instead this is a full and balanced IPA. Sure you can call it an imperial, sure you can say it's a double. In fact that is a more fair statement with this beer then most double IPAs that are more like extremely hoppy barleywines or just retarded hoppy beers period. This beer is obviously an IPA it is an IPA first and a double or imperial second.

Initial hoppy nose is followed by some mild sweet bready malts. Impressive balance up front.  T - Piney hops on the open. Transitions to some tropical fruits (pineapple, grapefruit, mango). Sweet citrus through the finish. Very clean. Delicous.  M - Medium bodied. A bit on the lighter side for a DIPA, actually, but not light overall. Moderate carbonation allows this silky smooth beer to just glide over the tongue. Very smooth, creamy even. A bit of hoppy resin on the finish. Nicely dry. No alcohol at all.

Pliny the Elder lives up to it's reputation. I would have NEVER guessed it was an 8% ABV. And a fresh Hob bomb.... Just awesome. Definitely not a beer living just off reputation. This is the real deal. One I wish I could drink all the time.  The beer was a light gold and very translucent. Very little head.  Aroma was unreal. Like holding a bouquet of flowers. So fresh, perfume like and full of citrus notes. One of the greatest smelling beers I've ever seen.  Flavor was so awesome and well balanced. So much hop flavor yet still a smooth and balanced tone from front to back. Pine, citrus, Pine, citrus.  Mouth feel was a little lighter than I had expected. It's bigger than most IPA's but a bit lighter than most DPA's Definitely lighter and color and feel.  Just an unreal beer. Definitely goes into my top 10.

The hops are the star of the show, here, but overall it's a wonderful mix of bitterness and sweetness. To speak in terms of literature, it is the greatest example of unity in the taste of an IPA i've had. It tastes like an IPA should.  M- Clean as hell, but perhaps a bit thin.

Very palatable, tastes much the same way it smells with pine/citrus-tasting hops dominating. Not the greatest finish, and it's best not to let it sit around as the bitterness gets worse. It took me a while to finish and the last bit was much less drinkable than at the beginning. Alcohol not hidden incredibly well.  Overall - A very nice, approachable IPA. It's hard to believe it's a double/imperial IPA since it went down easier than most ""regular"" IPAs I've had. Good introduction to the style.",Russian River Brewing Company,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,100
863,7971,Spikester,4.64,Pours amber with a sizable head and very good lacings. Aroma is strong floral resinous hops. Taste is very powerful bitter citrus orange grapefruit hops. Just enough sweet malts to tame the beast. The resins coat the tongue so tasting any other beer afterwards would be difficult. Unless it is another Pliny. The only drawback to this beer is a smaller than normal bomber size. 16.9 ounces. But as a special brew I give it a big thumbs up!,Russian River Brewing Company,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,100
863,7971,hwwty4,3.7,"Thanks to Julian for this one.  This is about my 3rd go around with this beer and now I'll finally get around to reviewing it. Poured a 16.9oz bottle into my Tripel Karmeliet glass. This beer pours a translucent shade of light copper with sticky lacing all the way down the glass. The aroma is like a cut fresh pine tree mixed with tangerines and just a slight bit of malty sweetness. The taste is a full frontal assault with a pine branch. The piney notes are really an affront to the palate but the strange thing is it finishes really watery. I figured there would be a bigger bang at the end. The mouthfeel is a bit boozy and astringent but it does create a nice piney mouth coating. This is a good beer, but honestly, I think its kind of a product of the hype machine.",Russian River Brewing Company,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,100
863,7971,charlzm,3.98,"Consumed 11/07/08. Bottle labeled, ""Bottled on 092208"".  Beer pours a light honey tinted gold with a frothy, two-finger off-white head that soon settles to a fine froth. Copious lacing. Little active carbonation.  Very aromatic beer: piney hops. Sweet. Trace of peppery character as well.  Slightly slick, slightly thick texture.  Flavor is strong, but balanced. Some caramel and/or crystal malt segues smoothly into a citrus medley (bitter orange, lemon, lime, grapefruit), some pine and slightly floral hop finish. Bitterness is present and somewhat muted, establishing a sort of flavor floor or background of slightly hot, peppery bitterness that hovers at the edge of perception at all times.  You MUST be a hophead to truly enjoy this beer. It is well-executed and bold, but I personally find it overbearingly hoppy.",Russian River Brewing Company,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,100

You sit in my tulip glass with a nice thick mat of fine bubbles atop your hazey coper self. Though your hops have faded some, they still dominate the aroma with a slight hint of alcohol.

Poured a translucent orange-gold with a half inch frothy, off-white cap embedded with copious tiny ringlets; some tiny bubbles also present in solution. Head dissipated into a soapy skim in the center with a band of ringlets that coalesced around the edges; some spatters of lacing present during the tasting. Nose off the cap was sweet grapefruit and a little bit of piney hops. Flavors were much more balanced; not overly sweet not overly bitter; a residual aftertaste lightly lingered between quaffs. Mouthfeel fell between light and medium with a mild effervescence consistent throughout. Easy drinking with a well-hidden abv. I'm not really an IPA fan, but I'm really starting to dig DIPAs.

Bold citrus hops with tons of fresh green grass, spice, and marijuana.  T: Hops to the Maxxx. The taste marries the nose in such a wonderful way which is so wonderful if you are a hophead. Bold grassy hops with fresh citrus. This one can give you bitter beer face in such a good way.  M: Bold carbonation really carries the flavor clear into the throat.

A nice white head that fell very quickly to form some patchy head around the edges.  S: Smelled it as soon as the cap was cracked. Hop assault. I actually considered pressing charges but it's not rape if I'm asking for it.  T: The hop taste is raw but the bitterness is within limits (my limits at least). A ton of sticky pine right up front but the lack of an overwhelming bitterness makes it entirely delicious. There is a good amount of sweetness that in the aftertaste although that might be my perception of the hops.  M: Only medium bodied in spite of the boldness of the hops. Very nice.

863,7971,wagenvolks,4.47,"500 ml bottle (9/22/08 bottling) into a pint glass.  Pours an attractive, straw-golden hue with a two finger's width of off-white head that sticks around for a minute or so, leaving some sticky rings of lacing on the glass as the level drops. The aroma is heavenly, and much cleaner than many IIPA's I've encountered, with the hops coming off as green & juicy. Light citrus and floral hop qualities are also present, and the maltiness is soft, sweet, and clean.  All other amazing qualities aside, Pliny the Elder is one of the most crisp, refreshing, and easy-to-drink IIPA's out there. The hoppiness is in-your-face with bitter pine, fresh greenery, and floral bursts; however, it never gets too resiny or overly bitter. Plus, the malts provide a beautiful balance of light biscuit and caramel that neither cloys in its sweetness, nor outshines the hop character. Mouthfeel is crisp, perfectly carbonated, and refreshing, with a medium body and lingering hoppy bite. The alcohol is almost undetectable, and I kind of like it that way. Although the Elder came across more like a single IPA than an imperial one, I didn't mind. The hops were well-utilized and the drinkability was top-notch. Does it belong in the top 10? Maybe... Is it a fantastic brew deserving of any hop-head's palate? Absolutely.",Russian River Brewing Company,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,100

Aromas are bold and in your face with spritey, juicy, tangy hops. The flavor followed suit with great balance with the hops and malt body playing in excellent concert with one another. The alcohol is very well hidden here. The finish is dry. The sweet malty backbone and hoppy bitterness leaving something of a twang on the palate.

863,7971,rxdrewthejew,4.65,"I've had this a few times before on tap, but always after drinking something else...so not sure if those tastings really did it justice. But today I had a plan to find some at Beverage Warehouse...and they actually had it! And to celebrate my fortuitous find...I am going to drink it. Sweet. Poured into my nonic which was just the right size for the whole pint and a bit.  A: Yellowish orange and fairly clear. It's a bit hazy I guess...you can't see through it. Not much head, I got about one finger of whitish head that quickly faded. Very nice lacing on the sides though. Just a typical looking IIPA.  S: The smell is almost all hops, strongly citrus and floral. There is a bit of sweetness, but I think that's from the floral hops more than anything else.  T: Opening has a touch of sweetness that I would describe as orangey, but I wonder if it's just a little hop sweetness. The hop character is mostly floral to me with a bit of grapefruit. The sweet citrus flavor is present throughout and gives a nice balance.  MF: Medium bodied, a bit syrupy. Carbonation is there but it's pretty low. Hops are a bit astrigent but not as much as some others. Finish is quite wet, aside from a bit of dryness from the hops. This is a beer that you want to sip and savor, but the feel makes it easy to glug.  D: The drinkability of this beer is sickening. The balance of flavors is just superb. There's really no telling where the malt ends and the hops begin, which I feel is pretty rare for this style. And yet I don't feel like the hops are toned down...no question this pleases the hop head in me. The alcohol is not particularly high for a DIPA, either, so a couple pints of this wouldn't be out of the question. This is truly a beer that lives up to the hype, and truly one of the best in the style. I am thrilled beyond words that they're actually bottling and distributing this widely enough that I can pick it up in LA.",Russian River Brewing Company,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,100
863,7971,akorsak,4.32,"Thanks to FrancisWeizen for this extra in a recent trade.  A: The ale is a copper color, a shiny penny. The ale is clear and has a lighter orange-yellow color at the narrower parts of the glass. The ale is amply carbonated, coating the sides of the glass with thick foam.  S: The nose is loaded with hops, thick and resiny. Pine and grapefruit notes dominate, sickly sweet with a hint of tree. Not much balance, malt-wise though.  T: The first sip reminded me of how delicious this ale is. The hops are blindingly bitter, sweet with grapefruit and citrus notes. A floral, herbal flavor, hop-driven, adds a unique sweetness to the ale. The ale is quite fragrant, loaded with hops and not ashamed about it. The caramel malts are most evident in the aftertaste, adding a graininess that mixes nicely with the hops.  M: The mouthfeel is plucky, deceptive and enjoyable. The hop profile is the star of the ale.  D: The 8% alcohol is hidden behind the Spector-esque wall of hops. A masterpiece.",Russian River Brewing Company,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,100

T - Piney hops with tropical fruits, slight herbal resin, sweet bready malt followed by citrus rind and a linger piney herbal hoppiness. Amazing how hoppy yet balanced this is.  M - Smooth and creamy, medium mouthfeel due to the resiny hops and a dry lingering bitterness. The alcohol is not even noticeable.  D - I have brewed the homebrew recipe Vinnie has given out over the years and it is damn close but the real thing is so much smoother. This beer proves to me that my favorite IPA's focus on later addition hops creating a nice balance without the complete mouth puckering bitterness.

863,7971,travloh,4.67,"Pop the top and the smell of hops springs forth. Smells delicious with the sharp, biting bitterness of citrus, pine. Oh so aromatic.  Pour into Sam Adams beer glass reveals a golden elixir, ever so slight orange tint, but surprisingly light in color. Lots of chunkies floating around. Pretty decent 3 finger head that slowly fades and leaves creamy laciness down the sides of the glass. As the foam dissipates it gets ever so creamy looking. Wow.  The first taste is of course dominated by the hop character. There are IPAs and there are IPAs that have this character. This is surely one of the best. Has that telltale bitterness of course, but just when you think its overpowering, the other flavors kick in and balance the whole thing out. It truly is a masterpiece. Hops taste so good, and when they are used so perfectly in this way you just really have to appreciate it. I wish I had the vocabulary to describe what it is you get with this stuff, but it is that quality you get with the Dreadnaughts, Masala Mamas. Its just a tier above so many others.

I figured no better beer to start with than good old pliney. As the bottle feverishly recommended, I opened as soon as it arrived at my doorstep. Thanks to Joey from Southbay for shipping it over!  Appearance: Pours a golden, copperish, clear color. Nice big cream colored head... I have a feeling this lacing will linger.  Smell: Explosion of aromas: citrus, apricot, peach, some lemon and very, very sweet. You know its going to be a hop monster as soon as you open and pour it... when the nose actually hits the rim of the glass it really pounds down the door. It smells a lot like those candy peach rings, the ones that are white on the bottom and yellowish orange on top, really chewy... just a great smelling IPA  Taste: Hop city, all over the place. I still get the peach and apricot, but now with a lot of Christmas tree... now that I taste it, the piney smell is powerful and I'm not sure how I missed it at first. It has a spice lingering around that is hard for my palate to define... maybe nutmeg? The lady swears she tastes some clove... whatever it is, it's very nice and hangs out for the entire ride.  Mouthfeel: Smooth, silky, coats the tongue well and glides off nicely, lots of carbonation, very bitter, very good.  Drinkability: Pliney hides the 8% well, I could certainly have few more under the right conditions. It was a pleasure to drink and has so much control... extremely balanced.  I am not sure if I am enjoying this so much because it's my first time putting the sensory process on paper as I experience it... but this has catapulted to the top of my list for its style and beers in general.

They are certainly doing special things there.",Russian River Brewing Company,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,100
863,7971,phattysbox,4.87,"Got from a trade with beerbeagle...  Poured into DFH snifter. Nice off white and fine head that retreats to thin lace. Some nice webbing. Awesome orange amber hues with near perfect clarity. A very nice looking brew.  Smell: WOW! Citrus, grapfruit, and lemon abound in the nose and linger for a long time. There's a really nice sweetness to the nose (from the malts) that melds perfectly with the hop profile. Earthy and grassy notes also pull through in the nose.  Taste: More WOW! Initial bittering hops hits the palate - earthy, resiny and very oily. If hops could have a thick profile - this would be it. The hops linger, but do not destroy the palate (which is very hard to get a big hop profile and not wipe out taste buds). The hops that do hit fast slide to back really quick to let in sweet malts. Notes of buttery toffee and sweet candy come to mind to balance out this perfect DIPA.  Mouthfeel was extremely smooth for the strong hop presence. Alcohol was not evident and this brew went down very quick to my amazement! I have one more bottle I'm dying to open, I'm going to have to trade for more.  The pentultimate DIPA IMHO.

863,7971,jkendrick,4.92,"Other beer info: 500ML bottle poured into pint glass. 8% abv. Bottled on Sept. 22, 2008  Appearance: Slightly cloudy copper to amber body with nice off-white, 1/4"" thick head that faded gradually leaving nice lacing  Aroma: An impressive hops blast as soon as I opened the bottle. In the glass, the aroma remains strong and pleasant. Very hoppy of course, with strong citrus and pine. Is that grapefruit I smell?  Mouthfeel: It is very smooth with just the right amount of carbonation that materializes on the tongue. It is thick for an IPA and has a very bold feel in the mouth and on the cheeks  Taste: The aroma carries over to the taste nicely but the intense hops don't hit immediately but rather settle in as the carbonation overtakes the tongue. This is a very California IPA and compares favorably with some of my favorites from Stone and Dogfish Head (yes, I know DFH is not a California brewery). For an 8% brew there isn't a big alcohol taste. There is some sweetness, but it is definitely not AS sweet as other D-IPAs I've had. The aftertaste is very nice as well making it a nice sipping beer.  Overall impression: D-IPA is my favorite style and I am an unabashed hophead. That said, I put this right up there with my favorites. This IS a hophead's dream with a nice, complex mix of hops aromas and tastes. I've had this on tap as well (though I am reviewing now from a bottle) and both present a nice creamy, easy-to-drink brew, especially for a D-IPA.

Copper body with a small, whispy, off-white head. Not a lot of retention, but a decent amount of stringy lacing.  Smells great. Juicy, sweet, citrusy hops. Noticeable malt in the background.  Tasty. Up front comes some citrus and bitter flavored hops. Next comes some sweet hops and sweet toffee like malts. Finish a little buscuity malt flavor and some more bitterness.  Mouthfeel is oily and bitter.  This is a very drinkable and great DIPA. I had two bottles and drank both before I wrote a review. I'm glad because the first one didn't have quite the hop character of the second.

863,7971,BEERchitect,4.55,"Sharply citrusy and bone dry- Russian River knows that these halmarks are the only ones that matter in this simple and strong style.  Pouring a highly carbonated and creamy overall appearance, the beer delivers the most supple of haze upon a strong golden, light copper hue. A creamy ecru head builds on the beer and coats the sides of the glass with sheets of lace as the beer falls for a very charming and stately appearance.  Aromas of every citrus fruit that you have ever known rushes to the olfactories with an onslaught that's extremely zesty, ripe, and fresh. Only the most supple of malty caramel notes inform the sweeter notions of fruit but intently stray from the focused citrusy notes of oranges and grapefruit.  Flavors follow suit with a strong emphasis on hoppy oils that remind the tastebuds of ruby red grapefruit pulp, freshly grated oranges, and tangerine succulence. Citrusy overall, but it's the underlying malty sweetness of thin caramel that gives the fruity hop flavors just enough sweetness to not become sour, acidic, or overly sharp. Lightly salty in taste, the beer's water profile gives a rounded element that's sometimes lacking in these dry beers.  But the dryness doesn't only manifest in taste, it also presents a quick evaporative feel just after the early creamy notion of malt whisps away and leaves a bitter, resiny-dry finish of citrus sharpness and lightly herbal/grassy bite in aftertaste.  Pliny is a quentessential IPA that displays all the finnese of hop oils and resins for ultimate clean citrus flavor and resiny bitterness. This only happens because of the understated and clean caramel malt base. Although this would normally expose a lot of hop and alcohol harshness in merely mortal beers, it's surprising that none of those show here. Russian River nails this one!  Thanks also bbehr and hopluva1!",Russian River Brewing Company,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,100
863,7971,chuckd123,4.62,"Had this one on tap at O'Brien's in San Diego this weekend. Poured a deep, dark orange color with an extremely creamy, thick head. Lacing lasted until I was just about done with it.  The smell is incredible -- typical of an IPA, but the hops jump out at you like none other. Not a lot of alcohol in the smell, but truly amazing, floraly hop aroma. No better way to describe it.  The taste, oh the taste. The prototypical west coaster for sure. Hops hops and more hops. Has a very fresh taste to it for what that's worth as well.  Mouthfeel is excellent, just this side of a creamy feel. Nothing too harsh or biting, just right.  Drinkability is as high a s as you can get with an 8% beer, I had 2 of them and could have continued if not for the drive back to the downtown area.

863,7971,mj001jk,4.5,"Pours orange with white soap-scum like foam.  The hops jump out of the glass and grab you by the neck. This is an IPA and a west-coast one at that. No arguing about that. There are loads of citrus, primarily grapefruit, but also some orange and lemon zest with lighter grassy notes and that characteristic pine resin. As the beer warms some tropical fruit aromas develop as well, pineapple and mango/papaya comes to mind. The hops are intense but not overbearing, even allowing for some slight bready yeast aromas to escape.  Your mouth puckers immediately on contact with this juice but it doesn't get harsh, it slowly releases its grip and you are left with a wondrous melange of flavors that slowly evaporate from your sensation.  The balance between the malts and the bittering is exquisite and delicate, even leaving some trace amounts of sweetness on the long finish which in my opinion makes this a perfect dessert beer on its own.  Hands down one of my favorite IPAs and I am fortunately only a stoned-throw away from the tap.",Russian River Brewing Company,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,100
863,7971,maximum12,4.87,"Thanks to bring for shunting a few bottles of Pliny across the continent to land on my doorstep a few days ago. The bottle said something about drinking this fresh, I forget what, so I thought I better get on it. Split the first bottle with the wife, who'd already had fresh Pliny on tap in California.  I popped the cap & holy crap. The smell. I thought I'd reached IPA scent nirvana the first time I dipped my schnaz into a Furious, but this is...better? Close? The next Pliny is going to be opened right next to a Furious. I have to know. Damn. The taste didn't disappoint. The hops came screaming out of the bottle glass & took my tonuge by storm, like chewing on a liquid, delicious pine cone. Despite that, Pliny managed to keep a relative lightness about it that other IIPAs (ahem, Dreadnaught) lose in the move to higher ABV.  I don't know how many of these I could drink, but I'd like to find out.  I might have hit a milestone tonight. Darkness on tap followed by my first Pliny.

Upon his recommendation and the bottles...do not store...drink this beer.  For the review:  A - Much much lighter than i'm used to for this style. A golden hue. Initial markings were 4 for A but bumped to 4.5 for the lovely lovely lacing. Not an overly thick head though.

I dont think my vocab is large enough yet to describe what i'm tasting...subtle mixed in with lovely large hops  M - Oh yes, just the way i like my beer. Thick and creamy. Like my women...uhhh..wait, scratch that. You know you're drinking a beer here. Did I say creamy?

Which leads to some of the most gorgeous lacing I have seen with a beer.  S: wonderful nose, great hoppy notes, mostly citrus, fresh grapefruit and solid pine resin notes. Outstanding sweet malt aromas.  T: I can see why it is so well talked about. This beer is exceptionally balanced. Wonderful hop flavors, mostly fresh, and I mean fresh citrus with a slight hint of pine. The malts make this beer, smooth and clean malt backbone, really separate this. Great flavors, very similar to Bell's Two Hearted Ale.  M: clean and crisp. extremely well balanced. perfect carbonation level and just so well put together.  D: good...wait, great beer. damn near perfect, but not much gets the 5.0. Will definitely persue this beer again and again. ABV is a little high.",Russian River Brewing Company,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,100
863,7971,kirok1999,4.57,"Thanks to mcallister for sharing this bottle. This is getting to be a habit. Pours a clear gold with tons of sticky lacing. Smell is all about pine and grass. It just leaps out of the bottle, it doesn't need to be poured to be smelled. Taste is so well defined. It's about the pine/grass hops. This is not a mish mash of hops that cover each other up. A very simple and very delicious beer. It knows what it wants to be and does it very well. Nice balance of sweetness in the finish. There's a lot of spice as well, light cinnamon, corriander. Feels thick and oily and is exceptional to drink. Another beer I could easily drink every night.",Russian River Brewing Company,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,100
863,7971,MinorThreat,4.65,"Served from a 12oz bottle from Mondo Vino 32nd and Lowell Denver CO.  A- The color and clarity of tempered clover honey with a decent white head and nice lacing  S- I get a bunch of Pine overlapping citrus/grapefruit and sweet fruit, mango? Fresh mowed grass, like a golf course at 7am in July, really nice.  T- Really well balanced/rounded for a DIPA (or should I say THEE DIPA). Slight malt sweetness balanced with spicy grapefruit hops. Bitterness is balanced nicely with just enough malt to soften the hop power of Pliny. Hard to argue with Vinny, hell he invented the style at Blind Pig. How could he NOT make the best DIPA in the land? The expectations of Pliny were high and justly so. The expectations were blown out of the water; this is great beer.  M- Light on the gas for all the right reasons. No Co2 burn, just some sharp hop bitterness. Soft, light...damn tasty.  D- Widespread distribution recently hit Denver and I have managed to buy out my local LQ on more than one occurrence. Highly drinkable.  I really think that if I had to choose only one beer to drink for the rest of my life Pliny the Elder would be a hard brew to deny. I just wish they would bottle Pliny the Younger and distribute to Colorado. I've heard it is unreal.",Russian River Brewing Company,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,100
863,7971,SubtleHammer,4.43,"Pours golden yellow with a thick, creamy, white 1 finger head that dissipates quickly into a thin lacing. Piney initial aroma recedes into grapefruit and a touch of wet green grass. Surprisingly sweet, sharp fruit flavor of pineapples and mango balance out the bitterness of the hops which are almost an afterthought until the alcohol kicks in. The flavors linger and mingle on the palate held together by the incredible creamy malts. The sweet start is punctuated by a long, dry, finish. Like it's namesake, this beer is complex, worldly and iconic.",Russian River Brewing Company,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,100
863,7971,xpimptastikx,4.37,"Thanks to Midaszero for the bottle.  The bottle poured a perfect clear golden liquid, with a good amount of carbonation and a nice little head. Good lacing with this DIPA too. It smells fresh and sweet, a good amount of floral hops with a fruity sweetness. Its taste is a little less hoppy than the smell, but pleasing since I drank the beer alone. I would have needed food had I had more than 1. It has a light feeling in the mouth that finishes pleasantly. I'm happy to have had this DIPA!",Russian River Brewing Company,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,100
863,7971,rtratzlaff,4.62,"Thanks to atsprings for a pour of this wonderful beer.  Pliny pours a lighter shade of gold with plenty of carbonation creating a decent white head.  Aromas of pineapple and citrus are dominant in the nose.  The taste is hoppy and delicious. Plenty of tropical citrus flavors stick to the tongue and the glass. This is a great beer.  A lighter mouthfeel for a DIPA is pleasing to me as this is a beer that could be quaffed were it not for the rarity. This is a good IPA, but there are others more readily available that would match us to this one.",Russian River Brewing Company,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,100

863,7971,younger35,4.7,"Just received a bottle of this from TexasWayne today. I've been wanting to try this for quite some time and I can't wait (despite my slight hangover). Drank from my Stone India Pale Ale flute. Bottled on 07/30/08.  Appearance- Pours a yellowish orange with a nice soft one finger bright white head that doesn't recede. The cap and collar are nice and thick and fluffy and leaves plenty of sticky lacing. Smell- Smells 100% like I was expecting it to. Pliny is piney and raw with a huge hop presence (duh, right?). Some citrus consisting of pineapple and grapefruit add a fresh burst of fruity goodness. A very mild graininess is present that adds a light sweetness that is detectable until the beer warms considerably. Orange zest and even some lilac finish the nose. Taste- A bit different than I was expecting. More delicious. Fruity bitterness from the start with loads of fresh peach, grapefruit pith, orange peel and freshly cut pineapple. A touch of pine and even a raw herbal element peeks through at some points throughout this experience. Just a touch of sweetness peaks through all those hops adding a very light caramel maltiness. The sweetness gets more noticeable as it warms and reminds me a lot of that raw grainy sweetness that comes from flaked maize. Finishes with a lingering fruity bitterness. Mouthfeel- Nice and creamy with a slick oily feel from the ridiculously copious amount of hops. Light carbonation with a medium to below heavy feel. Drinkability- Well despite the fact that I have a mild hangover from last nights drinking adventures, this thing went down really well. I imagine that in the 3 months since this has been bottled the hops have faded a bit yet this remains fantastic. I will try this fresh sometime that I promise! Big thanks again to Wayne for sending my way!",Russian River Brewing Company,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,100
863,7971,deereless,4.92,"A: A finger of foam on a straight pour, the head stuck around for 5 minutes and as it settled it left some sticky spots on the side of the glass, crystal clear, golden straw - 4.50, S: Pliny packs a powerful punch of pine and grapefruit - a hop lover's heaven, some faint signs of tropical fruit and cantelope, the aroma is thick and pungent and utterly delectable - 5.00, T: As I take the first sip and try to figure out the palate the bitter hops on the tail jump out, having done a homebrew based on Pliny the Elder I'm familiar with the hop build (Vinnie posted his recipe online) and the hop that stands out is the earthy Columbus hops, also lots of resiny flavors, malt as you might expect is present to balance out the beer but it truly plays second fiddle to the hops - 5.00, M: More body than I'd expect, mildly sticky and syrupy - 4.75, D: Given the difficulties in acquiring this beer, I savor it for those reasons alone, but this is top notch, hands down one of the best Double IPAs I've had - 5.00",Russian River Brewing Company,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,100
863,7971,jim102864,4.4,"Number 100 had to be a special beer, maybe something not readily available in Connecticut. I'd had Pliny the Elder at Toronado in San Francisco before and now it was time to ship some home during my recent business trip to San Diego (thanks Holiday Wine Cellar, Escondido) and evaluate it. I was not dissapointed.  Nothing but the best for this brew so out comes the Duvel tulip glass. Pliny pours a golden yellow hue with a bubbly yet not overly aggresive head about a pinky thick. Clear as a bell with light carbonation. I'm glad the 7 day UPS ground trip from Escondido to Connecticut didn't affect the appearance anyway.  Abundent piney hops eminates from the glass. Not overbearing but floral and slightly sweet like honey suckle. It changes somewhat to a citrusy-like grapefruit aroma as it warms. Sticky lace dots the glass with each sip.  And the taste? Piney and hopped but smooth and pleasant as was the mouthfeel. If it's possible to derive a buttery smoothness from an IPA (and I suppose it is given it's a double IPA) then this one accomplishes just that. The 8% warms the soul and creates a light blush within a few sips, though it is hidden from the taste quite nicley. As the beer continues to airate and warm, and the palate adapts to the hops, new features appear. The mouthfeel becomes slippery smooth. The hops, more understated. The initial piney nose becomes less noticeable and a light vanilla maybe oaramel comes into play. What a facsinating brew.  Obviously not a session beer but meant to sip and savor.  Frankly, I've had double IPA's that achieve much of what Russian River has with this style yet I appreciate the quality and complex flavors created by this wonderful brewery. I tip my cap to Russian River. I also enjoy this brew while thinking of Pliny the Elder, a hero who saved those fleeing from the eruption of Mt Vesuvius, who I'm certain would be honored to know a creation of such high quality as this was brewed in his name.",Russian River Brewing Company,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,100
863,7971,RedChrome,4.62,"A very faint haze to the light golden yellow color. Half an inch of pure white head shrank halfway before holding a few minutes. Just a single stream of carbonation rising from the center of the brew. Sitcky rings of lace.  Huge hops aromas were strongly leaning towards pine. A nice citrus backing behind the pine was mainly tangerine. Light malt sweetness had a light honey note.  Taste has a bit of grittyness to the taste. A nice blend of citrus and pine hops along with honey and bread sweetness. Also a bit of butterscotch. Not overpowering with hops, but exceptionally balanced.  Nice thickness holds on all mouth surfaces. A light carbonation tingle helps all the flavors blend together nicely.  A fantastic brew. A great pairing for a filet mignon. Clearly worth the high praise it recieves. A must for any fan of beer.",Russian River Brewing Company,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,100
863,7971,johnd513,4.67,"A big thanks goes to ducksfan for this one. This beer pours a light orange color with a thin head that sticks around for a while and leaves nice lacing on the glass. Smells of grapefruit and other citrus flavor. The taste is very citrusy with grapefruit and other citrusy flavors. Very balanced. The mouthfeel is incredibly creamy, full body with a dry finish. Drinkability is high and is limited only by its high abv. Truly a must try.",Russian River Brewing Company,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,100
863,7971,jamie2dope,4.17,"Thanks again to Christina for getting me this gem. Pours a decent enough clear gold, with a small white head show. Head quickly becomes a white ring of lace, with some staying power. Smell is of earthy hops, reminiscent of onions or cabbage. Some bits of grass and citrus can be smelled in the background. Taste starts off with some sweet honey comb and citrus, and follows through with the onion like hops. Mouthfeel is slightly lighter than was expected, but full of flavor. Alcohol warmth can be felt after the first few pulls on this brew, but I could see myself going through another bottle of this without a problem. An impressive DIPA from Russian River. Reminds me a lot of Stone's 10th Anniversary DIPA, which also showcased that same onion like hop profile. Worthy of the hype?

Nose is hops, lovely piny resinous grapefruity hops. Leans more towards the pine than to the citrus side. Taste is pretty much a citrus and pine explosion that leaves the mouth coated with bitter hop oils. I can't find any malt here, but I'm okay with it. Finish is dry, but the taste lingers begging you to take another sip. Well I've wanted to try this forever and finally got a chance, now I want more!!

863,7971,Atlas1,4.54,"Well, it took me several years to finally track down Pliny the Elder, but I found him at the Argonaut liquor store in Denver, CO. He's mine! All mine!  Poured into a belgian snifter, so I can really take it all in, Pliny appears a golden apricot color, with a slightly faint glow to it when held up to the light. Big bubbles settle on top, spread out, and eventually form a big bubbly ring around the glass. Very little lace. Oh my, the nose on this badboy is fantastic. Big and hoppy, but bursting with citrus (grapefruit, orange and lemon) as well. Strong pine scent is present as well, and perhaps overtakes the fruit scents in time. Beautiful nose for hopheads. Taste begins with strong fruit up front; grapefruit, apple, lemon. Big piney hop wave eventually overwhelms the taste buds. Very tart citrus pangs in the back of the mouth before the swallow. Finishes dense, hoppy, and bitter. Mouthfeel is even distributed throughout the taste; airy up front but with a strong dense, smooth finish.  This is a really great beer. I know understand what people have been talking about all these years. This is a big freaking IPA. Delicious and deliciously complex.

863,7971,marcpal,3.94,"What a nice surprise it was to see this on tap at my visit to Monks.  A: Very light orange/gold color, thin head. For a lighter feeling beer in texture, has some thick lacing.  S: Grapefruit and citrus hops. That is really it, no more and no less. You get when you sign up for here.  T: A bombardment of flavors. Some sweetness but hops are what this one is all about. Citrus, citrus, and some more citrus. Found the hops and grapefruit to become somewhat harsh early on and milder as it went on but intense. Felt like I sucked on a grapefruit after finishing, crushing.  M: Very light with a bitter oil coating all over your mouth from drinking it. Little to zero alcohol burn.  D: This is very drinkable if you love bitter beers. Was happy to try and it is still a palate destroyer, its hop presence is almost a bit much. Almost.  Not my favorite DIPA but surely a terrific beer. A must try for a hophead. I revisited it a couple of times both on tap and bottled, just doesn't blow me away.",Russian River Brewing Company,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,100
863,7971,rhinos00,4.92,"Wow! As a Cleveland native, tonight could not be more perfect...celebrating a Cleveland Browns victory on Monday Night Football by cracking open a bottle of Pliny the Elder.  Before I start my review, I would just like to thank mattolesh for sending me this beautiful specimen of a beer.  Poured this beer out of a 500 mL bottle into a snifter.  A- The appearance was a hazy golden orange. There was an inch of white head that gathered and quickly dissipated as the beer was consumed.  S- Like heaven in a bowl. There was mix of fruit and a nice smell of hops in the background.  T- DIPA/IPA are my style. I have never tasted a beer like this. The first thing that comes to mind is balance. From the first sip to the last, the balance was always there, the fruit and hops always working together to deliver a fresh, crisp flavor.  M- So smooth and crisp. A medium bodied beer, that never became syrupy or too sweet when the temperature warmed.  D- Dangerous! Is there even alcohol in this? I could honestly drink this beer all day long.  Like I said, DIPA/IPA are my favorite types of beer. I have had countless DIPA/IPA ranging from local microbrews to national breweries. IMHO this is by far the best one of them all. Now if only I could get Russian River Brewing Co. to move to Ohio. It is quite scary to think that Pliny has a younger relative out there somewhere.",Russian River Brewing Company,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,100
863,7971,7ways,4.49,"Thanks to skourtis for the trade, been meaning to try this for a while.  A- Poured an orange-straw color into a DFG snifter. Bone white head that lasted longer than it looked like it would. Cartoonish lace.  S- Unbelievably pungent. Smells almost as fresh as real fruit, mostly grapefruit and equal parts orange and lime, and Spring rain in the background.  T- Fruits more subdued while florals kick into overdrive. Pine obviously, but also...I don't know, it's like drinking a botanical garden. Very fresh and clean...kind of like soap. Yikes. Faint caramel maltiness announces itself with the citrus clamoring to be heard.  M- Unexpectedly creamy then dry, medium body. Bubbles sit on the tongue but don't irritate the throat.  D- Is there alcohol in this? If it hadn't come in a 500mL bottle, I would have drank it all before finishing the review. But even though it went down well, I have no urge to have another.  This is a great IPA, but only a good beer, nothing world class here IMHO. It did not really shine in any particular way for me except for maybe the aroma. I can think of at least four IIPAs off the top of my head that I can get locally and that I would choose over this.  UPDATE 10/03/10  This is now the 5th time I've had Pliny, and none of the others, including this one, have the soapy hop aspect I found 2 years ago. I'm picking up more simcoe-ish resin in the nose and the flavors I liked before are more pronounced and it's more complex overall. Mouthfeel is more enjoyable, definitely not as dry.  Taste goes from 4 to 5, mouthfeel 3.5 to 4, drinkability 3.5 to 4. B+ score becomes an A.",Russian River Brewing Company,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,100
863,7971,SiriusAth,4.92,"Snifter. Pours a clear, burnished gold with a one finger pure white foamy head which is only ever so slowly receding. Fat sheets of lace crusting the walls of my Terrapin snifter all the way to the bottom of the glass when finished. Beauterrific!  Wow! Absolutely phenomenal citrus nose. Fresh cut pink grapefruit, lemon zest, pine sap, even a little lime. Floral, fragrant and freaking great! The thing that blows me away is how truly fresh the citrus fruit smells are, like they were just picked and cut open right in front of me. Best IPA nose I've yet experienced.  The taste is not quite as pronounced as the nose, but still terrific. There is a nice caramel sweetness that is met with a wonderful melange of citrusy hops. Grapefruit is the main player, but also lemon and pineapple, along with pine resin and some grassy notes. As the beer warms the citrus becomes even more pronounced, and I have to retract my first statement n the taste not being as pronounced as the nose. Re-damn-diculously good, and remarkable at how there is almost no harshness with all this hoppiness going on.  Lighter bodied than I was expecting, between light and medium and not nearly as sticky as most imperial IPA's in this abv range are, which is a bonus. Very smooth, perfectly carbonated, extremely well hidden alcohol with no burn even close to being present.  Well, well. I must say, the hype is real. May be, no, is the best IPA I've ever had.

Poured into a pint glass.  3/4 inch white head that is right inbetween froth and the big carbonated bubbles. Decent head retention. Superb lacing. Very cloudy, rather viscous and gritty, but still withholds some transparency. Gold/orange color.  Top class nose. Grapefruit citrus, danky, piney (heavier on the pine than most DIPAs which I really like :) This is the benchmark of quality ingredients for a west coast DIPA.  Very piney. Grapefruit citrus. Seems like a simple played out formula for a DIPA, but this here is your flagship. Quality.  Creamy, smooth mouthfeel.

863,7971,lacqueredmouse,4.64,"Light golden body with great clarity. Some slightly smooth cascading action out of the bottle. Head is a perfect small-bubbled crest of white foam. Excellent lacing. Looks very good.  Did someone set the hop volume to 11? Huge burst of rich, bubbly hop resin craziness on the nose. Luscious with fruit, pine, citrus even verging on mint or basil. A big, boisterous, powerful, delicious nose. The best hoppy beer I've ever had the pleasure to inhale.  Smooth and clean in the mouth. Not a crazy bitter character, but pungent and fragrant. Starts very clean, with a smooth resin-oil hop character, building towards the back. Finishes dry, but with a lingering sweetness as well.  I have no idea where the 8% is hiding. It's as drinkable as any lower ABV brew I've had. Mouthfeel is awesome, just smooth and slick. Can't get much better than this out of the bottle.  Wow!

863,7971,aerozeppl,4.57,Thanks to Beerzebub for a fresh bottle via trade.  A: When I opened the bottle it did not have much of a pop and I was worried. Poured a nice golden color with some haze. Minimal white head. Some lacing.  S: Big grapefruit nose up front. Not as intense as the younger but a similar bold nose. Basically fresh cut hops with some citrus thrown in and possibly some illicit narcotics.  T: Wow. Just a wonderful blast of flavor.Starts off a little sweet then the bitterness creeps in. Then it is full on citrus hops. Very nice. I still think this bottle had some issues but it is still this good. A nice bitterness lingers with the finish.  M: I would say this is a bit of a letdown for me. I want my IPAs with a sticky mouthfeel but this fell a little bit short of that.  D: More. Seriously glad this is now bottled.

863,7971,spointon,4.72,"I poured this one from a 16.9oz (500ml) brown bottle into an Imperial pint glass.  A= This ale poured a clear, bright, medium gold color with a 2"" sudsy white head. The head dropped to a thick skim rather quickly, and left serious sticky lacing down the glass.  S= I found huge aromas of pine and grapefuit backed by slightly sweet and biscuity malts. A simple but wonderful 1-2 punch. A little bit of solvent alcohol came forth when the glass was swirled.  T= As you would expect, this ale was all about the hoppiness. Right from the start, each sip was filled with a puckering pine resin flavor which seemed to push things to the limit yet never became uncomfortably bitter. The sweet biscuit malts offset the hops enough to make this beer a pleasure, yet not enough to keep it from being a true hop bomb. The finish is yet more hops and a cracker like dryness followed by a warming alcohol rush.  MF= Light side of medium body, lower carbonation level, dry and crisp mouthfeel.  D= One of the absolute best DIPAs I have ever had and that is saying something. I really appreciate that the brewer found a way to intensely hop this beer, make it big enough and malty enough to balance most of those hops, and still keep the beer rather light and crisp (not thick or syrupy like many beers of this style are). Incredible and highly recommended!",Russian River Brewing Company,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,100
863,7971,kinnaird,4.69,"This review will be similar to my Blind Pig review because these two beers are very similar.  Large, white soapy head on a bright, golden body,  Smells of piney, resiny, grapefuity goodness. There's just a touch of malty sweetness, but you really have to look for it.  Super hoppy bitterness. I don't know how Vinnie does it, but this is more hoppy than any other beer. Not balanced in a good way.  Clean, dry, crisp. Just the slightest amount of sweetness.  It's amazing that an 8% beer can be so dry, but PtE does it amazingly well.

S: Oh so much pine... A pretty complex smell, lots of evergreen pine but also some floral and citrus.  T: Great pine flavor that transitions gracefully into ripe tropical fruit flavor. A balanced malt that doesn't get in the way, it just rounds out the flavor. Piney, hoppy, crisp, creamy... everything I want in a double IPA.  M: A pretty creamy mouthfeel, a touch oily with a good balance of carbonation and hops. The hop taste stays with you for quite a while, it coats the whole mouth and not just the sides of your tongue.  D: This is my second time trying this beer and it delivers again.

863,7971,popery,4.92,"How do I love thee Russian River seasonal IPAs? Let me count the ways. Blind Pig. Pliny the Elder. Pliny the Younger. Actually, I haven't had the pleasure of trying the Younger, if I'm being completely honest, but I can only imagine the heights of perfection that beer reaches. If I had to choose between the Blind Pig and the Elder, I would take the Elder by a hair, but I'm taking nothing away from Blind Pig with that statement. Both beers are masterpieces of super hopped, fresh IPAs (well, I guess DIPA for Elder but that's semantics).  First of all, I love the German bottle style. It's a great size and feels right, particularly for someone with big hands that feels a bit like a giant when I hold a Miller High Life or any clear normal bottle. Back to the review. The beer looks incredible out of the bottle. It's bright and sunshiney with a giant soapy head, like a miniature carbonated bubble bath.  The smell is worth the price of admission. You know that Russian River has really bottled something special as soon as the huge floral scent hits you. It's piney, citrusy and, again, very floral. It's just an incredible scent for a beer. It's somewhere between a dense pine forest and a field of wildflowers. I can't say enough.  The taste is similarly incredible. It's chock full of hops that taste fresh, like living on a hop farm fresh. You taste the pine and citrus and flowers that are in the nose, and they've been translated into a great melding of beer flavor. I can't get enough of these fresh hop beers. If you're somehow not a fan of them, I guess you wouldn't like this beer. For the sane crowd, you'll love this beer.  The mouthfeel is great. I'm not even sure why I didn't give it a five. I guess I can't think of any one quality that puts it over the top of mere excellence, so it must make do with near perfection.  On the other hand, drinkability should be about a twelve. I have to hide this beer in the back of my fridge behind cartons of milk and carefully balanced glass jars, just so I won't drink it the same day that it comes home. I want a cooler split between Blind Pig and Pliny and a quiet Redwood grove with my dog. I could sit and drink in utter peace, while my urban little terrier cowers and hides from the gigantic wooden things.  To sum up, I would like a job marketing this beer. That seems easy and full of opportunities for tastings while getting paid and if they could throw in an isolated redwood grove that would be appreciated.",Russian River Brewing Company,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,100
863,7971,KeefD,4.44,"Thanks to BradLikesBrew for this one!  My second RR brew after Blind Pig. Pours a tangerine orange color bordering on rust with no head and very little lacing. Big time hoppy aroma of grapefruit, citrus and pine. Nice hop bitterness, plenty of bitter grapefruit rind, lemon peel, orange, and some thick pine resin. Some pale malt make up a decent backbone. Ever so dry on the finish. Sweetness is subdued. Very thick and smooth, creamy on the tongue with only the slightest bite from carbonation, which is in short supply. Alcohol presence is not quite hidden, but hidden enough for the high ABV. A great brew but could see having one at a time given the incredible bitterness from hops. I hope to see this beer in my hands again in the future.",Russian River Brewing Company,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,100
863,7971,jwc215,4.5,"Thanks to bitterbill for this one!  Bottled on 073008:  Pours chill-hazed amber with a creamy white head with good staying power. Uneven rings of lacing stick.  The smell is ... well - hops abound! Citrus, pine/resin, some herbal (going towards medicinal) over a biscuity malt.  The taste is very hoppy - citrus/grapefruit and pine/resin and leafy with a rounded caramel/toffee sweetness. The alcohol is deceptively well-hidden for 8%. Bitter but with with a rounding sweetness in the finish - a very ""big"" IPA - putting it into Double IPA (""Triple IPA""?) category - not as sweet and boozy as other examples of the style - truly a bigger IPA.  It is medium-to-full bodied - chewy, yet creamy.  Bitter, but rounded - this is deceptively drinkable!",Russian River Brewing Company,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,100
863,7971,MusicaleMike,4.49,"I enjoyed a few of these on tap at Gulifty's in Rosemont tonight and gave myself the opportunity to review this bad boy.  A: Served to me in a tulip glass, the body was a clear, deep amber color with strong golden highlight at the edge. Not much carbonation was visible. As far as the head went, it was poured with almost a finger of fine white bubbles sitting on top. Surprisingly, the head disappears to nothing and still manages to leave consecutive rings of lace all the way down the glass.  S: Big aroma! It is filled with smells of saturated citrus hops and sweet bubblegum. Tons of smells are melding together in this beer, but there is an overall sweet, fruity aroma that seems to be supported by a malt backbone in the depths of the nose.  T: I was expecting something incredibly bitter, and I was surprised to find this double IPA more well-balanced than my last girlfriend. Sure, it's hoppy; but in no way does this beer rip your tastebuds to shreds. The bitterness leaves impression up front and into the aftertaste, but it is kept in check by toasty malt notes.  M: Mmmm, full bodied, cool and smooth. The hops stain the mouth with all their juice, and with such a wonderfully fresh taste, I am not complaining.  D: I would order this beer every time if it were on tap. I had two tonight, and unfortunately, that was all I could handle. (I didn't eat shit today so get off my case!) But that says a lot if I am getting the same beer twice, since I like to try new things most of the time. Definitely try this beer if you like well designed beers and a boatload of hops.",Russian River Brewing Company,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,100
863,7971,ZAP,4.62,"A-Golden colored...perfect little creamy head on top.  S-Multiple levels to the aroma....right away there are some big spruce tree notes...followed by a sweet juicy citrus fruitiness...pinneaples, grapefruit, mandarin oranges tangerines, even some peaches....definitely some Simcoe hops involved...then finishes with some raw cannibus/tobacco notes...quite impressive.  T-I like IPA's that showcase hops flavors more than their pure bitterness...obviously there will always be bitterness but IPA's that bring out flavors as well are the ones I appreciate the most...and this one is exactly what I like about IPA's...it is juicy and flavorful...the malt keeps it from being one dimensional...don't get me wrong...this has a nice strong drying bitterness on the finish but this showcases a complex hop blend nicely with it's juicy flavors....again the fruits are big players...More grapefruit and pine on the taste than the sweeter fruits...also some tobacco notes.  M-Perfect...doesn't feel huge....doesn't feel thin....carbonation is spot on...good strong dry bitterness on the finish...I'm sure the IBU's are up there...but unlike some I have tried this is highly drinkable.  D-Top notch DIPA that lives up to its rep...there are so many good IPA's and DIPA's out there it is tougher than ever for me to come up with a top tier but this would definitely be in it...I like it better than Furious(which really borders on DIPA land) as it is more flavorful, more balanced, more complex and almost as bitter...

863,7971,Proteus93,4.62,"Bottle is dated Aug. 25, 2008... best to drink it up before age starts to settle in and I find myself in gross misconduct for not following the strict instructions on the bottle. ;)  A: A brilliant blonde body, with orangish gold highlighting. Head of white foam tops it all off and brings with it a nice stickiness.  S: Forest evergreens, along with all that goes with it... the earthiness and something of a mossiness, grasses, the works. Some notes of bark and sap... and it all comes together in a way that reminds me of a wooded area after a rain.  T: Perhaps one of the most intriguing flavours I've ever tasted in a DIPA. Much of the same as the aroma - the piney and earthy flavours. Some citrus spottiness is there, just adding a touch of highlight. Excellent.  M: A medium body, some hints of slickness to the feel, which makes for a smooth drink. It finishes dry, albeit a little delayed. The only criticism I'd be able to give would be that the carbonation starts to thin out as the glass warms a little. The dryness and such makes up for that a little, though adding that little extra crispness could make it perfect.  D: An excellent DIPA, finding a delicate balance in flavours without being overwhelmed with bittering flavours that would hide inconsistencies or flaws. An excellent beer, and among the better hoppy brews I have experienced.",Russian River Brewing Company,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,100
863,7971,FrognutUnl,4,"Bottle dated 8/25/2008.  Thanks to thethrone and the Jazz BIF for the chance.  Pours hazy, light copper in color with a nice stiff 3 finger off head. The wonderful aroma of grapefruit and floral hops assaults the nose. The taste is similar to the aroma, but with the addition of a slightly sweet caramel malt that does a nice job backing up the hops. The finish is a little grassy with the alcohol mildly present and could best be described as dry. The beer is medium bodied and the carbonation is not overwhelming. To sum things up this is a pretty tasty brew and I am happy to have had the opportunity.",Russian River Brewing Company,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,100
863,7971,roadhouse,4.5,"Well this just arrived this morning (thanks to Joey at SouthBay) and I just finished doing some painting so I think it's time for a reward. I just can't wait any longer.  Poured from a 16.9 oz. bottle that was bottled on 09/02/08 into a snifter.  Appearance is a clear orange with a one inch off-white head. Sinks down to a thin skim that holds up and leaves some decent lacing behind.  Aroma is outstanding. Citrusy, florally, piney hops galore. Even after the onslaught a sweet caramel tone peeks through. Very slight alcohol with a hard sniff as well.  Taste is just as good as the aroma. Initial hop bitterness is quite piney hinting at grapefruits as well. Midway through there is a split second where there is a very subtle sweet note, but it is quickly pushed away by more hops. Finish is so good I wanna wait to have another sip just to bask in the hoppy goodness, but alas I must indulge.  Mouthfeel is medium, but the carbonation level is perfect. On the swallow it gets very smooth and creamy.  Pretty much this is DIPA perfection. There's a reason this beer is so hyped. I pray for the day that this stuff gets distributed far and away.",Russian River Brewing Company,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,100
863,7971,Metalmonk,4.57,"Bottled 8/13/08. Gifted to me by msubulldog25, who I cannot thank enough.  Looks a beaut, with a bountiful, creamy, fluffy head that takes awhile to lessen, leaving lace striations here and there, while the body is a super-clean, well-filtered sunset copper-orange.  I cannot think of another beer that is not only this hoppy-smelling, but as untainted and unadulterated as Pliny the Elder. Pure, fresh, transcendental hops, balanced by malt but kept true and powerful by the talent of the brewer(s). Oh mama, this is beyond facile descriptions of ""pine"" and ""citrus"". It's just simply hops incarnate. Beautiful.  The flavor delivers wave after wave of pure hops bitterness, and even more hoppy fruitiness, yet avoids being an unbalanced tongue-ripper. Along with the wonderful, prominent hops character comes a candy-like malt sweetness that recalls gooey fresh caramel and hints of butterscotch syrup. Subtle floral hints throughout, along with just the right amount of grassy astringency, with toasted flavors lingering in the finish, along with, that's right, beautiful beautiful hops.  Finish isn't quite as creamy as I'd expected or hoped, but it's smooth and slick with just enough carbonation. Or maybe it could've used just slightly less bubbles, which I sometimes find distracting in this great style. It's not sticky, even though a layer seems to have been slathered across the tongue that won't let go. And that's fine, as the flavor lingers a long, long while.  The pleas by Russian River on the label to ""consume Pliny fresh or not at all"" and ""do not age"" are to be respected. ""Hoppy beers are not meant to be aged!"" sayeth Vinnie and R.R. It makes sense, but that's a discussion for the board--I'm just glad I was able to drink this only 6 weeks after it was bottled.

863,7971,Cresant,4.33,"poured this 16.9 oz brown bottle into a Tripel Karmeliet glass. Bottled on 090208 (less than a month from brewery to little ol' Kentucky). The body was clear and bright. The rich golden/apricot color glowed. The 1""+ of frothy, creamy, off-white head lingered- leaving splotchy lace. the film of foam never evaporated.  Smell was sweet satsuma. Piney. Clean grain. Citrus. Pungent earthy hops.  Taste was oily green hops. Grapefruit ring. Juicy oranges. Very nice, but I can't say I like this more than Hopslam.  Mouthfeel was medium but I expected it to be a bit richer. With only %.5 difference I actually think Firestone Walker Union Jack IPA is overall more flavorful than Pliney the E.",Russian River Brewing Company,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,100
863,7971,PhxHorn,3.92,"OK, after being disappointed in the on-tap version in SD, I've got a couple of bottles to try. Appearance is a hazy yellow with a quarter-inch of head. Smells strongly of pine and herbs. Fantastic aroma. Taste is another matter--very bitter, with a medium citrus flavor and a decent malt component. Just a two-dimensional flavor, though, not much complexity. Could have used some more varied hop flavors in there. Very drinkable, but just not the world-class IPA I was expecting.",Russian River Brewing Company,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,100
863,7971,bifrostguard,4.72,"A - A light yellow color with tints of amber and orange throughout. Light sediment floats about. A nice off white head the diminishes quickly and leaves a weblike lace all the way down.  S - This is with out a doubt the best part of this beer. Strong pine and citrus scents that just dominate the nasal passage.  T - I would like to give this a higher ranking, but it is just a little on the ciitrusy side for me. There are some strong pine and floral tastes with a complimentary malt backbone that makes this one oh so smooth. This is the perfect balance between malt and hops.  M - Medium bodied and slightly watery, but I couldn't imagine it any other way.  D - Huge props to this one for being able to drink more than a few of these and wake up w/o a hangover. You still have to deal with the alcohol clearance in the morning though.",Russian River Brewing Company,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,100
863,7971,Meandmymonkey,4.94,"Right from the bottle, pliny pours an awesome orange/amber color with a thick enduring head. The smell is almost better than the taste...almost. Very rich citrus, floral notes that make your mouth water in anticipation. This beer is hard to put down as it's loaded with super delicious hops that don't kick your tongue's ass. Velvety smooth with every drink. Most double IPAs leave that unpleasant tongue scraping taste on the back of your tongue long after drinking but Pliny leaves your mouth, stomach, and soul wanting more. Truly an inspiring brew. The bar has been set high with this ale.",Russian River Brewing Company,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,100
863,7971,gyllstromk,5,"This beer is in a league of its own.  Elder pours a copper that's clear as water. The head starts with a thick velvety appearance and quickly subsides to leave a frothy halo. Swirls leave soapy lacing along the wall of the glass.  If you took a field of piney hops, grapefruit, and flowers, put them in a blender, and compacted them into a pint, you'd still be nowhere near this aroma. The taste follows with an astringent bite that's powerful and balanced.  Between sips, the taste remains on your lips until the next, begging you to finish the bottle.  I've not tried Younger but I find it impossible that this beer could be improved upon. This beer is beyond all hype.

Managed to score a bottle to bring back with me. Should have filled my suitcase with more of it and less of some of the others I brought back.  Smells of piney hops and sour apples. Great aroma that I could keep sniffing forever except that I wouldn't get to drink it and that would be intolerable.  Tastes of sweet malt with a bit of a welcome sour/tart taste at the back, followed by lots and lots of piney, floral hops. Then just a little bit of spice on the swallow.  Perfect.

863,7971,mjryan,5,"Pours a hazy amber colour with a thick white head. Great retention and lace. The smell is very powerfull. It hits you the minute you crack the bottle. Piney (or is that Pliny), grapefuity and floral. No malt detected in the aroma at all. Flavour mirrors the aroma with the addition of a slight grassy taste and an enormous, but not tragically agressive, bitterness. The malt flavour is very nuetral, its sole purpose to cut the hops so they dont burn your face off. Very, very dry finish. Has a lighter body (for a IIPA), which makes this a very drinkable beer.

863,7971,jjayjaye,4.87,"Poured a surprisingly pale amber color with a huge foamy white head that leaves tons of Belgian lacing with every mouthful. I've been conditioned to expect a certain 'level' of color is required to achieve world class levels of mouth and flavor. This one convincingly shattering that myth, but i'd prefer a meatier color. The smell is aggressive, intense with floral piny resin and grapefruit. Hugely tangy with hops, the mouth feel is full bodied and compliments the flavor during and after taste. Full flavored the piny resin and grapefruit flavors explode and linger as anticipated. Interesting to taste RR IPA, Blind Pig and Pliny side by side. The fundamental elements flavor being the common thread...the difference really being the intensity in both the mouth and depth of flavor. Drinkability is a 4.75...i'm having a really hard time believing that this one is only 8% ABV. The intensity of the mouth and flavor textures hide the kick-in-the-as* that is inevitable. One of the best ales i've had the opportunity to experience...clearly topping off my venture to mecca. The real amazing thing about a Russian River sampler is the scope and breathe of their products.

Great hop aroma, slightly cloudy gold color with just a bit of red. Nice head retention. Amazing combination of a solid malt backbone with tons of hops.

863,7971,Reino,4.4,"Bottled On: 090208 (18 days old when consumed)  Appearance- A beautiful burnt orange with gold fills my New Belgium goblet. A smidgen over 2 fingers of head sits on top looking creamy and delicious. The head falls down at a medium pace, leaving some very nice lacing. Can I judge the book but it's cover?  Smell- Defuckinglishes smell! Pine, orange, mango puree, and a tiny bit of alcohol heat underneath. I made a comment in my notes the next night on the same batch that said, ""Smells like a forest after a hard, grapefruit juice rain."" It looks great, and smells even better...  Taste- This beer is like a hop cage match with the malts being a nonchalant referee. First I get spicy pine smashed with orange juice and spicy mango. Then, I get a round of lemon rind and bitter, lingering grapefruit making for quite the wave of acidity. There is a bit of malt in the middle, but you forget about it pretty quick with it being sandwiched by intense hops. I am let down that the juiciness I get in the smell doesn't hang around in the taste. I get more bitterness from the fruits than juiciness. The grapefruit is more pith than pulp. There is definitely tasty fruit flavors in there and I really enjoy the taste, but I'm greedy and wanted more.  Mouthfeel- Slick, enamel stripping mouthfeel. I do find the feel to have a bit of wateriness to it, which I wasn't expecting. It's the one thing I have against Blind Pig, and I didn't expect it to be present in the Elder, too. After taking two sets of notes, I read my buddy theWolfofMibu's review and he nailed something about the mouthfeel, ""Feels like I brushed my teeth with Crest pine needle flavored toothpaste.""  Drinkability- For the style and abv, this beer goes down smooth and it's tough to pass on another after the first. I could see myself getting together with some friends, having a few pints of this, and making some bad decisions. Great stuff, but not my favorite DIPA. Having lived in the Midwest and the PNW, it takes something near perfect to ""Wow!"" me in this style. Pliny comes really close, but falls short.",Russian River Brewing Company,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,100
863,7971,everetends,4.58,"16.9 oz bottle that I am indebted to Wetpaperbag for quite a while Poured into a tulip. Bottled on 8-13-08.  A: Pours an oily, yellowy, amber. This beer is a bit hazy, definitely not clear. Got a good two fingers of beautiful, tight, off white head. The retention is pretty good, sticking around for a while. The lacing is sticky as hell, leaving a lot of beautiful webbing on the glass that just goes all the way down the glass. The lacing and head are just perfect.  S: The smell is if you cut a fresh, ripe grapefruit, this is how this beer smells. Just a beautiful, thick citrus smell. There are also some really nice mandarin orange scents coming through as well. Nice piny hops are present giving some nice bitter smells coming through. This beer smells great.  T: Taste is great as well. Really lush grapefruit flavor is first and foremost. The meat, the flesh, and the rind are all present. The grapefruit is sweet and tart. Tangerine and orange flavors are coming through very clearly. Piney and spicy hops are here coming through as well and are cut with a nice bready malt. Little bit of pepper in there as well. Oddly the bitterness does not play a role until the finish. I was kinda expecting this to be a more bitter hop bomb. This is still amazing.  M: A heavy medium body that is incredibly oily. This beer just sticks to your mouth and does not let go at all. All the flavors mingle on the palate incredibly long. Aftertaste is of bitter hops that challenge the palate at times. This beer is drying, but it just makes you want more.  D: Drink it. This beer is great. It looks and feels amazing. The flavor is damn near perfect. I think fresh, this beer would blow me away. Such a treat to enjoy and joy to have.",Russian River Brewing Company,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,100
863,7971,erikm25,4.82,"A: Bottle date: 09/22/08. Pours a crisp yellow with honey gold hues. Tight thumb size head after fast aggressive pour. The head is a rich creamy sauteed butter and olive oil coloring. Lacing drapes across the glass.  S: Nectarines coated in spiced and spruced pine with minced orange peels. Strong smell of fresh mandarin orange, pineapple, and dewy cut grass. Hops are apparent coupled with a touch of sweet bread. Thick floral and rich brown saccharine aromas. Easily one of the best smelling beers I have experienced.  T: Grapefruit, lemon, tangerine, and an assortment of other tropical fruits. A pleasant pine hop and clover finish that makes this quite refreshing. Impressive caramel malt and sweet candied base provides the perfect counterpoint to the tropical citrus mint taste. Overall, the balance amazing and it can be easily forgotten there is 8% tag here.  M: Mouthfeel is lush, juicy, and full bodied.  D: I had been waiting to try this and it lived up to what I expected.

863,7971,JoeMayo,4.25,"A- Pours a clear, dark golden color with a thin cap of head which sticks around for almost the whole beer.  S- Lots and lots of pine. There is a slight malty sweetness in the nose, as well as a little citrus and spicy, floral notes, but the piney hop aromas certainly dominate.  T- I was afraid that it would be astringent based on the smell, but it was actually somewhat well-rounded in terms of intensity. The piney flavor hits really hard and I had to look pretty hard before getting any citrus (grapefruit and pineapple). I really liked that it was very hoppy, but not painfully bitter.  M- Much more refreshing than I would have immagined, but with a crisp, lingering bite in the finish.  D- One at a time is enough for me. I'd like to have it again in the future, but I couldn't handle two in a row.  Although I really enjoyed this beer, I think it may be getting a little more hype than it deserves. If there was a little more citrus or malt, just to counter the pine a little, it would be up there with the world-class beers.",Russian River Brewing Company,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,100

It poors a reasonably clear yellow with a thin white head and medium carbonation, as expected from a beer with high levels of hops.  The aroma feels heavy on citrus fruits. Again, as expected from the hops, there is the floral and spicy notes.  One of the things that surprised me was that despite the level of hops, it was not overly bitter. There is plenty of hoppy flavor but it is quite smooth. You do not notice the alchol content and is not as sweet as the aroma.  It has a healthy texture in the mouth and is not particularly dry. There is a nice crispness, which overall reasults in a very drinkable beer. I would recommend this to anybody that enjoys the pleasure of a well balanced beer that has plenty of hop flavor. I certainly see why people love this beer.",Russian River Brewing Company,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,100
863,7971,ghostwalker,4.45,"Golden body with a reddish tinge. Head is thick and creamy. A vision in my Stone RIS tulip.  Nose is spicy and piney. Sweetness is present, but the strong hop spice dominates.  Flavor is deeply steeped hops. Having seen the hop bill for this brew, I know that I am not familiar with two of the varieties. It presents a very complex and interesting blend of various hop characteristics. Pine dominates, not so much citrus to my palate, but it is there. The sweet malt is also there, but obviously not the main attraction. Very tasty indeed.  Mouthfeel is creamy with a moderate amount of the enamel stripping quality that I love.  Drinkability is remarkable, considering the ABV. I think that the pineyness could build up over a few pints, limiting drinkability at some point, but this one 500mL bottle will not be enough.

Nose is about par for this style but I was expecting just a bit more from such a highly decorated brew. Taste is good and meets expectations.

Pours a slightly chill hazed orange amber color with about a finger and a half of light ivory head on top. Head retains pretty well, keeping a thin lace and leaving a little bit of stick. This was looking like a 4 at first but after each sip the lace reloads itself and stays nice and full all the way down.  Smell has an incredible burst of grapefruity citrus hops, and a ton of pine resin, as well. Huge hoppy nose that is really amazing and very aromatic.  Taste is also loaded with awesome hop flavor. I'm not sure what I can say that others haven't said. Just tons of grapefruity citrus and pine resin, and some herbal characters, as well. There isn't really a prominent malt flavor here but the hops are loaded with flavor so this never feels like a true hop bomb, although it toes the line. Bitterness is substantial but it doesn't quite overwhelm the hop flavor.  Mouthfeel is not quite full, and actually as hoppy as it is I'd expect it to be a bit slicker and creamier.  Ok, yeah, this definitely lives up to the hype. Top notch DIPA for sure. Thanks again Kevin.",Russian River Brewing Company,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,100
863,7971,jojox,4.04,"Had on tap at Monks in Philly. No notes, just from recall.  I was excited to try this after missing a few of the kegs around in SEPA - apparently we'll be seeing a lot more of it from now on.  Hazy gold color, good head, lasting.  The smell is very IPA, tons of hop resin and sticky bitterness.  Tastes like the smell, hops from beginning to end, but also somewhat balanced by the malt. I don't know how old this is but I'm guessing its different than the guys drink in CA in the shadow of the brewery. Still, strong but not over the top hops.  After getting a few sips in, I don't notice the hops anymore. There develops a kind of dull middle taste, I can't describe the flavor but it's kinda vanilla/cream/strangeness that's dull and takes over the middle of the palate. It also makes the mouthfeel a little dead. If it was on tap every day, I probably wouldn't drink it all that much, to be honest...  very drinkable, but I'm a little disappointed with this dull middle flavor.

Nice foamy white head on top that clings to the glass well, middle of the road foam density. Carbonation bubbles quickly rise to the top. Given the hop level the appearance is as expected.  Aroma doesn't dissapoint. Its got a bit of everything in here when it comes to the hops, quite floral and sweet, pink lemonade and grapefruit, tangerine rinds, hint of hop spiciness. Some bubble gum hints. No malts, hehe.  Actually...this one isn't that bitter to me. Tons of hop flavor, really smooth bitterness. Hello tastebuds! This is the UPS man delivering a bit ol' box of hop flavor right to your door! Flavor is a bit less sweet than the aroma, more pungent and piney notes show through along with more citric fruit rinds. Basically no malt or yeast contribution. Notes of the alcohol are non existant.  Nice smooth mouthfeel, not really dry, a bit fuller than expected. It lacks that sharp edge IPAs usually have. I don't think the carbonation level is that high either really. If it was any higher you wouldn't be able to pour it given the head retention properties hop oils have.  Pretty good stuff. Alcohol is well hidden which could be dangerous. I would pick this up on occassion. My taste preference have shifted over the past year and a half, so I'm no longer focused on super hoppy beers like I used to be. I dont want to say this is overrated, but I've had other beers on the market that I thought were just as good as this one is.",Russian River Brewing Company,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,100
863,7971,Seanibus,4.5,"Another Russian River offering that lives up to the hype. A well balanced, well crafted double IPA.  Pours copper with a huge fluffy head that falls to amazing lacing. The aroma is strong with floral hops. The flavor is vast, with grapefruit dominating, with a tea-like tannic finish. The mouthfeel is thin, slightly clingy. Delicious, well balanced with an apricot-like finish.",Russian River Brewing Company,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,100
863,7971,watchnerd,4.42,"Bottle from City Beer in San Francisco.  Holy molly grapefruit! Citrus explosion in my nose that goes nuclear in my mouth. It's like performing cunnilingus on a woman made of citric acid.  And a little bit of that hemp stink one gets with West Coast hops.  Not as in your face or as bitter as, say, Stone's Ruination Ale, although, in a floral sense, just as hoppy. Ultimately more drinkable than the ruination ale, though.  I've got to get more of this stuff. It's up there with Old Rasputin for one of the best West Coast brews.",Russian River Brewing Company,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,100
863,7971,Monsone,4.62,"A - Clear golden yellow with a bigh white head.  S - Big citrus hop scents. Grapefruit, lemon, pine. Man this smells good.  T - Big hop bite of grapefruit, lemon rind and pine. Good malty backbone with a slight sweet caramel.  M - Good carbo and medium body. Smooth and balanced.  D - This is a supremely drinkable DIPA. I could toss these back for a while, though I would be able to taste anything else afterward.  Overall, just a sublime example of a DIPA. One of my favorites. Wish it was easier to get in Chicago. Guess I will have to settle with 3F.",Russian River Brewing Company,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,100

M- Perfect carbonation, medium body, suprisingly smooth for this level of IBU  D- really easy to drink (except for the price)",Russian River Brewing Company,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,100
863,7971,eberkman,4.12,"Poured clear orange/gold into a snifter. Sticky white head, lots of lacing. A good looking beer.  Aroma is awesome. Huge, juicy ruby-red grapefruit from the Cascade hops. One of my favorite smells in the world.  Taste, however, while good, was a bit of a letdown. Not the citrus fest I was anticipating. But a nice malty backbone with good, powerful hop presence. Seemed to oddly lack some of the sweetness I associate with other DIPAs, like DFH90.  OK mouthfeel -- silky and oily. Drinkable in the sense that it's a good sipper and an interesting, complex beer. But it's a sipper, not a session beer.  Overall, a very good DIPA. But it didn't quite live up to its legendary billing. That said, I'm stoked to have had the opportunity to try it. You can't get it on the East Coast.",Russian River Brewing Company,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,100
863,7971,PittBeerGirl,4.27,"Thanks to Dlucky for this one. My first Russian River experience. Poured into my snifter.  A-Body is a nearly crystal clear vibrant amber and some bubbles can be seen rising to the top. Pours with a one finger foamy white head that quickly subsides to a thin collar but amazingly it leaves traces of lacing all the way down the glass.  S- While the foam is still present the nose is dominated by juicy citrus (grapefruit) hops. When the foam subsides a more spicy hop can be detected.  T- Upfront is lots of almost sweet juicy citrus (mostly grapefruit). Underneath is a hint of malt. Piny hop flavors rise for the finish. It leaves a medium strength residual bitterness behind...which can be overwhelming at first...but as you sip more it becomes more of an underlying spicy compliment to the juicy citrus flavors upfront. Very well done.  M- Medium carbonation and a smooth, somewhat oily, yet light body.  D- This is an excellent DIPA. I have been dying to try Russian River beers ever since I joined BA and this is my first one. I am looking forward to their other brews. This was unfortunately gone too fast. Did I mention that the alcohol was completely hidden?  Note: This is the only beer in my top 50 I am below the rdev on.",Russian River Brewing Company,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,100
863,7971,paco1029384756,4.87,"Pours a cloudy amber orange color with a small head and nice lacing.  Scent of sweet fruits and sour citrus. A huge and full scent without being over the top, marvelously balanced.  Taste is sharp and fruity with a huge hop character. Lemon, orange and mango primarily make up the fruity flavor while earthy malts compliment the hoppy bitterness. Goes down with a hoppy trail that fills the mouth. Finishes dry and malty, with the bitter lasting flavor of hops. Alcohol is very nearly unnoticeable, again superbly balanced.  Mouthfeel is light, clean and tight, very smooth traveling through the mouth.  Drinkability is very high, I can't get enough.  Awesome stuff, if I could find it locally I would buy it by the case, growler, pint, keg, or any other vessel I could find.

863,7971,mhewes,3.93,"A : Pours a nice clear golden color with a good head, not much lacing  S : Citrus and floral hops, a touch of malts  T : This one has a really strong malt backbone to it that I wasn't expecting. The hops were a lot more muted than I was expecting. You could still taste them (mainly citrus) but I was expecting more from it  M : Medium-bodied, good carbonation  D : Real easy to drink but I was disappointed in it after seeing how highly rated it was. To me, it didn't have that something special to make it stand out as being the best of the imperial IPAs out there.",Russian River Brewing Company,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,100
863,7971,waldowin,4.32,"Pours a murky golden amber, light becomes diffuse as the glass widens. Just a ring of head, eggshell white in color, lacing is nonexistent. Not surprising for a beer with this much hop juice, but not exceptional.  Smells of pine needles, cedar, and a hint of grapefruit. Very thick, like shoving your nose into a pine tree and breathing deep.  Taste is very mild on the tip of the tongue, and then swirls into a biting tang on the edges of your mouth. Just a small hint of malt in the form of grapes and malt in the center of the mouth, but no more than enough to let you know it's there. Finish is very dry and slightly acidic.  Mouthfeel is surprisingly not thinned out, for a beer with this much hop action. They didn't pound on the sugars to make it ""balanced"", it's just about right. Really surprising for a DIPA.  It's a very good DIPA, has more hops than you'll ever need, and tastes great. It's just so bitter and acidic, that more than one bottle would leave you with a sour stomach. Definitely worth a buy though!",Russian River Brewing Company,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,100
863,7971,mentor,3.65,"Pours a four finger yellowed head over a mildly hazed golden. Gorgeous frothy head clings and caves. Smells pink greapfruit pith, piney, grassy, and garlic.  Tastes potent hop flavored with noticable hop bitter and decent underlying malt sweet. Hop flavor consists of pith, grapefruit, garlic, tangerine, and oranges. Hop flavor is so strong that it comes across as a bit sour. Hop bitter is grassy and mixes with a clean alcohol. The alcohol dries the beer, despite a malt dextrinous. Malt flavor is absent, or at least buried under all the hop character. Md-light body and moderate carbonation. Decent, but I'm not seeing what all the hype is about.",Russian River Brewing Company,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,100
863,7971,madtappers,4.58,"Bought a bottle of this at my local bottle shop after reading all the rave reviews about this beer.  Poured clouded with a nice hop aroma, very drinkable IPA.

863,7971,Homer27,4.85,"I've been waiting over 3 years to try this beer, finally found some distributed to Seattle. I was ready for a letdown because of the hype I gave it internally but it put me in my place quickly. Like John Stewart on Karl Rove. This is the kind of beer that gets me excited as hell about beer. Not since the Stone 10th have I tasted a beer this good.  A: Light, a pale ale as the name suggests. Excellent lacing and head retention. My wife put her finger to her nose and was going for the head when a ruler smacked her knuckles.  S: Hops, Pine and I seem to be the only one that got an overwhelming smell of apple.  T: I am at a loss how they made this beer so hoppy and so smooth at the same time. Again the apple, pine, hops and citrus - mostly grapefruit.  M: Silky, but not syrup. Slight carbonation.  D: Drinks like a 6.5% max. I couldn't drink this all night but I couldn't drink anything above 6% all night. Incredibly smooth for a high ABV like this.  I'm very happy with this beer and will buy a case next time I see it.",Russian River Brewing Company,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,100
863,7971,dnichols,4.7,"Thanks to imacoug for sharing this fine beer with me. I served this brew into a 12 ounce mug.  A: It poured a cloudy reddish blond body with hints of amber. It had a moderate off-white head that was about a finger deep and lingered long into the drink. There was a healthy amount of lacing given the hefty ABV.  S: Nice blend of floral and flavoring hops. Exceedingly well balanced aroma with a decent presence of malts, citrus and pine aromas.  T: This was a wonderfully balanced IPA. It had a creamy malty and sweet front with a tangy citrusy accent (mostly grapefruit) and hints of pine.  M: It was medium to full bodied with a creamy and sweet front and edgy grapefruit bite. It finished very clean with little aftertaste.  D: It was a wonderful IPA, among the best I've tasted. It is a bit strong for a session beer but I would have no trouble going two to three deep before being forced to go elsewhere.",Russian River Brewing Company,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,100
863,7971,BeTheBall,4.77,"Poured from a bottle in to my Sam Adams glass.  A: Beautiful 2 finger foamy head topping a golden bubbly, semi-clear brew. Good lacing that would not stop.  S: The amazing West Coast hops smell of citrus, grass, resin and everything good about hops. The aroma on each sip was a pleasure.  T: Similar to the aroma; aromatic cirus notes, grassy. Bitterness in the back of the mouth and throat was well contained for such an amazing hops aroma. Some residual bitterness on the way down, but very, very smooth.  M: Coated the mouth well; lively carbonation.  D: Because the bitterness down the throat is so controlled, this is perhaps the smoothest IPA I've had, ever. To be able to have this incredible hops aroma and taste without knocking your palate with a hammer is truly a first for me. My new favorite of this style.",Russian River Brewing Company,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,100
863,7971,waltonc,4.32,"Bottle purchased from City Beer Store.  A: 31 millimeters of head. Orange with some haze, though certainly not opaque.  Smell and taste: Evergreens, orange and yellow-colored fruits, and whack quantities of hops. I ordinarily dislike such ridiculous hoppiness, but can make an exception for such a well-done IPA.  Although PTE is very good, I must admit I don't understand what the obsession seems to be.

Excellent retention and intricate lacework on the sides of my glass. Tons of carbonation. Very pretty  S: I've had this before, from a bottle, on tap and from a growler and every single time, I'm a happy man. Tons of hops - floral, citrus and pine. The pine is a lot more assertive than i remember it being but the delicate citrus aroma with oranges and sweet tangerines and floral notes are present and gorgeous. Excellent  T: Starts off with a sharp pine hops with citrus hops coming through adding the distinctive touch of grapefruit and orange zest. Malt is non-existent and this is a hop tour de force all the way. Excellent hop bouquet. Finishes dry, resiny and hoppy  M: Wonderful resiny hops coat the palate while the carbonation works perfectly, bursting little hop globules on my tongue and the drying finish? perfect  D: So much for savoring this. This one's disappearing all too soon :-(  Notes: I think god's playing a big practical joke.

863,7971,koopa,4.5,"Received a couple of bottles through a trade with Slayer3604  Appearance: pale gold to light orange depending on your room lighting. Not much lacing but lots of head retention!  Smell: Just a beautiful bouquet of floral hops, a slight grapefruit hop smell, pine, perfume, and the faintest hint of orange. Well done!  Taste: I'm getting some grapefruit up front with the pine and floral qualities coming next. Finally another wave of grapefruit hits as the floral qualities subside. This is a tasty west coast IPA for sure! Really loving it. Especially because there isn't a sweet malt profile to detract from it.  Mouthfeel: Creamy, decent carbonation, with fruit sweetness from the hops balancing everything in the absence of a sweet malt profile.  Drinkability: Wonderful despite the 8% abv  Please Note: Pliny changes quite a bit as it ages and really is best enjoyed as fresh as possible. I've sampled bottles that were 2-3 weeks old and they have extra bitterness about them that opens up in the 4-6 week age range. By about 10-12 weeks old this beer seems really degraded in my personal opinion.",Russian River Brewing Company,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,100

Aroma is beautiful...nice citrus (oranges and grapefruit) dominate the nose, with some pineapple, pine, some malty carmel and a nice breadiness. Wow this is the best smelling DIPA i have ever come across.  Flavor is amazing...bold citrus hits me as soon as it hits the lips, pine, caramel and the breadiness. Nice bitterness from the hops, this is so balanced.  Smooth, creamy mouthfeel texture with a bit of oily hops. The bitterness hangs around just long enough, then it smooths out.

863,7971,roan22,4.85,"My pint appeared to be a gold orangey color. The head dissapated fairly quickly but I knew it was fresh because of the lovely aromas.  The aromas were brilliant, like an herbal green plant, not quite pine, not quite citrus, but an herbal spicy balance of all three.  The taste was very smooth, hops tasted citrusy like oranges. A great zesty bitterness was there, and it never tasted too tart or too bitter. The malts tasted perfect and the balance acheived in this DIPA is quite phenominal.  The taste of fresh Pliney the Elder really impressed me because unlike every other DIPA I have had, it was not too sweet or too boozy on my palate. Very pleasant, very confident beer. It tasted as if it had been brewed for 100 years.  The only way the mouthfeel could improve, would be to throw in a little more of the hops that cause the long lasting bitterness after a sip. That would make it a 5 star beer for me. But I agree it is world class, an excellently brewed.  At 8% it is absolutely at the extreme end of my tolerance, so drinkability gets marked down just a touch.

A: A light medium caramel colored liquid with one to two inch head , that remains long after pour, with reasonable lacing that clings pleasantly to the glass. S: scent of pine or forest like smell but in a good way. It's the kind of beer you imagine having at a summer bbq but better. The smell is neither over powering or to weak but just right the barely and hops are balanced perfectly. M: I noticed the carbonation mostly immediately after my first gulp I had to do manly custom and burp. The beer was a thin liquid neither clung to the mouth or left a bad after taste. T: well I believe I already mentioned, but to restate it amazing. I want one now as I'm typing this review.

863,7971,MiScusi,4.88,"A- no double IPA ever looks better than this. Clear rich Golden in color, generous white head. It can also look very pale yellow or orangish depending on the lighting.  S- sweet sticky pine. No DIPA comes close to the appeal of this smell.  T- Starts out with a light tasting pale malt combined with sweet hop resin. Citrus flavored hops try to poke through the pine cuts through it. Lingering pine and bitterness in the finish.  M- slick but not too slick. Still light enough to enjoy without it feel like you're drinking syrup like lots of other DIPA's out there.  D- self explanitory.  I have had this beer numerous times on tap (at Russian River brewpub and locally in So. Cal), and a handful of times from the bottle now. This bottled version is close enough to the fresh tap version for me. Fresh tap might be just a bit more intense in flavor and aroma. But there's no debating with me that any DIPA even comes close to displaying the hops and not letting the the malt interfere too much and create a cloyingly sweet hop soup like plenty of other DIPA's out there. Ok, maybe it's neck and neck with Alpine's Pure Hoppiness :)",Russian River Brewing Company,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,100

Piney, resinous, buscuity malt, spearmint, hints of citrus. Beautifully balanced! First taste is very solid! Carmel sweetness, bready malts give way to piney, slightly spicy / peppery hops. Not incredibly complex but something amazingly simple about it strikes my fancy. Just the slightest bit of alcohol on the finish. Soapy, solid mouthfeel.

863,7971,GilGarp,4.45,"Pours from a 500ml bottle into the Sam Adams glass. Lots of warnings all over the bottle telling me to enjoy it now, not later. The dude abides...  Pours a golden orange color with lots of head that sticks around and leaves awesome lacing. Good, but not perfect, clarity.  Aroma is full of fresh hops, pine, lemons, limes, and a hint of sweetness like honey or maybe brown sugar.  Flavor is excellent too. Grassy up front followed by bitterness and it finishes slightly sweet. Nicely balanced for a double IPA, it never feels like an attack on my taste buds.  Mouthfeel is good but a little high on alcohol and the bitterness gets me in the back of my cheeks.  Drinkability is very good for a beer of this high hoppiness and ABV.

Rest assured, that you are unlikely to be disappointed if and when you get a chance to try it. Its a textbook example of what a DIPA should be, with a terrific hoppy smell and taste, while mantaining an excellent balance.

From the orange/pine aroma to the BIG citrus hop smack in the mouth to the lively body and the oh so smooth yet assertive body. This beer has it all in the realm of cream of the crop DIPA's!  PtE is,without a doubt, one of the Godfathers of the West Coast DIPA revolution. Along with the sadly retired Frank's of Pizza Port fame, PtE is one of the greatest beers of it's style, plain and simple. All beers in this genre can only hope to be mentioned in the same breath.  I flat out love this beer. I have absolutely nothing negative to say about it. From the hops to the body to the quaffable 8% aspect...it ROCKS!  So, if you are lucky enough to to get a pint, or six, of this wonderful nectar do not hesitate! Grab one and enjoy! Pliny the Elder is about as close to perfection as a West Coast DIPA gets!

863,7971,Brewlore,4.8,"Bottled on date of 8.25.08, imbibed 09.03.08  Having this on tap several times I'm quite curious to see how it holds in bottle form.  Poured a nice clear orange/amber color that soon formed a nice white head. The head however, quickly ran away and left a ring of lacing. A very attractive beer.  The aroma is outstanding. I got a huge whiff of it while pouring. A plethora of hop scents abound. There's a sweetness in the aroma as well (that'll probably be the malt). Big grapefruit and pine coming from the hops. Hint of orange (citrus) coming through a bit providing a slightly sweet scent too.  The taste has more of the aforementioned qualities but is a bit heavier on the pine traits. Surely not a bad thing. The bitterness I felt was very smooth. It didn't attack and maul you. It was more like being hunted then slowly being picked apart by hop beasts. Lightly spicy in the end, a quenching combo of pine, citrus, and some floral hops again but is flanked by a nice touch of the sweet bready malts.  Light to medium body and feels great on the palate. A bit lively too.  For hop lovers this beer is easily drinkable. It's quite potent at 8% but the alcohol is well hidden. Careful with the Elder.  Of course, having this on tap is where it's at, but trapping Pliny in the bottle is still damned good. One of my favorite DIPA's. It's a real treat to imbibe the elder.",Russian River Brewing Company,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,100

863,7971,Domingo,4.64,"I've had this a few times at the yearly GABF, but it's always hard to tell how great something may or may not be based on samples. Luckily this is now bottled and in the Denver area. This brew is somewhere between bronze and copper with a nice amount of head, but not too overbearing or rocky. This beer is all about hops...I mean a TON of them. Piney, grapefruit, pineapple, but still having a european floral presence in the background, too. There's even a little of the whole leaf spearmint in there, too. It's a hop tour-de-force, but it doesn't get tiring or overwhelming either. The malt doesn't really play a role here, but for some reason it has enough backbone to keep everything drinkable. For an 8% brew, this goes down really easy. No burn or overblown sweetness. This rocks. If you want to get something hoppy that isn't freakishly sweet or boozy, this is IT. This is *the* hoppy beer.",Russian River Brewing Company,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,100
863,7971,murdoch22,4.64,"Pours a short-lived coarse foam; some lingering fizz on the glass, and a very unusual orange color, with more red than most pales.  Smell it once; it's an IPA. Smell it again, carefully, deeply. Go on and get your nose in it--you're not going to get hurt. Yes, you'll be smelling hops for the next three days, but what else? I think shampoo manufacturers would call that essence ""botanical."" As a beer drinker who's had more than one tonight, i call it ""hops dragged through a field of mint."" Sure, there's the familiar grapefruit smell, but some sweetness, some chlorophyll, and some other unidentifiable elements come through.  It's smoother and more complex than most IPAs, especially imperial IPAs, which can suffer from being too strong, too sour, and too well-reviewed. There's a vague sense of citrus that you'll look for every time you sip it, since it's so fleeting, but so pleasant. It doesn't come off as being as strong as it is...does that add or subtract from the drinkability score?  As far as drinkability, there's a continuum, running between ""session"" and ""imperial."" Those which advertise themselves as ""imperial"" are far too strong to be drinking for hours on end. They are special examples of brewers' skill which should be sampled and enjoyed occasionally, and which most definitely don't lend themselves to excessive consumption. Though i wouldn't drink more...well, not much more...than a bottle's worth of this in a sitting, i can't get enough of it. I keep wanting to remind myself of the brilliance and complexity of this masterful beer, as well as to renew its flavor on the palate, which fades to a bitter (but not unpleasant) flavor of grapefruit rind, given a few minutes of typing without drinking.

Pliny is elegant and calm - a nice looking DIPA  smell: very aromatic as expected - pungent grapefruit pulp, citrus hopping, light pine. This beer has that bubblegum trait that i commonly pick up in 3 floyds beers that provides another nice twist on the nose  taste: The flavor profile is all hops highlighted by a bright (not bitter) grapefruit presence, lemon zest, bubble gum, tropical fruits and other citrus hopping. Alcohol presence is pretty minimal and the bitterness is low enough to make this insanely drinkable and one of the flagships of the style  mouthfeel: on the lighter side of my expectations, vibrant and alive on the tongue with less than full bitterness  drinkability: great",Russian River Brewing Company,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,100
863,7971,BigJTrucker,4.33,"Now that Russian River distributes to Oregon, I get the chance to try this popular brew. Pours a beautiful copper color, thick white head with heavy lacing. Nice grapefruity aroma is just right. Taste is lots of citrusy bitter hops up front but seems to get piney as I drink more, low alcohol presence, and a healthy bit of malt sweetness. Mouthfeel is very sticky as a good DIPA should be. A very, very, very good beer. Well done Vinnie.",Russian River Brewing Company,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,100
863,7971,itcomesnpints,4.9,I was lucky enough to find this beauty at the Falling Rock Tap House in Denver. F%&$ing fantastic. Bright golden orange with a great white head. Spectacular lacing that never stops clinging. Citrus and floral aromas combine with hops to clobber the nose. Immense hop tang mixed with grapefruit and pineapple glide smoothly over the palate. The most drinkable DIPA I have found yet. Pliny The Elder is simply unrivaled among DIPAs. Perhaps my favorite beer of any style. My hat off and a full bow to Russian River Brewing Company for possibly one of the best ales I've ever come across.,Russian River Brewing Company,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,100
863,7971,Tolann,4.87,"A - Cloudy and orange. I poured slowly since this beer is so turbid, so not much head. Still a gorgeous beer.  S - Sweet, clean Citrus Hops. Certainly plenty of grapefruit.  T - OMG wonderful! I could drink this for ever. The nose doesn't lie. Wonderful hops and lots of sweet wonderful citrus. Pure happiness in a glass, even after the day I had at work, the world is right.  M - My tastebuds are paralyzed by hops. This is a good thing tho. There'd not too long of an aftertaste, so your taste does calm down so you can want more... and more... and more Light/medium mouth feel. Not too much carbonation that would almost burn with this much hops. This is more balanced in the feel with the taste.  D - I'd drink this all nite, never get tired of it, but I think the abv would get the best of me. LOL So so very good tho and I must get more!",Russian River Brewing Company,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,100
863,7971,Beerbuddha,4.5,"Appearance- Nice golden copper color with a descent size white, fluffy head. Lacing was present and stayed throughout the life of the beer.  Smell- Pine. Straight up pine trees. Also has notes of citrus(oranges and grapefruit) and a pleasing maltiness.  Taste- Imagine running through a forest, let's say your being chased by a monster or something(I know, just follow me here ok), and all of a sudden BAM you run right into a bushel of pine tree branches and it all gets into your mouth. Got it? Ok it tastes like that. A pine tree Mike Tyson punch to your mouth. Once you get past the pine tree extravaganza you get a nice hint of citrus and herbs.  Mouthfeel- A little lacking here. It was a bit thin and watery. The carbonation is medium which is nice.  Overall- OK I'm not a big IPA fan but I did my best to judge this beer properly. I had hoped for more balance between hops and malts but as far as DIPAs go I would say this is one of the best I've ever had. At 8% it makes for a very drinkable(sessionable) beer and I'm extremely excited to have been able to try it. Big thanks go out to my boy Devon who brought this back from his trip to Napa.",Russian River Brewing Company,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,100
863,7971,lightindarkness,4.65,"thanks swnicholson. Thanks.  Pours slightly hazy gold with a climbing fluffy off white head thinning out to sticky lacy bubbles.  Big sticky juicy pine, grapefruit, and nectarine crowd the nose, like cramming a pine cone and a grapefruit up each nostril. Sugary sweetness weaves through the juicy full aroma. Couldn't be this hoppy without a stiff resin in the background.  A hop delight on the taste buds. Spicy dry grainy hop flavors aren't overly sappy or syrupy. A lighter malt balance allows the hops to show through in all their glory, with a surprisingly delicate character despite their strength. Good grain presence without being caramelly or sweet, though deepening in the middle with some more intense grainy/hoppy flavor as it warms. Dry bitterness sits back on the tongue and seems to accumulate with each sip. Really nice blend of hop and grain into one incredible flavor.  Feel is nice, medium bodied with a submissive yet present carbonation. Dries out at the finish with a nice touch of alcohol fume resonating, but not detracting from the overall feel.  I must note that the bitterness keeps me from sipping it quickly, but the flavor and overall character cause me to keep wanting more.",Russian River Brewing Company,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,100

T - Initial harsh hops, melts into sweet malt, then back to dry bittering at end. Makes you want another sip...now.  M - It's a party. Nice roundness in the mouth, all the sensors touched. Medium to full body, great coating and carbonation.  D - I could drink this one until bad things happened. Happy suds.",Russian River Brewing Company,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,100
863,7971,sevopie,4.8,"Appearance - Bronze-gold in color with a creamy white head.  Smell - Muted piney hops with a sweet character.  Taste - Smokey sweet and piney hops, I can instantly see why this is so sought after. Malt makes an appearance, but only for show, along with a touch of honey/caramel.  Mouthfeel - Just slightly lighter than the Blind Pig, still very oily and smooth, and slightly lighter on the carbonation.  Drinkability - Oh lordy... this is a fantastically easy drinking DIPA. The bitter does not overwhelm, and it sits just right on the tongue. I hope this is here to stay in Denver.",Russian River Brewing Company,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,100

Here goes!  This beer pours a beautiful orangey/amber color with a creamy inch and a half off white head. Nice retention and some spotty lacing.  The aroma is truly great. A big hoppy nose boasting some nice citrus tones. A honey like sweetness presents itself and gives way to a sappy pine.  The taste is quite nice. A great hoppiness showing off some nice citrus qualities in addition to a bit of pine. A nice bittering bite on the finish.  Mouthfeel is medium bodied, pretty creamy, and very lightly carbonated.

T- Citrus and hoppy, ending with honey changing slowly to let the bitterness make a barely present home on the back of your tongue.  M- Medium mouthfeel, with a slight slickness to it.

The aroma is piney resiney floral hops with some sweet caramel malt and a little fruitiness.  The flavor is sweet caramel malts initially with a little bright citric fruitiness that is quickly followed by a good sized piney peppery hop bite the lingers in the finish. This is excellent tasting and pretty well balanced (a little hop forward, but not a big messy hop bomb). The mouthfeel is medium to full bodied with a velvety texture.  Overall, an excellent and well balanced DIPA!",Russian River Brewing Company,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,100
863,7971,rye726,4.8,"A beautifull brew, pours a rich copper brown with a silky tan head. Excellent lace. The nose has a great balance between the hops and sweet malts.

863,7971,Bitterbill,4.2,"I was only able to snag one bottle for myself; I'm sure it'll be easier to find in CO in the future.  Let me preface this by saying that I've had samples of this brew at a few GABFs and along side Pliny The Younger, I thought this one played second fiddle.  A nice medium gold in colour with a good 2 finger bilowy head of foam. Good head retention as well as good lacing.  The smell is massively hoppy. Lots of grapefruit and mango with other bitter fruit notes along with pine and..well..I don't perceive any malt presence at all but I *expected* that.  The taste has all of the hop characters I mentioned in the smell with just the slightest ""hint"" of some malt. Maybe that will change as I get further into the session.  The mouthfeel is nice at medium though at times, it feels more like light, and there's some oily slickness on the tongue. The carbonation is on the high end of light but that's working very nicely here. For an 8%abv brew, I think RR did well to hide it..probably because the flavours are too powerful for me to notice it. ;^)  Man, this is one bitter brew! I'm halfway done with my glass and the malt can still only be called as having a ""meek"" role. Still, this one is and was all about the hops and in that, they've succeeded to the nth degree and I was just in the mood for a good, bitter DIPA but I don't think I could drink this on a regular basis as it's just palate ""destroying"". I think I prefer Blind Pig but that's just me...",Russian River Brewing Company,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,100

863,7971,bluemoonswoon,4.72,"Big big thanks to BrewerB for hooking me up with not one but two of these bottles.  500mL bottle with some instructions, though more along the lines of demands, to drink this beer fresh and I would say that I am giving it a pretty good shot at this beer was bottled on 7/30 of this year.  A: Pours a clear amber copper and topped with a creamy inch and a half of pure white head. Little flecks of yeast float here and there. After a bit the head settless into a ring but about a half inch of head can be brought back with a swirl of the glass. Some lacing but not much.  S: I swear this beer and Dreadnaught must be related because they smell so wonderfully similar. Rich ripe magno, fresh grapefruit, lemony pine all brought together under a gloriously rich candi and slightly medicinal bittersweetness. To say this beer smells amazing would be an understatement there is something almost magical about the way this smells, and it seems to smell a little different each time I go back to the glass for another sniff.  T/MF: Very strong pine to begin with, I mean like water that was strained through pine needles strong, midway through a mixture of lemon and alcohol play together and as the first sip closes I am left with a strong medicinol and herbal hop character. Subsequent sips reveal a dense piny nuttiness backed by seriously bitter and sticky hop goodness, there seems to be absolutly no malt character to this beer, I mean I feel like this beer is playing tricks on my mind, there is a kind of nutty almost earthy sweetness that I want to imagine as maltiness but I don't think that is right, I think that the hops are doing everything in their power to grab a hold of your tongue and not let go. Mouthfeel is thick and full bodied and has the absoulutly perfect amount of carbonation to keep things from getting too boring. The finish is insanly long and leaves the tongue coated in a thick layer that smacks of hop resin. While this beer might smell like Dreadnaught it certainly tastes like a different animal and given time to warm the smell changes as well. Things become ever more piny and but there is coupled with this an undercurrent of grapefruit and orange and lemon rind that provides an incredible complexity to this beer. This is certainly one of the most interesting beers I've ever had the privilege of tasting.  D: The bitterness on this beer is off the charts. I normally think of myself as someone who can handle just about anything that you can throw at me but I think this is just about the bitterest thing I've ever tasted, not bitter like a pickle is bitter but a sour, back of the throat kind of bitter that is unrelenting. In terms of style it is unparalleled, it is like nothing I've ever tried before, the further I get into this beer the more it changes, I keep wanting to go back again and again for another sip just to try and pull out more flavors. There is a grainy kind of taste that I think is a result of how bitter this beer is and it is slightly off putting but I've tasted it in other DIPAs before. This has been the hardest beer for me to judge. I'd say it lives up to the hype but unlike the Dreadnaught I think I'd be okay with just a bottle of this while I could drink the Dreadnaught all night long. But then again this beer is like nothing else I've ever tasted before, incredibly fresh and incredibly tasty.",Russian River Brewing Company,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,100
863,7971,emerge077,4.3,"Finally, the illustrious Elder sits in the glass in front of me...  Orange body with more yellow-orange tones toward the base of the glass. Micro sediment hangs in suspension. Bits of spotty lace around the edge, with a good skim of foam, nice retention.  Juicy citrus aroma, sweet cotton candy, juicyfruit gum. Some resiny hop oils in the back. Nothing but rich fruity hops in this one!  Initial sips are bitter, some floral hop and grainy malt notes, tropical fruitiness, with a long earthy finish. Maltiness is huge, which performs a balancing act with the large hop load. Alcohol is slightly perceptible. Smooth and creamy feel, light astringency that is not a distraction. A fine savory beverage...  Dreadnaught is still my #1 DIPA, but PtE is a close #2. Huge thanks to Jason for the trade!",Russian River Brewing Company,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,100

I am(or at least wasn't) a big IPA fan, but after trying this I may be converted.  A: orange and extremely clear. I can't speak to the head as I was puring into small 5 oz sample glasses.(I took a few bottes to a local bar for an impromptu tasting)  S: Pine cones and grapefruit. The aroma on this one is amazing. The smell alone brought people over from the other side of the bar.  M: Crisp with good carbonation.  T: A lot like the smell. Pine needles and grapefruit up front with a bit of lemon and a slight hoppy bitterness towards the end. Extremely dry and tasty.  D: Excellent. If it were in my area I would make it a regular in my rotation. Smooth and crisp. No alcohol taste at all.  As stated earlier this beer may have converted me to IPA/DIPAs.

Taste is a strong pine resin up front but finishes with a grapefruit citrus flavor.  Medim body and leaves a solid hops after taste. Definitely for the hop-heads. A solid DIPA to be sure.

863,7971,BradLikesBrew,4.97,"After years of waiting, a Russian River brew is finally in my glass.  From the Russian River website:  Pliny the Elder was a Roman naturalist, scholar, historian, traveler, officer, and writer. Although not considered his most important work, Pliny and his contemporaries created the botanical name for hops, ""Lupus salictarius"", meaning wolf among scrubs."" Hops at that time grew wild among willows, much like a wolf in the forest.  a: Orange body, very clear. Creamy white head with little lacing.  s: Could be the best IPA nose I have encountered. Oily hop esters, resiny, sweet, pungent, sublime.  t: A seamless melding of hops and malt, incredible integration. I cannot detect where one ends and the other begins. I do know that after swallowing, I am left with a wonderful latent bitterness on my palate. Super piney, citrusy, oily, resiny alpha acid karma. Grapefruit, lemon, and a hint of pineapple. All of the complex deliciousness you could ask for from hops.  Wow, I just found my favorite beer.  m: I have never had a beer this hoppy be this smooth. Despite the monster hop bill, it had no real hop bite, just pure goodness.  d: I have been building this up in my mind and was worried I would inevitably be let down. Instead, my expectation have been surpassed. Buy this if you can. If you can't, I will trade, but damn it, if you have not had this beer, you need to, now. I guess I know what my Staff Pick will be at work.",Russian River Brewing Company,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,100
863,7971,corey0212,4.84,"Got this in a trade with Georgiabeer!!  Pours a relatively clear light-copper/orange color, foamy off-white head loosely forms and fades pretty quickly, leaving a thin layer of foam with some bigger bubbles around the edge of the glass, nice patchy lacing. This is probably the most pine hop aroma I've encountered in a beer....piney hops just leap out of the glass, and pretty much dominate the nose, though there are some sweet malty aromas as well. Taste is just explosively hoppy....spicy, sticky, resinous pine taste, bitter grapefruit, tangerine, and some delicate caramel sweetness. The mouthfeel seems a touch thin for an Imperial IPA, but in the context of the flavors in this beer, it's perfect, with a slight stickiness, and lingering bitterness that doesn't overpower you. So glad I got this in a trade, and this is a beer that'll stay permanently on my ""wants"" list. Should Russian River ever decide to distribute in MA, this would always be in my fridge.

S- A rush of everything citrus that includes grapefruit, orange peel, and ground up lemon peel. It touched on sweet as well, there was a grip of wildflower honey, and subdued red licorice as well.  T- Bouquets of floral hops, ceder, pine, incredable balance of dry acidity thats counter ballanced by a rush of malt depth thats hard to find these days.  M- big bodied, bold, and fat on the pallet.

Spruce bark, peach skins, mango pulp, orange zest, and sugar-dusted grapefruit. Mild malt notes mingle with a slight alcohol waft.  On the chewy side of medium bodied, with a sticky, almost sappy mouthfeel. Still very dry and crisp though.  Bitter citrus fruits and light malt lead off the pallet. Grapefruit, pine resin, orange rind, and mangoe pit. Somewhat earthy and leafy, with a persisting, drying bitterness. A grapefruit at the foot of a pine tree.

Taste was light bitterness in front palate, then slightly sweet in middle with a bready toasted yeast strain that had old character to it. With a nice lingering bitter finish.

Nose is filled with huge citrus hops: predominately grapefruit, and also pineapple. Also a hint of pine and just a touch of grassiness.  The flavor is filled with hops, but not overpowering. The malts are pretty well masked, though a touch of caramel peeks through, and the citrus provides for just a little bit of sweetness to make this thing exceptionally smooth.  Smooth is the only way to describe the mouthfeel on this bad boy. It somehow manages to feel soft and velvety yet crisp at the same time, with decent carbonation and a fairly heavy body.

S: Plenty of citrus in this one. Vast amounts of grapefruit, orange, and lemon. The hops smell amazing in this one, very abundant.  T: The taste is immaculate, but I can't say this is better than many other DIPAs I have had. Tons of citrus in the flavor from the hops.

The bottle clearly states do not age, drink immediately. I waited all the way until lunch to crack it open. One long ass wait, I tell you what!  Of course it pours a beautiful clear golden light orange with nice white head and wispy lacing. Looks great!  This puppy has aroma! Filled my dining area before I even tried to sniff. I'm trying to take a few notes on appearance and this sucker is socking me in the nose. Powerful scent of really, really, expensive marijuana. Like imported from Hawaii or Jamaica marijuana. Just speculating! What can I say... that's what it smells like! Do a side by side if you don't believe me. Also smells like a pine forest, an alpine camping trip, smells awesome.  From the smell, I expected a little more hop flavor, not that its lacking. So this is what balanced means. I taste pine, hops, maybe grapefruit. Tastes great, but to be honest, smells even better.  Smooth, full, without a doubt one helluva beer. I would definitely get this anywhere it was served (security would have to escort me out) and if I ever see it on a shelf I will buy every bottle.

863,7971,SaucyA,4.25,"Oh, Pliny... how I've longed to try thee.  A - Looks awesome in my snifter. Great 1 finger frothy head, with a glowing orange/gold body. Fine lacing.  S - Piney, west-coast hops abounds. Pliny the piney. Grapefruity undertones. Wonderful in this department. True DIPA.  T - For what it's worth, the taste is slightly a let down. Wonderfully well-hopped, but not quite as bitter as I had anticipated or hoped. Well-balanced if not a little underdone. I have a feeling on-tap this is a grand slam, but as it is right here, it's ""just"" a home run.  M - Medium bodied with a decent amount of carbonation. On the thicker side of things.  D - Pretty stellar drinkability. Almost as easy as a standard IPA.  Notes: Mad thanks to Carlos for this as an extra (can you believe it??)! For all the hype surrounding this brew, I think it left me slightly underwhelmed, but then again, this is/was one of the most hyped brews out there.  To put it in beer perspective, if it was this or Hopslam, i'd definitely have a hard time choosing. I might give the edge to Hopslam strictly for the price. If it was this or Big Head, I would reach for the Big Head. I'm a homewtown boy :)",Russian River Brewing Company,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,100
863,7971,jordoo,4.82,"500ml bottle poored into a pilsner glass. Thanks to Rick for sending this one my way.  Its an orange straw colored body topped with an electric white creamy head that last and is a lace monster. The smell is simply dynamic. Its crazy pine and like every citrus fruit you can think of with a highlight on the sour ones, incredibly strong smell. The taste is more of the same with a sweet malt backdrop that is there if you pay attention. There are also some piney and grassy hop notes especially on the finish. Medium/full body with some hop oil. Well its pretty much all its cracked up to be, which is tough when there is so much hype.",Russian River Brewing Company,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,100
863,7971,ckeegan04,4.77,A - Dark orange-brown color with a thick foamy off-white head. Excellent retention and lacing.  S - Strong citrusy hop aroma with hints of grapefruit and pineapple. Hop heads dream in the nose.  T - Lives up to the hype. Strong citrusy/tropical blast of grapefruit and pineapple just like the nose. Light malty sweetness lies underneath to provide just a little balance which is exactly how I like them.  M/D - Medium to full bodied and such high resinous hop taste that it just coats your mouth and leaves you with that bitter cant wait for me taste.,Russian River Brewing Company,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,100
863,7971,hiikeeba,4.15,"A - Pours up an amber yellow with a thick, dense head that lasts forever.  S - Smells like I opened a bag of hops for brewing. Very fresh. Mostly Cascade, I think.  T - Tastes exactly like it smells: Hop juice. It is almost overpowering. Leaves a bitter ring around the back of my throat but it doesn't linger too long.  M - Mouthfeel is the last thing you notice because of all the hops, but this is a full bodied beer.  D - Not sure I would order a second pint. It's good, but strong.",Russian River Brewing Company,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,100
863,7971,OlieIPA,4.87,"I picked up and tasted this beer at Hollingshead's Delicatessen...which I might add...is an awesome place to visit for all those who get all giddy when it comes to the sight of quality beer. Anyways, let me get to the review...  Appearance: Dark-gold to light-amber color with good head. Lacing was also excellent.  Smell: Had a very complex aroma....incredible balance of malt and hop smell.  Taste: Probably the most balanced Imperial IPA I have ever taste. Just like the smell, the taste was exceptionally complex. Again, had malt sweetness and hop bitterness....neither dominated each other...but both were apparent.  Mouthfeel: Moderate carbonation...very easy on the mouth and throat.  Drinkability: The easiest to down and most enjoyable Imperial IPA I have enjoyed.  Overall: The thing I enjoyed the most about this beer is the balance and complexity it had. Almost perfect.",Russian River Brewing Company,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,100
863,7971,brdc,4.25,"Thanks ricand for this one. Bottled 07/29/08; so again, as fresh as I will ever get; shipped overnight. Medium sized capped bottle, poured into a tulip.  Quite dark golden, near brown, good white head with decent lacing and retention. Intense, fruity hop aroma, but this one has a nice caramel maltiness coming along; not as one-sided as the blind pig felt just before. Citrusy, oranges again, piney, grapefruits and a lot more. Nice caramel comes and goes. Similar taste, medium to full bodied, mostly hoppy and bitter just like the aroma suggested, but caramel and bread make some appearacnes to balance it a bit more. Nicely done, better balanced than the blind pig; both quite good, this one close to dreadnaught. Body is a bit lighter, not as much depth, but that also enhances drinkability.",Russian River Brewing Company,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,100
863,7971,kkipple,4.19,"I was holding out on ole review #300 for something special, and I suppose this'll have to do. Poured from a new 500ml bottle hauled back from Cali.  A. Rich hazy copper, low white head that leaves some lace. Still and quiet-looking. Not bad at all. Looks almost exactly like Blind Pig.  S. Oh my. An immense hop punch to the nose. Extremely fresh, bitter hops practically leap out of the glass. Resiny and dank, almost... ok, rather a bit ganja-like. Both pungent and eye-opening. Further in I get notes of orange and citrus, wrapped into a pleasing sweet malty undercurrent. The hops reign supreme here, and promise greatness. Superb nose.  T. Alas, after such a superlative smell, how could the taste hold up? Sadly, it doesn't, but there's still a fine beer here. It's obviously hoppy and bitter, with complex grapefruit / grass / herbal flavors blending around a rather thin and unassuming mildly sweet malt base. It's good, to be sure, but lacks ""oomph"", if you know what I mean.  M. Thin and a bit watery, finish is lightly dry and wonderfully bitter. Carbonation is medium-low, and lends to easy drinking.  Qualms aside, I honestly wish I had more of this. It's a fantastic smelling, ""lite"" Double IPA that is easy to put down. At 8% it'd make a killer mini-session beer. Pity it's not more available.

Appearance: Orangey, lovely bubbly head that lines the side the glass as you drink.  Smell: This is were I just lose my self, my nose just wants to live within this beer. An amazing rush of green, citrus, spice... just bombs the nose but doesn't over power, just takes over it.  Taste: My tongue went numb? Seriously this brew is over the top! Think bitterness and spice and ... well my tongue threw up! It's a nice over powering flavor I've never found before. I would eat the smelliest cheese one could find just to combat this brew.  Mouthfeel: What feeling!? I can't feel anything!?! But I still find myself drink this smooth, round spicy well carbonation beauty of a brew.  Drinkability: A great treat, drank fresh (as the bottle notes) and more often if not for the strength of the brew.",Russian River Brewing Company,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,100

Moderate spotty lacing and a half-collar remain, with soapy wisps after every swirl.  'THE AROMA! oh glory. you can't imagine unless you've smelled this. Gotta be some Summit in there, but it's full... acidic, pineapple, mango, green onion, citrus, and... marijuana, actually. mmm.  taste is of tropical fruits (pineapple and mango) with a bit of citrus and pine-sap towards the end. The lingering bitterness is excellent.  Mouthfeel is medium with relatively low carbonation and an odd almost fuzziness, like a mango which really adds to the illusion of tropical fruits.

863,7971,Tdizzle,4.77,"Purchased at Hollingshead's. Bottled on 7/30/08 and consumed on 8/14/08.  A- Poured from a 500mL bottle into a New Belgium globe glass, this beer pours a hazy amber color with a sticky, slightly off-white head that settles to a thin layer over the beer, leaving some thick, cloud-like lacing after each sip.  S- The aroma is teeming with piney and grapefruity hops that are supported by tropical fruits and some nice malty sweetness. There's very little alcohol presence.  T- At first, the taste is intensely bitter with very little malt backing to even it out. But as the beer warms, the malt backbone begins to come through. This is one of the purest hop flavors I have ever tasted in a beer. The piney bitterness strongly lingers on the back of the tongue long after each sip.  M- The mouthfeel of this beer is good. It's oily and slick, but it still feels just a touch on the light side for a beer that is this hoppy. The moderate carbonation adds a nice lively touch.  D- This beer was a joy to drink, and I found myself wishing that I had a bigger bottle. The 8% ABV isn't even a factor in this category.  This is the best double IPA, and one of the best beers, that I have ever had.",Russian River Brewing Company,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,100

S- The aroma is filled with fresh resinous hops, out of this world and just begs you to drink it.  T- All I can say is wow! The taste like the aroma is dominated by the fresh bitter hop flavors. Definitely not the hoppiest beer I have ever had, but it is plenty bitter and the hop flavors are so damn good!  M- The mouthfeel is really smooth, not too thick or too thin. Just perfect!  D- Wow! This is one hell of a beer, and I would definitely put it in my top 5. Pliny The Elder is a world class DIPA, and well worth the hype.",Russian River Brewing Company,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,100
863,7971,IBUnit63,4.59,"Thanks to Joey from South Bay Drugs for keeping this in stock concurrent with our Coronado family trip-poured into Coronado Brewing pint glass...  Golden honey body with sparse visible carbonation and ample head with nice texture and lacing.  Of course I can smell the hops without trying. Very sweet, oily, bountiful hop aroma with velvety caramel malt backbone. Faint alcohol serves as a binder (or a catalyst). Can't get better than this.  Of course the floral hops dominate but there's a malt nuttiness-almost peanut brittle-that mixes with the mild alcohol essence to create beautiful chemistry.  Deep, well balanced yet hop-bitter citrus grapefruit puckering finish mellowed well by velvety caramel malt. First pour could use a little more carbonation to bring out all elements but warmth takes care of this.  One of the best-a stellar example of the style.",Russian River Brewing Company,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,100
863,7971,ddarden,4.42,"Thanks Thimbledrome for this one. Bottled on 7/10/2008 poured into a tulip glass.  It is a hazy golden, straw color with puffy white head that recedes very slowly. Smell is all hops...pine, grapefruit, and a little alcohol. The taste is a nice smack of hops and quickly fades to a malty flavor and back to hops at the end. The end of this beer is very dry, like the alcohol just evaporates everything in your mouth. It is much thinner than I expected and does not coat the tongue like a lot of DIPAs do. This is a highly drinkable beer for 8% and goes down much like a solid IPA would. There is a little boozy warmth left lingering in your mouth, but very well constructed.  I can not say this beer lives up to its hype, but it is definitely my style of DIPA. It is not overly sweet like a lot DIPA's can be, but very well balanced with a very fragrant dose of hops.",Russian River Brewing Company,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,100
863,7971,TheodorHerzl,4.37,"This beer pours a very hazy orange color with a decent sized solid white head. The head died down a bit, but it left patchy lacing on my tulip glass. The nose on this beer is very fresh and vibrant. The citrus scent is the most dominant with plenty of earthiness and pine scents nipping at the heels of the citrus scent, but no malt to really speak of in the nose. The flavor profile starts out with loads of hop bitterness leaning towards pine bitterness with the citrus fruit and tropical fruits flavors really coming in about mid-drink. The flavors are very pronounced, but they do not overpower you in anyway, but rather combine for a very pleasant flavor profile. The initial rush of hop bitterness if huge, but somehow the finish is soft and clean. I am very surprised as well at how low the malt flavor is, but still supports the hops brilliantly. The drinkability is really amazing for a DIPA with the alcohol well hidden, and I would have gladly had another bottle of this beer.",Russian River Brewing Company,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,100

Nice bright orange color with a sticky white head that lasts and produces tons of sticky lace. Smell is intoxicating. Tons of citrus hop aroma. Lots of grapefruit and orange. One of the best aromas in a dipa I have smelled. Lately it seems most of the dipa's have been hop heavy but really malty as well. Not this one. Great balance, but the hops are the heroes! Wonderful, zesty hop flavor throughout the mouth! Nice and full flavored as well- I just want to swich it throughout my mouth- does not kill the taste buds, just the right amount of hop bite with a sweet, sweet finish. Maybe a bit of damp hop taste as well (funky?) This may be the best beer I have ever had.

Smells strongly of fresh hops- there's no mistaking the intentions of this beer. Aroma intensifies as it warms, and I find myself continuing to smell it between sips. As I drink, the head thins out but remains ever present, thanks in part to the nucleation site in the glass.  Taste is beautifully hoppy, yet smooth. The hops don't kick you in the mouth as I would expect, but they are present and the aftertaste remains long after each sip. Bitterness is low, making this a relatively accessible DIPA, unsurprising given its 8% ABV.  I easily polished off the bottle of this, and feel like I could do another no problem. Drinkability is perfect. This is one smooth DIPA, and could probably be appreciated by both veterans of the style and those looking to expand their horizons.  This beer is incredibly crafted, and leaves me yearning to try its younger brethren. Russian River does well with this, and I'm glad it finally made it to bottles, else I would have never had this opportunity. The pleadings on the bottle (drink this fresh!) are definitely worth heeding, and I wish I'd drank this even closer to its bottled-on date.",Russian River Brewing Company,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,100
863,7971,AKBelgianBeast,4.6,"Thanks to Murchmac for sending this exceptional brew.  Pours a very nice slightly hazy orange/yellow with a wonderful stark white head. The nose is pure citrus and pine hop flavors, and slight maltiness. Taste is simply exceptional. Not too heavy, not too light, very balanced. crisp, clean. Pure. Any hophead knows what I mean when I say that. citrusy hops abound. Mouthfeel is just about perfect. If anything I would say it could be the tiniest touch thicker, but I sat and debated whether or not to give the feel a 4.5 or a 5 for about 10 minutes. fantastically smooth, and defenitely one of, if not the, most drinkable DIPA I have ever consumed. It literally took me about 5 minutes to drink this. (good thing I have another one!) Totally refreshing, and beautifully smooth. A wonderfully crisp and pure brew. Art at its finest, defenitely my favorite RR brew as of yet. Beatification is great, Deviation was amazing, but this beer, is simply perfectly ideal for the style. Deserving of the hype, and worth seeking out. Hope to see this one continue to be bottled well into the future. Thanks again to Tim for these.

863,7971,joe1510,4.17,"Pint Bottle  Bottled 7/10/08  I received a couple of these in a recent trade with BrewerB, thanks again Brian! The Elder Pliny pours a surprisingly clear bright golden with big sunshine bright highlights when backlit. Carbonation bubbles creep up the sides of the glass to the dense head. A standard pour brought about a two finger white billowy head that eventually receded to a solid cap worth of quality staying power. As the head falls it leaves big intricate lacing down the glass and sheet lacing where each drink was taken.  The nose on this beer is all big and pungent hoppiness. There's something in the big hoppiness of this beer that brings to mind Hop Wallop. There are heavy handed doses of dense pine sap, resinous hops, dissolving aspirin, pineapple, orange, and lightly sweetened grapefruit. Hemp seed makes a big showing as well. Yes the aroma really is that loaded with hoppy goodness. When I say heavy handed in the hop department that's a good thing. While the hops run the gamut the sappiness and resin qualities take the lead. There's not a great deal of malt noticeable in the nose but what's there is cake like and way in the back.  The flavor is still hop heavy, obviously, but seems to be a bit more muddled then the nose suggested. The front end hits with big notes of sappy and resinous hop juice but the middle is where things get muddled when the citric qualities of the hops try and join the party. The aspirin bitterness makes an appearance on the backend when things begin to clear up and lingers through the finish. The maltiness is more pronounced in the flavor with a frosting like sweetness drizzled lightly with caramel. Don't get me wrong, the hops still hold the fort and the malts can't figure out how to cross the moat.  The body of this beer is right where it should be. Although the abv is up there at 8% the body is velvety and right down the middle of the spectrum. The carbonation is smooth and natural with a really nice soft texture. The big hopping adds a growing bitterness as the glass empties.  The drinkability is good for a beer with such large alcohol content. As a matter of fact this bottle is disappearing far to fast for my liking. The bitterness is mild enough to keep on drinking and still enjoy the beer for what it is.  I have wanted to give Pliny a go since I've been active on this site and I'm glad I finally get the opportunity to do so. Although I gave this beer good reviews I can't help but be a little disappointed after all the looking forward I've done over the years. I was looking for a total hop bomb but this beer fell a little short. I guess if the anticipation around sampling this beer wasn't so high for me I would have given it a better review but it is still an excellent beer.",Russian River Brewing Company,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,100

The beer turned my tongue inside out!! It is a full on hop assault. My only complaint is that it is more like a hop tea than a DIPA. The malt is almost non-existent.  M: A little on the thin side.

It smells like a fresh picked bushel of Simcoe, Columbus, Centennial, and ??? This is my kind of beer. This is the first time I have had this beer, but I brewed an extract clone of it back in 2006 (before the hop shortage). I loved the smell of the clone I made, but this, the original, is even better. Cat pee, pine sap, pure hop oils, resin, pineapple, grapefruit, and more. Small whiffs of fruit malt in the background.  Taste continues with the hop assault, which is very much to my liking. Herbal hop bitterness up front. Citrus and pine hop flavors follow. Cat pee, pepper, and tangerine around the edges. Tropical fruit and sugar cookie malt sweetness fight through, but just barely, and only for a moment. Herbal bitterness comes on strong with marmalade, pineapple, aspirin, and more pines sap. Wow. After a quarter of the bottle, my tongue is already numb. Orange sorbet and apricot in the finish with long-lasting bitterness and hints of fruit cocktail.

The big hops and imperial levels of malt make for a full balanced mouthfeel and great finish. Im sorry to say that the aroma beats out the taste in this one. It's just so rich and omnipotent.

Resinous and stinky green, just how I like it. Sugared citrus and pine. Peppered grapefruit. Taste is a bitter, hoppy explosion. Grapefruit, pine, with a biscuity malt for some balance. Again, it's got a lightly sugared citrus flavor with a definite spicy, peppery character as well. Good assertive bitterness with a near medium body. Nice drying finish and a tingle on the tongue. Drinkablity is up there. Reminds me of a less vibrant White Knuckle. Very similar in many regards to that, so it's hard to put it too close because it truly doesn't get there in my mind. Still, that aside, it's one of the better brews within the style that I've had the chance to try. Almost closer to an IPA when you compare it to Younger, though. When will they bottle Younger?!

The aftertaste is semi-sweet and malty with a long lingering cannabis, resiny hop finish. awesome. I could drink this all the time.",Russian River Brewing Company,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,100
863,7971,THEBEERBAR0N,4.92,"I have been enjoying this beer for a while at local alehouses, but just now do I review it as I have my first sips from one of their newly released 500ml bottles poured into a pint glass.  Color is pale with faint hues of copper, a finger of white lacing that gobs the side of the glass befriends me.  Smell is honestly grapefruit with a hint of pine resin at the end. It makes my mouth water... so good.  Taste is piney,. citrusy, floral, definitely meg dry hops. Already a classic example of what the style aspires to. Super smooth for being 8% as well.  Mouthfeel is soft with very little prickly bubbles that dance with the hops. Flavor sticks with you somewhat.  I love this beer, it converted me to the stronger hop levels years ago. It still draws me in today and with every sip reminds me of why I loved it in the first place. IMO the soul of hops is captured and turned into ambrosia for this brew. One of my forever beer-drinking staples.",Russian River Brewing Company,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,100
863,7971,prototypic,4.74,"Many, many thanks to hoppymeal for this very nice surprise.  Bottled on 7/10/08  Appearance: It pours an orange/amber color that's light gold around the edges. It's got a very nice two and a half finger head that's just a shade off white. Retention was excellent and a very thick coat of lace remained.  Smell: Strong scents of citrus grapefruit and pineapple greet the nose first. Very sweet smelling. Hops don't waste any time jumping into the mix and do a very nice job of pummeling the nose. It's a very piney and citric hop aroma. Not sure of the hop bill here, but it gives the impression that it's certainly diverse. Piney and citric scents are the strongest. A mix of malt varieties is notable, but they're not doing a good job of holding their own. The hops are beating them down pretty easily. Excellent smelling beer.  Taste: The initial rush of sweet citrus grapefruit and pineapple flavors are quickly followed by an intense hop attack. Very piney, resiny, and citric flavor...and bitter. The hop flavor is really flavorful and diverse. It's a little sugary. There is a bit malt in there, mostly pale. But, it's rather subdued and yields to the intense hop bitterness pretty easily. I'm an admitted hophead and that sits just fine with me. Very well done. It finishes sweet and bitter. Alcohol is masked very well and is not noticeable at all.  Mouthfeel/Drinkbility: It feels medium bodied, but is not far from full. It's amazing how creamy and smooth this beer is. It's liquid silk. Carbonation is not overly active and really attributes to its smoothness. Drinkability is off the charts for me personally. I could drink this all night and then some. At 8%, it may be a little high, but it's good enough to just keep on drinking.  I was expecting this beer to be good. Damn good at that. But, it's actually a little better than I was even expecting. I'm skeptical by nature and don't buy into hype too often. This one's not hype. All substance. Easily among the top DIPAs I've had the pleasure of trying. Seek this one out.",Russian River Brewing Company,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,100
863,7971,HopDerek,4.68,"Bottle picked up at City Beer Store in San Francisco bottled on 071008, poured into a snifter. Pours a clear rich amber color with 1 finger of soap foamy slightly off-white head. Good retention and nice lasting thick fluffy sticky lacing that coats the glass as the liquid leaves. Smells of grapefruit, honey, biscuit, oranges, lemon rind, and pine. Taste packs loads of citrus up front with grapefruit, orange, pineapple, lemon, and tangerine followed by a solid honey and biscuity malt backbone. The finish oozes pine and some spicy hops with a wee bit of alcohol. Medium bodied with perfect carbonation throughout. Smooth but with bite. Lots of citrus notes up front with a sweet and malty middle and a great bitter foresty finish. A great DIPA with lots of different hop flavors that don't compete for dominance, instead work together to make an incredibly flavored beer. Dangerously easy to drink as the alcohol is well hidden.",Russian River Brewing Company,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,100
863,7971,grandq,4.69,"Pours from a 500 ml, bottled on 7/10 (14 freakin days ago!), somewhere between straw and amber, fairly clear and with a proper two finger head. Lightly colored entry in the style. Smells absolutely fantastic - like grapefruit perfume. Some biscuity bread and honey. Much milder taste than I'd anticipated. Pretty heavily hopped, but its all the citrus and floral elements and virtually none of the bitterness, or at least very muted in the IBU dept. Orange, grapefruit, herbal. The malt is also fairly under the radar, no more prevalent than in a crisp lighter lager. Slight, warm, peppery esters let you know this is a ""double."" Mouthfeel is silky, with some predictably resinous stickiness lingering on the tongue. Very very well balanced - terribly drinkable.  I haven't had this since 06 when Mugs Ale House had it on tap for Split Thy Skull and its better than I recall (though my pallate has probably devoloped a tad). As DIPA's go, this is top notch - i slightly prefer Port's Hop 15, but as that goes alot more extreme, i think its just a matter of different beers for different moods. Put either in front of me and I'm a happy man.

863,7971,RblWthACoz,4.48,"Bottle on 7-10-08.  Pours a basically clear gold amber with a half inch creme head in my snifter. Strong soapy, floral nose. Minor perfume tones. Flavor is just smooth. And I mean unbelievably smooth. I don't think I have ever had a DIPA so smooth to date. Hoppy, yes. But the character isn't trying to scream at me. Soapy hops. Floral tones and minor citrus is there too. Feel is smooth with a good combo of liquid and carbonation. This is truly an amazing DIPA. Its beauty lies in its drinkability. It's so smooth and really an amazing mature recipe. It doesn't have to scream in your mouth to make a point. Rami at Healthy Spirits says he likes it on-tap just a little bit more than the bottle.

A: Pours a clear golden amber with a massive two-finger puffy white head that hangs around for ages leaving a wall of lacing all the way around the glass.  S: Smell absolutely jumps out of the bottle. Massive, massive hop aroma with huge pine scents up front, like walking into a pine forest. Grapefruit, oranges, lemons, all kinds of wonderful floral and citrus scents in this one. World class smell.  T: Taste is just as impressive as the smell with citrus hops up front with grapefruit and lemons. The bready malt backbone shows up a little bit in the middle before the pine blast kicks in to provide a wonderfully bitter finish. Spectacular is every way.  M: Mouthfeel is medium bodied with strong carbonation that zings the tongue with hop bitterness and sticks on the palate for a while.  D: This is a world class example of a DIPA and probably the new standard for me.

863,7971,Gueuzedude,4.57,"Bottled On Date July 10, 2008; Sampled July 17, 2008 A soft pour produces a three-finger thick, light tan colored head in my 25cl tulip glass. The beer is just so expressively pungeant with hop aromatics that just jump out at me as I am pouring this beer. It sits in my glas with a light amber, copper hue and shows a clear, bright gold hue when held up to the light. The aroma is just sticky with hop character; huge lychee notes, super ripe apricot, bright tropical fruit notes, candied grapefruit, expansive tangelo and Curacao orange peel are all easily noticeable. The other side of the hop aroma spectrum lurks just below the fruit notes with herbal notes that are quite floral, some pine that adds some backbone to the aroma and a light, dank, hemp-oil like note that adds just a bit of an edge to this brew. What I love about the aroma is the focus on the fruity hop notes, but it still has some of the more herbal notes that add a touch of offset and a touch of contrast. If you really dig for it some cracker-like malt notes are just noticeable underneath all of the dominating hop aromatics.  Aggressively bitter up front, though not overwhelmingly so, this is quite herbal as it first hits the tongue, but becomes redolent of super ripe hop fruit flavors through the middle and finish. At this point the bitterness kicks in again and a clean, biting hop note lingers on the tongue for quite some time after the beer has left my mouth. Pine-sap flavors up front yield to tropical fruit notes of lychees, almost pineapple and other fruit flavors of apricot, peach and ripe tangelo. The explosive up front fruit flavors seem to get scraped from my palate by the aggressive herbal and pine notes that seem to get more pronounced with every sip. A short respite from the beer seems to accentuate the fruit notes a bit more again, but it is still as if my tongue has been scraped by some very herbal hops that have left a permanent mark. Still this aggressively herbal hop character (that is definitely riding the edge of being laden with hemp oil) never buries the hop-fruit flavors. While certainly not light, this is eminently drinkable; not so heavy that it has not business having the letters of IPA on the label; this is my definitive example of what the texture and heft of a double IPA should be.  The aroma of this beer is just so nice; the dominant hop fruit notes are perfectly controlled by the softer herbal hop character. The flavor is a bit more herbal in balance and is quite scathing in its hop attack. Still the bitter, sharply herbal hop notes never get out of control, but this beer still makes me feel like my tongue has been abused and scraped raw by the aggressive hop character. This is most definitely a well constructed brew, and in some aspects this is quite definitive for the style. A benchmark for the style that I will never get enough of.",Russian River Brewing Company,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,100

A- Pours a bright golden honey color with a cream colored froathy head that fell into a layer on top of the brew and left a good amount of lacing down the glass.  S- This beer smells fantastic!1 It doesn't smell balanced in terms of malt and hops. The hop profile is perfectly balanced between pine, grapefruit citrus and floral hops. Tons of hops!!  T- Huge flavours of the same floral, pine, and citrus that you can pick up in the aroma. Everything is up front and in your face.

863,7971,athensbeermaster,3.95,Found this on tap at Pizza Port. The bartender really didn't know how to pour beer so maybe the head could of been better? The lacing was fair. The color was a rich orange shade. The taste was a mild pine resin oil that left a sticky oily finish on the tongue. The hop spice was more orange and mango flavor with a decent malt backbone. The drinkabilty is very good for me because for being a dbl ipa the alcohol is fairly on the low side compared to other brews. This one didn't WOW me for all the hype that it gets? One guy at the bar said this year's brew wasn't as good as it use to be. Maybe the hop shortage change the recipe slighty? I would still drink this brew again next year!,Russian River Brewing Company,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,100
863,7971,BrewerB,4.7,"I first noticed pineapple hops, rather intense. Pine needles are also very present. Slight floralness appearing later on. Light hints of breaded malt. Clean. Citrusy hop character remained present longest.  Medium gold with yellow highlights. Two to three finger white head formed, collapsed to one finger and held up well. Great clarity.  Citrus and pine flavored hops backed up with a pleasing malt background. Medium-dry finish. Bitterness on the high side, lingers on into the finish. No diacetyl. Bitterness, though very prominent, is extremely well balanced with malt. A slight, very slight, increase in malt is the only thing I can think to help improve this.  Medium-bodied with a moderate carbonation. Bitterness is smooth.  Hop flavor is intense and lasting. Bitterness is also strong though not so much as some other DIPAs. What Pliny has that other IIPAs lack is a great balance. Despite its hoppiness and alcoholic strength, the beer is very drinkable. I could definitely order 2-3 pints.",Russian River Brewing Company,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,100

It pours a nice light amber-blonde with a decent white head to it that takes a couple minutes to recede and leaves some lacing. There appears to be the right amount of carbonation rising up. The aroma opened with some big grass notes that really gave way to some strong pine and lighter citrus with a hint of grapefruit as the head receded. Very nice hop profile.  However, I'm thoroughly underwhelmed on the taste. I wasn't expecting a hop bomb, but at a supposed 100 IBU's I was expecting a little more kick than this. It's mostly full of pine notes, that really linger on afterwards, which is my favorite part about the taste. The mouthfeel is everything a DIPA should be, with a medium-full body and solid carbonation.

The grolwer kept the beer in perfect condition. Nice sticky glass lacing.  S: Wow, hops, hops, hops. This beer is a different animal fresh. Smells of pine hops with some mild citrus and sweet malt undertone.  T: Again wow. Massive amounts of pine like chewing on a pine cone. Pine coupled with some floral flavors and some mild citrus backed up by a nice deep malt sweetness. A perfect balance of the massive hops with the malt sweetness and a nice lingering bitterness. Make no mistake, this beer is about the massive amounts of sticky chewy hops and it showcases them perfectly.  M: Medium with a sticky resiny mouthfeel. Nice carbonation and bitterness that lasts. You taste this beer well after it's gone.  D: This is probably the most drinkable double IPA out there. It goes down so easily and it remains enjoyable with every sip.  Overall this is the beer of gods, and for that it will garner my first perfect 5. This is a perfect beer in it's fresh state.

A: Not only did it feel like Christmas when I opened ricand's package, but when I popped the growler, it smelled like Christmas as well. Pine hops are enormous! There are some light citrus hops and some sweet malts as well.  T: A lot of big brews fail to live up to the hype, this was not one of them. Outstanding! Again, syrupy pine dominates, but you do get some orange and tangerine also.The beer finishes with a bitter bite and slight alcohol heat.  M&D: Medium to full body.

As for the taste, thsi should be renamed ""Piney"" the Elder, because there are a lot of piney notes in this bittersweet offering, but leaning towards being bitter.

Poured into a tulip and the head vigorously formed, regardless. Poured a clear, golden amber color with a rich, incredibly long lasting offwhite head that left huge chunks of frothy lacing. Smell was huge piney, fruity, grapefruity, citrusy hoppy deliciousness. Taste is incredibly smooth and clean. Citrusy fresh hops and a hint of a slighly syrupy body, but still just barely medium to full bodied. The drinkability on this was phenomenal and the alcohol was hidden perfectly. Flavor was a touch milder than expected but was still divine and went down like water. Great double IPA.  Rerate of fresh bottle 6 years later. My tastes have changed.

863,7971,rashmore,4.97,"I've had this on tap at the Russian River brewpub numerous times, and always bring a growler home. If I had to pick a single favorite beer this would probably be it. Rich gold in color, with reddish tints. The nose is astounding: pineapple, pleasantly musty grass- and pine-sap aromas, grapefruit, some of the kind of vanilla-ey aromas that you find in oaky chardonnay, along with funky tropical fruit scents---passionfruit, or even durian, though not overwhelming. With wines or beers, I'm a sucker for an interesting aroma, and this is definitely a beer worth swirling again and again to reactivate the olfactory blast. Flavors of passionfruit and grapefruit, with piney hops. All of Vinnie's high-hop offerings remind you that a simple IBU number doesn't really tell the story---this has got to be at 90 or more, but it's so well structured and balanced that you really don't taste ""bitterness"" or ""hoppiness"" per se. Instead the hops and malts create a structure that allows an amazing range of flavors to play across the palate with crystalline definition (this general point goes for the Younger, and RR's other hopped-up offerings as well). The mouthfeel is crisp and not at all cloying, but does have a noticeable tongue-coating quality. It's worth noting that while this beer is classed as an IIPA, it's far less heavy in body than most of the others of the type, and while the intensity of flavors definitely puts it in that category, it has a clean medium-bodied profile that drinks more like a regular, if mind-blowing, IPA. The finish is clean, bitter-grapefruit-rindy, and lingering. Two comments: 1. Thanks! 2. Never stop making this stuff!",Russian River Brewing Company,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,100
863,7971,jeonseh,4.67,"Thanks to urwatuh8 for LIF'ing this beer. I had it on the night of my college graduation and as per his instructions, shared it with my beer loving friends and family who were in for the occasion.  A - The color is a deep straw that has golden and orange hues to it. It was slightly cloudy and rather opaque as well. The head that sat on top was a bright clean white, as one could even say it was a color of a white t-shirt on a clorox commercial. The head was a bout two fingers and settled down to one. It managed to settle down to a finger, where it remained for most of the duration of the drinking, and it left plenty of sticky lacing.  S - This nose was pure hops but this was not some one dimensional nose. On the contrary, it was rather complex as it possessed every odor that I think possible when I think of hops. The main odor was grapefruit yet there were also hints of a mango and pineapple mixed. Additionally, there were also hints of pine and citrus. Every sniff brought me a mixture of these flavors. The nose was big and one that I could taste all day.  T - At first, the beer has a light mango and orange sweetness to it that was not at all cloying. After that fades away, the grapefruit flavors come in before they are overtaken by a hint of pine and more bitter hops. Also noted hints of candied orange here and there Yet, despite this being a DIPA and one loaded with hops, this beer never approaches overly bitter and it is definitely not a stereotypical hop bomb. Throughout the whole time I drank this, I kept thinking how well crafted this beer was. It manages to bring and incorporate a ton of hops. Yet it still has a ton of nice and complex flavors to it, instead of just demolishing my tongue and taste buds. Not only did it avoid being a hop bomb, it also avoided the other DIPA deadly sin which is having so much malt that the beer is super sticky, cloying and essentially a malt bomb. I have to say I did not really notice that much of the typical malt flavors at all in this one.  MF - Had minimal carbonation and a thin body in my opinion. While I do like that it was not really cloying, I wish it were a bit thicker and fuller in the mouth. I can see how the body does go with this beer's overall muted character but just wish for a bit more here.  D - Overall, this is definitely one of the easiest drinking and most flavorful DIPAs out there. Usually this style of beer has trouble reaching a balance as the beer is either all hops or all malt. This one manages to bring the hops without being overpowering at all. There was also not even a hint of the 10% ABV in this bad boy which became a bit dangerous as I glasses continue to be filled. Overall a great RR Brew.",Russian River Brewing Company,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,100

The taste is...  The taste is hoppy. This beer is amazingly balanced and full of that bitter bite that one would expect. I dont really know what to say other than wow. There is very little alcohol bite which is a great thing. I honestly really enjoy this brew!  The mouthfeel of this is awesome.

S: The aroma is a very good combination of fruity citrus and grassy hops, along with some caramelized malts.  T: The taste is excellently balanced with flavors of citrus and caramel sweetness, a strong but not over-powering hops bitterness and a hearty malt character.

M: Very smooth and very crisp, medium body, medium carbonation, clean and dry finish.

863,7971,tempest,4.46,"On-tap at Ortino's Northside.  Gold in color with a white head and thick lacing. Looks nice, but before I dig in, I'm struck by the lack of aroma. I don't get it, there turns out to be plenty of flavor, but there's only mild citrus fruit punch and floral aroma. It's nice, yes, but it should be a lot bigger for a DIPA.  The flavor was great, it coated your tongue with sweet grapefruit, lemon, and tangerine while a bitter citrus rind aftertaste slowly built up. This was very full-flavored, yet oh-so drinkable - a dangerous combination. It never felt that bitter, but by the time my glass was empty, I was feeling it.",Russian River Brewing Company,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,100
863,7971,AltBock,4.67,"I was able to get this Russian River on-tap at Drafting Room's Hopfest on 4/12/2008. It was served to me in a 10 oz. Pilsner glass.  Pliny The Elder poured a bautiful hazy golden orange with a nice creamy 1/2 inch head of white foam. This head of foam had excellent retention that left behind a small white film and tons of white lace around around the glass. The aroma was very potent with citrus hops, grapefruit, pine, a slice of lemon, a touch of grass, and then all this ended with more citrus hops. If there was any malt in here, it was beaten down by all the hoppy aromas. The taste was just filled to the brink with pine, citrus hops, a touch of lemon, grapefruit,and more citrus hops. I noticed that at the end, there was some alcohol, but this alcohol tasted like it was infused with pine and citrus hops. Even the alcohol couldn't get away from being hoppy and piny. The mouthfeel was medium to full bodied with a powerful aftertaste of citrus hops, pine, and grapefruit. This aftertaste will linger on your tongue for quite a long time. It was nothing short of being a wonderful hoppy beer. If I could, I would drink this one again at the drop of a hat.",Russian River Brewing Company,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,100
863,7971,0110x011,4.75,"This is the second or third time I've sampled this gem, and i like it more and more each time.  Pours a clear copper-yellow with a small, brief, frothy head. As expected for the style, the nose is huge hops, but with more complexity than I'm used to in a DIPA. pine galore, but hints of grapefruit, lemon, green apple, grass, and some spicyness pull through. Palette leans more towards the citrusy zest side, with a lemon and grapefruit tartness being the dominant flavor profile. We get the expected hoppy bitter punch at the end (although it isn't overpowering), along with a mild alcohol warmth that finishes nicely. Mouthfeel is full, but not too sticky or syrupy (my personal pet peeve of the style). Overall, a dynamite DIPA, with a greater complexity and balance than any other DIPA I've tried so far.",Russian River Brewing Company,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,100
863,7971,kajerm,4.47,"On tap at Russian River. Pours rich copper-hued amber with two fingers of thick carbonation and heavy spider webs of lacing all over the glass.  The aroma is hops (der), one of the best blends I've ever smelled but with a cohesiveness that makes it hard to pick out any single note other than pine. Lots of pine. The blend is evident in the fact that it smells ""complex""; it's just hard to tease the rest of it apart. Resinous and hoppy as it may be, though, the light malt backbone comes through adding balance.  Tastes like it smells, and that's one of the best compliments I can give it. It opens up with hop flavor (still piny as hell, but some slight citric character is present this time, unless I'm making that up), which lingers through the mid-palate as the background of light malts becomes more noticeable. The finish is bitter as expected.  The malts provide a creaminess to the mouthfeel, which even with them is almost bone-dry and heavily (but appropriately) carbonated.  As for drinkability, I thought the board was lying when it said this was a DIPA, because of the balance and the total absence o heat.  Vinny is a superhero.",Russian River Brewing Company,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,100
863,7971,Beertracker,4.8,"Pliny the Elder was a Roman naturalist, scholar, historian, traveler, officer, and writer. Although not considered his most important work, Pliny and his contemporaries created the botanical name for hops, ""Lupus salictarius"", meaning ""wolf among scrubs."" Hops at that time grew wild among willows, much like a wolf in the forest. Later the current botanical name, Humulus lupulus, was adopted. Pliny died in 79 AD while observing the eruption of Mount Vesuvius. He was immortalized by his nephew, Pliny the Younger, who continued his uncle's legacy by documenting much of what he observed during the eruption of Mount Vesuvius. Pliny the Elder... the beer, is brewed with 40% more malt and over twice the amount of hops as compared to our already hoppy IPA.  Russian River's Pliny The Elder pours up sublime with ample carbonation that creates a voluptuous white head that craggily sits atop the most gorgeous deep golden body you've ever seen! Very lacy with excellent head retention. The aroma is alive with zesty, ripe citrus (blood orange, pomelo, tangerine) character that carries some earthiness reminiscent of freshly cut conifer trees. Very floral, pungent, and resiny. Low-moderate maltiness, some warmth, otherwise very clean. The seriously hoppy flavor starts off with a solid maltiness and the underlying graininess shows hints of orange blossom honey, caramel apple, and toasted pine nuts. The sweet graininess is quickly subdued by an absurd hop character with a scorching bitterness that lingers well into the surprisigly balanced, medium-dry, slightly warming finish. Very complex, yet simplisticly straight forward. In a word... sublime! This is a showcase of brewer's art and love for the hop plant (Humulus lupulus). I'll surely never forget the very first time I tried this one at the 2001 GABF. I look forward to supping one from the source someday. Here's to Vinny and his tribute to Pliny The Elder!  CHEERS!

863,7971,ubermick,4.49,"I've been sitting here for a wee bit, trying to describe what Pliny tastes and feels like, and I'm genuinely having a hard time. The closest I can come to is that it's like a field of hops mated with an alpine forest, and the resulting child smacked you in the mouth.  Wow.  A golden beer with a hint of copper to it, it just sat there in the glass asking to be sipped. A nice head, about a quarter inch high, sat firmly atop the brew. Bringing it to my nose, the aroma was phenominal - as I said above, think hops meeting forest. Fresh doesn't begin to describe it. The hops really shone through on the first sip, but as they receded pine came to the fore. Very crisp and refreshing, down to the last in the glass.  At 8% ABV, it has bite. And the overwhelming flavours mean that for me, it's not an everyday beer. The rule of thumb for me, as someone who does enjoy IPA would be to open with their Blind Pig, then Pliny, then back to standard IPA. It's definitely one or two in a sitting, no more.  But my God, you'll enjoy that one or two.",Russian River Brewing Company,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,100
863,7971,timbro81,4.52,"Thanks to Beertracker for the taste. Poured out of a less than one month old growler. Really nice head with somewhat low carbonation. Golden straw color. Smells of BIG multi-dimensional hops, focusing mostly on pine. Some sweet maltiness in there too. Smell is so strong as it could give the faint of heart a nose bleed. Mouthfeel is light to medium. Tingles the tongue as is swirls around. Some malt sweetness discernable. Slightly viscous. Hops all through out and leaves the tongue feeling vibrant and alive. Not totally unbalanced but definitely destroys the taste buds in a good way. Really mellows as it warms, becomes almost winelike. An exceptionally great beer that I look forward to having again.",Russian River Brewing Company,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,100
863,7971,F2brewers,4.4,"Served on tap in a snifter at Stone Brewing World Bistro and Gardens during a trip there in November 2007. I just came across my notes (finally!).  Appearance: Lovely deep golden/light copper color. The beer was nearly transparent with just the slightest cloudy element. Carbonation was low and bubbles were small. The head was pure white, light and frothy. It lasted only 1-2 minutes but did leave a fine lacing on the glass.  Smell: A strong smell of American West Coast hops. Lots of pine and citrus elements on the nose of this beer. IMO, the beer was served too cold, so I allowed/encouraged it to warm up. Once it was slightly warmer, the balance of sweet malt aroma grew steadily more apparent. No notes of menthol or alcohol.  Taste: Up front, this is all about the hops. The same pine and citrus elements from the smell came through in the taste. Shortly thereafter, a touch of alcohol flavor came through followed by malt tones. The hops overpower the malt in this beer, but that's to be expected in an American DIPA. Overall, the balance was quite good once it warmed at bit. If the beer isn't served around well above refrigerated temperature, you'll miss the malt.  Mouthfeel: This beer had a light to medium body. The finish was smooth and clean without lingering hop aftertaste. This is the only place where the maltiness is clearly notice.  Drinkability: Other American Imperial IPAs should aspire to match this beer. It's not a session beer or one that you can drink more than a glass (or two) of, but at the same time, it does not overpower or ruin the palate. A lovely beer and one of the best examples of the style I've tried.  -Kevin.",Russian River Brewing Company,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,100

A- a deep golden, no amber or copper qualities as I've read in other reviews. It was a beautiful golden, though, just a slight cloud in it, but still pretty clear. Nice white head, little to no lacing (perhaps it was the detergents in the pint glass...).  S- Smelled amazing, like fresh Cascade hops. Very citrusy, floral. This is definitely a double IPA. really great scent. nothing but hops in the nose, which was a fine thing.  T- It was very hard to taste anything beyond the hops. Great hop quality, very fresh and full, not as citrusy-hoppy, very pungent and acidic.  M- small, thin mouthfeel. Very tart towards the end, nice, crisp, clean. Strips the tongue of all feeling and taste for a split second like a champagne. Very dry finish, and then the hops come slowly arise on the tongue. Great after bite.

The color is a deep reddish-copper and golden color with a great head reaching just short of a finger. The carbonation isn't too much to swallow but leaves nice wispy swirls in the head as it settles in. The lacing and viscosity leaves a nice finish hanging onto the glass as I swirl it a bit and drink it down.  This is a strong beer with a great hoppy, somewhat citrus-y flavor and smooth body that finishes with a dry bitter taste. While you definitely taste the alcohol, it just feels warm and doesn't overpower the flavor.

Medium body, Moderate carbonation. Nice long, smooth finish for an 8% beer. Some alcohol warmth and dry finish from abundant hops.

Has a strong floral hop taste, with a nice malt backbone sweetness that is always present but is cotnrolled by the hops. The beer coates your mouth with a sticky hop feel. While drinking many of these can be dangerous, I often find myself putting back quite a few, and so I would say it is very drinkable.",Russian River Brewing Company,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,100

Carbonation traveled well equaling a three finger off white head that sits like a foamm brick. It slowly settles leaving a ton of lace. Body is a golden honey straw in color. Nose is big and fresh with notes of flowery citrus, which is almost creamy with piney alchol notes that really get the taste buds going. On first sip a rush of creamy hops attack the tongue. This hop feel quickly becomes incredibly dominent with long bitter feel coating the entire mouth. This beer really has a good thing going with an effect as the only thing that satisfies the bitter mouthfeel is another sip. There is a bit of a malt feel that adds a bit of balance as the beer warms. Mouthfeel is a long and even almost creamy hop bitterness.

The IIPA style doesn't vary much at the top. Unfortunately I'm reviewing from recent memory (had it a few days ago), but I've drank at least a dozen pint over the past few months. Will update again if my tastes differ.  Aroma is sharp and hoppy, and the taste is just so balanced. Just a whiff of the nose gives one the idea of how good this beer can be. Different hops come together in just the right way. Bold and hoppy, slightly piny and citrus-y, with a malty presence underneath. It's quite bitter but sweet and fruity to balance it all out. Compared to Racer X and Ruination -- this is a step above.  Drinks easily, the alcohol is very well-masked.

This beer had a thin head over a clear, yellow body. I would imagine, given the texture of the head, that had it been poured more vigorously, there would not have been a problem building a much larger head.  Aroma was a HUGE whallop of grapefruit hops, very aromatic and complex. A good malt body was supporting it all, but the star of the show was definitely the hops.  Taste followed aroma. Very strong grapefruit hops over a medium malt backbone, held up well and tied together superbly.  Mouthfeel was good, a bit mouth-puckering - but I am a hophead, and I liked it.

It had a constant carbonation stream, which really added to overall look of the beer. Very nice.  Smell - This beer smells fantastic. It doesn't smell balanced in terms of malt AND hops - but the hop profile is perfectly balanced. There are notes of pine, grapefruity citrus and floral hops. A perfect hop bouquet.  Taste - It is the same as the scent, however it is more underwhelming. It tastes great, but not as good as the scent would lead you to believe. It has a low malt profile - this brew is all hops. Piney, floral, and grapefruity citrus with an almost apricot finish. The finish is kind of astringent and drying.  Mouthfeel - On the lighter side of medium bodied. The carbonation builds in a progression. I don't feel the carbonation level so much at the beginning as I do at the middle and end of each sip.  Drinkability - The drinkability of this beer is amazing. It smells and tastes great and is so easy to drink - it is easily sessionable, regardless of the ABV.

Smells like bready sweet malt and fresh juicy hops. Taste is as it smells, big juicy hops with a huge rush of balancing malt. Medium at most in the mouth with good carbonation. Rediculously drinkable for a DIPA!! No abv apparant, just some hop juice to brighten my day.",Russian River Brewing Company,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,100
863,7971,Lothore,4.2,A- Poured on tap at the brewpub. It is a beautiful deep golden color with a small head which sticks around until the bottom of the glass.  S- Smells of oily piney hops with a distinct sweet maltiness in the background.  T- Tastes of bitter piney hops with a good amount of sweet maltiness to balance it out. A bready doughy flavor is in the background.  M- Thick with a lot of carbonation that gives you an awesome kick. Great mouthfeel to say the least  D- For an 8 percent abv brew this went down extremely smooth. I drank it so fast in fact that I definitely was feeling the alcohol afterwards that I didn't taste. All in all a great DIPA.,Russian River Brewing Company,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,100
863,7971,Lupe,4.45,"Pours a crystal clear honey-orange, topped with a two finger frothy white head that lasts. Nice lacing left behind along the sides of the glass.  Strong hop aroma. The smell hits you before you even pick up the glass. Lots of citrus hop goodness with some pine and malt in the back ground.  Lots of hop flavor but nicely balanced by the malt. More balanced then you would think from the aroma. Citrus and floral flavors give way to some toasted malt sweetness.  Full bodied and creamy. Very refreshing and wonderfully balanced, more so than other double IPAs.",Russian River Brewing Company,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,100
863,7971,colinsk,4.4,This is the classic Double IPA or Imperial IPA if you prefer. The hop aroma is so strong you will smell it before you raise the glass to taste it. While the aroma is overpowering it balances the intensly strong hop flavor present in the beer. The malt and bitterness balance in nearly perfect. Be careful of the excessivly (but to style) alcohol in the beer! If you like double IPAs this is a great beer to try.,Russian River Brewing Company,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,100
863,7971,session1979,4.67,"Special thanks to flexabull for giving me the opportunity to sample this wonderful beer.  Setting: Drank this over labor day weekend and boy what a treat.  Appearance - Poured a clear honey amber with a frothy 2 finger marshmallowy head. Great retention and lacing.  Smell - One of the most complex nose's I have experienced full of citrus, pineapple, pine, floral spices, gummi candies and light warm malts.  Taste - Refreshingly bitter raw hops which are very nicely balanced with malts and floral notes. The taste is not as complex or intense as the nose but very nice.  Mouth - Full creamy body coats the mouth with wonderful hop flavors. Just the right amount of carbonation.  Drinkability - A very well balanced and therefore easy to drink beer. I could easily enjoy 2 or 3 glasses in a sitting.  Overall - What a wonderful culmination of time and effort from Russian River. This beer warrants all of the accolades it receives and will continue to impress craft beer lovers for ages to come.",Russian River Brewing Company,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,100
863,7971,Overlord,4.6,"Exceptional IPA. Exploded with bitter, grapefruit/floral hops. Drinkable despite the strong flavor and high alcohol content. Some sweetness in the form of pink/white grapefruit and citrus, but also a great balancing array of bittering flavors. All of the various tastes are superbly blended.  Pours a beautiful coppery color. Tough to find, but excellent.",Russian River Brewing Company,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,100
863,7971,Floydster,4.73,"Originally reviewed a couple months ago, but had to do another because it is by far my favorite beer  Served in 12 ounce goblet at Naja's Place in Redondo Beach near the pier and King's Harbor and a 1/2 liter tankard at Hollingshead's more recently  I will start off by saying that Russian River is my favorite brewery in the world and this is their best beer, this is also the beer that made me want to start reviewing beers and made me an IPA fanatic, particularly doubles and imperials  Unfortunately, I have not been able to try Pliny the Younger yet, cannot wait until Hollingshead's in the city of Orange gets more after the new year  Pour was a golden orangish yellow color with a 3/4 inch foamy head that let the perfect smell out through its small openings  Smell was full of hops and some small amounts of citrus including lemon, lime, orange, and grapefruit  Taste was nice and bitter, not too much of the fruit in the aroma can be tasted, especially at the ned of the sip, this a strong tasting double IPA that is closer to perfection than anything else I have had, it has a nice bitter bite at the finish making you want more and more  Could drink these until I pass out they are so good and the alcohol is hidden very well, the brew is not too heavy, actually extremely light for an imperial IPA  Good to know that they keep this year round at the bar near my house, always be the number one candidate when there is not something else interesting to try  This is going to be available in 22 ounce bottles in about six months because RR is expanding, that should be a great treat for everybody on the east coast who does not have access to this beer  Pizza Port is having a two dollar pint night featuring this coming up and you could be certain that I will be there drinking at least five of these, if not more  I have not tried Dark Lord Imperial Stout from Three Floyds or the Younger like I previously mentioned, but I believe this should be the highest rated beer in the world, flawless  It is so complex and subtle at the same time, this is hands down my favorite beer in my favorite style of beer  Gotta try this if you are a fan of IPAs, or just want to try one of the best beers in the world in general",Russian River Brewing Company,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,100
863,7971,BeerTruth,4.53,"Last of three beers I had at Russian River, perfect beer to end my trip there. Poured into a nonic pint glass, ah yes, Happy Hour all day on Sunday :)  Pours a mostly clear copper hue with a lot of bubbles racing to the top that create a perfect fluffy white one finger head that stays around until the very end. Stickiness is everywhere on the glass. Smell has all hop scents mixed in; evergreen pine, grapefruit/lime citrus, and earthy hops. Caramel malt does make an appearance, just enough to balance the huge hop character. Taste starts off with a tiny bit of alcohol but is quickly taken over by the huge citrus hop flavor. Grapefruit, lemon, lime, oranges with a good pine undertone. With how much hop is present on the tongue, this beer isn't dry or very bitter at all. Caramel malt is actually quite noticable for such a hop bomb. Mouthfeel is medium bodied bordering on full with a whole lot of constant carbonation. Creamy DIPA which is a very enjoyable in every aspect. For 8% abv this one goes down very easy. Get your hands on this one for sure. I would definitely love to try the Younger, see how that compares.",Russian River Brewing Company,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,100
863,7971,jeffjfindley,4.35,"Lovingly consumed at Father's Office. A fair color for an IPA, coppery, and with abundant head. Retention was respectable, but not enviable. Smell was grassy, and alive with sweet malt and sticky hops. Taste was nectary, caramel with a fine blend of hops, with center stage shared beautifully between pine and citrus characters. Mouthfeel was rich and malty, but very clean. Unarguably, this is one hell of an IPA.",Russian River Brewing Company,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,100
863,7971,HardTarget,3.8,"On tap at OBrians in San Diego  Aroma: Mild grassy hop (sorry, pub reviews always suffer on aroma).  Appearance: Amber glass with great clarity, thin cover managed a bit of lace.  Flavor: Tangy hops are firm but not overwhelming. Base is adequate but not sweet.  Mouthfeel: Oily texture, medium heavy body.  Overall Impression: Hyped? Its a good IPA, double is subjective. No flaws, chock full of hops, but I just didnt wow. Im thinking that D/IPAs are to the West Coast as Mild Cask Ale is to the UK. Maybe there is a subtleness that Im missing. I love me some hops, but this just struck me as a good, not great beer.",Russian River Brewing Company,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,100
863,7971,celistealth,4.55,"A: Poured an attractive bright orange with an average head, somewhat persistent retention left sticky and spotty lacing.  S: Smelled surprisingly bright and sweet for a DIPA. Notes of citrus peel and a subtle resin of piney hops. Though strong and oily, not overly resinous/bitter.  T: Much rounder than the nose, the citrus and pine notes from the hops are complemented by underlying malts and what I can only describe as a buttery, oily sweetness. A long finish of grapefruit zest, followed by minty piney resin, with a toffee-like background throughout.  M: Quite oily and syrupy, without being overly viscous or astringent. What I could only describe as buttery-oily and chewy, with smooth carbonation that thickened the brew without making it airy.  D: A bit more drinkable compared to most other DIPAs due to its subtler hoppiness, but also more filling due to its thick mouthfeel and full flavor. I could do a couple pints in a night, but any more would be labored.",Russian River Brewing Company,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,100
863,7971,trevorwideman,4.57,"On tap at Toronado, SF, CA.  Pours a rich orange-red with 1/2 inch of head with lots of sticky lace and mild carbonation. Aroma is resiny, piney and floral, but the citric hops dominate.  Flavour-wise, this one is all about balance, balance, balance. Pine, grapefruit, oily hops, and alcohol balanced out by caramel, vanilla, and lots of bready and crackery malt. Very yin-yang, but still leaning towards the hops a bit. Massive amount of flavour, you can't help but hold this one in your mouth for a bit and savour it. Mouthfeel stings a bit with the high acidity, very sticky. Medium body, medium carbonation, dry as hell. I could drink this all night long, no joke, screw the 8%, I'll just hurt in the morning, It'll have been worth it, and I would taste hops forever and ever and ever.",Russian River Brewing Company,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,100
863,7971,sessycuban,4.63,"Sampled at the great Naja's Place in Redondo Beach.  A - The beer pours a deep golden color, with a slightly hazy, finger deep head with great retention and lacing.  S - The beer smells strongly of citrus with orange, passionfruit, and other tropical notes. I get a tinge of alcohol.  T - The beer is surprisingly not overhopped. I'm also getting fruits, a slight malty note; the body is heavily citric with lemon and orange dominating! This tastes absolutely wonderful.  M - The beer is medium bodied, low in carbonation, and finishes dry.  D - This beer is extremely drinkable for a DIPA, largely because it's not particularly alcoholic. I think you can enjoy this with almost any type of food.",Russian River Brewing Company,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,100
863,7971,Halcyondays,4.85,"Pint on-tap at Hollingshead,  A: Amber coloured, with a thick, white head, which leaves excellent lacing.  S: Smells like a pine forest, very fragrant, if I go up to the taiga in Canada, that's what it should smell like.  T: Delicious, full of pine and grapefruit bitterness, probably the most bitter beer I've ever had, but that's part of its appeal to this hophead, a great beer taste.  M: Smooth, creamy, and o' so resiny, perfect for a Double IPA.  D: Incredibly drinkable, even for an 8% beer, it's so delicious, you'll keep wanting more, Russian River is doing great things in the world of craft beer, I can't wait to see what they try next. In conclusion, this is a great craft beer and Double IPA, worthy of its accolades.",Russian River Brewing Company,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,100
863,7971,mmcave,4.62,"After all the wait finally a 750 ml naked, unmarked, and capped bottle received in trade with Risser09. Chilled and poured into a Duvel tulip glass foamy off white (sort of cream) colored head rose to one finger and now lingers a centimeter above the surface, lacing is already apparent. The body is a robust orange with warmer lighter highlights.  Smell is obviously very aromatic tones of hop fragrance, ballasted by a solid malt backbone. I get notes of grapefruit, mild almost hidden touches of piney grass toward the finish, floral accents, that piney raisin like aroma which I assume comes from the clash of substantial malt slamming up against a hearty hop and dry hop regimen. I also notice touches of fresh earth and maybe if I imagine a touch of blueberry and bubble gum.  Taste is extremely balanced in comparison to the aroma. Bitterness is not over welling or sharp, the hops provide great balance and showcase themselves in a very round manner with out making the beer too bitter or crushing to the palate. Although malt is not the focus of this beer it does play an extremely integral roll in the flavor. I don't think many dark malts or high Lovibond Crystals where used. The malt really provides a great ground for the hops to function, clean slightly sweet and sticky, but not toasted or over done. There is that tasty slightly resin like, olily mouth feel, which is always welcome in a Double IPA. I get fruit notes like strawberry and others.  The ABV limits this slightly to maybe two to three glasses in a sitting but thats fine.. If I were to use this in a dinner setting I would put it more toward the end just because of the slight lingering quality. I normally don't think of Double IPA as food beers, but I think this one in-particular could do the trick, because of its subtle and semi dry finish....  In my experience there is something about Russian River's beers that just do it for me. Its not that they are doing any thing that much crazier or more out landish than any other brewery, its that they are doing it more tastefully, this is of course my opinion and subject to change in the future, but for now I love you russian river. Nothing is over done and nothing is under attended to.",Russian River Brewing Company,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,100
863,7971,ccrida,4.79,"Woohoo, I finally got to try this, and boy was it fantastic! Had 2 full pints at the Oregon Brewers Festival, in the plastic mug. Pliny is pale orange with a modest, olive tinged eggshell colored head that left nice lace.  The aroma is just incredible, very fragrant, floral and bubblegum like, with a bit of pine resin. Dry hopped with columbus, centennial and simcoe, and man to they come across nicely here, bright and fresh.  Like the smell, the taste is the perfect DIPA, again very floral, with tropical fruits and a nice sweetness that is soft and not at all sugary, and while there's the requisite malt and bitter backbone, Pliny is all about the fragrance of the dry-hopping. I'm amazed that they can make a beer so hoppy and delicious while keeping it smooth and sweet, and not to bitter or pungent.  The mouthfeel is soft and smooth but pretty low carbonated, and has a medium body.  This is the ultimate DIPA, so fresh and tasty, and while very fragrant, the hops don't beat up the palate at all. It was my first and last pint of the night, and truly memorable. Can't wait until they start distributing this up here!",Russian River Brewing Company,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,100

A: A dense, soapy ivory-colored head atop an amber/golden pour. Lots of sheeting, creamy foam. A clear liquid with sporadic carbonation rising to that thick head.  S: Full of pine and resin. This one is all about the hops, very little malt/grain gets through.  T: So full of pungent hoppiness. 92 IBU but might as well be 192 the way this finishes - very bitter! Lots of pine and a grapefruit pith that strips the enamel off your teet. No part of the tongue left untouched: a sharp bitterness, a fruity/citric sourness, a light malt sweetness and a slightly briny cream.  M: Stunningly thick mouthfeel; this one is full, syrupy & sticky. Little carbonation. Rich, rich, rich!  D: Whew, this can only achieve a good '4"" because of the harshness of the bittering and the overpowering hops. My tastes are for a more balanced DIPA; this is a hop-head's dream beer.

I smelled a lot of different fruit but still got the hop smell. It simply tasted great. Next to DFH 90, this was my favorite Double IPA so far. A bit less alcoholic than the DFH and you can tell in the taste. Good carbonation gave it a deep mouthfeel.

863,7971,jbsteiny,4.66,"On tap at Toronado in SF, this fine ale only bolstered my East Coast awe at the very name of Russian River. The bartender told me that it was an IPA, so I was surprised to read that it was 8% ABV, as it went down so easily. The beer's real strength is in its masterful hop bouquet (pine, mango, grapefruit) which fills one's nostrils to the brim, yet relents when hitting the tongue. Extraordinarily well balanced, these mighty hop flavors part, allowing the sweet bready malts to emerge. The only hop flavor to make it to the finish line is the resinous pine, which (in the humble opinion of this reviewer), keeps this beer from perfection. Aside from that bitterness, the mouthfeel manages to be creamy & crisp, a remarkable feat, and this ale goes down incredibly easy.

The liquid is a thick clear orange with very good carbonation. Lots of swirling bubble trying to figure out which way is up. The Head came up big a full two fingers in a pint glass. Yes this bottle help up just fine. Great job guys.  The smell is a slightly sweet lightly pine like hoppy aroma with orange and apricot note.  The taste is very nice, not a over the top as on would expect just a very good hoppy experience. the alcohol is not noticeable, the hoppy finish is well supported by a good malty background. the overall impression is between a big IPA and a DIPA. it is mild not harsh just a true and enjoyable brewing gem.

863,7971,Damian,4.19,"Drank on-tap at Toronado, San Francisco, CA  Poured a clear, golden amber (lighter than anticipated) with no head but rather a small layer of white froth. No lacing whatsoever.  The incredibly fragrant aroma was a blend of sugary, fruity notes and a boatload of hops. Sweet tropical fruits (peaches, mangoes and pineapple) melded beautifully with the citrusy, grapefruit-like cascade hops.  The taste was extremely hoppy and bitter, yet it still managed to maintain some semblance of balance. The malts made their presence known initially but quickly took a back seat to the huge hoppy flavor. Super piney, bitter, grapefruit-like hops lasted from beginning to end. The finish was very tannic and dry with a resonating piney hoppiness. Though mild at 8% ABV, the alcohol was still remarkably well hidden for this figure.  Mouthfeel was outstanding. The lush, creamy and full body was absolutely amazing. If it were not for this suppleness in the mouthfeel, I believe the hops could have taken on an unwanted astringency.  All in all, this was a huge beer. It was unquestionably one of the hoppiest and most bitter double IPA's I have sampled, and also one of the most flavorful.",Russian River Brewing Company,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,100

INSANE lacing, the suds are so sticky they'll probably have to sandblast the residue off the glass. Good retention.  S: If somebody suffocated you with a sack of hops, this would be your dying whiff. Monstrous pine, grapefruit, some sweet citrus, citrus rind, a medley of floral notes.  T: An outrageous amount of hops, but the blend and balance therein makes this beer special. Never acrid or overpowering, the citrusy flavors stand stable. A perfect amount of doughy caramely malt loiters in this festival of hops.  M: Carbonation is crisp, mouthfeel is very smooth.

I've had this beer on several occasions at the brewpub in Santa Rosa, and was very pleased to see that the nearly 3000 mile trip from California did not do this beer a bit of harm.  The beer pours a brilliant, hazy orange color, with a huge, pesistent head. The beer has excellent lacing as well, and an aroma of citrus and pine resin erupts from the glass. It doesn't get much better then this. On the palate this is truly hop nectar. The palate is absolutely assualted with fruity citrus, with just a hint of sweetness. The beer is impecably well balanced, with no off flavors. There is very little sweetness in the finish, which in my mind is a good thing. The hoppy citrus and dryness really keeps the malt from becoming overwhelming in the finish. The beer has a very nice creamy mouthfeel, and is an absolute joy to drink.

The smell is nothing short of a joyous occasion; some pine resin, lemon, grapefruit, and some extra dankness that reminds one of the tropics. Bitter, resinous pine greets the tongue leading to some lemon and grapefruit, followed by more of the pine resin. Incredibly bitter, yet the hop flavor still overpowers the pure bitterness of it. Soft carbonation at about medium levels, body is medium with lingering hoppy finish. Crazy drinkable.

Color is light golden to gold. Head is thick head with a great great lacing. The smell of hops is fruity and citrus-y. The balance of hop character is very nice. I smell sweet orange and some slight lemon flavors in the backround. The taste is very hoppy and light in body. This is a more drinkable beer than I ever imagined. It's like a beer you could sit down and just drink 4-5 and love every minute of it. Mouthfeel is very good and the bubbles make a silky mouthfeel that's wonderful.

Translucent gold color, subtle carbonation that struggles to the surface. Pine resin & grapefruit aroma wafts from the glass.. Soft biscuity malt sweetness remains mostly helpless in containing the relentless hops (which is fine by me). Amazing citrus flavors blend together very well.

Lots of citrusy hops - grapefruit and lemons are all over the place. A little bit of pine and even a pastry-like pie crusty smell.  The taste is great - strong hop bitterness - grapefruit and lemons, and a bit of a bready flavor. The mouthfeel was medium with a dry finish.

As it warms it mellows out and the alcohol is barely evident. Great clean mouthfeel followed by the piney hop oil that stays in the palate for quite some time.

A half inch of pure white tightly bubbled foam sits atop and hangs around.  Aroma of sweet tangerine, some honey and understated pine, some citric peel.  Flavor is initially sweet citrus, some clover and honey. Stays fruity and juicy as it rolls across the tongue, but becomes more bitter as it finishes, turning to grapefruit and pine, which lingers as the ABV warms the back of the mouth.  Full and rich mouthfeel, satisfying. Morphs to a carb tingle, finishes dry and crisp.  Great drink, very even, not overly powerful in any respect, and very flavorful.

863,7971,willjschmidt,4.88,"Served on-tap at the Wine Exchange of Sonoma.  A: A light amber color. Surprising for a DIPA since they are usually darker. It's so light that it's actually a bit transparent. A nice white head forms that leaves a lot of lacing.  S: A classic IPA aroma of citrus and pine. A little lighter than some other DIPA's but the this one already comes across as clean and balanced from the nose.  T: Absolutely delicious. I love IPA's and DIPA's and this is the best I've ever tasted. Great balance between the malty start and an assertive (but not too assertive) hop presence. I love that the hops are prominent yet the aftertaste is only slightly bitter and lingers for just the right amount. The tastes are big and dominant yet smooth and even. Everything is perfect and it all blends together and works so well. A ""5"" on the taste scale if there ever was one.  M: Excellent mouthfeel, smooth and slightly creamy.  D: I'd been waiting to try this beer and I had a lot of expectations and it met and exceeded every one. An incredibly smooth, balanced and drinkable beer.

Aroma is impressive to say the least; complex! Lots of pine in the nose upfront with some grapefruit, peach and slight rose notes.  This is one of the best double IPA's I have ever tasted. Huge fresh hop presence. Juicy like quality up front with some sweetness. Pungent grapefruit, orange, and pine flavors. Light caramel flavors in the middle. Finishes with a wallop of clean bitterness that doesn't linger on the tongue too much.  Light carbonation and higher attenuation (for style) make this an extremely drinkable beer. Almost too drinkable.  One of my favorite beers. Best Double IPA in my opinion. Two hours to obtain this beer is a very small price to pay.",Russian River Brewing Company,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,100
863,7971,jsbrendle,4.82,"I was lucky enough to be invited to a private tasting at the local Austrian joint of some growlers picked up by the too kind hosts some few days back on a rather long road-trip. The couple of days' time in the growlers did hurt carbonation levels, rendering the beers somewhat flat. Not prime condition for certain, but far better than never being able to sample.  Appearance was a clear golden-amber in the 5oz ""beer expo"" glass I was using for sampling. As I indicated, by no fault of its own the carbonation levels were quite low so there was no head unless swirled to create one, in which case there were still some nice white bubbles possible. Aroma was a big dose of hops, the sort of sharp & grapefruity sort. There was a whiff of alcohol in there too. Flavor was nice... my kind of hop:malt balance. I was reminded of several other DIPAs I care for.  A poor food choice (szegediner krautfleisch, a dish full of hot and mild paprika, large pieces of garlic, long-simmered kraut and tender pieces of pork loin) on my part rendered the other beers I was sampling (the Younger included) watery and bland, but this beer still cut through. Prudence said to hold off on further sampling until after dinner. My favorable impression of the beer improved once all those big spicy flavors were washed away by some water. To my taste there was a nice sweet malty backbone to the beer that supports the hops, there is clearly some alcohol there but it is well masked and ends up with a slightly drying quality to the finish. The 8% does decrease long-term drinkability, but treated with appropriate respect. Oh, wow. Amazing stuff.",Russian River Brewing Company,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,100
863,7971,nlmartin,4.8,"Mad Beer Karma to Clockworkorange for sending me this growler. The beer was served in an Imperial Nonic.  Appearance: This beer has the coloration of iced tea. The beer color is orange amber combination. The head was off white approximatly 1/2 inch high. The retention of the head was perfect. A thick webbing of lacing remained behind on my glass.  Smell: I knew this was going to be a great beer experience as soon as I cracked the growler open. My nose was greated by an symphony of hops. Upon pouring into my glass I could better appreciate the smell. I was experiencing full on lupilin shift as the hops hit my nose. The hops provided a combination of smells pine resin, tangerine, grapefruit and other floral notes.  Taste: The taste of the beer was mostly pine and grapefruit. Then the beer went briefly sweet with malt. This quickly gave way to a drying bitterness with a touch of grass.  Mouthfeel/ Drinkability: The beer has a very creamy smooth medium body. The carbonation is perfect. The flavors mesh together very well. This was a most excellent beer drinking experience. I split the growler with my wife and was sorry I had to split it. I think I could have drank several of these back to back. In summation this is bliss in a glass.",Russian River Brewing Company,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,100

Served at about 50 degrees to get the perfect amount of sweat on the glass during this warm Central Coast day. Smell: The best smelling beer I have ever put up to my nose. Hops are over the top but still incredibly balanced in the nose. Tast: Creamy, smooth, with a bitter hop kick that rolls perfectly on the tongue. Mouthfeel: Great considering all the hops, malt and alcohol in this one. Drinkablility: I could drink this beer all day everyday for the rest of my life.

APPEARANCE: Amber bronze in color with not too much of a head at all.  SMELL: Perfectly subdued, yet extremely aromatic. Citrus, floral, and a hint of strawberry. Huge smells without being sickeningly sweet. Simply perfect.  TASTE: Huge flavors of the same floral, pine, and citrus, and everything is up front and in your face. A thick malt backing exists but can't seem to break through the huge hops flavors. No sticky sweetness whatsoever.  MOUTHFEEL: Very syrupy with a fine-bubbled carbonation. Nice.

The beer was a nice orange in color and there was a fair head. The smell is absolutly wonderfull. Sweet hops abound. The taste was very hoppy too with bitterness but not chemical like bitterness. Just a nice sweet hoppy beer that I would certainly drink daily if I could. The mouthfeel was nice and sticky and the beer was well balanced, even at 8%. This beer is worth the hype and I would advise you to try it if you like hops.

Pours golden and slightly amber-ish with a nice, rock steady head. Sticking your nose in the glass in one of the true pleasures in craft beer - lots of sweet, fruity hops and caramel malt in a near perfect symphony. Tastes like it smells, only better. Resinous, sweet citrus hop candy with just the right balance of caramel and biscuity malts. It glides across your tongue and finishes super clean, a bit dry and with no alcohol burn. For me, this beer defines everything a IIPA should be. Extremely drinkable, sessionable - a brewing masterpiece.

It has a very complex hop aroma to it. Slight malt body in there also. T-Big fruit juices just coming out all over in the flavor. This is all mixed in with some pine hops also. Malt comes through a bit and gives the hops a nice platform to stand on. Nice big bitterness is left on the tongue afterward along with the flavors of fruit juices (like grapefruit, orange, and others along those lines) and pine. M-Full body with low, to maybe just scratching a little on medium, carbonation. D- I think this is REALLY good! First time I tried it (just had a sip) I think I missed A LOT!

Taste: This immediately tastes what you think of when someone says the word 'beer'. One drink brings forth a blend of malt and hop. The taste keeps coming drink after drink. As the beer warms the flavor remains just as potent on the last drink as the first.  Overall: A truely great beer. Much more balanced and drinkable than its younger brother. The two most incredible things about this beer are the great hop quality and the amazing balance. Definately a beer I would put in my all time top 10.,Russian River Brewing Company,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,100
863,7971,rkuhnel,4.75,"his was on-draft in a 16 oz glass from the Russian River Brewpub in Santa Rosa. I have heard a lot about this, so was looking forward to seeing if it lived up to its reputation. The brews were all listed in various color chalks on a board behind the bar, and according to it this one checked in at 92 BUs and 8% ABV. When it was set in front of me I could smell the hops from two feet away. This one is potent! The odor just leaps out of the glass with piney and floral hops. You dont need to take a big sniff to get what is going on here. Besides the hops, there are also some wonderful rich malts, nuts toffee, caramel, and fruit. I cannot imagine a beer smelling any better than this. As a pub pour it came without any head, but after drinking off the first inch, and almost swooning in the process, I swirled it and got a nice fat off-white head that left lots of fat chunks of lacing on the sides of the glass. A beautiful light orange, this is a feast for the eyes and as the head slowly settles down you are so taken by its overall beauty you almost hate to disturb it. The flavor is similar to the nose, and while the malts and the hops dominate, there is a serious bitter finish worthy of a DIPA. The mouthfeel was excellent, very rich and creamy and simply glides across the teeth and tongue. It tastes just as good going down the pipe as it did at first sip. The brew is simply incredible. It has that wonderful bitterness that all great DIPAs should have, and hides the alcohol very well. It is too bad this is only available on tap, because I would love to share this with my friends so they can appreciate it also. I have been saving a score this high for just a brew like this. Ranks with the best beer I have every had the pleasure of drinking. Maybe Pliny the Younger will be that perfect 5.0 if I ever get to taste it",Russian River Brewing Company,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,100

Aroma: If they bottled the aroma as a perfume and put it on my wife I would not be able to keep my hands, lips or ____ off of her. Lot's of tropical fruit. Mango is the most noticable. Flavor: Believe the hype! It is that good. Although it may not be what you are expecting. I've had more bitter DIPAs with the in your face hops, but I haven't had a better DIPA. Hop profile is true to the nose with heavy mango, pineapple, grapefruit flavors. Nice sweet honey like malt flavors and just a touch of the alcohol shines through to warn you to not drink this like a marathon runner drinks Gatorade. Mouthfeel is silky smooth, crisp and yet hoppy.

863,7971,northernbrews,4.67,"Handbottled 22oz bottle from the PtE handbottling project in PA. Received in a trade from BeerBeing.  Thanks again Alex for the opportunity to try this rare beauty.  Appearance: Pours a clear orangish-yellow with a nice two finger off-white head. The head leaves some nice lace as it slowly fades. They did a great job with getting the carbonation right on this one.  Aroma: I was hoping the hand-bottling wouldn't hurt the aroma on this. The only way to get a better aroma, you'd have to sniff straight hops. Truely fantastic aroma. Starts off with pine, grapefruit, apricots, and slight alcohol. This is balanced out by some nice malt notes. This is the exact aromas I want from a Double IPA. Not overkill, but just right.  Taste: The taste is less pronounced thatn the aromas. Some of this may be due to the hand-bottling. Lots of the same flavors are there, just not as intense. Pine, apricots, and grapefruit are balanced by some nice malt.  Mouthfeel: The hop flavors coat the roof of my mouth for a little bit. They make my tongue tingle a bit. I wish this were a little more creamy followed by more hop tingle. I'm sure both of these would be much better if this was fresh and not hand-bottled.  Drinkability: This is very tasty and balanced. The hops are the focus, but the malt balance these out to make this dangerously drinkable. This drinks better than most IPAs...I wish I had more of this.  Overall: This is one of the best IPA's I've ever had. I can see why this keeps racking up the medals for Russian River. If I were drinking this fresh from the tap in Santa Rosa, it would likely get straight 5's. This is one of the many beers that have put Russian River on the map. I just wish Vinnie would start bottling this and more importantly shipping these wonderful beers to MI.  If you see any Russian River product, especially this one, you'd be a fool not to pick it up, because if you don't, you'll be missing out on one of the best beers from the Best Brewery in the World (in my opinion).",Russian River Brewing Company,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,100

Bubbles range from tiny to the large ones at the surface. Lots of carbonation gives life to the beer.  Smell: Aromas of pine and grapefruit are heavy. Sandalwood, cedar, and leather. Very big aromas but not as floral as other DIPAs.  Taste: Bittering hops aplenty. Pine is the foremost flavor followed by some citrus and a buttery cream finish. For this reason I think this beer shine with its complexity. From the strong aroma, to the pine and then the creamy finish makes it unlike most beers. It's a roller coaster that ends on a very satisfying note.  Mouthfeel: Pinchy at first with hops and carbonation. The creamy finish is outstanding and make the aftertaste desirable. Smoothe and quenching.  Drinkability: Awesome. This is a spectacular beer. The hoppiness isn't going to knock you down and the soft finish will keep you coming back for more.

863,7971,jasonjlewis,4.38,A great beer. More mild than pliny the younger with less of an in your face smell.

Medium copper color with a thin white cap that lasts until the end. Fast-rising tiny bead rising from bottom of glass. First smell reminded me of HopSlam, honestly. Has a sweet citrusy/grapefruity smell that I absolutely love in a big IPA. Could sit and sniff this for quite a while. First taste was unbelieveably smooth and sweet with a bitterness bash coming in mid-palate and lasting quite a long time. As it warms, the malty tones makes themselves known and it turns into a piney bitterness. I adjusted to the bitterness rather quickly and found this to be fairly well-balanced. Definitely full-bodied and sticky. Resiny feel left behind and there is little carbonation felt on tongue. Awesome and sneaky drinkability; deceptively smooth.

I've had this beer on tap and from growlers many times and I must say this sample from the bottle is virtually indistinguishable from the tapped version. Much, much better than what you would get from a growler. Appears a clear golden amber color with two fingers of off white head. A fair amount of lacing clings to the glass as I make my way to the bottom. Smells of fresh, piney hops, sweet malts, grapefruit, apricot and a pleasant grassy note.

863,7971,uberabr,4.5,"Had this on tap at RR on Saturday. This is a great brewery that Ive been wanting to visit now for quite a while. There's nothing supernatural about these beers, most of the appeal is how hard they are to find, but they are pretty damn good and you can tell the brewery as a whole ascribes to a level of quality and dedication that is surprisingly rare in this business. For some reason this brewery attracts a lot of sketchy-looking patrons, and the staff aren't exactly brain surgeons either, but I felt right at home anyway.  Drank from a pint. The bartender was this angry-looking skinhead who apparently either never learned how to pour a beer, or learned at Dodger stadium. This was a little upsetting. Appearance is a light yellow amber with some golden hues and some haziness. No head to speak of, thanks bartender. Carbonation and lacing were exquisite.  Hops, hops, and more hops. Smell is moderate but indicative of what's to come. Loads of cascade and a variety of other hops come together to give a fresh piney, grapefruit goodness. Nothing spectacular about the smell alone, although this could be due to the lack of head. Taste is bitter up front but well rounded, piney with delicate fruits and rich complexity of mild malts, all with a lingering early-hop pine backbone. Mouthfeel is full and bubbly. Drinkability, like all RR beers, is superb.",Russian River Brewing Company,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,100

S: I already knew how great this beer tasted before I decided to review it, but the aroma doesn't live up to the flavor IMO. Some nice notes of the grapefruit/pine and maltiness that is to come, but the scents don't do the beer justice.  T: I'm not sure words in the English language have yet to be created to describe the godliness of this beer. An immediate blast of sweet grapefruit hoppiness blasts the tongue, followed by a delicious and tantalizing mixture of additional maltiness, and finishing with a piney bitterness. This beer is perfect. Fact.  M: So creamy, so perfectly carbonated, so good. In the words of Frank the Tank, ""it's so good, when it hits your lips.""  D: Well, hate to penalize it at ALL, but it's TOO drinkable and at 8% ABV, just one growler is pushing the limits. A superbly dangerous drinker.

863,7971,Budlum,4.63,"Pouring this beer produces a generous inch of foamy and creamy white head that holds and clings to the glass indefinitely. The body is slightly hazy and a pale amber color.  This beer smells incredibly fresh throughout. Pine aromas absolutely dominate the smells beyond only a hint of citrus.  A huge rush of hops hit the tongue and hold for an entire sip. Flavors of pine and citrus blend together with a honey taste which never present themselves too strongly. A very lemon-like bitterness hits the tongue blending with black pepper for what is a very long, hop-flavored finish.  The mouthfeel presents a good viscous feel and a balanced tingle on the tongue but just feels a little too flat.  Drinkability with this beer is close to perfect. The hop strength is amazing but I don't get tired of this after a glass.

This was served with a light, bone-white head with little retention. It was sunshine-yellow in color with a light cloudiness. The nose was like sniffing a pine tree and singed some of my nose hairs.

A big head forms out of nothing almost instantly. Some would receeed but in large part it stayed. A glowing amber hue. A coppery, piney, vibrant green aroma. Nice candy-like finish. Great tangerine type hops. A beautiful flavour, full of composure and finesse. I think I like their 'wild ale' stuff better, but this is a good offering too! Actually, this is one of the few beers (especially for the style) that actually got better as it warmed. Seemed from the start this was good, but I wouldn't have said all that great.

863,7971,Phatz,4.6,"WOW. I finally had the opportunity try this beer I have been seeking months. I have to admit it was a bit anticlimactic. My expectations were set so high I wanted a holy experience and this only *exceptional* and that was it. I guess with all the excellent DIPAs we have access to the competition is tough. I had this on tap at Capone's Russian River night and there were a lot of distractions. I brought home a growler so I will make more comments from that and the keg later. From notes:  Appearance: Served a transparent golden color with glimmers of amber and lots of carbonation clearly fueling the frothy white head.  Smell: Intense. Wow is it immense resinous piney hops. A lady I spoke to at the bar said 'cat pee' because it so bold. If that is true it is the most perfumey sweet citrusy pee I ever smelled. Floral hops do dominate but a fruity sweet peach is and sugar is detectable as well.  Taste: It is everything I expect in a DIPA. You would expect a more rough feel and hard to drink beer at this IBU and ABV but it is so well blended it is almost hard to pick out the actual flavors in the beer. Grapefruit and pine and caramel and peach and more acidic citrusy fruits and flowers... mmm.  Mouthfeel: For as bitter as this beer is the body is thick and oily and very smooth through the center, surrounded by hop prickles and a dry finish.  Drinkability: I could drink this all day and night. You would never know the 8% ABV if you never moved. It is simply exceptional.   [EDIT: The growler was an even better experience. The impressiveness of this beer does stand out when the beer is served at the right temperature and you turn your thought to is complexity and balance wow! What a treat!]  Hope this is helpful.

Given it was a shipped growler from 2 days ago, I had to pour a little faster to get a nice head of foam. It worked and stuck around for a few minutes, leaving some delicate lacing. I'm sure the head retention is far better fresh.  S: Smells of stinging citrus and very sweet sugar. Mesmerizing hop bouquet that you would expect from a bucket of hops in the dry hopping.  T: Lupulin out the wazoo. Damn that's good. Citrus hops delivered via a smoothed, yet very sweet malt punch.  MF: Aggressive hop burn that makes your tongue shrivel and your teeth melt.  Stomach feel: Being eaten by alpha acids!  D: Probably the best characteristic of the elder is that its only 8%. Though that's a high ABV, it's more manageable than the Younger. I *want* to drink the whole growler in one sitting, but I have to pace myself given that it's unlikely I'll see it again anytime soon. Absolutely lived up to the hype. I think the Younger is a greater treat for hop heads, but this one is plenty good while the Younger is aging.",Russian River Brewing Company,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,100
863,7971,hoppymeal,4.3,"Pours a coppery burnt orange and clear with an off white head that slowly recedes. Aroma is big on the citrusy hops, a nice sweet red grapefruit, orange rind, and a nice light cotton candy malt sweetness. Taste is a very nice sweet florida orange, just that right amount of citrusy sweetness balanced by the bitterness of the rind and membrane. Creamy and soft malty body shows a nice spicy pepperiness and just a hint of alcohol. There is a nice lingering mild dryness to the finish. A very well balanced beer, nothing is out of control or over the top, mouthfeel is very nice, soft malts and bitterness blend together very well. Taste is like eating fresh citrus fruit, yum. Thank you Beerbeing for the opportunity.",Russian River Brewing Company,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,100
863,7971,Bighuge,4.92,"New Review (11-3-08):  Hazed golden body with some shimmering orange highlights. Bubbly white head caps the golden nectar and leaves some moderate patches of lace as I drink. The aroma is as good as it gets. The stuff Hop Wet Dreams are made of. Just pure juicy hop nectar and all the tropical fruit nuances you could imagine from nectarine to tangerine to grapefruit.... The flavor, in turn, takes everything contained on the nose and adds one key element....POT. This beer is almost like drinking pot. With some tangerine mixed in. Very resinous and oily. This is great. Bitterness is VERY clean. No abrasiveness at all.  I'd like to do a double backside ""extra secret"" unassisted triple play blind tasting of Hop Slam, Pliney and Dreadnaught. Those are what I consider the 3 TOP DIPAs around.  Old Review: 1-13-07 (4.5,5.0,4.5,4.5,5.0)  Clear deep golden appearance. Thick and frothy slightly off white head. Retention is solid as is the lacing that comes in droopy sheets. The scent of this beer is fabulous. The perfect combination of resinous, oily, piney and citric hop characteristics. A little sugar coated pineapple and some definite cannabis lingering. Hops assault the palate first, but surprisingly, the bitterness is not as noticeable. This has a fairly clean bitterness to it. And it lingers a little bit. But the hop qualities dance all over the tongue. Pineapple and bong resin and leather... It's pungent and oily and kind of greasy.... But I like that in a DIPA. And this is no exception. The malt is clearly around for a backing and not for many taste sensations. It's got a kind of toffeeish feel to it. It's appropriate for this style of beer. The body is fairly big....medium-full or so. Carbonation is spot on. Drinkability is through the roof. (Won't have any problem tackling this growler.) A/V of 8% is barely noticeable. This is top notch DIPA.  In my early years here, a BA mentioned this beer to me as one I had to try. Maybe 4-5 years ago. It's been on the back burner for quite some time and now I've finally got a chance to have at it. And it comes, with many thanks, to a top notch guy...The Long Beach Bum. Thanks a ton for setting me up with this nectar.",Russian River Brewing Company,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,100
863,7971,isaac,4.77,"my most anticipated beer to date, at a most anticipated bar, toronado in sf. pint glass.  A - Clear, pale orange/amber body and was placed on the bar with a 1/2 fingered head, sinking to film on top of the brew and clumpy lacing down the glass.  S - Big hops smell (pine, grapefruit, pineapple, various citrus) with sharp, peppery notes from the alcohol, and a thin malt presence.  T - Hoppy (re: Smell) but with more complex malts in the finish with notes of breadiness and a sort of savory vibe going on. that said, this is, like so many of the beers i've tried in the past year, a showcase for the hops - delicious oils and resins combine with refreshingly crisp citrus and an unbelievable lingering, cool (as in, temperature and feel) flavour. alcohol is well masked.  M - Smooth and yet crisp medium body with medium to high levels of carbonation.  D - Excelent! this did not let me down.",Russian River Brewing Company,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,100
863,7971,Westsidethreat,4.05,"A: Immediatetly I notice the vibrant copper color, with a very nice anitque white head of fluffy, small bubbles. Nice lace is already forming on the sides, yet this head should last awhile.  S: By the alcohol content, I assume this will be a strong beer, and the very prevalent smell supports that hypothesis. Grapefruit and pine are cut with berries to mellow out the sour and add some sweetness.  T: Wow - immediately after the first sip it's evident that this is a different flavor than most DIPAs possess. More Fuji apple than anything else. Then it ends with a pine flavor laced with sugar chunks, followed by the traditional bittersweet note. It's actually a bit young & green tasting...ironic given the name.  M: Good carbonation, medium bodied, but the liquid glides down quickly, without lingering in the mouth.  D: I'm actually a bit underwhelmed with this beer compared to my expectations. The simplicity was unexpected, and I was left wanting a bit more. Don't get me wrong, this is a good beer. Great with food, impressive if it's on tap next to the likes of your standard liquor store on the corner beers. But it pales in comparison to the great DIPAs of the world.",Russian River Brewing Company,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,100
863,7971,RidiculedDisplay,4.74,"On-tap at Hollingshead.  Appearance: Pours a amberish straw color, with a 2 and a half finger head which settles to a nice half-finger foam. Lacing is thick and sheet-like upon swirling. Pretty nice looking, but not that pretty of a body color compared to say, 90-Minute IPA or some other DIPA's out there.  Smell: Wow. A familiar smell after one tries out some of the better DIPA's out there, but this is exceptional even among the greats. Grapefruit, orange hop aromas are the most prominent on the front end, with pine and floral on the back. Simply juicy smelling. Some caramely, somewhat unidentifiable sweet notes also break through. Great.  Taste: Thick and juicy orange and grapefruit, bordering on pear and mango hop flavors. Mmm. Pine and light floral on the back end. Candied sugarey sweetness, a little maltey backbone. I think the beauty of this one is that, unlike some of its cousins, Elder retains that incredible hop punch without seeming too ""heavy."" Hard to explain to a degree, but I suppose what I'm trying to say is that the alcohol is virtual imperceivable. The flavors, too, blend together in perfect unison. It's far more easily quaffable than a Yule Smith, for instance, which is just as amazing in hop profile, but leaves one pausing more over the sheer ""weight"" its flavor seems to carry with it. Anyway, I'm digressing, but I'm trying to convey just how simultaneously rich and drinkable this beer is.  Mouthfeel: Juicy juicy juicy. Light carbonation.  Drinkability: An amazing IPA. I've enjoyed many world class DIPA's lately, and Elder did not disappoint. Again, I think its beauty is in how (somehow) Vince managed to make this simultaneously so packed full of hop amazingness and yet not make the brew entirely overpowering. Fantastic craftsmanship.",Russian River Brewing Company,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,100
863,7971,warriorsoul,4.69,"Thanks to the ever-so generous zrrbrrt for a growler fill of this gem...in PA nonetheless. Pale orange in color with a half finger of white head...most of which fades rapidly and some spotty lacing. Citrus punch in the nose...mainly grapefruit with a slight caramel malt backbone. Taste is phenomenal...huge orange/grapefruit hop profile. Just enough bitterness to stay true to the style and just enough malt to add some sweetness to the offering. Alcohol is nowhere to be found...have no idea how this could be 8%. Finishes bitter, but very clean. Mouthfeel is medium-bodied...a bit thinner than your typical double...drinkability is wicked good.

Much better balance noticed on-tap at both Solena Beach and Port Carling Pizza Ports just 7 weeks later. Three-and-a-half years later, in-your-face hops, but drinkable.

863,7971,flexabull,4.97,"I have had this before, but I finally got to have another one this afternoon at the brewery and properly review the Great Pliney The Elder. And boy, did I forget how great this one is.  Beer pours a bright, clean and clear copper color. Head is good, but just slightly weak for my tastes. (A bit of a nick pick here...)  Aromas are AWESOME! You don't have to get your nose close to notice the great floral hop smell.  Flavors are just as great as the aroma. A big huge mouthfeel is the first thing I notice, then a blast of fresh hop bitterness... hops taste of big pine flavors and some citrus like notes. Beer finishes with a touch of malt sweetness, and just the slightest note of alcohol. It's just enough alcohol not to knock you around, but enough to remind you that you are drinking a BIG beer.  Although this is a fairly high alcohol beer, I order this anytime I see it on draft. (which isn't often enough) An excellent beer. One of my all time favs.",Russian River Brewing Company,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,100
863,7971,CRJMellor,4.54,"Poured a clear, light amber, gold and orange color with a fluffy, slightly off-white head. Tons of pillowy lace on the pint glass. Aroma had an abundance of fresh, resined, oily hop notes. Very floral in a deep, kind of oily way. Aggressive hops obviously dominate but a hint of caramel and citrus fruits sneak out, especially as the beer warms in the hand. Flavor is well balanced to start but the hop bitterness just keeps increasing. Almost too hoppy is a phrase that would come to mind for me. A little more malt presence would provide a tad better balance. Still great just absolutely palate blowing with the IBUs Mouthfeel is very solid with the right levels of carbonation and some malt profile. Again if you love hops this might be the quintessential hop ride of your life. Just keeps climbing the IBU mountain. Drinkability is solid but I like my beers with a tad more balance than this one. Much more drinkable the warmer it got as the maltiness and floral notes seemed to release more. re-rated May-14 after visit to brewery. this really is the quintessential American DIPA",Russian River Brewing Company,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,100
863,7971,JohnnyM2002,4.42,"Sampled on-tap into a pint glass; let it sit for about 15-20 minutes before I took my first sip.  A - Burnt copper color with a foamy head & good retention.  S - Powerful aroma of sweet hops. Exactly what you'd want and expect from a Double IPA - strong hop smell with a grassy/citrus background.  T - Extreme hop punch, but no real bitterness. The sweet aroma is lacking in the taste, as more of a grassy/pine flavor joins the powerful hops. Finishes with a tingling of citrus...the alcohol is noticable but not overpowering.  M - Not a heavy body - rather unexpected. Finishes very crisp and bold.  D - Overall, the best tasting and most well-balanced double IPA I've had. The high ABV doesn't come through in the taste as much as you would expect. Definitely lived up to the hype.",Russian River Brewing Company,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,100
863,7971,SacoDeToro,4.42,"On tap at Russian River Brewing in Santa Rosa.  The aroma was wonderfully pungent. The nose was dominated by an explosive burst of resiny and citrusy hops. A light and sweet maltiness poked through at the end. West coast all the way baby!  The flavor of the beer was primarily that of citrusy hops (duh) with enough of a light caramel maltiness to help round things out. As potent (and lovely) as the hops were, they were very smooth. The beer was well attenuated and wasn't smackingly sweet, which is were I feel that most double IPAs are susceptible to loosing points. The beer had a very ""bright"" taste and a nice spiciness that I prefer in DIPAs.  The mouthfeel was crisp and the carbonation seemed dialed in just right. The beer was well attenuated and crisp at 8.0%, it was in no way too heavy and very drinkable.  On a bragging note, I was lucky enough to be at RR Brewing when they had 5 IPAs on Tap: Pliny the Elder, Pliny the Younger, Summit IPA, Plind Pig, and RR IPA.

Smell is very citrusy with some floral freshness. Lots of sweeter fruity malt flavors as well. Taste is similar. Orange dominated but there's more of a resin piney flavor that what I smelled. Underlying tropical sweetness the whole way through but it's quite bitter. Hops hit their high point about midway through but the finish is a bit weak. Sweetness comes through a bit more at the end. Body is a touch lighter than I might have hoped. This beer really has a nice balance of malts and hops and alcohol for a DIPA. Very drinkable. The mouthfeel and finish could have been a touch better.

863,7971,sleazo,4.74,"On tap at O Briens.  What can i say, i am a hop head and this clearly delivers. Elder is a reddish copper beer with a fairly small head. The aroma is of hops, hops and more hops. I would give this a 5.5 if i could for the aroma. Tastewise this is exactly what i want out of a double IPA. A true hop monster that overwhelms the tongue with resiny citrusy goodness. It is a little thin in my opinion but still had a nice bite to it. The alcohol level is present but it is kind of hidden so you could drink a few of these before it hits you.  A very fine example of a Double IPA.

S - This is like sticking your nose in a bowl of crushed hops, or maybe like snorting the resin. Smooth pine mostly with lighter citrus (orange). An excellent aroma. No malt at all though.  T - Strong pine resin upfront. No malt profile. The flavor is pine with a bit of lemon, orange and pineapple underneath. Not really bitter at all. That surprised me. Very enjoyable.  M - Smooth, thin, very refreshing.  D - Excellent. I would never have guessed the strength of this one. It is a beer that lives up to the hype. It was an awesome experience for sure.

Edit: Had a fresh bottle (2 actually) today (3-17-11) and it seemed off. The flavors weren't as juicy and there was a dry grassiness to it, more so than the others I've had.

All the flavors from the scent are here, the hop flavor is so juicy! The yeast works with the malt really well here too, the interplay is so beautiful. Only question is whether this is a 4.5 or a 5 in taste, tough call. Mouthfeel is good, slightly dry. Drinkability is exceptional for a beer this strong in taste and alcohol.

Body is an elecric pine sap golden and almost dark enough that it resembles amber. You'd almost expect to find a fossilized hop in it. Great clarity and very active carbonation - it's a sight to behold.  The aroma is intense. Fresh cut spruce, resiny green, but without any acrid smells.  Taste contains a surplus of awesome. Explosion of citrus hops and a long, pitchy bitterness that escorts you through the drink. There's a mouthful of malt that resonates with the bitterness so it doesn't completely overwhelm the palate.

While most of the style seems one dimensional in its hopping, This Pliny had it all.  Appearance: Light amber with a thick (very thick) white head, about 1/4 inch deep. Heavy lacing on the sides of the glass.  Smell: Oranges and grapefruit tookover the nose for me. I'm used to the grapefruit in california, and actually kinda sick of it... but the orange made this near perfect.  Taste: Again the orange adn the grapefruit, but sweeter than in the nose. The subtle underlying malt adds a third layer to this amazing brew. One of the best beers I've ever tasted.  Mouthfeel: Bitter and refreshing as it should but, as well as light bodied. It was all usual for the style, except for the way it fit together in my mouth. Synergy is the key to this beer.

I don't care where I'm at, or what's on tap, if they have Pliny on tapI'm drinking it and drinking it first. This is the only beer to date that I've felt worthy of giving all 5's to and waited a while to finally review it. Beatification was a close second.

863,7971,NoLiberty,4.55,"I had the good fortune of having a pint of Pliny the Elder at the Grey Lodge in Northeast Philadelphia, far from it's land of origin. Despite the distance the beer tasted great. Poured from the tap into an unmarked pint glass a pure gold color with slight orange tones. Light head with some good lacing, but overall the apperance is quite standard, not stand out. The aroma is also subtle, mild but the hop character leads the way with some sweet alcohol in the deep nose. Some notes of honey and light crisp fruit. The taste stands out as the dominant strength in this beer. Wow, it's amazing. A nice big citrus buoquet up front, flower, followed by a good grapefruit and pine finish. Solid sweetness throughout leanding balance to the high notes in the hops. It's solid all around, rounded and quenching. The burps even taste good, like Jagermeister. Stays good from first cold sip to final warmer gulp. Despite the low head the carb is good and adds nice tingle to the hops. Full bodied by not syrupy. Drinkable?

Smells of sweet honey, fresh wheat bread dough, oats, banana and watermelon with a super nectarine, grapefruit, and pineapple, pine sap hop.  Tasted of a sweet light powdery caramel, honey, oats and pizza dough with a great grapefruit and pine sap zap. Whats nice about this is that the sweetness is very prevalent, but not easily identified.  Them mouth feel was medium to heavy bodied with a small creamy carbonation.  Tasty for sure. This kinda tastes how I wish Dreadnaught tasted.",Russian River Brewing Company,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,100
863,7971,DrJay,4.65,"Hazed gold with a faint orange hue. My pint arrived with a short cap of long lasting, cream coloured foam. Lacing was solid and rings formed at each sip. Very nice. The aroma was intense with sweet fruity, floral hops - very distinctive, kind of like fruity candies. Pine and grapefruit were also prominent and there was a light chalkiness or powderiness as well. Wow, this is quite a balanced monster. The bitterness is strong, but is kept in check by the malt until the finish where it lingers along with pine and grapefruit. It starts on the sweet side with a toasty maltiness. The hops (pine and grapefruit) really kick in after this, but stay balanced. There's also a pleasant fruit and floral quality to the hops that show up towards the end. Medium/full bodied, nearly chewy, with a luxurious, creamy texture. Alcohol wasn't apparent. It's scary how easy this goes down. Definitely a world class beer, highly recommended.",Russian River Brewing Company,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,100
863,7971,PeatReek,4.37,"The Elder has a perfectly clear, pale amber body with a thin white lid of foam. The aroma is green; somehow... oh, I know how, it's entirely composed of hops! Piney, resinous, citric, delicious hop aroma. The first sip is likewise a hop attack, very very strong with pine needle and somewhat grassy overtones (but in a good way, I'm not exactly sure how to describe it). It's supported by a crisp maltiness, very dry. Not full bodied; thin if anything, which only accentuates the hop character. Great, great beer. Consistently blocks my attempts to try other IPAs wherever it's on the menu.  P the E is definitely one archetype of West Coast IPAs. Sometimes I prefer the thick, sweet Hop-Rod style, but this beer is an extraordinarily drinkable example of the drier, crispy/hop-domination style, and that's good too. It's hard to describe how drinkable Pliny is. I mean, 8 percent?! I never would have guessed.

The taste is perfectly balanced with a complexity that makes this beer extra special. Starts with crisp, spicy hops that have a nicely balanced profile, followed by some juicy stone fruit flavors in the middle, and finally a long, long very bitter but pleasant finish with a little grapefruit rind at the very end.  The mouthfeel complements the taste perfectly. Medium bodied, crisp, rich and creamy, all at the same time.

Taste is great at first, all the hop flavor is up front followed by the malt, but then the finish is super bitter and the alchohol is kind of harsh, so I'm kind of two minds about this one, the hops is great, but then its a little too bitter and alcoholic for my taste  Mouthfeel is surpisingly light for such a big beer.

863,7971,rayjay,4.92,"Fresh from brewery's taps, 3 weeks old but still fresh! Opens with a bang!  Soft, pillows of foam tower over the beer (4+ fingers), reducing eventually to oily splotches and thick lacing. Reeks with the flowery kind of hops.  Huge, resiny, thick with oils but light enough to enjoy by the mouthfull. Unbelievably hoppy, but so floral that you just can't get enough. Great head retention, and carbonation is light which lets all the hoppy tangyness do a screaming guitar solo. The flavor goes way up your nose. It is so fresh and punchy. Hard to imagine anything hoppier than this.  Malts are there, for sure, as the alcohol also plays a nice part in the delicious taste, not really warm or alcohol-y, more like boozy. You can tell the alcohol is there and it hits you hard but like I said not warm. The alcohol plays well with the oils from the hops and the twangy malts. Mouthfeel is just right, the perfect thickness and not a hair more. Overwhemingly hoppy and yet perfectly balanced.  Gives you that between-the-eyes, ""hop-headache"" each sip.  This was a great session, splitting a growler is perfect. Very well done and cerainly one of my favorites. This beer really re-defines the double IPA, not too thick and massive yet sophisticated hops. Well worth seeking out! A++  And might I add, another perfect candidate for a hand-pump!!!",Russian River Brewing Company,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,100
863,7971,Oxymoron,4.92,"Not so tiny Pliny the Elder. Poured a mostly hazy orange hue with a good head and lacing to match. Superb nose with all the hops you can take. True to the California IPA aroma. A mostly piney aroma, but some grapefruit notes are in there too.  The taste is very hoppy but a very nice malt backing that supports the beer more then I would have expected from the nose. To start, the hops are well balanced and big. The bitterness has a lemony bite that leaves a tart flavor which does its best to tone down the finishing hop flavors. A nice grapefruit and apricot blend finishes and really brings the hops to a finish. A nice sweet caramel malt flavor plays second fiddle in taste but still holds its own.  This really is one of the most elite IPAs out there. The body is on the full side with great appeal. A taste have for the hop lovers for sure.",Russian River Brewing Company,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,100
863,7971,OStrungT,4.67,"This beer is usually on tap at O'Brien's, so I drink it quite a bit. I am a little surprised that I have not reviewed it yet. This beer is great.  This beer pours a straw yellow color, with a thick white head. The head fades slowly, leaving many thick sticky laces.  This beer smells quite hoppy. It smells strongly of piney hops. Some grassy aroma is present. It has a little cirtus aroma also. Grapefruit.  This beer tastes very piney. It has some grassy hop flavor also. It is sweet. The flavor is quite aggressive. This beer has a slight citrus flavor.  This beer is very full bodied. It goes down surprisingly smooth, leaving a piney aftertaste. Good luck tasting other beers after this one.  This beer would probably not be the best choice for a session beer. It is very aggressive. Also, it is a little high in alcohol, making drinking too many a bad choice.",Russian River Brewing Company,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,100

Good nose, lightly sweet with a hint of the hops to come. The hint of pine and citrus meeting malt graces my mouth, good feel, not too heavy or full, and the swallow...now I get that slightly dry, crisp finish with...hmmm a bit of pine again. Wow, I love this beer!!!",Russian River Brewing Company,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,100
863,7971,TheName,4.29,"Tried on tap at the Oregon Brewers' Festival. Started with a 4 oz taster but went back for the full mug.  Poured a nice straw gold with lots of big foamy head which the volunteer told me to nose-oil off (WHA--?!). Head left fairly quick but left nice lacing along the top. Nose was wonderfully tart, citrusy hops but not overwhelming in the least.  First drink came with a perfect malt and a beautifully clean, dry hop remainder. A great light, sweet maltiness with a detectable piny/grapefruity follower. Nice and creamy, big in the mouth but goes down very easily. I could drink this (slowly and carefully) all day and it didn't ruin me for other beers I tried later.  This is how a double IPA should be. I've gotta find a way to get it in Seattle.",Russian River Brewing Company,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,100
863,7971,Brewfan,4.7,"Aquired from my sister Kristen in Cali. Made the trip 2 weeks after purchase, and was delivered in perfect condition. Poured into my Ommegang chalice. Decent thick white head with medium retention. Fine white long-lasting lace. Slightly murky orange color. Automatic pine nose. HUGE hops bouquet. Spicy, not much malt to be desiphered from the smell. Smells very wet. Oh wait. I just put my nose IN the beer. Pineapple fruitness, with citrus pith. Monstrous hop bomb. Like sucking on a hop-laden pine cone. More citrus comes to the front. Some maltiness comes through, but not nearly enough to take away from the hops. Very dry. Nicely balanced and extremely drinkable for a beer so hoppy. Surprisingly, 8% doesn't really come through on the tongue. Makes this even more drinkable.",Russian River Brewing Company,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,100
863,7971,ReDave,4.75,"What a treat! I was surprised to see this on tap. I've read about this, and was wondering if i would get a chance to taste this. Wonderful Hollinghead Deli in Orange apparaenlty has this or one of his nephews on tap regularly. Nice amber color, with good creamy head. Very hoppy/grassy, slightly flower aroma. Very sticky lace all the way down. Very balanced malt and hop flavor, but that could be the hop-head talking. Would love to have a 90 minute, ruination, Buzz Saw, and Pliny the elder taste off.

863,7971,dickroop,4.42,"I strolled from Crown City Brewing down Pasadena's Raymond Avenue to Lucky Baldwin's. The bar in this place quickly revealed why it's so famous. Amongst the MANY taps, I saw 3 brews I had heard so much about, the most famous: Pliny the Elder. ""Make sure you try this one,"" the bar man said, ""when we get in a keg, it's gone in a day or two.""  Served in a 10-oz goblet, it was light golden with a head that didn't quit. The nose was powerful hops with malt backbone for support. Flavor was complex, piney hops with carbohydrate sweetness, and noticeable alcohol. A very pleasant feel, smooth to savor and firm body. Drinkability is down because of too high alcohol for a session brew.  This DIPA seems a likely legendary and a lucky find for me.",Russian River Brewing Company,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,100
863,7971,SethB2,4.89,"Served on tap at Russian River Brewery in Santa Rosa.  The beer was poured a little on the cold side in a typical bar pour manner to prevent to much of a head. Other than that, it looked great. Non transparent, dry-hopped orangish color with a huge amount of lacing. Smell was, well, hoppy. Mainly piney hops, combined with a grapefruit citrisy hop presense. A malt backbone was also there, but had a hard time breaking through the hops. Taste was much like the smell. Great beer. The malts let themselves be known a little more in the taste, leading the way to a very balanced IPA. Mouthfeel and drinkability are both great as well.  I wish they would bottle this stuff. Great, great beer.",Russian River Brewing Company,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,100
863,7971,DaPeculierDane,4.31,"On tap at Toronado. Bright amber orange with a full white head. Head lasts well for an IPA. Body is medium to full with intermittent carbonation attacks. Aroma comes on complexly featuring an appealing amount of pineapple on top of a subtle pine/juniper base. By far, however, the pine is overshadowed by citrus juice, peaches, and grapefruit. The aroma could be described as candy like if it didnt trigger receptors in your brain that say: Warning Hop Blast Acomin! Feels tangy and acidic with a citrus medley blast of lime, lemon, grapefruit, and nectarine. Perfectly balanced (for the style) with a sweet malt base and only residual pine oils in the flavor. More delicate then expected. My tongue is not destroyed after two glasses. I guess that makes this one a drinker.",Russian River Brewing Company,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,100
863,7971,merlin48,4.25,"Many thanks to Redwoodgeorge for this one. This review is of his unauthorized bottling earlier in 2006. Chill hazed, apricot body is topped by a sturdy, offwhite, one finger head that has exceptional retention and deposits a massive amount of patch lacing on the English pint glass. Aroma is brutal. Supra raw hops are guilty of fourth degree assault on the nasal cavities. Pine and freshly grated lime peel wreak havoc. Wow! What a wonderful job this brewery has done by creating such a hopnicient aroma. Mouthfeel is divine. Medium bodied and well carbonated. Hop presence is cutting and pervasive. Taste follows the aroma, with a pervasive presence of fresh leafy hops. If I didn't know better, I would say this brew has been randallized. Tastes like chewing on a pine cone you've just plucked from a Douglas Fir, accented by chewing on freshly sliced lime rind. Malt presence is here, barely enough to add a hint of caramel and salvage drinkability. Finishes dry and bitter, with a hops burn. Pliny The Elder is worthy of its hype, but no match for Pliny The Younger in my judgement. Seek this out. It's worldclass. Thanks, George!",Russian River Brewing Company,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,100
863,7971,scottoale,4.42,"On-tap at my local pub, this poured a deep gold with a 1/2inch of white head in a pint glass. The head dwindled and left some nice lace behind.  The smell...ahhh the smell, super fresh pine-sappy hops rip at your nose, smells like a fresh cut forest, a hop-lovers dream.  The taste starts out hoppy, stays hoppy and then it finishes hoppy...which makes me hoppy er...happy. A nice malt flavor that gets spanked right off the bat, goes a bit citrusy only to be slapped again with a spiky, resinous pine hop finish. Whew...  Good meaty body with some punch and a ton of hops too boot...I need a keg of this stuff. It's a the top of the 2IPA's in my book, a hop lovers MUST!  My hat's off too Russian River...2X well done, Cheers!!!",Russian River Brewing Company,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,100
863,7971,mickeymac,4.8,"On tap from a pint glass at Toronado, the Elder looks very elegant with a thick white blanket of head covering a glowing golden orange. Each drink leaves another level of lace clinging to the glass. The smell is pine, citrus, and loads of malty goodness. The taste is even better, walking a perfect tightrope between the strong malt flavor and the hop bitterness. With every drink, new flavors come out. At times it seems to have almost a candy sweentess, with some drinks caramel, and with other sips a doughy quality. It's almost chewy, with a tremendous mouthfeel. The drinkability is amazing. With an incredible selection at Toronado, I went back for a second Elder. This is one of the best beers I've ever tasted.",Russian River Brewing Company,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,100
863,7971,ggaughan,4.67,"I previously reviewd Pliny the Elder in December when I had it on tap at the Toronado on an earlier vacation. I am reviewing it again as I was lucky enough to get a growler of this fine brew from my local, The Flying Pig in Malvern, PA.  My Pliny the Elder poured a vibrant gold color into a Duvel tulip glass and I was suprised that when I completed the pour a great white head arose from the bottom of the glass and gave me a nice big piney, hoppy aroma that was so refreshing. The taste does not disappoint either. For a hop lover this beer is great. The bitter hoppy taste and citrus on the tongue and all through my mouth make this a very drinkable beer but at around 8% it is dangerous to put down and not have another. You can definitely taste the hops in your mouth long after the beer has gone down your throat as if you are sucking on a pine cone. I will be sure to savor this one over a night or 2 until the growler is all empty.",Russian River Brewing Company,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,100
863,7971,BuckeyeNation,4.92,"Received from RedwoodGeorge as part of his recent Home Bottling Project. Thanks again George.  Sun-fired ochre with lemon drop edges. The alabaster crown is a thing of beauty. It's firmly creamy (and eventually vanilla milkshake melty) and is a lace generator of the highest order. The upper third of the glass is almost completely coated with thick, frosting-like lace. It'd be great to see some hop flecks swimming about, but for a 'clean' DIPA look, it's hard to beat.  I had little doubt that the nose would be dripping with hop esters and I'm happy to report that it is. In terms of absolute resinous pungency, it might take a backseat to the Younger, but it's still one of my all-time favorites. It's hard to go wrong with Vinnie at the helm and with a hop bill that consists of some of the best hops in the world: Simcoe, Centennial, Columbus, Chinook and Warrior. Just typing the list gives me goose bumps and makes my mouth water.  For some reason (reputation perhaps) I didn't expect to like the Elder as much as I liked the Younger. Not that it's even possible, since I consider the latter to be one of the top handful of DIPAs in all the world; and therefore one of the top handful of beers in all the world. I have to say, though, that it's close. This is an outstanding effort that hits all the right notes in that 'ideal DIPA symphony' that I listen for each time I crack open a bottle and take a drink.  If anything, the malt:hop balance favors hops more in this beer than it does in the Younger. Since the brewery calls that beer a Triple IPA (I believe it!) that utilizes three times as many hops as their standard IPA, it has to be a relative lack of malt. I'm not one to complain about a beer's hoppiness, but keep in mind that the Elder is more raw and more smack-you-silly bitter than the glorious, nectar-like, hop explosive smoothness of the Younger.  In the right hands, a hop bill as incredible as the one listed above can't help but result in a mind blowingly delicious beer. And that is exactly what has made the journey from Santa Rosa to my mouth. Brilliant, palate-shattering, hopsticky white grapefruit, pineapple and lemon zest fill my mouth and ravage my tongue... and I couldn't be happier. Who cares if the Elder doesn't have the well-mannered elegance of the Younger? True hopheads will rejoice in its 'no holds barred' alpha acidity, much as I'm doing now.  I've been so blown away by the flavor that I haven't yet given a thought to the mouthfeel. No matter, I still have a third of a bottle left. I'd better be quick about it because the 8.0% ABV is beginning to catch up with me in a big hurry. The mouthfeel, while less full, syrupy and sticky than the Younger, is still outstanding. Again, I have to thank RedwoodGeorge for an amazing re-bottling effort that is nothing less than perfect.  Pliny the Elder is an equally hoppy, slightly more bitter, lower in alcohol, lighter bodied (but still full-bodied) version of Pliny the Younger. Both are exceptional beers and both deserve every accolade that is bestowed upon them. More hop alchemy from the ridiculously talented Mr. Cilurzo. Long may he brew!",Russian River Brewing Company,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,100
863,7971,kmcnair,5,"Hello, my name is Kelsey and I am a hophead.  I remember the first time I tried Pliny, so innocent and nieve I was... a night at O'Brien's Pub in San Diego with friends... ""Oh, Pliny the Elder, thats a weird name for a beer... I'll try that one."" And the rest my friends, is history.  There's a reason why Pliny the Elder is winning gold medals in major beer competitions worldwide. GABF, WBC, (more to come I'm sure...) This beer defines a style, Double IPA beyond compare. Find another IPA that takes hops to this level, infact... I double dog dare you.  This beer pours perfect medium copper and makes a full white head that fades slow, retains well and leaves a great deal of bubbly lacing on my glass.  The aroma is simply hypnotic. I could inhale this beer for hours, pine, citrus, herbal, dank, crisp fresh biscuity caramel malts. Lovely. Stick your nose in the glass and inhale, it is absolutely perfect.  The carpet matches the curtains, the flavor is equally as impressive and complex as the aroma. Stable, clean bitterness, blends with a fortified layer of caramel and nutty malted barley that perfectly balances intense dank, citrus, piney hop flavors. Its spot on, exactly what I would expect the stanard for the style to taste like.  Smooth, clean and crisp carbonation, light to medium bodied, finishes clean and dry. Leaves a lasting impression on the palate. It takes a real accomplishment to be so complex, aromatic and flavorful, yet continues to bring it home through the mouthfeel category as well.

A: Vivid orange color that can only be replicated by the 256 Crayola box topped with a film of creamy white head. The head clings to the glass in waves of rocky goodness.  S: Smells like the California sun. Fresh, vivid, citrusy, clean, happy. Lots of hops with hints of malt. Smells like a bowl of citrus fruit fresh from the farmers' market.  T: Well balanced beer. Crisp, fruity hops with subtle malt undertones. Big focus on sweet grapefruit. Sometimes it hints at being too sweet, but never quites get to that point.  M: Sticks to the glass, the lips, the palate and the ribs as it goes down. Syrupy but perfect mouthfeel.  D: Could only drink one. Would drink it again and again, but only one in a row. Too sweet and powerful to spend an afternoon drinking.  Notes: When my friend to me to the Father's Office for dinner, I never imagined I would see Pliny on tap.

863,7971,RoyalT,4.47,"Appearance - This came out a hazy, beautiful orange in color with a big, hefty white head.  Smell - This fella has a monster hop profile. The Pliny is piney, that's for sure. There actually seems to be a couple variations of pine smell in here along with some strong floral notes that carry that raw ""off the vine"" hop fragrance. The citrus hops are rich and sweetish.  Besides all that, this puppy has a huge malt profile. They aren't really toasted at all but have more of a caramel character. All and all this thing is packing quite a wallop!  Taste - This is a big, bountiful DIPA, full of all the delicious flavors from the aroma. All of the hops work in harmony to provide an amazing hop experience with every sip. The malts don't let up for a minute, either. The thick, caramel malts remind me of the 90 Minute. Everything is big yet very well balanced, in a massive hop-head kind of way.  Mouthfeel - This is big but I'd still call it medium-bodied. It is slickly smooth in the cheeks and dangerously easy to drink.  Drinkability - This goes down like none other. The Younger is bigger but doesn't go down as easy as this. At 8.0 ABV I'm sure this has snuck up on many a Russian River patron over the years.  Update - I first reviewed this in 2006 and had a chance to sample it from the bottle again in 2010. It is raw this year and has a monstrous pine aroma. The flavor will cause the uninitiated to dial 911. As massive as the hops are in this beer, to me, still as I said four years ago, it is the malt backbone that separates this man from the boys. I've seen a few examples like this of hop overkill, but this is the only really big monster hop beer that tries to be a true, complete, well-rounded beer if you know what I mean.

I won't waste your time with taste desciptions, just know that the scent is wonderful, taste is wonderful, everything is wonderful about this brew. Drink this early and often!

It pours a nice slightly hazy orange with an aroma that knocks your socks off. A very light colored head dances on top of this beauty taunting you to take a sip.

It pours out to a beautiful golden color with a normal amount of head and intricate lacing, and the smell is that of pure, unadulterated hops (among other herbal aromas I've heard mentioned). The taste, however, is what has always blown me away: intense hop flavor that rivals few and makes Russian River's super-hot pepperonis seem bland and tasteless.

In a word wonderful like the Younger not quite as strong but still like snorting fresh hop leaves. Don't forget then nice caramel malt base this wonderful hop bouquet is riding on.

Nice every sip is a pleasure demanding another. Taste is classic I2PA great smell loads of hop flavors all mixed not really favoring one variety. Not quite as big and amazing as the Younger or Dreadnaught but pretty damn close.  Mouthfeel is mediumish not too big just enough to carry all the hop resins.

Generous golden malt roast washed away by floods of sticky orange, grapefruit, grated lemon zest, sweet wildflowers, and freshly shaved pine bark. I would wear this as cologne.  Flavor mimics the nose, only it's better! A perfectly clean golden malt entry with hints of honey and sweet biscuits is carried away by waves of grapefruit and tangerine, pinapple, freshly crushed wildflowers steeped in honey, and resinous, oily cannabis pine sap that is both sticky and coating.

Great clarity! As the glass reaches my nose an instant smile graces my face. Explosive, enchanting hop nose with notes of citrus, tropical fruit, pine resin and grapefruit. A ribbon of sweet caramelly malt stands guard behind the wall of hops. As I sniff I imagine picking a fresh, bright green hop cone and rubbing it between my fingers as I inhale deeply. Quite simply an amazing hoppy nectar rivaling any I have had before.  First sip brings just enough sweet, crystalline caramelly malt body before the impending wave of luscious hops rolls in. A blend of citrusy, piney hops that seems to get better with each sip. Peach tones, pineapple and tropical fruit enhance the amazing oily hop flavor here. Sweetness gives way to a nice wave of bitterness on the way down. The Elder finishes with a lingering fruity hop flavor that leaves me waiting for the next sip. All hype aside, this is an amazingly well built and balanced Double IPA that deserves the praise.  Mouthfeel is medium bodied and creamy. The small bubbly mellow carbonation makes it so smooth and incredibly drinkable. I've nearly finished the 22oz already and I could see this being the perfect session DIPA. The Elder has plenty of hoppy wisdom to share with those lucky enough to be in its presence. Cheers to Vinnie and everyone at Russian River for producing all of their incredible brews.

It pours a light golden color with a finger of white head that falls to a healthy coat over top that form a solid barrier to the liquid. Clarity is very good, but not pristine. Good looker. Nose is great. Candied grapefruit and oranges in a very sweet caramel glaze. Balance is fantastic. The hops are juicy and fruity and the malts are sweet, but not cloying. Nice. Flavor is nice as well. Very sweet in both hop and malt. Its right on with the aroma having candied orange and grapefruit and even sweet apircot flavors. After swallowing, there is a light peppery spice from the hop that moves right into a moderate bitterness that hangs on, letting me know its there, but its very smooth and not biting. Feel is thick with a light to moderate carbonation. The carbonation breaks up the fullness, making it more than highly drinkable. This beer is everthing I hoped it would be. No hint of the alcohol at all, very clean bitter on the finish, very juicy flavors, very nice mouthfeel. This beer is a keeper.

Lots of hop flavors, but also there is plenty of malt sweetness and caramel flavor. I'm the opposite of a hop head, but this beer tastes great to me. The flavor hops aren't over the top like most I2PA's. It just blends and adds the bitterness at the end. Very nice beer. The body is moderate and the drinkability is great for 8%.",Russian River Brewing Company,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,100
863,7971,Zorro,4.89,"Sampled thanks to RedwoodGeorge and his most Excellent trade!  Pours a mildly hazed orange gold beer with not much head formation.  Smell is loads of pleasant fresh hops. Lots of pine and grapefruit scents. Additional scents of lemon, eucalyptus, mint, black pepper, and cardamom. A super pleasant smell in the same class as Three Floyds Dreadnaught.  Taste is wow perfect! Light malt sweetness with abundant hop flavors. Flavors of lemon, wood, pine, pineapple, black pepper, cilantro, oranges and probably 20 more things that I can't name. Basically this is the IPA that they serve in heaven!  Mouthfeel is very good.  This is heavenly to drink! There is only one other beer in the same class as this; the much loved Three Floyds Dreadnaught. If you have the opportunity to try this by all means quit your job if you have too and DO IT!  The only possible problem with this beer is that every beer you drink for a week after will just not come close to it.",Russian River Brewing Company,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,100
863,7971,rajendra82,4.65,"Sampled from the unofficially bottled from a 5 gallon keg into 22 oz. bombers by BA RedwoodGeorge, the beer came out well carbonated, and free of oxidation, thanks to the counterpressure filler used during bottling. The body was clear pale in color, and the head was frothy and stable. The aroma was a milder version of the grapefruit and pine hops than the nephew beer. The hop flavor leaped off the taste buds with a citric and salty vigor. The malt was primarily a supporting player here, with a clean unobtrusive semi-sweet character. This was more of a spicy rather than bitter hop profile, which suited me just fine. The mouthfeel was medium and slick, with hops fading off rather than sticking around as a teeth coating film. This beer was very easy to drink, with no hint whatsoever of the 8% ABV. Different than Pliny the Younger in several ways (not quite as sweet, nor as aromatic), but I can still see the family resemblance.",Russian River Brewing Company,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,100
863,7971,rallison,4.62,"Had this on-tap at Pizza Port San Clemente. Appearance was the usual golden IPA color, with a touch of brown. 1/2"" head or so. Smell was of some refreshing, citrusy hops. Not much else, but this is an IPA - great smell for the style. Taste was amazing. One of the most perfectly balanced Double IPAs in my opinion. Nice touch of hops in the beginning, followed immediately by a lighter-bodied maltiness. This malt is not heavy at all (perfect for an IPA), but gives a nice balance and contrast to the hops that are to come. The malt here seems to be used more as a way to anchor the hops. The hops then take over at the end, and are very refreshing and citrusy. They linger a nice long while, perfect with the pizza being consumed at the same time. All in all, a perfect balance of hops and malt - something not found in many double IPAs. Mouthfeel is exceptional on this, exactly how I think IPAs should be - lighter-bodied (medium-bodied for an IPA) but full of flavor. Drinkability is perfect on this. So much flavor, and so tasty, but not too filling. I could drink way too many of these. Maybe it's good they don't bottle this one...",Russian River Brewing Company,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,100
863,7971,rdrummer,4.53,"It is about time that I review Pliny the Elder, having had it on tap a number of times in the last six months. It is one of my favorite beers. It pours a beautiful hazy golden color with a nice head with plenty of head retention. The overwhelming aroma is of hops as is the taste. There is also a balancing sweet smoothness that really comes out at the end. This is a full-bodied brew with a satisfyingly thick mouthfeel. It is a beer that I seek out, and I'm always left wanting more.",Russian River Brewing Company,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,100
863,7971,BillyB,3.87,"Had on tap at Flannigans Boathouse in Conshahocken(sp?) PA.  Orange/copper color with a thick white head.  Aromas are of floral, citrus, hops, hops, hops. Flowery, fruity hop esters are stronger than almost any beer I've tried. Taste is an attempted balance between sweet, fruitiness and mega-hoppy bitterness. The mouthfeel is oily and bitter. The hops are just plain overwhelming. That's not neccesarily a bad thing. It's just that this is all hops and a little bit of citrusy fruit flavor. A classic example of the American over-hopped style IPA or double IPA. Still an enjoyable brew but indulgent to say the least.",Russian River Brewing Company,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,100
863,7971,orsulacp,4.49,"I had this on tap at Firewaters in Glen Mills, it had a small white head and a deep amber with orange hues. The smell was amazing; it had all of the hop flavors, piney, grapefruit, and some floral scents. I can almost feel the oils coating my nose. The taste is mostly piney, bitter piney at the beginning and through the middle, with grapefruit flavor at the end leaving a piney resin coating my mouth. The malt is just there holding it all together. The mouthfeel is creamy and quite drinkable. It is amazing to me how hoppy this is; yet it seems so balanced, worth all the hype.",Russian River Brewing Company,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,100
863,7971,sloejams,4.73,"Ive had the good fortune of having this several times - most recently, on-tap at the Toronado, San Francisco.  It pours a beautiful, golden pale with a nice lush head. The aroma is intense. Hops as all hell. The taste is remarkable: first and foremost, again the hops. This pure is complex though, there is fine maltness that sinks through. The creaminess and the alcohol warmth are extremely pleasant and smooth.  A non-beer enthusiast friend once told me that the IPA I suggested, tasted like he was drinking a tree. If that was a tree, this is a fucking forest.  A forest I could drink all day long.",Russian River Brewing Company,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,100
863,7971,spazaru,3.05,"I had this on tap at O Brien's in San Diego.  Let me just say that this must be one of the most overhyped beers on BA. Moderately hoppy, slightly floral smelling, and an average mouthfeel. Nothing really stood out.  It smelled, tasted, and felt like a regular IPA. Not bad certainly, but nothing special. Alesmith, Stone, Bear Republic, Oggi's and even Green Flash make much better West Coast IPAs.  Kind of made me feel good because I thought after the reviews that maybe I didn't live in the IPA capital of California.  SoCal can relax.

863,7971,bigman147,5,I was able to try this recently when a friend from work was able to acquire a 1/2 barrel for his homebrewing Christmas party. He was able to bottle a sample for me to try. I was weary as I couldn't imagine it could live up to the hype. I was wrong. It poured light amber/gold with a pleasant white head. Aroma of pine and citrus. The body of the beer was hard to find since it was hiding behind the hops. All I could think of as I drank it was how much I like hops. Crisp clean finish. Drinkability was limited by the volume I had. If could see drinking more than one of these in a sitting but not much more than 3.,Russian River Brewing Company,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,100
863,7971,misterscooter,4.08,"A beautiful, golden gold. This is a color that looks great in your glass. Not a yellow gold but one going a bit toward amber. The head was smaller than I would have liked but I'll attribute that more to the pourer at the Hopyard in San Ramon (a great place to get a beer, especially when you find Pliny the Elder on tap). But the white foam was thick and glittery with small bubbles. No lacing.  The smell of Pliny is, well, piney. Very woody sap smell with some underlying pepper. Strong and can catch you off guard but not in a bad way that scares you off. Rather, it makes you think that this might be a complex beer that lives up to the ratings.  The taste is also very piney. Spices and hops come at you from different angles and this is almost too much. It does come across as a not so wimpy beer, for sure. The good thing about these tastes is that they are from high quality ingredients and it felt good on your tongue as you held it. Not too carbonated. I didn't feel the effects of the alcohol but I did catch it a bit at times.  It is a slow drinking beer. It complimented the spicy garlic fries I was having and it lasted a while. Because of the ABV, you couldn't pound these for that reason alone but the drinkability is good because it is one I definitely want again for another impression.",Russian River Brewing Company,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,100
863,7971,IrishRedRock,4.75,"First of all, what a cool lookin' growler, no? Pours a light coppery color, with a beautiful giant-bubbled seafoam-like white head. Aroma is powerful - oily hops, fresh cut grass, and citrus sweetness. Perfumy and mildly alcoholic, but oh so fresh and pungent. Medium bodied, with a wee slap of carbonation is it passes your lips to its destination.  Hops are front and center here, showing off their oily, sticky herbal goodness from start to finish. The middle contains a chewy malt profile, bready and dry, ending with a touch of alcohol and plenty of hop bitterness. Wow. This is all I expected. One I'd drink lots and lots of. Certainly worth the time, effort, money, drive, or whatever is needed to acquire some of this delightful nectar.

Pours a rich cloudy bright orange glowing hue topped off with a 1/2"" thick spumescent craggy khaki head cap leaving drippy lace in the glass.  Aromatic nose of intense sweet orange and tangerine citrus floral bouquet.  First swigs: Tangerine juice and spree candy with a sprinkle Pez candy chalkiness. Dry crisp lingering orange peel, bubble gum finish. Aftertaste is total Spree candy sugary goodness!  Feel is a bitter astringent tart followed by a bone dry ending. Tongue coater that develops into a gin ending.  Last swigs: Fresh tangerine orange concentrate and Pez candy. Like a perfect Sunkist orange. ""Get in mah belly!"" Stunning. Great burps too! Saaz?

863,7971,Foxman,4.57,"It came to me an orangey amber with a floating haze about it. A finger a very dense white head soon dropped to a frothy film. Lacing curlicued amply around the inside of the glass.  The aroma was hops, with citrusy grapefruit and pine forest winds wrapped tightly around a slight grassy note and an overwhelmed bubble of malt.  As expected from the aroma, the flavor was initially dominated by the thick column of hops, again with the grapefruit citrus current, and the deep well of pine needles, as though pine sap was wiped along my gums. The malt is more credible here, though, yielding up a biscuity essence that, while pale in comparison, does punctuate the hops raid with pinpricks of presence. And in fact, the malt does just enough to keep the hops from going berserk, perhaps in partnership with a rather subdued note of alcohol, lending the tiniest grain sweetness nudge to push the bitterness a step more toward center. The finish is a lingering hops bouquet that stayed with me for a very long, pleasurable time. It's all about the hops, but it's never obnoxious.  Medium bodied, the oily hops thicken the broth, becoming quite tnagible, leaving a slick coating and a longlasting glow in the mouth.  I was lucky enough to be at GLP just in time for the tapping of this keg. Now, it was on the heels of the Yeti I'd just had, so I needed some water and spicy rare tuna to cleanse the palate a bit, but once I got my teeth into this one, I was one very happy camper. It's not at all shy about its in-your-face hoppiness, and the way it's crafted, there's no reason for it to be. No, there's no balance here, but there's not supposed to be, and that is the main thrust of the impressive brewmanship. It lists so heavily hopwards, but never totally leaves its malt lineage behind. The ABV is beefy, in proportion with the load of hops, so it is a sipper, but the occasional gulp is inevitable, just to have a mouthful to feel how alive it is. And it's now time to wrap this up, because I'm off to get me a growler of this nectar...",Russian River Brewing Company,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,100
863,7971,sulldaddy,4.44,Super cool wedding gift from Watermelonman! THANKS BRO!  I am sharing a chilled growler with Stopper and pouring into a pint glass. The beer pours a slightly hazy gold color with fluffy off white headof 2 inches with a slightly aggressive pour. The head fades slowly leaving large windowpane lattice and cratered spongy surface. Aroma is all hops with mostly pine but also a mix of grass and some rind. The pine is sticky resiny and thick. First sip reveals an average body with fine and tingly carbonation. Flavor is slightly fruity sweet up front and then the hops take over with sappy resin pine dominant. The flavor finishes sticky and thick with lip smacking bite. This is a must have for any hop heads out there. QUite a great beer that I am glad to have tried!,Russian River Brewing Company,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,100
863,7971,Rastacouere,3.38,"Clear light gold pour, the head is white and big. Astonishing woody flavours cover the leafy and herbal hops that feel like a perfume. The malt base is potently biscuity and grainy/bready. The aromatic hops seem underwhelmed by the bitterness ones that hide one of the biggest punch Ive yet to feel, but fool is the one who thinks the malt is not there to support it as this has plenty of toasted and cereal maltiness, medium bodied, yet with airy and foamy carbonation.",Russian River Brewing Company,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,100
863,7971,jaluria,3.98,"This beer has a soft orange-color to it with an off-white head that has incredible lasting ability. The lacing left behind on my pint glass looked like a painting, it was that intricate. The smell is mostly of citrus, hops, and dried fruit. The taste is typical for the style...a complex merging of malt, hop induced bitterness, followed by a dry, almost astringent taste. Overall, I think this is an excellent ale with distinct character and texture. I had to deduct points for the aftertaste because the bready texture didn't sit well in the back of my throat. The aftertaste does not really dissipates, it simply changes over time.",Russian River Brewing Company,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,100
863,7971,TurdFurgison,4.32,"Had this on-tap at Toronado's in San Francisco. Presented in a pint glass, orange color with large sticky white head.

Nice and crisp at first with a huge hop smack, high citrus flavor almost pine like finish, very long lasting on the palate.  Very nice Double IPA, one of my favorites. Hop level is very high.

I received a growler of this lovely beer from TheLongBeachBum, and was quite excited to have a Real West Coast Hop Bomb while on the East Coast. It almost doesn't feel right, but I think I can deal with it..  This one is still quite carbonated after a 3 day trek across the country, with a billowing fluffy sudsy white head, overflowing the glass on my second serving... oops. Otherwise, the color is dull orange, or amberish, and clear. Nice look for an IIPA.  Smells like a freakin HOP! Wow, I had this on tap in San Diego 6 months ago, but that was Six Months Ago! I didn't remember such a fresh monster hop aroma to this one. With a hint of malt, meekly hiding in the back. Again, a smack in the face. Taste is more of the same, but instead of a bitter taste, it's just HOPPY. Almost a piny taste, and grassy, VERY fresh. Malt finish with a sort of dry, slightly bitter aftertaste. I am a fan.  Mouthfeel- nice. Perfect. Still fizzy but not what I would call light. For all that flavor, not thick either. Drinkability- well, I already drank half the growler, but... it is 8%... so, a score of 4 for that. Tastes like I could drink it all day, but with the alcohol content (no alcohol taste) it could well get one in trouble. Overall it's a highly enjoyable brew, and I must thank Mr. LBB again for the growler.

863,7971,hopsaplenty,4.47,"On draft at RFD in Washington, DC. Served in a shaker-style pint glass.  Appearance: The glass is filled with a beautiful burnt gold, with a minimal bright white head that quickly disappeared. No lacing to speak of, but that is probably due to the glassware.  Smell: The first deep smells are of bright, bold hops; citrus fruit and grasses.  Taste: The first taste is a hops explosion on the tongue. Loads of citrus and a minimal malt backbone make this a hop-lovers paradise. I want to slowly enjoy it, but it tastes so fresh that it is difficult. I love hops and this is a new-found heaven. Loads of hops in the finish. There is no alcohol present.  Mouthfeel: Almost an oily and resinous after each drink. The hops stick to your mouth and don't let go.  Drinkability: My glass was quickly empty, and I wanted more but restrained myself given that I needed to return to the office. Had I been out for the day, a second draft would have been summoned, but at 8%, it is dangerously drinkable.

The serving was in a standard pint glass, which sort of surprised me; I was expecting a 10 oz. pour. The nose of the beer was incredibly floral, which gave a good indication of the hefty hop presence. [Being a hop-head I was very happy with the level of hops included in this beer] The mouthfeel was somewhat standard compared to other double IPAs I've tried, but the taste lasted just long enough to entice another sip. I would definitely say that I thoroughly enjoyed this beer, and would recommend it highly to anyone who can find it.

Smell: Resinous hop nose, oil and dripping with hop scent. The hop aroma is both floral and pine in character.  Taste: This beer is an explosion of hop bitterenss coupled with a fruity and floral quality. Some pepper and spice too. I am not a hop head but this one is definately good. There's a light malty flavor amid all of the hop madness that leaves a bready taste in my mouth. The hop flavor continues all the way through the long ending with a stick, resinous hop quality. There is a touch of sweetness in the ending.  Mouthfeel: Smooth, comfy, pleasant and sticky in the mouth. The beer is even a bit drying on the palate. This beer is surprisingly comfortable on the palate given that is is strongly hopped and that usually does not appeal to me. I wouldn't call the hop flavor subdued or balanced, but it is nice to my palate and doesn't get violent. I can appreciate that having been assaulted by so many overly hopped beers.  Drinkability: Solid IPA one a nice, hot San Diego afternoon. I won't be running back for another one of these unless I need a hop fix, but it's definately a good beer for the hop heads out there.",Russian River Brewing Company,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,100
863,7971,RedwoodGeorge,4.72,"I can't believe I still haven't reviewed this masterpiece - it must be that I'm always so distracted by the experience that I forget to record it...  The pour is a deep golden with touches of orange, more than a bit cloudy and with a thick white head. The head stays around for quite some time and leaves lots and lots of lacing on the glass.  The smell is pure hops - I'm sure there's grain in there somewhere but your nose is so distracted by the fresh grassy smell, the grapefruit rind and the pervasive impression of sticky resinous green growth that there's not much room for anything else.  The taste can't really be improved upon. Yes, the hops are very strong but there is no real bitterness in this brew. There's a distinct sweet bready note holding in the background and plenty of the same hop notes found in the aroma but what makes this so special is how smooth and well balanced the taste is. Absolutely no hints of harshness to be found and for a beer with bucketfuls of IBU's that's an impressive feat.  Mouthfeel is very good; this is a light to medium bodied brew with lots and lots of fine carbonation. There's no oily residue on the palate and the expected hop bitterness only creates the need to take another sip. No alcohol burn at all, just smoooth all the way down.  This is a highly drinkable brew that will please any hop lover. What makes this beer stand apart from the crowd is just how well balanced the tastes are and just how smooth the beer goes down.

Pours a golden yellow with an orange tinge.  Has a nice little head that sticks around for a while.  Floral Hoppy aroma with a hint of citrus.  The taste is all about hops a slightly bitter and dry fisnish. Pretty drinkable but not a session brew.  I had with with one of the brewery's specialty pizzas with peperoni, sausage and caramelized unions. Paired pretty well, the hoppiness cut through the strong taste of the pizza well.

But most recently it was IMO 'best-of-show' at the 10th Annual Mammoth Bluespalooza at Mammoth Mountain CA. Up against 49 other outstanding, worthy competitors, Pliny once again showed how it has raised the bar for all other DIPA's to try and reach. Rich gold in color, clear yet translucent, almost looks like it would pour like honey. The rich smell of pine sap and grapefruit permeates from the glass immediately. Its almost like a wicked citrus fruit juice, except its 8.0%ABV is inescapable. It was the only tap that the other pourers were routinely sneaking off too to sneak a taste.

On to the beer: Burnished gold in color, I thought the aroma was very nice, it came across as nicely blended and balanced. Tastewise, I appreciated the fact that the alcohol kept itself hidden. I also enjoyed the grassy hop taste of this one. Very smooth and easy to drink, I kept the drinkability at 4 due to the alcohol.",Russian River Brewing Company,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,100
863,7971,Crotor,4.94,"Sweet Jesus this is good beer.  The imperial pint is a slightly hazed light caramel-amber with a moderate white head with lowish retention.  Smells like an alpine hike. Smells like playing in the forest as a child. Smells like the deep woods. Smells like grizzled mountain man... Piercing pine. Sap - thick, gooey, coating pine sap. Bristling pine cones. Starthistle sting. So thick yet so sharp - dichotymous...  I've used pine sap to describe other beers before, but no beer can epitomize pine sap more than this. Tastes like thick, woody sap. A bit earthy, the piercing pine again, and then again with the more floral, *sharp* starthistle element. Sickly sharp. Pine *needles.* But behind that, the syrupy malt is soothing. So melded and incorporated... It tastes like I ate a ponderosa.  Just enough body to support the massive hopping, but also dry enough for the balance to shift to make for a decidedly West Coast DIPA. Definitive. Epitomizes the West Coast. This beer is holy.",Russian River Brewing Company,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,100
863,7971,ADR,4.74,"On tap at the American Beer Festival, Boston, MA, 2005...  Light amber appearance, decent head of small bubbles. Laces in thick strings. Aroma is majorly piquant in lots of ways. HUGE hops, lupulin oozes out and sneaks into every corner of your mouth -- first citrusy and then ranging to pine and then back to a slightly sweeter pink grapefruit -- but always in your face. This is a partly comparative review, a face-off between this and Avery Maharaja IPA (as I was pouring it at the fest, I sucked down the last six ounces of Maharaja from a nearing empty bomber, well, about ten or eleven times), but frankly for me, its not a contest -- the Raj may win in body and sticky malt but the intense hops of Pliny just gush out in a way rarely seen in beerdom. One of the true best in class. Sometimes you get fairly detailed in a review, but just saying Pliny the Elder is INSANE says a lot. Hot damn, what's Pliny the YOUNGER like?",Russian River Brewing Company,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,100
863,7971,99bottles,4.62,"I was pleasantly surprised to find this on tap in PA. My pint had a smooth orangeyellow color with a neat white head of tiny foam displaying excellent retention. The smell is of the hops, by the hops, and for the hops. It's an amazingly pungent green smell, absolutely piney, with strong bursts of grapefruit and lemon jucie made into a smoothie with spruce boughs. Wow. Hophead's dream. The taste is wonderful as well. The sharp hoppiness recedes on first sip and a light to medium malt base gives a slight sweetness before a rush of bitterness pours out in the finish. Sharp, nearly painful hop-bite in the aftertaste, but the blend is so floral, so raw and green and so sassy that it begs for more. I really enjoyed this beer. Drinkability might finally die when saplings start to grow from your palette, but I can't knock it too much on that fact. The most refined DIPA I've had, but if you strip something down this much and leave only the best, where else can you go from there? I'm sold on Rusian River and can't wait to try more from them.",Russian River Brewing Company,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,100
863,7971,NeroFiddled,4.57,"Piny delivers a clear, golden-orange body beneath a massive head of white froth that holds quite well and leaves some very nice lace at the outset of the pint. The nose is bold and bright with juicy, resinous hops (piney, citrusy, grassy) that you can almost smell at arms length! In the mouth it's medium-full bodied with an standard carbonation. In the flavor (which is pretty much exactly what the aroma suggested it would be), the sweetish, straight-forward malt acts as a bed for the hop flavors to lay in; but they just can't seem to stay still, and bounce up and down on it instead! The alcohol is very well cloaked throughout; and it finishes drying as the sweet malt ebbs away, leaving behind a dull bitterness and some lingering piney and citrusy notes. One of the best double IPA's I've had!",Russian River Brewing Company,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,100
863,7971,goschool,4.8,"Tasted at Father's Office in Santa Monica.  Pliny the Elder pours amber to orange with a white head. This beer presents a bouquet filled with all sorts of subtle, elegant and savory fragrances... just kidding. It's all hops! The mouthfeel is thick and oily. New rule: All Double IPA's must be at least as hoppy and bitter as this stuff. Somewhere underneath the intense spicy citrus and pine flavors are sweet malts. Very drinkable for such a big beer. Hats off to Russian River. Now how about a Double Pliny the Elder?",Russian River Brewing Company,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,100
863,7971,weeare138,4.67,Appears a light orange yellow with a small white head and scattered lacing. Smell is of tons of ballsy hops followed with tons of malt. Pine and citrus notes are abundant. Taste is of resinous hops with a sweet malt coming through. The mouthfeel is of spicy hops that come through in the full bodied flavor. Drinkability is great. This is one of the few great beers out there.  Finger licking good...and then some!,Russian River Brewing Company,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,100
863,7971,pjwilson,4.97,"quite simply this is the best ipa i've ever had. This beer lives up the hype and more. Had this on tap last night on my first visit to the toronado (great place)  smell: wow you can really smell the fresh hop flower on this one. taste: this is one balance beer that every sip makes you say: ""kazzam that's good."" that malts back up the hops on this one. Yeah there's bitterness but that is not the defining feature of this beverage. It's more about the hop flower taste. really good Mouthfeel: perfect for stlye  drinkablility.: went down like great. could drink this all nite. but can't since it's not around in sacramento. I'm gonna send an email to russian river about that. alright.",Russian River Brewing Company,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,100
863,7971,Troyone,4.97,"Pours a clear apple juice color with a three inch head and lacing also some carb action.  Extremely sensation smell one should consider using this hop aroma instead of potpourri. An aroma of toasted caramel malt with a heavy dose of perfume, pine, lemon, and lime hops.  A moderately sweet and bitter taste that resembles the smell with a roasted close to burnt caramel malt and more lime in the hops.  Has a medium to full body; dry some what syrupy texture; lively almost soft carbonation; and a smooth metallic, chalky, and some what alcoholic finish.  Excellent for one who can handle the hops.",Russian River Brewing Company,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,100
863,7971,sublimesipping,4.35,"I return from an extended absence older, mayber wiser, but definitely enriched by my crossing of this beer path. A sophisticated IPA- very strong, floral, with a bitter edge but not enough to put you over. Color a gold sunset amber- wonderful head with an aroma of wild windswept flowered prairies. I wax a bit here but this beer will wake your a-- up! I had no expectations and the pints opened my eyes to a beer that can hold a candle to my San Diego stonewarts- not as balanced as my masalade mama- but still very enjoyable,especially paired with the panfried trout supper. Aroma faintly of spring hynacith- but has the staying power of strong praire grass. Flavor grabs you in a hops vice, more a hops shroud. Enough of a balance to warm and season the palate through and beyond the initial sips. A great beer that deserves its elder designation. Try to capture some if you can and savor-Ok",Russian River Brewing Company,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,100
863,7971,francisweizen,4.5,"Dark golden with a nice 1/4"" head of pure white foam. Aromas are intense. Floral, citrus, spice, and more. HOPS! and some biscuity malts and some weed-like aromas as well. The taste is hoppy and bitter with a very deep flavor complexity within the confines of the citrus, flower, and other hop induced flavors. Mouthfeel is medium bodied, drinkability is up there. A killer DIPA. I like this brewery very much.",Russian River Brewing Company,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,100
863,7971,ManekiNeko,4.55,"Served on tap in a pint glass at RFD's  Appearance: Clear light amber topped by a thick white cap of foam. An everpresent smallish layer of foam was supported by the streamers of bubbles. Modestly thick, but overly splotchy, coating of foam on the glass.  Smell: Heady blast of piny resins and grapefruit. Occasional whiffs of skunkweed and rancid cheese, but in a good way. Very very green and vegetal. Hop Ottin' turned to 11, then given some steroids.  Taste: Intensely bitter spruce and acidic citrus hop juice is what this is. Just enough malty sweetness to prevent hop tea syndrome. Exquisitely off its rocker. Alcohol is well masked.  Drinkability: When I win the lottery, I will buy a modest shack across the street from either Russian River or some place that serves it, just so I can have the occasional sip of this hop nectar.  Mouthfeel: A slightly watery medium body, but in a good way. Hop juice and high abv must be less dense that malty goodness.",Russian River Brewing Company,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,100
863,7971,Dmann,4.7,"Not quite as over the top as I was expecting, but this one did not dissapoint. The beer was a golden color with a great head that was very thick and fluffy. The smell was very floral and full of citrus. The taste was extremly balanced and went down very smoothe. Flavors of sweet malt and spicey hops mixed perfectly to create a true joy to drink. One of the best DIPA's I've had.",Russian River Brewing Company,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,100
863,7971,noob,4.47,"Oh damn, this was good. Had on draft at the Toronado in SF during Big Beer Month. A creamy head topped this golden beer. Aroma is sweet, and almost fruity. This is a hop monster, but totally drinkable and well balanced. I need more Russian River beer!",Russian River Brewing Company,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,100
863,7971,IceAce,4.37,"Straight from the keg, this baby arrives with a medium copper body topped off with a single finger of dirty white, dense, and rocky foam. Clarity is excellent for a Double IPA with superb lacing on a beer-clean liter mug.  The nose encapsulates a long walk through a pine forest following a warm autumn rain...all pine, all the time! The initial taste mirrors the nose as the opening hop bite literally puckers the insides of the cheeks. Once past the opening shock, the mid-taste reveals a heavenly sweet malt mix. The finish is drop-off dry and clean with the hops slowly fading out of the picture.  The mouthfeel is satisfying and the drinkability factor will only get you into trouble without a designated driver close at hand.  The pure hoppiness of this brew is in direct contrast to many of the out-of-control, over-hopped Left Coast DIPA's in that it is far from overbearing...another victory for Vinnie!",Russian River Brewing Company,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,100
863,7971,feloniousmonk,4.52,"This will be a bare bones review, based on brief jottings made in the noisy environs of O'Brien's pub, in the company of others, but tingling with the excitement of tasting this much anticipated ale, trying my best to capture the experience. When they bottle this nectar, I'll attempt again to encapsulate it's wonder. Orange is the color, head is white, full, fresh. Nose is lovely, floral, fruity, just absolutely aburst with pineapple, peach, grapefruit, tons of citrus...absolutely excellent! Mouthfeel is slick and run over with hop oils. Taste is exhilirating, a blast of hops on the tongue, medium bodied, with a long, sticky, citric finish, and an utterly tangy texture. This seemed to fulfill whatever desires I'd need in a Double IPA, though the 8% abv didn't really make a dent in me...(or did it?)...this was one of the must-try's of my recent California visit, and I had several more samples on the next two days at the Strong Ale Fest just to be sure of it's worthiness. Yes. Yes, indeed. Very much so, and then some. I'm in twitchin' anticipation for the day their bottling line runs, then this cult IPA can get even better recognition in the world at large!",Russian River Brewing Company,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,100
863,7971,jonnylieberman,4.73,"Tasted at the Strong Beer Festival at Pizza Port in Oceanside/Carlsbad. One of the most memorable beers from a litst of many.  Pliny is golden and gorgeous. Deep straw yellow. Not watery looking, but a nice solid gold. Really quite beautiful.  Are those hops I smell? Yes, a ""metric ass-load"" of American hops. All the usual suspects are present with the balance tipping slightly in favor of pine over citrus. Very, very nice.  The taste is that rare and perfect combination of luscious malt and spicey, tangy hops. Phenomenal balance. Russian River hits it out of the park with Pliny. A superb American DIPA. Maybe THE American DIPA?  Your mouth will feel great.  Yes. I could drink this beer all day, all night. For real. I have lost the ability to sound unbiased. I love this beer!  Get some.",Russian River Brewing Company,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,100
863,7971,donnebaby,4.28,"Light gold body, rich looks cash in. Heavy, synthetic, snowwhite head sets in. Thick lacing. Nose reeks of tropical fruits -- mango -- grows a hop edge and some alcohol steps in eventually.  Taste in the mouth is spicy, of full-body hop. Tropical fruits and hops dominate the palate. Great dry and full effect grain after. Comes right in and takes over the taste and feel of the brew in the mouth. Excellent transition, very smooth -- although some after dry hop jiggles or convulsions are felt. Not sweet -- money.  Great to find this on-cask at Naja's in Redondo Beach.",Russian River Brewing Company,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,100
863,7971,GClarkage,4.65,"11/12/04- Sampled at the Toronado in San Francisco, CA  Appearance- Pours a semi-dark amber with a nice 3/4 inch white cream head and excellent lacing.  Smell- A good amount of hops and malt mixed in. Huge floral and fruity scents.  Taste- Wonderful explosion of hops and a decent malt background. Mostly grapefruit and floral/fruity flavors. I've had this numerous times and I guess it depends on the batch you get. As of recent this beer has been about as perfect as it can get. Sometimes though, it can be deceiving. My second ever Elder tasted like a normal IPA. Didn't have near the kick as it was supposed to.  Mouthfeel- Went down nicely. Nice carbonation. Caresses the mouth nicely.  Drinkability- Very easily could drink several of these. Didn't notice the abv. Went down like a good IPA. Wonderful if not tied with my favorite DIPA.",Russian River Brewing Company,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,100
863,7971,TheLongBeachBum,4.24,"Presentation: Sampled on draft at Najas in Redondo Beach during a recent trip here on a hot and sunny Saturday afternoon.  Appearance: Slightly hazed amber body with some light copper hints. Off-white head that is finger thick but lasts a while. Average conditioning.  Nose: Floral hops, massive sweet malts, fresh citric aroma with some pine oils.  Taste: Malty start, but whilst the sweet malts fill the middle and lay the foundation it is the sharp citric grapefruit as well as the thick heavy bitterness that lingers. Average carbonation gives a big presence.  Mouthfeel: Thick, oily and bold  massive sweet malt middle, dry acidic bitter rasping ending. Lays heavy on the tongue and coats the cheeks well.  Drinkability: Not exactly a session brew, a half-Pint of this could keep me satisfied for a while and accompany me as a sipper with little problem.  Overall: Second time I have tried this, and it tasted a little lighter then the inaugural visit. Still, this is a fantastic D-IPA that is classic West Coast.  Well Worth seeking out.",Russian River Brewing Company,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,100
863,7971,rastaman,3.7,"Tap, Toronado, San Fransisco. Full on Americn hops in both aroma and flavour. Massive grapefruit pine, and heavy bittrness.

Lots of flavour.",Russian River Brewing Company,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,100
863,7971,ChappyCubsFan,4.85,"This is my first review in months, but I need to rave about this near perfect double IPA. I tried it for the first time at O'Brien's Pub last winter, but I was able to visit the Russian River Brewery in Santa Rosa this summer. Pliny is silk smooth with a great hop finish (25% simcoe hops). It reminded me a bit of Alpine's Exponential Hoppiness, which is one of my favorites. In leaving the brewery, I purchased a growler and kept it refrigerated for three days before catching a plane back to Southern California. It held up nicely on the plane trip and was a big hit back home (Gone in minutes!).",Russian River Brewing Company,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,100
863,7971,UncleJimbo,4.3,"Sampled on tap at Pizza Port Carlsbad.  This double IPA poured a clear, amber color with white foam that settled but clung and coated the inside of the glass a bit. The smell was fruity, spicy hops with not much malt. The taste was grassy, fruity hops with a good bit of malt to balance. The hoppy flavors lingered very nicely. The mouthfeel was smooth, dry, and very hoppy with medium body and moderate carbonation. The finish was slightly astringent. This was a very nice and very hoppy double IPA.",Russian River Brewing Company,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,100
863,7971,oggg,4.02,"Sampled at O'Briens in a pint glass.  This double IPA was hyped up to me long before I walked into O'Briens. It has that great hop aroma that I love in double IPAs, but it's a bit harsh and over the top with the bitterness. Packed in with the hop flavor is some serious bitterness that just pounded my tongue into submission. More than the Exponential Hoppiness. After my tongue began to come back, I noticed a strong maltiness come out and shine. Alcohol is subtle. Full body.  Overall: Hoppiness is a bit too bitter for me, but the maltiness at the end is a great save. A hop heads dream.",Russian River Brewing Company,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,100
863,7971,Gusler,4.34,"Draught @ OBriens San Diego The beer pours somewhat deep amber; the head is white and full in size, the texture semi-creamy with the lace a velum like sheet to conceal the glass. Nose is hop floral, sweet malt underneath, lime like crispness, fresh and a treat for the nose as well as the eyes. Zap the hops slam your taste buds to attention, magnificent is a word I think fits perfectly, stern acidity with a hop spicy dry aftertaste that leaves you puckering and eager for another taste. A beer certainly made for us lovers of hops and another great example of the big California Imperial IPAs.",Russian River Brewing Company,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,100
863,7971,Boilermaker88,4.45,"When I saw this on-tap at the Carlsbad, CA Pizza Port I had to do a quick double-take and get a pint, fast. In light of my relatively recent love of IPA's and Double IPA's, I felt I shouldn't squander the opportunity. Arriving in a standard pint glass, this double IPA showed off a murky orange/amber color topped with a firm, resilient off-white head that left clumps of lace down the glass. The aromas of pine needles and juicy grapefruits delivered a slap to the sinuses. Once getting past the pungent hops, I could make out a grainy malt aroma that added an added incentive to taste. Taste I did. The sweet malts were noticeable briefly before getting shown the exit in favor of an avalanche of fresh hops. Lots of potent citrus flavor, slightly sticky pine sap taste and feel, and the light warming sensation of alcohol in the finish to warn of the well-concealed ABV. The feel was medium-bodied, vaguely prickly with carbonation and quite dry in the finish. Pliny The Elder is one top-notch example of what appears to be a growing style. You definitely need to have your heart (and palate) set for some hops if you order a pint of Pliny.",Russian River Brewing Company,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,100
863,7971,Mark,4.5,"I was expecting a much hoppier taste and aroma. Maybe the keg was near the bottom, I don't really know. Despite this ""surprise"" I found this a very drinkable beer. At over 9% abv it really went down easy. The beer was a light amber, head was full and left nice lace. At least my sample lacked the hop aroma, taste was very smooth and and did not feel like 100 IBU's. A very interesting beer that garnered a nice rating despite my surprise and questioning of it's being in top form. I tried this again at the pub and I will say wow! A much better sample, hops hops and more palate grabbing hops. Loved it.",Russian River Brewing Company,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,100
863,7971,watermelonman,4.52,"This sat as a bright orange and gold color without much head, and it didn't leave too much lace either. It looks pretty good.  The scent is snappy but has an additional depth to the hops coming out in the smell. There's a lot to it, while being very enjoyable. The taste is very nice; the bitterness is hefty without completely obliterating the malt.  I'll have another.",Russian River Brewing Company,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,100
