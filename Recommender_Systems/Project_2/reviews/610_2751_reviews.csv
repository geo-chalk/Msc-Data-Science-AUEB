610,2751,JZH1000,3.86,"Poured from an unfortunately undated 16oz can  On the first pour an insane four finger head formed. Pretty good retention too, as it took me 6ish minutes to pour the whole pint into a Spieglau IPA glass. After pouring I had a stiff rocky white sudsy head that left foamy lacing. Body is a hazy golden yellow.  Aroma comes off as sweet, in a big beer sense, but is immediately followed by big resiny hops with rhindy citrus notes in the back. Like if pine sap was lemon scented? Super hoppy but in a fresh herbal way. A touch of ""ale"" character in the way back.  Flavor is smooth and drinkable with a wave of bitterness. Tasting notes mostly follow the aroma, but the sweetness dissapears completely, due to the bitterness. Full flavor implies a maltiness, but the hops cover up any true malt character, as typical for the style. Lemony pine resin with a dry malt insinuating finish is the main experience.  Feel is drinkable verging on dangerous for the ABV. Very easy to drink and quite smooth, although the finish is quite dry and bitter. The dryness begins verging on astringency, and I'm unsure if that is due to hopping rates, or something else. Very full with a medium long finish.  Overall this is a decent legacy IPA. It's super drinkable, very ""beery"" and pretty enjoyable. Bright herbal citric and overall hoppy, this is what I thought an IPA tasted like when my mom explained hops to me as a kid, and I still didn't appreciate beer. Classic old school IPA, this is what a WCIPA should be IMO.",Bear Republic Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,93
610,2751,LucidoMMA,3.79,"Pours a golden color with a finger soapy head.  Smells very bready, with some piney undertones.  Taste is of grapefruit, pine, and very feint citrus. Bubblegummy after taste with little to no bite.",Bear Republic Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,93
610,2751,TooManyGlasses,4.49,"Been some time since had a Racer 5 - ?San Francisco 2017?? Pours a bright very slightly hazed golden with solid two fingers of tight bubbly just off white head. Aroma of bready malt, floral with touch of pine and big swath of orange, tangerine and tropical fruit - underwhelming at first but popped as warmed just a touch (this is on me!). Tastes an explosion of hops - citrus, a bit of pine, fruity with notes of mango, tangerine; certainly a floral presence and a bright spicy bitterness that coats the palate balanced by bready caramel malt sweetness. Medium full mouthfeel with a coating bittersweetness that lingers nicely. This is a classic for a reason and on a short list of ""desert island"" beers.",Bear Republic Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,93

610,2751,J_Brew_99,4.85,"Overall, this is the epitome of a classic west coast style IPA. Not overly hoppy, medium to heavy body, and the notes are more floral than bitter.

610,2751,brureview,4.35,"I haven’t tasted this beer in a long time. Bear Republic didn’t distribute in my area for a while. Great beer! If an award was given for balance in an IPA, it should be given to Racer 5. Light clear, golden amber color. Floral, piney aroma. Silky MF. Piney, spicy taste. Not too hoppy.  Gee- I’m getting nostalgic for the old days of the West Coast IPAs with lots of flavor balance.",Bear Republic Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,93
610,2751,WIllBonds,4.75,"A CLASSIC !!! As WC IPAs go, this one should be included on every list. Golden, resinous and a heavier mouthfeel.

Some fruitiness too.  Taste: Up front is piney. Citric and pineapple orange. Some malty hints too. A notable bitterness. The finished lingers, but not too long.  Overall: I've tried this many times before, but this is my first time taking notes. Really enjoyable.

Taste: Herbal, spicy, resinous, citrussy. Lingering aftertaste. Mouthfeel: Bitter, well carbonated, medium-to-full bodied. Overall: Not easy to overlook (or understate) the 5's pedigree.

610,2751,defunksta,3.91,"Appearance: Pours a completely clear, light golden color with a large sticky, white head. SRM of 7. (3.75)  Aroma: Moderate aromas of orange, grapefruit citrus, stonefruit and apricot. Some caramel malts on teh finish.  Flavor: Strong citrus grapefruit and orange citrus flavors upfront. Sort of fades away in the middle. Some caramel and bread malt to finish. Moderately bitter.  Feel: Medium-bodied, moderate carbonation. A clean and moderately bitter finish. (3.75)  Compared to Bells' Two Hearted Ale 5/25/22: Pours lighter, milder aromas. More orange, grapefruit citrus. Less apricot, caramel, bitter pine.  Overall: A really drinkable IPA here. Nice citrus and some slight stonefruit notes. Then a clean and moderately bitter finish. Incredibly clean for 7.5%. This one would sneak up on you. Drinks pretty to style for a West-coast IPA. I don't know that there's anything here that makes this one special. Somewhat surprised by the 93 Rating on BeerAdvocate. Surely it's historical. Maybe my expectations were too high. Nonetheless, a good IPA and dangerously drinkable. (Rating: 3.91)",Bear Republic Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,93
610,2751,JokersAce,3.52,"Golden color with a quickly dissipated head. Hoppy but not overly so by todays standards. Tastes almost like a cross between a lager and IPA of today with a breadth of malt character. Slightly bitter after finish.

610,2751,KT3418,3,This is my first time trying it in 2021 and I could tell it was gonna be old school but this is just bore snore. Medium body with extremely light flavor. This is being dominated on by other breweries. After reading some reviews it sounds like fresh on tap is the preference instead of the cans and bottles on the shelf. Which makes sense.

610,2751,NCSapiens,4.27,"I ordered this on tap in Maui of all places and had low expectations going in. Wow did this blow those low expectations out of the water. Malty, citrusy, and bitter, the way an IPA should be. Since then I bought a not-so-fresh six pack, and it wasn’t great. I believe this partially explains the high variance of scores on this site. This beer is underrated for a fresh pour and overrated for a shelf turd. And while that is always the case, it is especially an issue with Racer 5.",Bear Republic Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,93

Smells a bit sweet for the style. Taste didn’t knock me out but not bad. Nice balance of bitterness and slightly fruity. Feels full bodied. Little to no aftertaste. Overall a good choice but due to the limited availability here I’ll seek out other offerings from Stone.,Bear Republic Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,93

610,2751,BerkeleyBeerSleuth,4.19,"Reviewed from 22 oz. bomber. No visible date on bottle. This is one I used to drink a lot in the early days of exploring craft beer. It's a local staple at bars in the bay area. I always remember it being a brightly flavored IPA. Let's dive into this glass. Beautiful amber color with a rich creamy head. Beautiful lacing all over the glass. Moderate carbonation. Aroma of pine, orange marmalade, lemon zest and candied malts. I have a feeling this isn't the freshest it could be but it seems approachable enough. The malts give off a slight bready smell. Good taste. Bright fruit flavors and a decent amount of bitterness backed up by a strong malt foundation. Slightly refreshing and the alcohol isn't discernible at 7.5%. This beer can be dangerous if you put too many back without thinking because it's that drinkable. I go back for a second chug and it is just as refreshing as the first. A very well balanced moderately hopped example of a west coast IPA. In a time before double IPA's and triple IPA's this was the go to strong ale along with Mendocino brewery's Eye of the Hawk.",Bear Republic Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,93

Appropriate carbonation leaving a bit of lacing. prickly mouthfeel .Excellent Overall...this is very good and would buy anytime wanting a very well made earthy IPA. Nice to know that this is around and will continue to try their beers.

610,2751,AElfwine_Nerevar,4.36,"BB: 05/08/21 Consumed: 02/02/21  L: Pours a deep gold to pale amber with excellent clarity. An aggressive pour gives a 2 finger pillowy white head. The head has good retention and leaves nice lacing on the way down.  S: Pine, floral notes, hints of citrus, a barely perceptible grainy malt character, and caramel malt.  T: Citrus on the front end. Floral qualities mixing with grainy malt and caramel malt in the middle. The sweet caramel malt continues towards the back and finish. On the back end I get resinous pine mixed with sweet caramel malt that is blunted and overcome with a nice bitter citrus rind finish.  F: This has a medium body with medium-low carbonation. The mouthfeel is creamy with a nice drying finish.  O: Where have you been all my life? Mostly kidding, but I have been living in a purgatory of NEIPAs and this was just what I needed. I will have to revisit some of the classic C-hop beer like Two-hearted to see how this compares. Overall, a finely crafted American IPA (it's not bitter enough for me to classify it as a WCIPA) that checks all the right boxes. It is a bit sweeter than some but the sweetness is blunted and balanced by the bitter, drying finish. I would recommend trying this if you get a chance.",Bear Republic Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,93

610,2751,RedBalloon,4.71,"22oz bottle. I believe there's a best by date of 11/27/20 in Julian on the bottom of the bottle, but this is an ambiguous guess. Poured into a Teku.  1"" creamy white head. Color is an opaque orange, light amber. Tightly packed bubbles in the head persist for quite some time before receding.  Aroma is mostly pine, a moderate amount of biscuit malt and some fresh cut grass.  Taste is more pine. It's well balanced with the malt flavor, but assertively hop-forward.  Medium-bodied. Finishes dry and bitter. Good carbonation.  This is a classic West Coast IPA and a rubric for its style. It's not over the top with its hop flavors, but they are present and respectable.",Bear Republic Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,93
610,2751,BillAfromSoCal,4.44,"12 oz bottle purchased off a room temp shelf at Trader Joes, despite the label stating to ""keep cold"". I don't see a bottling date. Pours a nice gold/amber with the merest hint of haze, and a nice voluminous, relatively persistent head. Not much lacing. I like this one a lot because of the nice balance of malts and hops. Nicely balanced mouthfeel, too with just right amount of carbonation, viscosity, and general feel. To me this is the classic example of a west coast style IPA by which others can be judged. Widely available, relatively inexpensive.",Bear Republic Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,93

As I sat on my front porch and just watched the world go by on a crisp fall afternoon, this dazzled my tastebuds with new flavors after every sip. Truly a beautiful beer. Cheers to the Bear Republic for a fantastic brew!  Revisited a year later: (Old Rank 4.29) I think the joy I had for this beer more than a year ago has dissipated. It's good, don't get me wrong. I'm just not sure its THAT good. Solid drinking beer and I was happy to see it at Shays in Harvard Square.

S: Hoppy, skunky, sweet, dense T: Nicely balanced IPA, hovers really evenly between hoppy, sweet, bitter flavors with a unique and crisply boozy if a bit skunky after taste. Sometimes too sweet for me, especially in a session.

610,2751,JohnniEMc,4.52,"A 22 oz. bottle eventually emptied into a clear pint glass poured out a beautiful golden amber beer. There came with it, a nice bouquet of malts and hops. A small but long lasting white head and some glass lacing completed a beautiful picture. This classic delivers some wonderful balances; between the malt base and hops and within the hops themselves. The result is one of the best standard AIPAs made, although it may be categorized as a West Coast IPA. Regardless, when it's available, get it. Racer 5 is consistently enjoyable; from visual, to aroma, to first taste, to feel and to the dry and slightly bitter aftertaste. Addendum: I never read other reviews before I write mine. I was amazed there were so many low scores. Then I noticed, many were from years ago. The most recent eight all rate this beer above 4. Could something have changed, i.e. recipe or shipping methods. Update, June 2021: Ratings continue to improve as the rare opportunity to sample this from a tap in Philadelphia has occurred. Even more bold on both the malt and hop categories, this is one amazingly taste-filled AIPA.",Bear Republic Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,93
610,2751,SierraNevallagash,4.29,"Bear Republic - Racer 5  Cannot believe this showed up in Maine. When I lived in California, this was like, a defining beer of my coming-of-age years. It has been a while, and I can't wait.  Pint can - BB 11/14/20 poured into an IPA glass at fridge temp.  Pours a truly brilliant amber colour. Not IPA amber, or amber ale red - this is like, a glass of amber. Nearly glowing orange. She's super clear - not crystal, but certainly West Coast. Some lazy effervescence, and a fibger of sticky off-white head with fair retention, leaving seriously webby lacing behind.  Nose: Man oh man. California. This really highlights the traditional style. Very caramel malt forward. No pilsner grain or oats - straight caramel malt, and resinous hops. Tangerine, pine, and an interesting, almost apple pie/cinnamon spice note in the background. It's simple, but it's unique in that it's actually an outlier now. I haven't smelled an IPA like this in...Well, a long time. It's just damn good.  Palate: Instantly, I recognise something about this. Pliny. It hits with a big caramel malt backbone - only slightly sweet, and then this blast of Pacific Northwest resinous hoppy goodness. Pine, resin, some subtle tangerine and grapefruit, and that classic boiled Sincoe note that defines Pliny. The beers are similar. This lacks the insane floral quality of Pliny, and delivers more of that seriously resinous Chinook-type Yakima hop bite, and this is a touch drier. The finish brings a digging bitterness that isn't overwhelming, but it damn well shows you what kind of beer it is. That subtle spice note threads through, and then you're left with lingering bitter hop oils. Timeless.  Mouthfeel/Body: At 7.5% ABV, this is seriously crisp. The sweet caramel malt character is definitely more dialed back than many other WCIPAs, and that slightly drier quality really boosts the drinkability. It isn't sticky or cloying, the effervescence is zippy and lively, and the bitter finish just sets you up for that next sip. Hop oils linger.  Overall: Listen, I'm not going to pretend like this is the best IPA in the world. It isn't. However, in the midst of an overwhelming quantity of hazy, fruity New England IPAs (I style I do enjoy), this just cuts like a knife, and shows you how rare these actually are. That local New England take on a ""West Coast Style IPA"" does not touch this. I almost think it's incapable of it. This is true back-to-basic roots right here. The craft IPA in its original, stripped-down, minimalist form. It truly shines like a glowing amber gem in a foggy, foggy world. This beer exceeds in a way many others cannot, simply by being it's simple, effortless self. A true classic.",Bear Republic Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,93
610,2751,LarryV,4.43,"16 oz can - pours a lovely amber color with a creamy, long lasting head. Mellow nose of hops and malt. Excellent balance - hoppy, but really nice malt backbone that tames the hops a bit without being excessively sweet, classic WCIPA profile.

Excellent and will definitely buy it again.",Bear Republic Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,93

610,2751,EJPA_0425,3.78,"If you like malty IPAs this is your ticket. Pours a brownish amber color with creamy head and pretty strong haze. Smells sweet, not like other IPAs like juicy raisins and honey. Tastes of a mixture of hempy hops and sweet raisins. Usually I don't feel so good after these sweet beers, but I felt pretty good from this one. Overall definitely not my favorite IPA.

610,2751,hopphead31415,4.26,"This is a 7.5% ABV beer with 75 IBUs and it features Cascade, Columbus, Chinook, and Centennial hops, the “four C’s”.  Look-It pours a light golden copper color with a thick foamy head that looks like fermenting yeast with its roiling boiling bubbly-ness. The lacing is thick and dry.  Smell-I smell strong notes of honey and flowers upfront and a bready sweet malt body. I notice some grassy and earthy hops as well. I get hints of lemon and apricot on the nose.  Taste-It tastes of buckwheat honey and clove along with noticeable floral hops. It gives way to a grassy, earthy hop component and herbal notes. There’s a spiciness alongside the carbonation and the mild bite from the alcohol. I get pineapple, lemon zest, apricot, mango, and floral notes like clover and rose petal. The caramel and biscuit malts are present as well. It is medium-bodied and leaves a hop resin coating on the tongue. It is rich and chewy, but not over-done.  Overall-This is an OG brew with a well-articulated execution that makes one realize this beer is the precursor to the West Coast Style IPA.

610,2751,hophead723,4.51,"Got at Trader Joe's for only $9.99 a six-pack, when most places are a dollar or two more than that. Best by date in late June so this is as fresh as possible. This is my first time trying this for some reason. I have seen it on shelves for years but I think that it just didn't look appealing with it's finish flag decoration. I didn't know that it was so highly rated. Poured into my awesome Samuel Smith British Pub glass (also from Trader Joe's) with a laser-etched logo at the bottom of the glass for nucleation sites.  Look: When I first poured it, there was a tiny tornado of bubbles perfectly spinning from the bottom! The perfectly golden colored body is crowned by a slightly off white head of parchment colored foam. A pinky-thick layer of froth remains atop the guilded brew. Lacing clings to the side as you gulp it down.  Smell: Grapefruit peel and apricot dominate the aroma, with a touch of honey underneath. Malted barley, wheat, and crystal malts contribute to the enticing aroma. The malt base is designed to outline and accentuate the unique floral qualities of the Columbus and Cascade hops used to brew this masterpiece.  Taste: The taste is a blast of hoppy goodness carrying grapefruit peel, lemon, mango, apricot, light pineapple, and floral notes supported by caramel and biscuit malts. The slick and oily well-hopped body is silky smooth and glides across the palate, delivering its rich flavors with each satisfying gulp. Lingering fruity bitterness, toasty malts, and alcohol warmth augment the finish.  Overall: This beer is impressively good. I feel like it really is the precursor to all of these ""West Coast Style"" beers out there, so its an OG beer.

610,2751,Ozzylizard,4.03,"$ 3.63/ 16 oz can ($ 0.227/oz) at Chalet Party Shoppe, Middlebury, IN. Reviewed 9/22/19. “BB 07/28/19” stamped on bottom of can. On shelf at store. Stored and served at 42 degrees in a hand-washed and dried glass coffee cup. Appearance – 4. First pour – Yellow, hazy. Body – Dark yellow, hazy and opaque. When held to the light, becomes a bit translucent. Head – Average (Maximum three cm, aggressive center pour), off-white, medium density, average duration, diminishing to a five mm crown and a caldera-like cap. Lots of small pieces of three-dimensional lacing remain on the glass. Lacing – Excellent. Three-dimensional rows of tiny to small bubbles, connected by short, thin columns and having short, fat stalactites. See also above. Aroma – 4 – Conifers and a hint of malt. Flavor – 4 – Good balance of piney malt (Or malty pine) with both noticeable and neither dominating. No alcohol (7.5 % ABV) flavor or aroma, no dimethylsulfide, no diacetyl. Palate – 3.75 – Medium, almost creamy, lively carbonation. Final impression and summation: 4.25. I’m sure that the room temperature shelf storage and being past date contribute to the decreased coniferousness and increased maltiness, but it’s still tasty!",Bear Republic Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,93

610,2751,the_awesometeer,4.17,The beer is a clear golden color and had a nice foamy white head. The beer is fruity and sweet to the nose. You can get a nice balance of malts and hops. There are a lot of fruit flavors but the one that sticks out to me is pineapple. It reminds me of the sweet pineapple on a Hawaiian pizza. It is followed by a mild dry bitterness. The beer is a great drink... I want pizza now,Bear Republic Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,93

610,2751,jrc1093,4.18,"Best by 9/26/19  Pours light burnt orange, slightest cloudiness, and topped with a pillowy, taut off-white head; very nice retention results in thick globs of sudsing trailing down the glass, as well as a dense, foamy cap and sizeable collar.  Aromas of caramelized oranges, sunflowers, apricot, pine, and grapefruit zest fly out front, while citrus and caramel malt builds on the back end and an earthy pungency is interspersed in between; there’s a delicate nuance of florality, piney hops, and citrus that has this quietly standing out.  Taste highlights a mix of candied pineapple, grapefruit pith, bitter, earthy pine, burnt citrus peel, herbal resin, and rice cracker shrouded in an overarching hoppy florality.  Mouthfeel provides a medium body, crisp and mostly dry, and steadily develops a condensed but punchy bitterness; underlying creamy kind of smoothness from a balanced carbonation; slightly oily toward finish leaving a thin layer of earthy resin to coat the palate.  This hits all the right notes and then some for a classic west coast-style IPA; concentrated bitterness, savory pine and grapefruit leanings, and an ultra florality that has it standing on its own. Prime execution and immensely enjoyable on all accounts.",Bear Republic Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,93

Smells of zesty grapefruit and lemon with strong hints of pine bitterness.  Taste is dominated by pine and resin and just a bit of alcohol.  Mouthfeel is sticky. Strong bitter aftertaste.

Over the years, I've only had it on tap (for sentimental reasons), but tonight -- for the first time -- I enjoyed it from a 12 oz. bottle purchased from my local beer shop. The pine/floral taste brought back great memories of those early IPA days. Malt plays a supportive, not dominating, role...while there is a pleasant level of bitterness (and even a degree of dryness) that lets you know you are drinking a quality beer.

Very nice pine, citrus and a medium hoppy feel up front. A little thick feeling on my palate. Flavor improves a bit in the citrus department as the beer gets a little closer to room temperature. Consumed over 55 minutes. Citrus and grapefruit and pine finish really stand out as the beer approaches room temperature. No idea what the IBu's are on this one, not really overly hoppy, but has, IMHO, a very well rounded, balanced taste, flavor and finish. Really, really enjoy this IPA.

Citrus bodes well with the more evergreen-like hops. Biscuit, bread, and pale malts behind further mellow it out. Flavor profile is a lovely blend of biscuit, bread, and pale malts with resin, dank, and citrus hops. The duo works together well to form a hoppy, but balanced IPA. Hop notes are firmly on the traditional/classical side. Mouth feel is medium-thick with a fizzy texture that imparts a little grainy abrasiveness around the edges. This mash up of textures with the slightly thicker feel creates a rather bold mouth feel overall. Overall, this is a great classic IPA. Hop notes are plentiful, but are well balanced out by malts.

Racer 5 is the color of honey and has a delicate white head of about a finger. The lacing is nice.  The aroma is sharp, the oily citrus hops are like sharp edges to the olfactory sense. Resin plays around the edges.  Hops and carbonation combine for a biting sip. After that comes the hop assault with orange, grapefruit, and resin as bitterness and malt roll further and further back. The malt is caramel, but savory or rather a bit biscuity, which helps contain that cheap sweetness.  It's the mouthfeel that makes this beer. It is all at once crisp, biting, tangy, and full. There's plenty of carbonation.  When I picked up this six pack and checked just to make sure I'd reviewed this home state brew, I was surprised to see I had not.

There's hops in the nose, hops in the taste, and there would be hops in the sound if it had one. Pine zing. The malts are underneath and they follow but primarily (for me at least) in their presence is the sense of sweetness and heft that is there but not in the spotlight.

Tasty light corn-like malts and light zesty citrus from unfiltered California goodness all living in a bottle. Finish is superb. Dry but perfectly so. This went down the best one year straight from the bottle, in cold weather on the lake going for striped bass. It'll always be a go-to for that reason. Not long ago the brewery yanked itself from TX due to their state's critical drought, but I've seen it appear as of lately so it seems all is good again for when I need a highly-drinkable world class IPA.",Bear Republic Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,93

610,2751,ManapuaMan,4.04,"Bitter, citrus, dry. One of the beers that kicked off my IPA-obsession. Having this on tap in Boston was like a sipping ambrosia straight from the heavens. Bright citrus with a smooth bitterness and a dry finish - the template for an awesome West Coast IPA. Amber pour with a soft head that sticks around for a couple minutes. Aroma of orange peel, grapefruit and pine (the 1-2-3 classic combo). Taste orange, grapefruit pith, pine, toasted malt with an herbal tea kicker. Nice lingering bitterness cleans out the sip. A gold standard for the West Coast IPA that has remained true while my (and many others') palate has changed after prolonged beatings from IPA after IPA, like waves eroding a beach. Doesn't change what the beer brings to the table.",Bear Republic Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,93
610,2751,Lone_Freighter,4.18,"The appearance was a nice looking hazy golden amber/brown color with a one finger white foamy head that dissipates within less than a minute. The smell had a nice allocation of bitter piney hops to bittersweet citrus hops. It ends up allowing a decent malt background to come in as the beer warms. The taste was mainly bittersweet leaning more towards the bitter side, but lets a decent sweet citrus and slightly maltiness come in to balance nicely. There was a nice citrusy/piney sweet aftertaste and also a nice dry finish. On the palate, it sat about a light to medium with a decent sessionability running about my mouth and tongue. It had a decent sharp bitter assault on my mouth and tongue like a good AIPA should. The carbonation is harsh just as well. Overall, in my opinion, this was a great AIPA well worthy of having again.",Bear Republic Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,93

A: Poured into an IPA glass. Bottle conditioned. A rich golden-amber hue with hazy floating sediment and good carbonation. Produces a large head of fluffy white foam that lasts for a while before reducing to a persistent surface layer. Nice lacing.  S: Aroma of intense resinous hops with notes of pine, dank weed, floral hints, citrus peel, vague tropical fruit, sweet malt, mild earthy yeast and more than a whiff of booze. Nice.  T: Tastes of bitter pine-laden hops with hints of resin, dank weed, grapefruit, citrus peel, floral notes, sweet malt, earthy yeast and a touch of booze in the background. A strident hoppy bitterness upon swallowing.  M: Mouthfeel is smooth and tingly, with pleasant carbonation and nice body. Hop oils stimulate the palate. Aftertaste of bitter hop notes, sweet malt and yeast.  O: Excellent - a top notch American IPA with a well deserved reputation. Looks great, while the aroma and flavour are a satisfying blend of intense aromatic hops, sweet malt and yeast. The only minor flaw is the slightly excessive alcoholic note. Good body. Goes down all too easily - deserves to be sampled if you have the chance.",Bear Republic Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,93

610,2751,digboy,4.4,"12 oz bottle bought in Saugus MA, no date. Never heard of the beer or the brewery so went in blind. Now I think I might have gotten the best pick of the store.  Pours a ember-like hazy orange color with 2 finger soapy head that settles down quickly to a half finger. Truly impressive color.  Aroma is hoppy citrus and resin - strong but not overpowering - and a touch of pee which I do not appreciate.  Taste is hop forward but with a strong malt backbone too - nice combination that play well together. Moderately bitter with a strong resinous, almost dank, earthy taste that lingers well into the aftertaste and coats the tongue. That's the real treat of this beer.  Feel is crisp with a little stickiness  Overall this is a great beer obviously crafted to a fine degree. I feel fortunate to have found some way out on the right coast.  ** For god's sake, don't drink this out-of-the-fridge cold!

Quality example of an American IPA.  355 ml bottle, M and S, Bristol - Not as good as above as I can't find any of the resin notes from above and it feels a lot maltier than I remember.

610,2751,KIMCHI,5,"Bear Republic is one of those California treasures I miss since I have moved to Texas. The wonderful in-laws on their recent trip to the last great state brought up boxes of Racer 5 and that will make both me and my wife extremely happy. Racer 5 has a beautiful cloudy and bright colour with a heavy nose that may intimidate non IPA drinkers or people who don't like hoppy beer. Do not be turned off by the aromas of wonderfulness for those that don't appreciate hops this beer has a strong yet, smooth and easy to drink flavor. It is very hoppy however, it has delicate nuances of orange with a crisp mouth feel and a bright aftertaste that will not overstay its visit. Racer 5 is one of those rare IPA's where a pro can enjoy it's masterfully unique and esoteric flavours and a new IPA drinker or maybe those who don't consider themselves IPA fans will pour a glass and perhaps fill their fridges. Racer 5 is a 5/5 in every category except it is not easy to find west of the Sierra's and can sometimes be difficult to buy in Southern California. Until these puppies run out though we have a beautiful house full of Racer 5 and that makes me a happy camper. Geonbae!!!!",Bear Republic Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,93

Aroma is more malt forward - some citrus and piney hops - nothing exhilarating. Taste is balance between sweet malts and some hops, with a moderately bitter finish. Feel is smooth, but a little under-carbonated for my taste. Overall, I feel this is more suited for people who like things that are less hop-forward. Hop-lovers beware, this may not be up your alley.

Just fantastic smelling, and the flavor isn't a let down either. Same deal. Really nice hop forward and without that astringent thing going on.

610,2751,Everydayoff,4.48,"355ml bottle poured into a pint glass.  Hazy orange amber in color, the pour builds up massive silky white head that holds strong will to stand with excellent retention. It just slowly dissipates to an eternal frothy layer atop along with several refined lacing ring, patch, and spot along the way down. There are sediments floating around.  Very fresh, juicy, yet fruity aroma by its hoppy goodness, I am reminded of citrus, grapefruit, lemon, pineapple, passion fruit, kaffir lime, pine, resin, floral, spice, and slight earthy. Yes, it is truly hop bombardment. Malt is there too in the back end with a biscuit character to slight caramel.  Very well balance, hop still prevails but it is not too harsh while biscuit and caramel malt try to bring in sweetness and creaminess to reinforce as supporting. All the hop characters in the aroma also reflect in the taste together with steady bitterness at the end of the sip that also nicely lingers in the aftertaste.  The body is full with smooth mouthfeel from its lively carbonation generated some crisp and refreshing feel upon the palate, pleasantly dry finish that will lead you to another quick quaff.  Great IPA indeed, all the characters, they harmoniously exhibit in great order. Alcohol is very well concealed making it equipped with evil quaffing quality.

It has all the tropical fruit notes you're going to expect in the aroma category.

The old toffee and garlic remain on the palate after the swallow. Thing is, I still keep wanting to drink it for the first part of the taste.  Feel is rich, creamy, spiked with some decent carbonation. The finish is dry and musky, leaving a nice parch behind.  Overall, Racer 5 is a good pale ale.

Aroma is nice, leans grapefruit citrus wise, seems to have those C hops going in a good old school way.  What follows is a citrus that evolves from the usual old grapefruit to taking on a very small amount of tangerine. As they have expanded their distribution, you can get a little more variety out of these, some have seemed quite malty relative to the hop bomb some of them used to be. Some pine in there too, never one to skimp on bitterness in this beer.",Bear Republic Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,93

S: Nice nose, but not overpowering, with a mix of citrus & pine hops.  T/F: Nicely balanced flavor, with citrus hops up front and a nicely bitter finish. Very smooth mouthfeel.  O: Really nice IPA.

610,2751,_drummer_,4.47,"Great IPA. I've been trying more IPA's lately and this one is definitely one of the best that I've had. Golden color, good carbonation, decent head that hangs around for a bit (but not too long). Great, hoppy flavor. Smooth finish with a slight aftertaste of citrus, among other things. I'd definitely get this again.",Bear Republic Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,93
610,2751,bsp77,3.97,"I was super excited to finally try this. It is definitely a quality IPA and well executed, but in 2016, it is trumped by lots of beers. Standard citrus and pine balanced by toasted malts. Nice, dry finish.",Bear Republic Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,93

610,2751,Czequershuus,4.54,"This beer pours a fairly clear pale orange with an average head. The aroma leads with pine, supported by orange peel, grapefruit peel, underripe mango, and some caramel. The flavor leads with bright pine and resin, some dank notes, rounding into citrus peel, as well as vanilla and caramel. The mouthfeel is lighter than some West Coast style IPAs, and all the better for it. Overall I have finally found a West Coast IPA that truly works for me - not too sweet, lots of bitterness, great pine dominant hops with citrus accents and a few other notes. I can see why this is a classic.",Bear Republic Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,93

Solid finger of white head that settles into a thin creamy layer.  Smell: A juicy and piney hop forward aroma with a scent of citrus fruit and pine. Upfront citrus hop scent of orange peel, grapefruit, tangerine, apricot, and lemon. Earthy hop hints of pine resin and grass. Malt hints of grains, cracker, and wheat with yeast. A pretty nice aroma.  Taste: Like it smells, a juicy and earthy hop forward taste with notes of citrus fruit and pine. Ripe citrus hop notes of grapefruit, orange peel, lemon, tangerine, and apricot. Earthy hop notes of pine resin and grass. Nicely bitter. Backing malt notes of cracker, grains, and wheat along with some yeast. A pretty good taste.

Good ripe citrus and pine flavor.",Bear Republic Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,93
610,2751,MacMalt,4.19,"Poured into IPA glass. It pours a golden-honey color with a fluffy, two-finger milk-white head and lacing. Excellent retention. It smells sweet malt, pine, grapefruit, floral hops, and perhaps a whiff of caramel. It has a solid malt base with lots of fruit, both grapefruit and sweet apricot or peach. It also has the bitter, hoppy finish you'd expect from a West Coast IPA. It definitely has a bite to it. This ale is medium-bodied, moderately carbonated, and the 7.5% ABV gives it substance without being overwhelming. Overall, it is a very good West Coast IPA. It's right up there with the leaders of the style.",Bear Republic Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,93
610,2751,PhilsPils,3.85,"At one time, I thought this was a really good IPA but either I have been subjected to way better brews or this beer has changed.

Pours a slightly cloudy orange with a one inch sticky head, that leaves behind some attractive lace.  Smell apricot, tangerine, caramel, pine, biscuit, and grapefruit, pretty damn tame. That is probably because of the 150 days old it probably is.  Taste follows apricot and orange up front with some caramel and biscuit, and pine and grapefruit in the finish.  Mouthfeel is medium plus, nice carbonation, not really dry, and good drinkability.  Overall this is not it should be, they should follow Stone and go with 90 days. I don't care that I know it is way past its prime, they should change the length of expiration.",Bear Republic Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,93
610,2751,HotDogBikeRide,4.38,"Poured from a bottle without a date. Equally parts hazy and carbonated, a golden-tinted beer with some sudsy lacing and a thin, retained head. Smell is pretty average at best, basic malt and hop profile, not that pungent. But this was stored at room temperature so I could see how it may have fallen off. Taste is a little more complex with several different hops highlighting what is a very refreshing, semi-dry finish. A little bitter component at the end, standard of many good IPA's. This is simply a good beer. Nothing too mindblowing, but definitely like it and would drink it anytime. Cheers.",Bear Republic Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,93
610,2751,Beginner2,3.6,"Better upfront to confess my bias: I don't like ale loaded with hops as an escape from the work of learning how they interplay with malts. So, Racer 5 gets a brief review. First, I had it in their brewpub in Healdsburg several years ago and that experience was good. Second, this was on one of my lists.  I now note when a beer is listed in one of my three books comprising my classical beer education.

Outstanding nose of citrus hops, rind and pine with a subtle dank tickle underneath.  Almost medium body with a smooth texture that has an oily component. World class carbonation with a bursting effervescent middle and a finely bubbled prickly finish.  The flavor profile is quite outstanding and is masterfully balanced. It begins with a blended hop flavor (heavy on the pine and rind) that slowly tails off into a subtle dank element. Orange arrives along with the subtle dank notes as the middle approaches over a succulent balancing sweetness of bready biscuit and light caramel. Bitterness is moderate and perfectly balanced. The finish delivers a very slight alcohol note and associated astringency. A slow fade of sweet orange rind lingers.",Bear Republic Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,93

I saw some people calling it out as better than RRs Blind Pig so i tried them side by side and Blind Pig blew it out of the water in every way.

Great golden amber to orange color on the pour. It has a nice medium-bodied feel ! Citrusy up front, piney on the backend with just enough bitterness. The flavor stays with you after it finds its way down . Clocking in at a 7.5% ABV, this one could catch up to you with the quickness.

610,2751,smanson56,4.1,Poured into a tulip glass a medium yellow orange color. Not as dark as a lot of west coast IPA's. The nose has some tropical fruits along with some piney resins.

610,2751,Back_in_the_Saddle,4.5,"This was poured into a pint glass. The appearance was a bronzed golden amber to orange color with a light transparency allowing a fine carbonation to be seen rising at a moderate pace. One finger white foamy head displaces and is replaced by some messy stringy lacing. The smell had a wonderful burst of bitter piney/resinous hops to citrusy hops. An evenly settled caramel malt is pretty far in the background of this beer. The taste was purely bittersweet all throughout the entire consumption. Never lost a step in the movement of this down my throat. The mouthfeel was about a light to medium in body with a fantastic sessionability. Carbonation feels good for an AIPA and for me as enough hops burst on the scene to lead the charge for who's to claim the harshness on my tongue - hops win - which is good! Overall, AIPA fans in the distro of this, you'd better ""race"" out there to get this when its fresh. Why? Because you don't have to stand in line just to try it.",Bear Republic Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,93

610,2751,cyguyjg,4.44,"I was fortunate to have this on draft. However, the lights in the pub were low so I didn't get a good look at it. Nonetheless it had a light but persistent head. The taste was amazing. Very smooth and thought the hops were evident, they were also subtle... satisfying to perhaps all but those who must have the hops forward Double and Imperial IPAs. This would make a great session IPA if not for the moderately high ABV.",Bear Republic Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,93
610,2751,pbaltodano,5,I have had the pleasure of drinking many IPAs and this has been my favorite for over a year and a half. My liquor stocked the 22oz. and I requested the 6 pack glass bottles which is $11.29 out the door. The 22s are $5.40 so obviously the 6 pack is a better deal. This beer has it all. It has those amazing citrus notes as well as a deliciously bitter taste. Not for those who don't like a strong beer as 2 12oz. bottles will leave you buzzed if you down it fast enough. Whenever this is not in stock (which pisses me off) I reach for a Ruination as it's the only other beer that satisfies my IPA craving. Super reluctant to grab anything else (and feel like I am cheating on Racer) and you better believe my glass recycling is all racer bottles!,Bear Republic Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,93

610,2751,Strat58cat,4.3,"Solid. The only word that I can think of to describe this classic IPA is solid. It's solidly in the middle of the IPA paradigm. The execution is solid. It's one of the most famous west coast IPAs for very good reason.  The look is very promising. This India pale ale pours a golden orange color, moderately hazy. The head is a delicious foamy eggshell color that foams up elaborately, retains, and laces. They've spared no expense on the malt, the head makes clear. All kinds of good stuff seems to be in store.  The aroma is a strong point of Racer 5. They've nailed it. It achieves the tropical grapefruit aroma that I'm looking for. I know tropical grapefruit is not a thing, but in the best IPAs they achieve it anyway. The aroma is perfectly modulated - neither overbearing nor weak. It stays righteous until the bottom of the glass, never fading or getting catty. Barely detectable, just behind the citrus scent of the hops, the malt conveys a pleasant biscuit aroma.  The taste of Racer 5 is solid. It's a mainstream west coast IPA flavor, initially strongly citrus from the hops but backed up proportionately with a subtle yet very appealing biscuit flavor. The description biscuit is overused in my experience, but this is truly it. I've never really enjoyed a biscuit-like malt except with Racer 5. As you might expect, since both are from the California wine country, Lagunitas and Racer 5 have a similar aesthetic, sharing their beautiful citrus hops bouquet and the effort to balance the hops with a significant malt. Racer 5 out runs their wine country competition in the Stone-like appealing dankness of their IPA and the flavorful biscuit malt that backs the hops up. Like Lagunitas, Racer 5 is a very easy drinking, pleasant and enjoyable IPA. The fabled bitterness of IPAs is no doubt present, but it's in sync with the expectations from the flavors and so is purely enjoyable.  The feel of Racer 5 is fine. It's not watery, but medium-bodied. It does not come across as thin-feeling like Rebel can, but doesn't quite have as much body as I seem to feel with Lagunitas.  Overall, Racer 5 is a fabled west coast IPA for good reason. It's extremely good. Like Stone, it costs a few dollars more for a 12-pack than some other appealing and widely available options, but it's worth it. Maybe it's not worth springing for one of the true paragons every trip, but every now and then . . .",Bear Republic Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,93

It clocks in at 7.5 and is usually less than 5 bucks. Its good. Its so good that I usually buy one with whatever else I am buying at the time, Like today. I bought sixers of ace pineapple, and Michelob Amberbock, as well as the new DOGFISH PUNK...I got a 22 of Racer 5. Its perfect for that, get beer, start or enjoy a racer 5 somewhere early or middle. Its good/great and cheap.

The taste follows the smell very nicely and leads into the aftertaste and finds it's way into the finish. The mouthfeel was about a light to medium on the body with a decent drinkable feel to it.

I get more malt in the taste than the smell  Mouthfeel: Medium bodied; Super smooth and creamy with a dry bitter finish  Overall: I could see this being a top tier IPA back in the day, and i probably would have rated it higher even five years ago.

610,2751,BethanyB,4.06,"Look: Poured from a bottle into a goblet. It was a cloudy medium amber, with a giant, fluffy white head that slowly melted into a snowy hillock. I throughly cleaned and dried another glass and poured a second to test the clarity. Still cloudy.  Smell: A masterfully balanced C-hop tree from top to bottom: earth, grass, wood, and citrus. Some tropical fruit scents and a piercing smell of white pepper make for a captivating garnish.  Taste: One of those nice, round balls of complexity that fascinates as a collaboration rather than a conglomeration. Toasted, buttery malt is topped with grapefruit, mint leaves, and rosemary. A small dose of peach juice and a squeeze of caramel add just enough sweetness to keep the medium-high bitterness from being overwhelming. It's so well done, but it still begs for a little something more to set it apart from other IPAs of good caliber.  Mouthfeel: Slightly creamy, yet still smooth. Light alcohol warming and medium-high carbonation continue the theme of balance by creating an atmosphere that's both refreshing and intoxicating.  Overall: This IPA is undeniably good, but it's perhaps so well-balanced, that it becomes a little boring when compared to the wide varieties of recipes on the market today. Still, it's a sure bet, and one I will therefore continue to buy.",Bear Republic Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,93

Doesnt smell bad or good. Somehow, just nothing there.  Tastes good, but nothing crazy either way. I read Chinook hops. I get that. Mainly just in the form of being bitter at the end. Othherwise, just a lot of muted flavor malt, pine, citrus.  Body is nice. Full and slightly creamy.  I am not sure of the age of this beer, but it was in a cooler. I say this because it is nowhere close to the ratings for me. I know I am in the minority. It just doesnt offer me anything other than not being offensive in any way.

You see I really would like to like them...they're just so available. Purchased a fresh 12 oz bottle of Racer 5 last night from a local deli. I can tell this is good beer, but it's still not my type. I could see having 1 or 2 of these now and then if I'm not pairing them with food but, after 1 or 2, I would need to switch to something else.

Medium head potential, strong head retention. Nice, thick solid rings of lacing left behind on the walls of the glass. S - 4.5 - Pine, grapefruit rind, hops, earthiness, bitterness and a rain water freshness. T - 4.75 - Lightly sweet grapefruit rind upfront which develops into a bitter, hoppy and piney finish. Definitely a bitter biased, west-coast IPA. F - 5 - Nice oily, creamy quality to the body of this brew. Goes down quite smoothly. O - 5 - Drinks easy like a session beer but packs a punch with the ABV. Refreshes and quenches your thirst like water, making this both a good standalone sipping beer or a great food pairing beer as well.

S: Some grapefruit, mostly resinous pine. (disclosure: I'm struggling with a cold so my olfactory senses suck at the moment)  T: Brilliant! Perfect balance between oily hop bitter & beefy off-sweet malt. Everything here is big, yet in absolute equilibrium. Some piney aspects lead into a grapefruity note toward the finish right before the malt hits...just awesome.  M: Burly.

Taste matches the nose perfectly. Just a really balanced and nice drinking beer. More huge citrus (big fresh grapefruit and lemon zest). Prickle of carbonation and a minor hit of hop bitterness nearing the end of the sip. Just enough malt plays through at the end of the sip to round this beer out.  Just a really well-crafted brew. I highly reccomend this. It has so much flavor, yet is so well balanced and easy to drink. Any critique would be maybe a tad bit more carbonation, but this is me nitpicking (plus I like over-carbonated beers). Also it is just a tad bit thick, nothing crazy, again just nitpicking. I would pair this with a grilled chicken breast with a nice salad with a citrus vinaigrette. It gets a 94/100.",Bear Republic Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,93

Smell- Very floral with citrus notes of grapefruit and mango.  Taste- A sweet yet lightly toasted caramel malt flavor that builds up to a bomb of citrus with strong grapefruit notes. Piney hop bunch also arrives until leaving a dry and hoppingly bitter finish.  Mouthfeel- Medium heavy in body with a syrupy feel. Active carbonation.  Overall- Finally got a hold of this popular IPA. I get the hype it has now. Very smooth and quite flavorful. Lots of hop flavors and a nice malt blend.

A clean aroma that was hard to discern at first. Eventually, I picked up some light fruity tones, citrus and peach, and, even more of a cracker like and sweet malt tone. This brew has unbelievable balance. The hops presence is felt all over, in the mouthfeel and in the finish. Yet, the sweet malt backbone is also so omnipresent that it is very much a 50/50 split. The lingering aftertaste is dry and resinously(is that a word?) hoppy. Medium to full bodied almost chewy in the mouth. Soft carbonation brings out the flavors.

F: Tastes of tangy tangerine zest upfront that goes to pineapple syrup and finishes with a bitter piney-ness. Layered with some hints of papaya and passionfruit.  M: Really smooth, probably slightly lower carbonation than most IPAs, but within the realm.  O: I give it an A. It's a bright, easy-drinking, über sweet IPA.

610,2751,IKR,4,Appearance: Slightly hazy light-amber color with a generous-sized white head that slowly faded. This is a good looking IPA.  Smell: Piney and citrus hop aromas dominate the nose. I also pick up some mild bready aromas.  Taste:The pine and citrus aromas carry over to the taste. The pine notes are slightly more upfront than the citrus notes. There is a mild sweetness in the finish. This beer is not as bitter as some IPAs in the finish.  Mouth-feel: on the light side of medium bodied with a medium level of carbonation.  Overall: Good IPA that I wish had a little bit more crispness in the finish.,Bear Republic Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,93

610,2751,DriverB,3.59,"Living in SF and Marin County, I have been drinking Racer 5 for years. Prior to 2010 it was my favorite go to IPA. While it is still decent, it changed dramatically at that time and was never the same. There are a variety of hops listed but overall taste is fairly uniform and one dimensional. Upfront bite but aromas not overly complex or intriguing. It used to be more on a level like sculpin. I now view it slightly above Lagunitas as a highly accessible reasonably priced local beer. My guess is they changed things as they ramped production. Still like it and get it from time to time but view more as a baseline IPA than something special.",Bear Republic Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,93

Slight biscuity flavor.  M: Very clean and crisp. Extremely drinkable with just the right amount of carbonation. Well balanced with minimal bitterness.  O: To me, this is the quintessential IPA.

Not overly bitter, not overly hoppy, with the right amount of malts to keep it tasting like a normal IPA. Smooth and extremely drinkable, especially for a 7.5% abv. Nice biscuit-y flavor that is mellow but hoppy enough at the same time. One of the most perfect balances of malts and hops in any IPA I have had M: Crisp, but not too much of a bite.

A malt peeks through with a light caramel, orange and sweet bread character. There is a tinge of alcohol but not overpowering. The floral hop fills the nose as you drink, then a flash of malt sweetness followed by a delayed bitterness that is very much balanced to the hop aroma. Not a powerful bitterness but smooth. The finish is dry with a lingering citrusy bitterness.  M: Medium body, a little slick on the palate with a moderate carbonation. The 7.5% abv gives a pleasant warming late in the finish.  O: A very well done IPA. Smooth balanced bitterness and hop aroma. Surprisingly less bitterness in the finish for an IPA. Nice clean malt profile. A complex and highly drinkable beer.

610,2751,ZagZagg,4.09,"12oz bottle into snifter  A: Half finger white head sitting on a hazy, unfiltered looking brew. Fine sediment, light/fine carbonation, body appears medium – lacing is moderate and retention is good.  S: Sweet and resinous simultaneously, strong presence of grapefruit with undertones of pineapple and mango. Somewhat of an astringent aroma that is clean as well as mildly dry. Light agitation coaxes out a sterile lemon zest with notes of pine.  T: Clean taste, lemon and grape fruit provide a crisp astringency. Pine needle presents toward the middle mouth and dominates the resinous feel. The middle mouth packs a lot of citrus zest and is drier than I expected. Sweetness arises on the palate as the beer warms, letting on mild notes of mango, honey, and muddled mint leaf. Quite bitter, but well balanced, even a bit tart. The finish has hints of coriander and ginger; hop florals and freshly cut grass.  M: Medium to light body, fine carbonation, good balance between juicy and dry – aftertaste has a coriander soapiness and is again rather dry. Pretty decent drinkability  O: If I did a blind tasting of this, I would think it’s a solid IPA. That being said, I had heard some pretty high praise of this beer and I don’t know that I completely vibe with that. Good drinkability, good full flavor, but I was looking for a juicier palate.

This beer pours a murky amber with one finger of head. The aroma is fairly mild, fruity and sweet, with a bit of orange, but not heavy on citrus or pine, like many IPAs. It's maybe a bit floral.

Heavy lacing outlines the pour line and decorates the glass. This is a fine example of how a quality IPA should look, impressive.

I cant quite nail down the dominate scent which is driving me nuts.  The flavor is top notch with mango, orange and spices draped over a caramel background. Amazing balance between a sweet and bitter sensation, very well done.  Mouthfeel is spot on for the style and the high light of my experience.

A nice malt sweetness, caramel mostly, is also present throughout. The aftertaste is bitter and slightly grainy, with hints of caramel.

610,2751,lochef81,4.26,"This ale pours a orange straw color with a small white head and minimal lacing. The nose is a beautiful balance of malts and hops. The flavor is surprisingly deep and complex. Lots of hop bitterness up front but quickly followed by a rich malty sweetness. If this was the intention of the brewers than I say bravo. I think this beer may have sat on the shelf a little longer than normal but it seems to have turned it into an even better, more balanced ale than was originally intended. Its just unfortunate that Bear Republic has pulled out of Michigan. I'll miss this and Hop Head Rye.",Bear Republic Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,93

Aroma: Hoppy and bitter, laced with spicy cedar and pine.  Taste: Hoppy up front, then a malt body holds up the beer. The finish is citric with bitter grapefruit coming through.  Mouthfeel: Medium bodied, but pretty thick.  Overall: Pretty much a palate wrecker, loads of bitterness and hops. Pretty solid.",Bear Republic Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,93

I like it, it's very classic, but I'm surprised it got rated 94/100. M - 4 - light - medium mouthfeel, alc completely covered, aftertaste is hoppy bitterness with grapefruit flavors. O - 4 - It's a great standard west coast IPA. However, if I was looking for something very special I probably wouldn't go with this one.

Not in-your-face hoppy and bitter like some but not too light and easy to forget either. A very well balanced flavor palate with orange and pineapple moving into a crisp pine note in the middle. Directly followed by a bit of caramel and finished off with a crisp hop bitterness.  Mouthfeel: Smooth, dry, and balanced, like an ideal IPA.  Overall: A great all around IPA that can be enjoyed slowly if you're in the mood but won't fill you up if you drink it too quickly.

Just had my first Double Jack as well, but as I was enjoying it with my dad and didn't want to be distracted by revew writing I chose to just give a rating - went with 5 - Hope to give a full review someday, it won't be quite 5 but it's certainly above 4.75  I always struggle to assign a number to the appearance of a brew, as I feel it's meaningless (will probably be the one factor that brings FWDJ down from a 5). Racer 5 looks great, but I'm not sure that it's 'perfect' - also not sure what's holding it back from that perfect rating either. Looks very good though - to hell with it - I don't want the look of the beer to bring down the score in case I decide I'm in love with it, 5/5 *EDIT*: Later, when I got to see what happened with the lacing, I decided 5/5 was a good assessment. Smells good but the aroma isn't knocking my socks off.  Now to the good stuff - taste. It's really, um, good (sorry). I'm getting pine with grapefruit, as per usual, but there's some nectarine in there as well, maybe a little peach, is that mango? I'm trying too hard. 4/5 - it's not 'in your face' but I could see it getting to be a bit much over time. Not a session ale, but I'm glad that the one bottle of it that I do have is a big one!  Mouthfeel is awesome - see, this is why it bugs me so much that my cousin drank it straight from the bottle - there's no way the creamy goodness came through. If you've had hopslam, there's a similar thing happening here.

610,2751,DMXLOX22,4.54,"Picked up a single of this brew at my local establishment, Civera's in Drexel Hill. Heard good things about this one from a few friends. Kinda excited. Let's see how this goes.  Appearance: Pours a hazy, golden color that leaves behind a nice 1-1 1/2 inch head that is somewhat thin, but also quite appealing. Really left a nice, tight lacing around the glass almost all the way down. Inviting.  Smell: Grassy hops is the most dominant smell that comes first upon checking it out. Decided to a take a second round. Earthy hops are still abutment, along with a citrus zest. Pretty much sums up a perfect IPA. Some maltiness backs all the scents up making it very well-balanced.  Taste: Upon first sips, a perfect blend of citrus hops, grassy, earthy, malts can be tasted. Second taste is a pretty nice taste of lemon zest, orange peel and some other fruitiness that really makes the bitterness stand out even more if thats possible. Very nice, good. I really enjoy the taste and the earthy hops.  Mouthfeel: Medium carbonation, smooth finish. Somewhat dry finish. Good stuff. Well balanced.  Overall: Coming into this brew, it came highly recommended and I must say I am glad I chose this brew. Fills the palate with earth tone hops and an undertone of citrus flavors. Quite nice overall, really enjoyed this brew. I would totally try again and have already started recommended this brew to friends. Can't wait to try again.

I would like to proclaim that it possesses the perfect I.P.A. aroma! I love the racer theme bottle and pretty much everything about this beer...except for the price unfortunately.

Not overly pungent but hops are there in form of mostly orange rind to me  Really well balanced in the taste.

Racer 5 reminds me of Stone Ruination but not as sugary, and definitely more floral. Has a very similar mouth feel and aftertaste, but less filling and more balanced. For whatever reason I really do like the flowery hops, and the hop blend in Racer 5 is very well balanced. Coloring isn't the best, nor is the smell, but it is a really great tasting IPA. If you haven't yet tried it, do so asap. You won't be disappointed.

This golden, well hopped, bottle-conditioned ale demands your attention. Try the next generation of I.P.A. Racer 5...Go..Go..""  Poured from a 22 oz. bottle to a tulip. Served north of 54º Fahrenheit.  (Appearance) Pours a pale golden eggshell white head of a whipped creamy consistency over a golden amber body. There is moderate accelerated carbonation and medium flecked sediment for a subtle haze. Retention is good, lacing is thin and drooped, spotty in places. Overall it's a pretty solid-looking IPA. 4.5  (Smell) Aromas of big citrus and floral hops. Orange peel, lemon pith and lesser grapefruit forward, great values of hop aroma as well as perceivable bitterness. Malt body is pale with a very clean caramel, providing a mellow sweetness to pair. The balance is very bright, very few perceivable imperfections and alcohol is well tucked away. Potency is medium/high. It's a really fantastic smelling IPA, great big happy hop notes that are definitive for a west-coast style IPA. 4.5  (Taste) Malt profile gives a bit more notice to the flavor, with a very clean, modestly sweet caramel pinch. There's very little toasting of the grain, clean and to-the point but the sweetness comes through more in the flavor. The strength of the hops tones down a note or two in the flavor, a little less citrus brightness but a remaining big flavor, with a more refined citrus and floral balance, still lots of juicy full hop flavors. Very clean, incredibly drinkable and with a welcome humble bitterness that pairs ideally with the spot-on flavors of this IPA. Nothing is over the top here. It may not be the most in-your-face showcase of west coast hop flavor and bitterness, but this does a great job at balancing the flavors and promoting drinkability. There's no question to whether I'm going to be able to finish this bomber by myself as this is an incredibly quaffable beer. 4.5  (Mouthfeel) Texture is slick, clean and smooth with a very faintly dry finish. Carbonation adds a bit of froth and creaminess to the texture, nothing stings the tongue here. Body is medium for an India Pale Ale, just shy of medium overall. Alcohol profile is low. There may be some scoffers at Bear Republic for not going the spritely and sharp carbonation route, as it may have enhanced the citrus somewhat, but the enjoyment lies in the balance of this beer. 4  (Overall) Apart from competing west-coast IPAs this beer has some unique qualities that make it stand out. I draw attention mostly to the use of a simple, yet flavorful clean caramel malt build, a smooth, quaffable texture against other IPAs and a great balance of hop flavor and bitterness that amicably showcases the juiciness of these flavorful citrus and subtle floral hop notes. A deserving champion amongst thousands of India Pale Ale contenders, and a beer that I don't regret picking out from California. I do, in fact regret grabbing only one. 4.25  Bear Republic Brewing Company's Racer 5 India Pale Ale 4.4/5.00",Bear Republic Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,93

It initially smelled of grapefruit but as the beer warmed, it took on more of a pine smell. Pine is also the first thing I tasted followed by malty caramel. Then the bitterness took over. It totally dried out my mouth and tongue. A little too much for my liking. But overall this is a pretty solid IPA.",Bear Republic Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,93

S - Hints of tropical fruit, orange, grapefruit, and apricot. Initially hard to isolate, but presented themselves better as the beer warmed.  T - Beer initially present a piney sweet citrus and tropical fruit flavor followed by a bitter grapefruit finish. Completely masks 7% ABV. Unfortunately, sweetness dominates other flavors, which ties into mouthfeel...  M - Both initial presentation and finish are syrupy, corresponding to the dominating sweetness of the beer. After the finish is complete, mouth felt slightly sticky. Appropriately carbonated.  O - My overall opinion is greatly influenced by the tropical fruit sweetness and syrupy consistency.

610,2751,joe1510,4,"22oz Bomber  Pop from the carbonation when I cracked this beer.  Racer 5 poured a hazy orange/golden. Lots of carbonation coming up from everywhere on this one. Two finger dense eggshell head sits up top and doesn't want to budge. This is a lively beer. The head lingers throughout and leaves sticky white lacing.  Smells very good. I drank the Red Rocket last night and there was all kinds of unexpected smells. The same thing with Racer 5. The first thing that comes to mind is oatmeal. Then the hops come around. There's citrus, orange rind along with a small touch of grapefruit. Just smells really fresh and refreshing.  The taste is excellent. There's a very solid caramel malt upfront that falls back when the hops hit but stays as a nice balancing point throughout. The hops come in as a refreshing and crisp citrus bite. This is some good stuff.  The mouthfeel is close to perfect. Medium bodied with a really nice carbonation that pushes through and tickles the tongue.  I could easily drink these all night long and I would if I would have bought more than just one of these bombers.  Racer 5 is an excellent IPA. I'm very impressed. This beer is so smooth and easy to drink. It hides the alcohol so well you can't even tell it's there. One of my new favorite IPAs.

On to taste, this is a real hop bomb IPA. A strong malt backbone fueling the 7% abv but the hops really dominate this brew.

Thin white head upon pouring which died back to a very thin skin across the top. Delicate strands and islands of lacing noted.  Smell: Not a strong smelling beer at first, but with a good swirl I got a perfect citrus smell (nice blend of grapefruit, orange, and lemon) and as the foam died back I got some pine and another nice hit, stronger, of grapefruit.  Taste: Citrus grapefruit and orange at first, but not super tart, then a quick malt middle (very quick - couldn't pick out any distinct malt flavors) and then a citrus and piney bitter finish. A hoppy beer, but not excessively bitter. The citrus hop flavors slowly build up over time in the mouth, lingering longer and longer with each sip, but not becoming too much.  Mouthfeel: Light carbonation, but very smooth and slick. Some stickiness to the teeth but not a lot.  Overall / Drinkability: Definitely a good beer, but I wonder if this one sat on the shelf too long and some of the hop aroma and taste has been lost based upon other reviews I've read about this beer. A solid AIPA, but not as flavorful as I thought it would be. Very balanced though, with distinct hop flavors.

610,2751,BradtheGreat7,4.34,"12 oz brown bottle with racing inspired Bear Republic labeling. I really dig this brewery's logo. Unique and eye candy. Poured into a standard American pint glass  A - golden colored amber or one could say copper, but this is a darker golden ale for me. Head wasn't as big as some ipa's I've had but it did have some fluff to it and settled into a nice ring of lace with pretty good stickiness.  S - solid aroma. Not as big on the hops as typical west coast style ipa's are, but the overall aroma has some hoppiness to it. Citrus, grapefruit, some pine and somewhat floral hop aromas. A caramel and lighter malt background makes this aroma pleasing to take in. The pine really takes control after a few whiffs but its soft and refreshing to the nose.  T - man, is this a good flavor or what? Pine to start things off with hints of citrus and grapefruit flowing over the mouth nicely. Some caramel malt holds everything in place and really keeps the bitterness in check. Sure, it has some awesome mouth puckering hops but the bitterness never really grabs you. I love a well balanced ipa that still get its big flavor across without busting balls. The hop spice and bitterness gets a bit more pronounced in the final stage and supports the semi dry finish. This flavor is so classic and simple yet done to perfection.  M - medium bodied and smooth texture. It may be a touch on the thin side for an ipa of this style, but surprisingly does an excellent job of providing a good texture and an even better job of coating the entire feel. This is one of the easiest going ipa's you'll ever have.  O - throughout this experience I was shocked at just how laid back and simple Bear Republic kept this though its so good I never became bored with its perfect balance and simple flavors. It has the hoppiness and bitterness to allow yourself to take in a real world class American ipa while letting you take big, flavorable drinks.

Easily drinkable for those with an interest in hops, the hop-derived citrus and bitterness pairs well with the yeast-produced fruity esters and residual sweetness and breadiness from the malts. An easy go-to IPA that many others have emulated.  Pours a 1cm tall mass of fairly clean, white foam, made up of small and medium-sized bubbles, which has average retention of about one minute. The head falls to a thin ring around the glass and a light haze of residue atop the body. Lacing is good, The body of the beer is a fairly bright orange color with copper undertones, light bringing out very bright, orange-yellow hues in the primarily transparent (30-40% opacity) body. Carbonation is visible streaming up from the center of the glass.  Aroma is of substantial citurs note, primarily grapefruit, but also slight orange, and a noticeable sweetness contributed by the malts. Modest peppery character with a light bready component fill out the backside of the hoppy citrus scents. Solid for an IPA.  Front of palate is of pale malt and caramel malt sweetness with notes of grapefruit juice and hints of pine resin. Mid-palate is of substantial hop bitterness and spiciness with balancing fruity esters in the way of grapefruit and orange, with moderating caramel malt and slight breadiness from the pale malt and yeast. Back of palate is of hop bitterness, black pepper, slight ethanol, modest grapefruit and orange. Aftertaste is of substantial bitterness with a lingering grapefruit and pine bite with a hint of caramel malt.  Beer is medium-bodied with medium-low levels of carbonation, leading to a gently foamy, smooth mouthfeel. Closes dry, with little stickiness remaining on the palate.",Bear Republic Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,93

Very unique and enticing.  T- Flavor follows suit with more citrusy sharpness and juicy grapefruit notes. The bitterness has a very tangy attack which sort of complements the somewhat high alcohol presence. Decent malt backbone provides just the right amount of sweetness to back up the brightness of the hops.  M- Big bites of hops all the way through, actually more stinging but in a great way.

O: A delicious representation of this style. Reminds me a lot of a double IPA, perhaps due to its weight in body and taste and alcohol, but its not quite there at a double. Would go well with spicy food, or enjoyed as I am on a hot day in Kunming China.",Bear Republic Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,93

T: Follows the nose, but perhaps more balance of pine and citrus. Finishes with plenty of bitterness, subtly lingers on the palate.

610,2751,bambam2517,3.6,"12 oz. bottle poured into a pint glass after dinner, served at 45F.  A - Flat golden-blonde pour leaves almost nothing up top, looks lethargic and watery honestly. Lots of snowy unfiltered goodness though.  S - Mostly floral, some caramel sugar, a little hop pineyness.  T -Sweet honey citrus backed up by some hop bitterness.  M - Not at all unpleasant but pretty unremarkable. It just one of those.  O - Dialed back in every respect from my experiences in IPAs, I think that is exactly against the grain of West Coast IPAs in general. Not a fan.

610,2751,socon67,4.14,"A - Orange pour with a tan foam head that retained. Some csrbonation is visibile. Sticky lacing runs down the glass.  S - Scents of tangerine and mango plus a floral blend of hops. There is a slight smell of pine cones.  T - A rather complex IPA with a clean taste. Done very traditional in the ""west coast"" style with strong notes of citrus fruits and a sharp bitterness that finishes much smoother than you'd think. Mellow hop resin and gentle grain notes.  M - Balance is noce on this. Easy finish and very drinkable. Tartness and bitter notes to do overwhelm the palate and transition nicely.  O - Really classic take on the style and hard ot go wrong with one. I paired this with a peppery griled steak and it enhanced the experience.",Bear Republic Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,93
610,2751,snaotheus,4.08,"22oz bottle poured into a large mug. One of those beers that I've had many times, but never reviewed. The fact that I've had it many times says more about it than my review will.  Pours golden with an orange tinge, respectable pale head, clear, fair amount of carbonation. Smell is powerful, sweet and floral, smellable from arm's reach. Honey and citrus.  Taste is refreshing, not overpowering in any given direction. Some pine bitterness. More of the honeysuckle.  Mouthfeel is slightly dry, smooth. Overall, this is a quite good beer, which should only be turned down if there's an excellent option.",Bear Republic Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,93
610,2751,earthling,4.71,"Racer 5 must be consumed as fresh as possible. It's a classic dry-hopped California IPA with loads of citrus hop aroma. It has a strong bitterness, though it's well balanced with a pretty heavy malt. It's at hoppier end of IPAs, though it isn't going to blow your head off. A great regular drinker.",Bear Republic Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,93
610,2751,Benish,4.1,"Poured into snifter glass. It presented a light amber color with a quarter inch thick white head. Did not dissipate quickly. Moderate lacings around the glass.  Aroma: It smelled primarily pine and mango immediately after pouring. I covered the glass and just swirled lightly. The smell of pine greatly amplified! Also some notes of pineapple.  Taste: Tangy at first, I tasted pine, citrus, orange rind, and some subtle spiciness. It started out sweet and finished with some bitterness. This beer was not overpowering and is very easy drinking. While the beer start to reach room temperature (I can't drink a bomber that fast) it became a bit more mellow and maybe tad bit lighter on the flavor. Best to drink chilled.  Overall a great beer. I think I had my expectations a little too high considering the ratings it received on BA. However I'm glad to try this. Each IPA is often different in its own way, just like this one is different. This is worth trying BUT if it's not distributed to your state, there are plenty of other IPA's just as good if not better. If you do have one, pop open the bottle, relax, and enjoy!",Bear Republic Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,93
610,2751,RickS95,4.22,"22 ounce bomber  A bit lighter than I expected and clearer than I thought it would be. Apricot colored pour with a smallish head. Still enough goodness that light doesn't shine right through, but lacking in head. Slight, thin lace.  Very pleasant West Coast smell. Lots of citrus, peach and pineapple, and a bit of pine. Fairly classic for the style.  Taste follows the lead of the smell with peach, pineapple and pine having a party. A biscuit backdrop.  A quick shot of sweet followed by acidic citrus and bitter hops. Medium bodied, the fairly moderate alcohol is muted by everything else going on. A bitter, citric, oily finish.  I'm really happy with this. We don't get Bear Republic anywhere near home and this didn't disappoint my excitement. An easy drinker for the style, good taste and nice alcohol.

610,2751,twiggamortis420,4.17,"22 oz bomber pours a hazed gold color with a stubborn white head that sticks around for a long while and leaves sheets of lace. I cant believe I have not reviewed this one before.  Nose is piney hops and bready, crackery malt. More of an 'old school' hop aroma than the newer, tropical IPAs. Still smells like a beer that can stand the test of time.  Ohhh, yea...thats nice. This beer never fails to impress. Soft malts are so understated and just honeyed graham cracker deliciousness. Hops have a modest bitterness but plenty of leafy-pine hoppiness. BR did this one up right when they designed this recipe. Solid IPA that is drinkable by the gallon.",Bear Republic Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,93
610,2751,tectactoe,4.3,"This one has eluded me for a long time, mainly because I couldn't find a fresh bottle. Finally got one last week, looking forward to finally trying this one. Pours almost a completely opaque, bright amber and light copper color. Big eggshell head builds up nice and foamy-like, leaving lots of chunky lace on the glass nearly all the way down. Awesome looking IPA.  The nose is quiet at first, but I believe I served this one to myself a little too cold. Once it warmed up, the aroma came out strong; big-time citric hops immediately send your senses into a frenzy. Plentiful grapefruit and dense orange peel, thick layers of pine needles, with a light perfume-like characteristic that lingers about. The citrus is sweet, mildly bitter, and potent; the hops are humongous in character - sticky, oily, and brash... this is one goddamn wet and hoppy IPA. Not quite reaching ""dank"" status, but the piney hops have a largely resinous aroma.  Malt? Not too much. It's certainly underplayed on the nose, but that's to be expected. I take one sip and I'm strapped in for the hop-coaster. Big, wet, pine-encrusted hops glide across my palate and smack my taste buds - powerful and bitter without being too harsh or abrasive. Large, white-pepper sprinkled grapefruit peels and other various citrus rinds coat every corner of my mouth. Couple that with the thick and dense resins and hop oils, you've got yourself a sticky-delicious IPA.  Lots of pine in the finish with a nudge of bitterness that grazes the palate without completely raping it. It's actually quite mellow, really, and becomes even more mellow with time. Warming also brings out a large floral and perfume character that wasn't as evident before. Just like with many other IPAs, the malts coming in much more handy in the flavor than the aroma - biscuity and bready, the malts here perform a very nice balancing act with the aggressive hop profile, something I love to see. Fresh aftertaste with pines, oils, bread, and orange peels. The mouth feel is slick, clean, snappy, and lively; medium bodied with plenty of carbonation.  Wow, I can't believe this stuff went under my nose for such a long time, it really is a delicious IPA. Very good perception of extreme hoppiness while maintaining a great balance with the malt that keeps this beer drinkable as all hell. Goes down like a champ - and it helps that the 7% ABV goes primarily unnoticed. Delicious stuff, no joke.",Bear Republic Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,93

610,2751,Darkmagus82,4.2,"Poured from bottle into a snifter glass  Appearance – The beer pours a medium golden amber color with a mall white head. The head has a decent level of retention, fading over time to leave a nice level of lace on the sides of the glass.  Smell – The aroma of the brew is good with a nice mix of caramel malt and some lighter sweet fruit aromas. Mixed with these are some smells of a resinous pine and citrus hop giving it a west coast IPA nose.  Taste – The taste begins with flavors of some tropical fruits mixed with a caramel malt and bready backbone. As the flavors advance, the tongue is initially meet with some flavors of a grapefruit hop nature. These hit fairly strong and abruptly giving a hopped citrusy taste to the brew even with the sweeter fruit and malty flavors. With the advent of a sudden resinous pine hop taste and a bit of earthy hop also coming to the tongue later in the taste, when all is said and done a bitter hopped up flavor is left to linger on the tongue.  Mouthfeel- The body of the beer is smooth and creamy with a carbonation level that is on the higher side. The medium body baths the tongue in all the hop and malt flavors really allowing them to be sensed by the taste buds. The carbonation level being slightly high adds a good exciting tingling feel to counterbalance some of the bitter that the hop leaves, making for a rather enjoyable feel overall.  Overall – This was a nice smooth but yet still well hoped brew. A good go to.",Bear Republic Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,93
610,2751,tjsdomer2,4.06,"Appearance: Sudsy soapy foam. Golden in color. Very nice lacing and foam.  Smell: Floral soap...a bit too soapy, but still enjoyable.  Taste/Mouthfeel: Medicinal hops and chamomile. A very subdued DIPA flavor, but quite enjoyable. Goes down clean like a lager, making this easy to drink.  Overall Drinkability: One of the strangest DIPAs I've ever had, but I look forward to having it again.",Bear Republic Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,93

Looks slightly syrupy and not a lot of effervescence. Thin film of very fine bubbles floating in the middle of the glass. Pretty color and love to see that sediment in there.  Nose has a cidery-apple aroma. Also peaches and apricot. Smell some sweetness as well as the hops, but I get more fruit. Flavor is very forward, malty, hoppy, nice bracing from the alcohol, and a clean finish. Mouthfeel is nice, syrupy, big but focused. Nice!  Overall, this beer is friggin' killer. Nice and balanced but a nice edge from the hops. Well done.",Bear Republic Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,93
610,2751,trxxpaxxs,4.25,"A: Pours a nice translucent light gold with one full finger of pure white head. The foam settles quickly, leaving a ring of bubbles along the edges of the glass. Good lacing as it drinks.  S: The nose is pine with a good malty backbone. Nothing too crazy going on here. It's a bit sweet but has tons of pine scents.  T: It starts out light and refreshing with a great balance of sweet and bitter. It's pretty one dimensional from start to finish. Just a well balanced IPA. In the finish, the sweetness fades and the hoppy bitters take hold of the palate. Solid.  M: Medium bodied beer. It's a well balanced, well carbonated beer that hits the palate, settles, and moves off nicely. Nothing too sticky or coating about it. Nice piney hops remain after the beer is gone.  O: Good beer. Like I have said many times before, it's well balanced. The hops aren't over the top, the malt doesn't make it too sweet. It's just right. This would be a good entry point into the IPA style. Well done.",Bear Republic Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,93

Light with some nice floral notes and some light citrus hops coming through. There is some light malts and hint of caramel but from the most part the beer smells quite fresh and light with lemongrass right at the finish.  Pine hops and citrus with only a slight bit of bitterness that is nowhere near the amount I was expecting but makes the beer very easy to drink. There is some caramel malts, a touch of sweetness and the lemongrass that featured towards the end of the smell. There is some orange and a moderate bitter finish.  Light medium beer with a light mouthfeel and smooth, citrus infused sip and nice bitterness levels without being overdone. Carbonation is mild to medium with no evidence of alcohol showing.  Great but not quite what I had imagined it to be but not one that disappointed anyway.

It was easy going down but got harsher as it warmed.  O: Not a bad IPA, but I would like to try it in a bottle. It came across as a very light IPA.

610,2751,Hendry,4.19,"Racer 5 IPA offers a reasonably good nose, with just a faint whiff of trpoical fruit, and pours relatively clean with a small white head that doesn't hang out too long. The flavors are also clean and enjoyable offering your palate a moderate amount of hop goodness,but despite the the hype of the mix of hops utilized, the overall taste is one dimensional and not outstanding. Clean comes to mind, but not an overly bitter aftertaste that one gets from a lip smacking tropical fruit bomb. My expectations are high for a $14 six pack, and Racer 5 is just another West coast IPA letdown with exceptional ratings: far too bland and not enough lingering bitterness.  For an extra few bucks, the slightly sharper tasting Ballast Point Scuplin IPA comes closer to that degree of excellence so hard to find in the six pack format. On the other hand, for a few dollars less,Lagunitas Sucks offers alot more bang for the buck and a more interesting flavor.  The West Coast continues shipping a staggering array of brand names and styles to the farthest reaches of the East Coast, and most meet the level of mediocre or slightly better.  Not sure why these Bear Republic offerings are getting such excellent ratings for a relatively run of the mill IPA from the West Coast. You may want to try the bomber before shelling out for another pricey six pack.  Final Note: it may help selling the initial six pack by writing on the Racer 5 label ""bigger is better"" in terms of hoppiness, but they don't back that claim up especially when comparing it to other IPAs in the price range. They are blowing their horn about awards this beer won 4 years ago: lots of great brands have surfaced since that time.",Bear Republic Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,93
610,2751,Jugs_McGhee,3.82,"7% ABV confirmed. Bottled 03/21/13. 12 fl oz brown glass bottle with standard branded silver pressure cap served into a conical Samuel Smith's pint glass in Los Angeles, California. Reviewed live. Expectations are high; I've had some great beers from this brewery before, and this has a great reputation - plus it's fresh.  Served cold, straight from the fridge. Side-poured with standard vigor as no carbonation issues are anticipated.  A: Pours a two finger vibrant beige colour head of nice cream, nice thickness, and good (~5 minute) retention for the fairly high ABV. Body colour is a vibrant clear translucent pale copper. No yeast particles are visible. No bubble show. About what I'd expect from a good beer in the style, though the colour could be fuller and more vibrant. Light even lacing as the head recedes. Excited to try this. No overt flaws in the appearance.  Sm: Lovely varied floral hop notes. Hop oil. Nectary hops. Pale malts. Grassy character. Light pine. The oily hop character (Columbus) is dominant - just what I want from a good IPA. Well hopped and balanced. Pleasant, fresh, appealing. This is exactly what an IPA should smell like. A mild to moderate strength aroma. Very inviting. No yeast character or alcohol is detectable.  T: Great stuff. Oily hop notes mix well with lighter nectary hop notes and moderate floral hop character. The body is simple flavorful pale malts, lending it a refreshing taste. It lacks the citrusy gush I want it to have, but it's well constructed and damn well balanced across the board, with hardly any hop bitterness coming through at all. What little hop bitterness there is comes through just a bit on the climax and in the third act; it's not perfect balance but it's impressive. No yeast character comes through, nor does any alcohol. Lightly grassy, highlighting the pale malts. Love the hop choices here - especially columbus. I'd like to see what amarillo does to the flavour profile. Beautifully balanced, beautifully executed. A tasty IPA with good depth of flavour, complexity, and subtlety. This is how you brew an IPA.  Mf: Soft, smooth, oily, a bit nectary, and wet. Refreshing. Lightly crisp. Feels custom-tailored to the flavour profile. Perfect carbonation. Very well executed, evoking care and effort.  Dr: Damn drinkable. I'll definitely be getting more of this and will happily buy it by the six pack. If I bought beer I'd already tried on a regular basis, this would be right up there - or probably above - Lagunitas as my IPA mainstay. Up there with Sculpin in terms of quality and availability. Bravo, Bear Republic. I'm beating myself up over waiting so long to review it. This is how an IPA ought to be: balanced and flavorful, with subtlety and complexity. Very well done.  B+ / VERY GOOD  *** 08/24/16 2nd impression:  Racer 5 is a go-to IPA of mine, a stellar brew that bests others in its category.  Fruity without venturing too deep into tropical territory. Floral, balanced, and slightly resinous. Slightly oily hops.  Refreshing and approachable.  B+  *** 07/14/19 first time trying it from a CAN:  Assertively citrusy and floral, with a crisp hop bite and high hop pungency. Showcases the shit out of Columbus hops better than probably any other IPA I've tried (including single hop Columbus IPAs). Dips a bit into Centennial's pine towards the finish, but doesn't commit to it as much as other top tier Centennial hopped IPAs (Bells' Two Hearted certainly comes to mind). Pink grapefruit, nice floral notes from Cascade/Supercascade - though the oiliness I find in Cascade-centric beers like Sierra Nevada's Pale Ale is absent.  A classic IPA with an undeniably effective C-hop profile. I do prefer it from the bottle (or maybe Total Wine's lack of refrigeration is what is diminishing this can for me), but that's picking a nit - this is one of the all-time greats in the IPA category.  B / GOOD  *** 05/10/22 can:  Not quite as good as I remembered it, but it's been worse ever since they abandoned the 6x12 bottle format by my estimation...can't quite put my finger on it. I'm glad they're back to 6x12 oz after trying to foist 22oz bombers and 4x16 cans on consumers, but damage seems to have been done in the interim,  B- / WORTHY",Bear Republic Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,93

There are some minor bubbles visible, but not much in the way of head; a thin white, slightly shiny head devolves quickly. A touch of lace is left behind.  S-The smell is a balanced mixture of buttery, toasted malts and fruity, lightly dank hops. The hops are sweet and orange flavored, but a little underwhelming. A slight hoppy oiliness comes out as the beer warms up to room temperature.  T-The taste, like the smell, is uh (read: uninspiring), balanced and there is more malt here than I would've expected. The hops are citrusy rather than pine-oily-dank, but there is a mild, peppery, spice in the finish. The flavors are a touch coarse.  M-The feel is creamy for the style with mild, fine carbonation and a medium body.  O-This brew hits the meh button for me. It wasn't unpleasant, but I expect an IPA with 7% ABV to provide a little more flavor firepower than this.

Thin ring of wispy lacing. Second pour yields about two fingers of thin bubbly off-white head, and tons of sediment!  S - Oranges. Grapefruit. Lemongrass. Pine needles. Slight toasty malts. Has a bitter hop presence, but it is definitely not overly dominant. Smells like a well-balanced beer so far.  T - Bitter hop profile, but again, not overly dominant, which is pretty amazing considering the four different hops that were put into this thing. Bit of spicy hop bitterness, but also a smooth clean lemon / green apple zest. Might seem a bit tame for those of us who like extreme amounts of hops, but I find this beer to be well balanced. Fruity sweetness, with just a tad of alcohol presence. Lingering sweetness of pear, green apple, mango.  M - Sweet, sugary, and resinous. Smooth and clean.  Overall, remarkably well-balanced and hides it's high 7.00% abv well for an IPA. Might not satisfy those overly intense hopheads, and it might not be breaking any spectacular new ground, but it is a worthy addition to the realm of IPA's.

610,2751,Beerandboards,4.07,"Bomber into a pint glass  A - somewhat foggy translucent light copper color. Thick dense white head, even an aggressive pour produces only an inch or so of head. Nice.  S - light profile of citrus. Lemon and grapefruit. Some light malty notes.  T - grapefruit bomb. Grapefruit peel, orange peel, pithy citrus. Light malty backbone. Smooth finish. Very solid.  M - nice, creamy, super easy drinking.  O - good IPA. The grapefruit profile is not quite my thing, almost too mild of a profile for the overriding bitterness if the grapefruit. I would definitely order this again though.",Bear Republic Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,93
610,2751,Cobrito,2.73,"A popular but in my mind mediocre West Coast IPA. In some cases, like with BR's Hop Rod Rye, balanced is good in that the ingredients all contribute to a nice, complex brew. In Racer 5's case, it has been balanced into insipidness. Not nearly enough hop complexity for hop-heads, and there is an odd brackish taste at the front end of the palate as well. Very disappointing.",Bear Republic Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,93
610,2751,GuzzLah,3.79,"A - pours a clear, gold with a short white head and leaves a little lace. No bubbles.  S - pine, resinous, citrus hops. Soft pale malt. The yeast is neutral.  T - is like the aroma. Could be a palate wrecker with the hops they used, but they managed to make a potentially rough set of hops behave and play well together. The absence of caramel is appreciated in this brew.  M - low-medium body and carbonation. Medium bitterness for the style with a medium sustain and just enough sweetness to keep the bitterness in check.  O - this is a nice example of a restrained West Coast IPA. I'd be happy to drink it again.",Bear Republic Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,93
610,2751,LCB_Hostage,4.58,"Poured from a bottle into a pint glass (many, many times over the years)  A: Deep sunny orange, with a moderate, dense white head. Nice lacing that lasts the life of the beer and beyond.  S: I pop the cap and hold the bottle up to my nose and it makes me smile. A crisp, artful blend of citrus and piney hops predominate with yeasty undertones. This is what beer should smell like.  T: As with the aroma, Bear Republic has found an almost perfect blend of hops for my palate. There's enough malt and alcohol in the mix to make it ""beery"" but the hops hit your tongue and leave a lasting impression without an overly bitter aftertaste .  M: Crisp and refreshing with enough carbonation to wake up the tongue and disperse the flavors.  O: Needless to say, this is one of my favorite, go-to beers and has been since my first bottle. A solid hop punch, but balanced enough not to kill the palate. I can't say there aren't better IPAs out there, because I haven't had the pleasure of trying them all. But given the relatively modest price and widespread availability, this is a beer that will always be represented in my fridge.",Bear Republic Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,93
610,2751,flydudehsv,4.93,"Real nice IPA. Not the hoppiest, but it has some zip. Nice sweet malt in the background but really smooth for the 7% ABV. Initial aroma is pine forest. Orange amber color with a moderate off white head. Flavor starts fruity (apricot, orange) turning light grapefruit bitter and finishing kinda dry and orange rind bitter. Medium body, smooth with moderate carbonation.",Bear Republic Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,93

Taste is initially slightly metallic biscuity then the pleasant, rich bitterness comes in.  Mouthfeel is perhaps slightly thin, but very drinkable. Not a creamy ipa, but one you drink faster and faster searching for satiation.  This really is a very good beer. I was nervous about its freshness, but however old it is, it is good.",Bear Republic Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,93
610,2751,GreesyFizeek,3.98,"This is still fairly fairly hoppy, with a big resinous punch, and a solid malt backbone. It's quite crisp, and very drinkable.

610,2751,Moose90,4.06,"Bottled – 110512 Tasted – 030313  A – Pours a nice deep orange, with a large fluffy off white head. Lacing is truly great on this one.  S – Lots of citrus, some unique orange and bitter lime notes. Smells good, but nothing too complex.  T – Starts bitter, and leads to resinous and piney hop notes. Sweet orange shows on the finish.  M – Light-to-medium carbonation. Goes down very smooth and is quite refreshing. Nice.  O – Good beer here. Nice and hoppy with nice orange notes. Not overly sweet and that is appreciated. A nice balance of hops and malt. This is a great day in, day out, IPA.",Bear Republic Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,93
610,2751,rickyleepotts,4.34,"I have had this beer before, and I LOVE the flavor profile. When standing at Total Wine & More, I tell customers asking for a ""good IPA"" that Racer 5 is a ""good daily drinking IPA"". It is also cheap. It has a big ABV for the price, and is one of the flavors you just can't get enough of. Sheryl doesn't like hoppy beers, but I LOVE them. The tasting notes said, ""leaves you burping hops."" I hope so! Nothing beats a good, hoppy beer. Funny story, our beer calendar (that features a different beer every day) is showing the Firestone Walker Union Jack IPA. That beer is in the fridge, too. I wasn't prepared to drink two bottles today, but since that is the beer on the calendar, I will consider that a sign! So look for another IPA coming up next. Please note that I have had the Firestone Walker IPA, and while it is a good offering, the Racer 5 is better. But I will let you decide as you read these reviews!  (Also, it bothers me I don't know where the name Racer 5 came from. I am sure with a little Google search, I could figure it out. But I like not knowing. Keeps things mysterious and interesting!)  In the Glass: I could smell this as I was pouring it. Good thing I am in the mood for some hops! In the glass, if you didn't know better, you would think it was a wheat beer. It looks like a Blue Moon sitting there.Very little lace to speak of, but a nice frothy white head. Excited to stick my nose in there.  Nose: Hops. That is all. Hops. Imagine an orange and a hop were hugging… they made babies and that is what this beer smells like. Not sure that makes sense, but the hop aroma is very citrus forward. It has a nice, fruity aroma that begs to be consumed. Fine. I will drink it!  Flavor: Those same hops that you were smelling, well now you are drinking them. It is not as much floral as you might expect from the aroma, but it provides a very nice filling flavor. The entire tongue is covered with flavor and the hops hit the front then rush to the back of the tongue for a nice drying flavor. The swallow is smooth, and the back of the throat is then covered in that same drying sensation that you got on the palate. You would never know this was 7% ABV. If I had a 6 pack, I would sit here and drink them all! This is a great IPA, and a good IPA for someone to try that isn't a fan of big hoppy beers. If someone likes pale ales, but wants to try an IPA, suggest this. It's a good introduction to the style.  Mouthfeel: It's smooth, low carbonation, and a nice drying finish. (The burp is nice, too. It brings those dry notes back to the center of the palate and leave you craving another drink.) I tried to swish this around in my mouth to get some more bubbles going, but it just opened up the flavor of the hops. I might even use the word creamy to explain what this feels like on my tongue.  Aftertaste: You might expect a lot of hops, but there isn't much going on here. What hops are there are weak, and the dryness that was created toward the end of the swallow is sticking around, but is fading fast. It's not a beer that I would drink for the aftertaste, and I bet would pair well with a nice salad or grilled chicken dish. Guess I will have to pair this with dinner now!  I am a big fan of this beer, and every time I drink it becomes more and more enjoyable. Funny, I hadn't checked into this beer on Untappd. Weird. I know I have had this beer since creating an Untappd account. Oh well, it has been tracked now! If you like a nice citrus forward IPA, this beer is for you!  Racer 5 - The bottle says: ""Racer 5 is an aggressive styled India Pale Ale. Handmade from a brewery whose motto is ""Bigger is Better"". This golden, well-hopped ale demands your attention. Try the next generation of I.P.A. Racer 5… Go… Go…""",Bear Republic Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,93
610,2751,rringler,4.05,"Appearance: Dark/golden straw, with some particulates in suspension. About a finger of head that sticks around/laces nicely.  Smell: Starts malty (though not as strong as some IPAs) but then hints floral hops. Malt is not as roasted/buttery/carmely as others.  Taste: A bit more malty than some IPAs. Taste is good, if a bit sweet. Finishes with hops, but this beer does not emphasize hops like some others.  Mouth: Medium/Medium- oily, though with a bit more/better carbonation than some other IPAs. Pretty close to what I think is ideal for an IPA.  Overall: A nice IPA, skewed by living on the west coast. This is a nice, more balance IPA that probably appeals to a larger audience (though I admit the hops in any IPA are going to turn some people off.) That said, those of us on the west coast like to turn the hops up to 11, and in that regard this beer may seem as lacking. I'm sure it's a matter of preference, but I think I may have developed a Pavlovian response to my hops.",Bear Republic Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,93

A - Pours a clear golden color, big fluffy white head that receded slowly to a thin layer, sporadic lacing.  S - Big citrus and pine aromas, also a hint of booze. Notes of orange sweetness also present. Mostly a bouquet of hops, but not much malt presence.  T - Lots of bitter, piney, and citrusy hops, the bitterness definitely comes through in the finish.  M - light carbonation, full bodied, and quite resinous and sticky especially as it warms.  O - I like this beer, it is a very hop forward example of an IPA with no set backs in my opinion. I personally would enjoy it more if it had a little more malt sweetness and complexity somewhere in the taste to balance out the hop bitterness.",Bear Republic Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,93
610,2751,JohnFatAss,4.44,"I think I found my new favorite IPA.  Racer 5 is a golden orange color. Has a nice white head that left some delicate lacing on my glass.  It has a very pleasant citrus aroma.  Hops upfront, but they are not too harsh. This beer is extremely drinkable. You can just slug this down even though it is full bodied and full of flavor.  The mouthfeel is just crazy good. It has the soft mouthfeel of an ale, the hop bitterness is there, but not over done. There is some sweetness and malts in the background but it is the hops take center stage.  A most excellent beer.",Bear Republic Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,93
610,2751,Mongrel,4.03,"A classic, obviously, but I'm new to BA and felt I needed to review Racer 5 as it was formative in my early appreciation of IPAs and craft brews in general.  Pretty, pale gold appearance. A finger of soft head and lasting lace.  Immediate whiff of citrus (orange and lemon), which carries through on the taste. Everything you would expect from a west coast IPA, but what I think separates this one is the light and refreshing body and soft mouthfeel.  Smooth hop profile – bitter and clearly abundant in hops, but restrained. A bit of booze comes through and I've heard it goes well with good vodka, which makes sense. Always want to go back for more.",Bear Republic Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,93
610,2751,denver10,3.74,"Pours a firey orange golden with prickly white head and some lacing. Aroma is solid and enjoyable but not great and can get lost in the forest of great aromatic IPA aromas; juicy orange, its rind, doughy bread, and some grass. Flavor offers some nice sweet and juicy orange and its rind, some doughy bread, and a touch of some florals....so similar to aroma but a bit more filled out. A medium bodied, somewhat creamy, active mouthfeel. Overall, a very nice IPA. I dig it.",Bear Republic Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,93

610,2751,Brian14608,4.54,"I guess I love the west coast IPA's where there is a blast of citrus and piney tones. The big bubble head was one to two finger depending on the pour. The lacing was like a steam of clinger-ons without rings. But whoa, the fragrance is my kind of IPA whereas the blast is complex and delightful grapefruit and piney resins. The taste is equally good.

I could literally smell the hops radiating out of the bottle before I even popped the cap. Poured a nice goldenrod, somewhat cloudy, with a very small white head. Citrus, floral, and piney aromas really come through the nose, and are reflected in the taste, along with some subtle lemon and passionfruit. A nice west-coast style IPA that delivers complex bitterness, but is also nicely balanced by a nutty malt character that lends a fairly sweet caramel finish.",Bear Republic Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,93

Has a very strong malt backbone like other good IPA's. Mainly crystal malt and maybe wheat or two row barley. Dry bitter finish.  M: Medium-light to Medium body, with moderate carbonation. Bitter, with little to none alcohol ethers.  O: Great and competitive IPA. My go to 6 pack for sure. If I cant decide on something at the distributor in 10 minutes, I'll always walk out with this.

Slightly bitter finish that lingers, but the good kind of lingering around. Kinda like Jay and Silent Bob hanging around front of a liquor store lingering.

The aroma is rather interesting, bringing notes of sweet honey up front, followed by some grapefruit and lemon zest. There's plenty of caramel malt with some spicy, piney hops on the back. Extremely floral throughout.  The flavor is definitely malt-forward, with honey covered biscuits and caramel leading the way before a wave of citrus; namely tangerines and grapefruit. Finishes floral, piney, and spicy. Sweet, but balanced.  The feel is medium bodied with pretty good carbonation. Dry and smooth, yet effervescent.  Overall, this is a great west coast IPA.

Firm yeasty component is blanketed in hops. A citrus tinged light tropical fruit aroma as well. A dry graininess with a touch of sourness. Taste follows the nose. Light pale ale flavors are wrapped in a dry hoppiness. Pale malt and yeasty light bread. Dry grains and a faint orange flavor. Bit of biscuit. Dry hoppiness is tinged with both earth and citrus.

610,2751,eporter66,3.73,"12oz Bottle into Pint Glass  A - Hazy Golden/Orange with thick foamy 1 finger head. Good lacing down the glass  S - Piney hops with a nice malt sweetness and some citrus  T - This is where the surprise comes, lots of rave reviews about this beer, I am a bit disappointed by the taste. Hops are certainly upfront, but that sweet citrus smell does not translate to the taste. A faint flavor of the alcohol hits, and more bitter hops bite and citrus at the end. As usual, as the beer warms the sweetness comes through, but still not what I would expect. I enjoy the bitterness of this beer, just would like more citrus  M - Really smooth carbonation, one of my favorite qualitites about this beer.  O - This beer gets a very high rating, but taste is what matters most, and I just dont get that nice citrus flavor I have come to enjoy from the west coast IPA's. Certainly has a lot of hop character, good bitterness, but without the citrus and malt, there is not much in the way of balance. Very drinkable for the 7% ABV, I dont usually go much beyond 7%, as I dont care for the alcohol to take over, I like it hidden in the beer.",Bear Republic Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,93
610,2751,Braz,4.45,"Pours a clear pale gold color similar to adjucnt lagers. Nice fluffy pure white head. Aromatics are citrusy, orange, cedar and grass. Taste has excellent balance between sweet and bitter. It is dry and finishes with some nice spice notes, black peppery. Aftertaste is bitter and lingers a bit. Very good IPA. I have yet to have anything disapointing from this brewery.",Bear Republic Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,93

Bottle conditioning is obvious with yeast particles floating around, great looking beer!  S: Citrus like hop aroma and a sweet maltiness that is very pleasant. Smeels great, you just know its going to be a great tasting beer.  T: Bitterness is balanced very well with the sweet maltiness. Very nice hoppiness, citrus like, opposed to pine like or soapy like some say. Carbonation is just right and very refreshing.  M: A bit dry with a bitter aftertaste, as expected. Malt character is apparent and lingers with some citrus notes.  O: Great example of what comes out of California. Bear republic knows whats up. This is a balanced IPA, maybe a bit on the maltier side but nonetheless a must have.

S- Hops, and malt...Duh!! Very nice nose on this beer. Smells very balanced. Has a strong hop smell some mint, pine and citrus jump out. Smells very appealing.  T- Beer tastes of bread, with a small amount of citrus. This beer is a small amount of alcohol that is hidden very well.  M- Medium body beer with a nice dry finish.

S: Sweet floral and citrus hops along with some faint bread.  T: I taste the hops, but not really floral or citrus like the smell would lead you to believe. Very light malt flavor in the end. Nicely balanced and not overpowering. The alcohol is well hidden.  M: Mouthfeel is smooth and medium bodied with light to moderate carbonation. Very easy to drink.  O: Very impressive West Coast IPA. Hoppy enough for the hopheads to be happy, but smooth and balanced enough for anyone to enjoy. Well done Bear Republic!",Bear Republic Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,93

S: Flowers, pine, and citrus. Some sugary, caramel sweetness and breadiness brings the the aromas together nicely.  T: Round with initial notes of bread and cane sugar followed by bright, fresh pine, citrus and a hint of pineapple juice. Herbal spice finish tops off the palate. Strong but balanced palate with some nice tropical notes which really adds a nice touch.  M: Medium bodied with good linger and carbonation. Surprisingly smooth and easy to drink.  O: A standout west coast IPA which I feel like is the NorCal rival to Stone's IPA.

610,2751,StonedTrippin,4.1,"one of those ipas that you just keep on buying, this has everything. it pours mostly clear honey colored with a long lasting thick white head. like marshmallow fluff. it smells like resinous piney hops, bitter, with lighter english malt only in supporting position. full bodied bitter flavor with plenty of forest hops. not citrus or floral at all, just stright hop oil in bitter form. still theres some sweeter element in the finish, the mouthfeel is velvet, and the alcohol is strong enough to buzz you out without too much potency to lay you out for the evening. great carbonation and just an all around aggressive hoppy happy delight. again and again for me",Bear Republic Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,93
610,2751,babaracas,4.1,"Pleasantly surprised to see this one, unannounced, on the shelves here. Can't read the jibberish bottling code, but assuming it's not too old, given that it's new to the area. Pours a golden color with fine sediment in suspension, two finger thick white head which settles to a quarter inch, leaving a few blobs of lace down the glass. Smell: biscuit, grapefruit, honey-ish + white grape sweetness, alcohol and dried tropical fruit notes. It's nice, but it's not Big. Taste: grapefruit with some herbal and vinous stuff going on, backed by pale malt sweetness. Lingering citrus peel oiliness, as well as a splash of booze. The feel is almost-creamy cut by booze, which is odd for only 7%. Drying finish. This is good, but it's a bit rough around the edges, which is, less pleasantly, surprising given its rating around these parts.",Bear Republic Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,93
610,2751,TAMU99,3.12,"Just can't get really exctited.  Pours a ever-so-slightly hazy dark yellow. Medium head dissipated slowly. Some lacing left on the glass. Scents of bread, citrus and hops. Taste is all hops, with a finish of alcohol. The hops aren't bad. Just simple. Like a canvas painted a single bright color. Not ugly, just doesn't hold your attention that long. There is a grapefruit rind taste that lingers on the back and sides of the tongue...because it's an IPA. There is a very slight alcoholic zing with every third sip or so. Mouthfeel is meh. That bitterness lingers a bit too long. Overall - good for a 6-pack. Well brewed, but not my favorite.",Bear Republic Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,93
610,2751,shand,4.57,"Racer 5 pours a crystal-clear golden color with a light head that retains well. The aroma is a citrus bomb, this beer's got a heavy citrus nose, primarily grapefruit and tropical fruits. The taste is yet another burst of hop flavor, it's got the strong citrus from the nose hitting first along with a massive bitter presence that strikes after a few seconds. The malt hangs to the back, anchoring everything well while letting the hops shine. The aftertaste is a great, lingering bitter resinous hop. The mouthfeel is lighter and well-carbonated, it drinks like an APA. The drinkability is amazing. Overall, Racer 5 is a top-tier IPA. It's just very satisfying and has a unique flavor profile that stands out from the pack.",Bear Republic Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,93
610,2751,Dope,4.25,"A: Pours a mostly clear golden amber. Big frothy white head. Nice lacework left behind, almost solid with lots of tiny tiny holes. Great retention with an island of foam that sticks around forever.  S: Lots of grapefruit and some pine - maybe even tropical fruit? Mainly grapefruit though. Touch of caramel malt. Strong and sharp hop presence.  T: Big up front hops. Mainly grapefruit again. A little caramel in the middle to sweeten it up. Finish is a bit grainy with more grapefruit and some resin to boot. Nice lingering hoppy aftertaste with just enough caramel to stick around.  M: Medium bodied, smooth. Sticky, resinous mouth coating hops, especially in the aftertaste.  O: An excellent, excellent west-coast style IPA. Hop flavor and aroma is strong and delicious. Not overly so, having said that, it still retains excellent drinkability without being a ridiculous hop bomb. I enjoyed this one a lot. Great balance between a super hoppy beer and a blander but drinkable pale ale.",Bear Republic Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,93
610,2751,alkemy,3.97,"This time I'm finally getting it on tap. Kind of a dirty straw/honey golden color. More clarity out of the tap than out of the bottle. Creamy just off-white head. More of a floral hops for me. This time the citrus and pineapple reveal themselves. I didn't notice this with bottles, but this keg was freshly tapped and obviously had never seen sunlight. Hops are also more prevalent. Malts seemed to ride in the backseat where they belong. I get some grapefruit on the back end along with an odd hint of vanilla. Felt nice in the mouth. Although this has let me down out of the bottle, the fresh draft was very good. I'd have to give this a Rachel Ray Yum-O.",Bear Republic Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,93

S- Impressive citrus off the bat. Pineapple and grapefruit and lime. A slightly sweet maltiness.  T- Not as bitter as I expected but the flavor is overwhelmingly citrusy. A lot of pineapple, grapefruit and lime as well as mango and orange come through in the middle of the mouth. The malt backbone is very subtle but sweet and breaddy and goes pleasantly well with the flavor from the hops. Its rather refreshing and pleasing to drink.  M- Medium body, Not too bitter. A refreshed aftertaste of citrus.  O- An excellent IPA, one of the best single IPA's out there. I wish this was distributed to my area.",Bear Republic Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,93
610,2751,SnowFlowMfg,5,"I give this beer a 5 based on it's representation of what I feel an IPA should be. I typically do not prefer IPAs and I actually find this one very enjoyable.  All I have to say is that it looks tantalizing and retains an amazing, creamy head to the end. Nice medium carbonation can be seen through the clear amber. The smell is sweet with strong tropical fruit hop smell. The taste is a spot-on balance of sweet maltiness and piney/tropical hop bitterness that sits just right, not too bitter and minimal bitter finish. It feels thick and chewy but not overbearing. It is truly an easy, smooth drinker with a slight resinous and oily feel to chew on. I gotta say I really like this one and will be the only IPA other than Pliny that I would actually purchase.",Bear Republic Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,93
610,2751,Sal_Paradise,3.88,"I've had this a ton of times, but I guess this is the time I'm going to actually review it. On draft at a local bar in western, MA. Apppearance: Pours hazy orange with a white head which quickly dissipates. I've actually always thought of this as a golden IPA...but the lighting in here isn't that grate either...I think this bar probably goes through a beer like this at a moderate pace, so it's not super fresh, but still very good.  Smell: LIght grapefruit smell, floral, yeasty (almost like sourdough)  Taste: As almost every other time i've had this it is really a grate all around balanced ipa. Initially good grapefuit taste, well balanced malt in the middle and a slight hint of acidity/bitterness at the end. I would love to try one of these that was super fresh...I think it would likely be much more assertive.  Mouthfeel/Overall: Sometimes these are just too easy to drink...at 7% that can be dangerous, but it is tasty. This is a perfect summer time IPA. Light in body yet tasty, closer to an american pale ale i think. Differing from someone like sierra pale in a good way with more citrusy/floral hops.",Bear Republic Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,93
610,2751,SerialTicker,4.45,"Appearance: A nice, somewhat hazy amber color. Head doesn't live too long, but there's still a good bit of lacing left behind.  Smell: What a bouquet. A lot of grapefruity aromas, but then some other hops in there as well. There's also some other sort of fruit I can't quite pinpoint... almost smells like Fruit Loops or Fruity Pebbles in a way. I'm not sure where I'm getting that.  Taste/Feel: Just so damn impressive. It's an IPA that's more interesting than most, in my opinion. It drinks like a pale ale, but it hits you with the bitterness you'd expect from an IPA. The finish is pale ale-like in that you get the malts... but at the same time, you get the grapefruity flavors. The carbonation is about medium, and the feel is pretty middle-of-the-road. Fits this beer very well, making it super thirst quenching.  Boy am I glad I picked this one up. Something about it just sucks me in... it's a wonderfully constructed IPA that also has a lot of APA in it as well. May well be my favorite IPA.",Bear Republic Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,93
610,2751,Megahertz,4.26,"12 oz bottle carefully decanted into a Hoffman House chalice. Bottled on 08/20/12.  A - Crystal clear golden with a large, tightly packed, foamy white head. Gorgeous.  S - Massive citrusy grapefruit. Hard to get past.  T - Bready malt and slight caramel with massive fruity hop flavors. Transitions into a hop bitterness that is the very picture of clean. Bone. Dry. Finish.  M - Light body with medium to low carbonation. Only thing I can stick it for. Probably varies from batch to batch.  O - I want more. This is the photograph of an american IPA. Classic example of the style.",Bear Republic Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,93
610,2751,circus_cat,4.57,"A: Nice apricot hue to the body. Could also be described as light amber, almost orange. Mine got a two finger soapy eggshell head which is dissipating at a moderate speed and leaving a lot of lacing.  S: Hop bomb on the aroma. *Satisfied sigh* Just when I was feeling like a really juicy IPA. Website says it's brewed with several hop varieties but I'm really getting the Cascades on the nose. Bigtime grapefruit with a little mango in the background. A floral character. Caramel malt backbone. The nose has got me excited to try what seems like a quintessential well-made standard West Coast IPA.  T: Fruity pebbles at the tip of the tongue followed by bigtime citrus and floral tastes through the middle. Bitter hop end. Very nice.  M: Medium bodied, not too tepid but definitely nice and subdued on the carbonation front. I'd like it to coat the mouth a little more, but it's refreshing.  Comment: While 7% isn't huge by the big IPA arms race standard you see in the craft beer world, it's nothing to scoff at either. They do a good job of masking it. Again, this tastes like a quintessential floral, citrus-rich West Coast IPA--if you're a hophead like I am, you'll like it.  Update: I was shocked when I discovered this had 75 IBUs! Felt more hoppy than that.",Bear Republic Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,93
610,2751,PorterLambic,3.88,"Arrives a clear dark golden color with a small white head. No real retention though the lacing is great. Smell is evergreen hops, slight malt and some citrus. Balance is alright. Taste is malty, restrained hops (especially for a west coast US IPA), piney, some alcohol presence. Decently balanced. Nearly full-bodied, lightly effervescent, warming and smoothish. Overall, a very good beer, one I would gladly do again.",Bear Republic Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,93
610,2751,kylehay2004,4.03,A: single finger head with awesome lacing on a clear bright golden body.  S: Grains and pale malts with citrus and earthy hops.  T: earthy and citrus hops throughout which are tart. Caramel malts form a nice base. A slight burnt toast character to this one.  M: lighter side of medium body and moderate carbonation.  Overall: this one is very nicely balanced. The hop character is not all that complex but it's still good.,Bear Republic Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,93
610,2751,DanJimenez,3.73,"Poured it into a chilled glass and noticed it's beautiful golden light brown color.  It has the typical smell of an IPA and I wouldn't say it's that strong(smell).  Now I don't usually like the taste of IPAs but this seems to taste more like a normal pale ale than an Indian pale ale, which in my opinion, is a good thing.  As for mouthfeel, it seems to be more rich and thick than most of the IPA's I've had the chance to try which gives it a fuller taste and a more satisfying after taste than the usual IPA.  Over all, it is the best IPA I've had the chance to try, if I were an ipa type of guy I would have given it a 4.5 or better.",Bear Republic Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,93
610,2751,claspada,3.6,"Pours a bright golden color with a medium size white soapy head that leaves ample lacing.  Aromas begin with a ton of grapefruit and lemony hops, some pine, with a lightly sweet crackery pale malt backbone.  The tastes follow the nose with huge grapefruit and floral hop flavors assaulting the palate leaving a great deal of lingering bitterness. Not much malt backbone even as it warms as the aromas slightly suggested.  The mouthfeel is medium bodied with medium carbonation. The finish is pretty dark bitter and becomes a challenge to enjoy more and more as it warms.  Overall this is just not a very drinkable/enjoyable beer as I find with most West Coast single IPAs.

610,2751,CJ526,3.39,This beer is almost golden in color and lighter than I would expect. The flavor is good but not too hoppy for an IPA.

It's a combinations of hops that gives a nice smooth bitterness that blooms into a heavy hop taste that isn't sharp but more of a full bitterness. Maybe a slight honey, and citrus flavors in there too.  M- Medium/full body with a carbonation that matches well with the bitterness.  O- Great IPA that will not break the bank.

There is a light honeyed-citrus flavor along with some pine. It becomes sweeter as it warms and some of the sharp bitterness fades. M: Very crisp, but a little round, nice amount of carbonation. O: Very easy to drink and easy to reach for a 2nd or 3rd, but the alcohol level would make that a little dangerous. I suspect that if I drank 3 of these, then finishing the six pack would not be a problem (until morning).

Usually around $4 for a 22-oz bomber as of this writing (7/2012). I'm pretty sure I can even find it at major supermarket chains, not just my favorite liquor stores.  It's not too malty; the hops and malt flavors are well-balanced. The finish is quick, just like I prefer, with no lingering bitter aftertaste. It is a good ambassador of the west-coast-style IPA.  It doesn't offer the smooth, refined piney goodness of certain competitor brews, but it's certainly very drinkable and refreshing.

Beautiful amber pour, nice, white head, quality lacing as the glass quickly empties. Complex taste, but not so complex that it's overwhelming. A slight bit of spice on the front end followed by a super clean finish that leaves me begging for more.

Taste: follows the aroma. The citric, pine and floral hops are absolutely present, but also have some bread malts to back it up. Better than the usual American IPA - more complex.  Aftertaste: the heavy hops linger a bit too much for my palate, but I can at least recognise that it has been magnificently combined. A steady bitterness travels through, which is nice.  Mouthfeel: medium-to-heavy body, light-to-moderate carbonation. I'm glad the carbonation hasn't been over-done like some American IPAs.

610,2751,mschind,2.98,"A- Poured from a bomber straight down the center and got a huge fluffy off white head. Nice retention and lacing. Great color, light copper and clear although there is some particulate in suspension. Had this upright in the fridge and everything looked well settled.  S- Tangerine and grass with malt in the background and some phenols. Complex.  T- Doesn't quite deliver on what the nose promises. Citrusy bitterness up front but there is a significant phenolic banana taste from the middle to finish which is not working for me. There is some harsh alcohol in the finish too.  M- Maybe it was the pour but this is a bit flat. Took it easy with the second glass but same result.  O- This is one to review again, maybe I got an old bottle or there was some other issue. Hope this is not typical because I have heard great things about this IPA",Bear Republic Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,93
610,2751,Treyliff,4.4,"A- pours an orange-gold color with a big frothy white head that reduces to a solid layer, a bit of lace left on the side. A few yeasty looking particles floating around.  S- Lots of citrusy hops, a bit of hop oil, and a bready malt lies beneath the hops. Also some tangirine/ grapefruit notes. Alcohol is also noticable.  T- Lots of hops right off, and it lingers on the palate. Grapefruit come through in taste as well along with a sweet mango taste. Also some pine notes. The malt takes a back seat to the hops but complements it well, a bit biscuity. Alcohol is noticable but pretty well masked for 7%.  M- medium carbonation and velvety smooth. medium body with superior drinkability. One of the few ipa's that I could drink one after the other.  O- This is one of the most drinkable ipa's that I have had, very smooth. It's got a big hops kick but is well balanced and has a nice malt backbone. Very solid!",Bear Republic Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,93
610,2751,vinhgoh,4.25,"This beer is the second IPA that I absolutely love from Bear Republic. Definitely a solid 4.5. Don't like it as much as their Hop Rod. But definitely well balanced...A newcomer to IPA would know that this is definitely a good IPA. Hoppiness isn't too strong nor weak. Its fruity accents make it seem like a ""dessert beer."" Fruity guy to freshen your breath? No, Racer 5.",Bear Republic Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,93
610,2751,marcellaproust,4.4,"A very fine, even head about the width of a fingernail. Lasts for the entire drink. Fine fizzy champagne bubbles throughout as well. Not an awfully strong nose, but this may be because I'm drinking it from a wine glass--I smell pale green tea, maybe a citrus note or two. Thank god we do not have an overblown hop-hammer here: this is an expert, discreet tasting, though full-bodied and strong, IPA, with citrus, pine (and not pine resin, which is what the ostentatious, begging to be Bad Ass think passes for IPA) vegetal flavors. A long semi-dry finish -- no, actually smoother at start and then fairly dry from mid to finish. No lingering estery chemically taste at all. Tastes like a totally natural beverage, not overhopped like some of its chemical panel kin. I'm a fan after just one. Thanks to the BevMo dude that recommended this as I was on my way to a sixer of Deschutes Inversion (another great IPA).",Bear Republic Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,93
610,2751,Goblinmunkey7,4.35,"Appearance: Clear gold. Head is bright-white. Drops to a spotty cap and collar in short order. Lively carbonation.  Smell: Orange, grapefruit, big floral notes, and some tropical sweetness. Touches of mango. Pine resin and oily hops. Malts are bready with a bit of caramel sweetness. Some pithy bitterness. Very floral and citrusy.  Taste: More of that floral goodness. Nice punch of grapefruit and pine resin. Touches of mango and orange. A little grassy. Hop resin. Malts are nicely sweet and help balance out the hop bite. Some roasted undertones and cooked grains. Biscuity with enough hop aggression to show through. Lingering bitterness.  Mouthfeel: Creamy with a moderately-high carbonation. Medium body. So smooth and easy to drink. Slight crispness.  Overall: The first time I had this beer it blew me away. I still love this beer. It's not quite the earth-shattering beer I remember, but it's damn tasty. Perhaps it has something to do with the fact that it's next to impossible to get super-fresh in MA. Oh well, I'll keep it.",Bear Republic Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,93
610,2751,thecheapies,4.32,"Pours a bright, dusty orange gold color with a thin slick of head. Laces in straggles.  Orange and grapefruit hops. Tropical fruits sneak in with some juicy mango notes. Light malts that take an obvious backseat. Less bitterness, lots of true aromatics. Pretty simple, yet very nice.  Orange, mango, grapefruit pith, and a suggestion of lime; all from the citrusy and oily hop frenzy. Kiss of pine. Lots of delicious West Coast flavor here. Very dry and pale in the malt department with some distant toasty flavor. A one-sided West Coast IPA with only appropriately moderate bitterness--just how I like it!  Drinks beautifully. Good scrub-a-dub and the body has some great oiliness to it that rolls back off the tongue.  Racer 5 is prime stuff; always has been. Underrated in my book. Holds up against some of the best of 'em.",Bear Republic Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,93
610,2751,yamar68,4,"Disclaimer: my palate is pretty violated after a growler of Masala Mama...  Poured from 12oz bottle to imperial pint glass, thanks bugdoc for this one!  Pours a nice looking honey gold with a finger of soft white head that leaves appropriate lacing. The body is pretty still, but the beer was poured a bit cold.  S/T: lots of of thicker citrus notes mixed with a wide range evergreens. A bit of earthiness lingers beneath. Caramel/toffee malts are well incorporated.  Pretty damn drinkable. This is a beer that I would like to see on the shelf here in the MN distro. Thanks Mark!",Bear Republic Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,93
610,2751,carolinabeerguy,4.03,"Poured from a 22 ounce bomber into a New Belgium globe. No freshness info on bottle. I suspect that it was rubbed off.  Appearance: Pours a hazy medium gold with yellow-orange highlights and a 1 finger foamy snow white head. Excellent lacing.  Smell: Nice bouquet of fruity hops including sweet citrus, pineapple and grapefruit with just a hint of pine.  Taste: Sweet honey and floral hops up front followed by a mix of sweet and bitter citrus in the middle before ending with a blend of grapefruit, pine and a touch of sweet malt at the finish. Aftertaste is bittersweet with a touch of honey.  Mouthfeel: Medium-bodied with a good amount of carbonation. Goes down smooth.  Drinkability: Excellent drinkability. You could easily have multiple pints of this throughout the course of an evening.  Overall: Very good beer overall. I'm not sure how fresh this one was, but I still enjoyed it either way. I'd definitely recommend giving this one a try.",Bear Republic Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,93
610,2751,RonaldTheriot,4.67,"22 oz. bottle. Bear Republic Racer 5 IPA has a thin, white head (wide-brim glass) and a hazy, yellow-orange appearance, with some lacing left behind. The aroma is of orange and citric acid, and taste is of piney hops, oranges, sugar, and sweet bread. The mouthfeel is medium and soft, and Racer 5 finishes mostly dry and highly drinkable. Although I think the hop bitterness could stand to be a tad bit harsher, I still love this, and I rate it outstanding.  RJT",Bear Republic Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,93
610,2751,barczar,4.2,"Pours a clear deep golden orange color with a solid one inch cream head that dissipates slowly, leaving significant lacing.  Citrus, resin, and pine dominate the initial aroma, with grapefruit, pineapple, apricot, and mango taking center stage. There's a bit of dankness, leading to a bit of sweet caramel malt.  Flavor is also heavily citrus hopped, with vibrant grapefruit and lemon at the forefront, followed by a melange of pine, bitter resin, and a fairly peppery finish. The aftertaste is minty and herbal. Notes of tropical fruits add complexity. Caramel malt is fairly subdued, but surfaces more as it warms.  Body is moderate, with moderate carbonation, a touch of alcohol warmth, and a moderate amount of hop astringency.  Overall, an excellent, complex ipa. It really hits on all the right hop notes. Definitely not for the faint of hop!",Bear Republic Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,93
610,2751,Bitter_Echo,3.75,"Pours a cloudy, yellow copper, almost honey looking drink, with a low head, with little lacing. Smells malty sweet over bitter notes, but not getting prominent Cascade hops as advertised, or any of the other mentioned, but probably wouldn't know it. Bitterness does not sustain long but is there, somewhat muted, and appears modulated by the grain bill a bit. Not a 'nose forward' IPA. Oh, and mouth-feel is fine, with discreet carbonation, but not at all scrubbing. I've since had this fresher, and rated it higher on second try.",Bear Republic Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,93
610,2751,IronDjinn,4,"Picked up in Ponderay, Idaho. From a 22 oz. brown bomber. Let's see if this stuff was worth Bear Republic taking legal action against Central City over their own excellent Red Racer line. Pours out a bright golden hue with suspended particles, with a creamy off-white head that retains to a mid-sized cap.  Bright mandarin, grapefruit and lemon citrus character on the nose, some tropical fruit esters, and some dry biscuity grain.  Puckering grapefruit and piney hops up front in the flavour, with an extra underlying bitterness to it all. Mild bready malt in the background does its best to add some backbone, finishing with spicy, astringent grapefruit pith hops that linger on into the aftertaste.  Medium-bodied mouthfeel, slippery texture, with an assertive amount of carbonation.  The bottle conditioning adds a nice extra element to the hops, not so much the malt, some decent layers of depth to the hops here. A tasty American IPA that is worth seeking out, but boo on Bear Republic for their legal action against Central City, their Red Racer IPA still does laps around Racer 5.",Bear Republic Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,93
610,2751,T100Mark,3.67,"A ""full pour"" at the brewery.  Appearance - A little bit hazy/opaque. Not much head. Good (but not great) lace. Surprisingly pale.  Smell - Big hop hit! Orange peel.  Taste - Hoppy (obviously). Citrus. Tart. Clean.  Mouth - Wow! Tingly.  Overall - A bit much for me. I wouldn't call it balanced. This ale is so crisp it reminded me of Listerine.",Bear Republic Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,93
610,2751,deadonhisfeet,3.28,"Poured from a bottle into a New Belgium snifter. Pour is cloudy, light amber with a thin, quickly-dissipating head. The nose is very faint for an IPA. I get some lemon, grapefruit, and toast.  The beer is light-bodied for an IPA, yet has a fairly firm mouthfeel. I have no idea how old this bottle is, but there's not much of a hop smack to it. It has little balancing sweetness and little in the way of hops beyond a brief opening bitterness. The finish is rather bland.  An average IPA I won't buy again. There are far too many IPAs out there that are worlds beyond this one. This was my first beer from this respected brewer, but this won't stop me from trying a few others.",Bear Republic Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,93
610,2751,mjtiernan,4.1,"12oz bottle poured into an NB globe. Bottled on 4/12/12.  A: Off-white single-finger head. Body is a light hue of golden...seems lighter than most IPAs but maybe it’s just because it’s pretty darn clear.  S: Predominantly citrus and some nice tropical fruit. Some alcohol comes through.  T: More tropical fruit on the palate than in the nose. Citrus is less than I expected from the aroma but still a big part of the overall profile. More sweet at points than many IPAs. There’s a grain aftertaste that is more than I’m used to (or would prefer).  M: Decent amount of alcohol burn in the dry finish. Not the most drinkable IPA you can buy. Body is medium, texture is pretty dry and carbonation pretty standard.  O: I prefer IPAs that produce tropical fruit flavors. Although this isn’t the fruitiest example of the style, it’s still delicious.",Bear Republic Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,93
610,2751,jb413,3.95,"A - No good glasses in the new apartment. Straight from the bottle.  S - Piney moderately strong nose with some vague citrusy  T - Big piney hop-forward brew. Smack of bitterness. Some sweetness towards the end in a tasty finish.  MF - Smooth, good amount of carbonation, 7.0% ABV makes for a bigger body.  O - Big, hoppy, bitter. Definitely nice, but not quite as good as I'd hoped",Bear Republic Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,93
610,2751,theecaleb,4.13,"Served chilled from a 12oz Brown bottle no date.  A: Pours a beautiful golden copper colour. Fairly light. Very small amount of head from pour. Amazing lace on side walls of glass, almost leaves a film on the glass like oil and water.  S: Smells of a good quality home brew. Hops stand out, with hints of fruits and spices. Smells slightly better than the average IPA.  T and M: Just right, easily drinkable. Not to bi tter but just right. Tastes almost creamy. Small hint of alcohol but not over powering.  O: First beer I have had from Bear Public. After reading so many good things I had to give it a try, and I must say I'm not disappointed. This is a high quality IPA.  I would recommend this beer to a friend.",Bear Republic Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,93

610,2751,jmarklan,4.22,"A: Pours a clear golden/ dark copper. Head could be a bit better but it leaves some nice lacing.  S: Smells of earthy and spicy hops, slight citrus. Tropical aromas, fruity sweetness.  T: Hops bear the same characteristics as the nose let on and with an additional minty touch, but the malts and fruity aspects are much more prevalent. Slight pineapple and possibly mango? Very nice. Finishes with a slightly toasted grain. Not overly bitter and very well balanced.  M: Light/medium body, slightly syrupy, and very smooth. Hop resin is noticeable and sticks to the palate.  Overall: An awesome American IPA. Thank you, Bear Republic.",Bear Republic Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,93
610,2751,iabeerbaron,4.55,"A fantastic IPA. Cloudy orange/copper pour with a thick white head. Hop aroma shines with a bit of sweetness in there.

610,2751,BostonHops,4.27,"12oz bottle served in a standard pint glass.  pours a slightly cloudy, dull yellow tone with a finger, finger and a half of a frothy, off-white head. very good retention and lacing, but ultimately the presentation is middling to slightly above average; nothing really to write home about in a style chalked full of great ones.  strong citrus hops (notably grapefruit) are out in front in the nose, followed by a few pine and floral notes and are flanked by a background malty presence. solid, inviting aroma. taste exceeds everything else about this beer. which, if you're going to excel in one category this would be the one to do it. nice balance between the citrus/pine hops, a dash of pepper, and just the right amount of malt. very tasty.  medium-bodied mouthfeel with average carbonation. great drinkability. i could easily session this beer. not to be confused with a session beer... also love the widespread availability of this, a staple at my summer barbecues.  originally reviewed: 12-09-2010",Bear Republic Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,93
610,2751,plaid75,4.47,"On draft at Hurricane Grill, Syosset, New York.  Poured a suprisingly light copper hue with a one ginger foamy white head. There was good retention and lacing.  The smell featured a strong peppery hop and grainy malt.  The taste was full blown pepper hops with a moderate earthy sweetness.  The mouthfeel was toward the lighter side of the style considering the ABV.  Overall a superior IPA.",Bear Republic Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,93
610,2751,ThisWangsChung,4.25,"22 oz. bottle poured into a Sam Smith pint glass.  A: Pours a golden copper color with moderate clarity only broken up by tiny yeast floaties. The head is a two finger eggshell color with a thicker texture near the sides of the glass. Decent patchy lacing.  S: Grapefruit rind/flesh, a little peppermint, rosemary, hints of pine, black pepper, and a subtle malt sweetness. An enjoyable scent that does a good job of getting varying aromatic notes solely from the hops.  T: Surprisingly sweet, but in a good way. The initial wave of citric, grapefruity hops subsides to allow flavors of brown sugar, caramel, and toffee from the malt backbone to shine through. Touches of black pepper and coriander abound. Only a subtle citric/herbal/spicy bitterness on the finish breaks through the malt profile, along with the slightest hint of booze. Not only does it feature great balance overall, it has a (minor) depth of complexity to it; any IPA that reminds me of Hop Stoopid in that regard will almost certainly be a winner in my books.  M: Carbonation is very mellow, almost too mellow. Given its heavier body, it renders it slightly less drinkable then it could be (which isn't saying much, this is still pretty damn easy to down). Nice creaminess, with an aftertaste that is dry with herbal flavor qualities.  O: There are so many good IPAs on the market in my opinion, and this is definitely one of them...and it's easy to find in my area, too. Will definitely be buying this in the near future.",Bear Republic Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,93
610,2751,znichols,3.97,"A- Blazing bright gold color with sticky white head which dissipates into the beer fairly quick. Lotsa bubbles. Moderate lacing. Decent lookin' IPA.  S- I smell cascade hops. subtle grapefruit and lemon with hints of soft pine. a little bit of herbalness, caramel malt, and booze round out the aroma. Pretty nice nose here.  T- Great grapefruit flavor. Not as much pine as expected. Some soft grassy notes with a lingering maltyness that never really matches the hops. Minimal boozyness. This is a quintessential American IPA, very clean with plenty of citrus flavors and a tolerable but firm bitterness.  M- The mouthfeel is very nice and slick with a somewhat oily quality. Moderate carbonation.  O- This enters my book of exemplary American IPA's. Sticks to the book with fairly large grapefruit and lemon flavor and aroma. The subtle grassyness and malt lingers on the back end. Very enjoyable but nothing that'll blow you away.",Bear Republic Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,93
610,2751,B33R501,3.82,"interesting on the hand pump but i prefer the regular bootle version. thats ok.  light amber, pale look. aromas of floral hops, taste follows, better than the smell. lots and lots of floral hops, nicely malted for balance. very refreshing, drinkable.  recommended.",Bear Republic Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,93
610,2751,ThomasMetal75,3.75,"A- Orangy copper body with a one finger head. Good amount of lacing on the glass! Not too carbonated.  S- Hops! Piney hop smell. A little orange zest. Nothing was pungent about the smell.  T- Piney hops. The hops in the brewing process include Cascade and Centennial, so being piney in taste is no surprise. The hop bitterness is at 75+ IBUs according to Bear Republic's site. Also the beer has a peppery spice. The hop bitterness hits hard initially. As soon as that hop bitterness comes along, it fades! The finish is not bitter at all. Quite frankly, it finishes dry, leaving your mouth wanting more. Exceptional for an IPA!  M- Bear Republic describes the beer as being full-bodied, but I think it's defiantly a medium body and feel. Not too heavy, but nothing that allows the beer to be gulped!  Overall this was a wonderful IPA. I normally shy away from IPA's because they can be almost too intense with the hop bitterness, but this beer got out of the way quick enough for the bitterness to be pleasant. I would drink this IPA anytime I'm in the mood for a hoppy beer.",Bear Republic Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,93

A few bubbles but carbonation appears minimal.  S: Earthy hop notes with a sweet malt backbone. Imagine this is better a little fresher. Some fruity hops in there too.  T: Lots of hop overtones make up the front of this beer. Evens out with the sweet malty characteristics. Good balance between the two.  M: A little syrupy with the sweet malts, low carbonation. Lingering finish.  Overall a decent IPA that I need to try fresher or on tap.

610,2751,TheHoppiest,4.47,"Poured from a 12 oz bottle into a mug. Pours a slightly cloudy gold, with a 1/2"" of white foamy head. Decent carbonation keeps the bubble floating up from the bottom.  Has a spicy, citrus aroma, with hints of honey, straw and grass.  Lemon pith, pepper spice, and hints of pine combine for a tasty bitter start. White pine flavor increases toward the finish, with a nicely hopped conclusion that leaves the tongue dry.  Medium bodied, the feel is clean, relatively crisp and refreshing, with enough hops to produce a bit of tingle on the tongue and gums.

T: Balanced American hops. Heavy on pine and citrus. Good malt at the back.  M: Carbonation is perfect. Smooth. Easy to drink.  O: Awesome IPA. One of the standards for the style.  Looking back on this review now in 2020, I'm surprised I didn't elaborate more on this beer, as I remember it being one of my early favorites in my early craft beer days. Absolutely must be considered as part of a list of OG West Coast IPAs before the style was cool and hip.

610,2751,TheSixthRing,4.03,"Appearance - Pours hazy and dark golden orange in color. The head peaks at a finger's width, displaying decent retention before breaking down to a thin, consistent layers of suds across the surface. Lacing coats the glass in small, intricate dots that do well to hang around.  Smell - Big citrus notes with lighter Floral and grassy character. Think walking through an orange orchard during the bloom and you might get the gist.  Taste - A nice blend of citrus hop character here. Orange abounds with touches of grapefruit. Malts are generic, adding a hint of white bread sweetness in the underbody. A hint of leafy goodness in the finish and a sof  Mouthfeel - Medium body. Decent carbonation leads to a fairly good bite with a relatively smooth finish.  Overall - A solid IPA in all respects, and a tried and true example of the West Coast style.

M: Smooth and almost creamy and leaves a slick coating. It has a heavy body.  T: It begins with a sweetness that gives way to pine and resin and then a little orange citrus joins in.  0: Outstanding overall. A very pleasant hops forward taste, but doesn't need to hit you over the head with it. The begining blend of sweet malt and pine and resin is a great start for the transition to the slight orange. The heavy body really works well here, too.",Bear Republic Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,93

S: Hop aroma up front - citrus & floral, not much in the way of malt aroma.  T: The taste is more balanced than expected with caramel hops coming through more than typical for a beer with this IBU. Moderately lingering hop flavor on the back.  M: Nice & light, with a clean finish.  O: An excellent & drinkable beer.

610,2751,HoppySailor,4.01,"Bought this 22 ounce bomber simply because I recognized it as a highly rated IPA on beeradvocate. Poured into a New Belgium beer snifter.  A- Pours a slightly hazy copper/orange color with about an inch of white foam. Large bubbles and tiny ones too. Head retreats quickly and leaves nice lacing on my glass, although I see reports of little to no lacing in other reviews. The appearance of many chunks/flakes/pieces of yeast is a little creepy, but bottle conditioned ales should show yeast. I am just not a fan of chunky looking brews. I wont hold it against this one though, since it warns you on the bottle.  S- This one might smell like pine and citrus, or I might be smelling the last really strong IPA I had in this glass. I poured it a little colder than recommended, so that might be the issue, but this thing has a very thin aroma if any.  T- I started tasting this one at around 35 degrees and tasted it through almost room temp. Early on I tasted nothing but a little fruit, but later it really opened up nicely. Grapefruit, pine, lemon peel, tangerine and fresh biscuits. Definitely has some hops in it, although it is not as bitter as I normally like.  M- By far the best trait of this one is the mouthfeel. It hits the tongue and for almost half a second it acts like its going to have more fizz than a ginger ale, but then suddenly it softens to a nice creamy feel that one might expect from a cask-conditioned ale. Very well done.  O- Overall I would say this is a winner and the high ranking on beeradvocate is well deserved. It could have been one of my all time favorites for an IPA if it had more aroma. I never did get over the lack of scent. Would purchase again to share with friends.",Bear Republic Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,93
610,2751,Celtics76,4.42,"22 oz. bomber poured into a Star Wars Cantina glass. Orange-Gold in appearance, which is the way an IPA should look.  Well, it certainly smells great. Similar to Loose Cannon - scent is dominated by pine with a touch of citrus. As for taste, near perfect balance of flavors and bitterness. The bitterness sticks around for a few seconds after each sip which I like.  I've heard great things about this beer and it did not disappoint. However, I rank it behind Stone and Loose Cannon but not by much.",Bear Republic Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,93

610,2751,KarlosT,4.25,"Wow. I just found my favorite beer.  A gentleman at the liquor store recommended this pale ale. Mentioned that it had hints of fruity flavor.  I found it crisp, just the right amount of hoppiness, and hints of fruits ... perhaps providing a bit of sweetness to an otherwise bitter beer.  Update: 5/27/14. I think my pallette has evolved. I still like this beer, but it is definitely no longer my favorite. I find that there is a subtle metal after taste ... I notice that in a lot of the IPA's ... not sure what causes it.  Since my first evaluation, I would probably prefer the Lagunitas IPA over the Racer 5. But both are very good beers.",Bear Republic Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,93
610,2751,fox227,3.67,"A: This beer pours medium pale, not really pale, and not amber either. The head is slight, and doesn't retain for long.  S: Do I detect cotton candy? I smell a nice bouquet of flowers, and some sweetness.  T: The hop bitterness is nice, with a lot of the West Coast trademarks abounding: pine sap, citrus, bubblegum (!) but this beer tastes strangely hot for a 7%. For example, I recently had a Port Mongo (8.5%) and the alcohol levels were far better hidden than here. This beer is also rather biscuit forward, which I feel pairs better in the sweeter English style, rather than in the hoppy West Coast style.  M: Very hoppy, pretty dry.  O: This beer is somewhat of a surprise: a highly regarded hoppy IPA, and bottle conditioned to boot (I like that), but the have had quite a bit better as well.",Bear Republic Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,93

610,2751,WoodBrew,4,"Pours a slightly hazy golden color with a 1 inch foamy white head that settles to a small cap. Nice tight rings of lace line the glass on the entire drink down. Smell is all about the hops: grassy, herbal, earthy, and some slight citrus zest. Taste is mainly of grassy and herbal hops with a malt backbone to support everything. There is a mild bitterness that lingers on the palate with each sip. This beer has a medium bodied mouthfeel with a lower level of carbonation. Overall, this is a good IPA but it features a hop profile that I am not all that crazy about.",Bear Republic Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,93
610,2751,dbrauneis,4.32,"A: Pours a golden yellow to orange in color with some very light visible carbonation and some moderate sediment in suspension. The beer has a finger tall light beige head that reduces a little but remains as a very thick layer evenly over the entire surface of the beer. Moderate lacing is observed.  S: Lighter aromas of caramel malts that are then superseded by the wonderful hop aromas - I get some citrus, some tropical, and just a hint of pine. The citrus are more along the orange zest note and the topical is all pineapple. There is a nice complexity to the blend of hop aromas.  T: The taste very much follows the nose of this beer with the sweet caramel malts coming out initially but then being taken over by the hop flavors and bitterness. There is a pleasant and light lingering bitterness but nothing aggressive. The hop flavor are bitter orange zest, pineapple, and the slightest hint of pine resin with the pineapple being in the finish and lingering the longest.  M: On the lighter side of medium bodied with moderate to heavy amounts of carbonation. Smooth and crisp.  O: This is a very approachable and easily enjoyed beer - for fans of IPAs or people just getting started with the style. The beer has a really nice smell and taste, while hoppy is not overly aggressive in the bitterness. I could definitely have more than one of these at a sitting and will likely do so.

A - pale yellow with a billowing 3 fingers' width of white head that never fully dissipates, leaving behind an impressive lacing. I've never seen a better looking IPA. S - Pine, grapefruit, citrusy...and not a hint of malt. Wow! This looks good already. T - Starts with a bit of sweet caramely malt and hops take over right away. But all through, there is a nice balance between the malt and the hops; both complementing but never overpowering each other. Very drinkable. M - light bodied and sessionable. Perfect to the style.

Lighter tropical hop scents underneath. Touch of caramel and some biscuit.  T: Lemon zest and mandarin orange at the outset. Pine resin and bitter grapefruit rind kick in with a rough bitterness shortly thereafter. Pineapple. Faint grain and biscuit. Bitter pine and grapefruit in the finish.  M: On the lighter side of medium bodied, very lush and delightfully creamy. Light, prickly carbonation. Ridiculously smooth.  O: One hell of an IPA. Really damn tasty, great mouthfeel.

A lasting bitter with a nice little sour to accent the taste.  M: Really smooth and soft with a medium body. It's dry and really invites you to drink it more.  O: It's a subtle but wonderful IPA.

610,2751,PatDreadful,4.39,"Poured from a 22 oz bottle into a Victory Tulip.  Appearance: A light brown/dark orange hazy body throws up a huge tight head that is sticky as all get out.  Smell: This is firmly a West Coast IPA. Lemon zest, grapefruit and candied orange dominate the nose. This is exactly what I was hoping for! I do detect a bit of the malt but my nose refuses to let go of those beautiful citrus notes.  Taste: Bright! The lemon smacks you across the mouth and opens you up for some wonderful pink grapefruit notes. There are hints of some earthier hops but they are never fully realized. The malt backbone makes a cameo before that oily bitterness creeps up on you. I have never had an IPA where the bitterness actually ""creeps"". Very nice!

Super resinous hops intrude upon the nostrils with pungent grapefruit and citrus. Floral hops lay beneath with some malty undertones.  Huge slick malt body upfront sets up the tongue for the wave of flavor that's about to roll over the tongue. Citrus sweetness up front followed by huge grapefruit tartness.  Finishes with a floral bouquet of hops that snap any residual sweetness in half leaving you with a crisp dry finish. Super complex and layered beer with a mildly tannic aftertaste. The huge body thins out slowly as it travels along the tongue into a pop of satisfaction in the back of the month (thats what she said?) Not your everyday IPA but definitely delicious.

Smell: Pleasantly pungent citrus hop profile with some notes of grass and pine. Very aromatic. Just a touch of bread behind those hops. Taste: Hops and malts both noted upon first moment of tasting with the hops soon blowing by and above any malt presence. Hops are strong and a bit bitter here- citrus is the main characteristic- grapefruit especially. Malts are indeed present with a solid bready background, but are definitely pushed to the background. Bitterness persists for long after the tasting. Mouthfeel: Medium in body with the mildly tongue-curling bitterness. Overall: A great IPA here- strong and assertive.

610,2751,nrs207,4,"On tap and served in a pint glass.  A - It was a golden yellow color. Lighter than many other IPAs I've had. Pretty good looking overall.  S - Bitter hops. From the smell, I was thinking this is going to be pretty hop forward with bitterness and pine.  T - Just like the smell. It's got a pretty high level of bitterness, but that is how I like my IPAs. Not overwhelming at all, and I've certainly had much more bitter. It just has a light malt backbone. Pretty tasty overall, but nothing too memorable.  M - Pretty carbonated. Between the carbonation and the bitterness, this beer really wakes up the palate. It's not necessarily too high, however. It's a good mouthfeel, just not excellent.  O - I feel like this is a standard west coast IPA. Nothing memorable about the flavors, but they are well done. It's an above average brew, but it does nothing for me to seek it out again and again over some of the more memorable IPAs I've had. Definitely give it a try, you may think differently.

A strong pour yields a 1 1/2-finger off-white head that slowly settles to a decent dusting and thick foam ring after a few minutes. The body is a clear golden amber with some lazy, slow-rising carbonation bubbles and tiny, motionless floaties. Thin lacing clings evenly to almost every available portion of glass.  Strong citrus aromas dominate the nose. Notes of grapefruit, mandarin oranges, and honey combine well with a slight pine. The nose isn't the strongest but it is sweet, fruity, and delicious.  Sweet and bitter at first, this beer starts with flavors of honey and citrus carrying notes of oranges and grapefruit. As the beer is swallowed, the citrus flavors grow but quickly transform into pine. Then, a slight alcohol warmth picks up in the back of the throat and a piney bitterness rests on the tongue.  Medium bodied with moderate carbonation, this beer is a smooth sipper. The body is full and robust (for the style), which let's it coat your mouth and is only slightly sticky.

I was expecting something intense but instead i was greeted with a smooth and mellow spicey grapefruit taste followed by a bitter finish which added a little character to the beer. Overall i was expecting a bit more flavour but it was an okay IPA. I will let it warm up a bit and then maybe i'll get a bit more out of this.,Bear Republic Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,93
610,2751,BeerCentralWA,4.3,"well balanced and drinkable IPA. Bittering and aroma hops are well balanced, pine and floral nose dominate with malt being overpowered by alcohol and dry hop character.

A little resiny.  Tastes great- not too bitter but bitter enough and a nice round hop flavor. Pale malt throughout along with a lot of pine hops.  Mouthfeel is nice- not too carbonated but good enough with a light body. Very drinkable ipa- one of the better ones.",Bear Republic Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,93

Pours slightly hazy and cloudy golden amber color with a nice 2 finger dense off white head with fantastic retention that reduces to a nice cap that lingers. Some decent lacing on the glass. Aromas of big pine, grapefruit, herbal, lemon, caramel, and toasted bread. Very nice and well balanced aromas. Taste of big grapefruit, lemon zest, herbal, pine, light caramel, honey, spiciness, and toasted biscuit. Good amount of bitterness on the finish; with lingering notes of pine, herbal, citrus, and honey on the finish for a bit. Great balance of sweetness and bitterness. Medium carbonation and body; with a slightly creamy mouthfeel. Very smooth to drink at 7%, with only a slight alcohol warming after the finish. Overall this is a very excellent IPA offering. Great balance, hop flavor, and smooth drinking. At 6 bucks a bomber I really have no complaints.",Bear Republic Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,93
610,2751,grannaniwa,3.06,"Aroma of spicy, sticky hops. Straight-forward American IPA profile. First taste is deep, earthy, pungent hops. Almost syrupy on the mouthfeel. A little bit of thin sweetness on the backend, and then the aftertaste is hardly hoppy at all compared to the nose and sipping flavor.  Well-made, but comes off as one-dimensional to my tastes.  “This hoppy American IPA is a full bodied beer brewed American pale and crystal malts, and heavily hopped with Chinook, Cascade, Columbus and Centennial.”  Overall: B",Bear Republic Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,93

Very well balanced.  M: Light bodied, good carbonation.  O: Very enjoyable Pale Ale - has a ton of drinkability and very affordable.

Aroma is a nice mix of big big pine notes with sweet citrus and bready malts to back. Flavor follows with a good bit of light citrus on top of pine bitter. Strong malt backing, but manages to highlight the beautiful west coast hops. This is extremely drinkable, with medium high carbonation. Awesome brew, and a top level single IPA.",Bear Republic Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,93
610,2751,JohnnyMc,3.92,"Despite a relatively low alcohol percentage for an IPA, Racer 5 has a very bold taste that has just the right amount of hops to make for a bitter, complex and well balanced IPA.

Taste is all citrus and fruit, grapefruit, tangerine, mango, tons of bitter hop, light sweet malts keep this from crossing the line of being over the top hoppy, light pine in the finish but gets overtaken by clean smooth citrus. Light-med carbonation, incredibly oily, medium body, slick all over the palate.

T- More pine in the taste but very balanced malt character with the pineapple hop character. As it warms you get a bit more buiscut flavor and the pine comes out more.

Only complaint is that taste does not stay with you for long  O- I really appreciate how readily available this beer is, and how little it costs for the quality.

Smell is all about the hops: grassy, herbal, earthy, and some slight citrus zest. Taste is mainly of grassy and herbal hops with a malt backbone to support everything. There is a mild bitterness that lingers on the palate with each sip. This beer has a medium bodied mouthfeel with a lower level of carbonation.

Up front are some nice piney hops, maybe a little bit of citrus like orange, which is followed up by some nutty, roasty malt.  T: The hops are right up front, which goes down slightly bitter, but still delicious, Mixed in nicely are those roasted malt characters.  M: It's almost dry from the bitterness of the hops.

Head poured about one inch in size and looked thin. Not much lacing to speak of.  Smell: Piney hops stick out with some more subtle citrus notes.  Taste: Medium hop character hits the palate initially, with piney flavor to them. After that, the beer is immediately balanced by a sweetness that has some grapefruit flavor to it and a mild hop bitterness lingers as it goes down.  Mouthfeel: Light to medium mouthfeel with average carbonation for this style. No detection of alcohol.  Overall: A very good example of the style that is what one expects from an IPA.

Poured from bomber bottle to pint glass.  A - Beer pours a perfectly clear golden color with a 1 finger white head that slowly faded to a think silk layer which lasted the glass.  S - Gentle aroma of a variety of floral, citrus, and piney hops. A slight sweetness is detectable but not much.  T - Taste starts out with some caramel sweetness which quickly transitions to a grassy piney hop flavor. The medium bitterness immediately follows. The beer finishes with a mellow sweetness and mild hop character.  M - Medium to full bodied with light carbonation.  D - Very drinkable and approachable beer.

Many many many small bubbles move up through the brew constantly, adding to the cloudiness.  S- Very citrusy but light.  T- Nice mellow hops come on mellow and finish with extra bitterness. The alcohol is covered very well; even the lingering aftertaste is only hop bitterness, not booze. The complexity isn't appreciated until the beer warms a bit, and after sips. The subtleties of the beer are masterful- dried grass, straw. Not overly fruity or citrusy like many IPAs.  M- Malt bill is great. Racer 5 is easy to drink, and even refreshing, but deceptively so.:it finishes quite dry and is great in big sips.  O- Wonderful straightforward non-extreme IPA. Good for someone who loves hops but not sweetness. 7% ABV; just barely sessionable. It's the third BR beer i've tried after Hop Rod Rye and Red Rocket.

Smell: Floral hops, sweet malts, and something that resembles pineapple is noticed right away. A citrus aroma is more noticeable as the beer warms.  Taste: Sweet malts and bitter hops are balanced well but it does lack the complexity found in other IPAs. The hops are too subdued for an American IPA. The alcohol is hidden well.  Mouth feel: It feels soft and creamy with a slightly dry finish. The carbonation is more subdued than would be expected from the appearance.  Overall: A well balanced brew. Unfortunately, the smell is more complex than the taste. This beer is perfect if you want an IPA but not an all out hop bomb. Normally, an American style IPA should have a stronger hop bite.

Appearance: Pours a translucent amber color with two and half fingers of white foamy head that slowly settles into a thin foggy layer a few minutes later. Average lacing. 3.5/5  Smell: Fresh citrus and pine. Some tangerine, light apple juice. Some earthy resign. Some floral hops and faint sour notes if you swirl. 3.5/5  Taste: Instantly gives me cotton mouth. That was unexpected, but interesting...Getting apples up front with some orange peel. Surprisingly grassy. Touch of sweet grapefruit. Some sugary-maltiness and bitter hops. Malty and slightly skunky-sweet on the mid-palate before turning dry and bitter in the finish. 3/5  Mouthfeel: Medium bodied, moderate carbonation and a bit creamy for an IPA. Gave me cotton mouth, which was an unexpected twist that made the citrusy-hops bitterness linger well. Finishes very dry and bitter. 4/5  Overall: I do not see the hype behind this beer. Maybe it just was not fresh, as I got mine as part of a make your own mix-a-six at Riley's.  Recommendation: Worth a try, but does not stand out as a worthy sixer-buy. Not too hops-forward, so casual beer drinkers should enjoy. The mouthfeel is very unique.  Pairings: Caramel-toffee candies.

610,2751,jrenihan,4.2,"Cannot find a bottle date.  Beer is a golden orange colour. A finger-width of white head. Pretty good retention. Good lacing.  Nice smell, full of juicy citrus. Pineapple sticks out, some grapefruit as well. Pine scents are strong as well. Sweet malt is present as well.  Lots of juicy citrus flavours in the taste as well. Grapefruit and lemon leave a moderate and nice bitterness. Pine flavours are there as well. like the nose. A pronounced caramel malt flavour backs it up. Very well integrated. Finish is bitter but only moderately. The alcohol is barely noticeable I would have guessed it was lower.  Medium bodied with moderate carbonation. A bit sticky feeling.  Overall, definitely a very good IPA. The label does not scream ""buy me"", but the appearance is deceiving!",Bear Republic Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,93

Not too much of either, but if I had it my way the hops would be just slightly less pronounced.  Mouthfeel is slightly acidic but crisp and smooth for the most part  Overall a great IPA that can be enjoyed all year round",Bear Republic Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,93
610,2751,McStagger,4.26,"Poured from a bottle. Lot of sediment in the bottom. Bottled on 9/30/13.  Re review! Best by 9/25/15.  A: Bottle conditioned. Hazy orange with two fingers of head. Lots of floaties. Fairly vigorous carbonation. Head is sticky with great retention. Excellent lacing.  S: Dank. Very aromatic. Lot of stone fruit and citrus. Definite bready maltiness underneath. Crush pine needle, dried herb. Smells great.  T: Big but not huge hit of bitterness up front. Very piney and west coasty, with loads of grapefruit peel thrown in for good measure. Burst of overripe tangerine through the middle. Bready maltiness in the back end. Candied citrus peel and candied spicy tropical fruit. Small prick of alcohol heat with a tiny bit of residual sweetness coming through.  M: A bit weightier than expected. Carbonation is surprisingly subdued as well.  O: Awesome flavor! Definitely one of the bigger single tier IPA's on the market. Little bit of booze heat and a bit heavy, but I can't deny it tastes delish.",Bear Republic Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,93

It's nice and smooth, making it really hard for me to stop at just one. This IPA definitely ranks pretty high on my list and is certainly a go-to IPA for me.

About a half-inch of creamy head departs casually and sticks to the glass.  Taste: Lots of it. A little bit of toffee at first, then hops. Fruity and light like berries at the front, then dark, dank, bitter grass down the back and sides. A little grainy like whole-wheat bread.  Overal: A perfect beer for a hophead. The grapefruit bitterness lingers especially well.",Bear Republic Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,93
610,2751,Durtdiggler,4.09,"Poured from bomber bottle into the The Queens pint glass. Bought at Binnys.  Cloudy light copper haze with 2 finger head, noticeable yeast present from bottle conditioning. Been wanting to try beer republic.  Aroma, smells big upfront like Magnum or warrior type of hops. Sweet caramel and bready malt. Not as centennial as the Michigan beers. Floral slight citrus. Aroma is more subtle, a bit refined, not as pungent but I love the hops used.  Taste is very piney, also with citrus but not as big upfront. Instead the hop flavor is more lasting on the backend. I can taste centennial or cascade? A bit syrupy with Carmel. It's very balanced with malt and hops.  Mouth feel is smooth, soft but can use more carbonation. Very easy to drink and goes down very easy for its 7% Abv. Bottle conditioning ?  Great beer, very soft and easy to drink, elegant like and less pungent. I really enjoyed it but I am more taken by the Michigan and 3 Floyds style that hits harder with aroma and hops taste. I think the bottle conditioning mellowed and subtle the edges on this beer and it works. I reccommend trying it.",Bear Republic Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,93

The head settled to a dusting. There was nice lacing down the pint.  S) Nice fresh pine and citrus fruits.  T) A good malt/hop balance. There is a little fresh squeezed OJ flavor, pine and tropical fruit. The bitterness evens out really well with the other flavors present.  M) A medium body with just the right amount of carbonation. A smooth drinker with a clean finish. Nice aftertaste.  O) Well done.... This is a fine IPA. I would gladly recommend.

Taste - West coast all the way. Piney, chewy and moderate/heavy bitter. Lots of hops frying the palette in this one. Nice malty mouthfeel as well. hops.  Overall - For a west coast style IPA, this beer is spot on, and I can understand the praise for this being very true to style and well crafted. Just not quite the IPA style I generally like but its a nice change of pace.

610,2751,Bockrules,4.8,"poured from the bottle into a pint glass  A - Pours a nice hazy, orange-gold with small flecks of yeast suspended throughout. Only a few bubbles rise to the dense, off-white, two-finger head. Head stays intact all the way down the glass. Leaves behind generous splotches of lacing.  S - Nice bouquet of floral aromas greet the nose upon opening the bottle floating a sweet caramel backbone. In the glass, the nose becomes more citrus with orange, pineapple and grapefruit notes.  T - Upfront, we have orange flavors and sweetness, almost like a wheat beer. The body is exceptionally well balanced with floral hops perfectly balanced by a firm Caramel backbone with hints of orange and mango on top of it all. Sticky orange flavor as the beer passes over the back of the tongue that intensifies into a lingering bitter-orange finish.  M - Medium bodied with low carbonation to give the beer a nice creaminess that compliments it well.  This beer has been tempting me in my fridge ever since I picked it up a couple months ago in Phoenix with my wife on our anniversary. Faced with literally hundreds of beers I hadn't sampled before, I was forced to only bring 12 home with me. Glad I chose Racer 5. Hands down this is the best IPA I have ever had the pleasure of drinking. Though not a hop-heads delight, this beer is incredibly smooth and balanced despite being very complex and having a rather high ABV of 7%. Hopefully I can find this beer in New Mexico as I would love to make it a staple in my fridge.

A bright hoppiness hits the outsides of the secondary palate, while a nice bitterness is present in the middle. Aftertaste is slightly malty, with hops resting on the entire perimeter of the palate. At 7% ABV, the alcohol is hardly noticable.  M: Hops blend nicely with malt and carbonation to creat a mf that is both agressive and mellow.

A bit of a white froth rests on top, sticking around with a firm resilience and leave a few spots of lace on the glass. Visible bubbles rise from the bottom of the glass to replenish the head.  Smell: The focus of the aroma is a juicy citrus hoppiness. Some light honey sweet grains are noticeable as well, as is a slightly pungent herbal and earthy hoppiness.  Taste: Up front there is a good amount of bready malt with a bit of honey. The sweetness lingers for a few moments, blending with the grapefruit, tangerine, and orange zest very nicely. Some light herbal hops and spicy notes combine with a dose of pine hops to create a complex finish. There is a lightly bitter aftertaste.  Mouthfeel: Bear Republic has done just a phenomenal job of figuring out the mouthfeel to their beers. Creamy and smooth to the utmost degree without losing the raw grainy and prickly nature of the malt and hop bills. The carbonation helps to assist the flavors reach the tongue efficiently without getting in the way. The body is properly medium to full.

Strong herbal hop smells in the aroma- mostly pine and grass with some tangerine and grapefruit.  Taste starts off with a strong blast of pine and grass. Some of the citrus comes out in the midpalate- grapefruit and tangerine. The finish is predominantly bitter hops and pine. You can taste some booze in the finish but it is not out of place. Leaves a lingering bitterness on the palate.  This is a hefty beer. Pretty thick and sticky. Lots of hop oils and resin. Low carbonation.  I would prefer more of a balance in the flavor profile.

I poured it into a tulip glass to pull in as much as possible in smelling.  Racer 5 tastes better than it smells. I sipped this beer over more than an hour to savor it. You continue to get the pine, but it is not over-whelming.  It is great balance in mouthfeel. There isn't much bitterness, and the after-taste is a pleasant lingering of hoppiness.

It's still an excellent beer, having all the yummy hoppy IPA flavors with a darker appearance.

The beer is a golden transparent yellow and there are microscopic bubbles rising from the bottom. The head is off-white and doesn’t stick around, not a bit of lacing.  T & M: Upfront the taste is floral hops and sweet (a bit too sweet) malts. The taste is kinda bland. I was expecting a bit more. The finish is quite bitter, with a very slight dryness, but there is no unpleasant aftertaste like in some IPA’s. very smooth even a bit creamy. Well balanced. By the taste it seems like it should have a higher percent alcohol. Very nice carbonation (better in the beginning), on the higher end of a medium bodied beer. Pretty drinkable.  O: I thought this beer would be a bit better after I had their Rye IPA, but its still pretty darn good.  My normal rating process is to rate the beer then look at how other people (most the top raters) rated the beer, and I was shocked to see how many people really, really liked this beer.

610,2751,BerkeleyBeerMan,4.45,"Appearance: Glowing peachy orange color with hints of red. Light bubbly head. Solid natural carbonation.  Smell: Blast of grass and and pine hops accompanied by a nice grainy almost English style backing malt. The beer packs a punch of tropical fruits, melon rind, and spices. Nice mild pale aromas which are very inviting. The sweetness is so alluring.  Taste: Melon-rind and grapefruit citrus accompanied by bread, grass and papaya. Hop forward but with a balanced malt backing that makes this beer quaffer. A quick flash of bitterness is ended with a sweet sugary lingering. Sweet at the point of perfection.  Mouthfeel: Light, crisp and refreshing. Full of flavor but somewhat watery in texture. Not as sticky and resinous as Torpedo and not as malty is Stone IPA. It is right in between and the balance makes this a perfect go to IPA.  Drinkability: Hands down one of the most drinkable IPA's in existence.

A bit of sweetness in the back rounds out the finish.  D: Alcohol well hidden and flavours are nicely balanced, no complaints here.  Overall: I liked it!

Pine seemed to be leading the way, but it wasn’t too strong. Some floral flavors as well.  Initial taste was a strong alcohol bite with some citrus and pine hops in there. It ended with a floral/fruity aftertaste. Slightly bitter on the tongue at the end.  Medium body. Soft carbonation. Smooth and refreshing.

610,2751,zac16125,3.83,"Racer 5 IPA bomber poured into a mug no born on date or other distinguishing numbers  A: Pours a slightly hazy light golden amber, with just over 1 fingers width of bubbly egg shell white head, which takes a moderate about of time to dissipate and leaves lots of cob-web lacing all the way down the glass.  S: Big citrusy hop aromas, most notablely grapefruit and tangerine. There is also a malty sweetness, and a subtle hint of alcohol which is rare for me to pick up on in the scent of an IPA.  T: First off, the flavors are not as strong as the aroma. Also, not as much bitterness as I like in an IPA, and what is present is mostly piney hop bitterness on the backend. The upfront taste is citrus hops, but it is mild, almost subdued. No flavors really stand out strongly, but if I had to pick one I’d say lemon zest is the most prominent. I’m not saying the taste is bad, but its nothing special IMO. It lacks the complexity and depth of flavor that I look for in a great IPA. To me, the taste is very similar to a weaker version of Bell’s Two Hearted Ale. Again, not bad, but not as much going on with the palate profile as I would like.  M/D: Light to medium bodied with a good moderate amount of carbonation. Smooth and very easy to drink.  O: Overall, this is a good IPA but nothing special. A nice appearance and aroma aren’t really backed up in the taste which to me comes off as generic and middle of the road. I will say though that you can’t beat the price (around $5 for a bomber) and I do plan on trying the Hop Rod Rye which most seem to agree is the best Bear Republic offering.",Bear Republic Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,93

Fortunately, after taking a break, it still holds up. In a way, it's a hop bomb, but it also respects the notion of balance with its interesting malt profile.

610,2751,paxchristi,4.2,"Appearance: Pours an ever so slightly hazy light amber color with sun yellow hues. Below average head retention, but I can see that if head were present, it would pour a good looking IPA. I'm giving it the benefit of the doubt, because I've seen Racer 5 pour excellent head.  Smell: Pretty intense hops for an IPA that doe snot claim DIPA status. Floral hops at that. I catch hints of honey, citrus, pineapple, and a sweet malty backbone-- though it is a faint backbone. But I like it that way; balance while still going for the hophead appeal.  Taste: Earthy, floral, piney hops, tropical citrus, and a slightly dry bitter finish. Smells like quality fruits...rich more than sticky. As it warms, the dry seems to stick a bit more.  Overall: Way above average for an American IPA, and definitely true blue to the west coast IPA style. Its a prime west coast IPA flavor. A palate destroyer. Will drink more before I decide if I will seek this out again. Its a total ""go to"" beer. I don't like it more than Two-Hearted, but its a close second as far as ""go to"" IPAs go.",Bear Republic Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,93
610,2751,kennylopez,4,"Poured from a 12oz bottle into a pint glass.  Appearance: a fingers worth of head that did last to long. a golden yellow that was hazy.  Taste: hops are the first bitter taste(hint IPA) but it dials more towards the hops. a floral hint in the end comes to me.  Mouthfeel: a mild burn, but good and flavorful aftertaste.  Overall: a good everyday IPA. I would like to keep a case of 12oz bottles if it wasn't so hard to get by me. the bombers are abundant, but I like the single servings.",Bear Republic Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,93

Very delightful floral hops on the nose with light citrus, orange zest and caramel malt.  Flavor has a nice sweet caramel malt character balanced very nicely with floral hop notes and a candy-like sweet finish.  Light-med. bodied mouthfeel with medium carbonation.  Overall I've had this a few times and I really like it along with every other Bear Republic beer I've had. This one didn't seem quite as fresh as others I've had in the past but still a very nice beer.",Bear Republic Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,93
610,2751,Humulus85,4.05,"Thanks go to tjkinate for this one...  Poured from a 22oz bottle into my trusty nonic. Produced a very nice, fluffy, white, two-finger head. Good retention that left some sticky lace rings after each sip. It's a slightly hazed, honey gold.  Smells of fruity hops; citrus and tropical, maybe a touch of pine. There is some bready malt stashed away behind the hop that lends a welcome sweetness to the nose.  Tastes like it smells, good. Grapefruit and tropical fruit upfront, with a nice sweet malty middle balanced out by moderate to low bitterness. The finish is still dry with a touch of piney hop.  Mouthfeel is relatively heavy. It seems a lot of brewers are trying to make their IPAs really light and carbonated. Racer 5 seems more traditional in that it is moderately thick and moderately carbonated. It's a good thing.  Overall this is a solid brew from a brewery I am finding to be just as solid. I think it could have been more aggressive, as it lacks a certain complexity and depth for me to rate it any higher (recommend their Hop Rod Rye). I look forward to trying more from Bear Republic.

The beer is a gorgeous hazy lite copper-orange. Great lacing at the end of the session.  Smell - Mmmmm...big citrus and ripe ruby grapefruit, pineapple sweetness, slight pine.  Taste - Oh is this nicely balanced. You get the citrus, grapefruit, slight pine and perfect citrus & malty sweetness to counterbalance. After the sip there is some grapefruit rind and pine long into the finish, a llittle dry and bitter, enough to beg the next sip.  Mouthfeel - lite to medium, nice carb, not overly so at all - creating a very smooth and drinkable beer.  Overall - I really enjoyed this beer.

Very balanced, not bitter.  M: A bit dry. Average carbonation.  O: I think this is really balanced, not over the top with the hops, not too bitter and no burn.

610,2751,ibbjamin,4.42,"A great IPA I've had many times and keep going back to. A friend bought a bomber for me as a gift and when I went to drink it, just realized I have never formally reviewed it. I pour into a snifter.  Yields a white head of about an inch in height. Cloudy, murky and light orange in color. A nice layer of retention remains and there is thick lacing.  Strong grapefruit, citrus and pine aroma fills the room.  Taste is bitter and hoppy. Puckering hop juice, and a strong one for a single IPA. Strongest on the grapefruit with a lingering pine taste.  Smooth and very drinkable. Medium body, nice level of carbonation.  This is a hop forward, west coast style IPA that many use as a benchmark for west coast IPAs. Excellent!",Bear Republic Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,93
610,2751,mostpoetsdo,4.07,"A: Gold, almost amber, a gentle haze to it. Slightly off-white head.  S: Pungent combination of pine and citrus. More of a tangerine-like smell. Pretty much hop forward the whole way, an earthiness in the background.  T: Sticky, juicy citrus hops, combined with a sharp pine needle taste. Bits of bitter orange rind. The slightest toffee backbone is present.  M: Medium body, great carbonation. The tiniest bit hot.  O/D: Very enjoyable, finally glad I got to have it on tap, worth seeking out.",Bear Republic Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,93
610,2751,TenHornsProud,4,"Pours a light copper/orange, with a big white head and some floaties.  Smells of some kind of tropical fruit or lighter fruit with a sweet malt undertone  Up front caramel and light fruit that fades into bitterness and almost an almost peachy character with a sweet and bitter finish that lingers somewhat. Bitter enough to be assertive but not overly done.  Medium to full body, slightly creamy, and smooth. A small boozy character comes in at the end but does not detract.  This is a nice citrus, light fruit, peachy beer that has a big, but not too big, hop kick in the end. It goes down smooth and is pleasing.",Bear Republic Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,93
610,2751,Floyd12,4.67,Served on-tap poured into a pint glass.  A- A moderately hazy amber color with a thick foamy and creamy head of about two fingers. The head lingered for most of the beer and left fantastic lasing all over the glass.  S- Very hoppy with a slight malt. Citrusy underones with an earthy grainy smell as well.  T- Strong hard hop taste with a little bit of bitterness but not over the top. Again slightly citrusy but the hops take control without going overboard.  M- Very crisp and refreshing with a long dry hoppy finish.  O- This is one of my new favorite beers. I love this but have only seen this at White Horse in Boston. This needs to expand on the east coast.,Bear Republic Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,93
610,2751,SykDoc,4.02,"Poured from a bottle into a pint glass. It pours a hazy straw/orange color. A 1/8 inch almost white head forms and reduces to a speckled lacing.  The aroma is primarily orange citrus with perhaps a bit of pineapple. A malt sweetness makes a minimal appearance.  The taste is again an orange and pinapple citrus hops punch with a few earthy tones. Perhaps just a little caramel malt sweetness towards the end. Not much else, but good.  The mouthfeel is medium bodied. Carbonation seems to fall a bit flat for the flavor. It is clean and smooth with a nice dryness at the finish.  Nothing real flashy but a solid IPA with a good citrus hop forward presentation. It is quite easy to drink, part of which I attribute to the solid but not overwhelming components.",Bear Republic Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,93
610,2751,HopsKeepDroppin,4.42,"Poured from 12oz bottle into maudite snifter.  A- Very pale orange color with a small one finger head that lingers on the top of the beer  S- Some malt up front that leads the way into some really citrusy hop flavor.  T- Lots of citrus from the hops right up front but the malt takes over and balances it very well.  M- A nice medium body on it, the carbonation complimented the taste. Hops dried it out, made me want another sip, great.  O- This is one of my favorite IPAs so far. Very drinkable and one of the most balanced in my opinion.",Bear Republic Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,93
610,2751,gdrydenc,4.35,"A - Pours a much lighter color than I anticipated. I've had this beer several times, and I thought I remembered it being darker than this. Decent color, the head dissipates pretty quickly.  S - Smell is a little bit muted from what I've remembered as well. It's definitely there, a bit of juicy fruit, slightly sticky hops. Delicious smell, but a bit muted, like I said.  T - Well, the flavor makes up for any weakness in the smell. The fruitiness and bitterness kick hard at the beginning and don't stop until well after the finish. A great taste. The only improvement I could see would be a little bit more intensity, but at 7%, there's not a whole lot else you can do.  M - Mouthfeel is spot on. Good carbonation, great in the mouth. Not too watery, but not syrupy thick so as to make it undrinkable.  Overall, this is a great beer. Besides Harpoon (for the price) this is probably my favorite IPA to have around and drink a few of at a time. Great beer.",Bear Republic Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,93
610,2751,JDizzle,4.35,"Got a sixer tonight while out of town for $7.69 in East Lansing, MI. :):)  Poured from a 12 oz bottle and looks like a perfect IPA. Great copper, rusty, amber color with a thin white-off white head.  This smells great!! Citrusy, sweet malt, grassy-very hoppy. One of the better smelling IPA's with a great balance of hops and malt.  The hops are very ""West Coast"" style forward. It's a bitter beer that is balanced nicely with a breaded malt upfront and finishes with a blast of hops and grapefruit. For some reason I get a lactose flavor with this. Not complaining and can't really explain it, but thought I would mention it. Superb mouthfeel with a medium body and a great aftertate that is not too bitter but creamy. You really can't detect the alcohol in this one and it's very drinkable.

610,2751,FeloniousDrunk,3.79,"A: Poured from a 12oz. bottle into a Rare Vos pint glass. Golden brown in color with a nice, 1-finger ecru head and a touch of lacing. Hazy without being opaque.  S: Dried pine needles and some fresh citrus rind. A malted barley undertone with a fresh hop aroma that lingers. It smells inviting.  T: A dry maltiness on the tongue with a rich middle and a hoppy swallow. A bone-dry aftertaste lingers. This beer is a bitter IPA with a strong malt backbone. Flavors of bread with pine nuts, grapefruit rind, dead pine needles, earth, leather, and a pine tar bitterness are the main flavors I taste. An interesting juxtaposition between bready malts and piney hops. Not always blended smoothly...  M: Thick and robust without being overpowering, this beer has a great mouthfeel until the arid swallow and resulting afterfeel suck all of the moisture out of your mouth. Some people may be looking for that, but I like my IPAs a little more consistent.  O: For those interested in a complex, chalk-dry and bitter IPA, this is it. It's tasty, but oddly disjointed and disharmonious. I'd rarely pass one up, but there are more superior IPAs out there. I wish it tasted more like it smelled.",Bear Republic Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,93

Citrus hop aroma, hints of orange and pineapple. Pithy and aggressive. Just a slight hint of sweet malt.  Not surprising hop forward flavor in the west coast style. Not much flavor from the malt. Hop flavors include citrus with subtle hints of grass and mint. Bitter finish. The flavor is just not that complex or interesting.  Not abuntantly carbonated but that was probably because of a day in a growler. Medium bodied.  No doubt a well made beer that perhaps did not show its best to this drinker.

Good lacing all over the glass but just a small film of retention.  S - Smells of aggressive hops right off the pop of the bottle. Prickly pineapple and grapefruit with some breadiness.  T - Big hops with caramel to boot. Lot's of citrus fruit with some earthiness. Many layers make this quite complex. Citrusy grapefruit and pineapple are most of the layers for hop profile but there's also a nice breadiness with caramel to back it up.  M - Nice bitterness in the finish. Medium body with some chew and good carbonation.  O/D - A pretty solid example of the style. A good hop forward IPA that is nice to drink. Highly drinkable and well executed.,Bear Republic Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,93

Smell: Nice mixture of light citrus hops with a slightly sweet hint of malt.  Taste: Quite citrusy up front, followed by a much stronger flavor of malt than I am used to in a west coast IPA, and a nice and gentle bitter finish. These three elements combine to grant this beer a very well balanced taste.  Mouth feel: It goes down very smoothly with a small hint of carbonation that gives me a minor bubbly feeling in my mouth.  Overall: At first glance, this beer does not look spectacular, but everything beyond the look of it is actually pretty excellent. This is an easy drinking beer and I would have no trouble downing a few (assuming that I had more than one).",Bear Republic Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,93

Smell is of floral hops with a little sweet malt. Kind of missing that big west coast hop aroma.  Taste is like a red grapefruit in the beginning, then turns floral and a little sweet in the middle, finishes bitter and some what dry.  Tried this for the first time and was expecting a little more from a west coast IPA.

610,2751,BarryMFBurton,3.95,"Alright, this beer is on the Top 100, and I’ve been lusting after its supposedly refreshing hoppiness ever since I knew it existed. Thanks to tripelhops, I’m finally getting a taste. Thanks, dude!  A: Nice, hazy golden-amber color on this one. It’s a bit thicker than most IPA’s I’ve seen, but it’s not without a good shine. The head is a nice, white micro-bubbles, and the lacing is even more impressive; thin, webbed strands of film encircle the glass. Lovely look.  S: Much more malt-forward than I was expecting; they’re much stronger than the hops. Caramel and dark fruit come out big and syrupy first, much like a Belgian Dark Ale. If just given the nose, I don’t think I’d be able to identify this as an IPA. Light floral notes from the hops are just evident towards the end of the nose. Very mild, especially for a big Cali IPA, but the aromas are unique and inviting.  T: This one has an excellent base of plum and caramel-apple tastes in the malts; unexpectedly rich, but in the best way. Some hints of fruity sweetness make their way forward, to the tune of citrus and melon rind. The bitterness that shows up is mellow, never overtaking the main malts. They add some fruity tanginess that’s followed by a slow moment of alcohol warmth. It finishes out with some astringency, but there’s also some Sam Adams-style cheap grains, too. A unique palate, for sure.  M: Pretty thick for 7%. Very little carb leads this one to nowhere special, especially when you consider how much the aftertaste needed a distracting bit of pop.  O: Well, it’s far from perfect, but it’s damn tasty. I wouldn’t be surprised if this one were called a Belgian-Style IPA; it has that dark smell and malty flavor that I’d expect from an import. Very nice. It makes me even more excited for the Hop Rod Rye in my fridge!",Bear Republic Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,93

610,2751,spokeydonkey,4.3,"A - Pours a light copper color, with a finger of white head on top that sticks around for a while. The beer is unfiltered, so in addition to hop haze, there are tiny bits of hops suspended in it.  S - Quite a bit of floral and citrus hop aroma coming off it, with a definite alcohol aroma as well.  T - Exceptional taste. Just enough malt sweetness to balance out the bitterness. A solid toasted cracker flavor in the background to add compexity and amazing hop flavor coming through. I'm getting a lot of floral hops up front with strong grapefruit on the back end.  M - Medium-light body with a fair amount of alcohol heat present. Carbonation complements the beer but doesn't get in the way.  O - One of my favorite IPAs. The malt doesn't add much complexity, and it's not overly bitter, but the hop flavor and aroma is amazingly full.",Bear Republic Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,93

Carbonation levels look spot on. Looks tasty and refreshing.  S: Very light aroma for a West coast IPA. Lots of citrus and grapefruit hops, tropical fruits and an earthy, malt characteristic in the background. Subtle floral notes.  T: Similar to the aroma, but with more punch. Bitter up front with tons of citrus, mostly grapefruit, some tropical fruits like mango and apricot and a very subtle, bready malt backbone. Finishes dry and bitter with a prominent grapefruit flavor. Higher ABV is masked nicely, though it does come out a bit more as the beer warms.  M: Medium bodied with perfect carbonation. This brew packs a bit of substance and a nice amount of chewiness, keeping it drinkable and pleasant on the tongue. Very smooth.  O: As my introduction to this brewery, I was quite impressed. A prominent grapefruit hop profile lives up to the West coast IPA style and is sure to please hop enthusiasts, especially those (like me) that love citrus. I wouldn't call this a balanced brew, as the malts are very subtle and hardly noticeable, but it doesn't come off as overly bitter or overwhelming like some IPAs.

The nose comprises sweet flowers, light grass, greens, grapefruit zest, orange zest, lemon peel, and a few drops of honey in the background. The taste brings in more of the same, withe the citrus and greens really complimenting each other quite nicely. The malt is almost completely drowned-out, but the hops somehow don't o'erpower the tongue, even though they easily could.

Taste is mildly bitter, with more wonderful fruit (this time more pineapple-like) in the beginning. Sweetness comes out midway through, but remains constrained by the hops. Medium to slightly heavy mouthfeel. Perhaps a little under-carbonated. Ends on a bit of an herbal bitterness, but remains smooth.  Possibly one of my new favorite IPAs, this brew is complex but fantastically drinkable. Not excessively bitter by any means, it really showcases well the several different kind of hops involved.

610,2751,Pintofbrown,4.18,"Appearance: Cloudy body the color of mango, with dandelion highlights. Plenty of CO2 jetting to the cap. It started as a nice, frothy two finger head, but it has slowly dwindled to a film, leaving white lace sticking to the glass.  Smell: Lots of spice and hops. The hops err on the side of citrus. It is really crisp. Maybe lemon, a little orange, and even some musty lime flavor. Malts need not apply. A good IPA nose.  Taste: A zing of hop bitterness instantly sucks your cheeks in. Then there are the more subtle flavors. The hops are a little more on the wheat side, than citrus. There are hints of lemon bitterness and grapefruit mid swallow.  Once it starts rolling down the back of the throat, the cereal grain malt comes out and fills the mouth a bit. Good thing the hops bitterness is still there. They almost turn floral as they degrade.  Obviously a bunch of action in this drink. Is it good? You bet.  Mouth feel: I prefer my IPA's to be a little thicker than this, not even thicker, just creamy. This is more medium to light because of the higher carbonation. Not that it does not fit the style, just not how I enjoy it, and that is what counts ladies and gentlemen.  Overall: The head could stick around longer, but the body sure is pretty. It smells good, and it tastes good. Not many complaints there. Not sure why the hops need to be so grainy, just dump that aspect all together. And carbonation is a little too high, it is still a great IPA though.

A- A slightly hazy orange with little to no head. Mild Carbonation.  S- I could smell this beer the minute I opened it. Juicy juicy hops overcame the dinning room. Very citrus aroma with a subtle pine and resin in the back. Very little malt pick up  T- Not what I was expecting at $4.99 This beer is incredible. Right up there with Smuttynose and Ithaca Flower power. It reminded me specifically of flower power. The hop profile is very similar! Very delicious and has started to quench my thirst!  M- A little lighter than I would like or expect from a IPA. Perhaps they slimmed on the grain bill. No taste or smell or malt or grain. Very smooth and tingly from the mild carbonation. Overall a great mouthfeel. This is my first time having this and I put it down rather quick :)  Get this beer! You will love it, and if you paid what I did for it you will be in one of those WIN WIN situations! Cheers!",Bear Republic Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,93

Grapefruit with grass and pine mixed in. It smells cold and dry. Do not detect much if any malts on the initial pour, but they show themselves (only slightly) as the beer warms. As the brew warms, juicy pineapple presents itself.  T: Great hop flavor with a nice bite, gotta love it. The malts linger in the background to the citrus hop flavor. I get mainly grapefruit rind along with some of the pith. A bit of lemon zest. Very dry. Totally digging this brew.  M: Medium with soft carbonation. Just about perfect for me.  Hell yeah.

Present, but not 'too' much fruity/sweet flavors...The final pine/spice balances the beer out wonderfully!  D - This one is great!! I think what make this beer so good is the fine line of not over-doing 'it' in any particular area (hops, fruity-flavor, pine/spice, carbonation, and last but not least, alcohol level).

The hop finish is bitter, but not overpowering.  M - As is common with Bear Republic, this has a thick and smooth body, with a medium amount of carbonation.

610,2751,SpaceMadness,4.04,"A- Well, I'm drinking this out of my Arrogant Bastard bomber-turned-pint glass so I can't comment much on color. I can say that it appears to be fairly clear. The initial finger and a half cream colored head was all but dissipated by the time I rinsed out the bottle and deposited it to the ""To Be De-Labeled"" cupboard in the garage.  S- This is where Racer 5 begins to impress. Flowers, pine, orange zest, and honey. Very pleasant.  T- Not sure if this bottle got too cold in the fridge or if my taste buds are suffering from Double IPA overload, but the taste is a tad underwhelming after taking in the aroma for a few minutes. I expected just a little more of the pine resin tongue feel than what I experienced. With each passing minute it gets stronger so cold temp. is probably a big part of it.  M- A little thin. This too could be a result of cooler than ideal temps.  O- I've let it warm a bit to get a better grasp on the taste and mouthfeel. This is a tasty, high-quality American IPA. However, for the price in Ohio ($11) I think I'd grab a $9 half-rack of Smuttynose IPA before buying this again. If I came across it as the only IPA on tap at a bar, I'd probably end up spending a lot of money on it. Well worth a try.",Bear Republic Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,93

Pours a nice transparent golden/amber with a 1-finger white head. From a foot away I pick up that classic aroma of grapefruit and pineapple. Bring the glass closer to my nose and the aroma bursts out of the glass, all those great tropical aromas. There a faintly dank hop smell as well that I've picked up in a lot of IPAs.  Taste follows nose. Fruity, a little sweet, with some hops to balance things out. This is really a fine American IPA: neither overly hoppy nor overly sweet. Mouthfeel is very satisfying as well.  Overall I'm really happy with this beer. I could drink this again and again and may start regularly stocking my fridge with it.

610,2751,jondeelee,4.42,"Racer 5 makes its status as a high-IBU IPA known at the first whiff, which reveals strong grapefruit and pine notes, countered by the sugary rosewater smell that occasionally accompanies high levels of hops. A white grape aroma adds to the bouquet, partnered with apricots and peaches.  On the tongue, the beer is of course quite hoppy, the bitterness tasting of both grapefruit and pine notes (making this a fairly balanced IPA, as compared to those that only feature, say pine notes). But there is a good malt base beneath those hops, replete with strong brown sugar tastes, molasses, vanilla, lychee nut, and toasted pecans. These malty flavors last well into the mouthful, peeling back at the end to expose a sheer hop base, which dominates the aftertaste, and lingers for quite a while on the tongue. Mouthfeel is medium, and carbonation is medium to medium-high.  Overall, this is a good IPA, featuring strong, balanced, and flavorful hops. Beginners might find the intensity of these hops overpowering, but hop-heads will surely rejoice.",Bear Republic Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,93

Pine needles, fresh pineapple, sweet cereal grains, honey, and loads of orange zest and orange oils.  The taste is sweeter than expected (More sweet than Stone IPA). Lots of malt presence, but this is still a hop forward beer. Honey-coated pine needles, oily orange zest, caramel, more pine, more orange. Very smooth hop profile. No dominating harshness despite the high level of bitterness (Less bitter than Smutty Finest Kind).  The mouthfeel is on the moderately-full side.

610,2751,mocktm,4.5,"12 oz brown bottle with no bottling date, into my trusty Southampton pint glass.  Very aggressive pour yields a mountain of thick, jagged and sticky white head. Leaves an intricate web of lacing as it dissipates to a lasting film atop the beer. Boasts a glowing orange hue that just screams a boatload of citrus hops within. Ladies and gentlemen, this is what an IPA is all about.  Nose is a copious amount of grapefruit, lemon rind and pine. To be honest, that's exactly what I look for in IPAs; this is a hop-heads delight.  Taste doesn't disappoint in the least; an abundance of tropical fruit citrus accompanied by a biting and lasting hop bitterness. Slight floral and spice presence with a mild malt backbone. Just very very well balanced and absolutely phenomenal. Love me some west coast IPA.  Medium bodied with a clean, non-muddled flavor profile. Doesn't try to do too much, but what it does do, it does to perfection. Great session beer that drinks incredibly easy for something that clocks in at 7%.  I love this beer, and at around $10 a sixer year around, its nearly impossible to beat on the value front. Outside of Lagunitas, I really don't see how you can do much better.

610,2751,scotvega18,4.29,"Poured from a 12oz bottle into a Pint Glass  A - Poured a slightly hazy golden color with some yeast sediment and a thin off-white head. Standard for a bottle conditioned IPA.  S - Some great, great, sweetness and fruitiness. The classic ""Bear Republic spicy flare"" is in there, and works incredibly well with the overall citric mango, pineapple, and grapefruit in the beer.  T - Rather than being a ""classic west coast IPA"" that finishes dry and bitter, this starts out bitter and just builds to a fruity- and sweet flavor. The hops works so well with the malt that it ends up being very difficult to pull individual flavors out.  M - Nothing special, the carbonation helps the yummy nectar go down.  Notes - There are some who would choose to knock this beer for lack of complexity, but the truth is that this beer really is one of the great in the single-ipa department for how well everything is blanced and melds together. That may contribute to a lack of depth, but honestly, how complex do you want thing thing to be?

610,2751,tewaris,3.8,"75+ IBUs  12 oz., undated, poured into a shaker pint glass.  Pours amber-golden and relatively clear with a small bubbly head. Head retention can't really be commented upon with this head but some lacing is seen. Average looks, especially for an AIPA.  It's funny how the nose picks different notes at different samplings. When I had Racer 5 for the first time about an year ago, I picked strong tropical fruit notes typical to Centennial hops (Two Hearted Ale); now I pick a spicier note that is even stronger than the faint tropical fruit. The spice is nice and appealing, instead of borderline garlic. But, aroma is not the strong suit of this bottle (or beer?)  Taste is delicious in one word. Light, sweet frutiness and plenty of spicy to weedy character on a medium-low body with crisp carbonation and a clean finish. Let's nitpick now: the taste is slightly sweet for the body and the bitterness lacking at times: I expect IPAs to be bitter at the back of the palate and this one goes down without that ""kick"". However, there's bitter aftertaste aplenty to compensate.  I am really digging the clear, clean flavors; the crispness; and the dry finish that is not quite Duvel-like, but approaches it. Overall it's a good beer that doesn't wreck the wallet or the palate.

Lots of grapefruit/citrus hits you hard and a little bit of a bready character maybe, but very low on the malts.  Taste is a little different than smell. Some piney notes are a bit more powerful than the still present citrus tastes on the palate. Finish is a slight bitterness.  Mouthfeel is fairly light and good carbonation.

Loads of aromas of citrusy hops with just a tiny hint of roasted malts. It has a good sharp bite all the way through followed up with just enough sweet malts to smooth it out for a nice, crisp, clean finish with no harsh aftertaste; almost like a mixture of flavors of cotton candy and caramel lingering on the finish.

Good beer to keep around in the standard rotation as a better-than-average brew. Not quite top shelf, but really good. B- to D+: Okay to drink every once in a while, but not part of a standard rotation. Nothing special, but not offensive. D and below: Avoid this brew. Not worth drinking more than once, if only to experience the lower end of beer production.  A: Pours a cloudy orangy-gold (due to the sediment) with a half-finger cream colored head. Not much lacing.  S: Some citrusy aromas, traditional grapefruit/mango/etc. A decent enough smell, probably this brew's best characteristic.  T: Bitter grapefruity brew with some other underlying citrus flavors, without the balancing sweetness. One-dimensional flavor profile, but not offensive. Just nothing I would reach for again.  M: Watery mouthfeel, low carbonation. Doesn't refresh the palate.  O: A decent brew, but nothing more. Certainly one-dimensional, with the hops taking the lead from the start and never giving way to the malts. Bitter without being sweet, I didn't find much refreshment here.

Dull yellow-orange...Wikipedia suggests gamboge as the proper shade. Good lacing.  S: Mmm. Fruity. More tropical than citrus. Passionfruit? Mango. Some grapefruit as well. Very nice.  T/M: Hm. The second sip is better then the first. The tropical nature of the smell reasserts itself, along with a gently hopped maintaste. A touch carbonated, a touch malty-substantial, and very pleasant on the tongue. The aftertaste is lightly drying with a hint of resin. A well-balanced beer, successfully blending a heavily hopped flavour profile with fruit that doesn't overpower the strong body. Great American IPA.

610,2751,biegaman,4.18,"Racer 5 both smells and looks like a blend of pineapple, tangerine and papaya juice; it has yellow, orange and dark orange colours with a naturally cloudy complexion. Looking into the glass against the light reveals little visibility but plenty of bubbles. Its head is both bubbly and filmy - it looks like a coral reef with waves of lacing washed up against the glass.  As mentioned already, juicy notes of pineapple, tangerine and papaya stand out, but there are also lesser flavours of coconut, pine resin and tree bark. The malts - what little can be made out of them - are like honeyed-toasted biscuits, but their sweetness is no match for the bitter orange peel skin and apricot pits. It is also grassy, like an herbal tea laxative.  The best American IPAs have a candied-citrus taste and plenty of acidic citrus zest - that describes Racer 5 to a tee. This tastes like a fruit salad that combines under-ripe cantaloupe, lychee and papaya fruits, slices of mandarin and is topped with a lemon juice/white grapefruit vinaigrette and garnished with boiled, sweetened orange peel. Very fruity.  Candied, caramelized sweetness balances out a lot of the citric acidity, but doesn't cover up for the sugary, pineapple-tasting sweetness nor the trace of earthy, pungent, pine needle-like notes. This beer has such a resinous finish that no bready maltiness, no matter how supportive and noted it may be, conceals that fact. It's plenty refreshing as result.  I don't think the palm trees are as common when you get as north as Healdsburg, but this thing is tropical enough to serve with an umbrella garnish. That said, it is still a tremendously bitter beer and the combination of the two qualities makes this among the best of American IPAs, as good (and better than many) as any others produced in the Golden State.",Bear Republic Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,93
610,2751,magictacosinus,4.48,"THIS is the beer that not only got me into fresh, hoppy beers, but arguably craft brewing in general. It's one of my all time favorites and am happy to finally be reviewing it.  Poured into a pint glass from a 12oz bottle. No freshness date.  Appearance: A beautiful, bold amber-orange color with a small, foamy head.  Smell: Citrus, pine, and floral hops with very spicy and sweet aromas. It actually smells so good that it's reminiscent of standing in front of a large grove on a warm day.  Taste: With every sip, I'm in heaven. Where to start? The hops! They taste absolutely amazing here! Reminiscent of grapefruit and lime, they contain an initially strong bite on the tongue, yet in a mere second, the sensation passes and descends in an orangish fruity flavor. A lot of IPAs have a strong honey flavor in moments like those, yet here it is nothing but awesome fruity aftertastes. The malts in this beer further smoothen the drinking experience, and the relatively high alcohol content helps sweeten it further.  Mouthfeel: An IPA this powerful that is easy enough to drink does not come around often. It may hold lots of complex, dense flavors, but it's refreshing and blissfully relaxes the palate.  Overall: Quite possibly THE gentle giant of West Coast-style IPAs. While it has a huge full-bodied flavor, it does not overpower the senses. Its hops and malts are unreal, and the yeast used is fresh and delicious. An opportunity to drink this should never be passed by. If I remember well, it's also excellent on tap.  Postscript: This is why I need to read more and drink less. I absolutely had NO idea that bottled versions of this beer were bottle conditioned.

Hints of chili pepper spice & malt.  T ~ LOTS of tree resin with a heavy biscuit-malt backbone. Touch of grapefruit & honestly picking up vanilla & cocoa somehow. There's mango, orange peel, & spicy hops, as well. Booze.  M ~ Crisp & bitter, but it seems like it should have a higher ABV for the taste, as it is very ""hot."" I had to pour out the last 1/4, I just was not feeling the balance on this one. Too Resinous for a non-imperial IPA in my opinion.  D ~ It was poorly toeing the line between hop-bomb & malt balance. Boozy and very spicy, I was turned off but what they were going for with this one. As resinous as a IIPA without the cleverly masked ABV. Wouldn't recommend.",Bear Republic Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,93
610,2751,NODAK,4.17,"Aroma is definitely a strong pine resin smell...there is a sweet malt background there as well, but this definitely is a hoppy aroma.  Again, the initial taste is of piney, hoppy goodness which isn't a surprise considering the nose. There's a spicy, biscuit malt that appears in the middle with a medium-small intensity that makes itself known but certainly takes a backseat. Along with it, there's a small sweet, caramel presence as well. This is washed away by a pretty strong pine resin bitterness that prevails through the finish and allows it to end on a rather bitter note.  Pretty good IPA here. I like that there's some balance to it, but there isn't any mistake that it's a pretty hoppy one as well. I was in the mood for a more hop forward IPA, and this fit the bill.",Bear Republic Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,93
610,2751,MoreThanWine,4,"Poured a meager 1/4"" white head. Attractive hazy apricot orange and yellow in color. Smell and taste are both fairly mild but sweet and fruity. This is a much easier drinking IPA than so many of the other craft beers, but then again it doesn't have nearly the hoppy punch that real hopheads crave. Good but not outstanding. And might I add just one pint of this gave me quite a headache the next morning.",Bear Republic Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,93

Mostly hop presence.  T - The first flavor I get is the citrus hops, followed by malt, then a spicy hop flavor, and on the tale end pine. There is a lot of hop flavor.  M - Full, cloying, and a hop bitterness that lingers for a good long while.  O - A great example of a AIPA. Really tasty.",Bear Republic Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,93

Color is a rich golden orange with heavy presence of carbonation and yeast from bottle conditioning. Overall striking and beautiful.  S - bright citrus nose, with strong grapefruit notes and slight earthy pine.  T/M - Strong hop character at first with lasting bitterness to the end of the swallow and then some. Citrus hops give way to a malty background that provides a perfect balance making this beer easy to drink and smooth for such a brilliant IPA.  O - One of my favorite IPAs so far. So smooth and drinkable for how brilliant the hop character is. Highly recommended brew.",Bear Republic Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,93

610,2751,Alieniloquium,3.94,"22 oz. bottle poured into two pint glasses.  Appearance - The first glass was a clear golden color with a decent white head. The second was almost murky, despite not pouring the last half inch of beer. Neither beer retained the head well and neither exhibited very impressive lacing.  Smell - Floral hops with some citrus. Not really as strong of a hop aroma as I was looking for. I don't get a lot of malt, despite that it isn't a wave of hops drowning out everything else.  Taste - Citrus hops and a bit of pine followed by malt. Again, not strong hops, but present. The malts are the slightest bit sweet with some toastiness. In the finish is an ample bitterness.  Mouthfeel - It's about right for a single IPA. Not a lot of body, but just barely enough for the bitterness to linger. The other flavors are gone almost instantaneously, though.  Overall - I wasn't all that impressed. I had high hopes, but the hop presence just wasn't there.",Bear Republic Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,93

Smells like orange, pineapple, passion fruit, mango, some pineyness in the secondary. Delicious, clean aromas. Tastes is a little more pine forward, with orange and pineapple, a moderate dose of malt, and a long, moderately bitter finish. Medium bodied, medium carbonation, slightly oily. Overall, this is a great everyday IPA: good taste, great value.",Bear Republic Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,93
610,2751,Tucquan,4.25,"Had this on 2011-03-09 at the Drafting Room in Exton, PA and many times since, including a couple times at the brew pub in Healdsburg, CA. Had it most-recently on 2018-07-14 in Columbia, PA from a relatively-fresh 12-oz bottle. Bear Republic hasn't distributed to PA for 6 years but it just came back last week, so it is quite a treat to have Racer 5 again on my home turf!  Notes from 2018-07-14: Doggone, I'd forgotten how good this beer is. West Coast IPA for sure with some welcome malt/caramel to somewhat-balance the piney/grapefruit bitterness. Just lightly dank. Tons of citrus and an earthy/ holiday/potpourri spicy element that really works well. Killer beer!  Below are the notes from my original review from 2011-03-09.  A - Almost clear straw-amber with a 1.5 finger, pillowy head with good lacing.  S - Light citrus pulp, pine, biscuit and hop floral. Not overly strong.  T - Grapfruit, biscuit, mild caramel, pine, naval orange sweetness, which quickly yields to the grapefruit.  M - Light to medium body and carbonation (more than I expected on-cask). Smooth and a little prickly.  D - Very good. I subsequently had it in the tasting room at the brewery and it was magnificent.",Bear Republic Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,93

Sweet malts backed by sticky hop sap for the scent. Mmm. Thats a goodin. Sweet malt start gets dominated by a nice thick blend of hops. Citrusy, oily, flowery, bitter. This brews for the hop-lovers. Medium bodied and smooth. Lovely drink.",Bear Republic Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,93
610,2751,Dieseljaxx,4.67,"Bear Republic rarely disappoints. They are one of the most consistent breweries going and definitely have an appreciation for hoppy beers. This beer has a wonderful color, smells delicious and the taste meets those expectations. This is a tasty IPA that provides that crisp hoppiness you get with a good IPA but doesn't overwhelm the palate. This beer is very drinkable and should be consumed often.",Bear Republic Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,93
610,2751,byteme94,2.56,"I bought this beer on vacation and had very high hopes. Split between myself and two other avid beer enjoyers.  All of us were in agreement that it was just an okay IPA. Poured into tulips, very minimal head. Appearance was nice with a darker orange/amber color.  Taste was not fully there, hops on the front not too citrusy and tastes left mouth almost as soon as I swallowed it.  All were in agreement it was just okay - and being able to have the option to try anyother IPA blindly in front of us over that one would do so.",Bear Republic Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,93
610,2751,FatBoyGotSwagger,4.42,"I poured it into my pint glass. It has a dark golden amber appearance.  The first smell that jumps out at me is some resinous piney hops, there are some sweeter hops to balance it but the resinous bitter hop smell is pronounced at 40 degrees.  The taste is glorious, lots of hops. It starts fruity floral but finishes bitter and resinous. I would say It is perfectly balanced.  The mouth feel is pretty light, for all the flavor Racer 5 goes down pretty easy.  As it warms up it becomes more enjoyable.  Overall I knew this was a fresh bottle and when fresh this is a must try IPA.",Bear Republic Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,93
610,2751,boudreaux,4.73,"Appearance: Racer 5 pours a deep golden color with hints of red along the edges. A nice thick foamy off-white head that built up to 3 fingers and stayed there for quite a while. Quite clear in my pint glass. smell: The aroma seemed to leap out at me. It had a wonderful hop bouquet. It was piney, floral and citrusy. As expected, the first sip or two was bitter with a drying effect on the end. Taste: the blend of malts, hops and yeast gave this beer a nice crisp taste. Bear Republic put in a generous amount of Columbus and Cascade hops into this beer but held back from going too far with the IBUs. I could pick up an underlying sweetness of the malts when not inhaling as I sipped. But just as soon as I breathe in, the hop sensation nearly masks the sweetness of the grains. Mouthfeel: smooth and creamy with a full bodied texture.",Bear Republic Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,93
610,2751,zeledonia,4.15,"Bottled 4 June 2011. Enjoyed 1 July 2011, and reviewed from notes.  Pours a light, yellowish amber with a solid off-white head that lasts and leaves really good lacing. Streams of bubbles showing off the carbonation.  Smell is full of great hop flavors, mostly pine with a bit of citrus.  Taste is all about hops (mostly pine), with decent malt backing. But definitely hop-forward. Starts out full and slightly sweet, then comes on bitter and piney with some citrus (orange peel and grapefruit), and stays bitter through the finish. The malt flavors aren't on display, but their presence gives the beer a good platform for the hops to stand on.  Mouthfeel is great - medium-bodied, a little sticky but not too much so, smooth, well-carbonated, and a great persistent finish.  A very tasty, mostly hoppy IPA, with great pine and subtle citrus flavors. Not overpoweringly bitter, but really brings the tasty aromatics out of the hops.

This is one of my favorite west coast ""gems"".  A: Pours a hazy golden color with a wonderful lively frothy white head on top. Some ""pancake batter"" bubbles in the middle. I like that.  This brew is leaving great lacing on my glass as I work through it.  S: Grapefruit and pine in the nose. Moderate intensity.  T: Taste follows the nose. Taste starts smooth before grapefruit rushes in. This beer strikes a great balance, with just the right amount of sweet malt backbone behind to balance things out. It finishes wonderfully bitter, with a hint of pine, and yes, even MORE grapefruit goodness.  M: Light and lively, this beer has just the right level of carbonation, feels light in the mouth, and coats the tongue nicely with hop oils.  D/O: Drinkability is High. Very high. I love this beer.

610,2751,StoutHunter,4.43,"I bought a bottle of Racer 5 India Pale Ale a couple days ago for $1.69 at The Lager Mill. I was impressed with my first beer from Bear Republic, Hop Rod Rye, So I decided to see what else they are working with and picked up a bottle of Racer 5, so lets see how it goes. No visible bottling date. Poured from a brown 12oz bottle into a imperial pint glass.  A- The label looks good and keeps with the vintage car racing scheme that Hop Rod Rye had. It poured a orange/golden yellow color with three fingers worth of fluffy white head that died down to a thick layer that stayed the rest of the time.  S- The aroma is pretty much dominated by the hops in this beer. It's got three different hoppy aromas going on. First is the citrus with pineapple sticking out the most along with a little bit of mango, orange zest, and grapefruit. The second was pine which imparted some dank and resiny aromas. The third was floral hops which isn't as strong as the other two but adds a nice subtle complexity to the aroma. The hops took over the aroma so I really couldn't pick up any of the malts in the aroma.  T- The malts actually come through in the flavor and to me they taste like a mixture of pale and caramel malts that make for a nice base for this beer and it has just the right amount of sweetness. The hops are still the major player here, just like they should be. At first I pick up a good amount of pineapple along with a little bit of orange zest. The pney and floral hops come out on the finish along with some grapefruit to make for a nice medium amount of bitterness that fits this beer perfectly.  M- Smooth, slightly dry, and meduim bodied with just the right amount of carbonation, the mouthfeel is just right for an IPA.  Overall I thought this was a pretty good IPA. The hops are there in abundance and are pretty assertive and combine citrus, pine, and floral hops together to make for a great hop profile that is balanced well and doesn't completely overshadow the malt base like it did in the aroma. Everything was pretty spot on in this IPA and I liked the drinkability and mouthfeel the most with the rest being almost as good, if I had another one I would drink it, it hits the spot on this warm summer night. I would buy this beer again, I like how it combined the different aspects of hops together rather then just focusing one aspect. I recommend this beer to any hop head or IPA lover, it will calm your hop cravings. This was another home run for Bear Republic, now I feel like I have to try the rest of their lineup since everything I have had from them so far has been very well done.",Bear Republic Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,93

The taste is balanced by a sweet malt backbone with hints of citrus. In the tail end of the beginning the rest of the way through there is an earthy hop bite, not a huge bitter bite, but a nice and smooth hop bite. The mouthfeel is moderately carbonated.

(First real review so forgive me if I don't know what I'm talking about!) Flavor overall is hoppy, fresh, and clean. Some citrus and hop resin flavor and aroma up front, hoppy and fruity in the body with a full but unmuddled flavor. Mouthfeel is full and thick for an IPA, sticks to your mouth just the right amount. Finish is clean and satisfying with lighter non-bitter sweetness of fruit and hop, very nice.  Overall this is an excellent IPA with a full on confident hop flavor, that's very easy to drink and not overwhelming. It's a great balance and I think close to ideal for an IPA to me.

A - clear (top of bottle) becoming hazy (bottom of bottle) golden with creamy white head that, as is typical for IPAs, has limited retention.  S - strong aroma of hops; fresh, piney/sprucy, floral and nicely complex. There's probably some roasted malt lurkering in the aroma too, but the hops just jump out.  T - Frankly, the strong piney hop aroma, while very pleasant, is a bit forbidding as it suggests an intensely bitter and piney taste. Such is not the case. This is a refreshing, easy-to-drink IPA that has modestly strong hop flavor together with a quite strong aroma. Moderately bitter grapefruit/pine finish and aftertaste. Very nice!  M - good body and carbonation  O - an outstanding Amer. IPA, particularly suitable for those who prefer a strong aromatic contribution from hops more than a strong flavor or pronounced bitterness.

S - Grapefruit! And some sugary sweetness. The two balance each other quite well. Also present are some citrusy/floral hops that compliment the battle going on in the front. Excellent aroma on this beer.  T - Once again, very grapefruit forward. Like I've just taken a sip of juice once I swallow. Balanced by that nice sugar sweetness and just a tinge of alcohol burn. Citrus also in the background. Finish is very balanced and stays on the tongue for a while.  M - Mouthfeel is good. High carbonation and medium creaminess.

The taste was also much hoppier than I expected it to be, lots of citrusy pine flavors that fade into a strong bitter aftertaste. The mouthfeel is very drinkable. Overall this beer kicks ass.

A finger of white head forms and then fades to a thin layer on the top of the beer. Moderate amount of lacing on the glass as I drink it.  S - Piney, resinous hop aroma is most noticeable with undertones of honey sweetness. Overall, not an extremely pungent beer though.  T - Creamy, malty sweetness up front that's almost honey-like in it's smoothness. The bitterness, piney-ness and citrus peel character of the hops hits hard in the middle and lasts through to the aftertaste. This is unlike any IPA/APA I've ever had, honestly. I've never experienced something so smooth and drinkable (a by-product of the bottle-conditioning) yet still maintaining the über-hoppy presence that one hopes for in this style.

The flavor is pretty good, but a little let down from what the nose made me believe I was going to experience. The citrus hops are the first thing I notice, but the floral hops take over the flavor on the back of the tongue and flow into the aftertaste.  Has a very smooth and full body.

Big, crisp, piney hops, but with a slightly sweet maltiness---I get orange with maybe a little brown sugar.  Mouthfeel- Smooth, with a nice, long lingering of the malt.  If you like Lagunitas, Stone, and other big West Coast IPAs, I'd recommend this one, and like these other representatives, it has a substance to back up the hop punch.

610,2751,Roke87,3.76,"12 oz. bottle, chilled and poured into a Duvel tulip  Appearance- Pours a very hazy golden yellow, average pour yields a tiny half a finger of white head that very quickly dissipates to a very small ring that does leave lots of lacing throughout the glass till finish.  Smell- light hop aromas mixed with some pine as well, fruity grapefruit citrus aromas as well and a strong malt smell dominate the aromas.  Taste- Just like the smell this one is not overpowered by the grapefruit and hop although it is much more present in the taste, on the contrary the malts take over this one from the start then give way to a resiny pine flavour mixed with that citrusy hop flavour as well. Finishes kind of sweet and a bit bitter with more of that bready malt flavour in there.  Mouthfeel- Light to medium bodied with below average to almost no carbonation in sight, this is a crisp and easy drinking IPA, and finishes a little dry though.  Overall- To be honest this beer was overhyped a little too much by my go to liquor store guy, I guess I was expecting more from it although it was not bad in anyway at all. There is a big hop presence although not overpowered and equally balanced by a nice malty flavour. I would pick this one up again although I would not go out of my way to get it, happy I tried and didn’t overpay for it but unless it was under $8 a six pack I don’t think I would revisit it, there’s just too many other east coast IPA’s that are miles ahead of this one.",Bear Republic Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,93

Bitter orange peel with a backbone of pine.  T: Again most of the flavor comes from hops. The citrus flavors are more detailed, with grapefruit being more pronounced. There is a very light malt backbone which does little to balance the hop bitterness. Bitterness and a pronounced alcohol flavor make up most of the aftertaste.  M: Dry and light with a noticeable alcohol feel.  O: A fairly decent IPA. Very hop oriented",Bear Republic Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,93
610,2751,Yagman3000,4.15,Poured from a bottle into a snifter.  Appears an orange gold with a dissipating head.  Smells and tastes like a hop bomber - I feel like it must be Cascade hops because of the grapefruit and pine.  Mouthfeel is nice with a hop blast and a smoother finish than I'd expect.  I'd grab this again but I think they're hop rod rye has a bit more going for it... Lots of hops with a balance of rye.,Bear Republic Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,93
610,2751,alf212,4.05,Pours a hazy golden yellow. Small but persistent head.  Smells florally with a buncha citrus  Tastes like the nose with a little malt coming in the middle. Bitterness is moderate and leaves a nice aftertaste. It's more citrusy than florally taste wise  Mouthfeels nice n slick nearly chewy. Goes down easy  Overall good IPA. Typical flavors done well,Bear Republic Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,93
610,2751,drummermattie02,3.82,"Yellowish orange; a bit hazy but with good carbonation and a thick head that shrunk to about a finger and stuck around for the whole point.  Smell is citrus forward, with a small amount of malts in the background -- seems to be a fresh keg.  Good hop bitterness with a lot of the same grapefruit flavors from the smell. Very minimal malt body, at least to my tongue. Alcohol is not noticeable at all, which is nice.  Lighter-bodied, which isn't necessarily a bad thing, but I found myself wishing for a bit more substance.  Overall a good beer.",Bear Republic Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,93
610,2751,BEERMILER12,4.38,"A: Pours a nice golden yellow with about 1/2 an inch of head taht dies down fairly quickly  S: Some nice citrusy hops along with some malts. I'm guessing this is pretty fresh because there is certainly no lack of hoppy goodness in the nose  T: All of the same, very nice grapefruit and orange notes from the hops that are balanced nicely by the malts. Deliciously hoppy for sure. Alcohol is barely noticed, nicely done for a 7% brew  M: Light-medium body with a decent amount of carbonation. Not too slick and oily and not too carbonated, which is a nice mix  O: This is definitely a fine brew that I would associate more with the East Coast than Cali, but it is delicious for sure",Bear Republic Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,93
610,2751,WillCarrera,4.1,"A- Pours a hazy, amber honey color with a half-finger thick layer of sticky, white head.  S- Big blast of citrus and floral, just slightly piney hops. Not a lot else is going on in the nose, but its very clean and simple and smells like it's going to be a refreshing beer.  T- Lots and lots of hops, in a really delicious, not beating you over the head with it way, it's very well done. Hops are nice and bitter with floral and hop oil notes, lasting well into the finish. Hops are accompanied by loads of fruity citrus. Malts are light but do a good job of evening things out.  M- Medium bodied, very very smooth and just a bit chewy at the end. Great carbonation.  O- A solid IPA, very drinkable for 7.00% ABV, you seriously don't even notice it, drank another one of these while I was barbecuing some brats this afternoon, a great, refreshing summer beer.  Also a testament to the tried and tested wisdom that car-themed beers are usually good.",Bear Republic Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,93
610,2751,bbkd3b,4.02,"Poured into a pint glass.  Hazy body hits the glass with a color of hazy gold, with yeast just floating in the bottle. The conditioning is pretty obvious. Nice, 1/2 finger white head with good retention gets fed by the bubbles that keep floating to the top of the glass, taking an aromatic citrus scent with it. Nose has a nice balance in the hops department, with a lot of citrus and spruce scents brought along for the ride. Any malty tones are downplayed or covered up by the strand of yeast in the glass.  Heavy, thick body carries the hops on the tongue in a beautiful way. Lemon dances on the tongue while a bitter kick shifts towards the back. Really even character at first. As it warms, a slightly sweet underbelly appears to round things off. Alcohol is effectively covered up, and the finish is clean and easy.  Overall/notes - Really good IPA! The flavor, while perhaps a bit unbalanced, is spot-on in its citrusy tones. This makes me eager to dive into my bottle of Hop Rod in the fridge!",Bear Republic Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,93
610,2751,depechemode1983,4,"A - Pours a nice looking golden orange color. Head is like sea foam with excellent retention. Lots of sticky lacing as well.  S - The smell is mostly of bitter piny and citrus hops. A good amount of grains are noticeable as well along with fruits like apricots and sweet oranges.  T - Not as bitter as anticipated however very well balanced between hop bitterness and malt sweetness. Right away you get a fruity sweetness at the tip of your tongue which is immediately followed by grapefruit bitterness that takes the taste all the way to the finish. Pretty straight forward and simple but very delicious.  M - Medium bodied, smooth with some nice tingling carbonation. I dig it.  O - This is a straight up good beer. Very well balanced IPA. Well worth the 10 dollars I spent on the six pack.",Bear Republic Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,93
610,2751,OBeerMeGreatOne,3.93,"Surprised that I haven't reviewed this yet. 22oz poured into a Vertical Jewbelation glass. Orange, slight haze due to bottle conditioning and some noticeable carbonation. The head starts pretty nice but quickly goes the way of the ghost, nice lacing though. I smell some yeasty fart, fresh cut grass, citrus (orange rind and slight grapefruit.) Bready malts follow. The taste follows the smell very well, minus the fart yeast. I really like the grass/citrus hop combo, nicely backed by pale malts. Super nice going down. I grab a couple bombers a month. It's a nice, affordable, West Coast IPA, and super easy to find. Just tried their Hop Rod Rye which I liked (and will review later). Go Bear Republic.",Bear Republic Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,93

Hazy appearance as a result of the yeast, looks nice though, no chunky floaters. Whippy head, amazing lace. Smells a-freakin-mazing. Big, sharp citrus nose from the 4 C's (cascade, chinook, centennial and columbus). The nose on this is incredible. Taste follows, perfect hit of carb that tickles the tongue, then smooths out on the finish.  Overall this is an IPA for IPA lovers.

610,2751,Fillpott,4.18,"I poured this beer into a Gulden Drak tulip glass hoping to focus the smell better. I cooled the beer to 45 degrees, and when it poured, it had a finger's worth of off-white head that left a faint lace on my glass. The smell was a very mellow citrus smell, like OJ from concentrate at room temperature. I wasn't beaten over the head with the hops, and I liked it. When I drank it, the whole beer seemed balanced. It was one of the few times that I wasn't focused on one specific aspect of the beer, and that made it extremely drinkable.",Bear Republic Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,93
610,2751,magine,4.38,"Poured into a nonic.  Pours a dirty sediment filled cloudy light golden orange. Has a massive sticky near white head. Nice think layer stays the whole time and some real good sticky lacing. Very nice looking stuff here.  Brew smells of floral, citrus, herbs and earthy. Good smelling brew.  Brew is creamy smooth; floral hops, citrus and herbs. Hops are juicy and resiny. A very quenching brew, the middle is smooth and is balanced nicely by the malty flavors, maybe caramel. A nice sweet flavor in here as well. The brew finishes slightly dry and has some mild bitterness. This is top shelf flavors and drinking here.  Wow a go to IPA. One of the best out there for sure.",Bear Republic Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,93
610,2751,Trevor33,4.09,"Nose is a complex blast of musty grass malts and orange blossom hops. Tawny amber color, cloudy like cider, looks moderately malted.  Well balanced IPA starts with watermelon candy notes quickly building to a solid bitter hop middle that mellows to a citric fruity finish.

The tase is overwhelmingly crisp. Not as good as Pliny the Elder, but amazing close. Well defined citrusy/piney hops.. and a nice malt undertone...  Mouthfeel is exactly what you'd expect from an IPA... smooth and sticky hops on the backend...  Drinkability is off the charts...

Good looker, only better with clarity.  S: malt, pine, resin, citrus, grapefruit, rinds, honey. Huh, better than I had anticipated. Plenty going on here. Good nose.  T: Plenty sweet. Caramel malts, pine, resin and citrus hops on the profile. hints of cotton candy and bubble gum. I've had this beer many times, but have not taken the time to actually assess the profile. Much better than I recall.  M: Medium to heavy body for the style. Low carbonation. Dry finish. Would prefer a little lighter on the body. Otherwise, nice.  O: well crafted brew. Diamond in the rough for me.

610,2751,gkunkle,4.17,"Pours a slightly hazy orange-ish color with some visible carbonation. Head is about 1 finger tall, retention is moderate, but it leaves some lacing. Smell is of sweet citrus with a bit of a floral smell. I am impressed with the taste of this beer, citrus is highlighted well while still retaining a malt balance. The floral and citrus hops come out at the beginning, but the citrus isn't sweet like the smell. Towards the end of the drinkni get some of that malt balance that helps regulate this beer so well. Mouthfeel is just below medium, and carbon is appropriate. Overall this is a good IPA, if I lived in Cali I'd definitely drink it regularly, but I've already got Portland beers.",Bear Republic Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,93

M: A touch of heat and slightly rough around the edges and a hint of alcohol heat is present, but i am being nit picky  D: This is one of my favorite IPAs. its pretty sessionable because of the light body, but the hoppiness is very present without being overwhelming",Bear Republic Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,93
610,2751,AmericanGothic,3.97,"Poured from a 12 oz bottle into a pint glass. Bottled on 03/01/11.  A: Pours a hazy honey orange. One finger of off white head dissipates pretty quickly. Some lace. Carbonation looks odd-- some of the bubbles seem to be suspended rather than working their way toward the top.  S: Light, sweet orange and peach aromas. Mellow but good.  T: Interesting. The hops are a very thin pine that is almost more a feel than a flavor. They are, however, persistent. A steady but light malt sweetness underneath balances the hops well. After a while, the hops and malt combine into more of a grapefruit flavor. Understated, but good.  M: Light mouthfeel with some creamy qualities.  O: A nice IPA, good but not great, plenty refreshing for a warm spring day. Would buy it again, if only it were available in Iowa. An easy drinker whose flavor stays alive until the end of the glass.",Bear Republic Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,93
610,2751,Emerson1310,4.33,"Great appearance, cloudy and deep gold. Head and lacing were minimal, maybe because I had it super-cold.  The aroma is good, hoppy and fruity.  The taste is great! Kind of like a mini Pliny, with nice fruity, hoppy flavors and a smooth finish with no hop-bitterness build-up, and no honey flavor to mask the fruit/hops.  I will buy more of this to enjoy this summer!!",Bear Republic Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,93

T: Same fruity/floral hop flavors up front with a good amount of malt to balance it all out. Slight bitter twang on the end.  M: Slightly creamy, medium bodied, somewhat light on the carbonation, extremely drinkable.  O: For a standard IPA, it doesn't get much better than this. Perfectly balanced and hoppy in all the right ways. This is the kind of IPA that you keep coming back to.",Bear Republic Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,93
610,2751,BBP,4.38,"A- Pours golden amber with sediment and then some. Not maintaining the most incredible head, but holding onto what it has. Nice lacing as well.  S- Citrus and caramel malt. Considerably floral. A slight hint of alcohol sharpness.  T- Not as bitter as you would expect from the aroma. It brings bitterness to the table, but it's not abrasive in any way. The caramel malt is there to balance it, but it doesn't dare take away from the hops. All in all it has a very clean and crisp taste and seems to maintain balance while dumping hop flavor all over your taste-buds.  As you progress about halfway through this, some pine becomes evident in the aftertaste. It even gets a bit of a buttery finish. Sadly, the aftertaste seemed to diminish for me towards the end of this.  M- Medium body. Fairly creamy, slightly dry, and slightly sticky. A slight prickle from the alcohol and the carbonation.  D- Extremely drinkable, and very balanced. A pretty good example of a west coast style IPA. Almost in the center between IPAs and DIPAs. While I always tend to try brews I haven't had before, I'm sure sooner or later I'll come back and get a bit more of this.",Bear Republic Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,93
610,2751,timers,4.94,"This beer is the peak of the ""California IPA"" style of brewing and is without a doubt a best in genre brew. Like other beers in the class, it pushes the hops and alcohol content to a very high level, however this beer restrains enough to still preserve the delicious taste left from the wort. Although it doesn't punch you with alpha acids it does pique your tongue with more than a little enthusiasm. For West Coast emigres, it's a reminder of everything good about beers in the Golden State and the influence of all the ingredients.  Now available in some East Coast locations, hopefully more soon!",Bear Republic Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,93

I get grapefruit, pine, and sweet grass on the nose, and it is slightly perfume-y (but not in a bad way).  Lower carbonation than many other comparable brews. The citrus isn't as pronounced in the taste as in the nose. I get some bready notes and a slight bit of dried fruit in the taste, as well as continued pine and grapefruit.  Overall, a delicious beer that I would love to smell every day.

Good hoppy aroma. Mostly grapefruit, slightly minty. Has a nice acidic twang from the fruity hops. I'd like the malts to play a bigger part in the taste, but that's a minor gripe. Overall a good IPA if that's what you're in the market for.",Bear Republic Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,93
610,2751,Sevoking,4.75,"12 oz bottle poured into tulip glass.  I was first taken back how little carbonation it had. Too a point that I thought something may be wrong. No need to worry, though...it was there & in perfect balance. Color was a mild copper w/ loads of particles floating throughout. Smell was pleasantly citrusy. The taste was complex to say the least. I was expecting to be blown away by bitterness, but the hoppiness was well-balanced w/ a smooth, citrusy aftertaste. I could barely even detect any alcohol content. Each drink left me w/ wanting more. Unlike some IPA's that overwhelm you w/ bitterness to where you might stop at one 12oz, Racer 5 leaves you wanting more.  Definitely would try this again.

Thick and chunky lacing. Mediocre visible carbonation. Bottle conditioned, although no visible sediment.  Smell: Very nice citrus/floral aromas on the nose. Nice hop/malt balance. Smells a little like buttered bread in the background. A little on the sweet side.  Taste: Wow! This beer is amazingly balanced. The bitterness is there, but it's not overwhelming. Toasted biscuit notes take up the rear while grapefruit, pine, spice, and other citrus notes take the lead. On the sweeter side as IPAs range. The finish is comprised of lemon notes accompanied by butter. I think this would pair very well with baked haddock sprinkled with buttered bread crumbs and lemon juice.  Mouthfeel: Medium bodied with average carbonation. Not dry, and not oily. It's right in the middle where a beer belongs.  Ending notes: This is one of my favorite IPAs. It's on the complex side, and it's very sessionable. I will definitely be getting this one again.",Bear Republic Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,93

The nose is pine and citrus based but not overpowering.  Taste is compact and clean with nice balance. Flavorful but not overwhelming bitterness has heavy tints of pine against a solid amber malt backbone. The whole package is neat and well crafted. Alcohol is hinted at but is nigh undetectable. Carbonation could maybe be tweaked down a notch but its hardly a problem.  For seven percent this is extremely drinkable and satisfying. Also for only five bones for a 22 oz this is good value .,Bear Republic Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,93

Taste: Hoppy bitterness hits you right up front, but it's very well-balanced with sweetness and a strong citrusy flavor, maybe some grapefruit.

Very intense complexity, but something just amazing to partake in. Grapefruit and pineapple in the nose. The flavor is just something to behold. It's indeed hop centered lots of orange and grapefruit but there is also this unique malty oak background. The cask makes this stuff dangerously drinkable. It's really a great beer.

610,2751,ludachris,4,"Its peachy orange body is very murky. Some hop haze could account for this but it's mostly due to the bits of sediment suspended from top to bottom in the beer. A finger's worth of white bubbly head recedes quickly to a thin ring but leaves ample amounts of patchy lace as it does so.  Overly ripe pineapple with healthy doses of candied grapefruit give the nose a tropical punch. Papaya adds an extra layer of sweetness while sublte earthy hops make sure it doesn't get too out of hand. Caramel drizzled toast is far in the back, barely showing itself but with its presence, the beer stays true to the staple characteristics of the style.  Pineapple and mango dance along the tongue as soon as it enters the mouth. The bitter hop component to this beer, which follows right after, surprised me. It's more floral, spicy and well rounded instead of overly pronounced and tropical. Toasty malts with a sweet edge do almost too well at keeping the floral hop bitterness tamed in the finish. I purchased this only a week and a half ago from Premier Gourmet in Buffalo but I wonder if this IPA is still at its best.  Light to medium bodied. Smooth with a light creaminess. A great balance is struck throughout but great balance between malt and hops isn't what I look for in an AIPA. The carbonation is unobtrusive, clean, and does well at making this beer refreshing.  All around, this is a very good AIPA. I do like a more assertive hop presence in this style but I am iffy on how fresh this is. As already stated, I purchased this at PG on a shelf at room temp. I would love to try this knowing it was fresh and will take the opportunity if it presents itself.

610,2751,DelMontiac,4.05,"I was glad to have finally caught up with Racer 5 at Goebel Liquor in Wichita, KS. Poured from a 12 Oz brown bottle into an Imperial pint glass.  A careful pour yields a clear rather pale gold color with lots of tiny pure white bubbles producing a 2 finger head. Lace is sticky, thick, and everywhere leaving a new tier with each gulp.  Aroma is good old American West Coast IPA - citrusy fresh hop bombs with underlying mildly sweet malt.  Huge in taste as well. Grapefruit/fresh hop bombs from the getgo. That continues on through the finish followed up by some dainty sweet toasted maltiness and a faint buiscuity premonition lingers. They must really load this stuff with the cascade and centenial hops as they totally infiltrate the senses.  I really like the feel of this IPA - full bodied and smooth. Carbonation is spot-on.  This is a winner. I'll buy it again without hesitation.",Bear Republic Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,93
610,2751,tubacharlie,3.82,"A fresh hop aroma with citrus notes emanates from the half liter glass mug as the white, one-finger head subsides to a skim, with lacing stuck to the sides.  The brew is a burnt orange color, clouded by a hazy suspension of micro particulate.  Drawing a good mouthful reveals more citrus up front, with not as much hop bitterness as the aroma suggested. Some Pale Ales have as much hop presence, but this offering has enough alcohol content to make the IPA grade. Brisk carbonation pulls the alcohol esters to the nose, allowing the lightly malted grain flavor to peek through.  Not a top-of-the-line IPA, nor as good as the in-house draft, but worth the price of admission.",Bear Republic Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,93

Nice texture, you can definitely see the sediment floating around in the glass.  S: Smells incredible, grapefruit is really prominent as well as a lot of floral notes with underlying hop aroma. I could just smell this beer all day.  T: Citrus, a nice tang of grapefruit but an enjoyable sweetness of an orange or tangerine right off the bat, but with a nice amount of hop flavor, amply bitter, but really balanced.  M: Crisp and sharp at the start. Carbonated, yet more emphasis on the full texture. Super smooth going down.  O: Really amazing brew, certainly one of the best IPAs from California, and it's on tap pretty much everywhere I've been that has a decent beer menu here in LA. Really top notch beer and I am looking forward to finishing this 6 pack this week.",Bear Republic Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,93
610,2751,yesferro,4.72,"Got this in a surprise box from an BA'er here who's screen name I don't know.  Pours a light orange with a little bit of head, beautiful! Smells very citrussy, little hoppy but overal extremely inviting. Tastes so many things at once, buttery, citrus, hoppy ooo this is nice! There is an alcohol kick toward the end that I didn't expect but it's not bothersome at all. Overal a great beer, wish we could get it in MS!",Bear Republic Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,93
610,2751,malty,4.12,"This just became available in Mid-MI a few weeks ago in 6-packs as it's been available on draft for a couple/few months though. After having it on draft last month, I'm glad to have a sixer for home.  Poured into a std. nonic pint glass a dingy gold color with lots of teeny-tiny suspended particles. The off-white head settles to 1/2"" with a craggy, creamy and somewhat loose texture. A moderate amount of large-bubbled uprising carbonation is visible. Gobs of globs in the lace dept. A lacy massacre all over the inside walls of the glass.  The scent is heavenly. Lots of citrus, grapefruit rind cascade hops captivate the nostrils. Succulent, fresh and perfectly pungent. Bright, lemon zest and other zesty citrus fruit blast a beautiful bouquet that my nose just keeps going back for.  Very bitter and lush aforementioned hop goodness keeps rolling along. This time a more earthy, rustic element takes a more dominant role in the flavor area. I was surprised at how quickly the flavor drops-off as I was trying to discern the different nuances and characteristics. A bit more of a sharp/perfumy slant of hop flavor rubs nicely against the soft, malty undertow.  Mouthfeel is medium bodied and definitely lower on the carbonation level of most (if not all) commercial IPAs I've tried. The carbonation, albeit modest, is very fine and lifting. The nice bitter/chalky, estery zingy finish.  Overall this IPA is yummy. There is a considerable deviance fron the blossoming nose to a more two-dimensional flavor experience. The flavors aren't bad, just a bit narrow and restrictive. It reminds me of a terrific homebrew that I'd definitely scrounge a growler of. Very rustic and unrefined, but I believe this is the simple allure of this ale. I absolutely enjoyed it.",Bear Republic Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,93
610,2751,Justin23060,4.12,Pours exceptionally cloudy with lots of chunky sediment and an off white head with above average lacing. Smells mostly of pine with a bit of citrus. Not much malt smell getting through as expected. Surprised by a bit of nice floral hop in the taste. Warms the throat slightly but not boozy at all. Hop bitterness is dry but last for a long long time. A little astringent but in a good way. Pretty solid IPA and a good example of what this style should be. I'll get it again and would recommend it to any who appreciate hops.,Bear Republic Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,93
610,2751,Rschis16,4.25,"Hazy orange color with lots of sediment floating around. Thin white head that does leave some lacing. Smells prominently of oranges and citrusy hops. Definitely mildly hoppy on the nose but nothing incredibly surprising yet. Very pleasant smell though.  Ooo this one is for hop heads. Very bitter on the palate as all taste buds scream to bitter citrusy hops. Under the apparent 80-something IBU's is a complex mix of citrus flavors that come together nicely as a complement to the huge hoppiness felt throughout every sip. There is a hint of alcohol if you're looking for it, but for all intents and purposes, the bitter hops distract from that booziness, but in a good way. I think I expected something more fruity from the orange-ish nose it let off, but really this beer is an IPA til the bitter end. The citrus notes are there but only add to the hop profile. The mouthfeel is carbonated and bitter, but surprisingly the bitter aftertaste seems to dissapate quickly.  I gotta say, this is one really good IPA. I'm an IPA guy and this one is heavy on the hops but also balanced in a way that is perfectly pleasant. Really good beer.",Bear Republic Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,93
610,2751,TheBrewo,4.24,"This was served to us at the Old Toad in Rochester, NY, from a cask. It arrived in a tulip glass, the color or rich, deep gold, with darker hues of amber-red. It had a one finger foamy tan head that retained through to the bottom of the glass. It left little lacing as is slowly dissipated. Low carbonation was noted, and chunky sediment was found to be suspended throughout the syrupy-looking liquid. Most of this debris was found in the top half of the glass. Upon sniffing, the nose was filled with the aromas of sweet, apricot nectars, and sugary florals. Notes of honey were noted, to enhance the sweetness. Pale malts were there for a balance to the floral, piney hops that dominated the rest of the nose. On the very back there was spice, of spicy brown mustard seed, and a bit of grapey booze. As we sipped, the mouth was bombarded with sweetness, of fruit, and a grapey, woodiness, like a Chardonnay. Infused here were also clean hops. Through the middle there was a peak of sour, hoppy citrus. More wood appeared, and more bitter spice, but most notably cinnamon. Hops washed us through to the finish, with bitterness and bite, while that winey astringency comes back to dry the mouth, with a souring touch. The final things to leave the taste buds are clean malts, which washes the mélange of competing flavors away. The aftertaste breaths sour, woody, and with faint hops and booze. The body is medium and the carbonation nears nonexistent. Each sip goes down coolly, and smoothly, with slick hop oils helping things along. The head retention gives a nice and creamy slurpability to it. By the end the mouth is left dry, but not overwhelmingly so. The abv is standard, and the beer drinks easily.  Overall, what we found most enjoyable about this brew was the aroma. It was nectary sweet amongst a bouquet of flowers, with some oddities, like that spicy mustard seed. Unlike many others in the style, here the hops took a delicate back seat, making this more than the typical IPA. One criticism is that it was a bit on the sour end, but this ultimately didn’t take much away, but rather gave it another unique aspect for the style.",Bear Republic Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,93
610,2751,SWMeyer4141,4.38,"I'm always afraid to buy this beer b/c theres no freshness label on it. However asking an employee he assured me it came in 3 days ago, so we'll see.  Appearance-A light amber with some sediment floating around with the carbonation bubbles floating to the top. About one inch of white head that quickly becomes a film resting on top. Very nice lacing remains.  Smell-Lots of floral notes along with some grapefruit and citrus aroma. Some malt notes in the backround.  Taste-Grapefruit and more Grapefruit. You get some lemon as well with a great balance between the Hops and Malt. It's fairly hoppy, but not too bitter. One of the highest drinkability IPAs I've had.  Mouthfeel-Medium bodied, fairly sticky on the tongue, but leaves you wanting more. Just enough carbonation and just goes down perfectly.  Overall-Just an outstanding beer. It usually takes a higher ABV brew to get this much flavor. Probably the most flavorful and drinkable 7% IPA I've had.",Bear Republic Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,93
610,2751,GossageBrewery,4.65,"Poured from a 22 oz bottle into a pint glass. The American IPA poured a hazy orange color. It produced a thick creamy head and had excellent head retention. (Most impressive head I have ever seen on a beer.) There was a nice amount of lacing on the glass. The aroma was dominated by hops and citrus. When I say dominated by hops, I meant this aroma is HOPTASTIC! The taste of the IPA was like a slap in the face with a hop club. BAM! The front, middle and finish of the taste was all about hops. This is a hopheads dream come true. Somehow despite all of the hop bitterness, the smoothness of the beer was off the charts. Awesome beer, one of my new all time favorites!",Bear Republic Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,93
610,2751,nickfl,4.13,"A - The beer generates just under two fingers of off-white head on top of a clear, copper colored body. The foam sticks around for quite a while before settling down and leaving a thick coating of lace on the glass.  S - The aroma is full of pine, grapefruit, and musty, sweaty hop notes. There is also some caramel malt in the background to remind you that it is beer rather than just hop tea.  T - Pine hops and bready malt up front with a little bit of caramel. More malt complexity comes out in the middle with notes of toffee and a hint of honey. The beer finishes with more pine and grapefruit hop flavor as well as fairly pungent bitterness that balances out the rich malt.  M - A moderately thick body, average carbonation, and a slightly sweet finish.  D - Very nice, this is clearly an IPA with generous hop character and an emphasis on pine character. The malt, however, is by no means lost in the shuffle. There is plenty of rich bready grain character and just enough caramel to add complexity without drowning out or dulling the hops. Well worth trying, I only with it was available closer to home.",Bear Republic Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,93
610,2751,hopsolutely,4.25,"Beautiful orange-hued amber. Perfectly clear and very low carbonation, leading to subtle lacing without any real head.  Delightful aroma that actually pales in comparison to the robust taste! A very powerful mouthfeel and a lot of ""oomph"". Well balanced and embracing the entire palate; a range of malty sweetness to citrusy pine, with a pleasantly bitter & lingering finish.  Definitely a beer I will seek out again...",Bear Republic Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,93
610,2751,uustal,4.41,"Pours a hazy, hazy pale orange with a one-finger slightly off-white head. Very good lacing and head retention. Hoppy aroma. Sweet orange, grapefruit, mango and pine. Tastes begins with an excellent sweet creamy orange flavor. Sugary grapefruit follows. Biscuity and caramel malt and a bit of pine resin finish it out. Extremely smooth, creamy mouthfeel. Awesomely sessionable IPA.",Bear Republic Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,93
610,2751,claminat420,4.45,"A- poured in my melt cafe (cleveland, oh. best bar you'll ever go!!) pint glass. has a transparent but slight hazy golden color with a frothy white head. leaves a nice amount of lacing.  S- just a nice citrusy hop scent which an ipa should have.  T- at first the alcohol is undetected by the bitterness but after a couple it's noticable. has that nice citrusy hop taste like the smell. malt isn't that much of a star here which makes sence it being an ipa. 40 or 60 caramel malt i would guess.  M- solid medium bodied. good carbonation.  Drinkability- will def buy more down the road.  Overall- this beer is better than two hearted but behind huma lupa in my opinion. this is my first six pack but hope the rest i buy are all solid unlike my luck with two hearted's consistency. the only thing negativie i can really say is the $11.99 six pack isn't too great.",Bear Republic Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,93
610,2751,Lauthaha,4.5,"Poured from a 12 ounce bottle into a beer taster.  Appearance: Beer is a clear, golden color with active carbonation visible through the glass. Head is a frothy, 1/2 finger coating on the surface of the beer. Lots of bubbles and medium lacing. Looks good!  Smell: This beer smells very, very beautiful. The word ""creamsicle"" comes to mind. A sweet malt base provides ample room on which citrus zest and a perfect mix of bitter/floral hops build a fortress of awesome.  Taste/Mouthfeel: The beer is creamy from the get go, with a tangy bitterness coming from the hop oils about mid-sip. Subtle sweetness from the malt (caramel) can be picked up in between attacks from the hops. Beer rinses rather smoothly leaving a hop-assault reminder on the tastebuds. Very bitter, you've gotta love hops to love this brew.  Overall: Definitely worth a try, but only if you're into IPAs and their compadres. I almost wish I had bought a six-pack of these (rather than the single that I found), but there'll be another chance, I'm sure.",Bear Republic Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,93
610,2751,abraxel,3.95,"A - I don't know whether I was supposed to, but I decanted the beer into my glass, leaving the yeast sediment behind (I'll probably drink it later). It pours a transparent golden-orange with a top of white foam that's not in a hurry to leave and which drops nice trails of lacing down the side.  S - Earthy hops, biscuity malt. A nice, relatively subtle (for an IPA) aroma.  T - Lots of earthy hops, with some citrus as well. Not incredibly bitter, but plenty of hops flavor. It's balanced by a rather simple malt backbone. There's not a lot of complexity, but it's a very well-crafted, non-extreme IPA.  M - Smooth, punctuated by moderate carbonation.  Overall, I feel like this is a somewhat quintessential IPA. It's not extreme, not overly bitter or sweet, not pushing any limits; it's just a solid, well-crafted beer. Very ""to style"", but nothing that really makes it stand out to me.",Bear Republic Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,93
610,2751,azdback,3.98,"Poured into my favorite Surly pint glass. A bright orange that is clear and not cloudy at all. Medium carbonation bubbles. The head is not very large, maybe a finger, and bright white in color. Lace is starting out a bit sticky, and retains it's stickiness all the way to the end.  Smell is of citrus hops and sweet. It kind of smells like an orange.  The taste is at first a bitter and sweet hop punch. I think maybe a lemon with sugar flecks. There isn't much malt character, but that is what I expect from a west coast IPA. There is just a bit of bready tastes, way late.  Mouth is great for the style. A bit spritzy in the carbonation, but full bodied and there to the end.  I have mentioned in other reviews that I think my pallet is changing over the years. This beer is a perfect example of my theory. Racer 5 has been readily available to me for years and I have enjoyed it for as long, but as I sit here to write down what I am experiencing I realize it is kind of a one trick pony. Which at on time I really enjoyed, and still do, but not quite as much as I once did. I think that it is only fair to give it a score based on it's entire life with me not just tonight. Highly recommended!!",Bear Republic Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,93
610,2751,notchucknorris,4.42,"A: Golden color with almost no head at all. Kind of surprised by that.  S: Beautiful. Lots and lots of citrus hop aroma and a fair amount of mango as well.  T: There's a ton of really nice hop bitterness here with just enough malt to hold it down. The hops hit right away, hard and piny, and they are drawn out forever. There's a touch of tropical sweetness towards the end and then a nice and fairly clean finish. Really nicely done.",Bear Republic Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,93

610,2751,ManuelHerrera,3.88,"So I just finished trying a Schlitz...and simply needed to grab a beer I know I would like!  A - Pours murky tangerine with a healthy head. This bottle had an outrageous amount of yeast accumulated, which I guess adds a little something.  S - Not too powerful, but a sudsy soapiness is meshed with citrus tang for a healthy IPA aroma. Some yeastiness notes as well.  T - Spicy pine hop flavors come through at first with a thick butter flavor making this IPA a little bit creamier in flavor. Unabashedly a California IPA, with a bit more of oak and pine earthy flavor.  M - Creamy with the typical hop bite making Racer 5 unique. Almost chewy at points.  Overal Racer 5 is a standby in the IPA culture, worth a look.",Bear Republic Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,93
610,2751,beagle75,3.87,"Poured from a 12 oz. bottle into a shaker pint glass.  A: Slightly hazy, light amber color with over one finger of lofty and persistent off-white foam head. Heavy lacing remains on the glass, and suspended hop solids are distributed throughout the column.  S: Hoppy pine and herbaceous spice find balance with caramel and juicy orange citrus. Intensity is consistent throughout, perhaps even increasing as it warms in the glass.  T: Begins dry, with refined pale malt and aromatic hops--consisting of grapefruit and herbaceous flowering plants--in balance, unfettered by only very strained acidity. Mild astringency decorates the toasty middle, lending an impression of volatile fusel alcohols on the palate. Moderate bitterness emerges in the finish, lingering alongside the honest herbaceous grapefruit aromatics found in the beginning.  M: Thin to medium viscosity, simultaneously wet and creamy on the palate developing into a sublime smoothness, with moderate carbonation that keeps the texture from becoming heavy or lifeless.  D: Certainly deserving of top-tier status amongst West Coast IPAs, Racer 5 may be one of the worthiest and most appropriate benchmarks by which to measure others of the style. Not only are flavors bright and clean in a way that is not at all self-conscious, they are nicely balanced. It bears similarities to Port Wipeout IPA and Ballast Point Big Eye IPA (especially to the former).",Bear Republic Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,93
610,2751,BeerPhan86,4.15,"This has always been one of my favorites and a definite go-to when I want a really tasty, well balanced IPA.  A - Pours a hazy straw yellow with a 2 finger foamy white head. Appears to be very well carbonated with some noticeable sediment in the glass.  S - Grapefruit and earthy hops with a nice bready malt backbone. Slightly sweet aspect to the aroma as well.  T - Good amount of sweet malt up front followed by bitter, piney hops and citrus hops. More grapefruit and sweet citrus in the finish, which is dry and slightly boozy. Definitely a hop-forward IPA but surprisingly bitter and just slightly skunky but in a good way. It might cause you to make a funny face at first.  M - A bit overcarbonated and sharp feeling with a medium body. I could do without the sediment, careful pouring this one.  D - Perfectly sessionable IPA, if you're into that sort of thing. Too expensive for me to waste though, I want to appreciate each sip.  Overall, this is a great IPA and one of my all time favorites. There are better examples out there but this is in my top five. Give it a whirl!",Bear Republic Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,93
610,2751,SupaCelt,4.2,"Lovely golden pour with a radiant orange glow. There are chunks of ingredient floating in suspension. White head fizzled up and rolled away. Sparse lacing drapes the glass.  The nose holds juicy lemon citrus and grass notes atop some really pleasant pale malt tones. Just a hint of caramel.  The flavor is delightfully light and fairly crisp in terms of the malt base. The citrus and grassiness flourish before the dry and bitter end resets the palate. There is a freshness that works very well without being vegetal or offputting.  The mouthfeel is light and works well with the flavor profile.  Overall, this is another great west coast ipa. The golden colour and lightness of the body as well as the fresh and dancing hoppiness exemplify this variation. Brews at this point in the spectrum allow enthusiasts to experience some dynamics within a style that can take on some interesting variances in characteristics, but often gets pegged as mundane. From the golden end, where this delicious treat marks its territory, to deep copper and all points in between, the ipa style can still raise an eyebrow. This is a very enjoyable brew.

T: The hops smack me upfront with bitterness then apologize with more of that perfect citrus and floral elegance through to the end. This thing is juicy with hoperfection. There is enough malt here to stand this thing up but it never overpowers the hops. It just sits there and provides a few biscuity notes. Finishes very slightly sweet and crisp with bitterness.

Kind of leaves a bit of a phlegmy feeling the back of the throat.  Overall - A fantastic IPA. I really enjoyed this one.

610,2751,Satchboogie,4.15,"22oz bomber (dated 2/17/11) poured into a tulip glass  A: Pours a very hazy golden yellow/really light copper. Looks exactly like an apricot preserve. I get about 1.5 inch frothy head that bubbles away slowly. Tons of lacing.  S: Grapefruit, pine, caramel, some tropical fruits (pineapple, maybe a little apricot).  T: The tropical fruit is in the forefront, though it doesn't exactly burst onto the palate like some other IPAs. As the carbonation fizzes out the pine comes out of the background, though not all that strong. There's a good bit of bitterness with it, but nothing too powerful. It's balanced. Unfortunately the juicy fruit flavors start to fade fairly quickly from the middle to the finish, leaving with a very light malt body and some light pine bitterness. Finish is a light, clean moderately bitter pine and pineapple. There's a touch of sugar to lend a little juiciness up front, but it fades and overall the malt bill is very light. I do like IPAs that aren't sweet and malty, but this seems just a little too week on the malt/sweetness side.  M: Moderate to light carbonation, light to medium body (though very murky and unfiltered). There is a nice smoothness and ample pine resin from the middle through finish.  O: For a single IPA, this is great stuff. It's nothing extreme, just juicy tropical fruits with a good balance of bitterness and a light malt body. I tend to love the more extreme IPAs, but this is really solid for what it is.",Bear Republic Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,93

A: Standard pour yields a 1 finger frothy off-white head with great retention. Beer is a clear deep goldenrod. Lacing is spotty and stringy with moderate stick. A good looking beer overall.  S: Nose is caramel, pine, cane sugar, and slight hints of citrus. Moderately aromatic but rather subtle considering the style.  T: Opens honey, cane sugar, and tropical fruit. Lychee, pineapple, and citrus. Sappy and piney hops in the middle though its lost much of its bitterness. Yeasty towards the end and slightly spicy. Resiny hop bitterness finally peaks its head in the end. Bitter, dry aftertaste. This one's not hoppy at all and actually very mellow. Makes me think its not totally fresh but I can't be sure without a bottling date.  M: Light bodied with moderate carbonation. Smooth and watery in the mouth with a slight prickle going down. Finish is dry with a dry aftertaste that lingers. Very nice feel here. The perfect combination of carbonation and smoothness.  O: I'm a bit dissapointed by this considering the accolades that it gets... to the point where I question the freshness of the bottle I had. Taste overall was just too mellow with nothing really standing out. Definitely worth another visit in my opinion.  T:  M:  O:",Bear Republic Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,93
610,2751,spinrsx,3.95,"Draft  Appearance - The beer pours a slightly hazy amber colour with a huge size frothy off-white coloured head. There is low amount of carbonation, and there is some really good spider web lacing on the sides of the glass. The head lasted for 4-5 minutes before it began to dissipate.  Smell - Malts, caramel, hops, tangerine/grapefruit  Taste & Mouth - There is a below average amount of carbonation and the beer feels slightly thin on the tongue. Most of the taste is made up of caramel mixed with hops and grapefruit/tangerine juice and zest. The beer finishes with a hoppy and malty sweet aftertaste.  Drink - Definitely one of my favourite IPA's but I might have ran into an old keg. It seemed to have a more toned down flavour than it did from the bottles I've had in the past.",Bear Republic Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,93
610,2751,veinless,4.09,"Just about a half-finger white head tops this cloudy orange beer. Head doesn't retain well and leaves spotty lace on the glass. Deep color of the beer is approaching brown, but is still in orange territory.  Big mango and citrus aroma up front, with sticky caramel behind not anything to be trifled with either. Really pleased with the balance of grapefruit with tropical scents, as it's full and sweet smelling while still being crisp and refreshing on the nose.  Boy the taste is a huge tropical caramel bomb at the start, and the citrus does little to stop the rush of sweetness. Eventually pine and hoppy bitterness take charge and lead the beer to the dry finish. Stickiness remains from start to finish, and is at a pleasant level at the end. This beer approaches too sweet at the beginning, but it never gets there so all is well.  Mouthfeel is very sticky, very full, and only slightly carbonated. This is a very malty beer, and the caramel malts add a lot more to the feel than the hops. The finish is nicely bittersweet. Drinkability is helped a lot by that, and also by the fruity beginning to each sip, although the sweetness may put some off. I'm sure this beer when really, really fresh is a hop monster to be reckoned with. Definitely one of the better single IPAs on the market along with Surly Furious.",Bear Republic Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,93

610,2751,trappistlover,4.67,"This beer is my favorite IPA. It has everything that I expect from an IPA without being ""extreme'/ 'imperial'/ 'double"": a nice fruity aroma which explodes with great hop flavor. In spite of the hoppiness, it maintains a nice malt balance. I love it!!",Bear Republic Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,93
610,2751,TheSignPost,4.42,"Awesome! This beer is an extremely pleasant surprise. It pours a golden honey color, not super clear, but you can tell it means business. The aroma is perfect. Hoppy and clean. And then the taste backs it up. This one talks the talk, and walks the walk too.  Very very good.",Bear Republic Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,93
610,2751,TheSupremeAJ,4.2,"Hazy cloudy gold piss color with nice white head. Some of the best lacing i've ever seen.  Smells like a nice balance of malts and a little bit of tropical hops.  Taste is balanced between easy malts, good amount of ibttering and a healthy dose of aroma. It has the typical Racer 5 yeast (anyone care to comment? send me a PM with what kind of yeast it is.)  Mouthfeel is great... a tad bit towards the sweeter side however this may be an old bottle.  Overall this is a very good go-to beer!",Bear Republic Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,93
610,2751,sentomaster,4.3,"A- On tap poured into a pint glass. A bright, clear golden apricot with a soft and frothy three finger head, which lingers. As it slowly recedes the head leaves chunks of nice lacing.  S- In a word: Yummy. A rich pale and caramel malt base of crisp sweetness covered with snappy notes of pine and citrus. A very crisp and appetizing nose.  T/M- Absolutely delicious. Almost a bit buttery it's so smooth from the tight but soft carbonation and a firm, crackery malt base. Then the hops lay in with a soft tropical fruit juiciness. Layers of pine and citrus join in adding to the nuance. Lingering soft hop flavors with a touch of grapefruit and a crisp- but now very subdued- malt sweetness on the finish.  O- What a great beer. It doesn't go over the top, but that's part of what makes it so great- it just hits all it's marks quite perfectly and on time. This may very well be the standard-bearer in my opinion. It's somewhere between IPA and DIPA in the way it feels and tastes, but it's all goodness. So well balanced and drinkable it's scary.",Bear Republic Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,93

610,2751,morebeergood,3.85,"Second beer of the night last night at the Yard House, Dedham, as my drink with appetizers. Served on tap into a pint glass. Bright yellow color with a fizzy white head and plenty of carbonation. Smell was hoppy, but not overly powerful. Taste was much more agreeable than I expected. While I am not a huge IPA fan, this one tasted excellent. It had hops, sure, but it didn't blow your palate off. Just a nice dose of hops that tasted great. Mouthfeel was not overly bitter like some IPAs, but instead was smooth and crisp. This IPA was a surprise because of how much I liked it, and it rose to the top of my list of the style. Very well made beer for all types of craft beer lovers.",Bear Republic Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,93

T - Small malty sweetness followed by a solid hop presence. Pine and grapefruit, quite clean tasting, some sweeter citrus as wel. Great balance.  M - Somewhat creamy with low to moderate carbonation.

610,2751,rawfish,4.2,"Broke in my NB globe glass with a careful pour that nets a frothy one finger head over a hazy orange body. Spotty lacing all over the glass.  Pretty strong, floral and pungent pine over citrus with a sweet underlying caramel malt character. Slightly breathy alcohol and a steady hop character. Makes me excited to take the first sip.  Pleasant drink, bright hop kick on the drink followed by some toasty malts and residual sweetness to balance it out. Hops are a good balance of citrus and pine with a bit more of the former, bitterness doesn't linger as much as some other IPAs but there is a pleasant accumulation of spicy notes on the back end. A little bit of yeast character helps to tone down the bitterness as well, thick and earthy.  Medium bodied,yeast doesn't really make an impact and well carbonated, I did notice that for a bottle conditioned brew the feel over the palate was a bit watery. Very smooth.  This IPA is certainly unique in the way the yeast and malts combine to balance out the hops. This combination makes for a beer that delivers in hops yet is delicate and very well balanced.",Bear Republic Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,93
610,2751,jmfc8237,4.52,Poured into a pint glass with a bone white head about an inch thick. Left tons of lacing which was very sticky and streaming. Color was a clear honey.  Aromas of earthy hops are abundant as well as a sweet malty background. Lots of complex citrus as well. Orange grapefruit and sap.  Bam there it is. Holy hops batman! This is a one way ticket to flavor country. Really unique bouquet of hops and has a imediate bitter resignation. Although it's in your face it's very well balanced with the malt profile.  Overall it's extremely drinkable and palpable. Two thumbs up.,Bear Republic Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,93
610,2751,Thickfreakness,4.53,"A- Beautiful hazy orange hue with a bright white head floating on top. The heads fades away leaving some of the stickiest lacing I've ever seen.  S- BAM!!! Grapefruit, orange zest, honey, mango and pineapple! Just the right amount of pine underneath, with a touch of sweetness from the malts.  T- Fresh squeezed grapefruit juice... nice piney hop flavor. Really fresh Cascade and Amarillo hop flavors. I love the sweetness that the malts impart. This is really fantastic!  M- Sweet and bitter mingle well, and do a wonderful dance on the tongue. Very fruit forward with a nice sweet piney backdrop. The first beer where I can really taste the cannabis connection.  O- This is a brilliant IPA!

610,2751,DaveBlack,3.53,"A: Rich honey color, maybe a cm of white head that has pretty good retention and leaves a nice ring of lacing. A steady stream of bubbles can be seen rising from the middle of the glass to feed the thin layer of head that remains.  S: Lovely aroma of piney, citrusy hops. not much going on behind the hops except a hint of sweetness from the malts. Definitely almost entirely hops here.  T: Nothing subtle about the hops on this baby, either in the nose or the taste. Grapefruit hops hit right up front, giving a nice jolt of bitterness, that fades away into sweetness with a lasting hop flavor.  M: Medium-light body with a good amount of carbonation that tickles the tongue.  O: A good IPA, a very drinkable beer, but it's basically a mild hop bomb. Not much complexity, just delicious hops. I have given up being impressed with simple, heavily hopped beer, but it is good and well balanced.

The nose is pretty faint for the most part. Some hoppy pine is noticed along with some sweet malt.  The taste is very nicely balanced between a light fruity bitterness up front and a caramel malt backdrop. Almost resembling a candied apple. Interesting...  The mouthfeel is creamy and smooth with a moderate amount of carbonation.  Overall, the hoppy bitterness may have faded overtime in this barrel but im not sure if this is due to age or if it is the intended direction.

I really have been getting into IPA's lately and I was excited to give this one a try.  Poured a 12oz bottle into a pint glass to see the golden amber color. Now there was a noticeable haze in the glass and I'm not sure if thats common for this beer or if I got an older bottle.  To me grapefruit & hops really stick out in the smell. Taste wise this one really hits you hard up front and really mellows out.  This beer was easy to drink and I could easily but a few back in one sitting.

Pine is quite evident in the aroma along with some malts. Really nice combination of the two.  Wow! What a great tasting IPA! Piney hops, citrus, sweet maltiness and a great bitterness at the end. It works so simply together but works so well. Definitely on my top five IPA list.  Light to approaching medium body. Goes down easily with its creamy head. Carbonation helps to meld the flavors together.  This is one tasty, easy drinking IPA. Very close to perfection as far as an IPA goes.

S: Pine needles attack the nostrils. If I wasn't aware before, I am now: this is a west coast IPA all the way.  T: A good dose of breadiness hits first, but it's merely a formality as the sweet and citrusy hops overwhelm the palate from the mid to finish.  M: Pretty killer - this one feels like it belongs. Good weight and creaminess that tends to be found in the upper echelon of the style.  O: I've been meaning to review this one for a while, and what better way then a growler!  Bear Republic's Racer 5 is one of the top AIPA's for a reason, and is a cornerstone of the style. I have returned to this time and time again, and will continue to for years to come.

Light and smooth without much crispness. Goes down fairly easy  Drinkability:  Overall a decent IPA.

Fantastic piney, citrusy scent, not overly sweet...exactly what a fresh IPA should smell like. Let's you know what you're in store for.  Yum...piney goodness in a glass. Not just pine though...grapefruit, maybe some lemon...malt balance is not as pronounced...and I like that!  Absolutely drinkable, and very affordable.

610,2751,walteez,4.15,"This beer pours up a nice golden orange / amber color & a little lacking in the head department. The smell is nice and citrusy... I get orange (unfortunately I have terrible sinus problems and smell isn't my forte).  I can say that after the first taste I was rather impressed. It's hoppy for sure with a hint of sweetness. The hops are piney and resiny with a nice bitter undertone throughout the taste. The bitterness lends to dryness & while both are ever present, there is still a small war in my mouth mid to late taste between the hops and malty sweetness. In my opinion this tastes more similarly to a lot of DIPAs I've had than regular IPAs - and it's right on the verge at 7%.  I never really paid attention to this beer. It is always on the shelf at the local shop, very affordable and doesn't have a stand-out label (I know this shouldn't matter but a label can go a long way in making you notice a beer on a shelf among 100s of others).

A - Upon examining the unopened bottle, a fair amount of ""floaties"" are noticed at the bottom of the bottle. After posting a thread, still not sure if this is normal or not. Some say it's from the bottle conditioning and others say the same thing but it also may be an old bottle. Pours a rather hazy, opaque deep honey color. A one finger, white foamy head on the initial pour put it quickly fades. A good amount of carbonation bubbles rise from the bottom of the glass. Decent lacing on the side of the glass after finishing.  S - A very nice aroma of spicy hops and citrus.  T - A very nice tasting IPA. A nice bitter bite from the hops is offset by the grapefruit taste. A decent malt backbone. Overall, decently balanced beer which leans towards the bitter side than the sweet side. The alcohol is well disguised.  M - A well carbonated beer. A slightly bitter aftertaste lingers after each sip.

T-Hoppy citrus notes of the grapefruit variety with a biscuity malt backbone. Not very complex, but it tastes good.  M-Nicely carbonated, just about right for the style.  D-Not overly hoppy, so I don't think palate fatigue would impact drinkability. I could probably drink a couple of these in a setting.

The smell of this one was a clean hopped up smell that was not too strong or too weak, it seemed perfectly balanced with the sweet Carmel smell that it had.  The taste of this was a hoppy one at first but not as hoppy and bitter as most other IPA's that I have tried. The hops quickly fade out into a nice calm Carmel like sweetness that is easy to wash down.  The mouthfeel was fairly dry and it was on the lighter side of things to me.  I find this one pretty drinkable due to the smoothness of it's hop flavor and could definitely see this as a good introduction to someone that has not tried an IPA.

Grapefruit up front, with apricot and pineapple just behind. A touch of caramel malt lies in the back.  Dominant citrus flavor up front is balanced by a caramel maltiness which falls just behind. The hops flavor balances the sweet citrus flavors with a touch of pithy bitterness. The caramel flavor is a but too strong for my preference but it does not become distracting.  Medium mouth feel. The hops are a bit oily on the tongue. Finish is fairly dry.  Very drinkable IPA. While it falls short of the top tier I would have no issues drinking a few in a sitting.

Light caramel malt and grapefruit acidity offer as much contrast as they can but this one is truly all about the hops. A bit dry in the finish with some lingering hop bitterness. The taste wasn't as good as the nose but I still really enjoyed this one. One of my all time favorites revved up a few extra notches.  M - Medium body and flavor with moderate carbonation.

610,2751,Flounder57,4.32,I poured the bomber into a tulip glass. I have had this beer plenty of times and now have sat down to right a review about it.  Appearance: It pours a golden amber/orange color. A white head of foam is produced when poured into the glass and then the lacing from the foam remains on the glass as it is consumed. There is also a decent amount of carbonation throughout the glass as I am writing this revies.  Smell: The hops dominate with a citrus and piney aroma. There is a slight aroma from the malt used to produce this beer.  Taste: The hoppy bitterness hits the mouth and followed by the piney taste. Finished off with a slight taste of the sweet malt. There is only a slight bit of bitterness.  Mouthfeel: This is a medium bodied beer. Also followed with a decent amount of carbonation.  Drinkability: This is a good beer. Very easy to enjoy the 22 oz bomber by yourself or with friends. Very easy to consume and given the 7% ABV. A must try for an IPA fan or one looking to try an IPA.,Bear Republic Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,93
610,2751,Slatetank,4.6,"I had this on cask at Al's of Hampden, served in a Nonic.  The color is golden hued with amber accents and thick collar of light white w/ a light yellow accent. The clarity is lightly hazed and the bead is very fine. I love the array of fruit odors this ipa presents - very citrus and tropical tinged yet is has a moderately high amount of pine from the hops too. I like the grapefruity presence -it is so pungent it is like smashing your face into a pile of grapefruits. The feel is both bitter and yet smooth at the same time, plenty of natural carbonation with a blend of yeast and softness from the oils of the hops giving a slight dry and the malt body adds a gentle sweetness level.  This IPA is delicous, just so tangy and citrus flavored with some herbal elements giving a well round flavor of bitter orange/grapefruit notes that aren't hampered by the malt. The taste of the malt is very dry, only enough sweetness there to compliment the slight pineapple quality. The bitterness level is optimal with a low level of astringency and the hop goodness lasts for a while after the swallow. I could enjoy a quart of this IPA it is so drinkable on cask, I have enjoyed it equally in each delivery method -tap, bottle and now cask, just delicious in every way. I would prefer it on cask as the hops seem so much more vibrant and fresh this way.",Bear Republic Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,93
610,2751,oline73,4.37,Poured from a bottle into a goblet.  Appearance: Pours a mostly clear golden amber color. There is a two finger off white head of which a layer remains.  Smell: Sweet citrus hops dominate with some mild herbal notes. Some of the sweetness comes from the malt.  Taste: Citrus hop bitterness hits the tongue pretty hard initially. There is some sweet malt in the background. The flavor is a bit peppery and the finish is bitter.  Mouthfeel: Medium body and an appropriate level of carbonation. There isn't any dryness at all.  Drinkability: This is a very good beer. I really like the hop profile and will visit it again.,Bear Republic Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,93

T: crisp with a bit on the heavy side of hops. sour finish with lingering bitterness  M: hearty and will stand on its own  D: Little unbalanced on the hoppy side.

610,2751,UTCengOwl,4.42,"Had this a few times on tap and from a bottle. This review is from last night at the Kung Fu Saloon. Served in a shaker pint.  The pour last night came with almost no head and the glass wan't that clean... At least they had a beer of this quality available. From the times I've had it before (including with Thanksgiving dinner last year), it has poured with a nice white head. The beer itself looks like a typical IPA... maybe a bit thicker and hazier? Either way, it's not a bad looker.  This beer is dominated by citrusy and piney hops. The first word that comes to mind is resin. However, it's not too bitter. Each sip invites me back for more. It's one of those beers that tastes sticky going down your throat in every right way. The balance of hop flavor and the weight of the beer make this a very solid IPA. I'll never be disappointed to see this on tap.",Bear Republic Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,93
610,2751,Brunite,3.72,"Appearance- Poured a clear golden color with 1 finger of white head.  Smell- Very nice hop aroma, with some citrus notes.  Taste- Really much sweeter than one would expect for an IPA. Not as much hop bitterness a I am used to.  Mouthfeel- Medium light bodied....low on the carbonation.  Drinkability- This was a good beer. Smooth and drinkable. Just felt more like an PA than an IPA.",Bear Republic Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,93
610,2751,JunkYardJake,3.97,12oz bottle to pint glass. Pours a standard copper color with a small whispy head. Smells hoppy with grapefruit and orange. Palate is suprisingly balanced. Sweet and bready malts provide a canvas for the citrusy west coast hops. Soft bitterness in the finish. Moderate body and low carbonation. Very solid and tasty IPA that would probably be better fresh and on-tap.,Bear Republic Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,93
610,2751,rudzud,4.1,Snagged a bottle of this from Julio's. Poured into my Duvel tulip.  A - Pours a crystal clear super light amber colour with less than a one finger head that faded a bit fast leaving a white cloud and some slight side lacing.  S - Nice oily pine resin here as soon as I opened the bottle. Pine and grapefruit dominate the nose.  T - Just like the nose here. You get that nice west coast hop charactistics with the nice strong pine resin flavours right off the bat followed by some barely there citrus notes. Mostly just bitter pines here with a typical dry finish.  M - Low carbonation here with a pleasantly dry finish.  D - This is a quite nice west coast IPA. everything is really good for this brew. Very drinkable if just slightly one dimensional with just pine being front and center.,Bear Republic Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,93
610,2751,ChadQuest,3.09,"I have rarely seen a head this chunky. Super Chunk. So much lacing too. intriguing to watch. Very Clear pale golden body. Aroma is less potent then i suspected, but citrus is the theme coming through the pipeline here. Same thing with the aroma, it's mostly a citrus show, but there is baked biscuit and subtle caramel in here. Wish i had a bottle date. Has good flavors but the amplitude needs to go up a few levels. I can tell this is a good beer, but i'll pass on it until they get me some bottle dating.",Bear Republic Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,93

610,2751,ColdPoncho,3.95,"No clear freshness indication.  A - clear golden straw, small white head. I can see a lot of floaties left in the bottle, so I'm guessing when I pour the rest of it, it's not gonna be anything as pretty - turns out I was wrong. It's still quite clear.  S - This is the second recent west coast IPA that has this ridiculous bitter smell. I'm beginning to think it's simcoe...kind of smells like pot? but more bitter? Well, whatever it is, there's a lot of it, as well as some sweeter tropical fruit and vanilla notes and some other citrusy hops.  T - What I've decided are simcoe hops are a big part of this taste. The taste is basically exactly in line with the nose, which is something I appreciate. I don't like it that much though. It's a fine IPA, not my favorite. To be specific: bitter, pot-like hops up front, some tropical fruit sweetness in the middle, bitter and dry citrus linger.  M - It's smooth enough, but it's kind of thin for its heft.  D - As much as I am put off by the simcoe (which, admittedly, is only a little bit), there's something very charming about this beer. It's well balanced, and light, and complex enough to keep you wondering. It wants me to drink it more than I want it to be drunk by me. Interesting..  Edit: just visited Bear Republic's website. They don't use Simcoe hops in this beer, but rather Chinook, Cascade, Columbus and Centennial. The beer that this reminds me of (Green Flash West Coast) uses the latter three of those plus Simcoe.",Bear Republic Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,93

Piny flowery notes jump out and are inviting and balanced. T- Here's where it gets fun. One of the most balanced IPA""s I have had to date. Hop bitterness is present but doesn't pull away from the subtle earthy flavors. I get a taste off pines, citrus and a bready malt character here. M- Perfect amount of carbonation makes for a refreshing experience with full flavor. I would say this would fall in to a light/medium body. D- I wish I had more then this bomber right now.

Nice bright hop flavor with a balanced but bitter finish. Delicious.  M - Feels great on the palate, nice carbonation and a clean dry finish.  D - I enjoyed this IPA very much.

A: Pours a clean effervescent golden, light honey hue with a decent head that sticks around for a few sips leaving good amounts of lacing in my glass from start to finish.  S: Good amount of hop upfront - fresh cut grass and citrus rind balanced nicely with grain and biscuit finishing with a hint of carmel malt - the hop is present throughout.  T: Taste is similar to the nose, but the hop is even more prevalent - resinous, very earthy with a citrus bight. The hoppiness is balanced well with sweet malt, toasted grain, and flavors of fresh brewed herbal and black tea with just a slight hint of booze in the mix as well.  M: Medium bodied, well carbonated for the style, extremely dry - not sticky at all with a very slight amount of lingering bitterness from the hop (wish there was just a bit more bitterness).

Resonous piney hop forward with smooth interplaying malt sweet bready. The lingering peppery finish drys just right. Excellant carbonation and a nice creaminess.

Lacing stuck to the glass fairly well considering the non-existent head.  S: Citrus fruits and piny hops. Not extremely strong, but a pleasant nose.

Sweet, with mild barley bread and evenly spaced with hops, nothing too extreme, I expected a good kick from this but it is relatively mild for an IPA. Some ground pepper as well as red pepper and cayenne which is a surprise, as well as the fume promised grapefruit, I might just say this is the damn best IPA I've had in a year, sorry Avery.

Floral hops combined with malt, brown sugar and rye. Smells more like a rye ale instead of an IPA. Can smell some alcohol as well. Extemely appetizing smell.  T- Right away you get the very nice floral hops with rye. A very smooth middle leads into a smooth yet nicely bitter finish. Although this is a full bodied strong IPA, it is very smooth. No grapefruit ending, rather bitter hops and lingering rye. Drinks a bit more like a rye ale.  M- Very smooth mouthfeel all around. This is not in the class of IPA that gives you cotton mouth. Low carbonation. Instead of the beer going to the back of palate as per usual with many, it seems to be everywhere.  D- Very nice, balanced and drinkable for a beer of this magnitude.

Smell is intoxicating floral and pine with some citrus and serious hops.  Taste backs up the smell only with a big time bite of bitterness throughout. Very hoppy but not as fruity as I was expecting, judging by the smell. Piney and resinous for sure with a bitter bite that lingers into the aftertaste.  Felt smooth going down again with the strong bitterness present that really balances out the carbonation.

Not very much booze, but some zest remains in the aftertaste, reminding me of how it feels after biting into a lemon peel. Not sour though.  Mouthfeel: Full-bodied, lacking nothing.

S: The aroma is classic IPA, but just is lacking the strength that I've come to appreciate in a West Coast IPA. The hops are leaning towards fruit and citrus notes, with very little pine.  T: The flavor is excellent for an IPA and hops are pronounced. What sets this apart is it's malty sweetness that comes from the pale malt. A good balance is key with this brew.

Slightly bitter finish with some pine notes but nothing overpowering.  Medium body with lower carbonation. Finish is a bit bitter with some piny, resiny hops but they don't stick to the tongue.

Very bitter all the way through. Some slight malt in the middle; followed by an extremely bitter finish.  A strange twist on an IPA for me. The smell was lacking the characteristic grapefruit/hops smell that I tend to notice most frequently associated with American IPA's. The taste is very balanced for being as bitter(75+ IBU's).

Lots of pine and grapefruit on the nose, a bit floral too. Very pleasant indeed.  Great hop character. Lots of bitter, but I think it's fairly balanced with hop flavor and residual sweetness. Hop flavor lingers on the palette, but not in an unpleasant way. This is a fairly balanced IPA.  Hard to say, it might just be because this particular bottle is more on the room temp side, but I would like more effervescence. As the beer continues to warm, I get more of a syrupy finish.

It had a medium body with light carbonation which provided a nice bite.  Overall, this is fantastic. This will be my go to IPA for the time being. I think the checkered flag on the front of the bottle suits this podium finishing beer.",Bear Republic Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,93
610,2751,khumbard,4.1,"Poured from a 12oz bottle into my Sam Adams perfect pint glass.  Pours a nice golden color with a white frothy head, sticks to the side of the glass all the way through. Big citrus hops, lots of grapefruit and mango. Solid. Taste follows suit... citrusy hops with a good amount of bitterness. Finishes pretty dry and clean, giving it great drinkability. I could definitely get most of the way through a sixer if I had a little motivation. Very solid IPA, and one I pick up when I get the opportunity.",Bear Republic Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,93
610,2751,breyton490,3.06,"Bought a 12 pack of 12oz bottles in Jan 2011 on the east coast.  Nice hop aroma, similar to what I remember when having this on tap in Heldsberg.  Very clear appearance, nice big rocky head.  Nice bittering, very good IPA, but not very drinkable. Mouth feel was thick and syrupy. Alcohol taste evident.  I don't think I could drink more than one or two bottles in a sitting due to the heavy, sticky, syrup texture of the beer. Prefer the dryer finish found in a Sierra Nevada or Russian River IPA (RR IPA or Blind Pig)",Bear Republic Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,93

S: Grapefruit, tangerine, some mango like notes as well. Good hop characters in the nose, very citrus but also some floral notes.  T/M: Well the taste is just like the nose, fantastic. Great consistent fruit notes that really show well. Great amount of hop profile really well done. Easy on the palate, very cleansing but not overly bitter.

Strong citrus hop smell, could wake the dead. Bitter and sugary. this smells amazing!  T- Mash up of different fruits, mostly citrus, bitter hop goodness. Mild floral touch.  M- Sweet, mild and dry.  D- This beer is extremely drinkable. I often pass it up, i will not be so unwise next trip at the beer store. One damn fine IPA.",Bear Republic Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,93
610,2751,StaveHooks,4.64,"A - Pours a golden orange body with a bone white head. Patterns of lacing at the top.  S - Wow! Cascade with some spice! Tangerine, ruby red grapefruit, some honey herbs, tart strawberries, tangy mango, over-ripe pineapple, sugary yeast. Basically heaven.  T - A burst of candied grapefruit, tangerine, sweet lemon, mango, and green pineapple. Has some wintergreen pine mixed in as well as some herbal spice notes. All of this encompasses a rich and honey kissed pale malt that seems to soothe the soul. Bitterness is tame and resides on the edges of the flavor giant.  M - Medium body, actually kind of a lush feel,  This beer lives up to the hype. I've been putting off trying this beer for a long time because of the label. Boy was I wrong...Basically a tropical citrus wonderland resting on a crystal caramel malt crust. The herbal and evergreen balances out the huge hop profile wonderfully. This a flavor assault...period. The great thing about the hops is the flavor and not necessarily the bitterness. The malt is perfect and is in perfect unison with the hops. This beer is a flavor giant and you should not let this pass you up. Don't judge a book by it's cover....lesson learned.",Bear Republic Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,93
610,2751,DovaliHops,4.47,"Decided to finally review this the other night...I thought I had already reviewed it since it is one of my go-to IPAs for everyday drinkin. Pours slightly clear amber color with a medium white head. Scent is extremely sweet and hoppy with a lot of pine. Smells AMAZING! Taste is citrusy (grapefruit and orange) with nice fresh hop flavor. I also get a light malt backbone (very light---this is the west coast afterall). The pine flavors dominate throughout, making this one tasty IPA. Mouthfeel is full-bodied and very complex. Drinkability is very high. This beer is AMAZING fresh! It can turn for the worst rather quickly though. Definitely one of my favorite IPAs when fresh.",Bear Republic Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,93
610,2751,RBassSFHOPit2ME,4.15,"Ah...Racer 5. My gateway beer into pungent sticky hops. This beer is responsible for letting me know the potential Hops and IPA's had to offer after a few so-so ones.  A - Golden orange, a bit cloudy but not murky. Good head retention  S - The first beer that let me know beer could smell and taste similar to chronic dank weed. Now I know why the tap-handle is colored Rastafarian. Awesome, I love it. Pine, oranges dominate, hemp and a sweet malt backbone that holds it together. A musty citrussy nose for sure.  T - Showcases hops upfront. Oranges are the main focus of fruit, followed by hints of grapefruit, sticky pine and hemp. This beer fresh is a treat and 100% walks the line of bordering DIPA territory in terms of a heavy hop forward profile for a single IPA. Before Pliny was bottled, this beer is what Northern Californians bought to satisfy their quality hop fix with. To me, this beer is like a sloppy Pliny in flavor. Many similarities.  M - Very nice and crisp. Sweet malt backbone is there but overshadowed by the hops. Just a bit resinous...lingers like a DIPA would on the palate which is aces for me.  D - Very good. Can put down numerous pints in a sitting without batting an eye.  Final Thoughts - This beer used to get much more praise from hopheads 3 years ago and before. Along came the Sculpins being bottled and the Blind Pigs and Union Jacks and I feel Racer 5 fell a bit by the way side the these. Make no mistake, a fresh racer 5 is arguably as good as all the other over hyped single IPAs mentioned here on BA. I'd never turn one down.",Bear Republic Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,93

Smell- Nice hop aroma, with some citrus notes.  Taste- Really sweet hoppy beer, some bitterness on the backend, but not too much to be bad. It was a good mix.  Mouthfeel- Low carbonation, and a little sticky. Medium light bodied.  Drinkability- This was a really good beer. It went down smooth, but you could still feel the slight burn of the alcohol.",Bear Republic Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,93
610,2751,Hellabeerguzzler,3.57,"a - decent. Nice copper, slightly cloudy (hello!) w/ not much carbonation although enough for me. The shittiest label I have ever seen. It looks like a poor take on a retro label that just was anything but enticing - but heck, it's just a label. Wouldn't have touched it had it not been recommended to try.  s - a little piney, hops not very sharp at all but sweet smell with some breadiness in there. A little wheaty for me as an IPA but regardless, still very nice.  t - delicious. very well done. hop-forward, piney sweet hops with some balance and malt. All in all a very nice beer.  m - coats the mouth heavily and stays with you for a bit.  d - drinkability is very good. I'd drink it again but have to deduct just a little bit for the mouth-wrecking it gave me. I'd drink it again but would stop at 1.",Bear Republic Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,93
610,2751,BaronRogue,4.17,"Poured from a bomber into my chalice. Avoided this one because of the cheesy label graphic... lesson learned.  Not too much head, solid lacing. Clear dark gold color with little bits of yeast suspended within.  Popped the top and put my nose to the bottle. Instantly knew this was going to be an excellent beer. Hop oil to the point it almost smells bitter, sweet citrusy and wonderful.  Tastes like a true IPA, bitterness abounds and changes flavors as it warms. Grapefruity bitter goodness, raisins, etc... it's hop-tastic.  Feels nice and thick on the tongue, lets its presence known.  7 is my favorite number, and i could drink a few bottles of this easily. Each time i put the glass down i find myself reaching back for it. Shame i went for the bomber and not the six pack.",Bear Republic Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,93
610,2751,stakem,4.15,"Poured from a 12oz bottle into a shaped pint glass. This brew appears a pale golden color that is clear with some small particulate floating around in suspension. Almost 2 fingers of fluffy white head swells atop this brew and slowly recedes leaving an entire wall of webbed lace upon the glassware.  The aroma of this brew is citrus hops that comes across a little sweet with some fruity and floral indications and a very light malt backing. It has a faint tingle of alcohol included.  The taste is grassy bitterness, lightly herbal and rind like with quite a bit of citrus fruity bitter flavoring. It has a mild malt sweetness which balances this brew out before it finishes dry and a little sharp. The alcohol is readily evident and increases the sharpness of the finish.  This is a well rounded brew that is medium in body with a modest amount of carbonation. It is quite drinkable and balanced. This is another bear republic offering that I have passed by multiple times without giving a try. I have no idea how fresh this offering is but I would love to have this again as fresh as possible.",Bear Republic Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,93
610,2751,MikeyMikee,4.47,"12. 0z into a pint glass.  The look is a hazy golden yellow with particles floating homogenously throughout. The head is white and creamy with a decent lacing.  Smells ridiciously sweet, I can tell its going to be quite viscous. Caramel malts with fruity hops taking a backseat, I can barely tell that there are any hops present through the smell. This would be an interesting beer to smell in a blind taste test.  Dayummm, this beer is sweet. Very sweet caramel malts with some dark fruity character, maybe fig or a rasiny influence. The sweet, fruity malts are immediately met with a strong citrusy hop character that seems to slowly aasimilate into the malt. This is very interesting, the hops and malts are both extremely powerful, it's as though the hops wrap themselves around the malts and then slightyyyy overpower them giving a pleasantly strong bitterness that almost anyone can enjoy. The finish, is silky smooth, sweet, bitter, earthy and overall fantastic.  The mouthfeel is great, viscious, and creamy for an ipa due to the high concentration of malts. I would even venture to say it has a slightly chewy quality to it. The carbonation is perfect as well.  If the beer wasnt so sweet I could drink this all day. The profound malt character gives it a heavy feel which is very enjoyable, however, a drawback is that it makes it nearly impossible to drink more than 2 in a session.  Overall this beer is fantastic, definitely a unique ipa thats a similar to a double ipa. If it had not been for the overwhelming malt character, this beer may have been 5's all across the board. While the hop character was strong, it was a little disappointing to see some of the the hops hidden behind the sweetness. I feel like a little less sweetness could be a literal perfect ipa. BUT, it still made for a truly fantastic beer that I would recommend to anyone.",Bear Republic Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,93
610,2751,FreshHawk,4.27,"A - Hazy apricot color with a moderate sized, creamy, slightly foamy, white head. Good retention leaving a nice, creamy lace.  S - Great citrusy aroma of grapefruit and orange along with a large floral aroma. Some peach and other fruity aromas as well. A touch of caramel backbone and only the faintest of pine. Very juicy and a great aroma making my mouth water.  T - Very floral flavor with citrus playing a close second. Has a good lasting bitterness as well. Has a decent caramel and bready malt in the background. Nice hoppiness with some lingering bitterness.  M - Medium body with a good level of carbonation. Has a slightly slick feel.  D - Goes down very easy with a nice hop and malt balance. A slight astringency and a lingering bitterness.  Notes: Pretty good IPA. Solid with a good level of hoppiness with a decent level of bitterness and malt to balance it out. Pretty strong floral/herbal flavors with citrus being second. Very tasty and would gladly have another. It may not be my absolute favor IPA, but it is up there.",Bear Republic Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,93
610,2751,Nugganooch,4.25,1st Review  A - Pours that golden straw IPA color with some slight orange hues. Medium frothy head with nice lacing.  S - Hop aroma is amazing. You get that great citrus-tangerine zing from the heavy late and dry hop additions associated with many of the great West Coast style IPA's. Touch of bready caramel malt sweetness underneath.  T - Tastes as good as it smells with an inital citrus and pine hop combination from the heavy use of American C hops. Has a nice bitter bite to it with the balance of soft caramelized malts. Lightly floral with some slight alcohol spice in the end but really well hidden otherwise. Just a great all around IPA.  M - Moderate to lighter body with a nice creamy texture. Residual sweetness and resinous with an upper level of hop bitterness. Finishes with a nice drying which balances things nicely.  D - A classic West Coast style IPA that never dissapoints.  Racer 5 is definitely a staple in my lineup. A great all around IPA. Being in CA it is a relatively cheap purchase for a bomber ($4) and never dissapoints when I need my Lupulin fix!,Bear Republic Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,93
610,2751,Avantyawn,4.25,"A: Nice coppery ambery murky IPA look to it. Very good. Nice head and lacing as the beer goes down.  S: The smell is truly impressive! More piney than citrusy. Very earthy, with bright floral notes. Fresh, sharp hops are the name of the game here.  T: Bright hoppy. earthy, grapefruit citrus at the end. Bitter and smooth finish, almost toasty at the end. The smell is slightly more interesting than the taste, yet still, a very solid IPA.  M: Starts thick, hoppy, and bitter. Ends thin , clean and watery. I like the start more than the finish.  D: I could easily pound 3 or 4 of these in a row. The clean smooth finish and the surprisingly undetectable alcohol taste at 7% leaves this a dangerously drinkable brew. Well done!  Note: I wish this were more readily available in 6 pack form in NYC. 5.99 a bomber , I don't think so, especially when their superior and stronger Hop Rod Rye is 5.99 a bomber, but a 9.99 6er I'd pick this up to mix it up once in a while.

I'm always willing to try new beers as the come on tap at my local bar, but this was by far one of the best. By far is the most drinkable IPA i have ever had. Not an overly alchol taste, sweet with citrus and balanced with hops. It was the perfect combination, about 7.5% ABV and it can sneak up quickly. Another must try.",Bear Republic Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,93
610,2751,JonathanG,3.87,"Variability within the 6-pack, as far as some sediment in one of the bottles. Would've rated appearance higher if there was consistency in the appearance.  Mouthfeel is lighter than some IPAs at the same strength, so this one is a bit easier to drink overall, i.e.: you can drink more than one fairly easily. Not as viscous or syrupy, and a bit drier/cleaner mid-palate overall.  With that being said, the first one I drank, I was only O.K. with. A bit different flavor profile than what I had been drinking lately in the IPA category... a bit more grain/cereal notes to it, so that threw me off. I had another one yesterday and liked it a bit better, even though it had minor yeast/sediment inclusions at the bottom of the bottle when I pulled it out of the refrigerator.

AROMA: A noticeably piney and citrusy hop scent permeate this beer.  FLAVOR: A definitely noticeable strong grapefruit, citrus hop note with a lighter piney hop taste. A great sweet, honey, caramel, malt flavor to finish, with some continued hop bitterness. Flavors definitely pop more as this warms, ideal temp is 45-50º per the bottle.  PALATE: A great IPA, with noticeably piney hop bitterness, balanced perfectly with a nice sweet malt note and dry finish. It's no wonder this brew has won many awards.  MOUTH FEEL: A light to medium carbonation, very creamy feeling.  NOTES: An enjoyable light to medium carbonated 7.0% ABV IPA that keeps you coming back.

Taste is heavy on the citrus without being either sweet or particularly overwhelming. No real malt components going on here, but that doesn't mean it's an intense hopbomb. I've had this on draft before and recall the hops being a lot more pungent. This is crisp and dry start to finish and full of citrus flavors without a sweet, mouth-coating aspect.  Mouthfeel is quite thin. As mentioned, none of the sticky-ness you expect form some West Coast IPAs.

610,2751,trevorjn06,3.5,"Jan 20th 2011: The first time I had this beer I hated it and it got my lowest rating of all the beers I've reviewed, however this is a highly rated IPA with a lot of hype around it so I decided to give it another shot.  Pours a golden/light copper color with a thin head the recedes to a fothy layer on the surface.  Aroma is quite nice, lots of fresh hops, grass, fruit, citrus, flowers, pine, spiciness and a bit of pungent-ness make up the nose. There is very little malt showing up here, but it's a strong IPA so to be expected.  Taste is some pale malt, grassy/hay-like hops and plenty of bitterness (though not so much as to overpower the sweetness). There are some pungent, flower-like flavors and a slight hint of caramel. The finish leaves sweet, grassy hops, spice and bitterness on the tongue.  Mouthfeel is medium/full bodied with average carbonation.  Overal this is a much better beer than the first bottle I reviewed. It is not quite up to the hype that I have heard but it is an inexpensive 22 oz. Bomber at $4.50. I would drink this again but wouldn't seek it out.  June 22 2010: Pours a nice IPA color :P It's golden/amber with one finger of head that recedes quickly.  Smell is up front West Coast hops with citrus, grapefruit and pineapple. There is a distinct cheddar aroma that I find very unpleasant, it seems to overpower most of the malt aromas though I detect a bit of sweet maltiness back there.  Taste is pretty well balanced, lightly sweet and grainy with moderate hop bitterness (for the style) and some nice floral and citrus notes. HOWEVER the cheddar aroma comes through here too, it's just not pleasant. There is a bit of pine on the finish.  Mouthfeel is medium with moderate carbonation.  Overall I was very let down by this beer, I had high expectations and there are some good things going for this brew but the cheesy/cheddar thing ruined it. I bought a bomber and couldn't finish it.",Bear Republic Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,93

610,2751,wolfinthemirror,4.07,"Poured from 12oz bottle in a tulip glass. Very hazy, definitely unfiltered as there is a lot of sediment in the beer. Not a lot of head, but i poured it gently to avoid some of the sediment at the end of the bottle.  Smells very floral, dank and citrusy. I'm picking up a lot of straight forward grapefruit pith, and not much else. Great smell.  Like the smell, there is a a lot of grapefruit and citric hops. Fairly bitter and definitely hop forward, but there is also a bit of sweet caramel like malt to balance, though not much. The more i drink it though, I'm starting to find some Piney flavors in addition to the citrus. Starts very strong and flavorful but gets a little watery towards the end as the beer warms.  Mouthfeel is medium bodied, somewhat low carbonation, and a little gritty.  Highly drinkable beer. Smooth, tasty and refreshing. After one i'm already beginning to feel a buzz from the 7% abv.

Aroma is a very nice blend of malts/biscuit, sweetness mixed with pine, some citrus and floral hops. Carbonation of the Racer 5 is very good. This is a very well balanced IPA. The taste is a perfect blend of malts and hops. The hops are evident up-front, followed by a sweetish/malty taste and a perfectly hoppy finish. Lacing persists throughout the course of this beer. Delicious and perfectly hopped, this IPA is very easy on the palate. Of course, by this I mean, easy on the palate of someone who enjoys the flavors of hops.

610,2751,CuriousMonk,4.5,"Honored to review one of my favorite IPAs. I've had several Racer 5s from tap as well as numerous bottles and bombers usually into a pint glass. Pours slightly hazy amber with off white one finger head. Nose of citrus and piney hops with a hint of malt. Flavor is incredible- hits harsh and bitter but subsides into an incredibly smooth aftertaste. Nice citrus (grapefruit) and pine elements. Palate is great- despite its ""pale ale"" status, it is actually quite rich and by no means watery or thin. Lots of alpha acids and great palate make this a definite winner any day!",Bear Republic Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,93

Bits of yeast in the glass and bottle post pour, might be older bottle or as mentioned in other posts ""they like yeast""  S: Lovely, fruity hop aroma. Smells delicous.  T: Flavor is good. Nice citrusy hop flavor at the start to match the nose, and finishes with the distinct bitterness. Nothing overpowering though. Strong up front, but easy at end.  M: Somewhat watery. Appearance of being clear, not hazy holds true even in the mouthfeel.  D: Very drinkable. The 7% ABV is there, as I felt it after drinking the bomber, but I could have definitely had another one.  Overall, a solid West Coast IPA. Obviously there are many better choices from that area but this is quite nice.",Bear Republic Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,93
610,2751,PeprSprYoFace,4.33,Can't believe I never reviewed this one. Picked it up so I can cross this one off the list.  Pours a light amber color. Slightly hazy but mostly clear. Nice sticky IPA type head created by the hops. Very nice lacing.  Aroma of citrus and pine hops. Typical California IPA aroma. Wish there was a bit more but not bad.  Taste is excellent. Hoppy but well balances for the style. Hops are the front runner with a pine/grapefruit taste dominant. Slight malt flavor rounds it out.  Mouthfeel is slightly on the thin side but not bad. Great carb.  Overall i love this beer and it's one I try to pick up every once in a while.

Mango, pineapple, bright lively hops and a slight hint of malty sweetness underlying it all. Medium to full body. Low carbonation. Palate doesn't lean as hard towards the hoppy side as my favorite IPAs but still quite resiny and piny. The hops are balanced relatively equally for the style with a roasted malt flavor but fresh hop taste wins out to dominate the finish.

Bouquet at first gives a weak bread smell, then to a simple faint grapefruit. Strangely it doesn't seem big on hops on the nose to me, as small as the smells on the nose are they are there and kind of make this quite pleasant.  Taste goes to a very straight forward simple citrus fruit orange.

Like orange rind and grapefruit combined in my mouth. Maybe a hint of tropical fruit.  M: Some carbonation but a little low on the carbonation makes it taste a little syrupy to me.

Very juicy.  Taste - so glad that the flavors of this one match right up to the nose. I was met with some very pleasant pine and citrus notes right off the bad. It vaguely reminded me of the way ghandhi-bot's flavors were. Very chewy, pine cone hops are more than present and the malts fill in the rest of the flavor very nicely.  mouthfeel - medium and chewy. the carbonation is just perfect for this IPA.  Drinkability - this is one drinkable IPA. Very delicious, and I would not have a problem having a few of these in one sitting.

Aromas are quite appetizing featuring floral and citrus hops with an underlying malty sweetness. Grass/straw aromas also exist with a faint earthiness.  The taste is similar featuring floral and citrus hops with hints of grass and pine all backed by a sweet malty mid-palate that eventually reverts back to the generous hop flavors.  Medium in body and carbonation with a puckering hops finish.  This is a very tasty IPA that is very well thought out and brewed.

Citrus nots, slightly piney, a little resiny. The flavors are nice, but pretty subtle, slightly malty. I'm questioning how fresh this bottle is. Although it's carbonated well, it's more on the thinner side. Drinkability isn't bad, but the flavors seem to be wearing off.

This is a West Coast style, with the refreshing, grapefruit hop taste but the body and finish left me a little wanting. I would guess this needs both an infusion of added hops and malt.

S - The nose on this beer is a little lighter than other comparable IPAs like Bell's Two Hearted. It has a nice piney, citrus hop smell with really no detectable malt. T - Taste is much the same as the nose. Piney, citrus, hoppy with a little sour finish. The flavor reminds you of grapefruit. Overall the flavor is very clean. M - The mouthfeel of this beer is light and crisp. The slightly higher alcohol content doesn't seem to give this beer any heaviness and really you get no sense of malt in the mouthfeel. Overall it's actually refreshing. D - Drinkability is where this beer really shines.

Hmm, no freshness date to be found and I took a chance on this one at $10 a six pack, and was in a cooler which perhaps has contributed to the freshness and hoppiness. Nothing worse than opening an IPA or APA and getting that stale smell, you know what I mean. Brewers, PLEASE, date code your beers, from a consumers standpoint it just isn't right not to. Anyway, fortunately smell greeted me with a big citrus hop twang, nice grapefruit and pine in there and some alcohol in the nose. Taste has nice malt backbone to help balance out some of the hops, overall a nice interplay between the two flavors and I can see how this is an APA as opposed to an IPA. A good residual blast of resinous piney hop aftertaste reminds me I'm drinking a west coast ale. Mouthfeel is rich and quite smooth and this beer is very drinkable for such a high ABV, big pale ale.

Sweet pale malt provides a backbone against which citrus flavors brace themselves to assault the palate. Lovely washes of orange, grapefruit, tangerine. The finish has a small burst of pine needles.

The beer is an amber/orange/copper color with a big off white head that slowly recedes leaving behind sheets of lacing that cover the glass.  The nose is full of big, in your face, citrusy hops. Just a beautiful aroma. Not much else going on, but really nothing else is needed. I am dying to get a taste of this beer.  The taste does not disappoint. The flavor is big and full of orange and grapefruit with just a hint of pineapple. I also get a second hop profile that is more piney and earthy. The malty base of this beer is small and unintrusive, just big enough to make its presence known, but not enough to detract from the focus of the beer... Citrusy Hops. Medium bodied and well carbonated, smooth mouthfeel and incredibly easy to drink.  A really well crafted IPA, very smooth and inviting. Definately one of my favorite IPAs now.",Bear Republic Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,93
610,2751,HopDiggityDawg,4.2,"22 oz Bomber  When trying new beers I am constantly looking for ones to add to my permanent rotation. This IPA makes it to the top portion of that list.  Aroma is what you would expect from an IPA.  Poors light orange, nice lacing.  Taste - A great balance of Hops and malt, a very smooth and balanced beer.  Drinkability - I would consider this a session beer, at 7% it is nothing to take lightly but the taste and quality of this beer would suggest that it is 9%+.  One small thing to mention, this beer was strongly recommended to me and I held of because I thought the labeling looked cheap and generic.

Citrus orange zest, pine and flowery hops  T: Follows the nose: Strong notes of flowey hops, orange zest  M: Light body, medium carbonation and nice bitter and grassy aftertaste  D: High.

610,2751,Chadpaq,4.47,"First beer from Bear Republic. Received it in a four-pack sampler with Dale's Pale Ale and two NC installments from Foothills: Hoppyum (IPA) and Seeing Double (DIPA). This baby was right in the middle of all of 'em, alcohol-wise.  This beer was extremely light, bordering upon sunshine yellow. Although I only have a 4.5 ounce portion of this stuff, the head is frothed nicely, and the very last of it simply will not recede...even after about fifteen minutes of dormancy.  Very floral smell...I'm not a big smell guy. Gimme taste or give me death.  ...And it delivers. I wrote down at the bar: ""All of the hops and none of the bite."" I don't know how Bear Republic has done it, but they have somehow managed to mellow the hops to where I still get the nice bitterness, but no punch-in-the-mouth at the culmination of each swig. Very impressive.  Carbonation's good here. The keg's very fresh. Slightly syrupy, but not overly so. Exactly what I would expect from a brew sitting at seven percent.  I could definitely session this stuff. If I could find a sixer of it anywhere, I could easily knock it out in an afternoon. Don't know what that says about me, but...hey, I just love good beer.  Don't know much about Bear Republic, but let's say I'll definitely be coming back to this company.

Has a straw gold color with moderate clarity. The hops are very present in the smell. Wow, the flavor is perfect; Pretty well-balanced with the hops being a bit more present than the malt. The malt hits first and is a bit sweet and syrupy. This gives way to the bitter hops and finishes with a lasting biting flavor. Moderate carbonation. I could have a number of these. The quintessential IPA.",Bear Republic Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,93

Beer pours a coppery amber with a faint head that quickly recedes and leaves a generous amount of lacing.  In my opinion, Racer 5 is one of the best smelling beers on the market. One whiff revels a cascade of piney and citrus hops aroma. It's the quintessential West Coast IPA aroma.  Taste is highlighted by an aggressive hops bitterness but is balanced out my the malt.  Medium bodied mouthfeel. For a beer topping out at 7.0%, Racer 5 is ridiculously drinkable. In my opinion, this one of the best IPAs available at the moment. It never fails to deliver.",Bear Republic Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,93
610,2751,LacquerHead,4.1,I poured this into a Sam Adams pint from a 12oz bottle.  A: light amber with an orange hue. Slightly hazy with a foamy head  The aroma was pine mixed with citrus. There was also a malty smell in the background.  The taste was similar to the aroma. It had a dry sour hop taste that included pine and citrus rind. This also had a good malt profile that provided a nice caramel roasted flavor. For the most part the ABV was not noticeable in the taste.  M/F: light carbonation  Drinkability: give me a 6-er and I'm good  Overall: this is one of the better American IPA's that is readily available. The malt profile is what makes this one stand out for me. I like the interplay between the sour hops and the malt. It is simple but it works.,Bear Republic Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,93
610,2751,laituegonflable,3.68,"Pours a burnished amber colour with off-white head, moderate upon pouring, good retention. Lace is very good indeed. Thick, curtainy, like a funeral veil. Slow bead; yeah looks pretty good.  Smell is citric. Very hoppy with slight resinous notes. Lemon, lime, slight woodiness and a hint of wax. Slight malty undercurrent. Raisiny edge to the malt. Quite nice, but not mind-blowing as an IPA.  Taste is quite nice. Malty for the most part with raisiny edges and an apricot tinge, cake-batter sweetness and then hop notes come in midway. Citric and quite tangy, without a lot of complex hop flavour but provides a nice floral finish that hangs around pleasantly. Again pretty good but could use more hop flavour.  Nice and filling mouthfeel, good texture atop a nice body. Suits the style and the flavour well.  A good solid IPA. It isn't blowing my mind, but there's lots of nice West Coast hop character and a good balance struck for nice easy drinking.",Bear Republic Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,93

I would love to give it a 5.0 rating for drinkability but I do not believe I can truly justify it yet.",Bear Republic Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,93
610,2751,bobhits,4.7,"Pours a light orange yellow color. A huge fluffy head with ok lacing, very white and very American IPA at its heart.  My nose it a touch congested but I think I'm able to smell well enough to judge this. There isn't a huge hop aroma, but it certainly is there. Grape fruit, lemon, zesty, yet a sweetness from the malt.  The taste is very hop forward. A huge hop presence biting the tongue giving off grape fruit notes all over the place. The finish has a distinct almost buttery caramel malt flavor which I really like.  A good bite, crisp hop finish and a lingering malt flavor at the end. This is darn drinkable an darn enjoyable to drink.  A true shame I can't get this locally and only have this one bottle. Reminds me a good bit of stone IPA but the malt has more a role in this one and well I can't say one is better or not but I'd love to make a choice between them from time to time.  This is an IPA at its best. There are many that could be describe this way but I think this one does a few things exceptionally. First, the carbonation is just wonderful. Second, while having a wonderful hop forward attack the malt shines wonderfully in the back. Finally, the mouth feel here is beyond exceptional.

It seems I will have to review this one from memory. Good thing I have it fairly often.  Smell: This is one of the best examples of how a hoppy west coast IPA smells. Huge citrus presence makes the pine take a backseat. Although the smell isn't particularly incredible, it is exactly what I am looking for as far as IPAs go.  Taste: No surprise here, tastes like it smells. Big grapefruit taste, some wet pinecones. West Coast IPA to the T.  This is made exactly like a west coast IPA should be, but unfortunately it just doesn't quite compete with the big dogs.

D - Awesome crisp and juicy with a clean, semi grapefruit and mixed citrus bitter finish makes for a highly drinkable beer. As expected, letting this warm a bit pumps up the bitter finish, still very nice. The $4 per bomber price tag also exponentially helps drinkability, wish I could give this a 6/5.

Aroma is fantastic. Bright citrus hops erupt from the golden liquid, mingling with a barely present alcohol element.  Taste is among the best American IPAs I've had. A sharp bitter bite gives way to juicy, juicy hops. The bitterness gives way to a slight sweetness before morphing back into a slightly bitter aftertaste. This is a classic west coast citrus bomb.

610,2751,Bombers4Benedict,4.45,"For around $5 you can't find a better IPA, in my humble opinion. This one won't knock your head off like others but delivers all the heavy hoppyness you expect from an IPA while maintaining a light, drinkable side.  A - Gold, almosth lagerish body with a nice thick head that produces wonderufl lacing througout the glass.  S - A boost of citrus hops marry a grainy earthy finish, with hints of oatmeal.  T - What starts as a boost of orange on the tongue takes a slightly sour turn releasing a grapefuit precense and finishes with a malty alcohol salutation. Although I feel the alcohol is more present here than other IPA's it is balanced so well I actualy would be let down without it.  M - clean, fresh; a nice amount of carbonation boosts those sensations. Lingers in mouth for quite a while after a drink but not because of the odd IPA film that is sometimes left in the mouth.  D - All night long baby. Light enough to ""keep em coming"" and heavy enough to know you're drinking a real beer.

N: Citris; grapefruit and orange; with a slight hint of pine needles.  T/M: Citrus, pine, and a honey sweetness that is almost like peach or pineapple. (This sweetness really comes to the forefront when I eat a jalapeño.) Rich and flavorful with little lingering bitterness, as with many IPA. This has a very complex taste for a single IPA, in my opinion. There is a light touch of maltiness, but this remains fairly hidden due to the great hopping. This beer is a bit thick on the mouth--very oily--but it goes down very easily. It is hard to believe this has 7%ABV!

First sip the beer seems unassuming, but it proves to be one of the best I have had. Great bitter levels, not too much for an IPA, but enough to remind you this is West Coast. Great mouthfeel, plenty of Munich malts in this beauty. This has to be one of the best balanced IPAs I have ever tried - some piney, some citrus, some deliciousness.

610,2751,SkunkWorks,4.12,"12 oz bottle into a pint glass.  Look: hazy orange color. Its slightly cloudy as you'd expect from a bottle conditioned beer. The head is a little thin at about one finger. Its white and doesn't last for very long and doesn't leave much lace.  Smell: If there's any doubt that hops are closely related to marijuana, smelling a Racer 5 should remove that doubt. Big nose filled with huge, citrusy hop aromas and serious earthiness.  Taste: big hop flavor. Citrus flavors are out in front with some pine and earthiness and the malt lurking in the background with honey, toffee and bready flavors. This is one of the hoppier IPAs I've had, which I like.  Feel: medium bodied, just right in terms of carbonation, and very bitter. I wouldn't call this a balanced beer at all. Its a little dry.  Drink: had no problem finishing my glass, but probably wouldn't have that many of these because of the bitterness.  Overall, this is a hop head's dream.

610,2751,keith712,4.6,"22oz bomber poured into a 1.5l hefeweizen glass (I know, but I like the scoring inside it for the head/bubbles).  Appearance: Medium golden amber, light to medium head that thins out but hangs around a bit with a steady 1/8"" head and lacing. Good looking beer as it should be.  Nose: Big hops of course, as an IPA should be. Some citrus/grapefruit in there, and a touch of something sweet? Malts? A little pine for good measure as well.  Flavor: Booyah! Good hops attack immediately, followed by a citrus tone and even slightly sweet (not sugar sweet) with some yeasty malts in there! Interesting! Finishes very clean and leaves a sweet lemon presence. Wow. Going through the glass as it warms, definitely the malts come out a bit more and it gets slightly sweeter. Again, not a bad thing.  Mouthfeel: Carbonation is OK, just enough. Slightly thick at first but dissipates fast leaving me wanting more. The hops, while strong, also dissipate fast. Almost...creamy, like an imperial IPA...  Drinkability: Dangerously so! As it finishes so clean it is very easy to grab another mouthful. I would never know that this is a 7% abv beer. Surprising, I thought it would be a slower drinking IPA.  Summation: I like. I like alot. I am still learning IPA's so I guess I expect the good ones to be very similar, then something comes along and surprises me. This IPA seems simple (in a good way) but actually there is more there than meets the eye (or palate). The character changed over a 20 minute period, maintaining the original presence but getting more complex at the same time. Nice. I give this a very solid 9.

S: Fresh hops, pine, grapefruit, a hint of orange juice. Some caramel malty sweetness comes out as it warms.  T: Alcohol very well hidden here. The slightly caramel-sweet malt backbone is there to be just enough support, and then the pine and citrus blend together beautifully. The finish is both bitter and fruity, something I don't come across often with IPAs. The synergy between citrus hops, pine bitterness, and malt is great!  F: Medium, nice and full coating. Just chewy enough. Great body that keeps me sipping.  D: A big IPA for sure, and I could do a few of these in a night.

S: It smells like my birthday. My birthday smells like dank citrusy hops with a pinch of flowery esters, it gives me goosebumps.  T: This beer is complex AND simple. There are more flavors then I can pick out but the citrusy and slightly herbal hops take me to my happy place. Every sip leaves me wanting more. The robust flavor is balanced and smooth.  M: Heavy and strong. This is what an IPA is supposed to feel like.  D: Leaves you craving more. Just as you start to grasp everything about the flavor its time to swallow. I have had this beer many times, I love it, it loves me and I will definitely drink it again and again.",Bear Republic Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,93
610,2751,juju7,4.18,"A class IPA. Great look; head retention was fantastic, sexy lace. A nice mixed nose of grass, pine, hints of tropical fruits and nicely integrated malt notes. Solid bitterness and a full, well balanced mouth feel. Aftertaste is long, persistent and pleasant. Overall a really sexy beer that has balance and flavour in spades. A good benchmark.",Bear Republic Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,93
610,2751,Greggy,3.65,"A- Pours a 1/2 finger sticky off white head with some clinging lace. The body is light orange/honey colored with ample yeasties holding still in suspension.  S- Good bits of pineapple, grapefruit, a bit of green apple skins, also slightly herbaceous.  T- Starts out with a very balanced malt and hopiness with notes of pine, some breadiness, alcohol is felt prior to the finish. The finish has a bit of dry maltiness but a lingering bit of anise which is kind of odd.  M- The body is big but the carbonation feels a bit low.  D- Overall, a decent IPA. I wouldn't likely have again.",Bear Republic Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,93

Very crisp and fresh. Makes me look forward to the first taste.  Taste: Once again, boatloads of citrus (orange, pineapple, lemon) up front and in the middle of the swallow. Very crisp flavor, with a bit of floral hops and even more piney hops on the back end. Slightly bitter finish. Super refreshing and great taste.  Mouthfeel/Drinkability: A bit under medium bodied with good carbonation combines for a smooth mouthfeel. Overall, one hell of an IPA. Every time I have this I'm impressed.

Its smells of the typical piney, fruit hops with little noticable sweetness. Taste is excellent with hops up front and a touch of malt in the background. The mouthfeel is medium body with a nice creaminess to it. Very drinkable and the ABV is at a good point. This beer is delicious and extremely well balanced.

610,2751,BuckyFresh,4.2,"Appearance: Poured from a 12oz bottle into a large wine glass. Pours a light golden color with a creamy white one-finger head. The retention is good; the lacing is really good. Some columns of carbonation are visible, as are some yeast chunks at the bottom of the glass.  Smell: Great citrus hop aroma. I'm getting some lemon, grapefruit, pineapple, and a pretty pronounced yeast aroma for an IPA (which I like!). Good balance between the hops and the malt backbone. The aroma seems to get sweeter and more floral the longer it sits.  Taste: Creamy texture and delicious! There is a pretty good punch of malt on the front end, but the hops grab hold of your tongue towards the end, ushering your taste buds into a pretty dry, bitter finish. I always enjoy it when what you taste at the beginning of the sip is far different than what you get at the end.  Mouthfeel: Medium-bodied, with a creamy texture and a dry, hoppy finish.  Drinkability: Very hoppy, but drinkable.

610,2751,krausenman,4.27,"A-The beer pours an amber/dark golden color with some sediment at the bottom of the bottle. It appears that the sediment is hops rather than yeast.  S-The beer has a strong hop nose. In one sniff, you can pick out resinous vegital aromas in the background that follows a ripe fruit smell that is further surpassed by the citrus aroma of domestic style American hops. It's complex to say the least.  T-You can taste and initial malt sweetness that is followed by a definate hop bitterness that fills your mouth. As you swallow the beer, the bitterness fades towards the back of the throat.  M-It has a medium body that is accompanied by a moderate to low carbonation.  D-The beer is approachable for a new beer drinker but still retains enough characteristic hop aroma and flavor to be unique.

Orange and malt sweetness lingers nicely with the hops.  Mouthfeel is lite-med body, tight tiny carbonation zip, hop bite and dryness on tongue with mild alcohol warmth.

S:Fills the nose with delicious citrus, tropical, and grapefruit hops. Nice sweet malts are included in the mix, very inviting.  T:Just as the nose suggest big juicy citrus/tropical hops hit the palate up front followed up by some balancing sweet malts. The backend is left with a small but pleasing bite of bitterness.  M:A very nice body with excellent carbonation, refreshing to say the least. Palate is left a little dry but begging for more.  D:This was a super enjoyable bottle that I received in a trade, juicy hops really come thru but are balanced out quite nicely. Easy to drink, very tasty, and as far as I know reasonably priced.

610,2751,Messiahbolical,3.94,"Here's my first Beer Advocate review, picked this one up in a 22 oz bomber at Bevmo for around $4.  A - Pours a beautiful cloudy light orange color, massive amounts of lacing sticking down the sides of the beer indicating that this beer is extremely fresh. Mild carbonation. Looks great... one of the best looking beers I've had.  S - Picking up lots of citrus notes right off the bat, orange and lemon peel present with large pine undertone throughout each sniff. Not the most intense smelling IPA out there, but smells pleasant nonetheless. I just wish the smell was a bit stronger though.  T - A mild, malty sweetness hits right away for split second then fades away with a following pine bitterness that sticks to the back of your tongue and slowly fades away. This really reminds me of a hoppier Sierra Nevada Pale Ale, it's damn good. Not themost balanced IPA I've had, but it tastes damn good and is right there near the top as far as flavor goes.  M - Surprisingly light for the style and goes down smooth.  D - Despite it being light for the style, the beer looses points here for moderate ABV% and bitterness that stays around for a while. It has decent drinkability, but also definitely not sessionable. Mid of the road for this category. Also, it's a bit pricey compared to some other comparable beers so I don't know if you'd want to spend that much to session this anyways.  All in all, it's a pretty good beer though. I'd definitely pick it up again if I wanted a solid IPA that goes down smooth and isn't overly bitter. I liked it alot and I'd recommend it to any IPA fan. It's worth a try, pick it up if you see it.",Bear Republic Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,93
610,2751,Jemonster,3.9,"A: First of all, I don't know if I got a funny bottle or what, but this beer was straight up chunky. Not ""just a little sediment at the bottom"", but large off-putting blobs of what I hope and assume was yeast throughout the glass, in suspension, after I poured it into a stein. I actually strained it into a another glass.  S: Good mostly. Sweeter smelling than most IPAs.  T: Very good! Clean and sweet with the hops coming through strong at the very end in the aftertaste.  M: Creamy and rich.  D: I could session these, but I would have to take the time to strain it. Ugh.",Bear Republic Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,93
610,2751,SpdKilz,4,"Had on tap last night.  Appearance - Given to me in a standard pint glass, with about a finger of head that dissipates relatively fast leaving little lacing.  Smell - Grapefruit, pint, and hops. Slight malt backbone.  Taste - Similar to the nose. Bitter fruits, pine, hops. Not much malt backbone. A very hop forward beer.  Mouthfeel - Medium bodied, moderate carbonation, dry finish.  Drinkability - Relatively so. Drank this quite easily. Yes, as I always freaking say, I would chose many other IPA's out there rather than this, but hey, not bad on tap and would get again if there was nothing better to drink.",Bear Republic Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,93
610,2751,kreeper,4.03,I didn't find this IPA as nice as the other Bear republic brews.. but still an excellent brew. Deep copper color with ample froth which lightly laced the glass. Nose is hoppy with pine really standing out. A gentle bitterness which is nice and the way I personally like IPA's to be. Good to the finish with consistent flavor throughout.,Bear Republic Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,93
610,2751,Wisconsuds,4.62,"First off, let me say that IPAs are usually not my go-to style. More often than not, I reach for a porter or a stout. That being said, on to the review.  I've had this on tap as well, but will be reviewing from a 12oz bottle pour. Settled nicely into my Milwaukee Brewers pint glass. A dark golden orangish glow filled it immediately, with about an inch or so of white, foamy, crackling head. Glorious.  Fruity notes of pine, lemon, and a blast of fresh hops overload my senses immediately. The freshness literally packs a wallop.  The taste, oh the taste. At first, your tongue gives way to a piney citrus character. It sits for a few sweet seconds, then gives way to a sharp, bitter note in the finish. This beer is remarkable. So much complexity upon first few sips. Drinking this beer is like riding a carousel. Hops, sweetness, slight bitterness; repeat. (For best results, do not drink riding on a carousel)  A medium-body to the beer just makes you want to drink more. The perfect amount of carbonation here. Not overbearing as some IPAs tend to be.  By far my favorite IPA. Could drink these forever and not grow tired of it. Alcohol is VERY well masked at 7%. If you can pick some up, I highly recommend doing so.",Bear Republic Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,93
610,2751,jbowers56,4.65,"A pretty nearly white head which fades to a thin bubbly layer. Leaves nice lacing but head retention isn't superb. Pieces of hop material floating around too. I like that, lets me know what I'm in for.  As soon as I popped the bottle the aroma jumped out at me. Reminds me a little of stone ipa, however the citrus notes have more juice and apparent sweetness to them. I also get a peach note, as well as some caramel and apricot. Very god damn good.  At this point im pretty annoyed that this is only the first time i've had this. This is god damn awesome. First up is a juicy peach/apricot/citrus hop flavour, backed up by some slightly short-bread and caramel like sweetness. Following that is a big slap of pine and grapefruit and some bitterness. Love it.  Thin, but not watery. Clean and zesty on the palate. Near perfect for an IPA.  I am going to have to chain myself down after this to stop myself grabbing another. It's that delicious.",Bear Republic Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,93

That's about it, the low spot of the beer.  T- LOVE the flavor complexity of racer five. Initial Pine/Grapefruit hops, much like the nose, but then it smooths out to a biscuit malt flavor with that wonderful apricot sweetness. Ends with a bitterness/dryness that's just enough to make you want the next sip.  M- feels thicker than it looks with just enough carbonation. Almost creamy initially in the mouth.  D- Really, really nice change up from most IPA's. Highly drinkable.

Nice golden orange with intiial finger head that dropped to maybe half a finger, then dissipated completed when I was half way through the glass. Good carbonation visible through the clear beer.  Citrus peel dominates the nose, mostly grapefruit and orange peel.  The taste follows the nose exactly, nicely bitter from the citrus like hops. Not quite as vibrant in those qualities as I've had with other west coast IPA's, but still pretty good. The carbonation did a good job of cleansing the palate, with only a very brief bitter aftertaste.  A light bodied beer with good carbonation. Very drinkable, and affordable as a session beer. Pretty widely available here in the Bay Area.",Bear Republic Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,93
610,2751,plumcrazyfx,4.15,Got this on a Wisconsin beer run. Pours with a nice big head that stuck around for quite a while. The flavor is mostly hops with a light bready malt that barely fought its way through - you get more malt as this warms which I think improves the flavor. The hop here are mostly bitter with a very little sweet charatcer that helps to round it out. I thought this was a very good beer but I don't know if I'd make it a regular. There are just too many others that I prefer to it.,Bear Republic Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,93

610,2751,hopsbreath,4.57,"So...I've had this beer a few times on cask/draft and was at the beer store today when the guy brought a fresh case out to the floor. For $4.29 I said ""what the hell"" and grabbed a bomber. Only just now I looked at my old reviews to find out what I gave this beer a 3.25 and said ""what the hell""? This beer is way better than that. Its time for a re-review.  Pure gold crystal clear body has a 3 finger creamy butterscotch head when poured down the middle into my Portsmouth snifter. A good but not great cap is a little wispy and great but not fantastic lacing decorates the glass as the drink recedes. I really do love these lighter colored IPA's.  Mmmmm...hoppy, hoppy, hoppy pine oils and bright citrus are the stars with no meddling malts to get in the way. Good stuff going on here.  Palate destroying hop oils, spruce tips, grapefruit peal, and bare minimal malt make this a stand out. Is this as good as IPA's taste? For my buds its a resounding YES!  Its a little sticky and gummy but the carbonation is spot on from the bottle. This is the one area where I believe the cask version falls short. The cask is just a little too soft in the mouth.  Damn, this goes down faster than a prom date who hit the spiked punch a little too hard! I really need to stock this more often when its as fresh as this. All I can think about my previous review is that the bottle must have been old. Since Sculpin isn't available around here, this might just be my IPA of choice at the minute! Twelve ounce bottle poured into a pint glass. A couple fingers of fluffy white head show up atop the mostly clear gold body. Appropriate lacing shows throughout.  Earlier Review: 3.25 overall  Smell is sweet tangerine, hop oil, and wildflower honey. A little better than average but nothing I haven't smelled before.  Taste has a little old biscuit, sweet citrus, and grapefruit pith. Some metallic aftertaste rears its ugly head on the finish.  Mouthfeel is a little sticky on the finish with moderate mouthfeel and appropriate carbonation. Drinkability is a little gummy but the 12 ounce pour was not hard to finish.  I won't be buying this one again. There are to many other IPA's out there I prefer to this one.

The hops are there, but they don't hang around long.  M - Medium mouthfeel. Very crisp, refreshing, and smooth.  D - Very drinkable. Perhaps this bottle is a little old.

Great scents and I'd had a cold all week so my last few reviews I had to work to define any aromas.  Flavor The Malt bill sneaks in to do a moments tease of caramel,brown sugar,coffee,but the hops are the headliner act and as best I can tell almost every type I'd ever encountered seems to be playing in this band. Floral,Fruity,Pine ,Cedar..whatever, they all get their moment. The ""Wine Country"" aesthetic keeps Bear from taking this to excess,it's not as big as a Hop Wallop but is at least that complex  Mouthfeel....The malt bill is backup vocals but does the job in mouthfeel, which is rather rich for an IPA. Carbonation is just perfect. Aftertaste is good with multiple hops and a bit of dark roast coffee at first,then a lingering cascade type finish.  Drinkability. Bud,you could pound these till they drag you away. Not session ABV but it's built to drink. They did the hop stuff more for complexity and elegance than sheer bitterness. Refreshing yet profound. I regret I'd skipped over this so many times. I'd had several Bear Republic beers in my decades in N Cal and now, after moving away I finally tried Racer.",Bear Republic Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,93
610,2751,dubc19382,3.65,"Poured into a pint glass, the Racer 5 IPA had a nice golden/amber hue with a head that fizzled out after about a minute.  Good taste for an IPA, but I have had hoppier beers that were considered an ""IPA"".  As for drinkability, it is highly reccommended, but I would at least try it on tap first. Like previous comment(s), I wish it had a date on it as to when it was bottled. Perhaps it might have been affected by the long ride east.",Bear Republic Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,93
610,2751,newk340,4.02,A: a yeasty orange gold color with a thin head and some mild carbonation.  S: a sharp smell of citrus and hops.

610,2751,musicman575,4.47,"Just an update from my previous review:  This is delicious! Disregard all that I said before....  It's hoppy enough, but not as pungent as a lot of other IPAs. There shouldn't be a gray area with IPA. Get it crazy hopped up or call it something else.  There's something primitively masculine about drinking a beer that has solids floating around in it. My Western Civilization professor once described a beer from feudal Europe that contained chewable chunks and was considered part of one's daily nutrition. Gimme some of that! I was able to get an inch or so of head, but I really tried. After the initial pour, a nice bubbly film stuck around to see the last chug.  This is a very light beer. A light sweetness accompanies the grapefruity hops. There isn't much else to it, which makes it rather dry. I might have got an old beer (maybe they should put a date on the bottle). There was bit of a stale, sour taste and the alcohol was rather strong when I breathed out from my nose. The hops never cleared themselves, obscuring the subtleties with every drink.",Bear Republic Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,93

The taste is just like the aroma. Very bitter, no balancing malt. A little too bitter for my taste. Grapefruit peeling, floral hops, and pine flavors, not much else  High carbonation, dry, with a long bitter finish. I like hoppy bitter beers, but not bitterness which lacks complexity.

Unfiltered stuff floats around :)  Smell - Hops, citrus, light alcohol and malts, some spices  Taste - Piney hoppy kick starts off. Some oranges and grapefruit overtones. The malts are tangy and yummy. This is a standard hoppy ipa done very well. Pretty strong, about as strong as you can get before treading into imperial territory.  Mouthfeel - Bitter hops cover your whole mouth. Your palette will be a little wrecked, but not ruined. The aftertaste leaves your mouth a little dry and begging for more.

Spotty lacing litters the glass along with a light head and a small filmy retention of foam.  S - Nice bouquet of citrus, hops, malt, caramel, and assorted tropical fruits.  T - Begins with a wave of hoppy citrus which carries from beginning to end. Bitter juicy hops explode from the inital sip, and eventually emitting pineapple and grapefruit. A slightly sweet malt backbone balances everything out but still allows the hops to cry out. The booze is masked well with a dry, yet bitter finish.  M/D - Medium body, bubbly, dry with hops, but still goes down incredibly easy considering the style.  Awesome IPA.

This particular bomber of Racer 5 has some sort of cryptic freshness code but it tastes so sweet and drinks so g.d. gushy I've got the urge to verbal.  Perhaps the perfect look for standard IPA. Honey pale, active head and damn near masterpiece lacing. Smells like Bubbalicious - Mango, Cotton Candy, or something equally nostalgic. If this were a strain of chronic it would be all I'd buy.  Taste is arctic wind, cleansing citral grains all blown out in a storm replacing Greenland with South Florida.  I could drink this all night long.",Bear Republic Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,93

Reminds me somehow of a farmhouse ale - seems a little funky. Squarely hopped - it doesn't mess around in getting straight to the point. Floral, bitter, no spice. It is though a bit of a tongue-slap, not being as smooth as I'd prefer, instead being mildly sharp at the end.  Dry, but sparkling on the tongue.  I feel like I should have enjoyed this one much more than I did - no doubt, it's a good beer. Really solid in its merits.

610,2751,gfreed,3.8,"On a hot night this is a nice thing to drink. Very piney aroma; leathery smell with a very sharp edge. There's even the smell you get when you pull a strip of scotch tape from the roll-- something you will remember from your grammar-school days, I'm sure. Very tight flavor, full of little pins from the abundant carbonation. It starts out resinous and loaded with pine needles, but mellows into a peachy taste when it warms up. I couldn't drink such a thing in the winter but it's welcome in August.",Bear Republic Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,93
610,2751,infi,3.85,"Poured into a nonic pint.  A light golden orange pour with a foamy and frothy white head with retention of about a minute or so. Within the actual liquid are some floating bursted vesicles, like from an orange or lemon. Pretty ghastly looking, but not a problem. Lots of webby lacing throughout the glass. Smell is incredibly malt and hop balanced. It begins with a nice malt sweetness and then falls back upon the power of the Cascade and Centennial hoppage and grapefruit. Very California IPA.  The taste is thoroughly and beautifully hoppy. All the way around. Double rainbow. The hoppiness isn't very overpowering either: it's bitter, yet smooth with subtle hints of citrus pith and skin. Very herbal and remedying in character for the night. At the end, the brew leaves a nice clean and slight dry feeling, along with some alcoholic warmth.  Mouthfeel is more partial to being more medium-bodied, with the carbonation at a moderately light level. Drinkability is decently high - quite flavorful and easy drinking. Admirable example of a Cali IPA; worthy of your buy.",Bear Republic Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,93
610,2751,lester619,4.12,"Pours a somewhat hazy orangish amber brown IPA color. Some small sediment floating around. The head was a little thin on the first one, even with an agressive pour. The rest of the six pack was a little thicker. Average lacing for an IPA. It has a really good fresh hoppy herbal/floral grapefruit smell. Nice. Taste starts out with a hard bitterness that blends into a biscuity malty body and eventually turns into that hoppy grapefruit piney herbal flavor that you expect from an IPA. This reminded me of Stone's IPA with that little hint of burnt rubber on the back of my tounge. All in all this is another example of the greatness that is very hoppy west coast beer.

Smooth citrus and melon flavors start off a tad sweet but end up drying out a bit on the piney hop fade. Lots of good juicy hop flavor without much astringency at all.

Looks: perfectly clear pale golden-orange, poured almost to the brim with very little head save a tiny, frothy white layer that quickly becomes film and a ring. Nice webs of lace speckle the glass at first, but they too dissipate.  Smells: super citrusy. Tart lemon and grapefruit, light burnt sugar and honey.  Tastes: like grapefruit peel. A blast of citrus is followed immediately by a startling pithy bitterness that coats the tongue. Tons of grapefruit juice, a bit of lime, some grass, and a hint of honey and strawberry in the back.  Feels: carbonation is medium-high, assertive but not distracting. The body is surprisingly full and syrupy. It's a pleasure to swirl about the mouth. Alcohol warmth is noticeable as it rides down the throat.  Drinks: like a happy accident. I have to admit, I came here looking for Racer X and found 5. But I'm glad I gave it a try.

610,2751,Jeffo,4.21,"Got this at Binny's Downtown Chicago on our recent baseball trip.  From a bomber into a snifter.  APPEARANCE: Pours a two finger, medium-thick white head with good retention. Orange-red in color but more tangerine when held to the light. Clear with higher levels of carbonation evident. Head slowly fades to a decent foam cap and leaves some lacing right away. A good wisp remains until the end and leaves lots of nice lacing down the glass. Second pour from the bomber is a cloudier version of the above. Very nice looking brew.  SMELL: Pale malts with some sweet pineapple and a good dose of citrus and piney hops. Grapefruit and floral hints in there as well. Medium strength and pleasant.  TASTE: Pale malts with lots of citrus and piney hop flavors. Lots of bitterness on the finish, with some sweet pineapple to balance out the bitter hops. A bitter and mostly piney aftertaste is bold and lingering. Pretty tasty and very bold for an IPA.  PALATE: Medium body and medium carbonation. Creamy smooth and full on the palate, goes down fine and finishes a little mouth-coating. A bit of a bite at the finish. Good feel for the style.  OVERALL: A very good IPA. This is probably one of my favorite in the style, and if it were local to me, I'd probably drink it all the time. Bold flavors with a great look and feel, really only the aromas need to be brought up a notch. Regardless, this is a very good example of the style and worth checking out if you get the chance.

There were some tiny flakes of sediment present in every pour. S: Big grapefruit and citrus aroma with notes of pine. Most of the malt is overpowered. T: Follows the nose with a more balanced malty taste. Light cracker-like flavor. Good bitter punch at the finish. Loads of lemon notes as well. Nectar like quality.

Almost a saaz-like hop aroma - herbal spiciness that is quite appealing and clean. I don't get the typical citrus of many IPA's.  T. That clean, crisp aroma carries over to the palate. Atypical IPA flavors that work well start things off - spice, herbs, and bready malt followed by a pine infused lingering finish.  M. Silky smooth - this stuff leaves a lingering feel in your mouth.

610,2751,TCgoalie,4.12,"Thank you to friend zoso1967 for this bottle!  Poured into an oversized wine glass, an aggressive pour yields a small amount of head. A good collection of bubbles form on the side and swirl at the top to ease my mind. Small bubbles stick and slide down the glass forming moderate lacing. The color is copper-yellow with a slight essence of brown.  The smell is very pleasant reminding me of other California IPA's with its pine hop scent. Subtle citrus notes of pineapple with some peach gather with the pine. There is a solid malt backbone adding to the firm balance of smells.  The first thing I notice with the taste is its mild malt profile. The flavor starts very mildly with a slight crescendo into the pine hop profile. Some lemon flavors exist in the hop profile along with a very, very, slight skunkiness.  I believe one of the strong points of this brew is the mouthfeel. It was the first thing I noticed, creamy and non-obtrusive. The aftertaste is mild with a slight drying.  The mouthfeel really paves the way for an excellent drinkability.

The hops are citrusy and almost taste like candy.. Not much pine. This one tastes really good... Not sure how fresh the bottle is though.  M - Medium body, medium carbonation. Bitterness lingers in the mouth until the next drink. Not great, not bad.  D - Pretty impressive for an IPA, especially at 7%.

610,2751,cbutova,4.8,"Bottled May 24, 2010, hopefully I can find a fresher one soon enough.  A- Orange amber with a off-white head that doesn't reach impressive heights. Dies down at a fairly quick to a cloud and ring that sustain themselves. Some big chunks float around in this one. Somehow my entire glass is coated with lace after a sub-par head.  S- If someone wanted to know what a hop smelled like, this is where they should go. A blast of that Cali citrus, almost sweet fruity hop right off the bat. A strong caramel backbone supports the hops. Great overall aroma strength.  T- Once again, you have to come back to this beer to experience the true staple of a modern IPA flavor. Opens with general earthy, pine hop flavor and finishes with a great citrus, fruity hop flavor unlike almost anything else. Caramel notes come in the beginning and bread hints support the finish. Pine becomes more and more prevalent as I sip onward but it only adds to the great balance. Some sweetness but it is just divine.  MF- Moderate body supports a very flavorful beer. The carbonation is fairly high and slightly stings the taste buds. Creamy. Fairly bitter, at a level that does not interfere with the great flavor.  DB- I have had this one several times before but I have never really sat down with it until now. This beer is in every store for a reason, it is a truly iconic IPA. One that will probably outlast 99% of the style during the inevitable test of time.

Less malt balance than some other seven percent IPAs. However, nothing blew me away but would try more from Bear Republic.",Bear Republic Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,93
610,2751,beerdrifter,4.32,"Clear caramel, copper pour with quickly fading head and great lacing. Big West Coast piney, citrus nose with a nice caramel malt background. The taste is perfectly balanced with the sweet bready malts complementing the bitterness of the hops. Tangerines dominate the citrus side. The finish is crisp and dry with with a slightly resiny, chewy mouthfeel. The balance makes this extremely drinkable. A great beer from a great brewery!",Bear Republic Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,93
610,2751,Huhzubendah,4.08,"Racer 5 (should it be called Racer V?) appears a very clear yellow hue with many particulates meandering about the vessel. The scents are floral and hops, with just a hint of citrus. The taste is quite good, though not in the uppermost echelon of American IPAs / DIPAs. The alcohol is hidden pretty well. There is a nice, sticky hop feel, especially noticeable in the aftertaste. I'd happily drink this again.",Bear Republic Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,93
610,2751,billab914,4.37,"Poured from a 22oz bottle into my Surly shaped pint glass. Poured clear and amber in color. It started with a very nice frothy white head that quickly started to leave chunks of lacing on the glass. The head had average retention but left excellent lacing as I drank it.  The aroma has a very juicy hop presence to it with some grapefruit, pineapple, mango and a hint of pine coming through. Excellent hoppy aroma overall.  The taste also shows some of the juicy, tropical hoppy flavors. Some pineapple, grapefruit and a bit of peach all come out in the intense hoppiness. A moderate bitterness comes through in the finish. Beautiful hoppy flavor overall.  The mouthfeel is on a little below medium bodied and carbonation is moderate. Drinkability is very good, it had some great hoppy flavors to it and went down very smoothly. Excellent beer overall, and one of my personal favorites.",Bear Republic Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,93
610,2751,GarrettMD,4.02,"A - Pours a clear dark yellow with minimal head that stays as a thin layer of bubbles.  S - Very nice citrus and pine hop aroma. Caramel malts are there as well, smells like a very well balanced IPA.  T - And it is! Hop bitterness and sweet malts balance each other out perfectly. Citrus tastes from the hops meld well with the caramel flavors of the malts. Pine is a more dominant hop flavor in the taste. Very tame for a west coast IPA, but delicious all the same. It isn't a hop bomb, so don't expect it to be, it is just overall well balanced.  M - Medium to light bodied, finish is slightly bitter with a lot of sweet malts.  D - Very good IPA, doesn't kill your palate, you could go through a few of these easy in one sitting.",Bear Republic Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,93
610,2751,tlazaroff,4.03,"Drank from a pint glass.  A: Pours a nice honey-golden color with a 3-finger light tan head consisting of large and small bubbles. Lacing on the glass is exceptional, some floating particulates in the beer, though that could have been from improper cleaning of my glass.  S: Not as aromatic that I expected. Big pine notes on the nose though, almost all pine. I get a tad of light citrus (oranges) before the pine, but the pine dominates.  T: Again, it's all pine. Its as if I took a fistful of pine needles and pinecones and squeezed the essence of them into my mouth. There is a slight caramel/toasty flavor to it, but again, it's practically all pine.  M: Feels thin, with moderate carbonation. It doesn't foam up in your mouth.  D: I had a 22oz and it was plenty for one sitting, I think 1 22oz or 2 12oz would be my limit, the alcohol really comes through you can feel it before you're half way done.",Bear Republic Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,93

It's not too bitter though, and finishes really nicely. Although for being a West Coast IPA it's definitely on the more mellow side of things, and does a nice job balancing the hoppy bitterness.  m-medium body, good carbonation, good balance followed with a nice dry, bitter finish.  d-a solid beer which goes down pretty easy, but not enough complexity of flavor and hops to keep me coming back for more than a bomber.  overall-being one of the easier to find IPAs around here, I wouldn't hesitate to pick this one up again.",Bear Republic Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,93

The hop varieties used give forth predominately citric, floral and pine notes with a very light malt backing. The flavor is also of citric and floral hops, though there are some slight herbal hop notes as well. The malts I can detect seem to be lending mostly caramel notes with some biscuit notes as well. The hops and malts are very closely balanced, though the hops do come through in the finish to give a bitter, slightly dry finish. The mouthfeel is decent medium body with good carbonation. This is a very drinkable and pleasant beer, though I do wish there was a slight stronger emphasize on the hops, as I could easily mistake this for an American Pale Ale.",Bear Republic Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,93

Great, mellow hops with a good malt backbone. Hardly any sweetness, but the hops don't overwhelm. Floral and slightly evergreen. Not huge depth.

610,2751,Jayna,4.55,"Everyone loves the Racer 5. It's no secret.  I was fortunate enough to get this on cask at Local 44 in West Philly and I kind of wanted to either get naked or punch everyone else in the bar, or maybe just sit quietly and enjoy my beer, after I tasted it.  It's got a lot going on; obviously it's going to be hoppy, but the hops' malty buddies are just sitting right along side the hops giving you a big grin and all their thumbs up. Orange & caramel seem to star here, book ended by a drier hoppier taste typical of most IPAs as well as some lighter citrus and if you smell, if you really sniff just hard enough, some floral notes. Seriously, this beer has everything.  All I can tell you to do is get a beautiful cask pour. Just get it! GO. BYE.",Bear Republic Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,93
610,2751,AlvinStraight,4.65,"Killed the cask at Bierkraft for this one and it was well worth it. This is one of my favorite IPAs and I've never had the chance to find it on cask before. I'm not sure how to define the hoppiness/fruitiness of this one; it's not just big hops, but rather has a unique flavor that I haven't found anywhere else. Simply put it's excellent. The taste is delightful, but the color and smell are particular appealing to me.  If you like IPA's and hoppy beers, this one is worth finding.",Bear Republic Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,93
610,2751,Soonami,4.57,"I decided to review Racer 5 again because it was served in a different format than before, on cask, which contributed to a unique experience of the beer.  Bear Republic makes some great beers and racer 5 is definitely one of them. The IPA was served at cellar temperature from a hand-pumped beer engine. This service resulted in ale with warmer temperature and lower amount of carbonation, which really allowed the taste of the resinous hops and biscuity malt to come through. Moreover, lower carbonation improve the mouthfeel, making it silkier and easier to drink without feeling as full. The warmer temperature did also make the beer seem to taste sweeter, but the lingering bitterness kept it from being cloying.  Racer 5 on cask was delicious with abundant pineapple, peach and mango flavors, with assertive bitterness and a sweet cracker-like malt background.",Bear Republic Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,93

S- pine and citrus hops. Very typical of a west coast IPA.  T- Very good. Bitter, but not to bitter. Not hop forward, but a lot of hop aftertaste.  D- This IPA is very good and very drinkable. Great amount of carbonation. I can see drinking this beer on a hot summer day, or on a cool fall day. Very good example of a west coast IPA. I will seek this on out again!

610,2751,jampics2,4.25,"On tap @ Melt. Needed something nice and hoppy for my Spicy Italian sandwich! This went perfectly with the gourmet grilled cheese.  This pint has a dark golden color with a thick white head. Looks really nice, could be a touch lighter to meet my ideal, but still a beer that's well above average.  Smell is citrus hops, pine, and a pale malt sweetness anchoring the whole thing. Citrus hints include orange, grapefruit, and pineapple.  Taste was fantastic. The citrus is ripe and juicy, the pine gives it depth, and the malt is light and sweet. The Columbus and Cascade here are rocking the park, each lending their juice to the mix. Bitterness is there, but it's well balanced and any ruin is well rewarded with taste.  Mouthfeel is light to medium light. Carb is perfect and finish is clean with lingering hops. Excellent body and feel. Drinkability is really nice too, this was a great beer to enjoy with lunch.

Mouthfeel: Medium body with balanced carbonation and a dry finish.  Drinkability: A very good IPA.

610,2751,MysticRuler,3.87,"A surprisingly nice IPA. I wasn't expecting much given the high volume production, however, the West Coast Hops shine, as usual. Nice balance of sweet maltiness (but not too sweet which is a problem with alot of IPAs) twinned with hoppy bitterness; its a very drinkable IPA. Superior to a number of higher rated IPAs out there.",Bear Republic Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,93
610,2751,beerhan,4.12,For being what appears to be a very mass produced IPA this gem is delicious. I cannot really say that this is very unique but I love it regardless.

Grapefruit and pine bring the hops while a light Carmel comes out in the malts.   M - medium body, again, excellent balance, light hop and sweet at the beginning, finish is slightly bitter. Warming finish Diego the ABV.  D - this isn't going to be a hophead's delight, still, this is an interesting West Coast take on an IPA. great balance, attractive combination of hops and malts and at $5 for a 22oz bomber, it's not going to break the bank.

It's got a strong scent of the West Coast hops. Citrus and pine. There is also a scent of sweet malts. Excellent.  Oh man... this is just about perfect. There's a lot of hops in this, but the sweet malts in this make it quite delicious. Even without the sweet malts this would be outstanding.  The mouthfeel is normal for the style. Medium bodied, moderate carbonation with a nice coating on the tounge. Well done.  This is a great West Coast IPA. Might be the only IPA I like more than Union Jack, which is why I had a few pints.

I found the smell to be a little lack-luster. Not very potent or inviting. What I could get were hop oils and grapefruit rind.  The taste is very crisp and clean. This is a very balanced beer that really showcases the hops. Little to no malt profile though.  The mouthfeel is light and crisp. The beer is well carbonated and delicate enough to allow the hop profile to dominate while leaving no after taste or unwelcome lingering bitterness.  This wound up not being my favorite IPA but the drinkability is pretty good. The beer is light and easy going for 7%. While I might limit myself to 1 or 2 of these in a sitting, I could easily see others drinking much more than that.  Overall I am just not a huge fan of this west coast style of IPA that has very little malt profile.

First notes are of the citrus, followed by the sweetness of the malts and bitterness of the piney hops. Finishes slightly bitter and very clean.  The mouthfeel is better than most IPA's.

T: Piney, a little sweet and very smooth. I don't know quite what it is about the hop flavor on this one, the pine and citrus is there but there's something else too... earthy perhaps. Some caramel malt is in there giving it a bit of honey sweetness, but it's pretty well masked by the hops.  M: Creamy, medium body, restrained carbonation.  D: Very drinkable beer, very enjoyable. I didn't dig earthiness on the palate but it didn't get into the way too much, there's plenty of other hop flavor there to satisfy.",Bear Republic Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,93

Thick drapes of lace line the glass. A head that thins out, but holds a foamy characteristic thought.  S: A bold, blast of hops. Notes of orange and alcohol come through. An aroma that does not have the diversity of many fruits, I am just finding orange. An aroma which does not jump out of the glass, but does balance nicely with the beer as a whole.  T/M: A great hop/malt balance, the front of this beer is a great hop explosion, the finish is a smooth malt kick. On the finish the malt is not over powered by the hop presence, which kicks back in on the lingering taste. I think this maybe the perfect hop profile in an IPA. I think just shy of perfect due to its lack of bitterness. This is a sweet hop profile, unlike many other IPAs.  D: A very good overall beer, blending all aromas, tastes and sweet hop, lingering sensations, this is an all around beer.

The flavor is of malt and a slightly sour hop. It had a medium feel on the palate with high carbonation. Overall this was very nice and easy drinking. The hop profile and intensity was very nice and the malt counterbalanced it almost perfectly. If this brew had some more complexity to it, it could be a world-class brew, but it is still VERY nice to say the least.

A strong citrus/hoppy smell hits first followed by light malt that balances the smell very well. In my opinion Racer 5's smell is slightly better than many of it's American IPA counterparts  T - This is one of the best tasting single IPA's I've ever had. It's perfectly balanced without being overly bitter and doesn't destroy my pallet. The smell and taste compliment each other making them almost dependent on each other.  M - Coats the mouth very well. No problems at all with the feel of the beer. The 7% alcohol is present but very well covered by the balance of malts so your pallet and mouth can handle more than a couple.  D - This can easily be a session brew. It's an easy to drink 7% beer that is a bit deceiving. I will keep coming back to this as a ""go to"" AIPA  Overall - Set's itself apart from many IPAs that I've had.

The aroma is lovely, and the fact that I could smell it right after popping the cap is always a good sign. It is quite perfume like with plenty of citrus, both lemon and ruby red grapefruit, a hint of pine and some nice flowery aromas. I also detect a hint of earthiness and pale malt sweetness. The flavor is bursting with hops. Lemon, grapefruit, pine and floral flavors mix with the sweet slightly caramel malt character and a bit of earthiness. This beer is quite bitter, but seems to have just enough sweetness to keep it from getting out of control. Not as balanced as a east coast or Midwest IPA mind you, but I am not one to be overly concerned about that, especially with a hop flavor and aroma as great as that possessed by racer 5. The body is medium with a good amount of carbonation, yet a fairly smooth texture. The finish is very dry with a lingering hoppy flavor on my tongue.

As far as the taste the piney hop were a little bit more punchier but still maintained a decent balance between the sweet malts. The citrus grapefruit also helped out some to enhance the bitter flavors on the palate and I could also detect a caramel undertone.

Though after having yesterday at Lord Hobo on tap and today in a bottle, I have to say, it doesn't compete with the aforementioned others anymore. Great Divide, Stone and Avery are very close to each other, and from now on, I will buy whichever is the cheapest out of the 3. Racer 5 lacks the complexity and mouthfeel it used to have.

610,2751,Naugros,4.09,"An orange glow fills the glass, hazy and bubbly. An off-white head quickly recedes to a ring with sticky lace and floaters.  The hops dominate the nose, four of the big Cs of the Pacific Northwest bringing grapefruit and orange and pine. The big hop aroma does not overpower the sweet malt which comes through as whole wheat bread on the nose. I'm hoping the taste is as well-balanced as the smell.  The malt sweetness comes out again, but is entirely subdued by the hops in the wash. The blend of hops continues to bring the grapefruit and the pine and also delivers a hint of pepper and clove on the palate. The aftertaste does away with the pine and leaves behind pink grapefruit with just a bit of pith and spice.  A nicely balanced IPA that smacks you in the face with hops, but they're wrapped in a velvety malt sweetness that deadens the blow and doesn't leave much bruising. That's just a fancy way of saying that the hops bitterness is balanced by the malts and that the aftertaste lingers, but not in a bad way.  I've noticed that the more recent reviews have been below the average. Perhaps Bear Republic's quality control has decreased. This is the reverse trend of Weyerbacher's beers. Their controls have improved and their recent reviews tend to exceed the average. I wish I had had this one when it was getting more As. I heard so much about it and was a bit disappointed.",Bear Republic Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,93
610,2751,Khazadum,3.72,"Picked up a bomber on my latest incursion into a Chicago Binny's. Was looking for a new IPA to try and heard good things about Bear Republic. Why not try it? Poured many times into my brandy snifter.  Vision The pour leaves a beautiful amount of head that does not leave much lacing as it dissipates. The body is a stereotypical amber color, and when held to the light it matchs commerical apple juice. Not bad, but not the best.  Bouquet The nose on this is quite enjoyable. It foreshadows a delicious brew. The spicy bitterness of the hops comes through in the very first breath. A slight citrus note is balancing the bitterness. Perhaps, grapefruit in nature.  Flavor Profile The bouquet was not lying for this beverage. The liquid sloshes around and releases the fruity flavors upon my tongue. They quickly change over into the bitterness of the hops which seems to linger into the finish. The end isn't anything to be ashamed of. It hits the bitter portions of my tongue and seems to hug the sides of it while leaving the rest clean. For a 7% beer, this definitely doesn't show up at all. Not even in the last pours of the bottle do I find a hint of alcohol. This is not to say that it needs it, but it was unusual to not find it.  Oral Sensations AS IPAs go, I don't expect them to be syrup and I don't expect them to be bottled water. However, this one tends to lead more towards a watery texture than what I've become accustomed to. I think this actually benefits the beer rather than hinders it. As its texture isn't any thicker, it leaves a possibly cleaner finish. I put it somewhere just below some German Pilsner's I've had.  Closing For the price that I paid for this brew, there is no doubt in my mind. Buy it! Now! It is delicious, affordable, and comes in a great size. I will definitely be purchasing this beer again, if not for its solid offering to the IPA style than for its price tag.",Bear Republic Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,93
610,2751,emerge077,4.18,"Had this on draft countless times at the Maproom, it's a classic IPA in my mind.  12 oz. bottle poured into a tapered Hamms goblet.  Glowing sunset orange, darker in the center, fading to gold around the edges. Slightly hazed with micro sediment, otherwise it has some good clarity. Frothy, sticky head on it, sheets of lacing around the edges. Retains a good skim for the duration of the glass.  Light hoppy aroma, fruity cantaloupe, mellow sweet pale malts.  Fruity notes lead off, melon or cantaloupe again, some resinous bitter hops in the middle giving it a dry grassiness in the finish. The fruit lingers behind it, which is a nice combination. Medium bodied, almost slippery, not too heavy or sweet. Easy to have another if so inclined. Today I just have a single for the purpose of this review. Will drink again many times hopefully...",Bear Republic Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,93

Decent lacing ring with carbonation present  S - Hoppy aroma with a hint of apricots and orange peel, slight malt  T/M - Real tasty brew, taste apricots and orange peel and hops, not a lot of malt, a little gritty due to the hops but smooth's real easy  D - Very easy drinker. I will get this again and recommend it",Bear Republic Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,93
610,2751,aquaphiliac,3.45,"Picked up a sixer for $9.99.  A: Nice dark gold color with a decent head. Very Pretty  S: Smells of hops mostly; some sweetness in the scent.  T: Kinda the opposite of the smell... dominating malt sweetness and a little bit of hops. Still pretty bitter on the finish, I guess I was expecting something totally different. Not bad though.  M: Perfect body IMO; on the full side.  D: Didn't really want more than 2 of these in a row, definitely not the most drinkable IPA I've tried.  Overall decent value but will probably not buy again just because I'd appreciate a little less malt.",Bear Republic Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,93
610,2751,Duttonic,4.5,"Served from a 12oz bottle, poured into a dogfish head pint.  A- Hazy orange, 1 1/4 fingers of head (off-white), excellent lacing.  S- Floral, hops, grapefruit, maybe a hint of lemon.  T/M- Exceptional flavor, mouth-puckering hops, extremely enjoyable. Creamy, grapefruit, leaves that patented sticky & bitter aftertaste of a quality IPA.  D- Not for the faint of heart. If you don't care for IPA's, this will be way out of your league. Great benchmark of the style. These can definitely be enjoyed one after the other in a sitting.  I know that since it is 7% abv it probably shouldn't be a session, but this is one of my favorite IPA's to drink in numbers if I'm at a pub or bar. Highly recommended for hop-heads.",Bear Republic Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,93
610,2751,gameface23,4.02,"A: Hazy orange body with a minimal head that does leave a surprising amount of lacing.  S: A blast of citrus hops (mostly orange and grapefruit) along with a supporting role from a honeyed caramel sweetness and slight earthy mint notes.  T: Surprisingly soft citrus fruit bitterness up front. This is certainly a bitter beer, but it seems like it's restrained just at the verge of crossing over the threshold of a throat thrasher.  M: Medium bodied, but the carbonation is lacking.  D: That English BA user that always yells at people for referring to beers over 4% ABV as session ales is going to be pissed in 3...2...1: This is the closest I've ever found to a sessionable beer at 7% ABV. It is easy drinking and very flavorful.",Bear Republic Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,93
610,2751,Lakes,4.65,"My oh my I love Racer 5.  I have this frequently both from a 22oz bottle at Enoteca and on tap at Capone's.  Both from bottle and on tap it's appearance is exceptional. It's color is a bright vibrant golden orange that seems not content to sit in the glass. It's full frothy head beckons to be sipped.  Racer 5's aroma is room filling. It's a buoyant citrus full of grapefruit, tangerine with mild pine notes at the back.  The taste follows the aroma perfectly, filling the mouth with strong rich American hops. A bold grapefruit/citrus blast with bright spots of pine, orange peel and tangerine. The malt backs up the hops but doesn't take away anything. It's like a framework for the hops to rest on. Just wonderful  Mouthfeel is full and satisfying and it's drinkability has been tested and proven outstanding many MANY times.",Bear Republic Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,93
610,2751,appenzeller,3.25,"Pours a hazy drk gold with a modest head. Aroma is HOPS and citrus, standard West Coast IPA/DIPA. Taste is the same, this beer is all hops, just a hint of light bready malt underneath. Nothing complex here, if you like hop bombs, this is yet one more beer that'll do the job for you. Occasionally I enjoy that and on those occasions, I'd buy another.",Bear Republic Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,93
610,2751,Nerudamann,3.63,"Look - Very orange in color, looks kind of like a Blue Moon. Good carbonation. 1 finger's worth of foam.  Smell - Very citrusy, but I couldn't make out any other distinct aromas.  Taste - Typical IPA taste, very hopy, but with a good balance, probably from the citrus taste. It really hits the top front of the palate.  Mouthfeel - Pretty light, not too creamy.  Drinkability - Pretty good beer in general, maybe a little too IPA for me though. But a worthy beer nonetheless.",Bear Republic Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,93
610,2751,AWolfAtTheDoor,4.87,"This is currently my go-to for a session beer. MAINLY because I am in the mood for IPAs and this is the best one I can get in a case at my local liquor store. For the record I just opened my.. 5th 12 pack case of it tonight. Thought it proper to give it  Vigorous pour yields a less than impressive head, and nothing is worse than bad head.. but is there really such think? Where were we? Oh yes, a beer review. On the up side, lacing is usually good with this beer. I'm on my 5th case of the stuff, trust me : )  Smells good. Not overpowering. Pine and citrus are the dominant scents coming through.  OK. Taste. Wow. It's got everything you could want in a session IPA. Hops are there, and tangy, but beautifully balanced by the malt backbone. It's really as simple as that. And this is why I am on my 5th case of the stuff.  Mouthfeel is nice. Medium body. The malts hold the hops in check and it never develops into a sour twang that some IPAs can evolve to.  Stupidly drinkable. This is my 5th case of the stuff. Until Russian River starts selling Pliny by the case, this WILL be my go-to session beer until the weather starts to cool off and I start looking for browns, porters, and stouts.",Bear Republic Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,93
610,2751,woodychandler,4.37,"My notes from last summer rear their ugly head. This will be my third different serving style of this beer! I do not think that even any of LNCBC's beers hold that distinction.  My server, to be named later, brought this to me with a finger of bone-white head with good retention, Color was a deep-gold with NE-quality clarity. Nose was redolent with pine-y hops. Mouthfeel was medium with a palate-cleansing hoppiness. Don't hold back! Finish was gaspingly bone-dry. More, please, Raquel!",Bear Republic Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,93
610,2751,zebco,4.33,"Pours a very clear, golden orange color. A sticky, ivory colored head tops this brew. All the carbonation bubbles look like they're having a party. A great and inviting appearance. Aromas of strong, delicious hops. Pine. Hop oils. Citrus. The taste is sweet with intense hops. Intense in an awesome way. The head was thick and creamy and laced amazingly through the 22oz. Great balanced between the hops and sweet malt. A good bitterness lingers. I very muched enjoyed this brew. Will look to pick up another.",Bear Republic Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,93
610,2751,TheSarge,3.97,"Pours decently to produce a finger and a half thick off white head. The body is copperish gold in color, and has slight chill haze.  In the aroma freshly cut grass and pine dominate with a slight lemon presence.  The taste is of spruce with lemon and other citrusy notes.  The feel of this brew is kind of dry and coarse upfront, but the citrusy finish leaves the palate wet.",Bear Republic Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,93

S - Juicy citrus hops, some caramel, and a bit of pine. Smells very inviting and intense.  T - Loads of grapefruit-like hoppiness; definitely packs a solid hob bite! Quite sweet. Hints of pine, butterscotch, and tropical fruits. The after-taste has got some breadiness to it, as well as some lingering bitterness. Tastes very good and balanced!  M - Quite thick; medium-to-full body to it. Mildly carbonated, with slight hints of alcohol. Very smooth.

Bright citric hoppiness and sweet maltiness to the nose.  Sweet, citric, spicy, hoppy, piny. Notes of orange & grapefruit meld with a distinct herbal character (basil/cannabis leaf). Great flavor.  Nice body; full, quenching, bitter.  Very good IPA; not quite up there for me as the best West Coast IPA (or best offering from BR) but still a solid go-to option for a citric hop blast.",Bear Republic Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,93
610,2751,pmlondrigan,3.98,"Poured into a lovely tulip glass. Nice orange gold color to this beer. Pure white head, not the tightest of bubbles but nice. Lacing sticks to the glass a good bit. Pretty beer in the glass. Very citrus aroma forward ipa, great west coast hop aroma right on the nose. Very balanced malt to hop profile. Citrusy, flowery and bitter with a lingering bitter bit on the tongue. Crisp clean ipa taste. For a 7% by volume the alcohol is well masked and tastes like a lower abv ipa. Smooth beer in the mouth and over the tongue with the hop bitterness that makes your tongue take notice. Maybe could be a little more bubbly for me. Like most ipas this one is easy to drink and delightful.",Bear Republic Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,93
610,2751,DaveonBA,4.15,"Bottle poured into tulip.  Appearance: Orange to gold with moderate head retention but weak lacing.  Smell: Smells great. Juicy hops and citrus. My first impression reminded me a lot of Hopslam, which was unexpected.  Taste: Slight sweetness up front. Followed by an attack of bitter, citrusy hops. Long bitter finish. Excellent.  Mouthfeel: Medium body, but I could have used a bit more carbonation. That's really my only gripe with this beer.  Drinkability: Overall this was a very enjoyable beer. The delicious lingering hoppy finish keeps me coming back for another sip, then another bottle. 7% is right in the middle of my ideal range of abv for a 6 pack IPA to drink during the week.  I will be buying this again as a steady drinker. Hopefully my next bottle has a little more carbonation.",Bear Republic Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,93

610,2751,udubdawg,4.27,"pours a hazed peachy gold color, topped with the expected impressive creamy head. retention wasn't great, but while it lasted the lacing was quite good. Citrus greets my nose, mixed with a sort of pungent cattiness. faint alcohol note, bare hint of lightly toasted is the only bit of malt bill I get. I dig it! It's bitter but not over the top compared to it's IBU level. Ample hop flavor, no diacetyl. There is a little pine to the citrus, and a mild caramel flavor - doesn't finish dry and I guess that's what's hiding some of the hops. Creamy soft body, barely sticky, carbonation perhaps just a touch low. There is little to slow me down here. A winner!",Bear Republic Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,93
610,2751,BeanBone,3.75,"Appearance: A nicely hazy golden-orange body capped by a little over a finger of whitish head that endures well and leaves great lacing.  Aroma: Lots of bright, juicy, citrusy, and mildly piney hops over a sweet caramel body.  Flavor: Up front, juicy, citrusy, slightly resinous, and mildly bitter hops take the lead. Underneath, a biscuity caramel malt backbone keeps everything grounded. It's a rather balanced proposition, though the hops are the primary focus here. The moderately-high alcohol content is masked well, leaving no trace. Biscuity malt and piney hops in the finish.  Mouthfeel: Medium bodied with moderate carbonation and a dry finish.  Drinkability: For hop fans, this is as an easy drinker as any IPA with a seven percent kick.  Verdict: Racer 5 is a solid, balanced, and drinkable American IPA and another satisfying brew from Bear Republic. A little more focus on the Cascades, and this could really be up there for me.",Bear Republic Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,93
610,2751,alpineclimber,4.38,"I brought this beer back from Oregon recently. Fairly excited to review an IPA that seems to be well liked among BA's. The bottle has been sitting around for a few weeks so it's not super fresh but I am sure it's fine.  The beer poured a golden amber color with a small frothy white head that recedes to some lacing. I did not hold back on the pour and emptied all the yeast into the glass as well.  The smell is of fresh citrus and pine hops.  Taste is great! A nice big fruity blast followed by the citrus and pine hops. Would be interesting to know about the hops used and their flavor profiles. The bitterness is in the finish, the way it should be. The mouthfeel is slick and the carbonation is perfect.  This is a great beer. More pleasant to drink then some IPA's I have had, to me this is very well balanced brew, not to hop heavy.

Poured with a finger of billowy white head with excellent lacing. A great lookiing IPA.  S: The nose lacks a little. Little bit of a piney citrus note. The malt is there as well but a bit subdued. I remember having this years ago and thinking it was super fragrant.  T: Very well balanced. Not that much bitterness. Not that much else besides just a touch of a piney hop note. Finishes super clean.  M: Nice light mouthfeel. Lacks that slightly syrupy quality I look for in a IPA. A touch creamy. Great carbonation for a growler.  D: This is a classic.

Aromas were primarily pine and resin, some floral aromas in the background. This is a beer with great backbone and mouthfeel, medium to full bodied without the sweetness that some American IPA's bring. Overall a prototypical West Coast IPA with bitterness and hops that are pronounced but not excessive; this is one of the beers that drew me to liking this style. Since it is not overly sweet or heavy, it would be pretty easy to put away a few of these in short order, and the 7% ABV should be noted.",Bear Republic Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,93

Light pale malt definitely takes a backseat to this well hopped IPA. Light mouthfeel and easy to drink considering its ABV.

The carbonation is intense and there is some sediment that is evident. This has west coast ipa all over it  S- grapefruit! Pineapple! Citrus! A tropical fiesta captured in a brew. The piney hops cross with the fruit. This brew screams the themes of caly hops  T- the same scent is involved in the taste. Grapefruit dominates, while the pine and earth hops dominate next. The experence is side stepped with bitter, bitter flavors. Some sweetness coats the tongue during the tasting. The last piece of the brew is some grassy spiced remnants  M- full bodied and carbonated  D- racer 5 is an off the chart west coast ipa that can be dunked anytime.

610,2751,UnDeadly,4.3,"Appearance - Beautiful, gold/orange hue. Zero haze. Thick, creamy/foamy head that faded to a small but consistent film, which leaves sticky lacing on the side of the glass.  Smell - Yup, this is pretty much how an IPA should smell. Biting hop aroma, with light notes of apple cider vinegar and bready malt.  Taste - Hooray hops! Citric hop taste flows over the entire palate. Quite bitter. Slightly burnt malt on the finish with a note of sweet, but the malt profile on this IPA is minimal. A true Californian IPA.  Mouth Feel - Medium on the body, with a good, strong carbonation that fits the style well. Not overwhelming with the bubbles, just about on par with your average, lighter ale.  Drinkability - This is an everyday IPA...and I mean that in the best way possible. Very strong hop presence is well done, and putting away a bomber is no problem. Thank you sir, may I have another?  An all-around great IPA, especially if you are a hop-head. Definitely NOT true to the UK style, but just how I like it. Also, this beer is widely available, at least here in San Diego.

Drinkability - An all around kickass IPA. Right up there with Smuttynose IPA and 90 min on my list. Great grapefruit dominant hop balance with a big body. A big, burly, lip smacking IPA.

Flavor is rather complex. Strangely the malt sweetness-mostly caramel and biscuit notes-leads with the hops coming in toward the finish to balance it out. It tastes like the brewer took care to let the malt come through. Mouthfeel is creamy and CO2 is just right. Overall, a complex, well made IPA with depth of character that sets it apart from the pack of American style IPAs.  This sampling was not as intense as some reviewers reported.

Taste is similar to the aroma in that piney hops with accompanying bitterness controls the flavor, not much balance, bitterness stays for quite awhile and doesn't let up, the lack of balance makes it a bit lower on the drinkability, carbonation is good as it should be.

Taste is smooth up front, with a bitter hoppy finish. It's no secret that this is one of the more popular IPAs these days, and no surprise how it became that way. Great example of the style and loads up on the hops without being too bitter to enjoy.  That being said, it has almost become the Sierra Nevada of 7 years ago for me. I rarely buy it in a store or at a place with a wide selection, but at a bar with 6-10 taps, Racer 5 being the most exotic, I'll often go with it by default.",Bear Republic Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,93

S: Light citrus undertone to a huge hop aroma.  M/T: Mouthfeel is at first tame and a ""calm before the storm,"" so to speak, because of the loud bitterness that soon overwhelms the taste buds and leaves the palate in shambles from a remarkable hop invasion...  D: Rejoice hop heads! This is a crisp and refreshing Hop Hop Hoppy blast to the palate that doesn't get old...",Bear Republic Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,93
610,2751,zoso493,4.27,"Poured from a 22 oz. bomber into a Stone straight-sided pint glass.  Appearance: Pours a deep golden-amber color that is sufficiently hazy in spite of the the lighter hue of the beer. The beers is crowned by a thick and foamy two-finger head that subsides quickly and leaves a decent amount of lacing on its way down.  Smell: The smell consists of a nice but somewhat subdued assortment of hops that go from citric to floral to juicy. While the hops do dominate the nose, there is an equally impressive scent of glutenous, caramelized malt balancing the hops that give the impression as if the hops are coated in sugar.  Taste: The juicy and citric hops reign supreme in the taste and provide a much-appreciated amount of bitterness. They are just a tad too underwhelming for me, though. But, by no means are they not delicious. The malts are less discernible but do again provide a nice sugary undercurrent to attempt to check the hops.  Mouthfeel: The mouthfeel is only slightly on the thicker side of things, which is just about where it should be for an IPA. The carbonation seems to be about spot-on as well. I can't say this is a crisp IPA, but it's flavors are sticky in a good way.  Drinkability: The alcohol is extremely well-masked in this beer, which is a good start for drinkability. At 7% ABV, it's not too hefty to have a few of, and I can say that this bomber is disappearing pretty rapidly.  Overall, Racer 5 is a very nice example of the style and is yet another good product from Bear Republic. Unfortunately, the dating code is, to me, completely unintelligible, so I can't say whether or not this is a fresh bottle. I'm inclined to think it isn't because the hops seem a bit faded, but regardless this is a very nice IPA and one that I will drink again.",Bear Republic Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,93
610,2751,wesclaypool,4.8,"On tap at Pete's Brass Rail in Danville.  a - Good color, slightly cloudy (the way I like it) yellow/gold.  s - Very mellow pine and citrus. And of course the indication of hops to come.  t - As someone who isn't crazy about the really strong IPAs, I love this one. The hops are there, but they're not strong to the point that they feel like they're ripping your mouth apart. Very balanced and, like the smell, mellow.  m - Like the taste, for an IPA, this was a little surprising. Fairly thin feel compared to some others I've had.  d - Could break the bank putting these away.",Bear Republic Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,93

Looks a lot like apple juice...I like apple juice. Good opening.  S- oh wow, this is fantastic. Very fruity and citric. Smells like something you could drink at breakfast. I'm getting some citrus and grapefruit...regardless, smells really awesome.  T- not overly bitter, nor overly sweet. Has the right amount of pine bite near the back, not enough to kick you in the face, but it lets you know its there. The bitterness from the hops are lovely. Really good.  M- really light. Unlike some IPAs, which can be overbearing, this isn't heavy at all. There is carbonation there which gives you that fizziness you look for sometimes. Can't complain about the mouthfeel at all.  D- Really drinkable, if only it wasn't for that high alcohol content. You don't taste the alcohol one bit. Its like drinking some alcoholic juice thats more bitter than sweet. In other words, totally awesome...I should actually try pairing one of these with an omelette or something",Bear Republic Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,93
610,2751,irishking1977,4,"A: Pours a clear, dull gold with a less than one finger head, that disperses quickly, leaving some moderate lace. Not bad.  S: The usual combination for an IPA, which includes pine, grapefruit and a hint of a malt background. Not as potent as would be expected for an IPA; I don't expect the bitterness or hoppiness of this one to be bracing or difficult to handle.  T: As I surmised; a well balanced IPA, with traces of citrus and pine, a mild herbal/medicinal aftertaste along with a hops bitterness that lingers on the palate for a spell. Bold, yet balanced and easily drinkable.  M: Good carbonation, which is expected out of most good IPAs. Less than expected creaminess and less than moderate oily mouthfeel on the palate. Perhaps slightly watered down in comparison to some of the top of the line IPAs and DIPAs. The good news is that the balance of malt and hops is close to nirvana.  D: Drinkability is better than most IPA's in that the palate paralyzing hops are not in abundance in comparison to most IPA's, probably somewhat of a disappointment to many of the hopheads out there. I like my hoppy brews, but those brews that are in excess of 100 IBU's (Stone's Ruination, pretty much any heady DIPA) are beers to drink maybe one or two of, and the palate is decimated.

Incredible citrus aroma, not an in your face grapefruit smoothie, just a wonderful citrus, hoppy smell.  I am an IPA novice, not having yet had the opportunity to try some of the better examples, but can't imagine any being better than this.

The nose makes up for it though nothing but unabashed citrus hop goodness. The taste follows the nose pretty much exactly, No real malt presence to speak of. Racer 5 is a little bit undercarbonated, which I should have anticipated given the lack of head. Despite that, it's eminently drinkable, and the ABV is hidden well.

Lite Co2 can be seen, left some splotchy lacing.  S - A bit floral with a dry pine & mild sap like aroma. Some fresh & fruity mango & pineapple are about as pronounced as the dry/floral/pine like notes. A bit of rind like notes, some underlying biscuit/cracker like malts are there but are so soft there hardly noticeable until it warms.  T - Fresh orange & mango juice flavors upfront. Some semi bright citrus is noticeable as it rolls to the sides of the tongue, as well as some puckering rind flavor. Moderately sweet, finishes with mild toasted malt flavors, touch of sap, and burnt like hop bitterness that lingers on the back of the tongue. Bitterness isn't over the top but pretty high.  M - Smooth with with lite-moderate crispness. Around medium-full but allot closer to medium bodied.  D - I'd sit down and enjoy a couple pints I'd say.

610,2751,JosiahS,4.45,"Poured into a tulip pint glass. Color is in the orange-mango range with a bubbly 1/2 finger head that quickly went to a thin ring. The appearance is noticeably cloudy with a bit of small yeast floating around.  The aroma has a lot of fruity notes, pineapple, orange, mango and little grapefruit rind. The hops are definitely there though, pine, and small amount of tree sap notes come through. Letting it sit a bit brings out the malt character, i get a bit of underlying earthy and doughy notes.  The taste is dominated by hops, floral, slightly dry and with a distinctive lemon rind flavor. it is bitter throughout but not over the top, just the right amount of bitterness. The malt comes out toward the end and in the aftertaste, lingering dough-like malt on the tongue only appears after the rush of hops and bitterness have faded some. Medium-bodied and light to medium carbonation.  A great IPA! I like my IPAs to be generously hopped but have the malt to just slightly bring the balance back. This beer does that perfectly.",Bear Republic Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,93

Ends with a dry, crisp finish with just enough hop bite. Very well balanced.  M- Medium feel with very little carbonation.

I don't like going in with expectations, but I did in this case.  Overall, a good solid IPA, would I put it in the elite class, I think it is borderline. I think it is good, great pour, looks nice, good amount of head dissipated nicely, chunks of hop in the bottom of the bottle, all the makings of a great IPA.  Nice pine and citrus, hoppy, but it's a little lacking in the bitterness department, didn't have the bitter finish and that bite you are left with afterwards, I like that about an IPA.  But everything else was there, flavor, hops, a nice tang when its going down, but I want that bitter taste as well, that is my only complaint.  I'd probably get this again, but there are other IPAs I would get before this one so maybe not. If I could get it on tap somewhere I'd definitely order it.  Had to edit this in the end, as you get down to the bottom of the beer, where the gunk and the chunks are, you do get that bitterness, so it does get you, but it does not resonate through the whole beer, gets better as you go on.",Bear Republic Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,93

This is a perfect example of a West Coast-style IPA. In the smell and taste, it's citrus (orange and lemon peel and grapefruit) and pine. There's a malty backbone present but only to hold up the hops and keep them from being too bitter. This is flavorful to the extreme.  The mouthfeel and finish are dry and bitter. However, this is not a palate killer. It hits the mark.

Some peppery spice in there too.  T: Bitter first with a mouthful of wet hops flavored piney, citrus, herby and grassy. Roasted malt is noticeable but overtaken by all the hops in there. Finish is tilted toward the bitter side and spicy.  M: Medium body and crisp, tight bubbles and some alcohol warmth.  D: Almost like drinking liquid hop juice but yet not overwhelming.

The hops are not overpowering in this brew, my opinion is that it is wonderfully balanced for an IPA. No overkill in the hop department. Really no maltiness to be detected here. Has a slight oily, slick feel about it. This brew does feel light in the mouth for the slightly high alcohol content. Though I am not complaining here.

There's also an enjoyable graininess in the aftertaste, along with the predictable bitterness.  M: Very nice feel that's medium to full for the style.

610,2751,Gyle41386,3.73,"Poured from a bottle into a pint glass.  Bright light orange pour. One finger of bubbly white foam. Decent retention. Nice rings of lacing.  Citric hop aroma that is very perfume-y. Not a whole lot to the nose aside from that.  Hop flavor touches both citrus and pine, with the pine being more prominent in the finish. Malt flavor is somewhat bready and sweet.  Medium bodied. Fairly light carbonation, not very active on the tongue. Very, very drinkable. An approachable West Coast IPA.",Bear Republic Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,93
610,2751,jdrury245,4.84,"Pours a bright copper/orange color. It had creamy 2 finger off white head.  The aroma of pine orange, pineapple and lemon filled my nose with delight. Th aroma was smooth and fresh. A very fresh smell.  Nicely hopped with a sweet bitter citrus malt taste in the beginning and then the hops bite back. Some notes of pine.  Medium bodied. Highly carbonated. The bubbles tickle my mouth.  Great drinkability! This tasty gem can be enjoyed anytime.",Bear Republic Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,93
610,2751,Minkybut,2.75,I poured this hopped up beer into my tumbler at 45 degrees. The beer was hoppy smelling and poured a cloudy wheat looking color.

Bear Republic certainly knows how to make an American IPA - Racer 5 and Hop Rod Rye are both among the best, most notable ones available. This is easily my favorite go-to for this style. 5",Bear Republic Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,93

This is a full body beer with a slightly dry or bitter ending.",Bear Republic Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,93
610,2751,emmasdad,4.7,"Pours a nice dark golden color with a firm white head. Big citrusy aromas (grapefruit and maybe a bit of zesty lemon). Taking a drink, the big hoppy flavors assault the palate, but in a very good way. Mid palate I get citrus, followed by a lightly sweet maltiness leading to a lasting bitter finish. Eminently drinkable, this is a perfect example of the west coast ipa style. Highly recommended.",Bear Republic Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,93
610,2751,ThirstyBird,4.03,Thanks to chickencoop for the bottle!  Pours a clear golden yellow color. Nice fluffy of white head falls to a sticky ring. Very nice lacing. The smell is citrus hops and a nice malt base under it.  The taste is as the smell would indicate. Not over the top hoppy pretty nice and mellow. Nice malt sweetness then fills the mouth followed by a sharp bitter dry aftertaste that just lingers on the tongue.  The body is medium. It has nice carbonation making it quite smooth drinking. Overall a very solid IPA. I don't know why it has taken me so long to try this one but I'm glad that I did.,Bear Republic Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,93

A bunch of lacing left behind.  Smells of barley and honey malts. Some bread-y scents. Hops come through as bitter dank, resin and pine.  Taste follows smell. Honey malts and cereal/bread barley. Hops come through as dank, resin, pine, and a bit of lemon citrus. Nothing too crazy.  Mouthfeel is medium bodied. Well carbonated, small prickly bubbles. A really nice hop bite in there as well.

For a regular IPA, this is quite nice.  M: Smooth. Again not overpowering. Feel the hops but not a palate wrecker.  D: Overall, excellent. A great version of an American IPA. Very drinkable.

610,2751,MrHassellYaHurd,4.74,"Pours into a pint glass a beautiful hazy yellow-orange with a big off-white head.  Delicious notes of thick pine needles and lemon zest. Sweet malts balance against the assertive hop character very nicely. This is very easy on the nose.  I'm surprised by how bitter the Racer 5 ISN'T. Compared to the nose, the hops are more refined, less ""in your face"" than you would expect, but still pleasantly hoppy, and perfectly in line with the style. The sweet, fruity, thick bodied malt tastes roll along the tongue so smoothly, I almost want to compare it to a sweet milkshake (lol), but that wouldn't be quite appropriate. Very delicious, nonetheless. Easy drinking, medium-thick bodied, velvety smooth mouthfeel.",Bear Republic Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,93

Aroma is big time grapefruit. Some ripe peach sweetness as well. Hops are pungent and powerful in the nose.  Taste comes in layers, grapefruit, pine, peach (among other fruits), pale malt, and a slightly oily hop bitter finish.  Mouthfeel is light and drinkable, with carbonation being on the lighter side for the style. It doesn't stand out as perfect, but doesn't seem flawed either. It just works well.  Easy to drink with a solid hop forward flavor and enticing bitterness. Could easily kick back a few, even at 7% abv.",Bear Republic Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,93

610,2751,silentjay,4.57,"pours an orange-copper, a rigorous pour is needed to create a decent head, but it sticks around and laces well. tiny bit of sediment is visible from the bottle-conditioning.  smells of flowers and citrus with a lot of grapefruit.  Tastes like a west-coast IPA is supposed to. lots of citrus, bitter, with a slightly sweet yet very acidic citric aftertaste. a bit of pine can be detected in the finish.  Mouthfeel is great for an IPA. enough carbonation to bite your tongue, but bottle-conditioned and smooth going down.  Drinkability is great, as well. Citric, bitter, sweet, acidic, and smooth combine to make one great IPA. 7% alcohol is hidden well.  One of my favorites. probably the beer that I have had the most of over the past year, a very consistent brew that I'm sure to visit again and again.

Floural with maybe a tiny hint of grapefruit citrus, defiantly can smell some malt and bitterness.  Taste:  AWESOME tasting beer, theirs a hint of pine combined with taste of hops and a little bit of bitterness. The hops and bitterness are perfect, not to overpowering, perfectly balanced.  Mouthfeel:  A bit warming mouth feel that goes down easy. The aftertaste will finish a bit dry but will not leave you thirsty.  Drinkability:  A little bitter but very smooth, very easy to drink. 7 percent alcohol??? you can't taste it at all!! Goes down really easy, I bet I could chug this entire pint no problem...

610,2751,Philabeerphia,4.4,"tonight I had a moment. Maybe it's the fact that my wife and I served this beer at our wedding. Not sure... but this beer is so sensuous. Extremely fresh - on tap at Monk's - poured into a shaker pint.  Light golden hues, nicely hazed with a firm, ivory head sitting one half finger high. Emitting both light khaki and warmer amber highlights when held to the bar light. Straight. Not far off in the nose - bold with an easy blend of pine, grapefruit and an echo of sugary sweet grains. The epitome of IPA, if not totally memorable. This classic nose is taken much further in the mouth, and especially the mouthfeel. The drink starts off with a small kick of light bready malts, just enough to stand at attention, then blossoms smoothly into a pungent blend of flowers, fruit and mothers milk. An experience of wilderness brought to life by the brewer. mountain grasses, pineapple, mango and mealy apple are brightened by some high sugary notes and a lightly crisp carbonation. steady as she goes, full as the beer has spread, floral hops and supple yeast combine in the back of the mouth to provide a soothing sense of satisfaction. Velvety. Long. soft. finish, but not a lurking presence... fades with a slow dial. No bitter resins pooling, instead the fade is lightly sweet and milky. truly gorgeous. The brewer has tuned in to a recipe that should not be touched. Difficult to improve this experience. I can't capture the full satisfaction with words. Truly special.",Bear Republic Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,93

S: Typical West Coast blast of piny hops with a bit of clove-like spiciness.  T: Wow - much smoother than your usual hop-bomb. This one is crisp and clean like all well-made IPAs but instead of the usual grapefruit-driven bitterness, this beer is driven by a less sour acidic attack normally seen in the style. It is almost like the hoppiness hits the back of the mouth rather than the front of the palate and pleasantly lingers for a while.  M: Medium body, no oily slickness.  D: Sir, may I have another?

A: Classic (unfiltered) IPA appearance .. golden, hazy, with a lot of yeast floaters dancing. Not that much head retention, yet there is some nice lacing clinging on every sip.  S: Citrus-y, tangerine & orange skins, grapefruit. Not much pine or floral hop characteristics in there, if at all.  T: More citrus goodness .. hops leave a pleasant bitter grapefruit skin aftertaste. Not the most complex IPA I've had, but they really nailed the fruity/citrus thing down.  M/D: The most drinkable IPA I've had so far. Alcohol is near undetectable. Carbonation is spot on, with bitterness kept to a minimal level. Only after two, I actually felt a slight buzz going on.

Head is small with little retention.  S-Lots of citrusy goodness goin on here. Grapefruit, pineapple are very present. Malts take a back seat, but still pretty noticeable.  T-A bit of honey up front, and follows the nose mostly after that. Malt backbone is solid, but the citrus notes are the stars here. Floral hops are awesome here.  M-Almost too smooth. Carb is almost perfect. The aftertaste leaves a bit to be desired.  D-7% abv isn't too bad, and if I had a couple more, they would likely disappear by the end of the night as well.

Retention is said turtle shell descending like a scuba diver when the tide is going out. That's a good thing.  Pineapple, grapefruit and soft pine aroma. Taste is citrus and tropical fruit (lots of pineapple) hop with a full resiny mouthfeel. Though hop forward, the malt puts up a fight in it's own right being just the right amount of dryness and just the right amount of fullness. I'm getting watermelon with the swallow?  Though I will stand up for East coast IPAs in their own right (Berkshire Lost Sailor, Smuttynose, Mayflower, etc) I'm a sucker for a West coast citrus bomb.

610,2751,TCHopCraver,4.27,"A: At first glance, I'm a little disappointed by the look of this brew. In a standard pint glass, it looks a little thin, with a see-through golden orange color. A medium-hard pour leaves about a 1/2 finger head that fades quickly. The carbonation looks great, however, as does the thin, thready, lacing the sticks on the side of the glass.  S: Mostly sweet citrus notes come upfront; is is a nice orange and lemon scent. A little bit of oily, pine-y hops support the citrus smell. As with the appearance, the word thin comes to mind. It does not have a big aroma, but it does have a nice aroma.  T: The taste, however, is not thin and this makes this guy quite happy. There is a very delicious balance between the sweet citrus flavors and the pleasant, dry, pine hop tastes. The finish has that nice, lingering dryness that I really enjoy from a quality IPA.  M: A good, warming feel that spreads joy to all parts of the palate. Crisp and refreshing in the mouth.  D: Not a palate-ruining IPA at all and its crisp, clean citrus tastes lead me to believe that I could drink several of these puppies and be pretty joyful.",Bear Republic Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,93

Bottle poured into pint glass  pours a pale apricot color. Whitish head lasts half way through before becoming a swirl of faint bubbles. Chunks of lacing remain firmly in place.  Smells of grapefruit and citrus hops. Not smelling malts, but it is still rather pleasant. So far, much better than the other one I had.  Taste follows nose. There is a nice sweetness present from the malts. Also this one had a slight sour citrus- like a hint of lemony goodness. Actually very pleased.  This is right where it should be for an A IPA.

Extremely complex, with lots of citrus and tang and hops, and even some mustiness, all mixing together -- it's a great aroma, one of the best I've experienced in an IPA. And the taste delivers what is promised by the nose: a very rich, very complex and lasting flavor. The bitterness is not only balanced, but enhanced by the complexity of the flavors. There's lemon and candied orange and I get some mint and spices... it's a wonderfully rich taste that's hard to describe fully -- knocks me out with each swig.  The mouthfeel is just a bit thin for such a great, complex beer, but it's so delicious I could drink a sixer if I wasn't careful.

Lots of pine and citrus aromas, with a bit of an herbal/grassy note as well. Taste is very bitter, lots more hop flavors and very grassy flavors. Plenty of citrus as well, with less pine. A bit of malt comes through but is subtle compared to the hops flavors.

M: A bit light for what I was expecting, but still flavorful with a very long finish.  D: This is a damn fine example of an American IPA. Very balanced, yet on the hoppy side, it goes down easy.

610,2751,Seanibus,4.32,"What a luscious beer.  Pours clear orange with a fluffy but short-lived head (though I have seen it on draft where it is quite cloudy. I have yet to have anyone explain this to me, but it seems far too extreme for chill haze. But maybe).  The aroma is quite hoppy, fresh and crisp, with pine and grapefruit. The flavor is clean and hoppy, strong pine, strong grapefruit, maybe some simcoe there? The malt is just a backbone for the gorgeous West Coast hop bombing, but the overall effect is not out of balance for the type.  The mouthfeel is clingy, highlighting the deep hop bitterness that lingers. There may be a hint of alcohol heat in there too, but nothing unbalanced.  Dangerously drinkable.",Bear Republic Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,93
610,2751,climax,4.55,"Racer 5 poured an amber/yellow with a good rocky off-white head. It had good clarity for the most part, considering the bottle fermenting yeast floating around in there.  The nose had excellent hop complexity. Oily grapefruit and orange, pine, and some soapiness. The malt balances pretty well but doesn't take the emphasis from the hops. It wasn't overly strong though, but fresh and clean.  The flavor had that extra oomph to it, lacking from the smell. Very resiny and soapy, the hops had everything; floral, spicy, piny, and citrus. The complexity of the hop profile was excellent, covered every base I could think of. The malt backbone kept out of the spotlight but the presence was none to shabby to say the least. It was toasty and semi-sweet, with even some chocolate and coffee tones chiming in as it warmed up. The alcohol was well masked.  The feel was very lively. It had a good chewy thick feel to it, the bubbly carbonation kept it crisp and interesting. The dry finish lingered long and kept me wanting another sip to quench and ponder. It is definitely a no dillly-dallying IPA, awesome flavor.",Bear Republic Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,93

The white head dissipates quickly leaving behind larger bubbles along the outer rim of the beer, along with lots of lacing.  S- I get lots of hops with a subtle malty and possibly a spicy zest in the background.  T- Lots of hops upfront, but the initial flavor is tamed by the malts that finish it.

610,2751,scottyshades,4.42,"On the bottle: ""Keep cold, respect life, don't D+D, real ale is alive, yeast is good""  A: Pours a slightly off-looking transparent straw/copper color. The head is small and fluffy and retains only for a few seconds. Slightly cloudy as well.  S: Starts off with a fragrant sweet note; honey, residual sugars, and a slight whiff of brown sugar. The hops are definitely intense, but the malt background balances very nicely. Smells more like a DIPA than a classic rendition of an AIPA. Nice notes of citrus (lemon peel)  T: Very nice flavor profile. All of that sweetness seems to disappear into a hop heaven. Earthy, floral, fragrant, and bittering aspects of the hops come out. The malt backbone is a slight bit biscuity, and gives a firm balance, but hops are definitely dominant. Not as bitter as some of the other Bear Republic brews (Hop Rod in particular), but definitely intense in its own right. The alcohol (which I just noticed now) is actually very nicely hidden. You get the warmth as it goes down, but not noticeable as you drink.  MF/D: Medium/heavy in body for the style, lingering honey/piney hop finish. Very balanced and highly drinkable.  Really good with a spicy dish. I tried this with homemade Panang Curry and it was perfect!",Bear Republic Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,93
610,2751,TheJollyHop,4.03,"Medium amber, thick one inch of off white head. Great retention and beautiful cylindrical lacing.  Prominent floral nose, tropical fruits, subtle citrus fruits...very sweet hop aroma.  Light herbal hop taste, followed by hints of orange and grapefruits. This is a very hop centric brew, that grabs you from the get go and doesn't let go. Biscuit malt sweetness and grain help keep some semblance of balance. Somewhat dry finish with a bitterness that dawdles, albeit smoothly.  Light to medium carbonated with a thin body. Light on the tongue and good for the style.  No harshness or woodiness, coupled with intense hop flavor and good mouthfeel makes this brew a good sipper.",Bear Republic Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,93

A - It's ""alive"", so has a cloudy look to its (light) orange color. Soapy head dissipates fairly quickly. Lighter (looking) than most IPAs. S - NICE nose to this; soapy, grapefruit-y hops; promising... T - Pervasive hoppiness, balanced with a nice, continuous backbone of malty sweetness. Just before you get of alcohol at the end, there's a hint of orange/grapefruit pith, that is really distinct. Hangs around for a bit too... M - Smooth, as a result of low carbonation and un-filtered-ness D - Could easily down a few of these and enjoy the helll out of them.

610,2751,lumikuuro,3.77,"650ml bottle.  Appearance: Cloudy orange, with no hint of head forming at all during the first half of the pour, so I poured the rest very aggressively. Formed a small head that rapidly receded to large bubbles around the edges but left good lacing.  Aroma: Very citrusy hop, nothing else. Standard but decent.  Taste: Lots of grapefruit, lots of orange. This gives it lots of flavour, and the orange mellows and smooths the beer. Impressed with this aspect. Bitter hop finish doesn't stay strong as long as you would expect for the style, however. 7% abv is decently camouflaged. Moderately crisp, slight dryness.  Mouthfeel: Well. There is sensible carbonation in this beer, so what was the problem with the head? Also, this beer is refermented in the bottle, so some natural sediment is to be expected... but I unexpectedly got a chunk the size of a raisin. That's a bit much. Otherwise functional.  Drinkability: Maybe I was unlucky with the size of sediment; if that's how this beer is, along with the poor head and retention, they need to print on the label that the beer should be gently agitated first. As it is, I really liked the fruitiness, but found the length of hop finish too short and the appearance and mouthfeel a bit lacking.  Worth a try for the lovely orange and grapefruit flavour, but shake the bottle first.",Bear Republic Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,93

There is a budding craft distribution market starting up in PR, and it was nice to see this on the island.  This brew surprised me as a very approachable IPA for non hopheads. It has a very solid malty backbone with noticeable hops for support in IPA fashion. It reminded me a full body amber with the hop schedule dialed up to IPA status. Malty sweet without being cloying.

The BR website says that this IPA is ""The best in the USA"" I'm not sure if that is the same ""best"" as in Pabst winning a ""blue ribbon""? I sure hope not.  Overall this was a fine beer to have with wings. Not a session beer, a bit to strong for that. Not mind-blowing, as the website might imply, but a good solid hoppy IPA.

610,2751,alleykatking,4.28,Got this in a trade with Pecorasc. Thanks for everything once again Sam! Poured from 12oz bottle.  A- Pours a nice hazy almost burnt orange color. Good size 1 1/2 finger cloudy white head that stayed around for a short bit. Nice streaking lacing on the sides of the glass. Wonderful looking beer.  S- This IPA leans more toward bright citrus (grapefuit and orange) hop tones right off the bat. I really enjoyed the front end of this one. More earthy piney hops come crashing in the nose after the first citrus hops. Some light bready sweet malt backbones comes and goes during a sniff. This is quickly overtaken by hops almost right away though.  T- This is a nice tasting IPA. Something I haven't had in a while...just a nice tasting IPA. Citrus hops make the first apperance fast and strong...this is followed by a quick flash of piney resiny hops. The malt backbone comes through a little more in the middle to ending of this beer. It makes with a nice bready balance. The ending has some bitter hops to it...and they last!  M- Medium mouthfeel. Carbonation is good for the beer. Nice hop resin left on the palate and on the teeth. Citrus and piney hops left on the palate and deep into the aftertaste. Crisp in most aspects during drinking. Very clean tasting.  D- This was was a very drinkable IPA. I was actually quite shocked as to how much I enjoyed this beer. The drinkability on this is good but not over the top. After about 3 of these I would like to move onto something else.,Bear Republic Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,93

Nose- Sweet orange, grapefruit and pineapple all jump out individually and are accompanied by a floral presence.  Palate- The large amount of hops is not quite enough to hide the generous malt bill as it seems a good amount of emphasis was on hop flavor which is by no means a bad thing. Spicy citrus with toasted notes. Alcohol is fairly well hidden.  Mouthfeel- Medium body and carbonation level  Drinkability- I'm going to have another right now.",Bear Republic Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,93

Smells are hoppy, pine, citrus, just a touch of orange peel.  Incredible hop flavor, with grapefruit and malts following close behind. The finish is very dry, not a touch of alcohol to be found. Without looking at the bottle, I would think this is a weaker IPA, maybe 5.0 ABV. Medium carbonation. Such a creamy texture, goes down smooth and rich.  All around, a great beer!

610,2751,Walken,4.3,"Bear Republic: Racer 5, India Pale Ale (Tasted 01/27/10) 22 oz. Bottle, poured into an imperial pint glass.  Received as an extra in a trade with Alen, thanks for the fresh goodness man!  Appearance: Hazy golden liquid, like freaking sunshine, I tell you. Loads of bubbles rushing up from the bottom of the glass, feeding the bubbly, fluffy head. Blotches of bubbles chill out on the edges of the glass and the head fades down, but there's still a giant iceberg of foam that stays intact. Odor: Well rounded citrus aroma, pineapple richness on top of tangy grapefruit with a blanket of resiny, fresh aromas in the background. Consistency: Smooth and slick, definitely the hop oils are responsible for making this light bodied beer feel like it is on the verge of medium. Carbonation is not as aggressive as the bubbles would lead one to belive, but it's certainly lively and low enough to give a juicy feel. Taste: Hops make short work of showing their strength, a rush of grapefruity bitterness and flavor with the pungent herbal background noise I expect from the dankest of the dank, Columbus. Some sweet fruitiness from the Cascades in the background. Malt peeks in here and there, white bread, slightly crackery. Finish is long and hoppy, with plenty of bitter resin on the tongue.  Bear Republics strength as a brewery, seems to be getting the most out of their hops. The distinctive qualities of three relatively similar hop varieties all come out in this beer. Love.",Bear Republic Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,93

Not much of a malt presence on the front or back end of this beer. Finishes dry and stays on the palate for a while.  M: Smoothe and sticky, a nice soft body on the tongue.  D: Pretty drinkable.

610,2751,jdklks,4,"Pours a nice, light golden amber color with a soft of white head that thinly laces the sides of the glass. The aroma could be stronger, but it is good. An apple cider sweetness that suggests a good deal of malt for an IPA mingles well with piney, citrusy hops.  The flavor is the equivalent of the smell, with some malt sweetness up front followed by a blast of west-coast IPA hoppiness that is almost offensive to the palate. This particular bottle is over 3 months old and the hops are still kicking some major ass. Piney and citrusy through the middle (with a hint of orange), with a pure, slightly alcoholic, grapefruit bitterness in the finish and aftertaste. This one borders on DIPA.  Mouthfeel is medium bodied but a little under-carbonated, which is fine in the winter, but takes away a bit from its feel/drinkability in the summer when the exploding carbonation of a well-made IPA is just so refreshing.  Overall, a very good IPA",Bear Republic Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,93

I see a lot of floaties suspended in the beer, I am not sure if they are pieces of hops or yeast but I would think it could be due to the bottle conditioning? I will say this the smell of this brew is great, a nice mix of hops as pine is clearly there but also a nice juicy citrus aroma. The malt is faintly there but it is hard to pick up. The taste is great, the hops are in the forefront and give a nice flavor, more on the citrus side of things with a slight tea like finish. Has a somewhat sweet feel to it as well as a slight toasted character and does feel slick on the mouth. Adequate carbonation and the 7% ABV seems to be completely hidden. Overall this is a excellent brew, now for my taste the bomber is the perfect size for me as this hoppy style is usually a one and done for the evening.

I love taking a whiff of that immediate release of aromas from an IPA bottle.  Flavor is very clean, bitter and hoppy. Lots of citrus, with the slightest bit of peppery spice. Fruity and perfumy, but not sweet. Definitely a dry, west-coast IPA. Mouthfeel is smooth, if a little thin. Great carbonation. No detection of the 7 percent ABV.

If I see Racer 5 up there I at least know that I have a beer that I will enjoy and will keep me planted on a bar stool for a few minutes. Racer 5 is easy to drink and it's murky volume allows for a great texture. Although 7%, the alcohol is not incredibly present which generally leads to multiple pints. Hops are significantly present with a touch of citrus. I love that this brew can serve as an everyday choice or become a great session beer depending on how I'm feeling.

S: Respectable malt presence of hay/straw. The hops are a mixture of Columbus and Cascade and provide a heavy dose of grapefruit, orange rind, flowers and, odd as it may sound, I picked up on a wild onion grass aroma. There is a pleasant earthy yeast character to add to the aroma's complexity.  T: The alcohol is almost completely masked, but not quite. Very subtle tropical fruit suggestions of honeydew melon, guava and passion fruit. Lightly acidic and leaning towards the bitter end.  M: The Racer 5 is light in body and on the thin side. The alcohol comes through more than one would expect from a 7% brew (and particularly so on the finish). A fizzy carbonation adds some structure to the mouthfeel. Finishes bitter.

There is a nice white head that is about .75 inch tall with nice dense bubbles and active carbonation that moves slowly from the bottom of the glass.  S - Gorgeous flowery hops come up front. I love the hoppy beers from BR. Roses and pine come to mind first. Refreshing. Some sweet malty tones at the beginning along with a nutty character. Some sweet grapefruit and citric hints as well.  T - Initially there is a nice malt grain character with some hints of almonds and walnuts. Then it quickly turns into a citric bomb of hop flavor. Wow! Very nice and at the same time light bodied and refreshing. One of the nicer IPA's out there that could be a gateway IPA for newer hop heads.  M - A little on the light side for my taste but still very good and nice combination of flavors. Crisp refreshing and with great citrus dryness.  D - very high.

Beery is a crystal clear honey-amber color with a quickly dissipating off-white head that leaves plenty of lace. Smell is of hops, with some citrusy grapefruit and woodsy notes. The flavor is very hoppy, with the woodsy hop flavor dominating but other less identifiable notes present as well. There is a hint of malt at the end, but little to no sweetness - this is a dry beer. The ABV is high, but this brew doesn't taste strongly of alcohol - just a hint of heat indicates the strength. The carbonation really carries the hop flavor through my mouth, and the hop bitterness lingers long after I've swallowed due to the way it coats your mouth. This beer feels good in the mouth, with an appropriate amount of body, and plenty of carbonation.

It leaves some good lacing on the glass. The aroma is all hops, both citrusy and woodsy. As you would expect, the flavor is also dominated by the hop character. It starts out dry, then builds to sharp bitterness that lingers on after you swallow. You can detect some alcohol, especially in the finish and aftertaste. There are flavors that remind me of fruit and forests. This is as good as an IPA can get. It has a medium body and a higher-than-average amount of carbonation. It leaves a coating to your mouth that evaporates while you let the bitter flavors linger. This is an impressively drinkable IPA. There are hops everywhere, but I never grow tired of them.

As for Mouthfeel and Drinkability, this is one to drink at a Happy Hour!  Great IPA. I am going to be in N.California in about six months, I will visit this brewery.  -Bye",Bear Republic Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,93
610,2751,CharlatanSin,4.77,"This beer is my golden standard for IPAs. Now that a store a few blocks from me has started carrying it, it's finally time for a review.  Poured from a bomber into my Swarthmore College pint glass.  A: A very nice amber, more orange than yellow. A big, foamy off white head that retains and leaves big league lacing. I like my IPAs hazy, and this one is too clear for me, but very attractive nonetheless.  S: Hops, naturally, rule the day. A big hit of pine (my dad: ""It smells like a Christmas tree""), with a good deal of grapefruit citrus. Definitely gets my mouth watering.  T: Bitter, sweet and delicious. The hops come at you with pineapple, grapefruit, pine and floral notes. A little bit of bready malt in the middle. The finish is bitter, dry and looong.  M: Sticky and dry. Medium bodied, medium carbonation.  D: As I said, this is probably my favorite easily attainable IPA. A fixture in my fridge that I can (and do) drink all night.",Bear Republic Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,93
610,2751,pittpenguin,4.03,"A: Very clear amber orange in color. Thin off white head that retains throughout, nice lacing. Very nice.  S: Lots of citrus, but a little too much pine for me. I would prefer the citrus to be bursting out, but alas... Malts are represented with some honey-breadiness.  T: Decent malt back with some caramel toffee smoothness. Hops are the dominate breed in this brew. Your likeable citrus, and less so piney tones. Alcohol not complicating the fine finish. Finish is long and bitter.  MF: medium bodied good carbonation, goes down well for this hophead.  D: Good and smooth.",Bear Republic Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,93
610,2751,BigBry,4.2,"Draft pint on tap at the Yard House in Glendale. Slightly hazy, orange amber colored off white white head that left thin lace sheets, and lasted the entire glass. Citrus hops present as soon as you get close to the glass. The citrus fruity hops are also present in the taste, but also more earthiness come out, especially in the aftertaste. There is enough malt to keep the spicy bitterness in check. The finish has lots of resinous hops. Body and mouthfeel is full, a bit prickly yet smooth. Could almost be a Double IPA (not sure of the exact specifications), higher (7%) alcohol is not noticable at all. Highly drinkable and enjoyable. Paired well with a hot and spicy dish.  Also have tried the bottled version.",Bear Republic Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,93
610,2751,Jayli,4.2,"Had 12/4 on tap at Baggy's in Oakland.  A: This beer pours a murky amber color with a one finger of offwhite head. Head recedes at a modest rate and leaves nice thick sticky sheets of lacing on the glass.  S: Nose is of major citrus and piney hops.  T: Taste starts with a huge dose of citrus hops. The grapefruit really comes through on this beer. Middle is filled with a nice malt backbone that is present throughout the beer but really comes through in the middle. Finish is of grassy and piney hops.  M: Lighter side of medium body, moderate carbonation, oily resin feel with a dry finish.  D: I'm glad that I took notes on this one, I thought that I had tried Racer 5 before, and hadn't. Nicely balanced, good bite, goes down easily and we certainly made a night from this beer!",Bear Republic Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,93
610,2751,bonkers,4.12,"I poured from a 12 ounce bottle into a standard pint glass. It pours a clear copper. The head is 2 fingers deep, rock solid and sticky as hell. Really strong aroma for an IPA. The piney hops really hit hard. The flavor is hop forward, copious amounts of pine and citrus. It has enough malt for some balance. The beer has a sticky mouthfeel, is medium bodied and generally a well done brew.",Bear Republic Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,93
610,2751,Augustiner719,4.32,"Poured from a 22oz bomber into a Guiness Pint  Appearance: 1 finger head, nice honey comb head shape with bubbles of foam in peaks. Amber orange color that is slightly hazy.  Smell: Smells fantastic. Almost like Nugget Nectar with the fresh hops aroma comming through. Pine, lemon grass, rosemary, grapefruit.  Taste: tastes very crisp and fresh. Great grapefruit and citrus components. Nice leathery, woody midpalate. All in all a great IPA. Bordering on the level of hops of many DIPAs out there.  Mouthfeel: Nice viscous, sticky texture that coats the palate well.  Drinkability: Solid IPA. Over the top in terms of hops for most IPAs out there and it borders on the flavor and intensity of DIPAs but its delicious so that makes this very drinkable and sessionable.",Bear Republic Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,93
610,2751,californiakulak,3.52,Pint at a pizza joint in SF.  A. Lighter than I would have expected for the style. Lots of bubbles and good head.  S. Very hoppy. Pine and floral notes. Fresh smell.  T. Not as bitter as the smell would have you believe. Not much else is going on either. A little bit of a let down. It also doesn't hide the alcohol as well as some other similar IPAs.  M. Light and not too bitter. Fairly dry aftertaste. Nice oily feel as well.  D. Smooth beer that is quite drinkable. Didn't quite live up to my expectations but good non the less.,Bear Republic Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,93
610,2751,BevMoAndrew,4.22,"Served into a Bruery tulip glass at about 40 degrees.  Shows a golden color in the glass with a thick white front, excellent head retention, and an above average lacing. There is sediment in the glass...wish I knew that the 12 oz bottle was bottle conditioned. Yep...there's hops in there. Aromas of pine, grapefruit, orange, lemon-lime, subtle mango, some hop spiciness, fresh hop flowers, carmel maltiness, & a touch of biscuit. If you're looking for a great example of a west coast IPA...look no further. In terms of flavor, everything that you get on the nose, you get on the palate. The bitterness of the beer is unavoidable, but smooth and tingly from beginning to end. Well balanced from the malt character to the overwhelming hop presence. Long finish. Overall a great IPA! if you haven't had the racer 5 before....it's about time you did!",Bear Republic Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,93
610,2751,Wisconsinality,3.65,"poured from 22 oz bottle into standard pint glass  A- Pours a clear golden orange with a little bit of an amber tint. A big frothy head stays quite well and leaves a nice bit of lacing on the side of the glass.  S- A nice bit of pine with some citrus fruit in there. A nice malty backbone helps balance off the nose.  T- A bit of grapefruit, some pine and a little bit of sweetness from the malt. Hops are somewhat subdued in this one. I was expecting more of a west coast hop bomb. Not bad nonetheless.  M- Medium bodied brew that has a bit of a smoothness to it. There is hardly any bite on the tongue meaning not too much bitterness.  D- This is a pretty easy drinking IPA. It is not bad but there is nothing that really distinguishes it from other IPA's.",Bear Republic Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,93
610,2751,pokesbeerdude,4.02,"From Notes  22oz, Arctic Liquors in Steamboat, CO. $5  A: Gold in color verging on amber, cream colored head about 1/4"" thick, sticky clumps of lacing. Somewhat cloudy, fair head retention, nice cap. 4  S: Big citrus hops, grapefruit, orange, fairly herbal, somewhat peppery as well. Malty undertones of caramel, slightly bready. Underlying passion fruit smell. 4.5  T: Taste follows nose nicely, grapefruit, passion fruit, citrus peel bitterness, think biting into a grapefruit through the rind, excellent lingering bitterness. Malt is really pushed to the side in this beer, slightly biscuity and a hint of caramel. Feeds the hop craving for tonight, but completely lacks balance. 4  M: Medium to light bodied, mild carbonation, very dry, slight alcohol warmth. Not too bad. 4  D: Easy enough to drink, nice flavors and a strong hop profile with a light bitterness is nice. Needs a little more sweetness to kick it up to the next level. Definitely will get again though. Recommended if looking for a hop fix.",Bear Republic Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,93
610,2751,mbudner,4.28,"Poured from bottle into a pint glass.  A-Slightly hazy, golden-orange, 2-finger white head with big bubbles on top, looks quite frothy.  S- Citrus, fruity and/or floral hops, bready flavor, orange rinds  T- Very floral, tastes of whole hop flowers with a bitter citrusy bite at the end. Very clean tasting. Slight biscuity flavor balances out the hops in the finish, but I wouldn't call this a ""balanced"" IPA by any means (to me this is a GOOD thing)  M- Very sticky with nice carbonation, slick hop oils coat my entire mouth and my lips are left sticky  D- All around, a phenomenal American IPA. I could drink these all night. I am aware that the boundaries are quite loose and pliable, but for an American IPA (not a double, imperial, ""triple"", etc.) this is one of the best I have had.",Bear Republic Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,93
610,2751,Beerandraiderfan,4.17,"A really solid IPA, one of the first I can recall that started taking on the orange hue and do something that tasted different than the traditional and classic Cascade/Centennial/Chinook hopping.  Hop existence doesn't come right out initially, then you take that first sip, and bam, crisp, tangerine citrus zest, this is one of the classic beers that has a lot of similar influenced IPAs coming out in recent years.  I get some wildly inconsistent ones of these, probably because of the lack of bottle dating and large distribution footprint. When its on, its on. When its not, it lacks the hop vibrancy and takes on that vague woody bitterness.",Bear Republic Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,93
610,2751,berley31,4.33,"A: Poured with a nice, large, frothy white head that hung around for a while before dissipating to 1/2-finger or so. Nice lacing on the glass. Body is mostly clear with a little haze and some particles floating around, and a orange color.  S: Pleasant aroma of heavy hops, some pine, and a lot of orange citrus.  T: Awesome flavor here. The citrus (orange) bursts through at the beginning, with some pine in there as well, and a very hoppy, bitter finish. Still manages to be smooth, however.  M: Medium-bodied and creamy, with average carbonation.  D: This is an excellent IPA... very flavorful and hoppy, but still quite easy to drink.",Bear Republic Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,93
610,2751,GeezLynn,4.3,"A: Nice cloudy orange color with a little white head that disappears faster than Steinbrenner writes checks.  S: Fresh hops. Mainly citrus fruits, (not much pine or malt) with a little spicyness. Nice floral scents.  T: First and foremost, sweet juicy grapefruit. Along with citrus hop flavors, the breadiness and pale malt are apparent just before the enjoyable finishing punch of bitterness.  M: Very smooth. Could stand to have a little more carbonation, but that's really minor.  Very good IPA, up there with the best of them. Especially nice combination of citrus and bitterness. I would drink this regularly if I was fortunate enough to have access.",Bear Republic Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,93
610,2751,SausageTurkish,4.22,"A: I've had cask, on tap and from the bottle; neither tap nor bottle has a lot of head nor retains it for a particularly long time. That being said, what remains is off-white and laces quite well. Very bright copper color with some hop / yeast haze.  S: Very strong West coast hops but a clean malt base does come through slightly. Citrus (grapefruit) dominates but there is a faint amount of pine.  T: In my opinion, this is one of, if not the best American IPAs out there right now. The balance of the citrusy hops and clean malts produces an extremely enjoyable IPA experience. There are no off-putting aftertastes (e.g. soap / metallic) that I've gotten from some other strong AIPAs  M: Remarkably smooth for the style and the ABV. Well-attenuated fermentation; no stickiness lingers. Crisp and clean.  D: High ABV - you might not want to session with it if you aren't used to 7+ ABV but if you can hang with it, you will not regret it.",Bear Republic Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,93

THe head is white, tight, and foamy and rises above the brim ever so slightly. It takes a while to recede leaving behind some decent lacing.  Smells a bit Sierra Neavada like, with heavy lemon citrus and some herbally, spicy hops along with some pine and a bit of malt sweetness.  Taste is hoppy and sharply bitter, with more of a grapefruit citrus tinge along with grassy, herbal, piney hops. The malts are more prevalent in this one compared to other west coast IPAs I have had.

Complex pineapple qualities including a nice tropical flavor with some sweetness and acidity. Sharp piney bitterness lingers through finish. Mellow malts and breadiness provide a good foundation.

S: Hops, pine, gradefruit, pineapple, citrus. Nice.  T: Sweet and malty up front. Tastes are similar to the nose. Bitter hops finish. Maybe just a little too bitter once the beer warms a bit. Instructions on the bottle say to serve this at 45-50 degrees. I don't think I would recomend drinking it quite that warm.  M: Fairly light body and pretty smooth. Appropriate amount of carbonation. Hops leave the tongue tingling like most other IPAs.  D: Not my favorite IPA, but it's very good. Very drinkable and lots of good flavor. Hops just a little too overpowering in the finish, but that's only a minor complaint.",Bear Republic Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,93

Impacted afterwards by the hops and piney/citrusy goodness. Mouthfeel is Med. bodied with medium carbonation.  Drink: Pretty good brew here, could drink a few i am sure.

610,2751,feelmefoam,4.48,"Poured from a 12-oz bottle into a DFH specialty glass.  Racer 5 pours an amazing muted orange color, pretty much the exact color of apple juice. The bottle boasts that 'yeast is good', and yet although there is a minor amount of sediment floating around, it's actually crystal clear. There is a wonderful stream of lively carbonation running up the middle of the glass, stemming from the etching on the bottom. This beer boasted a beautiful, sticky white head about an inch high that left some pretty amazing lacing all around the glass. Just a sexy looking beer.  This beer gushes citrus scent into your nose. Those citrusy hops just go wild in the aroma. Can't wait to taste this.  Like the nose, a lot of citrus hops up front and in the finish. There is also a little earthiness in the flavor, pretty muted underneath all the citrus. Pale malt is also present, it squeezes itself into the middle of the medley, balancing things, then lets the hops take back over.  Smooth, light mouthfeel with just the right amount of carbonation to tickle the tongue. Very nice mouthfeel for an IPA.  Overall this is a very drinkable IPA, even at 7%. It's also a real looker, and the flavor definitely doesn't disappoint. I'll buy it again, for sure.",Bear Republic Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,93
610,2751,jlindros,4.2,"I've had this beer before, and its a great IPA, but never reviewed it. I felt like a nice big IPA which I haven't had in a while, so here it is.  A: Pouring into my oversized DFH snifter leaves a nice 1 finger head spread out with lots of big bubbles mid head, making it look like a battleground. It's pretty hazy with a golden pale beautiful IPA color.  N: Mmm, beautiful hop aromas billow out through the tapered top. Its full of citrus, juicy fruit hop aromas, and some pine. A very slight touch of malt and alcohol bite. Great nose, but I like a little more pine and grapefruit on a great IPA, but this is its own beast.  T: Surprisingly it starts with a fresh malt wort taste. That doesn't last long as a slew of hops and bitterness hit. More fresh citrus and juicy fruits, and some earthy grassy hop flavors. Even some piney hops build up and start to gain some ground. A slight tangy hop bitterness also strikes. A very slight malt sweetness and alcohol presence lets itself be known, but its dwarfed compared to the hop presence. A little bit of hop oils come out as well.  M: It has some body and slight oily feel, decent carbonation, and touch of spicy hop presence.  F: Finshes pretty bitter and semi dry. Its not super overpowering on the bitterness, but its presence is very obvious. Some floral hop flavors linger for a bit, and the bitterness slowly rises as the taste fades. A little more bitter earthiness finishes off the finish.  Final thoughts: A nice semi heavy IPA. It's not an imperial or double or anything like that, just a nice hoppy IPA. A slight malt and alcohol presence, and seems like a few different blended hops, but not much on the grapefruit end, so this is a completely different beast than most. But overall a good consistent IPA.",Bear Republic Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,93

610,2751,craftaholic,4.24,"Appearance: Had on tap in pint, and it poured a translucent honey hue with just a lickin' of foam. The lacing however coats the glass like blankets.  Smell: The nose is amazing its got a one two punch of hops with just a waft of alcohol.  Taste: This one is a wonderful bouquet of liquid hops; the assault of the hops is there from the get go: at times earthy, slightly grassy, touch of apricot?, greatly citrusy. Overall: hop goodness.  Mouthfeel: Quite thin for such a massive palate attack but is is tingly and nicely carbonated non the less.  Drinkability: Quite delicious, and while it walks the line of IPA and DIPA it does what it sets out to and is easily sessionable.  Overall: Don't like hops? stay away from IPA's, Love hops?

I think I was just not used to funky IPAs at the time, so I decided to give Racer 5 a second shot.  Review updated 4/22/2012. Poured from 12oz bottle into a pint glass.  Appearance: light golden-orange hue with a touch of haze and a thick finger of frothy ivory foam. Good.  Smell: lightly funky aroma with some nice earthy/citrusy hops underneath. Not bad, although a bit lighter than I expected.  Taste: rich, malty flavor with a good earthy hop flavor complemented by a hint of citrus which is very well balanced. Kind of like a strong English IPA, maybe, with a bit more citrus. Quite good.  Mouthfeel: medium body with a bodacious carbonation and a big ol' creaminess I just can't ignore. I like it a lot.  Overall: I am very glad I re-approached this beer. My opinion last time was ""this will definitely be a beer I revisit when I've got another hundred or two beers under my belt"". Well, I've had on the order of 900 beers since then and I find this beer quite good. This beer doesn't seem a quarter as funky as I made it out to be the first time I reviewed it, so either the recipe has changed or my palate has. I will go with my palate -- at this point, I would gladly quaff Racer 5 regularly.  --- (Original review)  Poured from 22oz bomber into a pint glass.  Appearance: color is light golden, heading towards straw; head is ivory in hue and two fingers in size. Nice.  Smell: pungent is a good word to use here; hops are very earthy and a little grassy and metallic. The aroma reminds me of day old grass clippings. Perhaps ""pungent"" is not right; this beer trends far closer to ""funky"".  Taste: a lot like the smell. I am not sure how I feel about the funkiness factor here. Maybe this earthy, decomposing-plant-matter funk is intentional, but it is starting to grate on me. Either my bottle has a problem or I am not sophisticated enough for this beer.  Mouthfeel: medium body with an appropriate level of carbonation.  Drinkability: the funkiness is getting to be too much. I will definitely finish the bottle; who knows, it might start to grow on me.

A strong honey-like sweetness is present throughout, and the beer goes down leaving a sugary sweet feeling atop strong grapefruit and floral bitterness. The main things going on here are a very honey-like sweetness and fairly complex fruity/floral hops-- there is very little malt presence to speak of.  m- a tad watery, just short of that perfect level of oomph (in terms of body) for an IPA. I like the amount of carbonation-- tickles the mouth unoffensively and brings the beer to life.  d- all in all this beer is an unoffensiveand enjoyable IPA, but comes off a bit unbalanced with a lot of sweetness and not enough malt to carry it. The hops are fairly substantial but stay sharply to the fruity/flowery side.

With this one the look was dark golden, poured from a 22oz bottle into a pint glass, but the smell that it gave off was a little spice and a whole lot of hops. I had a feeling it was going to be good from that smell.  The taste was a sharp plucking by the hops, smoothing out quickly leaving behind that familiar dry feel at the end.

Pours a hazy golden orange with a nice three finger chunky light tan head with sheets of lacing.  The nose is citrusy and fruity hops, very floral in nature. A very light malt backbone is present, but you have to dig through layers of hops just to get a glimpse of it.  A little more malty than I expected. The taste is dominated by fruity and citrusy hops, but there is a very defined maltiness that gives this nice balance and an added level of complexity. Good tasting stuff, I just wish it was more hoppy.  Mouthfeel is on the lighter side of medium. Nice feathery carbonation adds to the experience. Lingering bitter aftertaste. Drinkability is good, I had no problem finishing this bomber myself.  Overall, another solid brew from Bear Republic. I definitely liked Hop Rod Rye more, but this is still a great beer.",Bear Republic Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,93
610,2751,MOShepp,4.53,"Medium gold in color with a big off white frothy head, lots of sticky web lacing.  Aroma of grapefruit, biscuit, peppery and maybe some pine.  Tastes malty at the beginning with bread then the hops kick in with resiny pine, citrus, herbal notes and very well balanced. Nice long finish.  Tons of hops but it doesn't rip your tongue out. Great beer.",Bear Republic Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,93
610,2751,kpoole25,3.84,"12 oz bottle (from make your own variety pack) to glass. Color is about like apple juice, head was a bit thin. Classic IPA smells, fruitiness and citrus. Good balance on the taste, I usually get malt up front and hops in the back and no different here. Bitter but not the biggest, which is fine with me. Pretty standard west coast IPA.",Bear Republic Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,93
610,2751,thain709,4.15,"A - A bright, golden, almost transparent orange body...a creamy white head stands about 1.5 fingers and shows off some retention...nice lacing  S - A fresh hop aroma...filled with pine, resin, and lots of grapefruit  T - This is a hop dominated beer with a lot of malts backing up those hops...the sweetness of the citrus hits you first but it doesn't become cloying...the malt sweetness is also mixed in there but it's hard to tell...the beginning is where you'll only find the malts...a rush of pine bitterness comes rushing in to finish this beer...it never becomes dry or overly bitter  M - Medium bodied...creamy and bitter...a pleasant bitterness that makes you want another sip  D - That lingering hop bite just makes you want to keep going back...a fresh bottle of this is dangerously drinkable...a well balanced beer that never becomes to hoppy...if there is such a thing!",Bear Republic Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,93
610,2751,TripT,3.97,"Served on tap at a restaurant, I erroreously thought I was ordering Racer X. Oh well. The beer arrived at my table in a standard pint glass, and by the time it got to me there was only a thin circle of white around the perimeter of the glass. The beer was nearly clear with just a slight haziness. Color was difficult to discern due to the low lighting. Certainly smells like an IPA. Pine and citrus are evident. The taste was consistent with the smell, but a bit more perfumey. Very hoppy. Apparently my palate is not sophisticated enough to comment on the malt character, as I really detected none. Just alot of juicy hop bitterness. That's not a bad thing. Went well with pizza. I enjoy the occasional super-hoppy beer, but only one per session.",Bear Republic Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,93
610,2751,sisuspeed,4.45,"This beer produces a thick, sticky, white head that floats over an unfiltered pale orange body. Lots of yeast floating around in this guy, wasn't really expecting that. Usually if I know there is going to be a lot of yeast I pour the bottle like a home brew. Anyways, the side of the bottle says ""real ale is alive, yeast is good"", so I guess I'll go with it.  Lots of piney, citrusy hops on the nose. I could smell them right away after I cracked the beer open. Always a good sign of a well crafted IPA. Some malts also come through, but the earthy, grassy hops dominate.  After a couple of sips I can say that this is an excellent IPA. This beer is extremely well balanced. With a lot of IPA's and DIPA's I usually taste hops up front followed by some degree of maltiness, but with Racer 5 the flavors come all at once. Delicious, robust malts mix with hoppy bitterness letting you know this is indeed an IPA, but then the finish is very smooth with a hint of citrus.  Mouthfeel is nearly perfect for an IPA and almost starts to border on what I would expect from a DIPA. Sticky, sweet, smooth and bitter all in one. This beer is highly drinkable. I could drink this all day and all night. I will definitely be seeking this beer out again and looking for more Bear Republic brews.",Bear Republic Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,93
610,2751,abuliarose,4.32,"Poured into a pint glass. Holy cow there are a lot of yeast floaties in this one. Was unaware they would not have settled after keeping it upright for weeks but... bottle says yeast is good so... will keep those little guys in mind when tasting. Beautiful thick head, golden amber color otherwise. The yeast do detract from the overall appearance.  Smells crisp and hoppy (almost fresh hop-hoppy)with floral honey notes. Tastes very sweet for an IPA with distinctly not-bitter orange notes. Almost like I'm drinking it and sucking on an orange slice. Otherwise there is definitely the nice hoppy IPA bitterness, though not too assuming. I'd have thought there'd be a little more yeast taste but it doesn't come through as bready, instead rounds the beer flavor out a little more. Mouthfeel is nice and smooth, carbonation is not peppery and compliments the orange flavor well. Fairly medium-bodied. Quite drinkable. Extremely refreshing.  The bottle-conditioned thing had me a little at first, but this is a pretty solid beer. I'm gonna poke around now for some Racer X!",Bear Republic Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,93

610,2751,truknon,4.8,"Served from a Bomber and poured into a Pint Glass.  The initial whiff hit me with strong fruity flavors, particularly Banana. After pouring the first glass it had an exceptional golden color and ridiculous foamy head. It actually stuck out over the top of the glass with beautiful Peaks and Points, reminiscent of a Mountain range. The creamy foam head actually never dissipates and the first sip is intense with the fore mentioned fruity flavors and ends on the bitter side. It is medium to full bodied and not to carbonated.  The overall drinkability is very smooth and not overpowering, which makes you want to have another glas!!. I highly recommend this IPA and it may just be the best I have had in a while. To the store...for more!!!",Bear Republic Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,93
610,2751,confer,2.36,"Still do not have a taste for these overly hoppy IPAs. I like the look, nice gold with lots of floaties from the bottle conditioning. The piney aroma is not overbearing.

610,2751,glid02,4.42,On-tap at the Brick Store.  Pours a slightly hazy light copper color with a 1.5-finger white head. The head recedes into a thin layer on top leaving solid lacing.  Smells of bright citrus and tropical fruit hops with an underlying earthiness and good amounts of pale malts.  Tastes very similar to how it smells. Pale malt flavors up front are joined quickly by citrus and tropical fruit flavors. Midway through the sip the hop flavors turn somewhat herbal and all flavors carry through to a mildly bitter and crisp ending.  Mouthfeel is good. It has a solid thickness with moderate carbonation.  Drinkability is very good. I finished my glass quickly and could have a few more.  Overall this is a standout among standby's in the world of IPA's. Worth a shot if you haven't had it.,Bear Republic Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,93
610,2751,bcm119,4.5,"Clear gold in color, minimal white lace.  Floral hop aroma, some citrus, some ripe fruit esters.  Ripe citrus hops and a soft, green bitterness intermingle with some flowery/stone fruit esters. These flavors are nicely integrated and give Racer 5 a slight ""funky"", high-grade marijuana flavor that I can always recognize in a blind tasting. The mouthfeel is soft, with medium carbonation. Malts lend a a bit of substance mid-palate, along with the esters. The finish is softly bitter with a hint of raw grain. One of the nation's best IPAs, partly because of it's availability and ability to taste good in the bottle as well as from the tap.",Bear Republic Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,93

Nice hop presence in the nose and great hop presence in the taste. Medium malt presence in the backing but much larger hop presence up front. Nice ripe tangerine, bitter ruby grapefruit, sprucy and piney. Really well done, has the mouthfeel of a great Imperial IPA or close to it. Reminds me of the Two-Hearted Ale. Not as smooth but close to it and hoppier with slightly more malt character. Hard to find a better everyday IPA.",Bear Republic Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,93
610,2751,drabmuh,4.79,"Poured from a bottle into a standard pint glass. Beer is amber, clear until the yeast poured into the glass (my bad). Carbonation is steady, head forms full and white, falls away leaving a diffuse head behind and some lacing on the glass.  Aroma is hop filled wonderment. I love sniffing this beer. There are some beers that I wouldn't care if I never took a drink, this is one of them. I would love to just smell this beer over and over again, but I digress.  Full bodied, hits all parts of the palate, high bitterness on the back end, the hop oils coat your tongue. There is not a dominant aftertaste, amazingly. Some sweetness on the front, one of the best American IPAs I've ever had.  Hop heads take notice, track this down, find it. The hop character is a nicely balanced mixture of pine and citrus. A great great beer.",Bear Republic Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,93

S - Lot of hops and citrus, very grapefruity with some pine notes. Very refreshing smelling.  T - Excellent taste, was worried that the grapefruit in this would be overpowering, but is not the case. Nice and clean in the middle and hits you with a late bite just when you think it's all gone.  M - Clean, refreshing, with nice carbonation. A little bit past light bodied, but not heavy at all.  D - Can definately do a lot of these, citris will become a little overpowering after a while, but it would be a while.

Nice lacing though.  edit- came back after leaving about quarter a glass in the kitchen after 3 hours....still had carbonation....crazy I know. But definitely made an impression, still tasted great too!  S- smells of citrus and pine, very yummy, a hint of sweetness as well. like putting your face in an orange and grapefruit while in the middle of a forrest. Reminds me of Skiing trees for some reason? needless to say unbelievable.  T- man this is good stuff. very hoppy but not over powering, definetly taste the pine, the taste lingers and still tastes good. would only need a little more sweetness to be perfect. but close to it.

610,2751,apbarwood,4.35,"Dull amber color with an off-white crown of foam and some light lace. The smell of hops is noticeable on the nose with a faint citrus aroma. Strong citrus flavors come through first dominated by a semi-sweet orange with a trace of grapefruit held in check by a malty backbone. A nice fresh, cleansing hoppy quality on the finish that's dry and snappy. Everything is blended to near perfection. For a relatively high ABV beer this one goes down easily and is delicious to boot. I could probably drink a handful of these before I knew what hit me, and I mean that as a nod to the beer and not my stupidity. At any rate, I highly recommend this one.",Bear Republic Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,93
610,2751,OnThenIn,3.79,"Appearance: This beer rather cloudy and actually has floaties, which kinda kills the appearance. The beer has a dark copper color and an off white head. There was a finger of head, but it quickly dissipated leaving some nice lacings.  Smell: Man this is hops with a side of sweetness. The hops are really fruity with some passionfruit and citrus. There is some lemon aroma as well. There is some sweet malt backing the hops. Just a really balanced smell.  Taste: The taste starts out with bitterness, but really opens up to a sweeter, citrus hop based flavor and finishes pretty clean with an underlying bitterness. The taste is not very complex, but it has a nice balance.  Mouthfeel: Medium to thin bodied beer. The carbonation is a little on the light side, but there is a very clean finishing helping make this a rather refreshing beverage.  Drinkability: This seems even more of an easy drinking beer than a good deal of the other ipas I have been having lately, like Ithaca's Flower Power.",Bear Republic Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,93

Powerful grapefruit and citrus with some more sweet tropical fruit joining in. Some malt but mostly a showcase of mouth-watering hops.  T. Taste is superb, the hops are not overpowering and there is just enough of a malt backbone to support them.  M. Great medium/light body, smooth and not overly carbonated.  D.

Aroma is all about hops, bursting juicy fruity delicious hops, mixing with malt though and remaining sweet. My experience with these beers tells me the flavors will be nothing but bitter, destroy your pallet in your face hops.  I was wrong! This thing is balanced! Taste is soo hoppy, yet sweet, yet malty and caramel filled delicious! Hops bite all the way through, while malt and 2 row keep things somwhat sweet. Its crisp and refreshing. Hops in flavor are mostly bitter with not much in the way of citric floral taste. Its pine and bitter hops all the way through. Mouthfeel is a bit more full bodied with a backing of mild creamyness. Carbonation tickle keeps the mouthfeel balanced even. God, this is a great beer. Its drinakeable without hop overload and still has great hop flavor and bitters.

Just a bit of bready malts show up here too.  T: As in the aroma, piney and floral hops dominate, with a lot of citrus hop flavor coming through too. A solid malt backbone does its job of balancing the brew. There's also a little spiciness, sort of a peppery undertaste which is little unexpected. This is very tasty overall.  M: Level of carbonation is adequate, really lets the hops hit my tongue. As soon as you swallow, you get a bit more of the malt flavor. The finish fades quite rapidly, almost enticing me to take another drink. A pepper and hop aftertaste invites another drink.  O: A very good IPA, and at 7%, this could get a person into trouble somewhat quickly. I would have guessed it in the 5% range.

Grabs you by the tongue right off the bat with a bitter, resinous, pine sap attack. Finishes with an oily, medicinally bitter finish.

The nose is caramel and hoppy, followed by a very dominant deep malt. Not sure what malt was used but reminds me of the bags of Munich malt that a lugged around the NOLA brewery for a day or two this summer. I am surprised by the smell of this, I was expecting more hops than malt in the smell, but besides the initial floral hop note, malt is the lead here. Bit of a buttery smell as it lingers. Taste has a quick bitter roll into the back of the mouth, followed by a nice sweet malt taste, immediately erases my presuppositions about IPAs. A few sips in and I have already decided to buy it again next time I go to Steins. This beer has a really smooth feel to it in the mouth, it is crisp and has a quick finish that leaves you wanting more. I think this beer has the perfect level of carbonation, not too much, but it's there and it has all liveliness on my tongue to let me know it's a fresh beer.

A very gentle malt adds a light balance to the aroma. Hops straight up attack the palate first. There's something toasted underneath the whole thing, and a submissive malt gives way to the raw grapefruit of the hops. The mouthfeel is smooth, and a moderate carbonation gives a crisp bite to it.

A gentle kiss of lemon sweeps through, faintly; otherwise this is one of the least citrus-centric IPAs that I've had in some time. What is here is pleasant and appetizing, but compared to top IPAs (even to Bear Republic's own Hop Rod Rye) the aromas are not in the same neighborhood of complexity.  On the palate, the pungency of the hops is immediate. They lend a moist, almost spoiled quality to the beer (in a good way, if that makes sense). There is a much more pronounced floral character on the tongue, with helps to temper the pine that otherwise dominates the hop profile. Racer 5, this bottle at least, is not solely about the hops, however. There is a burst of malt sweetness that keeps the pungent hops in check, and this maltiness maintains its strength throughout the drink. At times you can really catch the caramel malt like silk, working its way through the pale malt.  The mouthfeel is fine. It seems light, which I like in IPAs, but for some reason I don't feel that the mouthfeel works with the flavors here. I think that it might be the overactive carbonation. If you've read my recent IPA reviews then you know that I typically love a light-bodied, prickly IPA but Racer 5 is perhaps too prickly. The harshness of the effervescence takes away from my ability to perceive the subtleties of the beer. Drinkability has to be scored well. If there is a plus to the over-active carbonation its that it refreshes the palate quickly from its lingering pine flavors. I know that this comes in 6 packs now, and Racer 5 would be an ideal IPA for an afternoon on the couch watching football, say.  Overall, this Bear Republic offering is not an IPA that blew me away (unlike Hop Rod Rye, which ranks among my top 5 IPAs). There are other IPS that better showcase the totality of what the hop can be. But a solid, drinkable, tasty IPA is nothing to be ashamed of. I wouldn't throw rocks at this IPA. Its clearly west-coast in nature and would satisfy a hop craving. Its good stuff.",Bear Republic Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,93
610,2751,squirrelpirate,4.35,"Bear Republic Racer 5 poured a clear, light orange hue with a pillowy white head. The aroma is packed with hops. Excellent citrus and pine notes with a hint of malt sweetness as well.  This beer started out with a sweet, bready feeling on the tongue with a piney bitterness. The hops quickly drown out the malt and power through the aftertaste. A very floral, clover taste lingers on the tongue.  Moderate body and and mild carbonation. Solid medium mouthfeel and very drinkable if you can stand the huge hops. An exceptional IPA.",Bear Republic Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,93
610,2751,seand,4.05,"Poured into a pint glass.  A: Pours a very cloudy yellow amber, with a short but thick and foamy white head, which leaves nice lacing.  S: You can smell the piney floral hops when you open the bottle. There's also a little bit of sweetness, but the hops dominate.  T: Strong hops, but more flavorful than super bitter. Balanced with some sweetness, but the IPA bitterness is certainly present.  M: Medium amount of smooth carbonation, full and sticky mouthfeel.  D: Drinks pretty easy, though for some people I would imagine the bitterness could get in the way.",Bear Republic Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,93
610,2751,donniecuffs,3.65,"UPDATE 11/23/11: Had this on tap again lately, and it was a more pleasant experience, with 2 notable points since last time: 1. the head retention and lacing was much better; 2. much more citrus midpalate (yet a thin'ish finish).  This review was for a 22oz bottle poured into an American pint glass, but I have also had it on tap, with varying results. As such, my big knock on this beer is inconsistency.  A: Orange/amber, with a thin head that dissipated quickly and laced spottily.  S: Very subtle citrus on the nose with an earthy/pine undertone. (The pint I had on tap was much more pronounced in citrus diversity.)  T: Ditto the aroma. Very lacking in citrus flavor, with earthy/woodiness dominating. Too much so for an ipa. Hoppy bitterness doesn't enter the equation until the dry aftertaste hits you. (Again, this was better on tap as well.)  M: Creamy, like most of the BR offerings, yet lightly drinkable.  D: Light to throw a few back, but needs more flavor. Again, the big knock on this beer is inconsistency.",Bear Republic Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,93

Perfect for a hot day.",Bear Republic Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,93
610,2751,Kitt,4.03,"Pours a beautiful golden color with a two-finger thick head that rapidly dissipates. Thus, lace develops quickly but remains thick and persistent. Aroma, piney, hoppy, with equal parts citrus.  Palatte greeted with a blast of bitter piney hops with a distant hint of straw! Hop flavor is strong and lasting but does not over-linger. A background citrus flavor is brief at onset but drowned by hops within moments. Overall, a very bitter IPA.  Mouthfeel of moderate wieght. Drinkability smooth, light, refreshing. This is a fine -- albeit heavy-hopped -- IPA. The ""heavy hop"" works well here and is balanced by the beer's refreshing drinkability. A great summer evening brew.",Bear Republic Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,93
610,2751,Durge,4.13,"Poured cold at Moe's in Lee, MA this one shows a clear amber color with a slight bubbly white cap and good lacing. The aroma is not very strong but suggests piney hops and caramel bread. The flavor jumps out bold and delicious with a tangy pine hop and orange toffee complements. Solidly mid-bodied for a smooth feel with modest carbonation. This leaves a decided lemony bite but it's mostly a beautiful bready hop blend that's plenty drinkable but may be a bit much to session for some. Nice...",Bear Republic Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,93
610,2751,HalfFull,3.61,"From a bomber into a pint glass, the beer pours a hazy golden orange with a thin head. Settles to a surface cap in a couple minutes, then a surface ring, and offers light lacing throughout the pint.  Citrus and pine notes on the nose with some malt lingering in the shadows. A bit too clean however with notable dead spots. Rather rich and malty on the tongue, particularly given the color of the pour. Reduces to a rather simple IPA, and somewhat sweet as the carbonation diminishes too fast.  Have had this on tap a number of times. Anywhere from blah to beautiful, this brew is too unpredictable to buy again. It's all over the place and too dependent on carbonation for success. I'll stick to more reliable options in the future, and this 'bottle conditioned' serving seems no different. Buttery, sweet and unpredictable in the hops/carbonation/feel.",Bear Republic Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,93
610,2751,rowew,4.02,"Presentation: 12 oz longneck, ABV is marked but I don't see a date.  Appearance: Poured with a bit of sediment, tried to leave most of it in the bottle. Orange and hazy, average head with good retention.  Smell: Tons of hops - pine and a sticky sweet aroma.  Taste: Fairly thin, and just like the aroma, this is lots of hops flavor, but not much bitterness.  Overall impression: Nice example of a west coast IPA - lots of hops, highly drinkable.",Bear Republic Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,93
610,2751,ThreeWiseMen,3.95,"Started the night off with this one at Kennedy's Irish Pub in San Francisco two nights ago. The following review is based on notes taken that night.  Served in a standard pint glass.  Appearance: Hazy, pale gold body showed consistent and active carbonation within. Head wasn't much to speak of - only a small, white, sticky halo - though it did drag massive amounts of web-like lacing.  Smell: Lots of pine and toffee, accompanied by earthy and woody aromas. Tons and tons of flowery hops invade the nostrils. Very pungent.  Taste: Tons of pine and bitter floral hops. Grains and subtle spices also caressed the palate, but this one was definitely pine and hop heavy. Finished on a very bitter, alcoholic note.  Mouthfeel: Oily, prickly, sticky, and very dry. This IPA was also medium-bodied and peppery at times. The finish was long-lasting, bitter, and dry - maybe too dry.  Drinkability: I really wanna give this one an A-, but I can't seem to find a category where I would rank it higher than ""Good"" (4.0). This is a very solid IPA that I would recommend to anyone, and I myself will likely be ordering it again. For those that like piney IPAs, you'll especially enjoy Racer 5.",Bear Republic Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,93
610,2751,inhopswetrust,3.98,Just enjoyed this one on tap.  Appearance: light amber; very slight head and lacing.  Smell: moderate floral hops; nothing spectacular but pleasantly subtle nonetheless.  Taste: very smooth front; slight sweetness of light malts; fades into nice citrus/pine hops finish.  Mouthfeel: light but not watery; leaves slight oily residue of hops on tongue.  Drinkability: excellent standby brew; well balanced but with enough hops to keep my hop head gears turning.,Bear Republic Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,93
610,2751,OldYoda,3.68,"Pours a cloudy, hazy golden amber with a small head that rapidly disappears leaving some nice residual lacing.  Smell is subdued with an overlay of hops and a whiff of malty sweetness.  Taste is initially hops with a nice dry finish and a good balancing sweetness.  Mouthfeel is clean and dry.  Drinkability is fine - several of these is no problem. For a hophead, this is a very nice effort from Bear Republic. Bravo!!",Bear Republic Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,93
610,2751,GordonQuid,4.2,Poured into a dimpled pub mug.  Golden orange sun with a frothy one inch head that dissapates to a quarter inch head with ample lacing.  Smells of the typical American IPA; citrus and pine with an orange rind note.  Taste is fresh citrus hops and sweet malt blend. The hops linger in the finish. Quite appetizing and satisfying.  Easy drinker very smooth.,Bear Republic Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,93
610,2751,JordonHoltzman,4.12,"22oz bottle  very orangy amber, with a white bubbly pinky's head. pretty translucent. bubbly lace follows the path of the height of the beer. (EDIT: the last pour turned the beer from a very clear body to hazy, i'm guessing thats the yeast from the bottom) this beer has a citrusy aroma as well as very floral. the website says columbus and cascade hops are used. no traces of alcohol come to the nose. this is a great tasting IPA. aroma matches the taste very well. citrusy and very hoppy. i get a small lemony taste in there as well. the cardonation is slightly higher than medium, but i wouldnt say its high and i wouldnt say its too much either. its on the dry side but not too dry. i'm in an IPA tasting phase, and i don't like to compare, but i had abita's jockamo IPA yesterday, and this certainly tops it. this is my first bear republic brew, and i have to say its pretty good. i have no clue where i can get a hold of their racer X, but who knows maybe i'll find that in a glass of mine in the future, but i'll be trying other bear republics for sure.",Bear Republic Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,93
610,2751,saztheorybook,4.4,"A- Beautiful golden brown with a thick yellow-cake head that drops off pretty quickly but leaves some pretty nice lacing. S- Reeks of fresh hops, spicy and herbal with the tiniest fruit character. T-There is a surprisingly deep malt character, a low hop bitterness but loads of fruit and floral tastes in the hop itself. A nice rounded and subtle yeastiness is there in back as well. M-Pretty smooth and rich. For the number of streams of bubbles on this beer, there is very little carbonation bite. This is how I dig 'em. D- Dangerously quaffable. Now I know why people talk about this one so much.

610,2751,adamette,3.46,"Poured from a 22 oz. bomber into my Cooperstown Beverage Trail pint glass. Purchased a few months ago at Giant Eagle in Painesville, Ohio. The second of 4 Bear Republic beers that I bought a bomber of and will be drinking and rating this week.  A Nice orange brown body under a brief but creamy head. Good lacing too. Solid IPA look. 4.0  S Typical grapefruit hops, maybe some malt. One of maybe 30 of these IPAs that all smell the same really. 3.0  T Malt, hops, both with high concentration. Grapefruit and citrus is strong in this one. Reminds me of a Bell's Two Hearted but is more citrusy, more tart. I prefer the Two Hearted for sure but it is in the same genre. 3.5  M Full with big tastes, hops and malt. 4.0  D Maybe a bit above average for the style. 3.5  Notes: I decided a while ago to continue to try all styles but I am really getting bored of IPAs. To me they are too one dimensional and frankly, don't taste good. This one is a solid IPA with big tastes in the genre of Bell's Two Hearted but I am bored.",Bear Republic Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,93
610,2751,Morey,4.03,"This beer pours a cloudy orange color with a decent cream colored head that has some serious clinging action.  Aroma is a fantastic and powerful combination of grapefruit and hops.  Taste is more of the same. A very citrusy, well hopped flavor with lingering bitterness.  Medium mouthfeel.  I could definitely drink quite a few of these, I don't know if I consider it a session ale, but pretty close.  Morey's Bottom Line: VERY similar to Bell's Two Hearted, and I mean VERY similar. Which obviously means that it's darn good.",Bear Republic Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,93
610,2751,Georgiabeer,4.5,"Had this on-tap at the Rogue Public House in San Francisco. A lovely beer that seems to get better with time- or maybe that its really easy to find fresh these days, and this beer is just fantastic fresh. I actually like it better than the Racer X. Pours dark golden with a fine white head that fades to a thin cap and leaves some great lacing. Smells nicely of bitter citrus and pine with just enough malt to keep things balanced. Tastes great when fresh, like this is. Wonderful sappy pine and zingy, bitter citrus, along with some dill herbal notes, and a bracing bitterness throughout. Not watery at all, so there is enough of a malt component to keep the beautiful hops supported. A delicious beer.",Bear Republic Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,93
610,2751,JEdmund,4,"Appearance Sunset orange glow with a healthy head that settles to 1/4"" cap  Smell Citrus and very fruity; nice, big aroma  Taste & Mouthfeel Lots of sharp hoppiness throughout; seems to start off with piney hops but then more citrus flavors come in mid-way; the finish is of caramel sweetness--almost toffeelike with a hint of toasted flavor; medium bodied, velvety texture; the Cascade hops make the beer feel familiar, as many American IPAs use this variety; fairly big beer, so not something I could drink multiples of in one sitting  Overall Racer 5 definitely competes with the best of American IPAs, but for some reason it doesn't seem to stand out. Maybe it's just me from having too many IPAs lately, or maybe there's not enough going on in the recipe to keep me interested. I'd recommend it to anyone, but I don't see it working its way into my regular rotation.",Bear Republic Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,93
610,2751,ocelot2500,4.22,Pours a hazy orange amber color with a rising white head that falls into a ring. Plenty of lacing left on the glass.  Smells of a big dose of citrus and pine hops.  Tastes of the big citrus and pine hops. Also a pale malt presence. A lot less bitter on the finish than I would expect given the nose.  Mouthfeel is a smooth medium body. A good amount of carbonation to keep from being creamy or rough.  This is very drinkable.,Bear Republic Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,93
610,2751,dac0152,4.48,"Pours a nice orange, smaller head than I expected, maybe half inch. Love the lacing with all those hops.  Smells like piney hops, but there is a tint of sweetness peeking through.  Lots of hops up front, followed by a nice sweetness that really leaves no bitter aftertaste to be found. Overall not a huge kick in the face with hops, but that doesn't stop my from enjoying the beer at all. In fact, it tastes pretty heavenly.  Definitely full-bodied beer, but so smooth and nice. Goes down very easy. Hard not to gulp, it just drinks so easily.  Definitely something I'll be picking up again and again, I just wish I could get it in 6-packs. Delicious and a solid IPA.",Bear Republic Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,93
610,2751,akorsak,3.85,"A tumbler glass served at Al's of Hampden.  A: The IPA is an amber orange color, translucent with a small band of head that doesn't lace.  S: The aroma is chocked full of hops, bitter pine primarily. The oily aromas stand out above the malt backbone.  T: Sweet mamma jamma, this is hoppy. Pine is resinous, oily as it coats me mouth. Bitterness is sharp, peppery without the a spicy finish. Underneath the hops, the caramel malts are more than up to the task, balancing out the ale with a bready body. The hops din't stay silenced for long though, returning to leave a sharp flavor on the tongue.  M: A heavily hopped IPA that seems too strong at times. A little more balance never hurts anyone.

610,2751,Daniellobo,4.1,"Great US strong IPA with a sturdy hoppy backbone.  Presentation: 12 oz bottle. Recognizable racing design mixed with the Bear Republic branding, a bit kitschy and, true, the racing topic does not do it for me. Brief and assertive narrative with some nice brew master notes. Lacks date of bottling or freshness, neither shows IBUs or °Plato, only Alc. (7.0%) Poured into a tulip glass.  A - Nice golden orange color. Starts with a one inch head that turns quickly to a consistent ring on the beer and some traces on the surface. Minimum lacing as it goes down.  S - Dedicated hoppy aroma. Pine and resins predominate over the floral .  T - Hoppy bitter taste with a small sweetness lingering briefly. Quite assertive but nicely balanced.  M - A bit higher than what one typically would call medium bodied with some carbonation. It works great.  D - Very drinkable. Complex but with a sense of sturdy hoppiness that builds its character.

This taste like it is perhaps past its freshness window, but since there is no bottling date I must assume it is meant to taste this way. Very solid and easy to drink, and actually somewhat tasty, but still it appears faded. Mouthfeel is on the full side of medium bodied and very oily.

Smell is more fruitier than I would have imagined a decent hoppy aroma is with hint's of biscuit and toasted malt.  Taste well the nose deceived me it is very bitter a floral tasting. Hoppy oiliness coats the entire mouth then kind of gives you a fruity punch to the palate.Until the aftertaste the hops really work overtime on the palate.  Mouth is light-medium bodied excellent carbonation. Finishes oily and with a heavy sting on the tongue from the hops.  Drink is solid.

610,2751,ABOWMan,4.82,"My mouth is watering in anticipation of tasting this beer. I've poured a small amount in my pint glass from a good height to bring our it's aroma, and it's wonderful. Fruit comes to mind ... orange, and apricot, both really ripe and also pleanty of piney hops.  I can't wait any longer and take a sip and am rewarded with an upfront sweet fruity note, followed by the wonderfully bitter bite of hops. They are in perfect compliment with one another. Not all hops like some of the IPA's out there.  Craving more than a sip, I pour the rest of my bottle into my pint glass and see an ample two fingers of fine bubbled tan head. The ale itself has an orange tint with a little bit of a yeast ""halo"" that develops into a slightly hazy brew. There are signs of uniform lacing around the walls of my glass.  The mouthfeel reminds my a little of a late harvest muscat, thick and full bodied, but not oberbaring or coating on my palate. The flavor lingers sufficiently and reminds me that I need another sip ... or perhaps a good swig better yet. I am not disappointed as the flavor profile keeps reminding me of why I like this beer so much.  If you haven't tried Racer 5 and you like IPA's, I encourage you to crack one open.

T: great at first, with huge hop flavors dominating. Citrusy goodness with the malt barely discernible. Then my palate starts cringing just a tad as the Columbus (bittering?) hops become incredibly overwhelming. I like a hoppy beer, but to have this one flavor really be the one to stand out is a bummer. I want mandarins and grapefruits to linger like the aroma promises, and sadly they just do not. With warmth, there's a small bit of wood and more perfumey, but it's just not doing it for me. M: medium body with medium-high carbonation, which makes those Columbus hops tingle a bit more.

Finishes with sweet malt that quickly gives way to to strong pine resin finish. An extremely well balanced, flavorful Double IPA. Just great with all kinds of food.",Bear Republic Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,93
610,2751,mcbSTL,3.8,"12 oz bottle, 6xer bought for $10 at W&C Place.  A: Copper like the pipe theives stole from our house. Lorraine cheese lacing remained on sides of glass for duration.  S: Didn't expect the significant malt presence here. Hops, sure. More citrus than pine.  T: Very bitter on first swallow. Further along, extreme bitterness slowly giving way to a bit of malt.  M: Just enough alcohol here to designate a big beer.  D: Amount of hops makes drinking a couple of these just perfect.",Bear Republic Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,93
610,2751,JamesS,3.72,"Pours a decent mid-copper color with some good head and lacing, even if it goes away fairly fast. Nice scent, very hoppy with some nice citrus American hops, and enough malt to keep it from being too ""un-sweet."" Good taste, mostly hops, with some malt thickness if not some malt taste. Goes down well.",Bear Republic Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,93
610,2751,Tilley4,4.65,"Picked up a couple of bottles from Jason at Bruisin Ales in Asheville and cracked this one tonight...  Pours a cloudy hazy hoppy looking dull copper with a slowly forming off white head that fades to a small ring... Each swirl renews the head and gives me assurance that is fairly fresh...  Huge pungent citrusy hops blast my sense of smell with this... Big time hops all the way and they're pretty much all citrus....I can't wait to taste this...  Oh, yes... Its pure hoppy deliciousness...very very citrusy and juicy... This is a totally one dimensional hop bomb and that's just the way I like my IPAs...its all I can do to keep from chugging this down so that should tell you something about the taste and drinkability...  Without a doubt, one of the best IPAs that I've ever tried... I'd love to see Bear Republic in TN soon...",Bear Republic Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,93
610,2751,ToddT,4.15,A- Slightly cloudy amber colored beer with a small off white head. Head fades quickly to a ring but is sticky enough to leave lace on the glass.  S- Big nose of grapefruit hops with a slight undertone of sweet floral in the background.  T- Nice bite of grapefruit up front not overly bitter. Mellowing sweetness comes in at the middle and balances out the taste. Think breakfast grapefruit with sugar poured on top of it. Pretty straight forward not too complex.  M- Medium in body and nicely carbonated. Finish is relatively clean with a little oily hop residue left at the end.  D- Easy drinking west coast IPA. The 7.0% ABV doesn't show through anywhere.  Nice refreshing IPA and very well balanced.,Bear Republic Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,93

610,2751,wnh,3.95,"12 oz. bottle poured into a pint glass.  Pours a slightly hazy copper with a small-ish, short-lived light cream head. Floral, bitter orange, and grassy hop aromas dominate the nose. Light, bitter orange on the palate, balanced quite well by the malt presence, followed by a lightly bitter finish of moderate length.  Good enough, but lacks the depth and intensity of flavor as other IPAs in this price category. Solid and inoffensive, but a beer I'd be quite content to do without.",Bear Republic Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,93
610,2751,McDiddyPop,4.25,"12oz bottle picked up for me at Chevy Chase Wine & Spirits, Washington, DC. Poured into my Stone IPA stemware.  This one pours a bright golden color with perfect clarity. Two fingers of thick off-white head rise quickly with the pour. As it slowly settles, a dense ring of lace forms. This will happen with each sip. The rocky head slowly dwindles to a quarter inch of foam.  Like a good West Coast IPA, this one smells very citrusy. Lots of grapefruit. A bit of peach or apricot in the nose as well. A slightly minty aroma pushes through in the back end. I would love to see what this beer has in store fresh from the brewery, because the bottle I got is smelling wonderful.  Tastes just like it smells. A full-frontal hop assault hits the palate right off the bat. Then an amazingly well-balanced malt sweetness rounds the whole thing out. There's that peach I was smelling. This is a damn good beer.  Mouthfeel is pretty well spot-on. Maybe a bit more prickly than I would ask for, but it doesn't do anything to hurt the drinkability. Without any alcohol making its presence known, I know that this would be dangerous if it were regularly available. Good job, Bear Republic.",Bear Republic Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,93
610,2751,BARFLYB,4.1,"12oz fresh bottle poured into a regular kitchen glass. I seem to be revisiting alot of Bear Republic products this company, they do good work.  A- Racer 5 has a light golden color with some sediment seen in suspension. A nice frothy white head with small bubbles within rose up to an inch than faded into nothing, Light lacing on the top of the glass.  S- Big burst of citrus hops giving off the usual characteristics. This is backed by some malt, some bread and even lighter caramel which is a nice change.  T- A damn fine IPA, pretty balanced to, although my bottle is about a month old, so Im assuming the hops have faded just a bit. Some grass taste in the middle followed by a nice malt kick but that is light as well. A small earthy aftertaste, not so bitter.  M&D- Below medium bodied with light carbonation as well, but it is felt on the mouth. Kind of a slick feel going down. Not sessionable at 7%, but who cares, this is good stuff and a sixer would not be a problem in the course of a day.",Bear Republic Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,93
610,2751,montageman,4.85,"Poured into a Schlitz chalice.  Can't get this beer in Michigan, so I'm kicking myself for not getting more of it when I was recently in Toledo. This is a powerful IPA. Huge bitter hop kick in the pants - relentless. Not balanced, but that's OK. It's all about the hops. Not something I could drink all of the time, but definitely one I'd love to have in my normal rotation. Highly recommended.",Bear Republic Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,93

A-Pours a deep golden, almost orange color with a one finger, off-white head with average retention and modest lacing. Beautiful in appearance. A gorgeous beer.  S-Very pronounced juicy citrus hops. Grapefruit is most prominent. I love the smell of this beer.  T-Very, very balanced, IMO. Hops are aggressive without being overpowering. Nice malt backbone in finish is pleasantly sweet. Atypical for a West Coast IPA. Very distinctive and a real treat. This beer may cause me to change my favorite style. No bitter after taste and alcohol taste is absent, even at 7% ABV. Extremely well crafted.  M-Very smooth and extremely well balanced, yet complex.  D-A great IPA. May be my favorite beer. Dangerously smooth given ABV. I'm satisfied sipping this beer, but if I am especially thirsty on a hot summer day, I can readily down this in big swallows.  This is my go-to IPA. I can buy this for $1.69 a 12oz single year round. When in Northern California for vacation earlier this month, I bought a half-case of 12oz bottles for $15.99. An exceptional value! Especially compared to Stone and Russian River offerings. I am stingy when giving praise, but this beer garners top scores across the board for me. I like variety, but if this was the only beer I was permitted to drink, I would not be an unhappy camper.",Bear Republic Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,93

Really, really good.  Really well balanced with a not overpowering bitterness which is at a good level with lots of candy like mandarin, passionfruit and citrus sweetness. A good sweet malt bill also holds up well here. Really good and one of the best IPAs I've had.  Good full body with average carbonation holds the flavours up well here.

Pours into a nonic a golden orange with fluffy one and a half fingers of cream colored suds.  Smells wonderful. Huge pineapple smell up front. Sweet citrusy hops. Some caramel and toffee.  Starts off with sweet candied pineapple followed by a crisp hop bite. The hops are bright and citrusy sweet. Sweet and bitter hops linger in the aftertaste.  About medium bodied. The carbonation lends a slightly creamy texture. Nice and smooth.  I could enjoy this all night long. I can't imagine how much better this would be fresh. This is definitely going in my top ten beers. One of the best IPA's I've ever had. Will definitely be seeking this one out again.,Bear Republic Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,93
610,2751,LieutenantWort,4.05,"A: Poured from a 22oz bomber into an imperial pint glass. Color is a light, coppery amber, slightly cloudy. Very little head.  S: Really nice nose. Usually I'm pretty bad at differentiating citrus variants, but I have to agree with the other reviewers that there's a definite, specific grapefruit aroma here. Also maybe a tiny bit of lemon and pine.  T: Very nice. Initially both hoppy and fruity at the same time, with wheaty, grassy notes as well. Slightly bitter finish and aftertaste. My palate adapted really quickly to this one, though (maybe it was all those deep inhalations trying to pinpoint the nose?), and by the fifth or sixth sip it was basically a smooth hop delivery system.  M: Also good. Smooth without being creamy. Carbonation is very subtle (which I guess explains the minimal head), makes for a highly drinkable brew.  Overall this beer reminds me a lot of the fabulous Stone Ruination IPA. It's a little less complex and more straightforward in its flavor profile, but both beers have a terrific fruity nose and sustained drinkability despite their hoppiness. I'll think of this as Ruination's little brother, which is quite a compliment.",Bear Republic Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,93

610,2751,whynot44,4.1,"Clear apricot gold color with some hints of pink and a decent foamy white head that lingers and produces some ice lacing.  The aroma is Grapefruit and crushed pine needles with just a hint of malt.  The taste is similar starting with a kick of grapefruit, then light bready caramel malt, finishing dry and piney with a lingering pine aftertaste that somehow makes you want more. Seriously hoppy, not for the faint hearted light beer fan.  Light/medium bodied, nicely smooth, crisp and refreshing, nicely drinkable. Definitely worth a try for the hop heads out there.",Bear Republic Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,93
610,2751,brokensail,4.3,"A: A beautiful golden color and lots of lacing.  S: Tons of citrus hops, some pine, great balance with the malt, though.  T: Very similar to the nose. The grapefruit and floral flavors from the hops are great, and there is a very present bitterness. Not quite as malty as the scents might indicate.  M: Good medium body, and no unpleasant bitter aftertaste.  D: A great IPA that you could drink all day.",Bear Republic Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,93

Actually one of the best balanced IPA's I have had. M/D: A medium body and carbonation. A good creaminess as well. An easy beer to drink. One of the few IPA's I can session.  This is a great IPA.

The smell is a bit hoppy with some nice cirus hop flavor. Some nice slight caramel feel and a bit of pale malt in the background.  The taste is a nice hoppy poke at the beginning with some nice malt flavor rounding out the flavor and evening out the taste. Some nice hints of citrus and some floral hop. The malt flavor is also presented pretty nicely here as well.  The feel of the beer is a nice crisp taste. A bit sharp at first but not overpowering.

Lighter than expected orangish yellow with a nice puff head that lingers and laces.  Overwhelming (in a good way) citrus hop aroma. Distinctly grapefruit and a slight pine note. The taste is a lot more hop than malt but both are very apparent. The word that always comes to mind is fresh.  It is crisper than you'd imagine a 7% beer to be.  This is a bold beer but remarkably drinkable.  I am not a huge hophead - or should I say I wasn't before Racer 5.

610,2751,argock,4.23,"Poured from 12oz brown bottle into a clear pint glass. No freshness date. Purchased as 6-pack at Wine Warehouse (Charlottesville, VA) for $11.99.  A: Soft hazy peach-amber with slightly off-white, 1-2 finger rock head with good retention and substantial lacing.  S: Crystal and caramel pale malts are bigger than expected in the nose, but floral and citrus hops do lead the way.  T: I did not appreciate the huge maltload of this beer with the on-tap version. Crystal and caramel malts are abundant, and the floral hops have their work cut out for them to overcome. The C-type hops eventually do win out witha strong citrus showing, but I would still consider this a ""balanced IPA,"" and a very good one.  M: The feel is exceptional -- coating and crisp all at once with a long, malty but sharp citrus hops aftertaste.  D: An excellent American IPA with huge maltload that screams top-shelf and classic American hopping to create a superb brew. The hits just keep on coming from Bear Republic.

610,2751,longbongsilver,3.96,"Hadn't had an IPA in awhile, why not?  Pours a blurry deep orange, and I immediately smell the hops off it. The white head looks kinda doughy & sticks around quite awhile. In fact, the last inch doesn't even budge until I take a swig. Speaking of which...For as heavily bittered as it is, it's got a really clean taste to it, nothing sticks out too far, maybe a hint of something that makes me think of butterscotch & yeast. Virtually no malt I can discern.  As far as drinkability goes, it reminds me of a good ""malt liquor"" oddly enough. Doesn't get annoying at all, though keep in mind the hop strength. Overall it's a nice casual IPA, the most session-worthy one I've had thus far.",Bear Republic Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,93
610,2751,brianjay,4.53,"Poured into tall glass... A crisp, glowing gold with a light brown hue, topped with a white lace which splashed around the glass, hanging on the sides, and slowly sliding down; low carbonation, just enough to keep it lively. Notes are simple and complex: the subtle, earthy hops scent in front of a quiet biscuit malt. This combination also makes its way onto the tongue. The natural, pine and floral (with some bitterness) of the hops take over however. The bread flavor of the malt hangs around, only to be slowly washed away by the hops, whose dry, tart finish left me wanting more. Easy and smooth in the mouth, yet exciting and invigorating the taste buds. Everything balances out perfectly in this IPA.",Bear Republic Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,93

A= Cloudy at first, but generally translucent orange-brown, thin white head at first that left a thin ring and ringed lacing throughout.  S= Floral and citrusy, but with a unique dried strawberry note in front.  T= Very pleasantly tart. A very sharp citrus peel hits the tongue at first and mellows slightly through. The most prominent flavor is a refreshing floral arrangement of citurs blossoms. Hint of malt sweetness in the aftertaste. Minimal alchohol presence.

610,2751,Oxymoron,4.49,"Crazy fives are alive. Pours a mostly cloudy orange hue color with a light amber almost reddish color. A fizzy white head with good retention and lacing though did hide to the edge of the glass. I did notice that the bottle was a low fill but no apparent off notes.  The nose is distinctly a west coast ipa. Big citrus, pine and grapefruit form the hops. Really dominates and lingers through the tasting and as it warms. Some minor malt notes but very limited. Some caramel and a hint of toffee. Some minor yeast notes but for the most part very clean.  The taste is similar. The hops really come out more on the finishing hops. The citrus note comes out with a good citrus lemon and grapefruit taste. Some minor pine and a lingering pine notes but limited versus the nose. A slight soapy note but no where near as would have expected per such a hop bomb. Some bitterness that lingers into the finish but very subtle. The malt comes out a bit more compared to the nose. Some bready and caramel notes. Would have liked a bit more malt but still good. A very nice beer.  The body is moderate to full. Would like a bit less body but does support the huge hop character. Carbonation is light, could use a touch more to help with bitterness. But overall a fantastic example of a west coast ipa.",Bear Republic Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,93
610,2751,BDLbrewster,4,"Pours a slightly hazy blood orange hued amber with tons of visible carbonation. Large pillow like head that has amazing retention.  Smells heavily of pink grapefruit and fresh citrus peel. The malts are subtle and pushed to the back, what I can pick up is sweet like toffee. Smells very fresh and good.  Taste is sweet and bready and lightly toasted on the front, the malt profile is awesome. Then the hops rear their head, big west coaster here. Grapefruit peel with no pithy bitterness yet, the flavor then morphs into a light pine resin that supports an ample amount of bitterness.  Mouthfeel is good, enough carbonation to keep it from feeling too syrupy. Light-medium bodied and super refreshing.  Drinkability is fantastic! Big IPA, 7%, tastes great.

I get the sweet malty background but the hops are much more, I wouldn't say this very balance but it is delicious M - Medium body, not much carbonation.

Piney hops on the nose, but not overwhelming, certainly leaves room for a slight malty sweetness.  Crisp citrus hops right up front strike the tongue an instant before piney bittering hops take over. A very faint fruity malt flavour lingers behind all the hops. Beer leaves a lasting bitterness on the back of the tongue and sort of numbs the mouth.  Nice smooth body with wonderfully understated carbonation. A good beer, fits the style to a T.",Bear Republic Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,93

Lacing was good and carbonation was plentiful.  S: Smells like big time grapefruit aromas and oily hops.  T: Taste emulates the smell quite accurately. Some lightly toasted caramel and even wheat flavor lend way to the rush of bittersweet stinging hops. Lots of herbacious, floal and citrusy hops, Racer 5 stings the palate with it's sweetened bitterness.  M: Mouthfeel is light-medium, but is still pretty slick along the mid-palate. Hops linger quite a while.  D: Holy crow, this is a strong tasting IPA! At 7% ABV and with a hop profile like this, it'd be tough to session this, but great to have one or two with a meal.

Really big aroma of fresh hops. Taste has very pleasant piney citrusy earthy hops from beginning to finish. Nice background sweetness provides some balance. Some bitterness but not as much as some other IPAs. This beer is full bodied and lightly carbonated which suits it well. Very easy to drink would be a (dangerously) good session beer.

610,2751,Ralphus,3.85,"I received this beer as part of a trade recently. It's my first Bear Republic beer. I visited the companies website hoping to determine why it's called Racer 5 - but it's not mentioned that I could see. Anyway, on with the review.  Pours a crystal clear copper color with a tame slightly off-white head. It dissapates quickly to a small blanket of foam but it does leave some spider lacing down the glass as it goes down. Carbonation is very small.  The smell is surprisingly light. If you didn't know this was an IPA ahead of time I'd be interested to know if you could pinpoint the style. There is some light sweetness mixed with hoppyness but it's not very strong.  The taste is well done. Caramel like sweetness and some fruity notes are present initially and then it transitions well to a balanced and bitter finish. It's not over the top and you can still appreciate the complexities in the beer. Pine and citrus notes are present in the finish.  Mouthfeel is smooth with a slight prickle from the carbonation. Drinkability is higher than average.. you could put a few of these away without feeling you like you were sucking on a pine cone!

610,2751,JAA,4.36,"Thanks to BlueOkie for this one.  A rich gold hue with white one-finger head, laces astonishingly well. Looks like a good beer.  odors are relatively weak until it opens up a little. What does peak through is a sweet citrus character, perhaps oranges and a bit of pineapple. The hops aren't all that present in the nose. Juicy fruit chewing gum.  Taste is definitely grapefruit and pineapple along with piney hop characteristic. Both the smell and taste open up as it warms, drink this one slowly. The bitter hops subside with time and the juicyness dominates everything, even the finish.  Mouthfeel is quite smooth until you swallow. bitterness attacks, but it eases up with the rise of the temperature.  A very nice IPA. Very easy to drink. You don't want to stop sipping. But it gets so much better when it warms, so serve at the proper temperature. Damn, i shouldn't have given the other half of the bomber to my girlfriend.

I got this because of Beer Advocate, and honestly because of the label was hesitant to buy it. The reason I did buy it was because I was doing a beer run anyway and it is honestly pretty hard to mess up a IPA for me.  So the appearance was a nice golden color that is something that you come to expect from this style. It was all in the taste and smell that floored me. I gave it a 4 for smell because without the taste it would be lower, if that makes any sense. The taste and smell have exactly the same characteristics. They compliment each other so well it was amazing. The mouthfeel is high as well as drinkability because I could seriously have a few of these brews. I finished one bomber and wanted another really bad. This is seriously a unique and amazing brew that I just loved. I highly recommend.

Color is a clouded deep orange amber with very fine suspended sediment.  Nose- Orange zest, ruby red grapefruit, and some very light biscuit.  Taste- Very nice. Smooth at first with lots of vibrant bright citric hops. Orange and grapefruit are very prominent. Some light biscuit notes, although just a hint. I wouldn't go so far as to call this balanced, but it is meatier then quite a few IPAs that I have had. Finish is very, very long and substantially bitter.  Mouthfeel- Active, acrid and tangy.  Drinkability- Great.",Bear Republic Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,93
610,2751,blackc5,3.83,"Had this on tap during a local happy hour.  A - Pours a quite dark (for an IPA) reddish amber, pretty cloudy, with minimal head (served with almost none, but I gave it a good swirld) and respectable lacing.  S - Very, very faint actually. The one area this beer disappointed, as I really had to inhale strongly to even catch a whiff of anything at all.  T - I wasn't expecting too much given the aromas (not) coming off, but it actually tasted quite good. It was a mild IPA hop-wise, but had a very nice balance of different hop flavors, with no particular aspect overpowering the others. Some caramel malts there as well that matched up great with the balanced floral, citrus and earthy hops. Pretty mild bitterness, but just enough in the aftertaste. Overall, quite good.  M - Slightly on the watery side for me, but it still had a nice level of carbonation and bitterness.  D - The beer shines here - it could easily be made sessionable despite the ABV.",Bear Republic Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,93
610,2751,charlieos,3.7,"I found this beer hard to approach the first time I tried it. The second time, after warming up with a lighter beer, I found it much more enjoyable. Very nice hop flavor range. Balance is very much on the sweeter side. Pours an orangish color with minimal head. As pretty serious hoppy beers go, this one is on the heavier, maybe even clunkier side. More of a beer for the dedicated ipa person than a generalist.  In all a good beer, but a forceful beer.",Bear Republic Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,93

S: A sweet, citrus smell with some hop and alcohol notes as well.  T: A bitter, hoppy, earthy taste with some sweet, grapefruit and citrus notes to balance. A nice, balanced IPA that was quite tasty. Some more earthiness was also noted in the aftertaste.  M: A medium-bodied beer with a pretty smooth mouthfeel on the palette. Nice for the style.

The smell is very hoppy with big notes of citrus and lesser of pine. It's not without some malt as I get a bit of caramel sneaking in as well as an earthiness.  The taste has a good grapefruit bitterness with some earthy tones which I'm not all that fond of, a light touch of pine, but not much of any sweet malt. This is pretty bitter....I don't remember it being this bitter from the times I had in the past, which must be a few years now. Oh well. It's still pretty good with the flavour.  Fairly light bodied, it has medium carbonation and finishes decidedly bitter with a long lasting aftertaste.  Drinkability? For me, it drinks stronger than the 7%abv it carries and the flavours don't tickle my fancy that much so....it will probably be a while before I revisit this brew.",Bear Republic Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,93

Poured a lovely orange/yellow with a thin white head that left lots of sticky lacin  Crisp citrus hops greet the nose, and the flavors are very similar. I didn't find this IPA to be as good as BRs Hop Rod Rye.  The body was solid, which gave the hops something to cling to, a pleasant change from most thin west coast IPAs.

610,2751,nc41,4.35,"This brew just affirms the goodness of everything Bear Republic makes at a terrific price. This was my second bomber and if you like IPA's there is no way not to like this brew. Pours nice, looks great, holds a nice head, nice lacing, about what you expect from a quality IPA. The taste is really where it's at and this one is a smack of hops on the tongue, but also feels light and refreshing in the mouth. I wouldn't call this one fruity, but it's definitely not sticky and overly piny tasting either. A really solid IPA that is dangerously drinkable, and the 7% ABV is perfect for the style. I wish I could get it in 12 oz bottles instead of bombers, but I'd very easily buy this one again, and it would be case worthy if I could get it.  Edit: I can and I did. Just an outstanding IPA in a world being driven by DIPA's. Modus, Racer 5, = the best everyday IPA's out there.

A nice layer of lacing is playing from head to toe on the tulip.  Smell: If I am reviewing an IPA from a pour from a bottle, I usually smell the cap once I take it off as a test to see if it's going to live up to its expectations. Once I got it into my tulip glass my assumption was correct. A very nice hop aroma from the Racer 5. A nice blend of malt, earthy and citrus hops. The smell of this beer is spot on.  Taste: Not as strong of a citrusy flavor as I was expecting. Starts out with a biscuit malt flavor, then moves into a mixture of citrus hops and earthy hops. Not a very strong citrus flavor until the aftertaste in which a grapefruit flavor presents itself.  Mouthfeel: A well put together beer. A nice amount of hop oils cover my mouth.  Drinkability: I could see myself having one or two of these in a night.

Nothing bitter extreme or offensive about it. Decent but for an ipa I think it should bite back a little more. M= very nice creamy and a little dry in the finish. D= great.

610,2751,CortexBomb,4.12,"This was a wonderful find that I made the last time I was in Pittsburgh. Fathead's had this on the hand pull and I had to give it a try. The pour was textbook IPA with big lacing. Nose is strong, floral with hints of grapefruit.  The flavour on this was perfect though, this is the kind of balanced IPA that I love, it has a huge grassy floral flavour from the hops that were used, but is is also balanced back by a strong malt presence. The hops are always there and you know you're drinking an IPA, but it's not completely out of balance like so many brews in this style are. The warmer temperature of the cask likely improved the depth, of course.  Mouth and drinkability both solid, I could have a few of these, decent bitters but not remarkable, it's not a gargantuan beer in your mouth, but it does its job.  Bottom line: I'd never even heard of this brewery, but I try almost anything that is put on a hand pull.

I drank one and then another on tap and then I bought a 22oz. bottle the next day to try. I'll try to update after I get into that.

My descriptive leads me to clarify my opening...Racer 5 looks like your average West Coast IPA. It's like the liquid can tell you it shared ground with palm trees, oranges, and grapefruit.  I've written before about the extent to which these kinds of beers can smell like Pine-Sol--there's the chemical, artificial characteristics vs. the woody, citric pine notes distinctive of west coast hop bombs. This one, unfortunately, leans more toward the former. It's like so citrusy that it smells amost sour.  My initial reaction is that this beer is overly malted. It makes me wonder if the beer is fresh. I struggle to find anything persuasive enough to justify a good or better rating. Right in line with my appearance assessment, this tastes like an average West Coast IPA. It's good enough to enjoy--even on a relatively often basis--but it's never going to be the best IPA available.  The mouthfeel is the same as everything else--it's lower-case good. You taste and feel a West Coast IPA. The problem, however, is nothing distinguishes itself.

Smells like citrus hops - primarily grapefruit and orange, maybe some pinapple. Citrusy hops dominate the taste too. Bitterness is about optimal - not palate-assaulting, but you know it's an ipa. The sweet, biscuity malt that pairs with the hops really makes for a wonderful balance. or at least as much balance as you would want in an ipa. medium bodied, medium carbonation, creamy mouthfeel.

610,2751,drtth,4.5,"Served in a standard shaker/pint glass. Glass of cold water on the side to sip from periodically.  Appearance: The beer is a dark burnished gold color with a 1/8"" white head that recedes fairly soon leaving a small ring around the glass and a patch of foam on the surface of the liquid. Sipping leaves behind some nice lightly speckled lacing after sipping.  Smell: The aroma is soft, fruity and floral. The fruit is definitely and strongly grapefruit and that is the strongest part of the aroma. The background components of the aroma are floral in character and make the aroma more complex but no more intense.  Taste: The flavor is predominantly grapefruit, which is fine with me as I like grapefrut flavor. There is a floral character to the flavor as well and then up pops a lightly caramel malt sweetness to counter point the bitter flavor of the grapefuit.  Mouthfeel: The mouthfeel is medium bodied with reasonably good carbonation. The finish is medium long and begins with the malt sweetness and then tapers off into the more bitter portion of grapefruit flavor and ends on that bitter dry note.  Drinkability: I could happily drink more than one of these. (In fact I've done so at least twice in the last week during happy hour.) I'll most certainly be returning to this beer.

Active carbonation can be seen as the bubbles rise to the top.  Hints of grapefruit, honey, lemons, citrus smell which is standard for the style. I also get that caramel malt smell with some bread/biscuit.  Upfront hop bitter taste that is combined with a citrus flavor. This mellows out and the caramel malt kicks in to sort of balance it out which does for a quick second until the hops come back into play and leave you with a crisp, bitter finish. As the beer warms a nice floral note is added to this complex beer. Superb!!!!  Medium bodied with high amounts of carbonation(which is good for this beer IMO). Nice crisp slightly sweet bitter aftertaste.  If these were in 12 oz bottles(I have not looked into it)I could throw back a few of these cause its superb in flavor.

Mmm mmmm....very nice taste. I had heard that this was one of the more bitter IPAs as far as hops. I didn't find it the bitterest but I did find that it was very balanced. Very nice hop bitterness at the forefront balanced with an underlying malt character. Bitter character stays to the end like a nice spice but doesn't punch you in the face.  Mouthfeel was definitely in keeping with a high ABV IPA. Thicker and you could feel the higher ABV even if you couldn't taste it.  Drinkability would only be hindered by the fact that every time I drink this I would need a glass. This is a bottle conditioned beer and thus it has some yeast leftovers in the bottle that I prefer to drink.

It takes some effort to get and head on the pour but stright into the glass seems to work. It's creamy white goodness - nice and sticky.  Aroma is heavenly with lots of great citrus. Sugar crusted orange zest, lemon, and grapefruit all come through. It smells like a perfect IPA.  Taste is seriously hoppy but not overly bitter. It has a great sweetness initially but then the resiny hops come in with lots of pine and citrus. The malts are there to keep it all in check but this really is a showcase of hops all the way. I sense a bit of honey sweetness but it never gets in the way. If anything, it enhances the beer.  Mouthfeel is smooth but between the full body and the massive hops it comes across almost sticky. Carbonation isn't too high and it goes down with just a bit of burn.  Overall this is just a great IPA. Nothing but great things from start to finish.

Complex hop aroma, but not potent - citrus with a little grassy earthiness that comes out more when you swirl it. A little biscuity malt, but sweet-smelling. Nice balance, not a puckering bitterness, but not syrupy sweet, but the hops still get to shine. A touch of white pepper spiciness, with grassy, citrus hops that lean toward sugar dusted grapefruit flavors. I'm pretty sure there are definitely some Amarillo in there. Malt is sweet caramel that never gets in the way of the hop show. Finishes with some bitterness, but right in the middle of the dry-sweet spectrum.

Malt backbone on the flavor is just barely holding up. Hope are strong, but not over powering. It seems they serve to up the abv and preserve the beer...like an IPA is supposed to do.

A bready malt backbone adds a nice balance to this brew.  Mouthfeel was medium-bodied. Drinkability is great as this beer has a very clean flavor and it is not harsh at all. The alcohol is not present at all.,Bear Republic Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,93
610,2751,melagnus,4.4,"So a quick background on the tasting atmosphere and parameters at the time, since this might have affected my overall view, though doubtful.  Though I have tasted this beer many times before in the bottle and on-tap, this evening started off with a sampling of the beer when it was poured from a keg that was ""on it's way out."" The beer was served in a cooled glass and at probably around 35&#730;F, so there was no doubt some chill haze prevalent.  The second and compared to tasting, was via a freshly tapped keg that was delivered a couple of days prior, therefore I have brought both of these observations into my review.  A - Pale Amber (SRM 9-10) liquid poured into a tall 22 oz. Weißbier-style glass results in a slightly opaque hue that on top forms a thick & foamy white head. The head (2 ½ fingers-thick) seems resinous and leaves behind a tantalizing lacing as the volume recedes, though this occurs very slowly as the head retention is quite impressive! The pour was done in the traditional American-form, which is to pour the beer on the side of the glass at a 45&#730; angle until half-full. Carbonic-bubbles escalate to the top, thereby helping to suspend the head. The combination of the cooled glass and chilled beer made for some chill hazing, though this of course disappeared with warmth.  Note: Second sampling came via a non-chilled 22 oz. Weißbier-style glass and both samples were allowed to warm up to at-or-near proper temps before tasting!  S - Columbus and Cascadian hops plume deep into the nasal cavity, with clean & sweet Pale Ale malt undertones vying for recognition. Alcoholic esters can be sense, though the resinous and floral hops mask this nicely.  Note: Second tasting produced a more fresh floral bouquet of hops that did the first!  T - Cool and refreshing! Slightly grainy substance washes over the palate, while sweet malts coat the palate, leaving a bitter (medium-high hops) crescendo that lingers smoothly for a while thereafter. Possibly a tad nutty, though unsure on this.  Note: Second sampling resulted in a more sweet malty flavor in the foreground, though resinous hops still dominate.  M - Slightly warming at the end (7% ABV), this mouth coating and grainy beer washes over the palate nicely with medium body and an appropriately out of balance bitterness. Sweetness, possibly caramel, does play into the equation though.  C - This beer truly never gets old! Each time I try it I am amazed at how timeless it is. Harpoon IPA, Stone IPA, Standing Stone Brewery (Ashland, OR), Mayflower IPA, Dogfish Head 60 and Lagunitas IPA all brew their own incredible interpretations of the style, though despite other scholarly opinions, I must conclude that I still lean towards this being my all-time favorite IPA. There's just something magical about the mixture of ingredients in this brew and the freshness in the bouquet no doubt plays into this fantasy. Bring me a juicy burger and some sweet potato fries and oh yeah Bartender, ""I'll have another!""  Prost!",Bear Republic Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,93
610,2751,Crack1Open,4.28,"A- Pours a beautiful hazy orange/amber. Fluffy white head that recedes nice and slow leaving good lacing. A little fine sediment at the bottom of bottle.  S- Nice hoppy, floral, piney aromas with a touch of citrus. Also detect some minor malt aromas at various times. Smell delicious.  T- Hoppy bite up front turns to citrusy malt while still maintaining the hop flavors throughout. Definitely floral/piney flavors with initial hops. Finishes a pleasant bitter.  M- A little sharp at first but eases after initial sip. Not too heavy, pretty light. Light carbonation. Dry finish.  D- High drinkability. Could definitely enjoy a couple of these on a nice hot day. Alcohol well hidden. Definitely recommended.  While this may not be the most complex ipa, it still a great straight to the point one and true to the style. Sometimes the simpler the better. Delicious!",Bear Republic Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,93
610,2751,CHickman,4.67,"Poured a gold/copper color with a slight haze and a creamy 2 finger snow white head that fades slowly, leaving good spotty lacing.  Smells of juicy citrus and piney hops, with grapefruit, tangerine, orange peel, lemon zest, pine cones, caramel, brown sugar, toasted grains, floral hops, herbs, light spices and biscuit or cracker; very nice citrus and hoppy notes, with just enough malts and grains for nice balance. The juicy hops jump out and make a statement, but overall the aroma is spot on and very nice for an IPA. Typical West Coast nose that is quite enjoyable.  Taste starts out sweet with the citrus and floral hop taste and smell, followed by a slight spicy hop flavor with piney hops, citrus hops and floral hops mixed with malt that trails off bitter with a sweet ending that brings out more hops and grapefruit, lemon zest, tangerine, orange peel, pine cones, caramel, brown sugar, toasted grains, biscuit, herbs, spices like pepper and coriander, perhaps even some light cinnamon. This beer works well and is very balanced considering the mix of hop flavors that bombard the senses up front. The flavor has a lot more malt and balance than the nose, and it's very tasty and extremely easy to drink. There is just enough sweet malt, biscuity grains and brown sugar or caramel to even out the taste. There is some lingering mango and coriander that coats the tongue after each swallow, leaving a refreshing feeling. A definite session beer for me, this flows down so easy that the whole bomber was gone in a flash.  Mouthfeel is creamy, smooth and almost oily slick, with a medium chewy feel, very light and almost watery carbonation, with a bitter dry finish, yet the hop combo helps it go down smooth.  Overall a great beer that's packed with flavor and balanced by the slight sweetness, not letting that 7% ABV hit you until then end of the bottle. Each sip got better and brought out more flavor. A great beer on its own or mixed with food, this slides down easy like a fine beer should. A great beer that is steady, always enjoyable, complex and full of flavor; a top notch IPA that is one of the standards for any hophead.",Bear Republic Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,93

610,2751,matt062286,4.23,"Appearance - Golden copper with a smallish white head. Minimal lacing.  Smell - Very citrus-y, fruity hops. Almost floral in ways. Definitely what you would expect from an IPA.  Taste - Very much like it smells, a very sweet and flavorful IPA. Reminds me of Sierra Nevada Pale Ale, probably since similar hops are used, but this one is less bitter.  Mouthfeel - Very smooth, but not watery, and a good amount of carbonation here as well.  Drinkability - A perfect session beer for a warm summer day in my opinion. Pretty good ABV and a smooth flavor make for a good combination. Will look forward to having this one again.",Bear Republic Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,93
610,2751,stockingcpl,3.94,"Appearance: This is a bottle conditioned brew that has a HEAVY layer of sediment. Keep this in mind when serving. Head is minimal to non-existent. Carbonation threads are not observed. Color is a nice deep honey. Clarity is high (if sediment is left in bottle). Not overly impressive.  Smell: There is a huge aroma. The hop basis behind this selection is evident even when pouring this brew. Hop-heads will love the aroma. I detected aromatic hops in addition to bittering hops. Malt detected but mild due to heavy hop presence.  Taste: Flavor curve is moderate in length. There is an initial hop and carbonation bite that tapers slowly. Hop bitterness is infused during the totality of the curve. I liked the hop presence. The design did not rely upon sheer power, there are some interesting hop flavor interactions that make this quite an interesting IPA.  Mouthfeel: Nice carbonation bite. Hop bitterness is aggressive but not cloying. Interesting overall impression. An experienced drinker will appreciate the blended hops.  Drinkability: This selection is heavy in flavor but is not heavy on the stomache. I found that after a single selection, the palate was exhausted due to the hop flavor. However, this is not unusual for an IPA. Overall this is a great brew that would match well with big flavored food.  Prosit!

ORANGE Ale?!?!? Very little head, probably because I poured very slowly. Orange beer, it looks amazing!  S= hit in the face with huge aroma from a foot away! Amazing. A complete explosion of hops florals and heaven. Mandarin orange. It's literally like getting hit in the head with a floral-hops hammer. After a few minutes this very nice strong scent of bready malts came through, as well.  T= following the Smell, the Taste is ALL THERE. Florals, Mandarin orange, nice hops bitters but perfectly balanced; sweet malts, fruity traits, various come-and-go hints of various candied fruits galore.  M= clean, with slight dryness and light bitters, more fruit and florals than after you eat an apple or an orange or maybe a fresh combo-fruit salad. Lots to savor. I feel like I just ate a fresh tropical fruit breakfast bowl of apple, orange, papaya, mango and grapefruit, topped with shaved coconut. Whoaaah....  D= Bear Republic states that they do everything, huge. And thus they have. However, expect a 6-pack of 12oz bottles to cost you about US$2 more than most other micro's.

Standard for the style.  Taste is full of floral hop bitterness upfront with a strong alcohol warmth and not much else showing up in the middle. Bready, biscuity flavors do make an appearance though.  Mouthfeel is full of lingering hops and malt and alcohol warmth. I'm not sure what the floaties are but they don't seem to affect the taste much as I can tell.  Not bad but it would probably be better fresh. Again, it's a case of me not reading the bottling date before buying. Still a decent IPA though.",Bear Republic Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,93

Poured a translucent copper with a half inch bright white head consisting of a layer of tiny, compressed bubbles. Head eventually settles into a thin, fairly consistent cap. Delicate waves of lacing were revealed during the course of the tasting. Nose consists predominantly of grapefruit notes with some light, floral aromas. Taste follows nose, but a nice malt/hops balance comes out in the mouth - some sweetness up front, with a light kiss of hops bittering at the finish. Mouthfeel is between light- and medium-bodied and mildly effervescent.

A-Slightly veiled apricot with a creamy eggshell head that settles rapidly with some decent attractive lacing.  S-Pungent, delicious perfumey citrus hops, with a whiff of malt.  T-Sweet malts balanced by floral and citrus hops with a nice drying hop twang on the back end. Remarkably well balanced in every way. This is one hell of a nice tasting brew, and could very well be the best tasting IPA I have ever had. I keep debating whether to give this a 4.5 or a 5 on the taste, but the 5 wins out due to the sheer balance of this beer. You must hand it to Bear to not to make the IBU's steal the show here.  M-Medium, but slightly chewy, well balanced carbonation and mouthfeel.  D-This is a very drinkable beer. Big flavor without the big ABV. My ""go to"" IPA, session brew, cooler filler.

Huge citrus hops in the nose and a slight floral-perfume smell. I caught a little apricot in there, too.  Pungent citrus hops... grapefruit and orange. The transition to the malt is flawless. It's a nice balance and the malt knows it's place and is very submissive to the bittering effect of the hops. Delicious.  Full body and crisp, clean carbonation. Very fresh tasting.

Head was bubbly but thin, off-white in color, and had good retention with decent lacing on the glass. Aroma was terrific - hop presence of pine and citrus, with hints of caramel malt. Tastes were mild caramel malt followed with strong earthy pine and citrus. Seemed to lack complexity, but is well balanced with a bitter, lingering hop finish.

The flavor, however, was earthy and grassy. I've never experienced such a contrast from smell to taste. Both were wonderful, yet not alike. The best beers get better as they get less cold and the taste of Racer 5 got more complex, more layered, and more better as I eased through the glass.

Nice lace coats the glass above the slightly hazy golden-yellow beer though.  S - A fantastic floral and citrusy American hop bouquet erupts from this beer. Notes of resiny pine, grapefruit, and even hints of orange peel come out. Malty backbone supports the hops nicely.  T - A big smack of hops hits the tongue instantly. It's predominantly resin-flavored but grapefruit is big too. A laid-back malt profile doesn't really show it's face but still provides a fantastic backbone for the hearty hops. The resin almost becomes slightly plastic-resin like though.  M - Medium-bodied and smooth initially with a nicely balanced carbonation level and an even better balanced semi-strong bitter finish.

Not a bad color, sort of a light orange. Looks like an ipa.  Smells pretty good, some citrus and fruit hops coming through. Not real intense but some nice smells going on.  Kind of basic, light mouthfeel, pretty bitter hops in the middle and the finish, a little sweetness in the front. Hops are just nice and bitter, not really any fruit coming through and the malt shows up a little in the beginning but is quickly overpowered by the hops. Not an intense bitterness but kind of subdued, just enough to please a hophead but not enough to turn on someone who doesn't normally drink an ipa.no alcohol to speak of.  Kind of nice, maybe light to medium. Hops leave that bitterness on your tongue for a while but nothing cloying.

This beer leaves a really good level of bitterness.  M-Medium bodied with a light level of carbonation that works well for the beer.  D-The 7% is extremely well hidden and all those hops along with the fact that it is not sweet mean it is highly drinkable.  A great beer that can meet my hop demands and it is easily available.Along with SNPA, this has been my old standby for years when out at local restaurants and/or pubs with limited beer menus.",Bear Republic Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,93
610,2751,steelerguy,4.37,"A - Pours golden with a 1 finger off white head. Head fades quickly leaving lacing on top. Lightly carbonated and quite clear, with heavy lacing as I drank.  S - Sweet malt and floral hops. If there were a such thing as a beer flower, this is how it would smell.  T - Sweet caramel malt taste, some unfermented sugars, balanced very well by the floral hop bitterness. Can definitely pick up some alcohol in there, but in a good way, lets you know this beer is packing. I would have guessed this beer to be a DIPA considering the strong malt backbone and hop counter punch.  M - Thicker than expecting, not heavily attenuated. Feels like a bigger beer than a regular IPA.  D - This is a beer to sit down and savor. Enjoy one or two, but it got a bit tiring as I drank more. This is called an IPA, but felt like a DIPA to me and because of that it is only so drinkable even though it is quite good.",Bear Republic Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,93
610,2751,jizdepski,4.15,"poured from tap into an imperial pint glass. appears a golden orange with a very nice looking thick white head that slowly dissipates, but leaves beautiful webs of sticky, crystaline lacing. smells as advertised, floral hops, herbs (particularly oregano), some grassy notes, slight citrus sweetness. taste follows smell, though it is VERY herbal tasting when it warms; almost in a medicinal way.i have drank this beer several times, and cold and room temp glasses make a big difference here. i think i'd opt for the cold normally, but its just a nitpick. has nice lively hops, some citrus notes, with the alcohol barely noticed. the mouthfeel is medium bodied, not overly carbonated but has a nice zip going on. tasty bitter finish. fairly drinkable. a very interesting and bold (though not traditional) ipa. recommended.",Bear Republic Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,93
610,2751,DNICE555,4.42,"Poured from a 12 oz bottle into an english pint glass. Decent white head with an average amount of carbonation. Hazy grapefruit color. Some nice lacing rings the glass even after I've finished.  This beer smelled very good. Citrusy, tangy, piney hops.  Taste was right on point. Crisp clean hops with some zing to them. Not overly piney and not very bitter.  Medium body with some nice citrusy high notes.  Very drinkable. Just have to be careful of the 7 percent abv that is barley noticeable.",Bear Republic Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,93
610,2751,cavedave,4,"Beautifully clear medium amber with a densely grown thin layer of light beige foam. A swirl of the tulip leaves a clinging gargoyle arm of lace.  The nose is heavenly citrus/pine, sweetest essences, running from from spruce fruit/orange peel to lemon to grapefruit all wrapped in hints of sweet malty goodness that are teasingly and complexly aromatic.  Taste is a bold assault of flavor. Grapefruit leads the attack, passing command of the sip to orange peach lemon pine and herbal florality into a tasty finish. As it warms the floral sweetness and bitterness balance into an even better and longer finish.  Mouthfeel is very good for the style, just shy of overly resinous.  Drinkability is amazingly good, the abv 7% is present only in the mind not on the tongue.",Bear Republic Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,93
610,2751,CMW,4.27,"A - Pours a crystal clear straw yellow color. There is a tall white head that carries good retention throughout. Lacing is also present on the side of the glass.  S - Floral hops dominate the nose, with some slight grapefruit notes.  T - Almost all hops in the taste but it is not overly bitter. Good balance between floral and grapefruit hop flavors. I didn't find this bitter at all.  M - Medium carbonation and on the thinner side.  D - Wow, this goes down easy. I could drink a few of these.",Bear Republic Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,93
610,2751,jdense,3.88,"22 oz. bomber poured in Kapittel chalice.  2 finger lingering white head with nice lacing over slightly opaque amber orange body. Hops are pretty noticeable in the nose but not overwhelming. Spicy hops on the back end of taste balanced by sweetish malt up front. A nice example of NoCal IPA, though my preference runs towards Racer X in terms of complexity and taste. Maybe it's a carbonation issue related to the bottle conditioning, but I'm not having any problems with the yeast. Worth a shot, though definitely better on tap and superlative on cask at the Horse Brass",Bear Republic Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,93
610,2751,ritzkiss,3.96,"22oz bottle pours a light orange, lighter than many good IPAs, with light head that quickly dissipates. Lots of particles at the bottom.  Smell is a bouquet of hops. Grapefruit and citrus dominate with a mix of floral notes with generous dashes of pine. Some malty sweetness, hints of a caramel malt - very nice.  Taste doesn't deliver the complexity that the nose suggests, although this could be because the bottle is a few months old. The hops is there but not vibrant, and the malt doesn't have enough body to impress on its own. It also seems a little under carbonated which makes it feel a little dull. There's still a nice bittering punch on the finish.  Overall, definitely not on par with some of Bear's other offerings, though I am willing to grant it some slack because of the age of the bottle and because it's still a very drinkable brew.",Bear Republic Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,93
610,2751,PhxHorn,4.05,"This one is a medium yellow with a quarter inch of white head. Plenty of lacing on the glass. Smells of grapefruit with some orange thrown in. Solid citrus aroma. Tastes of grapefruit, orange, and some other fruity hints in there. Finishes with a medium bitter aftertaste, but not overwhelming. A good solid IPA, very drinkable. Glad I tried this one at Papago.",Bear Republic Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,93
610,2751,Kadonny,4.35,"Poured from cask into a nonic pint glass at TJs in Paoli.  A: A cloudy golden orange color with a one finger fluffy white head. Nice full glass lacing.  S: Nice citrus hops with some floral and pine notes and a sweet caramel malt smell. Nice and mellow.  T: Hops shine through with hints of citrus, floral, grass and some slight pine. Along side the hops the malt in this really melds in perfectly with caramel sweetness and creamy smoothness. Finish is clean and crisp, but not real bitter.  M: Medium and creamy. No hint of alcohol and of course light carbonation. Not much bitterness either.  D: Unfortunately, very high. These are so creamy smooth and oh so delicious.  This is a great beer from C02, kick that up a notch with the cask conditioning. Simply superb. What a west coast treat that we are lucky to have here in PA. Thanks to Jeff at TJs for bringing in this gem for us to try.",Bear Republic Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,93
610,2751,Wheelinb,4.27,The first thing that attracted me to this beer was the graphics on the tap. A tribute to Speed Racer no doubt. So naturally I ordered a pint and enjoyed the light amber color and the distinct citrus smell. When you taste it you get grapefruit but it is not overly tart or fruity. This has become one of my favorites and I always have it on hand. Everyone I have sampled it with has become a fan as well.,Bear Republic Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,93
610,2751,webbcreative,4.18,"Pours a beautiful deep golden color, with great 3 finger head. smell is ridiculous, the aroma hit my nose before i could even finish pouring the beer. Smells of wonderful clean hops, and hops, and hops, and hops. Taste - Nice big hop flavor of the bat, which sweetness from the malt midway through, then finishing with a nice hop punch in the end, but the bitterness lingers a little but not uncomfortably long, its really nice. Just a bit of biscuit flavor in there also. Mouthfeel is really, really smooth.  Overall, this is an EXCELLENT IPA, would get this one again, and for $5 and some change a pretty good deal also.",Bear Republic Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,93
610,2751,Clydesdale,4.5,"A: Pours a cloudy orange-tan color. The off-white head is large, somewhat thick, and fluffy, with hints of tan color. Retention is excellent, as is lacing.  S: Spicy, fragrant hops in the nose - mostly somewhat sweet citrus. A piney/floral background as well. Some biscuity malt aroma as well.  T: Moderate caramel malt sweetness up front. Quickly followed by a rush of juicy hop flavors. Orange peel and sweet grapefruit, along with an unusual candied floral and piney notes. The hop flavors start off like many other top-notch IPAs, but then they depart into something just a touch different. Bitterness is fairly mild, with some hints of alcohol in the finish.  M: Medium-firm body. Carbonation is tingly and fairly creamy. Very nicely balanced overall, with an especially dry mouthfeel into the finish.  D: For such a big, hoppy IPA, this manages an impressive balance. A nice malt backbone along with some unique hop flavors makes this a very nice beer indeed.",Bear Republic Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,93
610,2751,joshuadlight,3.5,"Poured out of a 22oz bomber into a pint glass. My rather fancy 100 year anniversary Shiner pint glass if you care to know.  First pour was clear, second was cloudy due to the yeast in the bottom of bottle. Small head consisting of tiny bubbles reminiscent of a nitro bottle. I cannot concur with most reviewers of this beer, I just feel that there are too many IPAs that are better than this one. Sure there are citrus notes and carmel notes, but they are a little subdued up next to the bitterness. To me, the test of a truly awesome IPA is whether or not the beautiful flavors that define the style can come through and coexist with the bitterness. Here, I think, the bitterness takes too much of the stage. I want bitterness, don't get me wrong, but I feel there is a perfect medium where IPA flavors live in perfect harmony with bitterness. And this beer doesn't achieve that.  All the while, its still a beer that many enjoy and I agree that it is a well crafted beer. I have my first Hop Rod Rye in the fridge and look forward to trying it soon and I hope it surpasses the Racer. If you are an IPA lover, you do want to get your hands on this. If not, there are better beers out there.",Bear Republic Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,93
610,2751,IronCitySteve,4.25,"A: A copper color with a slight more reddish tinge to it. A small head that quickly disappears.  S: A good amount of citrus hops, mostly grapefruit and orange. Also some detection of pine. There is a slight malt scent as well.  T: A very well put together flavor of hops. At first sip, a good amount of citrus hops, mixed with a little caramel malt. Finishes strong with more hops, mostly pine.  M: A medium body beer, but missing some carbonation.  D: A really good IPA offering. Although a 7% abv, worth having more than one in a sitting!",Bear Republic Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,93
610,2751,brewdoc75,3.68,"Bomber to pint glass. Bottled on 12/12/08.  A: Golden yellow in color. Quite light appearing. Crisp, bubbly white head atop.  S: Not a lot initially, but after it warms up I get a strong grapefruit aroma. Kind of one dimensional, but solid. I do get some faint sweetness from the malts as well.  T: Hoppy bitterness assaults the tongue initially. Once again, the grapefruit component really shines here. For those who like a grapefruity IPA, this is a great example. I do get some other citrus flavors as well, with a hint of tangerine and even some orange. The bitterness is long lasting and reaches to the next drink. The malts are not really there in this beer however. I am longing for a bit more balancing sweetness.  M: Crisp, light, and clean.  D: A pretty solid IPA. Not the best I've had and definitely not a bad one. I tried this after the Hop Rod Rye, which really overshadows this beer. It is worth a try, but there are some others I would drink on a daily basis before this one.",Bear Republic Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,93

And still feel like I could drive a car just fine... not that I would!  - Rather basic copper appearance, nice foamy head that quickly shoots down to a swirl of lacing. Poured into a tumbler.. as usual for me.  - Nice sweet caramel and floral hop scent.. seems well balanced to the nose. Hint of honey in this too?  - Super fine balance in hops and malts here.. sweet caramel, honey.. and a drinkable citrus/pine.. mellow hop complexion.. yet it is an IPA.. I strive for an IIPA with this suit. Tastes a bit stronger than it really is.  - Great floral and warm alcohol afterlash.. enough water to keep going..  - Very drinkable... somewhat bubbly and filling.. but a great strengthy basic IPA. Would buy again.. but there are others that come before it.",Bear Republic Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,93
610,2751,StrangeBrewer76,5,"Pours perfect straw to orange color, a little hazy with textbook head and lacing. Lacing could be reproduced and sold as art for doilies. This could not look better.  Smells of pine and spicy hop that would meet your imaginations expectations of a California IPA.  Taste is amazing. I may be a little biased for having had this before but as a beer geek or BA I tend to gravitate toward the best stuff, which this brew clearly is, hands down. Whatever malt is used in this beer compliments the bitterness profile of the hops so perfectly that the taste transition is seamless.  M- Hop resins top to bottom make this one of the easiest things to drink.  Drinkability is off the charts. This is a 6. When you raise this glass to your lips you take a sip but the sip is them followed by a larger sip, then by a gulp. It's really that good.  I would consider this a go-to beer which I would always have on hand if I didn't just run out of it.  Truly exceptional.

S - Grapefruit citrus and pine followed by grassy and a bit of malt. T - Gold malt, piney and citrusy hops. Yeasty. A bit of a bite on the finish. Somewhat metallic aftertaste. M - Light to medium. A bit slick at first but finishes remarkably dry and crisp. D - Definitely a full flavor brew. 7% ABV gives it some kick.

610,2751,maskednegator,4.04,"Appearance: Golden. Agressive pour results in puffy head, which slowly deflates, leaving great lacing on the glass. Smell: Floral, citrus hops. A ton of them. Taste: Big grapefruit up front fills the sinus, mellow maltiness follows, balanced by a pine-sol hop bitterness in the finish. Mouthfeel: Medium-bodied, slightly acidic Drinkability: I love IPAs, so this is an all-night beer for me. Others may be put off by the a lingering metallic finish. Some would think it's like sucking on a rusty penny, but I compare it to licking a 9 volt battery.  Verdict: 8/10. You can find this in many bars in San Diego, so I often recommend it to my friends. It's only a $4 bomber (insane for a bottle-conditioned beer). Reserve a little in the bottle, and drink it separately.

D - This is a drinkable beer. The first time I had it, I didn't like it, but it's been a while and I've grown as a beer drinker. This is a fine example of a good west coast IPA.

Beer pours a light, golden color. Fairly clear with a little haze. Some bubbles rising in the glass.  Lots of citrusy hop aroma. Mostly grapefruit with some orange and tangerine. Some bready malt character in the background.  Taste starts out with citrusy hops as well. Mostly grapefruit. Good malt backbone in the middle provides some sweetness which helps the balance. A little piney on the finish. Drying. The alcohol makes itself known on the finish a little in the taste as well as some warming.  Good mouthfeel. Carbonation level is excellent. Very crisp on the tongue but goes down smooth.  This is a great IPA. Excellent taste and drinkability. Tons of hops, but still some balance. Between an IPA and DIPA in strength.

Sweet candied grapefruit, orange rind, lightly toasted biscuits and a touch of evergreens.  Citrus rind and pine needles come to forefront, then a sweet rush of candied grapefruit followed by a mild bitterness. Doesn't push the extremes.  Full bodied and chewy. Cask does great things for the mouthfeel of IPA's.  A pretty solid IPA that doesn't push the envelope of sweetness or bitterness.

T - Surge of hop goodness with equal parts pine, citrus and resin with a touch of floral character as well. Hops are supported by a sweet caramel malt base. Lots of piney hop flavor in the finish.  M - Medium bodied with a slightly syrupy texture and smooth cask mouthfeel. Touch of alcohol heat. Fairly aggressive bitter finish.  D - One of my favorite IPAs out there.

The sticky, sappy, wood; hint of caramel, creme brulee scorched sugar ceiling, spicy toffee building a supportive foundation for the hops that hop out the glass. The head rests for a while then slips out the back door, leaving a thick ring of residual sucre lacing. The aroma is so inviting, fresh damp greens and cinnamon bread pudding.

S - Fresh sweet hops. YUM! If you could smell hops in the dictionary this is what it would smell like. very much more the floral/citrus hops rather than piney  T - Not as sharp and aggressive that the smell might let on. It's much nicer than that. Big hop taste, but well rounded. This is why I like IPAs. This isn't an IPA that is going to knock your teeth out  M - Some dryness after the sip. I don't feel the as much carbonation that I could see after the pour. Light to medium mouthfeel. It's obviously a real beer, but you don't feel big alcohol.  D - very enjoyable and very nice IPA.

Has the color of aged brass. Smells of oily hops, citrus rinds, and sweetened grapefruit. The hops linger on the palate for a while, before some bitter sweet malts and oranges shine through, balancing everything out. Mouth-feel is medium, and it goes down in a sinewy wave that begs the throat for more.

There is the faint odor of a few grapefruits down at the bottom. When you pull your head back you can sense the delicate odors of fresh cut wildflowers. The warm amber liquid, accented by a slight haze, is asking, no, screaming for you to take a taste. As the tender bubbles of carbonation play across your palate you are again reminded of fresh citrus fruits. Then a warmth passes across your tongue, like being curled up in a velvet blanket.

610,2751,GimmeAles,4.45,"Brilliant honey-yellow has the slighest haze from the bottle conditioning and perhaps massive residual hop matter. Billowing white head blooms like a mushroon in a time-lapse video and hangs on for some time.  Resinous, piney hops dominate the olafactory experience adding some green-leaf, grassy and nearly tobacco-like pungency into the mix. Fleeting vapors of grainy, candy-like sweetness struggle to be noticed.  A raw, evergreen (spruce?) bitternes wallops the palate, but a grapefruit-like fruitiness lends some complexity before lightly toasted, bready-sweet malts bring some balance about. Hints of vanilla and toasted marshmallow are also in the middle. The finish signals the return of the citrus, tree-sap, and tobacco-like hop character. The beer finishes pleasantly dry leaving you to savor addtional fleeting complexities as the hops and malt playfully leave the palate. Just when you think the hops might be overdone, the sturdy malt character keeps things in check, begging another sip. At %7 ABV thought, you'll be taking it easy...right?  The dry finish, massive hop character and whimsical malts make for a spectacular combination - an amazing offering and one of my favorite IPAs.",Bear Republic Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,93

The taste is good, again with the hops, man it sure does make its presence felt. Hops hops hops. But not over-powering at all. Each sip refreshes the hop vigor but never gets annoying.

Initial flavor on the tongue was ample sweetness of grapefruit and honey, giving way to a strong piney/earthy bitterness, which lingered a bit. Mouthfeel was medium bodied and smooth with moderate carbonation. Overall, I really enjoyed this IPA.

The taste was all that good stuff PLUS a toasty sweetness up front that stood out like a diamond in the rough, didn't have that bite that most IPAs do. Mouthfeel was nice & creamy, like a cask almost (might've kept the bottle a little long before drinking, but definitely to the beer's benefit), definitely softer than your typical IPA. Good & drinkable.",Bear Republic Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,93
610,2751,nicnut45,3.9,"Appearance: This beer pours a a hazy tan color. There is little carbonation. A thin layer of carbonation hangs around, and nice sticky lacy on the glass.  Smell: The smell is great, but for the style? I dont know. This to me is more along a belgian or imperial I.P.A. The sweet malt pops out more then the hops. You smell whiffs of sour cider, cotton candy like sweetness and alcohol. I am deperatly trying to get that overwhelming hop smell but yielding nothing.  Taste: Im sorry but to me this is not an I.P.A. sweet malt dominates on the first sip followed by bitterness. This beer changes as you finish it through. But I get hints of marshmallow or kind of like nouget in the finish. Maybe followed by a bit of pepper. WOW! never had anything like that marshmallow taste. But I think you need to let it warm up a bit before you will appreciate it. I cant put a finger on the hops, but the bitterness is there complimenting the sweetness. Its as if the bitter hop character and the alcohol are meddled together.  Mouthfeel: Let this warm up, mouthfeel is soft with light carbonation. Dominate sweetness followed by bitterness will stick to the sides of the mouth after the swallow.  Drinkability: This is a tasty beer, I would have maybe two in a night. There is a lot going on when drinking this. Would I buy it again? Maybe. This beer is labeled as I.P.A. but it does not taste like a standard I.P.A.. So if I was looking for an I.P.A., no. But it is a good brew.",Bear Republic Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,93

Spice, grapefruit, and lemon. Very unusual but not in a bad way.  Mouthfeel: Pretty creamy for an IPA. Not as biting/oily.  Drinkability: Not as aggressively hopped as IPAs I'm accustomed to, but not a bad example of the style. Unique. I will enjoy this brand again.",Bear Republic Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,93
610,2751,Source,4.2,"Served on-tap at my local hole in a 12oz pilsner glass. The keg kicked soon after my glass, which may have effected the review.  A: Poured a slightly cloudy orange / amber with a 5mm head which settled quickly. Nice lacing.  S: Strong pine over hops. I usually prefer it the other way around.  T: Similar to the smell but more intense with a strong grapefruit hoppiness. Nice malt background sweetness. Finished with limited bitterness. A unique IPA taste.  M: Nice and smooth.

But after my girlfriend picked me up a 22 oz bottle for Valentine's Day, I had to give it another shot. Wow! I don't know what I was thinking the first time around. This was awesome. The pour is beautiful with a deep caramel coloring, despite some particulates floating around. This beer left a nice lacing around the top of my mug. There is not a lot of carbonation and the alcohol is hidden very well. This was a very easily drinkable IPA.

610,2751,Reneejane,4.2,"I had this on tap. As an IPA it is a little less hoppy than perhaps I've gotten accustomed to. The beer was a pretty bright gold color shading to amber, clear with a creamy off white head that definitely carried the hop aroma. I don't know what hop accomplished this feat but it tasted of tangerines. I hear there is an experimental hop that is supposed to do this and I doubt that is in this beer but something combined to make a distinctive tangerine flavor. It's an unusual thing to notice in an IPA, and sooo tasty. I detected quite a bit of malty sweetness from an IPA.

Aroma is fresh hops and big malt. Earthy piny hops and toffee with buttered rolls. Sweet candy sugar and doughnuts.  Taste is upfront hops, bright and floral. Citrus hops are not very big here but piny earthy and floral tones are huge. Malt is there as a supporting actor and could be bigger. It's a shame it's not more represented, as the malt flavors in his beer are delicious. Vanilla cake and caramel with a touch of oakiness. Creamy milk-like characters of the malt are intriguing and good.  Mouthfeel is medium to full, slick and oily the malt has body without a ton of flavor which is a shame.

A little hazy with a half inch of head sticking around. Laces nicely all the way down.  Smell - Very nice. I definitely get the grapefruit, and the citrus, although there is something almost astringent lingering. Nice hoppy character.  Taste - Pretty hoppy up front. Definitely some of that citrus and grapefruit. Cascadish I might say. Can actually taste some bread in there as well. It dries pretty harshly however on the finish. Almost feels like I just used mouthwash. It's a little harsh on the back end. Also, there seems to be another level where this one can't quite reach. I could ask for a little more complexity.  Mouthfeel - Pretty rich. Coating the tongue, and a tad syrupy. Nothing too unpleasant though, pretty hearty.  Drinkability - Pretty solid. I enjoy it, and could put back a couple. The booze is pretty well disguised.  Overall, this is a nice IPA. It's got some good floral hoppiness, and decent intensity. It's just lacking a back end, and that extra something that sets the great ones apart. Still, a very solid bev.

T - more of the traditional grapefruit flavour comes through, but it's still got that sweet-fruit flavour, malt character is virtually non-descript, seems to be providing some basic sweetness and a decent backbone, hops are quite strong, but don't have any bite, very smooth bitterness, aftertaste is lingering sweet hops and alcohol which blend quite nicely.  M - bit more body than some IPAs, but still no more than medium, very smooth and creamy, carbonation is medium and keeps it light, alcohol is evident, but quite mild  D - yeah, this is a damn good IPA, and slightly different from the norm.

Each swallow leaves a coat of lacing behind.  S: A hint of malt mixed with nice floral and citrus hop aromas.  T: Starts off showing off the nice malty backbone. Then the citrus hop flavors really give you a kick in the mouth all the way through the finish. A very nice balanced IPA that isn't trying to be a Double IPA like many others in the style seem to be these days.  M: The never ending head on this one gives it a nice creamy texture. The body is of medium thickness. Its enjoyable to roll around in the mouth.  D: The nice balance makes this one very drinkable.

Wonderful hoppy smell, but that fruit background isn't lost. The taste is wonderful. Delicious hop flavor without losing any of that citrus background. I think we were all shocked by it's amazing balance and bold flavors. I think the long-awaited taste of Bear Republic was well worth it, as that first sip proved how great of a beer they can make.

The color is on the golden side, as opposed to amber or otherwise. The smeill is grapefruit with some solid bitterness at the back.

T - Bit hit of grapefruit & cedar up front... mostly cedar, but it doesn't dominate like some IPAs. There is lots of caramelly sweet malt that really balances things out nicely. Relatively dry finish considering all the malt in this one. Cedar & grapefruit peel really hangs around in the finish, but not puckeringly so.  M - Fairly thick for an IPA, and thinly carbonated. Thought there might be more carbonation for the amount of head on the beer. I suspect the lack of carbonation might be part of the reason it doesn't taste quite as hop crazy as some IPAs.  D - Seems pretty good for and IPA. I can't really handle a lot of the heavily hopped beers, but this one is very well balanced. The alcohol is well-hidden, so even at only 7% it might sneak up on you. Like the balance in this one.  Nice IPA, good price too. Got this one for $6 I think?

Sweet nose of white pit fruit and orange to lemon citrus, feels juicy, dewy flower petals, beeswax, manages to stay sweet given its hoppiness, not the longest finish, tactfully concise. Medium-bodied, noticeably foamy as you start to sip, grapefruit, orange citrus upfront, less floral but perhaps more piney and waxy.

The beer was a burnt orange color and had a 2 finger head with decent lacing. The beer smells of piney hops and a bit of citrus. Hops dominate the taste, but it is lacking on something to counterbalance the hops. This beer is more bitter than some of the double IPAs that I have had (not that it's a bad thing, just that there could be more for the style).

610,2751,tapman,4.4,"Thin head after moderate pour with decent lacing. Color is very clear with a light orange hue on the skinny bottom of my flute/nonic glass and deepens in color as the glass spreads out towards the top. Looks very appetiving and potentialy sweet, though we'll see.  After a vigorous swirl the nose comes back a myriad bouquet of American grassy, spicy hops mixed with a fruity, bready hop of the English variety. With this, an American IPA I'm inclined to think that the hop profile is all American with a great malt balance and sans English hops, but I'm not ruling out some EKG or something like that. Malt indeed smells quite sweet with a warm and aggressive, though not too fusel, alcohol sting.  Very smooth on the palate. Just enough sugar in beer to sit and linger briefly on the palate before blending the sweet, sweet fruit of the bittering hops. Then comes some more sugar and the flavor come through grassy, resionous, and sticky in the finish. BIG HOP FLAVOR in the end. I would almost be inclinded to think that the largest addition of hops to this brew were at the 20 of the boil, or the relative flavoring point for this recipe. Bravo on the big and complex hop experience.  Right amount of malts to not only balance the hops, but to give this brew a full body without crossing over into syrup country. Strong yet refreshing.  If the alcohol taste wasn't as big this beer would be more drinkable, but it wouldn't be as good if you ask me. I rate drinkability based on can you session the thinkg pared with the criteria for the style. For example, I could just about session some Chimay Blue or some Kwak even though they are relatively large beers. This one almost gets it, but the alcohol finish makes this just shy of sessionable, though by all means a fantastic IPA. Bought to go eat some salmon with this brew. Here I go...mmph... delicious. Would definately reccomend this brew with some seafood. Enjoy!",Bear Republic Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,93
610,2751,olmatty,4.5,"Appearance- Low creamy white head and brownish copper liquid. Light lacing.  Smell- Stong nose of piney hops  Taste- Piney and resinous fresh and floral hops flavor. Tangerine peel and amber malts, perhaps a bit heavy toward the hops end, but it works.  Mouthfeel- Viscus and a bit frothy.  Drinkability- So much hops that anything lighter in hops will taste like water if drank during the same session. A very strong and enjoyable IPA. Not many better ones out there.",Bear Republic Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,93
610,2751,StJamesGate,4.17,"Pours cloudy orange with visible sediment. Thin head leaves good lacing. Cotton candy floral nose. Ruby red grapefruit hops with tart Cascade cutting across. Sweet marshmallow malt background. Carbonation adds to light and lively mouthfeel; never clings. Tingly lemon finish, like Italian ice. The 7% ABV is very quiet.  Piles of hops but they're never astringent. Artful.  2nd tasting, 3/3/13 - Madeleine malts, lots of peach/apricot fruit, a good dose of citrus, and real aspirin/IBU finish. Still one of the best.",Bear Republic Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,93
610,2751,macster,4.22,"Bomber bottle. Pours a slightly hazy amber-orange with a tight, thick off-white head. The Columbus aromatic hops come through nicely, but a bit restrained, resulting in a fragrant pine needle and spice nose with just a touch of citrus. Mouthfeel was creamy and full with a subdued carbonation level. Initial flavor was a well balanced presentation of orange, grapefruit, sweet caramel and faint background of Juicy Fruit chewing gum. Late palate to finish is moderately bittersweet, but a bit short and syrupy. Overall a fairly solid IPA and worth a visit, but not all that outstanding",Bear Republic Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,93
610,2751,BedetheVenerable,4.03,"Presentation: 24oz. bomber with race themed graphics.  Appearance: Slightly hazy dark gold beer with high carbonation and a rocky, dense whipped-cream ivory head with great retention. Nice!  Smell: Fresh herbal resiny hops, slightly earthy with a little toasty caramel in the background.  Taste: EARTHY herbal hop flavors with just a hint of caramel in the background.  Mouthfeel: Medium bodied, with a crisp bitter finish  Drinkability: Pretty high for the abv.

610,2751,BuffaloTapHugger,4.22,"12 oz. bottle poured into a pint glass. (date stamped 8/19/08)  A: Nice hazy dark golden color. One finger head lays on top for a brief period before receding.  S: Strong aromatics. Lemon zest, pines, grapefruit come in to play.  T: Big bite of hops on the forefront. Not too overpowering as some IPA's can be, but BR is not to subtle about it either. Not too bitter on the palate, very refreshing aftertaste of the pine.  Drinkability: Yes. This is one of my favorite IPA's. A fine session beer if there ever was one. Will recommend to all.",Bear Republic Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,93
610,2751,Brewnami,4.2,"A- Very clear amber color. Not much head, little lace.  S- Pine, citrus, maybe some floral scents.  T- HUGE hop taste. Tastes very similar to smell. Pine, citrus (grapefruit and may some orange peel). If you want to know what hops taste like, this is the beer. Very refreshing... if you are a big IPA fan.  M- Kind of sticky. Very bitter after taste.  D- Not a beer I would ever session with. I bought a 22oz bottle and that is perfect. The hop bitterness is pretty intense. In my opinion, I would say even more so than the DFH 90min. Awesome beer for IPA lovers, will absolutely purchase again. Highly recommended for anyone with a huge hop pallet.",Bear Republic Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,93
610,2751,pmcadamis,4.2,"A - Amber/gold with a nice big fluffy two finger head that looks like a light khaki hue flecked with orange. Big sheets of really fluffy lace coat the glass.  S - Super pine-y hops! This smells like a North West Coast pine forest. Reminds me of how my hands smelled after climbing the big fir tree in our front yard as a kid.  T - Big time hops, just like the nose this is pretty much all about the pine aspects of the hop plant, but some background grapefruit is there, along with a malt backbone that tries to keep up with the hops but is drastically out shined by the star of this show.  M - Medium bodied with some sudsy carbonation and super hoppy semi-dry finish. The hop bitterness sticks to my teeth for hours after drinking one of these.  D - I hat to say it, but this is almost too hoppy in that it's pretty one dimensional and isn't supported by a big malty base like a DIPA. Fortunately, the one dimension shown here is done extremely well. This would be the perfect beer to give to someone who asks ""what do hops taste like."" Boom, here ya go... this is exactly what hops taste like.",Bear Republic Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,93

The nose is all about the hops here, with nary a hint of cracker maltiness. Crisp mouthfeel, with lively carbonation. Hops attack and scour the tongue, with and array of citrus and pine resins. This is a hopheads dream. No hint of 7 % abv. Dangerously drinkable. So happy to finally see this available here in NC. This immediatly goes into the regular rotation along with Foothills, Founders, and Stone as a killer hop fix. Great stuff.",Bear Republic Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,93

610,2751,mrandolph,4.92,"This was a cask version, and a case where the brewers made a great effort to match the beer with the medium. The beer presents as a very clear golden color capped with a dense, creamy white head, almost like cool whip, in a good way, which hangs out for a long time.  The aroma is citrus followed by malt. The flavor starts bitter, reminiscent of lemon zest. The middle is sweet malt and it finishes bitter but not dry with sweet flavors as an aftertaste. The mouth feel is dense with good head and a medium body, denser than the color suggests. My overall impression is that this beer is well crafted to excel in the cask beyond what it does in the bottle, and I feel privileged to have gotten a taste from cask.",Bear Republic Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,93
610,2751,hops4me,4.25,"Had this on tap at the Capital Ale House in Fredericksburg, VA. This was an excellent IPA. The aroma was of pine and citrus with slight malt nose. The taste was hops foward with a malt backbone providing a nice support. Slight toasted grain shows through the hops. This was a medium mouthfeel with very good drinkability. I will definitely buy/order again as it was a very nice example of the style.",Bear Republic Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,93

Poured a a golden orange color with a nice 1.5 finger head that stuck around for a while, decent lacing, Smelled like grapefruit, orange. Tasted awesome, less grapefruit then in the smell but still there, had a piny aftertaste. Medium bodied with a nice oily/creamy feel.

610,2751,cvstrickland,4.27,"The 12-ounce bottle poured into my DFH shaped pint glass yields a lightly-hazed bronze-amber body capped with two fingers of fine-beaded white foam. The head settles into a rocky, spongy formation that leaves chunky webs of lacing on the glass.  The smell is pungently herbal with zesty citrus. Sweetly floral notes contribute to the hop-bombery of the bouquet.  The taste is more balanced that the aroma might indicate, but is still as blatantly hop-forward as expected. Notes of spicy citrus and oily, bitter, sticky herbs clash headlong with toasty, biscuity malt forces, resulting in one hell of a delicious collision. Dryly malty syrup lingers in the aftertaste, spiked with lime zest and bitter-ass snipped spruce needles.  The drink is medium-bodied with nice carbonation, and is a succulent, poundable IPA.

I might have just blown out my nose with dinner but this really has a very mellow aroma, slight citrus, way less than I was expecting.  Flavor is a nice balance between malt and light citrus flavors, a tad on the sweeter side of things. Nice and lively in the mouth and leaves the pallet with a nice light bitterness.

Sweet biscuity malt backing.  T-Hop smack in the face of spicy citrus, tangerine/orange. Support of sweet biscuit malt backs thing up. A nice honor to the hops...with a pleasant drying bitterness and a honey-like sweetness in the finish.  M-Medium body with nice lingering flavours.  D-Wow! Racer 5 out of the bottle ROCKS!

Came to the table with a one inch off-white head that receded to a sticky film and left loads of lacing all up and down the pint glass.  Aroma is hops, hops and more hops. Great pine and citrus going on here backed by a strong caramel malt foundation. Just bitter enough in the taste to get my IPA fix, with lots of grapefruit. An IPA that has this kind of hope profile is great because it beautifully meshes with the 7% ABV. Lately I actually tend to prefer IPAs in that ABV range.

610,2751,jkrich,3.92,"12 oz. bottle with no freshness date  Poured a deep, gold to new penny copper color. It was mostly clear with noticeable suspended particles floating.  After removing the cap, I immediately smelled the open bottle and was strong with a familiar west coast pine aroma.  This aroma carried over into the pint glass. The taste was an initial assault of hoppy bitterness and a very faint, fleeting malt flavor. It is a little abrasive on the tongue. This one is all about the hop bitters; it could use more balance, but it is satifying. It mellows somewhat as it warms, allowing more malt flavor.  Agressive hopping gives this one a rather strong piney aftertaste that lingers. Not overly carbonated and medium bodied.  Not as good as I thought it would be. I purchased this one at Jungle Jim's in Fairfield, Ohio unrefrigerated. As it does not have a freshness date, I may have purchased an old six-pack. This well worth trying if it is in your area. The 7.0 ABV may keep this one from being sessionable.",Bear Republic Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,93

Throughout I get a strong malt backbone. This is an incredibly balanced IPA. Leaves a slightly bitter aftertaste.  M- Smooth medium bodied brew with medium-low carbonation.

It has a nice medium head when poured vigerously in the glass, but it dissapates fast, blink one time and the head's gone. But it is creamy and leaves ok to desent lacing. Ok, the second pours, the beer has clarified a little. And the head stays a lot longer, with thicker lace.  The aroma is up in your face hops of citrus and floral and pine. As the head leaves, I pick up some pale malts. But swirl the glass good and the hops come back. I detect fresh orange zest. And lemon zest.  The flavor is pretty bitter, which is to be expected, but as it warms, the bitterness gets softer. Much softer. I get a good balance of malts and hops. Not boozy at all. Very pungent hop character. Strong citrus and resinous pine.  The mouthfeel is full bodied for sure. Has a a little dryness to it, which is good IMO. Pretty smooth for an IPA od this calaber.

Pours a very hazy light copper, with a bone white 2 finger head, and as the head dissipates, a nice layer of lacing is left behind. There is very little activity in body.  In the nose, one finds a lot of lighter fruits, particularly apricot, some white grapes, orange, and a lot smoothed out sweetness.  On the palate, it comes across with a little bitterness right off the bat. Some heaviness comes in body and flavoring in the form of apricot, as mentioned above.

Update 9/14/08: Thought I'd revist this tasty IPA...Growler from Bellport Beer. Aroma of luscious pine and faint citrus. Flavor of lots of citrus (orange peel) with bitter piney hops in the finish.

A very large citric burst in the aroma along with hints of dry malts. While it has a huge hop burn for the taste and finishes dry, it is mostly a smooth and citric flavored beer that does dry the tongue a little as it leaves its mark (not that this is a bad thing).

Mouthfeel: Not too much carbonation with a medium body. Doesn't finish as dry as I'd like.  Drinkability: Not too bitter, very sweet. All around a very pleasant drinking experience.

610,2751,biboergosum,4,"22oz bottle. I've heard about this brewer being a leader in the West Coast way, so I jumped at the opportunity to procure some of this whilst checking out the retail beer scene in friendly Austin, Texas a few weeks ago. Best not to let the purported goodness of the style fade away by neglecting it, so here we go, into an American pint glass it is.  This beer pours a slightly hazy, medium copper amber colour, with a few fingers of thick, puffy, and rocky off-white head, which persists for a good while, slowly leaving a solid ring of webbed lace around the glass.  It smells of big grapefruit and blood orange citrus rind, a slight earthy chalkiness, bready caramel malt, and a little bit of pine resin and leafy green character in there too. The taste is a big ol' smack of juicy citrus and acrid piney hops up front, followed by a sturdy caramel malt, and more testy piney, leafy, and floral hoppiness dancing the Watusi on my tastebuds, all.  The carbonation is quite moderate in its coddling frothiness, the body a decent middleweight, and mostly smooth, with a small airy creaminess coming on-line as things warm up a tad. It finishes off-dry, with any warming from the elevated alcohol hard to discern: I'm just too warm and fuzzy from an early onset hop coma.  Racer 5 is indeed tasty, and obviously unbalanced (in an arguably good way), due in part to all that hop bitterness. But as I progressed, and became accustomed to it, the sweet malt offset became much more evident. This slow to arrive je ne sais quoi certainly makes for a decent drinkability, once suitably primed, as it were.",Bear Republic Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,93
610,2751,swizzlenuts,4.2,"The beer is tan with a small head, but pretty damn good retention. There is a small head during the entire beer, with great lacing. The nose on the beer is sweet and hoppy, and pretty balance. Mostly a fruity aroma from the malts and yeast though. It was different than I expected. When taking a drink the beer hits you with a large amount of hop flavour and bitterness. A bit of alcohol comes through with the hops as well, which is okay. Behind the huge amount of hops comes a slightly fruity flavour, but it's hidden by the slight watery mouthfeel.

610,2751,blackjack000,3.78,"Bomber bottle poured into a goblet.  Appearance: Deep honey gold. Beautiful, frothy head--thick-looking, like the head on a root beer float.  Smell: Citrus and sugary. Grapefruit rolls into my nose and singes my nosehairs.  Taste & Mouthfeel: Grapefruit comes out right off the bat. Big time. Wow. Overwhelming grapefruit flavor. Very strong grapefruit aftertaste. A sweet, malty backtaste sits in the background. The grapefruit is turned to 10, it's hard to notice anything else going on. The tingly carbonation works well to highlight the citrus puckering flavor. The overall feel almost makes me feel like I'm drinking some kind of grapefruit soda/beer drink.  Drinkability: A very nice IPA. Very distinct. However, that being said . . . I don't know if I would be down to drink more than one at a sitting. The citrus tends to blow me away.

610,2751,sweetbrew82,4.23,"Poured from a 22 oz. bomber into a pint glass:  P: Pours light-copper out of the bottle and sits a very clear, deep golden-copper (almost orangish) color in the glass. Produces a fluffy, tooth-white colored head made up of medium-sized bubbles, which has great retention! It finally dies down to form a nice cap of foam on top that never quits. Leaves great, chunky webs of lacing down the glass as well.  A: Smells of ripe grapefruit, citrusy hops, and toasted malts to compliment.  T: Starts with a citrusy-twang that tastes a bit like grapefruit rinds with a toasty malt backbone that provides the trunk to which the big hop flavors seem to branch out from. Upon the dry, and quite smoooth finish, the hops provide some significant spice to the back of the throat and tongue. Racer 5 leaves an aftertaste of those same citrusy, spicy hop flavors for what seems like forever and a day. Delicious!  M: Body is medium-full, smooth, massaging, and perfect for an IPA of this character.  D: Drinkability is very high with this one. A 22 oz. bottle just seemed to vanish into thin air in a matter of minutes. Very easy drinking!  Notes: This is one excellent version of a West Coast IPA. Citrusy hops, grapefruity flavors, toasted malt backbone, with just the right amount of bitterness without being overpowering. The touch of spice on the dry, and long-lasting finish just puts a nice little ribbon and bow on this great brew! Predictable.

There is a real sweetness beneath, which slightly cuts thru the hops, but is a real compliment..  M: Medium in body with good carbonation.  D: Very, wonderful beer.",Bear Republic Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,93

Well, this is less than that.  It's bitter but it's not actively angry. It's piney, but it's not sticky.  It's good, but not a favorite. Nice baseline to return to, time to time. I do return to it.",Bear Republic Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,93
610,2751,davexisxrabid,4.22,"Poured a 22 oz. bottle into a pint glass (two actually, shared this one with my girlfriend).  Nice cloudy amber coloration. Beer provided a small head which fizzled out kinda quick, but there was good carbination and lacing throughout the drinking period.  I was surprised (and so was my girlfriend because she likes sweeter beers like Lambic's and heffe's) at the sweet aroma of this beer, in a good way. There was a citrus-sweet aroma like a floral arrangement; grapefruit scenet was strong.  The taste was a good combination of malts, though the hops do come through big time, like a good IPA should. Very well balanced and not too hoppy.  Racer 5 was medium bodied; the taste sticks around on your tounge but it isn't heavy or overpowering.  I found this to be very drinkable and could definitely have more than one (my girlfriend thought so too ... good, maybe I can get her to drink more beer this way). I wouldn't go as far as to say this is a session beer because it is 7% abv, but I wouldn't mind having this one all night long.",Bear Republic Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,93

Nice lacing on the walls of my glass.  Smells of sweet grapefruit and other citrus.  Like the nose, the predominant flavor is moderately bitter grapefruit. Bitter through the middle and end of the drink. Nice and hop forward with just the right amount of malts to keep things in check.  Medium bodied and medium to full flavored beer.

610,2751,bigkahunas4,4.03,"Poured from a 22 oz bomber into a pint glass.  My initial pour of this was underwhelming - a copper orange with really minimal head. Nose was of stale hops, pine and citrus alike. Flavors mild and subdued. To me it was a bit above average.  However, after it had sit for about 15 minutes before I filled my pint again, what a complete turnaround. Huge 2 finger head, that had some incredible peaks and valleys. Extremely frothy and just providing a second layer to the glass.  Nose really came alive, and some really sweet hops jumped out at me. Taste was much more fresh and had a nice wooden character to it. Big biscuity malt backbone moved to a nice array of hops. Great texture and just really was a delight.  Pop this one open and let it sit in the bottle for a good 10-15 minutes before serving this one - and you'll have one of the better IPAs you've ever had.",Bear Republic Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,93

Smell Very nice citrus/grapefruit/lemon smell. I also get a bit of carmel. Very pleasant beer to smell. Very nice hops.  Taste I like the taste of Big IPA's and Racer 5 is a great example of this style. The low carbonation with the citrus up front finishes a little bitter which I really like. I also note the spiceness and a touch of sweet carmel taste. I reall think this beer has a lot going on and its well balanced.  Mouthful: Low carbonation with the tanginess in the mouth is reall cool. Very pleasant.  Drinkability.

610,2751,charlesw,3.95,"Clear pale amber with a very low head that&#8217;s gone in a flash. Interestingly, a completely covering lace is there and hangs out for a long time. Smells like it's going to taste like cascades. Oh. Well, interesting. Crisp, bitter at the end (in a throat clearing kind of way), lingering citrus peel aftertaste. Not so dry or bitter as, say, a Pliny. And, golly, it&#8217;s a good thing. This is an IPA. Hello! Anyway, I&#8217;m not thrilled with the after taste (makes my mouth water &#8211; and that&#8217;s not a good thing in this case). As an IPA, I&#8217;d say it would be better with more rounded hops to it &#8211; a little less of the citrus and a little less bitter at the end. Of course, I&#8217;d probably not change this recipe and make it more of my perfect IPA &#8211; I&#8217;d change it to make it a better beer. So I&#8217;d up the body and take the alcohol up about a degree.

S: Hops on the nose, nice fresh citric hops that scream of grapefruit and lemon, with some caramel notes binding it together. Really nice, it is what I think a West Coast IPA should smell like (most likely because this is the beer that brought me to the dance)  T: It's a picture. It's a picture that is painted on a canvas of hops. It's a picture that is painted with flavors of caramel, biscuit, grapefruit, raisins, and prunes. It's a picture that you don't walk past... you stop, appreciate and most likely buy. It's a nice picture, it's a great beer.  M: It's sticky and smooth... it's clean and leaves you wanting to take another sip. Just a well constructed body  D: As I mentioned, this has been a bridge for me in the beer world. I was lucky enough to have my first pint of Racer 5 at the Moan & Dove in 2004...

A nice white foamy head that sits for a while before settling down to a nice ring.  S: The smell is fantastic on this. Very bitter hop aroma, but that is complemented nicely with nice hints of fruit: apricot, lemon, orange, and grapefruit.  T: This is a very nice balance of bitterness and sweet fruit flavors. Not extremely bitter like some other IPAs, but the perfect amount of bitterness to sweet malt/fruit flavors.

S: Pepper, citrus. Very, very hoppy nose. I like.  T: Just as advertised by the nose, peppery, citrusy hops. Nice bready malt back balances things out nicely.  M: Moderate. A little bit of hop oil makes it a tad slick, but not in a bad way.  D: This is a great IPA to have around. I tend to prefer the bottle conditioned IPA's (2H Ale, Bridgeport, et al), so I will add a few more bottles of this to my beer cabinet.

610,2751,chaz410,3.89,This is a pretty stand up IPA. I had the pleasure of having this at the Common Market here in Charlotte NC. Very typical IPA appearance. This beer uses a Columbus hops which is a new hybrid hop that typically would only add bittering aromatics but this also ads some taste. The smell is obviously hoppy with a little citrus zip in it. It isn't overwhelmingly hoppy like a lot of IPAs but it's a nice floral smell. The taste leads in with the bittering hops but the cascade hops really balance it out well and the after taste is not super bitter like your typical IPA. I enjoyed it and really like the contrasting hop notes.,Bear Republic Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,93

Nice malt sweetness to back it up in the finish.  Mouthfeel is light in body with and oily texture. Good carbonation.  Drinkability is god/excellent. No real alcohol presence and very well done IPA.

Slightly hazy orangish gold, it has a medium-big off-white head that slwoly shirnks to a lasting, thin foamy top. It leaves some pretty good lace.  The aroma is mostly citrusy hops, primarily grapefruit in character, with a little raisin and grape juice and a faint hint of bread crust underneath.  The taste is better, more complex, and less grapefruity but still clearly dominated by citrusy hops. It has fairly strong citrus, leaning to grapefruit, hitting up front but immediately tempered with underlying slightly caramelly raisiny, malty sweetness and an interesting yeasty quality, making it sweeter before a somewhat bitter finish.

610,2751,AltBock,4.22,"22 oz. bomber bottle with a black and gold label that has a checkered flag in the background with the name of the beer in big bold red letters and with the number ""5"" in the middle of the label. To the right of the picture is the Government warning and the barcode. To the left of the picture is a paragraph about the beer, Brew Master Notes, refund values, and a small map with the brewery's location marked with a white star. I have so far never seen a Bear Republic bottle with a date marked on it and ""Racer 5"" is no different.  Appearance: I decided to pour this big bold IPA into my Sly Fox Imperial pint glass. This Bear Republic beer poured a golden orange that had a small tint of amber mixed in with it. Sitting on top of this golden brew was a 3/4 to 1 inch head of pure white foam. This nice white head of foam had really good slow retention that left behind a small white film and a few tiny white streaks of lace around the glass. Overall, it was a nice little above average IPA appearance.  Smell: I thought the aroma was going to be hugely hopped. It was highly hopped, but it wasn't aggressively hopped. This beer's aroma was very hoppy with piney hops, citrus hops, a hint of tart grapefruit, a few pine needles, a tiny touch of sweet yeast, a splash of lemon peel, and then finishes up with a dash of orange peel and coriander. When the beer was swirled, the aroma becomes sweet with yeast, sweet grapefruit, and a lot more orange peel. I tried to find some malts in the aroma, but I guess all the hops in the beginning of the aroma and all the citrus aromas following them completely covered up the malts.  Taste: After reading on the label that ""Racer 5 is an aggressive styled IPA,"" I thought it was going to be an aggressive in your face tasting IPA. It was hoppy but it really wasn't that aggressively hopped. Instead, this beer went down the well balanced path instead of the punch you in the face hoppyness. There were 3 parts to the taste. The first 2 were controlled by all of the hops and citrus flavors. The first part consisted of the citrus and piney hops and a hint of lightly tart grapefruit. The 2 part consisted of lemon peel, pine needles, and a small touch of coriander. The last and final part of the taste consisted of toasted caramel malts and a subtle taste of sweet yeast. I liked this type of IPA. It wasn't aggressivley hopped, but still hugely hopped with an ending of toasted caramel malts. Great IPA!  Mouthfeel: This highly hopped IPA was medium bodied with a nice level of carbonation and with a toasty and lightly hoppy aftertaste of toasted caramel malts, a hint of grapefruit, a splash of coriander, and a dash of piney hops. Surprisingly, this aftertaste doesn't last very long. It will last for about 5 seconds and then it's gone for good.  Drinkability: I just had to give this beer a high drinkability score because it's a well balanced IPA and it's easily affordable. You're not going to break the bank buying this IPA. There's those factors and that it's a Bear Republic beer. They always do an excellent job on their beers and this is another one of those beers that shows it.",Bear Republic Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,93

Golden orange standard IPA hues with a lively head and really sticky lacing. Smell is big and juicy floral and citrus hops with sweet grapefruit. The taste was tremendous. Besides the incredible hops and citrus, I even found a sweeter sensation of peaches and mangoes. I am very impressed with Racer 5 on this second try.

Pretty. The nose is citrus hoppy with a touch of honey. Fresh and leafy citrus hop flavors dominate. Crisp fresh malt is detected up front, but it is quickly followed by an assault of spicy, citrusy hops push the malt into the background and merely support the hops all the way to the dry, spicy, slightly hot (alcoholic) finish. A very drinkable IPA despite the 7 percent alcohol. It goes down very easy no doubt in large part due to its dryness. Body is surprisingly light. Methinks I have a fresh bottle of this stuff.

610,2751,NittanyBeerFan,4.38,"Bear Republic really caught be off guard...for a brewery that I have never heard of, they have now provided me with two amazing beer drinking experiences!  A: Pours a deep amber into my pint glass. There is a little bit of head on the pour but it dissipates quickly. The only thing left is a thin film of bubbles with little pockets of concentrated bubbles on the top of the beer. I love it when my beer looks like this. I find it generally is a sign of a hoppy beer.  S: Smells like a mountain of cascade hops. Wow. I think I might be in heaven.  T: The smell and my predictions from the appearance proved right on. Ho. Lee. Shit. The hops tingle on the tongue and kick you right in the teeth. This beer has more than just hops though. There is some real character in there. There is a good balance and sweetness that comes from the heavy malts in the brew. The hop bitterness lingers on the palate long after the swallow.  M/D: The taste and light carbonation, coupled with the medium to light texture of the beer make this very drinkable. If you wrap that all up into the fact that I love hops, this beer ranks really high on my list of favorite IPAs.",Bear Republic Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,93
610,2751,tburkhart,3.47,"Pours a very nice golden color with decent head that disappears quickly. What little head is left laces the glass very nicely throughout the beer.

S - Wowee that is a floral nose. Heavy on the orangy, grapefruit, and other sweet hop notes. No way I could smell anything else here.  T - Starts off very balanced. The sweetness of the hefty malts is perfectly in balance with the bitterness backdrop. For as many hops are in this beer, it doesn't overdo the bitterness. Mid stream is more of balance - turning more bitter. Only at the end does those marvelous smells come through in the flavor.  M - Has a strong backbone of unfermentables and oils. Coats the mouth and clings a little bit. Carbonation is non-present.  D - The beer is a one at a timer. The amazing flavors, plus the higher than average ABV, would make this one of my favorite beers to drink slowly at the beginning of a night.

610,2751,TrevorGW,4.21,"A dirty golden color ...  Aroma is not as huge with hops as you would expect. I immediately anticipate an oily, slick hop flavor.  The flavor is unbelievably well-balance. The malt stands up to the hops and allows the bitterness to instantly bounce off the caramel malts instead of blasting you and lingering, like most American IPAs. Pine and grass are in the flavor, but are countered by a subtle and stable sweetness on the tongue and in the aftertaste.  A truly drinkable (double) IPA, with the strong malt responsible for the high alcohol. Not too intense, but with a killer taste.

610,2751,yzer,4.72,"Bear Republic Racer 5 is an exemplary West Coast IPA.  This is a full-bore brew that puts more mild-mannered ""IPAs"" like Lagunitas and Sierra Nevada Anniversary to shame.  This IPA has all the creamy off-white head and lacing you could possibly want. The body is smooth and big, leaving me with sticky lips between eager gulps.  The appearance is nothing special and does little to indicate the bold and perfectly balanced taste to come. It's an amber brew with medium clarity and a cream colored head. There is a generous load of yeast on the bottom of each well-conditioned bottle. This IPA is ready to drink right from the store.  The taste is not to be missed. This is a true West Coast IPA with loads of hops that dominate some very sweet and lingering malt. The aroma is a well-crafted balance of pine and malt fragrence. Flavor tones include pine, coffee, and chocolate.  I compare Racer 5 very favorably to the seasonal Sierra Nevada Celebration, but Racer 5 is available all year long.  The Bear Republic label graphics are a little esoteric and reflect the racing proclivities of the owner. I must admit that for me, the label evokes imagery of Bakersfield, comic books and trailer taste which prevented me from trying this marvelous IPA much earlier. Sure, a book can't be read from its cover, but why shoot yourself in the foot and limit your market appeal with label graphics that proclaim, ""teen-aged redneck?"" For a brew of this quality, WRC or Formula 1 symbolism would be more appropriate.  The tall bottles are nice. They chill quickly.  When it gets down to the nitty-gritty I really don't care how the label on an ale bottle looks. I can't say that for the first-time buyers of premium IPA.

There are floaties in the glass, showing a non-pasteurized, non-filtered, REAL LIVE BEER!  Aroma is of biscuity, honey-caramel malt, and tons of grapefruit and piney hops. A somewhat typical but exceptionally well done beer. Nothing really stands out about the aroma except that it's wonderful. Not out of the ordinary in any element other than its exceptionality (if that makes any sense at all...).  Flavor is much the same... well balanced at first, then turning towards citrus hops that overwhelm the rest and finish very grapefruity. The grapefruit-citrus flavor lasts long after each swallow, and leaves you wanting more.  Carbonation is medium-high, body is pretty full and lightly creamy, with a dry, lightly astringent finish. An excellent, well-balanced, very drinkable IPA. Highly recommended.",Bear Republic Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,93

T: Taste is also of grapefruit, and also has some malty sweetness to it. M: Mouthfeel was surprisingly creamy.

T - Great balance of hops with very little bite. Doesn't leave a lingering aftertaste that you get with some other IPA's. M - Mild carbonation. D - A very balanced IPA.

610,2751,bceaglejoe,4.02,"Purchased 22oz bomber at Brookline Liquor Mart, Sept. 30, 2008.  Presentation: Poured a translucent, burnt orange color into a traditional pint glass. Thick, foamy head quickly formed and clung to the glass, leaving a slight residue. It appeared slightly lighter than most IPAs that I've had. I thought that the beer retained its head very well (1.5 fingers) and looked appealing and approachable. It had a pleasant citric aroma with a hoppy undertone that became more pronounced as I took additional breaths.  Tasting: Sweet and tangy as it crossed the threshold of my lips, the beer's hoppiness came across as I drank more of it. With an aggressive hop character, this is a classic example of the American IPA. In my opinion, it is one of the best. It finishes very clean and doesn't overwhelm the palate with bitterness as some other IPAs do. The slightly higher alcohol content is present, but not overwhelming, on the palate. However, it does affect drinkability, as this would not be appropriate for a session.  I've enjoyed this beer on tap before, but I had never had the chance to review it. From memory, it's slightly better on tap, but the bottle is very good, too. If I can't decide when I'm at my favorite beer bar, I'll always go back to this beer. This is a fine example of the style and an essential for anyone seeking a broad understanding of American IPAs.",Bear Republic Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,93

Some sediment floating about.  S - Citrus hops, pine hops and caramel malt.  T - Bitter up front followed by a citrus and malt sweetness and then bitter again. Very nice.  M - Pretty thick and enjoyable.  D - I would like to rate this a little higher but it is on the citrusy end of the IPA scale for me. Very bitter which is what I look for most in an IPA. I will come back to this one.",Bear Republic Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,93
610,2751,RedChrome,4.33,A light haze in the medium orange colored body. Half an inch of off white head faded over a few minutes. Only a small stream of carbonation in the center. Sticky sheets of lace.  A blend of floral and citric scents from the hops were strong right out of the bottle. Citrus scent is of a strong grapefruit aroma. Malt gets overpowered.  A very nice balance. Malt hits for half a second before a hop burst. Grapefruit taste reinforces the scents. A hint of resin like hops oil.  Sticky on the tongue. Carbonation effect is very minimal but helps the flavors in the mouth.  A very good brew. Works perfectly for a chicken tandoori dish. A great brew in the style. Well worth trying to find yourself a bottle.,Bear Republic Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,93

Into my trusted Duvel tulip  A: Hazy orange with a massive white head that settles to a disk, leaving gorgeous lacework,  S: Tons of citrus fruit on the nose with orange, orange zest, some pine. Excellent hop aroma.  T: Starts off with a ton of hop flavor with a lot of citrus fruit character - lots of orange, grapefruit and some sharp zest. Some pine bitterness is present at well. As with my favorite IPAs, there really isn't much malt present- it's a ton of hop flavor that carries on through the dry finish with a pleasing bitter character  M: Excellent for an IPA - light, mildly resiny, bitter, dry, ample carbonation  D: This is one of the better IPAs I've had.

Smell: light caramel, rasted malt, very light hop aroma..expected more from a west coast IPA.  Taste: sweet caramel notes up front, alcohol accross the middle of the tounge, and just enough hop the clean off the pallet to take away the sweetness and leave a nice bitter dry finish in the mouth.  Mothfeel: Very full body, can really feel the heat from the alcohol in my mouth, I really like that! not a typical IPA in my mind, very unique without straying to far from the style.

610,2751,PerzentRizen,4.69,"This is one fine IPA. I have to say that at 7% it is drinkable and tasty. I loved it to the last drop.  I poured my Racer 5 into a duvel glass. The head formed quickly and remained from pour to pour from my 22 oz bomber. The warmer this one got the more robust the dry hopped aroma became.  The smell of west coast fresh hops and pine with an earthy background rip through you as you drink this excellent beer. I never thought I could like this as well as Hop Rod Rye, but I was definately wrong. This beer has huge character.  The taste is backed up by the aroma. The earthy taste, pine resin, and extra bitter finish make this an excellent IPA - strong within its class (a difficult style to stand out among such great beers.  The mouthfeel is strong but not too thick. It is just about perfect for an IPA. It may be, perhaps, a little too carbonated (it is bottle conditioned so it will have some variance).  This is a very drinkable beer that you will try to savor to the last drop, but no matter what you do you won't be able to have your cake and eat it too (it will end).

Smells deliciously floral and sweet and somewhat hoppy. Not overwhelmingly hoppy, given it's an IPA.  T - Candy-ish. A little like an orange toostie-roll lollipop. It was a little too sweet to be a solid IPA; however, the aftertaste was slightly bitter.  M - Even. Not thin, not chewy, not thick...just average.  D - Easy drinking for a 7% IPA. Goes down smoothly. I imagine it would be a good beer for pairing with food.",Bear Republic Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,93
610,2751,lacqueredmouse,3.78,"Hazy, glowing golden orange body, with languous bubbles of fine carbonation. Head it creamy white, leaving amazing lacing. Great looking IPA.  Smell is also great, a beautiful tropical fruit hit - tastes of passionfruit, pineapple, menthol and pawpaw. It's not as overtly powerful as it could be, but it's very nice all the same.  Taste is a resinous bitter character, quite sharp, but clean and fresh, full of character. There's not a huge amount of complexity there, but it's tasty. Strong and robust hop bitterness that resonates through to the back palate. Mouthfeel is a little thin, surprisingly, but the sparkling character matches the hop bite nicely.  This is a pretty decent IPA - it doesn't knock my socks off, but it's solid, drinkable and enjoyable. At least it's a good example of the style.",Bear Republic Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,93

Very nice hoppy aroma, earthy and piney undertones.  A very solid and what seems to be balanced brew. Nice hop flavor but not overdone. Light tones of citrus. Mild hoppy aftertaste.  Smooth mouthfeel with low carbonation.  One of the more drinkable IPA's I have had. Not sure which is better this or the Hop Rod.

The taste starts like the smell, all citrusy hops, slightly sweet and finishes very bitter leaving the mouth dry and puckered. The alcohol is pretty well covered by the bitter finish. The mouthfeel is full bodied and creamy. Drinkability suffers slightly due to the unbalanced finish. If they could maintain the excellent initial flavor throughout, they'd really have something.

610,2751,John_M,4.13,"On tap at Frisco's the other day.  The beer pours a light peachy amber color with very good head retention and lacing. The nose includes the typical grapefruit lime aroma, with some sweet malt as well that is not overdone. The flavors on the palate replicate the nose, with the beer having a nice balance of sweet malt and hops. There is good underlying bitterness to this IPA, but your palate is not overwhelmed by it. This IPA is medium bodied and the abv. is remarkably well hidden. So this beer is very drinkable for an IPA, and remains one of my fall back beers if I do not see anything else particularly of interest on a beer menu.  There are so many good IPA's on the market these days that I rarely order Racer V. Nevertheless, this remains one of the better IPA's on the market, and quality is refreshingly consistent. Unfortunately, after having it's stable mate, the Racer X, I just find it difficult to get too excited about Racer V any more. Still, this remains a good quality, solid IPA.",Bear Republic Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,93
610,2751,erikm25,3.83,"A: Pours very orange with a tinge of gold throughout and almost a very light lime sparkle. The head is huge, fluffy, and creamy with very decent long lasting lacing.  S: Lots of sharp pine, citrus, and lime aroma. The latter aroma, for some reason or another, popped out immediately. However, there was also a roasted malty sweetness that was apparent and added and interesting balance to the smell.  T: Huge citrus, grassy, and herbal hops blast. Very clean and complex tasting. Floral and grapefruit with the alcohol hidden in the backdrop. The taste is still very sweet and that balances nicely with a bready malt flavor.  M: Decent medium body and carbonation. Impressively rich and the hops bitter hits the tastebuds in every direction.  D: While this was not intensely aggressive it was still a great IPA and very drinkable.

The pine dominates the nose, but I could also pick out a little bit of fruitiness and citrus as well. T - This had a very interesting taste to it. Very sweet malts up front. A lot of grapefruity hops came next, which was followed by a somewhat metallic taste, as indicated in the nose, and finally a fruity and hoppy aftertaste...almost tastes like cheddar. M - nice and full with a decent amount of carbonation D - this is a very good IPA. It had a nice balance and I enjoyed the fruitiness of the hops in this.",Bear Republic Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,93
610,2751,trpng0bily,4.36,"Rich golden honey, approaching orange, with a short white head and moderate lacing. There is ample yeast, tiny specks, suspended in the beer, imparting a regal thickness to the brew. It looks like what I would imagine to be nectar of the gods.  Piny hops, but with a distinctive sweetness that seems to be of the hops, not malt. Also a hint of citrus.  First and foremost bitter, crisp, outdoorsy hops that stick around for a good minute after a swallow. There is a breadiness to this beer, along with a slightly dry finish that goes nicely with the hop bitterness.  For an almost hop monster, this is quite drinkable. It stays crisp, with barely a trace of the syrupiness that bothers me in a lot of hoppy brews.",Bear Republic Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,93

S: Caramel/malt aroma is very noteworthy and dovetails into an American citrus hop smell. The caramel/sweeet bread aroma is a nice contrast to the very hoppy flavor...  T: hops throughout; bitterness underlines the entire experience, with a resiny, piney, only slight citrus flavor presence that finishes into a sweet bitterness. As the beer warms up there is an interesting and difficult to describe aftertaste, something like a sweet floral resin flavor that is actually very good and unique.  M: lightly carbonated, slightly sticky, firm to above average body.  D: Lots and lots of flavor in this, which almost becomes overwhelming by the end of the beer, but a very enjoyable IPA.",Bear Republic Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,93

Lots of pine, grapefruit, peach, pineapple, etc. I said this may be the hoppiest beer I've ever had (I live in Missouri, not on the west coast!)  I thought the taste was rather balanced. There's a smoothness and creaminess in the follow through that counteracts the hop bitterness. Apricots, pears, citrus--they all shine through here.  Mouthfeel is not astringent like some hop bomb IPAs. I like that. It is rounded and balanced.  Bring on Racer 5. Glad they finally started importing it to this Anheuser-Busch controlled state.",Bear Republic Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,93

Great taste with excellent balance. Perfect amount of caramel sweetness to meld with juicy fruit hops from above, while the grass and pine come in with a solid, fresh bitterness. Medium-full body with a light, slick, buttery smoothness and tingly-fuzzy carbonation.  Very nice IPA from Bear Republic.

S - Nice floral hops. Just what I'd expect.  T - Floral and citrusy flavor that you can taste before your lips get wet. Some sweetness mixed in but it doesn't detract from the hops. Nice malt support without trying to take the lead. This IPA has a pretty complex flavor.  M - On the thick side for an IPA. Good carbonation. No complaints here.  D - This beer was very enjoyable and easy to drink. I liked it more and more as it went on.,Bear Republic Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,93
610,2751,popery,4.6,"Bear Republic makes really good beer. Racer 5 is really good beer. I would give it a perfect 5 if BeerAdvocate didn't break up scoring into categories. The beer isn't perfect in all categories, but it is greater than the sum of its quite excellent parts. Racer 5 should be on tap at every pizza place and burger joint in the country. It's perfectly balanced and probably the most drinkable beer that I've ever had. Usually, I'm able to ponder a beer as I write my review, but this 22oz bottle is already nearing its end.  The beer has a great color, a deep gold or light amber that pretty much nails my mental picture of how an IPA should look. The head could stick around a bit longer, but that's really quibbling over details. The beer smells good. It's not as overtly hoppy in taste or smell as Hop Rod Rye, Racer 5's cousin, but it has some nice citrus notes, which Hop Rod doesn't. I feel a bit silly talking about each category for this beer, so I'll sum up my feelings quickly. The taste is well-balanced and dry. The mouthfeel is very nice with great carbonation that plays an excellent supporting role. Finally, it's just exceptionally drinkable. The beer is sweet, hoppy and dry. The flavors don't linger and the bitter aftertaste is just right. For me, Racer 5 is a perfect storm of drinkability.",Bear Republic Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,93

The strong scent of grapefruit and pine strike the nose at first sniff, that is followed by the mellow fragrance of malt at the end. The malt comes out at the start of the taste, then it blends to an intense grapefruit, grassy, earthy bitterness takes over and dominates till the end. A thin watery feel at bthe front, it then gradually becomes more of a medium bodied feel.

610,2751,ClavinCliff,4.82,"Had this for the first time on draft in Virginia and have been on a quest to find a place to buy it. Picked a few bombers up in Webster, NY a few weeks back.  Pours a deep orangish copper color. Hazy in clarity. Nice white head forms right away. Very good head retention for the first few minutes, it then settles down to a nice lacing on top of the beer. A good floral smell, hops are right up front. Maybe a little fruity note, apricot, maybe hint of orange? Mouth feel, slightly sweet start but the hops kick in almost right away. Oily feel going through the mouth. Good bitter hops note but not too much, alcohol (7%) is well hidden but does help balance out the hops, you do feel the hops on your teeth between sips. All in all I had forgotten how much I love this beer. May need to stack it up against the 90 min when I get home in a battle royal for my top IPA. If you are a hop and IPA fanatic then go get one of some Racer 5, a supreme example of a West Coast IPA. I have got to figure out a way to get this stuff in GA.",Bear Republic Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,93
610,2751,Hullabaloo2,3.7,"Aroma - The first note that I get is a nice bouquet of floral, almost fruity hops. The fruit like aroma is not that of esters. This is by far the most dominate characteristic of the aroma, but the malt does come through. This aroma is not complex, but is still quite pleasant for the hop lover.  Appearance - A nice deep amber color with an eggshell colored head. The head poured about 1 finger width, but quickly dissipated to an uneven 1/4 finger width. The lacing is mediocre. There is a slight haze that appears to be from hop resins; always a welcome sign in an IPA. This gives clue that there will be an intense hop character to the flavor.  Taste - Very nice floral and spice hop flavor. The flavor of the hops is quite dominant, but the bitterness level is not very intense. The malt provides a nice balance to the hops, but doesn't make much of a showing in the front of the flavor. The hops are nicely balanced, but probably not intense enough for true hop heads. Some alcohol does make itself known.  Mouthfeel - Light to medium body with mid-level carbonation. There is no perceived alcohol, and the bitterness is on the lower end of the spectrum for an IPA. The beer goes down smooth. It is somewhat slick on the tongue. There is a small lingering bitterness, but this beer will not ""blow out"" your palate.  Overall Impression - This is a good IPA. It's very drinkable, and not overwhelming with hops, and bitterness. I see that as a detractor, but many others trying to develop a palate for hops, or who just aren't hop heads would probably love this IPA. The hop aroma, and flavor are very nice. For a 7% abv beer the alcohol is a little to noticeable. This is probably the biggest problem that I have with this beer. Long story short, solid, but nothing to write home about.",Bear Republic Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,93

S - Sweet caramel malt, and heavy floral and piny hops make up the nose. You can tell it's going to be a hoppy brew.  M - A medium-bodied beer with a smooth feeling complemented by the right amount of carbonation.  T - The sweeter malt hits first followed by some citrus and then a nice amount of floral hops leaving a slightly bitter taste. Not as hoppy as I expected for a west coast IPA, but balanced very nicely.  Racer 5 has a great taste without being too bitter giving it a nice drink-ability. Definitely give this one a try.",Bear Republic Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,93

These west coast brewers really make IPA's that are up my alley! A nice bit of citrus on the nose with a nice touch of sweetness. Just really enticing.  The taste is quite nice. Again, nice citrus quality and a splash of pine with a honey like sweetness as well. A gentle bitterness, nice to have it present in an IPA, and nice that it's not obnoxious.  Mouthfeel is medium bodied and nicely carbonated. Fine carbonation bubbles tickle the tongue, and help create a semi creamy brew.  Drinkability is fairly high.

Though freshness usually comes through more on taste, the smell that this beer gives off immediately leads the drinker down the path that the freshness of this beer is certainly what drives the quality of the offering.  The beer pours a medium body that is free from large amounts of carbonation. Once the head dissipates a bit, the body of the beer is very smooth and drinkable.  What really makes this IPA a true winner is what we all hope for in a beer, an amazing taste. The same hints of citrus that were present in the nose also come through in the taste in a big way up front but then quickly give way to a very spicy and hoppy complexity. Though the citrus emphasis is certainly present in the taste, as hoped for, the citrus merely complements the extensively hoppy flavor that truly is what will bring you back to this beer time and time again.  Racer 5 India Pale Ale is a well crafted west cost style IPA that is crafted brilliantly with the right amount hoppiness, which after all is what this beer is all about.",Bear Republic Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,93
610,2751,chiefydawg,4.27,"Poured into huge mug to hold all 22 oz (one pour). Hazy orange with suspensions of different shapes and sizes, mostly towards bottom. Being bottle conditioned, this does not bother me a bit. The head is solid and thin-to-medium, with the larger bubbles in the middle piling up higher than the finer bubbles along the periphery. Thin but consistent lacing.  Smells of orange rind with a dry earthy must and mild spicy notes. Sweet yeast scent comes up when shaken and sloshed a bit. A fruity cereal like Fruity Pebbles really comes to mind, which I haven't had in decades (glad I came up with that). Alcohol finally more detectable towards the end.  Citrus-dominated taste has a tempered bitterness that is nicely countered by the well-infused malt. Exceptionally balanced as any West Coast IPA. Is less complexed and hop bombed than I had anticipated. The 7% keeps its heat more subtle until the very end, and would be more difficult to detect at all in a pint. There is an underlying woodiness in there that I've been trying to pinpoint for awhile.  Smooth, soft mouthfeel for an IPA. Medium body. Very drinkable, plush, velvety, and smooth. So well balanced and tempered. Prolly the most drinkable IPA ever. I don't care about criteria - this is a session beer!",Bear Republic Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,93

610,2751,AKBelgianBeast,4.3,"Pours a clear orange/amber with a nice stark white fluffy head that leaves behind good lacing. Nose is pretty much all west coast hops with some slight hops. Taste follows with balls out west coast grapefruit and pine hop flavors. A subtle yet apparent malt presence here that provides a mild sweetness. Some small spice in here, but not much is noticed over the standard west coast hop bitterness. Mouthfeel is just on thick side here for a standard IPA as is the abv. drinkability is quite good. A very slammable IPA. Overall a very good brew, one of the better IPAs around, and one that Im sure would be a staple if it were locally available. Good Beer.",Bear Republic Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,93
610,2751,hwwty4,4.3,"Poured a 22oz bottle into my Smokestack goblet (3 pours). This beer pours a cloudy amber orange with a big fluffy white head that leaves hints of lacing as the head recedes. The aroma is spot on for a West Coast IPA. Big citrus notes with orange and grapefruit with just a hint of its malt backbone. The taste is much the same with citrusy hops dominating every other flavor, even living a biting bitterness coating your mouth. The mouthfeel is medium bodied and lightly carbonated but still very resiney.

M: Certainly not watered down. Just right and no resiny aftertaste.  D: Good taste and no overwhelming aftertastes give this a thumbs up.

610,2751,chuckd123,4.4,"Excellent IPA. Poured from a 12oz bottle, color is a dark, cloudy amber. Nice finger and a half head with good lacing.  Smell is very aromatic, kind of a floral, citrusy aroma. Malt is very faint, and flowery amoma is what you get first.  Taste is excellent - powerful, bold and very hoppy. Could pass for a double IPA easily, though alcohol is not overly present. Very complex, full flavor, not often seen outside of d-ipa's.  Mouthfeel is very good -- very light and smooth on the tongue, encourages you to drink more.  Drinkability -- excellent. Tastes much lighter and smoother than the dark cloudy appearance would suggest. I could get lost in several of these.  Some of my absolute favorite beers are double or imperial IPA's, and this is right up there in terms of flavor, hoppiness & taste.  Excellent, and worth a try (or several).",Bear Republic Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,93

A full pour meant a nice head that went on & on & on & on. Smell is entirely made up of hyper-aggressive hops.  Taste is also hyper-aggressive hops & strangely familiar. My wife made the call: Hopslam! Racer 5 tastes eerily similar to Hopslam, & that's a good thing. No alcohol heat, & not much depth, but for a hophead like myself, that's OK. Hops piled on hops piled on hops, with just a touch of a hoppy aftertaste. Works for me.  Very drinkable with very mild carbonation. Refreshing.

Beer pours a hazy, golden straw color. Spotty, dripping lace.  Smells of dusty, piney hops & citrus rind. Nothing special.  The taste is hop forward & a little unbalanced. Spicy & a little sharp on the front. Citrus backgrounds noted in the bitter, dry finish. Alcohol presence throughout.  Lighter bodied with ample carbonation. Crisp & tart with a manageable ABV.

A bit of particulate matter floating around in there but that may just be because of the moron at Binny's that put my bottle in the box upside down when I wasn't looking.  Aroma is west coast hops all the way. Nice and citrusy, a bit of pine, and a biscuity malt undertone.  Taste is more hops. A bit more piney than the aroma first suggests. The pine comes in first then I get a big kick of grapefruit-like citrus. Towards the finish there is a nice dose of sweet caramel and biscuity malt but that quickly gives in to the bitterness of the hops that coat the tongue in their oils and linger on.  Medium mouthfeel, good amount of carbonation.  Damn good IPA, just enough malt to keep it from being overly bitter, just where I like it. Good stuff.",Bear Republic Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,93

The head slowly dropped to leave a patchwork of clumpy lace down the glass.  S= The nose of this one was almost totally hops with a slight whiff of alcohol in the end. The hop aromas were of the West Coast variety - citrus and slight pine.  T= This ale doesn't waste any time before getting right to the bitter hops. Again, grapefruit citrus hop flavors dominate. I found the malt a bit under-strength, giving this ale a bit of an unbalanced flavor. There was also a slight alcohol warming in the super dry finish.  MF= This ale felt good on the tongue, with an appropriately lightish body and hop oiliness. Carbonation was dead on.

The head is about 1 inch and dissipates quickly; there is some lacing that does evaporate over time. The nose did contain some banana ester following a 10 minute temperature acclimation. (It was served rather cold - another factor to consider.) There was a noticable hint of orange as well and this was followed by a hearty hop aftertaste, one that lingers upon the tongue.  All in all, a fine IPA. Though my particular pint was a little less overwhelming than anticipated, I have had superb brews from this Left Coast craft brewer.

Pours a cloudy apricot color with a generous creamy white head with little retention but lovely lacing all around.  S: strong hoppy aroma up front followed by a barrage of citrus fumes.  T: hop heavy as it first hits your lips with a bitter, piney acidity that gives way to an array of citrusy flavors.

This does in spades. Sweet, acidic , butterscotch, grapefruit. Splash! I'm swimming in hops! Tops in my book.  M: It's creamy. The carrot stick aftertaste is spot on. The bitter in the mouth, spot on. This is as four as it gets.  T: Lagunitas makes a beer so hoppy, it is like drinking liquid hops. I love it, but it lacks some of the complexities that makes a truly awesome IPA. This has those elements. Alcohol mixes well as grapefruity hops make the bitter, mix with carrot stick and thick malt and add a glowing, sweet, floral orange touch, and you have a damn good bottle.  D: Yep.

Though it was nicely balanced by some really sweet bready malts. The hops were quite floral & piney. The interplay between the sweet malts and hops is fantastic  Taste is outstanding. Very sticky/resiny/piney hop flavors leap out and dance a grandiose jig! A definite and strong hop bitterness that is wonderfully balanced with a great sweet malt flavor. Perfect combo. Wonderfully clean/smooth hop bitterness.  It's full bodied and heavy on the palate but with good carbonation to keep it lively.  Drinkability? It's good.

Unintentional conservative pour leaves a very small head which quickly runs for cover but also leaves behind some nice lacing on the glass. Beautiful burnt auburn color. The nose on this is pretty nice, A little toffee smell from the malt comes through with a nice enchanted forest pineyness and a slight soapy smell.  Nice caramel malt upfront, Then a fantastic grapefruity hop rush, Which then shifts into second gear with an even more intense bitterness then finishes off with a mild sweetness. .

A rather pale golden colour with a good head that subsides and leaves moderate lacing. Plenty of aroma on raising the glass to the nose and a powerful hit of flavour on the tongue, but it retains a degree of sublety. Slightly oily mouthfeel, but not bad for that.

As this beer pours from a 12 oz bottle I'm immediately greeted with a wonderful pine-like aroma. I can't wait to settle into this one. As I finish pouring I am left with an inch of tiny micro-bubbled foam, reminiscent of egg whites. Retention lasts less than a minute. Lacing is nice and sticky. AS expected the piney hops are very evident in the aroma. This has a really mellow flavor profile with a nice bitter bite at the end.

610,2751,BEERchitect,4.47,"I am very impressed with this brewery so far. Not distributed to my area, I have to pick these up when I travel to Ohio. So far, every beer from this brewery has been finely attenuated, but rich in proteins and all have supurb head retention / formation. Racer X is no exception. The onset brings a rich, but clean looking copper / amber color, thick foamstand, and lively co2. The beer takes on a rich, biscuity malt character in the aromas and flavors. I was really impressed with the clean attenuation, with no harshness-- a perfect balance. Great hop balance for IPA-- I would prefer a stronger sharper hop influence, but I think I got an aged bottle where the hops have settled out a bit. At any rate, this is a truely expressive, hop-oriented IPA. Citrus notes hinge more on oranges than grapefruits due to the sturdy malt base and ester profile. Very full to the palate, again close to a Double IPA. The finish is very clean, crisp, and cracker-like, but with a long dry hop flavor and a touch of caramel. An extremely nice beer. I'll take a few points off because of the sediment in the bottle which may come from too much age, but look forward to trying a fresher bottle.",Bear Republic Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,93

I thought I was trying something less popular. The beer pours a golden amber with lots of carbonation, a foamy head, some retention and lacing. The aroma is all hop, juicy, estery, oily hop. There are grapefruit notes and florals too. You can whiff a bit of biscuity malt if you try. The taste is a blast of pungent, citrusy hop, with plenty of estery and oily resinous hop as well. There is a nice creamy backbone to the beer that balances out the hop bite. The grapefruit like tartness and the malty breadiness in the rear make this a fine offering. The beer is quite well carbonated, very refreshing, lots of effervescence, and just nice all around. The aftertaste is about right, not too mild, not too lingering.

610,2751,MrMonkey,4.15,"Pours a clear golden amber with a three-finger pillowy off-white head that fades real slowly leaving lots of sticky lace behind. Great retention.  Smell is nothing but hops. Lots of floral notes and juicy citrus fruit: fresh squeezed OJ, lemon zest and grapefruit.  Taste is dominated by floral and citrus hops, but there are notes of toasted bread and a faint toffee-like sweetness. Finishes dry with a grapefruit bitterness.  Medium, well carbonated mouthfeel. Very crisp and dry.  Very drinkable and very enjoyable. Another IPA I wish was available in NH.",Bear Republic Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,93
610,2751,Homerbag,4.27,"Clear amber body with foamy head.  An old school Mike Tyson uppercut of citric hops assault the nose. If this had a tooth or two, it would bite your ear off. Second fiddle is some more resiny/woody hops. Straight forward with no room for malts or anything, this is a hop and hop alone. Taste is much the same, no malts just juicy hops. A hop heads dream. This is wreak your palate for any other beers that would follow . Feel is suprisingly thin for so many hops, no sticky or oily felling. Very rarely do I saw an IPA needs more malts, but this could use a pinch. I'm not complaining at all. I love the assaut, but some malts could frame this and make it even more punchy.",Bear Republic Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,93
610,2751,RixBeer,4.12,Peach juice. Hazy thick orange with a thin white head. Fades into a thick ring along the edges.  A very sharp grapefruit and citrus punch with a strong pininess.  A very forceful and persistent hop flavor. Pretty spicy and has a strong punch of hops.  A tiny bit watery in the end but it helps balance the hops.  A very drinkable IPA and one that I really do appreciate for what it is. However the ABV will actually shock you. It creeps up on you.,Bear Republic Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,93
610,2751,TheBCrew,4.32,"Split a 22oz bomber with allthetimeineed. Pours a pale amber color, slightly hazy due to dry hopping. Two fingers of white head slowly dissipates slowly leaving plenty of lacing. Aroma is hop forward, very flowery, citrusy and somewhat sweet. Flavor to match: floral, citrus, sweet pine and a dry finish. Somewhat heavy mouthfeel with good drinkability. Typical example of the West Coast hop bombs that I love.",Bear Republic Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,93
610,2751,sloejams,4.63,"I'm not sure how I've never reviewed this beer seeing as now that it is in 6 pack form - it's pretty much a staple in my refrigerator.

You have probably had one by now - if not go get one now.",Bear Republic Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,93
610,2751,corey0212,4.65,"This has been one of my ""go to"" IPAs for a while, and it never disappoints!  Pours a clear, golden/orange color, with a tremendous rocky off-white head, which stays put! Leaves behind a ton of lacing. Smell is piney, with a good amount of sweet malt in the nose. Taste is beautifully balanced, the citrus & pine of the hops duke it out with the malty goodness. Nice bitter & slightly floral finish. Incredibly drinkable IPA, and in terms of what I have easy access to, quite possibly the best.",Bear Republic Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,93
610,2751,AmishT,4.2,"Poured into pint glass  A - Great off-white head that retains excellently and leaves a ton of lacing behind. Golden/amber in color. Translucent.  S - A very nice floral, citrusy hop aroma is very prevalent. Some grain in the background. A faint malt backbone is also detectable.  T&M - Initial flavor is delicious and balanced. The citrus hops blend very well with the bready malt backbone. Honestly, I'd say that malts win out. However, the hops reassert themselves with a floral and bittering finish. Medium to full bodied. Appropriate carbonation level. The bitterness that coats the palate seems to build with every sip; it's not the most pleasant bitterness, but it doesn't bother me too much - it's just there. The flavor is bold and endures very well. From the nose, I expected a more hoppy flavor, but it's a pleasant one, nevertheless.  D - I feel that this is a very drinkable brew. The abv is a little on the higher side, and it is a bit of a fuller body, but it is tasty and, to me, not difficult to drink.",Bear Republic Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,93
610,2751,BamaBeerBuff,4.32,"A: A golden/orange amber with some yeasty haze. The head is thick and frothy, and settles slowly to a thin frothy covering overhead. Some nice sheets and rings of lace form down the whole glass.  S: Bold citrus hops. Some faint bready/biscuity malt aroma.  T&M: Pleasant hoppy grapefruit, some grainy biscuit malt, and an earthy, musky and bitter finish. Everything's top-class until the finish--it's just not as pleasant as I would like. Body is medium with a brisk carbonation and a lightly oily feel.  D: Racer 5 is a top-notch American IPA. It's higher ABV and less-than-pleasant finish limit drinkability somewhat, but Racer 5 is still a damn fine example of the style.",Bear Republic Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,93
610,2751,becktone,4.55,"From notes:  Eye: Great head sixe and retention. Color is off white, tannish tones in there. Color of the beer itself is orangy-amber with yellow hints, very clear and alive with carbonation. One good looking IPA. How come beers at bars don't look this good? Well I think its the sanitizer, though I don't see any lacing here.  Nose: Very nice, citrus flower aroma right up front. This is what I want from an IPA. Glorious, Glorious hops. There is some malt to support, but it can't discern what its attributes are. I just know that there is a a smell behind the hops(that doesn't belong to hops or yeast)that supports them. Just great with the hops, overall..wonderful.  Tongue: Bitterness hits the palate first then a wave of hp flavors-citrus, floral, and some fruit. Like the aroma the malt flavor isn't too pronounced, but its there to support and give substance to the hops, which make up the rest of the beverage. Finish is bitter and tastes of citrus hops. Its interesting to note how the citrus flavor of the hops mix with the sweet malt to create a real unique sweet(not in terms of palate) flavor profile found here.e  Mouthfeel and Drinkability: This is one I'll buy again, what a great IPA. Goes down smooth and the higher level of alcohol is hidden quite nicely. Carbonation at first seemed a bit high and too prickley, but is actually quite fitting given the characteristics for the rest of the beer. This is one tot try, get out there and find it. I'll most likely be getting this again, most likely when I'm in the mood for a good IPA. One of the better IPAs I've drank.",Bear Republic Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,93

T- Citrus hops mainly a grapefruit, then a piney/floral hop taste and then a bit of malt. Hops are the dominant flavour here.  M- Medium in body with a good carbonation. Very smooth and a little creamy.  D- A very nice and solid brew. Will be picking some more of this up.",Bear Republic Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,93

S: Big citrusy hops right up front, but not as strong as some other west coast IPAs.  T: Huge grapefruity flavors show up immediately. By mid-mouth, the malt starts to balance out the flavor, but hops dominate throughout.  M: Moderate carbonation helps lift the hop bitterness off the tongue. Overall feel is fairly creamy without being slick.  D: A really refreshing IPA...

Smell is lighter than I expected but I do pick up some grassy hops in the background. Some malt hints as well. Very lightly carbonated.  Much more balanced and integrated than I expected. Lovely, consistant hops notes throughout. The aftertaste has something spritzy that I can't identify. Seems to last for 10-15 seconds.  The light balance makes this extremely drinkable.

Smell is strong of hops but there is a definite malt presence as well, a bit of caramel. Taste is good, however I have to say I was expecting more hops. Hops are there but I think I noticed the malt a little more, especially as the beer warmed. Leaves an oily bitterness as it goes down and slight warming effect from the alcohol. Medium mouthfeel.

Takes lacing to a new art form with sheets of sticky froth that languish throughout the session.  Floral hoppy nose with aromas of pine and citrus.  Opens with a malty sweetness that quickly transitions to a sharp and bitter middle. Moves on to notes of pine, grapefruit and citrus rinds. Finishes crisp and bitter. Overall, a nicely balanced amalgam of bitter hops and sweet malt.  Chewy mouthfeel. Smooth and sessionable.

It looks like a pancake ready to be flipped!  Smell is extremely citrusy. Think lemons and grapefruits, not to mention fresh cascade hops. I love the way those Pacific Northwest hops can transform the smell of a beer from casual to just plain amazing.  First sip of this beer is tongue numbing. Absolute hop bitterness. Tastes like fresh squeezed grapefruit juice with a cane sugar finish to balance things out. This beer is very refreshing. Its hard not to take big sips of this. I should have bought a second bottle so I could savor the tastes of that one and drank this one in big mouthfuls like the hop pig that I am.

Big hop aroma. You name a citrus aroma and I bet you'll find it in here. Slight sweetness but it's hard to get through those hops.  Taste - By the aroma I was expecting more citrus tones. I taste mostly grapefruit with a little orange. It starts off big but mellows out quickly. Seems to be missing something to set it over the edge like the aroma suggests. Good bitterness, could even do slightly more. Ends slightly dry.  Mouthfeel - Light to medium body, good carbonation.  Overall, I cant get enough of this aroma! It's a truly amazing hop aroma profile. However, the taste just doesnt live up to the hype the aroma sets forth. Still a very good beer and one I will definately go back to.

Flavors of Grapefruit/orange peel, a little pine and some honey/caramel maltiness on the front of the tongue. Good mouthfeel. It sticks around, but in a good way. Fairly drinkable in that the palate is not so overwhelmed that it will be tired after one of these. At 7% this is not a session beer, but not so over the top that you'll be slurring your words after 2. Very good beer and it's not just hop tea with some alcohol. Very well rounded for a West Coast IPA.",Bear Republic Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,93

Very minor piney notes, and a slight earthy malt in the back.  Very well balanced flavor of citrus, pine, bready malts. Nothing overpowering, all of them well defined and a good progress from one to another.  A nice amount of carbonation, smooth, medium body leaning towards light, finishes dry.

Appearance- Beer pours a hazy golden yellow with a creamy one and a half finger cap of foam, lacing clings lightly to the sides and carbonation rises from the bottom of the glass.  Smell- Amarillo, Simcoe, and Centennial hops rise forward. A strong orangey citrus flows into the nostrils. Light malts linger but the hops dominate. Cascade hops are likely in the ale as well.  Taste- Creamy and quite thick with citrus and a light soapy character. I taste Simcoe, Amarillo, Cascade and just a bit of Centennial pine in the finish. Very light an effervescent.  Mouthfeel- Creamy, medium bodied, well carbonated, not astringent and effervescent.  Drinkability- Nicely drinkable. Bear Republic's best effort yet.

D - Not my favorite. Actually does remind me of throat medicine somewhat.

Smell contains a slight bit of pine needles, but really balanced by a heap of sweetness of malt. Lots of sweetness, richness and theres always a bitter side hanging on the background but really only stays there on the back of the palate. Only a slight bit of spice to the ""piney"" side to this balanced IPA. This beer is 100% a school girl that is smart as hell and down for doing work, and always good to bring to your parents house.

610,2751,Metalmonk,4.62,"Label offers the brewery's motto ""bigger is better"". While that's not always the case, I will never argue to the contrary. ""Bigger"" definitely describes the head I got from the pour, a huge fluffy cap of cream on top of what the label very correctly describes as ""golden"". Easy enough.  Aroma is a thing of wonder, especially if hops are your thing. Big piney presence in the nose, with plenty of malty sweetness balancing it out, and lighter, more delicate flowery spices dotting the aroma. Almost a gingerbread thing lurking around there somewhere.  Flavor is generally big, rich, tingly and sweet. If you know the finest IPAs and Double IPAs, then you'll know what this is all about. This is a DIPA-leaning IPA, with the hops winning out in assertiveness and sharpness over the gooey malts that try their best to balance. Nice spicy/herbal accents throughout. Malty sweetness carries over into the finish, rich and caramel-like. Then once again trumped by a sharp layer of prickly, piney hops.  Mouthfeel is maybe a little too tingly, perhaps a little rough for the richness of flavor. Because it almost tastes like a double IPA, I expected that level of creaminess, but this is actually drier and more like your typical IPA...but there is enough buttery roundness to give a hint of creaminess.  Really, really good IPA, one of the best ever, up there with Bell's, Stone, and Green Flash versions of the style (among exalted others).

This is the first time I have ever used that term in a review but that is what I smell. Caramelized malts and strong hoppy tones round out the nose.  T- Nice and bitter with some sweetness from the malts. Citrusy and earthy tastes make it more complex and different.  M- Oily and medium thickness with medium carbonation.  D- Little too sweet and bitter (making it rich) for a session beer, but outstanding for a stand alone drink.  Overall- Very good brew. I am impressed and would definitely seek this one out.

T - More of a complex palate with noticable bitter hops, semi-sweet floral and citrus flavors and a lasting formitable after taste reminds you this is a great IPA.

The aroma is a typically wonderful fresh, floral, fruity, citrusy hop burst. On the palate there is a fruitiness up front, with a sweetness that doesn't cloy, isn't really sweet actually, just serves to perfectly balance an experience of complex hop flavors that come on citrus and fruit, finishing with pine and flowers. Classicly near-perfect West Coast IPA, closely resembles Stone to me (need to try these side-by side). Great effort, wonderfully drinkable beer.

Aggressive floral notes that have been punched in the face with a grapefruit.  Flavor: Bold hoppy flavor up front that dies off little bit but picks up in to big and beautiful finish. Very floral on the finish, dries out and becomes a lingering soft bitter.  Mouth Feel: Up front is a distinct west coast hoppyness that coast the mouth.

Pours a dark amber color with a fairly thin lacing. Piney aroma which is quite suggestive of its overall taste.  I particularly enjoy IPA's and this one seems to be somewhere between a typical IPA and a Double IPA. 7% alcohol but very balanced with a clean and bitter finish. Definitely hoppy but maybe not to the extent of some West Coast IPA's.

I was at the Dogfish Head brewpub in Rehoboth Beach, MD recently and had their 90 minute IPA that had been put through ""Randall the Enamel Animal"" (look it up if you don't know of it). I had never tasted a brew with such a fresh hop smell and taste. This glass of Racer 5 was second to that. It was so fresh tasting (pine, herbaceous hop scent) that I had to ask if they had a Randall (the used to, but don't anymore).

T: This one had quite a complex taste, though it was dominated by hops. There was a faint taste of citrus (orange?) and a hint of malt to balance things out.

This is followed by sweet malt aromas. The taste is of big grapefruit hops, some tropical fruit, pepper. Some malt sweetness to help try and balance. The feel is moderate with soft to fizzy carbonation, finishes with a big bitter bite. Also has a bit of a slick feel to it. Really reminds me of a DIPA without the bigger ABV. Definitely a very hoppy AIPA and a great call for any hop-head. Big on grapefruit and tropical fruit hops. Only negative is that it is a bit slick.",Bear Republic Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,93
610,2751,deepsouth,4.37,"this beer poured a golden color with a straw colored head that receded pretty quickly leaving scattered patches of thin head all around the top of the beer. WOW, this beer smells good. citrusy hops, grapefruit, lightly peppery fragrances dominate the nose. the citrusy hops EXPLODE in your mouth from jumpstreet, but leaves with just the right amount of sweetness to make you want to take another sip. this beer BEGS to be drank. fortunately, at 7% you can get a little reckless with them without paying high prices. not to mention, at under $5 a bomber, this things a steal. the mouthfeel is nice and suits this style beer and i could drink one after another until i passed out. another fine offering from bear republic, which has proven to me that they make all their beers very well.",Bear Republic Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,93
610,2751,JohnGalt1,4.42,"12oz brought over tonight by SAS while we were packing up a couple boxes for trade... my half from my New Belgium snifter.  3/4"" head.. left good lacing.. hazy honey colored brew (I got the bottom half) ..  Aroma is C-hops all the way around.. it smells fresh... grapefruit .. slight but present pale malts.. with touches of yeasty fruitiness.  WOW! Flavor is big even for a CA IPA. Big grapefruit and Flintstone vitamin hops (only way I can describe it).. fruity and a little minerally at the same time. Nearly absurdly big hop flavors squash the pale malts that are present.. I am getting just enough sweetness to balance the big bitterness. Fairly thick mouthfeel for the style but the oily hoppiness lends to a pleasant slickness ... but I am definitely not complaining. Finish is a long fruity hoppiness.  Racer 5 would be a staple in my home if I had access... definitely verges on DIPA territory.. but still utterly fantastic... I could drink this until my palate was long blown.. but I would somehow try to find a way to slink one more in.

No head and teeny bit of lacing. Smell&gt; wheat, hops, berries Taste&gt;Characteristic of an American IPA. Starts sweet and innocent, punches hoppy goodness at you, smoothes a bit but leaves you with a resiny hang. Good balance of bitterness in the back and the slightest sweetness at the front.

610,2751,CrellMoset,4.23,"Reviewed on draught at McGrady's Irish Pub in Charlottesville, VA.  Appearance: A thick, foamy head sits atop a gorgeous, slightly-hazy-but-largely-translucent orange amber body. Active carbonation drifts upward through the thick looking haze, and splatters of sticky, web-like lacing speckle the sides of the glass. Wonderful.  Aroma: There's some lightly toasted malt here, a very mellow caramel backbone. Now that that's out of the way ... let's talk about the hops. There's a lot of potent sharpness in the nose, no doubt from the Columbus, but there's also a lot of pleasant, lighter aromatics - citrus, ethereal herbal and floral notes. A very intense and oily nose.  Taste: The bitterness is pretty consistent throughout - it hits strong at first, and definitely rounds out each sip as well. The sweetness of the bready malt is more noticeable in the mouth than it was in the nose - although I wouldn't go so far as to call it ""balanced"" - and that's a good thing, or else this beer might be less drinkable than it is. As far as individual hop flavors, yeah, it's all there - pungent grapefruit and pineapple flavors are all wrapped up in the bitterness, as well as a few other earthy, woody notes. Alcohol is only faintly detectable.  Mouthfeel: One word. Perfect. An amazing feeling beer - it's silky smooth, finely carbonated, medium bodied. ""Oily"" is a word that comes to mind, but that has a lot of negative connotations, so, yeah, anyway, it's fantastic.  Drinkability: Pretty damn good. It's bitter, sure, but it's not just a hop bomb - it's sweet, lightly toasty, floral, fragrant, smooth, citrusy, etc. etc. etc. In essence, there's a lot of good stuff going on in this glass, and I could put away a few of these and enjoy every minute of it, no problem.  One of my favorite IPAs, this beer is absolutely rock solid. I just realized that I typed that I could put away a few of these, no problem, and although that's probably true, I would advise doing that on a full stomach, and not before you need to drive anywhere. Either way, this is a delicious beer. It's coarse and rough in taste, but smooth in the mouthfeel; it's sweet and dense in its foundation, but crisp, fruity, and floral in a big way up front; and it's typically pretty inexpensive. A sure bet.",Bear Republic Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,93
610,2751,ibrewaletx,4.23,"Was a coppery golden hue with a head that fairly quickly disappeared. Good lacing. The distinctive smell of pine and maybe some citrus stuck out in the beer. A very strong hop bite and after the initial bite, it seemed to smooth out in the mouth for a great overall taste. This was very drinkable, but of course as any good IPA, it was tough to move on to a non hoppy non IPA following this - burned my taste buds a little!",Bear Republic Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,93
610,2751,TheIPAHunter,4.04,"12 oz. bottle poured into my free ""Taste Victory"" pint. Thanks, Julio's Liquors!  She's a fiery blonde with a 1/2"" of froth resting comfortably above the haze. Retains slightly above average; lacing is minimal and spotty.  Talk about hoppy. Clean citrus smacks the senses while a breaded malt aroma holds its position in the background. Faint floral aromatics with a touch of alcohol coming through.  Bitter hops, tangerines, grapefruit, apricots and orange peel. The malt character is there, but it's overwhelmed by the hops. I'm impressed with the effort, but it could use some balance between the front and back ends. Slightly too alcoholic for my taste.  Mouth is dry; the bitterness has staying power. I wouldn't have minded a bit more texture, and not feeling somewhat parched despite consuming the entire offering.  I've drank Racer 5 on multiple occasions, just not in succession. I would probably score higher if it weren't for the alcohol feel. I don't mind the ABV at 7%; there are plenty of awesome brews much higher. The balance is a bit lacking for my palate, which is why I don't enjoy it more. That said, it is loaded with hops, and that's worth being thankful for.",Bear Republic Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,93
610,2751,SPLITGRIN,3.93,"A strong pour generates an inch and a half of rocky light tan head with solid retention. Body is a hazy straw orange that leans almost twords amber. A quarter inch of wavy lace is left behind. You really pick up the nose on the pour with soft creamy hop notes that have an almost chewy character to them. Maybe a bit of sweet sap also. The first thing that grabs me about this beer is the drinkability of it, it is odd to notice so soon on the palate. A balance of dandilion like hops mixed with a nutty mineral zest that stays on the mouthfeel. This is a dry woodsy IPA with almost no sweetness, which is must how the style should be. Alchol is right on at 7%. Clean and refreshing while being longly bitter. A super IPA that really hits the tongue.",Bear Republic Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,93

A good hops aroma...slight citrus and a slight floral.  A descent tasting IPA. The hops is not overpowering but still leaves that yummy hoppy aftertaste. A good balanced IPA.  A good tasting IPA in my book. I'll buy thin again.,Bear Republic Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,93

T - Like an overhopped pale ale, not a very good IPA. No complexity to the hop character, just unpleasant bitterness.  M - Thin for an IPA, light carbonation.  D - I didn't want to finish my 22 oz. bottle.  I was really looking forward to this beer as I have heard many good things about the brewery. I was very disappointed.",Bear Republic Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,93

(No notes on the appearance or smell, so I've simply rated them as average.)  This had a light yeasty taste with tons of hops in the aftertaste. It was more of a pine flavor rather than citrus hops, and the texture was great. The bitterness was almost overpowering - a hophead's dream - making this a decent sipping IPA, but could be difficult for the average enthusiast to enjoy.

The aroma is quite hoppy with fresh grapefruit notes, piney esters, light malt, and a touch of alcohol behind it.  The taste is a assertive piney hop bitterness mixed with a splash of grapefruit citrus that only seems to become more pronounced as it warms. This is nicely balanced by a backbone of sweet bready malt that helps temper all the bitterness. The mouthfeel is medium bodied with an oily texture and easy feel to it.  A very solid West Coast IPA. It has a very pronounced hoppiness to it but the citrus element and malt really help keep things in check and make this one hugely sessionable affair.",Bear Republic Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,93

The head formed a creamy 1 finger thick and retained nicely and clung to the sides of the glass.  Aroma: Floral and citrus hops, very enticing.  Taste: The hops almost seemed to attack my tastebuds from the beginning. Nice combination of piney and citrus hops with the citrus getting stronger throughout. There was a nice bready maltiness that remained in the background but balanced nicely. The finish was all hops, mainly citrus, and lingered for a while.  Mouthfeel: Medium bodied, fairly smooth. The carbonation was more lively than the appearance let on, and balanced out well.  Overall: If you like big hoppy IPAs you'll love this one.

610,2751,eberkman,4.48,"Pours a gorgeous honey-hued amber poured out of a 12-oz bottle resplendent with Bear Republic's trademark D.C.-comic-style lettering. Produces a firm, sticky head that barely reduces, leaving ample lacing in the glass when swirled. You get a bit of yeast when you pour the last few drops. A crapload of yeast coating the bottom of the bottle. How am I going to clean this one out as I save bottles for our next homebrew batch?  Big Cascade hop aroma -- pretty much a grapefruit party with some piney and floral notes as well. A slight sweetness to the smell reveals some malt presence, previewing the potential for a complex, well-balanced beer.  The taste is something to behold -- a big sweet honeystung malt up front giving way to ample citrusy (read = grapefruit. I'm detecting no lemon, lime, orange, tangerine or pomelo here. This is some serious grapefruity goodness) hops and a strong bitterness in the finish that seems to live on for an eternity (or at least until the next sip). Honestly, this is a HUGE beer for a standard American IPA. Almost encroaching on DIPA territory, but not quite.  Mouthfeel is slightly slick but with a tingly fizz on the top of the tongue. Not heavy, but certainly has its presence.  Interesting enough to session -- as much as any other West Coast IPA. Which means give me a couple before I move over to something else. Because, let's face it. You don't drink an IPA all night. In any event, it reminds me a little of Stone with its level of balance.  Better than I hoped for -- I'd like to have more of these. Think of it as a big glass of ruby-red grapefruit juice that'll give you a nice buzz. Which is a wonderful thing.",Bear Republic Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,93

S: a huge sweet pink grapefruity aroma which was smooth and well rounded by nature.  T: sweet/bitter pungent grapefruit that was semi-dry with some dry floral. The hoppiness was very well rounded, grapefruity, and fresh, with a semi-dry floral finish with hints of lemon and sweet citrus, which was incredibly smooth and refined and not at all rough or coarse like others per style. What I really enjoyed was the balance between the bittering/flavor/aroma hopping. The beer had a great strong aroma to start things off. The palate was dominated by the sweet citrusy hop flavor that was very smooth with the bittering hops coming through in the finish, leaving a nice citrusy floral fade on the tongue.  M: medium fullness with a very dry pungent grapefruit and floral hopping and lacing coming through upon warming.  D: Overall great drinkability, even if your not a big hophead.

It poured a slightly hazy dark orange color, with about a half inch of head that decided not to stick around for too long. Very spicey and fruity in the nose. when I took the first sip, the spiciness was almost overwhelming. The spiciness evolved into a simple bitter and finished nice and sweet. The beer was very crisp and sharp on the tounge. I could see myself having a couple of these before switching to something else.

Clean and fresh citrus hop aroma with a toasted maltiness lying in the background. Grapefruit, lemon, and orange really shine.  Big juicy citrus kicks things off. Nice slap of hop bitterness. Grapefruit, orange, and lemon all come through. Hops are balanced well by the toasted grain and biscuity maltiness. Alcohol barely shows up at all. Flavors meld very well and the beer is nicely balanced. Very smooth flavors. Finishes with lingering hop bitterness and lemon zest.  Medium-full bodied, smooth, and a little creamy. Not too crisp, but not heavy either. Great drinkability - could definitely stick with this one for a while.

Huge fluffy off white head, excellent retention, leaving tons of sticky lace.  Aroma has some toasted malt, but is mostly orange and tangerine citrus.  Flavor has enough malt to balance things out, but is dominated by the citrus hop notes. Finish has pretty standard grapefruit bitterness, which is moderate and lasts into the aftertaste.  Medium body, moderate carbonation. Good balance. Almost a little bit on the chewy or oily side in terms of mouthfeel. Almost leaning towards being slightly full bodied...I wouldn't call it crisp, which I generally prefer in a basic IPA. Pretty much a good standard IPA, though.

The bitterness has plenty of sweet grain backing to tie things together and smooth it out.  Alcohol is well-hidden in sharpness, but adds a roundedness to it.  Balanced despite an assertive hop presence.  Finishes bitter with a peek of sweetness.  At first, I was going to say it's not quite full-bodied, but then I remembered this is an IPA, not a DIPA, which this almost reaches.  It is full-bodied enough, though, and quite chewy.

610,2751,JerzDevl2000,4.18,"Picked this up around Christmastime as a reward for me getting through my first semester back to school. I never had a bad beer from Bear Republic and this has held true to that rule. However, those expection a hop explosion or wallop from this will be disappointed. This is more along the line of a Pale Ale along the lines of Sierra Nevada, but disregarding that, this is one of the better brews that I've had in a long time!  This poured a beautiful goldenrod with a thick head and the smell of west coast hops to it. There's lacing to this, but it's not anything to write home about. Once this hit my mouth, that's where the real strength of this beer came out. There's a very strong pine and resin base to this, with some lemon/citrus and buttery undertones to this. Unlike Sierra Nevada, this isn't floral and there's not resin here. It's thinner, lighter, and less metallic than Chico's hallmark of West Coast beers but nevertheless, this is very solid and enjoyable. There isn't much of an aftertaste here either, but the pine and metallic notes subtly linger!  The 7.00% ABV are about the closest that this beer will get to being an IPA. This isn't overpowering, but it's about as solid as this style gets and was quite a sight to behold as the tiny bubbles and clarity combined to form a near perfect image of what a beer should look like. Bear Republic's hit another homer with this beer, even though I still wish it was classified as a style more appropriate to it's taste. Nevertheless, like SN, Stone, and Anchor, this is another reason why I'm grateful for beers from the Golden State being available in this neck of the woods.

The hop aroma is very strong and welcoming.  Really nice piney hop flavor. Warming alcohol. Carmel and toffee malt flavors are there, but subdued by the over-the-top hops. Really nice. Lingering oily hop flavor and malty sweetness on the lips is really nice.  Full bodied, oily mouthfeel. Substantial.

Aroma is strong in the hop oils, some citrus and pine sap in there with a touch of brown sugar. Taste was a bit of a letdown. The hops are there and there's a bitter aftertaste but none of the flavors really jump out. There doesn't seem to be enough malt to offset what is essentially a hop concoction. Beer has a nice bitter aftertaste but it also slightly watery.  I'm a bit disappointed with this brew, I was hoping for a big-hop experience, but i though it paled in comparison to their Hop Rod and XP, both of which were superior.

Pours a hazy amber color with one finger of creamy white head that left sheets of lacing on the walls of my imperial pint glass. The smell of this beer hit me as I was pouring it. Big scents of citrus fruit and an earthy grassy scent that both equally vie for your attention. A slight bit of sweet malt is also trying to make itself known on the nose as well. The flavor profile is a duel battle between the sweet caramel malt and the citrus and pine flavor of the hops. Neither flavor dominates each other and this flavor profile is well crafted and well made. The mothfeel is a bit thin, but overall it is medium bodied with lower than average carbonation. The drink ability on this beer is impressive, and it leaves me wanting Bear Republic in Indiana.",Bear Republic Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,93
610,2751,Jmamay22,3.95,"Pours a clear orange gold color with large bubbles of carbonation rising to the surface to support a ecru thin head. Leaves plenty of sticky gobs of lacing no doubt due to the hops.  Soft hints of grapefruit and flowers hit the nose. Doesn't smack you in the face like other IPAs.  Reserved hop bill compared to other American versions of the same style. Very balanced with bitter citrus and bready almost caramel like biscuits. Finishes with a sticky bitter aftertaste. Doesn't blow me away, but instead comes off as beautifully balanced. A welcome respite from the overly hopped versions I've grown too used to.  Mouthfeel comes off as smooth, but I'm reaching out for a slight amount more carbonation or perhaps finer carbonation. I'm nitpicking though. Drinkability is very high given the balance. No hint of the alcohol in the nose or taste. While this will not blow you away it won't offend either. Can serve as a great introduction to IPAs.",Bear Republic Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,93
610,2751,SurlyDuff,4.48,"Almost clear (just a tad haze) orange amber. I then sloshed around the dregs and to my surprise a good viscous clump of yeasty goodness pours into my glass. I really love a good bottle-conditioned IPA! I suppose there are two sides to this debate, and i'm on the side that likes the yeasty dregs.  Head retention is stellar. After 15 minutes (was cooking dinner) i came back to see a consistant, though thin, head still remaining.  Aroma is mild at fridge temperature. Earthy floral hops. Dried leaves, hay, grapefruit, pear, melon there too. Got stronger after the 15 minute warming-up hiatus.  Decent carbonation and mouthfeel. A bit toned down compared to some other west coast ipa's. Not too strong with resin/sticky hops. Great balance!",Bear Republic Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,93
610,2751,barefootbrewer,4,"This beer poured a hazy yellow/orange with a huge rocky head. The aroma is fresh and green - big hop nose. The taste is bitter and citrus like with a balancing sweetness.

Foamy, citrusy, hoppy, lively, a cluster bomb of aromatic and taste explosions ripping from my nose to my lips to my tongue to my sinuses to my gullet.

Impressive head for an IPA.  Nose is full and juicy, with plenty of earthy caramelly malt, brightened by grapefruit, peach, and pear fruitiness. A syrupy sugary sweet overtone rounds it all out.  Taste is lightly sweet, with biscuity grains and a good dose of lighter malts for an overall full taste. Not to be deceived, this IPA has plenty of hops, but they balance well with the overall body and flavor of the beer. Earthy resin cuts through the malt, along with citrusy fruit. A dry bitterness rises nicely at the finish.  Smooth medium-thick body for an IPA. Great characteristic stickiness and oily mouthfeel.  A very tasty version of an IPA, attractive, aromatic, and satisfying. Differentiated among other IPAs by it's light but strong malt profile, slow hop ascension on the palate, and full body. I would drink more of this if I had more to drink. Overall a great beer.",Bear Republic Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,93

S: As expected, citursy (grapefruit), slightly floral, hoppy aroma with malt background present. T: Very smooth, crisp citrus grapefruit flavor hits first. Slightly sweet but balanced with malt and then the longer it is in the mouth the more the hops dig in. Not overwhelming bitter but hops are very assertive. Very balanced smooth tasting.

Piney hops flavor comes out more as the beer warms. Caramel malt comes through, but the hops are the dominant flavor.  M: Medium body with good carbonation for an ipa.

S: Somewhat sharp grapefruit/pine blend in the aroma, along with some citrus peel. Crisp and clean.  T: Pretty aggressive... huge, full hops explosion. Maybe a little overwhelming, and a bit unbalanced to my palate. Lots of the grapefruit taste, almost like it came complete with the peel. A bit of the taste that I have only been able to compare to 'eating a joint.'  M: A pretty full body, maybe a little sticky/tacky towards the finish.  D: This is perhaps a case where it's 'bigger is not necessarily better' for me.

This looks like good stuff - slightly cloudy, not overly carbonated. Beautiful flowery hop aroma - so much it's slightly soapy but not offensive. Unfortunately, the soapiness emerges more in taste, tempering the bountiful almost sweet, deep hop taste & texture. The soapiness fortunately dissipates quickly on the longer-than-average but slightly shallow finish. A little puckery in the mouth, consistent with a wonderfully deeply-hopped beer such as this. Drinks well; evolves positively through the length of the bomber. Well-done.",Bear Republic Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,93
610,2751,jockstrappy,4.25,"Pours a cloudy amber color with a small soapy white head. Aroma is mainly the floral hop variety, with fresh cut grass and pine needles coming to mind. Taste consists of floral and citrus hop flavors, with the slightest of bread like malt flavors behind it. Very clean on the palate for a hop-bomb, 7% ABV is the only real drawback (if any) to this brew. Awesome!",Bear Republic Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,93

Appearance: It looked like any other pale ale except I've seen Industrial Light Lagers with a better head.  Aroma: It had that great IPA aroma screaming: ""Hey, Hop Head, can you take it."" OTOH once you got passed the hops, it said vegetables.  Taste: Disappointing. It tasted like an overhopped pale ale without a malt backbone.

Taste is delicious, a really excellent beer. Lots of bitter grapefruitiness, sweet malt, in basically a perfect balance. Feel is fairly thick and tasty with near-perfect carbonation.

No real head to speak of from a light pour as I tried to leave all the sediment in the bottle. This is from a bomber and I've had problems in the past with my second drink because of the sediment. I just got a nice big new 22 oz snifter and it was perfect to get the brew as close to clear in one glass after the pour.  Nose is fruity and spicy. Smells like a great big bouquet of slimy greasy hops. If my girl sent me flowers at work, and they smelled like this brew, I'd beat up the kids that made fun of me for getting flowers at work.  Lots of grapefruit from my first couple sips. Powerfully bitter aftertaste, but not a bad bitter. The finish is sweet and bitter at the same time. Very interesting almost grassy as it warms. Who knew drinking your yard could be so awesome. Not a bomb, but an ideal shock for an IPA.  The mouthfeel is nice and slippery. Like squeezing a big handful of hops and letting the grease slick right down your gullet. Yeah, I said gullet.  This brew came with a lot of hype, and I'm extremely happy to say that I was not disappointed, even with the 40+ dollar bill for a case of 12 bombers.

A very cute amber with a fine off white head that lasts a while and finally settles into little islands of bubbles that range in size.  Smell is initially of sweet honey and then moves into some smooth hops. A clean scent that has some maltiness in the background paired with some citrus and floral.  Yum. Its a sweet brew that has some nice citrus flavor with malts and honey. A good workhorse of a brew. This one is cheap in the stores, has big flavor and is very pleasing to drink.

610,2751,Hephaestus,4.27,"A: Golden orange color, thin but ample amount of head  S: This one actually filled the air (with hop aroma), no need to bother with putting your nose up to the glass, although that reveals more detailed aromas. Somewhat of a citrus smell, but also pine notes.  T: Initial sip was a bit bitter, but what IPA isn't when starting a session? A sweeter IPA than the majority, but sweet in a citrus-like way. This is somewhat confusing because they use Columbus and Cascade hops, which normally don't put that taste off so strongly, if at all. Cascades definitely gave it a pine undertone.  M: Smooth but bitter, perfect amount of carbonation for an IPA.

Retains more than just a lace, it's quite thick and leaves lots of stick.  Smells of pine and grapefruity citrus hops, very fragrant, with a little bit of an indication of caramel malt for balance. Hops smell fantastic.  Taste is super fruity with lots of hop flavor. Very citrusy, lots of grapefruit flavor and plenty of pine also. Some caramel malt sweetness but not a huge malt backbone. It does the trick though because the hops have so much flavor, and although the hop bitterness is pronounced it doesn't overwhelm.  Mouthfeel is quite smooth and creamy, soft carbonation is very nice. Good medium body.  This is one hell of a drinkable IPA. Great flavor, manageable bitterness.

With extensive smelling I can detect caramel and light butterscotch notes.  T- Quite sweet, once again with the orange and the caramel. I'd say the taste of this is somewhat of an English, malt forward, beer, but with American hops. The problem I have is that the hops just aren't doing it for me.  M- The alcohol hits me hard for this beer. Not so much in the palate, but down my throat I feel it. The beer is smooth enough for my taste, and the carbonation treats it well.

Hops are more pine than citrus and there is a bready/malt balance hear. hides the alcohol pretty well at 7%.  I think the mouthfeel is my favorite part of this beer.

Wouldve had many more if wasnt trying out others but this would be the ideal to sit down with and have many over the course of a good night.  Great beer, cant wait to be able to get more in Jersey.

Abundant grapefruit and pineapple in the flavour, which brings a delightful bitterness. There's also great balance provided by the malts, which come through with caramel and honey notes.

610,2751,lifebeer,4.27,"bought this one on vacation at central market in dallas:  a. beautiful orange/amber color that is common to most IPA's, poured with a finger of head, incredible life to this head that grew a mushroom of medium to large iridescent bubbles, surrounded by smaller bubbles, after a while the head settled and the mushroom cap floated, reminding me of a Belgian Trappist  b. amazing, short-lived aroma (noticed more was released as head went down and released the trapped aroma), a sweet, subtly citrus hop bouquet, alcohol fumes with a huge huff  t. surprisingly understated, was expecting a bigger, badder version of the aroma, begins with a sweet ginger, with sweet hops emerging with the swallow, finishing with a subtle bitterness relative to some of the other So Cal IPAs, with time, a nice earthy flavor remains  mf. a little disappointed, kinda watery, but allows for increased drinkability  d. one of the most drinkable IPAs ever, overall delicious (had to slow myself down!), wish had bought some more!  note: MUST be consumed at warmer (room) temperatures. if too cold, the bittering take over.",Bear Republic Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,93
610,2751,MICAMD,4.05,"A- Slightly cloudy and yellow with a thin but creamy white head. Looks much better with the sediment swirled in.  S- Piney with a nice caramel backing. A little bit of bubble gum aroma in there as well.  T- Piney, sweet, and a little bit of bubble gum. Very good and pretty balanced, but nothing really blows me away.  M- Very creamy but the hop presence sure shines through.  D- A very decent IPA. I am impressed. I would love to try this on tap.",Bear Republic Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,93
610,2751,PhageLab,3.91,"Had on tap at the Tap House in Hampton, served in a standard pint glass. First review of 2008!  A - Medium amber coloration witha slight golden hue to it. Nice, big, frothy head which displayed some nice retention, as well as excellent lacing. Great presentation.  S - Mixture of floral and pine notes, but it's a bit weak. Pleasant nonetheless.  T - Excellent balance, decent hop characteristics, citrus undertones, and a great malt backbone. The aftertaste was an odd blend of pine to near mint.  M - Light to medium bodied, creamy feel with an oily residue left over. Great carbonation level.  D - A safe bet and a solid example of an IPA. I'd say it is definitely worth a try. Now I'm interested in finding the Racer X...",Bear Republic Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,93
610,2751,mattster,4.25,"Opened 22oz Bomber, poured into Nonic glass. Formed nice 1"" head, slowly dissipated into slight layer of foam over top of brew. Nice light amber color, very slightly hazy - Quite nice looking.  My nose was no where near the glass when I caught the brew's hoppy aroma goodness. Sticking my nose into the glass brings fourth it's hops, slight grapefruit smells.  Taste is of hops (of course) and citrus. Very smooth. Citrus become more of pineapple on palate. Bitter but ever pleasant taste is quite smooth very nice finish. I wish I had another bomber of this. Excellent start to the new year as this is my first beer and review of 2008.",Bear Republic Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,93
610,2751,RblWthACoz,4.53,Pours slightly fogged orange amber with a great crème head and a lot of lacing on the way down. Nose is very piney hops. Flavor is super hops. Stays full and unwavering. Feel is smooth with a thicker liquid body and a good carbonation. It feels just as good as it tastes.

Fairly piney as well.  T - big citrus action up front, finishes really nicely with some piney bitterness. Very enjotable  M - medium bodied.

610,2751,ElGordo,4.37,"This is the first keg I got for my new home draft system. It brings a tear to my eye every time I go to the wall and pull a pint... Pours a bright golden-orange color, topped by a finger's worth of creamy white head that leaves a bit of lacing on the glass. Aroma of grassy, sticky hops is exceedingly fresh - strange notes of cannabis and other plant material are a bit off-putting at first until you get used to them. Palate is balanced between floral hops and mildly sweet malt up front, then the full hop assault takes over. Bitter, grassy hops emerge mid-palate and basically erase any trace of malt. Finish is grassy, but not too bitter. Mouthfeel is full and a bit sticky, with a coating of resin left all over the interior of my mouth. While this one goes down easy, it's also a rather heavy hitter, and a bit dangerous to have just flowing out of my living room wall. Oh well, that's the price you pay for greatness, I guess.",Bear Republic Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,93
610,2751,Risser09,4.36,"22 oz bottle poured into an oversized goblet - 2007 bottling - Cellar temperature  Appearance: Aggressive pouring makes a 1.5 inch head that is off white in color. The beer itself is transparent and a golden orange color. Carbonation surfaces from the streams that are made from the bottom of the glass. Lace rings are left behind after every gulp is withdrawn from the glass. Coats the glass. Definite 5.  Smell: Grapefruit hoppiness dominates the nose. Orange and lemon peels add subordinate aromas. Fresh grass.  Taste: Hoppy, but not overly so. The bitterness isn't over the top in this beer. Hop flowers fill out the tastebuds, with grapefruit and lavendar scented butter. By this, I mean this is a pretty creamy beer for an IPA. A nice touch. Long, slippery finish that is far from drying. Lots of floral tastes. Bitterness is only 40% of the flavor.  Mouthfeel: Again, quite creamy for this style, which is welcomed. Alcohol doesn't feel like it is 7%. Smoothe.  Drinkability: This is an extrenely drinkable IPA, moreso than others. No cloying bitterness or disturbing finish, well hidden alcohol, and floral flavors make this a clea cut winner. While it doesn't blast me with hops, I can still appreciate them in both the aroma and taste. Bear Republic makes another winner in my book. Highly recommended. Could easily do 3 bombers, and at $4 apiece, it wouldn't be so pricey.",Bear Republic Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,93
610,2751,biggmike,4.42,"Poured an attractive golden/orangey color with nice head that hung around for a while. Aroma was nice; very hoppy with notes of pine, citrus, and grass. Taste was very much the same with the same hoppy flavors up front, but ended with a nice malty finish. Mouthfeel was excellent and lacing on the glass was good. This was extremely drinkable and one I will buy again.",Bear Republic Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,93
610,2751,boogles,4.26,"Among the locally available Bear Republic bombers, I usually buy Hop Rod Rye. I couldn't remember why I don't alternate between Racer 5 and Hop Rod, because as good as Hop Rod is, this other beer must be outstanding. Well, it is, but it's not as good. It's not your typical IPA, which is good. It's nice and bitter, plenty of weedy goodness, with an extraordinary finish and aftertaste.  Its weakness is that it's initially sweet and a bit sticky, and the nose is not potent enough. Otherwise, it's great stuff. Not as good as the Hop Rod, though.",Bear Republic Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,93

T: Beautiful, clean, piney hop flavor that enveloped the inside of my mouth with that wonderful floral hop goodness. The hop bitterness was lingering, but not unpleasant.  M: Distinct hop flavor and bitterness on the tongue, but not overpowering or overly bitter.  D: Beautifully balanced IPA.

The color was nice with a good white creamy head and nice flavor. Not as much lacing on the glass as other IPAs I've tried and not quite as hoppy as some beers I tried that weekend but very drinkable.

S: Citrus and piney hops, some sweetness in the background. A bit too subdued.  T: Nice flavor. Strong malt base and plenty of sweetness. The hops are mostly pine, very little of the citrus detected in the scent. Good balance of flavors, the hops are prominent but not as overpowering as in some IPA's.  MF: Crisp and smooth with just a hint of carbonation. Alcohol hit me harder than I would have expected, but I haven't eaten in quit a while. Moderately thick and a very full bodied beer.  D: I like this a lot. It's not quite as hoppy as some IPAs out there, but the balance of flavors is very good. And it's not like there's no bitterness there. The hops have less flavor character than more citrusy beers, but the sweetness of the malt really makes up for this. Better than the Hop Rod Rye in my opinion.

Taste- Huge hop bitterness in the front, followed by a maginficently dry alchol finish. The hops lingered with a chewy piney, citrusy taste. the hops seemed to clinge to my tongue like a small child clings to it's mommy. Some cotton candy like sweetness managed to work it's way thru to the front of my palate despite the fireworks of hops in my mouth. Slight grainy phenol present. Devoid of any yeasty taste despite this being an unfiltered offering.  Moutfeel- nicely balanced malt backbone that lends to a medium to full bodied moutheel, complimented with some rich, dank chewey nuggets of hops.

Taste is surprisingly malty for such a big IPA, along with some bready notes. mouthfeel has a high amount of texture, possibly due to being a bottle conditioned beer. A very nice, well balanced IPA.

610,2751,IceEyes,4.42,I've been drinking this beer for years now and it's always been a favorite of mine. It's really a classic west coast IPA in my opinion. The body is full yet also light enough to be quaffable. The bittering is just right with a piney aroma and citrus flavor. It's good to know that this beer is so widely available on the west coast because its a quick choice for easy drinking. A great standby beer. It always kicks up a good fluffy head and goes down real easy. Bear Republic is one of the best breweries in northern California and Racer 5 is a good reason why.,Bear Republic Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,93

It was a bit foggy.  Taste: Pine, grapefruit, orange peel... hmm familiar? There was some tangerine in there too. Honey, caramel, maple sugar (the malty flavours were there, but not dominant). The bitterness was not overly aggressive, but did build up. Oily, resiny... I think I can taste the lupulin glands.  Mouthfeel: Lots of small bubbles. Creamy & smooth.

610,2751,Dogbrick,3.83,"On draught at 69 Taps in Akron. The beer is a dark golden amber color with a medium thin light beige head with good retention. Patches of lace. The nose is floral hops, with touches of sweet malt and pine. Medium body with a floral, hoppy character balanced by a fair amount of sweet caramel malt. Touches of citrus here and there too.

610,2751,geexploitation,4.16,"Pours a clear, sparkly, bright -- nay, luminous amber with a pristine, sticky white head that leaves thick lacing on the glass. Very pretty beer. Pure American hop nose of grapefruit, pine sap and perhaps some chili oil. Malt influence on the nose is subdued -- just a hint of sweet nuts to provide a bit of a base for the hops. On the palate, bracing, fruity bitterness first off, then some big carbonation makes itself known. The mid-palate smooths out a bit to showcase the malts, although things remain wayyy off balance toward the hop side. This is a great American IPA -- brash and harsh and chock full of hops, with fairly little nuance, but the beauty of the hops is, in this case, enough. Excellent.",Bear Republic Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,93
610,2751,kimcgolf,4.52,"This is really a good beer that I had to bring back from the northeast US. Immediately upon opening, I detected a strong, hoppy citrus (mostly oranges) and floral aroma. Poured to a slightly hazy orange yellow color with an off-white head that lingered well and left good lacing. Aroma maintained itself well through the drink, and was joined by a whiff of alcohol late. Mouthfeel was tangy and bitter, and the flavor picked up the citrus hops of the nose, and blended them slightly with a touch of malt.  This all led to a finish which was bitter, dry, long, slightly warming and very good.  I just wish Bear Rep. would come to Atlanta.",Bear Republic Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,93
610,2751,PittBeerGirl,4.42,"A-Pours a nearly transparent rusty amber with big thick foamy white head. Head eventually dwindles to 1 finger and leaves behind plenty of lacing in the glass. Lots of bottle conditioned yeast is at the bottom of the bottle-when that is poured in it adds lots of flaky yeast sediment and more of a translucent haze.  S- Before I even completely removed the cap a big whiff of citrus, mostly grapefruit, and piny hops hits the nose. This smell is a powerful smack in the face of hop aromas and great! The slightest bit of caramel malt also pops through at the end of the nose.  T-Surprisingly much milder than the smell. Lots of citrus hop flavor upfront with virtually no malt backbone (though I know it has to be there). The piny cascade hops really come out for the finish and are very refreshing-citrus hops take a backseat to these. What lingers is a light-to moderate bitterness and a big dose of refreshing piny hops. Hints of caramel malt sweetness too.  M-Low carbonation and oily body. Very smooth and creamy. Great.  D- Despite the near absence of balance this is a very good IPA. I love the bottle conditioning and the overall smoothness of the body. Not really the best tasting IPA I have had...but it's still very good; and probably in my top 5. Great West Coast IPA.",Bear Republic Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,93
610,2751,NCSUdo,4.37,Thanks to shaebs99 for this 22 oz bottle.  A: Crystal clear golden under a pretty impressive white head. A great looking beer indeed.  S: Nice citrusy hops. Zesty grapefruit and oranges with a hint of lemon. Excellent candy-ish type character to it. Some piney elements as well. Just a really great hop aroma.  T: Good balance. Great citrus fruitiness up front ends in a very surprising bitter finish that one may not quite have expected given the up front citrus character. Bitterness preceeded slightly by an earthy hop taste.  M/D: Light on the palate and just a little watery. Carbonation is a tad high but that doesn't spoil the experience at all. This is definately something that I could down many pints of given the chance.,Bear Republic Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,93
610,2751,cooncat,4.47,"Serving from a 22 oz. bomber, decanted into a standard pint glass.  A vigorous pour produces a deep orange/amber colored brew of amazing clarity. A two fingered head tops the glass, which leaves sticky sheets of lacing all the way down.  Nose hit me while I was pouring. It's a huge piney/resiny hop note, with grapefruit rinds and maybe some dry grass. Wow .. this is just the nose.  The taste echoes the nose, in that hops predominate, as should be in an IPA. This one is balanced, with a caramel malt backbone that is easily detected at the back of the palate. The malts are just enough to give balance, and are not cloying. Mouthfeel I would describe as medium, not at all heavy, which adds to the refreshing nature of this quaffable brew. Finish is dry, and the overall experience leaves you wanting more, MORE!  This is a very well done IPA. It's not 'over the top' in any way, and is smooth and easy drinking. The 7% ABV is not noticeable, which makes this even more enjoyable. Well done, Bear Republic!

The head is a finger thick even now; it lasts and leaves thick sticky lacing.  Great hop citrusy hop aroma with a tiny bit of sweetness from the malt.  Almost indescribable taste. The malt carries the hop flavor with a great smoothness. The hops are sweet all the way to the end where there's a tiny, tiny bitter note at the end. Beautiful.  Smooth mouthfeel, that's the best way to say it. Such low carbonation that you'd think it was from a cask. That's a good thing. Actually, it's a wonderful thing.  I bought one bottle of this on my honeymoon in August, so it may have been even better when the hops were fresher.

Beer poured a golden amber color with a well-sustained white head. Nose is of wonderful floral hops that allude to what is about to happen next. Taste is slightly malty to start but those malts are quickly overrun by a blast of those northwest grapefruity hops. Mouthfeel is medium to full bodied and glides very nicely across the palate.

S: Piney floral hops. Hops are bursting out of the bottle as soon as I open it and get stronger as I pour. Really looking forward to this. Getting some nice citrus grapefruit.  T/M: Great bitter bite. Man that's good. Packs quite a punch. Grapefruit pops in here and there. Tastes awesome. Malts present themselves enough to save your tongue. Adds a nice sweetness in the back. Medium body and carbonation. Great bitterness hangs out after a very dry finish.  D: Brilliant taste and smooth body make it easy to drink.

610,2751,ManofWax,3.21,"Given the positive reviews on BA, I was pretty disappointed in this beer. I love Hop Rod Rye, so I thought I'd check out this other Bear Republic Brew.  A: A reddish gold with a buttermilk-colored head, about 2mm thick. Nice complementary colors.  S: Smelled of vegetables initially, before giving way to a portentious suggary quality.  T: I did not taste nearly as much hops in this brew as I expected. It was malt through and through. Hints of corriander (said my tasting mates) and fruits, but just too sweet. Not nearly bitter enough.  M: Goes down smooth as can be. Medium body, could stand to be more carbonated.  D: I can't think of too many situations in which I would want to drink this.

610,2751,bluemoonswoon,4.47,"22oz bomber poured into nonic pint glass, no freshness date.  A: Pours a cloudy deep gold with a fluffy whitish head with a two inch cap that fades down to a ring and leaves sticky lacing down the glass. Not too much carbonation working in the glass.  S: Pretty darned sweet aroma here, I can just feel the hops in this, sticky sweet and sugary grapefruit dominates, sort of feel that there are oranges or tangerines or citrus fruits of that matter but with a candied aroma if that makes any sense. This one smells almost like a DIPA, very rich in this sense.  T/MF: Hops go to work right away on the tongue as soon as the beer is sipped. Very bready upfront, but after a bit the beer begins to take on an almost sweet fruit flavor. Oranges and grapefruits are present but subdued behind a nice floral character that balances the beer on both sides. Bits of pine and nut come in and out and the beer finishes with a dry and bitter fruit finish. Pretty silky in the mouth otherwise  D: This one is really fun to drink, a brew that is on the lighter side of medium and not too boozy either in heat or in effect (if you know what I mean). Bomber is the perfect size for this one and would try this again in the future.

Slight haze. Great head.  Crisp hop oils in the attack  very fresh and bright. A rich, tasty maltiness develops just briefly before being lost to a sea of hop bitterness. Quite nice. Faint raspberry tones come and go. Snappy grassiness near the finish. One of the tastiest heads Ive ever come across  its so creamy like meringue. Finishes very dry.  Medium body, spicy carbonation, and oily tartness hold the mouth together.  Overall: pretty cool. Racer 5 is most certainly an acceptable & worthy AIPA.

S: Smells like it's been well dry-hopped for lack of a better description: it's lemony and citrusy with pine or grass noticed as it warms.  T: Some biscuity malt and fruitiness up front in the mouth, but this is ultimately dominated by the hops -- clean, crisp and dry in feel. There's quite a nice lingering lemony bitterness and a bit of pine as well. Some alcohol warmth on the way down. Nicely balanced all around. The hop profile is close to perfect for an IPA -- not too juicy, not too grapefruity, not too bitter, not too piney. . . but just about right for my tastebuds.  M: Light-to-medium in body, well-carbonated. Dry early but it does become a bit more juicy as it warms.  D: Excellent. If I were to try and create the perfect highly drinkable IPA, I think this would be it. It's tasty without being heavy. There's hoppy bitterness without it being too much. Like I said: nicely balanced. Extremely drinkable, especially for a 7% ABV beer. Enjoy.",Bear Republic Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,93
610,2751,gwood,4.08,"A - Quite pretty really. Slightly burnt orange. Great sticky head that lingers.  S - Citurs, pine, fresh hops all over.  T - Hops hit first but are clean, good mellow malt middle that is surpisingly pronounced. The finish is a long dry piney hop dance that is a like a spinner in the hallway.  M - Just a great carbonation to it - spakles...brilliant. Silky rosins that linger.  D - I'll have another please. Quite drinkable.",Bear Republic Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,93
610,2751,yelterdow,3.92,"Purchased at Dean & Deluca while on vacation in Napa, CA on September 7, 2007. Served back home in NJ in a pint glass at just over refrigerator temperature.  Appearance- Pours a substantially paler orange than most IPAs, with some chill haze and a supple, three-finger crown.  Smell- A perfect blend of honeyed grapefruit and bicycle handlebars... the aromas of cold metal dance with the huge citrus character evident here.  Taste- The voyage of flavor progression is exciting and unexpected... lip smacking and bitter, the grapefruity hop bite concedes nicely into a bready malt backbone. Then, the hops return and spend an eternity drying the mouth and settling to the deepest recesses of the tongue's sides. An aggressively bitter IPA without question, one that begs an attentive and purposeful tasting. Burps galore on this one.  Mouthfeel- Relatively thin, uninteresting, subdued texture in the mouth.  Drinkability- Easy with regard to the strength... the initial honeymoon, however, fades rather quickly and it gradually becomes much more ordinary in its overall presentation.",Bear Republic Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,93
610,2751,bluejacket74,4.38,"22 ounce bottle. Served in the ""new"" Sam Adams Boston Lager glass, the beer pours a clear light amber color with an inch frothy white head. Head retention and lacing are both very good. Aroma is mainly citrusy (grapefruit) hops and caramel malt, very nice. It tastes like citrusy and piney hops, with some malt noticable in there too. Finishes with a nice bitter hoppy aftertaste which lingers around a while. Mouthfeel is medium and a bit oily/slick. Drinkability is pretty good, it's very smooth and easy to drink. I think this is a very good and refreshing IPA, I'd definitely buy it again, it's worth the money.",Bear Republic Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,93
610,2751,peabody,4.12,Pours out like weak ice tea with lots of white suds that stay around for quite some time. Smell is strong grapefruit and caramel with a hint of alcohol that burns the nose just a tad. Hops and yeast tend to dominate the aromas. Taste is strong bitterness with just a hint of sweetness then the dark hop bitterness comes back. Pretty malty and the alcohol is present but not overpowering. Mouthfeel is a tad warm from the alcohol but the oily hops dominate the aftertaste. This one tastes strong for a 7%er but it's still a great beer for a night of imbibing.,Bear Republic Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,93
610,2751,MmmIPA,3.35,"Poured into a Yards/Standard Tap pint glass.  One finger off white head sits atop of a murky orange body with little floaties in there and ample carbonation.Some small patches of lace.  Hop flavor in the nose  The taste is very bitter and does have some malt at the end of the taste.  Mouthful is good and easy to drink.  Some reason makes me think this beer is old cause it doesnt deem a ""Outstanding"" to me atleast.This sorda taste like aged SN Celebration.That was the first taste that came to my mind.I would like to sample a fresh bottle or try this from a tap.",Bear Republic Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,93
610,2751,jasonjlewis,4.75,"God damn dude. This is one hell of an IPA. I'm not easily impressed either.  This beer's head retention clung to the glass for dear life and wouldn't let go all the way to the last sip.  I could smell this beer as it was being poured. Nice earthy, piney, hop aroma. So very inticing.  There is a nice sweetness upfront followied by a great earthy, piney, hop bitterness. Give me MORE!  This beer had a nice mouthfeel, more towards four, but the taste is a little more thatn 4.5, so I balanced it.  I could drink this beer all night and all day. Very nice. Don't know how this beer is in the bottle, but it is one hell of a treat on tap.",Bear Republic Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,93

610,2751,Overlord,3.55,"Not as good as I expected.  Not the hoppiest IPA I've had ... by a wide margin, but the lack of those delicious hops hasn't been replaced by much. It has a fairly straightforward bitter with a bare splash of citrus flavor. In comparison to a DIPA, which usually will have more sweet fruit/malt flavors balancing out the hops, there isn't much else going on here. Mostly grapefruit, no real residual sweetness ... maybe a bit of orange/citrus.  Pours a not terribly attractive yellowish orange, but does have great carbonation and a long lasting head (started off four fingered, but quicly disippated to a more manageable finger length .. then lingered at half a finger for the entirety of the drink).  By no means a bad beer, it's just not my favorite IPA. The real problem is the price. For a few dollars more I can get union jack ipa or ruination, for a few dollars less I can get mission street, alaskan, or torpedo ipa, and for the same price I can get celebration ipa.",Bear Republic Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,93
610,2751,wagenvolks,4.67,"Bomber into a tulip glass: Pours an attractive, golden gamboge-orange color; clear with an ample carbonation level that fuels a behemoth, cloudy, light tan head. Great retention & lacing make for quite the visual.  Aroma is packed with piney, resinous hops balanced perfectly with big, sweet caramel malts. Fruity citrus, mango, pineapple, and pear round out the mouthwatering scent.  This is one of the better tasting IPA's I've had. There's a big time hop note at the beginning, followed by a smooth, biscuity caramel malt backbone that (again) works wonders for the balance to this brew. Mouthfeel is crisp, bubby, and very refreshing with a poignantly bitter hop finish. Overall, this india pale ale is fantastically complex, and both hop-heads and malt-nuts alike will fall in love with it.  Sign of a truly pleasing beer? My girlfriend, who DESPISES hops (I'm working on that, trust me...), actually enjoyed this one.",Bear Republic Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,93
610,2751,DoubleJ,4.5,"On-tap at the Yard House in Brea during happy hour, on to the beer:  Orange in color withn a little paleness, it has a nice dense head on the top. Strong aroma of hops rise from the beer with the usual piney notes. The bitterness is not over the top. Very hoppy flavor. Notes of tropical fruit, grapefruit, and some esters. This beer has an excellent smoothness, which makes this a pleasure to drink despite the strength.  In comparison to the Hop Rod Rye, I prefer this one a little more (although I should point out I had this one on-tap, the Hop Rod came from a bomber). It doesn't have the dryness of that, but the flavor is a bit more tasty.",Bear Republic Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,93
610,2751,Bubba83,4.47,"Easily one of my favorite IPAs. I think it's because I'm attracted to the piney hops over the grapefruit/citrus.  A - About what you'd expect a top tier IPA to look like, fairly dark orange, a sticky pure white head with some craters and excellent lacing.  S - The smell is quite possibly the best part about this beer. It smells like a forest. The pine is overwhelming, definitely a clue of what is to come for the taste.  T - A bit grainy at first with some bready flavors, but quickly turns into the forest from the smell, with lots of piney hops hitting you and lingering through the finish. The great part about this is that you don't get an over the top bitterness at the very end like you do with a lot of other IPAs, I'm not quite sure if that's because of good malt balancing or the hop variety, though.  M - Nice mouthfeel... It's a bit dry on the tongue and will make your tongue feel coarse, but, isn't that what an IPA is supposed to do? The oilyness of the beer makes things feel nice as it is sliding down the ol' pipe.  D - Drinkability is good, this isn't a beer I'd want to session, but, for how extreme the piney hops are, the drinkability doesn't suffer as much as you might think. It's the beer I like to end my night with, especially after I've been drinking malt dominant beers and need that smack in the palate from some nice piney hops.  Overall, it's my favorite all around IPA, and I am lucky to be able to find fresh, affordable six packs in the bay area...

610,2751,GweedoeBRew,4.13,"Recently had a Racer 5 at the Union Brewhouse in Weymouth, ma. A nice IPA from Bear Republic Brewing from California. I definately expected a little more hoppy aroma than I got when I too my first wiff of the brew, but it did much better on taste. I nice strong american IPA mouth feel and great hop finish.

610,2751,allengarvin,4.57,"Into a pint glass, this is a slightly hazy copper color with a small head but nice lacing. Exceptionally nice aroma, with a big spicy, perfumy (almost cologne-like) hop presence. Malt underlies it, but hops dominate. Flavor is beautiful, with waves of bitterness and earthy hop flavor. Sweet malt is hidden underneath but makes for a nice balance. Lingering dry finish. Lots of carbonation, but a surprisingly not-heavy body.  Very nice IPA, very drinkable, despite the strength. Just as much a hop explosion as Dogfish Head's, but whereas theirs tend to be heavy beers to savor, this is one to be quaffed.",Bear Republic Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,93

Well that didn't happen. Instead, a friend of the wife came over, cracked open my bomber, took a sip and almost puked. I took this as a good sign since her idea of a good beer is a Blue Moon, so I proceeded to partake of my fine beverage so it wouldn't go to waste.  Needless to say, I was very hoppy with this one. The color was a beautiful copper color with a pure white head and several floaties in the bottom of the glass. The smell and taste were pure hops, but that's what we buy these for now isn't it? It was extremely smooth and drinkable for a hop bomb and will definately have to revisit this one again.",Bear Republic Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,93

610,2751,domtronzero,4.15,"Another great product from Bear Republic! Although I've had this beer several times on tap, I actually prefer the bottle. Both are excellent; however, I prefer this beer slightly warmer than the standard bar-serving temperature (about 44*F, instead of 40*F). I think it brings out a slightly maltier taste and also helps emphasize the hop flavor. Pours a nice copper color with a nice compact head. Aroma and flavor is mainly citrus, with pine notes in the background. Mouthfeel is regular - nothing notable or otherwise. I love drinking this beer with my spicy chicken gumbo.",Bear Republic Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,93

610,2751,Keitherduder,4.25,"22oz bottle into a pint glass. This beer filled the room with a very nice hop aroma. Citricy hops. That, along with the beautiful head and slight cloudyness of the beer made me real excited about the first sip. The taste is very complex. Very good. The bitterness lingers nicely. One thing I look for when tasting an IPA is the ballance between the Bitterness and Sweetness. The bitterness of this IPA does overpower the malt. The sweetness of the malt is subtle.

A caramel malty backbone is there, but the hops are running this. Flavor starts off sweetish with toffee and fruity esters, accompanied by a Bear Republic house flavor. Hops come in with loads of pine resin, grapefruit, and aspirin. Finishes really bitter with that lingering aspirin flavor.

Stickiness is all over the place, just how I like 'em. Smell is a nice citrus burst, mostly orange and pineapple. Noticable caramel malt in the nose as well. Taste is a very crisp citrus hop with a hint of dirty pine hop as well. Midway there is a good biscuity malt balance. This one finishes somewhat dry and a bit creamy too.

610,2751,rajendra82,4.4,"Many thanks to BA TexIndy for this bomber of Racer 5 from our recent trade. The pour was clear pale, and the head atop was large and retained well, as is typically the case with IPAs. The smell was quite strongly hoppy for a single IPA. The alluring smell of grapefruit and apricot just begged me to take the first sip. As I did it, a spicy and generously bitter taste tingled my tongue as the ample carbonation amplified it. Following this was the malt, but it was not candy sweet like some other beers of this strength, but more caramelized, drippy, and soft. The aftertaste was salty and citric. The hop oils coated every part of the tongue after each swallow, leaving a long drawn out tingly aftertaste. Mouthfeel was medium full and quenching. One of the most pleasing beers to drink if you are ever drawn towards hops like I am. All I can say is the following:  I pledge allegiance to the checkered flag of Racer 5 and to the Bear Republic for which it stands, one brewer underdog, independent, with deliciousness and hops for all.",Bear Republic Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,93

It's been over two years since I've had had a Racer 5, and I gotta say, I think I should be drinking this more often..just wish I could find the damn thing within 1000 miles.

610,2751,mikesgroove,4.7,"So freaking psyched to finally get ahold of this one....  A - Poured a deep orange amber, great two inch head formed on top and left a ton of lace down the glass once it finally decided to let go. Nice carbonation, great overall look, just like an IPA should.  S - Huge citrus hops, and a ton of pine. Some sticky sweet notes as well. Very fresh taste, lots of resiny aromas. Really great smell.  T - Perfect. Just a phenomonal fresh, sticky, resin hoppy bomb of delight. Such a sticky pine fresh taste, lots of fresh cut grass and orange peel. Some light sugar, but a bomb al the way.  M - Super smooth and very very sticky. A bit thick. Very nice carbonation, could put this down all night long with ease.  D - Damn near perfect. Not strong enough to be a sipper, a little heavy though to throw down a ton, but otherwise just about perfect. I would love to try this one on tap, seems like it would be perfect.  Overall this totally lived up to my expectations. It was just great. I would love to have this again and again. I am glad I have a couple more bottles.

T: From front to back, a very smooth IPA with great hop characteristics that never kill the palate. Easy transition throughout, into a finish that goes out like a lamb, leaving a light hoppiness on the back of the tongue. I admire the subtlety of this IPA, very enjoyable.  M: Crisp and slightly velvety texture, carbonation is at an acceptable level.  D: Expecting more of a hop bomb, I was surprised by the calm nature of this IPA, and would gladly have more.

Aroma of floral and citrus hops with vanilla and a bit of butterscotch. Slight cellarlike mustiness that's pretty unique. Pretty subtle and subdued though.  Taste is lovely but less hoppy than I imagined. Hops are licoricelike and a bit piney and floral, but there's a very healthy balance of malty sweetness that has some nice vanilla and cakelike sweetness. Lemon peel bitterness rounds it off.

Malt flavor is big to match. A toasted marshmallow(golden not black) caramelization. Fruitiness sneaks through with canned peach and apricot. Is there rye in this beer because it has a very spicey flavor? Slight bourbon comes and goes late in the fading finish. Overall it's big, bIG, BIG.

Some sweet malts. Taste is all hops, and quite wonderful. The hops are piney with grapefruit tones. An awesome tasting IPA. The malt is almost nondescript due to the hop overload.

D - VERY easy drinking beer. Not too much going on in the taste, its nonabrasive, creamy and simple. A simple tasting IPA, with strangely high alcohol (not detectable).

610,2751,ccrida,4.18,"Poured from a 22oz. bomber into a Lagunitas shaker pint, Racer 5 is a clear copper with medium, oatmeal colored head that fades fairly quickly but leaves lots of very nice looking lace.  Aroma is moderate for a west coast IPA, resinous and earthy. I like to serve my IPAs on the colder side as far as ales go, which of course mutes the smell. As it warmed a bit, I picked up some lemony citrus, as well as alcohol.  The taste is much more of the hop smacker that I was hoping for, whew! Actually, the initial taste was a nice biscuit malt, but it immediately is overwhelmed by a ton of piny, spicy hops. I can't get enough of hops, at least aroma and flavor wise, and this one doesn't disappoint, but is in fact very satisfying in that regard. What's more, while the finish is satisfyingly bitter, it's not out of control, which ruins some of the hops bombs for me. Nice! The malt plays an ancillary role here, providing a nice touch of sweet bread. The only strike, is that it's a tad hot for only being a 7% west coast IPA, but it's not enough to upset a very enjoyable experience. It amplified as the brew warmed, but I like to drink my IPAs fridge cold, and only really let this warm to explore the aroma, so I won't really dock it much for that.  The mouthfeel is on medium side, with a very nice creaminess, but it leaves a sticky coating hop oils.  This is a great beer, a quintessential example of the west coast style. Next time I drink this, I will be sucking them down and probably getting drunker then I should, rather then take to much time breaking it down, because it's very good and every sip just beckons another.",Bear Republic Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,93
610,2751,btcook007,4.3,"This beer scored #1 among 5 IPA's tasted. IPA's were rated as follows: Bear Republic Racer 5 IPA (1); Port Brewing Wipeout IPA (2); Stone Ruination IPA (3); Samuel Smith's IPA (4); and Decadent Imperial IPA (5).  Samuel Smith's was the only English IPA in the tasting, and I intended to use it as a ""baseline"" against American IPA's. However, I found it much too malty and not hoppy to my tasting. I would suggest that it tastes like an IPA would have tasted at the end of the long English-India voyage for which it was designed. The American brews were all decidedly much hoppier and less maltier than the English standard.  I would also add that I am biased in favor of big hoppy flavor to my beers, and I am looking for less ""balance"" in an IPA.  The Bear Republic Racer 5 IPA was excellent.  A: It is a medium-coppery colored brew. Its head was one finger of white head which dissipated the 2nd quickest of the group.  S: It was well-balanced, with a pronounced hoppiness on the smell consisting of citrus and some lighter pine.  T: Very well balanced, with a wonderful sweet foretaste followed immediately by a pine citrus hop flavor. Fills the mouth with a nice, balanced pine and burnt flavor which melds nicely from the foretaste. A good amount of bitterness lingers on the aftertaste.  M: Nice effervescent mouthfeel from the foretaste, settles in nicely.  D: I could have this with anything!",Bear Republic Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,93
610,2751,Rudgers73,4,"Poured out of the bomber and into an American pint glass. The beer is a deep golden/light amber color. Chunky, frothy head and very active carbonation. It smells like sweet grapefruit, chlorophyll, and apples. The taste is pleasant. The hops aren't as explosive as the smell hinted at leaving a very smooth, yet dry mouthfeel. Dry and bitter up front with sweeter, more forgiving citrus in the middle followed by a very sharp bitter grassy taste at the very end. Smooth and rich flavor profile, not overly teeming with flavor keeping it light and refreshing. Slight alcohol heat after a few more drinks. Great example of an American IPA. Quite similar to Southern tier IPA.",Bear Republic Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,93
610,2751,Halcyondays,4.35,"22 oz. bottle  A: Copper, hazy red with thin sticky white head with good retention.  S: Grapefruit, citric hops, with malt and some tropical fruit, mango and papaya.  T: The tropical fruit shows its stuff, but also brings a more bracing pine bitterness, not overpowering, very balanced, especially for a West Coast IPA.  M: Creamy, full bodied, with almost a chewy bitterness.  D: Very good, a delicious example of the West Coast IPA style, its balanced character makes it a good anytime beer, the alcohol level does not show at all. Another great offering from the fellas at Bear Republic.",Bear Republic Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,93
610,2751,largadeer,4.25,"Appearance: Golden-amber, transparent with a long-lasting head.  Smell: Citric hops with a sweet, malty backbone - it's like a ripe grapefruit.  Taste: Slightly grainy and bready. Lots of hops, but they're by no means overpowering. They have a nice citrus quality, sharp but balanced, with a subdued but distinct sweetness in the background.  Mouthfeel: Pretty much perfect for the style. Medium-bodied, very crisp, fine bubbles, not at all harsh.  Drinkability: Highly drinkable, but not exactly sessionable due to the fairly high ABV.",Bear Republic Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,93
610,2751,barknee,4.38,"Pouring with a super massive over the top meringue like head, this reddish topaz brew shows lots of sediment and all the good stuff left in, relatively unusual for an IPA. This is a great beer; beautifully balanced piney and citric hops and huge malting make for an IPA with all the right elements to make this a very refreshing and very impressive brew. Careful metering of the ingredients result in an IPA that is properly and proportionally put together. Everlasting, never ending, and lip smacking sticky hop sensations last for minutes in the mouth and tongue. This is a brew made to a recipe that reflects integrity, ingenuity and restraint resulting in a beer that is well beyond the sum of its parts. Bravo!",Bear Republic Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,93
610,2751,TheManiacalOne,4.35,"Poured from a 22oz. bottle into an imperial pint glass.  A: The beer is a light amber color with a thin off-white head that fades slowly and leaves a thick lace on the glass.  S: The aroma is kind of faint, but is mostly of caramelized malt & citrus with a light background of hops.  T: The taste is excellently balanced with flavors of floral hops, citrus sweetness and caramel. The hops bitterness isnt as strong as most IPAs but it good enough without overpowering you. The malt character is on the thin side for the style. The after-taste is slightly bitter.  M: Smooth and very crisp, light-to-medium body, medium carbonation, dry and very clean finish.  D: Tasty, goes down easily, not filling at all, nice kick, good representation of style, this beer is certainly on the lighter side for an IPA, but it works very well. I could definitely stick with this beer for a full evening.",Bear Republic Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,93

610,2751,Atlas1,4.2,"Poured from the bomber into one of my DFH tulip pint glasses. The Racer 5 delivers a brightly colored orange/amber body with a full-bodied, off-white head. Sticky lace remnants cling to the sides of the glass as the beer recedes, and the foamy head soon dies down, leaving thick, clumpy foam globules in the middle of the beer. I like what I see so far. The nose on this beer is bold and hoppy, with strong grapefruit and pine scents being the most recognizable. Also apparent are some malty cut-grass scents, and other resiny citrus smells. The taste is tart and tangy up front, with a nice malt balance in the middle, and a pleasant hop bitterness in the finish that lingers for a while. More pine than citrus in the overall taste, with some light fruity esters permeating throughout. Mouthfeel is sturdy. A nice, strong IPA here. Even modest fans of hops might find a few things to enjoy here, and devout hopheads should definitely seek this out as yet another addition to the repertoire. Bold and refreshing, but unoffensive. An all-season beer, in my opinion.",Bear Republic Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,93

610,2751,RJLarse,4.02,On tap the Elk Public House in Spokane. Served in a pint glass.  Pours a rich gold color and is hazy. Smallish foamy white head. Resilient rings of lace on the glass.  There is a mild aroma. Fresh and piney.  Sweet citrus flavor with a mild bitter finish. Juniper and pink grape fruit flavors. Bit of sweet bread flavor underneath. Not your typical hopped up IPA.  Mouthfeel is smooth light and mildly carbonated.  This is a very drinkable IPA. Not overly bitter. I'd have this one again.,Bear Republic Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,93
610,2751,willjschmidt,4.35,"Poured from a 220oz bomber into a pint glass.  A: A golden color with an orange hue as well. Large thick white head forms on top.  S: Your standard IPA aromas; piney hops, light citrus, pale malts.  T: Delicious hops dominate the palate. The hops are not bitter, but instead very flavorful and tasty. There is a small fruit middle, but not as dominate as a lot of other IPA's. The aftertaste is dry and slightly bitter.  M: Medium bodied, well carbonated. Lots of hop oils in there as well.  D: A very drinkable IPA due to the great flavor of the hops. Not a lot of bitterness in this brew so it goes down east. A classic IPA in my book, one of the best out there.",Bear Republic Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,93
610,2751,MrMcGibblets,4.32,"lighter in color than i expected, this was a hazy bright apricot with thick off-white lacing. looks enticing. as soon as i cracked the bomber the sweet malt notes jumped out at me. tropical and citrus fruit notes were also present, along with some fresh bread dough. overall a wonderful bouqet. taste is a wonderfully balanced interplay between the sweet malts and the significant hop bitterness. not a soapy or rough bitterness either, instead it is cleansing in character. again, the balance of this beer is phenomenal. medium in body with a lively, creamy mouthfeel. nice long finish. the alcohol in this is not discernable. i normally score lower in drinkability for beers above 6.5% abv but i can't for this one. a must try beer. update: have had this many times since it's release in 6ers and it hasn't been as impressive as in the bomber format. hops have seemed faded in both aroma and taste, leading it to be a bit on the sweetish side and overall not quite as impressive. Have even started seeing some particulates.",Bear Republic Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,93

610,2751,jeffjfindley,3.63,"Very cloudy orange color, with a very substantial head that goes the extra mile. Smell is lively west coast IPA all the way, pine & citrus. Taste is typical, nothing out of the ordinary. Big, cloying nugget hops dominate. Mouthfeel is rich and sticky. Not in love with this one. It's well-executed and all, but pales (sorry) in comparison to offerings from some other west coast micros.

Flavor is strongly bitter, especially out front, with a touch of citrus and sweetness. Body was medium high in carbonation and thickness and a little dry in the finish.  This is a west coast IPA. It's a not so subtle, highly hopped beer that may scare the uninitiated, but is a good choice for the hop-heads.",Bear Republic Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,93
610,2751,Damian,3.34,"Drank on-tap at The Mission Bar & Grille, Boston, MA  Poured a clear, copperish-amber with a small, foamy, white head that faded to a lasting ring of lace.  The aroma was fragrantly hoppy, yet well balanced. Flowery, aromatic hops were met by ripe tropical fruits, citrus and some candy-like sweetness.  The taste however was punchy, one-dimensional and completely unbalanced. Intense cascade hops and hop oils took over from the very start and never let up. The hoppiness was grapefruit-like, piney and resiny. Just when I thought things could not get anymore intense, the hops crescendoed into the puckeringly bitter and slightly dry finish.  The mouthfeel was medium bodied and rather sticky.  All in all, this was a hop monster, pure and simple. While the 7% ABV was rather well hidden, I found my tolerance for the lack of balance and overwhelming bitterness waning from the very start. I really had a difficult time finishing this one. Definitely a beer to be enjoyed only by a true hop head.",Bear Republic Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,93
610,2751,Daehpoh,4.32,"Pours an amber orange color with nice puffy head. Good lacing and retention. Great floral, piney hop aroma. Caramel malts evident as well. Good depth, not one dimensional. Taste is just what I'm looking for in an IPA. Fresh, slightly piney hops with just enough malt to provide structure. Somewhat slick feel, but ends dry. Quite drinkable even with 7% abv and typical bitterness associated with this style. This is a great West Coast IPA. Distinctive, substantial and even addicting by some standards. This one gets my recommedation for sure.",Bear Republic Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,93
610,2751,mghotbi,4,"Pours a beautiful cloudy orange with a bit of bottle sediment and thin beige head that dissipates quickly. Lots of lacing. Magnificent nose of floral hops, orange and faint pine. Creamy mouthfeel with mild carbonation. Oily, resinous hops up front, followed by a faint but present malt sweetness that gives way to a lingering dry bitterness. Alcohol is well masked, but sneaks up on you at 7% and limits the drinkability.  An excellent IPA. I'd rank it second only to Moonlight's Bombay by Boat.",Bear Republic Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,93
610,2751,mjc410,4.08,"The pour into my Sam Smith glass raises a creamy, very light tan head that never reaches one finger in height. It is hesitant to fall into the semi-translucent copper body below. The bubbles rising with fervor help to keep it visually stimulating. The lacing sticks around for the whole show, too.  The nose is full of a hoppy combination of pine and citrus, with a strong malty, bready, caramelly backbone. It's quite nice, and not at all overpowering.  This is a finely balanced IPA! It's sweet at first, with a nice oily citrus-pine tang, and then the real power of the malt takes over with caramel, before ending hoppy and just slightly bitter. Pretty nice.  The mouth is medium thick, with excellent carbonation, just enough to keep things lively. This is an easy drinking, stimulating IPA that I could see myself trying every once and a while, despite the fact that I often don't like the style.",Bear Republic Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,93

Taste is the same, very nice IPA. Grass, pine, citrus, sweet caramel and toffee, slight plum notes too. Feels thick and hearty. Downed this one after mowing an acre of lawn and it was really sweet.

When it does fade, and the beer disappears, there are some impressive sheets of lace resting on the sides of the glass.  Great hop aroma, citrusy, mainly grapefruit, and pine resin. Maybe a hint of floral in the back. A bit of sweet maltyness in the nose as well.  Up front, there is a good amount of sweetness. Seems to be a very solid malt character, which may be slightly toasty. Hops coming into play immediately in citrusy and piney form, just as the nose told me.

610,2751,prototypic,4.3,"Appearance: Pours a hazy amber color. It's got a very nice, foamy one and half finger head. Retention and lacing were good.  Smell: Big piney hops and grapefruit. Other citrus scents are noticeable (a bit of mango, orange, and maybe pineapple). Decent malt presence. Mostly hops and grapefruit. Smells delicious.  Taste: Initially, it's very citrus sweet. The grapefruit really gives it a bitter taste. Hops kick in soon after and only adds to the bitterness. It's nowhere near a DIPA. But, the bitterness is very, very good.  Mouthfeel/Drinkability: It's light to medium bodied. Carbonation and abv are pretty much ideal. I really think I could almost session this beer. It's that drinkable. Overall, it's an excellent IPA. Clearly one of favorites in this style. Highly recommended.",Bear Republic Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,93
610,2751,clingman71,3.7,"Pours a deep golden with a slight orange/copper hue. It is pretty clear with a generous off-white head that disspipated leaving a thin but noticeable lace. The aroma is of hops, floral, but not overly citrusy. I smell some piney, resiny hop notes. I get an initial hop flavor that gives way to the malt, but finishes nice and dry. The hop aroma builds as I near the half pint mark. This beer has very good everything, but excellent nothing.

Appearance: Hazy copper color with a sticky white head. Rings the glass through the session.  Flavor: Refreshing hop flavor up front with citrus and pine accents. Some crystal maltiness that is clean and dries out nicely. Balanced nicely but definitely slanted toward the hop end of the profile.  Mouthfeel: Medium bodied with medium carbonation. Finishes dry and powdery. Hop bitterness lingers on the tongue. No alcohol heat detected.  Overall impression: Understated. An approachable West Coast IPA. Seems a tad one dimensional.

Ah yes, now this is an IPA! The hops are there in the finish and are mostly citrusy with some underlying pine, but it is extremely well balanced. The malts are muscular with caramel and biscuit up front that blends extremely well with the hops in the rear and lends a slightly sweet finish, but it's mostly dry.  Mouthfeel is good, just enough carbonation  Drinkability is pretty high despite the 7% ABV. Man, I think I have a new favorite IPA. This is very well balanced, flavorful and refreshing.

The head fades to a cap that last at least in part for much of the beer.  Smell: A floral hop attribute overlays a sweet malty honey flavor.  Taste: Very pleasant flavors but the beer is not quite as big as I anticipate. A beer whose reputation precedes it and brother beer, Hop Rod Rye, is one of my favorites, I had high exceptions. This is more of an approachable gentle sweet IPA like the East Coast more so than what I would have expected from a CA brewer. Nice orange citrus hop with touch of pine and a strong balancing soft malt attribute. Finishes with a light dryness in the back end.

Amber in color with a reddish hue that tells me this one means business. Somewhat hazy after the second pour leaving a mammoth creamy head and superb lacing. Carbonation is on point as well. Hops burst through, mostly piney and a small hint of citrus in the background. More hop attack on the first sip which is well balanced by malts. It's a bigger hoppy flavor for an IPA which is rather refreshing to me. Tingly, yet smooth mouthfeel. I almost started to gargle but swallowed instead.

Bitterness and hop presence right away has me captivated. The mouthfeel is alright, its got the hop oil appeal to it, but its kinda thin compared to Stone's offering (my favorite IPA). The drinkability is of course low for the hop presence, you could probably drink two bombers and be toasted for the night for the most part, especially your taste buds...hehe Cheers!",Bear Republic Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,93
610,2751,KevBrews,4.15,"Appearance: Somewhere between a straw-gold and tangerine with crisp, white head and clean, tight carbonation. The photo above doesn't do the beer justice (so much for trying out the camera phone!).  Smell: Huge citrus hops, reminiscent of Bell's Hop Slam. Pineapple and grapefruit, with the slightest earthy hints deep below and whiffs of caramel as it warms.  Taste: Huge hop explosion--pineapple and mango citrus flavors that demolish the taste buds; well-supported by a solid but unobtrusive moderate malt flavor. The sweet citrus upfront transforms into a dry, earthy hop flavor in the finish--reminds me of the taste of raw hop pellets.  Mouthfeel: moderate--carbonation supports hop flavor  Drinkability: Easy to drink, despite high alpha acids; well-balanced and hides the alcohol well. The finish is a tad much for me towards the end of the glass. That being said, I could still drink a couple of these, although it would have to be toward the end of the evening, so that I don't suffer palate fatigue.",Bear Republic Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,93

Ice cream float-like head, that stays for a while. A mountain range of lace.  Strong hop presence. Hops are a mix of citrus and pine. Smells like a ""wet"" beer, so to speak, with those sweet sweet hops.  Has a nice citrusy flavor, before morphing to bitter (though the bitter is also citrusy too). Gets a lot more bitter as it warms; all properties reverse as the temperature goes up: goes from bitter to sweet. Mellows with warmth. Alcohol-bite pervades throughout. The end hops are a grapefruit.  Smooth and even buttery with a bitter ending; bite at the finish. Thickens as it warms, just excellent. Bitter. Creamy. Excellent.

610,2751,meatyard,3.95,"A bit of a cloudy orangish, amber color. It has a nice and thick white head which dissapates fairly quickly leaving excellent lacing. The smell is not overly strong but is of citrus. The taste is citrus and a little pine with a slightly bitter back taste. The body feel is medium. Easy to drink and goes down quickly for me. This is a very fine example of a strong IPA. I wish it was easier to get here in eastern PA.",Bear Republic Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,93
610,2751,MrBendo,3.8,Hazy orange with a medium head. Low head retention. Good lacing. Aroma of citrus and pine hops and caramel malt. Flavor is moderately sweet and bitter at the back end. Medium to full body. Slightly astringent. Another fine example of a west coast IPA.,Bear Republic Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,93
610,2751,jackorain,4.5,"22 ounce bomber, cool label.  A-Nearly clear with a slight chill haze. Actually cleared up a little as it warmed but then got another punch of cloudiness from the bottle conditioning residue when I poured every last drop into my glass. Sort of a burnt orange color. one inch head hangs around for a good long time settling to a little less than a 1/2 inch that left nice rigns of lace downt the glass.  S- Citrus hops predomintly with some green and pine hops as well. toasty malts round out  T-This beer is really good. Verry hopy with green and citrus right up front. Thee is a nice toasty biscuit malt in the middle that gets pushed back by the hops. Bitterness stay with you for a good long time M-Outstanding medium body, creamy, oily, perfect light carbonation D-I could drink this until I was under the table without switching  Overall- one of the best IPAs I have had. I will have to go back and do a horizontal tasting with my other favs, but it may actually be the best for me.",Bear Republic Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,93
610,2751,rkuhnel,4.5,"IPA is my favorite style along with Double IPA This tends to affect my scores. This one came from a 22 oz bottle. Love that label. Deep golden color tending toward amber with a rich and foamy off white head. Aroma of hops with citrus in the background. Nice feel in the mouth and a very fresh taste that makes this a pleasure to drink. Finish is hoppy, with just the correct bitterness. The alcohol is present but is again well balanced with the malts and hops. An excellent IPA, and for me is about as good as a beer can get. We have a lot of great IPAs around here. I guess it is time for a blind tasting IPA party to sort out the very best.",Bear Republic Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,93
610,2751,Alkey,4.48,"22oz. bottle poured dark gold with some slow bubbles and a spongy white head that sticks to the glass. Smells of citrusy hops and taste much the same with some orange, tangerine flavors and a rather mellow sweet, bitter grapefruit. The feel is slightly watery at first and is followed by a bit of a dry bitterness that makes me want another sip. I find this IPA to be very easy to drink due to it not being as much of a bitter hop blast than some and it is also very thirst quenching.",Bear Republic Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,93
610,2751,bgraney,3.88,"Clear amber, bubbly, sudsy head. Leaves a moderate lacing, not quite a spider web but somewhat impressive. Mild grapefruit aroma, you have to search deep for the malt background. Not a hop monster but a dominant relaxed bitterness, smooth & citrusy. Thin mouthfeel, not much after the initial hop hit. Some grapefruit aftertaste. If one wanted to drink IPA's all night this would be a good one.",Bear Republic Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,93
610,2751,mrasskicktastic,3.68,"A - Clear amber brew with a moderate sized head that dissipated in a few minutes, intricate patterns of lacing form on the glass.  S - Pine and grapefruit flesh.  T - A bit of pine and peppery alcohol that mesh until the aftertaste where the pine shifts into a bitterness, the pepper alcohol stays throughout. The foretaste also has some grapefruit flesh.  M - Medium bodied, smooth and refreshing.  D - Pretty good. I wouldn't say this is fantastic, but it is undoubtedly a solid IPA from Bear Republic.",Bear Republic Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,93
610,2751,kernalklink,4.67,"Wow- the aromas alone were enough for a perfect score. Strong pushy citrus hop presence throughout, but very complex. What a tasty hop filled IPA! Almost perfect balance with the slightly spicy malt, nice body and sweetness. A little oily on the finish, but what else can you expect. Hops are strong, but no annoying burning aftertaste, your palate will be safe and satisfied. Extra smooth going down and the light ABV and masterful blending makes this one a very sessionable IPA.",Bear Republic Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,93

610,2751,bringonthehops,4.84,"22 oz. bottle. Poured into pint glass.   Appearance: 2"" dense head. Racer 5 is caramel colored, with a hint of hazy orange. The head left substantial lacing down the glass as the beer was consumed.  Smell: Hello hoppery!! Nice orange and grapefruit notes weave their way through the waves of hops that pervade the aroma.  Mouthfeel: Medium-heavy bodied. A bit resinous.  Taste: Immediately, the hops are bracingly bitter (they do soften out a bit as the beer warms). The hops quickly step aside to reveal a resinous mid-pallate that is predominated by hops. It's really hard to find any element of sweetness in this beer. Grapefruit rind predominates a finish that lasts more than 30 seconds, with hints of the 7.0% ABV providing sturdy support. Racer 5 is surely one of my favorite IPA's. It's full and bold enough to shine above many Double IPA's I've had, and at 7.0% it doesn't hit you quite as hard.  Drinkability: I could easily drink 3 or 4 of these in an evening...but I'd probably pay for it the next day. This is not a light beer, and probably wouldn't be the best choice for a session beer, no matter how badly you want it to be. Besides not being a wimpy IPA, this beer is entirely drinkable!",Bear Republic Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,93
610,2751,jtell,4.38,"Pours a hazy orange with a thick frothy head that sticks around pretty well and leaves plenty of lacing. Smells of piney hops with a nice solid malt background. Nothing mind blowing but smells great. Taste is near perfect I think. Perfect hop and malt balance. Mouthfeel is creamy and refreshing. Drinkability is awesome. Hops dont overpower, alchohol is masked and it keeps flowing. This is one of my favorite beers. Probably one of the beers that I buy most often. I am a fan of all the Bear Republic beers I have had so far and this is no exception.",Bear Republic Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,93
610,2751,dedrinker,3.85,"This here IPA is one good west coast example - good malt body, but not too sweet or sticky to get in the way of the dominant hop profile - lots of sweet, fresh sticky green hops here. It's halfway to being a double IPA, or these days ""west coast"" style about sums it up. Back east here we don't always get regular fresh supplies of hoppy west coast goodness, but when we do, we must keep drinking it over and over until it gets fully impressed on our minds. Only then can we return to defensively enjoying our ""well-balanced"" east coast beers.",Bear Republic Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,93
610,2751,Tyrawlings,4.2,22 oz. Bottle poured into a pint glass.  A: Hazy amber in color with orange hues around the edges of the glass. Off white head pours two fingers thick and dissapates into a soft blanket of micro bubbles that covers the top of the pour. Nice lacing.  S: Juicy citrus hops and pine resin. Biscuty with a strong malt presence. Slight waft of earthy undertones.  T: First sip reveals grapefruit and mango. Fresh citric and pine hops give off an immediate but pleasant bitter bite. A rich caramel malt pushes through and is followed by a slick butter like aftertaste in the nose. Finishes very clean and refreshing.  M: Oily from hop resin but very smooth and clean. Medium carbonation. Clean dry finish.  D: A perfect example of the West Coast IPA: Full of flavor and impeccably balanced. Wickedly clean and refreshing.

610,2751,Talisker,4.62,"The quintessential West Coast IPA. Absolute benchmark for the style, and a pleasure to drink to boot.  Reviewing here a pint glass from the tap, but I've had Racer 5 in all forms - 22oz bombers, 12oz bottles, on tap at the brewpub, hand pump at the brewpub, and even on nitro at the brewpub.  Color is a rich orange, some pleasant haze. Head can be a little meager, but that's the only knock.  Smell is the most beautiful in the world - pure American citrusy hops, with a bit of pine in the mix. Orange, grapefruit.  Enough malt in the taste so that it's not one-dimensional, but not enough to distract from the juicy American hops. This is a hoppy beer, but not a particularly bitter one.  However, in this sample (and others in late '06/early '07) I've picked up an faint, almost acrid bitterness on the finish. Doesn't quite seem to fit, but some might find it a nice complement to the citrus profile.  Mouthfeel full but not sticky, ideal for the style.  What are you waiting for? Racer 5 defines the style.",Bear Republic Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,93
610,2751,ChainGangGuy,3.92,"After a moving company completely destroyed 40% of my meager belongings this afternoon, I dare say I could use a beer!  Appearance: Pours a light amber-copper color with a massive khaki-colored head and abundant lacing.  Smell: Rich, intensified floral-citrus aroma with a veritable basket of juicy fruits (grapefruit, oranges, pineapple). Lighter traces of pine and honey.  Taste: Honey and toffee sweetness progresses into a fruity, citrusy combination of apricots and oranges (and to a lesser extent, grapefruits). Again, there's pine and even some breadiness and mint roaming around the taste. However, the grapefruit and pine flavors really come to live and amplify on the assetively bitter finish.  Mouthfeel: Medium-light body that is at times chewy and oily.  Drinkability: In all honesty, this reminds me of Avery's Maharaja with the Racer 5 being just a bit more drinkable.",Bear Republic Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,93
610,2751,dherling,3.78,"Poured out a slightly orangey honey gold color with a HUGE foamy off white head. The nose offered grapefruit, spice, yeast, green hops. The taste is mostly yeast to me, backed by malt, then with lots of oily hop resin bringing up the rear. Has a slightly crisp mouthfeel and is pretty drinkable, hiding the 7% very well.",Bear Republic Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,93
610,2751,ruinationation,4.12,"Pours a cloudy light shade of amber with orange hues. Thin head that doesn't last.  Big hop smell right away with some floral notes and citrus. A damn good smelling beer.  Great hope bite that I was expecting from the smell. With a pine and citrus finish. This is a nicely made IPA to me.  Quality consistency, not to thick.

610,2751,Drew966,4,"Racer 5 India Pale Ale pours a light copper color with a white head from a brown twenty two ounce bottle. It has a nice, hoppy aroma that is somewhat floral. The taste is definitely dominated by hops, once again of a somewhat floral nature. The flavor really falls somewhere between a typical ipa and a double ipa. The malt is definitely in the background, but does a nice job of balancing this beer. An enjoyable beer.",Bear Republic Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,93
610,2751,mobud,4.19,"Served into pint glass from growler.  A- This beer is light copper in color and is a little cloudy. Light head with active carbonation.  S- Boy, do I love hops! The hop explosion waiting for me is beyond explaining here. Sweetness and floral notes from the hops grab from the start.  T- Not the overwelming hop bomb I felt I had. It is big on hops, but also has a nice malt undertone that helps to level the floral goodness left by the hops.  M- The best part about the hops remains and there does not seem to be any bitter aftertaste.  D- I have had a lot of HopBombs and this is one of the best. Some leave too much resin and no sweetness to balance out the beer. This one is great and would have it again and again.",Bear Republic Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,93
610,2751,dickroop,4.84,"Stopped in at RFD in DC, and saw this among the 30 on the tap list. Had to try it, SO glad I did. I know I'm an incorrigible hophead, and my ratings reflect my preference. But hey, there's no accounting for tastes...  This was served in a tumbler with almost no head. The color was unusually light, a sandy-colored yellow, not quite clear. But AHHHH, the smell... the nose on this brew was indeed exceptional, one of the richest outpourings of floral, citrus hops that I have ever smelled. Right up there w/ DFH at the brewery. I drank, I moaned, I loved it.  The flavors were hops, hops, and more hops. Some hints of grassiness and some smells and flavors that remind you that the hop plant is related to the hemp plant. Rich, aromatic, yummy. Enough malt to balance it (if you're a hophead), but not enough to distract from the main attraction. The mouthfeel was medium-light, the finish was clean and bitter and flavorful, the beer was not just drinkable, it was gulpable, inhalable, guzzlable. I Coulda woulda shoulda got another one, BUT I as in a 30-tap establishment and I felt the need to sample more of their offerings. But I will look for this again, in bottle, on tap, whereever, whenever. Recommended, for sure.",Bear Republic Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,93
610,2751,uberabr,4.59,"Found this bad boy at my local wine store. I hadn't heard too much about it and decided to give it a try...  Poured from a bomber into a tulip. A hazy golden-brown amber with minimal head retention but decent lace. Carbonation is excellent.  Smell is very nice and quite strong. The hops are overwhelming and of the Western grapefruit/cascade variety...there are definitely a few types of different hops working together here. Some peach, mango, and of course grapefruit, along with a subtle buttery biscuit as well. Overall a very fresh and woodsy quality that's hard to describe and present in all of my favorite pale ales from Cali. Very nice.  The taste is a virtual explosion of hops that starts with a fruity pine and ends with a bitter grapefruit bite, along with a creamy, buttery aftertaste that was present in the nose. It's very complex and very well rounded, a noteworthy combination...giving a bold quality that is ideal for this style of IPA. Mouthfeel is perfect: Full and bubbly and easy all the way down. Drinkability is great too, although this brew is definitely more of a sipper because the taste is so rich. I would definitely drink this one again.",Bear Republic Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,93
610,2751,JohnnyM2002,4.48,"Sampled from a 22 oz bomber, poured into a red wine glass at 45 degrees.  A - At first, it was a clear pale straw color with a mild off-white head, but as I added more, it took on more of an orange hue that was very cloudy. The still-off-white head was much more pronounced and left sticky lacing on the glass.  S - Delightful aroma of citrus and floral hops. Some grassy notes in the background. More on the fruity end.  T - Delicious, very well-balanced flavors of juicy citrus fruits and earthy floral notes...all atop a powerful backbone of hops. Bitterness comes through in the end. Can't be much more descriptive, other than this is what every IPA should taste like.  M - Medium body (but not too filling) with a creamy, bitter finish. No detection of alcohol...except when the whole bottle was gone.  D - As I mentioned earlier, this is exactly what I expect from an IPA. My favorite style has become a DIPA, but they're obviously not too drinkable because of the high ABV. This would make for a perfect session beer and one of my top after-work selections.",Bear Republic Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,93
610,2751,BeerBelcher,3.77,"This is a very good IPA, but given all the excellent American IPAs/APAs on the market, I thought it above average in its style, but not a truly elite beer. I think that Great Divide Titan IPA and Bell's Two Hearted are both significantly better as far as ""big,"" hoppy US IPAs go.  I had this beer on-tap at Roman's in Milwaukee.  It poured a copper/amber color with a fairly abundant head with good staying power (and left nice lacing). Aroma is Cascade/citus hop goodness, but is not overpowering (BTW - I like overpowering Cascade/citrus-ness). Taste is more of the same; assertively citrus-y, but not really powerful flavor. Mouthfeel is good, but not overly sticky. I liked this beer, but with so many wonderful choices in this category, I have a hard time putting it at the top of the stack.",Bear Republic Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,93
610,2751,GbVDave,4.47,"Served in a pint glass at Map Room 1/20/07.  A: Nice looking hazy golden color. Served with a bubbly one finger head that quickly dissolved to a faint, whispy skim. Low carbonation.  S: Major aroma of pineapple. Hops very dominant in this one.  T: Begins with pineapple that slowly changes over to pine towards the finish. The malt is not very pronounced but it lends a perfect balance and makes the hops toe the line.  M: Bitter, drying mouthfeel that feels almost perfect.  D: The balance makes the drinkability high with this one. The wonderful hops and subdued malt are an exercise in expert balance. Good thing this beer has excellent distribution in IL.",Bear Republic Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,93
610,2751,JayQue,4.65,"A great IPA. Made a pilgrimage to ""Half Time"" in Poughkeepsie, NY and this was one of my trophies. Pours a hazy amber color with some ""chunks"" in it. Nice big white head and good lacing. This beer has a good, spicy/citrusy aroma to it. You would know this was going to be a memorable experience just by the smell. The taste is outstanding, citrusy, spicy and above all a nice bitter hops flavor. This is comparable to Hop Otten, Celebration Ale and any of the other good IPAs I have enjoyed.  Mouthfeel is a bit watery, compared with Celebration Ale, but the taste is the deciding factor in making this a great beer.  I would consider this as high on the drinkability scale as 7.0 abv would allow. This is a very enjoyable IPA and I would look forward to having another if offered.",Bear Republic Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,93

The aroma was very hoppy, with light citrus, and roasted malts.  the flavor was a great balence of hops and malts, with a great bitterness in the end. Flavors of citrus and light sweetness. Very smooth and drinkable for how hoppy it was.  This is one of the best American IPA's I have tried..get one.",Bear Republic Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,93

610,2751,oakbluff,4.33,Poured from a bomber courtesy of HogtownHarry of ratebeer. Pours a beautiful golden classic IPA colour with a nice thick white creamy head. Smell is very floral. Smell reminds of Stone IPA. Taste is very balanced with a fantastic hoppy sweet malt backbone. Very flavourful and aromatic. Everything one could want in an IPA. Medium carbonation and extremely quaffable. I could drink this every day. A wonderful classic west coast IPA.,Bear Republic Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,93

Left bits of lace. Nose is grapefruit, tart citrus almost smothering sweet hints of peach and malt.  There was more malt sweetness up front than I anticipated. Nice!! It was quicklu and wonderfully offest by citrus sweeping in as expected. Nice mouthfeel, a quaffable beer.

610,2751,Phyl21ca,3.95,"Bottle (Courtesy of Hogtownharry): Poured a dark beige color ale with a big foamy head with good retention. Aroma of fresh citrusy hops is totally dominating. Taste is also dominated by fresh C-hops and can be best describe as chewing on a grapefruit. This is truly the most grapefruit I have experience in an IPA. While this is a very interesting beer, it is also a one-dimensional beer lacking complexity IMO.",Bear Republic Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,93
610,2751,tboom29,4.3,"Another big West Coast IPA. This beer was a light copper color, with a huge white fluffy head, with alot of the head clinging to the sides.  This smelled strongly of hops and citrus grapefruit notes were present. A bit of peach throughout as well.  The first sip really coats the mouth with a lot of hop flavor and essence. Balanced by the citrus flavor that was in the nose. There is some malt presence, but make no mistake this one is about the hops. It has a nice medium mouthfeel, and a smooth yet spicy finish. The beer for this review came from a bottle, but I've since tried it on tap and it is even better.

Smell: very floral, light spiciness, citrus, lemon, orange, grapefruit, sweet caramel malts. Smells very juicy with a pleasant pine resin overtone.  Taste: Initial strong caramel malt and vague honey flavor. Moderate pine hops with citrus dry finish. The orange is a strong player in this brew. There is a new balance between the fruitiness and the pine hops. Distinct floral and earthy tones.  Medium bodied, very heavy on the malt in a pleasant way. The alcohol is well used. Very easy to drink. Sessionable. I wish I could have this more often. It would be part of my standard line up.  I've also had this from the bottle and it is equally good.",Bear Republic Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,93
610,2751,SacoDeToro,4,"Pours a rich golden yellow with a small white head.  The aroma is of intense citrus fruits and sappy pine resin.  The flavor of the beer has an assertive hop character that's both resiny and citrusy (grapefruit). The maltiness of the beer was lightly sweet and biscuity.  The mouthfeel was light, which aids to the drinkability of this great beer. The carbonation was tight and dialed in.  This beer's been around for a while and anyone who sips a pint will surely hope that it stays for some time to come. An American classic.",Bear Republic Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,93
610,2751,Foxman,4.35,"It pours a slightly hazy and carbonated ingot gold. A finger of off-white head settles evenly to a berber rug of froth. Hillocks of lacing landscape the inside of the glass.  The aroma sees sweet malt twisting caramel and toffee, along with biscuit and berry fruit. A light sense of citrus and pine dances gingerly about an airy hint of alcohol.  Upon tasting, it's malt first with caramel, blueberry, and melon, after which the hops stomp on the sweetness, drying the grounds with resinous pine, crisp grapefruit, and a lesser tinge of juicy orange. A slight yeasty tang and baked dough lead into a biting, dry bitterness, lingering long. As hoppy as it is, the malt stands strong for a nicely blended balance.  Medium bodied, the malt is chewy, the hops oily, and the palate well pleased.  Its reputation precedes it, and it does not disappoint. It's full, lively, balanced, blended, and damned good. The ABV is moderate, but aptly wrapped inside a very drinkable offering. So, Trixie cries, Go Speed, beat the Acrobatic Team!

610,2751,scruffwhor,4.06,"Appearance- Great, doughy, light beige head. Excellent retention. Something you could stick your finger in and feel the foams welcoming grasp. Thick quarter inch head throughout the whole bomber. Great Autumn colored haze with a little sediment suspended nicely throughout the whole brew. Leaves a lot of very sticky lace all over.  Smell- Good, just not as stand out as I feel it should be. You can taste more than you can smell at any point while I'm enjoying this beer. The aroma of citrus zest is only mild while lacking a better balance with the toasted malts.  Taste- Very floral rendition of grapfruit skin. When you sink your teeth into the real thing, its rather unpleasant. But when you drink that same flavor in a beer, it becomes pleasant. Better definition of the mlats, but only as a ,uted hint of what could be.  Mouthfeel- Is chock full of pleasant bitterness, but just lacing that balance needed between malts and hops to be a great IPA.",Bear Republic Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,93
610,2751,woemad,4.18,"Big-ass bomber purchased at Huckleberry's in Spokane for $3.99, I believe, a few months ago. There's some sort of information stamped near the upc symbol on the label, but it's too illegible to tell if it's a freshness date or not.  This is the best looking beer I've had in a while. It poured a golden shade of copper with a big, thick, rocky white head that took it't sime dissipating and left luxurious sheets of lace on the sides of my glass.  This smelled pretty damn good. A mixture of citrus, pine, bread, all perfectly balanced, though a tad more restrained than it could have been (woe likes his hops).  Taste pretty much like it smelled. The bitter, piney aspects of the taste seem to hit the tastebuds first but they are balanced by the more citrusy hops and the subordinate but still sturdy bready malts. Encountered on the rideout is a pleasing but not palate thrashing dryness. Very tasty!  Mouthfeel and carbonation is spot on. Nice, hop oil-ly mouthfeel with a moderate amount of body means no complaints in this department.  I'd be happy to quaff several pints of this at my local were it to be found on tap.

Very active head that spills from the open bottle. In the glass, very stubborn, with some beautiful lacing.

610,2751,nlmartin,4.5,A big thanks to fartingdog who sent this as part of BC-2. The beer was served in a pub glass.  Appearance: The beer pours a clear amber coloration. Very active carbonation rides to the surface of the beer. This beer produced a nearly uncontrollable head. The head was a thick fluffy biege coloration. The head of the beer never left during the session. Thick rings of lacing remain on my glass.  Smell: This beer has a execellent hoppy pine juicy citrus smell. The beer has under currents of sweetness and spicy alcohol.  Taste: This beer delivers a very sweet juicy citrus hoppyness that pairs well with the pine resiney hops. The finish on the beer is dry bitterness. Overall this is a very well balanced IPA.  Mouthfeel/ Drinkability: The beer has a plus sized medium body. The beer is aggressively carbonated and prickly. The flavors are long lasting. This is a dam fine and tasty IPA. The beer was very easy to drink. I had problems setting this beer down. I could session this over the course of an evening.,Bear Republic Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,93
610,2751,ClockworkOrange,4.5,"Poured from a 22oz. bomber into a pint glass. A - Golden honey color with barely an inch of eggshell tinted foam. S - Surprisingly sweet citrus smell, bubblegum, nice rich malts. T - Beautifully balanced between the mild spicy floral hops and the near perfect dose of malt. Light, dry mildly bitter finish. Sweet all the way through. Awesome. This is balance defined. M - Very smooth and moderately carbonated. D - This Great IPA from Bear Republic is, to me, a catch 22. It is so good that I just have to have sip after sip, yet at the same time, so close to perfection that I want it to last as long as possible.",Bear Republic Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,93
610,2751,flexabull,4.45,"Pours a bright orange color with a big foamy head. Beer has a really slight haze to it.  Aroma is citrus, and pine hop goodness. Also a bit floral too.  Taste is crisp and dry.. Hops are very present in the flavor, citrus and a bit bitter up front, yet somewhat creamy on the finish. There is also a hint of alcohol in there. This beer is well made, there is a good balance between the hop bite at the beginning, and the creamy malty finish.  Mouthfeel is good, flavors linger in the back of my mouth.  I have always considered this one of the better made American IPA'.s It is a tad bit high on the alcohol compared to some others, but this is a very good and drinkable beer.",Bear Republic Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,93

Also a slightly floral hoppiness.  Taste is what is to be expected... Hops, and lots of 'em. Some grapefruit and some lemon zest. There is also a light bread like maltiness towards the finish.  Mouthfeel is perfect and this is a pretty drinkable brew.",Bear Republic Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,93
610,2751,trep,4.18,"22oz Bottle Thanks to IntriqKen  Hazy orange body with a creamy white head. Leaves a lot of lacing as it fades. A good bit of tiny sediment in suspension and lots of tiny carbonation bubbles rising to the surface. Juicy hops dominate the aroma with a bit of malt and alcohol as well. Actually, a good bit of alcohol.  Aggressive hop bitterness ignites your tongue from the first drink on. Malt profile is there, but hidden beneath a blanket of hops. Not perfectly balanced like Two-Hearted but pretty close. Very refreshing. Citrus and pine hop flavor is excellent and leaves you with a grapefruit bittersweet aftertaste.  Medium crisp body initially, then after a second the carbonation bubbles up and makes it feel creamy. I like dis. Nice balance between carbonation and body also. Very refreshing and drinkable. I'd like to have a 6-pack of this for a cookout in the summer.",Bear Republic Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,93

Definitely a four pinter.",Bear Republic Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,93
610,2751,isaac,4.48,"A - Pours a light, hazy copper with a small, off-white head, which shrinks into clumpy bubbles and lace relatively quickly  S - Very strong hop smell, clean and fresh, very citrusy. Slight hints of alcohol and roasted malt.  T - Wow. Big hops taste from the start that never really leaves - very juicy grapefruit and grass bitterness. Underlying bready malts throughout as well. A bit watery in the middle, however. Finish is dry and refreshing.  M - Medium bodied, maybe even on the thin side. Until the finish that is, which gets nice and thick. Carbonation is a bit overdone  D - Very high. I enjoyed this beer immensely.",Bear Republic Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,93
610,2751,dhchatfield,4.43,"Poured into my Duvel tulip on Halloween night.  A - A beautiful light golden copper. Loads of fluffy head. Nice gentle lacing.  S - Sweet hops. Not too bitter to the nose. I am more of a DIPA guy, so this one seems subdued.  T - Fabulous. Hoppy for sure, but again with a balanced bitterness, strongly offset with a very sweet finish.  M - Fluffy on the tongue, very full across the mouth. Fills the palate with a creamy, sweet lasting impression.  D - The highpoint of this beer. I've had this one at least 5 times before, and tonight I honestly can't remember how many times I said to myself ""Man! This is a good beer!""  The fact that this beer is readily available makes it even more appealing to me. If you can't find it, trade for it, call Liquid Solutions, do whatever you can to try it.

610,2751,MSchae1017,4.63,"This beer was tasted in a pint glass from the 22oz bottle.  This beer pours a golen amber with a frothy and rocky white head that holds fantastically well and leaves tons of lace. The smell is very sweet with tons of citrus hops. The taste is full hop bitterness and flavor but malty enough to not overwhelm you. There was also a bit of piney hops in the finish. The mouthfeel is smooth and medium bodied with nice natural carbonation.

610,2751,akahn,3.96,"Pours a golden, glowing, hazed orange color, with a healthy, fluffy white head.  Very fresh aroma. Orangy citrus mixed with crisp pine. A sharp tangerine-apricot thing too. Subdued but potent.  Bold flavor, but carefully balanced and structured. Hoppy, juicy, and resiny. A bite of alcohol, along with a good deal of malty backing.  Substantial medium-plus body. Carbonation is fairly strong, matching up with the hops' strong prickle. This beer is a bit too bitter for me to just put down, but if you're into real hoppy beers, this one is real tasty.  This is a big IPA, and it's good. But for me, it doesn't live up to the hype.",Bear Republic Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,93

Medium creamy head & a lot of large and small particulate matter, which adds to the glowing amber hue. Not clear at all.  Nose is clean with hops, pine and citrus - maybe cube farm air dulls the olfactories? Hoppy bitter flavor gives sensation of ""taking a bite out of a good IPA"". Sugary apple delights gustatories and big grapefruit lingers. Straight forward hopped up yummy. Substantially chewy and slick, light chalk on the backside. Makes me hungry.

610,2751,lpayette,4.23,22oz bomber.  Appearance- Golden yellow. huge head with tons of lacing.  Smell- Big floral hop aroma. Citrusy- mostly grapefruit. Orange and orange peels.  Taste- Very typical big IPA taste. Grapefruit is a powerful force as it is tied to the hops which are dominating in a good way. A bit of caramel flavor as well.  Mouthfeel- Quite smooth. Adequate perhaps perfect carbonation. Can't imagine it being better.  Drinkability- Quite drinkable for a strong IPA.

This is a killer IPA that gives you everyting= Killer aroma, great malt body with a wide variety of hop aromas, flavors from the beginning to the finish. This is my first beer from Bear Republic and I am impressed. Almost sessionable for hop-heads and at 7%, not too alcohol heavy.

610,2751,jamie2dope,4.25,"I had this one over the summer at Redbones, and I gotta say that I wasn't exactly impressed with it. Everything deserves a second chance though right? So anyway, this one pours a sort of plain amber color. What made it really pleasing is that the head sticks to the glass like crazy, along with the just barely visible sediment floating here and there. Smell at first seemed slightly metallic, then with another whiff, gave way to some citrusy aromas, really juicy smell. The citrus is accompanied in the taste by a literal attack of hops on the palate. These are some really aggressive hops, that never quite seem to end. The initial citrusy presence seems to end with a more earth based ending. The mouthfeel is medium in body. Drinkability is great, but i guess thats assuming that you really like hops, cause this one definitely has them. Im really glad I gave this beer a second chance. I think i will get it again folks.",Bear Republic Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,93
610,2751,loving44,4.13,"Pours a dark orange amber from the bomber. Large bubbly head fades to a creamy white head... about an inch.  Smell: lots of citrus, mainly grapefruit and orange. Zesty. Sweet with some pine.  taste: sweet malt along with bitter hops up front, juicy and powerful but not overpowering. This has a wonderful balance of hops and malt with a refreshing bitter kick.  Mouthfeel: very creamy and light. low carbonation.  Drinkability: This is one of the better IPAs that I have had. This is a hoppy beer but it's no hop bomb, just a very refeshing ans tasty IPA.. I saw this beer in lots of liquor stores, and beer stores and even the local grocery stores many times yet never tried it. My advise to you: pick one up!!! You will not be let down, I could drink this everyday.",Bear Republic Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,93
610,2751,SkeeterHawk,4.6,"I picked this one up outside of LA at Liquorama while there to do a job. Time to give this one a try.  Appearance: Pours a pretty cloudy burnt orange color with an aggressive 1"" of off white bubbles on top. The head is thick and looks like it is going to be around for quite some time...especially since there are boat loads of bubbles rising to maintain it. A couple minutes after the pour, there is still a huge head on top of this one. There is boo-coo's of lacing left on the glass after drinking leaving sheets on the glass.  Aroma: I get a whole bunch of citrus in the nose with lemons and grapefruit in particular. Deep within it, there is a bit of caramel malt, but the hops are in charge of the aroma through the massive head.  Taste: The flavor has a big introduction of hops with all of the citrus that I got in the nose, but there is a big malt presence to this beer also to give the hops some resistance. There is big malt here, but even bigger hops. The malt never takes control of the flavor profile, but only compliments the hops. It is interesting about this beer in that there is a big floral hop contribution that is apparent late in the finish to go with the citrus hops and the alcoholic warming. The finish of this beer is never aggressively bitter, but there is still a boat load of hops in this one. I like the fact that they actually let it finish hoppy, yet not really hugely bitter and dry with a chalky feeling on the back of the throat. As the beer warms a bit, the malt comes out a bit more and leaves you with a mildly syrupy impression on the back of the throat to enjoy late in the finish.  Opinion: I am not a hophead, but I am really impressed with this beer. Yea, it has the essential huge hop character, but it still remains drinkable. I don't really know what else to say. This is a pretty fricking good beer, and I would certainly drink it again. Nuff said!",Bear Republic Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,93
610,2751,RedHaze,4.5,"Picked this bottle up in Spokane.  Pours a bright golden orange color, with a rocky two finger head, that settles very slowly to a thick, quarter inch head, leaving behind a very thick sheet of lace.  Smell; lots of pine and citric hops, as you would expect, with a soid backbone of caramel malts. There's also a bit of a herbal/grassy aroma. The more i smell this the better it gets.  Taste; as expected the hops are the main part of the flavor profile, with a bit of pine, grapefruit, oranges and those grassy notes. The caramel malts have enough of a presence to offset the hop bitterness a little, with a touch of a biscuits. mouthfeel is medium bodied, and very smooth, with just a great drinkability.

A nice American IPA that doesn't go crazy with hops. don't get me wrong,this is hoppy,but it's not overly bitter. The citrus flavor and aromas dominate this beer. The taste is very crisp with light bitterness and a very drinkable citrus flavor,grapefruit? This is a truely great beer that should not be missed. A 7% beer that could be a session beer.

610,2751,BlackJeremiah,4.18,"Poured from a 22 oz. bomber into a pint glass.  A: Medium amber in color. Pours a 2"" head that is fluffy and pillowy. Lots of lacing as I proceed.  S: Pine tar, hop oil, citrus/grapefruit, massively hoppy scents. In fact, the layers of hop scents are all I can smell. Enough to wake a guy up in the morning, but I would have liked some indication of the presence of any malt at all. After tasting it, the aroma does not reflect the balance of the beer.  T: Citric acid, pine sap and oily hop bitterness smacks the palate, making this one take off with a bang. Slight malt sweetness toward the end, mitigating the hops and the late alcohol burn. Excessive in the best way possible; something in the water out in Cali?  M: Really good presence, feels lighter than some of the other high-hopped IPAs I've tried. Keeps the refreshing qualities of a regular Pale Ale.  D: Definitely a hop-bomb, but I love that. The malt sweetness disappeared as I drank, but that's just a function of palate destruction.

610,2751,Cresant,4.25,"Poured this undated 22 oz. brown bomber into a Stone IPA glass. It took three pours to empty this bottle due to the enormous head created each time, four fingers or more. Head was frothy and bright white. Eventually head faded to a cap leaving clumpy fingers of lace. Body was clear golden, light copper until the last pour when the yeast particles clouded the drink.  Smelled great. Floral, grapefruit. Herbal. Mild alcohol presence. Rich aroma with staying power, nice.  Tasted refreshingly bitter. Very juicy citrus. Rinds and pith. Slightly minty. Dry lingering finish. The last third of the beer was perhaps richer and yeastier/more bready than the earlier pours. Quintessential West Coast IPA.  Mouthfeel was zesty, medium bodied.

Taste is strong bitter at first but soon subsides into a complexity which is quite nice. Lots of herbal character and piney grapefruit hops in the middle. A touch of sweet fruit rides the entire wave. Almost apple like, maybe grapes too. A touch of toffee, some banana. It's complex but straighforward at the same time. Hops control.

Do I really need to say more? Hops assault the palate and never let up. Citrus and piney. I'll still be tasting this beer tomorrow. Also a hint of peach laying in the background to stand this beer apart from other hop-heavy IPAs'. Mouthfeel is good. The hops have a sticky feel and make the tongue tingle.

A: Golden-bronze with a fluffy white head; only a little retention, but it leaves a nice lace.  S: Plenty of citrus & pine with a touch of floral hop aroma; a little toffee & candied fruit.  T: Plenty of pine & citrus hop flavour (the Columbus & Cascade provide a well-round hop flavour). Toffee & candy-floss/candied fruit; balanced with an assertive (but pleasant) bitterness.

Side note...I've been drinking this beer for years, and every bottle I've poured has has an INSANE amount of sediment, I mean chunky as hell, even more than Chimay White... THIS bottle, however, had a small amount of very fine sediment. Did they change their techniques or did I buy a freak bottle?  Smells of perfume. Pungent, fruity, piney, and citrusy hops all rolled into one.  Taste: bitter, but oh-so-round around the edges. Loads of fruit: ruby red grapefruit, tangelos, mangoes, lychee, fruit cocktail with corn syrup. Malts, including carmels, are simply along for the ride. Gives me the slightest headache from the perfumey hops.  Mouthfeel is smooth. Not overly sweet or heavy. Drinkability is very good. No problems here.  Widely available around here.

Smell is powerful citrus hops, a whiff of caramel malt begins to appear as the beer warms.  Hops in the taste are far more complex, with pine and spicy notes in the sweet citrus mix. The malt in the aroma improves in the mouth, too. The beer has an appreciable balance for such a heavy hop addition.  Middle-of-the-road mouthfeel, with a very comfortable alcohol level.

Head never goes away and stays until the last drop.  S: Hops hit the nose like a ton of bricks followed by some very zesty citrus scents. Enough malt in the smell to balance everything out.  T: Very different than any IPA I've ever had before. This threw me off guard. Taste is like a mixture of hops and sweet peanut sauce. Bitterness of the hops is very strong but not overpowering. The nutty malt is right along side it for the duration of the drink. Finish is very bitter like grapefruit, aftertaste is bitter, yet sweet as well. After awhile the peanut taste started to become overwhelming. This is unlike anything I've ever had before. This would go great with Thai food.  M: Medium bodied, fair carbonation, pretty smooth.  D: A very interesting IPA. This is definatly something I would get again when in the mood for something as odd as this. As good as it is, not something I could drink a whole lot of.

610,2751,Westsidethreat,4.12,"A: A very clean, vibrant marmalade with loads of little bubbles wavering back and forth as they make their way to the top. Solid, two finger head of off white tight bubbles create a great top hat on a very nice looking beer.  S: Ah yes, westcoast IPA. Loads of healthy citrusy smells; grapefruit, lymon and tangerine.  T: Loads of citrus. Immediate tangerine flavors which stay with the drinker thru the entirety. Various degrees of grapefruit and lime along the way. HInts of honey and very minor caramel as well. Spicy, floral and Finishes with a solid bitter wash.  M: Medium bodied with good carbonation.  D: Solid westside IPA.",Bear Republic Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,93
610,2751,Estarrio,4.42,"Poured a translucent, coppery, golden, brown with a small white head. The head disappeared rather quickly.  Aroma of sweet malts, oranges, and piney hops.  Sweet malt taste with orange and grapefruit flavors. Big orange taste up front with the grapefruit lending to the aftertaste. The sweetness is balanced by potent and piney hop presence. Ample amount of hops to feed my hophead addiction. Nicely hopped and extremely well balanced with the sweetness. The 7% is well masked.  Well carbonated with a nice mouthfeel. Texture is slightly syrupy up front with a little dryness in the finish.  This is a highly drinkable IPA, due to its extraordinary balance.",Bear Republic Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,93
610,2751,RenoZymurgist,4.05,Poured a light amber with a thick creamy white head that stuck around for a long time and left a little lace on the side. The aroma is like a freshly crushed simcoe hop cone. A bit of earthiness but a nice piney hop aroma with a bit of a toasty malt aroma blended in. The flavor begins with a nice piney hop bitterness which segues into a very clean toasty malt flavor and the finish is very clean with almost no hop bitterness lingering. This is a superb example of the IPA style. The mouthfeel is perfect for the style and It shows that the brewers put a lot of work into this beer as the malts balance the hoppiness both in sweetness and in viscosity. I would love to have this beer as readily available as SNPA.,Bear Republic Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,93
610,2751,Blakaeris,4.3,"Poursn hazy orange-apricot with a huge frothy head that leaves intricate lacing.  Smell is citrus hop with excellent peach character. The malt backbone adds stability. Very juicy.  Taste is much more mild and balanced than expected. Once again the floral/citrus hop character stands out. Caramel malt and mild fruit add balance and complexity. Finish is mildly bitter and spicy.  Mouthfeel is medium bodied. Slightly oily, and very smooth.  This is a really good IPA. Very smooth and drinkable. Hops are aggressive, but not overpowering when compared to the malty fruitiness.",Bear Republic Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,93
610,2751,InsolublePancake,4.05,"A- Nice deep golden color with a surprisingly modest head that dissipates quickly. Good lacing, as expected.  S- Lots of piney and citrusy hops in the nose with a noticeable malt sweetness.  T- A bit of sweetness up front before the hops hit with an orange rind bitterness. Toasty malt quickly follows and continues into the aftertaste. Bitterness is surprisingly low on the finish.  M- A little thin in this department, but still nice and smooth.  D- Very good drinkability thanks to the excellent balance. The ABV is the only thing that would keep me from making a session of this.  Very nice beer, although not in the realm of the truly elite IPA's in my opinion. Still a great everyday IPA that is good drinking and won't break the bank. Recommended.",Bear Republic Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,93
610,2751,Viggo,4.22,"Pours a hazy golden/orange, thick white head forms, lots of lacing, great retention, head lasts until the end. Smell is rad, pine and grapefruit up front, pineapple, toffee, citrus, superbly balanced. taste is grapefruit and pine, pineapple again, oranges, maybe some vanilla, nice and full flavoured. Mouthfeel is medium to full bodied with low to medium carbonation, some warmth going down. Very clean bitterness in the finish, great balance. Excellent IPA.",Bear Republic Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,93
610,2751,yemenmocha,4.3,"Pale gold in color with overly generous head. Lots of Belgian lace as I drink it. Sexy.  Nose is fruity with pine, maybe apricot.  On the palate the peachy/apricot/mango whatever sweetness is quite pleasing, and of course the blast of hops to round things out. Surprisingly very drinkable for such a big IPA. Fuller bodied than I had expected. Preferably drink this one on its own. No food please.",Bear Republic Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,93
610,2751,uvascotto,4.57,"A - Deep, clear crimson-brown.  S - Hops and more hops, with something else that I can't quite put my finger on.  T - Complex, hops-dominated flavor but with a wonderful balance of flavors.  M - Perfect consistency of the fluid-phase, coupled with an appropriate level of carbonation.  D - A downright pleasure to drink and the bottom of the bomber is truly an unwelcome sight. This is what beer is all about.  Without question one of the best AIPA's I've had, and as a highly-biased drinker of AIPAs to all other styles, that's saying something. If you lie this one, Bear Republic's Hop Rod Rye is also a winner for many of the same reasons.",Bear Republic Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,93
610,2751,dbalsock,3.45,"Appearance: Pours a light caramel color with about one finger of white head.  Smell: Very citrusy, although I couldn't pick up any grapefruit like I was expecting. Also, the hops smelled raw, like they were still on the bush. Pretty interesting, but not overly enticing for me.  Taste: It tasted much like the smell, except it was more balanced than the nose let on. A malty sweetness creeps along the palate, definitely adding to this IPA by giving it some balanced character.  Mouthfeel: This brew was light bodied and bitter. Nothing in the mouthfeel stood out to me.  Drinkability: I found this fairly drinkable due to the balancing in the taste. Also, I didn't detect a lick of alcohol, which is pretty impressive for a 7% abv. For some reason I get the feeling that this is better from the bottle.",Bear Republic Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,93
610,2751,FlyFisher2782,4.03,"Racer pours with an awesome amount of light and fluffy head that stays around a long time. No kidding, I got at least 3 fingers of head, with a conservative pour.  Carbonation in this particular brew was very high, in fact a bit too much for me, it interrupted the srinkability slightly.  As far as IPA's go, this one is a cadillac, very smooth, the grassy hop smell hits you when you open the bottle and doesn't dissapoint. However, the hops do bite you late in the palate and they give way to an ultimate finish of malty biscuit.  Definitely a piney IPA finish that is very nicely rounded out for a smooth drinker. Rare case of a very drinkable IPA   This is a very smooth and drinkable IPA, personally a little too soft for my tastes but nonetheless a good brew.",Bear Republic Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,93
610,2751,brewcrew76,3.8,A - Pours a golden orange with a rocky white head. Very slight haze.  S - Mostly piney hops with a little bit of grapefruit and grass.  T - Piney but the grapefruit and especially the grassy flavors become much more apparent. This one is very grassy in the taste.  M - Well carbonated with a nice dry/bitter finish. I keep getting these grassy burps after each sip.  D - A nice IPA that emphasizes the piney/grassy hops. This one goes down very easy for 7%.,Bear Republic Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,93
610,2751,mynie,4.7,"Great IPA pour. Perfect, large head atop orange bomb pop opaque at the top and hazy honey bottom.  Excellent, eye opening layered zest hops. Grapefruit and citrus and caramel and pine all pour at you in buckets.  Tastes like resinous pine that moves into huge, giant grapefruit and then a more subdued dry hop. All backed up by a wonderful caramel. The hops are gigantic and the malt is perfect.  World Class.",Bear Republic Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,93
610,2751,EPICAC,4.33,"I went to Red Bones for dinner tonight. Red Bones always has an excellent beer selection. This was served in a standard pint glass.  Appearance: Pours a hazy golden with a creamy thin white head that clings to the glass leaving nice lace.  Smell: A nice, strong, citric hop aroma is dominant, with a more subdued bready maltiness.  Taste: Sweet bready and toasty malts and an intense tart citric hoppiness.  Mouthfeel: Light-bodied, tingly carbonation, with a lightly oily texture.  Drinkability: Very refreshing, the alcohol is also well hidden.  Overall: A very nice IPA. The toasty and bready malts balance but don't steal focus from the hops.",Bear Republic Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,93
610,2751,bashiba,4,"Poured a hazy light orange with a creamy long lasting white head.  Smell is full of intense grapefruity hops  Taste has a bit of light caramel malts, but is quickly taken over by the strong mix of Grapefruit, Juniper, and minty hop flavors.  Mouthfeel leaves a nice clean and refreshing feeling with a nice little coating of hops.

610,2751,ppoitras,4.48,"22oz bottle from bleedingshrimp as part of 120/190 BIF. Thanks for the opportunity, been meaning to get to this one.  Poured into an imperial pint glass, formed a 1 1/4"" beige head over the clear golden amber brew. Pillowy head lasts nicely, with heavy but sporadic frothy lacing. Aroma is lightly lemony hops with an undercurrent of controlled sweetness. Taste is upfront a nicely balanced flavor of grains and citrus hops, which slowly gives way to allow the hops to gain center stage. Mouthfeel is smooth and clean, and drinkability is superb. One of the more controlled West Coast IPAs, I like it.",Bear Republic Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,93
610,2751,Beerzebub,4.05,"Somewhat cloudy amber, finger of nice white head. A thin layer remains for some time, and leaves good blotchy lace. Fresh grapefruit dominates the nose, with some maraschino cherry, and muted darker notes of wood and damp earth.  Tastes mostly of grapefruit and pine, with some maraschino cherry again, and a slightly astringent, woody finish. Good bitterness, not over the top. On the dry side. No noticeable alcohol. A well balanced and refreshing IPA. Get a bottle!",Bear Republic Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,93

610,2751,Sycodrummer,3.68,"Had from the tap at Sunset in Allston, Ma. Presented to me in tulip glass the beer was a slightly dark golden/yellow color with one finger of frothy white head and little to no lcaing throughout the sample. No other outright signs of carbonation were to be seen.  The nose only has a suprisingly subtle hop bill to it. The aroma is more earthy and slightly floral. Hints of hoppy citrus come through but overall rather tame.  The taste features a hop profile that is bigger in the nose, but still rather subdued for the style. Some associated bitterness but far from a stinging hop bomb. A rather hearty malt balance lends to a slightly sweet taste in the finish with some slightly floral flavors. Overall the taste is well balanced, a characteristic not shown by most beers of the style. Rather mild in body and hop character as well.  Medium body and crisp to the finish.  This beer is certainly enjoyable and certainly very drinkable, but it pales in comparison to others of the style. The beer's balance is quite good. I would have like some more assertive hop character and bitterness with this one. A good beer on the whole, but not high among my favorites for the style",Bear Republic Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,93
610,2751,phisig137,3.87,"Pours a light amber color, with a frothy 2 finger head that slowly falls leaving behind abundant lacing.  Aroma is filled with citrusy hops, and a slight hint of caramel sweetness.  Flavor is well balanced. Not outrageously bitter, but solid amounts of citrusy hop flavor, backed by a decent malt backbone. Very enjoyable, and easy to drink. Mouthfeel is smooth, and bubbly.  Very nice beer overall, although I notice a trend in Bear Republic beers.... they all seem to use the same two or three hops. Not a bad thing, just something I noticed.",Bear Republic Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,93
610,2751,JayTheFinn,4.54,"I finally got off my butt and tried the much acclaimed Racer 5 from BRB Co.  A - Deep deep orange body with a minimal but lasting off white head. Nice lacing. S - Wonderful array of scents like orange, strawberries, grapes, flowers. One of the best smelling beers I've ever had! T - Strong hop bite. Citrusy, flowery flavor. Good balance of sweet and sour. M - Fairly full. D - Very drinkable for the marvelous flavors, though I'd probably stop at one due to the powerful hop kick.",Bear Republic Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,93
610,2751,wedge,4.45,"Pours orange with some haze from the bottle-conditioning and strings of carbonation. Thin, sticky, creamy head on top is a permanent fixture and leaves thin sheets of lacing. Smells very appealing - freshly squeezed citrus hops, candied and rich. Juicy citrus hop flavor with sugary malts to balance. Oh yeah, this is very delicious. Drying rind with a floral sweetness in the end. Solid medium mouthfeel with fine carbonation and a smooth bitterness.  A fruity, juicy IPA...all out hops yet, this is far from one dimensional. Pure, fresh squeezed Cascade and Columbus hop juice. Top notch.",Bear Republic Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,93
610,2751,warmstorage,4.5,"Many, many people have reviewed Racer 5, and while I usually don't bother to review something that has been extensively reviewed. However, for this beer, I just had to, as it's a damn near perfect basic West Coast style IPA.  22 ounce bottle, ~$3.49 at BevMo, into a beer clean pint glass.  Pours bright medium orange, with a fairly dense white head. Visible carbonation with small tight rising bubbles.  Aroma is slightly spicy malty sweet hoppy: just what an IPA should be.  Taste is primarily spicy, pine, citrus hops, with a perfectly balanced sweet malt back, and finishes with a nice piney hoppy swing. Just what an IPA should be. Middle and finish has a tingly, fairly carbonated mouth.  Immensely drinkable, beautifully balanced, fresh and citrus hop beauty. Not a hop bomb, but rather a perfect delivery vehicle for great hops and sweet malt.  Great for everything from a lawnmower beer, to a session beer, to a nice dinner beer for spicy (or not) foods, to a sit-and-watch-a-movie dessert beer.  I generally don't give 5s unless a beer just blows my mind, and Racer 5 is *just barely* below the border for this. But it's damn near perfect, and awfully close to 5s in every category.",Bear Republic Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,93
610,2751,SethB2,4.63,"It's about time I reviewed this wonderful beer.  Poured from a 22oz bomber into a pint glass.  A - Hazy golden oranged with a massive head that climbs the glass. When the head finally goes away (after a long, long time), a butt load of lacing is left in its wake. Perfection.  S - Hops, citris and pine mostly, covering a toasted malted quality.  T - One of the most balanced IPAs on the planet. Starts with a bitter punch to the tongue, but very delicately begins to balance out. Usually balance means that the beer gets sweeter, and this one does too, but not nearly as much as one might expect.  M - Good stuff. Medium and a tad oily, but still finishes a little dry. How the hell is that possible. I don't know either.  D - Great.",Bear Republic Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,93
610,2751,KarlHungus,4.58,"This brew pours a cloudy orange color. The head is large, thick and somewhat creamy. The lacing is thorough and thick. The aroma is pleasing and rather complex with citrus and pine both being prominent. The taste leans a lot more toward pine than citrus. The mouthfeel is exceptional for an IPA. It is medium bodied and very creamy while still being very lively carbonated.

610,2751,BradBLR,4.46,"Another great beer from Bear Republic. Beer poured a deep amber gold color, with a THICK yellow head. The head on this beer was amazing, lasted the whole beer and when I was done the was a chunk of foam in the bottom of my glass. Like a little prize at the end of the beer. The smell was a nicely balanced hop, malt smell that was not too strong.  The taste was a strong hoppy flavor with a medium malt flavor. The mouthfeel was great, it was like hop oil coated your tongue after each drink. Carbonization was good and the beer was nice and thick.  All I can say is try this beer.

Wow...I've had this before a long time ago but I don't remember it being so hoppy and sweet...and quite as awesome. Aroma is really balanced and beautifully hoppy. Sweet malts and citrusy cascade hops everywhere. Has an additional candy orange feel to it. Very pleasant hops, and a nice bitter dryness especially through the finish.

Has a really herbal earthy hop nose, a little remincent of a barley wine if you ask me, with pine and citrus and grapefruit, not too agressive, just right and quite nice. Taste is the same way, really earthy pine hop, a solid biscut malt base, with that same barley wine kind of hint in the aroma, perhaps from yeast?, with a slight bittering at the end. Either way, Really smooth and delicious mouth. Overall, just a really good beer.",Bear Republic Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,93
610,2751,veggiemafia,3.93,"Bomber split between me and someone else, served in tumbler pints.  First off, this was obviously not the freshest example of this beer as there were HUGE floaties. Seriously, size of my pinky nail. This is not the fault of the beer, but without a DATE of any sort, how was I to know when I picked this up at Bierkraft? Kind of disappointed, really, because I've not seen this in PA before, and people seem to just love it. So who knows if I'll get another chance on this one.  Appearance is good, but for the enormous floaties. Good head, good retention, good color.  Smell is very nice. Piney and resinous, but with good grassy and floral notes in there, too. No real off-flavors, to my surprise.  Taste is similar, but bigger on the piney hop, less on the grassy/floral notes. Good malt balance. A little big on the pine for my taste, but that's a personal issue.  Mouthfeel is good, medium body, medium carbonation.  Drinkability is OK. Don't know how I would've felt after a whole bomber of this.  Disappointing experience, though. DATES ON THE BOTTLES, PEOPLE! PLEASE! There's no excuse not to.",Bear Republic Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,93

Aroma: Malty caramel aroma with overtones of floral hops. Slightly citrusy & reminiscent of pine needles. Fruity. Not overly bitter smelling. Well balanced in the nose.  Taste: Sweet caramel beginning & middle balances with bittering hops in the finish. Perfectly balanced. Savory, full flavored IPA.  Mouthfeel: Chewy, medium bodied texture. Wonderful crispness & clean throughout. Not cloying at all. Leaves a fresh feeling...  Drinkability: Easy drinking! Very smooth with every sip. Goes down with effortlessly.

610,2751,hoffman,4.03,"Crystal clear pour aside from a distant haze. Perfect pour yields a nice off white head rising and falling to a nice cap on the brew. The color is a light amber/honey with some reds...very nice. The smell is very pronounced, citrus outwieghs the piney hop notes with a background of toasty malts and an almost varnishy, sweet cedar smell, if that makes any sense I do find it quite nice. The hops and toasted malts come together to form the cedar aroma. The taste is pure and clean smooth toasty malts in the beginning, citrus in the middle and both mixed with a subdued hop finish. Nice and well rounded. Somewhat unimpressive compared to the Hop Rod Rye from this brewer. But still a darn fine entry. The mouthfeel is quite nice if not a bit watery, overall it is quite good. Immensly drinkable and easily quaffable. The quasi-high levels of alcohol are masked very well and do not effect the taste but do sneak into the aroma. Try this one if you can.",Bear Republic Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,93

A hoppy aroma full of pine floats over the beer.  Each sip of this thin to medium bodied beer is somewhat chewy with a light tingle on the tip of the tongue. The flavor is very hoppy with notes of pine and hints of pepper. A biscuity malt flavor in the background helps to balance out all the hops. Some piney bitterness and a hint of malt remain when the beer is gone.

610,2751,audiojon,2.62,"This is my second time trying Racer 5, the first being on tap. I remember it tasting better than this, maybe this is one that is better kegged? Smell is tasty enough, very piney, but the taste is off a bit to me. It seems like the alpha acid levels are out of wack with the rest of the beer. The mouthfeel is not right either, not enough carbonation (which could explain the mysterious lack of head too).

610,2751,instrumentality,4.23,"The Racer 5 IPA poured a light amber-orange color with a nice, one inch fluffy white head that settled to around 1/4 inch while still retaining its fluffiness.  The scent was primarily the typical piney hoppy aroma with a fruitiness somewhere between a pear, a peach, and a pineapple.  The first sip was surprisingly clean, smooth, and flavorful. The piney hops were strong and bitter, but this was undercut by a mild fruit enhancement very similar to the pear-like flavor I recall from the Avery Maharaja IPA, although maybe slightly less tart.  It's not too harsh on the palate, and the bitter aftertaste isn't too intense, which definitely earns it some points over some other IPA's I've tried. I like the bitter, hoppy flavor, but I don't like having it coat my tongue and ruin my taste buds for all other flavors.  As with the Maharaja, I like this added complexity of the pearlike flavor, and as far as fruits go, this could be the best compliment to an IPA, but there's something not quite right about it, like the fruit is ever so slightly overripe. If the fruit aspect tasted just a little bit fresher, I think I'd be sold on the concept, but I think that's just the nature of this style, not the age of the beer.  Of my reviewed IPAs thus far, Stone IPA is still my favorite, and this one ties with the Maharaja (although the numbers may not match) as it's nearly identical as far as I can recall. Some day I'll have to drink the latter two head to head and see if I can better identify the distinction.  Definitely worth the price of admission, all things considered.",Bear Republic Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,93

Very nice balanced and slightly carbonated feel.  D - Very drinkable. This is my first BR brew. I've heard great things about Racer 5 and now I know why.

610,2751,TheBungyo,4.65,"A winner of an IPA. This was one of the first IPA's my palate decided it liked. Drinking it now, I'm surprised I liked something this bitter and piney. The pour results in a orange body teeming with head. In fact, the head is a tad too robust for me. I like head on my beers, but on an IPA I want an inch or so, not 3 inches. The lacing is masterful, better than anything else I've witnessed recently. If it wasn't for the gushing head, the appearance would rate a 5. Nose is nice and balanced ... lots of caramel malt, and lots of grapefruit and pine. Almost exactly what I want out of an IPA. Taste starts piney, edges into grapefruit, and orange and finishes lemon and caramel. Mouth is massive, carbonation runs rampant, but in an orchestrated fashion, blitzing over the mouth in a mission to please. Mission accomplished. Certainly a sessionable IPA. I'd be more than glad to do so if I found it in sixers or on tap.",Bear Republic Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,93
610,2751,TurdFurgison,4.04,"I tried this beer at the Yardhouse in Long Beach, served in a pint glass. The appearance was pale orange with no head (maybe due to the bartender's technique).  The smell is overwhelmingly hops, and the flavor is mostly hops but with some malt balancing it slightly. Almost no bitterness in the after-taste, so it was really easy to drink. A very good IPA.",Bear Republic Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,93
610,2751,asabreed,4.48,"Bomber into a pint glass.  Appearance: Huge head that keeps building and turning into almost what a Belgian would look like; the carbonation keeps pushing it up, and it's clumping around the middle and bubbling around the edges. Huge amount of bubbles too, as I said. The color is a light golden yellow. Lacing continues to clump and look like a Belgian and the head is indomitable.  Smell: Huge floral and perfume from the hops. Not much citrus or pine, but tons of welcoming sweetness. The sweet malt characteristics are also balanced well. Aromatic and effervescent stuff.  Taste: Awesome balance between the malt and hops. The sweetness from both comes through very well. I get some fruit from the malt and the perfume from the hops. Very nice.  Mouthfeel: Slightly astringent, but the carbonation has settled down from the initial pour. For how sweet it is as an IPA, though, which I'm not used to really, it never becomes cloying.  Drinkability: It seems to be easy enough to make an IPA, but likewise it seems hard to make one that's singular in nature. This brew, however, is pretty awesome for the style. As I said, it's sweeter than most I've had, but for the balance it ends up working well.

As I drink it down, its possibly the best look IPA I ever seen, let alone beer I've seen in the past few months. A hazy orange with white head and lacing all the way down the long weizen glass.  Smell and taste, however, are less amazing. Smells and tastes of west coast hops, very cascade like. Piney, citrus, grapefruit together at once. It was a good and balanced flavor, but lacks the complexity that would make this a great beer. Not overly bitter for the sake of being bitter like some IPAs, it earns it bitterness and flavor.  Very good mouthfeel and drinkability. I had no idea this was 7%, felt like any other good IPA.

A: Hazy goldenrod body topped with 3+ fingers of rocky, white head. One of the most exciting IPAs to watch. Bubbles zip to the top and the head sticks around forever. As I drink it down, huge waves of lacing cling to the glass. If it doesn't get rinsed immediately, it will take a sandblaster to wash the lacing out of this glass.  S: Muted but fresh hops. Mostly sweet citrus with touches of pine. Sweet malt underneath that provides a background to the hops.  T: Probably the most balanced IPA I have ever had the pleasure of tasting. Seems to be working backwards. Fresh, tasty, bitter hops up front finishing with sweet malt. Bitter (piney) hops in the aftertaste.  M: Carbonation is great. Light feeling, but enough body to give something to taste.  D: Tasty and fun to drink. I'm drinking it a bit too fast because it is so enjoyable.",Bear Republic Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,93
610,2751,VoodooBrew,4.23,"22 oz. bomber. Bottling date unknown. It's quite possible that this beer had been at the store since last fall, since I purchased a few others that did have that kind of age on them. But hey, I can't get this where I live so I was willing to risk picking up a past-its-prime beer.  Mostly clear orange-copper with creamy white head. The nose offers clean, fresh citrus, albeit on the light side. Sweet hops jump to the front of the palate, offering juicy, crisp citric flavors. This leads right into a firm and focused bitterness that rides right into a bitter/slightly tart finish. The alcohol begins to stir in the gut, and that sense of well-being begins to set in. Aahhh... Racer 5 is a clean, enjoyable brew with all the credentials of a great West Coast IPA.  As I said, this beer might be on the old side. Not that it's gone bad mind you -- at 7% ABV it has a decent shelf life, but it seems to me that, as good as this beer is, it's likely even better and hop-licious when fresh.",Bear Republic Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,93
610,2751,jhu1995,3.83,"Poured a very pale orange color. Medium, white head, with plenty of lacing as the beer is consumed. Smell was mostly citrus with some peach flavors showing in the background. Taste was similar to the smell. Light to medium body and pretty drinkable. I have a tendency to get bored with hoppy beers after one or two of them, but this one kept my interest long enough that I would grab another.",Bear Republic Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,93
610,2751,soultrain,4.78,"Poured into an Ommegang Chalice.  A-Opaque golden-orange with great ""straight line"" carbonation. Some chunks of hop/yeast goodness present. 1"" white merangue foam on top, excellent lacing: by the finish sides of glass are coated all the way down with thick ropes of lace. Mmmmm. S-This beer smells fantastic. Citrus/Grapefruit hop lovers dream come true= My dream come true, too. T-This is my idea of a great California IPA, an orchard of citrus, some pine, some grass, malts there in a hop supporting role, but mostly beautiful let-me-appreciate-this-moment citrus hops. Did I mention citrus? The bitterness in this IPA just rules, and I could make some uneducated guesses to which high I.B.U. west coast hops were involved in making this awsome IPA (Columbus and Cascade?), but no, I think i'd really rather enjoy this beer....sometimes writing a review is more fun that drinking the beer, but with this Bear Republic Gem, that is not the case. This beer is one on the reasons I entered ""American IPA"" in my profile; it's better than looking at ""apparently, none,"" right? Right. This beer finishes semi-sweet/semi dry, and if that's a peculiar statement, so's the fact that 7% alcohol is nowhere to be found. Christ, I want more... M-Good mouthfeel. Smooth light/medium body. D-An IPA lover's wet dream.  CRUX: AWSOME WEST COAST IPA. As Stone Ruination has become impossible to find around here, this has taken it's place in my DBF where it's ALWAYS at hand, and my world is all the richer... With this and their masterpiece ""Hop Rod Rye"" in their portfolio, Bear Republic is indeed a WORLD CLASS BREWERY. REALLY, REALLY GOOD STUFF: I wish my voice was loud enough to sing their praises. HIGHLY RECOMMENDED.",Bear Republic Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,93
610,2751,sinistrsam,4.18,"Picked up this bomber at Once Upon a Vine in Richmond. Poured a clear, amber-gold with some shampagne-like bubbles and a 1 inch head that stuck around my Duvel snifter and left great retention. The aroma was a fairly typical IPA, very piney hops and somewhat citrus-y, honey and some sweet fruits. The taste was interesting; typically what I expect from these IPAs is a bitter and hoppy which peaks, shocking your taste buds for a split second before fading into a sweeter aftertaste. This had little or not ""punch"" or ""peak"", which I have to admit I enjoyed. It did start piney and hoppy, dry and a little bitter, but faded before the punch into a smooth mellow sweetness, possibly some caramel aftertaste. Very smooth, excellent transition, and I have a feeling it is a bit more complex than I'm explaining here. Very good taste in general. The feel was bitter and dry at first, fading into a sweet smoothness as stated above. Not much carbonation. I thought this was highly drinkable. A little higher ABV but I polished off this whole bomber and wanted more. This is my first Big Bear brew, and I sure hope its not my last.",Bear Republic Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,93

Ok, um, dark amber, sort of like, beerish, color. Tastes like IPA. Great burp taste too. Do not discount that.",Bear Republic Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,93
610,2751,doubleipa,3.5,"Picked this up while on business in Maryland. Fair amount of hops in th earoma, but not a whole lot. Has a different hoppiness that most other IPAs, in my view, even though there is a lot of grapefruit present. Head disappears quickly.at recedes fairly quickly. Carbonation is good. Can't say that I would want to pick another of these up.",Bear Republic Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,93
610,2751,bignick,4.59,"On tap at The Publick House in Brookline 4/20/06. Served in a pint glass.  This is a huge kick-in-the-mouth American IPA. The smell incredibly pungent; the stong citrusy hop scent foreshadows what's to come. The taste of hops really nails the palate, and it is uncompromised in its dryness. This is one hell of a west-coast IPA, and has long been one of my favorites.",Bear Republic Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,93
610,2751,neonbrown82,3.65,"This is a decent IPA, but not something I would want to drink alot of. The hops kind of have that crushed aspirin flavor. Good in small doses, but not refreshing, which is a quality I tend to look for in an IPA.  The beer pours to a clear golden blonde color with a wispy white head that recedes fairly quickly. Carbonation is good. Lacing is alright as well.  The smell is good. Lots of grapefruity hops. Not much else. Sweet and malty. The taste is syrupy and grapefruity with a big crushed aspirin amarillo flavor. Doesn't seem to be too bitter, just very sweet and citric. Would probably be bitter with a little less malt (and thus a lower ABV). This formula seems to do well for them, however. Whatever.  The body is fairly light, but it has a sticky, syrupy hop flavor that dries out somethin' fierce. Not something I'll be drinking again, unless it's just a small sample.",Bear Republic Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,93
610,2751,Shultzerdugen,4.55,"22 oz. brown bomber with no date I could find.  Clear light copper in color with a white clinging big bubbled froth that laces and rings down the glass.  Pine, pancakes, pineapple, grapefruit, and caramel notes in the nose.  Medium bodied, initially crushed velvet smooth, the mouthfeel turns oily and slick with a blasting grapefruit taste as it develops. Resinous pine sap, herbal notes, and candy sweetness show as it warms. A cracker-like malt backbone plus the sugary sweetness hold up well to the hop onslaught.  Although I favor the Amarillo/Warrior hop flavors, it's hard to beat the tried and true C-hop flavors for AIPA's. One of my favorite examples of the style.",Bear Republic Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,93
610,2751,MarineHokie,4.42,"A - Redish gold color slightly hazy. Ample head sticks around & leaves light crystal lacing.  S - Pine, fresh garden veggies and hints of juniper. A little scent of malt sweetness sneaks by as well.  T - Soft piney hop bitterness attacks the tip of the tongue with spreading out across its breadth. The malt fights through briefly and futiley before being crushed by a bitter hop finish.  M - Light body, smooth carbonation, nearly mouth puckering bitterness.  D - Amazingly drinkable considering the ABV & IBUs. Like this brew in a 22 oz bottle, but nearly amazing on tap.",Bear Republic Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,93
610,2751,OStrungT,4.11,"This beer pours a light golden yellow. The head is light yellow. It fades slowly, leaving many lac es.  This beer has a grassy aroma. It smells slightly piney. It has a little cirtus to it, but not much else. None of the aroma is too strong.  This beer tastes a lot like it smells. Grassy, with a slight pine flavor. The citrus flavor makes a slight apperence.  This beer is crisp and refreshing. It goes dowm smooth, leaving a grassy hop aftertaste. It is carbonated well.  I think this beer would be a good session beer. It is not overbearing. It is just slightly high in alcohol, so that wouldnt be too much of a problem. I will have this one again.",Bear Republic Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,93
610,2751,electrified,4.79,"Orange/copper in color, a little hazy. Nice head, some lacing. Smells of high-grade cannabis and grapefruit. Smells wonderfully hoppy. Full-bodied and smooth and somewhat creamy. Very nice. Taste is hops and more hops -- citrus and grapefruit -- and a malty, biscuity background, but hops dominate. Wonderful.",Bear Republic Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,93
610,2751,IntriqKen,4.35,"I like Bear Republic Brews even though I know a lot of people find them 'unique' versions of style This pours a nice clear orange amber with a craggy white 2 finger head that melts to a wonderful lacing that follows the drink throughout the glass. Aroma is slightly sweet hops with light fruit and maybe pine. Taste is all hops to start with then a sweet grapefuit that leaves a dry aftertaste. Mouthfeel is smoothly buttery or oily with tiny carbonation and light alcohol burn as you swallow. Very nice west coast IPA....not as smooth (or mild) as Bridgeport IPA, but not meant to be. I can drink several of these",Bear Republic Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,93
610,2751,Maestro,4,"This is a cloudy orange beer with a foamy, tan head that leaves a creamy lacing on the glass. The smell and taste are both strictly hops. Mouthfeel is a bit oily but makes for a smooth drinking beer. I understand the whole west coast vs. east coast debate, but I know many east coast IPAs that are just as good, if not better. I drink this again and it is a good IPA, but I can do just as well in the east.",Bear Republic Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,93
610,2751,Birdiebeagle,4.25,"Bottle Pours a clear golden with a fizzy white head, that produces good lacing and lasts fairly well. Has a good hoppy aroma of spruce. Has an oily texture with good carbination. Has a real good duration with a nice strong bitter finish.This is what I love in an IPA. Bold and powerfull. Very well done. Has a very smooth ability to hit you with a solid bitterness. I highly recommend this one",Bear Republic Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,93
610,2751,numenor1,4.23,"Fairly clear light golden orange in color with a fluffy, thick bubbled sticky white head that laces exceedingly well. Smells like fresh cut pine with a citric quality to it. Starts with a dry bitterness which is fleshed out with nice caramel and toasty malt through the middle with scales moving back toward pine sap and orange through the finish. A very nice even keel bitterness is present throughout and lasts long on the palate. A bit of alcoholic spice bite near the end too. This is beautifully balanced, definitely avoiding the candied hop taste that some IPA's lean to. Body is medium full with creamy carbonation. Fairly drinkable, i'm finding, i'm taking no time with this bomber...",Bear Republic Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,93
610,2751,ultralarry2006,4.47,"This was poured from a 22 oz. bomber leaving a 2 inch head that subsided into an inch by halfway down, to 1/2 inch the rest of the way, leaving thick lacing all the way. Hazy golden orange amber. Aroma of pine and more pine, slight malt sweetness. Taste was exactly like aroma- pine, and citrus, with slightly underrepresented malt backbone, but good nonetheless, finished with more pine. Mouthfeel was full and smooth with thick (oily?) bitter (good) taste on tongue and in mouth. Drinkability- I enjoyed this- a very good IPA and one I will get often.",Bear Republic Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,93
610,2751,RoBotGod,4.44,"One of the many good beers from this series. This beer gives off a very light rustic color, but packs a good punch. The nose is strong and very potent. To me, it gives off the smell of 2 different kinds of finishing hops. Its like drinking liquid copper. The supper hop flavor is complimented by smooth malt and grains. Goes down smooth with not to much of a citrus bite. The boiling hops are a little more calm. It doesnt leave your mouth dry. Sharp finishing/aroma hops matched with mellow boiling hop makes the best combination. This is the IPA that drinks like a golden ale with a kick ass hop combination.",Bear Republic Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,93
610,2751,Suds,4.07,"This brew has a huge white head, foamy and rocky, that sits atop a golden-amber colored liquid. Its fairly clear, makes for an attractive beer. Smells like a whole lot of hopsgrapefruit and pinehugely West Coast. The hops almost wholly eclipse a faint malt character. The taste is centered on bitterness, with a detectable malt sweetness in the foretaste that offsets the hops. Lots of hops and edgy sharpness in the finish. Medium body and very pleasingcertainly a hop monster!",Bear Republic Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,93
610,2751,rousee,4.45,Another fine beer by Bear Republic. Pours clear amber. A small head of foam diminishes to a wisp in a matter of seconds. Some nice looking lace remains on the sides of my glass.  Smell is sweet and fruity. Some woody elements too. Taste is a smooth well balanced blend of malt and hops with a nice piney and citrussy hop kick. Quite smooth --almost peachy or apricot-ish. Excellent.  A velevet like mouthfeel and a great smoothness make this an excellent version of this style. One of my favorite IPAs. Even better on tap.,Bear Republic Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,93
610,2751,Rezzin,4.5,"A - Amber orange with some tiny floaties if you look close. The head is white and fluffy and just looks wonderful. The floaties don't bother me at all and just remind me that this is a craft brew.  S - Smells great. Piney and citrusy. Clean maltiness peaks it's way through but the hops are still the star here.  T - Piney and resiny with a little sweet malt. Lemons, grapefruit... there's just enough malt to balance things out but the hops are the dominant flavor.  M - Moderately carbonated. Goes down smooth and finishes crisp from the bitterness. Refreshing in an IPA kind of way.  D - This one of my favorite IPA's. Very well balanced with just enough snap to remind you that you're drinking an IPA and not an APA.",Bear Republic Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,93
610,2751,ressletr,4.11,"This beer poured a nice amber like color, with an awesome head. You can definitely tell that this beer was bottle conditioned. Extremley smooth for an IPA. I would actually consider this beer to be quite dangerous, no alcohol taste at all. The malt in it is outstanding, it laced the glass all the way down. I never had such a smooth IPA, if you haven't tried it yet, be sure to do so. I'm an Alesmith IPA freak but when you are looking for a smooth IPA please look at the Racer 5. I was pleasantly surprised with this ale. This beer is awesome, can hardly imagine it being an IPA,. I have seen a beer that laces all the way down to the bottom,. :-)",Bear Republic Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,93
610,2751,DarkerTheBetter,4.55,"This beer poured a glowing apricot with a few suspended clear bits floating around in it. The head was slightly off white and looked like a frothy meringue that left a little lace behind.  Smelled of juicy nectarines and grapefruit with a little pineapple sourness along with a pleasant hint of bubble gum.  The taste began with a dry citrus hops that immediately fell to a peach and apple fruitiness. It then picks up some almost lager like doughiness giving this beer a superb clean finish.  The mouth feel was light with a full mouth of bubbles.  Although this is an IPA, it was the smoothness of the malt in this beer really stole the show. This ones delicious, and I highly recommend it.",Bear Republic Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,93
610,2751,LPorter33,2.92,"Purchased 22oz bomber from Martignetti's  Appearance = Good looking murky, dark peach colored golden browm. Decent head which fades quickly but leaves some intricate lacing. Small bubbles rise up giving a mild sense of carbonation  Smell = Very piney fresh hop scent. Super clean and crisp. Citrus flavors are there although not as dominating as the pine flavor. Still a great, strong intense scent.  Taste = Hmm...strange tasting. My initial impression was one of severe disappointment. It's way too sour, almost like the hops have faded away. There's no umph or kick...just a bitter sourness like someone squeezed lemon juice in here. Mouthfeel is flat and has little carbonation which surprises me. I think this. As I drink more of this, I see the taste isn't awful, but it is WAY below the IPAs I'm used to drinking and contains absolutely nothing special or unique.  Overall = a serious disappointment considering Bear Republic's reputation. I had high hopes for this beer but I can think of 15 IPAs of the top fo my head that I'd buy before I try this one again. I hold IPAs to an extremely high standard and this one did not meet my constaints. Did I possibly get a bad bottle?",Bear Republic Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,93

Granted most of this is from memory, but I do recall enjoying the well-balanced hop and alcohol. I did not realize that this was a 7% beer, the mothfeel is nicely rounded since the amount of hops and alcohol do not overwhelm the other. The brewer did a good job with the full flavor.

This is a great example of what an American IPA should be.  Mouthfeel: smooth with a bite of crispness at the start and finish. The aftertaste is short with the flavor tones.

Nose was fruitily hoppy--citrus and apples. really rose out of the glass nicely.  Flavor was a classic Californian IPA. Lods of hops up front that was loadied full of sun-warmed fruit. Oranges, lemons, apples and pears. The bitterness was balanced erfectly by a nice malty background. Actually, it was maltier than I was expecting from its appearance. Very full mouthfeel. Juicy and chewy. that 7%ABV really snuck up on me too.

It dies down but never completely disappears...which is different from most of the IPA's I have had. The hop aroma comes through as citrus with a little pine scent. Very nice smell. The taste isn't as ""hoppy"" as I would have thought...but it does hit you as you swallow.Not too bitter. Very smooth IPA. Only a slight prickly feel on the toungue. ABV hidden nicely by the hops.

Very good lacing.  Nice grapefruity nose, but tamer than I expected. Still inviting though.  Taste wise, the sweet caramel barely gets pass the starter's flag before the hops come roaring down the straightaway, passing on all sides. They don't scratch the paint abrasively though, and the beer down shifts into a nicely fruity victory lap.  Good medium mouthfeel, neither syrupy or watery. Enough body that you know its there.  Drinkability is just fine thanks. This bomber's fuel gauge will be reading empty all too soon.  All in all, a race well run.",Bear Republic Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,93
610,2751,bkett01,4.55,"First, thank you germaniac for the beer...  Poured into a pint glass with a quarter inch head over an inviting hazy orange/amber brew. Appears well carbonated and packs an overwhelmingly hoppy aroma. Combines a fresh green and citrusy scent.  I was suprised how smooth this was off the first taste, but it finished strong with a hoppy kick of a finish. A crisp orange/citric taste stands out over a very mild malt presence. This beer clearly focuses on the hops and is one of the more drinkable IPA's I've had at 7%. With a smooth yet lively mouthfeel provided through the hops and carbonation, I'd recommend this IPA to any of you out there.",Bear Republic Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,93
610,2751,waughbrew,4.28,"Very orange, hazy, nice head though a bit small. Bold nectarine-orange aroma that is sweet like candy. Good balance of toasted malts and smooth fruity bitterness. The finish is too clean in my opinion, disappearing before I want it to. I want a little bite that is just not there. Ultra-smooth and insanely drinkable, the bomber was empty before I knew it and I still wanted more.  This is a very good, enjoyable, quaffable beer. That being said, nothing about it really stands out to me - I feel as though I have had many beers very similar to this, though not many better. Possibly the least distinct beer in the top 100 currently, but I will enjoy it now and then since it is, indeed, a very pleasurable drinking beer.",Bear Republic Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,93
610,2751,scottoale,4,"Out of the 650ml bomber pours a little bit murky, straw colored gold ale, with a finger of lasting off-white head. Good carbonation keeps the head up with a sticky, resinous lacing trailing till empty.  First I smell the bottle and fresh, piney hops leap out and fill my nasel cavity completely. Smelling the poured elixer more abundantly FRESH, resinous hops take over, owning my sense of smell. Gee, I wonder what this is going to taste like?  Tasting the liquid gold hop-bomb goes something like fresh piney into citrus, orange, lemony, grapefruit with a tiny hint of clove for the finish. If this isn't a true American IPA then I surely don't know what is! This stuff is a mega hop lovers dream and a simply delightful one at that. I think the hops alone hide the alcohol in this one, and very well indeed.  Smooth medium body mouthfeel with a crispy clean, breath of fresh air finish. This is a very easy beer to drink, especially if you love hops.  I recommend this highly, an excellent example of this style...enjoy!",Bear Republic Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,93
610,2751,rhoadsrage,4.15,(Served in an imperial fluted strange)  A-This beer has a deep golden copper body with the slightest hint of hazy and a creamy white marshmallow head that last and last. The carbonation is lots of tiny little bubbles.  S- The smell of citrus and orange hops has a faint pineapple and grass note. Underneath the juicy hops is a note of lightly sweet toasted malt that really rounds out the aroma.  T- This beer has a sweet creamy malt flavor with a hint of caramel that is quickly wiped of the palette by some big bold green hops. The hops have notes of pineapple with a faint grassy note and some floral hop notes. At the finish there is a faint cola note in the hops and then the hops hang onto every exhale not letting go of their grip.  M- This beer has a medium-full mouthfeel with a creamy texture that makes it feel even more full. No astringency or alcohol noticed.  D- This is a good solid IPA with juicy hops and a good malt backbone. Its hard to believe this is a 7% abv beer and it has a bit more sweetness than most IPAs. That changes the profile of the hops with is a nice twist.,Bear Republic Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,93

The aroma was hoppy with a slight bit of citrusy sweetness behind. This IPA starts out hoppy with well balanced malty notes behind. A fruity presence (citrusy yet pear like), appears mid bottle folowed by hop bitterness and a stronger hop bitterness at the end.. This beer goes down smooth and is carbonated nicely.

A lot of fizziness going on in there--looks great! Left an unbelievable amount of lace that looks like coral.  S: Hops hit the nose first with citrus and fruit aromas as well as those loveable pine smells. Defiantely a nice selling hoppy beer.  T: Sour fruit and sweet floral taste at first with a nice yeasty malt in there also. It tastes as though the malt and hops are circle dancing together in my mouth. The tastes keep switching back and forth. Finishing dry with a little bitterness, but not very much. Not as hoppy as I thought it was going to be from the smell, but definately very tasty.  M & D: Mouthfeel is good. Very smooth tasting offering from Bear Republic. Goes down smooth being a well balanced IPA. Very drinkable beer.

610,2751,nickss,4.65,"Pours a pale orangey yellow with what appears to be a tremendous amount of carbonation (lots and lots of bubbles). Super thick, rocky head... about 2"" worth.... lots of lacing.  Wonderful aroma... tones of piney hops...prickly citrus scent... barely noticeable malt background... a definite yeasty touch to it as well.  Delicious! Lots of piney hops, yet not as much an affront to the palate as I thought it was going to be.... very subdued, while at the same time maintaining an aggressive attitude. Yeast becomes more noticeable as I work my way through the first glass, and I can only assume it will continue in this manner towards the bottom of the bottle. Not extraordinarily complex, yet still wonderful.  Wonderful thick mouthfeel... the carbonation becomes apparent in every sip, yet not in the manner I would have thought: it creates a mouthfilling experience while not being explosive on the tongue... it saves the bite from the hops for that. Very nice.... reminds me of a DIPA... I dig it.  Thick, yet not oppressively so. Hoppy, yet not overwhelmingly so. High abv, but not dangerously so. What a beer... I am extremely impressed.",Bear Republic Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,93
610,2751,GolgiIPAratus,4.22,"Sampled: 2.12.06 - bomber  The clear copper orange brew sits beneath a healthy off white head. The foam would slowly recede from the circular edge leaving a round plateau island of froth, much like that of a milkshake. The results of this head are a sticky web of residue to rival any adhesive you could put against it. My glass was a lacey mess the entire way through the drink. Even though I TRIED to wash it off by rotating my glass, by swirlingit only made more.  The aroma was a punch of piney citrus. Wicked west coast IPA stylee. Theres baked sweet bread yeasty malt goodness behind the orange juiciness.  Theres bitterness up front with the piney citrus flavors carrying all out from the nose. There are some flowery textures in there and its more grapefruit like in the mouth than the orange in the aroma. Lightly malted backbone peeks through, but this guy is mostly all IPA hops. The bitterness is carried throughout the finish leaving an oily hop slick on the tongue. The beer is low carbonated and full.  Easy drinker. Goes down nice. Not too bitter, despite its huge hop profile. Great beer.",Bear Republic Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,93

The pine really dominates the taste. Very nice hop profile. Nice compliment of caramal malt.  Very nice carbonation level. Little big of an astringent aftertaste but in more of a nice hop bitterness way.  This one went down supper easy. Very drinkable. First i've sampled from bear republic. It has me looking forward to more. Another of the many fine IPA's. It's tough to pick a favorite because there are so many good ones.,Bear Republic Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,93
610,2751,fisherman34,3.92,"22oz bottle. Light orange in colour with lots of carbonation and a bit of haze. Very floral aroma with some mild background notes of orange and black pepper. Medium bitterness, with flavor notes of green hop cone, orange, grapefruit, light (yet fairly sweet) malt, and a touch of pine. A bit light bodied for the style and AVB, but would be a good IPA for warmer weather drinking. Solid.",Bear Republic Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,93
610,2751,wingnutter,4.39,"Poured a beautiful cloudy golden color, with a head that just kept climbling and climbing up the glass until I had to suck some of it back to avoid spillage. What the hell is in the water in No Cal?!?!?!?! Crazy retention. I think I could float a quarter on top of this head. Wow. Nice lacing, too.  Taste is nothing short of fantastic. Excellent hop profile with a malt backbone to match. What a nicely balanced beer! Uber hoppy with just enough malt to keep the hops from breaking out of the gates and becoming out of control. Floral, piney, citrusy....Hop heaven.  This may be the best IPA Ive had the pleasure of drinking. I wish I could get this stuff down here in Florida. I'd always have some on hand. Two thumbs WAY UP. A fantastic IPA from a great brewery.  Excellent drinkability - I could drink this one all the way from the starting gun to the finish line!! Gentleman, start your tastebuds and buckle up, cause Racer 5 takes you on one hell of a ride!!!  Giddyup!",Bear Republic Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,93
610,2751,soulgrowl,4.13,"Appearance: Body is soft yet bold, translucent Bengal-orange-garnet color. Big, fluffy, marshmallowy, ivory-colored head sparkles with lively bubbles. Excellent retention. Lacing looks like cirrus uncinus clouds at the top of the glass, and take on a more cirrocumulus-type form towards the bottom.  Smell: Mostly citric and floral hops, light honey taste, and an almost Belgian yeast character as the beer warms. A pleasant, refreshing aroma remniscent of iced tea.  Taste: Quite fruity, actually, with a white grape juice base and a fairly strong but not overwhelming pithy hop character that subsides mid-sip into a clean, fresh, grapefruity finish. Has a vague peanutty edge.  Mouthfeel: Smooth and frothy, nicely carbonated.  Drinkability: Quite easy to drink. Not too aggressive, and not puckeringly bitter. Good stuff!",Bear Republic Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,93
610,2751,bennetj17,4.05,"Head is fairly thin, and dissipates fast into a decent ring of foam. Carbonation looks pretty active. The color is a beautiful copper/orange, mostly clear. I smell primarily fresh hops, maybe a bit spicy or peppery, but mostly hop aroma. The flavor continues to be hoppy, with a hint of sweet/nutty malt. The finish is dry and only moderately bitter- less than I expected. The mouthfeel is a bit too thin for my liking, but carbonation is adequate. Alcohol is not very present. Despite its shortcomings the beer is still very drinkable. It's a good beer, but it could be great if there were more balance from the malt.",Bear Republic Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,93
610,2751,Ego,3.53,"found @ DeCicco Market, Pelham, NY  eyes.. big fluffy white head (no, not mine...the beer), sticky like those octopuses you got out of cereal boxes and chucked at the wall, the head is bumby like a crappy matress, orange with ample carbonation flowing from the bottom of the chalice, very good looking.  nose... hops, next question ? ok... citrusy but not pine or lemon, a bit more floral like sierra nevada pale with a kicker, almost hard to get past the hop blast but there is a nice musty bread tone buried in there as well, nothing yeasty or doughy just a whiff of a bakery in the morning, nothing insanely complex here but more like ""here I am bitch""  taste etc... prickly carbonation abounds, hops hops hops... this can be a touch bitter but that doesn't bother this pilgrim. mouthfeel is really good, medium and carries well over the palette, the ABV is not an issue in the flavor but it does creep up on you.  verdict? I have enjoyed other bear offerings to a greater extent, this isn't bad by any stretch but it certainly didn't knock my socks off... I wouldn't be averse to having it again but I won't go silly looking for it.",Bear Republic Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,93
610,2751,xoqx,4.52,"What an outstanding California beer! This seems to be a ubiquitous favorite around the bay area from what many at the phenomenal Toronado bar had to say. This pint was barely amber, almost orangey, and had a stable two finger, dense off-white head that had superb retention  surprising for a 7% brew. Maybe the water in California has different properties than Pacific Northwest waters when it comes to head retention. The smell is phenomenally hoppy. The taste is surprising and original. Its only 69 IBUs, but I would have guessed in the high 80s. They are using Cascade and Columbus hybrid hops. The later are usually employed early in brewing for bittering, but these in the Racer 5 are utilized more in a finishing role and other breweries could really take a hint from this. They are superb in that capacity. The mouthfeel is bold and sharp and the finish is long and wonderful. It should be noted that there is actually some discernable malt taste lurking behind all the hops and it has a subtle caramel malt body. This is a real drink-em-all-night IPA and one of the most enjoyable of the style Ive ever had.",Bear Republic Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,93
610,2751,Tupperwolf,3.98,"Pours a dark apple juice amber color into my nonic glass - very clear, with lots of tiny rising bubbles. So neat to just sit and watch bubbles appear out of nowhere and rise in rapid streams. Rocky eggshell white head isn't going anywhere with so many little bubbles feeding it! Super appealing looking IPA! Fat, heavy, complete lacing. So much damn lacing as I drink it down - a total wall of white! I had to come back and bump up the appearance to a 4.5 after getting near the bottom - the lacing totally does it for me. Super thick and sticky and enticing!  Big whiffs of grapefruit, orange peel, and pine in the nose - a nose-puckering sour hoppiness. Rather intriguing, a little different from other IPAs in scent, but in a roundabout way I can't describe.  The taste, on the other hand, isn't as aggressive and hard-hitting as the other Californian IPAs I've come to love; It lacks that kung-fu hop bite, and shows its hoppy nature in a sort of reluctant way. Don't get me wrong, it's tasty! Rather smooth for an IPA; Maybe I've been drinking too many Double IPAs? That must be it. The flavor is scored accordingly. The taste has a sweet, grapefruit-pine slickness that doesn't assault the taste buds, but croons them a gentle hop lullaby on top of so-tasty malt sweetnesses.  Mouthfeel is average, just a little above. For so much head and bubbliness, the carbonation is a little off, a little thin. What's left behind after swallowing is nice; A thin, reedy aftertaste. I'd hoped for a heartier IPA body.  I'm waffling a bit on the drinkability; It's good, for sure, but not outstanding. This is a tasty, quaffable beverage, so it's definitely worth a try! Good on Bear Republic!",Bear Republic Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,93
610,2751,jaluria,4.03,"An very good beer with loads of flavor and a hop profile that can delight the taste buds.  Appears a soft orange-red in color with an off-white colored head that is thick and intense and seems to just sit there for quite awhile. Nice lacing is left behind on my pint glass. Aromas of pine, oranges, carrots, and hops seem to come out nicely. The taste is quite hoppy with a bitterness that is present in every sip. A fair amount of malty sweetness is also present, adding texture and variety to each sip. I felt this beer was too carbonated and hence it was too slick and creamy in my mouth. The drinkability is high as the flavors are enticing and enjoyable.",Bear Republic Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,93
610,2751,smcolw,4.27,"Cloudy light amber color; nice eggshell head (one finger thick) leaving a ring of lace with each sip.  Nice fresh floral hop aromas. I note this smell each time I pick up the glass for a sip.  IPA's are inherently unbalanced brews. So I get excited when I get the hop wallop along with a strong round flavor of malt. This beer pulls that off. Excellent body with a slightly high carbonation. The aftertaste is bitter, but floral, hop that lasts a very long time.  This probably makes my top three IPA's ever tried (with Stone IPA and Sierra Nevada Celebration Ale). I would love to do a blind tasting of these three. I could drink this all day.",Bear Republic Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,93
610,2751,Goldorak,3.71,"Appearance: Peachy golden, with a faint but fluffy head. It sported a massive amount of chunks, pretty odd for this style. I don't think the bottle was very old, I got it only a few months ago.  Smell: Fresh hop aromas that burst of strawberries then the alcohol creeps in slowly to release notes of pine trees.  Taste: Relatively mellow carbonation, the malt tastes like cookies with a bit of cooked vegetables. The hops show up nice and easy, and slowly grow momentum, without ever going into excess. Almost no alcohol to be found in the taste, somewhat ashy finish, perhaps from the yeast shot. Not my favorite Bear Republic, but a nice sessionable IPA.",Bear Republic Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,93
610,2751,Prufrock,4.62,"22 oz. bottle poured into a pilsner glass.  bright golden orange with a touch of dust and a foamy inch of white head that leaves perfect lacing  smell is a great mix of hop aromas: candied grapefruit, peaches, citrus zest, pine and herbs.  pleasantly balanced in the taste. sweet, carbonated mouthfeel with a nice piney hop aftertaste. everything in the aroma comes through in the flavor, which is not overwhelmingly bitter but has a strong, complex hop component. nice juicy feel with a prominent grapefruit rind flavor. very drinkable.",Bear Republic Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,93
610,2751,tgbljb,4.12,"poured a medium golden color with massive white puffy, chunky head.Slowly settled to a thin coating that lasted throughout the glass. Amazing lacing on the side of the glass. Lovely glass of beer. Smell is strong on pine hops mixed with some citrus-like notes. Taste is initially very strong on hops with a nice btterness, bit some malt flavors begin to show through to give an excellent balance. Each taste brings the pleasant aroma, to be finished off with the great taste. Finish is more dry than malty,but the combination is fantastic. Very drinkable. I will have to visit this one again (and again).",Bear Republic Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,93
610,2751,russpowell,4.56,"Pours a light golden, with a massive white head that holds up all they way. Crazy lacing!!  Grapefruity hops smell and alcohol& malt whiff through.  Big piney hops taste balanced malt and dryness. Grapefruit & lemon hit the tongue & throat. Some slight toasty nuttiness in the malt  Smooth, well carbonated & in harmony  Big beer with enough seductiveness to lure you back in, great hops sandwich!! Wish I could find this at better price than $5 a 22oz bottle",Bear Republic Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,93
610,2751,Golden2wenty1,4.22,"Picked up a bomber at Steve's on University Ave here in Madison. At $3.49 for a bomber, Bear Republic is always an amazing deal.  Pours a murky amber with a finger of khaki head in my weizen glass. Nose is bitter herbal hops with some sweet caramel malt. Taste is pretty well hopped, a little on the bitter side, with some balancing caramel malts and a bit of brown alr nuttiness. Mouthfeel was a little on the thin side, but crisp. Overall a pretty drinkable IPA, not outstanding but worth the $3.49/bomber.",Bear Republic Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,93
610,2751,germaniac,4.55,"Pours a clear golden hue, shot thru with red highlights. If clear copper could be defined any better, I don't know the beer to do it. Massive billowing head that sticks to every glass surface it can find. Pure hops in the nose, oily and citrus-like. Hops are upclose and personal in the taste, but a perfect level of malt sweetness manages to rein in the bitterness. Mouthfeel could have benefitted from the brewers using water with a higher mineral content, I think. It might have complimented the hops just a little more, but that's a minor hit on an awesome West Coast IPA.",Bear Republic Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,93
610,2751,troutmask96,4.45,"Wow. This may be the Holy Grail of mainstream IPA's. Pours a deep amber with thick, very foamy head that lasts forever. Smell is of pine, citrus, caramel, and alcohol. Taste is forever smooth, with a nice, sweet finish and a nice bit of bitterness. A very drinkable IPA. Bear Republic's Hop Rod Rye has long been one of my favorites, but Racer 5 outpaces it...",Bear Republic Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,93
610,2751,EStreet20,4.18,"Had this once before. Finally picked one up for review.  22 ounce bomber bottle poured into a nonic pint glass.  A - After mishandling the bottle the beer foamed up like crazy on the pour. Nonetheless it has a nice look. A translucent golden yellow with a tiny orange tint. Nice sized head (too big from handling/pour) that def has a ton of staying power and laces the glass nicely. The lace actually looks like lattice on the side of the glass. Head cakes up a little in middle of glass.  S - A nice hop rush here. Mainly floral hops with a little bit of a malty sweetness lending some balance. Nopt quite as in your face as many IPAs I;ve enjoyed before, as I've been on a bit hop bomb kick lately.  T - A nice hoppy bitterness on the sip. A tiny bit of that sweetness again with a tiny spicy kick. Some alcohol warming is present.  M - With the smooth feel and warming this one is right on in the mouth.  D - Pretty good, not my favorite IPA but definitely one to enjoy, especially if you want an IPA with a little sweetness every now and then. This'll keep you coming back for more sips.",Bear Republic Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,93
610,2751,ghostwalker,4.61,"Bomber serving, been saving this one for a while. Glad that tonight is finally the night to break it out.  Beautiful pour! Golden/amber body with a slight haze to it. Huge frothy sticky white head that lasts and lasts. Curtains of lace, really impressive. To me, this is, in terms of appearance, a perfect IPA.  Nice hop nose, sharp and invigorating.  Taste is very nice indeed. Spicy and tasty hops are the flavor leaders, balanced with a proportional malt base. This is a very interesting IPA with a variety of fruity, piney and tart citrus flavors to consider. There is also a curious spiciness that kind of reminds me of SNCA. An instant classic in my book. I'm giving it top marks.  Mouthfeel is medium heavy with lots of great carbonation.  Drinkability is very high. Could be a great session beer. Just a little too costly and somewhat hard to find around here. I will grab this one again.",Bear Republic Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,93
610,2751,jonnylieberman,4.62,"Pours out of the ubiquitous bomber into the more ubiquituos pint glass. A monster head that sticks around forever and a golden/pale copper color all please the eyes. Not cloudy, but not bright either. Knowing what I know, i would say their are some volitile hop oils clouding up the joint.  Smells like: Oh man... I've been drinking nothing but German beers for a week (studying for BJCP) and holy shit is this refreshing. Why, I smell pine and citrus and yummy west coast flavors. This beer smells fantastic. West Coast IPAs rule.  Taste: Glorisu Cascade, I have forsaken you.Love it. Fantastic bitterness, no doubt from Centenial and maybe some Chinook. You know how the Bros say that ""all 5's should be rare?"" Well the taste of Racer 5 is a straight up 5. I cannot imagine a better tasting IPA. Just perfect.Good malt sweetness stands up well to the hop monster. Sharp and then sweet and then bitter. Wow.  Mouthfeel: A bit watrery due to soft water and American 2-row. Still, the swallow is superb.  Overall: I am kicking myself right now because I have been so into Hop Rod that I have ignored Racer 5 for years. Far too long at any rate. Wow. I'm going to be drinking MUCH Racer 5 in the months and years ahead.  Outstanding.",Bear Republic Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,93
610,2751,Naes,4.2,"This IPA has a nice golden brown color with a large white head that provides plenty of lacing. The aroma is of citrusy hops. The flavor is just as it smells. Hops and citrus. There is a grapefruit presence and a nice bitter finish. The malt is subtle, yet it does surface throughout the sip. Mouth feel is medium bodied and semi oily. This is good stuff, just wish it came in 12oz bottles instead.",Bear Republic Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,93
610,2751,Ieatlambfries,4.12,"Bottle courtesy of my friend Joe B.  Poured a rich gold color. Thick off white head of fine bubbles. Nice lacing that sticks around.  When I first smelled it I got the distinct scent of honey. This gave way to a citrus laden cascade hop aroma. Almost like sweet pink grapefruit.  The taste had a sweet malt undertone, but followed by a big grapefruit rind bitter punch. Piney hop resins with a hot alcohol finish on the exhale. Again, I could not shake the clover honey flavors as well.  Mouth feel is medium bodied. Some sharp carbonation.  Drinkability is good. At 7%. Pretty big for a regular IPA. This however would not stop me from finishing my bomber. An excellent IPA. Would love to be able to get this on a regular basis.",Bear Republic Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,93
610,2751,FLAbeergutinMASS,4.3,"This is ""just"" and IPA??!?!?! All indications lead towards a DIPA. Tons of yeast carbonation, cloudy body and circumference lacing. Pungent orange and citrus flavors, and a nice alcohol kick (DIPA again). Nice and hoppy, slight bitterness towards the end. Chamomile and spice accent its warming alcohol.  Not at all what I was expecting. On the east coast we hear so much about his hop bomb or that ""extreme"" beer. IMO, this is the one beer that qualifies as both. Great beer.",Bear Republic Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,93
610,2751,blitheringidiot,4.52,"Double deucer bottle fills a glass with a first pour as crystal clear amber hues, carbonationless, topped with a sticky khaki tightly packed head cap, leaving impressive lattice lace in the glass. The last pour was loaded with scrod chunckers floatin' around.  Initial scents of a bold floral bouquet. Huge scents of cotton candy sweetness, ambrosia marshmellow and jello aromas.  First swigs: Citrus orange pel and Pez candy tart. A sizzle of thick piney hops. Dry lingering finish with a dusty citrus sizzle. Robust floral nose compliments the bright hop characteristics. This is darn near a double IPA, really.  Feel is full bodied for an IPA. Thickness stems from the hop content loaded to the max.  Last swigs: This tastes fresh! No freshness date. What a cheap treat! $3.99 a 22 oz'er.  Beer is good. Happy big hops IPA beering.",Bear Republic Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,93
610,2751,kmpitz2,4.15,"Pours a clear, copper color with a finger and a half of head that sticks around fairly nicely. Nose is nice and hoppy, with good sweet citrusy and some sharper piney notes. It is balances by a modest caramel backbone. Flavor is dominated bot the hops initially. More sharpness in the pine flavor than sweetness from the citrusyness. The sweet caramel backbone comes through more after the swallow, followed by a moderate hoppy bitter that grabs and hangs on, drawing me back for more. Tasty beer. Feel is moderate to thick with a moderate carbonation. Nice and chewy. Just looked at the ABV. 7% is nowhere to be found. Burps are much stronger in the caramel than hoppyness. This bomber is going to find its way to empty very fast. Enjoyable.",Bear Republic Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,93
610,2751,1whiskey,4.8,"22 oz. bomber poured into a pint glass. Stunning honey-orange color that almost glows. Huge fluffy white head that leave chunks of clinging lace on the side of the glass. Now that's a pretty beer!  Marvelous nose. Very clean, sweet aroma. Extremely floral, perhaps rivaled only by NBB's Trippel. Would make a great perfume.  Big hoppy flavor hits your tongue right away. Almost immediatly afterwards, you notice a wonderful honey-sweet malt backdrop balancing everything out. Incredible. More floral esters are noticable as well. Some lingering bitterness remains on the palate, but this finishes pretty dry and clean. Alcohol is very well hidden.   Very soft and light mouthfeel. I would go so far as to call it poetic. This really is incredibly smooth for such a highly hopped brew. Ideal carbonation level.  I've been meaning to try this for a some time, and now I can't believe what I've been missing out on! This is perhaps more floral and less spicy than your traditional west coast IPA, but who cares? This is one outstanding beer.

610,2751,pjwilson,4.49,"appearance: i just a got a tulip glass (finally!) so i figgured i'd try out with some racer 5. Wrong glass for style but hey, this one special IPA. looks a dark orange to deep amber color... held to the light it lightens up quite a bit. I would have liked to see the head last longer but it lasts a few minutes. the lacing was pretty good on this one..  Smell: my that's good. you really get a great hop smell on this one. reminds me of pliny the elder. yet this is from a bottle. the hops smells very fresh and quick glance at the website shows that the aroma hops are columbus. mmmm columbus. yes i smell the grapefruit people talk about. also orange..not much trace of the malts...but they aren't missed.  taste: there are the malts. sweet malts that balance right with the hops. the aftertaste washes over you with a mild bitterness. yep this is a balanced beer. there is enough complexity here to keep things interesting. it really feels like the malt and hops are dancing on my tounge.... mouthfeel: just the right mix on this one... watery and chewy at once. i can't of anyway else to say it but yeah.... drinkability: for an ipa this is a sipper....not like say...celebration ale which is a beer that is gone after two sips. no, this an ipa to drink like a beligum and slowy enjoy. This beer is like a double ipa in character...it's just so well put together. It justifies being only in bombers. (actually in sonoma i saw it in 6 packs but that ruins my point :) i toyed with giving this all 5's since it probably the best ipa i've had...but i guess there is a hair of room for improvment.",Bear Republic Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,93

Orange peels, pine and yeast. Hoppy taste with a nice malt and yeast finish with is a welcome change from a lot of IPAs. A very balanced and drinkable beer.

610,2751,IrishRedRock,4.15,"I've sampled the Racer X on cask, so I expected this to be a smaller, less hoppy version - and it is - though I expected a bit more hops overall. Pours a golden amber from the bomber, very sweet floral citrusy aroma, hops are noticeable but not overpowering. Flavor is initially sweet, with vanilla and pineapple flowing. Hoppiness is present throughout, though not with a lot of bitterness and actually a butterscotch, malty caramel presence seems to take over in the finish. Very thick and coating and a bit heavy for an IPA. Carbonation is light and reminiscent of a hand-pulled cask pour. The big malt profile balances this quite nicely. As a hophead I still prefer the more hoppy, bitter X. However, as a west coast IPA, this is quite tame in terms of hops, and could be a great crossover IPA.",Bear Republic Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,93

610,2751,TongoRad,4.17,"A decanted pour from a 22 oz. bomber reveals a slightly hazy apricot colored beer with a tall 3-finger long lasting head.  Aroma is wonderfully layered but still solidly in IPA territory. Hops and caramel dominate, but their interaction produces intriguing undercurrents. What starts as pine resin and citrus (grapefruit/tangerine) gives way to peaches and cream, some honeydew, strawberries and a hint of mild spices. Alcohol shows its head after a bit of swirling.  The palate is agressively bitter but ultimately well balanced by a generous helping of caramel and residual malt. Citrus peel makes another strong impression, but some of the fruit comes through as well. The finish is long and lingers on the resiny hop qualities and maybe a hint of spice. Alcohol has a presence, albeit unobtrusive, throughout.  This is a beer to be enjoyed as well as respected.

A peachy sweetness creeps in as well.  The taste and mouthfeel are great on this one. I get orange pith with peach nectar and a creamy bready-ness with a slight alcohol fizzle at the end. Aftertaste of grapefruit. The hops are profound, but not overbearing or too bright. A nice balance of bitterness and malty sweetness.  The drinkability is a no-brainer. Smooth and spicy at once, I could go for a couple of these 22-ouncers in an evening. Perhaps this is because I've been all about Double IPAs lately and a regular old IPA would just seem like water. I don't think so, though, because this one is quite bold -- indeed, plenty strong -- but still very easy to quaff.

Fresh citrus smells and an assload of hops w/light malts. The taste bitchsmacks you with hops right away but I also enjoyed the slight matly sweetness all in the same taste. There is definately piney goodness and a hint of caremel in all that sweetness. I know it is only 7.0 abv but this warms my throat right away for some reason. So Smooth. The mouthfeel is awesome and creamy, I could drink a million of these. Sorta syrupy though. Really dissapointed this isn't served on tap at my local MacGregors anymore.  By the way the head ROCKS!

Mostly tropical and sweet in the nose - pineapples, grapefruit, oranges, a strong sweetness, and a bit of nostril-burning alcohol in the back. The flavor is about the same with a hefty sweetness and grapefruit, pineapple, leafy/oily hops, and some nutty/biscuity malts.

Big hoppy smell that is countered by a creamy smooth mouthfeel. Amazingly it finishes ""fairly clean"" for such an overhopped beer. This is pre-night cap material. Like the setup man in the bullpen this is an eighth inning Tom Gordon style or for the west coast folks this is a Brendan Donnely. I found this beer to get a bit harsh on the throat as it warmed up...whatever thats getting pretty petty in my book..The only downfall I would say is its almost a double in taste...if your gonna be an IPA be an IPA....fundamentally sound.",Bear Republic Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,93
610,2751,garymuchow,4.24,This bottle via guezedude. Many thanks.  Aroma shows nice grassy hops with a pleasant malt sweetness. Fairly simple but really pleasing. Unfortunately poured with an excessive head that settled slowly. A very golden amber and clear. Nice lacing with receding head. More matl than I expected and it dominated at first (it seems sweet with a slight toastiness). Bitterness follows and gradually builds in intensity through the finish. Balance is nice. Amazingly flat feel with is fine with me. Appropriate moderate heaviness. Great softness. I like the mix of flavors and the balance of them.

Grapefruit hop bitterness mixed with quite a lot of fruityness gives me my needed hop fix. A bready malt character evens things out a bit and makes it very drinkable.

610,2751,Knuckles,3.89,"So I finally crack open a bottle of Racer 5. I had made a trip to Bottleworks a few weeks back to pick up a training kit for my chiropractor (she really wanted to work over the Corona hump she was stuck on, so I offered to help her out). Since she was an amateur for all intents and purposes, I set my sights to the pale end of the spectrum, with two criteria:  1) I had to have tried them, and  2)They had to be available in at least some supermarkets of Western Washington.  So I ended up with a two pronged approach. Side one of the pick a six was Naughty Nellie's (Pike), Wild Salmon Pale Ale (Fish) and Wildcat IPA (Snoqualmie). Side two was Locomotive Ale (Iron Horse), Nightwatch (Maritime Pacific) and Red Seal (North Coast). The point of all this blather is that I wish I had tried Racer 5 before, as I would have substituted out the Wild Salmon (which I don't personally care for, and neither did she) and inserted one of these. This is a perfect bridge beer for those people trying to move from lighter ales (like blondes and goldens) and lagers into the slightly hoppier realms of pales, reds and IPAs.  Appearance: Simply wonderful, and almost the best part of the beer. The color is that color that for no reason at all makes me start singing the ""Beverly Hillbillies"" theme song (""BLACK gold! TEXAS tea!""), and a gorgeous, fluffy and stubborn white head sitting atop that beer simply refuses to leave no matter how many drinks I take. Good work.  Smell: Sadly, I smell almost nothing. Warm, cold, it's all the same. I smell no malts at all and smell what I think might be hops, but wouldn't bet my sons on it.  Taste: First taste (admittedly cold), put me off. All finishing hops and very little in the front and middle. Way too hot (if I may steal the word from my man BeerPanther. Great adjective, brother. I love it.) on the first kiss. So I let it sit for five minutes or so (it's 90 fucking degrees today, so the time is compressed for de-chillification), and come back for a second try. Ahh...much better. There are the malts I'm looking for. Now I get just a mild malt presence right at the front, the hops are MUCH more subdued, and then the malts and hops slowly dance around each other on my tongue as the finish slowly drifts away. Beautiful.  Mouthfeel: Here, I'm a little confused. I've had an awful lot of Imperial IPAs lately, so my viscosometer might be busted. It feels a little thin to me, but I don't know if I'm really reading this beer correctly. I want to give it a 3.75, but since that doesn't exist I'm going to grade up, because that seems like the right thing to do.  Drinkability: Very, very good. I like this beer a lot, I just wish it had a nose to match its taste. I do wish I had another.",Bear Republic Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,93

It's supposed to last for a long time~~I reckon?

Low carbonation detected. Smell: extremely heavily hopped--profou...ndly perfumy and floral hops exploding right under my nose, along with aggressively fruity (sweet buttery lemon-cake, ripe peach+plum+apples) aroma...it's powerful yet not overpowering, as the deeply-sweet and grainy flavour of malts sustains well following the hop parade. Taste: oily-hoppy and richly candyish-malty mouthfeel from the very beginning... a bittersweet nutty plus some grapefruit-zesty taste prevails right afterwards, underlined by a rounded, orange-peel oily flavour sitting firmly at the background, leaving a warmish mouthfeel of fruity hops and lingering but not overly strong bitterness. It's so satisfying and settled that almost no particular alcoholic touch is left behind. The balance b/w malts and hops is good, though for me the mouthfeel is a bit overly sweet.

610,2751,mentor,4.23,"Bottle obtained from Total Beverage (Colorado) and consumed a couple evenings later in July 2005. Pours a one-finger wicked silky creamy fine clingy head. Light tan that stands over a slightly cloudy light apricot liquid. Smells potently and smooth clean grapefruit pith with some hoppy orange and tangerine. Tastes sweet honey-like malt with moderate hop bitter and strong hop flavoring. The hop flavors are distinct and clean, but supported by underlying malt sweetness. Fruity esters are mild beneath the hops, but are honey-like, with apricot and tangerine. Smooth and creamy mouthfeel. Medium body with moderate carbonation. This is a really enjoyable IPA.

Waiting in fridge for a special day. Pours a slightly hazed golden orange, almost white frothy head that persists and laces the Corsendonk tulip glass.  Citrusy hop aroma suggesting a blend of pineapple and grapefruit. Little alcohol hides in toasted malt underneath the overwhelming hops. An unidentified weak clove like spice emerges at finish but is overwelmed by the pungent bitterness that lingers on and on. The yeast from the final pour from the 22 oz bomber softens this as the 7% ABV takes hold.

610,2751,Boilermaker88,3.78,"Served on-tap at T. Phillips Alehouse, part of their recent addition of Bear Republic brews to their tap list. Served in a standard pint glass. Racer 5 had a clear coppery color, lots of finely wrought carbonation, and a dense off-white head that grudgingly shrank and left thick sheets of lace clinging to the glass. Very attractive. The nose raised my eyebrows - is this really an IPA, the same one I had out of a bottle 18 months ago? Has it been that long? Racer 5's nose struck me as having more in common with some APA's than what I've come to expect from a West Coast IPA. Yes, there was a definite hops presence, nicely smelling of citrus peels and, to a lesser degree, pine needles. But the malty sweetness seemed a lot more solid and held its own. Hmm, a few pulls had me continuing to question what was up with Racer 5. It didn't strike me as having the robust hoppiness I've tasted before. The malt profile was more pronounced and in keeping with an APA. The maltiness and sweet caramel flavor carried through to the finish and remained intact up against the citrusy hops bite, which seemed oddly lacking. Even the feel seemed to be missing something, being light dry and not as lively as the level of carbonation would lead me to believe. Overall, Racer 5 is still a pretty nice IPA; easily quaffable and well constructed. To me, it seemed like the hoppy edge had been worn down to create a more balanced brew. I still recommend it, though.",Bear Republic Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,93

This here IPA could easily stand toe to toe with any IPA out there and probably a good number of double IPAs.

Pours with amazing clarity, a light bronze color, and a large creamy head that fades after sitting for a minute to a creamy layer. Smell is bursting with citrus hops, lemon zest, and floral hops, an explosive array of hops. Taste starts out with hops, transitions into floral hops, and closes with more hops and some doughiness. Starts smooth, then eviscerates your hops craving. Excellent beer. Mouthfeel is perfect for the style, well carbonated and smooth.

Piney, fruity, and slightly earthy hops dominate the smell. Great tasting, even better than the aroma. It leaves a slightly bitter finish, but that's expected with all the hops that are used.

Excellent balance with plenty of bitterness balanced by bready, biscuity malts. Hop flavour is strong pine, citrus, and spice, without being over the top. Sweetness backs off towards the end, which lets the resinous bitterness come forward, along with more orange hop flavour, and a bit of alcohol warming appear. Finishes off-dry.

A good bit of sweet malt as well. This IPA tastes really good. Its flavor covers the three basic hop flavors: citrus with hints of grapefruit, pine, and a finish of bitter resin. This is all balanced with a slightly sweet malt which makes this brew really balanced. Hop bitterness is good as well and stronger than most IPAs. Nicely crafted and true to the style although a touch more bitter than most.  Mouthfeel is a touch thin but still coats well enough to provide lingering time for tasting. If this was a bit heavier this would be right on par with what I woudl expect. Drikability is really what this beer is about and some of that could be due to the lighter mouthfeel in my opinion.

610,2751,axisjones,4.42,"Pours an amberish orange with a touch of cloudiness. A nice fluffy head sits on top with a decent lacing on the way down.  The smell is quite wonderful. Typical of a west coast IPA, you have the strong cascade aroma, pine, grapefruit, citrus, floral, with just a dash of passionfruit.  Once again, this is definitely in the West Coast IPA family. I have always found this group to have more juiciness and citric flavors and this is no exception. While it is in the company of great west coast IPAs, it is unique. A crisp bitterness carries a bit of spice which is balanced by a biscuity malt all the way through. While still on the hopped the hell out end of the spectrum, it is well balanced and the finish is lingering.  Highly drinkable. Had a bomber on a hot day and it went down like candy.

610,2751,AlexJ,4.4,"Thanks Mickey for this trade.  This Racer pours out a perfectly clear honey amber color, producing a fluffy 2 finger head of light beige that has a rocky top and leaves swirling rings of lace in my pint glass. Halfway through the beer there is still about 1/8 inch of head, nice.  As I inhale deeply, aromas of medium caramel malts and pine drenched citrus peel rise to greet me. A gentle swirl releases more of the bouquet, crushed pine needles gobbed on to fresh baked honey-wheat bread. The aroma is very nice on this one, but you really have to stick your nose in the glass to get it.  A sip reveals a very hoppy IPA highlighting pine needles and fruity citrus marmalaid hops with just enough caramel malt sweetness to carry it through to the long and tongue searingly hoppy finish.

A near perfect beer. Appears a cloudy yellow amber color with a dense head that lasts until the very end, leaving nice rings of white lacing on the glass. Smells quite hoppy, a mix of grapefruity pine and citrus. The taste is actually perfectly balanced, a must for a truly great IPA, though the hops come get you first. As the smell suggested, piney and citrusy, which sounds pretty typical and we've all seen those words in just about every review of an IPA, but there's a bit more to this one. Nice lemmon and orange peel zest, and a bit of dry dustiness. The deliverance of this beer is key as well; perfectly smooth mouthfeel, nice and dry yet thirst-quenchingly refreshing.

The aroma is filled with citrusy hops and screams huge hop additions. The taste is packed with a great hop start but smoothes out over the tongue wonderfully with a perfect balance of bitterness. The semi-high ABV in this is well hidden but makes a presence letting you know that it is there very sublte in the finish. The smoothness of this beer is incredible for having so much hop flavor. The intense hops in an IPA that are normally too much for malt-lovers, is so well balanced, that this is a perfect beer for those who want to explore the world of the hop-heads. I personally can not get enough hops, and this one (not being a IIPA) is just phenomenal.

Unlike some beers where the malt strike first and then the hops hit, this one seems to start with immense lemon and orange hop resin flavor and then moves into a sweet orangey marmalade malt flavor, finishing with a dry bitter peel and then dropping off. rich and well integrated, with that nice resinous coating feeling in the mouth.  feels like it could be a bit more carbonated, and the finish drops away a bit too fast to be perfectly brilliant.

A shadowy checkered flag backs the red and yellow letters spelling out Racer 5. Label describes this as an ...aggressive styled India Pale Ale. Also specifically marked as bottle-conditioned. No date, but this was from a new shipment. 7% ABV.  Cost: $3.49 at Finger Lakes Beverage  Presentation: Shaker pint glass at ~45º (as recommended on label).  Appearance: As noted by so many others, this is a lovely IPA, with a burnished amber body a bit darker than most IPAs and a voluminous (2-3 finger), dry, barely off-white head which reached a self-sustaining ¾ layer. Very interesting body, which seemed to fall somewhere between Hop Wallop and Two-Hearted Ale. It exhibited fine brown flecks in a colloidal suspension much like Hop Wallop (though the particles were much finer) and a light, luminous haze that was a touch less conspicuous than Two-Hearted.  Smell: Freshly hoppy with a pillow of rich malt, promising nice flavor balance. Still, a touch sharper from the bottle than from draught. I find that most IPAs fall into two categories: the harsh, medicinal ones, and the floral, fruity ones. Thankfully, this is one of the latter. BRs website tells me that this is hopped with Columbus and Cascade. Well, whatever it is, the hops palette plays beautifully off the malts.  Taste: The first thought that comes to mind is of balance. The bright hops are followed as closely by the sweet malts as Racer X followed Speed (or Schumacher followed Alonso last weekend at Imola). One of the rare beers that lives up to its hype. The finish is medium-to-long with a caramel sweetness that softens the aggressive hops. There was the slightest touch of medicinal sourness that Ive only noticed in bottles and not the draught.  Mouthfeel: Almost approaches a double IPA in its sensation of heft and viscosity (a characteristic I like), which prevents the hops from becoming too brittle. The very fine carbonation is excellent, providing an almost draught-like consistency.  Drinkability: Comes close to defining drinkability, despite its relatively high ABV. Joins draught Masala Mama and Celebration, Brutal Bitter (at least the earliest versions Ive had), and Two Hearted (again the better earlier version) at the top of the IPA pyramid for me.  Backwash: After the disappointing Bear Republic XP, it was nice to confirm my draught experience of Racer 5 with a very good bottle sample. I understand that this has reached the East Coast for the most part (except New Jersey). All of my purchases were either from The Chapter House (draught) or Finger Lakes Beverage (bottles) in Ithaca.  NB: The bottles all exhibited a slight medicinal hint, not present on draught. Score the draught ~0.25 higher overall.",Bear Republic Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,93
610,2751,beveragecaptain,4.08,"22 ounce bomber. This beer has a light copper color with a big, creamy white head. Be carefull not to pour this beer too hard, or the head will get out of control. Aromatic hop aroma, with just a bit of malt. The flavor is huge, caramel sweet at first with a load of hops. You could call this a double ipa. A little spicy in the finish. Medium to full mouthfeel. There is a nice alcoholic bite. Good west coast ipa.",Bear Republic Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,93
610,2751,warriorsoul,4.4,"I have had this one on numerous occasions...most memorable on tap at the Publick House...this one is a bomber thanks to Downtown. Pours a golden color with a full finger of off-white head....lacing is thin, but very clingy. The smell is very enjoyable...fruity hops (oranges, grapefruit, and zesty lemons). Taste is one of my favorites for an IPA...sweetness is just enough to offer delightful flavors of carmelized malts and piney hops. The carbonation is perfect...just enough to overcome any sweetness this brew has to offer. The mouthfeel is not thin or too syrupy...a very clean aftertaste allowing me to cruise through this bomber. Oh yeah, this is one hell of a session brew!",Bear Republic Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,93
610,2751,paulyrimz,3.98,"Appearance: Light golden-amber body color with thick layer of foamy head. Consistant lacing that was prevalent down to the last sip. Had this on draft at Hollingshead.  Aroma: Pleasant citrusy hop aroma. Hint of grapefruit among citrusy hops. Nice malt aromas, balance out this IPA nicely.  Taste: Citrus Hoppiness throughout, what I have to come think of as the default of IPA taste. Nothing surprising, but nonetheless delicious and consistant.  Mouthfeel: Good hop and malt balance. Medium light carbonation, could have used a bit more. Maybe it's just personal, but I think it could have used a more robust mouthfeel.  Drinkability: Very drinkable, smooth, goes down easy.  Notes: Solid, well balanced IPA, comparable to Craftsmen's IPA, which has a slightly better balance and mouthfeel.",Bear Republic Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,93
610,2751,canucklehead,4.35,This beer is one of those big IPA's that has balance and class by the truckload. Like Smuttynose or Stone this is the Ivy league of the style; in your face with a pedigree. I had 3 of Bear Republic beers in a tasting with Malto and all of them were highly impressive. Complex and powerful with a sense that the brewer has the chops.,Bear Republic Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,93
610,2751,RedwoodGeorge,4.22,"Brew pours a dark golden color with a sticky off-white head. Unfortunately the head falls down pretty quickly and leaves hardly any lacing along the sides of the glass.  The smell is full of hop aromas - pine and grapefruit being the primary notes but there are touches of floral and herbal in there as well. There's a distinct (and pleasant) fresh bread note in there to keep this from being an 'all hops' experience...  Taste perfectly follows scent - this is one of those brews where you know what you're getting before it touches your tongue. A respectable malt taste to keep things honest but the preponderance is pretty much hops, hops and hops. It's a good mix of grassy and citrus notes and will please any West Coast hop lover. (Or, for that matter, any East Coast imbiber who loves West Coast hops ;-)  The mouthfeel was a bit oily - the bubbles were on the large side and while it left a nice hoppy finish, the tongue felt coated. I'd have preferred a slightly lighter body to this one but it's not a deal breaker.  Overall a very nice representative of a West Coast IPA.",Bear Republic Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,93
610,2751,shalowlou,4.62,"Appearance: This brew is simply beautiful. A great appearance really can make a beer so much more appetizing.  Smell: I just love the smell, it's like being in a citrus garden. The hops: zest, grapefruit. The maltiness: orange and dare I say lemon? Delicious and appetizing.  Taste: Its like Ruination but not on steroids. I don't really enjoy the double IPA style (aka Ruination) This has the perfect balance, I'm not scared of hops, and I can appreciate them, and this brew really helps. It's hoppy, yet balanced, and the flavors just strike the palate. Orange, lemon, grapefruit, and the hops are oh so yummy. This is really a must try for those that really want to taste what balanced is all about.  Mouthfeel: Its really the prefect balance of thickness and brew. Its not too thick. But it really is filling.  Drinkability: Hey, I got the 22 oz. Bomber, and I like it, but its going to be a while before its gone. I'm having this with a nice fried lunch including tempura and vegetarian buffalo chicken wings. Let me tell you that this is heaven on earth. Like I mentioned before, it really does taste like Ruination but much more balanced in my opinion, the drinkability is heightened therefore in that balance.  Conclusion: Very very tasty, have it with a fried lunch like a fish and chips or a plate of calamari. Issss so good!",Bear Republic Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,93

Sharp hot spiciness, but a floral variety that isn't overly oily and like you are chewing on a pine branch.  Flavor follows through and is very enjoyable. It's all about the hops (what a surprise) and so this one doesn't go much further than that, but who cares?  One of the better IPAs that I've enjoyed...",Bear Republic Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,93

Aroma is citrusy mixed with some pine big on west coast hops the way we like them grapefruit and orange peel with a couple of pine cones thrown in for good measure. Taste is good sweet malty to start then some tart grapefruit peel takes over adding citrus rind flavors that mix with the yeast to add a earthy like flavor in my glass to make a nice tasting IPA that finishes with a bitterness milder then the smell.

The aroma is all sharp grapefruit rind, big and bad and swaggering.  A quintessential west-coast IPA, the taste is predominantly cirtus hops, with a respectable but not extreme bitterness. I can feel a hint of caramel sweetness after a grapefruit-hop burp, but the malt feels mostly crisp, and maybe slightly grassy. Not exactly balanced, but not overwhelming. Excellent hop flavor without heavy bitterness.  The mouthfeel is light, crisp, and clean, especially for a 7.0% brew. This makes for dangerously easy drinking.",Bear Republic Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,93

Lots and lots of hops in the nose, with lots and lots of lacing left behind to remind me of just how flavorful and thick this beer is. Not something for those who don't appreciate the beauty and power of the hop, and thus something made specially for me.  My only complaint about this beer is that I've not tried it before. From now on, when this is on the menu and there's nothing new that jumps out at me, I won't have to spend 5 minutes deciding what I want to try.",Bear Republic Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,93

A medium mouthfeel, not quite as full as I would expect for a 7% beer. The hops kick right away. A nice british maltiness is in back, but this is all about the lush hop flavor and bittering. Alcohol is present and provides a warming feel. The hops really build. It feels chewy after about half a glass. Break out the lawn mower, there is grass on my tongue! This not just a cascade-laden IPA.  I wasn't overly impressed on the nose or first few sips, but this beer really grew on me as the hops build and entice for another taste.

Smells rich in hops with a sweet malt background. The taste is unique with hops that has some tea background notes and sweet malt that is crisp with carbonation. The aftertaste does not linger in fact disappears however the hop notes still linger from the mouth. The mouthfeel is not too syrupy with an even mix of carbonation that is more evident with the aftertaste. The drinkability is excellent and maybe a session beer until the seven percent is too much before the not too syrupy taste.",Bear Republic Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,93

Pours a hazy copper gold under a 2.5 finger white head, thick and long-lived. The lacing in the first glass was a bit thin, but ample upon second pour. Lots of citrus and pine greet the nose - yum! The mouth is very prickly and medium-bodied. The taste presents a race, with distinct sweet citrus and malt contending wiht the pine and espresso bitter. Nicely balanced, this one is smooth and subdued, at least compared to some other IPAs. The finish is mild, almost fruity, but the race isn't over yet. The true dry espresso-grinds experience comes through in the aftertaste, leaving a delicious bitterness (and the one enjoying it) as the ultimate winner.

Lacing was exceptional (80%) all the way down to the last drop.  Aroma: Hoppy / sweet nose with a delightful citrus undertone. The high quality malt also makes an appearance.  Taste: Very bright foretaste with a refreshing role played by the CO². Light on the palate for an IPA with a very good West Coast style finish.

Drinkability: A pleasure to consume from start to finish...definitely recommended.,Bear Republic Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,93
610,2751,longarm,4.1,"Appearance is a clear and orange. Good carbonation. The bottle conditioning (22 oz.) makes it somewhat difficult to achieve clarity at the end of the pour, but this is not a big deal.  Aroma balances citrus hops with a foundation of caramel malt. Has a typical NW-U.S. hops character to it.  Flavor is mildly bitter, but like the aroma, hops is balanced with a solid dose of caramel malt. A slightly astrignent aftertaste and bite in the finish diminishes the overall quality. Hop flavor weighted more towards pine than citrus.  Lots of body and lingering sweetness make it a little heavy, but also not bad for the style.  Drinkability. This is basically a hophead's delight, but it's also on the moderately flavored for an American IPA.

I visited the brewery the next year and this year I brought a bottle back from San Diego to share with two friends in Florida.  As I remembered, this is a good IPA. It's a real West Coast styled IPA: nice and hoppy. My friend and homebrew partner Alec said he tasted blueberry in this brew! I can't say I tasted the same but there are complex flavors in this brew.  Bear Republic is a great little brewery and brewpub.

It's not about the IBUs with this beer, it's about the flavor, and Racer 5 drinks as though the brewers thought long and hard about which hops would match with this concentration of malt. Floral, green, and spicy at first, the beer develops into a honeyed, even somewhat grapey brew that fumes with herbal hop oil.  The bittering is almost unbearably ripening and unlike anything I've ever had. Instead of striking the back of my tongue, the beer floats right on by and the bittering doesn't kick in until this jet fuel hits the back of my throat.

Different from other stuff I have been drinking lately. Exceptional.  Taste: Definitely strong hop profile. I am finding it a bit hard to discern some of the other flavors.

In conclusion, I don't quite have the expertise to say why this beer was particularly good, but stands out a bit from some of the other IPA's I have had.

The first half was a typical light copper, clear with small head that left no lacing. The second (containing all the yeast in the bottle) was quite opaque, with extensive lacing all the way down.  Nose was about the same for both halves with hops predominating (as expected for an IPA) with a strong undertone of fruit, possibly plums.  Taste was remarkable different from the first half of the bottle to the second. In the first half, the overall impression was sharp, with the hops dominating, but also a strong tartness that I just didn't care for in an IPA.

Dense off-white head rose up huge and took a long time to settle down, becoming fluffy as it did so. The density and staying power of the foam was amazing. Tons of sticky lace was left on the glass. Flawless appearance.  Smell: Raw, juicy, citrus hops dominated right after the pour. A little bit of sweet malt peeked through at times, but the hops totally dominated. Smelled great.  Mouthfeel: Medium-bodied and smooth upfront, with a little carbonation bite in the back of the mouth. A slight numbing from the alcohol as well.  Taste: A good dose of citrus hops started things off. Then the hops transformed into a more herbal flavor, and that's when the bitterness really kicked in. There was quite a bit of malt sweetness present to help balance the hops, but the two opposing flavors didn't seem to blend well. Some light alcohol made itself known at times.

Pours out to a slightly hazy golden light amber with honey accents, forming a dense, thick and creamy yellow head with excellent retention and awesome lacing. Wonderful looking brew. Particulate yeast flitters about when added towards the bottom of the brew. Medium-light carbonation. Aroma is rich and not overly pungent with resinous, sappy and sweetly citric and floral hops. Nice pale and crystal malt backbone adds a touch of honey, vanilla, and orange in the mix. Mouthfeel is soft with a medium-dense body and clean finish. Taste begins with a nice assembly of the aforementioned hops, with residual malt and lots of white raisin sweetness followed by an interesting honey note throughout the middle. Crystal and/or Munich malt is predominate and adds a touch of grainy huskiness. BItterness is mild for the style. Slight astringency towards the finish with a lingering alfafa honey note in the aftertaste. Malt husk is detectable minutes after the last swallow. Alcohol and off-flavors are absent in aroma or taste. Drinkability is top-notch, particularly for the style.  Quite a nice IPA. The huskiness is a little much at times and the honey taste is quite strong. If you're not afraid of these things in an IPA, you've love it. A sweeter version of the style with a ton of hops, but very little pungency and resinous acidity. These guys are underrated in my opinion, and brew some world class brews. Alas, this is an wonderful brew, but not quite world class like their Big Bear Stout.",Bear Republic Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,93
610,2751,daledeee,4.1,A nice big bottle of my favorite kind of beer. Pours a nice medium orange yellow with a nice head. The nose is troubling but I will let it pass. What smells strong to me is good to others. The taste covers my goals here. Nice hoppy and malt character with excellent mouthfeel. The alchohol is a little strong for 7%. Another fine IPA,Bear Republic Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,93
610,2751,faernt,4.57,"What a nose! I try to do things in sequence but, this beer has an aroma that I expect only on tap, I'm in a bottle here and glad that Bear Republic has made it to Chicago. It's golden and today is big IPA day here at the ranch so Racer 5 howdedoo! What a beautful golden color.  This beer tastes wonderful. I enjoy Goose Island IPA on tap at the Clyborne pub and this is right up there with it except a bit stronger. A medium body mouthfeel and a high drinkability. Huge hops is such a hot weather thing.",Bear Republic Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,93
610,2751,meathookjones,4.17,"22oz Bomber. Pours a golden orange color with pretty good clarity and a good-sized frothy white head that laces a bit. The aroma is strong pleasant one made of a citrus hops and lesser malty sweetness. There were notes of fruit as well as it warmed. The taste is mainly hoppy bitterness with a citrus flavor to it and a slight sweetness. Even though I didnt taste much at all in the malt department this was a well-balanced beer. The aftertaste is a pleasant bitterness that lingers for a bit. No alcohol was detected anywhere in this brew but the effect were warming by the end of the bottle. It has medium body with good carbonation. I found this to be very drinkable, a good hop fix and went great with some spicy steak fajitas.",Bear Republic Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,93
610,2751,vladtheimpaler,4.24,"22 oz Bomber. Pours a clear golden color with a white head. Light clean fresh hop aroma, nothing assertive. Flavor is big in both hop flavor and bitterness, yet lets the malt sweetness shine through. The malt seems to coat the mouth nicely. Hops linger to the end. I am liking this....",Bear Republic Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,93
610,2751,CRJMellor,4,Pours a hazy gold and orange with a voluminous slightly off-white head that deposits chunks of lace to the pint. Aroma has a citrus hop aroma as the dominat feature with tinges of pale malt and some bicuit/bread like features coming through. Flavor is dominated by floral hops but their is just enough sweet malt and some biscuity freshness to cut it a bit and produce a somewhat balanced beer. Mouthfeel is bitter throughout but again cut with just enough sweetness to not be totally lip puckering. Nice beer. Drinkability is very good with the 22 oz. flowing smoothly.,Bear Republic Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,93
610,2751,rkhaze,4.8,"Pours a slightly hazy golden peach color. Big dense and creamy off white head. Good retention and it left rings of sticky lace. Smells of citrusy/perfumey hops. Earthy sweet malt, fruit (pears?) and tea. Excellent balance of flavors. The sweet malt, caramel and fruit backbone is balanced by a beautiful hop profile. Outstanding! Medium bodied with a creamy rich mouthfeel and an outstanding level of carbonation. Great balance and mouthfeel lead to unparalleled drinkability. One of my favorite IPA's. Just a great effort by Bear Republic.",Bear Republic Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,93
610,2751,joecast,4.22,"hazy, bright, orange/gold in color with minimal head. having only a 12oz. glass i had to pour the beer out a couple of times. while pouring the last bit out of the bottle (which was a bit warmer) a stable 1 finger head was able to form.  with a bit of a swirl of the glass, the aromas come through. similair to cascade (which is the only hop i can pick atm), but spicier. strong presence of pepper, and some apple.  first few sips give a fresh cut hop bitterness right at the start making the ""well hopped"" on the label a real understatement. as the temp comes up a bit, the contribution to flavor from the hops really shows well. any input from the malt must have been overshadowed by the hops, or they at least had me distracted. not so much in a bad way, as this is unashamedly a beer for hopheads. but at the same time it never seemed too overpowering or unbalanced.  a bit low in drinkablity only in that it would take a bit of work for me to get through more than one or two if my arm was twisted.  as my sister said ""not as bad as stone old guardian"". i thought the opposite.",Bear Republic Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,93
610,2751,WesWes,4,"The beer pours a dark golden color with a thick frothy white head that slowly fades. The aroma is good. It has a very intense, but pleasant citrous hop scent that is enhanced with a nice pale malt aroma. The taste is good. It has a complex pale malt core with a wonderful bitter hop flavor. It refreshes and goes down easy. The mouthfeel is fine. It is a medium bodied beer with good carbonation. This is a good IPA. It has a malty character and good hop additions; very well balanced.",Bear Republic Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,93
610,2751,silenius,4.36,"This is one helluva nice beer. We just started getting this in Chicago as far as I know. I picked this up today at thelonegunman's shop.  I'm always up to trying out an American IPA and I'm glad I popped the top on this one.  The beer pours a really solid deep golden with yeasty bits afloat. The head is like a bubble bath with great big bubbles floating two fingers thick. As I drink the beer I get great big spiderweb lacing down the glass.  The smell is a bit more on the sweet side than other West coast IPAs I've had. Many W coast IPAs are just like grapefruit juice to me. This is more floral and sweet.  Taste is very balanced between hops and malt. Nice big hops with a solid core of malt to back it up. Not over the top. Just plain good! Hop burps are tasty, too.  Mouthfeel is creamy and the beer leaves a bitter taste in the back of my throat. Good.  This is a really drinkable beer and I would definitely reach for another after the first is done.",Bear Republic Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,93
610,2751,Sammy,4.52,"For my medal round (higher site honour) I was fortunate to pick a masterpiece. A terrific American IPA of yummy refreshing grapefruity lemon citrus and high hops, little bitterness. Like Marsela Mamma in a fussy mood. Greatly drinkable. balanced aftertaste. Had on tap very fresh 8.5 years later and this classic with juicy orange this time worked just fine, long finish, lacey.",Bear Republic Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,93
610,2751,GCBrewingCo,4.35,The beer poured crystal clear light amber golden. The head was white and very compact and lasted to lace the glass.  The aroma was muted hops and slight caramel. Hop aroma was low and there was also present a fruity and spicy aroma.  The flavor was malty and sweet yet well balanced with hop bitterness. The hop bitterness and flavor increase while the maltiness fades leading to a complexity in the flavor.  The finish was slightly sweet then trailed off to dry with a slight hop bitterness which increased into the aftertaste. The body was medium to medium full.  Great beer!  22 ounce bottle. (I think I have had this beer awhile and the hop aroma has faded somewhat.),Bear Republic Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,93
610,2751,WetCoaster,3.44,"Appearance: Pours a clear, pale copper with fine, active carbonation. Puffy, rocky, quickly fading slightly off-white head. The lacing is oddly thin for a 7% IPA.  Smell: Good morning! Booming pine resin right off the bat with a wonderful bright citrus fruit scent throughout. Dense and sweet pineapple notes dominate.  Taste/Mouthfeel: Not what I expected. The hops are huge and delicious up front, but the flavor trails off badly mid-pallate. The majority of the flavor is a rather unpleasant grainy, slightly soapy tang. Moreover, the mouthfeel is fairly thin and ""dead""; there's none of the pillowy, chewy feel that the hop oil in a big IPA usually provides, and the carbonation doesn't add much. The finish is piney and bitter with a slightly spicy aftertaste.  Drinkability: For a 7% brew, it's very thin, but the weak middle flavor would me me think twice about drinking too many.  This beer is something of a legend here in NorCal, and I was very much looking forward to a controlled, objective tasting, rather than the usual drunken Healdsburg post-wine tasting pallate cleanse. Sadly, not impressed. Bought this 22 at a Napa gourmet mart, so it should have been fresh; glass should have been clean. This might have been the victim of some soap residue, but the beer seems the most likely culprit. Not awful, but not interesting--Stone Ruination blows its door off.",Bear Republic Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,93
610,2751,Dmann,4.55,"This was a great beer for sure. It poured a amber color with a big cloud like white head that left tons of lace down the glass. The smell was very bready but at the same time the citrus notes from the hops crept in as well. The taste was alot smoother than I was expecting, with a nice creamy mouthfeel, great malt presence and a nice biting but not too bitter hoppiness. This a very tame west cost IPA IMO but a very sessionable one nonetheless.",Bear Republic Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,93
610,2751,Stubbie1,4.37,"Golden color with a thick white head. Little to no lace. Citrus and pine come across the nose. The flavor is thick chewy and creamy, citrus and malt come strong.

High quality creation, seek-drink-enjoy.",Bear Republic Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,93
610,2751,david23,4.32,This is a hop lover's dream. Pours a light golden amber with an off white head that disapates to a thin layer but leaves a nice thin lacing as you enjoy. Hops is what this is all about.A lttle to cloudy for my taste. Initially just a wonderful wake up call to your taste buds and then settles down to a maltly feel but not for long. Get ready for a hop explosion that just continues and finishes with a dry hop flavor that just begs you to have another to quench your thirst.This is just a great example of an American IPA that has raised the bar of what can be done. A definite keeper. Bittering is a little heavy but i love that. Not for the uninitiated.,Bear Republic Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,93
610,2751,garthwaite,4.05,"Pours a golden amber with a white creamy head. Smell is pine & gentle hops.

610,2751,elmocoso,4.63,"Whoo-  Big creamy head - 2 fingers that fall, leaving a sticky high water mark of lacing and creating a bulbous crannied head.

Am amazing dark golden colour out of the bottle, I cannot remember a brew that offered such a heady and rocky head, at that. The aroma was just the kind of amazingly hoppy herbalicious backbone that I enjoy so much. The flavor is smooth and crisp, with notes of faint citrus, but make no mistake about it, this one is all about the hops. A fantastic IPA and, if I may say so, one of if not the best I have had in some time.  Zum wohl!",Bear Republic Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,93

Better than I thought it would be (wasn't impressed with Hop Rod Rye... the only other Bear Republic beer I've tried). This is an IPA's IPA.

610,2751,ViveLaChouffe,4.32,From a 22oz bomber.  Pours a hazy orange copper with a thick orangey-white head. Persistent lace. Smell is big citrus and floral hops. More sweet smelling than bitter.  Taste is fruity and citrusy. Nice malt backbone to lets the lupulins shine. Hoppy bitterness but lots of more complex flavors in there too. Dandelion and daisy flavors if you can believe it. Grapefuity citrus and a slow assertive lingering hop bitterness in the finish. Medium bodied and rounded hop profile. Very drinkable IPA and refreshingly complex. A good bet for sure.,Bear Republic Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,93
610,2751,BuckeyeNation,4.53,"Slightly hazed tangerine-amber. Since the label says that the beer is bottle conditioned and that 'yeast is good', I imagine that my last few pours will cloud things up nicely. The head is the color of rich cream and is a little frothy, yet stiff. I anticipated a lot of lace and am not disappointed. The cap falls slowly and unevenly, leaving thick sheets and chunks of lace all over the glass. A superb look.  The nose is as wonderful as I'd hoped: big, juicy, citrusy hops running rampant. There's a second variety in there as well, something that gives a slightly more pungeant, earthy aroma. A quick check of the Bear Republic website tells me that Cascade and Columbus hops are in use. Cascade have the upper hand in the aroma; I hope the same is true on the palate.  I enjoy the flavor quite a bit, but the Columbus hops are too prominent. While they don't completely overshadow the citrusy goodness of the Cascade, they do change the flavor profile just enough to keep me from loving it. Anderson Valley's Hop Ottin' is all Columbus hops and I learned from drinking that beer that it's not a hop that thrills me. There's a fair amount of sweetish pale malt that's not intrusive, but it is noticeable. The finish is long and increasingly hoppy and the body/mouthfeel is full and buttery smooth.  Racer 5 is somewhere between an IPA and a DIPA in terms of flavor, body and ABV. While I do have some quibble about the choice of hops, the quality of this beer is not to be doubted. A little heavier with the Cascade and a little lighter with the Columbus and this would easily be one of my favorite IPAs. Now, if they would only bottle Racer X.",Bear Republic Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,93
610,2751,HardTarget,3.82,"Aroma: I&#8217;m getting a collection of hop smells. It&#8217;s almost overwhelming, and it&#8217;s a bit worrying, seems like this will cause my head to implode. Some minor fruit smells, mainly apple. Appearance: Great looking beer, a hazy golden orange. Two finger head settled down to about a half finger of thick, fluffy, creamy white head that left tidemarks and impressive lace. Flavor: There is enough malt to bring all the hops back to somewhere in the area of balance, but as the beer warmed, the hops really picked up and came close to a hop burn. A touch of sweet malt poked though to give a nice overall taste. The hops seem to be noble, Hallertauer perhaps. Mouthfeel: Heavy body, a thick fluid that triggered a chew. Overall Impression: A very drinkable big brew. Quite easy on the eyes, it&#8217;s a beautiful beer. The noble hops kinda threw me, I&#8217;m used to more of American cascade, but different is good.",Bear Republic Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,93

Lots of butterscotch in the nose with lemon, other citrus notes and pine.  Rich and floral throughout. Heavily bitter. Orange, lemon and other citrus notes combined with a whole lot of floral and pine qualities all demolishing the caramel from the malt. The caramel that is their is lovely.  This is a highly hopped IPA. Not excessive and very drinkable. I definately am getting my alpha acid fix here as well.  A great beer to start off the night. Now I need to clean my palate with some cream havarti cheese and ge ready for De Dolle Oerbier Reserva 02.",Bear Republic Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,93
610,2751,Zorro,4.32,"Pours a hazy copper colored brew.  Smell is malt and hops that tickle your nose. The hops are a mellow citrus smelling variety.  Taste is a well-balanced ale with the hops and malt just about perfectly balanced against one another. The hops give this a dry astringent after taste.  Mouthfeel is quite good.  A very drinkable brew. The label on this reminds me of ""Speed Racer."" Go Speed Racer Go!",Bear Republic Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,93
610,2751,ADR,3.8,"Bright dark gold color with tiny brown flecks caught in suspension. Nice head, pale in color and lasts about 45 seconds or so. Sheet-like lacing. Bright orange citrus aroma, little else. Mouthfeel is just shy of medium. Hops assert early, juicy and chewy in the American style, and backed by aromatic essence. Straight-up orange rind is the biggest imression here. The malt backbone just doesn't punch through much, but the hops have enough depth to give some interest and a complexity of sorts on the bittering side. Clean finish, but definitely pithy. Well-done beer for a hop mood, but how many IPAs tread the same road?  Source: Liquid Solutions",Bear Republic Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,93
610,2751,UnionMade,4.63,"The beer pours a coppery gold, a slight haziness adding a glow to it. A thick froth of white head billows up, settling into a rocky lump, leaving huge amounts of lace that coats the pint glass. A small pile of foam rests at the bottom when the beer is done. The aroma is apparent from several feet away. It's like walking into a hop garden. Pungently floral and citric, with an incredibly fresh aroma distinctly akin to sticking your head into a bag of freshly picked hop cones. Good malt balance, incredibly, with a mild toasty quality. Faint fruity esters and a trace of alcohol round out the scent. The flavor starts with a rich, sweet malty goodness. A bit of a dextrinous feel, creating a rather full mouthfeel. A bit of yeast adds both body and a mildly sweet breadiness. The hops settle in quickly, plopping themselves down with an insane amount of rindy hop flavor. A bit of flowery pear esters add a touch of fruitiness, continuing into the finish. The finish picks up considerable bitterness, barely kept in check with the malt. Intensely floral hop flavor, with a slight citric bite. Almost impossibly fresh tasting, like the hops were added while still live on the vine. A light fusel alcohol bite right in the end. The hop aftertaste continues for hours after the bottle is finished. A beefy medium body, slowly pushed along by slight, understated carbonation. A bit slick in feel, somehow finishing crisp and fairly dry. Great stuff. This beer is really quite over the top, more in the double IPA category by my standards, but so endearing in it's jolly bigness. One of the most spectacularly fresh tasting IPAs I've had the pleasure of drinking. Really amazing, considering it's from a bottle. Great stuff.",Bear Republic Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,93
610,2751,Shiredave,4.57,"Deep golden color, tall, off white head with excellent retention and lacing. Aroma is BIG piney hop ( centennial Im thinkin) and marmalade on warm toast. Great citrus and malty grain flavors up front with a sharp hop bite on the tongue. Malt sweetness doesnt hang around long as strong grass and pine needle hop takes over and dominates this outstanding IPA. Fresh raw grain character makes it taste just that; very fresh. Medium - full mouth feel with a controlled, peppery bitter finish and a warming tickle of alcohol. Tasty hop burbs!",Bear Republic Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,93
610,2751,FranklinPCombs,3.67,"Pours a pale yellowish orange, with a quickly receding head, and leaves little spots of lace. The smell is grapefruity pine from the hops, with a subtle hint of musty groudcover, kind of like fresh mushrooms. The taste is, interestingly, strong with peanut flavor. There is a brief hint of syrupy sweet hops right before the peanut kicks in. The flavor melts into a blend of all these tastes, with a slightly astringent bitter taste. The beer feels both dry and lightly syrupy on the tongue. An interesting beer to be certain.",Bear Republic Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,93
610,2751,longpondbeerman,4.34,"From the bomber, this IPA poured a light sparkling gold topped off by a medium snow white head. The aroma of hops wafts potently up from the bubbles, and the grapefruit esters are prevelant as I bring the pint glass to the nose. The taste is tart and hoppy--very hoppy. The bitter grapefruit aroma dominates too in the taste, but there is a strong nutty current--this is nicely intricate, well-balanced, and with a substantial mouthfeel. Much like the Dogfish Head 60. I like. A lot.",Bear Republic Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,93
610,2751,RedDiamond,4.31,"Racer 5 is a damn fine IPA, one whose periodic on-tap availability is eagerly anticipated by regional beer quaffers throughout the Pac Northwest. It pours with a tall head of soapy white suds that leaves thready lace garlands as it recedes. The crisp hop nose is a genuine standout feature owing to a hearty infusion of Northwestern grown Columbus hops. Racer 5 is golden and clear but yeast particles will not stay in the bottle. They pour out in thick chunks and gobs that might appear unappetizing to some. The body is smooth with a bitterness that is striking but not excessive. Hearty, drinkable and clean. Racer 5 delivers everything you might expect from a good IPA.",Bear Republic Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,93
610,2751,Gueuzedude,4.32,"Pours a clear copper color, and is topped by a 3 finger tan head. Nice aromas of orange, apricot, and a general pungent fruitiness course through my nose as I take a big whiff. Interestingly enough I also get some notes of just over-ripe plum as I go in for another sniff. The first sip, ahhh, this was the hop fix that I have been looking for. This beer is ripe with hop notes from beginning to end. There is a medium level of sweetness, and a toasted maltiness in the finish. The sweetness helps to pick up and accentuate the fruity hop notes that are in this beer. The hops taste of apricot, lychee, and ripe citrus fruit. It finishes with a solid bitterness that ties the whole beer together and demands that you take another sip. This is the beer I was looking for tonight, it just hits the spot.",Bear Republic Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,93
610,2751,CBFanWish,4.42,"At the Henrietta MacGregor's I had one of these today. It wasn't my first time, but I haven't reviewed this one yet. Bear Republic is a brewer that defines quality. They take great time and effort in the concocting of every beer that leaves the brewery. Racer 5 is no exception. Pouring a wonderfully hazy copper colour and blanketed in a beautiful white, frothy head, it is everything a good IPA should look like. The head lasted quite a while and left a spider web of lace as I drank the beer. The head released a strong floral aroma of roses and also a soft citrus scent. This led to an easy to drink, yet complex taste. At first I noticed a sweetness accented by a floral and grassy feel. It finished with a bittersweet citrus taste. It's wonderful what hops can do. Racer 5 is one of the IPA's that is really putting micro brews on the map. It is a quality ale that is, without a doubt, everything a good IPA should be. I found it easy to drink and rather refreshing. Who is this beer for? The people who would enjoy this most are the more discriminating drinkers. Someone who truly appreciates a complex ale such as this. I would also suggest that someone who is just starting to build their palate stay away from this until they develope a strong palate for hops. This is a true west coast IPA. There is little balance in order for the hops to make their pressance known.",Bear Republic Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,93
610,2751,watermelonman,3.9,"This was a very nice sampling. It kept me interested and on my toes with a nice floral taste. It's definitely hoppy, but not excessively so.

It's substantial, but not overwhelming.",Bear Republic Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,93
610,2751,Jables,4.47,"Pours a clear dark golden color with a big thick creamy head with nice coating sheets of lace.  Smell is sweet and aromatic. Citric hops with sticky sweet malt.  Taste is a well balanced blend of citrus fruit, more lemon less grapefruit, and biscuity malt that holds throughout. The flavor of this is never lacking and never too big. It is very drinkable because of that. Leaves a lingering sour/bitter note.  Mouthfeel can be best described as perfect, It's heavy enough to provide support for the flavors and never taste watery but doesn't bog down the beer either, makes it real smooth and creamy.  Overall, a very enjoyable brew. Thanks to WVBeerGeek!",Bear Republic Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,93
610,2751,rabidawg,4,"Appearance: Golden copper with heavy carbonation. Creamy, sticky white head with clinging sheets of lace. (This is a characteristic that all BR beers I've had tend to possess.)  Smell: Definitely an IPA, with the typical citrus hop notes. Not really that ""big""as far as IPAs go, particularly left-coasters.  Taste: Nice citric hops initially, well balanced by the maltiness. A little green in the finish, and quite bitter and drawing at the end. A good IPA, but not one of my favorites.",Bear Republic Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,93
610,2751,twilight,4.43,"Yum. Yum. Yum.  I have to gush about beeradvocate turning me on to good beer. The appearance was this golden reddish colour, with hop schmutz floating around the glass. Being a homebrewer, I appreciated this touch, even though it was probably unintentional, and would have settled to the bottom had I kept the bottle in the fridge longer. The smell is slightly sweet with a clean and crisp hop aroma. The taste- yum yum yum- a sweet malt flavor that coats the mouth with a great balance of hops. More hops than in normal beers, but deliciously balanced by the malt. While drinking it, the phrase smooth bitterness popped into my head. This feels full, rich, delicious with light carbonation and a dry hop aftertaste. I love this beer. Can't wait to try more. Am particularly lucky to have found this in NYC.

610,2751,RootedFool,4.5,"Purchased a 22 ounce bomber at the North Coast Co-op in Arcata, California.  Pours solid gold with a cloud-white half-inch head. Thick, foamy ring of lace left on the glass.  The nose is an elegant explosion of hops -- pine trees, orange and lemon rinds.  Aggressive hops adroitly come through on the tongue, bordered by some citrus accents, leaving a clean, tart aftertaste. Alcohol is in the taste, too -- well masked by the other flavors -- pleasantly warming the back of my throat.  Mouthfeel is silky yet full-bodied enough to bear the bounty of hops without falling on its ass.  As a big fat hop head, I loved drinking this. I mean, I'm loving it -- not finished the bottle, yet!  Not my favorite of the big and bold IPA's, but it ranks high.  p.s. After some deliberation, I want to add that this tastes a lot like Hop Rod Rye without the rye (also by Bear Republic). I'm thinking of Racer 5 as the delicious, inferior twin.",Bear Republic Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,93
610,2751,GreatPondBrewer,4.03,"22 oz. Bomber. Poured a clear golden color with a frothy, eggshell white head that receded into a ring around the edge of the glass and tons of sticky lace on the sides. Smell was super citrusy coupled with an orange sweetness and other fresh citrus fruits. The taste was brutal in the hop department which smoothed into a very malty profile for the color. As the beer warmed the 7% ABV really takes hold. However, with the adition of the sediment the taste mellows considerably to a grassier flavor with a honey-baked sweetness and the hops took a more subdued floral approach. Quality IPA and glad to have it in the Rochester area.",Bear Republic Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,93
610,2751,frank4sail,4.17,"I have saved this awesome gift from Boilermaker88 for a special event.. and I need it tonight for luck and comfort. This is the pre-NFC championship beer.  Musty sweet hop flowers with a touch of pine on the tip of my nose. Nice airy white head on the pour with a very filtered golden color look in the glass with a touch of amber color. Initial blast taste-wise of orange rind, sweet malt, pine, and grapefruit juice in the bitter dry finish on the tongue. Fullish soft mouth upfront this then turns dry on on the back of the tongue in the finish. The finish could be slightly better balenced (malt wise).. but that is just me being picky. Overall this is a wonderful ipa that impacts the mouth and tongue with its hop presence. Very good!",Bear Republic Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,93

610,2751,beerinator,4.24,"Appearance: Golden with a hint of caramel amber color. Great head retention.  Aroma: Fanciful enormous citrusy hop aroma. Aroma is very nice. Caramely citrus blend. Candied hops.  Taste: Upfront a bit of maltyness, with a tiny hint of vegital hop flavor. Great mouthfeel. Citrusy hops overpower what little vegital flavor is present. Finish is nice dry and quick. Flavor isn't quite as hoppy as expected from the wonderful aroma. But it's still a great beer.  Notes: Very nice. Should be better from a fresher bottle.",Bear Republic Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,93
610,2751,saskguy,4.1,"The white head went fast, but the bubbles kept showing up.  Has a rich golden colour.  Has a strong hop aroma.  Starts with an agressive hop flavour up front that seems to cover the tounge, then has a hint of sweet malt that finished with a slightly dry roasted flavour.",Bear Republic Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,93
610,2751,ChappyCubsFan,4.38,"One of the five best IPA's I've ever tasted and a beer that continuously delivers excellent quality. The balance of hops and malt is fantastic. This is what the robust California IPA is all about. I can only think of a few IPA's that rival this one. Unless you've tried one, you have not achieved beer nirvana.",Bear Republic Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,93
610,2751,OatmattStout,4.5,"Great big cream colored fluffy head with really thick lacing that was more like a solid blanket on the side of the glass. Smell was huge with a lot citrus notes and serious piney notes. Taste followed suit with a somewhat lighter malt side and great hop character of sweet citrus and resonous pine with a nice peppery, spicy finish. Very clean and dry. This is a great session IPA cause it's malt body is not over the top and it is not to heavy, although it is bottle conditioned to 7% so you get a lot of bang for your buck.  Like this one alot and will grab it when I can.",Bear Republic Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,93
610,2751,Onceeven,4.2,"Phew, this one was something else! Pungent hop aroma, like smelling fresh hop pellets. Poured a clear copper color, with two finger thick head that slowly dissipated and left an impressive lacing all over the place. Carbonation was minimal. They must have dry hopped the hell out of this brew. I braced myself for a hop overload, but was surprised to taste a pretty well balanced beer (balanced for an IPA anyway). There is an initial bite, mixed with a bready malt tone, then hops all the way through to the finish. Every sip was an explosion of flavor!",Bear Republic Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,93
610,2751,DagFishHead,4.28,"Appearance: Clear amber pour. Voluminous, creamy, eggshell-white head hangs in there like meringue on a lemon pie. Thick, creamy spider-web lace. Smell: Holy hops! Olfactory assault of floral and citrus hops, hop oils, piney, toasty malt in the background with a decent whiff of alcohol and breadiness. Taste & Mouthfeel: Medium-bodied caramel malt followed by a sharp whack of piney/pitchy hops, clean crisp carbonation at the top, bitter/citrus hops dry to the bone leaving a flowery and oily/acidic hop aftertaste. Better balance than implied by the nose. Drinkability: A superbly balanced IPA. I'll be looking for this again and again.",Bear Republic Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,93
610,2751,francisweizen,4.5,"An excellent IPA from Bear Republic. This pours out a creamy orangey/peachy colour with a large white head of foam. The aromas are all fresh cut piney/citrusy hops with a nice malt backbone to boot. The taste is a hop explosion with some great bready malts on the finish. The mouthfeel is quite smooth and reminds me of real ale. Bottle conditioned magic, I tell ya. The drinkability is excellent as well. All hail the bear! Why is this stuff SO EASY to get anywhere in NYC, but impossible to get in PA, why....why....why....!?",Bear Republic Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,93
610,2751,Realale,4.7,"Clear light copper. Very fine white head settles to a complete cap leaving nice lacing.  Nose is citric hop over a slightly rich biscuity malt. Very well-balanced.  Balance carries through to the palate. Lots of malt, and lots of wonderfully extracted hop flavor. Finish is long, and well-balanced between hop bitterness and malty sweetness.  Very soft beautiful bottle-conditioned mouthfeel really keeps the hop bitterness in check. Simply excellent. Its nice to find an American IPA that has the malt to balance, not just support, the hops.",Bear Republic Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,93
610,2751,goz,4.52,"Pours amber/copper with a large white creamy head that somewhat lasts and leaves a fair amount of lace. Aroma has hints of sweet maltiness, but is dominated with strong citrus hoppiness. Flavor starts with some fine malts, then comes a pile of chewy, juicy, super fresh tasting hops that linger around for a while. Medium-full bodied, slightly acidic, ends pretty dry.",Bear Republic Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,93
610,2751,Weissenheimer,4.18,"I usually don't go for IPAs unless I have companion food to fend off the hops, but as I take a single taste of this stuff I know that it will be fine on its own. My pint arrives with a small head which soon diminishes to a foamy strip winding its way across a thin film of suds. The beer has a pleasingly mellow, coppery tinge that softens it from amber to something reminiscent of pumpkin. It carries a happy, crisp, moderately hoppy scent.  The taste is amazingly full and round for an IPA. I am very impressed. It has a big, lovely, solid body backing up a hoppiness which brings green, growing things to mind. Its metallic bite is embedded in an overarching rounded taste which protects me from what might otherwise be a harsh experience. Toward the end of the pint I notice a slightly woody element. This beer is not all that complicated but its fullness provides an enjoyable drinking experience.",Bear Republic Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,93
610,2751,BeerResearcher,4.23,"This is a big IPA...could be called an Imperial IPA. It pours a bright shiny copper with a medium-sized off-white head and some trails of lace. The aroma is mostly made up of fragrant floral hops, with a hint of sweet malt. The body is fairly full and sweet for the style. Caramel and vanilla wafer come to mind. A big blast of fresh sharp-edged hops jumps out with grapefruit, lemon zest and a faint metallic tang. The warming alcohol mixed with the lush sweetness gives this brew a sort of brandied candy flavor, only a tad more astringent in the finish.",Bear Republic Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,93
610,2751,nomad,4.25,"Poured a beautiful shade of golden amber, well conditioned by the bottle. Head was thick and tight foam, leaving strips of stain.  Smell was sweet and thin in a nice, clear way: grapefruit with stickly pine, joined by some peach notes and herbal scents. As it warmed it coalesced into a honey-dipped fruit smell. Delectable.  Tasted of grapefruity goodness with a sweetish but appetizing malt backbone. Its big floral flavors were tastier than ever in an IPA. Had some straight fruitiness in time with a mediocre bitterness in the finish. Full-flavored but a little thin in flavor and mouthfeel, the finish detracted a smidge too.  Regardless, a very good West Coast IPA fighting hard against the competition, but is more drinkable than some of those hop-monsters though.",Bear Republic Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,93
610,2751,tavernjef,4.6,"Nice ambery copper color, somewhat hazy with little floaty things, hop leaf bits probably, finger high off-white head of thick bubbly froth, fades slowly to a thin haze and a ring which remains present the whole glass. Lace is sticky in large webby sheets. Aroma is oh so nice with lovely hops of piney deepness and citrusy oils with a soft, round caramel maltyness. Straight up IPA nose from the West coast eh, quite nice, could smell it at arms length. Taste has a nice piney sense with a mellowness thats welcoming; increasing citrus of dull orange oil and grapefruit mixed with a touch of woody dryness and a nice even bittering hop bite thats resin filled and quite nice the whole way through. Caramel malts keep a sweeter notion overall on the under side. Feel is solid medium bodied with a nice little creamy smoothness and fluffyness that slides right down. This beer clinched it for me. I love hops!! I've held back on wanting a hop fix, but no longer, I'm going to start hoarding hop heavy beers dammit! This was a very nice IPA! The bomber was gone in no time! And I thank Drewbage1847 for it!",Bear Republic Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,93
610,2751,scottum,3.97,"Pours a pale amber with quite the short head for a slightly hard pour of an IPA. Hops are bitter and citrus tinged. Malts are a bit bready and sweet, but do an admirable job of mellowing the hopster. A very mild taste of the 7% still shows through. Overall a very decent IPA. Worth a try.",Bear Republic Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,93
610,2751,DrewBeechum,4.56,"Poured from a 22oz bottle into my Map Room pint glass.  Beer pours copper orange with a fair haze. Tough soapy and sticky white head hangs onto the glass and  Aroma is piney and deep resin with sticky citrus, sweet orange oils and a light alcohol Grand Marnier like finish.  Flavor starts with a soapy orange bitterness and proceeds through a with a medium malt body with spiced overtones. Finish has a return of the hoppiness this time with more grapefruit and lemon characters.

610,2751,winomark,4.04,"Appearance: Pours a deep gold with a wispy, off-white head.  Aroma: Hop citrus and spiciness hits hard. Tiny alcohol and malty notes in the back.  Taste: Lots of hop bitterness and dryness is dominant. Malt makes a tiny appearance to offer some balance. A hop-head's dream beer.  Mouthfeel: Dry and crisp, but has good body. A wonderful, hoppy finish.  Drinkability: A great IPA; much better than I remember. Would love to make this one a regular at my house.",Bear Republic Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,93
610,2751,taez555,4.54,"This beer poured a big thick white head with a clear amber body.  The nose was beautiful. Fresh sharp citrus hop. Pepper (not necessarily black), flowers, touches of pine needles, caramel, malt. Basically this is what A.P.A.&#8217;s are supposed to smell like.  The taste was nice and creamy. Medium to full bodied. Rich caramel and a big fresh malt taste. Smooth with a high level of bitterness, but balanced perfectly against the malt. The hop flavors, (citrus, pepper, pine, flowers, grapefruit, lime peel) are all present and balanced, but so much more subdued than you might expect from such a big beer.  It ends slightly medicinal but nicely bitter and hoppy.  Overall just an amazing IPA. Very smooth, clean and easy drinking. Lots of big malts, and huge fresh hops, all perfectly balanced and yet so well mellowed it doesn&#8217;t overshadow anything else. A must try beer.

610,2751,AtLagerHeads,4.25,"Another one of the very fine SoCal IPAs, this one has a great level of hopping that seems perfectly mated to the fine malt base. The clear copper body is covered by a single finger of off white head that laces the glass very abundantly. The aromas are equally well balanced between a fine carmel malt and the lovely floral hops.  The taste of this beer is just great with strong malt and hop presence. The feel is great as well with a nice medium body and a crisp and dry finish. Very good drinkability from this nice brew.",Bear Republic Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,93
610,2751,RoyalT,4.08,"Appearance  Very clear, thin-looking body with a tremendous, foaming head that laced and pitted my Ruination glass.  Smell  Sharp, piney hops lead the way here. If theres a malt balance I cant find it. This one is all about the hops. Very complex, actually, with some floral and citrus notes.  Taste  The taste sees through the promises of the nose. The complex hoppy flavor comes out at the tongue, but not overly sharp. Theres a tremendous smoothness to this ale that reminds me of NW style IPAs.  Mouthfeel  Very smooth and medium-bodied. This one is also exceptionally dry and refreshing.  Drinkability  Clean and distinctive offering of the style. I brought a few more Bear Republics back with me from LA and am looking forward to giving them a try.  Comments - The brewery is located in Healdsburg, home of the CA Wine Country.

The nose I can only describe as that of a sticky marijuana plant. Not that I know what one smells like. Ive been to the Haight one too many times.  The hop flavors come through strongly. I think there is a hop stuck in my teeth! There are some biscuity malt flavors somewhere in the background struggling to make themselves heard. An exceedingly dry finish.  Overall, a bit too hoppy for my liking. Could use a bit more balance. It literally tastes like hops steeped in boiling water.

The floral aroma of the hops greets your senses first, followed by the sweet fresh malt sweetness; start carries on the malt sweetness to the middling top. Finish is perky in its acidity, the hops potent and pleasing in their spicy bite, desert dry aftertaste, and one damn fine IPA in my books, and one I always keep on hand in the bottle and a great example of a California IPA.",Bear Republic Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,93
610,2751,UncleJimbo,4.3,"Sampled on tap at Redbones.  This IPA poured a hazy, copper color with white foam that settled to a thin coat that clung to the glass a bit. The smell was sweet malt and fruity hops. The taste was sweet and tangy malt balanced with fruity, floral hops, and some hoppy bitterness in the finish. The mouthfeel was smooth and very hoppy, though well balanced with malt. The body was medium with modest carbonation. The finish was dry. This was a very nice IPA. I would like to try this in a bottle.",Bear Republic Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,93
610,2751,Jason,4.23,"22oz brown bomber with no freshness date.  Appearance: Mildly hazed golden orange, a most excellent froth with a web like trail of lace.  Smell: Clean and fresh citrusy hop aroma, hop oil and a pungent coarseness show the bucket loads of hops they used. Light estery alcohol, toasted malt lay meekly underneath the hops.  Taste & Mouthfeel: Nice hard slap of hop to begin with, the pungent bitterness lingers on and on. Lots of hop flavour and a soothing bottle conditioned smoothness that cant be beat! The maltiness is muscular but laid back with a biscuity flavour throughout. Mild presence for what the alcohol should show though it does warm the body after a while.  Notes: This is one of those Hop-o-licious brews. Sock it to me baby  I love those hops and keep them coming.

610,2751,WVbeergeek,5,"Appearance: Orange copper glowing heavenly tone with a massive vanilla cream colored head so massive and full of hops even from a distance wonderful evenly dispersed sketched patterns of lacing very appealing to the eye. Aroma: Extremely pungent but so very appetising almost mesmorizing so I warn thee don't spend to much time sniffing this awesome brew it's so hard to back away the old snout and quit wafting this baby toward my olfactories that are working overtime in order to host this well balanced hop monster. So many enticing and prosperous aromas flying around besides the hops which are breathtaking by the way, but a sweet engulfing aroma is entwined within the massive amount of hops creating the recipe for a succesful big IPA. Taste: Wow, should we even start this part of the beer, might as well it's fucking awesome. I now know why this beer has the surrounding hype that exists when mention it's name the crashing wave of foam carrying bready pine cone infused hops and caramelly sweet malt within the viscous juicly hopped body it's beer nirvana. These beers have truly surpassed everything else certain brewer's have taken it to the next level this beer is no where near the gimmick that some beers attempt to be, but it does so well in soothing my hopheadedness that I can't help but thank anybody that had to do with getting it into my reach. Mouhfeel: The resilent foaming head holds such a fluffy creaminess with each sip followed by a flowing wave of the combonaiton of the body of this beer bringing texture and sensations along the palate that I didn't know could be obtained. Drinkability: It's redamndiculous how friggin' amazing this beer is and how bad I want to order a case from somewhere I would be dangerous with a case of this stuff b/c once this bottle got to the halfway mark I was thinking where can I get more, easily consumed challenging but so enjoyable and drinkable in general.

The head could've stuck around a bit longer, but oh well. Excellent lacing as this rather tall glass of beer was consumed.  Sell: A great blend of floral and bitter hops on the nose, with the floral aromatics taking the center stage. Nice backing of pale malt.  Taste: A near perfect balance of malt and hop flavors: not too sweet, not palate-numbingly bitter. Grapefruit notes on the finish. My girlfriend, who has an aversion to bittering hops, kinda liked this one.. maybe she's getting acclimated...  Mouthfeel: Nice medium bodied feel, slightly astringent, but this is an IPA.

610,2751,PatandDavid,4.21,"Re-Review 9/5/04  Looks like I had this just a little over a year ago, and this time it was super.  Autumn gold in color, nice malty aroma, sheet lacing. I found the taste to be 100% hop candy. In this I mean the hops were prominent and fresh, but also that there seem to be so much hops packed into the beer that there is actually a candy like note (not syrupy, but candy-like). Very smooth, I had 2 of these which means that I will be making adjustments to my previous tally.  old review:  Had this on tap at Redbones...Color when served was of cloudy apple juice. I didn't pick up too much aroma from this one. Not too much head, but left beautifully striped lacing all through my glass. Taste was very citrusy, fresh, with a nice tart mouthfeel. Not a lot of malty notes in this one. I didn't find it it overhopped or anything, but the one taste sensation was: citrus. Would drink again (actually I have a bomber in my bier kabinett waiting for me). Reminiscent of Rogue Brutal Bitter imo. Pat",Bear Republic Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,93
610,2751,mikeys01,3.85,"Appearance of the Racer 5 is a nice early sunset orange, with a whitecapped frothy white head. Very good clariy on draft. Aroma is good and freshly hopped -probably due to the freshness of the brew - they apparently brew 2 batches a day at BR, with the majority being Racer 5. Also smells fairly fruity, more than expected. Good flavor of citric hops, lightly malted, and pinish bitterness. Very smooth and not too heavy considering it's on the bigger edge of IPA's. Very drinkable, right up there with my other favorite IPA's such as Stone, though the two aren't very comparable.

610,2751,far333,3.6,"Dark orangey apricot color with a beige thick, oily looking head that clings to the sides of the glass. Aroma is of hops, honey, pear, and alcohol in equal amounts. Flavor is not very hoppy, but has hints of orange peel and honey and some floral notes. There is a distinct alcohol flourish in the back of the tongue in the finish, and it also lingers afterward. Mouthfeel is a little watery, a bit low on carbonation. Tasty beer, but needs more balance. The flavor is overpowered by the alcohol.",Bear Republic Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,93

Very nice, citrusy nose.  I am coming to the conclusion that the Bear Republic folks brew really good beer.  Very representative of the style and a well-done version. I could relax and drink a number of these.  Mid-range hang time and just a touch of metallic finish.  An enjoyable beer.",Bear Republic Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,93
610,2751,brakspear,4.31,"22 oz bomber bottle.  A very good and extremely drinkable Westcoast IPA, dangerously so at 7% apv.  The appearance is a soft and ""relatively"" clear light orange with a clumpy white head. But for some reason this bottle has sheets of sediment floating. I thought they were hop flower petals at first. They really detract from the appearance, but have no effect on taste or mouthfeel.  The aroma is a nice grapefruit/citrus blend, but not overpowering to scare off newcomers to the hoppier Westcoast IPAs.  The flavors are a very nice blend of malts and bracing hoppiness. A generous malty breadlike flavor gives way to smooth bitterness with just a slight snap in the finish. Very drinkable for a beer of its potency.  I would definitely put this in the stable of cross-overs beers into the more extreme IPAs available on the Westcoast.",Bear Republic Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,93
610,2751,hungryghost,4.24,"Copper, amber color. Good bubbly, head. The variance in size of bubbles making up the head, almost give it a lumpy appearance. Floral hop aroma with a pine musk. Lingering rings of lace appear, marking each step in the process of emptying the glass. Sharp hop bite with a slight citrus taste. The hop flavor slowly disipates as a nearly sweet feeling skates across the tounge. Liking hops is a pre-requisite for this one. At 7% I may not be able to type well after a full 22 ounces.

Scents are floral and fruity. Hops are mild. A nice malty quality to the scent.  Nice bitter hop bite at first. Then it mellows in to a fruit taste. Some sweet lemon. A malty ending that is smooth compared to the hop bitterness at first.  Mouthfeel is clean and medium bodied. A little density to this IPA. It drinks very easy. A very minor syrup quality to the feel of the IPA. A well thought out and complex IPA. I'll have another.,Bear Republic Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,93
610,2751,aaronh,4.5,"Bright copper color topped by a thick cream colored head. Slight chill haze, active carbonation. Much more reserved and fruity aroma than I was expecting. Instead of smacking you with hops, it's got a bit of balance and some complexity in the aroma. The taste is hop laden, to say the least. Very bitter up front, then a puckering hop quality truly sucks your cheeks together. A nice floral sweetness comes in at the finish, along with a bit of malt. Initial bitter either subsides as the beer warms or numbs the taste buds to leave a smoother, softer flavor experience in its wake. Aftertaste is multiple types of hop notes, with pine, florals, and just down right bitterness mixed with a touch of sweetness. Hop burps start after two drinks, with a nice herbal note to them. Combination of alcohol and hops create a burning warmth in the throat and stomach. Mouthfeel is full and somewhat silky. For the intensity of flavors and moderat ABV, this is an insanely drinkable beer. Very good. I like this one a lot.",Bear Republic Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,93
610,2751,StevieW,4.37,"22 oz bomber bottle. Cloudly dull amber color. Off-white head, not nearly as rocky and fluffy as the XP Pale Ale. Moderate cascade hop presence. Nice citrus and floral notes. Not as juicy and resiny as the other one either, but still a nose full of fresh hop aromas. Taste is tight, sharp and bitter. Very good IPA flavors. Bitterness is sharp and cuts through the palate. Leaves huge bitter hole on the tongue. Sweet malty undertone. Very gulpable. Easy to guzzle, and guzzle. Resounding hop burps. Cleansing. Very good IPA. I paired this with a grilled barbecue pork chop and horseradish cheddar covered broccoli. It did the job perfectly. Cut right through the tangy barbecue sauce and horseradish cheese.

The smell is a rich hoppy floral aroma, with some fruitiness also. The taste has good hops, and isn't overpowering, like some bigger IPAs. There are also some cirtus notes, and just enough malt for balance. The mouthfeel is nice and smooth. The drinkability is very nice for being 7%.

Smell: Grapefruit, pinepapple, a little citrus and pine.....all the glory that is Cascade!  Taste and mouthfeel: Hopheads rejoice! Bear Republic has managed to extract a ton of PNW hops flavor into this brew with only a scant amount of bitterness. All the aforementioned smells translate to the palate backed by a sweet, bready, lightly kilned maltiness. Creamy, slightly chewy mouthfeel, yet a bit lighter than say, a Stone IPA. Good Stuff!",Bear Republic Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,93
610,2751,brewdlyhooked13,4.23,"Pours with an orange hue. A fine creamy white head, while not big, holds on well. Pouring out the bottom half adds the sediment which clouds up the issue. 2 appearances, 1 beer. Bonus points!  Aroma is reminiscent of hop monsters past. Major floral smell, almost candy-like and some pine notes in there.  Taste is brief, but solid malt up front, then the hops prevail. They don't force their way onto the palate too soon, but wait for just a moment before blending with and transitioning from malt to hop. It's not necessarily balanced, but it doesn't have to be, it's really not supposed to be. The fact that the hops share the stage at all is noteworthy. If you've not had the likes of Hop Ottin, Ruination, Hop Devil, or Dogfish 90 Minute, then this will be a shock. Otherwise it's really a tasty IPA with a well-defined hop bite that is as much sweet as it is bitter due to some creative and delicious malt infusion. A good pick for the intermediate hopster.  After drinking about 10 ounces from the glass, I swirled and poured the remaining 8 or so from the bomber. Adding that sediment softens the hop profile considerably, making the taste as balanced in an IPA as Two Hearted Ale, though considerably less intense. 2 tastes, 1 bottle. Bonus points!!  This doesn't taste like it's 7%, I could handle 4 of these easily before I figured out I should've stopped at 3. A unique taste every hop lover owes to them self to try.",Bear Republic Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,93
610,2751,kbub6f,4.13,"Bought from the fridges at Gaslamp Liquor in San Diego, seven hours in my carryon, a couple of weeks in my fridge, reviewed 45F-70F.  This is a very pretty looking beer. The big, cream-colored head is dense in the middle with coarse bubbles around the edges. Lacing is monstrous: thick, 3-D sticky scary clumps. The color is a slightly hazy pure amber. Very fine carbonation and fine sediment on the last pour.  Hop-o-rama! The nose is darkish sweetish malty... quite complex. The front is like fresh squeezed hop juice with some caramel sweetness. The middle is creamy with a little toffee and a touch of chocolate. Very thick and a little oily. Delicious hop bitterness dominates the finish, but there's more to it than that. There's a little grass and something else I can't quite put my finger on (but it's good). The aftertaste is quite grainsy with some nice alcohol warming.  What a great, tasty beer. It's intriguing... I can't quite grasp the complexity. But I'm going to ding it a little on drinkability: with the thick body I was satisfied with one.",Bear Republic Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,93
610,2751,beernut7,3.85,This tasty IPA pours with a slightly hazy amber color and a slight lace on the glass. Mild buttery and floral spice aroma. The complex flavor involves a stronger malt presence especially bringing out a caramel roundness paired nicely with a moderate bitterness and a mild spice compared to the style. Quite drinkable and very well-balanced. There is a distinctive toffee flush through the finish.,Bear Republic Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,93
610,2751,BierReise,3.85,I didn't find this IPA as nice as the Alesmith but still an excellent brew. Deep copper color with ample froth which lightly laced the glass. Nose is hoppy with pine really standing out. A gentle bitterness which is nice and the way I personally like IPA's to be. Good to the finish with consistent flavor throughout.,Bear Republic Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,93
610,2751,feloniousmonk,4.17,"Appearance: hazy orange, ripe peach, with a good, white, and actively bubbly head of foam atop. Aroma: instantly sharp and spicy, with spikey hits of citric fruit, grapefruit, peach, apricot, plus pine, and flowers, and more. Intense! Hop attack begins in earnest on first sip and never wants to quit! A torrent, no, a blizzard, no an ever-loving bitter monsoon! A definite threat to the senses! Tingly, spicy, and ever-so-tasty! This would go great with food, I think, but I also think that it would go great with anything, anytime! Body feels thin, though, compared to the massive hop-heaviness on the palate. More malt, please, sir! There are many layering effects, though, and many rewards for this souped-up ale.",Bear Republic Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,93
610,2751,MJR,4.47,"Appearance: Pours a light amber with great clarity. It forms an off-white head that's foamy and rich, and a full finger deep. It fades to a small cap, but laces the glass well. Adding the yeast dregs doesn't really change the look much.  Smell: This brew has a great hoppy aroma with lots of pine, citrus, and grapefruit. A touch of sweet caramelly malt is present.  Taste: Full flavored with a fair amount of hop bitterness, but lots of hops flavor. Great use of dry-hopping here... Hefty doses of piney resin, grapefruit, and a touch of a floral taste. It induces pine-soaked burps... There's a nice malt backbone, which is slightly sweet with a strong caramel flavor. A bit of a toasted, bready character is in there too. A touch of alcohol on the tail end. Very well balanced, this is a damn good IPA.  Mouthfeel: Medium in body with a smooth, crisp mouthfeel. Has the perfect amount of dryness to arouse my hunger. It's just right...  Drinkability: This beer is very drinkability for a 7% India Pale Ale. If it wasn't for the higher strength, I could sip this all night.  Another fantastic brew from Bear Republic. The more I try these California micros, the more I want to move out there...",Bear Republic Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,93
610,2751,Bierman9,4.35,"A gift from The Man...Gusler! A hard pour produced a voluminous, ever-so-slightly off-white head, which settled into a lasting 1/4"" topping. Bubbles were tight and fine, and lacing was ample down the glass. The color was a medium golden, with a bit of particulate hovering about within (though not enough to distract in any way, at least for me, anyhow).  The nose was quite pleasant, with a suggestion of bready malt trying to come forth. It was put in its place by a healthy dose of grapefruity hops. A real nice combo.  Body was well within the medium range, and it had a bit of chewiness to it. The golden nectar slid smoothly over the tongue and belly-wards.  I just received this via parcel today, and being impatient, I didn't give it much time in the fridge to chill. Nonetheless, enjoyed at about 50-55F, it had a wealth of flavors. A bready, crackery aspect is present at the outset, yet the dominant driver here was the hops. A plethora of Cascade-like tastes bombard the tongue, and just linger and linger. There's no getting rid of the hop aftertaste, not that you'd want to. A pleasing, warm sensation develops in the belly, too! This one can park in my winners circle!  Thnx again to Gusler for supplying me with my first taste of the Bear! Zum Wohl!!  overall: 4.3 appearance: 4 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.5 | mouthfeel: 4.5 | drinkability: 4.5  533",Bear Republic Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,93
610,2751,PhantomVodoo,4.08,"Brownish golden color with an off-white head that leaves lace. Some sediment that's suspended in your glass. Hop aroma seems to be citrusy, piney, and floral all at the same time. Malt and a touch of alcohol underneath the hops.  Taste is controlled by the hops. Again there seems to be piney, citrusy, and floral tones to them. Although the hops win out this beer is definitely not one-sided. A good malt backbone shows it's sweetness.  Good mouthfeel from the medium to full body. Drinkability is good for a beer this substantial.  Overall this is a real nice IPA, but it didn't take it to that next level for me like I though it might.",Bear Republic Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,93
610,2751,bditty187,4.47,"Coppery-bronze/amber hue (the first pour was translucent, the second was much more hazy) with a healthy, slightly off-white head, fair retention and rings of lace. The nose was inviting with plenty of hoppy goodness faintly piney leafy with more obvious citrus notes, some caramel malt too. The palate is ideal, assertively hoppy plenty of piney/citrus influence the malt provides a solid foundation, albeit a distant but noticeable one (especially the caramel suggestions). The carbonation is perfectly lean. Medium body oh-so drinkable! Awesome! The abv is hidden. The finish is hoppy, oily yet leafy and dry; appetizing it leaves you wanting more! This has to be one of the best IPAs on Earth.  Highly Recommended!",Bear Republic Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,93
610,2751,Wildman,4.48,"This beer poured a nice amber cold color and formed a huge foamy white head that left circular lace coating the glass as is slowly, very slowy subsided. Some steady carbonation is also present to account for this. An aroma of malt, hops and some burnt caramel present. A flavor of malt, hops and caramel. A slight burnt aspect and bitterness to the finish. Slightly sweeter than most IPAs I drink, but a good beer.",Bear Republic Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,93
610,2751,Brent,4.5,"Golden caramel color. Aroma shouts ""hop-city"" right up front. Flavor is a soid dose of hops, immediately followed by sweet malt. A touch sharp up front, then the subtle floral hops flavors emerge. The finish is moderately sour and astringently bitter. Well balanced - highly hoppy but not overwhelming. Drinkability is quite good. This is my first Bear Republic beer and already I'm a fan.",Bear Republic Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,93
610,2751,Darkale,4.63,"A magnificent IPA from Bear Republic. Pours a copper-orange that seems like a Florida sunset. Very large head that slowly fades, foamy, uneven, pocked like the top of a root beer float.  The aroma is sweet and hoppy, and the taste is huge malt and hops together, mixed into a creamy swirl. The parting shot is a thin sour bitterness that just makes you want to do it again, like a 12-year old looping ten times through the same ride at the county fair.  Excellent lacing, all over the sides of the glass, and in strange shapes, like pale Rorschachs. The head recedes but stops at about 3/4 of an inch, and lingers longer than you might think possible.  This is a highly interesting beer, reminiscent of HopDevil in its mix of hops and creaminess, but with that added odd twist of bitter. Another winner -- another unique and tempting beer -- from Bear Republic.",Bear Republic Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,93
610,2751,wofat,3.62,"This IPA pours golden with a slight amber tone with a constant, champagne-like strands of carbonation from the bottom of your glass, culminating in a large, frothy head that sticks around longer than expected.  The aroma is a full on assault of fruit-like hops. I was hoping that the flavor would somehow meet up with my expectations after smelling this beer, but it starts with a moderate carmel maltiness transitioning to a too mild hop flavor and overdone bitterness. I personally would have liked a bit more hop flavor in this IPA, rather than just the lingering bitterness that this brew provides. The bitterness of the aftertaste in this beer is a bit overwhelming to the mild sweetness of the malt.  This is a tasty IPA, but fell below my expectations. Drinkability suffers due to the lack of real hop flavor and hearty, lingering bitterness.",Bear Republic Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,93
610,2751,NeroFiddled,4.5,"A well-stored bottle pours a surprisingly crystal-clear deep amber body (I can see my fingerprints through the glass on the first pour - the second becomes more hazy). The aroma of fresh piney/citric hops greets you immediately. The full and creamy vanilla head needs a few moments to settle just so you can fill the glass; and once calmed holds fairly well. It drops but keeps a solid 1/4"" of foam across the surface and leaves excellent layers of lace until the very end. The nose expresses piney/citrusy hops over a gently caramelish malt. It's very nice, and not overdone as some IPAs can be! A moderate carbonation combines with a firmly malty body to leave it creamy and smooth in the mouth. The flavor re-itereates what the nose indicated with a rich, caramel-soaked malt that's infused with piney/citrusy hops. A firm bitterness balances this big beer without going over the line; and leaves it quite drinkable (still, it is a bit filling). Really well-balanced! It finishes dry with a swiftly disintegrating maltiness followed by a flash of bitterness and then some residual piney hop flavor. An exceptional beer that's well worth seeking out.",Bear Republic Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,93
610,2751,hyuga,4.63,"The usual IPA orangish amber in color, and nice and clear. Great white head that stays extremely well! It's well presented. Big points for that. Pine hits you first when you take a whiff of this. A big malt backbone comes through underneath it. As for the taste, it's rather smooth for an IPA. No overwhelming bitterness, but it maintains the big character flavor profile that I like. Hops do play a big role though. In the front, some rind-like and leafy hop character makes its presence known. Malt stays in the background, but it's like a cloud over the sun in Phoenix, you don't pay it much heed but you know it's there making everything more comfortable for you. In the middle and back, malt is ready to come out more, and it's got a very nice ""buttery"" sweetness to it. A bit bready. The bitterness shows up in the finish, nice and crisp. Well, I think this is a very enjoyable IPA, I'll definitely have it again, hopefully more than a few times. It seems a bit underrated to me. But it's all in one's own taste, right? I'd say definitely give it a try and see for yourself!",Bear Republic Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,93
610,2751,freed,4.37,"This beer came in a 22oz with a cool label. The beer poored a beautiful copper color, which was a surprise for an IPA. The smell and taste are all IPA though. Great Citrus smell and flavor. Also, the maltiness isn't sublte, which I like. This is a big beer, though most of the bitterness is actually in the aroma. There isn't a strong bitter body to it, though i'm not sure what the IBU level is. I'll definately have this again.",Bear Republic Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,93
610,2751,cokes,3.83,"Smoggy golden orange with a thick ivory headpiece. Good retention and spastic lacework. Nose full of buttered grapefruit on metal spears. Likeable, but could use more. Full flavored and straight-foward. Begins with lightly toasted caramel drizzled bread. Touches of grain and hay towards the middle. The final half is dominated by hops. Loosely floral, with heavy fruit tones. Obviously grapefruit, but with sugared kiwi and tart oranges as well. Just slightly bitter, but quite juicy in the hopping. Sort of a one-note brew. Interesting at times, but fails to leave much of an impression. Body is spot-on. Thick and creamed. Carbonation is almost nil. Nice. A good, if standard, IPA",Bear Republic Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,93
610,2751,aracauna,3.95,"Nice shiny copper body with a good head. The aroma is sweet and citricly hoppy. The flavor is nicely malty with a lightly sweet breadiness that makes me want more of this. The problem comes in the hops that, while nicely bitter, lack a certain zing and has a slightly medicinal quality. Man, I hope I can manage to figure out this malt profile and the one in Anchor Liberty for my own homebrew when I start next week.",Bear Republic Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,93
610,2751,OldFrothingSlosh,3.95,"Appearance: Arrived in a 10 oz. glass with just a miniscule layer of creamy white head that just barely sticks to the glass. Color instantly reminded me of apple juice.  Smell: Very citrus-like...grapefruits.  Taste: A well-balanced pale ale. I could really taste the grapefruit bitterness. Finished with a touch of sweetness before the hops add some bite.  Mouthfeel: Less crisp than I expected. It was a fuller, smoother, and creamier than I expected.  Drinkability: A well-balanced pale ale. Not as assertively-hopped as some of my favorite IPA's, but not bad. Personally, I just like my IPA's a little hoppier.",Bear Republic Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,93
610,2751,mzwolinski,3.47,"Clear orangeish/gold in color, with a thin but persistant head. Big, tart citric hop aroma -- very crisp and lemony, with an underlying caramel sweetness. Flavor too is big on hops, citric in flavor with a very bitter finish and an aftertaste combining biscuity malt and fruity hop flavors. A bit of a solvent-like flavor mid-palate, which is a bit distracting, and unexpected for a beer whose alcohol level is quite moderate. Crisp and drinkable, but not one of my favorite IPAs.",Bear Republic Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,93
610,2751,TheLongBeachBum,4.6,"I thoroughly enjoyed my first 3 Bear Republic beers, so when I spied the Racer 5 IPA hiding behind a Stone IPA (of all the beers!?), I snapped up a couple of Bottles. A 1 Pint 6 fl.oz Bottle, with a ¾ wrap around paper label that has the BR Bear and a big Red 5 pinched off the front of someones racing car no doubt. Head is massive, beautiful just-off-white color, it later settled down to a more manageable 1 deep honeycomb. The lace left on the glass walls was fabulous and so reminded of that I saw left on the slate walls of Yorkshire Square Fermenters towards the end of the fermentation cycle. Large bubble laced, crispy, rocky spatterings, that when dried - need chiselling off. Nose is  Wow, yes definitely HOPS. Freshly harvested hops, mixed with a smell of freshly mown lawns. I am sure there will be grassy hop stains on the inside of my nostrils. A deep cloudy* peach/orangey amber hue showed off some very fine particles of yeast, and no doubt some hops fragments, when illuminated by incandescent light. The head has now settled to a workable ½ rock-pool encrusted collar. * The haze is most probably 100% attributable to my childish impatience - I couldn't wait to let it settle when I got back from the Beer Store - I just cracked it open as soon as I got home. Immediate mouthfeel is medium. As a Hophead, I found the taste is anticipated by a highly excited tongue, long before the beer even enters the oral cavity. Superb. Highly hopped but not excessively, as I find some beers are. There is no shock hop here, just an aggressive IPA that will suit the more discerning hop-head palate, rather than the beginner. Finish is dry, with soft spices lingering in the end. Carbonation was quite low, very akin to many English Real Ales so I did not find this to be a problem at all. Drinkability is high, very high - I love this beer, refreshing and very morish.  California has some incredible Breweries that produce stunning high quality craft beers, and Bear Republic is most definitely one of them. Highly Recommended. Another Great CA-IPA (Yet Again!!!!).  P.S. S**t, I've just realized this beer is 7% - Take Care!",Bear Republic Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,93
610,2751,Mark,4.73,"Amber gold in color with a chunky pure white head that left exceptional lace patterns. Fresh hop scent, taste was very nice, not overpowering like some domestic IPA's. I thought just right. Carbonation was on the low side, much like English ale. A great IPA, easily the best domestic one I have had. While I will buy it again and enjoyed it totally, drinkability rating was lowered due it's fairly high alcohol content and it only coming in those damm 22oz bomber bottles. Enjoyed it with a deli sandwich. This beer gets better and better, I have just upped it's rating due to realizing how great this beer is. Tremendous appearance, aroma, and taste. yes it's my favorite IPA, and my favorite domestic brew! A total winner.",Bear Republic Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,93
610,2751,sinistersteve,4.57,"Wow, is there anything this beer cannot go with. This clean looking amber beer seems to accent nicely with whatever you're eating. Full hop flavored, yet not too over powerful with hops. Nice citusy aroma that tickles the nose. Thin head and not much lace in the glass. Another great product from Bear Republic. This is one beer that you cannot go wrong with if you love IPA's.",Bear Republic Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,93
610,2751,gwfrankpsu,4.7,"This is a wonderful beer. Sitting in Healdsburg, pondering the bicycles and pondering this beer. So rich, great balance of malt and hops, but the finish - bordering on one of the best IPA's. One of life's pleasures.",Bear Republic Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,93
610,2751,BeerManDan,4.7,"Wow,I really love this beer. The balance if just great. There is a little bitterness in the finish, with a hint of lemon. I would put this beer as one of my favorites. One sip and I couldn't imagine anyone not loving the taste and balance hops and yeast of this beer!",Bear Republic Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,93
610,2751,Jordan,4.61,"Incredibly fresh sample, tap-like presentation, fluffy white head that endures, frisky carbonation. An aggresive hop profile, many complex herbal notes, subdued honey sweetness.  Heavy, filling, robust.  A superb example of living beer.",Bear Republic Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,93
610,2751,mickeymac,4.32,"Another damn fine west coast IPA. A nice gold/orange color with that familiar Cascade smell and piney undertones. Head retention is good, but it leaves minimal lace on the glass. I'd enjoy it more with a bit more malty sweetness, but I'm not complaining.",Bear Republic Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,93
610,2751,Bighuge,4.5,"Update on June 30, 2004:  This is a lot better IPA than I rated previously. I bumped straight 4's to straight 4.5s. I've had this a couple times over the past few months and it has impressed every time. Great aroma. Juicy hop taste. Just a very high quality IPA.   Hazy golden with fine particles of matter in suspension. Nice bubbly and rocky white head. Piney/citrus aroma. I can taste a little sting of alcohol in this one. But it also has a really good bitterness. Nice malt backbone and good hop tones. Slight pine and citrus on the palate. Easy drinking brew. Good IPA.",Bear Republic Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,93
