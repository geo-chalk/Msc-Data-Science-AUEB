147,90,EMH73,3.99,"Pours a dark brown with some red highlights, a thin tan head and no lacing. Smells of roasted malts, chocolate, caramel, a bit of smoke and some nuttiness. Taste follows the nose with additional notes of dark fruits and a nice hop presence. Expected far more smokiness, seems more like a porter. Medium bodied, light side of medium carbonation, smooth mouth feel.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Smoked Porter,89
147,90,detgfrsh,4.13,"From a bottle brewed 12/27/15. Dark brown color with a thin layer of brown head. Roasted malt and vanilla smell. Feels a little thin. Roasted malt and smoke with some hop bitterness on the finish. Great flavor, wish the feel was a little bit heavier.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Smoked Porter,89
147,90,mothmanscott,3.92,"From notes 4/2/12: Pours dark brown with a ruby highlight when held to the light. The pour produces a frothy, tan, short-lived head that receded to nothing and left no lacing. Aroma is dark roast, dark fruit, chocolate, a little cherry and smoke. Taste is the same with heavier dark malt notes and a nice nuttiness with minor hop hints in the finish and a lingering bitter aftertaste. The level of smoke is a little disappointing. The taste is well balanced. Mouthfeel is medium-heavy bodied with nice carbonation, smooth and very drinkable.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Smoked Porter,89
147,90,greenhousedrummer,4,"Not as smoke forward as I like but still an undeniably good beer. It's a bit more on the traditional porter side, with a nice hop bite, caramel sweetness and deep roasted nut aroma. There's a light kiss of smoke but it makes you work for it. Unfortunately, although a good beer, when reaching for a smoky fix I go for O'Fallon's smoked porter, Yazoo Sue, or Aecht Schlenkerla Rauchbier Urbock.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Smoked Porter,89
147,90,Lone_Freighter,4,"It pours a deep dark black yielding a spectacular one inch white foamy head leaving some nice lumpy valleys in the head. The head dies within a minute. The smell is a roasty, dry coffee sort of thing going on with a nice amount of hops allocated inside of some light cocoa. The taste is dry, roasty, bitter and sweet at different times throughout the beer. Some burnt malts seem to come through a bit as the beer warms. The palate is medium to heavy coating my mouth and tongue nicely like it should on a cold winter’s night. Sharpness is slightly there. Overall, I liked it for the most part and would come back to it.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Smoked Porter,89
147,90,lwillitz,4.01,"22-oz bottle into porter/stout glass  I have been sitting on this one for a while and have decided to break it out for my birthday. Excited to try it . . .

147,90,SmokeBeerMinistry,2.18,"The best thing about this smokebeer is that it seems to be the most prevalent in the US. The worst thing is not enough smoke. Another good thing about this beer, $4.99 per bomber. Another bad thing, smokepower taste. Slight maltiness, really slight smokyness, but, I can get this at the corner gas station. Maybe I’ll re-review this beer in the future. Overall score = 5.667 out of 7, which translates to 4 out of 5 for BA, which will then get bumped around again according to what other people think.

147,90,CNoj012,3.82,"This beer pours a dark brown color with amber highlights. There is a dense, 2 finger khaki colored head that lasts the entire beer and leaves fantastic webbed lacing in it's wake.  The smell is not overwhelming, but a very nice mix of chocolate, smokiness, charcoal and a hint of caramel.  Taste is similar. More flavorful than the smell suggests, but also more one dimensional. The smokey flavor really takes over the taste and lingers well into the aftertaste.  Feel is light, almost too light. Very smooth and drinkable with perfect carbonation.  Overall a very good porter.

147,90,SaltofOH,3.84,"Reviewed 2-24-12. (Apologies in advance for the short review; it was from early in my beer rating days). Shaker pint.  A: pours dark black/still translucent - like Coca-cola. Thick sandy head 1/2 inch, settles to sandy ring of lace around the edge of the glass.  S: Smoky. Smells like the [Aecht Schenkerla] rauchbier.  T: Dry; thinner than I expected. Bitterness initially, fades to something strange; tastes like the air freshener at Palmer's beverage smells. Thin overall, but complex.  M: [My memory is that this was on the lighter side of midweight with ample carbonation and a very clean finish.]  O: Decent, but I was really in the mood for a Russian Imperial Stout, and this is definitely not that. (With the benefit of hindsight, my memory is that this was what I would now consider an English style porter; lower ABV, less viscous, not really malty, but heavy on the smoke, roast, bitterness, and in a twist of American ingenuity or corruption, a boatload of floral hops. I think it was the roasted malt/smoke/floral combo that I had trouble with, along with the thin texture. Also, this was before I had tried Ardbeg; would probably like this more now. Worth revisiting now that I have had a half dozen peated single malts and several hundred more beers' experience. Worth trying).",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Smoked Porter,89
147,90,superspak,4.1,"22 ounce bottle into pint glass, best before 8/28/2015. Pours crystal clear deep reddish brown color with a 2 finer dense and fluffy khaki head with great retention, that reduces to a nice cap that lasts. Nice spotty soapy lacing clings down the glass, with a moderate amount of streaming carbonation retaining the head. Aromas of big chocolate, cocoa, caramel, toasted brown bread, wood smoke, herbal, mint, pepper, light coffee/nuttiness, and roast/toasted earthiness. Damn nice aromas with great balance and compelxity of dark/roast/smoked malt and light-moderate earthy hop notes; with great strength. Taste of big chocolate, cocoa, caramel, toasted brown bread, wood smoke, herbal, mint, pepper, light coffee/nuttiness, and roast/toasted earthiness. Light-moderate herbal/spicy hop and light roasted bitterness on the finish; with lingering notes of chocolate, cocoa, caramel, toasted brown bread, wood smoke, herbal, mint, pepper, and roast/toasted earthiness on the finish for a good bit. Damn nice complexity, robustness, and balance of dark/roast/smoked malt and light-moderate earthy hop flavors; with a great malt/bitterness balance and zero cloying flavors after the finish. Light dryness from bitterness, increasing through the glass. Medium carbonation and body; with a very smooth, creamy, and lightly sticky/chalky balanced mouthfeel that is great. Zero warming alcohol as expected of 5.9%. Overall this is an excellent smoked American porter style. All around great complexity, robustness, and balance of dark/roast/smoked malt and light-moderate earthy hop flavors; very smooth and easy to drink. It’s unfortunate that this one is being retired this year, but at least the homebrew recipe will always be available. A very enjoyable offering.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Smoked Porter,89
147,90,rodbeermunch,4,"A deep brown pour with a tan head, 1/2"". Aroma goes roast heavy, minor smoke, usual Stone Chinook hops.  Taste is a porter similar to Sierra Nevada and Black Butte, its plenty hoppy, I probably should have mentioned Alaskan Smoked Porter as well. Its in that vein. Hoppy, ample roasted malt porters from the West. Always consistent. Never had a bad bottle of this. The variants are pretty good too, especially vanilla melds well with this roasty gem.  Bomber format I could do without.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Smoked Porter,89

147,90,JJKBeerLvr,4.02,"Sampled July 2016 from bottle in pint glass. Drank it about 4 months after the bottled date on the bottle.  Appearance: Very dark color, dark tan head that lasted average length of time.  Smell: Sweet with strong toasted coffee aromas, also some hops. Strong caramel aroma as well.  Taste: Full-bodied with nice balance of malt and hops and alcohol. Dominated by coffee and burnt malt flavors, but with some bitterness and kick from the hops. There is also a very little sweet flavor like chocolate. Overall a nice combination and a great taste.  Mouthfeel: Full-bodied, but very smooth.  Overall: Nice porter. Best if you enjoy a combination strong malts, alcohol, and some bitterness from the hops. Great aftertaste of hops. I recommend this porter.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Smoked Porter,89
147,90,Harrison8,4.03,"Pours black with a thick (3 cm) khaki head. Great retention and good lacing left behind. Starting off well. Aroma is smoking, which is strange, but done well. It smells like you're walking into a smoking BBQ joint. Other notes in the aroma include roasted and toasted malts and cocoa nibs. The flavor profile is dark, with roasted and toasted malts under a billow of smoky notes. A little accent of chocolate and cocoa nibs helps this beer round out well. Mouth feel is velvety, and otherwise smooth. It has a medium-thick consistency. Overall, it's a well put together beer that really showcases the smoked beer category.  Served in a 12oz snifter.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Smoked Porter,89
147,90,DefenCorps,4.17,"Bottle from ABV  A very dark brown with a dense, light brown head with good retention and gorgeous sheets of lacing, this looks pretty spectacular. The nose is a great blend of smoke, vanilla, roast, coffee, cocoa and a mild hop character. The smoke is a little wet and fruity. The palate opens smoky before a blend of vanilla, cocoa, coffee grounds and a mild fruitiness (cherry wood? apple?) . The roasted malt flavor is heavier on the coffee grounds/chicory flavors. Drying, roasty and with a little cocoa on the finish, this beer is light in body, moderately carbonated and has a nice finish. Quite excellent, i like this more than the variants Stone came up with way back when.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Smoked Porter,89
147,90,Bierliebhaber3,4.43,"This classic smoked porter pours a pitch black color with a small to moderate tan head. The smell is fairly malty and smoky, though not as smoky as say a rauchbier. There is a very nice, solid, but not at all overwhelming smoke flavor that combines well with the molasses and dark chocolate flavors of the malts. This is a pretty full bodied porter, which I am definitely into, but it is still smooth and has a nice clean finish. The finish is slightly bitter, which enhances the dark chocolate flavor. This is an excellent smoked porter and it upholds the high standards of Stone as much as any of their other beers in my opinion. This kind of robust porter isn’t for everyone, but personally I think it is one of the best at least as far as the smoked variety goes.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Smoked Porter,89
147,90,Gajo74,4.04,"I read a thread on BA that this one was going to be retired. I then noticed it by chance at Outlet Liquors in Rehoboth, DE sometime in May. Although the enjoy by date was listed as 2/29, I nevertheless bought it with the idea that I might see it again. I finally got around to drinking it tonight. Wish I could try it ""fresh"", however, I still though it was good. It poured a dark brown and mahogany with a nice fluffy and foamy head. The lace is patchy, ring like, frothy and sticky. A good looking brew. The aroma reminds me mostly of sweet chocolate, roasted malt and light coffee. Some of this sweetness is felt in the tongue but only vaguely, as a moderate but bold bitterness predominates. This bitterness comes from an espresso, burnt malts and assertive hops presence. The smoky quality is mostly felt in the finish and leaves a dry and bitter aftertaste. This one grows on you by the sip. As it warms, it mellows out a bit. The mouthfeel is fluffy, creamy, velvety and smooth. Full in the mouth but not quite robust, just enough to be drinkable. I hope to find this one again and if possible, find a fresher version to compare.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Smoked Porter,89
147,90,johnnyd10vt,4.25,"Amazing complex. Not like anything I've ever had before. Stout black with a light lacey head that disappears pretty quickly. The smell is very subtle considering how flavor packed it is. On my first taste I was blown away by how smoky it was, but by my 3rd taste I could hardly taste it anymore. Deliciously malty with relatively subtle hops. The smoke comes through on the back of your tongue on the aftertaste where you would normally get the hops. Delightful beer. Would definitely have again.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Smoked Porter,89
147,90,steved5500,3.49,"I was hoping for much more in the way of Porter flavor. This one came through rather limp-wristed and I am a bit disappointed.

Smells like dark roasted malts, dark fruit, dark chocolate, caramel, coffee, mild smoke, with grassy pine. Tastes dark and smoky with roasted coffee, dark fruits, dark baker's chocolate, caramel, roasted malt, piney grass, with an earthy woody dry finish.

147,90,microbrewlover,4.24,"This brew pours a solid black with a little purple when held up to the light. There is a small mocha colored head some of which sticks around until the end as a collar. Moderate lacing.  The smell is loaded with cocoa powder, chocolate, bready malts, banana as well as brown sugar and a little vanilla. Maybe some plums and dates too.   The taste follows the nose with the bread, chocolate, banana and sugar all forward. The finish is full of smoke, this brew really delivers on the smoke. The feel is silky smooth with on aftertaste. Lightly hopped. Slightly warming but no boozy taste leaks through. This is a great beer for this unusually cold and windy Spring day.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Smoked Porter,89
147,90,HappyGuy12345,4.58,"Sampled from a tulip glass in the San Diego Airport (Stone Brewing in Terminal 2) Appearance: Essentially black in color with 1.5 fingers of head Smell: Subtle aroma of chocolate and coffee. However, I didn't pick up much of the smokiness as some other reviewers have. Taste: Definite hints of roasted malt and chocolate. No unpleasant aftertaste. Very subtle hint of smokey flavor. There was some mild bitterness, but not nearly enough to be unpalatable. Mouthfeel: Extremely smooth and creamy beer going down. Moderate carbonation. Medium-to-full bodied beer.

147,90,jmasher85,4.01,"I'm glad I read the review by @biegaman below before writing, as he has straightened out my expectations for this beer. I was expecting a mindblowingly flavorful rauchbier-style porter - something smokey, rich, and hearty. That's only partly what I received, but also not what I should have anticipated.  The smokey flavor isn't at the forefront of the palate or nose, but more in the finish and aftertaste. Closer to the front end is the classic porter notes - toasted barley, a bit of coffee, and an earthy sort of bitterness. Well balanced, this beer isn't too sweet or rich, but very smooth and easy to drink. It's got a medium body and head for days - seriously, it stuck to my mustache for about 5 minutes without me noticing.  If you're expecting a smokey beer, look elsewhere. If you want a smooth, flavorful (but not overpowering) porter with a respectable ABV that goes well with rich foods, cold weather, and good company in the living room (beef stew and my girlfriend on a 35 degree day in my case), this is a good, reasonably priced and easily accessible option.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Smoked Porter,89

147,90,Cramshawbar,3.75,"I always enjoy a lovely smoked porter, although no one does it like Ölvisholt Brugghús with their Lava. Here again, we only have an attempt for a winner. Too light, too watery, too dry and too bitter for an ideal smoked beer. The nose is kind of a give away already. Not bad, but doesn't reach the required standards and for its quality, way overpriced.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Smoked Porter,89
147,90,Chris_r2112,4.25,"Appearance: Black, but not quite as opaque as some other porters. A little bit of light sneaks through at the bottom of the glass. Poured about a finger of somewhat creamy head. Leaves beautiful lacing on the glass. A very attractive beer.  Smell: Heavy French vanilla on the forefront. Chocolate, prunes, slight smokiness on the back end, but not as pronounced as I thought. I may not have even noticed it if I weren't looking for it. Smells absolutely lovely.  Taste: Boy, I wish this one was available more often where I am in Canada. Strong, bitter black coffee notes on the forefront. The vanilla that I smelled is almost entirely gone. Dark chocolate in there, and I'm getting a surprisingly piny hop character on the back end. Smokiness lingers within the bitterness, but is not very heavy. Very complex, very strong, everything you want in a porter.  Feel: Medium feel, medium carbonation. Slightly sticky. Slightly creamy.  A very well done porter. Smoked porter is strong, bitter, and complex, but most important of all it is extremely tasty. Will definitely pick this one up again if I'm lucky enough to see it in an LCBO.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Smoked Porter,89
147,90,biegaman,4.14,"Not all dark beers are black and opaque. Stone Smoked Porter may look intimidating from a distance but closer inspection reveals that it's closer in appearance to tea than coffee; stripes of earl grey colouring highlight small bands of transparency that expose the beer for actually having a fairly clear complexion.  The English porter is a beautiful thing to smell - especially when it's done by Americans. This aroma has the sooty, lightly smoky, roasted grain and coffee notes characteristic of the style but with a hint of earthy-green vinous hops as well (Mt. Hood and Magnum). It's got a pretty strong bark for a beer's that's bite fails to top 5% alcohol (5.9%) and barely exceeds 50 IBU.  With Rauchbiers smoke is by definition the number one component. This isn't up for debate. Smoked Porters, on the other hand, this is not necessarily the case. It's not uncommon for smoke to be the second or third flavour noted. In this example it's even further down the ladder - chocolate, vanilla beans, coffee and roasted grain all place well ahead of the smoke, which is actually tame as an old family dog.  I've met many people that claimed not to like smoked beers but admittedly like Stone's Smoked Porter. There's good reason - not only is the smoky element extremely subtle and well-integrated, the source of ""smoke"" is peated malt instead of beechwood-smoked. This means there's no sausage, bacon or cured meat flavours to put anybody off. By the same hand, there's nothing notably briny or scotch-like either.  No sir, this here is simply a delectable, hearty, satisfying porter. As stated, you can expect fudgy chocolate and the kind of truffles you'd see window shopping in Paris or Brussels. There's also a maltiness reminiscent of a loose leaf oolong tea, perhaps sweetened just a little with some chestnut or other dark honey. And a big splash of Americano is added to enhance the already dark roast of the grain.  Those who've read enough of my reviews may have realized I have a thing for fireplaces - this is what living in a cold-climate will do to you. And while I've mentioned many candidates suited to cozy, contemplative fireside quaffing, Stone Smoked Porter has long been a favourite.  Rightfully so, this classic celebrates its 20th birthday this year. That's an accolade for the brewery, sure, who were among the first to offer not only a smoked porter but Double IPA, Barleywine, Imperial Stout, American Strong Ale and others. But it's also a testament to the enduring appeal of this recipe even despite newer, bolder offerings consistently coming to market. Try it if you haven't already.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Smoked Porter,89
147,90,thehyperduck,3.91,"Bomber picked up from the LCBO; bottled Oct 1 2015 and served at cellar temperature.  Pours a deep-hued, translucent chestnut-brown colour with crimson highlights. A full two fingers of light beige-tinged head is situated atop, remaining in place for the long haul. It takes more than 10 minutes to seep away, leaving behind a creamier, more manageable-sized cap and gobs of lovely lacing. Subtly smoky/peaty aroma, with notes of nutty, lightly toasted malts and milk chocolate. Perhaps a few suggestions of molasses, licorice and earthy, herbal hops.  The flavour profile pretty much follows the nose; minimal sweetness, save perhaps a touch of burnt sugar, with the roasted malt elements played up. Peat smoke is a persistent, subtle presence that permeates the whole sip. Chocolate, toasted hazelnut and hints of dark fruit become noticeable by mid-sip, with some earthy, resiny hop astringency rising in intensity as you near the finish. Bittersweet aftertaste with baker's chocolate, lingering roastiness and some woodsmoke flavour. Low carbonation levels, with light-medium body and a soft, smooth, generally satisfying feel in the mouth.  Final Grade: 3.91, a B+. Stone's Smoked Porter is worth a shot, but don't expect miracles. The smoked malt is not overdone, making it potentially good as an introduction to this sort of brew. I'm enjoying it, but not to the extent that I would consider this a memorable beer, or a 'must-try' or anything like that. It's pretty good, and I'd certainly give it a shot if I spotted it on tap somewhere, but it's not something I expect to return to frequently.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Smoked Porter,89
147,90,Marius,4.25,"Dark brown pour with a fine tan head. Smells like dark cherries, roasted grains, a bit of whiskey, peat, smoke. The taste is bitter, with notes of peat, smoke, dark cherries and dark chocolate. Silky smooth texture with medium body and a bitter and smoky aftertaste. LE: when the beer gets warmer, one can identify other notes: funky sour notes in the nose, together with caramel, and the taste also contains notes of caramel and a bit of vanilla. Pretty complex beer.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Smoked Porter,89
147,90,cjgiant,4.11,"Bottle dated 11/17/15: Pours a lovely mahogany that appears decently clear near the edges. Tan head, fluffy, caps the beer for the whole pour. Lacing is quite nice.  Nose has a light bit of smoke atop a basic porter nose of toasted bread and some roasted malt notes.  Taste leans more porter for me, but a nice porter. The smoke is quite light and acts more like an accent initially. Typically pronounced bitterness, earthy to grassy back up the porter base. With a little warmthand looking for it, I get more smoke, but not much more than I get from some strong stout roasted malts. As the beer starts to get to the edge of being too warm for the porter, the smoke comes out a little more.  Medium body, but with a little friction on the tongue as I sip it.  A solid porter as a base makes it hard to rate this beer low. I wish the smoke took on a bit more of the flavor profile. The smoke was noticeable, but not flavorful, to me, almost like the beer was brewed next to a fire instead of as a part of it.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Smoked Porter,89

Thick white/off-white head that dissipates slow, leaves slight lacing.  S - Ash, smoke, leather, burnt chocolate/coffee.  T - Roasted/burnt malts, coffee, a very woody aftertaste that's probably the ""smoked"" aspect. Not getting any fruit or maltiness to balance out the strong bitter bite this has throughout.  F - Smooth and creamy, very soft carbonation. The intense flavor notes clash with the smoothness.  O - For my third-ever porter, I probably shouldn't have thought of ""smoked"" as universally appealing as ""smoked ham"" or ""smoked almonds."" ""Smoked"" beer is a bit too strong, woody, almost like drinking the contents of a chimney.

The rest is roasty malt, chocolate. Flavor is mostly the porter notes: chocolate, roast, faint caramel, dark fruit even, with an afterthought of the smoke. Hops are significant for most of it, providing moderate bitterness (high for the style), and the finish also contains unexpected chalky yeast. Very dry throughout. Medium body, slick, with forceful but not overpowering carbonation. Meh. The porter part was good, minus the strong bitterness, but I'm especially embittered by the lack of smoke.

147,90,Dravin,4.2,"Poured from a 0.5 L bottle into a Duvel Tulip. Bottled on date is 10/19/2015.  Look -- One finger of medium-tight light tan head. It has decent head retention, it doesn't impress and it doesn't disappoint. Nice lacing with a deep dark ruby color at the edges of the glass.  Smell -- Chocolate and sweetness, some herbal hoppiness beneath it all mingled with teasing scents of smoke. The scent of smoke is fairly light.  Taste -- Bracing bitterness that gives way to chocolate and sweetness and then reappears to linger. Light smokiness worms it's way throughout the taste. The smoke and chocolate aspects make me think of munching on chocolate around a campfire between rounds of making smores.  Feel -- Nice carbonation and medium body on the palate. Definitely reads as a porter to me. Finishes somewhat dry but it isn't cutting and it simply encourages you to go back in for another sip.  Overall -- Initially I was disappointed that the smoke wasn't aggressive but as I got into the beer I appreciated just how well balanced the smoke element is. My only possible complaint with the smoke is I wish it was a little more present on the nose but that may be a failing of my own sniffer and it may not be possible to make it more aggressive on the nose without ruining the balance on the tongue.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Smoked Porter,89

147,90,SitkaSteve,3.69,"This was poured into a nonic pint glass. The appearance was a dark brown color with a one finger white to off white foamy head that dissipated at a nice pace leaving some messy foamy lacing all around the glass. The smell has a light ashy to meaty smokiness to it in the front. After a bit of warming, then there's some subtle roast weaving into the rest of the blend, nice. The taste was moderately smoky with the roast gently settling back in underneath with a warming subtle sweetness (cocoa bean?, I'm guessing). The aftertaste was really nice as it took the smoke along with the roast and allowed the sweetness to enter in. Gentle dry finish. The mouthfeel was about medium bodied and felt like it had more roast than smoke on my tongue, not bad, but wasn't expecting that, different. Overall, for the most part as someone who used to live in Southeast Alaska, ahem, uh..yeah, when you get the choice of this or Alaskan Smoked Porter, I'm gonna stick with Alaskan's. Sorry, Stone, its still good for the most part.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Smoked Porter,89

147,90,Chris_Huston,2.35,"I normally like just about any beer much better between 60 and 70 degrees F. I had to get this one down to between 40 and 45 to get any kind of a decent taste from it. At the warmer temp it smelled of burnt manure, with a similar taste. Even at a colder temp it immediately put me in mind of the huge, open plan barns filled with farm animals at the 4-H events I went to as a kid. Might be a nice base as a farmhouse ale (a la Mad Meg), but as a smoked porter, it was a little disgusting, even if a bit nostalgic. I'm thinking it was an off bottle, b/c the Vanilla Bean version had a fantastic smoke presence, pitched just right so as to be clear and upfront without being overwhelming.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Smoked Porter,89

Let's give it a go anyways.  Appearance - Dark, dark chestnut brown, practically blots out all light. Nice finger and change of tan head that recedes slowly and leaves behind a plethora of gorgeous lacing.  Smell - A lot of burnt malt notes, some firewood and a dank earthiness dominate the aromas.No sweetness to be found anywhere.  Taste - Big and bitter, burnt malt, with earthy flavors throughout. Tastes like burnt wood, but in a good way. The smoke is present, but comes through more with and ashy, wooden flavor. Charcoal is the overall profile that comes to mind. A tiny bit of dark chocolate on the aftertaste. I think the smoke is too prevalent but did enjoy it for what it is.  Mouthfeel - Smooth and surprisingly light bodied, with soft carbonation. Still feels a little heavier because of the profiles, but good feel.  Overall - An enjoyable smoked porter, with big smokey flavors, with the taste of wood and a generally ashy bitterness. Definitely worth a try especially for those that like smoked beers, rauchbiers etc.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Smoked Porter,89

147,90,Czequershuus,4.51,"This beer pours a simple black with a satisfyingly thick head. The aroma presents hickory smoke, tobacco, cedar, coffee, and burning gasoline, though not in an unpleasant way. Indeed, I love the slightly mechanical hint to this beer. I also get a touch of roasted hazelnut on the nose, this one grows as the beer warms. The taste leads with a sweet coffee flavor, followed by hickory smoke, the kind you get from eating really good smoked barbecue. The motuhfeel isa bit thin, but maybe that is for the best given the heavy quality of the beer. Overall I adore this beer.

This is roasted malt heavy at the front with flashes of cocoa and coffee. The smokiness hits you towards the finish and isn't unpleasant. This is a big flavor kind of beer, and like most of the good stuff it becomes more complex and rich as it warms.  O: A very cool beer from Stone.

Aroma: a soft, milky whisp of lactic activity; some chocolate, licorice and some citric hops, the usual Stone calling card.... Palate: smooth, sensibly sippable; medium-bodied, creamy and softly carbonated; a drinkable porter... .Taste: milky, chocolaty, but rather subdued in its profile, almost apologetic in its assertiveness; a malty finish ensures a pleasant, roasted profile...Overall: A smooth, mildly flavorful example of the style--not nearly as prolific as the bottle’s script proclaims...a welcome but unworthy follow-up to the Founders Breakfast Stout...",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Smoked Porter,89

I bought it when I first got serious about reviewing and I have no idea why it's taken this long to do so.  Appearance: Dark brown body with about half a finger of sudsy tan foam that has dissipated leaving lacing.  Aroma: Quite clean. Some cream and hints of woody smoke. I would think the smokey flavor, if any is left, would be very mild by now.  Taste: If I didn't know this was as old a bottle as it is, I probably wouldn't guess it. Let's talk hops first: they are quite aggressive. The first thing I notice is a building bitterness that hits its peak during the finish. There really isn't much for hop flavor but the character is all clean bitterness. The malt takes a back seat until the aftertaste when flavors of roasted barley and cream take over. The smoked malt flavor comes through at the beginning of each sip and then again in the aftertaste, but it is subtle. Nice depth of flavor for 5.9% ABV.  Mouthfeel: Between thin and medium in body, which is lighter than expected. The carbonation is a little overdone. Good drinkability for the style.  Final Thoughts: I was pretty nervous cracking this bomber open but the beer inside has aged well. Would I drink it again? Sure, next time I won't let it age.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Smoked Porter,89

147,90,CHickman,4.11,"Pours very dark brown which almost seems black color with a foamy 1-2 finger dark tan head that was full of bubbles and faded on the slower side, leaving very good lacing and rings as it went down.  Smells of smoked malt, charcoal and burning campfire wood up front, with burnt coffee, woody notes, cocoa powder, light peat moss, light vanilla or caramel, and just of whiff of floral hops. It is very smoky but somehow a sweetness manages to sneak through like the hops released some citrus fruit and the smoked malt let out some s’mores notes. All in all a very nice smoky nose.  As smoky as the aroma was, the flavor is more burnt malt and coffee, with nice chocolate, toffee, cocoa and smoky sweetness that has a sharp bitterness that seems as much piney or citrus hops as it does smoked malts. Along with the smoked malts/grains comes some herbal notes, grassy hops, light fruit, coffee beans (maybe even vanilla beans), syrup and faint licorice. It is not too smoky like drinking a campfire, it's nice and complex considering that it’s so malt dominant. In a role reversal the hops give the malt a nice backbone, and this is as tasty as I remember it from a few years back.  Mouthfeel is velvety smooth, with a light and almost watery flow that has a medium/lightly chewy body, light carbonation and an ashy bitter aftertaste that is smoky and full of coffee and cocoa powder notes. The finish is close to clean, but leave the smoky flavor lingering like a good cigar.

Despite the dark color, the clarity is amazing. Awesome!  Smell - Malty. Smokey (no surprise there).  Taste - Big malt. Smokey (again, no surprise).

As if all that weren't enough, the hops are also vying for your attention.  Mouth - Oily. Slick.  Overall - In the past, I've been a little biased against Stone ales (some of their ales are overly hoppy and their marketing campaign is a little obnoxious). Smoked Porter, however, is a winner. What's most impressive about this beer is that, despite the big flavor, it's still relatively smooth (as a fine Porter should be).

147,90,JohnnyI,4.08,"At first glance this beer is black and foreboding. A closer examination shows it's really a deep, dark brown with some underlying crimson. The head is a frothy off-white finger of foam that stuck around for a good while. In time, some splotchy lacing remains, as well as a thin cream coating on the surface. A classic porter profile marries with smoke to create an interesting metallic aroma. Reminiscent of a burnt bread slice from the toaster. Faint chocolate notes and trace hops are present too. Very earthy. The flavor is a tasty mix of roast and sweet dark chocolate. There's a nice bitter kick in the finish with a distinct smokiness that lingers. You can almost breathe it in. The texture of the brew is pretty average. Medium mouthfeel with lively but controlled carbonation. Just right. Not overly complex, or potent, but discernible as a porter or light stout with some added flair. It leans toward the bitter, dry end of the spectrum, but never approaches puckering or unpleasant. I've had other porters that are silkier and more balanced, but this delivers in all the right ways for a smoked beer. Quite delicious.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Smoked Porter,89

147,90,tillmac62,4.14,"EBD 7/17/14. Clear dark amber pour (similar to Coke) with a nice garnet note. Normal head and retention very good lacing. Nice complex nose of chocolate, light roast with toffee/coffee notes, a very subtle hint of dark fruit and a light smoky character that becomes pronounced as it warms. Light medium bodied with an almost smooth texture. Good carbonation with a bit of effervescence on the finish and in the middle. The flavor profile is quite nice, balanced - with a smoky skew - and complex. It begins with roast, then fades into a light chocolate sweetness. The middle effervesces into a burst of smoke and light hops over a well balanced bitterness. As it flows into the finish, hints of dark fruit emerge. The finish leaves you with a nice smoky aftertaste that lingers over hints of bitter dark chocolate.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Smoked Porter,89

147,90,risendragon,4.07,"Bought from Market Basket. I've had this before but not ever had the chance to review it. I will say, it goes well in a beef stew, gives it a sweet deep flavor with a hint of smoke.  A- Deep mahogany, almost red wine deep (4.25)  S- Chocolate covered cherries are the first smell I get followed by a whiff of smoke and dark chocolate. Not as much smoke as I remember though and it does have a bitter aftertaste that's not as appealing as it would seem (3.75).  T- I get coffee, dark chocolate, and a faint smoke wafting in the background. It also has a dark fruit flavor that's kind of unique. Not as smoky as I remember though (3.75).  M- Porter smooth, no complaints here! (4.5)  O- One of the better porters I've had, the smoke adds a bit of complexity but I remember it being more assertive in that department. Overall, I like it. Maybe drinking it at more of a room temperature would be better as I drank this one slightly chilled (4.07 average).",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Smoked Porter,89

The beer has an amazing cling as well that makes the drink look like time has come to a standstill within the glass. Aroma: The malts really come through but do not hit me with as smokey a flavor as I imagined. In the malts I get a woodsy flavor with some very small notes of coffee and milk. Taste: That smoked flavor I was looking for in the aroma I absolutely find in the flavor. As the beer warms, it really hits me on the top of my mouth and the back sides of my tongue. The finish is medium strong coffee. Mouthfeel: Medium light to medium body. Moderate carbonation. The beer is very wet and smooth when cool but as it warms really develops to a roasted dryness.

147,90,Haydn-Juby,3.97,"A: A deep brown with ruby red highlights coming through in the light. One finger of head. Died too quickly IMO and left minimal lacing when it was around.  S: toffee, caramel, some dark fruit and an ashy (not in a bad way) roasty element as well.  T: Didn't get much of the smoke element as advertised and much less a peat flavor but that's okay. Toffee and caramel malt are pretty present taking the forefront of the beer. Almost equally chocolate and darker malt appear. Dark fruit , no so much in an ester sense, but more of like a dark caramelized plum and more malty then anything. Hop bitterness is less then I would have expected and is balanced nicely.  M: Thin honestly, way to thin for a porter. This seems to make the carbonation ""bristly"" and prickly a touch which is something that should never appear in a quality porter.  O: This was a great beer overall. No peat and this is really not a single malt in a pint glass but it does a good job at being very drinkable, flavorful, and remaining interesting to the palate throughout the experience.

S: Roasted malt, with undertones of smoke and chocolate/caramel. Fairly hoppy and bitter for a porter, but it works reasonably well.  T: Roasted dark malt dominates, subtle dark fruit flavors, and a lingering smoke flavor. Was really expecting a deeper, more complex taste.  M:Moderate carbonation, fairly thin for a bigger porter (was expecting something more from Stone). Smooth up front, smooth in the middle, and a bitter finish.  O: As a porter alone, it is fine enough...tasty in its own right, but not something I would reach for over Founders/Great Lakes/Deschutes. As a ""smoked"" porter? I am left underwhelmed.

The appearance of this brew was fascinating... a deep black at the top of the glass, with a rich, translucent scarlet around the bottom of the glass. About a finger of a tan head which dissipated quickly. The aroma was overpowered by smoke, with some deep malt coming through as well. Taste was again overpopwered by smoke, with some dark fruit and malt undertones. Mouthfeel was smooth and enjoyable. Though this was definitely overpowered by the smoke (duh asshole, it is called smoked porter...), it chilled out as the glass warmed. Though it is somewhat like drinking a porter in a smoky room, at least it was more like yummy smoking meat smoke, as opposed to smoky bar smoke. Probably won't seek it out, yet intrigued by the chile pepper and vanilla variants. Worth a try if you like your beers dark.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Smoked Porter,89

Only one finger of tawny head that quickly settles to a thin cap from an aggressive pour. Deep dark brown color that will let strong light through. I can see lots of floaties in the glass. Moderate lacing that less than expected. Looks scrumptious.  S: Strong peat , so strong that I'm having a hard time getting to the other aromas. Wood smoke, cocoa, milk chocolate, and some vanilla. Sweet and inviting. Smells like sitting around a fireplace, inside of an old cabin, in the forest, at Xmas time. I'm not getting the coffee that most other reviewers noted. A hint of dark fruits.  T: Once again strong peat that encompasses wood smoke and dark chocolate. Not nearly as sweet as it smells. No fruits to speak of. Strong charcoal. Reminds me of Irish Dry Stout, specifically Guinness Extra Stout. Starts bittersweet and quickly leads to a strong, drying bitterness that lasts well after swallowing.  M: Carbonation is perfectly moderate with a tight feel. Creamy. Tea-like drying is strong. Substantialness is spot-on.  O: Mind = Blown",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Smoked Porter,89

Swirling gives it more character  Taste: Smoked malts hit you up front, then fades into chocolate and a hint of hops.  Mouthfeel: Medium body, but light for the style. Smooth with a moderately bitter finish  Overall: My first smoked porter and I enjoyed it. Rich flavor for the style, and the price is right. As with most well made beers, more flavor came out the warmer it got. The finish was perhaps too bitter for my liking. Although good, it's not great, and falls short of being top tier for me.

This offering pours a very near black color with a thick tan head that quickly dissipates and leaves a nice film and lacing. The nose is robust and roasty. Lots of coffee, dried fruits, leather, and a slight smoky quality. Not as abrasive as in some smoked beers. The flavor confirms the nose. Smooth and rich and roasty. Coffee, vanilla, and chocolate abound and are accented by the slight smokiness. Mouthfeel is rich and luxurious; almost more stout like than porter. This is an excellent beer.

Initially a bit of chocolate but then the smoky roast flavors and a slightly bitter finish but in a very good and balanced way. Very flavor full but not overwhelming, the flavor contrasts are something else.  Let me tell you these STONE BOYS don't mess around and not just because I'm a CALI native.

147,90,SFNC,4.03,"Poured reddish brown into a cut pint glass. A nice head piled up quickly, then disappeared just as quickly with some decent lacing. The smoke was not overt, but was there like a distant fire. Coffee, chocolate, dark fruit and shoe polish dominated the scent. The taste was complex and shifting from sip to sip, slightly sweet at first, then bittering on the swallow, with again a light impression of smoke on the backside. I'd say this has more carbonation than most Porters, but this is not a detriment at all. Overall a great porter, if not a very smokey one, I'm impressed that I'm noticing nuances several sips in.

147,90,LuvLagunitas,4.27,"A: Dark, dark brown with a slight red tint when held to the light. Opaque would definitely describe this one. Small off-white head. Seemingly no carbonation. Looks good.  S: Deep smokey earthiness. Almost like the peat character to scotch ale. Almost sweet, but not in a malty way. A touch of booze backs it up with a subtle spicy note. Not overly complex, but spot-on.  T: Earthy and smoky upfront supported by a solid roasted backbone. There are hints of coffee, dark chocolate, and a touch of hops. The hops are aren't too strong but add a hint bitterness that compliments the roast nicely.  M: This one has a smooth medium-body feel. You wouldn't guess it from looking at it, but it has a good amount of carbonation that fizzes the tongue.  O: This to me is what a smoked porter should be. Robust porters aren't usually my thing, but this one was quite tasty and well balanced. Would definitely get this again, and I recommend trying it, strongly.

Finished smoky.  Mouthfeel: Balanced. Enough carbonation to stimulate a slight zing. Dry finish that work very well for this beer.  Overall: One of the best porter's I have had.

147,90,artoolemomo,3.65,"Appearance- Pours up an okay amount of head which looks to have decent retention. The head is a light beige while the body is a mix of deep maroon and medium dark chocolate brown that shows a lot of crimson in the light. Considerable lacing is left behind.  Nose- Lacks presence but has some complexity- semi-sweet chocolate with faint hints of roast, nuts, and smoke. Some dark fruits- notably cherries and raisins. Swirling reveal a good amount of coffee with a slight sour note. I certainly wish there was more smoke.  Taste- The front starts off sweet with a blend of semi-sweet chocolate and dark fruits- once again, cherries and raisins. The roasted notes build and express some nuttiness and coffee. Maybe a little bit of wood and smoke around the edges that suggest (to my mind) leather and tobacco. These are definitely not prominent and perhaps not even present but the light wood and smoke notes make me think of them. Much less smoke than I would prefer- chocolate, cocoa, and coffee are the dominant themes. A slight mint note mixed with licorice. The dark fruits run a little vinous and remind me of a thin, red wine. Some pine and resin and a bitterness that recalls a faint bit of earwax. Don't really get any caramel though. The hop notes are much more apparent than I would have expected. It's an above average to good beer but I had wanted to like it more than that. Some notes of tomato mixed with the wood and slight smoke give it a slight barbecue profile. Closer to good than above average.  Mouthfeel- Almost medium bodied with an appropriate amount of carbonation, slight zing. A bit of a dry finish.  Drinkability- Fairly easygoing but a little disappointing in regard to the minor smoke. It seems rauchbiers may have ruined other smoked beers for me. This may be a little cheaper than the standard price for Stone bombers. Probably not a repurchase.  Overall- Almost a solid, good beer. Probably would be just that if it met my expectations for the style. It's still worth a try- after all, it is a Stone beer.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Smoked Porter,89

Very smooth mouthfeel, but a little alcohol kick on the way down.  All in all a fantastic beer from Stone. Would go extremely well with BBQ food.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Smoked Porter,89

Poured an awesome 2 finger head. Great lacing.  S- I swear I smell grapes! Also dark chocolate, a touch of coffee, nuts, and soft pine. Grape smell morphed more into raisin as it warmed. Overall, a little on the light side.  T- Sweet up front - almost like light orange meets coffee and caramel. Shifts into mix of caramel, dark chocolate, and smoke, then fades to earthy hop, grapefruit, pine, and burnt wood. A different flavor stands out with each sip.  M- Medium-thick bodied with nice, crisp carbonation. Smooth, lightly viscous, and drying. This is what I wish all Porters felt like.  O- Stone is my favorite brewery for a reason. All four categories are brilliantly crafted and mix together to create one hell of a Porter here. Each sip shifts focus to somewhere else.

147,90,dougbassett,3.77,"One of the ""1001 Beers You Must Taste Before You Die"" -- #42 of the ones I've reviewed here.  Pour is decent but nothing outstanding, although props to the long-lasting head on this. Typical nose of coffee and cocoa, this time with a hint of smoke. The mouthfeel is pretty routine outside of a wonderfully lingering finish of liquid smoke. Tastes in general, though, are the usual hopped up coffee/cocoa, with a slight hint of smoke dancing around in the background.  Good, not great beer. The smoking is distinctive but that's the only distinctive thing about it, without that this is a decent, but bog-standard porter.

The head sticks around and is surrounded by some awesome lacing, and has developed a small mound of larger bubbles towards the center. Light roasted malts, caramel, chocolate and coffee bean come through. Some buttery aromas do come through from time to time. The roasted malts are the first thing you’ll taste, some mild chocolate and caramel follow-no coffee yet. The aftertaste is bitter doesn’t distract from the flavor, and it lingers on for some time after you swallow. The mouthfeel is medium to light-leaning more towards the light side of things.

Quite nice, very on point for a porter. Scents of slight citrus peel, roasted malt, smoked malt, dark chocolate and black coffee. A very good porter aroma with a nice addition of smoke, very nice. Flavors of black coffee, roast malt, cocoa powder and slight smoked malt with slight caramel in the middle and finish. Bitter and roasted aftertaste. Very well done, true to style for a porter with just enough smoked character to add complexity. Mouthfeel is medium-light bodied with low carbonation and a creamy feel. Very good, very much a porter. Overall this is a good porter with a nice layer of complexity added to the aroma and flavor with the addition of smoked malt.

T - Dark coffee mixed with bitter chocolate. There's a sweetness that I can't quite place (caramel?) A definite lingering smokey aftertaste that sticks.  M - A fair amount more carbonation than I expected, making it seem a tad on the lighter side.  O - Another solid beer from Stone. Overall I find the Smoked Porter refreshing.

Nice light tan head, wavy lacing, and even thick geographic lacing that caked the inner walls of my mug, something I have never seen before. Noticed the smokyness at the nose, and strong flavors of dark chocolate, coffee just a twinge of a rasberry. Awesomely a nice blend of hop bitterness with malt sweetness, could not get over the smokyness. A medium or heavier mouth feel.

147,90,Aleks_P,3.79,"Appearance: When it poured I thought it would be transparent/translucent light brown, but ended up much darker, couldn't even tell if it was black or brown once it was in the glass. Two-inch tan foam head, had to wait a bit to top off my pint glass.  Smell: Didn't get much out of the smell, not the strong coffee notes you might get from a porter. Definitely picked up the smokiness, but aroma was not as strong as I expected.  Taste: While there was not much smell in my opinion, there is a lot of flavor. Hard to articulate the flavors because the smokiness is noticeable (in a good way), but pick up some of those coffee, chocolate and malt flavors you'd expect.  Mouthfeel: Pretty carbonated for such a heavy beer, but has a smoothness/creaminess to it. Good balance overall.  Overall: Good job bringing the smokiness in without completely dominating the beer. I've had smoked beers before that just tasted burnt and that wasn't the case here. I did not find this beer overly complex though. Good for the style and interesting but would have liked more noticeable hints of other flavors.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Smoked Porter,89
147,90,Bockrules,4.42,"poured from the bomber into a pint glass  A - Pours a used motor oil black that goes to dark ruby when held to the light. Not much in the way of carbonation rising to the rocky, tan, three finger head. Head stays intact as a creamy cap all the way down the glass. Leaves behind several large splotches of lacing.  S - Smoked chocolate malt upon opening the bottle. In the glass, earthy hops and slightly bitter coffee ground become present.  T - Smoked chocolate malt and coffee grounds upfront. The body is light and moderately sweet with chocolate milk, slight dark fruit and a hint of caramel. Hop bitterness and candied plum dominate as the beer passes over the back of the tongue before a bitter chocolate, plum and black licorice finish.  M - Medium bodied with just enough carbonation to the give beer a rich, creamy body that still seems somewhat light on the tongue - like chocolate mouse. This is one of the best mouth feels I've had in a porter.  Picked a beer out of my collection to pair with my steak and to later review for my 26th birthday - this was a fantastic choice. Stone Smoked Porter does everything very well and the flavor and mouthfeel are phenomenal. This beer isn't a heavy or super rich beer like an imperial stout, rather is the signature chocolate moose of beers with a delicious yet complex flavor profile and a light, creamy mouthfeel. I could drink this beer all night, and am quite disheartened that I've finished off the bomber.

Bottle has an awesomely long explanation of the beer on the back which I am too lazy to read right now, but I appreciate the detail and will come back to it. Smells awesome, malty, nutty, wood smoke, musty tobacco - smells like your weird uncle's cabin in the woods. Flavor is so dark and smoky, adequately hopped, and lightly sweet. Mouthfeel is light to medium, and carbonation is light.

Maybe not for everyone, but I like this beer. Quite a bit.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Smoked Porter,89
147,90,Dreizhen,3.67,"A: Dark, mostly opaque brown with a tinge of amber somewhere in there. Thin head that shrinks into a thin layer but lingers. S: Smoke, malt, slight chocolate and coffee notes. T: A truly smokey porter. In an odd way, this reminds me of Bruichladdich's single malt ""The Rocks,"" which is an unpeated Islay. I've had so many porters and expected rich chocolate and coffee that when I got this and tasted mostly smoke, it was like drinking an Islay without peat (which ironically would make it smokey). Chocolate and coffee are here, but definitely subdued. There's some mahogany lingering in there, too. The bottles recommends pairing it with BBQ'd meats. I concur, wholeheartedly. M: Smooth, moderate carbonation, lingers on the tongue. O: Pretty good. I've had a lot of the Stone beers in different setting that just aren't appropriate for reviewing. This is my first time really sitting down with the Smoked Porter and I'm pretty pleased with it. Not something I'll go for every time I'm at the bottle shop, but I can't think of many better beers for Fall grilling when there's a slight briskness in the air and a good football game on the tube.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Smoked Porter,89
147,90,StoutHunter,3.25,"I picked up a bottle of Stone's Smoked Porter over a month ago for $5.09 at Boyne Country Provisions. I've been wanting to try this beer, but I haven't seen it around in a long time so when i saw a couple bottles on the shelf I made sure to grab one to try, so lets see how it goes. No visible bottling date, so it might be a little old. Poured from a brown 22oz bottle into a snifter.  A- The bottle looks pretty standard for Stone with their typical gargoyle on it, it's not that bad looking. It poured a very dark brown color that bordered on being black and it took on a little bit of a ruby hue around the edges when held to the light with three fingers worth of light mocha colored head that left lots of sticky lacing behind. This is a very good looking beer, the color is on par for the style and the head and lacing were really good.  S- The aroma starts off with a medium amount of sweetness followed by some malts with some dark and roasted malts sticking out the most and there's some nice chocolate and coffee aromas in the background. Up next comes a lighter amount of medium smokey aromas with some caramel and toffee like aromas that stick out much more than I would expect and there's a lighter hop aroma in the background. This beer has a decent aroma, but I wish the roasted malts and smokey aspects stuck out a little more.  T- The taste seems to be fairly similar to the aroma and it starts off with a lower amount of medium sweetness followed by some malts that impart a roasted dark malts and chocolate like taste that quickly gives way to a lighter medium smokey flavor. Up next comes the caramel and toffee flavors that are lighter then they were in the aroma. On the finish there's a pretty high amount of medium bitterness that has a charred like flavor to it along with a lighter hop flavor with a slightly charred malt aftertaste. This was a decent tasting beer but just like the aroma the roast and smoke didn't seem to stick out as much as I would like.  M- Fairly smooth, crisp, thin, watery, fairly dry, on the thicker side of being light bodied with a higher amount of carbonation that was a little prickly. I wasn't a big fan of the mouthfeel, it felt too thin and over carbonated for the style.  Overall I wasn't impressed with this beer and I thought it was a pretty average example of the style, there was nothing about the flavor or aroma that really kept me coming back for more, it wasn't as bold and as aggressive as I expect most beers from Stone to be, so to me it felt a little out of place. This beer had decent drinkability, it was fairly smooth and not filling but the flavor didn't do a good job at holding my attention and I think a glass would be enough for me, a whole bomber is a little too much for me and after one pour it started to wear on me. What I liked the most about this beer was the appearance, I thought it was very good and it's one of the best looking Porter that I've seen in a while. What I liked the least about this beer was the mouthfeel, it was out of place for the style and it just didn't work that well with this beer. I would buy a fresh bottle just to see how different it is but as far as getting a beer just to enjoy and drink I don't think I would get this again, it just doesn't keep me coming back for more. I wouldn't really recommend this beer, it's not really smokey or porter like enough to recommend. All in all I thought this beer was a disappointment, I had high hopes for this one since stone rarely disappoints, but this one just fell flat and it didn't really highlight those porter and smokey flavors and aromas as well as I would like. Better luck next time guys, this beer just didn't do it for me, but I would still like to try the chipotle version of it.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Smoked Porter,89

Sweet & hoppy malts to begin with some touches of chocolate and a slightly smoked taste. Coffee & a bit of bitterness with some peat and roasted malts following this. A very well balanced beer with a nice combination of sweetness and roasted malts with the smoky character the name suggests with some chocolate at the end and some hops too.  Smooth with a medium body and nice balance to go along with the medium carbonation. A slightly rich tasting beer but one that goes down well.

You definitely picks it up more in the flavor than nose. It has a wonderful bitterness on the back.  The mouthfeel is medium to light, being a under 6% porter, much like other porters.

S - Baker's chocolate takes the stage and gives way to exceptionally smokey/roasty malts and finishes with a hint of coffee.  T - Roasty malts and bitter chocolate are the backbone of this beer. More bitter than your average porter. Coffee presence isn't as strong as I'd like but its doable. There's some notes of sweet caramel towards the end and maybe some cherry but it definitely finishes bitter. The bitterness must be a product of the chocolate as there are minimal hops. The smokiness lingers on the palet. The label mentions that it pairs well BBQ'd foods and I can see why.  M - Much drier than I'm used to in a porter but I like it. It took me a few sips to get used to. Full bodied and light carbonation.  O - I have a pretty high bar set for Stone after enjoying some of their other beers. This is an above average porter but it didn't blow me out of the park. It isn't as complex as I'd like - the malts and chocolate steal most of the show.

Lots of bitterness from the chocolate and roasted character. Quite complex. Despite the high IBU level for the style (53), the hop presence seems quite subtle. My only complaint is that the roasted character may go a step to far, bordering on burnt.  M- Mid to mid-full. Perfect carbonation. A little thin. Very dry. Nice drinkability.

147,90,gentlystewed,4.5,"Poured this one into a Samuel Smith Imperial pint glass. The body is dark, like a storm cloud on a moonless night. The head is creamy tan and inviting.  The aroma is dominated by roasted barely malt simmering in high-end coffee. I'm also picking up some not so subtle dark chocolate notes along with wisps of BBQ smoke. Close your eyes, employ a little imagination and your sitting by a campfire, chowing down on s'mores.  This brew has a uncomplicated roasty mocha flavor to it, and trailing along on the back end comes a pretty decent hop bite for a porter.  The mouthfeel is smooth and medium bodied with not much carbonation--which, considering the style, is perfect.  Overall this is a great porter, and it won't be my last.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Smoked Porter,89
147,90,LCB_Hostage,3.92,"Poured from a 22 oz bomber into an imperial pint glass (two pours)  A: Deep coal black with a 3-finger, sturdy tan head and moderate lacing. Same head for the second pour (remainder was refrigerated, open for about 30 minutes from opening to second pour)  S: More of a burnt coffee than ""smoked"" with hints of chocolate and plum. Richly malty and pleasing with minimal hops coming through.  T: Presented as a fairly typical porter on the front end, but the smokiness came on strong in the after-taste. Malty without being sweet, despite the lack of any noticable hops. The smoke gave a very dry, woody finish that lingered long on the tongue. Lighter bodied than the intense aroma would have suggested.  M: The smokiness and a nice level of carbonation gives the tongue a dry tingle. Very smooth and refreshing for a porter. Not at all syrupy.  O: I'm glad I gave this a try. It's not necessarily something I'd work into a regular rotation, but I could definitely see stocking a couple more bombers for when the mood strikes. The clerk where I bought it ""warned"" about the smokiness, but I didn't find it that over-powering at all -- certainly not enough to be off-putting. It fell right in the range I'd expect from a self-proclaimed ""smoked porter.""

Foam shrinks but never disappears, and leaves a nice looking sheet of lace. Aromas of roasted malt, chocolate and cocoa, hidden smokiness. Deep rich flavor of chocolate, roasted malts, again smokiness is understated (as in the smell). Smoke adds to the layers, rather than hitting you over the head like some big rauchbiers I have had. Lots of malt, no a lot of hop, but still balanced and not too sweet. Very smooth but still a full mouthfeel, solid body.

Seems good, not especially unique. Taste: A nice beer, good amount of bitter roast, some chocolate back there too, maybe just a little bit hoppy, but certainly taking a back seat to malts. I don't get much of a smoke character, maybe just a tad pheonlic. I am enjoying this beer. Mouthfeel: Medium mouthfeel. I like this kind of mouthfeel to my porters, they really shouldn't feel so full as a stout would in my opinion. The mouthfeel on this beer is just about perfect.

Not entirely unpleasant, either.  Taste: Surprisingly not as complex or heady as the smell would suggest. Smoked malts, espresso, and bitter chocolate notes dominate.  Mouthfeel: Again, not as chewy as one would expect. Thinner than some porters/stouts, but still leaves a nice aftertaste.  Overall: This might be a good transition for those looking to move into the darker, heavier beers without being overwhelmed from the get-go. It's a fine porter to sip slowly, letting it warm to room temperature and discover more subtle flavors/aromas, or a good one to quaff straightaway.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Smoked Porter,89
147,90,RenaudNW,4.05,"Overall a very nice experience in a Porter. It has a very good appearance with a moderate head and good carbonation. The aroma is what really makes this beer an experience. A nose fulling experience with good complexity and a nice smokiness. In addition, the taste does not disappoint. It is both full flavored and relatively clean. I can drink a full 22oz bottle and never feel like I'm being overwhelmed; very satisfying. The one potential weakness of this brew is the mouth feel. From the initial aroma, one gets the impression that it should be smooth and silky on the tongue. Unfortunately, after the fine initial experience with the aroma and color, the mouth feel comes across as somewhat watery. However, close your eyes and concentrate on the flavor and you won't notice the weak mouth feel after a few sips. Overall about a 4 out of 5. It's good enough that I keep a few bottles in the back of the refrigerator as a regular stand by.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Smoked Porter,89

Smoke and roasted malt pick up the front of the flavor, too. Smoked flavor is the major player here, but it doesn't overpower the substantial malt bill here. Burnt toast is big here. In the background there are subtle coffee and mocha flavors. Finally, there's a bitter edge to bring out the dry finish.

Thankfully, I've been getting into IPAs lately or else I probably wouldn't like this as much. But it just doesn't taste like a smoked porter. Hoppy finish/aftertaste, too.  M- Not too thick or thin.

Cocoa and ash. Vaguely grassy with some corn and earth. It smells like every porter should. Sweet caramelized malts in the back. Smokiness builds a bit as it warms.  Taste: Light smokiness.

Hints of cherries emerge at the end as well.  M - smooth, no alcohol to speak of, a little thin  O - I've held on to this one for some time, not sure what to expect as other smoked beers I've had left some to be desired.

Dark and faintly fruity.  Roasty malts, a touch of smoked grain, and lightly citric hops. Softly malty, with coffee and mocha pulling through. Still maintains some substantial bitterness. The smokiness is a little sweet, like hickory, but not as rich. Sweet in the finish, as well, which makes it an easy 'like'.  Charming mouthfeel. I like the bitterness level on the tongue, because it's still ooey-gooey on the backend. Soft gas promotes a fuller and chewier body. A bomber that never intimidates.  I think this is solid.

147,90,tectactoe,4.32,"Pours a deep mahogany color, mostly black, especially when viewed in dim lighting, some dark ruby highlights around the edges. Super thick and creamy tan head that sustains and leaves some excellent lacing behind, something that seemingly all Stone brews do.  The aroma hits you before you bring the glass to your nose. Roasted, dark malts, some dry cocoa powder, slight char, some leafy, ashy, and dry hop character. The smoke is hard to notice at first, maybe because the beer is a little to cold. Upon warming up a bit, the smoke definitely comes out and becomes quite nice. Liquid smoke, burnt wood, campfire char - it adds such a great element to an already aromatically pleasing beer.  Stone Smoked Porter tastes exactly like the nose would lead you to believe it tastes. Roasted, nearly burnt malts, dry, light cocoa, bitter coffee beans, herbal hops that are just bitter enough to be called ""perfect"", and of course, a helpful heaping of smoke. Just like on the nose, the smoke comes out more and more on the palate as the beer warms up. It goes from being a tertiary flavor to a primary flavor over the course of 15-20 minutes.  Along with the smoked flavors comes the charred woodiness and an even more intense roasted profile that sticks with you through the aftertaste. A delicacy that coats your palate and keeps the flavor in your brain long after it's gone. The body is heavy and creamy, not quite chewy, nice amount of carbonation in this one.  Had this a long time ago, didn't care for it. Had it again recently and loved it. Smoke can be a touchy subject in the world of beer when not left in the most deft of hands (Heller-Trum), but it works perfectly here and isn't anywhere close to overpowering. Plus, only 4-5$ for a bomber? What a steal. One of the best smoked beers I've had to date, for many reasons.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Smoked Porter,89
147,90,jazzyjeff13,3.93,"A 22oz bottle with a BB of 7th Nov 2012, so it's a little out of date. I figured a dark smoked brew wouldn't age too badly. Purchased from Trembling Madness in York a while back, and stored in my garage.  Poured into a Duvel tulip. A very dark reddish-brown hue that appears black unless held to the light. Good carbonation. Produces a vast head of creamy beige foam with superb retention; this slowly subsides to a thick surface layer. Nice lacing. Aroma of rich roasted malt with notes of burnt grain, coffee, chocolate, smoke, mild kippers, molasses, dried fruit, pine resin and earthy yeast. Complex, dry and slightly sweet. The alcohol is well hidden.  Tastes of roasted malt with a mild smoky character and a dry bitter finish. Notes of burnt grain, coffee, molasses, mild smoke, faint chocolate, dried fruit, pine resin and earthy yeast. A subtle sour hint lurks in the background - this occurs with other rauch beers. Complex and somewhat fruity, with a strident bitterness upon swallowing. Mouthfeel is rich, smooth and spicy, with tingly carbonation and good body. Rather astringent - dries the palate. An aftertaste of dark roasted malt, fruitiness, pine and bitter stewed hops.  Tasty - an impressive effort, though it comes across as more subtle than the other Stone beers I've tried. I'm not sure what effect has resulted from allowing it to go past it's BB date; perhaps a reduction in hop aroma? I was expecting it to be smokier - it appears that the brewers held back on the rauch to produce a brew with a well-judged balance between smokiness and traditional dark malt flavours. The hoppy pine notes that define Stone beers are noticible but take a back seat for a change. However, the overall effect is unique; how many other breweries combine smoked malt and hops the way this beer does? A solid brew with a delicious range of flavours - it goes down a treat. Well worth sampling if you have the chance.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Smoked Porter,89

Gives and excellent description of the beer and about the “Stone” philosophy when they decided to brew this beer. Also gives ABV info, a small ingredient list, web info, and a small food pairing suggestion.  Appearance: After warming for 20min I poured this from its 22oz bomber bottle into a 20oz dimpled beer mug. This poured out a deep dark coffee brown with a 3 finger mocha foam head of medium density. Head retention was an amazing 7min 7sec before fading to a thick coating. Phenomenal lacing.  Smell/Aroma: Smells heavy on the smoke with a charred chocolate malt aroma also detectable.  Flavor/Taste: Taste is again very heavy on the smoke and roasted chocolate malts on the front end followed by a smokey licorice bite that is very nice. The finish is full of smoke and a slight hop bitterness with a charred coffee aftertaste.  MouthFeel/Drinkability: Medium bodied with medium carbonation. Very smooth almost velvety mouthfeel.

Smell - The smoke hits immediately and reminds me of a rauchbier. Mostly bonfire, campfire, and a bit of cigarette ash. There is a tad of sweet malts with some hints of roasted coffee.  Taste - Taste is of sweet, roasted malts mixed in with the smoke and herbal hops at the back end. Sweetness and bitterness fight it out in the finish, and the bitterness wins. Actually, the bitterness is getting to me as I continue to drink.  Mouthfeel - Really nice, good medium body with a soft fluffiness. Just like a porter should be; pretty drinkable.

The flavor is more what I had hoped for, with some soft, woody smoke, chocolate, and a bit of spicy, herbal hops for balance.

Pretty lacing, all around a pretty glass of beer.  Smell- Subdued, but definitely a porter. Lacking that caramelized hint in the aroma, not much in the way of smoke smell.  Taste- A good porter battled it out with a ton of wood smoke. I at first didn't think either of them won, but now, near the end of the bottle, I keep thinking I'm at a campfire. The smoke flavor has overwhelmed all but the bitterness of the porter, and my mouth tastes like ashes.  Feel- texture was nice, smooth, but the ashy afterfeel is bad. Not real happy here. Feels like I need a drink to wash away the flavor of the smoke. Hmmm...  Overall... already said it. Just wondering if perhaps it would go better with a particular meal (BBQ? Fried chicken?

147,90,rickyleepotts,2.81,"When deciding what beer we wanted to taste today, Sheryl said, “Try something dark.” So I grabbed a porter. It’s dark! Plus, I have been on a porter kick lately. Last month I was hooked on reds and the month before that IPAs. Next month, maybe I will switch to Belgian beers! Speaking of Stone, we were just in San Diego for Thanksgiving and visited the brewery. I couldn’t be that close and not visit. The brewery was nice, but it wasn’t as big as I thought. I did get to see some of the 12/12/12, and the 11/11/11 that has been aged in red wine barrels. I would rather try that one than the 12/12/12. At any rate, today we are drinking the Stone Smoked Porter. I had the Alaskan Smoked Porter a few weeks ago for the first time. Beer bloggers are raving about the Alaskan Smoked Porter. Not sure why… it was just OK. But the way people talk about this beer, it will be better. Let’s drink, people!  In the Glass: This beer is pitch black in the glass. It has a really nice head, too. A white head that leaves a gorgeous lace on the glass. For a beer that is only $3.99 a bomber, regardless of the ABV, it is worth buying to see/experience this head. I haven’t even tasted it yet and it was worth 4 bucks. Let’s see what it smells like.  Nose: Before I smell this, know that I had a smoked porter last night at Fate Brewing Company here in Scottsdale. They are producing some incredible beers, and their smoked porter is excellent. As it gets close to room temperature, the smokiness really comes out and leaves an aftertaste like I just smoked a cigarette. It is lovely! So the Stone has some tough competition here… and it smells OK. It has more chocolate aroma than it does smokey notes. But that’s OK. I like chocolate, too. I might be picking up some burnt caramel/vanilla notes toward the end there.  Flavor: The flavor is not as big as I expected. Granted, if you look at the price, it fits. But the expectation that I get from Stone is that their beers are “epic” and loaded with flavor. This one is not. It’s decent, don’t get me wrong. But it is not something worth writing home about. The best part of this beer is the aftertaste. Not really getting much smoke on the palate. If I am getting anything, it is dark chocolate notes.  Mouthfeel: What mouthfeel? It sort of just slides across the tongue and is gone. There is not much going on in the mouth here. I expected something thick, fluffy, and something that would have me excited to take a second sip. But this beer, in regards to the mouthfeel, is pretty boring.  Aftertaste: Here we go. The aftertaste. What makes the Fate smoked porter good is the aftertaste. That is what makes this one tolerable. The ABV is pretty low on this, under 6%. But as a porter, I expect something a little thicker with a little more flavor. The aftertaste is where you get the smoke flavors. Still not much flavor, but the aftertaste is still here a few minutes after I swallowed. This is good, but not the best offering from Stone. Sorry guys, but Fate Brewing has you beat on the smoked porter.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Smoked Porter,89

There is 2 1/2 fingers of head that leaves more than a covering over the top of the glass until the end. There is nice, sticky lacing with every sip.  S: Not as much aroma as I expected. Definitely no ""smoke"" smell is noticable. I smell coffee, burnt grains and a slight dark chocolate smell.  T: There you go: dark black coffee and burnt grains big time. It ends with a bitterness and a taste of soy sauce.  M: This is a lot thinner than I expected. Light cabonation and easy to drink, though.  O: I might like this with a bbq.

147,90,rundocrun,3.85,"A - Body is very dark brown, but I am able to see through it when held to the light. A 1/2 finger of off-white foam forms, but fades to a ring around the glass quite quickly. Bubbles float lazily to the top, making this look like a more viscous beer.  S - Smoke is not really a major player in the nose. There are toasted malt and chocolate notes as well as a touch of sharper burnt grains--possibly the smoke coming through.  T - Mildly sweet and sharp dark toasted malts up front. I get a sense of the richer chocolate and caramel malt body as well as the smokiness through the middle. Finish has a sharp bitterness from the hops/roasted grain.

A very well balanced malt profile on this one.  M: Body is on toward the heavier side with a low to moderate amount of carbonation.

Good lacing and medium carbonation.  S: Good roasty character, bitter chocolate and a weird almost Sulfer, rotten egg lime aroma, it's not overpowering but I do get a tiny hint of it, strange but not a deal beaker. Sounds worse than it smells, trust me not bad just hard to describe. Most likely the smoke malt that's contributin to what I'm trying to describe.  T: Very interesting. Dark roasted malt, smokey and almost BBQ like but in a very good way. Man, the tase is awesome actually. Bitter yet smokey, slight chocolatty and dark roastiness.  M: Deep roasted chocolate and bitter smokey notes linger for days makin this really enjoyable, especially as it warms up and the flavors open up even more.  O: A great beer from Stone, a bit weird on the nose but there 100% on the taste and mouthfeel, which is what I enjoy in stouts and porters.

S: Pretty mild smelling; hints of malt, molasses, chocolate, soy sauce.  T: Lingers in your mouth similar to a burnt sugar flavor. This would go well with Korean BBQ. The smoke isn't overwhelming and adds to the complex, unusually dry flavor profile. This porter goes from sweet to bitter the longer it stays in your mouth.  M: Not much head. Light carbonation.

Semi-sweet malt taste that leads into a bitter smokey taste that doesn't linger. The warmer glass tasted much better in my opinion and had some extra spiciness.

147,90,gcamparone,4.2,"Poured from a 22 ounce bomber into a Samuel Adams pint glass. Purchased at Wakefield Liquors in Wakefield, RI.  A- Pours a very dark brown body with a somewhat thin, light mocha head that reduces to a thin white film.  S- I'm really straining to smell something here. I'm not sure if it's my nose today as this is the first beer I'm reviewing, but I'm getting very faint coffee, toasted malt notes with some dark fruit undertones.  T- There we go. Upfront, a rich smoked wood flavor that is reminiscent of smoked barbecue (in the best way possible). I also get dark chocolate and black coffee notes. Finishes with a bitter, smokey, toasted malt flavor. Delicious and balanced taste.  M- Thick oily body, low carbonation. Creamy.  Overall this was a very enjoyable brew. The smokiness was not overdone, just enough to enjoy it. Complex and balanced. The only thing missing was a side of hickory smoked ribs.

Needless to say, I was not left disappointed as this beer packed all of the punch and flavor I've become accustomed to with Stone beers. This beer is jet black, offering no discernible light through, and has a thin tan head that lasts until the very last drop. A sweet feel on the tongue is followed by a strong smokey flavor that delivers an uncompromising finish on what the name implies. Would I buy this again? Absolutely.

Aroma is rather bland, with only slight evidence of roast or smoke, not much else to detect. Flavor continues with very little chocolate or coffee flavor, a bit watered down in flavor. Cant get much of the smoke here. Palate is thin for what I expected to be a bold porter and the great things I heard. Just okay for me, and wish this had a bit more flavor to it.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Smoked Porter,89
147,90,TheQuietMan22,3.88,"Serving type: 22-ounce bomber. The “ENJOY BY” date is “01.19.13.”  Appearance: Straight pour into a Smoked Porter pint glass. The color is, as the label suggests, dark mahogany. Two fingers of thick, tan head dissipated slowly and unevenly, leaving trails of foam along the sides.  Smell: The smokiness is present but muted. It is hanging around in the background behind dark chocolate, roasted malts, espresso, caramel, and vanilla that is reminiscent of cream soda. As the beer warms, the smokiness does become a little more prominent.  Taste: The smokiness makes its mark on the flavor, though I get the sense it is more like a barrel-aged quality. However, it does have that campfire or wood-burning stove quality. It complements flavors of roasted malts, chocolate, and a hint of espresso. The smokiness and roasted malts offer a nice bitterness that coats the mouth after each sip.  Drinkability: It is pretty solid stuff. It does not necessarily blow me away, and I was expecting something better, but it is very good nonetheless.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Smoked Porter,89
147,90,BrownNut,3.86,"Bottle to tulip. Served cool. Drank half with a roast chicken and roast vegetables and half by itself. Went fine with the food.  A - 4.5 - Dark chocolate brown. Beautiful textured cream head.  S - 3.5 - Surprisingly I don't get much smoke. Just a bit. As others have said, a bit of an earthy note and some coffee grounds.  T - 4.0 - Sort of mild up front, but a char character comes through a little while after swallowing. The aftertaste is where it's most prevalent. The slightest hint of baker's chocolate bleeding into the char. Boozy exhale.  M - 3.5 - Medium-light bodied. I'd like a bit more but then I guess I want it to be an imperial stout, which isn't exactly fair.  O - 4.0 - I guess I was expecting more smoke, maybe something closer to rauchbier levels. But the imperial stouts I've been drinking have about the same char character. I find myself wishing this would just bring the rest of it and go ahead and be bolder and be an imperial stout already. With that said, it's still very well done. And I like the charry aftertaste. If I forget about what it's advertised as and what I wish it would be, it comes out as a really well done beer.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Smoked Porter,89
147,90,Clowerweb,4.45,"Served from a 22 oz. bottle into a pint glass.  Appearance: Very dark brown, nearly black with accents of crimson hue. Looks fantastic. Three fingers of darkish tan head, 67% small tight bubbles and 33% medium to large. Head is thick and foamy, but dissipated to one finger rather quickly, within about 45 seconds which is a bit disappointing. Less than a pinky finger within 60 seconds of the pour without any sips, so retention is above average but not great (-0.5). A lot of sticky lace left on the glass after head dissipation, almost opaquing the top of the glass, which is very nice. 4.5/5  Aroma: A bit light on the nose (-0.5). Aroma is very dark malty and earthy. Has a sweet, almost nutty smell. Not picking up a lot of the ""smoked"" aspect on the nose, but possibly a hint. Smells like a great porter, a little more aromatic would be nice, but very pleasant nonetheless. 4.5/5  Taste: Tastes higher ABV than what it actually is up front (-0.5). The first part of the tongue hit me with alcohol which faded quickly, immediately followed by rich oaty roasted malts, semisweet with a nice touch of bitter hops and coffee. Dry on the finish with a sweet creamy roasted toffee or caramel coffee aftertaste. Great flavor, 4.5/5  Mouthfeel: Medium bodied, feels a little lighter than it appears (-0.5). Carbonation is almost just right for my tastes, moderate, a little light but not too overly light. Could use a little more there but not much. Leaves a tingle on the gums but feels a bit flat on the tongue (-0.5). Goes down very smooth and creamy. 4/5  Overall: Excellent porter. Among some of the best I've had, definitely a strong competitor in this category. Stone got pretty much everything right with this one, with almost nothing to complain about. A beer I could happily enjoy every night if I could. Solid 4.5/5",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Smoked Porter,89
147,90,GMB,4.65,"September 25, 2012.  Rauchbier (lit., ""smoke-beer"") is a style that has yet to enjoy widespread popularity among craft beer drinkers in the United States, whence yours truly writes this review. In some ways, this is not surprising he American craft beer industry and its consumer base favor hop-driven styles such as India Pale Ale. But in other ways the scarcity of smoked porters on the American beer market is surprising, for if the stylistic innovations of American breweries is any indication of the American drinking public's palate, American craft beer drinkers have grown increasingly interested in more complex and aggressive flavor profiles. Consider this along with Americans' love of barbecue and other kinds of grill-roasted meats (e.g., the hamburger), and it becomes difficult to imagine why smoked beers have yet to emerge as a popular genre in the world of craft and artisan beers.  When held against light, a deep redness shines through the dense black body of Stone Smoked Porter. A moderate pour produces a tall, cappuccino head.  The smokey aspect of this beer influences but does not overwhelm the nose. Two or three deep inhalations pick up on the expected aromas of smoked and roasted, almost charred grains. There must be something else there, but I cannot tell what it is...  The taste of this beer develops and changes as it warms and as the palate grows accustomed to it. At first, a nice mix of sweet, rich charred grains and light smoke are at the fore. The flavor of smoke lingers just enough at the back of the tongue to allow the roasted malts to come through. As the beer warms, the bitterness of the hops and alcohol, at first barely detectable, begins to assert itself, producing hints of similarly bitter flavors. Licorice and dark chocolate stand out among them.  The key to a successful smoked beer is balance. Too much smokey flavor and one is left feeling as if one were standing too close to a fire pit. Too little and one begins to suspect that one is confusing smokey characteristics with roasted malts. Stone has managed to produced a fine balance of the two.  The beer's mouthfeel is nearly perfect at first: Delicate carbonation produces a thick, creamy foam that enhances the rich roasted characteristics of the smoked malt. But the carbonation fails to survive subsequent drafts and swirls, and the last few sips fall flat.  I cannot say how Stone Smoked Porter compares with the rauchbier of Bamberg, but I can say that it strikes me as a mature, well-designed, balanced rendition of this yet under-appreciated genre. This beer is likely to please porter drinkers and barbecue aficionados alike.  Note: This beer pairs very well with dark chocolate and roasted almonds. Allow a piece of dark chocolate to coat your palate before sipping; the interplay between the chocolate and the beer's smokey malt won't disappoint.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Smoked Porter,89
147,90,fourthaxis,3.8,"This guy is my fill in, my backup, my plan B. Maybe living near Escondido helps, but I can find this inexpensive porter everywhere.

147,90,russwbeck,4.41,"A: This is an outstanding looking smoked porter. Very glad I got a picture of the pour. Three or four fingers of light brown head with huge bubbles inside, sitting atop a black pour. The retention is decent, but the lacing is outstanding, coating the sides of my Stone IRS goblet.  S: The smoke is noted on the aroma, but it isn't the major factor. Caramel and roasted malts, molasses, chocolate, and slight char. Pretty nicely balanced, but nothing is overly impressive. More on the porter side of things (I guess that's why they list it as an American Porter instead of a Smoked one), and isn't as crazy smelling as others that closely resemble bacon.  T: The balance of the taste, however, is something to write home about. It resembles the aroma, but takes it to the next level. The taste is built on a base of chocolate, caramel malts, molasses, and dark fruits that let the roast--from both coffee and malts--shine through. Sweet, complex, and smokey, this porter is one to be taken seriously.  MF: The body is lighter than most porters, with an average carbonation. The beer is silky smooth, and is top notch in terms of drinkability.  O: Stone Smoked Porter is cheap, readily available, offered year 'round, and is delicious. If you're like me and skipped picking this up every time you go on a beer run...bring that streak to an end, you'd be doing yourself a favor.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Smoked Porter,89
147,90,BeerDocT,3.22,"Served in a chilled tulip glass.  -Appearance 3.0: Pours out a nice, jet-black color so indicative of porters and stouts. Creamy and small head. Somewhat translucent and not thick, inky black.  -Smell 3.5: Smells very much like a porter, but has a subdued bouquet. Strange, for a ""smoked"" beer, I do not smell much smokiness.  -Taste 3.00: Front is slightly sour which leads to the middle which is very nice: toasted grains, but the grains in question still maintain a certain ""grassiness"" that is indicative of lighter beers. I also get a huge hit of that evil bleu cheese hop that I despise. Nasty. Finish is all hops and smoke and is pleasing. I definitely taste the high alpha Columbus hops here, swirling in the background, fighting against the bleu cheese. Aftertaste is long and dry and smoky. Mixed bag.  -Mouthfeel 3.5: Good mouthfeel. Smooth and silky. Spot on for this style.  -Overall 3.25: This is a good drinking beer, but I imagine it would overpower any food you consume with it. My opinion is that this is an okay beer as far as taste goes, but that Stone needs to upgrade several elements of this beer. Room for improvement in several areas.

147,90,acevenom,3.93,"Poured into a large brandy snifter. Pours dark brown to black with a creamy tan head that dissipates slowly. As is typical of Stone beer, there is plenty of lacing left on the side of the glass. Mild smokiness could be detected in the initial pour. The nose reveals more smokiness to accompany the dark roasted malt. There's a mild aroma of chocolate and hops. The smokiness is prominent, but well balanced along with the taste of the dark roasted malt and chocolate. The hops are faint in the background. The body is light to medium with moderate carbonation. The beer is smooth, making this a highly drinkable porter. This is an excellent beer.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Smoked Porter,89
147,90,Jesse13713,3.93,"Bomber poured into an Arrogant Bastard pint glass.  Appearance - Three full fingers of rootbeer brown head, even from a quiet pour. The head soon clumps and appears spotty,making the lacing hard to grade because of the whipped-cream-like noggin. The beer is fairly dark, appearing black under ill-lit circumstance. Taking it closer to the light yields a more dark maroon color.  Smell - Roasted peppers and a huge campfire waft of smoke. Smoky oats and barley float above a bit of chipotle pepper aroma. There is a bit of sweet honey to the nose as well, though it well-hidden.  Taste - Huge scores of roasted barley and burning wheat stalks. A very light chipotle pepper taste in the back of the throat. Mild bitterness lingers around with dark, chocolaty malt before the two become friends. Smoke coats the entire roof of the mouth, while the sweeter flavors play on the tongue beneath it. Drinking out of the bottle yields a sweeter molasses note.  Mouthfeel and Drinkability - Surprisingly tart on the tongue at first. The low abv allows for a smooth, smoky ride. Imagine coming home from a campfire, the smell of smoke on your clothes - smoking a cigarette after eaten a lightly hot pepper about ten minutes prior. That doesn't make much sense. But it sounds good right now so I'm gonna leave it in the review. Light on the palate, certainly not alcoholic, and easily sessionable. I want to have this out by the campfire.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Smoked Porter,89

147,90,MadScientist,4.7,"Pours a moderately deep garnet with excellent clarity. A tan very long head settles to a quarter of an inch of foam and leaves some lacing on the glass.  A smooth smoke aroma blends nicely with a roasted malt aroma. There is also supporting malt character aromas of bready, toffee and chocolate. Hops aroma is not perceptible. There are mild dark fruit esters of prunes and figs.  There is a perfect balance of dark malt and smoke flavors that progresses to a roasty dry finish. A medium sweetness with some toffee and chocolate notes blended with a moderate hop bitterness.

S- Biscuity roast malt with a mild smoked peat aroma, a bit like the background of a good scotch. Very faint herbal hops.  T- The malt is up front, sweet and smoky givving way to some mild bitterness and dark chocolate. Finish is slightly dry with a little mineral astringency..

The smokeyness comes in behind the beer and leaves a pleasant aftertaste. A fruity sweetness as well. This beer also has a dry woody character to it.

147,90,McStagger,4.13,"A: Pours a beautiful garnet with two fingers incredibly dense, fluffy mocha head. Head retention is stellar. Lacing is also stellar. Beautiful looking pint.  S: Immediately the smoke presence is known. Charred oak, chicory, coffee, and cacao are all present in the nose. Also present is a bit of citric hops.  T: Again, the smoke is a powerful component in the process. Layers of it permeate throughout the tasting. Sweet chocolate malts are met immediately with an oily smokiness which is quickly overtaken by a flash of citric hoppiness. Finishes dry with an awesome roasted aftertaste of americano, chicory and cocoa powder.  M: Carbonation is subdued, which is great for the style. However, the body is just a touch on the thin side for expressing such dark and aggressive flavors.  O: Goddamn amazing. This is a beer that I've been eyeing for a few weeks. Glad to have finally tried it.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Smoked Porter,89
147,90,Darkmagus82,4,"Poured from 22 oz bomber into pint glass  Appearance – Pours a deep brown nearly black color with a thick one finger tan head. The head had very nice retention leaving a medium amount of lacing.  Smell – Roasted malt is heaviest in the nose. These are cocoa and dark bread in nature with lighter hints of some smokiness, pine and a nice caramel/brown sugar sweetness.  Taste – A smooth roasted malt and cocoa flavor mixed with a light sweet caramel start the taste out. The caramel fades as some hoppy flavors come to the tongue. These are largely earthy in nature with lighter flavors of pine. At the end, the smoke that is suggested in the name, comes to fruition along with a resurgence (light resurgence) of some sweeter flavors. Overall a very nice taste is left on the tongue in the end.  Mouthfeel – Creamier then the average brew with a slightly lighter level of carbonation. Very nice for the roasty-smoky flavors of the brew.  Overall – It’s a rather easy to drink, roasty and a good go to for a slightly dryer porter. Not too shabby.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Smoked Porter,89
147,90,Pintofbrown,4.03,"I reviewed Smoked Porter in a glass mug.  Appearance- This beer has a very nice muddy-brown cap with tiny bubbles in the smooth surface. There is about a finger's-width of foam sitting atop the dark brown and opaque body. There is almost a solid wall of lace as the drink diminishes in the glass.  Smell- This one is full of rich cocoa nibs and a tangy yeast. It almost smells like sourdough bread. Not much smoke to speak of, but incredibly rich and malty.  Taste- The palate is not quite as rich, but the smokiness is more forward and really clings for a long finish. The sourdough bread malt hits the palate more in the middle of the drink. Cocoa is not nearly as strong here, which is a little disappointing.  Mouth feel- A nice mouth feel is found in Smoked Porter: a bigger medium body that slides easily over the tongue. It is not very dry, but the beer really sticks to the cheeks, making for a very long drink.  Overall- I really enjoyed this porter. If only the malty, cocoa bomb promised by the nose could transfer to the palate without getting muted by the smoke. Otherwise there is not much to complain about here. Enjoy this one!",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Smoked Porter,89
147,90,SylviaFaye,4.35,"This is a dark, ruby porter with excellent body and a solid, sweet smell. The hops are milder than other big porters that I've sampled, so the notes center less on black coffee and more on chocolate malt and stewed plum flavors. There is a dash of smoky flavor in the background, as advertised, but I might have missed it if I were not looking for it. Overall, I found Stone Smoked Porter very drinkable and pleasant, a beer that I will definitely pick up again.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Smoked Porter,89
147,90,BeerNoobNC,4.5,"Poured from a 22 oz bottle into a 24 oz glass. Definitely a good porter, and definitely has a little of that ""smoked"" flavor, but to me this beer doesn't stick out from other good porters as the best.

147,90,socon67,4.15,"A - Dark brown to black pour. Nice lacing, and a nice tan foam head 1/4"" thick.  S - Smell of roasted hickory wood, chocolate malt, and black pepper.  T - Nice taste of smoke that settles in the saliva glands. Feel as good as a good cigar. Some cocoa flavor is noted as well, and a tiny bit of heat.  M - Certianly a big porter that is best suited as a post meal drink. Hits with some punch.  O - I like this very much, but got spoiled by the more limited variety with chipotle. If you like smoky porters this is a great option that is generally easy to get a hold of.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Smoked Porter,89

The nose is that of roasted malt, chocolate, piney floral hops. Not as smoky as anticipated. The flavor delivers more smoke as expected but not so much that you feel like you're sucking on a charcoal briquette. Pleasant. Again roasted malts and chocolate. Medium bitterness from the piney earthy hops. Finishes clean and smooth with a lingering roasted smoke flavor. Medium bodied and well carbonated. I am typically not a fan of smoked beer, but this has a gentle enough smoke character that it is enjoyable. Good beer.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Smoked Porter,89
147,90,DeltaGolfSierra,4.45,"Color is dark brown with a reddish hue when held to light. The tan head has good retention, with lots of lacing left behind. The smell is primarily cocoa, with perhaps a subtle touch of pine as well. The taste begins with sweet roasted malts, followed by a noticeable twinge of hops bitterness toward the finish.

Plenty of bitterness along with those flavors. Mild sweetness through the middle and a large dose of piney hops for the style. A real nice lingering smokiness in the aftertaste, without being overpowering.

147,90,rangerred,3.93,"Poured out of a 22oz bomber into a pint glass.  Pours a very dark brown, almost black with just a tiny head that is quick to fade. Not really any lacing.  Aroma of consists largely of dark chocolate with a touch of coffee. The smoke is detectable but it is not overwhelming like some rauchbiers. All in all, though, I find the nose to be somewhat weak.  The taste more than makes up for the lack of aroma with tons of coffee and chocolate along with a decent dose of smoke. The smoke is much more noticeable compared to the nose and it compliments the other flavors nicely. It does have a slight medicinal note from the peat but it works. The moderate to high bitterness come in midway through and grows towards the finish and is quite noticeable on the roof of the mouth.  Overall I am impressed with this beer as I am with all of Stone's brews. The smoke adds a nice layer to a typical porter and makes this a really outstanding beer.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Smoked Porter,89
147,90,troysoy2,3.68,"Ah, a luscious, creamy 2-finger head, over a deep, dark brown body, with a blood red tinge. Really quite nice retention, but not the hugest amount of lacing.  The smell is well balanced between a mild roastiness, caramel malt, some citrus, lightly roasted coffee, and of course, smoke. The smoke is very laid back, and complements the other aromas well.  The taste follows the smell quite closely. The smoke comes into play on the aftertaste, and even then it does not dominate the flavor. Quite balanced in that respect. If anything, I would say the citrus hops overpower the roasted barley flavor in the mid-palate, ever so slightly. The mouthfeel is rather light -- possibly a bit too much so, even for a porter. But the finish is just the right level of dryness to bring out the subtle smokiness.  A solid beer, and I'd say the price is right, so I certainly plan on buying more someday in the not so distant future.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Smoked Porter,89
147,90,ThisWangsChung,3.6,"Poured into a tulip glass.  A: Pours a very dark burgundy color with good clarity in spite of its darker tint. Particularly, I like that it's not as pitch black as some of the other porters I've had (especially the ones that try to think they're stouts). The head is a three finger offwhite color with decent retention/lacing.  S: Judging from the smell, this isn't as robust as what I'm used to from a porter. Nonetheless, there is plenty of rich dark fruit, chocolate, caramel, molasses, and only a faint touch of smoke.  T: I could kvetch about the smoky flavor not being as expressive as it could be, but as a man who isn't fan of bacon or smoked meats (though I do like my BBQ every once in a while), I like that it's only a subtle hint that lingers throughout the drinking experience while never overpowering the porter base. Aside from the smoke, there are subtle hints of chocolate, molasses, dark fruit, and hints of coffee with a faint strike of hops on the finish. While I enjoy this quite a bit, there are some small niggles all around that keep it from being great, chief among which is the lack of robustness I like in a porter. Then again, maybe I'm spoiled by Fuller's London Porter, but I still think this could use a stronger roast character overall.  M: This has a lighter body at first, but it thickens up near the finish, leaving the tongue rather chalky feeling. The chalky texture detracts from the character slightly. The dryness on the finish builds gradually. Good carbonation.  O: I'm not going to whine about this not being robust enough, I'm just going to say it's a solid porter throughout that never overpowers the tongue with smoke notes. Definitely worth a try. I'd get it again - if only because I think it's a fantastic pairing with BBQ chicken.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Smoked Porter,89
147,90,sevenarts,2.81,"A: Dark brownish black, fluffy tan head with very long retention but little lacing.  S: Very strong smokey smell, fairly sweet, like vanilla or caramel. Also surprisingly boozy considering the low ABV, which gives it a bit of a medicinal edge.  T/M: Lots of sweet malts up front: caramel, vanilla, roasted flavors. The sweetness eventually subsides a little to make way for some smokey, burnt flavors and bitter hops. The mouthfeel is really smooth and creamy, probably the best aspect of this beer.  O: The first Stone beer I'm not really crazy about. Too sweet, and the malty, smokey sweetness hangs over everything. Underneath there seems to be a nice beer hiding out but any additional flavors are mostly just overpowered.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Smoked Porter,89
147,90,Arborescence,4.06,"Appearance: Virtually black. Pours a thick three finger head with some hints of chocolate.  Aroma: Roasted malt, toasty. Deep and satisfying, but not smoke as far as I can tell.  Taste: Lovely malt attack! Rich chocolate, espresso, and roasted coffee & malts. Some toasty characteristics from the smoking, but it's not ""smoky"" as such. Very tasty though.  Mouthfeel: Very smooth, medium bodied.  Overall: This is an excellent, robust porter, although I'm surprised about the relative lack of smoke. For the style, the points come down a little bit because of the lack of smoke, but as a porter this is very good indeed.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Smoked Porter,89
147,90,elNopalero,4.63,"Sometimes its worth revisiting a classic. I haven’t had Stone’s Smoked Porter in ages. The first time I tried it I remember thinking it was too smoky for my tastes. Then I started to enjoy roast and appreciate porters, so it grew on me. Lately, however, I’ve had several brews made with smoked malt—including San Antonio’s own Mesquite Smoked Porter from Ranger Creek. Would I still enjoy Stone’s take on a smoked porter after having expanded my palate and appreciation?  In short, yes.  I poured this from a bottle purchased in January 2012. It stayed hidden in my fridge until mid-April of the same year. While I didn’t expect to encounter much, if any, of a time-sensitive hop profile I state this because I wonder if the smoked malt mellows out over time.  At 5.9% ABV this is one of Stone’s “lightest” offerings. Parenthesis, only because it pours a dark coffee black with a billowy topping of crème colored foam. It has a light roast aroma, with just a touch of smoke. It’s subtle, nuanced and delicate to the point where it would be easily overlooked had it gone a shade lighter. Flavorwise the smoked malt makes its presence known without being bombastic or assertive. It complements the roast characteristics in a way that makes it a team player, an integral component of this beer’s flavor profile. There’s cacao nibs and a light hop bittering to round out the team, with a little sweetness on the body. It’s delicious and deliciously drinkable and I enjoyed it tremendously.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Smoked Porter,89

First is the roatsed malts, coffee, and dark chocolate. Next is the slight smoke. This is all rounded off by more malty character and very light anise and dark fruits. And I put an emphasis on very light  M: Medium-full bodied with moderate carbonation  O: A very nice and complex porter that has a very nice price point and is pretty easy to drink.

147,90,BeardedRiker,3.91,"Quick question: Why did I not buy this beer before? It's $5.09 (plus tax) for a bomber and it's a smoked porter. Obviously my wires were messed up in my head for a long time. The only other time I had Stone's Smoked Porter was a few weeks ago at a good bar in Dallas, TX called The Common Table. They had a version of it on Randall and with Knob Creek vanilla beans. It was insanely good, especially when it got very warm. Now it's time to see how the original version is.  This is one of those beers you love pouring out. The head forms pretty slowly with the bubbles turbulently rising to the top, making a lovely, fluffy light tan head that has excellent retention, allowing you to get a nice amount of head to rise above the rim of the glass. There's a good amount of lacing. The darkest of brown, it's a more reddish ruby color, and clear, when before a light. Some bubbles remain on the surface of the beer throughout the experience.  This is a very mealy-smelling beer to me. Roasted malts dominate but they're not nearly as chocolatey or coffee-y as I expected them to be. That's not a bad thing, though. There's a slightly sweet caramel aroma too. I wouldn't say smokiness is strong but it's definitely there, but I will say there is a pretty strong toastiness to it. Good aromas but nothing great or strong.  This wasn't as strong as I thought it'd be. It's taste mirrors the smell in many ways. It's mostly mealy and the toastiness comes in there again, like a light smokiness. Compared to Left Hand's Smoke Jumper I had over the weekend, this is much less smoky. I almost feel as if Stone has tried to make a more drinkable beer, and that's something that's not really their style. There's a bit of chocolate and coffee that makes their presence felt, or in this case tasted, later on. Flavors are good but not strong enough to make much of an impression. Smokiness is more of a hint than a defining character.  This is a pretty smooth brew. Medium-bodied with medium-low carbonation. This is a very smooth beer and because of its mild flavors it is very drinkable as well.  I'll be honest, this didn't satisfy me as I thought it would. Usually when I pour such a gorgeous beer its other qualities are just equally as good, but the smell and taste were underwhelming to me. This beer's flaw, if it can be called that, is that it doesn't have enough of what's already there. The on Randall and Knob Creek vanilla bean version I had had much more character and got more interesting as I drank it. This sort of stayed good but not great. But if you're wanting a mild-flavored and drinkable smoked porter, this is a good bet and it's relatively cheap price makes it an easier choice for a purchase.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Smoked Porter,89

At some points it was like having charcoal at your mouth, like taking a deep breath from a grill at a BBQ.  M - Smooth and slightly carbonated, but not overwhelming at all; has a little dry finish, but it just leaves you wanting more.  Overall, I enjoyed this brew a lot. It was balanced, with a good body and complexity without being overwhelming to the palate.

147,90,DM1293,3.88,"I don't normally drink porters, let alone smoked ones. I drink stouts, and usually when I go into a dark beer I usually akin them to stouts by default.  But I don't get much of the coffee/chocolate notes. I do get toasty malt and the smokiness, no doubt. The most surprising part is how mellow it all is; there isn't an overbearing hop characteristic here. Its just a rich warming brew, exceptionally smooth.  I'll need to try this again cold, but warm, it ain't bad at all. Surprising, since I don't normally drink dark beers warm.  Pair this with something equally rich. This would go perfectly with some pulled pork, no doubt. Something spicy-sweet would really work with the smoked flavor I get here.

147,90,TheSixthRing,4.03,"Appearance - Pours a dark, near black brown with reddish hue when/where light can penetrate. The tan head is a good 2 finger width, and hangs a bit before giving way to a fine, sticky lacing.  Smell - Roasted coffee and chocolate malt, but the smoke is the most prevalent force in the aroma. A bit of grain comes through in the nose as well.  Taste - Like how I would imagine a smoked porter to taste. Dark roasted coffee and rich chocolate malt flavors, accompanied by a deep, smokey backbone. There's just enough hoppiness to give this beer a slightly bitter bite, but not enough to detract from what this beer is all about. The smoke, at times, tends to mask the other flavors in this beer, but moreso before the beer warms.  Mouthfeel - Medium body, creamy and smooth.  Overall - This is good, and far from your average porter, but the smokiness can be a bit of a nuisance at times, detracting from the porter characteristics in the beer. It'd love to see what Stone could do with the Porter style in a non-smoked form, but alas, this is what they seem content to releasing as their year-round offering. Drink on the warmer side to allow the other flavors to blossom amongst the smokey overtones.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Smoked Porter,89
147,90,TheCondor,3.35,"Poured from the pint bottle into a pint glass.  Appearance – Pours a deep brown almost black color with a slight amber hue to it. A decent sized head came from an aggressive pour, but left rather quickly. Pretty fair lacing.  Smell – Smokiness, roasted malts, a little caramel and chocolate. Pretty nice nose on this one.  Taste – The flavoring is good, follows the nose to a degree. The smokiness certainly imparts flavors to the brew, which in my opinion actually interfere with what is otherwise an excellent beer. A slight sweetness, not much at all, but the taste overall is more on the bitter side. I just didn’t like the balance of the beer.  Mouthfeel – Medium bodied, medium well carbonation.  Overall – This is a good brew to some, but I am more of a fan of the traditional porters, so this one caught me off guard a little. This is a great beer to try once, and If you are a big fan of the smoked porters then it would be recommended, but otherwise, there are better out there. Certainly try it though, I'm just not real keen on the smoked flavoring.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Smoked Porter,89
147,90,Josh,3.97,"A - The beer poured a deep black in the center part of the glass and showed amber on the edges where the beer was not as thick across the glass. A one finger head sat on top of the beer but dissipated very quickly. Once the head dissipated, a thin veil of head residue and medium sized bubbles cover all but a halo, that sits slightly inside the edge of the glass.  S - I picked up a smokey sweetness. It reminds me of milk chocolate and bacon that is on the brink of burning. Great! I am stuffy today though, so I might revise this if I drink it on a day where I have less sinus blockage.  T - There is the very, very, very slightest first taste of sweetness, like a brown sugar, which is instantly over powered by the burnt bacon flavor, and finishes slightly bitter. The bitterness is much less than I expected compared to Arrogant Bastard and porters in general. I truly like the unique flavor, but I do not feel like I would pick this beer off the shelf again if I recalled my experience. As a dark beer fan, I find that there are more traditional flavored porters I prefer.  M - Very carbonated after being in your mouth for a second. Goes down silky smooth.  O - Good beer. I am happy to have tried it, but I probably will not be buying another one.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Smoked Porter,89
147,90,dbrauneis,3.7,"Served in a bottle at Idle Hands in New York, NY  A: Pours a clear dark amber to brown in color with some ruby hints when held up to the light. There is a thin off-white head that reduces to a thin ring of bubbles at the edge of the glass. Moderate lacing is observed.  S: Roasted and caramel malts followed by a lovely peat smokiness and some hints of sweetness. The smell reminds me a bit of a good scotch.  T: Slight hint of iodine/band-aid from the smoke but that just adds to the flavor in my opinion. Some caramel sweetness but not as much as you might expect from the smell, followed by the peat smokiness, and leave a scotch like flavor on the tongue as a aftertaste.  M: Medium bodied with moderate carbonation. Slightly thin.  O: Definitely a really interesting beer with a good flavor but I personally could not drink a whole lot of this one - just doesn't match my palate as well as other smokey beers. Definitely a quality offering from Stone and a good one to sip on.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Smoked Porter,89
147,90,jwhancher,4.03,"Bought a 22-oz bottle and poured into a snifter  A: brown with ruby highlights. Nice fluffy tan head.  S: Subtle smoke that reminds me of ham & campfire. Soft chocolate malt aromas.  T: Light blend of smoke, chocolate and some roast. Everything is well balanced as each flavor molds together nicely. As it warms, some raisin and a little fig. Low hop flavor.  M: Significant bitterness upfront that eases into a creamy mouthfeel. Seems medium-full to full.  O: A well made beer overall. A solid porter with an element of smoke to it.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Smoked Porter,89

Also a great underlying smell of oak.  T-a wonderful oak flavor hits your palate. As it goes down you get strong smokey and bitter hop flavors, then it cleans off nicely. Very smooth for the style.  M-nice heavy body with mild carbonation.  O-what a great porter. Nice smokey flavors, basically everything you would want for this style.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Smoked Porter,89
147,90,BradtheGreat7,4.15,22 oz brown bomber. Awesome screen printed Stone label as always with this brewery. Poured into a nonic pint glass.  A - darkest of brown splashed with touches of deep ruby. Tan to beige head that pours thick and fluffy leaving behind a fine display of lace. Good stick.  S - sweet dark malts with a slight smokiness to it. Hints of coffee along with a whiff of chocolate and a light touch of vanilla. More whiffs of smoked grain deep within.  T - rich chocolate with roasted coffee notes. A small taste of dark fruit creeps up through a steady flor of mild sweetness. A good dose of smoked malts on top of everything. Burnt like malt and some hops create a nice semi bitterness in the finish.  M - medium bodied and delicious. This is on the thick side and very drinkable.  O - awesome porter from stone. Has the porter 'it' factor with a stone style. I don't think they make an average beer. I could drink this any time. Definitely in my list of top 3 American porters. It's that good.,Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Smoked Porter,89
147,90,longbongsilver,4,"Never had a smoked beer before. This one was a reasonable price, so here we are. Pours motor oil deep-brown-to-black, though with decent amount of fizz on the sides, head like root beer.  Smells like dark chocolate & raisin, maybe some licorice. Not sure what wood they smoked the grains with, and it's subtle, but it reminds me of a cross between oak and cherry. Enough sniffin'...  The dark fruit comes up much more on the swig than the nose, while chocolate still present though playing a surprising amount of background. Sweeter than I expected also. Doesn't go down as thick as I expected, surprisingly refreshing and mellow overall.  For something grabbed on a whim, the verdict is: freakishly delicious. I would buy a 40 of this if I could. Seriously.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Smoked Porter,89
147,90,coldriver,4.25,"22 oz bomber pours a dark cola with good head and lacing. Aroma has a nice smokey nose with roasted coffee, vanilla, and light bacon. The taste really separates this one from other smoked porters - it has a wonderful smokey taste without being raspy. Slight hoppy bitterness balances things out without being overwhelming. Great easy-going mouthfeel reinforces the lack of smokey raspiness, with dry finish. I've had smoked porters that left me feeling like I'd been breathing in campfire smoke for hours on end but not this one! A very nice smoked porter.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Smoked Porter,89
147,90,TempeBeerMan,4.39,"Poured from a bottle into a dimpled mug.  A – Deep chocolate brown near black, and an aggressive pour yields a massive three finger head of thick beige foam. Looks awesome. Light/minimal lacing.  S – Mild aroma of toasted grains and campfire smoke. Not getting much else.  T – Much more flavorful and deep than the nose would indicate. While roasted barley flavor makes a strong presence, there are also nearly equal notes of smoke, caramel, coffee, dark fruits, and toffee. This is one rich and complex porter. Finish brings bitterness from both the burnt malt and an underlying hop base that while subdued, would be missed if it weren’t there. Amazing.  M – Medium bodied bordering on thick, with a delightful creaminess. Props to Stone for realizing that “porter” does not equal “thin and watery”. Finishes “wet”, with an aftertaste that carries.  O – Finally! A “smoked” beer that doesn’t clobber your taste buds with smokiness and nothing else. Finally! A deep and complex thick chewy porter that offers up a lot more than just burnt grain. World class. For comparison, I had an Alaskan Smoked Porter just days ago, and this blew it away. Another hit from Stone. Probably going to become my go-to porter.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Smoked Porter,89

S – The first smell this beer reminded me of was a smoked cheese, in a good way. It has a very smoky, malty scent with hints of chocolate.  T – A delicious roasted malt flavor comes through with the notes of chocolate, coffee and smoke. Has a slightly bitter bite to it.  M – The beer has a good medium body with the right amount of carbonation.  O – I had this delicious beer on tap at the Stone Brewing restaurant and it was definitely a highlight of the ones I sampled. It has a distinct flavor and worth enjoying again.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Smoked Porter,89
147,90,Celtics76,4.1,"Finally got a chance to try this. Kept putting it off as I'm not a huge fan of porters. Only $4.95 at Gasbarro's!  Anyway, poured into a Red Hook sample glass. Very dark brown in color with a fast dissipating head. Smells terrific - roasted malt with a mild smokiness.  Nice, complex flavor. Tastes like it smells, though the smokiness comes out a little more. I think this would go very well with a beef brisket from LJs.  When I'm in the mood for a porter, this would be my first choice.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Smoked Porter,89
147,90,PorterLambic,3.91,"Poured down the middle of a standard pint glass. A very dark brown liquid, root beer-like color, with a big, dark tan head topping it. Head settles after a few minutes to a solid 1/2"" carpet of foam, leaving decent lace behind. Smell is malt, wet cardboard, some hops and even lighter smoke notes. Seems weaker and less balanced than I remember from some years back. Taste is malt, hops, smoky beef jerky, teriyaki and wood. Better balance here. Medium-bodied w ith a lightish effervescence. Drying from the middle through the finish. Slight warming aspect after the swallow. Like the name says, this is one of my favorite styles. The memory of this brew is better than this tasting. I can't help thikn this recipe has been ""adjusted"" with more hops and less body than the last time I had it about 4 years back. I prefer the old recipe.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Smoked Porter,89
147,90,falloutsnow,4.11,"Bottle from Piccadilly off Springfield in Champaign, IL No bottled on date visible Poured into a standard US pint glass  Stone's Smoked Porter is a defiantly robust, thick roasted barley beer that incorporates healthy amounts of coffee, chocolate, smoke, and hop flavors into a well-balanced package. For the availability and price, if you want a hop-forward porter, this is one of the best versions I've had.  Beer is able to pour a &gt;3cm head that is very light tan in color and composed of fine bubbles. As head descends over the course of a few minutes, it leaves excellent amounts of lacing spiderlike and honeycombed along sides of the glass. Body is dark brown to black, but when held to light, it reveals a dark amber or ruby highlight.  Aroma of roasted malt, molasses, vanilla, chocolate, and some smoke. All scents are detectable, quite nice overall, if it were a tad stronger aroma, this would be exceptional.  Opens with a chocolate sweetness and roasted malt flavor that hazes into a bit of smokiness and bitterness. Smokiness picks up mid-palate, but is not overwhelming, and complements the roasted malt, bitter hops, and mild coffee flavor of the porter excellently. Flavors then joined by some slight acrid bitterness, bordering on sourness, which is mildly noticeable, but definitely enjoyable. Hop presence exists throughout beer, bitter and slightly fruity, which is good, but perhaps too strong in a porter. Pleasant bitterness exists throughout beer, unsure if from use of hops or roasted malt, but it is good nonetheless. Aftertaste is of lingering bitterness, raw cacao, burnt coffee, and mild smokiness. Taste is very complex, I'm not capturing it all, but it is delicious.  Beer is medium to medium-heavy bodied, and feels a bit sticky in the mouth. Carbonation is a bit low for the thickness of the body, could be a bit higher and still retain the smoothness and enhance the flow of the beer across the palate. Overall mouthfeel is is fairly smooth and creamy, but a bit higher carbonation would make this less stagnant.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Smoked Porter,89
147,90,GarthDanielson,3.95,"Poured from a bottle and served in a tumbler pint. The beer pours a dark, vibrant brown color with a foamy, frothy pale-tan colored head that starts around an inch, but settles into a sparse filmy covering after a couple of minutes. Smells of molasses sweetness, smoke, coffee, and oak on the nose. Initial flavors of sweet molasses malt, smoke, and light roasted coffee, with a bitter overall tone that cleans the end of the palate. The beer is light and smooth in mouth, with a bitter hops, smokey, and coffee finish. The beer leaves a great lacing along the glass as you drink. The aftertaste has a slight linger, and the full, rich flavors and complex palate make this a great sipper.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Smoked Porter,89

Good smell of coffee and roasted malts. Taste is roasted malts, coffee and a moderate amount of smokiness (not Alaskan Smoked Porter smokey).

147,90,mndlssphlsphr,4.32,"Dark at first sight with a light brown head. A robust feel at the first sip followed by a smile. There is relaxation while making this brew. There is no right or wrong here, as the master brewer was not in a hurry I feel. There is a sense of hops, but not too much. The word caramel comes to my mind, I feel for the color but there is a bit of sweetness that compliments the hops. I know there is a chocolatyness to this - yet I feel it, but cannot describe it. The smoke though is obvious, this I can describe, do not worry there is no alarm to this fire. The sugars and the bitters blend togeather, I cannot distinguish the blacks from whites - a fine grey has been created. A taste from one of the gods I would guess, this taste is bliss....

147,90,TheBrewo,4.17,"We pour a brew the color of roasted, burnt chocolates. It holds a one finger tan head showing medium retention. This leaves a bubbly lacing and creamy film over the liquid. Carbonation is active and no sediment is noted. The aroma blossoms like a coffee stout. Raw bean comes in to give an additional smoke to the background char that is already there. There is a huge roast to the malts, with chocolate and oaty, cereal grain taking center stage. Medicinal phenols and hops of grass and pine oils follow with booze on the far back. As we sip, the flavoring begins with coiny grain, with smooth and dark char. Grass, pine, and earth mix up front, giving balance. The grain becomes souring, pulling us to a tart middle with more roast and oat. There is a cutting from sweet cream, as the sugars relax the bitters. The finish is a meld of everything together, with medicinal phenols, bittering hops, and a serious smoke and wood. The aftertaste breathes of that crazy smoky essence, bittering char, hop resin, and peppery alcohol. The body is fuller and the carbonation is slightly more than standard. The mouth is coated with light but drying metallics and booze. The feel to each sip is silky smooth, with great smack and slurp, and beautiful cream and froth. The abv is appropriate and this is easy drinking, but you want to nurse it for a while.  Overall, what we enjoyed most about this brew was how prevalent the smoke was. It was robust and obvious, but didn’t detract from the beautiful chocolatey inclusions and malts. Additionally, the soft feel helped to round things out on all fronts. If we were going to be picky we would have liked to see more smoke in the aroma, but this is minor. This is a nice twist on a well-executed, and otherwise fairly traditional porter.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Smoked Porter,89
147,90,mdcrouser,4.15,"Have to admit, I picked this from my beer fridge for the low ABV, as I didn't have lunch - more alcohol on an empty stomach, not good. This beer is the right fit for the night.  Heavy black, with a solid head, draws down to a tacky-looking deep tan layer of bubbles.  Incredible on the nose - like a fall bonfire, with plenty of smoke, but heavy in roasted malts too.  Highly roasted and smokey, but clean on the tongue. Almost like mixing a straight porter with a quarter rauchbier - it has those undertones.  Dry but still a little viscous. Light carbonation. Sticky to close.  Easy drinker, especially given the ABV.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Smoked Porter,89
147,90,DavoleBomb,3.35,"Poured into a snifter.  3.5 A: A good bit of carbonation in this one. Black color. Three fingers of frothy/creamy light tan head. Retention is good and sparse irregular lacing is left.  3.5 S: I'm a bit disappointed with the amount of smoke in this. I expected something a bit more badass from Stone. Anyway, it still smells good. Chocolate with a moderate neutral malt sweetness. A touch of graininess. Smoke is subdued, but it does add a touch of bacon. If this was 10X stronger, it be damn good.  3.0 T: This is a well crafted brew, but it isn't very exciting. Subtle chocolate, subtle roast, and a subtler smoke. The strongest flavor is neutral malt sweetness.  4.0 M: Despite a medium body, this has a lot of creaminess. Good moderate carbonation. Very nice here.  3.5 D: Stone was one of my first loves, but ever since drinking the beers of hundreds of breweries, they don't seem too impressive anymore. Sometimes I wish I had an undeveloped palate again. In any case, this is a tasty, easy drinker.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Smoked Porter,89

It smells like a porter... standard notes of coffee, tobacco, and a little bit of smoke.  T - This is where this beer really shines. It's smoky malts dominate the overall profile. Good cocoa, smoke, leather, and all of the tastes one looks for in the Porter style.  M - A little thinner than I prefer, but on par with what's expected. Decent carbonation, and a chewiness that rounds it out nicely.  O - A very good every-occasion porter.

S: Nose is strong malt and chocolate tones with some smoke mixed in there. It's pretty muted which is fine by my standards since my fear was this smoked porter would taste like a campfire  T: Charred wood up front mellowing to a nice mellow malt and some dark fruit that finish off with a slight bitterness  M: Very crisp and refreshing - not drying in any way.

Nice head retention and lacing as I drank it.  The aroma shows a little more of the caramel and milk chocolate to it. I get a little bit of a roasty, bitterness, but not really any smoke.  The taste has a bitter-sweet chocolate and caramel flavors mixing with some roasty, slightly burnt, bitter flavors. It's a nice balance between the chocolaty sweetness and the roasted bitterness. Just a little bit of smoke is there, not enough for me.  The mouthfeel is medium bodied for the style with carbonation being moderate. Overall, it's a pretty good beer. It's very nicely flavored and balances the flavors well. It's very drinkable for the style as well. My big criticism is that every time I have this beer I always wish there was more smokiness to it.

This tasty beer has a best by date of 1-18-12 and I poured it into my beer goblet.  Appearance: A beautiful one fingered tan head sits on top of a dark brown clear beer. This one is almost opaque, but when held up to the light reveals some carbonation bubble streams and reddish edges. This beer leaves some nice lacing (or my glass is finally ""beer clean."")  Smell: There is some campfire smoke, but this one is actually pretty subtle and share well with the other flavors in the room. I also get roasty malts and a touch of chocolate.  Taste: Very much reflective of the smell. I taste roasty malts, some chocolate, and a dash of campfire smoke. There is a nice semi-sweet quality about the chocolate with some bitterness on the finish. Being from Stone, I was expecting more smoke. That being said, I would not change anything, there are many over powered smoked beers out there and this is a nice alternative.  Mouthfeel: No problems.

147,90,KarlosT,4,"tried this at a stone beer tasting event  a: nice dark brown  s: could definitely smell the smokiness of the beer. some aromas of burnt coffee.  t and mf: As a French dark roast coffee drinker, I really liked this beer. Could definitely detect the smokiness, w/ coffee notes. Suspect there were chocolate notes as well (overloaded memory from 1 day ago). Nice mouthfeel, with the appropriate amount of carbonation.  overall: bought several bottles, and look forward to enjoying again in the near future. Highly recommended (especially for those who enjoy French Roasted coffee).  Re-eval'ed on Apr 2012. Compared side by side w/ a smoked porter from Throwback (very small brewery in Portmouth).  Stand by my original weighting. Like this beer a lot. Found it had more stronger, dominant flavors and aromas over Throwback. When compared, seemed like it had a more peat flavor (perhaps like a scotch). Perhaps almost a gamey/meaty taste. However, I would rank the Throwback equally high (perhaps slightly higher in taste).",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Smoked Porter,89

Its a heavy looking beer but really is a smooth mouthfeel with very nice finish and after taste.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Smoked Porter,89
147,90,tobelerone,4,"A dark brown beer with subtle reddish highlights that’s nearly but not quite totally opaque. Lighter than most porters, in fact. Nice creamy head with decent retention; good lacing remains.  Subtly smoky in both aroma and taste; this aspect doesn’t overwhelm the other flavors, instead blending with the roasted and lightly sweet notes very well. There are also touches of coffee and bittersweet chocolate. Faintly bitter and floral hop presence comes out mostly in the finish. I actually wanted a bit more of everything and found it just a little too light in the end flavor-wise.  Easy to drink, with a moderately creamy, medium-thin body and measured carbonation. A smoked beer for those who are a bit smoke-averse.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Smoked Porter,89
147,90,tzieser,3.63,"i reviewed this before but i think it was purged or something. whatever.  a: pours black in color, almost completely opaque with a thick and fluffy off-white head that sticks to the glass for quite some time.  s: pretty weak aroma with subtle notes of roasted malts. not much else to speak of. surprised there isn't more smoke in the nose.  t: lots of roasted malt flavor up front with a hint bittersweet chocolate and subtle hop grassy character. again, where's the smoke here? i understand the idea that you don't want this to be over the top smokey, but give me something to work with here. if you blind folded me i probably wouldn't have guessed this was a smoked porter. maybe this is just my rauchbier-loving side coming out, but this could've used a heavier hand on the smoked malt.  m: nice and smooth mouthfeel.  a solid porter that's pretty well balanced but i definitely wish there was more smoke flavor. give this a shot if you're looking for a good american-style porter but go buy some Schlenkerla if you're looking for something smokey.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Smoked Porter,89
147,90,Phelps,3.7,"Enjoy by date of Feb. 15, 2012. Poured into a goblet.  Bleak, for a porter. Brown and opaque as melted dark chocolate, with perhaps some amber hints at the edges. The half-finger of sand colored head descends to a thin top layer, leaving sticky fingers of lace.  Smells like smoky dark chocolate. I get notes of burnt sourdough bread, earthy hops, hints of raisins and seared pork. In the background is an odd, sourish tang.  Smoke drops in the flavor, replaced by fruit. Dried prune and chocolate syrup are major contributors, with just a touch of smoke. Earthy hops balance the stuff in a surprisingly clean finish.  The velvety medium body is big for a porter, but I like it. Carbonation is moderate, pinching, and creates some silky fizz. Clean, soft bitterness on the sides of the tongue.  Stone’s Smoked Porter isn’t outstanding, but it does display some well-integrated flavors. More like a porter with smoke as an afterthought than a smoked porter.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Smoked Porter,89
147,90,RedneckBeerz,4.25,"Poured from a bomber into a Beer Army pint glass and it is a dark clear brown with a 1+ finger light tan head that consumes itself fairly quickly to leave a nice thin lacing on the glass and atop the beer.  The aroma is slightly smokey, heavy dark malts.  The flavor follows the nose with minor smokiness and heavy dark malts. I must admit that thus far in my beer journey, I have not been attracted to ""smoked"" beers, but this one I like alot. The smokiness continues to come forward, but it's not as if you are drinking a beer with oak cinders in it.  The smokiness adds to the complexity and makes this beer well balanced. Medium heavy on the mouthfeel and medium light on the carbination make this a very nice brew. A very nice sipper, that is perfect on these cold windy winter days.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Smoked Porter,89
147,90,MCDuhamel,4.44,"Poured from a 22 ounce bomber into a British pub glass, perhaps a bit too cold at pour. Forms a 1 inch head that fades into an espresso cap very quickly. The liquor is mahogany, almost but not quite opaque, with a dark ruby showing when held against the light. The nose is dark fruit and a very subtle smokiness. The beer opens with a light coffee note that becomes more pronounced on the middle of the tongue, with a very balanced smokiness that complements and does not overpower the beer. There's a bit of roastiness toward the finish, with a nice, lingering hop bitterness at the very end. The beer feels fairly light. Really an outstanding beer that uses the smoke very cleverly to bring out other flavors.  I think this would pair very well with barbeque, most grilled meats, and most smoked meats. I would serve it a little toward the warmer side to let it be at its best.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Smoked Porter,89
147,90,Chico1985,4.2,"I've had this a bunch of times but never reviewed..  Pours very dark but overall translucent, tan head starts at about 2 fingers and sticks around as a thin cap leaving some lace.  Smoke is big in the scent, cocoa/caramel and some decent hoppage. Hints towards a smoke bomb.  It is definitely still smoke forward but toned down from the scent, the taste is more balanced. Dark chocolate, roasted malt, caramel and a bit of hop bitterness all nicely meld with smoky malts. Feels a bit high on the carbonation but overall quite smooth. Very robust but drinkability isn't affected too much, a bomber solo may get tiring but a 12oz isn't a problem at all.  If you like smoky beers and porters this is a no-brainer. A classic for the style that also separates itself from the pack and one of the many go-to beers in Stone's lineup.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Smoked Porter,89
147,90,Hopfenpeter,3.68,"The beer poured a deep brown with sone red shining through when held into the light. A tan bubbly head builds about one and a haf fingers high and leaves good lacing. The smell is of roasted malts and chocolate. Tasting the beer, I expected more smokiness out of this beer. Up front there was the roasted malts with coffee and chocolate coming out in the middle. The end was almost a little citrus hops. A medium to light bodied porter which is nicely done, but could have been a little more smokier for my taste.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Smoked Porter,89
147,90,BucannonXC5,4.1,"Poured from a 22-oz. bottle into a pint glass. Color was very dark, but more brown than black. Reddish looks in there, too. A bit more than an inch of head, that lasted for awhile. Nice coat of bubbly lacing on the top. Frosty tan film on the sides of the glass.  First smell was an almost even whiff of chocolate and coffee. On the second whiff, coffee seemed to be the overwhelming note. Caramel and toffee contributed to the nose.  Initial taste was dark chocolate, which seemed to be the middle marker of coffee and chocolate. Also some smoky, roasty malts. Nice and smooth.  Medium-to-full body. Slick texture. Soft-to-average carbonation. Long, smooth finish. Smokiness ruled the day here.  A decent beer overall, but I have to say the taste and feel let me down a bit.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Smoked Porter,89

T: Somewhat underwhelming. Don't get me wrong, it is nice but a little lighter than expected. Smokiness is very light and offers an umami element. woodiness, cola spice, bitter.  M: A little too thin and dry for my taste. Okay.  D: Good. Would happily enjoy or offer to others.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Smoked Porter,89
147,90,StonedTrippin,4.4,"this beer kicks ass, so damn good! pours black like a starless night and has a one inch lacing tan head. smells like a rauchbier, smokey as a raging bonfire, and roasty dark malty like a sturdy american stout. flavor is less intense than the nose, but its rich in the mouth without being too much. smokey again, with mellow hop bitterness in the finish. i cant do this beer justice in words, but i had the middle ages smoked porter 3 days ago and this absolutely destroys what i thought was an excellent beer. this is epic. so smooth and full bodied, but the aftertaste and the bellyfeel make this one of the best porters of all time. well done again by stone!!!",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Smoked Porter,89

147,90,jkanavel,4.06,"Had this more than once at Lucky Baldwins is Pasadena. 5 dollars a pint. WHAT???? (Cherumbim is the raddest server ever)  A: One of the most attractive aspects of this beer is the inky blackness of it, topped with the mocha head that clings all the down the glass, right until the last swallow.  S: Mocha, baking chocolate, campfire, pancake syrup, and malt, with a touch of spiciness.  T: sweet malty goodness, very light smoke profile and rich mocha, not too strong on the hops, but good balance from the bitter toasted grain component.  M: Smooth as silk. Light carbonation makes this go down like chocolate milk almost.  O: This is an old standby for me. Not a great summer brew, but when the weather starts turning ugly this becomes one of my favorite session beers.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Smoked Porter,89

A: Pours dark black but transparent on the edges with amber hues and a generous light tan/mocha colored head. Good lace.  S: Subdued smoke, roast coffee at the forefront, roasted malts, light smoked wood, milk chocolate notes. Very balanced and not too in-your-face.  T: Smoked malts, roasted character, light astringency and smoky dryness...definitely a subdued smoke presence, and I like that. Light earthy hop bitterness on the middle and back of the tongue.  MF: Medium mouthfeel, moderate bitterness, creamy and smooth...lingering dryness.

147,90,aorloski,3.65,"Appearance - Dark brown / black with a nice mocha two finger head.  Aroma - Smoked malts, some coffee and chocolate in the backbone  Taste - A little light for me. Tasted like a light stout with little defining characteristics, was hoping for a deeper rich malty smokiness in it. Still holds up though, some nice coffee and chocolate notes.  Mouthfeel - Thin, decently carbonated.  Overall - not my favorite stone brew but definitely worth a shot!",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Smoked Porter,89
147,90,brandon911,4.42,"Served into a regular water glass while playing poker.  The beer was a dark brown with a two finger tan head.  Smelled very malty, a little smoky, with some coffee and chocolate notes present. I loved how this smelled, I think I'd like a room to smell like this.  Fantastic taste. Smoky with a fairly heavy coffee taste and some hints of chocolate.  I loved this mouthfeel of this. Perfect amount of carbonation and just creamy enough.

147,90,matttttYCE,3.98,"Stone pint glass.  The head is initially about 2 and a half fingers high, light tan in color, and creamy I'd say. Head fades gradually leaving some nice lacing behind. Color of the beer is a dark, dark brown with deep medium brown and ruby hints when held to the light.  The aroma is of lighter roasted/smoked malts, burnt coffee, dark chocolate, and a bit of woodsy smoke. Hints of vanilla in the background.  The taste offers a bit more obvious smoke, char, and burnt malts, but it's still on the lighter side. Aside from that there's roasted malts, dark roast coffee, dark chocolate, maybe a bit of caramel, and hints of smoked meat, with some hops on the finish but not much. Nice touch.  Mouthfeel is a bit lacking I think. If anything it's more average than lacking but I would have liked it be a bit more full. Consistency is smooth for sure, carbonation is light, body is light, and the finish is moderately lasting. Like I said, I would have liked the body to be a bit more full, not as light and thin as it was.  Overall this is good porter. Not my favorite, or with the best mouthfeel, but a good tasting porter nonetheless. In fact, as far as taste goes, it's up there pretty high, but the feel takes it down a bit for me. I'll give it one thing, though, it's quite drinkable. And at the ABV, it could be close to a more full flavored session type beer.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Smoked Porter,89

147,90,Durge,3.88,"A dark brown color, pretty much opaque with a decent light creamy tan head and good lacing. The aroma is surprisingly vague with just the suggestion of some herbal malt and a whisper of charcoal. No smoke whatsoever. The flavor again does not bring an obvious smoke either but there is a little grassy smoke and more mild charcoal malt. There’s a citrus tartness that nearly defines this brew which surprises me greatly considering it’s a smoked brew. This is a medium bodied brew with tiny bits of carbonation and a near resinous, yet glassy smooth feel. It’s a quality brew in feel but I bought this for a smoke taste experience and it’s so subtle as to really be nothing that warrants a smoke title. This brew is just a decent porter that features grassy hops and tart citrus over mild charcoal malt. Good, but ultimately a disappointment.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Smoked Porter,89
147,90,tylerss20,4.23,"Wow. I finally tried this stuff. Picked up a bomber from Jasper’s in Nashua. Pours like oil, black and completely opaque. Cream colored one finger head that recedes quickly. Vanilla, caramel, coffee, and maybe licorice (?) in the aroma. Full bodied mouthfeel, roasty malt character, chocolate, medium sweetness, smokiness, and just a bit of hop on the backend.

T: Burnt coffee, burnt caramel, roasted malt... just right. M: Medium to full bodied, just what I would expect for a porter and not too heavy/filling.

My favorite smoked porter so far.  M - Medium body, good level of carbonation for the style, and a drying finish.  O - Overall a very nice beer. I could see myself drinking this regularly.

S- Smells smoky, has a slight burnt malt smell, along with some roasted wood chips. Slight burnt coffee smell. I really like the smell.  T- Dark and crisp, but the smokey tasted seems to kind of overpower anything else going on in there. Tastes like it would go great with some barbecue. To be honest, I feel like the flavor isn't really quite as good as Stone's IPA or Arrogant Bastard. Seems to be more one dimensional.  M- Silky, velvet feel a bit creamy too. Perfect carbonation. Heavy, but manages to remain smooth.  O- I think everything about this beer is great, except for the taste.

The smoke is very dominant in the taste of this beer which is what you want in a smoked porter, however there seems to be a lack of balance. There is a slight estery taste, but it is very subtle and is gone almost as soon as the palate detects it. As the beer warms in the glass the toffee starts to become more pronounced.

S - Smelled deep, smoked malts. Faint trace of hops in the smell. It was an excellent, if singular, smell.  T - The roasted/smoked malts really hit you up front (some coffee flavors, perhaps). There's a bit of boozyness in the taste as well, but nothing distracting. There are some hop flavors as well.  M - Medium to full bodied; carbonation levels are nice. Smooth aftertaste, which is nice considering the smoked malts...very easy-drinking.  O - I enjoyed the Stone Smoked Porter, it's another unique beer from Stone.

147,90,gengoro,4.45,"Temp - 65 F Glass - Tulip  A) Smooth aromatic pour with a deep mahogany color. Gentle carbonation with about 3mm of foam. I really enjoyed the dark color and soft carbonation, but I am partial to cask style porters.  S) A deep roasted aroma greets you as you approach the glass. The aroma is completely dominated by a deep malt aroma... while others could argue subtleties, I enjoyed the well balanced malty character of this beer's aroma. Not a trace of hops in the aroma.  T) Characteristic of Stone, this beer has an astonishingly complete flavor profile. This beer does not renege on its promise of a deep malt flavor. The aroma blends into the initial portion of the flavor perfectly and the malt persists through the entire experience. A slight hint of booziness greets you at the end of the mid-range, but for me this was a happy reminder. In my mind the thick flavor of a porter is well designed to mask a higher ABV than is afforded by less flavorful beers.  M) Smooth and refreshing, this beer was very easy to drink. Ideally, this beer would be a slight heavier... but I could be mistaken. This beer is easy to drink and has a very pleasant mouthfeel.  O) At $3.99, this is an excellent value. This beer is an exceptionally good porter and for the price... is awesome. My heart has been captured by Clown Feet's Lubrication, but given Stone's availability and price... this could easily be a close second. I will be buying this again.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Smoked Porter,89

Smell: The smokiness comes through strong in the smell with the roast of the barley and the hop presence being made known.  Taste: The taste evolved as I drank the beer, which is something that I love in a good brew. It started out with the hops coming through very strong, but after drinking it more, the malty flavors came into fruition to balance the hops nicely.  Mouthfeel: A creamy medium body with a good amount of carbonation.  Overall: This is a very good porter.

147,90,Cavery,3.92,"750ml I had in the cellar for about 6 months, I didn't really have anything I felt comfortable cracking at the moment, so I pulled this out of the case.  A: Deep cherry jam with suggestion of blacks. Looks like the color of expensive shoes, post polish. Some coffee cream film and head that rose modestly to about a finger before leaving connect the dots lacing around the walls of the glass. Definitely has a dark iced tea or iced coffee look.  S: Sweet smokey sauces that have been licked by a savory woody flame. light tangy barbecue note that suggests some sort of sweet cooked sugar sauce. The smoke has really mellowed out of the nose, a more sugary character of the malt now seems to be more forward. Sweet sugary barbecued carrots.  T: Taste is sweet and slightly tangy with a dancing note of mellowed smoke. It's kind of like having a steak sauce on some charred barbecue veggies. Sweet with a light bitterness that seems to be more from the roast than from hops, but I could be wrong. Flavor seems really mellow and toned down from fresh, still quite good.  M: light medium body with a bit of favoritism towards the lighter side. A tad bit of astringency follows the smokiness, but the flavor gets to live out a decent life beforehand. Some low grade sandpaper feels that aren't my favorite, but I can't really hold it against the beer, considering it was an experimental aging.  O: I liked it, don't think I like it as much as fresh, but I do appreciate the direction the beer is going. Having done this, I don't think this will hold up in the mouth beyond a year. I get a lot more licorice like flavor than I can ever remember getting in this fresh, but it's more or less flavor that's remnant of former smokiness. This isn't going to dethrone Alaskan Smoked porter for aging, but I can see it being a worthy experiment.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Smoked Porter,89
147,90,ahq514,3.96,"Poured from 22 oz bottle into tulip glass.  Pours a nice healthy head thats a good two fingers. Just a shade lighter than black. Seems to have a nice, low carbonation. Very nice lacing.  Aroma is a little weaker than I imagined. From what I can smell, I'm getting pretty much all chocolate covered coffee beans with a little bit of roast. Smoke is there in the background, but it smells more like a standard porter.  Taste is stronger than the aroma. Starts off with a nice smokiness that transitions into a dry, bitter roastiness, a little bit of hoppiness in the mix as well. Finish is a nice smooth chocolateyness. I like the flavors in this beer, but they don't mix together like I would like. They're very distinguished flavors that just don't combine like I think they should.  Pretty nice medium body, but a little lighter than I would have thought. Nice low carbonation. Very drinkable.  Overall, I thought this beer was nice, but not something I would really seek out again. I like porters or stouts with a nice smoky character, but this one was too subtle. The smoke was barely detectable. It was a solid porter though.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Smoked Porter,89
147,90,matjack85,4.36,"Sal's Liquors in Addison, IL just started carrying a wide assortment of Stone products, so I picked up this 22oz brown bottle along with some other Stone selections for $4.49 each.  The beer poured a dark brown color that turned to mahogany when held to the light. 3 full fingers of fluffy light brown head hung around for so long I was getting impatient waiting to drink it. Lots of lacing clung to the glass with each sip.  The beer had a rich roasted malt smell, along with some dark fruits, and coffee.  Big mocha coffee flavor along with some sweet caramel and toffee. There is a good bitterness as well (53 IBU's) to keep everything balanced. Really didn't pick up any smoke until the finish. Nice bitter finish as well.  Medium bodied with only moderate carbonation which keeps it smooth and creamy.  This is a very well made and enjoyable porter.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Smoked Porter,89
147,90,Rschis16,4.2,"Nearly pitch black with dark ruby undertones. Big 3 finger tan head that dissapates slowly, leaving a uniformly patchy lacing down the glass as it goes. Big dollop of foam left on top. Smells of smoky dark roasted malts and creamy coffee. Hints of chocolate hit the nose behind it. Dark dried fruits bring it around to a very balanced nose, and very appetizingly.  Full and rich flavor of dark roasted malts. Coffee-like bitterness attached to the malts that touches all parts of the palate. Very balanced overall, as just a hint of barely sweet dried fruit touches the front of the tongue. Dark chocolate is hidden, but detectable in an off-hand way. The coffee bitterness and mouthfeel is where this beer succeeds. Lingering mouthfeel of coffee and dark roasted malts stays for a long time, enticing you into another sip. The mouthfeel is surprisingly light and airy for such a richly flavored beer. At the same time there is a certain heaviness to it though, probably from the heavy handed use of ingredients Stone is known for. The carbonation is on the higher side as well, giving a little zip to the coffee flavors. This accentuates the flavors in a very positive way, especially for the lighter sweetness that quickly gives way to the bitterness. This is a very good porter, and obviously another quality beer from Stone.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Smoked Porter,89
147,90,FosterJM,3.82,"836th Review on BA Bottle to Stone Pint 22oz  Purchased from Stone on Zwanze2011 day  App- A medium colored brown with a darker middle. A one finger head with 0 cling and stick to it.  Smell- A bit of light campfire, roasted pine nuts and some burnt toast. A bit malty and dry and a touch of bitter hops. I shouldn't like this smell, but I do.  Taste- Dry, roast, smoke, pepper and large porter notes. This really hits you with flavors all over the place. It's very good for what it is. I know this is a smoked porter. It isn’t my favorite style and I’m going to rate it more to style than preference and go high with a 4. This actually showed a lot of temperance and balance.  Mouth- Lighter medium bodied and a light to medium carbonation. More of a roasty and nutty residual flavor.  Drink- I will say it is one of the better in the “smoked” arena. It's just not a favorite of mine. Not gonna bash and give low grade. Still a good beer, because I believe I would enjoy the vanilla variation.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Smoked Porter,89

Thin tight rings of lace mark the glass on the drink down. Smell is of roasted malt, smoked malt, and some rich dark toasted bread aromas. Taste is of roasted/smoked malt, toasted bread, and some minor cocoa bean flavors. There is an assertive roasty bitterness that sticks around after each sip.

Taste is similar, cherry esters and a moderate hop bitterness that brings out smokiness in the finish. Malt is chocolate and a bit roasty.  Mouthfeel is smooth and a bit oily, with low carbonation. Makes for a fairly easy drinking mouthfeel.

A: Pours a three finger head of fair cream, good thickness, and good retention. The head colour is a slight tan. Colour is a solid black. It's generally appealing.  Sm: Slight rauchbier smoke, caramelized malt, a bit of roast, and light bacon. A mild strength aroma.  T: Light roast, some smoke, caramelized malt, and a bit of bacon. A bit simple compared to expectations. It's well balanced, though. I do like it.  Mf: Smooth and wet, suiting the flavours. It's a touch too thick.  Dr: Very drinkable for a smoked beer, but a bit too malty. It's got an average ABV and a high price. I don't think I'd have it again.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Smoked Porter,89

Roasted malts, wood smoke, and chocolate all get a play here. There's enough hops to balance and add a welcomed bitterness to the finish. As the beer warms figs, dates, warm fruit becomes noticeable with a little licorice. Mouthfeel is full bodied, smooth, and incredibly drinkable.

Great balance of malty sweetness with a hint of smoke. The low abv of this beer makes me think in colder months you could possibly session this beer. Cheers",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Smoked Porter,89
147,90,StarshipPoopers,4.36,"A - What a beautiful looking beer. Deep and opaque black which only lets hints of light through around the edges. I tried pouring this as softly as I could and it still produced about 3 inches of off-white and pillowy head. Retention dies down to a smooth coat over the surface, with tons of lacing.  S - Smells like your normal porter. Smells fresh, with hints of cold coffee and milk chocolate. Smoke presence is extremely faint.  T - Very interesting, diverts from the nose. In the front of the palate is a milk chocolate sweetness with a hint of roasted malts, this is quickly overtaken by full-bodied dark fruits (definite black cherry vibe to it, I agree with others that it doesn't really taste like licorice.) Lastly, the finish is dominated by rich coffee and lingering dark fruit, with traces of smokiness becoming very pronounced toward the end. The aftertaste is quite rich and long-lasting, in a good way (not sticky, not sweet). Very solid for a porter, shows more complexity in the flavour than most  M/D - Medium bodied, mellows out after 15 minutes or so. The explosion of carbonation that begins while pouring isn't reflected in the final product, which is quite smooth. Very appealing with great drinkability (not in the sense of being easy drinking, but for enjoyability and the length of the finish).  O - I'd say this is worthy of an A. It gives you a nice amount of layers and rich, full-bodied flavours that you might expect to find in a heavier stout, without betraying the style.  I let my bottle sit for a couple of months, and it may have been an older bottle, not sure. Judging from a lot of the reviews I'm reading, I assume a little bit of age might have mellowed it out a bit and brought through more of the flavours.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Smoked Porter,89

Smell: Rich aroma of dark roasted malts with some good hints of chocolate and coffee. Smoke is pretty subdued. Also some hints of caramel and dark fruits. The dark malts stand out in the aroma.  Taste: Sweet dark roasted malts up front is followed by some chocolate and coffee. Some burnt toast and a light amount of smoke. Light hints of dark fruits which add some sweetness. Finishes with a mild bitterness.  Mouthfeel: Medium bodied with a moderate level of carbonation. Very creamy and smooth.  Overall: A very good version of a porter.

147,90,readbaron,3.62,"pours a cloudy dark brown with plentiful tan foam head (four fingers)  smell is good - complex - sweet malts, some bready malts, a bit of dark fruit/molasses, and a healthy dose of char.  Taste is less complex than the nose - lots and lots of char, a bit of malt, and a bit of sweetness.  Mouthfeel is dissapointing - over carbonated. Accentuates the char.  Overall - a solid beer. Not overly smokey like some beers of the style can be.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Smoked Porter,89
147,90,JohnnyChicago,3.82,"Split a 22oz bottle; poured into a pint glass.  A: Proper porter color and decent amount of head that sticks around for a little while.  S: Black coffee, dark cocoa, cereal malts. There is definitely a slight hint of smoke as well.  T: Crisp but heavy. The cocoa beats out the coffee notes on the tongue. Any sort of smokiness that was present in the nose is absent from the taste.  D: Stander porter strength and standard porter balance, its easy going down.  Overall: A middle-of-the-road porter from a usually exceptional brewery. I can't help but feel that they had the opportunity to make a super-duper smokey porter and instead opted to make something nearly right along the guidelines...oh well. It's solid stuff anyway.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Smoked Porter,89

The smoke shows up in the finish and is a bit more noticable than the smell. The bottle says look for notes of licorice, dark fruit, and caramel. I'm getting a little caramel in the beginning, and some dark fruit with the smoke. Not getting the licorice flavors. M- Initially medium-high carbonation, but it smooths out in the taste and finishes relatively creamy. I would say medium for style body, maybe a little light.

Smells very roasty. Smoke and char in the nose. Deep roasted malt flavors. Smoky, with a hint of bitterness. Slight cola and mineral aftertaste, with something that reminds me of toasted marshmallows. A nice carbonation and medium body keeps it from being too heavy, and is superbly drinkable.

Great smokey malt flavors with a well-balanced chocolate and ""breakfast"" flavor. This beer would go great with some bacon and eggs. Mouthfeel is medium bodied with a creamy finish.

147,90,JohnnyP3,4.23,"1pt .6 fl oz bottle poured into a goblet. I cannot find any kind of freshness date on this bottle anywhere. Looked at Stone's website and where they show the enjoy by date should be and I don't see anything. Purchased from La Bodega in Anchorage. When I popped the cap on this bottle it almost sounded like a gun went off. Poured a very dark red/brown, almost black with some lighter hues on the edges. Nice creamy tan head of about 2-3 fingers that slowly simmers down. Nice lacing on the glass from where the head simmers down.  The nose is not extremely aromatic at first. Not getting a lot of hop aromas in the smell. More indications of a strong malt backbone. We'll see on the taste. Maybe a mild hint of some watery smoke. After letting this breath a little, the smells come out more. A pleasant roasted/coffee malt smell along with some grass from the hops for balance.  The taste rebounds nicely! Nice roasted malt backbone. Coffee and bitter dark chocolate abound with a bit of smoke and earth on the finish. I can also detect some licorice and caramel. I have not picked up the dark fruits yet that are mentioned on the bottle. Ok, wait, they are there a little--plum? By the way, if I had read the bottle first and the recommendation to try this with a PB&J, I would have saved this or bought another for lunch tomorrow! I've got to say the smoke is just perfect on this. It is by no means a smoky beer, but what smoke there is is a beautiful exclamation point on the end of this porter. I would love to try this with some BBQ ribs. And I'm sure I will. What a well balanced, complex and rich porter.  Mouthfeel was rich, smooth and creamy. Nicely carbonated for the style and blends well with the richness. Runs through the mouth like velvet.  Overall, this is an outstanding porter. The fact that it is 5.9%ABV makes it all the more impressive. Stone made a nuanced, flavor-packed winner without going into the abv stratosphere.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Smoked Porter,89

S: Smells of dark roasted malts, a hint of smokiness and a little bit of bitterness. It's surprisingly subtle for a Stone product.  T/M: A medium to high amount of carbonation and a relatively light body for a dark beer. More roasted malt becomes prominent in the flavor with just a touch of char as well as a faint hint of unsweetened chocolate near the end.  It's not nearly as full flavored as their other offerings.

The back end carries a nice amount of coffee and finishes with the perfect amount of bitter chocolate  Mouthfeel: Medium body and carbonation.

T&M - Hits your mouth with little carbonation and builds up to a be super crisp, very well carbonated beer just as the sweet smokey malts smoothly transition to a hopped coffee finish.  O - Overall a great beer, I prefer a few other porters to this one such as Anchor, and was a little disappointed on the aroma, but for being a brew with the word ""Smoked"" in its name, what more can you expect?

147,90,jondeelee,3.6,"Stone's Smoked Porter doesn't smell smoky, as the name might suggest. Instead, the brew is marked by sweeter aromas, including pineapple, apricot, and cane sugar. There is a certain amount of smokiness to these sugars, and so the aromas are much like you'd get after lightly grilling fruit on a wood-burning barbecue. All of these sweet aromas rest atop a layer of cereal-like toasted grains.  On the tongue, the beer switches gears completely, and the smokiness begins to shine through. Sweeter flavors are still present, including pear, apple, fig, and white grape. However, they are accompanied by a liquid smoke/charcoal layer that almost takes over the mouthful. Coffees and anise seed abound. The aftertaste is more smoke and bitterness, and lingers for quite a while. Mouthfeel is medium-light, and carbonation is medium.  Overall, this is an interesting beer, but in my opinion the smokiness should have been toned down a notch or two, as it can prove overwhelming and slightly off-putting.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Smoked Porter,89
147,90,output01x,3.88,"Poured from a 22 oz. bottle (Enjoy By 10/01/11) into an imperial pint glass.  A strong pour yields a 2-finger cream-colored head that slowly dissipates to a bubbly, thick mess. The body is a translucent mahogany that borders on black. Thick globs of foam stick to the sides of the glass like sporadically applied spray foam insulation.  Dark roasted malts with notes of espresso and wood smoke comprise the majority of the nose. Spicy, earthy hops are also present.  Roasted coffee beans and milk chocolate with just a touch of nuttiness forms a great start to each sip of this beer. A dry smokiness then flows into a dry coffee aftertaste that really suits this beer perfectly. Honestly, I would prefer the flavors to be a bit bolder, but they are excellent considering the 5.9% ABV.  Medium bodied with excellent carbonation, this beer sticks around for just the right amount of time.

Very dark, almost black with red highlights around the edges where the light shines through. The head isn't huge, but lasts and lasts; it's a creamy khaki color. Good looking ale.  The aroma is of dark roasted malt with an espresso note and some smoke. The flavor is similar with an espresso bitterness followed by a smokey and slightly bitter finish.  The mouth feel is medium and not watery at all. For me a watery mouth feel is the kiss of death for a porter. Stone Smoked Porter feels just right.  Overall, Smoked Porter is a very good, maybe even great, porter. Having it from a growler made it even more special. Four of us split it, two guys and two gals. Everyone claimed to really enjoy it.

147,90,Wreckoncile,4.05,"Served into Arrogant Bastard pint glass (fizzy yellow beer is for wussies)  A - Deep chocolatey brown to near black. Gave me three fingers of deep head that sticks around for quite sometime and leaves a network of lacing around the glass.  S - Scents of a roasted nuttiness, almost like a hazelnut coffee even. Smoke it faint, but there. Not overpowering at all.  T - An initial creamish flavor with some light notes of nut and coffee that lets in a very brief and very short lived smokiness at the very end of the profile.  M - The mouthfeel might've been my favorite aspect of this beer. A creamy, almost malty (think like malted chocolate milkshake) mouthfeel that is just very inviting, but has just the right amount of carbonation to let the flavors it features tickle the tongue.  O - The smokiness is actually far more muted than I expected on a smoked porter, but I might be biasing the review by expecting a higher smokiness. The smoke is definitely there, but not inyoface. A good offering that would go remarkably well with a bbqed brisket. I'll revisit this again sometime soon.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Smoked Porter,89

This is $(*$&ing amazing.  O: I never knew I would like smokey beers. I tried DFH palo santo once and I DPed it, but after having an east india porter from pretty things, I gained a taste for it and now I'm kinda hooked.

Taste is classic, clean roasted maltiness. Smoke is subdued, not overpowering, slight. A little hop on the end. Flavor is big but with a refreshing, smooth carbonated mouthfeel. Smoke comes alive as it warms. Has a surprising lightness. Excellent porter. The smokiness and bit of hop bite raise the bar on this one. Dry and a little sour/bitter on the finish. This would be a PERFECT dessert beer. The roast and smoke would offset sweetness nicely.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Smoked Porter,89

This is a good looking beer, one that would invite onlookers to try some. It looks like dark walnut wood work with a tan head. The smell is a gorgeous mingling of roasted malt and alcohol. I love the flavor, the smoky malt is offset by just enough hops to make their presense known. The mouthfeel is so good, this beer would still be enjoyable if I had a bad cold. Overall, this beer is a winner with me and I would reserve it for special occasions as a novel treat.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Smoked Porter,89

The smell is mostly of chocolate, roasted malts, and some caramel, oddly I don't get much smoked smell. Mouth feel is nice, medium thickness with expected carbonation. The taste is very good, more flavor than I expected, here the smoke flavor is present, I taste smoked roasted malts, a slightly burned flavor and there is some hoppiness on the way down, very nice.

Big, dark, khaki brown head and plenty of lacing down the glass. A near perfect appearance.  Roasted malts and chocolate in the nose, though there isn't a big smoke aroma, which is a bit surprising.  There's plenty of smoke flavor though, which is a nice addition to the roasted malts and chocolate. A good amount of hops balance things out, making this a relatively bitter, roasty, smoky stout.

Rich roasted aroma is quite subdued, I was expecting the rich roasted aroma but in a much grander style.  The taste is fuller than the aroma which is more of what I expected, a rich roasted malt taste that's laden with dark chocolates with a very light hint of the remains of a summer bonfire coming to mind with each drink.  A light woody dark chocolate dryish aftertaste lasts a short while but is thoroughly enjoyable, I do wish I had a few more of these.

It stays a porter by not being roasty. Hints of chocolate and tobacco.  Enough depth in body to support the flavors. Nicely carbonated.

Was expecting a more overpowering nose given it's a Stone beer but was pleasantly surprised with the nice blend of hops, subtle smoke and roast coffee. Smoke comes through again on the palate along with some fairly serious bitterness. Personally I prefer my porters a little more thick and chocolatey. For me this is a touch thin on malt body considering the forward bitterness.  Overall a good beer and one to share. Bomber is way too much for me.

Mild coffee grounds.  The taste was very reflective of the aroma. Dark chocolate was evident also. Molasses hints as well as the mild coffee, sugar cones, and prunes. Finished with a semi-dry bitterness. There was not too much of any component and they worked wonderfully together.

147,90,Arknot,2.94,"I was very excited to try this beer after a local brewery had a smoked IPA... I wanted more smoke! I love Stone so I figured this would be a good place to start...  Appearance is dark... basicly black juice. Smell is chocolate/coffee/roast I'm working on a bomber now, and at first I had maybe half a finger of head in my sniffer glass. But on my thrid (and final) pour I have zero head. My beer honestly looks like a glass of ink. Also, zero lacing. The head bubbled out like a glass of diet coke.  Taste is a let down, I was expecting smoke.. I got zero smoke. Maybe my taste buds suck, but I'm being honest here, I didn't taste smoke! Ok maybe a little.. if I imagine it. Other then that its a pretty mild porter. Chocolate/coffee with a mix roasted malts.  Mouthfeel is blah, not smooth, not rough. The roast sticks around on the tongue like you'd expect from a porter or stout.  Overall, I enjoyed this beer.. Its a good solid porter, and nothing more. But sadly my expectations were let down.

147,90,mjn5036,3.53,"On tap.  A – Served to me in a pint glass. The beer appears to be a light brown, Coca-Cola in color, with a small off-white head that dissipates in no time. A ring of lacing hangs about on the perimeter of the glass. With each swig of the glass, a new ring of lacing is left in its wake.  S – Roasted grains and caramel malts. Strong notes of caramel and a nice nuttiness.  T – Malt forward, roasted notes come on strong with a light smokiness that lingers. A bit of caramel and another unidentified sweetness, reminiscent of coconut are noticed. A morsel of hops add another dimension to the brew.  M – A bit thicker than I had thought it would be, based on the initial appearance. Quite smooth.  O – A reasonably drinkable porter that seemed to pair well with a slice of cheesecake.

147,90,bamadog,3.88,"I had this on tap about a year and a half ago, and it's been more than readily available on the shelves to me for the last 6 years, but I've just never gotten around to sitting down to review it. Review is from notes taken on 5/21/2011 and poured from the bottle to a snifter.  Appearance: Pour is a dark, coffee brown/near black with just the faintest hint of a dark mahogany highlight at the base of the glass; starts with a solid, one finger, creamy tan head with decent retention; head eventually fades to a thin wispy skim with a thicker ring around the surface; body is dark, nearly entirely opaque; lots of lacing left behind in patches and smaller spots -- kind of reminds me of what a map of Minnesota's lakes may look like.  Smell: Smell is good, but not quite as robust as I would like it to be; there is a dark, bitter roasty coffee-like scent with a firm backing of the peaty, smokiness that has a touch of salty meat to it; bit of an earthy, grassiness lies underneath it all.  Taste: Quite good, but not quite as good as it was when I managed to have it on tap; a nice burnt roastiness that is reminiscent of dark coffee; solid smokiness as well that isn't overwhelming, but very complimentary (which is where I think this beer is a real winner); touch of bittersweet baker's chocolate underneath all of it and there is faint hint of a grassy hoppiness underneath it all as well.  Mouthfeel: Body is a little thinner than what I prefer, but still good, and it comes across smooth and creamy as the carbonation is present, but soft and fitting of the style; a thin, moist stickiness is left dripping on the palate.  Overall: This is a really good beer, and definitely worth having. I like the recommendation of having it with some grilled/bbq'd food as it would probably be amazing, but it's certainly good on its own as well. Solid flavors and a body that is good as well, but not too heavy and an ABV that isn't going to blow you away, easily one that could be enjoyed for the course of an entire evening.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Smoked Porter,89

Gorgeous clear dark red body with wonderful red ruby hues, I love this color it looks just wonderful.  Bouquet is a nice roast and coffee at first then gives way to some smoky meat character like jerky salts, a small hint of sweet brown sugar but very small.  Taste is slight jerk roast meat, but not incredibly salty. Very much rauchbier light in a sense. There is a neat spicy hop finish on this also on the swallow. Heat and expansive in the palate while drinking, my palate feels warm and hot almost hot sauce in feel and seems to grow.  Overall great drinkability, fits in with grilled meats like crazy.

Some chocolate comes out on the palate along with roasty malts and a tiny bit more smoke, which is in no way as enjoyable when compared to the Schlenkerla Marzen I just had yesterday.  The mouthfeel is the best thing about this beer. The moderate carbonation and the way the beer feels on the palate is on point. I just wish the flavor was more substantial.

The aroma was was bold to say the least. It had a strong scent of roasted caramel malts, a leathery yeast with a subtle smokey odor and had notes of dark roasted coffee, dark chocolate, and a touch of raisons.  It tasted wonderfully lightly bitter-sweet with nice notes of dark chocolate, caramel and dried fruit in the beginning then became a tad more on the bitter coffee side and had a mild smokey finish that was left lingering on the palate for a really nice long time.  Mouthfeel was medium to full in body (I am leaning more towards full) and smooth and creamy in texture with a nice light soft carbonation.  Overall this was an awesome brew.

147,90,BarryMFBurton,3.4,"I am definitely on a Stone kick at the moment. For good reason though – they make great beer. Here we have their Smoked Porter, which I haven’t really heard about. I have high expectations for it, though, due to the fact that Stone makes my favorite brews (and because it was $7+ for the bomber). Here it goes:  A: Dark coffee brown. A hint of light comes through, showing amber undertones. A thick, dark tan head rises large, covering a good 3+ fingers off the pour. Sticky lacing stays all around the glass to the last drink.  S: Surprisingly fruity – something cooked, though, like a baked apple. Sweet caramel and chocolate dominate the nose after, giving this stout an inviting presence even before the first drink.  T: Hmmmm. Much different than the nose. The yeasty breads are what hit you first, giving that chewy biscuit tone. This sets the stage for a big, smoky hit of roasted malts. This is where it falls short, in my opinion. The smokiness is there, but restrained (especially when you consider that this is called “Smoked Porter”). Chocolate and milky mocha tones soon take charge, leaving the smoke of the palate as relatively forgettable. The fruit that I felt in the nose comes in the form of the hoppy finish – hints of candied grapes and apples (and all things caramelized, for that matter). Not bad, but not great.  M: To be honest, it’s a bit watery for a porter. Maybe it’s because it’s 5.9% ABV, but its thin nature doesn’t sit well with me. It’s not terrible – I would have expected better from the Stone boys, though.  O: Well, it’s my least favorite Stone offering so far – that’s not to say it’s a terrible beer, though. Comparing Stone beers is like comparing the Indiana Jones movies: they’re all good in their own special way, but still, some are just not great. For now, I’ll stick to IRS and Oaked AB for my Stone brews of choice.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Smoked Porter,89
147,90,tekn0ph1sh,3.73,I want to love this beer. Its a classic porter. Poured into a tulip glass. It is dark brown almost black with a little head. More of A ring around the outer edge of the glass. The little ring is strong and leaves pretty decent lacing considering there is so little of it. It reminds me of Guinness. The smoke flavor is overpowering and I think it hides the flavor of an excellent porter. Maybe I will be able to find just a Stone Porter.,Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Smoked Porter,89
147,90,MbpBugeye,3.01,Appearance This beer sports a tall tan head and lots of lacing. A thick dollop hangs around almost forever.  Aroma This is indeed smokey. There is a nice deep fruitiness that hides beneath. Plenty of licorice is there too. Chocolate comes out and gives me something to actually enjoy.  Taste Lots of smoke blankets chocolate and dark fruits. A grassy and pine hopping brings out a bitter finish.  Mouthfeel Pretty much medium across the board. Medium carbonation and medium body. The finish is ashy and dry.  Overall Not really my thing. The high level of smoke and sturdy hopping make this a bitter Porter.,Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Smoked Porter,89
147,90,BeerFMAndy,4.23,"22 oz bottle split and poured into a Bruery tulip. 5.9% ABV, ""Keep Refridgerated"", no date.  A - Clear through the pour, dark mahogany brown topped by a two-finger tan head. Great retention and collar after collar of wispy lace.  S - Delicious smokey hints elevate the roasted malt nicely. Chocolate bittersweet with a great balance quality to it. Smoked very nicely.  T - Peat-smoked chocolate malt is pretty strong but not over-the-top. Roasted chocolate, bittersweet, flavorful. Green, resiny hop finish to balance it all out.  M - Dry roasted acrid bitterness with a dry finish. Moderately carbonated with a medium body and bitter finish.  O - Stone's Smoked Porter is nice and drinkable for how smokey it is and how flavorful it is, too. Overall, a very nice brew.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Smoked Porter,89
147,90,Fatehunter,3.95,"Poured into a snifter. Almost black with a good inch and half of tan head that held strong.  Smells of smoke (obviously) and a lot of rich malt, ripe dark fruit and chocolate. The smoke compliments here, not dominating.  It tastes like a porter with an undercurrent of smoke. It is there from beginning to end but never the main show. There is good malt, woody taste and a nice bitter kick in the middle.  Smooth and creamy texture. Moderate carbonation and medium bodied. A little less carbonation would bump this up in my book.  Overall I really enjoyed this beer. I liked the low profile of the smoke; quite different from most other smoked beers. You cannot go wrong here.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Smoked Porter,89
147,90,MaxSpang,3.22,"Poured from a 22oz bomber into a pint glass...  APPEARANCE  Textbook porter - very dark with minimal light coming through. It had a nice 2-finger khaki colored head.  SMELL  There was a good amount of chocolate in the nose, as well as some graininess. Had a nice malty/roasty smell  TASTE  At first, it tasted like smoked Guinness - very muted flavors. After awhile, they started to come out more... Smokiness was very apparent. There was a good amount of bittersweet chocolate. The hops came out after a few sips, adding a nice little bit of citrus to the flavor. None of the flavors were very strong, other than the smokiness.  MOUTHFEEL  It was fairly light, and pretty dry. It had plenty of carbonation but wasn't fizzy. It would have been a lot more drinkable had it not been for the dryness paired with the smokiness - that being said, it's not hard to drink in the least bit.  OVERALL  I was somewhat disappointed with this beer. It's definitely a good beer and had a lot of flavor, but it was just kind of average. Nothing really stood out as being spectacular in this beer. I would definitely drink it again, but there's a lot of other porters I would have before this one.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Smoked Porter,89
147,90,mactrail,3.92,"Flavorful but restrained black beer.  Not much head in the pint glass. Black with slight reddish cast. Aroma has just a hint of smoke and more of browned barley. Medium body. Really subtle smoke flavor compared to other smokey beers. Just a whiff, and not an identifiable kind of smoke. Hops are a tasty but modest addition and take over from the smokiness. Moderate bitter aftertaste.  Pleasant, very quaffable brew. Tasted at Cueva Bar, on Adams Ave in San Diego.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Smoked Porter,89
147,90,LazyL,4.15,"Poured into my collector glass at the Porland Spring wine and beer fest. A dark brown/black with a nice espresso coloured foam with great chunky lacing. The smell is smoke times 2. It hits you in the face, but as you wade through it you get to the molasses, a little brown sugar and chared wood. The taste is chipolte that lingers and on top of the coffee notes, a little lime. The mouthfeel is light and smooth with a dry finish. Overall this is a good, easy drinking Porter that is not too sweet and because of the chared wood may pair very well with smoked meats.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Smoked Porter,89
147,90,HugePlume,4.08,"On tap, in an 8oz tulip for desert.  A- Rich muddy brown, with a milk chocolate like color along the edges where the light made its way through. Had a splendid velvety tan head, which it retained well.  S- The nose was more burnt than smoked, but it worked alright, just like crisp toast works with jam.  T- again the burnt note of toasted bread, followed by a kind dry sweetness and a smooth alcoholic finish.  M- Spot on for a porter, thick and purposeful. It gets between your cheek and gum and you relish swishing it around. Light carbonation to give it a warm alcohol note on the finish,  O- Not smokey, but toasty yet this still is a great porter.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Smoked Porter,89
147,90,bbkd3b,4.21,"Poured into a tulip glass.  A - Dark as a cloudy, moonless night with a finger-thick tan head. No light gets through the brew. Fantastic retention… Sexy.  S - Roasted malts and an earthy underbody. A twinge of smokiness that’s to be expected with a twist of coffee bean.  T - All-smoke in the early drinking that settles into a nice, malty sweetness. Like a smoked macchiato with a kick of hops on the back-end. Complex, balanced… tasty.  M - Light and puffy body that just sort of floats in the mouth. Silky finish - this beer is smooth as can be. Clean and refreshing!  O - Excellent brew! I have trouble really appreciating porters, but this one is easy to enjoy. I also steered away from smoked beers for a long time, but this has sparked my curiosity quite a bit. Might try smoking some salmon with this in the future.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Smoked Porter,89
147,90,stckhndlr,4.17,A- Dark Dark amber porter with a three finger tan head. Head has the consistency of a thick sea foam. Leaves lace rings around the glass as it disappates.  S- Starts out with some dark fruits and smokey hops. It has a really good smokey flavor. Faint hints of chocolate and some caramel.  T- chocolate and smoked hops with caramel become the more dominant flavors here. A touch of coffee and the dark fruit on the back end. Has a hoppy bitterness on the end but not too bad.  M- This comes across as a med to full body to me. it has a bit of creaminess to it. Smooth smooth finish.  O- This is a keeper. The chocolate and the smoke are not too overbearing and well balanced.,Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Smoked Porter,89
147,90,scottyshades,4.2,"On-tap a while back  A: Pours a rich mahogany color with a fluffy brown cap. Kind of opaque. Retention is pretty good  S: I was expecting more smoke, but nicely balanced - only a hint. I pick up on hops and a big dose of chocolate before the smoke. Big time roast, coffee, and caramel  T: Mellow beer. Still not a whole lot of smoke, more chocolaty and hoppy than anything. Balanced. Caramel and an underlying bitterness, nice depth  MF/O: Lighter body than I expected, bitterness lingers with chocolate. Overall, pretty drinkable stuff right here",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Smoked Porter,89
147,90,SWMeyer4141,3.23,"Had this beer sitting around for a month now figured It was a nice pairing with a Turkey Chili. Poured into my Sam Smith pint glass.  Appearance-Very dark brown with a few hints of red. Alot more carbonation than I thought, a pretty big 3 inch light brown head.  Smell-Upon first whiff got some dark chocolate. Definitely some dark fruits in there as well, as it warms you can get some hops, now I think I'm ready to give it a try.  Taste-The smoke definitely comes out in the first sip. With a slighty hoppy finish. About 30 seconds after the finish a smokiness is still resting on my tongue. Coffee and chocolate are present. Towards the end a real awkward numbess was on my tongue.  Mouthfeel-Very light and smooth. Alot of carbonation.  Overall-This is one of those Stone offerings I always walk by but never purchase. I think It may continue to stay that way. There were some things I liked, but some I didn't.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Smoked Porter,89
147,90,legalpete19340,4.33,"A: Poured very dark brown with significant head. Respectable lacing.  S: Charred malt, peat and a bit of smoke. Noticeable herbal and grassy hop character.  T: Some upfront bitterness then all roasted malt, smoke, small bittersweet chocolate. More dark malt near the end before a bit of grassy character an a mildly bitter finish. Very nice.  M: Thinner but not thin. Semi-watery.  O: Really an exceptional porter. Dark, smokey and interesting but with a sunshiney twist.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Smoked Porter,89
147,90,ummswimmin,4.12,"I poured the beer to accompany a dinner of Cluck U (a New Jersey wings institution). I felt like the dark beer would go well with barbeque wings. It works.  It was a 22 ounce bottle in a pint glass. I had a two finger head off the pour, which disappeared pretty quickly.  The bouquet smelled like plums or raisins with a little bit of smoke on it.  The smoke came through immediately with each drink. The sweetness in the porter came through after.  This is a very good smoked porter. It doesn't come as a surprise, I have enjoyed every Stone beer. This is another great one.  One note: the beer had a drink by date of December 2010. I feel like the extra months didn't hurt this beer at all. Not a surprise with a porter style.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Smoked Porter,89

A-Beautiful, in the space where brown and black meet; one finger head, no lacing  S-Roasted malt, mild hops, chocolate, mesquite  T-BBQ meat smoked for some time, chocolate and coffee  M-Smooth, slight snap of bubbles  O-This will be a go to porter for me at any grilled red meat experience; the smoke action is really terrific, hats off to Stone for another great one",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Smoked Porter,89
147,90,shaunb81,4.22,"I took a little chance with this one considering that my last smoked beer was a smoked raushbier from Germany. Didn't dig it. But here we go...  Appearance - Pours black with red hues around the edges. A nice 1"" head with medium lacing around the glass. Nice  Smell - This beer smells awesome. Some caramel, a little coffee, and roasted, smoked malts come through like a gargoyle out of hell.  Taste - The smokiness comes through powerfully. Not bad though. The malts fade slowly which leads the way for an onslaught of coffee, caramel, and smoky delicious goodness. The back end of this beer is what really makes it count.  Mouthfeel - The carbonation is perfect and this beer has a creamy texture that I love.  Overall - Possibly one of my new favorites. It has everything that I like from a dark beer and an edgy (from the smokiness) that puts it above most other dark beers. I'm in heaven. Leave me alone....",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Smoked Porter,89
147,90,Japerrault,4.2,"A: Nearly black with a creamy tan head, nice lacing left as the head transformed into a skim.  S: Caramel, toffee, light smokiness  T: Complex. Very light sweetness in the front with caramel, and toffee flavors showing through first; next, the roasted grain and hop bitterness comes out and lingers through the finish. Smoke is present in the end, with light toffee returning sharing the stage with the mild bitterness.  M: Mouth feel is right where it should be. No too thick and not too thin. Carbonation is right as well.  O: This porter is strong on malt character and light on Hops, as the style usually is. It is not a beer for those sensitive to bitterness. I like it and will have another.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Smoked Porter,89
147,90,Azurescens,3.8,"22oz bottle with no bottled on or freshness date, poured into Maudite stemmed glass, reviewed on 4/8/11  A: Pours a very dark brown with dense tan head that fades to a long lasting film leaving patches of lacing around the glass.  S: Big smoky aroma dominates the nose, alcohol comes next followed by some dark malt. Little to no hop aroma is able to penetrate through the smoke and alcohol.  T: Like the nose, this is quite smoky, but the sweet and toasty dark malt flavors come through much more so in the taste than the aroma. Some nutty flavor is detectable as well and balanced nicely with some hop bitterness along with a touch of hop flavor. Quite sweet and smooth.  M: Nice medium body with carbonation on the lighter side.  O: Pretty good smoked porter, they got the smoke level right were it should be, dominant but not completely overpowering (NG unplugged smoked rye). Lots of smoke on the nose but plenty of other flavors come through to balance things out.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Smoked Porter,89
147,90,obywan59,4.3,"Poured from a 650ml into a pint glass. Mahogany at the narrow part of the glass with a ruby edge. Close to pitch black otherwise. 2-finbger tan head leaving great lacing. Hard second pour gave a very impressive 4+ finger head that left an incredible honeycomb-like lacing as it receded. The head resembled an ice cream float.  Smokey dark chocolate with hint of dark fruits.  Smoke prevails again, but this time there's more coffee than thocolate. Woody. Sweet malt up front, then even sweeter before the bitterness of coffee rises to balance. The bitterness finally overpowers in the finish.  The mouthfeel is a bit on the light side for such a dark brew, but smooth and pleasant nonetheless. Lightly creamy.  An excellent drinker. A bit less sweet than I prefer, but this brew has enough character to keep me interested.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Smoked Porter,89
147,90,MaltsOfGlory,3.8,"Pours a surprisingly big two finger head, I didn't pour it too aggressively. The head is an off white, tan color, and it has some soapy bubbles and some small creamy ones. I can tell the beer is leaving excellent lacing. You cannot see through the body of this beer at all, it is black, but not pitch black, it has hughes of brown and red, which is a little unfortunate for a porter in my opinion. Overall it looks really good, other than that hughes of brown and red. Also, the head has faded more than I would have thought, oh well. As for the smell, it's not really outstanding, I mean it's good, it's what I would expect from stone, but it leads me to think that it's not going to be A- quality, contrary to what the rest of BA says. You get a nice roasted malt smell, but it's not any roastier than most of the stouts that I have had. There are some nice chocolate aromas, and perhaps a small hop aroma as well. Is smells pretty smooth, and perhaps creamy, but overall nothing outstanding on the smell, good, but nothing unique. I really don't know how to rate this on taste, because it is a good beer, all around it's a good beer, but it's really just a little boring. There is nothing wrong with it, but there is almost nothing unique about it in any way. It tastes just like a regular old porter, it's done well, but just very normal. I do get a nice creamy feel to it which is very nice. There are the chocolate and roasted malts in here, and the smallest hop bite, maybe 1 IBU? haha, no but really. Overall I just wish the flavor was more powerful, it's not a very full flavor. I want to give this a 4 on taste because all the flavors are there and it is creamy and smooth, it's just not as flavorful as I would have liked, and it's pretty boring, so 3.5. I have to give it a 4 on mouthfeel because even though the mouthfeel isn't outstanding, the creaminess makes up for it; I mean it's a thin mouthfeel, but at the same time it's creamy. Drinkability is one thing that I will give this beer kudos for, it's a porter, and yet it's not hard to drink at all, it does down very easily. Overall I'm a little disappointed with this beer just because it's not very creative and not very flavorful, but at the same time it's a pretty well done beer and there is nothing wrong with it, so I will for sure enjoy drinking it.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Smoked Porter,89

147,90,mellowmark,4.11,"Poured from 22 oz. brown bottle to an Imperial Pint glass. Enjoy by 07-06-11. $4.39 a bottle.  Appearance: Pours a deep dark brown with ruby accents and a huge 3-finger light brown frothy head that never goes away completely, leaving a quarter inch layer on top. Nice retention and phenomenal lacing. Look absolutely fantastic when pouring, almost like a Guinness cascading effect. Nice start.  Smell: I get coffee right of the bat. Milk chocolate and vanilla. Roasted malt. Slight earthiness. Caramel.  Taste: Wow, this one is not short on flavor. Sweet up front, bitter in the middle and roasty at the end. Buttery. Nice balance of flavors. Not very much in terms of smokiness. Lingering roasted malt with earthy bitter hops and almost like a burnt coffee quality that borders on cloying. I was about to give this beer a 4.5 for taste, but there is something about the aftertaste that just doesn't sit right with me. It's kind of like an astringent coffee flavor and is too prominent to ignore.  Mouthfeel: Mouthfeel is medium and creamy with a medium to low carbonation. Smooth drinking for sure.  Drinkability: High  Plenty of flavor and solid all the way through. Not really what I would expect from a smoked beer due to it not being very smoky, but it's good and I will get this again in the future.

S: a very dark roasted aroma. light smoke in there. a sweetness that reminds me of marshmallows.  T: strong roasted character on the palate, however the smoke is more of a player here. a decent amount of sweetness, mostly chocolate, from all the dark malts quickly fads into a moderately dry finish. i actually get a little bit of alcohol as well (kind of surprising considering the low ABV).  M: fantastic creaminess to this one. not to the point of velvety, mostly because the body is lighter, but fantastic smoothness to this one. medium body.

Aroma: Smokey, malty, hint of chocolate. The Smoke is more subtle than I expected. Maybe a hint of crispness from the hops.  Taste: Toffee, hint of chocolate, and the smoke is more prominent than in the smell. The finish leaves a smoky burnt coating on your tongue, making the flavors linger for quite a bit.  Mouthfeel: Not very thick, but it does tend to ""coat"" a bit, and hang around.  Overall: I think the flavor is very nicely balanced, I do wish the smoke was a little more prevalent in the smell.

It would be great to get more of the smoke character coming through  T: Very smooth at the beginning with a slight bit of smoke flavor, but hits with a huge bitterness at the end from the hops. Very typical of Stone beers, so no shocker there  M: Goes down very smooth and not overpowering due to the somewhat low gravity of 5.9%. Carbonation is present and right on  O: Not really what I would consider a smoked beer. As far out as Stone goes with the hops in some of their beers, it would have been great if they would have done so with the ratio of their grain bill going to smoked malts.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Smoked Porter,89

Toasty malts as well that linger into the aftertaste. Notes of black coffee as well.  Very, very smooth. Almost a silk-like texture with soft carbonation and a dry finish.  I really think this is an awesome beer for a few reasons. One, it's drinkable as hell, two, all around well crafted and well priced as far as bombers go, and three, it's a smoked beer, but not overly so, which makes it really approachable.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Smoked Porter,89

I've tried this on multiple occasions while visiting the stone brewery just to see if maybe my opinion would change, but it hasn't. The smoothness of the beer is it's best attribute.

The malt backbone carries the smoke from the middle through the finish, but its the smoke which is up front and dominant.  MF: Tasty and not too heavy bodied for a porter.

147,90,InebriatedJoker,4.3,"Poured from bomber into pint goblet - No best by date visible.  Poured a deep dark brown with one and half finger head that dissipated into a thin creamy lacing, decent carbonation.  Smell - Roasted malts with light coffee .  Taste - Smoky roasted malts with a hint of licorice , some sweetness is present , a slight hint of hops,subtle notes of coffee.  Drinkability - Overall this was well blended and balanced , the flavors work together and I get a smoky aftertaste that reminds me of the charcoal flavor form a rib-eye in fact this would probably be a great pairing with one .",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Smoked Porter,89
147,90,Wegomlegging,3.5,"Nice black pour, if not a bit watery. Good smell, but where's the smoke? Just kidding, no false advertising puns from now on. Taste was very pleasant, malt and roast all over, with slightly lingering roastiness. East to drink, with just the right amount of carbonation. Maybe the wateriness coming through again. Overall the porter of choice for the supermarket shopper, but nothing that will leave you drooling for more.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Smoked Porter,89

T: Nice balance between hops and malts, with slight hop bitterness of piney notes. Can taste the touch of smokiness at the finish.  M: Ok, not as smooth as I would have hoped, somewhat coats the mouth, medium body.

Has a smell of coffee, smoked nuts and hints of chocolate and toffee  Has a great creamy taste of chocolate smoked nuts and a nose of chocolate coffee.  Has a medium mouthfeel and a good drinkibility. This is a quality porter and I would definitely recommend.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Smoked Porter,89
147,90,Wamesit,4.12,"A - Pours a deep brown with ruby edges. Thin tan head that gives way to light lacing.  S - Sweet, smokey coffee malts.  T - Rich smokey malts (black malt assumed) immediately; layered flavors of roasted coffee and dark chocolate do battle for the spotlight. Very smooth for a smoked porter. The smoothness is tested by some nice hops bitterness towards the finish and yet it still closes out smooth, almost creamy as it warms a bit.  M - Medium.  D - Not overly smokey (or perhaps normal smokey) for a smoked porter and that might lend itself to more drinkability. However, the well-balanced flavors, especially the hops presence, makes it drinkable for more than just drinkable's sake.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Smoked Porter,89
147,90,BeerBuckeye,4.15,"A - Pours a very dark reddish brown hue with a great creamy-tan head with good lacing.  S - I smelled a good amount of roasted malts and the sweetness of chocolate. Not as much smokyness as I was suspecting. The background has some notes of dark sweetness.  T - Smokyness definitely comes forward in the taste. A great roasted flavor that's sweet at first before fading into a good, burnt bitter coffee taste. I thought it was complex without being overbearing on smoked.  M - Not too thick, really, nor a heavy body, it was actually a lot thinner than I was expecting.  D - Very drinkable, this beer, with all the taste, is not that filling, and of course, with a lower ABV, it goes down smooth.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Smoked Porter,89
147,90,dlmccabe1,4.1,"Poured into a 16oz Maudite Snifter.  Pours a nice black color with a good head. I expected a slightly deeper brown head, but it has that characteristic stout look. Aroma is faintly smoky without being overwhelming. The smokey taste, similar to the nose, is subtle but there. It's not an overwhelming amount of smoke like, for example, the Mikkeller Beer Geek Breakfast. If I wasn't looking for it, I'm not certain I'd pick it out blind.  Slight lingering bitterness and a nice medium mouthfeel makes this a very drinkable porter. Meets my expectations for the style really well, not too heavy, more a of season changing fall or early spring beer for me.  Quite nice.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Smoked Porter,89
147,90,GilGarp,4.35,"Bomber, with no date or batch number, served cold into a tumbler.  Stone Smoked Porter is one that has been on the shelves since well before my days of beer advocacy but I've never picked one up until yesterday. It pours a very dark redish brown color. The head is thick and creamy with good retention. Lacing is perfect - all over the inside of the glass.  Aroma is excellent as well and seems spot-on for a porter. Great roasted malts, chocolate, and coffee. The smoke is fairly subtle though for being a smoked porter.  The flavor is really quite special too. The richness of the malt is impressive given it's relatively low ABV. There is a good amount of hop bitterness but the balance is just right. The smokiness is perfectly judged and never feels overpowering. The finish is clean with no smoke in the aftertaste.  Mouthfeel is smooth, full bodied, and lightly carbonated.  I think the reason I had never bought one before is that I usually don't like smoked beers. Often, the smoke dominates the experience with aftertaste somewhere between bacon and ashtray. Stone has hit this one perfectly.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Smoked Porter,89
147,90,Brianjames16,4.53,"A- Pours a dark dark cloudy brown color with a substantial two finger width light tan frothy head. Nice tight bubbles build to form the head. A lot of lacing sticks and stays on the glass.  S- Big roasty malt aromas mixed with chocolate and sugary notes. The roasted malt aroma is beautiful in this one.  T- Wonderful balance of characteristic flavors. Roasted malts, sugars and chocolates all blend into on smooth and warming taste. Alcohol is masked by the rich flavors. Nice bitterness at the end from the hops.  M- Here's where it gets very interesting. From the look I would suspect this would have a heavy body. Not the case. The smooth and silky texture plus the balance of flavors make this beer an very easy drinker for me. D- Surprisingly very easy to drink. I love porters and stouts and I will most definitely come back to this one again.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Smoked Porter,89
147,90,flannelman808,3.98,A: Dark brown and quite clear in the light... slightly burnt copper tinge. Topped with a coffee yogurt colored head which has medium to small sized bubbles. Great lacing and good retention.  S: Columbian coffee and a slightly roasted smoky grain quality.  T: Very sprite on the tongue! Much more punch then I would have expected from the nose. This one starts with perhaps too much carbonation and and some hoppy zest zing the palate. All of these flavors begin to tingle down into a coffee ground like bitterness... Think coffee grinds but think folgers. In the end light to medium body but packed with zazz.  M: zazz yo  D: Medium to medium plus (lower notes due to high carbonation),Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Smoked Porter,89
147,90,VelvetExtract,3.95,"A-Pours lighter than expected. Darker brown but the beer is somewhat translucent. The highlights are attractive. Big, fluffy head floats above the liquid and seems quite persistent. Definately one of the larger heads I have seen on a porter. A bunch of lacing sits in chunks along the glass.  S-Rich maltiness and chocolate. Not detecting an smokiness in the aroma however. But as I have come to realize with Stone, they ver rarely let me down. I'll trust that this beer is what is advertised.  T-Quite roasty. See, I knew I should trust the brand, this beer is tasty! The smokiness is definatel apparent on the tongue. A charred flavor sits on the palate after the sip for quite a while. Along with the roastiness, I get some good chocolate notes as well a twinge of hop bitterness.  M-Quite thick. Wasn't expecting it to be this thick because it looks thinner than other brews of the stle. Pleasant surprise.  D-Not too much booze in this beer which allows it to be quite drinkable. Very flavorful nonetheless.  Once again, Stone refuses to let me down.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Smoked Porter,89
147,90,notchucknorris,3.36,"A: Very dark brown with some chestnut hints on the edges.  S: A huge smoky smell along with some roasted malts.  T: Luckily, the flavors in this one go way beyond the smoky smell. Slight malty sweetness, then bitter dark chocolate and coffee flavors. On the finish, a hint of hops and dark fruit. Throughout the taste, a lot of smoke that almost tastes like smoked meat. It's almost like the smell that you get in your hair when you sleep too close to a campfire. It's not a bad beer, but probably my least favorite of the stone year-rounds. Probably not one I'll go near again any time soon.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Smoked Porter,89
147,90,sprucetip,3.48,"From notes. Dark brown with red highlights when backlit. Fluffy light tan head, with good retention, and active. Leaves thick lacing early, but it washes away.  Lightly roasty and vaguely of coffee and toffee. Not especially strong. There is a bit of malty sweetness. Not much in the way of smoke. Some complexity and subtleness, but overall I'm left underwhelmed.  Roasty bitterness noticeable early, and it tastes charred more than smoky of roasty. Malt bill struggles to be noticed. Astringency is prominent. ...later some chocolate and dark fruit emerge.  Fizzy bite lingers, thin feeling medium body, some creaminess in the middle, and a lingering charred bitterness.  I am pretty sure I liked this more when I have had it previously, as I recall liking it better than I liked this sample. So I won't give up on it. But it just didn't seem to hit too many spots tonight. The bitterness was more than I recalled, and it didn't seem to have the rich malty body I was hoping for. ...But I could be spoiled by Alaskan's Smoked Porter...",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Smoked Porter,89

A very dark beer, almost as black as night. S: Hints of chocolate, some smokiness, roasted malts, slight piney hops. T: Dark chocolate and black coffee in the beginning. A good deal of bitter chocolate at stays until the end. Not much smokiness in the taste, but there are some hints of it. M: Lighter bodied than expected. More carbonation than expected. D: This beer is easy to drink, no doubt about it. It has a lighter body than I would expect from a porter. The cocoa bitterness might get in the way as you drink more, but it's not too harsh.

147,90,AWolfAtTheDoor,4,"This is where stone really shines. It's too bad Arrogant Bastard gets all the attention, because their non-simcoe beers are truly terrific.  Fairly old bomber (around a year?) that's been sitting in my fridge was screaming out to me to drink it on this blustry February night. Dark in the pint glass, but when held up to a light, one can see tons of ruby. Beer is quite clear. Picturesque lacing. Drinking this at well over 55 degrees F.  Roasted chocolate on the nose. A little bit of smoke, nothing crazy.  Very smooth roasted malts on the palate. Hint of warm chocolate, balanced with some roasted notes. What I love most about this is that a company who made their name by big aggressive hoppy beers can make a balanced beer like this. Hope are still there, but it's not SCREAMING Simcoe like Ruination... As good as it is, there is only just a faint hint of smoke. I'd personally expect more from a ""smoked porter."" But with that said, it's still positively delicious.  Sublime mouthfeel. Just roasty and yummy. Meal in a glass.  Super drinkable. 5.9% ABV? Amazing flavor period.

Slight roast flavor as well. Bittersweet lingering aftertaste that's also on the smoky side. Taste follows the smell pretty well M: Slick and creamy with mild carbonation. Not prickly by any means but you can tell it's there. D: Pretty high. A bomber isn't gonna be a problem and although the flavor might get tiresome after a few you could have 2-3 no issues. Not a one and done kind of beer. It isn't so filling and it's by no means alcoholic enough to end the night.  Overall: A very good smoked porter from the masters at Stone.

After that, there is a chocolate and dark coffee taste. The drink ends with nice smokey notes that linger on. Very nice.  M - Your typical mouthfeel for this type.

Almost more of a peaty smokiness than a wood quality. Chocolate and roasted malts.  This is a very good American Porter but not really a smoked beer in my opinion, and I guess acording to others opinions judging by it's listed category. Not as bitter as I was bracing myself for in the Stone tradition.

147,90,glid02,4,On-tap at Twain's in Atlanta.  Pours one shade from black with a one-finger tan head. The head recedes into a wispy layer on top leaving decent lacing.  Smells of smooth roasted malts with moderate amounts of smokiness - char with hints of campfire. Also present are mild dark semi-sweet chocolate aromas.  Tastes very similar to how it smells. Mildly dry roasted malt flavors kick things off and are joined quickly by well-integrated smokiness. Moderate amounts of dark chocolate come into play midway through the sip. Hints of leafy hops come into play near the end of the sip before carrying through to a moderately bitter ending.  Mouthfeel is good. It's got a nice thickness with smooth carbonation.  Drinkability is also good. I finished my glass without a problem and could have another.  Overall this beer was more smoky than I remembered however it still isn't robust enough given the ABV. Worth a shot to see for yourself but not worth seeking out.,Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Smoked Porter,89
147,90,shand,3.93,"Poured from a 22oz bottle into a nonic.  This brew pours a very dark brown with about two fingers worth of head with beautiful lacing and retention. The aroma is primarily roasted malts and smoke, with a bit of bitter coffee. The aroma follows the smell, the smoke is a lovely part of the composition of this brew, as opposed to being the focus as some other smoked beers are. It adds a lovely, smokey aftertaste to the rich, roasted malts and the touch of coffee. The smoke aspects become more of an aspect of the aftertaste than anything else.  Mouthfeel is a little thin, but otherwise satisfying. The drinkability does suffer just a little bit due to the smoke flavors, but that's only towards the end of the 22 ounces. A solid porter.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Smoked Porter,89

Aromas of roasty chocolate blend perfectly with mild smoky notes. There is a slight spice to the nose, perhaps a combination of the smoke and hops, and a subtle touch of fruit. Great balance of flavors between the sweetness, medium bitter dark chocolate, and light pleasant smoke. Ends on a roasty note with mild smoke and piney hops. Body is slightly creamy and finishes mediumm dry. Very nice drinkable porter. The light smoke adds a really wonderful twist to this brew.

147,90,BuckeyeSlim,3.55,"22 oz. bomber poured into a New Belgium snifter.  A - Big three-finger head of thick, pillowy ecru foam that falls very slowly, leaving rings of lace on the glass and an island of foam on the surface. Color is one shade off jet black and completely opaque. Held to a light, color is a deep, dense cherry wood and clear. In a porter, this much head is a sign of over-carbonation.  S - Roasted malts, peat, dark dried fruits, hints of caramel and chocolate with rather pronounced aromatic hops like pine mixed in. In fact, the hops pretty much take over the glass as it warms and there's more room in it, pushing the other aromas aside.  T - Well-roasted malts, dark caramel and chocolate, coffee, with smoke woven throughout. All of that is followed by bittering hops in the finish that leave a grapefruit/citrus taste on the tongue.  M - A bit fizzy but chewy, almost thick. Reasonable carbonation. Moderate body. Solid structure. Finish lingers somewhat.  D - This is essentially a roasted/smoked IPA. The porter characteristics show up early in the nose and taste, but the hops take over and pretty much wipe them out. This is the first porter I can think of where most of the finish is grapefruit, but occasionally chocolate/caramel sticks its head in for a moment. Most American porters I've tasted are really junior stouts. This is a brew that follows the American west coast trend of making it all about the hops. It's not my idea of a porter, but hop heads are likely to enjoy the experience, especially if they also like their malts well-roasted.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Smoked Porter,89

Malt, caramel and chocolate take the forefront, but the dark fruits, slight hops, and nice smokey finish allow for it to be a pretty dang good tasting beer.  M-Medium bodied, creamy, with a light carbonation  D-Very drinkable, almost too drinkable, that bomber didn't last me nearly as long as I was hoping",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Smoked Porter,89
147,90,Tifore,4.12,"On tap at Tremont Tap House. Poured into a small tasting glass.  A - Deep deep brown in color. Almost black but a very clear beer that has a good amount of light coming through it. Has a one finger head that leaves some light lacing on the glass.  S - Smell is of smoke and sweet roasted malts. Lots of caramel and sweet chocolate tones as well. Has a nice complexity to it that I like. Some faint spicy hops are in the ose but maybe this is just normal winter spice complementing the sweet tones.  T - Taste is of the sweet malts and lots of bitter and sweet chocolate. Some smokey woody tones are present as well, which I am thinking is from the roasting process. Citrus hops are present as well and the smoke finishes the taste off.  M - The mouthfeel is very thick and chewy which I like. Has some nice body to it which compliments the rich malts.  D - A nice beer from Stone that I wouldn't hesitate to try again. Alcohol percentage makes it a easy drinker.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Smoked Porter,89
147,90,pilotgod,3.98,"Bomber poured into Pint glass.  A: Pours a nice deep brown with a brown head of a little less than one finger width that retains well throughout. Little to no lacing occurs.dd When held to the light, it is not transparent in the least, but some reddish tones can be discerned.  S: The smoke overtone is always present, but doesn't dominate and lets the other nuances of roasted malts, nuts, some chocolate, and faint hops. The smell is very subdued and takes some ""searching"" out to get anything above the typical porter.  T: This is where this beer really shines. The first taste is of a subtle smoke taste, almost the same sensation of tasting smoke from a camp fire. This is subdued and goes to the background pretty quick as the roasted flavors kick in with pronounced coffee overtones. There is a bitterness that comes into play as it is swallowed that I couldn't quite tell whether from the smoke or the hops. Either way, it is very enjoyable and leaves you wanting more.  M: With the moderate carbonation there is a discernible tingling sensation, but that is tamed by the creamy feel of this porter. The lasting finish is of the smoke flavor, which is pronounced, but not overly domineering.  D: A good representation of the Smoked Porter style giving out all the flavors that one would come to expect, but not too much of any one aspect. The average alcohol and carbonation make this an easy beer to sit down and enjoy and goes very well with a Texas style smoked BBQ, such as a chopped brisket sandwich.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Smoked Porter,89

147,90,aasher,4.12,"This beer pours a dark brown, not quite black, with a one finger super spongy looking light khaki head. I'm surprised that this isn't darker. The foam looks great but the lack of true black isn't what I look for in a porter. It smells or rich, woody smoke and is pretty appealing. It's a little more subtle than I'd like but it is solid. I prefer a good amount of smoke. I'm not getting any of the hoppyness that others have mentioned. The flavors are solid but not awe inspiring. It's a little sweet on the palate and as you swallow you get the char, wood, and smoke. It doesn't really have any coffee to it. I'd describe this as pretty mellow. This drinks exceptionally smooth and is in between medium to full in body. I do like the after taste but again, I'd prefer more smoke. This beer is solid but nothing too special. It's very drinkable though and worth it for the $4.99 per 22oz bottle.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Smoked Porter,89

Hops are pretty prominent for the style. Plenty of cocoa and a bit of coffee. There is also a very slight waft of caramel.  T - Although not the most dominant taste, I have to mention the smoke as it presented on the palate. It was a very ashy note that briefly appeared up front and lingered with the bitterness in the finish. I really enjoyed the bitterness.  M - Medium. I'd rather this be thicker, but that's a common complaint I have. It's very smooth.  D - This is quite drinkable. The only problem is the ashy flavor. It just seems to get a bit grating as you progress through the glass. The bitterness and hoppiness were appreciated, however.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Smoked Porter,89

147,90,Jadjunk,4.03,"#52. My first Stone Brew review.  Poured from a Bomber to a glass mug at room temp.  (Appearance) Pours a fizzy two finger depth tannish head that retains nicely, leaving a big excess foam in the center for a while and some light foamy lacing streaks at the sides. Color is a near black with some deep mahogany tones on the edges when held to light. Can't see any carbonation going on in this brew. It looks like an inviting and bold porter. 4.5  (Smell) I can certainly get the smoky aroma which lingers over the entire porter smell. Some slight chocolate tones and a hint of caramel here and there, a bigger presence on the roasted nuts than the average porter. Licorice stands out a lot also. Floral hops do a nice job rounding out this nose. Biggest fallback is on the potency, where these flavors don't really get a chance to shine like they should. Everything smells really good and I can't wait to try this beer. 4  (Taste) Super smoky caramel, this would pair nicely with most smoked foods. A coffee bean taste is more evident than ever, with the roasted bean tones dragging on to the finish paired with a dominant licorice stick twang and some herbal spice zest. Plums and dark fruit may also be involved in here, more likely in the finish. A very bold and exciting taste. Everything is well rounded and exciting. Smokey tastes are most dominant, of course. 4.5  (Mouthfeel) Smooth and creamy. A very smokey mouthfeel that becomes very dominant over time and perhaps too much for some. There could be more carbonation, but I don't feel it would be appropriate for the style. This does a pretty good job on the mouthfeel. 4  (Drinkability) A slow drinker due to the complex arrangement of flavors and a smoky dominance but nothing too much for my preference. Does well on most levels, but is largely filling and I couldn't consider a second bomber after this one. One is all I'd ever need! 3  Verdict: A worthy porter. Smokey accents are well recognized and the taste is well rounded and robust with flavor. Porter lover? Worth it! A- (4.2)",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Smoked Porter,89
147,90,rdilauro,4.5,"STONE Brewery did a super job with this one. It pours nice and dark with a semi-dark creamy head. The aroma was very pleasant.

A pleasure to drink",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Smoked Porter,89
147,90,DrinkingDrake,4.2,Pitch black with a slight amount of off what big bubble head. Thick amount of lacing.  Rich smokey chocolate. Slightly fruity with a wood note. Pronounced hop zest along with a dark toffee malt sweetness.  Comes across creamy but that dissipates fast. Thinner than expected. Very deep roasted black malt but also a light malt character.

Nice film forms leaving a pretty nice flowing head that drips down leaving long trails.  Strong smoke nature on the nose. A mild roasted malt base, but the smoking gives a great spiciness, very similar to either roasted Jalapenos or a sour funk. Intriguing.  Roasted malts give a nice base. The smoked nature dominates though, but not to a ""oh dear caught in a house fire"" degree. Mellowed, and for being a smoked porter, it is not just a smoke beer. The porter nature is well played, giving off a smooth roasted balance.  Very creamy and smooth. ABV is non-existant, and quite quaffable. Not a great intro into the style, but a good smoke beer.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Smoked Porter,89
147,90,carolinabeerguy,4.03,"Poured from an 22 ounce bomber into a New Belgium globe. Enjoy by 8/21/10 etched on bottle.  Appearance: Pours a dark cola brown with a 1 finger foamy tan head. Excellent lacing.  Smell: Roasted malt, sweet cocoa and mild floral hops with a very faint hint of smoke in the background.  Taste: Toasted bread up front followed by semi-sweet chocolate in the middle and ending with a combination of bitter hops and a nice dose of smoke. Aftertaste is smoky and mildly bitter and lingers for quite a while.  Mouthfeel: Medium-to-full-bodied with a good amount of carbonation. Goes down very smooth.  Drinkability: High drinkability. You could knock back more than one bomber over the course of an evening. This is a great choice for a cold day.  Overall: Excellent beer overall. This is one of the best porters I've ever had.

147,90,MatthewPatthew,2.93,"I had a taster of this after a tour of the brewery. This beer is pretty decent, though it pales in comparison to Alaskan's Smoked Porter, which I happened to have had the night before.  It looks like most any porter, though notably - like all of Stone's beers - crystal clear. It feels more watery than I'd like my Porter, however.  The smoked character is the standout of both the taste and aroma, but it has a ham-like quality that I try to avoid in smoked beers. I would have used a similar amount of a more well-rounded smoked malt. More smoke, less meat.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Smoked Porter,89

Very nice head retention and an excellent curtain of lacing.  S - Caramel malt, dark bitter chocolate and a bit of a burnt wood aroma provide quite the complex aroma.  T & M - The chocolate I smelled in the nose took on more of a sweet milk chocolate character than I would have guessed. I thought it would have been a more bitter chocolate (I think the smoke played a little trick on me). The caramel is there as well, and it balances out nicely with the smoke (I also would have thought the smoke would be more dominant). The mouthfeel is smooth and creamy. There is a tiny bit of hop bitterness toward the back end (providing the 53 IBU rating).  D - This is just a nicely balanced brew!! I paid $4.39 for the bomber I'm sampling from, and i would pay that any day of the week to have this beer stocked in my fridge.

Poured black, darker than some stouts and certainly darker than most Porters, with about 1/2 inch of light tan head that had low retention and some lacing.  The aroma featured rich malts supporting the even, balanced (there's a word rarely used about Stone) smokiness. There was just a trace of hops poking through in the background. The taste was surprisingly crisp, well-defined malts providing the base for the just-right amount of of smoke and that hint of hops.  The body was good, solid and even. As usual with smoke beers, drinkability depends on your tolerance for the smoke. I found this to be much easier to drink than most of the style, I might even have 2 in a row.

Nice tan, creamy head with very nice retention and excellent lacing. The head settled to a wonderful film on top.  Smell - The description on the bottle is spot on. A nice smokey aroma of coffee and chocolate. Licorice is both delicate and brilliant. The dark fruit is subdued, but makes a worthy impression. The smell is very well balanced in my opinion.  Taste - A nice robust black coffee flavor jumps out at first. Followed by some rich chocolate flavors. Both flavors are equally roasty, burnt and smokey. The dark fruit, like in the smell, is pushed to the background to give a little complexity.  Mouthfeel - Medium to mostly full mouthfeel. Chewy and smooth. Tons left on the palate waiting for the next sip. Very dry and exquisite.  Drinkability - This is a Porter that has strong character and flavor. It's perfect for the bitter cold evenings. The smokey aroma and flavor are really prominent and, to some extent, started to distract me. Not a great deal, but some. It's still a great, well rounded Porter.

S: Deep roasty malt flavor, coffee and smoke. Smells like I would expect for a smoked porter.  T: Deep flavor that matches the smell very closely. Lot of roasted malts up front that give way to smokiness and coffee. The beer kind of loses me on the finish though. The hops don't come through enough to balance out the initial burst of flavor. Still fantastic, just a little week on the finish.  M: Not as heavy as one might expect. Low carbonation, not sticky at all.  D: Relatively low gravity beer, weighs in at just 5.9% ABV, and not overwhelming to the palate. I almost wish it was a little heavier to balance out the flavor, but it's still a great beer.

147,90,SkunkWorks,4.5,"Had on tap at Bobbique in Patchogue, New York. Served in a pint glass.  I've reviewed the bottle version of this but I have yet to drink the tap version. The bottle of Stone Smoked Porter was one of my early favorites so I'm looking forward to this guy.  Look: very dark for a porter, almost black except some deep brown highlights when held to the light. The head is slightly off white. A bit of carbonation is visible but not a whole lot. Looks very good.  Smell: a bit of smoky malt but despite the name, not as smoky as one would think. Dark, roasted malt dominates with some dark chocolate, black coffee, and a bit of dark caramel is found in the nose. I'm struggling to find any hoppiness but that's perfectly fine by me. Very good.  Taste: follows the nose well. A bit of smoky malt but its very subdued. Black coffee, dark chocolate, dark caramel and those typical dark malt flavors permeate through powerfully with hints of hops. Absolutely delicious.  Feel: thick and creamy. Very full bodied for a porter and I love it. Great mouthfeel.  Drink: could very well drink this pint after pint. Great drinkability.  Overall, I haven't had this in a long, long time so I am glad I saw it on tap and had a chance to retry it. I remember absolutely loving this beer and it was one of the beers that got me passionate about craft beer. I am glad that my palate still appreciates this and that I was right about this one back in the day. This porter is incredibly flavorful and puts many stouts to shame in terms of flavor.

There is a touch of burnt, smokey character as well as a touch of hops.  Flavor is light up front with some a touch of roast and chocolate. In the finish, the intensity picks up quite a bit with even more roast, as well as some hoppiness and slight smoke/char character. The roast and bitterness intensifies the dryness in the finish while leaving a lingering feel.

147,90,bobhits,3.4,"Smoke is an odd smell in beers. They come off as a strong sour note at the top without much sweetness. Clear alcohol notes are in there. The roasted malt is there at the finish, Perhaps a touch of liquorish with a hint of coffee in the nose. I want to say vanilla and chocolate but I don't think those are in there. I'm mostly picking up the alcohol, smoke, liquorish, and some coffee.  Pours brown, turns black in the glass, with good head, great retention, and just enough body. Impressive to say the least.  Beers like this make me wish I knew more from those taste wheels. The malt isn't sweet or sour, the flavor hits the front of the tongue which indicates not sour, but the smoke is clearly a very unique flavor for the malt. Clear notes of chocolate (very much on the dark bitter bakers chocolate side, even more than most), coffee. There isn't any sweet notes in this beer. I think it would be amazing with sweeter foods, but I have nothing like that to try with it. I can vouch form past experience that this stuff is just amazing with roast chicken and BBQ. A rare thing with beer is that imo this is far better with food than by itself. I highly recommend pairing this with food.  Great carbonation gives this beer a lot of drink ability and a creamy mouth feel. That said it's a touch to thin all things considered.  I think stone for this very ""unstone like"" beer. It's a very different porter and a truly interesting experience. Scored as an alone drink and not as something to pair with food. Scores would go up in taste to with the right pairing.

The smoke flavor is barely detectable. Medium-low earthy hop flavor.  Well-carbonated with a medium body. Dry, slightly astringent finish. No obvious alcohol warmth.

Actually, the reputation of Stone is good beer at a reasonable price, so I am right on the money, so to speak. The appearance of this porter is very dark, almost a deep purple when pouring. It produced a thick, light-colored head, which in turn produced a thick patterned lace. The smell was average, above average for porters. Faint hints of chocolate, and coffee can be detected if you strain your nose. But the taste is where this beer shines. The start is full of chocolate and coffee, with a nice full-bodied mouthfeel. The finish reveals a nice light slight bitter smokiness that mingles with the coffee still on the palate. In all this porter is a very drinkable session beer, that would go with just about any meal.

Of nine porters tasted this is the only one with a big fizzy creamy, Guinness-like tan head. Smell is sweet, no smoke apparent. Some smoke in the flavor, very subtle and complementary to the overall effect rather than dominating. There is some fruitiness, dates. An easy-drinking session beer, more flavorful than Guinness, somehow the appearance and overall roasted effect keeps bringing up the comparison.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Smoked Porter,89

Head fizzy and dissipates to nothing very quickly  S - Briney green olives, campfire, wheat bread dough  T - I ironically detect fresh dough and charred toast simultaneously, dry bitterness at the finish, with a lingering acrid bite. Smoke flavor is less pronounced than anticipated, yet it establishes its footing in the flavor profile to a subtly fitting extent.  M - Mild carbonation precludes an incredibly smooth and delectably creamy body  D - Fantastic.

S - Light bitttersweet cocoa with some coffee notes and present yet subtle smokiness. Vague floral hop notes. T - The smokiness comes through more in the taste and lingers without being too full on. Cocoa and coffee flavours are also noticeable with some flroal and piney hop presence. M - Medium bodied, low to medium carbonation. Slight bitterness.

147,90,4000qtrap,3.84,"Source/Serving: 22oz. Bottle  Smell: Smoked chestnuts, tobacco leaf, slightly burnt toast, candied fruit (plum mostly), chocolate. Only has a hint of smokiness, not overpowering at all.  Taste: Fairly dry (stout-like), smoky, and bitter. Slight smokiness blends with quite bitter chocolate. Burnt licorice notes in the middle. Dark sweet wood. Quite carbonated. Smokiness comes through more at the finish which is dry, chocolaty, a little oaky, and lightly roasty.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Smoked Porter,89
147,90,wschmit,3.46,"Bomber into a Goose Island nonic.  A: Not-quite opaque brown body forms a very thin tan head that leaves a fine ring as it settles. Not terribly carbonated.  S: The scent leaves me a little disappointed. I catch just a faint whiff of smoke, and some dark malt bitterness. There's some hoppy bite, but it's indistinct. The chocolate/coffee notes are quite subtle, as the bottle indicates.  T: Taste trumps the nose. Nice musty, malty porter profile, with the usual tastes of chocolate, caramel, etc. The smoke is noticeable, but subdued--this is a good intro smoke beer for lots of people who find Schlenkerla too much, which is lots of folks. The bite is split nicely between hop and malt bitterness. The smoke, along with some coffee flavor, comes out late in the sip.  M: Appropriate mouthfeel to a porter. Not too carbonated, enough chewy body. Just right, for the style.  D: It's easy to drink, but not particularly memorable. As earlier, a great intro to smoked beers, but it's not very smoky. A pretty good value for what it is, but not particularly distinguished.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Smoked Porter,89
147,90,jampics2,4.3,"On tap @ the Winking Lizard. Served in a pint glass.  The beer looks nice in the glass. It's a predominantly black color with some red around the edges and brown swirls mixed in for good measure. A small head is all it has to offer, and that subsides to a ring rather quickly. The lace is spotty and probably the retention is the only flaw of an otherwise very attractive beer.  The smell is interesting in that it's really not as brash as one would expect. There's a nice roasted malt quality giving chocolate and coffee impressions. The smoke is less pronounced than in other smoked porters I've had, but it's well integrated. I'd like a bit more expression in the smell overall. This is good but I fear it could be better with more expression. A slight hop kick rounds out a good, but not great nose.  The taste is pretty much what I expected after the nose. The chocolate and roasted malt components make this sexy and the smoke really comes on in a subtle fashion. Over the course of the glass, it becomes less pronounced. Some sweet caramel malt emerges as the glass warms, and a slight hoppy tinge gives the sweetness a bitter balance. There's some lingering roast in the aftertaste. When this beer first came out, it was hands-down an ass-kicker, but compared to today's extreme beers it's more of an accessible offering for the adventurous beer drinker.  The mouthfeel is defined by decent carbonation and a medium body. For a porter, this is nice but just a touch on the light side. The drinkability is excellent, mostly due to the fact it's not terribly extreme in the taste department. Let's call that the smoked porter catch 22. I can't imagine one being a 5 in taste and in drinkability. A worthy beer for those who are worthy.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Smoked Porter,89
147,90,WanderingFool,4.05,"Stone Smoked Porter pours black into the glass with a finger width creamy tan head on top. The foam dissolves quickly to a sheet on the beer leaving behind lots of spots and lines of lace.  The aroma is malty with notes of roasted malt, chocolate and toffee. A fair amount of grassy hops are also noticeable.  Each sip of this medium to full bodied beer is very smooth, creamy, lightly carbonated and dry. The flavor is malty with notes of chocolate and roasted malts along with hints of coffee and peaty smoke. Towards the end a fair amount of bitterness moves in. It finishes with grassy hops and once gone the bitterness and chocolate malt lingers on the palate.  This is a very tasty, easy drinking, fairly well balanced porter. However, I was looking for more smoke flavors and aromas considering the name of the beer.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Smoked Porter,89
147,90,NightINgale,4.08,"22 US fl.oz. bomber poured into a tulip pint glass...  A - Dark brown (or very deep mahogany) colour to it. The head is very foamy at first, then it settles down to about a finger in thickness. Very nice lacing and good head retention. Looks beautfiyl.  S - Not that intense of a smell (probably because the beer isn't that fresh). Roasted malts, bitter chocolate, a tint of coffee. Some earthy hops and a fair amount of smoke.  T - A wonderful roasted and smoked profile. Pretty sweet for a porter, but the sweetness is not pushing the limits. Some earthy hops. The smoke adds an extra layer of meatiness to the beer. The after-taste is full of roasted malt and chocolate notes; the bitterness is not too strong. Very balanced and flavourful. I like how the bitterness, which is pretty intense, is suppressed by the sweetness and the smokiness.  M - Medium-to-full body. Quite thick, but very smooth, even creamy. Not much carbonation. A slight slight warming sensation from the alcohol. Moderately dry and bitter.  D - Good. This is a very drinkable porter. Goes down smoothly. Each sip is enjoyable.  Overall, this is a fantastic porter, and another very solid beer from Stone.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Smoked Porter,89

Has a large, rocky head that dissipates slowly and leaves nice lacing.  Smell: Smoky with roasted malt and coffee notes.  Taste: Starts off smoky and bitter. Develops into a smoky, roasted character with hints of bittersweet chocolate, coffee, and caramel.  Mouthfeel: Smooth and full-bodied.  Drinkability: Another win for Stone. This is an excellent porter with a rich, smoky flavor. It's more sessionable than most of Stone's other offerings, which only makes it better in my opinion. Definitely worth a shot and definitely something I'll have again.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Smoked Porter,89

147,90,BeerdedEric,3.54,"A light khaki decent size head. A dark ruby red body. I can see some bubbles.  I'm kind of shocked on the way of smell here. All I smell is a very light smokiness, light hops and malts. Nothing really that great.  A decent body... Somewhat thick which is good for a porter. Not much carbonation and smooth. Leaves the mouth slightly dry.  You definitely can notice the nice smokiness with the first sip. It's a little bitter. The dark malts and even the somewhat spicy hops make its presence known. The spice isn't ass-kicking in any way but there's a subtle hint of it. A slight coffee taste from the dark malts. I like it. There really isn't an alcohol taste to it; which is good because I've noticed that a lot with other Stone Brewery offerings.  Drink Ability: for a porter I can drink this all night. Don't know how I'd feel in the morning, doesn't really matter because I wake up in the afternoon anyway.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Smoked Porter,89

Head is light brown, creamy on top and comprised of tight smallish bubbles. Leaves moderate lacing on it's way down to a thin coating.  Taste - Dark fruits and sweet toffee. Dark malts combine with moderate bitterness. Sweet finish. Smoke is mild in the background and only enhances the other flavors. It is not overpowering. Finishes with earthy, piney hops.  Mouthfeel - Moderate body and carbonation bite. Bitterness lingers a while and seems to mildly coat the mouth. Mild, style appropriate astringency on the back of the mouth.  Drinkability - Very drinkable.

147,90,Satchboogie,4.43,"22oz bomber, expired best by date (02/18/10), poured into a Sam Adam's Perfect Pint glass and then a Smuttynose pint glass.  A: Dark brown, red mahogany colors when held to the light, slightly opaque. Pours with a massive 3-finger mocha-colored head, very foamy and inviting. Dissipates fairly quickly but left really good web-like lacing on the regular pint glass. Head maintains a thin froth, like that of a good espresso.  S: Lots of chocolate, roasted malts, coffee, slightly smokey background is present and the alcohol esters come through just a bit.  T: Again, the chocolate and coffee come through strong, tasting like a good mocha espresso. The smoke is definitely present and inviting, but plays a background role, letting the traditional porter flavors shine. The nice smokey roasted character is balanced perfectly with a little sweetness (caramel and a little hop). Alcohol esters do make their self known, but in the background enough to not becoming unpleasant.  M: This didn't have as much viscosity as I expected, it was fairly thin for such a sweet chocolaty porter. However, it was exceptionally smooth and had very little bitterness in the finish, thanks to the sweet caramel and hops. The carbonation is fairly light and I enjoyed it more and more as it disappeared.  D: I went through 2 glasses very easily, which is what I expected given the lower alcohol content (6%). It just seemed to go down perfectly and I couldn't keep my hands off of it. There is really nothing more I could want in drinkability.  I was definitely worried about this being expired, especially at only 6% ABV, but it didn't disappoint. I'm sure the flavors were probably more mellow than when it was bottled, but they still were delicious. Stone is quickly becoming one of my favorite breweries.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Smoked Porter,89

There's chocolate malt and a little smoke in the nose, but just the bare minimum in order to be noticed. I don't like super smokey beers, but this was a little low on the smoke imo.  Dark and well roasted. There's a nice hop bitterness underlying it all (it is a Stone beer after all). I didn't get any smoke at all in the flavor. It drinks fairly light and it's very smooth. Dry on the finish.  Not my favorite porter, but it drinks easily so I'd have no problem finishing a bomber of this.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Smoked Porter,89
147,90,beagle75,3.73,"Poured from a bomber into a wine goblet.  A: The full glass appears opaque black color with one finger of beige foam head. Later the beer appears clear dark brown color as less remains. Light lacing remains on the glass.  S: Dark roasted malt is the main contributor to smell here, with faint wood smoke, cola, and coffee grounds also detectable.  T: Begins with sharp acidity associated with coffee, as well as balancing earth. In the middle the acidity mellows, allowing faint dark fruit and cardboard to emerge. The finish is earthy with moderate bitterness, displaying more stale coffee. No wood smoke is explicitly detected in the flavor.  M: Light to medium viscosity with moderate carbonation. The tactile presence of this beer is unremarkable on the palate.  D: Don't be fooled by the 'smoked' descriptor here--unlike Alaskan Brewing's own smoked porter, this beer is a versatile, mainstream porter first and a smoked beer second. The phantom of smoke found here enhances this beer without type-casting it as something only to be served when a true rauchbeer is required.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Smoked Porter,89

Very complex and interesting.  Mouthfeel is light, and carbonation is prickly. Very refreshing.  This is an interesting, light, yet complexly flavored porter. A beer that is more about the taste than the alcohol. Very sessionable.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Smoked Porter,89
147,90,Eriktheipaman,3.88,It poured a dark black which was to be expected. And had a dark brown head that soon dissolved.  The smell was of chocolaty coffee but with a sweet earthiness of hops which usually isnt the case with Porters.  Same goes for the taste it has fairly chocolate coffee malt flavor but has a hop sweetness to it. I havnt had a whole lot of Porters considering but this is an exceptional beer for me being a hop head. Its not super hoppy by any means but gives a good bite for the style.

Dark chocolate abounds with some dark fruits and black coffee also. Spicy and bitter in the taste. The taste starts initially as spicy but then throws a coffee tasting bitterness followed by a campfire smoke-like swallow. Works very well. The only thing I really wasn't digging was the mouthfeel. It was rather thin for such a chewy tasting beer. Very easy drinking though the ""smoked"" part of the porter may be a little much for some.

The taste is interesting, but maybe only because I haven't had a smoked beer before. Upfront there are some standard roasted malt flavors, though not too powerful. Then the smoke flavor comes in....sly, not with too much oomph, but it's definitely there and it leads the beer to its finish, where there's a mild but persistant hoppy bitterness to it. The bitterness has a way of lasting through the finish and well into the aftertaste for some time.  This porter isn't especially thick, nor is it especially malty, but it is quite unique. The malts seem a little restrained, but I suppose that's to let the smokiness through. Also, I have to give them credit for not making the smoke too powerful...if they had, that'd have ruined the beer.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Smoked Porter,89

On the nose I'm getting a good deal of toasty flavors, some coffee and chocolate, but underneath that there seem to be some piney hops. On the tongue the coffee and some subtler smoke notes come through. In the mouth it's a good deal thinner and lighter than a lot of the porters and stouts I like, which is refreshing, not cloying at all, but full enough to be satisfying. Obviously it's not waterish but it's not laborious. Like an svelte English game gun versus a Winchester Model 21. Both are great, but very different.

I'm watching UFC Unleashed as I write this review and sip on this awesome beer.  The look is very nice, deep dark brown against the glass and slightly black in the center but still not as dark as I thought it would be, but still very nice. The head is very minimal but expected. The smell is very good. Dark chocolate, licorice, caramel, and dates fill my cognac glass. It's a wonderful smell because it doesn't tire the nose and it definitely doesn't get old. The taste is very good, dark chocolate and dark roasted coffee are big on the buds. The caramel and licorice play lesser roles in the taste but still provide some of the character of the porter. You get a little hoppy aftertaste, but it's minimal. Overall, I think I just fell in love.  This is a heavy bodied brew but still quite surprisingly pretty high on drinkability.

147,90,drabmuh,4,"Three smoked porters tasted side by side at Churchkey last night, regular, vanilla and chipotle. Served in a wine glass.  Beer is black / dark brown with a thin broken head of brown tiny bubbles that leaves minimal lacing on the glass. Carbonation is low, they all three looked exactly the same.  Aroma is mildly smoky and roasty, smells really nice.  Beer is medium bodied and has this mild sweetness to start and finishes out with a some nice roast and mild smoke. I really enjoyed this beer and the elaborations on the beer with the different flavors.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Smoked Porter,89
147,90,mklinger,3.21,"Poured into a pint glass. Jet black with creamy mocha head. Plenty of lacing left behind.  Aroma was bitter coffee. Bit of earthy hops. Not much smoke presence.  Taste was that of a solid porter with just a hint of smoke. I was surprised by the subdued nature of the smoke. Usually Stone is pushing some limits. I found this to be a surprisingly low-key beer. Well, brewed, decent flavors, but subdued.  Mouthfeel was good. More ale like than stout like, making this a fairly easy to drink beer. It just wasn't a beer I was excited to drink.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Smoked Porter,89
147,90,Yimosan,3.82,"22oz Bottle poured into my Spiegelau pint glass.  A: Espresso black with a light tan fluffy head. Decent lacing as it went down.  S: Smell of earthy hops, dark chocolate, coffee, and next morning campfire log; after it has been put out for a while.  T: Bakers chocolate, espresso, and certainly a nice smokiness in the back...not overwhelming, just right. Reminds me of Colgin's Hickory liquid smoke.  M: Full body and chewy. Finishes a bit too dry for my liking, but beautifully crafted nonetheless.  D: Next time I drink this beer, I will grill a nice steak with my balsamic vinegar infused asparagus and a side of Caesar salad.  Salud!",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Smoked Porter,89
147,90,JackieTH,4.32,"Appearance: Dark brown/black, with tan head. Heavy lacing.  Smell: Very robust and if you stick your nose in the glass it's definitely smokey, reminescent of malty/caramel deeply roasted over a campfire of beech, ironwood and peat. Hints of chocolate and coffee.  Taste: Chocolate right up front, mild notes of french roasted coffee and toasted bread, smoke is present throughout and although less intense than in the nose, it has an even more peaty nature. Good complexity but well balanced with a light hopping that arrives toward the finish. After the finish, smoke lingers, becoming even more pronounced.  Mouthfeel: Full bodied and rich, yet easy to drink.  Drinkability: This is a big porter and a great beer especially so with the smoke. Easy to drink. That said, bring it on.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Smoked Porter,89
147,90,grittybrews,4.35,"Poured a clean black into a tulip with around an inch of fluffy, light tan head (good retention). Slightly sweet aroma with mild smoke, roasty coffee, chocolate, and caramel.  Moderate carbonation and a full, creamy mouthfeel. Smoke punch up front followed quickly by a nice balance of dark chocolate, caramel, and coffee. Hops bitterness emerges on the finish and further emphasizes the smoke character.  Easy drinking and relatively light, yet complex and balanced. Excellent offering from Stone!",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Smoked Porter,89
147,90,ism,4.23,"22oz bottle poured into a pint glass, the taupe head quickly rising with energy. Very dark brown body with amber notes, almost opaque. Lacing is thick and beautiful.  Eagerly sniffing, taking in the deep chocolate notes of roasted malt, and phenols of smoke. Thin-medium body, robust roasted character with caramel, smoke phenol, with a nice smoke astringency, slightly earthy, a bit of bread, and an interesting hop bitterness. Finishes dry with lingering smoke.  Very balanced, with just enough smoke to make it interesting, and pairs very well with smoked meat and an aged Gouda. Started off drinking it by itself but ended preparing a cheese plate just for it with Polder 1-year goat Gouda and Cowgirl Creamery Mt Tam (triple cream). So satisfied!",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Smoked Porter,89
147,90,biboergosum,4.03,"22oz bomber, picked up when I was in lovely Missoula, Montana this past summer.  This beer pours a clear, dark ruby amber colour, with two fat fingers of thick, rocky, and foamy beige head, which leaves an unbroken wall of skewed bicycle chain lace around the glass as it gently melts away.  It smells of roasted caramel malt, wet ash, some meaty brine, bitter chocolate powder, a faint oily nuttiness, and a sturdy earthy, leafy hoppiness. The taste is rather heavily toasted caramel malt, acrid smoked meat, further peaty smoke, chalky cocoa, creamed coffee, and grassy, floral hops.  The carbonation is average in its frothy bearing, helping render the body smooth and even somewhat creamy, over a stout (sorry!) medium weight. It finishes increasingly off-dry, the now softly smoky caramel malt hardly dented by either ash or any lingering hops.  A very enjoyable and easy to put back smoked beer, at least compared to the few I've yet tried. Perfect as an accompaniment to watching this week's episode of Weeds - Stone is 'advertised' in the show!",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Smoked Porter,89
147,90,ProudBeerSnob,4.11,"Poured from a bomber into pint glass. Inky black, just a touch translucent, nice head that leaves good trails as the beer is enjoyed.  Porters are not very aromatic, and this one is less so. A little roasted malt, not much else.  Great flavor- chocolate notes predominate.  Mouthfeel a bit thin for the style. Very drinkable. I will drink this beer again.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Smoked Porter,89
147,90,begforme4484,4.25,"Nearly a black-brown with a big ol' tan head that clings to the glass very heavily.  Toffee and chocolate/dark chocolate definitely. Nice smokey smell too.  Huge chocolate flavor with a nice hop bitterness hidden in there. Lots of smoke, lingers a bit.  Very smooth, heavy bodied. Nice carbonation for a porter.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Smoked Porter,89
147,90,bwiechmann,4.05,"Poured from a bomber into a New Belgium globe glass.  A- Pours a deep, dark mahogany. Quite beautiful as the thick head stuck around for a little while and left big globs of sticky lacing behind as a reminder.  S- primarily roasted chocolate and dark malts, smokiness is not exaggerated and in fact plays only a minor background role in the nose. I am excited to drink this.  T- Follows the nose with chocolate up front followed by dark coffee notes and just a hint of smoke.  M- right on target for a porter such as this.  D- very drinkable- I was almost wishing my buddy wasn't here so I wouldn't have to split this. Oh well- that's what advocacy is about.  Overall, being a huge fan of smoked beer, I thought the smoke was underplayed by quite a bit. Maybe my bottle had a touch of age on it so it had faded but this is a porter first and a smoked beer a distant second (or maybe not at all?) But besides that, it truly is a delicious porter and I would seek it out again.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Smoked Porter,89
147,90,keith712,3.81,"Poured from a 22oz bomber into a chilled mug. Prominent, thick, 1""-2"" head that lingers a bit, nice lacing. Beautiful mahogany brown in color, fading to pitch black in the center of the mug. If you pour it aggressively it can get a huge head of at least 3+ inches :-)  Nose is mild at first, improving as it warms over a ten minute period before drinking. I can also smell some hops in there, nothing too strong though. Presence is mild and I thought the flavor might be mild as well.  Initial taste, wow, surprised me. Initially mild sweetness, with a complex character. Roasted malts, mild bitter chocolate, charred wood, smokey (as intended?). Fairly thin in the mouth. Finishes with a mild hops bitterness that compliments the first sweet tones. Definitely some bittersweet chocolate overtones and thicker than anticipated. Nicely dry and crisp, no oiliness at all. Leaves the mouth feeling refreshed and clean. At 5.9% abv this is an easily drinkable session beer and not overpowering, I can't wait to try it with some BBQ'd pork or a nice ribeye. I am quite surprised at the overall flavor and character.  Not really being familiar with the porter style of beers, I am hesitant to rate this too high, since there may well be something much better out there. Still, I am going to give this a 7 out of 10 based on it being much more flavorful than I expected based on the nose, and the drinkability of it. Definitely will have this again, next time, I WILL have some BBQ ready to go with it!",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Smoked Porter,89
147,90,crvcac,3.56,"Got this one from Olive Tree Marketplace. Appearance: dark, woody brown with a nice head and decent lacing Smell: faint odors. Pretty standard for a poter unless it's been overly hopped. Hints of roasted malt and smoke. Taste: nice roasted malt, medium body and hints of smoke. Well balanced hops subdue the roasted flavor. Drinkability: this medium booed beer goes down smooth and sits nicely on the palate. Overall: presumably forgettable, albeit highly quaffable. Good stuff",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Smoked Porter,89
147,90,tewaris,3.52,"Stone Smoked Porter Stone Brewing Co. Robust Porter 5.9% ABV OG? IBUs? 22 oz bomber with an enjoy by date of September 04, 2010 poured into a wide mouthed Gouden Carolus glass.  Appearance 5/5 As described on the bottle, dark and deep mahogany color. Clear, with a full, creamy, tan head from an aggressive pour that recedes to a thin head, but with a nice collar that leaves outstanding lacing. Inviting and true to style.  Aroma 3/5 I get no smoke at all. The first impression is a little coffee-like tartness with a burnt character. I would like to describe it better, but the aroma is weak. Dark chocolate once in a whiff. A few swirls and plenty of malty sweetness becomes evident. Even two days before it's freshness date, there's some hop aroma to be found: this is fine by me and not against the style either, but I do not deem hop aroma necessary in a dark ale of this kind. Again, this hop aroma is once in a whiff.  Taste 3/5 Sweet to begin with, with some roasty bitterness in the finish. Hoppy bitterness is also present. The coffee-like tartness of smell is very present, and compliments the initial sweetness. The taste wasn't impressive but the aftertaste is better and flavorful with specialty malts. Finish leans towards bitter but is not dry by any means: it is medium-long; there's bitterness, there's roast, and there's sweet. This will make a good session beer paired with food, but on its own, it's not much of an experience.  Mouthfeel 3/5 Thin and unimpressive. Glad that this beer was warm enough or it would've been harsh, which might be desirable in an IPA or Pilsner, but would've been thoroughly confusing here. Carbonation is at a suitable level.  Drinkability 5/5 It's low in alcohol, it has light body, so you could drink a few, but the question I'd ask myself is, what's the point? Yet, the fact remains that it could be a solid session beer.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Smoked Porter,89
147,90,Docer,4.2,"Finally trying a bottle of this... slightly aged bottle from a Whole Foods up here #inthecouve.. (slight gunk under the edges of the cap).  - Nice black brew.. slight ruby notes at the very edges in the light. Light off-white head.. leaves a nice subtle spotty layer and a large ring on top.  - Peppery earthy woody and salty porter.... like a flame smoked BBQ... subtle sweet grains, oats.. light bitterness.  - Very nice blend of grains, oats, chocolate, coffee... with a side profile of salt, smoked hickory.. woody earthiness.. light bitter hops.... all blended very well... super flavorful and balanced. I would love to taste what an Imperial Version of this would taste like.  - Medium bodied... mouth watering.... slightly sticky and dry.  - Overall one of the best porters out there readily available in 22oz. bottles. I was just thinking to myself that too many are all the same... and then comes Stones. Stands out for sure.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Smoked Porter,89
147,90,SpdKilz,4,"Appearance - Pours a dark chocolate brown into my SA perfect pint with about two fingers of rich, mocha colored head that quickly dissipates leaving decent lacing.  Smell - Nice earthy smokiness immediately present in the nose. Followed by roasted malts and dark chocolate/cocoa.  Taste - I believe this is my first ""smoked"" porter, and I'll be damned if it doesn't taste like you got a piece of ash in your mouth, haha. A definite smoky quality to the beer which is intermixed with roasted malts, just a hint of bitter cocoa, and perhaps it's my imagination but some coffee.  Mouthfeel - Medium bodied, decent carbonation, creamy, smooth.  Drinkability - Relatively so. I need to let this beer warm up a bit more but as of now the jury is out. It is a good beer, and I do like a good porter. However, something about the style is just holding me back a bit. Still, I can't wait to try to Beer Geek Bacon beer that I have in the refrigerator. Should be interesting to compare the two!",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Smoked Porter,89
147,90,rpbaldwin,4.03,"Poured into snifter. Head: Light tan to off white, moderate rentention. Aroma: Coffee, Smoke, Chocolate, noticed the chocolate and smoke most at first, but as it warmed, more coffee came through. Mouthfeel: A bit heavy on the mouthfeel for my taste Flavor: when first poured, it's strong of smoke and coffee notes, with a hint of chocolate, as it warms, the chocolate begins to become more pronounced with a subtle coffee/roasted malt character. Hop bitterness is present, but not overbearing. Lots of smoke in the finish. Color: Dark brown with some amber highlights, notably near the edges.  I poured cold and tasted it there, then warmed it up to see the balance of flavor across temperatures. I personally preferred the flavor when on the warmer end of the temperature spectrum. It's more smooth and feels more balanced and is like drinking a regular porter with a treat of some smoke.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Smoked Porter,89
147,90,LacquerHead,3.8,"Poured this into a Sam Adams pint. It poured almost pitch black. The little translucence let in a dark ruby color. It had a clingy off-white that lazily stuck around till the end.  It smelled like coffee and toffee mixed with vanilla ice-cream  The taste was similar to a gritty espresso. There was a slight hoppiness to it at first; that flavor went away as the beer got warmer. At times there was a graham cracker flavor that would show up. The smoked element was lingering in the background and would crop up now and again.  D: This was a good sipping beer.  Conclusion: this was a good porter that bordered on a stout. While it was good, I wouldn't be rushing back to drink it. There was something about made me want to move on. I might buy this on occasion or if I was complementing a dessert.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Smoked Porter,89
147,90,Chickenhawk9932,4.36,"Looks as dark as night in the middle with some mohogany highlights around the edges capped with a caramel head.  Smells of hearty whole grain bread, lots of barley and malt.  Chocolate and coffee hit the palate first, then some licorice comes through. The finnish is dry almost oaky. This one is more on the bitter side, but that works - A delightful taste and feel.  A decently drinkable porter. I will be getting more. Pairs nice with ""Wicked Sharp"" cheese. Would go well with BBQ chicken.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Smoked Porter,89

Mouthfeel - A real treat, coats the palette nice with dark smokey afteraste. Nothing abouth this beer is overpowering, letting me enjoy each drink after drink. I meen, i can taste another beer if i choose, but really, i dont want anything else.  Drinkability - If i was told to make a list of 5 porters to drink , this would make it.

147,90,Brenden,4.26,"Notes are about a week old but thorough...  I may have gotten the elusive perfect pour, but that's just what the appearance is here: perfect. This brew is a very rich, deep brown that doesn't quite hit black. Stone's given me this before, but the head is amazing. It pours out big enough that I have to wait awhile. After it dissipates, it's one of the thickest, densest, rockiest heads I've ever seen on a beer, and it never gets smaller than 2 fingers. Lacing is left behind like a tattered curtain to the very bottom. Maybe not everyone gets an appearance like this, but I didn't pour it special and it was just in a dimpled mug. The aroma is, of course, smoky, reminiscent of a wood fire with charred wood notes and a touch of charcoal. There's a light, even sweetness underneath that i wasn't expecting and perhaps some herbal leaf tinge from some hops underneath a robust malt. It's not quite as strong as the flavor, though it certainly isn't weak. There's a touch of slightly acidic (?) ester lingering as well. Smoke, smoke,smoke, of course, all over the tongue on a sturdy malt backbone. Heavily roasted with notes of bittersweet baker's chocolate and coffee with stronger notes of charred woods and charcoal as in the nose. This is what I imagine when I thing ""smoked porter."" This one's big, rich and robust, drinking more like a stout than a porter. Body is full and carbonation is light, and there's a light bite and smoothness that isn't amazing but makes for a good feel. There's no reason I wouldn't drink a few of these in a sitting, though I couldn't down them all too quickly. This is a great effort at a smoked beer.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Smoked Porter,89
147,90,earthboundagain,4.05,"From Notes:  I was really looking forwards to this brew, glad I finally get to try it.  The beer pours a very dark brown, but has the tiniest of ruby highlights, the tan head is nice and laces well. I detect a wee whiff of smoked malt, along with some chocolate malt and a hint of fresh roast coffee. Ok the taste is a roast coffee with a touch of bittersweet chocolate; the smoke is subtle and does not dominate. The beer is smooth but has a bit of bitterness to dry the back end out, the carbonation is right on. I like this beer goes well with some smoked oysters.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Smoked Porter,89

The head is quite sticky.  S - Aromas is a bit subdued. Some hints of toasty malts with some mild oats and some mild chocolate as well. The chocolate aroma is the most prevalent of them.  T - Nice soft and fluffy flavors of toasted malt starts off with some nice sweet brown sugar. There are some nice chocolate hints, melted fresh chocolate bars with sweet and slight bitter hints. Finishes nice and smooth with a slight dry toasted finish.  M & D - It is smoother and creamier than the pour indicates with a nice full body and great carbonation.

This is VERY nice. If there was anything to change, I'd want just a bit more intensity.  Taste: Definitely more smoke present than in the aroma, but it's not astringent, as some smoked beers I've had.

Taste: A slight woody smokiness with lots of bittersweet coffee and chocolate up front, finishing with a lot more smokiness and roasted bitterness.

Pours black, with ruby-brown highlights showing around the edges of the glass, and a big, long lasting, fluffy mocha head on top. Really nice lacing.  Nose has a light woody smokiness to it, nice earthy roastiness with some dry cocoa layered underneath. A bit on the light side, I like to see a more robust nose on a smoked porter or stout, but still quite good.  Taste begins with said woody smokiness, with a bit of a dry campfire quality, complemented by a rich, earthy cocoa and light caramel sweetness that fades quickly into a light balancing roastiness on the finish that works well with the lightly smoked quality. I feel like I get a bit of chicory in this one, also.  Mouthfeel is fairly light bodied, maybe medium-light, with a nice, smooth creaminess from the head that really works well. Carbonation is light-ish but plenty present, smooth. Really nice mouthfeel.  Drinkability is spot on. Perfectly balanced between smokey, roasty, rich, and earthy, with just the perfect amount of sweetness to emerge to complement everything else that's going on.

While I find many porters to be interesting and well made, this really bent some of the preconceived notions I had, as to what a beer should be. Appearance is magnificently thick and rich poured into a clear pint glass leaving a couple...oops, I poured too hard...three and a half fingers of cream colored head with wisps of tan throughout. The aroma is smoky and full of that charred porter goodness that many of us love. The smoke is so well balanced here that it flows seamlessly through the flavor. They do not joke when they suggest barbecue on the bottle. The flavors are sweet and malty up front with the smoke beginning to rise in the mid-palate and by the time that roasted char comes through in the finish the smoke peaks and hangs around like a campfire in the early morning.

Those flavors are pleasant and mild in the aftertaste (smokiness is especially subdued), but the first taste is overwhelmingly molasses Mouthfeel is smooth, even a bit watery. Smells and looks... like a dark beer, head was a bit off white in my $ .25 tumbler.  Tasted great with my stir-fry, though would have tasted just as good with dessert, barbeque, or McDonalds'.

147,90,BDTyre,4.52,"Dark ruby-brown appearance, but the head is ridiculous - its about 3 inches thick and really doesn't settle down.  Smokey, somewhat milky smell, combined with chocolate, toffee and sweet, sugary coffee. The smokiness is noticeable, but fairly tame. This smells almost like Camp coffee.  A bit more tart taste, and the smokiness is a bit more noticeable, but this still has an almost coffee-and-cream flavour to it, with a bit of sugar in it. Chocolate, burnt toffee and butter swirl around in the flavour.  Mouthfeel is bang-on - low natural carbonation. A very nice beer to drink - a really mild, subtle smokey profile not at all typical of a smoked beer.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Smoked Porter,89
147,90,j37geogaddi,4.13,"Pours out an almost black velvety color with minimal lacing.  Smells of roasted coffee beans with a hint of chocolate.  The taste is really smokey and smooth. The dark chocolate flavors come through and share the spotlight with coffee notes and maybe some vanilla in the backround. Some slight warm alcohol also makes it, making it taste a bit heavier than it is- which isn't really bad. The finish is definitely smooth coffee- pretty damn nice.  Carbonated nicely, not too much, which I actually like for the Porter style. Maybe lacks some body though.  Totally drinkable. I could throw back a few glasses. The smokey flavor really makes it interesting.  It's really satisfying and tasty. And at the totally reasonable price of $5.25 a bomber, which I paid, I absolutely will be buying this again. Once again, more proof Stone's offerings are rarely matched.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Smoked Porter,89
147,90,dwilson01,3.98,"poured from a bomber into my arrogant bastard pint glass, rich mocha head tops the brew, creamy looking and dissipates evenly leaving thick lacing on the glass. The body is very dark, glows with an embery red around the edges when held up to the light.  The scent is very malt forward and smooth from what I think is a lot of crystal malt. There is a roasted scent there as well, not too much coffee but it exists, it's more woody in the scent than anything else, somewhat smokey.  The taste is extremely mellow, there are barely disernable hops present but mainly what I get in the aftertaste is the smoked dark wood although it doesn't seem burnt to me at all which is interesting. It gets all the smokey flavor in it with no extra dryness from a heavy heavy roast of the malt. The smokey flavor balances the sweetness of the malt, like toasted russian rye bread to me.  The mouthfeel is great, so incredibly smooth it surprised me with that aspect. Not thin in body at all, it's full and delicious. Makes it drinkable as hell because it goes down so fricken easy, I Like it, great representation of a porter",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Smoked Porter,89

147,90,BeerNemesis,4.1,"Stone Smoked Porter | 650 ml. | 5.9% ABV | 2010  Brewer: Stone Brewing Co. Style: American Porter Glass: Pint  Appearance: An attractive mahogany brown with lively ruby highlights. It also features a blossoming 2"" khaki head.  Aroma: It smells... distinguished -- Like a cappuccino and a fine cigar. Smoky, malty, mocha, and dark chocolate.  Taste: Roasted coffee malt flavors and a luscious extra-dark chocolate backdrop set the scene. A mild smoky taste picks up mid-sip and lingers long after. I'm impressed by the level hop bitterness, which adds a punchy balance to otherwise mellow nature of the brew.  Mouthfeel: Full-bodied and rich with a silky smooth mouthfeel.

The flavor was of malt, nutty, and woody notes. It had a medium feel on the palate with medium carbonation. Overall all of the flavors in this brew were very subtle and tame.

Smell: Roasted/chocolate malts, coffee, and some syrupy sweetness and smoke.  Taste: Syrupy sweet at the front that moved into a nice bit of roasted/chocolate malts in the middle and finished up with a coffee flavor in the back. Smoke is a little stronger on the back end, but ties everything together.  Mouthfeel: Medium-to-full and velvet smooth. Light-to-moderate carbonation.  Drinkability: Goes down very nicely, but not exactly quaffable.  Final Notes: A good beer to serve with barbecued or grilled foods, or as an after-dinner treat.

Interesting aroma of roasted and smoked malts, blending seamlessly together with notes of chocolate, hints of dark fruits.

This is an excellent and well balanced beer!",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Smoked Porter,89

Smells of roasted malts with some hoppiness. Crisp and refreshing. A hint of smoke in the smell.  Taste definitely lives up to the name, with a nice smokiness up front, which is not at all overpowering. The roasted malts are balanced with a bit of hoppiness. Some dark chocolate and a hint a dark fruit, as well.  Mouthfeel is medium bodied, average carbonation.  Drinkability is high. Taste is good, goes down easy, and the ABV is not too high.

And then the smokiness creeps in, but in a really balanced way. I get a hint of hops too, though the smokiness is certainly covering much of the hop aroma.  Excellent flavour. Good rich chocolate and caramel sweetness, then some roasted flavours which combine seamlessly with the smoky flavour. The smoke is very apparent, but never over the top.  Mouthfeel is good, but not excellent. For this type of beer I'd like it a little chewier. As it is, its pleasantly medium bodied which certainly isnt a problem.  Drinkability is relatively high for what it is.  An impressively crafted beer.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Smoked Porter,89
147,90,USSDOLPHINSailor,3.75,I like this beer. Would not drink it everyday. I believe any smoked cheese would go great with this beer. I immediately thought munster cheese or Gouda would be great with this brew. Grilled trout would seem perfect with this porter.  One 22 oz of this beer per meal is my limit. Then I want to go on to some other style.,Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Smoked Porter,89
147,90,PDXHops,4.32,"Bomber poured into a Duvel tulip.  Pours very dark brown with some ruby highlights. Decent retention on the creamy tan head, nice sticky lacing.  Just a hint of smoke in the nose, but it definitely smells like a porter should. Rich and toasty, a touch of chocolate, a touch of fruitiness.  Smoke flavor is apparent right away, but it never threatens to overwhelm (unlike, say, Alaskan Smoked Porter, which is downright meaty). Full bodied and smooth, this is quite a substantial beer. Moderate chocolate sweetness with a ton of dark roast. A hint of charred wood and a fair amount of bitterness. Seems to get fluffier/thicker toward the finish. A bit of smoke and coffee in the finish.  Overall impression: Excellent restrained use of smoky flavor. Top notch.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Smoked Porter,89
147,90,blackc5,3.68,"Served on tap in a pint glass. Probably a bit over chilled (40-45F'ish)...  A - A quite dark brown, bordering on black. Served with minimal but nicely thick cream colored head. Quite good retention and decent lacing.  S - Lots of roasted malt, and smokey peat. Some heavily roasted coffee bean and burnt caramel. Molasses.  T - A fairly typical porter with a bit of extra smoke in the background. The smoke is fairly subdued, and I am not feeling exactly what it offers as it seems to distract the palate as much as anything. I do think this is a decent porter otherwise, but I was expecting more from Stone here.  M - Fairly smooth and balanced with a dry finish. Somewhat high carbonation.  D - All in all this is a decent beer, but by no means one of the better porters I have tried. The smoke seems like a bit of a novelty to me.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Smoked Porter,89

It appears a very dark brown color with a tan head that doesn't retain too well outside of a thin lace on top of the brew. Nose has a classic porter aroma with roasted malt coupled with what seems like Pete smoked malt dominating the back end. The taste of pete smoked malt also dominates the flavor that lingers through the long aftertaste. Medium feel and moderately carbonated. As it warms, more standards porter characteristics come through to win the fight of porter verse smoked malt. Flavors of bitter chocolate and coffee also come through in the nose. Pretty good with some citrus hops even evident in the finish.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Smoked Porter,89

Taste -- Begins bitter and smoky, opening up to some roast malt flavor, along with some bitter coffee and dark chocolate. Finish is all roast and smoke. Very smoky, very bitter.  Mouthfeel -- Medium-heavy body, with moderate carbonation.  Drinkability -- This beer didn't quite meet all my expectations. I would've preferred it to be a little more smooth and more sweet malt character to balance out the smoke and acridity. Not bad, but not spectacular.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Smoked Porter,89
147,90,RDHerm,4.05,"Pours an incredible dark brown, almost black, with faint but very deep ruby highlights. Has a thick cream-colored head, one of the thickest I've ever seen on a porter. After time it thins out substantially, but it still holds throughout.  Not a particularly strong aroma, but still quite nice. A good smoky smell, accompanied by solid notes of coffee and chocolate.  A great smoky taste - strong, but not overpowering. Solid flavors of malt and chocolate, followed by slight coffee aftertaste. A bit more bitter than I expected, but not necessarily in a bad way.  Excellent body. A bit lighter than expected, but falls nicely between medium and heavy. Fitting level of carbonation, a nice fizz, but not too bubbly. Has a good creamy feel to it.  Very smooth. Lower alcohol content makes it easily drinkable, but with the stronger flavor I probably wouldn't drink more than one.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Smoked Porter,89

147,90,jjanega08,4.52,A= one thing I love is a smoked porter... Lets do this thang! The pour is classic porter look. A nice black color with some deep amber highlights when held to the light. A nice two finger head on it that is a slightly off white color falls to about a half finger high and stays there throughout the drink. Decent lacing.  S= Pretty pungent. There is a really beautiful smoke smell wafting from this glass. Not really the common bonfire smoke you get a lot of times which I love but more of a nice mellow smoke odor. The porter underneath the smoke is just as beautiful. Nice roast and chocolate to it. Excellent smell.  T= The taste is also wonderful. The smoke seems to be really controled. This isn't a smoke beer where the smoke dominates but one where the smoke sort of plays with the porter flavors and just jumps in through out the taste to say whats up from time to time. Really well balanced. The roast and chocolate from the porter is delicous.  M= Smooth. Luxury. This beer feels great. A nice balance between stout and pale ale.  D= Great brew. I love smoked porters to death. Porters are my favorite and when they get smoked it's awesome. This beer didn't let down. Delicous and complex without too much smoke in it. Seek this out.,Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Smoked Porter,89
147,90,weatherdog,3.68,"On tap at Brixies in Brookfield Il, served in a shaker pint glass  It pours a very dark brown with a dense cream head. Medium to heavy lacing stuck to the glass sides  The nose has a medium level of dark smoked malts and behind that some nice chocolate smells.  The taste has a pretty typical porter flavors with some chocolate and coffee and then behind that the smoke starts, it's on the low to medium level. i personally prefer when a beer says its smoked for it to bring it and this is more of an approachable smoked beer.  About half way through the sip my mouth seems to dry out. i get this sometimes with some smoked beers. It's really wierd and it's like cottonmouth. It's not a terribly bad thing and pretty subtle but I'd prefer it wasn't there. I don't even have a clue as to what causes it. The carbonation level was too high as well.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Smoked Porter,89
147,90,diabecktic,4.5,"Appearance: Roughly ~3 fingers of creamy, light-tan head form quickly upon pouring. Retention is excellent, as it takes several minutes for ~3 fingers to dissipate. The beer itself appears to be black, but when held up to the light you can see a dark, cherry red color. Carbonation isn't really visible, and the lacing is excellent.  Smell: A robust, smoky dark chocolate/coffee malt is complimented by just enough of a hop aroma to make itself known. A dark fruit adds additional complexity, but at this point I can't discern what it is.  Taste: The taste is very much like the nose, but I find it even more complex. A dark chocolate malt seems to be the centerpiece, but I can distinctly pick out notes of coffee, plum (maybe raisin?), caramel, and a slight hint of licorice in the aftertaste. Hops add balance towards the end, and an underlying woody smokiness seems to tie everything together.  Mouthfeel: I was expecting the dark, sweet malt to impart excessive density, but I didn't find this to be the case. The body is nearly perfect for the content; it's on the ever-so-slightly heavier side of medium. Complex sweet and smoky flavors tantalize the tongue; flavor improves upon slight warming.  Drinkability: This beer is very drinkable. It's complex without being overpowering, and the alcohol content is on the higher end of what one would call a session beer. You might protest if you're some sort of purist, but this is an excellent beer to enjoy sipping with nearly anything (though the bottle provides some suggestions).  Summary: I might be committing some type of sin by saying this, but I might actually like this beer a bit more than Stone's classic Arrogant Bastard. Though I couldn't rate any one section as perfect, I felt that nearly every aspect of the tasting was ALMOST perfect. Again, this is an extremely complex beer which is very drinkable; the balance is the one thing which I most want to emphasize. Beers like this are what keep me coming back to the Stone Brewing Company.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Smoked Porter,89

A - Deep black, with a short-lived mocha head that turns into a smoky ring with lacing on the glass. Looks a lot like an imperial stout.  S - Doesn't smell like an impy stout. The nose is like sitting around a campfire cooking s'mores, but in a very subtle way.  T - Wonderful. Bittersweet dark chocolate wrapped in hickory smoke. Some raisin notes as the beer warms.  M - Smooth, almost creamy. A lot like drawing on a well-packed pipe.  D - Had to force myself to savor this one. Especially with the low ABV, you could drink a bomber in a jiffy.

Roasted malt and coffee notes fill the nose. Almost similar to an iced coffee scent. Taste is big toasty maltiness, slightly smokey, though not overly so. Very good example of a robust porter. This porter feels surprisingly light in the mouth, not overly heavy in the least. Drinkability on this brew is good, due to the moderate alcohol content, and also in part of the great taste.

Insert dark syrupy adjective here. Lots of head formation, 2"" or so, mocha white.  S - Lightly smokey - less than expected. Has a solid roasted barley, light chocolate, and someone peppery note.  T - Starts off with a light chocolate sweetness, immediately accentuated by some roasted barley. Mid-stream is where a nice burnt log smoke note comes in, bringing the beer into balance. The first stone beer I've had with this low of a hop profile. Finishes with a lightly burnt, smoke barley.  M - Moderate body - creamy beer, but strongly supported by the carbonation. Finishes with a acidic clinging note from the smoked barley.  D - Easy drinking beer - especially considering the style. ABV is manageable, almost sessionable. For those desiring smoke flavors, often they can be way overdone - not so here.

Thick, fluffy, tan head with a ton of lacing.  The nose is like smoked jerky and roasted coffee. There's a moderate sweetness of chocolate.  I certainly respect smoked beers, but I've always found them hard to drink and have to be in the mood. With that being said, I love the subtlety of the smoked aspect in this one. It's present, but doesn't overpower the other notes of mostly coffee and some chocolate. The finish is long-lasting and is more that of coffee than smoke.  Mouthfeel is medium and is very smooth. Good carbonation and slightly dry on the palate.  Again, for a smoked beer I found this more drinkable than most.

The beer itself is completely opaque through the center, but the edges highlight a nice color. The head is thick and fluffy and the color of light brown sugar. The lacing is monstrously thick. This really looks incredible!  Smells like a nice dark robusto cigar. Deep chocolatey notes mix with a smokiness and ground espresso beans.  Taste is right on with nose. The smokiness helps it finish a little dry as opposed to super sweet. This thing had a great flavor.  I am surprised that this isn't thicker. It smells and tastes like it should have a fuller body, but it doesn't. It isn't overly filling, and the carbonation level is quite pleasant as well.  I could see this becoming I buy more regularly.

147,90,mullenite,4.07,"Glassware - 10oz Nonic  Appearance - Ridiculously dark red in color with a tan cap for a head. My wife was drinking an Aprihop which has a nice red tinge and it didn't even compare to the depth of color in this one. The best way to describe it is blood red. The lacing on the glass is pretty much a solid wall.  Nose - Smells of barbecue smoke, chocolate and roasted malts. The smoke adds a really interesting meaty, pork-like note.  Taste - Where the smoke is somewhat strong in the nose, it is subtle in the taste, adding a nice accent to the dark kilned malts, similar to a nice smokey coffee.  Mouthfeel - Body is good but it is slightly over carbonated in my opinion, kind of takes away from the smoothness of the flavor profile.  Overall - Even with the higher than anticipated carbonation this is a hugely drinkable beer. Very nice clean and balanced flavor.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Smoked Porter,89

It is a little different in the taste and finish department but identical in the look and consistency. Has a bit of a bitter finish that gives it some bite, unbelievably you can still taste a slight bit of hops, which is great in a porter, I barely taste the smoked flavor, which is fine by me because I am not a huge fan of that, but slightly in the aftertaste I can tell.  A well done beer by stone, I would buy this again for sure.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Smoked Porter,89

Hardly any fizz feel. Gritty. Robust. D) A well crafted porter. Not over the top with the smoke just right.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Smoked Porter,89
147,90,Jeffo,4.3,"Found this one at The Cracked Kettle in Amsterdam.  From a bomber into a snifter.  APPEARANCE: Pours a medium-thick, two finger tan head with great retention. Black body with next to zero carbonation evident. Head slowly fades to a decent film cap leaving some immediate lacing. A splotchy wisp and a ring remain, leaving some good lacing down the sides of the glass.  SMELL: A nice nose of roasted malts, hints of milk chocolate and coffee with a smoky undertone tying it all together. Quality.  TASTE: Roasted malts and a good amount of smokiness up front. Some notes of sweet mild chocolate and caramel through the middle, leading into some bitter coffee hints near the finish. A nice smokiness pulls everything together. A mild but nicely lingering bitter-sweet and smoky aftertaste is quite pleasant as well. Great job here.  PALATE: Medium body with medium carbonation. Creamy smooth on the palate, goes down smooth and finishes slightly dry on the palate.  OVERALL: A very tasty smoked porter to say the least. A very complex flavor profile and everything blends together excellently. I quite enjoyed this one, and the bomber emptied far too quickly. One I'll be on the lookout for whenever I get a chance to cross the border. Recommended.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Smoked Porter,89
147,90,rarbring,3.63,"The beer is very dark brown, almost black. The head is beige, compact and leaves lacing.  The smell is mostly smoky, heavily roasted malt. Coffee and grilled sauseges.  A sweet taste, port, smoked meet and coffee in the taste. The bitterness is a bit raw.  Rather much carbonation, a dry finish.  Well, not a bad beer at all, possibly could my bottle have improved by storing it.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Smoked Porter,89

The flavors meld nicely to deliver a delicious porter.  M - full bodied and a good amount of carbonation  D - I guess I was expecting a lot more smoke and burnt malts.

It is a brilliant mahogany around the edges and bottom and fades into a dark brown, almost black in the center. Looks awesome.  S: Smell is of dark chocolate, a litte bit of coffee, some light smokiness and sweet caramel.  T: Immediately get the smokiness and chocolate. I sense a little bit of coffee and definitely some sweet caramel. It finishes slightly bitter, but not in a bad way. The taste is very layered; you get every individual accent without one being overpowering.  M: Medium body and very smooth on the tongue with some slight carbonation. The smoky flavor hangs around and leaves a slightly dry finish.  D: I was able to enjoy the entire 22 oz. bottle with a grilled rib-eye steak, which was the perfect pair! I bumped it down a bit just because I don't think it would be as drinkable without being paired with good food.  Overall a good buy.

The beer itself is a rich dark brown with only hints of translucence around the edges.  Smell: A little bit of the smoked malts come out but more so the coffee. Pretty typical smell.  Taste: The smoked malts come out much more in the taste. A fine tasting porter with a bit of bitter at the finish.  Mouth: Sweet with a nice medium body, light carbonation.

Almost black, but nothing like a stout  S: Didn't get any of the ""smoke"" in the initial nose, but i did get a fair amount of chocolate and a little toffee.  T: A great taste that could only be expected of a porter. Dark Chocolate makes a first impression, and leaves a little bit of that sweet, smoky taste afterwards. If you are used to that latent sweetness common to porters, the ""smoke"" in this one almost (emphasis on almost) covers it up. A very pleasant, and welcome surprise.  M: Nice and smooth on the tongue, though not something that will feel refreshing. The smoky sweetness can be felt for quite a bit.  D: A very good pour.

147,90,exparte,4.1,"22 oz. bottle. Moderately strong and complex aroma that's primarily dark chocolate and licorice with a dark fruit element, maybe dark cherries or blackberries. Color is a deep ruby, almost black, with a inch thick, creamy, espresso-colored head that quickly subsides to a fine layer which laces thinly down the glass. I don't know what Koch is talking about because the peat malt is unquestionably the defining character of this beer. Still, it's not overwhelming so you can still enjoy the bittersweet chocolate malt behind it. The texture could be a bit thicker but the beer still manages to be rather creamy and soft.

Smells of light floral hops, sweet malts: molasses, honey and brown sugar. Some tempting vegemite as well.  Taste: Whats this??? A Stone beer not cranked up to 11?? I've had to recalibrate. I generally brace myself on the first sip of one of Stone's beers with their aggresive and in your face (generally) hop inspired ales, and I did this time round. Needlessly. This is a (initially dissapointingly) subtle beer for Stone. But NOT a dissapointing one. Quite the contrary. Some gently sweet malts: more molasses and honey. Subtle veal stock/gravy notes, nice background smoke flavour. More delicious yeasty vegemite.The Stone hops are present and obvious, slightly floral and oily, but they are not the main act. This is balanced quite well, but a slight lack of roasted malt and/or hop bitterness for mine.  The body is medium, smooth but a little weak - medium carbonation adds a touch.  Drinkable? Yes.

Not bad.  m - Medium body with moderate carbonation, it is pretty smooth and creamy.  d - Overall this was an interesting porter.

Was able to pick up the aroma much better after multiple sips.  Nice mix of smoky, coffee / espresso, chocolate, tobacco, and raisin flavors. Smokiness was very well balanced by the sweeter flavors, not overpowering.  Thin feel. No syrupy aftertase that can sometimes bog down porters.  Easily drinkable.

147,90,NittanyBeerFan,3.96,"A: The pour itself seems less viscous that I expected. Once in the glass, the color is a deep and rich mahogany with ruby hues in around the edges of the glass. The head that forms lasts only briefly, reaching its pinnacle at height of about 2 cm. Lacing comes in a coarse and wide spiderweb around the sides of the glass, but interestingly enough, I don't get anything around the back of the glass, as it faces me.  S: Given how rich Stone's beers usually are, I was expecting a big roast and smokey aroma, but I didn't really get that. Instead, I ended up with more chocolatey and coffee aromas. Not bad by any stretch of the imagination, but somewhat disappointing given this beer's name.  T: The smoke comes through a bit more here, but again, it seems a bit too understated. Luckily, there are some other substantial flavors that come through as well. Coffee, roasted malts, caramel, and chocolate all add to the complex character of this beer and draw my attention away from the lack of smoke.  M/D: Despite my initial impression of this beer's viscosity as somewhat thin, the feel is really anything but. More substantial than some stouts that I have enjoyed, the feel is creamy and smooth. The carbonation that produced that nice thick and creamy head has disappeared, and allows my sips to slide down my throat. This is a very enjoyable beer, and I reached the end of the bottle before I expected to, as it goes down so easily.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Smoked Porter,89

Pours with a big two fingers of light tan head. Decent retention and lacing.  S: Dark roasted malts. Peat. Campfire. Some plum/prune on the finish. Alcohol is present, but it is neither distracting nor hot.  T: Dark fruits. Roasted malts. A faint smokiness. Dry, mildly bitter finish with a coffee-like acidity.  M: On the heavier side of medium with appropriate carbonation. A little lighter than what I was expecting.  D: I've had this one sitting around for about six months or so, figuring that a Stone porter could handle it, but now I'm not so sure. I can say I am not getting the heavy smoke that some of the other reviewers were getting - quite tame actually.

The head was comprised of larger bubbles that didn't last and didn't lace. My finance looked at it and commented that it looked ""like coke or Pepsi"" which is enough to knock this score pretty low. A $5.00 porter from a brewery as acclaimed as Stone shouldn't look like Pepsi!  S: Bold chocolate, cocoa, burnt coffee and deeply roasted malts (imparting a bit of sweetness). No smoke smell present in this ""smoked porter"".  T: Follows the nose with bold vibrant coffee, chocolate and roasted near-burnt malt tastes. Well balanced with light hopping and enough bitterness to keep the sweetness in check. The smoke just barely shows up at the end with some nearly metallic flavors.  M: Nicely full bodied and somewhat smooth, but could be smoother. Very good mouthfeel, but the best of this style still reign supreme.  D: Nicely drinkable, very good.

There is a touch of sweeter roasted dark character that emerges in the finish. This is mostly a dry porter, but it does have a bit of complexity in that the roasted and slightly charred and smoked qualities include a touch of sweeter dark malt.

147,90,Daniellobo,4,"A nice, if a bit too thin, porter, with a subtle smoky finish.  Presentation: 22 Oz bottle. Iconic winged demon logo resting on top of the Stone brew name. Perfunctory Stone long and over the top narrative on the back. However on this occasion there is an actual description of the brew and what it tries to accomplish among the gibberish. Does not show beer freshness or bottling date date, and lacks any other info other than Alc. by Vol (5.9%). Poured into a tulip glass.  A - Black pour with minimal deep brown edges. Frothy head that retains its presence fairly well, and fades to a surface ring with some memory and good lacing.  S - Smell is a bit shy. There is a coffee roasted malt range to it, a tad chocolaty even, with the faintest of smokey notes in a distant background.  T - Taste follows nicely the nose, roasted malt, subtle coffee flavor with a shy smokey note. As the beer warms a bit the smoke notes are slightly more apparent but not much.  M - Light body, still feels smooth but with such little carbonation and a that thin body it feels rather watery at times.  D - It is a good drink, but a bit light for a porter. Easy to drink but with a potential to become boring and not very memorable as one goes through it.  Notes: Not sure this is a great highlight for a brew that tries to have a smoked character. On the other hand its subtlety may be its better asset, if one can notice it and enjoy it fully this might be a great brew. For me I feel they erred on that side.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Smoked Porter,89
147,90,Lldeegan,3.9,"This porter pours a dark brown with ruby edges. A small khaki head accumulated after a vigorous pour.  Roasted malt, esters and smoke all mingle in the beers aroma. Notes of smoked wood, roasted peanut, and coffee are all given off and create a rich and welcoming smell.  It is pretty light and understated for a smoked beer. The roasted malt comes through most. Touches of dark chocolate and coffee, with a hint of smoke that is not as deep as the aroma. The finish is bitter with some faint hop presence on the back.  Medium mouthfeel, nice and creamy and a bit slick. The subtle smoke plays well with the roastiness of the porter. It's very bold, and very good.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Smoked Porter,89
147,90,LordAdmNelson,4,"Definitely a change of pace after my Monk's Cafe... pours an almost opaque black with thick off-white head that fades more rapidly than I was expecting. Nice lacing, however. Normal porter notes on the nose of chocolate, dark malt, and a hint of hops. Definitely getting some smoke in there too. Taste is pretty good, chocolate malt, dark malt, some near coffee flavors, some piney hops (slight), and a bit of smoke. The smoke here is actually more pronounced in the nose than the flavor. Slightly creamy body, though it falls flat at the front of the palate. It could use (I can't believe I'm saying this) a bit more carbonation. Or more body. Pretty easy drinker here, although I feel as though it is due to the moderation in smoke flavors. A good introduction for me to smoked beers, but next time I might just go for a smoke bomb. I guess I can't fault this beer too much because it is definitely a porter, and a good one at that. I need to remember that it is Stone Smoked Porter and not Stone Rauchbier.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Smoked Porter,89
147,90,rtratzlaff,3.47,"Stone's Smoked Porter pours a filtered clear black body with ruby highlights and an off white head that leaves good lacing.  The aroma is smoked and charred malt, chocolate, and not really any hop presence.  The flavor is roasty and slightly sweet, some acidic character from the roast, smokey. Hop presence is minimal to light for a Stone brew, but that isn't a completely bad thing.  Mouthfeel is substantial but certainly not full. Carbonation seems just fine on the moderate side.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Smoked Porter,89
147,90,Kelp,3.7,"A nice darker brown color to the brew. Has a small head to it that goes away at a decent pace.  It smells of roasted coffee, chocolate, and bonfire.  It has a pleasant malt taste to it. Coffee and chocolate up front, with a finish of a nice outdoor wood fire. Yes it taste just like a fire pit smells.  A nice smoothness to the beer and a pleasant amount of carbonation to it.  One bottle would be enough for me for the week, maybe month. I like the taste but just couldn't have it to often.

147,90,Bierzengot,4.08,"Virgin review. Have to start somewhere right?  Appearance: Dark, robust brown. Reminiscent of good French press coffee. Healthy-looking, attractive head. Light brown in color. Clings to the sides of my snifter.  Nose: Unfortunately I have little to no sense of smell. Blessing while walking downtown, curse while sampling good beer and food. However, I can definitely detect a pleasant smoky smell and hints of coffee and chocolate.  Taste: Very nice. Medium bodied and smooth malty transit from lips to palate and throat. Slightly hoppy midway through. Served a little on the warm side, but I don't think it detracted from the taste. High carbonation is apparent in the action of the head. Fluid, pretty solid mouthfeel initially, but the veneer fades a bit further into the bottle. Solid, but not as thick as I expected. Choc. and coffee dominate without overpowering. Bittery aftertaste after a sneaky, smoky finish.  Overall a good drinkable beer. I didn't pair with any food, but it would definitely complement a hearty slab of steak. It's a distinctive smoked porter without being too dominating in any single aspect. A friendly rewarding brew.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Smoked Porter,89

Nose- Roasty dark chocolate and coffee. Smoke is evident, but not at the level I was expecting from a stone brew.  Palate- Both the smoke and hops are present, but slight. The showcase here is the malt. Coffee and chocolate with a touch of roastiness. The smoke becomes more pronounced as the beer warms, but it remains smooth.

147,90,MOB210SA,4.23,"Pours thick hardly moving sandy tan head, almost coca-cola looking as its being poured out the bottle. Much darker once poured. Black coal in appearence but definitley not impenetrable. Not difficult to see a lot of ruby red/scarlett around the edges with lighting. Stayed around for a while but eventually settled to thin head made mostly of large bubbles. Pretty thick, gloppy lacing.  Mmm, Nose is very nice. The smokey flavor really comes through. Not in a overwhelming way, its subtle. Some roasted malt and dark chocolate and small amount of sweet caramel. With some warming the sweetness does come though too.  The ""smoked"" is a for sure thing here. The flavor mostly consists of a great woody smoked flavor, followed by the roasted maltiness, and chocolatey finish. This beer has a distinct start, middle and finish, but flows seamlessly.  Medium/full bodied, filling mouthfeel that is slightly sticky but goes down smooth and nice lingering flavors.

Left beautiful sip rings. Smoke is surprisingly absent in the nose. I was expecting a smoky, roasted scent, but in its place was just some cocoa tones with a sweet finish.  Very creamy body on this beer. Carbonation level was low. Smooth. No smoke in the flavor either. What makes this smoked? This tastes like a regular porter to me. Some light coffee bitterness, mild chocolate flavors, and roasted malts on the finish.

Head is full and foamy with a nice tan color. Hasn't went down since I started the review so it looks like this ones hanging around.  S: Has a sweet smell like unfermented wort. Smells like wet, smokey grains. Sweetness comes through with aromas of chocolate, vanilla and even some cinnamon(may be the smoke). Not a whole lot going on here. No hop presence to balance the roastiness.  T: Smokey and roasty, fairly sweet yet bitter in the end. Chocolate and smoke prevail. Thought I was going to be disappointed after the aroma, but this beer succeeds in the smoked category. Flavor is very complex with the smoke and sweet malts playing off each other. A small bit of hops come through on the palate giving it some floral qualities towards the end. Very well balanced beer.  M: Although thin, I wasn't expecting a chewy beer. Rushes down the tongue and collects in the back of the mouth distributing smoke and sweetness around. Thin but luxurious.  D: Very drinkable porter, I'm almost halfway done a pint while doing this review. Could see this pairing very well with chocolate desserts or even a nice cigar (don't smoke them, but just going on flavor juxtaposition here).

Overall the balance and subtle confluence of flavor is quite good. The flavors are not exceptional, but they are responsibly allocated and delivered with restraint.

Rocky and creamy for several minutes before it becomes just a cap, leaving moderately sheety lacing.  It almost smells like there's smoke in here, but not really. Some light caramel and roast. There might be smoke, but it might just be me because I chose to drink this on a night when I burned leaves.  Wet malt, wet leaves, weak caramel malt, honey. A twinge of herbal, biting hop. Floral and fennel. A minuscule peat note dares you to find it when the beer warms to around fifty or fifty-five.  Thin, very nearly watery. A bit prickly.

147,90,Reaper16,3.47,"22oz. bomber served into a Trappistes Rochefort chalice  Pours a Pepsi Cola brown that is substantially lighter around the edges. Not much size to the off-white foam. Lacing is spotty at best. Pretty average looking porter.  This doesn't smell like a porter, not really. Lots of sweet, caramel scents. Not too much roastiness at all. The smoke is very light compared to other smoked porters I've had. There is a very nice nutty quality -- like pecans -- that helps the score for aroma.  The most noticeable thing about this beer? The amount of smoke is very, very light! I'm used to getting pints of O'Fallon Smoked Porter, which is so smoky that it is practically barbecued beer. Stone's offering in the category is subtle. The smoky quality sticks out only on the finish. Before that ashy finish is a pretty standard porter. Roasted coffee flavors meet some light raisin.  Decent mouthfeel. Its kind of light, but I'm not convinced that a more substantial body would improve anything. Drinkability is pretty ok. It is held back by the super-drying nature of the beer. This one has to be paired with food that has some moistness to it, be it meat or cake.  You can say that I was disappointed by this smoked porter. The smoke is not a focal point and the porter backbone is not impressive.

147,90,everetends,3.92,"22 ounce bomber I picked up from Hop City in ATL last week. Can't believe I have taken this long to work my way to this Stone offering. I love porters but I just never made it to this one. Served up in a standard pint glass.  A: Pours a seemingly dark black in color off the pour. Closer inspection proved that this is an incredibly dark brown instead. Very dark with dark ruby hues. Can't see through it and can't make out a visibly carbonation activity. The head is a little lighter in color than I expected. It is about a finger of light tan head off the pour. Retention is so so, falling slowly to a thin ring that puts up minimal lace. Its not bad looking, but its not exceptional either.  S: You know, its simple but nice. Has a very heavy malt presence. A little bit chocolately and little bit caramel. Getting more of a heavy roast aroma off the malt than a smoked aroma in the flavor. Its just slightly woody and hard to decipher the smoked quality. Touch of hoppiness to it, maybe pine. Touch of coffee as well.  T: Nice as well. Almost mirrors the nose. Bit more chocolatey here. Has a nice roast to the malt and grain for sure. Touch of caramel comes through on the finish as far as malt goes. The hops aren't coming through as much as they were in the nose. Smoke quality is a bit more prevalent, very light and well hidden but present. Just a bit of bitter, dark coffee coming out as well. Damned tasty.  M: Has a bit of weight to it but I would still put it on the heavy side of medium. Carbonation comes across a bit too high for my liking in a porter. Just has a bit too much bubbly quality to it on the throat. Slight bitter but mostly nice and smooth. Aftertaste is all malty goodness.  D: I am very happy with this beer to honest. Sure I can see it being improved but its a good drink. Goes down easy, isn't overpowering or anything crazy. Simple yet still has some complexity to it. I look forward to each sip to see what is there, and that is what I want in a beer. Stone rarely disappoints me, so this is no suprise.

A little bittersweet chocolate.  M: Body is kinda' heavy, but not thick and cloying. Really fills the palette. A slightly bitter finish.  D: Good sipping beer.  Good atmosphere. Deep dark formidable appearance. Nose is pretty basic, but the smokiness gives it really unique character.

147,90,taxguyjase,3.99,"Pouring like crude oil (something it shares with the Russian Imperial Stout), the Porter lacked much head and what it did have was kinda spotty as it defoamed. The brew smelled like roasted coffee that was tossed into a enclosure of pure smoke. The roasted malt is blended well enough with the chocolate, coffee and smokey taste to avoid it being too overpowering in any one area. I've seen some reviews of this beer that thought the smoke was a bit much, but I disagree. Good mouth coverage, with a sharp first taste (something I think is pretty common with Stone brews), then it ends with a sour bitterness in the aftertaste. Would have this beer again, but it does not stand out as so unique that this would be my ideal smoked porter.

A: Black body shows a deep, clear ruby hue when held up to light; a dense tan head is only half an inch tall, but sticks around admirably and leaves a nigh-solid coating of lace. i'll forgive the small head since it was on tap (and I appreciate getting more actual beer), and declare this a great-looking beer.  S: Nothing but smoke at first; maybe some sweet maltiness on the tail end.  T: Far less smoky than the nose: more roasted malt (coffee) and dark fruity maltiness. Sticky sweet finish. The smoke is understated, and mainly appears at the outset. Quite complex and pretty tasty.  M: Sticky and medium-bodied with moderate carbonation.  D: It's fun that there's so much going on, but the sweetness keeps me from wanting to keep throwing this one back.

In addition, it seems to pick up something similar to a dark red wine in flavor.

A big porter aroma that is doused in smokiness features chocolate, coffee, and a touch of hops and caramel.  First up is a nice dark chocolate flavor with some smoke behind it. After the chocolate starts to fade the smoke expresses itself more fully, followed by the slight bite of citrus flavored hops. Next comes a slightly bitter coffee flavor that strengthens right until the finish, where just a touch of caramel flavor appears.  The body is full and slick with moderate to low carbonation, which overall works very well.  Overall Stone Smoked Porter is a very good porter.

Espresso, a touch of cigar smoke, and bitter cocoa beans. I don't get much in the way of spice, but that doesn't mean much.  Yum. Strong, dark coffee, espresso beans, a touch of ""dirt"", cigar smoke, and bitter chocolate. There's a hint of dark berry somewhere in there, and plenty of the malliard reaction in the flavor.  Well balanced in the mouth, not silky, but smoother and slightly denser than the average beer. Low carbonation, but it cooperates nicely with the flavors for the almost heavy mouthfeel.  Nice clean beer, strongly recommended. Great pairing with Ham and Sauce Poivrade. Would be good with any grilled/smoked dark meats and heavy sauces. If it wasn't so expensive, it would make a very tasty sauce for those roasted dark meats.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Smoked Porter,89
147,90,beeragent,4.43,"Poured into a pint glass from a 22oz bottle.  A - Poured a dark brown forming a 1 inch tan head. Medium spots of lace on the glass.  S - Roasted malts dominate the nose with a hint of smoke coming through. Very inviting!  T - Roasted malts and the smoked malts dominate the palate. Not overly smokey but with enough of a smoke presence to back uo the name of this beer. No noticeable hop profile and alcohol presence.  M - Medium bodies with a good amount of carbonation. Very smooth and clean finish.  D - I love smoke beers and porters, so the blending of the two is like heaven to me. The taste is well blended and just amazing!! The alcohol content is low enough to allow for a few of these to be had in one night (which I have done). Overall, this is easily one of my favorite beers available from Stone. Great job Stone!!!!",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Smoked Porter,89
147,90,jaxon53,4.15,"One of my favorite Porters at the moment. Served this one chilled, in a snifter, from a twenty two ounce brown bottle. Actually let this warm a bit before sampling.  Appearance: Almost jet black, a few beams of faint light pass through the dark liquid. A semi-hard pour yielded about two fingers of almost tan, soapy head. Head faded quickly into a thin ring of foam around the glass. Some creamy lace was left behind on the glass.  Smell: Nice mellow nose. Roasted and smoked malts are out front, but do not overpower. Touches of black coffee. Faint aromas of milk chocolate with hints of toffee.  Taste: Nice flavor as well. Again, smokey malt flavor that doesn't overpower. Has a subtle roastiness behind the smoke. Slight notes of coffee, toffee, and chocolate. Just a bit of bitter hops in the smooth creamy finish. Nice balanced flavor.  Mouthfeel: Creamy, medium bodied mouthfeel. Smooth and somewhat slick. Carbonation is a bit on the lower side but fits this beer perfectly.  Drinkability: This one drinks very nicely thanks to the 5.9 percent ABV and well balanced flavors.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Smoked Porter,89
147,90,longdivision,3.72,"Poured from a bomber. Appearance was almost black but some light comes through on the edges, with a creamy beige head that lasts for a good while.  Smelled a little sweet with some piney hops.  The taste had couple things going on. sweetness, roasted coffee and malts up front with some pronounced bitter hops at the end. the hops and coffee linger afterward.  Medium mouth-peel with a tongue coating quality.  Recommended.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Smoked Porter,89
147,90,jlindros,4.02,"Had this back in September on tap at Allora in Marlborough, MA, but forgot to log it here. Just noticed it in my notes.  A: Almost pitch black with 2 finger rusty-brown head, served in a flute glass.  N: Nose of roasted malts, slight chocolate, toffee, and some smoked malt.  T: Creamy and roasty with chocolate milk taste. Semi smokey but not overpowering. Semi sweet and a little syrupy, also adds some earthy roasted flavors.  M: Semi thick with decent carbonation and a little syrupy and creamy.  F: Pretty bitter on the finish, which also adds some dark fruits, and slight stouty bitter flavors.

147,90,m1ked,4.28,"Growler from WF Bowery beer room. I let Neil know about the SD local favorite ""Smokey Indian"" a mixture of Stone's Smoked Porter & IPA...mmmm.  A- Pours with a monster sandy tan colored head that has large bubbles on the top, with fine bubbles on the bottom. The head hangs around for a long time. Once it does shrink down, it leaves behind a ton of lacing. Pours a dark cola colored brown. When held up to the light, boasts some flaming ruby edges. Looks so good.  S- Rich woody, cocoa, cola, touch of smoke, root beer, mollasses from a fruitcake. Even though the smoke is undeniable, it is not overpowering, and lingers.  T- Definetly get the smoke up front, burnt woodiness, light cocoa, light salty meat...which I am sure is the smokiness tricking my palate. Some bitterness at the end. The flavors in the middle are kind of lost between the bookends of smoke (duh) and lingering bitter.  M- Really light mouthfeel, but as I must remind myself that this is a porter, not a stout. Good carbonation throughout.  D- This is a great porter. I wonder how many casual beer drinkers have been scred off by the ""smoked"" oart of the label. Having lived in SD, I think I took this beer for granted. I was so happy to see this for growler fills here in NYC. Good to pair with food too!",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Smoked Porter,89
147,90,Avagadro,3.27,"A: Nearly opaque, with hints of molasses towards the top of the glass. This brew pours with a vigorous head that is quite persistent.  S: Dark chocolate, sourdough bread, and piney hops are present, but faint in this brew's faint bouquet.  T: Deliciously roasted barley combines with American grown hops to deliver an enjoyable experience. The roast and hops don't conflict as they typically do when paired together. I'm disappointed in the total absence of smoke.  M: The first thing you notice about this brew is its heavy carbonation. The thick mouthfeel and roasty aftertaste are quickly scrubbed from your palette by the bubbles.  D: This brew was delicious, but let me down on a couple of key points: there was little bouquet, no smoke, and way too much carbonation. A good beer, but not one of Stone's best works.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Smoked Porter,89

The feel is full bodied but not overly heavy with a nice sweet finish. This is a very drinkable beer.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Smoked Porter,89
147,90,capra12,3.5,Reviewed solo.  Appearance: deep and dark brown with little head  Smell: roasted coffee and powdered dark chocolate.  Taste: opens with a mild coffee bitter as a smoky and coffee bitter/ sour comes in as a mild malt profile finishes the sip leaving a mildly smoky coffee bitter.  Moutfeel: light bodied and rather dry. Medium carbonation.  Drinkability: I would have this again and recommend this to someone who enjoys a smoky porter that have a rich coffee bitter/ sour in the middle to end.,Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Smoked Porter,89
147,90,nuttyviking,4.35,"This Porter is well done, beautiful dark brown to black, head has a smokey vanilla look. Aroma is exceptional with a smokey coffee offering. The taste comes on strong with the roasted grains and malts, you think that the flavor is going to be overwhelming, but instead is fades into a wanting for more, very clean finish. Overall a very good Smoked Porter, just what you come to expect from Stone",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Smoked Porter,89
147,90,TheJollyHop,4.15,"Had this beer on draft at the Stone Brewery during the IRS vertical tasting. Pours black with multiple streams of bubbles;quarter inch of head.  Strong coffee aroma with a subtle fragrance of caramel (barley/malt?).  At first sip, a torrent of smokiness and bitterness attacks the palate. Dark chocolate is on deck, only to give way to some barley flavor. Just when you think that there are no more prominent flavors, the hoppy kick subsides and is replaced by a sweet malt aftertaste.  The body really shines in this beer. It looks deceivingly thin, however it turned out to be quite thick, bready and mouth-coating. This beer is definitely a great representation of a porter, and it is one that can be sipped on all afternoon.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Smoked Porter,89

Bbq and a smoked porter? my kind of night.  Beautiful pour, brown black dirty bodied with a thick and rocky tan head which is a gateway to all its brilliant smell. not very translucid, rather viscous aspect.  Smell is predominantly sweet and smoky, much like i fancy my barbecues. roast malts with a very slight hoppy tone and a light alcohol sting perceivable at the nose.  Taste is very nice, absolutely full bodied and full flavoured, malty taste. i very much enjoyed the participation sweeter tastes get in this beer as opposed to the bitter hoppy dominance many american beers tend to allow. subtle alcoholic blend throughout, with an even dark chocolate mouthfeel at times.  A great beer, sessionable and hearty.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Smoked Porter,89
147,90,jrallen34,3.29,"I drank this from the bottle into a chalice.  I had such high hopes for this beer. I love porter and I love smokey beers so how could this go wrong? Sadly, I was wrong.  The beer pours black with light tan head that is big, 3 fingers high with good retention and lacing.  The aroma is really light and doesn't bring forth nice smokiest that you would expect. The smoke is there just really light with a tad of chocolate.  The taste is really super light as well, you can barely get any smoke at all and just a light coffee taste.  Mouthfeel is solid nothing great, and this is just a bland beer that is not very drinkable.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Smoked Porter,89

Aroma is pleasantly smoky, malty, roasted and sweet.  Taste is much of the same; roasted, toasty, mildly smoky, with some pleasant chocolate and sweetness and hop finish.  Creamy, medium in body, slick and smooth. Carbonation is minimal.  Great drinkability, and another tasty Stone stand-by.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Smoked Porter,89

Aroma: Lots of roasted malts, with hints of chocolate, smoked oak chips, mild coffee, and strange metallic red winey aroma.  Taste: The taste is powerfully smokey right from the start, like eating a campfire. After fanning away the smoke there is a predominantly malty body, with woody coffee flavours, and a subtle burnt sugar. There are traces of raisin, and possibly blackcurrant.  Mouthfeel: Dense and smooth, a nice porter feel.  Drinkability: The intense smokiness may take away a bit from the drinkability but it is still a great porter, and smoke is nice in small doses, and anyway, it is a smoked porter.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Smoked Porter,89

This is pretty constant for Stone Brewing stuff for me. The brewer does good quality but, with the exception of a couple of brews is a better marketing job than beer.  If you look up smoked porter in the dictionary this brew would be the picture next to it. It is OK and has the standard characteristics for the style but does not stand out.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Smoked Porter,89

147,90,r0nyn,3.62,"Poured from a 22 oz bomber into a pint glass. Courtesy of fellow BA infi.  Pours a dark caramel color that lets light filter through easily. A vigorous pour produces a decent sized head that recedes rather quickly and doesn't leave too much lacing. Swirling it around, the liquid lapped at the sides of the glass a little too eagerly, giving the impression of a lighter, thinner brew. Smell has a lot going for it, with some chocolate undertones as well as some malty character that has an odd tinge to it.  Blast of initial hoppy bitterness that gives way to a roasted malty backbone that coats the tongue. There's another taste in the middle that I haven't experienced before, I'm guessing that's the smoky quality of the porter. Backend has some chocolate nuances along with a return of the bitterness. Interesting, to say the least. Mouthfeel is pretty light, not lager quality, but definitely not as weighty as some of the hefeweizens I've sampled. Carbonation wasn't really present at all. Backs up my initial suspicions of thinness from the look.  This brew didn't do anything to overwhelm me and make me want to revisit it. Light feel and odd flavor hinders the drinkability somewhat. I mean, won't turn down another free go at it, but I can definitely find better beers to imbibe before I try this one again.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Smoked Porter,89
147,90,infi,3.77,"Poured into a nonic pint.  Pours a translucent and thin cola color that forms a one-fingered tan head with spotted amounts of lacing. Smell is full of toasted malt and some hints of chocolate notes. There's a funky sort of smell that underlies the rest of the aroma, but I'm guessing it's the smokiness that's indicated by the name. The taste is very full of the smoked quality along with the subtle hints of chocolate and coffee. The smokiness is very appealing and pretty. The aftertaste has a very beautiful coffee roast flavor, which I like.  The mouthfeel is the one thing that I think is the one unfavorable quality to this porter. It's like drinking flat soda - no palpable carbonation whatsoever. I was hoping to have some sort of carbonated feel to the porter, so I was a bit disappointed. Incredibly light-bodied and thin. Drinkability is still moderate and good as there is no sacrifice in taste.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Smoked Porter,89

T - Toasted malts, coffee, and the smokiness all partying together. Smokey flavor is very nice. Adds to the brew without overpowering it.  M - Light, low carbonation. Pretty smooth.

Lacing was superb and webby on the glass wall.  S: Smells sweet, rich and malty, with a hint of smoke, cocoa, hazelnut and herbal hoppiness.  T: Nice smooth malt profile here. A rich blend of coffee, dark chocolate and milky sweet roasted malts. The smokiness is subtle and warming, making sure it's not a rauchbier. Slight grassy hop bitterness lingers with smoky coffee sweetness.  M: Mouthfeel is full-bodied and velvety smooth.  D: A really nice sipper to have around the campfire. Very big porter flavor, so it's a must try for the porter fan or smoked ale enthusiast.

S- Deep, rich cocoa and coffee malt sweetness. Very intense. Very inviting.  T- Follows the nose. A heavy, full flavor profile. Feels like a ton of bricks... in a good way. A bit of smoked malt comes through, but roasted coffee and dark, bitter baking chocolate come through a lot heavier. Not really a smoked porter, more of a porter with a hint of smoke. Still, tastes very good. You know, as I finish it, the smoke becomes more pronounced. Not anything intense, but very well blended and super tasty.  M- Heavy, creamy, impossibly intense for the ABV.

This is the smokiest porter I have had to date, I drank it once before , but this one is the smokiest that I remember in aroma of having smelled a porter.  Thick bacon aroma, maybe hickory smoke? and of course malt... Taste hits me with a bacon smoked taste off the bat, some bitterness and very light hop flavor. Aftertaste is overwhelmingly black patent malt. Slightly too much for my desire, but a nice porter. I need to give credit where the smoke comes into play. Is this a smoke additive? slight bitter twang at the end as well.

Had a ruby red hue when held to light, and left lightly broken/spotty lacing. Smelled of tart fruity apple/grape/raisin combo, almost metallic, following is a big dominant malt aroma, big smokey/roasted notes. Semi sweet aroma with lots of roasted nuttiness, and a hint of butter.  Taste/Mouthfeel - Tasted of big roasted/smokey malts, not really sweet at all, following is some very subtle dark chocolate notes, and nutty flavors. Rich smokey/roasted flavors linger pretty well, and as it warms, more burnt like flavors with mild biscuit are pronounced which only made it richer! Mouthfeel had some apparent crispness as it hit the tongue, then very creamy & smooth, which complimented the flavors very well! Around medium-full bodied.  Drinkability/Final thoughts - I really enjoyed this beer, from the fresh from the tap appearance, to the way the creamy mouthfeel complimented the rich smokey flavors.

It pours a very very deep, dark and rich brown color that edges on opaque. When back lit the edges illustrate a very rich mahogany color while the middle of the glass is pretty much opaque. The head is nice too, off white leaving decent lacing on the way down. This one looks promising.  The smell is big and complex. Roasted malt, earthy hops and dark fruits are all pronounced in the bouquet. Hints of caramel and smokiness are secondary, but still detectable.  The taste is just as rich and complex as the smell suggests. My first impression was that the mouth feel was very rich for a porter, which I happen to like. Up front there is a nice roasted malt character with a definite flavor of dark fruits. Next came the more bitter coffee and smokey flavors. The roasted malt takes a turn toward coffee toward the end and into the aftertaste while the smokey characters linger throughout.

After a few minutes the head retention died off, leaving a fine lacing. The smell is of robust roasty malts and feint chocolate; somewhat stout-like I'd say.

Deep brown to solid black with a thick creamy head. First smell doesn't do the rest of the beer justice. Malty with hints of coffee, but doesn't prepare you for the taste to come. Smoke is rather faint compared to what I remember.  Much more flavor than the aroma lets you in on. Roasted malts are right up front before the smoke comes along. Not quite the woody campfire smoke you find in a rauchbeer, this is more earthy, suggesting some peat malt.  Smooth and creamy medium bodied mouthfeel.

Carbonation cascades to form a one-finger tan head which dissipated slowly leaving an attractive lace.  Smell: lots of chocolate with a nice roastiness and a light trace of hops.  Taste: a very complex, dynamic flavor. Up front is a little chocolate with an astringent bitterness; this gives way to the lightest of smokiness and is finally finished with a sweet malt flavor and a nicely bitter aftertaste. Each sip is interesting.  Mouthfeel: body is on the heavy side of medium and carbonation, though light, lends a nice creaminess.  Drinkability: highly drinkable to an extent, but it is just not quite smooth enough to be a long session beer. Still quite delicious.  I like that this is a smoked beer that uses the smoke as a subtle addition to the final flavor, rather than the number one characteristic.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Smoked Porter,89
147,90,burnerfinger,4.15,"A: poured from the bomber into my tumbler. big fat 2.5 finger head, light tan colored, hops flavor in the foam. deep dark caramel color. head settled to a minimum film and left nice lacing....  S: Nice but really cant put a name to this - more to the bitter side than sweet. I do pick up a note of the alcohol in the smell.  T: what I get here is bittersweet. chocoloate but not sweet at all, the bitter does come thru but I cant' really ID it as hops. Liking this a whole lot.  M: maybe a bit undercarbonated. nice thick mouthfeel. Alcohol does NOT come thru here.  D: approacing perfect. Relativly LOW ABV would allow for repeat servings For Sure. thanks again to Stone Brewery.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Smoked Porter,89
147,90,hardy008,4.03,"Pours a dark brown color with a 3 finger tan head with good retention. Smells of chocolate and coffee malt, mild smoke, and some bitter hops. The hops take a back seat to the malt as it always should be with a porter or stout. The sweetness and bitterness of this beer balance each other out beautifully. This is a rich and full bodied porter which is nicely carbonated and easy to drink. I would gladly pick up this beer again. I just wish the smoke was a little stonger.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Smoked Porter,89

The aroma has some chocolate, coffee, and a touch of smoke with a light hint of citrus hops in the back. The flavor is much like the aroma. Chocolate and roast flavors upfront with a hint of smoke and a lingering hop bitterness. Nicely done. The body is medium and the drinkability is good.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Smoked Porter,89
147,90,JamesS,4.5,"Poured a very nice deep brown/black color with some very nice head and good lacing. Excellent scent, deep and dark with nice coffee undertones and a great smoked aroma. Excellent flavor as well, with the smokiness really coming through but not overpowering the deep malt and coffee porter flavors. Went down very well, and although I don't know if I could have many of these at one setting because of the intense flavors, it was a wonderful brew.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Smoked Porter,89

T: First sip is sweet, primarily caramel. As it warms up a bit, the slight smokiness comes out, as do the traditional porter flavors such as coffee and chocolate. A nice roasted malt taste is prevalent.  M: Medium bodied with moderate carbonation and a smooth mouthfeel.  D: I'm generally not that big of a fan of smoked beers, but this one is light enough on the smoke, and it seems to add a bit of sweetness.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Smoked Porter,89

As I don't have any of those ingredients, I will just drink it anyway. :P  A - Dark brown and ruby colored body and a small off white head that breaks down fast, leaving only a ring behind.  S - Slight smoke and dark chocolate with some roasted coffee notes. Some floral hops picked up in the back.  T - Smoke and light charcoal blended with coffee and burnt chocolate. Again in the back you get a floral hop character with a licorice finish. Dark fruit is noticed as it begins to warm.  M - Big body and chewy. This brew is a mouthful and not for the faint of heart.  D - Moderate to high. The relatively low ABV and malty backbone keep you coming back for more.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Smoked Porter,89
147,90,Vengeance526,3.86,"Pours a dark brown to black color with red highlights, producing a generous brown head that retains nicely and leaves a lot of lacing.  Aroma is a little masked but some hints of roasted malt and a very faint hint of smoke can be detected.  Taste reveals notes of caramel, roasted nuts, and light touches of chocolate. There is a slight smokiness upfront but not nearly as prevalent as you may expect.  Smooth mouthfeel but lacking in body just a little. Overall this was good to try but the ""smoked"" part wasn't pulled off quite as well as I was hoping. My feelings are a little mixed on this one. As far as porters go, this is really good, but if I was picking out of Stone's lineup, this would not be one of my first choices.

147,90,njmoons,4.27,"Let me start by saying I am not a big fan of Porters, but I am a fan of Stone Brewing Co. So I picked up the a bomber of Smoked Porter just to try it out.  And as usual Stone did not disappoint.  The beer poured a murky dark brown, with a smokey coffee aroma with just a hint of sweet malt.  Taste started with a sweet malt and a hint of heavy fruit, and was quickly taken over by the smoke and roasted malts. The finish was very clean and dry with the strong taste of roasted malts and hop bitterness.  Mouthfeel was good, and for a porter very drinkable.  For me one of the few porters I have truly enjoyed",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Smoked Porter,89

Smell: Malty, heavy with grains and bread, chocolate. Very highly aromatic, an amazing scent. Gotta give it full points.  Taste: Amazingly well-executed porter. Strong notes of coffee and chocolate, with a rich velvety dry finish. And yes, you can taste the smoke. Somewhat sweet on the aftertaste, hints of dried fruits.  Mouthfeel: Moderate. Again, velvety, low carbonation, mild hops. Coats the palate well.  Drinkability: Another amazing winner from Stone.

S - Dark roasted walt with charcoal-like smokiness in the back of the nose. Not overly aromatic overall.  T&M - Light flavors of the toasted malts and the smokiness mixed together. I think the smoke is the main focul point. It's a nice smokey flavor, not overpowering and not like a rauchbier. The smoke is of oak chips on a charcoal grill and quite faint and ghost-like. Very low carbonation and just a bit watery. Would have like some more robust flavors from the hops and malts.  D - A very nice sipper but lacks the flavor that I really wanted. Alcohol and bitterness not a detractor from drinkability by any means. Quite sessionable really.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Smoked Porter,89
147,90,vdread,3.86,"Stone Smoked Porter is a deep opaque in the center with some dark red around the edges. a thick golden tan head leaves pretty solid lacing. initially i smell roasted wood, peat moss, and baker's chocolate.  taste is dominated by roasted malt, smoky wood/peat, and black coffee. a little chocolate, roasted coffee in the aftertaste. slightly hoppy at the end. just slightly.  somewhat creamy mouthfeel, yet a bit lighter than i would expect, especially from Stone.  good taste and low enough ABV to enjoy a few. i pick up a bomber every few months, but i prefer my porters to have a bit more character other than just 'smoky'. it's definitely a good porter, but not the best.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Smoked Porter,89

More malty than anything to me.  T: Great taste! Coffee and cola flavors mix in with a nice aftertaste. This is a nice one to hold in your mouth and even after you swallow the taste stays with you. Excellent.  M: A bit bitter feel in the mouth. The same feel eating good chocolate leaves you.  D: Great price and decent ABV on these will make this one a winter favorite of mine.

Smell is an enticing blend of dark chocolate, coffee, and a light roasty/smokey note that is increased in the taste. Also in the taste is a bitter coffee note at the finish that makes things interesting. Mouthfeel is on the full-bodied side, with the dry, bitter finish that's just a little strong for my taste.

There was a two finger tan head head with little retention. The aroma was notes of smoke and a weak coffee aroma. Taste hit hard with strong smoke, but the other flavors lagged behind somewhat. The coffee and chocolate notes were weak and made the smoke too heavy. Unbalanced. Mouthfeel was full and chewy. Drinkability was good due to the ABV and the lighter than expected flavor.

147,90,OldSchoolGamer,3.68,"It seems that almost every Stone beer I have had recently has not been as good as the first time I had them. It could be my changing taste buds or their decline in quality. I can't judge for myself as I am relatively new to the craft beer scene. On that note, here is my review of Stone's Smoked Porter:  A: Pours nice and dark. Not pitch black as light does penetrate the beer slightly. Head is a light tan color and sticks around nicely.  S/T: I get smoked malts upfront with a slight coffee aroma. Lot more smoke in the taste than I remember. There is also a licorice taste in there. The coffee and chocolate notes are there, but very subdued. Tastes a tad watery. Not my favorite porter and somewhat disappointing.  M/D: Medium bodied and slightly creamy. A little heavy to drink on a hot summer day, but a decent sipping beer. Drinking a bomber should be relatively easy due to the lower ABV.  As I stated before, Stone beers are not as good as when I first tried them. Arrogant Bastard, Russian Imperial Stout, IPA, Ruination, and now Smoked Porter just seem a little lacking as of late. Thats pretty sad considering they are the reason I got into craft beer in the first place. Worth a shot, but is not on par with many other craft brewers out there.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Smoked Porter,89

Sorry to say I have to disagree. the appearance and smell of this beer is great. the taste is what left me disappointed. the coffee and hops hit your taste buds with a blast of joy, then it's all downhill. I'm not getting any sweet tones. The smoke comes through, then disaster. You're left with the taste of charcoal. Like you just licked the bottom of a grill. The mouthfeel of this one was also not to my liking. very light and carbonated. not what i expect from a porter.

Smell is largely of roasted sweet malts and hints of coffee. Decent, modest, and enjoyable.  Solid flavor! A fantastic flood of malts heavy in chocolate and coffee but not overwhelming. Finish starts sweet but ends in a bitterness that reminds me of a dark powdered cocoa and that cool smokey element seems to be underlying throughout. This might be my new favorite porter!  Mouthfeel is heavy but not overdone. Carbonation is light but lasting and helps to give a creaminess to the whole thing. Drinks incredibly smooth which lets this one go down very easy. Nice!  One additional note: reading the back of the bottle gives insight into some food pairings that go well with this brew - including PB&J sandwiches. I had to try it, and I must say that it was a very good match! If you like beer and food, check this one out! Very cool.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Smoked Porter,89

Wonderful nose of chocolate and caramel, with a mild and sweet smokiness. Great smoked malt flavour pervades throughout, with luscious chocolate and coffee notes underneath. The smoke is well handled, and while not as strong as a rauch, far better suited to the flavour than a more full-on attempt. Full, creamy body, which really elevates this beer to the next level, and helps to give substance to the smoke, rather than a weak wateriness.

147,90,BeanBone,4.2,"Appearance: A dark brown, very nearly black, body with only a handful of red highlights. Up top, a generous, tannish and creamy head that sticks around a good amount of time and leaves great lacing.  Aroma: Lot of smoke over chocolate and roasted malt. Simple, yet effective.  Taste: Much the same profile in the mouth: peaty smoke over a chocolaty, roasty, and somewhat bitter malt backbone. A subtle hop presence contributes to the bitterness, giving this beer great balance. I could definitely handle more smokiness, but what's here is great. The aftertaste is smokey and roasty.  Mouthfeel: Medium bodied with smooth carbonation and a dryish finish.  Drinkability: About what you'd expect from a nearly six percent Porter. No problems whatsoever polishing off the 22 oz. bomber.  Verdict: Without the smoke component this would still be a solid Porter, but with it in the mix this is a most satisfying brew.

Smoky malt, a little chocolate and vanilla in the background, a bit of hops.  T: This one runs the gambit. Smoky, coffee, chocolate, vanilla, hops... This is incredible.

147,90,tyanow,3.9,"Blue Palms here in LA always has great stuff on cask. I have had this many times in the bottle and a couple of time on tap but in the cask it is outstanding.  The smokiness comes through in the nose, the mouth and the throat.  Thick bold layers of chocolate and burnt almonds grace the palate.  In a bottle it can be too carbonated and lively on the tongue to enjoy all of the flavors but from the cask it is fantastic.

I could feel very little carbonation from the glass, all wasted in foamy head, and had to drink straight from the bottle to get a feel for how much carbonation was present. It tasted better after the carbonation loss, not a great flavor, earthy. I could not find any chocolate, anywhere. I generally like Stone products, but this is a very pedestrian effort. To be honest, I can't believe this is the same beer that the majority of other reviewers rated! Maybe I just got a hold of a bad bottle, but usually that is indicated by too little carb, not too much.

S - Aroma is quite subtle, surprisingly. While very light on the smoke, the nose is quite chocolatey with just a hint of earth and smokey char in the back.  T - Smoked malt but with a prominent chocolate presence that adds a bit of sweetness and a hint of bitterness. While smoke is the primary flavor, it is not dominating. Nicely balanced flavor overall, with chocolate and licorice notes to balance the smokey character.  M - Medium to full-bodied with a pretty substantial thick, chewy mouthfeel. Carbonation is spot-on and bolsters the bitterness, which lasts well into the finish.  D - It took me a while to finally try this beer, but wow! This is a great beer all around.

Could you some more lacing but the head stays around long enough to remain appetizing to the eyes.  S: Mmm, a bit different than I remembered it in Hawaii, still smokey but a bit more subdued and not just as much of a hoppy kick that it had straight off the tap. Instead I am greeted by a great mix of mildly fruity, but intensely roasted sweet caramel and light brown sugar.  T/MF: Opens with a slightly acrid smokey flavor, moves quickly into a casually bitter fruitiness, closes with a slightly sweet licorice character. Feel is smooth but not silky, has enough carbonation to feel uneven and gives an interesting texture the the beer that keeps me going back for more.  D: This is a 1, 2, 3, beer, a beginning middle and end. It gives and gives without demanding too much attention.

S: Overwhelming bouquet of malt sweetness. I've said this before but the aroma reminds me of my days as a baker when I would first open a tub of malt.  T: Very malty sweet with a real apparent smoke/coal taste that I haven't decided on yet. There is a nice hop accent in this porter which I was not expecting. The robustness created by the smoke is very ""as advertised"", but I don't know if it is necessarily for me. I've seldom had a smoked beer actually taste smoked, so I guess this one is spot on for its style.  M/D: Very smooth and very very big. I may have to acquire a taste for this style, but I'm sure that won't take long.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Smoked Porter,89
147,90,BeerBastard308,4.36,"A - Nice dark mahogany color, very thick, can't see through it. Excellent character and all that I expected coming from Stone in a Porter.  S - Smells amazing. Maybe it's just me, but I can really smell the hints of licorice and the chocolate especially. Then dark fruits and a slight hint of caramel  T- Just like it smells. Underlying bitterness with a slightly dry aftertaste. Smoke is an element but not an overwhelming factor. I wish there was just a little bit more but still a very satisfying amount that blends well.  M - Carbonation biting towards the end with a slightly dry mouthfeel after it goes down.  D - Excellent drinkability. I like it around 50*.  Food Pairings - Great by itself. Better with food. Enjoy with a hearty meal. I like it with Burgers or with a really hearty beef stew.  Overall I think it would be a little bit better with a slightly smokier taste, but that's just me. Other that, it's a very robust brew that should be treated like a fine wine. Save for occasions that call for it. Yet another exceptional brew from Stone.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Smoked Porter,89
147,90,Goldopelgt,3.95,"Ahh...an old favorite (yet the first time I've come around to review it...)  A- Dark, cola color with a creamy, off-white head...some decent lacing...  S- Smoke (of course), but not overwhelming...maltiness...and coffee...hint of hops (which seems to come with any stone variety)...slight amount of dark fruit, but not much...  T- Again, smokey, but with more of the coffee coming through on the front end...malts...slightly sweet...everything you would expect from a good porter...  M- A little thin, dry, I always hope for more from this brew, but still not bad...  D- A very good intro for anyone getting into smoked beers, or porters for that matter. Drinkable, and worth a second look...or a third...or a fourth...",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Smoked Porter,89
147,90,nomomentwasted,3.93,"An old stand-by for me to introduce non-beer drinkers to a flavorful, intense brew that tastes little like ""beer"" that people tend to conjure up when they are unfamiliar with or do not like what they've had. I think it's due to the low hoppy flavor compared to IPAs or even Pales, but intense flavors nonetheless.  Had this for the review out of a bomber into a pint glass.  Appearance: Dark brown-black with a whitish head that laces and waves beautifully. Love love love how Porters look and this is a fine example.  Smell: Smoky and malty. ALmost reminds me of the smell of s'mores, as the chocolate-y smoke and barley are reminiscent of such. Low hops can be detected, drowned by the smoky malts.  Taste: Big, big, big. Immediately hit with spicy alcohol that drinks heavy for its relatively low ABV and charred malt taste. It goes excellently with chocolates and barbecue, really hits those notes well in the brew.  Mouthfeel: Creamy yet crisp, in a very porter-ish kind of way. That may be a semantic thing to say as I consider this one of my touchstones for the Porter style (along with Black Butte Porter from Deschutes). Really rounds out across the palate, but the smokiness leaves an aftertaste with the alcohol spices that really coat the mouth from sip to sip.  Drinkability: This, although only 5.9% ABV, drinks really slow for me and it always has. A bomber is just heavy and filling and mroe than enough for a barbecue dinner, almost too filling. Tasty and fun, it's a great beer that won't sneak up on you and really is a nice example of a Porter.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Smoked Porter,89
147,90,Bricelyn,4.55,Pored from a twenty four oz. bottle this beer Gave an amaizing amount of head holy shit three fingers of head that came up over the top of my mug ( I need a bigger mug because I can't fit a 24 with this much head in it!!!) about a finger!!! SO MUCH HEAD!!! Gotta love good head!  Smell coming off of this beer was malty chared goodness.  Taste was a wonderful mix of smoke and cocoa.  Feel Very smooth I may have poured this one a little hard but it went down excellently with my Sheppard's pie!  I wouldn't session this beer it is to special to cheapen I think it needs to be a special occasions beer. EXCELLENT BREW!!!,Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Smoked Porter,89
147,90,bsp77,4.38,"Serving glass: Poured from bomber into Nonic Imperial Pint.  Appearance: An exceedingly dark brownish-red that remains slightly transparent. Massive foamy head with major lacing.  Smell: Smoke, caramel and roasted malts, cherry.  Taste: Definitely can taste the smoke, almost a charbroiled taste. Slightly sweet chocolate malts and fruit are balanced by roasted malts and hop bitterness. Different facets of the taste shine more than others dependent on the temperature.  Feel: Low to moderate carbonation, medium body, quite smooth and dry on the finish.  Drinkability: Very flavorful porter that insists you keep drinking, although the flavor overload may eventually wear thin. One of the best porters I have had.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Smoked Porter,89
147,90,GarrisWH,4.28,"A - Very dark reddish amber color, which you can just barely see through when you hold it up to a light. Frothy, light tan head retains well. Leaves ample lacing down the glass.  S - Roasted, sweet malts with hints of mostly chocolate and a bit of coffee dominate the aroma on this one. Very light hoppiness in the background, along with slight smoke. The smokiness in the aroma seems more subdued than I expected.  T - Roasted malts up front with chocolate and coffee tones and some rich caramel sweetness. The malts are balanced with a mellow, but crisp hop character in the background, which adds a nice, slight bitterness. Slight smokiness in the finish that lingers in the aftertaste. Again, a bit more subdued than I expected on the smoke flavor, but not overdone, so I can't complain.  M - Full, creamy, and rich. Nice level of carbonation and goes down nice and smooth.  D - I really enjoyed this beer. I was sort of expecting an overly smoky beer, but I really think they got smokiness at a good level here. Great balance and combination of flavors and a smooth, highly drinkable beer. I could definitely enjoy a few of these without getting tired of it.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Smoked Porter,89
147,90,Rayek,4,"A: Deep mahogany color is a couple of shades away from black. Rocky cream cap retains well and leaves patches of lace.  S: Slightly smoky, but not over the top. An espresso aromas is what truly dominates. There's a bit of charcoal in the back. The smoke lends a restrained rauchbier quality of smoked meats. There's a hint of dark fruits in the mix too. It's a nice overall effect.  T: The espresso aromas from the nose find their way seamlessly into the flavor. Bitterness comes in the form of charred wood. The smoked malts add a nice extra layer of complexity, without trying to blow away the other flavors that are work. The overall effect is that of balance, rather than an amplification of a given taste. Finishes with a mild lingering burnt bitterness.  M: The medium body has just about the right level of carbonation.  D: I really liked this beer. The flavors balance well and it definitely went down easy. Overall, this is a very fine beer.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Smoked Porter,89
147,90,bgjohnston,3.98,"I like porters, but had never had a ""smoked"" porter before.  This is a good, solid porter, and the smokiness I found to be a nice way to balance some of the typical sweetness you get with a nice, malty porter. The smoke and the hop finish each sip of the beer much more dry than one might expect for a porter, as well.  I will admit, I was concerned about the ""smoked"" aspect, but still wanted to try it. I am glad I did, but would likely spend my money on Arrogant Bastard again before this one.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Smoked Porter,89

Tastes of roasted coffee malt with a nice subtle smoke flavor. Finishes very roasty and smoky, quite dry. Nice full mouthfeel, but not overbearing with the smokiness.  A great porter, very roasty with a nice smoke backbone. The smokiness luckily is not too overwealming, balances nicely with the roasted characteristics.

147,90,Foxtrot,4.23,"I haven't had a quality Porter in a long time. I have always seen Stone Smoked Porter at my beer scene, but haven't had the inclination to try. Here goes nothin'.  Pour produced a extremely dark brown body with ruby accents around the glass when exposed to light. Head was big, ivory colored with good retention and ample lacing.  Aroma is sweet with roasted malts, with just a touch of smoke. I thought there would have been more pronounced smokiness, but felt a little down.  Taste was a bang, to say the least. The roasted malt and chocolate sweetness up front, followed closely behind with smokiness that is just right. I'm not a big fan of smoky beers, but the level that is found in this beer is just perfect.  Mouthfeel was great. For being a low ABV. beer, it had a big mouthfeel making it feel like a big beer. Stone really nailed the mouthfeel on this baby.  Great drinkability. Low ABV. and great taste and mouthfeel make this a very enjoyable session beer.

A full creamy oatmeal colored head forms during the pour and receeds to about 1/4"". The head is very creamy looking, almost stoutish as I stare into the glass. Decent lacing, but not overly impressive.  Smells very malty, dark and sweet...almost molasses like. Slightly smokey aroma like charred wood but similar to toast as well. There is a crisp smell that I attributed to the hops off in the background.  Definitely bitter and drying...smokey with some nutty flavors. Not overly complex but pleasing to the palate.  This beer was smooth and crisp with just the perfect amount of carbonation. I would say it is on the lighter side of medium bodied and finishes slightly dry.  Very smooth and enjoyable, however this is not a beer that I would drink as a sessional. The smokiness can tend to become overbearing in large quantities.

147,90,charlzm,4.03,"Consumed 06/12/09 at 50 degrees F.  Beer pours clear, deep brown with garnet highlights. Lots of active carbonation visible when held to strong light. A frothy two finger tan head forms then fades down with average speed.  Aroma is off, with metallic and sweatsock notes kind of ruining the vibe. Really nasty. However, about half a pint into this bomber, the smell went away and was replaced with subtle, sweet malt, very light smoke and chocolate overtones.  Luckily, taste is not a reflection of that nasty nose: flavor is sharp and fairly clean. Some cocoa malts up front, some smoky charcoal in the middle and a rich semi-sweet chocolate on the finish. Any hops are there primarily for bittering. A furtive mineral water flavor lurks at the edge of perception.  Mouthfeel is a study in contrasts: a real bite on the tongue is balanced by a smooth creaminess. A touch of alcohol heat present, which is odd considering the ABV is relatively low.  Weird smell aside, this is a thick, drinkable brew that goes well with hearty foods.

Smell is heavily roasted malts and just a hint of smoke. This has to be one of the more approachable smoked porters there are out there. Taste is more of the roasted malts, some cocoa and what comes across as roasted coffee. There's a good amount of smoke flavor in this as well. Very balanced and good.

The cheerless-white colored head is sticky and whipped nicely with reasonable retention. A rather nice display of lacing  S: upon first whiff, husky roasted malts and a healthy dose of chocolate smells. Nothing really points at being a ""Smoked Porter,"" things seems average. I do gather a very light earthy/cedar character if you take a few deep snorts  T: about in this order: dark roasted grains, a few shavings of mellow chocolate, and a glob of vanilla caramel crusted coffee beans (the coffee is a nice addition to the mix). Now, amongst all of this a slight charred oak smoked vibe can be pulled out from the mix, rather light I might add. The coffee seems to help accentuate the smoky flavors a bit. Also, a low hop balance is in the mix  M: body is medium and crisply drinkable. Close to being creamy and a nice fit for the flavors present  D: Now that I think about it, I would not care for a beer to be absurdly smoked.

Smokiness is very tame on this one, as chocolate and vanilla play nicely with the salty-smoke undertones. Has some woody, earthy notes as well.  What a contradictorily mellow, rich and decadent beer! Peppered beef jerky, cocoa and caramel sweetness with a more-than-adequate hop load. This is actually a pretty surprising beer from Stone, there appears to be a leash on this gargoyle as all the flavors are pretty subtle for the most part.

All i get from it is a sort of yeasty, black-malt sweetness. Kind of coffeelike in essence. Not a lot of smell to it. Taste is very good, however. Deep in excellent porterness, dark sweet malt balanced very nicely by a healthy dose of hops at the end. The sweet-pushed hops are what slightly linger on the palate. I'm not getting a great deal of smokiness, but there seems to be a bit. It's basically a slightly smoked porter, a very nice touch. The smoke lingers a bit on the palate too, now that I taste it. Light-heavy in body, sufficiently coating and lingering. Drinkability is pleasant if not amazing.

Aroma of light smokiness, chocolate, and a bit of piney hops (what would a Stone brew be without a trace of hops?).  So smooth and yet very flavorful. Tons of roasty malt and bitter chocolate. Not very sweet; rather, refined. Hops are not too discernible in the flavor. Oddly, the smokiness is not as pronounced as I thought it would be. Much more subtle than say in a Rauchbier from Schlenkerla. Mouthfeel is creamy and lighter than expected. Carbonation is medium at first but dies down beautifully.

147,90,adamette,4.15,"Live Review. Poured from a bomber purchased shortly after I had asked for help in understanding why ratings for SN Celebration are so high and someone here on BA suggested that I drink one of these instead of worrying about all of the rude responses that I got to that question. Anyway, purchased at World Wines and Liquor last October or so. Poured into my clean, clear Cooperstown Beverage Trail pint glass. Served at about 50 degrees. Bottle had been in my ~60 degree cellar since last October.  A Medium to light brown generous head that sticks around for a few minutes. Body is dark brown with maroon highlights when placed in front of direct light.  S Well, smoked with moderate to dark malt. Exactly what I expected but pleasing in that regard. Inviting and a good smell.  T Nice smoked porter with smokiness leading the taste spectrum over a base of the medium to dark roasted malt. I taste raisins or dates and maybe some licorice as well as a subtle chocolate taste. This is like a collection of ""dark"" tastes in that all of the tastes are of items that tend to be dark in appearance. Nice touch.  M Not as smooth as some porters that I have had but also not as heavy, this porter is unique in the successful inclusion of the smoked aspect.  D Good for a porter and the low ABV means that I will finish this bomber without great difficulty.  Notes: The first of 5 Stone beers that I will taste and rate.

Creamy mouthfeel, coffee-like bitterness up front. Finishes with a thick, dark malty flavor with a lot of chocolate. As it warms you can smell some overripe plums (I guess? it's some kind of sweet fruit). It does kind of remind me of black licorice (I doubt I would have gotten that if I hadn't read the back of the bottle but whatever). I should have let the bomber sit out of the fridge for 20 minutes or so to warm up, since as I drink it its getting way better.

The actual beer was a dark shade of ruby brown, with some scattered Belgian-style lacing. Nice ...  After a few swirls, I get plums, chocolate, and coffee. The smoked part is there, just subtle.  Taste is classic porter. A bit of sweetness which ends in a dry dark chocolate aftertaste with coffee-like bitterness. The hops are almost non-existant here. The smoke taste again is subtle enough, but its 'there' and is quite a shock for a ""smoked"" beer newbie, but is pleasant enough after a few swigs.  Decent carbonation here, its actually very easy to drink due to the creaminess, but on the other hand, there is no way I would drink more than a pint glass without getting my palate dulled due to the roasty/smokiness.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Smoked Porter,89
147,90,BacklitAvenger,4.51,"Appearance - Black in the glass. Capped by whitish-tan head, leaving lacing down the glass as I drink. Held to the light it is straight ruby. A dark drink here boys and girls.  Smell - Dark malt, and a hint of smoke. A bit disappointed here, was expecting more smoke. Perhaps I may be jaded from Aecht Sch., but I thought it a bit lacking in smoke aroma.  Taste - Well! Made up for the lack of aroma here! There's dark malt flavors composed of dark bittersweet chocolate. Intertwined with the dark malt is a thick, powerful smoke flavor. Caramel and roast round out the malt bill, and hops are limited to bittering role, perhaps a bit overpowered by the smoke. Can't say I mind though, this is a truly delicious drink! The chocolatey and smokey characteristics blend masterfully, dueling for control of the beer. This is a proper porter as well, much restrained in the roast sort of taste, barely posessing it at all. I like my stouts roasty and my porters malty and bittersweet, and this fully fits the bill, living up to my buddy's exhortations. He picked me up a bomber at DLD this year since we can't get them here in Illinois. Overall the flavor is explosive, yet restrained. There's a warming quality about it that manages to expose alcohol without being hot or solvent-like. Additionally I feel the smoke taste to dissipate fast once poured into the glass, so I used my smaller tulip and refilled more often.  Mouthfeel - Velvet. Pure and simple this is a silky smooth and slightly viscous and thick porter. Not slick and viscous, but more soft and fluffy. I almost feel like there's some sort of mouthfeel related smoke properties here, not sure. Carbonation adequate, ideal even. There's just enough CO2 to prickle the mouth as you drink, adding to the voluptuous, voluminous mouthfeel overall.  Drinkability - I damn dear well gave this a five here as well, but compared to lighter fare it isn't truly that drinkable. It is merely extremely drinkable for such a beer with a medium-heavy body and chock full of flavor. I noticed myself gulping the stuff down and had to check myself as I only have the one bomber, and as such should savor and sip. Still, this stuff makes you want to take big, full drinks.

T - Roasted malt with a lingering smoke flavor. Bitter, but hops are mellow and most of the (fruit?) hop undertones are buried under the smoke. (Not necessarily a bad thing.)  M - Creamy without feeling flat--carbonation is nice.  D - Drinkable for a porter.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Smoked Porter,89
147,90,kemoarps,4.08,"pours a pretty little cola-esque deep brown with a creamy tan head that looks like I could lay my head on it and sleep. Decent lacing and retention. Looks tasty.  the nose is creamy, with a sweet tang of bitter cocoa (i realize that sounds contradictory, bear with me). just a hint of twirling smoke reaching its tendrils up to grasp my senses  taste is creamy smoothe. The smoke reappears here, as does the bittersweet cocoa. The cocoa almost makes it feel kind of dry, not in the sense that wine will be dry (lack of sugar), but the way that bakers chocolate kind of feels like it is dessicating the mouth. But not in a bad way, if that makes sense.  one of the smoother and more comfortable porters I've had recently, pleasantly surprising in that regard. kind of chewy. round. feels good (that's what she said)  Could drink several of these in a row if that's what I had. very tasty. not as overwhelming as some other simiilar brews. only 5.9, so even that isn't going to put you too far too quickly.  overall, another masterfully crafted brew from the folks at Stone. Also managed to get it sort of for free (my friend, to pay back the money he owed me took me to liquorama and told me he'd cover whatever I could carry in my arms, no baskets allowed. I was proud of how much I could carry. three six packs, a pack of four cans, four 22s and a couple of singles later...). All around a pleasant drinking experience. recommend highly",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Smoked Porter,89

147,90,barleywinefiend,4.35,"Poured a very deep brown with a small dirty tan head, very little carbonation. Nose smelled of a little smoke and roasted malt, coffee but let down on the nose much like the taste. Tasted like it smelled. I almost detected smoke smoked meat or something in there. The bottle did not do this brew justice.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Smoked Porter,89
147,90,swizzlenuts,3.95,"A: Black with a white fluffy head. S: Smells like a porter (so it has the slight chocolate and a black malt character) with a slight bit of smokiness. T: Smokey with a good burnt black malt flavour. Full flavoured but only a slight smokey flavour. I'd like the smoked flavour to be more pronounced, after the first few drinks I could barely taste it. M: A bit thin for a porter, but it has the traditional medium creaminess. D: Quite!",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Smoked Porter,89
147,90,GoodBeerTire,4,"A - Poured black with a slight tan head. Laces well.  S - Caramel malts. Smoke is not overpowering.  T - Starts malty, with caramel. Chocolate & slight licorice. Smoke shows up in the aftertaste. A bit raw.  M - Good carbonation. Not as creamy as other porters, but the small, almost non-existant head has something to do with it.  D - Lower alchohol% (5.7) makes it repeatable, but since it has a quite strong smokey aftertaste, I will want to finish it up w/ something hoppy. Would pair well w/ fruit.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Smoked Porter,89
147,90,merryjoulton,4.25,"Pours an opaque black with basically no head, just some foam resting at the top that doesn't span the surface. Smells of dark malts and balances out with some piny hop aroma. Tastes just like it smells-deep malt balanced with piny hops. The mouthfeel is good, just the right amount of body to match the deep smell and taste. Much more drinkable than an IRS because of the SP's lighter body.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Smoked Porter,89
147,90,DannyS,4.15,"One of the far less arrogant offerings from Stone Brewing. Served in a pint glass, poured from a 22 oz. bomber.  A - Pitch black that remains black with a faint glare of light when held up to it. Thin but resilient head, good retention and lacing.  S - Coffee, charcoal, smoke, and toasted oat. Basic, but it works.  T - Very mild on the bitterness. Lots of good coffee and smoke flavor. Subtle hops and good malt, just ever so slightly sweet.  M - carbonation is medium to low, body is full. Very well balanced feel.  D - Highly sessionable. The bitterness is far form overwhelming and the ABV isn't ridiculous. Finishing the bomber was an easy task.  Overall - A great, well balanced porter. Easy drinking and very socially inclined. Crack a few open and enjoy a round with friends!",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Smoked Porter,89
147,90,Lerxst,3.71,"Poured from 22oz bomber into Stone Smoked Porter glass.  A-Very nice pitch black with a nice two finger head that lingered around for quite a while.  S-The smoke is a bit much. I know this is a smoked porter, but the smoke smell is hard to get past to get to the chocolate/coffee undertones.  T-Again, the smoke. its a bit much and the coffee/chocolate undertones are showing up which is nice.  M-A nice full bodied brew with perfect carbonation.  D-I would enjoy this more if I could get past the smoke. But still, for a big beer it is surprisingly drinkable, but one bomber is enough.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Smoked Porter,89

147,90,thekevlarkid,4.35,"Out of a bomber bottle this beer was a very dark brown/black color with a two finger head of tan foam. The retention was quite good and the lacing pretty good too. The aroma was not nearly as 'dark' as I was expecting, roasted malt, earthiness, peat smoke, rye bread and wood. The flavors were rich and robust, bittersweet chocolate, coffee, peat smoke, sweet pipe tobacco, earthy malt and a good balancing hop bitterness. The long bitter finish was pleasant and well organized as one experiences with high-quality chocolate. The mouthfeel was smooth, the body full and the carbonation perfect. An excellent example of the style and another worthy offering from Stone.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Smoked Porter,89
147,90,LauraAlberts,4.37,"I had this at a Stone beer dinner tonight at the Old Village Post House in Mt. Pleasant, SC. Stone Southeast rep. Scott Sheridan was there and brought some great humor/tasting profiles/stories and facts along with him that made the dinner an unforgettable craft beer experience. The chef paired this with a Charcuterie Plate stuffed full of Country Pate, Chicken Liver Mousse, House made Sausage, Pepper Relish, Whole Grain Mustard, & Toast Points. Needless to say the Porter paired perfectly. I highly recommend attending a Stone beer event in your area when it come available. The reps know how to have a good time and entertain the entry level beer drinker as well as the beer geek!  Appearance: Dark brown with tan head and slight lacing.  Smell: Smoke, Chocolate, Coffee  Taste: Chocolate, Coffee Malt with dark Chocolate malt finish.  Mouthfeel: Full Bodied with soft tannins, dry finish.  Drinkability: Sip & Savor.

Stone takes this one and runs with it.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Smoked Porter,89
147,90,briman,3.68,"Pours very dark brown, clear, with ruby highlights around the edges. Moderate tan head retains well.  Aroma has some light roast, dark chocolate, and hints of coffee and smoke.  Flavor has very light notes of roast, chocolate, and coffee, with a light-to-moderate smoky element. Finish is dry, with just a hint of bitterness into the aftertaste.  Medium body, moderate carbonation. Seems somewhat subdued compared to other Stone Brews. Overall, the flavors are a bit soft, and not at all what I was expecting. Certainly not a bad beer, but I find this to be only slightly above average for a porter.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Smoked Porter,89
147,90,showell,4.33,"I've wanted to try this one for a long time, and finally got a couple of bottles.  It pours a VERY dark brown, almost black with a light tan head, about 4 fingers. There is just a touch of a smoke smell to it, but nothing else. The taste starts a very smokey flavor, that eventually adds malt, and coffee. It finishes with just a hint of smokey flavor. The smoke and malt are the main flavor sensations, but what a nice mixture! There's just a touch of fruit there too if you really pay attention.  I could drink these all night, except that the alcohol would sneak up on you. You'd never know it was coming, because you can hardly taste it.  Very nice!!!",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Smoked Porter,89

Smell of toasted malts and a bit of smoke, but not smokey like a rauchbier. Taste is smoke and malts with a long lingering aftertaste not unlike an Islay Scotch. Carbonation is right and mouthfeel is smooth. This is a great brew but a sipper not a chugger!",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Smoked Porter,89
147,90,Reiksguard,4.11,"Poured out of a bomber bottle into a pint glass. Deep, dark, almost opaque in color with a tan head. Only a hint of burnt smoke in the nose with some notes of coffee. The taste was great - just a little bit of smokey background, with a coffee or dark fruit flavor. The best part of this wonderful brew is the fact that it finishes so clean. Almost no residual bitterness (you would never know it was 50+ IBU).",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Smoked Porter,89
147,90,jpaltan,4.25,"Midnight black with thin caramel head. Leaves very little lace in glass. Smell has a slight hint of smokiness, but not overwhelming. Some chocolate in the nose too with some fruitiness. taste is all malt with very little hop bite that doesn't come into to play until the finish. Smokiness is there. Subtle and tasty, charcoal note bounce around. Mouthfeel has a nice creaminess and is quite full.

147,90,FLBeerGuy,4.52,"Pours a midnight black with a thin tan head from my 22 oz bomber. I've also had it on tap and I think the tap version has a stronger smoke flavor.  Smell is smokey, coffee and faint chocolate  Taste is smokey, coffee and some chocolate. A little hop bitterness on the back end.  Nice mouth feel, what you would expect from a porter  Good drink ability, would be a good session beer with the low ABV,except the smokiness detracts from the ability to drink too many of these.  This is a great smoked porter, one of the best examples of the style.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Smoked Porter,89
147,90,TheSarge,4.43,"Stone's Smoked Porter pours for a prime example as to what a porter should look like. Lots of chocolaty tan head that sticks around for quite a while. The body is black, but reddish hues are evident when held up to the light.  Aromas are of coffee mostly with a hint of arid and slightly floral hops aroma.  The taste thrashes the palate with rich coffee character. There is an undertone of smooth dark chocolate as well.  This feels slightly slick with a bit of oiliness from the hops. It's also a little coarse with the bitterness.  Overall a great interpretation of the style, and I would rate this slightly above Guinness Extra Stout.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Smoked Porter,89
147,90,Brewsmith,4.23,"From a 22 oz bottle purchased locally poured into a 0.5 L glass. Aroma is roasty chocolate with some peat coming through.

Evenly balanced with hop bitterness making it smooth and easy drinking.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Smoked Porter,89
147,90,jnn4v,4,"This is a good beer, no doubts about it. From the first pour to the last drop in your glass, it's a solid showing. I enjoy it bottled or on draft. Tonight's just happened to be on draft.  A: Dark brown, almost black in color. Tan head. Barely translucent when held to the light. No sediment.  S: Slightly smoky, almost oaked character. Chocolate malts. I could smell this beer and salivate for 10 minutes without even sipping.  T: Very well balanced. Somewhat sweet, somewhat bitter, somewhat savory. The smoke matches up nicely with the chocolate and coffee malt flavors, all of which is balanced with a clean and bitter hop flavor.  M: Nice thick texture with moderate carbonation. If it weren't for the level of carbonation, it'd feel syrupy and almost stoutish.  D: Nicely balanced flavor and texture combined with an almost session-like ABV give it a high drinkability. However, the richness of flavor and thickness makes it almost meal-like, so I'm not sure you'd want too many of them. Very good overall.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Smoked Porter,89
147,90,dakid618,4.3,Poured from 22oz bottle received in trade from kiefdog(thanks kevin!) Poured into pint glass. Pours deep brown almost black with a finger of tan head with good retention and great lacing on the glass. Smell is like roasted malts with no hint of the smokiness I was expecting. Taste is smoky as soon as it hits your tongue but mellows out to a smooth maltiness. Light-medium mouthfeel. Very drinkable. The best porter I've ever had. My favorite beer from Stone yet.,Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Smoked Porter,89
147,90,GRPunk,4.02,"22 oz. bottle poured into an imperial pint glass.  A- It was initially a bit of a gusher. The body was a very deep, dark brown that was nearing black. The head was a fluffy, tan that left loads of sticky spots on the side of the glass.  S- It had a really nice malty aroma off the bat. It was full of roasted, smoked goodness. There were hints of coffee and chocolate behind the pronounced smoked aroma.  T- It's a great combination of traditional porter traits with a heavy dose of smoke. The smoked flavors were abundant, yet not overpowering. I still picked up a good deal of dark chocolate and coffee flavors. The slightest of citrus hops struggle to make itself known through the robust malt and smoke profiles.  M- Pretty basic. A light bite from medium carbonation, hop, and alcohol.  D- It's a decent drinker. As the smoked flavors become more robust with some warmth, it gets a little more difficult imagining drinking more than a bomber at a time.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Smoked Porter,89
147,90,Kromes,3.88,"Pours black with reddish colors on the edges with a brown head. Good lacing down the glass. Chocolate, roasted malt scents. Roasted malt chocolate coffee flavors with a faint smoke flavor. I was dissapointed that there wasn't more of a smoke flavor to this beer. There was slight bitterness in the finish with apparent hop flavor. I had this with some texas sliced brisket and the taste immediately changed. The beer became way too hoppy. Apparently the extreme smokiness of the BBQ neutralized any roasted smoke flavor in the beer and made the hops pop out. Very strange.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Smoked Porter,89
147,90,theBubba,4.1,"Ah, the power of suggestion. In this case labeling. And it seems to work, judging by some of the reviews posted here. This is a very good brew, but it is not smokey in the sense of smoke as in barbecues...smoked fish...etc. Nor is it a German Rausch beer. In fact if it weren't for the label, you might think this to be a good RIS or Chocolate Stout.  Its forward malt flavor (and teensy bit of smoke) with good chocolate notes and nicely subtle bitter hop bite at the end of the swallow makes for an enjoyable drinking experience, though the lingering sweetness doesn't help drinkability. One is enough.  All in all a decent craft brew, worth a taste. Not disappointing.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Smoked Porter,89
147,90,grayburn,4.3,"She pours a dark black with a nice head on her shoulders that doesn't drop away too quickly. The smell is nice, a light smoke aroma lingers around every malty bend, with a bit of hoppiness here and there as well. The way that the smoked malt mingles with the sweet and hoppiness of this brew is quite impressive. This is the least-lupuled beer from stone I have had as of yet, very nice. The mouthfeel is nice, just creamy enough to go well with some bbq or spicy food. The drinkability is very high, especially for the smokiness...this is a great beer to get one started on the whole smoked beer train, nice and subtle.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Smoked Porter,89

147,90,kflorence,3.9,"A: Poured a dark almost (if not) opaque black in color with a very thin layer of white head on top that quickly dissipated. Looks like a beer with some density.  S: Smells very smokey; roasted, almost charcoal grill aromas in there. Burnt malts, no doubt, are definitely present in the nose. Slight hoppiness and some caramel present as well... maybe subtle hints of dark chocolate.  T: Much like the smell, this beer is very smokey! This is, of course, a good thing (being as it is a smoked porter). I personally like the smokey/burnt flavor and thought it quite nice, but others I was with thought it was a bit overpowering. The beer does have some bite to it on the backend, but overall I felt it was pretty balanced.  M: This beer is pretty rich and has on the heavy side of a medium bodied beer. The substance provided definitely lends itself well to being a bit thicker on the tongue; not quite chewy but definitely far from watery.  D: While it is drinkable, I couldn't imagine having more than a pint or two of this without feeling full. It's rich and heavy, but it's also fairly smooth and definitely yummy. Try it out if you like burnt/smokey flavors or caramelized malts.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Smoked Porter,89

147,90,HopTroll,4.18,22 oz. bottle  Appearance- Pours dark brown/black with very thin cream colored foam.  Smell- Chocolate malt comes through well with smoke background.  Taste- Heavy to medium malt flavor with good chocolate notes and just enough smoke that is not overpowering. Nice subtle bitter hop bite at the end of the swallow.  Mouthfeel- The malt richness creates a smooth and creamy that is not too thick.  Drinkability- Good beer with the right amount of smoky flavor that isn't overwhelming.,Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Smoked Porter,89
147,90,GWaters,3.8,"Pour: Poured completely black even when held up to the light. Heavy mocha head poured tight and foamy then receded slowly. Some light sticky lines of lacing around the glass to reminisce.  Smell: Strong roasted malts, dark chocolate notes with faint ground coffee beans. Very faint smoke notes, almost disappointing. Burnt brown sugar sweetness, leathery, toasted nuts, faint liquorice, some pepperiness.  Taste: Nice roasted malt bitterness, Strong chocolate chaser, barely any smoke, some creamy traces, woody, light treacle notes, some oatiness, light sweet nutty notes.  Mouthfeel: Very smooth and creamy with medium body. Satisfies the front of the tongue and top of the palate the most.  Overall - A pretty good porter although not as full bodied as I was expecting - I would have preferred a bit more of a smoke flavor as well.

147,90,asabreed,3.5,"Bomber into a Brooklyn snifter.  Appearance: A near-opaque blackness with bursts of deep red at the bottom of the glass toward the light. Initial head is huge and billowing, but nothing much after that sticks at all and there's little lacing left around the glass, even with subsequent pours.  Smell: More like an oak-aged porter with its woody aromas and mild vanilla, along with subdued and mild roasted malts. Balanced, and seemingly quality stuff, but I expect more from Stone, and this aroma seems to be mimicking so many darker beers I've had lately, which is a bit disappointing.  Taste: Some woodiness, roasted malts, mild coffee. Finishes slightly sour, though a nice subdued roasted malt flavor seems to be there for a while, even though it lacks depth. Smoke? I'm not sure what I'm missing here.  Mouthfeel: Medium-bodied, though it lacks creaminess and carbonation and pulls toward a bit of slickness and oiliness.  Drinkability: For all the hype about this beer at least I've been hearing, I'm not unimpressed, just not very impressed. There seem to be many comparable porters across the board, and many better ones. I'm not sure if I can't tell the smoke from anything else, but I was hoping for some predominance, which was something I didn't get. A decent one out of a snifter, but nothing I'll be seeking out again.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Smoked Porter,89

147,90,joshuadlight,3.26,"Had this on tap at Cricket's in Lubbock. The beer just didn't impress me. Stone always seems to be pushing the boundaries of taste and overall beer experience, but this thing seems pretty tame. It looked fine, dark with a small tan head. The smell was sweeter than I expected and I even had trouble finding any smoke in the nose. The same goes for the taste. Biscuity malts, no smoke, no carbonation, no balance. Not a special mouthfeel. Drinkable enough. If you like it.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Smoked Porter,89

S- First off the bat is some nice smoky campfire, a meatiness, and underlying chocolate and cream and a nice hoppy edge.  T- Starts off with a nice smokey campfire and meaty note with an underlying citrus hop note and some roasted grains, chocolate, and cream. The finish has bits of smoke, some creamy chocolate, and even some essence of marshmellow.  M- Low carbonation works well and the smokiness is very balanced but clearly evident. To date, the best smoked porter or stout to deliver the smoke factor.  D- A downright solid brew. This has the most Rauchbier characteristics that I've seen yet in the porter category. Definitely check this one out as it's very delicious and drinkable.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Smoked Porter,89

By the way, this bottle has been hidden in my stash since at least this time last year. Heavier than medium in body, mild carbonation and good drinkability. Pay no attention to the best by date.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Smoked Porter,89
147,90,danielcc,4.67,"Full disclosure: this beer is on my top-10 list. Found it in a bomber, and poured into a Pilsner-style glass (not a pint glass...sue me).  Appearance: dark brown, kinda ruby around the edges. When I hold it up to the light, I can peek through it without a problem. Since I've got a smaller glass, I poured it two ways: first, an easy pour down the side of the glass yielded a nice 2-finger head that faded down to a thin layer that left a pretty good lacing. A full-on pour yielded more head (3-finger this time), but not as much of a difference as I expected (although it has gotten to sit out and/or warm a bit since that first pour). Regardless, this beer looks good.  Smell: definitely can find the smokiness here, joined by coffee and caramel. I really like the smell on this one.  Taste: I did mention that this is number 3 on my personal top-10 list, right? Definitely a porter: lots of chocolate malts, some caramel in there as well. I'm not noticing much in the way of hops, which is OK with me (much more partial to straight-up maltiness). The smoked part comes in after to hit you, and the aftertaste fairly reeks (in a good way) of smoked malts. I really do love this beer.  Mouthfeel: not too heavy nor too light. Perfect for a porter on this one; I just don't like giving out 5's if I can help it!  Drinkability: good thing this beer's got a low ABV, as I could see myself drinking a lot of it for a very long time. It says it goes well with barbecued meats (and it without a doubt does), but it's an outstanding accompaniment to this lamb stew and couscous I made.  Overall, an extremely awesome brew, and one I'd highly recommend!",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Smoked Porter,89

147,90,Hoagie1973,3.67,"Thanks to kbnooshay for the bottle.  Pours dark with red highlights. Medium/small sandy colored head. Reduces quickly to a thin cap leaving light lace.  Smells of coffee, chocolate, a sllightly acidic twang and a hint of smoke.  Flavor is malty and a bit medicinal (band aid). Espresso and a little smoke make it interesting. I was expecting more of a wood-fire smoke like a rauchbier, but the smoke character has more of a tobacco smoke quality. Not bad, just different from what was expected; not an unfamiliar combination for me. Nice balance with just a hint of dryness in the finish.  Lighter body for a porter. Good carbonation levels.  Overall it's very good, but I wasn't blown away.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Smoked Porter,89

A slightly different taste with every sip adding to the wonderful complexity of this beer. A perfect pairing with BBQ ribs, wings or smoked sausage!  Overall, very smooth and drinkable, complex and delicious, and although full-bodied, only 5.9 abv. This beer is ""top shelf"" all the way.  Get Some!!",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Smoked Porter,89
147,90,AgingWarrior,4.38,"Pours a deep dark brown, almost black. Holding the glass up to the light and you can see some reddish highlights at the bottom of the glass. A nice finger and a half of medium brown foam sits on top. Good head retention and a lot of lace with this drink.  Smells like roasted malts, but with a smokiness sort of lingering around it. It's not an overpowering smell of smoke like some smoked brews. This one blends in with the other scents and enhances the overall smell.  Tastes great! The malts and smokiness are balanced with a nice hop presence. Nice hit on the tongue with no alcohol burn and a pleasant smoky finish.  Mouth feel is smooth and creamy like a good Porter should feel.  Very easy to drink as it goes down so smoothly. I polished off my 22oz bottle and was wanting more.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Smoked Porter,89
147,90,garymuchow,4.36,"I guess I'm review #1000. An honor I guess. I've been sitting on the bottle for awhile, so I proceed with caution. Light smokey aroma and not heavy handed at all (I like that). Can catch a little malt background too, but overall pretty consistent smoke. Very dark beer with solid one inch head. Seems clear with only hints of brownish-red in the light. Some drippy lacing and partial rings marking drinks. Still nice with minimal indications of any aging (other than it's probably less bold or intense). Smooth malt profile with roast and smoke notable, but again not heavy-handed in anyway. Touch of malty sweetness with other malt flavors too. Drying increases with time leaving a long finish and somewhat hoppy mild bitter taste. Smooth with a lighter body. Carbonation is very fine on the bigger side of moderate. Boy, this has held up really well. I wonder how good a fresh bottle would/could be. Looking forward to some chicken to enjoy with this.  Thanks John B. for the bottle. Much appreciated.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Smoked Porter,89
147,90,Haybeerman,4.08,"A: Deep, dark brown; almost opaque. Poured a 1 finger creamy brown head with good retention. Lots of thick lacing.  S: Subtle roasted nuts and bit of smokiness that's clearly not overdone (as some are).  T: More smoke in the taste along with wet wood; but, like the smell, subtle. Once accustomed to that, light grains, floral hops and a sweet candy taste are present. Interesing, varied and subtle flavors are the hallmark of this beer.  M: Light body. Ample carbonation I didn't notice decanting in the appearance. Coats the mouth and tongue.  D: Could't drink many, but well worth frinking.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Smoked Porter,89
147,90,KBoudreau66,3.88,"A- Pours dark brown that I was unable to see through even when I held it up to a light. It has a thin off white head that will dissipate.  S- There really wasn't much in the way of smell, very faint hints of coffee, smoke, and a little bit like a band-aid or something along those lines.  T- It isn't as smokey as I was hoping, but it is overall a good porter. Hints of cocoa, coffee, smoke, cardboard and a little bit of alcohol in the aftertaste.  M- rich, full-bodied  D- If you're in the mood for a porter this is a solid choice as any beer by Stone is. Definitely not the best porter, but certainly not the worst. I couldn't drink it everyday, but then again I don't think I could ever drink porters everyday, only on freezing cold nights when I want to chill and watch a Celtics game.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Smoked Porter,89
147,90,lacqueredmouse,4.08,"650ml bottle, lovingly transported home to Australia and shared with friends.  Pours a dark, but clear, brilliant ruby-red with a surprisingly light off-white head of meringuey bubbles. Nice lacing. The colour is great; it's deep and delicious looking.  Strong, pleasant dark aromas on the nose. Characters of chocolate, cherries, timber and peat. not incredibly smoky, but there is an underlying hint of it. Even a little vanilla of American bourbon sneaking in. Quite deep and delicious.  More smoke on the palate, a pleasant outdoor woodfire character. The dark malt is more prominent too, with a charring roasted character providing the back palate bitterness. Among this, though, are lighter notes of cherry and tart fruit, that just peek out from around the edges of the dark, smoky foreground. Mouthfeel is great, quite thick and rich without being too heavy.  A very smooth but very complex beer. Enjoyable and pleasant, with lots to explore.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Smoked Porter,89
147,90,donteatpoop,3.64,"Dark dark brown with a nice foamy tan head that clings to the glass.  The smell is very faint, grains and nuts and thin film of smoke.  Taste was very much a porter. Not the most complex porter imaginable, but a damn good one none the less. The roasted malt and vague nutty taste are complimented with a subtle hint of smoke.  A bit thin/watery for a beer this dark, but goes down smooth enough.  This is a pleasant beer that's easy to drink.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Smoked Porter,89
147,90,TehAnkh,3.66,"A: Poured a very dark brown that you can just barely see through. One finger of tan to light brown head which appears very foamy and fluffy but recedes quickly leaving a fair bit of lacing.  S: Very very subtle smells here, roasted nuts and obviously a bit of smokiness, but I'm not getting much from the smell at all. Maybe it was just my nose at the time.  T: Obviously some smokiness, and woodiness, but it's very subtle as in the smell. I taste light grains and a little bit of floral hops, and some light fruit and candy notes in there also. As with the smell, all the flavors in here seem to be extremely subtle, but very very nice.  M: Light and crisply carbonated, yet heavy and tongue coating enough to get by as a porter. A little light for my taste, but nice.  D: I could drink a bunch of these, and with the price tag there's no reason not to. I'd choose this over a Yuengling Porter any day of the week. Smooth, refreshing, light, yet heavy enough for those who rebel against fizzy yellow beers with multi-million dollar ad campaigns (Please refer to the label on a bottle of Arrogant Bastard)",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Smoked Porter,89

Some roasted and smoky hints(who'd of guessed in a smoked porter.)  T. Nice rich roasted flavor. More roasted then smoky in my opinion. A mild hoppy bitterness on the last few sips.  M. Crisp, the bitterness and low carbonation = goodness  D.

I think I'll stick to the regular porters.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Smoked Porter,89
147,90,cpn920,3.78,Poured deep dark brown with a tan head. Smelled mildly smokey with hint of vanilla. Taste was very similar to the smell with a minimal smokey flavor.

147,90,TheMistler,4.2,"Whoah - the cap of the 22 oz. bottle just flew across the room. A dark, dark brown brew, completely opaque. Light tan head displays pretty good retention. I had previously noted, when having the Smoked Porter on tap, that the head was foamy and tiny bubbled. From the bottom it settles to a tiny-bubbled, creamy appearance, initially having been somewhat soda-like and big bubbled. Thick, sheet lacing.  Semi-sweet chocolate. Some tingling, charred meat smokiness to the aroma. Whiffs of mulch - peat smoked malts?  Chocolate and cocoa powder. Sweet and smokey, with a noticeable but largely restrained savoriness. Some slightly-spicy, grassy hop notes meld well with the smoke. Roasted notes round out the taste, leaving behind some dry coffee bittering.  Medium bodied. The carbonation isn't all the prickly, but it ""elevates"" the rich beer so that it doesn't drink too heavily.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Smoked Porter,89
147,90,HeroJH,4.15,"Very good! There are some good smoked porters out there. This one isn't a punch in the face flavor wise as some are, but I think that works in it's flavor. Compared to their other beers, Stone is showing it's versatility as well as restraint on this beer and that makes me think higher of them.  A - dark brown. Tan head, good foam at first. Some lacing.  S - Toasty and just a touch of smoke. Sweet vanilla and grain coming through.  T - Nice even flavor. Well balanced. Smokiness in the finish. Just a little bitter from both hop, smoke and the roasted grain. Hint of vanilla.  M - I love the softness of it, quite silky. A nice gentle smoke at the end, like you ate a tiny tiny piece of wood char. A little dryness on the tongue at the end.  D - Great. I wish the flavor was a little more robust up front. But it's still quite good and I think this is highly drinkable.

The unique smoke flavor doesn't seem to apparent immediately, but it is there if you hold for a moment. It's also in the after-taste. The smoke is strong but not overpowering, however, this is the only aspect I found original about this porter. Normal texture, tastes of coffee and fairly smooth.

147,90,mooseisloose,3.97,"Starting of the super bowl right with this one. Smells like freshly smoked herring, the smokey part not fishy, some hops and roasted malt. Pours to an opaque balck with a creamy head that's foamy with big bubbles on top. Upfront the taste hits you with everything: roasted malt, hops and smoke. Then one by one they peel off, first the roasted malt peels off leaving a smokey bitterness, then the smoke fades abit and leaves mostly bitterness with a hint of sweetness. Mouthfeel however seems a little thin for this complex brew. Not as chewy as one would expect for a porter. However that is not a factor that affects the flavor, nor the drinkability. In my opinion it actually improves the drinkability. Great selection by Stone.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Smoked Porter,89

147,90,Clydesdale,4.37,"A: A deep, dark brown with some reddish hints. A moderately large, fluffy and creamy light tan head bubbles up with very good retention and some nice lacing.  S: Substantial dark roasted malt aroma up front. Some toffee and charcoal in there. Definitely some dark fruit - plums and currants. Dark chocolate is noticeable. Not too much in terms of hops - perhaps some herbal/woody notes in that department.  T: Strong burnt and roasted malt flavor initially, with some toffee and lactic sweetness. Definite dark chocolate, some oak, charcoal, and faint vanilla as well. Some moderate hop bitterness is present, lending a somewhat earthy tone. Hints of smoke into the finish, but rather subtle. Some light coffee, alcohol, and burnt caramel flavor as well in the aftertaste.  M: Rather full bodied, with light carbonation. Dense and chewy, for sure. A bit of puckering dryness for balance into the finish.  D: This is a top-notch American Porter. Manages a very aggressive roasted malt character while remaining balanced, something I wasn't quite expecting from Stone. I wouldn't call it my favorite, but that doesn't mean it isn't really good.

Was happy to see Stone not going for the home run here with the hops, very balanced beer, again smoked porters are not my favorite of the style but I would drink it again.

The pour hinted at something exciting, as it showed near black with reddish edges & a small burnt beige head that quickly left, with off-white minimal lace. The aroma held an unexpected hop quality & minmal malts & smoke. The flavor likewise pushed hop bitterness at the sacrifice of smoked malts & chocolate-coffee elements that just reared their taste.

147,90,washburnkid,3.75,"The color in this beer was unexpected. Pitch black, with only the smallest appearance of dark browns around the very edges of the beer's body. Not even a finger of light tan head dissipates quickly, though a ring retains well. Smells of highly pungent smoked malts including dark chocolate and, more deeply, some fruits. The first few sips were heavily influenced by smoked malts with burnt chocolate and caramel; each of these initial sips ended with a hoppy bite, convincing me this beer was well balanced. However, after about the third sip, the hops completely overtook the palate. Though the ashy aroma stuck around, I could not pull the smoked flavor out of the hops for the remainder of this bomber. Light to medium-bodied, medium carbonation and oils coating the palate completely, mostly with bitter residue. Overall, this beer was hoppy but not unpleasant (just more than I expected from an American Porter).

Tastes very good as well, the smoke isn't overpowering but definitely present to compliment the chocolate, cream, and toffee possibly?  Thin bodied and med to high carbonated, this is the right mix as a flat smoked porter would simply not work.  As for drinkability, I'll just say I won't have any issues finishing the bomber.

Porter is not even my favorite style of beer, and I refuse to believe that a mere man has concocted this brew until I taste a glass from a different batch.  The color is an opaque black, and the head is towering with thick brown foam that seems to stay until the glass is almost empty. There is enough lacing to make my glass look like a fossil record.  The aroma is of fresh vanilla beans and chocolate, and there is a hint of smoke in the background.  Upon sipping this brew, I am introduced to a heavenly enlightenment that I have never experienced before. It is a perfect balance of chocolate, roasty malt, fresh vanilla beans, and subtle hops. The smoke is present, but perfectly tucked in the background. There is also a hint of marshmellows.  The beer has a medium body, good carbonation (especially for a cask), and a smooth finish.  Very, very drinkable, especially for a porter. I could drink these all night. I wanted to try so many other beers because the Daily Pint has such a great selection, but my conscience would not let me waste my alcohol tolerance on a different brew.

This beer was very smooth and easy to drink - nothing groundbreaking, but it certainly had a character and some interesting flavors. Aroma was also nice. I just kept wishing that it was a little more full-bodied and I wanted a little more bite from the alcohol - maybe I'm just used to imperial stouts. I'd have another one, but I had a Ruination IPA (one of my favorite Stones) right there so I drank that.

147,90,Gyle41386,4.03,"Poured from a bomber purchased at Total Wine in Columbia, SC.  Both experiences I've had with Stone brews have been learning experiences so far. From Arrogant Bastard, I learned that Stone's bottle warnings, while humorous, are indeed true. From the Imperial Russian Stout, I learned that I'm just not a fan of that style. I assumed that I would learn the same from this beer, but you never know until you try.  This beer pours a very dark brown, almost black, with some ruby red highlights and a puffy hot chocolate head.  Smells almost entirely of roasted malt. Some coffee beans and dark chocolate in there, as well, but the roasty malt is strongest.  The taste matches all of the scents, with the addition of a nice smoky character that comes in behind everything else. Very dry finish with a little hop bitterness. Everything balances out very nicely.  This beer is surprisingly light and smooth...not to say that it IS light, more of a medium-light, but I just expected this to be much heavier. It was a very pleasant surprise. Very creamy. This seems to be very drinkable.  I expected to be overwhelmed by this beer, in a bad way. I couldn't have been more wrong.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Smoked Porter,89
147,90,laituegonflable,3.58,"Pours a thick, dark, red-tinged colour with masses of head that is nonetheless thinly webbed and dispersing quite quickly - which is good, because that much head wouldn't be much good - and ends up a thin film of mocha foam. Little bit of lacing. Really quite nice.  Fair burnt coffee aroma, bit of charcoal, but not as pungent as other darks. The saving grace is a slight creamy aspect, giving it a nice chocolatey aroma. Nice, could be more powerful. If I had known what this was while trying it I would have been surprised at the lack of smokey character on the nose.  Curious taste. Quite a lot of terrain in this palate. Starts with a rich, cocoa-heavy chocolate character and then gets actually darker, like black coffee, only the mouthfeel is light and smooth and carries away the over-roasted flavour so you almost don't notice it. Finish almost has a raisiny character, it's slightly tart but mostly quite sweet, with- this will sound crazy - a flavour almost akin to musk (and I don't mean animal semen). It's not as powerful as some darks that I've had, but there's a lot of character on that and the flavours are quite pleasant. Again could probably use more, but it's very good for what it is.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Smoked Porter,89
147,90,TLove,3.75,"The Stone Smoked Porter was my first smoked porter. It did not disappoint.  The appearance was a nice color for a porter, a bit on the darker side.  The smoked meat smells are hit you almost instantaneously, and flavor the beer all the way through the taste and the finish.  Tastes of oak, smoked meats or jerky, and possesses the mouthfeel of something off a char grill. Finishes well with a little bit of coffee, burnt-bitter chocolate, and rolled oats.  Unfortunately, the heavy smokiness of this beer makes it very difficult to distinguish the other flavors. It is not the strength of the beer that is overwhelming, just the singularity of flavor component to the beer.  Would go very well with a steak.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Smoked Porter,89
147,90,bataround,4.25,"Pours a deep tan head over a clear dark brown liquid, ruby highlights. Light wisps of smokiness mingle with roasted malt makes for a quite appetizing nose. A basketful of flavors follows: light chocolate, coffee, roasted grain bitterness and a good amount of hoppiness, then some latent smokiness appears with an undercurrent of butteriness. Finishes with a bitter note...the smoke flavor accompanies, not dominates this super quaffable Porter. All blends together in perfect harmony.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Smoked Porter,89
147,90,StJamesGate,3.58,"Pours tawny brown with puffy head that holds. Smells of smoke and roastiness. Tastes of more smoke and caramel apple with only slightest hops tang at the end. Thin in the mouth.  Body is closer to a brown ale, no real balancing hops. Don't get the fuss over this beer.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Smoked Porter,89
147,90,htomsirveaux,3.62,"22 oz. bottle.  Pours with a medium tan head. Well carbonated, dark brown color with red highlights, almost opaque. Smells of coffee, chocolate, roasty smokiness. Starts sweet, more chocolate than coffee with a hint of bitterness and an underlying current of light smokiness. Medium light body. Finish is smoky and roasty. Overall want to like this more but seems like it could use a little more smoky flavors. Would drink again.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Smoked Porter,89

147,90,Gouxman,4.2,"A dark Porter with an aroma full of black, roasted and chocolate malt sitting atop a smokey base. The flavor of this porter is robust, yet smooth. Roasted malts, along with chocolate and coffee flavors, are supported by the subtle smokey character from the peat-smoked specialty malt.  One of my favorites from the guys at Stone. Add this beer to your next batch of chili for some added smokey beer flavor.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Smoked Porter,89
147,90,sweetbrew82,4,"22 oz. bottle into a pint glass; no freshness date  P: Pours dark brown from the bottle, sits inky black in the glass with rosy brown light barely penetrating the edges. Chocolatey colored head is thick and creamy. Good retention, settling to form a blanket of foam on top while leaving decent lacing.  A: Big whiffs of roasted malts, chocolate, caramel, coffee, and a puff of smoke.  T: Hmmm!!! Delicious dessert beer. Rich, roasted malts, chocolate, coffee, and some caramel greet the palate with a touch of smoke underneath. Hops do come in and provide some balance, but they seem to be a little too intrusive on the malt bill for the style. Still, they play the supporting cast throughout. I seem to get hints of subtle toffee on the back end as well. Finishes dry with some hop bitterness added in to the mix. Leaves a nice, long chocolatey aftertaste.  M: Medium-full bodied, creamy as hell, smooth, very light carbonation.  D: Very easy to drink, but a bit too sweet to go crazy with.  Notes: Like I said after the initial sip, perfect dessert beer. Despite the name, it's not nearly as smoky as I was expecting. But, what is there is a sweet, roasted malt bomb that completely satisfied my craving for something rich and delicious. In the future, if I'm looking for something of the sort again, I'm leaving the Young's DCS behind and grabbing this instead.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Smoked Porter,89
147,90,Spidey13,4.3,"Stone Smoked Porter pours a very dark brown with red highlights. A thin, light tan head sits on top. Lots of roasted coffee notes on the nose along with dark chocolate with a hint of smoke.  The flavor stars off with very rich oasted flavors. There is definitely some caramel in there. There is a good amount of hop bitterness and flavor in there. The smoke shows up on the finish, which is pretty dry. The mouthfeel is medium with fairly low carbonation.  Overall, this is a very complex beer with many layers that is very fun to explore.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Smoked Porter,89
147,90,mdagnew,4.05,"500ml bottle bought from Beersofeurope.co.uk...  Poured completely black even when held up to the light. Dirty mocha head poured tight, thick and foamy then faded slowly to nice thickish covering... some light sticky lines of lacing around the glass...  Aroma - Strong roasted malts, dark chocolate notes, ground coffee beans, very faint smoke notes although nowhere near as strong as i expected... treacle / burnt sugar sweetness, leathery, toasted nuts, faint liquorice, some pepperiness...  Taste - Nice roasted malt bitterness although not as strong as the aromas would indicate, toasted / burnt bread, lots and lots of chocolate to the fore, barely any smoke, some creamy / milky traces, woody, light treacle notes, some grassy / peppery traces, some oatiness, light sweet nutty notes...  Feel - Quite smooth and creamy... medium bodied... very drinkable and surprisingly refreshing... a very sessionable porter...  Overall - A pretty good porter although not as smoked as i was expecting - i would have liked it a touch more pronounced. In fact this was more like a chocolate stout / porter than a smoked one... certainly worth a try though...",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Smoked Porter,89
147,90,therealnod,5,"Wow...I mean wow, what a brew.  A: Everybody gets the appearance right on their Porter. Grading Porters on appearance? A Porter looks like a Porter, period. No one ever misses, not even A-B. (!)  S: Beautiful. Everything Porter.  T: Holy Hell, this thing is immense. One hell of a roller coaster ride between chocolate, coffee, vanilla bean, licorice, and a bunch of things that go by too fast to recognize properly. Big, complex, and mystifying.  M&D: Sublime.

147,90,ljbrisson,4.71,"Pours a dark brown that shines red into my Guinness pint glass. Head is voluminous and pillowy, a sandy-tan color that leaves good lacing. Aroma is malt, wood, bread, a touch of fruit. Mouthfeel is smooth and rich, with medium carbonation, a little thick compared to porters I am used to. Taste is chocolate, nuts, roasted malt, with a smoky flavor that is very distinguishable but does not knock you over the head. A little sweetness in the middle though with a surprisingly mild hop bitterness towards the finish. I have never tasted a brew quite like this; besides being a very intriguing smoked beer, it is a fantastically balanced porter in my opinion. The taste only improves as the beer warms. Drinkability is excellent due to the (thankfully) low-ish ABV and intriguing flavor that has you wanting more immediately after the taste from the previous sip has diminished.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Smoked Porter,89
147,90,clayrock81,3.93,"Poured a two-finger tan head that gives off sticky lace and dies slowly over a dark brown, almost black body. Roasted malts seem to cover up other malts in the smell as there is a smoky, charcoal like smell. A semi-sweet and creamy medium-bodied beer that has good flavor. Toffee, chocolate, coffee, roasted and some toasted malts w/ hints of coffee and bread malt with moderate dryness produce a balanced beer that hits on many strong points of porters. Not slick or anything but finishes by gliding over the tongue. I could sit back and nurse a bomber of this anytime.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Smoked Porter,89
147,90,BuffaloTapHugger,4.42,"Bomber poured into a pint glass. Poured approx. 10 oz. let settle, and let the aroma kick in. Strawberries and chocolate mixed in with some razzberries and coffee.  Head dissipates somewhat quickly. Nevertheless, because the flavor of the coffee and barley collide. The olfactory on this is World Class. By far boosts this porter above the rest.  I will recommend and drink again on the finest occasions.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Smoked Porter,89
147,90,Wackyfoot,4.7,Pours dark brown nearly black with a small to middling tan head. Intense smoky aroma hits the nostrils like a freight train and clears those sinuses straight out. Taste is primarily coffee with the smoky flavors coming through on the back end. This beer is not messing around.,Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Smoked Porter,89
147,90,WAP,4.68,"Pours a blackish-brown with a thin, but persistent head that stuck around for most of the glass. Smell was fainter than expected, but held nice dark roasted malts and a hint of smoke. Taste was excellent - intense roasted malt, smoke, and hop flavors held in perfect balance. Mouthfeel was very pleasant and creamy.  I found this to be exceptionally drinkable, with a deliciously balanced flavor balanced perfectly with the smooth, creamy mouthfeel.  A near-perfect offering from Stone in my book.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Smoked Porter,89
147,90,TheDoorman,3.58,"Pours a think brown color with a massive light brown head. Head retention is excellent. Aroma is rich, roasty malt and very smoky. Taste is filled with the same flavors as the aroma. Rich and very roasty, hints of burnt espresso with a very smoky backbone and prevalent hop character as well. Bitter, dry finish. The mouthfeel is smooth and creamy, with a tad more carbonation than I generally like, as I expected from the large head. The alcohol is fairly low, but with such bold roasted and smoky flavors, this isnt a beer you want more than one in a night. It is, however, an excellent version of a smoked porter. For a beer with flavors this bold, I would expect a higher ABV.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Smoked Porter,89

S- roasted malts with with a decent amount of smokiness to them. very hoppy as well.  T- dark, dry, and very roasted. the smokiness is there, but not as much as some others which isnt a bad thing. lots of chocolate flavor in here too, along with some licorice. at the end comes a big blast of coffee/hops.  M- big and thick. almost chewy. nice low level of carbonation.  D- a smoked porter that doesnt remind me of sipping pure liquid smoke is a good thing. easy enough to finish the entire bottle myself in about an hour. the lower level of alcohol makes it almost sessionable, which i could see myself doing if in the right mood.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Smoked Porter,89
147,90,sgoodship,4.08,"Picked this up at the Liquor Stop in Highland, Indiana after a visit to 3F. $5.29 for a 22oz.  A: Carbonation went hogwild with this one. The fairly gentle pour gave me a 5 finger head spilling over the glass. When it came back to it's senses, it was a nice creamy, fine, fluffy head. Reddish, brown - almost black liquid. Some ruby showing at the edges. The lacing was insane after all of that head action. Big topographical and stalactite shapes. Handsome looking beer.  S: Nice subtle sour roasted malt. Slight smokiness to it. Smoke same out in force when the beer warmed up more.  T: The last one I had was over chilled and it was horrible. I served this a little warmer than recommended and it was a great decision [pats self on back] because it was a lovely drink. Not a show off by any means but just what I like in a porter. A little sourness at first with the roasted maltiness following. The finish gave me an almost black currant type sweet/tart hint which was nice. After the second pour and it had warmed up more, I liked it even more. The head became darker and the maltiness took on a much more smokey personality. There was chocolate too. Really enjoyable.  M: Medium bodied. Quite smooth but carbonation is too prickly for me.  D: A really nice porter but way too over carbonated. Not jumping to the top of my porter list but I would be happy to drink it again and recommend it to anyone.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Smoked Porter,89
147,90,TrevorGW,4.09,"Had this on tap at the Stone World Bistro and Gardens. Dark hazel brown with a thin head.  Roasty aroma is soft and subtle.  Taste is very restrained but does not lack complexity. All the coffee and chocolate flavor that you would expect. Slight smoky touch in the finish. No metallic twinge, which I often dislike in porters and stouts. Smooth clean flavor all the way through.  Light mouthfeel for a porter. Very fresh feel.  Easy to drink but still a bit filling.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Smoked Porter,89
147,90,bhalter8,4.23,"Poured from a 22 oz bomber into a pint, well twice... Had this before at Taco Mac, but didn't want to review at that time. This time I had it with a steak at home, and it was an excellent match. Pours a deep, dark, black color and a nice thick caramel head (aggressive pour). The smell was not as overwhelming as some other smoked brews I have had, not bad, just not that strong. Light smell equated to lighter smoked flavor, but definitely an excellent, thick porter. Personally, I have been hit or miss with the smoked brews, but this one accented the flavor well, while not overtaking the rich porter tastes of the chocolatey malts. As rich as this brew is, it goes down easy (but filling). It's not the alcohol, but the thickness that makes one bomber about enough (well maybe it was the steak too). Definitely an excellent porter.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Smoked Porter,89
147,90,spointon,4.1,I poured this one from a 22oz brown bomber bottle into a tulip pint glass.  A= This ale poured a very dark brown with ruby red highlights. The light tan head poured about an inch or so with an agressive pour and left tons of lace down the glass.  S= Lots of sweet syrupy malts in the aroma with just a touch of smokiness deep within. Some minor chocolate and toffee came through in the nose as well.  T= The front end was a nice balance of sweet malts and a mildly bitter roasted-grain-coffee blend. The middle had a brief but solid hop bitterness and some chocolate kick. The finish dried a bit as the smoke kicked in. Not overpowering but there nonetheless to give this a beautiful long finish.  MF= Somewhere between medium and heavy bodied with a silky smooth mouth feel despite a decent amount of carbonation.  D= A very solid porter with a modest smokiness. This woild make a great gateway beer for those wishing to try their first smoked beer.,Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Smoked Porter,89

S: Roasted malts come through up front a slight sweetness on the tail end is detected resembling chocolate and honey. Chocolate aroma becomes more prevalent near the end of the drink.  T: Remaining true to its name the smokiness is present, reminding me of a subdued version of a smoked beer. The roasted malts are the dominant flavor, then the roastiness subsides followed by a sweet chocolate and just a twinge of hops on the tail end.  M: Full bodied, low carbonation, no alcohol detected on the tongue.  D: Very drinkable for the style, the smokiness is not overpowering but definitely present.

147,90,beer2day,4.05,"Pours black with reddish tint. Minimal head. Not much in the way of lacing. Initial hit does not give up much in the way of taste, but leads to a more roasted than smoked finish. Good bitters in the finish as well, not overly so.

Small tan head to start but it quickly fades away to nothing. It might be my glass but there's little to no head regention. S- I get some black licorice and a bit of smoke. I was expecting a little bit more in the terms of aroma. I do get some alcohol as it warms, which I found surprising. T- Man is this beer delicious. Smoke, lots of smoke. Licorice and a bit of roasted malt. Did I mention the smoke? M- Mouthfeel is on par for a porter. Medium body and exceptionally smooth. D- Drinks well for a smoked beer. Goes down easily. I could try to put away a couple of these but I think the smoke would get in the way.  Overall, a damn fine porter and a damn fine smoked beer.

147,90,yesyouam,4.8,"At first glance, this beer is the solid black of the monolith. When held to the light, it yields a very intense, low-frequency red of an LED. The head is thick, lumpy, and tan. The aroma is that of roasted coffee, a hint of smoke, and possibly spuce and licorice. I can't help but notice the cementish smell of the yeast. It is instantly recognizable as a California beer. The flavor is very pulled-together. The smoke flavor does not at all overwhelm. The bitterness is appropriately prominent with a grapefruitish flavor. Perhaps this is from Cascades? Again, very California. It seems to be around 35 IBU. The citrus bitterness melds seamlessly with that of dark coffee and dark chocolate. It avoids being astringent and the smoke flavor merely lurks in the background. If anything, it serves to enhance the overall roasted flavor. It is medium-bodied and very drinkable. This could serve as a session beer. The carbonation is lively and seems to bring out the flavor of the hops. Neither the roasted flavor nor the grapefruit rind flavor muddle each other and work together brilliantly. Again: a very pulled-together flavor. The aftertaste is short and has the bitterness of french roast coffee and bitter chocolate. I love it. (rated Jan 15, 2007)",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Smoked Porter,89

Very fainted smell with a hint of smokiness  Earthy, smokey flavor with almost no hop presence. A well balanced dark strong brown ale with the delicately smoke flavor.  Full, creamy body and great mouthfeel  Stone recommends paring with both BBQ and deserts, which would go well. But today we had it with a bacon and squash pizza (no tomato sauce), and it was excellent. Any pairing with bacon or something that goes with bacon would be wonderful.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Smoked Porter,89
147,90,Dirty1,4.27,"I bought a bomber of this at Whole Foods in White Plains New York the other day. I poured into a pint glass.  A- Very dark brown with some ruby red tint. I can barely see through it when held to light. No head to speak of, but had a slight off white film that floated on top. It left no lace rings.  S- First whiff had a nice chocolate malt aroma with slight notes of coffee and caramel. It also had a pleasent smokey note that was very subdued.  T- Much like the smell, chocolate malts dominated. It also had subtle hints of coffee, sweet toffee, and vanilla with a light fig or raisin note. It had a realy good smokey undertone that didn't overpower everything else. It also had some mild citrusy hops on the back end.  M- Medium body with good carbonation. The over all feel seems to fit this style of beer very well.  D- I'm not general a big fan of porters, but do like smoked beers. I liked this a lot! I thought the smoke was very balanced with the malty sweetness and didn't over power the way some do. I drank with grilled pork chops and thought they complemented each other nicely. I will definatly buy again and could drink a few of these at one sitting. Over all another very nice beer from Stone.

If you are looking for something smoky, something with serious rauch appeal, grab a a rogue smoke ale, or an alaskan smoked porter, but not this. Pours almost black, a tinge of amber can be seen around the edges when holding it to the light, lets you know it's not quite a stout. the smell is fantastic, chocolately, grains, caramel. almost some smoke hiding in there somewhere.

Then I stuck my schnozz in there again and smelled some dark fruit, then some wood, then licorice and herbs, then some pine needle, then some smoked salt, then....well, I could go on and on. The nose is so complex you can dig-out all kinds of aromas. Like I said, a beer geek's beer - you could study this one for hours. Some may be turned off by this one, but I find it really fun.

Taste: A very nice smokey malt, with esters citrus, and resin. There are hints of musty earth ( kinda like mold) sweet bread yeast, and bananas.

The head leaves a collar that remains over the course of the beer.  Smell: Chocolate, coffee, cigars. 3 distinct and abrupt smells, working well together.  Taste: A very strong porter; they definitely don't mess around at Stone Brewery. A smokey oak flavor up front, and it is easy to taste the alcohol. The middle and end are a bomb of malt and hops, with some vanilla and caramel flavorings. The end leaves with a slight smokey chocolate aftertaste residue.  Mouthfeel: Definitely a very full body, but still fairly smooth. There is a definite bite to this porter, like it wants to fight your tongue.  Drinkability: The richness of the porter will definitely impede the speed of consumption, although the fact that it is a thick, chewy, tasty brew more than makes up for that fact.

147,90,Arbitrator,3.56,"A: Dark black. Careful pouring still creates half a finger of head, which recedes slowly over a few minutes.  S: Chocolate, coffee -- somewhat understated, but I just got over a cold so I can't be sure.  T: Coffee, toast, a little cherry, and smoke at the end. Pretty balanced, but it needs to warm up slightly for all of it to come out.  M: Carbonation is light, no alcohol burn. Pleasant.  D: Very filling, I can only have one bomber. But it's good.  I've had some better porters and I'll stick with those. But this is nothing to scoff at.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Smoked Porter,89
147,90,JohnnyDuvel,4.3,"I'm so happy to have Stone in Florida. I've tried several of their beers over the years, and I'm really looking forward to the ""big beers"" getting here. In the meantime, Arrogant Bastard, Ruination, IPA, Pale Ale, and this - the Smoked Porter, will have to do. This one poured dark, retained head to the last drop. Toasty, coffee-like flavor, with a hint of smoke added to the mix. Unlike some beers of the style, this is not dry. Actually quite refreshing and very easy going down. As good as an American Porter as I've had. Now, if we could get Alesmith down here!!!",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Smoked Porter,89
147,90,burnstar,4.38,Pours very dark brown to black with a smallish off white head. Aroma is subdued roasted malt with a touch of smoke. Taste has a light background sweetness. Chocolate and coffee notes. The smokiness is not overpowering at all and actually complements the other flavors. A little roasted malt bitterness. No particular flavor dominates. Very balanced and very good. Not too heavy.. medium to full bodied and well carbonated which adds a bit of bite that works well with this beer. An extremely flavorful beer which is also quite drinkable. Excellent overall.,Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Smoked Porter,89

147,90,hoplover82,4.06,"It pours a thick black color with a medium to thin tan head that wofts chocolate and woodsy hops together, then after that fades to smoky chocolate.  Very smoky in the flavor - kinda made me jump back. This is my first smoked beer. Some coffee notes.  A lasting bitterness goes good. Real nice lacing. Very bubbly and soft on the palate. At first the smokiness wasn't subtle but as it warms a little it mellows out.  Very nice beer indeed.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Smoked Porter,89
147,90,soupyman10,4.2,"Got this one on-tap at the Big Hunt. Have fond memories of it in the bottle, so figured I'd be a fan on tap as well. Pours a near black with a solid head on top and a touch of lacing. Sweet and roasted malty nose. Not as hoppy as some of Stone's offerings. Flavor is almost stouty becaues of the way the smokiness mixes in with the roasted malt. Vanilla, chocolate, maybe a bit of coffee as well. Feel is good, appropriate for the style. Overall, a very tasty beer.  Big Hunt/16 oz/$6",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Smoked Porter,89
147,90,OtherShoe2,4.45,"Pours a beautiful dark brown with a tan dense head. Held to the light, you get nice ruby hues. Good lacing.  Smells of chocolate, coffee, charcoal, and a whiff of smoke.  Mild chocolate, coffee, and dark toast elements. The smoke hits you as you inhale at the sip, and you sense it in the taste and finish -- but it is by no means overpowering -- almost as if someone burned the toast. Some hop bitterness as well, Very nicely balanced beer.  A mouth filler for sure, but thin enough where you know this is porter. If I closed my eyes, I'd swear this was fresh from the tap. Very smooth and, if you are a porter person, easy to drink. One of my favorites.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Smoked Porter,89

Fairly expected malts and roasted nuts...where's the smoke?  T-Full bodied and excellent, as one would expect. A bit fruity, raisins, chickory, coffee, and all good...an admirable effort...but smoke? Ok, maybe a little in the taste...maybe a bit more in the aftertaste...but no more...and maybe this is not a bad thing.  M-all good here..the right amount of carbonation and balance, a full mouth, as one would expect.  D-A very good porter...maybe one of my favorites, but these guys are masters of the brewing art.

147,90,stephens101,3.85,"Pours a pure black with a large, fluffy tan head which recedes in a dilatory manner leaving a sheet of slightly pocked lacing all around the glass. Aroma has elements of dark chocolate, burnt wood, very slight notes of caramel and is not as bold as expected. The palate is filled with notes of dark chocolates, coffee, cherries, licorice and hops, with the smoky characteristics revealing themselves in the very end. The taste is very well-balanced, and like the smell, isn't as bold or complex as expected, but remains tasty and satisfying nonetheless. I would go as far as to say the seeming innocuousness of the aromas and tastes are part of what make up the special charm of this brew. Mouth-feel is slightly thick and creamy, thus making for a smooth ride down the gullet. A fair amount of carbonation is revealed with a quick shake.

147,90,Brianmerrilyn,4,"I picked this one up at Skibbo's on East Tremont in the Bronx last week and let it age for a month which is long time for me. Probably should not have had Stone's Russian Imperial Stout prior. Nevertheless, poured into pint glass to show off on on black with brown residue tints on the side. Head was fairly big with solid lacing that drooped off after 2-3 quafs. Nose was on on strong roasted malt and hopearth secondary aroma. The taste was very pungent but not overpowering becuase my pallet still has the RIS hanging around. Mouthfeel was thin and sharp bitterness from the hops. Good heavy porter.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Smoked Porter,89

S: smoky pine and dried citrus, and dark roasted malt and chocolate.  T: The initial flavor has a nice smoky and roasted malting with some sweet chocolate coming through. There is a slight coffee bitterness that follows along with some dark raisin grist, black licorice and dried prunes adding some spicy dark nature to the beer.  M: very smooth and smoky with dark chocolate. The body is full with ample carbonation bringing out the nice roasted nature and left a good smoky lacing.  D: Very good drinkability with good complexity and well balanced providing a great experience.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Smoked Porter,89

Sort of thin, but very drinkable.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Smoked Porter,89
147,90,nick76,2.95,"The aroma is about what I expected. It's smokey, toasty, malty, nutty, and mildly alcoholic. The appearance is red/brown with a nice foamy head. The taste is like the aroma with a bitter finish. The palate is OK but not as thick as I was hoping for.

147,90,HalfFull,3.85,"Poured into a pint glass, this beer flows a deep reddish brown with a half inch of light tan head that is light and bubbly. Retention and lacing are moderate to light.  Initial scents of chocolate segue to iced coffee as the head settles.  Taste's of milk chocolate followed by some roasted coffee and finishing with a dry and smoky peat and smoke flavor. Having sampled the Chipotle and Vanilla Bean versions I finally find the true smoked flavor, and in the original. It was more subtle with the Chipotle and overwhelmed by the Vanilla. Mouthfeel is a bit thin direct from the fridge but improves slighlty as the beer warms to proper temperature.  Nice drinkability with good carbonation yet nothing over the top.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Smoked Porter,89

147,90,gonzo46and2,3.9,22 oz brown bomber purchased at World of Beer in Westchase. This brewery just started distributing in Florida this month. I was excited to finally see what the hype was about for Stone brewing.  Pours a dark brown with red highlights.  Smell was very mild perhaps from being too cold. I let it warm up a bit and got a bit of coffee and cocoa. The aroma seemed smooth and sweet with notes of toasted bread.  Taste is a mild maltiness that's not bitter at all. I had a hard time detecting much smoke. This may be because I haven't had enough smoked beers to have developed a palate for it. It definitely wasn't a rauchbier smokiness. (There wasn't any kielbasa flavor)  Finishes very clean and the body is medium light making this beer very easy to drink.,Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Smoked Porter,89
147,90,auburngrad82,4.33,"Poured from a bottle into a pint glass.  A- Pours a beautiful deep brown, almost black color with a nice tan head, and leaves a decent lacing as the glass is emptied.  S- The aroma is subtle but the malt is front and center.  T- The taste on this is what wins me over. Chocolate and coffee flavors and a slight smokiness (almost burnt) flavor come out on top.  M- Nice full mouthfeel.  D- It's been a while since I've had a really good porter and this one reminded me of what I was missing. A really good porter.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Smoked Porter,89
147,90,wiseguy142,3.5,"Pours a pretty nice translucent brown with a minimal tan head and good lacing. Aroma is pretty light an airy, with only a little bit coming from the smoke. I'd say the best thing about this beer is the blend of the smoke with the roasted malt. It's very subtle, though and I think they could make it a lot more noticeable. Pretty easy to drink but the water quality doesn't quite fit in with the taste of the beer. This beer got a lot of hype and it's decent but if it wasn't in a big Stone bottle I probably wouldn't think much of it.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Smoked Porter,89
147,90,Shaw,4.01,"Pours almost totally black, with just a little light seeping through. It has a nice light brown head, too.  It has a nice aroma of toasted and roasted grain with a hint of smoke.  The taste is great. It's lightly smoky, with nice flavors of coffee, roasted malt and chocolate.  The body is glassy smooth.  Overall this is an excellent porter and a nice contrast to Stone's hoppier brews.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Smoked Porter,89
147,90,OlieIPA,3.48,"Enjoyed a pint of this with my good buddy PatronWizard at the Yardhouse in Chino Hills. Review is from notes taken at this establishment.  A: Dark-brown hue with hints of ruby red, probably caused by the piercing light that penetrated my glass. Also exhibited a thick and appetizing beige head.  S: Really subtle, which made it hard to pinpoint anything in particular other than dark and brown malts.  T: A distinct burnt taste with dark malts. A lot of my friends pick up that BBQ smokiness, but its much more subtle than what I thought it would have been.  M: Lighter than most porters I've had; medium body and light on the carbonation side.  D: Easy to drink...no hint of alcohol at all. Perfect for a get together with friends and family.  Overall: A worthy to good beer on the BA scale. Will probably enjoy again, but not the first thing I will look for on a beer list.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Smoked Porter,89

Smell - Get a thick chocolate malty smell. Smoke character is in there, but not overpowering. Aroma could be more powerful...  Taste - Very strong taste. Notes of coffee, charcoal, hint of chocolate...also get a hint of hop flavor.  Mouthfeel - Very carbonated. Leaves a good coating on the mouth...taste lingers for a while.

147,90,popery,3.91,"A good porter with chocolate and coffee notes but less flavor than hoped for. Ok. Let's start with the bad stuff. I expect a lot out of a Stone beer, and the Smoked Porter didn't quite live up to my expectations. I don't mean that it was bad. It's a big, flavorful porter that pours a rich, dark brown color and supports a nice-sized, coffee-cream head. The appearance is spot on, but the smell unfortunately doesn't punch as much as the look. Rich chocolate sweetness predominates the nose, but it lacks the complexity of a bigger beer. I'm not being very forgiving here, but I was hoping for more smoke and more interest from this entry in Stone's lineup. Smoke is also disappointingly weak in the flavor profile. It's there, but I was expecting and hoping for it to punch me in the face. Chocolate and coffee were both stronger for me than smoke. It's a good porter and I enjoyed it, but it's probably not a beer that I will be returning to soon.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Smoked Porter,89
147,90,botham,3.78,"bomber poured into a nonic pint. pours opaque black with distant garnet highlights and three fingers of foamy, tan head that has good retention and leaves light lacings.  aroma is of chocolate and black malts up front with a roasted and smokey base. the smoke does well in adding an earthy tone to the nose, but seems ancillary in execution.  taste is rich with roasted malts up front with subtle notes of chocolate and smoke, all building up to a finish of lightly bittering hops and residual roasted malt.  mouthfeel is full bodied and rich with a texture of silky smooth liquid chocolate. finishes lightly sweet with bittering hops in the aftertaste and residual roasted malt.  drinkability is decent. this is a solid porter, but the smoke is very understated. the aroma shows promise with a nice base of smokey tones wrapped around a rich roasted character, but the taste does not follow suit. could be much more assertive without any problems.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Smoked Porter,89

147,90,BamaBeerBuff,3.75,"A: Pours a very deep brown color with ruby highlights. A rather creamy, milk chocolate colored head sticks around for a good while, leaving impressive sheets of lace as it recedes. Not as rocky and pitting as some other porter heads, but still nice.  S: Chocolate malts and a strong smokiness that is akin to (oddly enough) smoked salmon (as opposed to the bacon-like aroma one gets from rauchbiers). Aroma could be a bit stronger and perhaps more complex, but it's still pleasant.  T&M: As is the norm with Stone, the flavor is big, bold, and punches you right in the face. Roasted malt flavors with notes of charcoal, chocolate, some caramel/toffee, and a touch of herbal hop flavor. The finish is long and lightly smoky, toasty, and hoppy. Solid flavor profile. The body is full like a stout with creamy mouthfeel. I've docked the score a bit because I prefer my porters to be medium bodied and more drinkable. If they wanted to make a beer this heavy, just call it a smoked stout and darken the beer a touch.  D: It's heavier than most porters, which kind of negates the positives of drinking a porter. I like porters because they pack a lot of bold malty flavor while still being drinkable and sessionable. Still, Stone's porter is a top-notch beer that I wouldn't mind trying again, but not if I'm really craving a true porter.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Smoked Porter,89

147,90,davexisxrabid,4.25,"Poured myself a 22 oz. bottle of this stuff into a pint glass. This porter is almost black in color, tinged with brown at the edges and when held up to the light. There was about half an inch of head that dissipated quickly and left good lacing throughout my enjoyment of the brew.  At first whiff, I immediately detected some dark chocolate and roasted malts. Later on I picked up some of the yeasty hop aroma, not too prominent though.  Took a nice swig and felt the rush of dark chocolate and the sweet malts, big time. Tasted exactly as it smelled. There was hops in the aftertaste, very well balanced. Almost had a coffee like-flavor; I'm not a fan of coffee, but if coffee tasted as good as the Stone Smoked Porter, I'd guzzle that stuff every morning...  Smooth mouthfeel, the hops do stick around. Tasted some carbonation in there but not much alcohol.  Very easy to drink. Definitely would have another one; the rich flavor may be too much to make this a session beer but you can't beat that flavor.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Smoked Porter,89

Beer itself is about as dark as they come - near black, completely opaque. When held right up to a light some reddish brown comes through. Stellar.  S - Oak, coffee, chocolate cake, roasted almonds. Very complex.  T - Those nutty/oat/coffee notes from the nose are front and center here. Not so much in the way of sweetness, it's like a warm hug personified. Or drinkified. Whatever. Porters don't get much better.  MF/D - Smooth and creamy with a clean finish. Extremely drinkable while refusing to be simple.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Smoked Porter,89

T - Smoky, molasses malts, and some walnut. Hops show up heavy in the burp. Glorious hoppy smoked porter.

Aroma is mostly sweet, malty, with a bit of chocolate and a nice, somewhat subdued smokiness, which is not overpowering at all.  Flavor is very similar to the nose, with sweet malt flavors, some bittersweet chocolate, a bit of coffee, and some charred smoke flavor, finishing slightly bitter and a little dry. Medium-bodied with a nice smoothness across the palate.

The smell, while not bad, is disapointing. A heavy malt sweetness is the most powerfull scent, with a minimal amount of smokiness. The same can be said for the taste, nice malty flavors, with a miniml smoke aftertaste. The beer is medium bodied with above average carbonation, not crazy-just slightly more than average, and is quite drinkable. Not a bad beer, but a disapointing one.

147,90,jkendrick,4.13,"Appearance: Dark brown, but light is still barely visible through the glass revealing reddish tints. A nice tan head about ¾ inch thick which dissipated slowly leaving plenty of lacing. A nice looking beer.  Aroma: The aroma is typical porter with chocolate and coffee present , but not very smoky. The aroma is nice enough, but not very strong. I guess I was expecting a more powerful aroma -- smoky aroma - from this.  Mouthfeel: Nice and thick and the carbonation is present just enough, maybe a bit too much for my taste. It definitely has a nice body that carries the taste nicely.  Taste: Typical porter flavors, with coffee, chocolate, caramel all present. Strangely though, I don't taste much smoke. There is a bitterness, but it's not unpleasant.  Overall impression: This one looks great and the rest of the experience isn't too shabby either. I was expecting more smoke from a smoked porter, especially with Stone's reputation for big flavors.

147,90,IronDjinn,3.58,"Picked up a bottle of this down in Bonner's Ferry Idaho at the Boundary Market Trading Post, although the Canadian Customs officer didn't believe me that I had paid that much for an American beer (he figured I was hiding 6 packs for the price that I paid for these bombers). Things were worked out without the need for any body cavity searches, fortunately.  Came in a brown 22 oz. bomber, pours out a deep opaque black, amber syrup highlights on the bottom of the glass when held to light, along with deep garnet mahogany in the body. Tall frothy chunky head of a light beige tone with lengthy retention and intermittent streaks of lacing.  Smoky char on the nose, some sweet boozy notes, some carob nut.  Malt is coyly sweet, the roast picks up momentum into a coffee ground character, underlying notes of light cocoa and carob, ending with a smoked wood finish. Lingering roasted and wood smoked aftertaste, well contained and enjoyable.  Mouthfeel is medium-bodied for the most part but finishes with a full rich velvety creamy texture that bursts forth.  An enjoyable smoked porter, though not the most memorable I've had of the style, nor from Stone's line-up, although it'd make a great intro to the style for the wary or unsure, very approachable for a Stone ale.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Smoked Porter,89

Taste is roasty like coffee, some dark malts and caramel involved. A little of the licorice and some spicey hops in the finish, not turning bitter or anything.

There is a slight caramel scent hiding in there as well.  The taste is at first peaty and dry. The sweetness is cut by the smokey taste, but comes back with the hops in the end. Caramel tastes show up after it warms a little.  The mouthfeel shows a little less body than some of the heavier porters. Not a bad thing at all.  Drinkability is better than many porters. This style is not at the top of my list like it was in the past, but this is one that I could drink plenty more of since it is not so sweet.

Taste has some nice flavors of roast and black malts with notes of dark bitter chocolate, licorice, coffee, and yes, some faint smoke. Moderate hop bitterness actually left a mild tang on my tongue but the semi-sweetness of the malt balanced it nicely. Some faint but interesting grassy and lemongrass-like hop flavor. I felt that the mouthfeel was a tad thin for a porter but it was rather drinkable for that reason. This was a decent beer, don't get me wrong, but there definately was a lack of boldness for this style in the mouthfeel, the hop bitterness/flavor/aroma, and especially with the smoke flavor and aroma. Maybe because Stone makes such awesome beers I was expecting more. Still, a worthy beer for consumption.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Smoked Porter,89
147,90,Zadok,3.97,"Poured almost a pitch black with a thin film head. Maintained a small dollop of bubbles in the center.  Roasted malt at first whiff, a light hint of coffee as well.  Initial flavor had a smoked coffee backbone. Has a very subtle richness to it.  Very creamy to say the least, low carbonation. Coats the mouth and throat very well.  A smooth and easy drinking beer, flavor seems a touch subdued. Maybe it was a touch to cold when I consumed...hmmm, possibly.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Smoked Porter,89

S: Smelled mainly of coffee and malt, with some sugar thrown in for good measure.  T: Flavored with coffee, chocolate, malt and a bit of sugar. Not as complex or flavorful as you'd expect, but decent nonetheless.  M: A fair amount of carbonation and a very dry finish. Medium-bodied.  D: Overall, this is a drinkable beer. I think it's a bit on the overrated side, but it's still a well made beer.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Smoked Porter,89
147,90,PatrickJR,3.96,"Poured from a 22 oz bottle into nonic pint glass.  A - Jet black, opaque. Two fingers of brownish head rise with decent retention, eventually settling to a thick film. Decent lacing as well.  S - Right out of the fridge, I couldn't smell anything. As it's warmed up some, the aroma is coming out but it's still a bit faint overall. The smoke is a very minor note hiding in the background atop a general aroma of sour, overripe fruit and roasted malt. Very faint though.  T - Very interesting, and thankfully not as muted as the nose...though I still feel there's a certain restraint with this brew. The smoke sticks to the back of the palate and is present thoughout. Not overbearing or barbeque-like as other smoke-infused beers, but more like a mild fireplace flavor. The rest of the taste is completely separate consisting mostly of sour berries, perhaps blue/blackberries, prunes, and even sour banana or sour apple somewhere in there. Very mild roasty bitterness in the finish, but barely detectable. My first impression was that this beer is devoid of hop flavor, but I *almost* get the sensation that some floral/herbal hops are mingling with the smoke flavor. I can't really tell, but the possibility is interesting. While good, the flavor is still very muted.  M - Luscious. The usual creaminess from Stone is here, better, and more suited to the beer. Full bodied with a silky, chewy mouthfeel. Carbonation is low. Very nice.  D - The mouthfeel and the muted yet apparent flavor make for excellent drinkability. Good stuff.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Smoked Porter,89

Smell is a dark chocolate, hints of dark berries and coffee. I don't really smell any smoke. Taste is a little more bold. Bitter bakers chocolate and coffee. A little bit of a charred malt, but still no real smoke.  Mouthfeel is medium bodied with a mild carbonation.

There is no hint of fake smoke flavor.  Taste is brilliant, with toasted malts, vanilla toffee, caramel. The hops add a nice spicy bitterness and a hint of pine. I hesitate to call this ale ""smoky"" as much as ""roasted"", as I don't get that heavy smoke flavor like with a rauschbier. Creamy in the mouth with a well carbonated peppery finish.

Scent is faint at first. After some sniffing I get chocolate, coffee, and a wisp of wood smoke. As the beer warms and I continue to enjoy it the smoky aroma becomes more noticeable.  Taste is chocolate, fresh coffee, roasted grain and lightly smoky notes. Though subtle, the smoke flavor lingers nicely. Not as aggressive a beer as I've come to expect from Stone, but that's not necessarily a bad thing. As the beer warms the smokiness seems to grow and become more noticeable. Slight woody flavors join it. Hop presence is minimal but a little bitterness shows its head now and again.  Rich, chewey robust mouth feel.  Drinkability is very good.  A subtle beer for Stone. Doesn't knock my socks off but is well crafted and quite delicious and I'd certainly buy it again.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Smoked Porter,89
147,90,taylorhamrick,4.07,"Pours out dark, with a hint of brown. Forms a nice head on top, and leaves decent lacing all the way down the glass. I love the smell, smells smoky and roasty, very enticing. I'm nost sure how much I like smoky flavors from my small experience with smoked beers, but the taste is still very subtle, though the smokiness seems to come out more as the beer warms. I wonder what this would taste like without the smoked malts. I really love the mouthfeel, it's a bit creamy and very, very smooth. And I think that could make it very easy to drink a lot of these in succession, though I think I would get bored of the smokiness after a while.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Smoked Porter,89

Smell: Very strong malty smell of chocolate with a hint of smokiness to it with a slight hint of roasted coming through.  Taste: A bit light at first but then a strong bitterness comes through with the malts that leaves a somewhat dry aftertaste with a slight sweetness at the end.  Mouthfeel: Feels light bodied, slightly watery but is incredibly smooth but with a possible hint of overcarbonation.  Drinkability: This beer is very easy to drink but the taste of it leaves you desiring slightly more to it-it has a bit of blandness to it. I would probably drink another given its smoothness.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Smoked Porter,89

Very nice  T - very similar to the nose. Roasty malt and chocolate go along very nicely with the smoke...and...what's this!? A nice and subtle hop bitterness is present pushing this up to a 4.5 for me. Awesome  M - medium bodied and creamy. Nice going down  D - well, I've been wanting to try this for a while and it's certainly very good. The smoke is a nice touch, and this is just a really solid porter all around.

Has a bitter undertone to it. The smell will make your mouth water.  Taste: BOO YAA! Has a smoky, dark coffee like taste. Chocolate and malt flavors are there as well. Very rich and creamy, you'll want to drink this down in a second and go back for more.  Mouthfeel: Nicely thick, with a creamy feel to it. Starts to get a strong bite after being in the mouth for a few seconds. Leaves a good aftertaste, with an abundant amount of bitterness being left on the palate.  Drinkability: Anytime. I repeat, anytime. This is a spectacular beer and a spectacular Porter. You could drink this with a hearty meal, while sitting back in front of the tv, or any other time whatsoever.

Very subtle sweetness, a little chocolaty, followed by a nice blend of toasted malts. . The smokey flavor comes through just enough to make its presence known and satisfy the palate. There's a lot of great flavors going on here, but none of them overstay their welcome.  Mouthfeel is somewhat smooth/creamy.  Drinkability is excellent. Enjoyable on its own, or could pair great with a grilled steak or maybe even smoked salmon. The ABV isn't bad, so enjoy a couple of these!  So glad Stone is now available in GA.

The color is rather teaky around the edges of the glass but become nearly black in the middle, with a tan head that froths up nicely and fades quickly. There's a nice amount of smoke in the taste with a solid porter platform that I'm sure would be fine on its own. The smoke isn't overpowering and even tastes a bit salty. A nice hit of malt up front and just a tinge of hops as it goes down. I had this with pizza and apple pie-- a great combination! Very much worth drinking, more than once.

This is far less smoky than any of the Schlenkerla beers, but the smoke is noticeable and beautifully wedded to the rest of the brew. The surprising thing to me about this beer is how creamy and smooth it is. The rich, creamy body marries very well with the smoke and helps to balance everything nicely. The Alaskan Smoked is far more smoky tasting, but in that case probably because the body is not as robust and creamy as this is. The balance in this beer is a thing of beauty. I recently tried a bottle of this that had been aged a year as well, and although it was still drinking beautifully, the smoke was even more subdued. I also like the fact that this doesn't have that much residual sweetness, despite the creaminess. A very nice beer.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Smoked Porter,89

I don't really detect any smoke flavors. M/D: A medium body that is creamy, chewy, and well carbonated. Smooth and easy to drink. A porter that hits the spot.  A pretty good porter. I don't detect hardly any smoke though. Other than that, everything you want for the style.

This is simply chocolate thrown into a damn campfire!  A: Brown in color, but light for a porter. Looks more like a dark brown ale. When held up to the light, this has a nice red/cola color that looks real nice. The head is a three finger dark khaki and very creamy and lasts a long time.  S: Smell is phenomenal for the style. Let me first start by saying that this smells like a bonfire. Very woody and smokey, just as this is advertised. There is also a lot of chocolate and a tad cigarette smell in the nose also. Very complex smell, also with some dark cocoa and roast as well.  T: I usually go into these beers thinking that there will be a lack of smoke or woody flavors, but this one really lives up to the expectations. This one is extremely smokey, just like a campfire. It is a bit light in body, but still has nice chocolate and light cocoa flavors as well that make up for that.  Overall, this is a great smoked porter.

It's been sitting in my fridge for a few months now, so I figured this would be a good time to crack this one, especially now that it's readily available in Georgia now.  Poured into my Boulevard chalice. Pours a dark brown. Looks a little watery and has almost no head at all.  Smells of dried fruit; prunes, raisins, bit of alcohol and roasted malts.  Tastes of roasted malts, a hint of raisins, almost port-like, but much more subdued.  A slightly watery mouthfeel with moderate carbonation.  A pretty drinkable porter.

Smell somehow doesn't reveal the smoke that I expected, only on a very small scale toward the end. Very nice chocolate scents, luring me in. A bit of cocoa and a touch of coffee. Again, the end displays the smallest hint of smoke. What a great tasting beer! The smoke is definitely here now. Still, it only provides an added complexity to the beer itself. Nice chocolate flavors, toasted caramel and roasted malts. Smoked barley plays well with the rest of the flavors. Shockingly, the hop presence in the finish of this one is nearly on the level of the Pale Ale. Well, maybe not, but it wasn't expected so much here as it was there, and I welcome it. Excellent medium body that is silky smooth, with a nice roast/smokey finish that works wonders. I could drink a couple of these no problem, though a regular Porter such as Black Butte would be easier to return to on a regular basis.

The smell of the drink is sweetly smoky, with a note of cocoa-dusted caramel and café au lait.  The taste is richly malty with syrupy, creamy mocha sweetness, and a dark, smoky finish. A bit of dark chocolate emanates from the succulent depths of the drink, as does a lightly-charred note of espresso and overdone whole grain toast. Lingering earthy dryness, smoky chocolatey notes, and a drop of black coffee persist in the mellow aftertaste.  Stone's Smoked Porter is full of flavor and medium in body, with fine carbonation that gives the drink a light, creamy feel.

Thick and malty, Smoked Porter is teeming with dry roasted and baked flavors, rich chocolate and caramelized sugar flavors, and light, fruity, floral hop. There's a citric hop spritzer that adds balance and depth to the dominant malt. There's also a mild hoppy bitterness shares tonguespace with a lighter dry husky bitterness - both are key to providing that bittersweet beer character. Hint of alcohol marries well with the bright, floral, fruity, almost-white-wine-like hop flavor/aroma.  Beyond being a solid Porter, I find it disappointingly not-very-smoky. I can remember regular non-Smoked Porters that came across smokier. Also, there was a surprisingly strong hop flavor for a Porter that I found to be very nice.

Not much aroma, but a little malty chocolate and just a hint of smokiness. At first I didn't taste any smokiness at all in this one, so I was quite disappointed. Tasted like an average porter; roasted malt and a slight sweet chocolate flavor. However, as it warmed up a little, the smokiness started to emerge a little bit. The smoky flavor was still not as bold as I expected though, but that's not a bad thing. Excellent, full mouthfeel. Overall, not as bold as I expected, but a really well balanced porter, nonetheless.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Smoked Porter,89
147,90,wolffman17,4.13,"Stone Smoked Porter pours deep brown, not quite opaque, with ruby red highlights. Two-inch creamy head dissipates slowly.  Subtle chipotle aroma surrounded by chocolate, a bit of caramel, and plenty of roasty malt.  Excellent balance of roasty bitterness and malty sweetness...no one flavor overpowers another. Smokiness makes itself most known in the finish, especially on exhale.  Lingering bitter aftertaste that's also somewhat sour. Finishes on the thin side.  An easily drinkable beer for the style. The smokiness contributes without dominating. Grab some BBQ to enjoy with this one.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Smoked Porter,89
147,90,omnigrits,4.25,"I've been waiting a while to try this one and I must say that I'm not disappointed - the hype lived up to itself. Holding the glass up to the light reveals a sumptuous dark mahogany colour. There's a good porter aroma with a hint of the advertised smoke. Porters can be smoky even when they're not described as such but this one lets you know it's there without being overpowering. The flavour is pleasantly dry but cut by just a hint of malt. It's a big beer, no two ways about it. Something to round off the night with, like a fine glass of port, but not a session drink. Can't wait to try this one with a good quality cheese.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Smoked Porter,89
147,90,Bitzy,4.15,I read a few reviews prior to drinking this great brew which helped me interpret its complex delicious tastes.  Firstly I couldn't really detect the smokey part in the taste despite being able to smell smoke-like hints in the aroma. In the end I decided that the slightly alcoholic esters at that are felt towards the end of the swallow was the smokiness intended to be tasted in this beer.  Overall I loved this beer. The roasted malts lent themselves to delectable chocolate and coffee notes like a rich cafe latte. Despite its mouthfeel being on the heavy side (which I like) this bodacious brew was very drinkable.  Thanks Stone Brewing Company for another amazing beer!!!,Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Smoked Porter,89
147,90,Atron67,3.41,"750 ml bottle ive had around for a little while, time to finally crack this baby open.  A- pours a clear black with a copper red hue through the glass, tufts of brown head on top, built up an inch or so on the pour and left wet thin lacing down the glass.  S- not a fan of this smell, its malty, not much hops (slightly sweet), but it doesnt smell chocolaty very much. has a bit of roasted character, but its relatively weak and not all that impressive.  T- heres a good smooth porter that reminds you of how porters came around. smooth light and clean. chocolatey malty body. not very strong flavor, but solid.  M- light body, light carbonation, pretty smooth all over, slightly creamy body  D- pretty good, idk a little underwhelmed, some of their other stuff is alot better. maybe im just spoiled by having had so much of black hawk porter and smoke on the porter recently",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Smoked Porter,89
147,90,Slatetank,4.03,"I picked this up at Thirsty's in York. Put part of the bottle in some burgers marinaded and grilled and reviewed the other portion. Poured chilled into a nonic.  A - Extremely dark brown or mahogany as the ink on the bottle states w/ a 2 finger band of khaki. The lace clings very well and the porter has a decent garnet amber hue  S - A carmel, toffee, roasted malt scent and dark cherry fruity ester w/ hints of coffee and mild cocoa w/ a fresh juicy hop aroma. The hop scent is both spicy and citrus tinged - a nice mellow toasted/smoked odor accents the roasted malt nose very nicely  M - A sweet feel w/ medium carbonation and bitterness w/ subtle smoky dry texture. The acidity from the hops balances the sweetness and adds complexity to the toasted rich and malty feel  T - Very well blended w/ dark malt thatt has a sweet and juicy taste w/ plum and stone fruit nutty caramel and spiced bread flavors. A light cocoa and smoked flavor adds to the malt roastiness w/ an adequate amount of intensity and flavor that keeps it interesting to the last sip.  D - I love the smoky taste that isn't overdone in this porter. The balance is unusual for Stone's ales, but a welcome trait w/ plenty of fresh hop flavor that lets you know it is a porter from southern California. Possibly in my top 5 Stone ales - I really love a little smokiness in the porter Top notch drinkability I could see myself drinking more of this as the weather gets cooler",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Smoked Porter,89
147,90,beveritt,4.1,"Presentation: Poured from a brown bomber into an Imperial pint glass. Label is classic silk-screened Stone. No visible freshness date.  Appearance: Pours with full five fingers of tan head that settles slowly to about 2.5 fingers. The beer itself is opaque, with just the barest hints of red around the edges.  Smell: Roasted barley aromas mix with bitter hops. Notes of bittersweet chocolate, coffee, and licorice.  Taste: Bittersweet chocolate hits you right upfront. This eases off to flavors of coffee and roasted barley. Mild hop bitterness in the finish, much less than expected from the smell. A long, lingering cocoa powder feeling and taste.  Mouthfeel: Carbonation is average. Body is unfortunately a little thin, contrary to what your taste buds are telling you.  Drinkability: Good looks and great taste on this one. A little disappointed in the body, but overall, a delicious, dessert like beer.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Smoked Porter,89
147,90,CrellMoset,3.85,"On tap at Mellow Mushroom in Charlottesville, VA. Served in a traditional American pint glass.  Appearance: A deep dirty brown, but with plenty of garnet hues poking through at the periphery. A light, fairly quickly fading latte colored head leaves some unimpressive lacing in its wake.  Aroma: Smoky, burnt toast, some lighter syrupy brown sugar notes, and a nice hop bouquet - some faint spicy floralness.  Taste: More dark toastyness with a few roasted astringencies coming through, some smooth but lightly bitter chocolate, a dry, grassy roasted coffee note and some light citrus, and a smoky feel and definite peaty, smoky aftertaste.  Mouthfeel: Full bodied, milky, and creamy. A very fine-bubbled mouth on this one makes for a very even feel.  Drinkability: Very drinkable, even if you don't like smoked beers (as I don't), because the ""smoked"" aspect of the Smoked Porter is not its most prominent constituent component - it's merely a nice addition to an already very balanced and drinkable porter. Alcohol is of course also not a factor here. Give it a shot.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Smoked Porter,89

147,90,Brew33,3.68,"Purchased a 22oz Bomber from Jungle Jim's in Cincy, OH.  I had read a lot of reviews on this beer so I had high expectations going in, and I ended up a little disappointed. This is a good beer don't get me wrong, but it isn't the big, thick, smokey Porter I had hoped for. The smoke aspect of this beer is very subtle. It has a slight smoke smell and a very slight smokey flavor. It is a decent porter, certainly not the best porter I've had. It is pretty thin too which was disappointing. I would drink it again, but not at the price tag I paid for it. Maybe it's better on tap.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Smoked Porter,89
147,90,Beefeater57,4.32,"A: I must have got a really carbonated bottle, because mine is really fizzy. Looks like cola. Black, appears opaque. Tan fizzy head.  S: Roasted malt, ash/smoke smell. Similar smell of a cigar, get a hint of licorice.  T: Wow, very good. Smooth, taste is different from the smell. Layers of different flavors - some bitter chocolate, some coffee, and I get a very slight hint of fruit, like cherry. The hops add a bitterness to it, but it isn't overwhelming at all. I like how the different flavors pop in and out on the tongue from sip through aftertaste.  M: Body is a little thin for a porter, but not bad. Very well carbonated.  O: Quite good. Complex, interesting, very delicious taste. Stone are masters at what they do.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Smoked Porter,89
147,90,Italianish,4.64,"I must admit, after drinking an Arogant Bastard Ale more than a few times, I was a bit skeptical about anything that came froma North San Diego Brewery. They all seem to have a very strong hoppy flaver with a lot of bite. I generally go for the darker more ""heady"" brews. I generally fall in love with about any beer that laces the glass. I cracked the lid and took a whiff. Damn it smelled good. I poured it into a tall Pyramid Hefeweizen Ale glass and marveled at how rich and dark it was. Upon taking a whiff, I was amazed at the nutty , oaky, chocolately flavour. No hoppy/bitter bite. Its somewhat comperable to a nice belgian ale. It pours smoothly. It has a nice thich head. And it is dark, not like the quadruple filtered watery beer we so often see at the supermarktet.  I would definately drink and recommend this beer to others. Sit back, relax, crack on open. I suggest that you drink it just above room temp.. I promise, there should be no naysayers on this one. Thanks for the time. Ciao",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Smoked Porter,89
147,90,GoodKnight1220,4,"Poured from a bottle into a glass.  This beer poured a deep dark brown and had a nice two finger tan head.  Smells of roasted coffee and a nutty malt.  Rich coffee right up front then fades to the sweet roast. This has some complex undertones that are hard to identify. I'm guessing that the smoked flavor.  Overall this is a good porter, worth trying and I would drink again.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Smoked Porter,89
147,90,pmcadamis,4.28,"A - A dense tan head of creamy foam sits solidly atop a pitch black brew that lets no light shine through it. Tons of silky lace is left on the glass, and the lasting power of the head is amazing.  S - Double chocolate chip cookies, oaky wood notes, charcoal, and some really nice ""autumn leaf"" hop aromas.  T - Woody and tight, with some sweet chocolate chip flavors behind the oily hops and bitter dark chocolate. This manages to remain snappy and hoppy enough to avoid over-taxing the tastebuds with burnt coffee and dark chocolate.  M - Medium bodied with silken carbonation and a bitter burnt finish to top things off.  D - This is a damn fine brew, but I guess I was expecting more complexity. Don't get me wrong, this is complex and tasty, just not to the extent that I was expecting based on the name and the hype.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Smoked Porter,89
147,90,kinger,3.72,"This beer is a bit of a puzzler, had some really great qualities and some fairly average ones as well. I will immediately skip to the overall because overall this is a nice porter and I got a lot of enjoyment out of it. Aroma is medium to mild with scents of chocolate and roasted goodness, it's just too mild to be given a higher score. Great pour one of the best I've seen from a porter. Rich and dark this is a looker good swirling tan head and loads of tacky lacing. Mouthfeel is nice and smooth but lacks a thick creaminess I like to find in a good porter, it does get better as it warms but still doesn't hit the right level. Flavor is real nice. I can smell a bit of the smoked flavor as I drink, my taste buds first pick up on some chocolate and caramel followed with a bitter coffee taste. The smokiness is mild and it hits the back of the throat on the way down leading to a great exhale. A stronger aroma and thicker mouthfeel and we would have a superior porter.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Smoked Porter,89
147,90,fitzy84,4.23,"The beer poured with a slight amber tone to a generally dark black appearance. Thick lacing on the sides and overall on the head. Great, literally, smoked aromas but mainly around chocolate, coffee, malt and yeast. Taste is a balanced sweetness with a burnt aspect to the flavors. Good, crisp mouthfeel aids in a refreshing carbonation and extenuating flavoring. Overall, very nice.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Smoked Porter,89
147,90,dancinwillie,4.28,"This one poured a very lovely reddish-brown with thick two finger tan head. the head drops to a scant covering after a few minutes, and leaves some nice lacing on the glass.  I notice a roasted quality in the aroma, as well as some light chocolate notes. I am not, however, picking up any smoked malt aroma.  First sip made me sit back and smile. More flavor than I expected, and there seems to be a lot going on. Definitely a roasted malt presence, with some of the bittersweet chocolate I picked up on in the nose. A faint coffee flavor in there too. I can also taste the smoked malt, but it is not overwhelming, and I would say very balanced. I also taste what I can only describe as a woody flavor, I don't know what that could be, but it is very faint, and doesn't seem out of place. A little hop presence rounds out the flavor somewhat, but this beer seems to lean a bit more in the other direction. Mouthfeel is smooth, a bit chewy, and somewhat thick. Overall I would love to drink this throughout an evening, and I will probably do just that in the future, so drinkability is going to be high for me.  Very tasty, and I am going to try Stone's recommendation for a sourdough bread, chunky-style all natural peanut butter, and blackberry preserves sandwich with this porter!",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Smoked Porter,89

Smells mildly of smoke. Tastes moderately of smoke and licorice. Despite the lack of head, there's a solid amount of carbonation in this.

S - Burnt alcohol, a little malt?  M - A little more ""watery"" than I've used to.  T - Wood, black cherry, burnt alcohol.

Definitely representing Stone quality before I can take my first sip.  Aromas are light. A little malt, bean, and smokiness come to mind.  Deep sensations of dark cocoa/chocolate and light coffee bean to the palate. The porter finishes with more of a bitter high-note and hair of that smokiness trailing. The creamy, delicious texture pairs well with the flavorful personality of the Smoked Porter.  The dancing carbonation paired with the brews creamy-smooth feel and intense flavor essentially block dopamine receptors in your brain.  I thought it would make for a nice dessert brew or paired with exotic chocolates.  Hail Stone Brew!",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Smoked Porter,89

By looks alone it may seem as scary as the gargoyle on the front of the bottle but upon first sip you realize that this brew may not be as aggressive as it seems. Although malty, the taste is a little on the bland side but that isn't a terrible thing. Because the taste is so acceptable it makes for a great mouthfeel. You don't ever get the urge to just drink this fast. This beer doesn't attack you, it's much more like a neutral country allowing the invading army to pass through to get to the real battles. Highly drinkable over a period of time and smokey enough to enjoy; the only downfall lies in the unexpected knockout punch that never comes. This is just another example of thinking your opponent hits harder than you do but comes up short.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Smoked Porter,89

T- While there wasn't much smoke in the aroma, it was strong in the taste. M- If I am getting that much smoke in the taste, I would like more malt body to bring it together.

Slight smokey smell at the back end.  T: Burnt flavors of coffee, dark chocolate, roasted malt, and darker flavors of licorice or almost a a tar flavor. Very bitter with a slight hint of smoke on the finish. Not nearly as smokey as I would have liked.  M: Heavy, oily and bitter. The flavors just linger on in your mouth but they are not all pleasant.  D: For me this was low. The heavy mouthfeel just starts to weigh on you by the end of the bottle and the bitterness just seems to take over. More bitter as it warms also.

Smell is creamy coffee, dark chocolate, caramel, burnt sugars, dark malts and a nice hint of hoppiness. Its a bit hard to separate out the smokiness as this one smells very rich and roasty, like a nice cup of coffee. That smoked malt smell is somewhere hidden in there but I can't seem to find it. Regardless, this is a great smelling porter.  First sip and the first thing I notice is how smooth this beer feels in my mouth. Its like iced coffee. Tastes of bitter chocolate, coffee (of course) and some smokiness definitely stands out but its in no way overpowering. Its actually quite a nice balance with the smokiness.

Chocolate, coffee, black licorice flavor. Roasted malt and of course the slight smoky flavor. I also noticed a slight spiciness.  Effervescent carbonation. Combination of the smokiness and hops lingers long after you've swallowed your most recent sip.  Very nice. Mouth feel is about right for a Porter and this is actually quite drinkable.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Smoked Porter,89
147,90,jbphoto88,3.88,"Dark beer. Almost black with tobacco mahogany highlights where the little bit of light sneaks through. Fluffy beige head rises above the brew for a short duration but fades to just a collar. It does leave light dots of webbing on the edges of the glass.  Smell is of moderately smoked sweet malts. They are hard to pick up but reveal themselves eventually.  Taste is very smooth, caramel based sweetness with a slick moderate smoked malt. Not as smoky as I was expecting based on the name but it is more apparent in the finish. The beer is slick, creamy and smooth on the palate and has a nice thick medium body. There are light notes of chocolate and coffee but very minimal.  This beer is smooth and easy to drink. It has a very glossy feel with low carbonation, mild flavors and almost no bitterness.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Smoked Porter,89
147,90,hopheadsal,3.88,"Poured very dark, with a decent head. Loved the ""smokey"" flavor and feel of the beer but i was a little disapointed with the nose...couldn't really smell the smoke.

147,90,pershan,4.3,"Had this on-tap at Frisco Grille in Columbia, MD.  The beer poured an inky-black with a thick, brown head into a pint glass. The aroma was of burnt wood (reminded me a bit of how my clothes smell after being around a campfire). The smoked malt was very evident in the first taste, with the roasted malt and burnt toast flavors evident as well. The smoked flavor complements the beer style very nicely, in my opinion.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Smoked Porter,89
147,90,Slynger,3.97,"Stone's Smoked Porter pours a deep brownish black with mahogany highlights near the bottom of the glass. Nicely sized light tan lid.  The nose has sweet chocolatey malts first and foremost with a dark roasted and nutty character, with hints of smokiness. Cherry liquorices comes out as it warms a bit.  The flavor has a nice balance and approachability to it. Soft chocolate and caramel flavors with un-intimidating amounts of black coffee, and a more pronounced smoke character than the nose.  I was thinking Stone would try to overpower me with this one, but they didn't. This was a tasty and well balanced porter with a fairly light smokiness to it. Come to think of it I kinda wish they did try to blow me away. Oh well, still a good beer, and maybe they will come out with an imperial version.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Smoked Porter,89
147,90,largadeer,4.03,"Appearance: From a 22 oz bomber to a Stone Ruination mug. Dark brown with reddish tints, just barely transparent when held up to the light. The tan-colored head shows no sign of going anywhere.  Smell: Mild smoke at the forefront, charred grains and coffee. The smoke aroma comes out more and more as it warms, though it never becomes dominant.  Taste & mouthfeel: Roasty and smoky with subtleties of coffee and burnt bread. Dry throughout - I can't pick up any sweetness whatsoever. The body is medium-full and chewy, moreso than the average American porter. The smoke flavor is plainly noticeable but nicely balanced; it blends nicely with the other flavors rather than dominating the palate. The finish remains dry, revealing a mild earthy hop note that pairs nicely with the smoky backbone.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Smoked Porter,89
147,90,scottbrew4u,4.17,"Poured from a 22oz. bomber I had resting in the cellar.  A: Pours very dark brown almost black with a pillowy light tan head. Can see some hints of light but otherwise opaque. Good lace clinging to the glass already.  S: Fresh, sweet roasted malt and toffee aroma real clean. Just a hint a smoke in there and a raisiny smell. Very aromatic malts with rich complexity. Notice a hint of fresh earthy hops as an accent.  T: Right off the start an abundant roasted malt sweetness that is so smooth and fresh tasting and not overly sweet. Some bitterness from burnt malts and hops gives this porter great balance. Malt flavors are a complex mix of charred meat, coffee, molasses, and licorice. The bitterness intensifies later on in the glass. The smoked malt flavor also becomes a bit more noticeable as this beer progresses.  M: A smooth, lightly carbonated, medium bodied porter that is spot on for the style.  D: Extremely drinkable porter right up there with some of the best I have ever tasted! Easy drinking and not too heavy to consume. Not sure it should be called a smoked porter though. Drink at cellar temperature for best flavor and it should pair well with a wide range of food styles.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Smoked Porter,89

S: Good roasted smell of a porter, but it does not have the smoked aroma that I was hoping for in this beer.  T: This is where the smoke comes into the beer, it is just great. Starting with a great porter then as this porter flavor transforms into an almost sweet smoky flavor. Ending in a slight bitterness that just rounds out the flavors.  M: Great feeling across the mouth, most noticed along the sides of the tounge as the beer passes through.

147,90,kimcgolf,3.28,"I just could not get as excited over this one as most people are. While the thiock body and rich tastes found in most Stone beers was present, the smoke overwhelmed all other scents and flavors. I did detect some chocolate and coffe in the nose and palate, but again, I had to fight through too much smoke to get there.  I would enjoy this beer much more as just a Porter, that hasn't been smoked,",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Smoked Porter,89
147,90,halfP1NT,3.53,"Reviewed this one on 5/12/08.  Appearance is opaque black with a thick, tan head. A slight hint of dark ruby comes through the bottom of the glass. Some nice, thick lacing is left behind.  Smell is roasted malts, as well as a smoky smell that almost reminds me of rubber. There is a hint of chocolate as well.  Taste is smoky, toasted malts; I still can't get past that rubbery presence in the taste, although it goes away as the beer warms, and it's replaced by pleasant, smooth, toasty malts. There's also a hint of anise as it warms. Nice hops presence to balance it all out.  Carbonation is low to medium. This was an interesting version of a porter. The smoky/toasted flavor does get a little bit overwhelming in my opinion, especially after my second glass, but this beer is worth a try.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Smoked Porter,89
147,90,detters,4.79,"Took me ages to breakdown and buy this one. Guess I was afraid to find a better porter than Edmund Fitzgerald. Pours a deep brown, which is always nice. Smells like mocha malts, which probably don't exist, but that's what I thought of. Tastes like coffee beer that is thick on the palate. Great mouthfeel, but after it's a little too thick and sticky, however this is far too fantastic to let something like that be irritating. Once again, well done Stone. Best porter I've had to date.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Smoked Porter,89
147,90,yourefragile,3.86,"22 oz bottle poured into a pint glass  A: Very dark, tawny brown color, clear ruby highlights against light. Giant tan head that hangs around for ever and leaves webs of thick lacing. S: Subtle smokey aroma, with malt and caramel notes. Becomes a lot more sweet and less smokey as it warms up. T: Sweet, chocolate and coffee malt, caramel, dark fruit flavors with a background of hop bitterness to balance the sweet. Not as much smoke flavor as expected. M: Medium bodied and full of flavor with mild carbonation. Slightly thin for this style for my linkig D: Excellent beer, not quite my favorite American porter, but definitely would have this again, especially at this price",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Smoked Porter,89
147,90,Offa,4.85,"This is a wonderful porter that is flavourful and has great body and character but is highly drinkable.  It's almost black, deep, reddish brown, with a big, dense, dark tan head and good lacing.  The taste is rich, deep, and complex, yet smooth. It has caramel, a nice coffee-chocolate quality and very faint hint of smokiness, giving a wonderful texture of sweetness and bitterness, with lasting, well-blended flavours. The feel is smooth, rich and a touch oily.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Smoked Porter,89
147,90,Monkeyknife,4,"Poured from the bottle a deep dark brown with orange hues and a thick and frothy off-white head.  Aroma of roasted malts, caramel, raisins and chocolate. I expected a lot of smoke but found none.  Tastes of sweet roasted malts, chocolate, dark ripe fruit, and vanilla. Aftertaste of subtle light smokiness.  Medium-to-thick mouthfeel, creamy, and lightly carbonated.  I'm a wimp when it comes to smokey beers but this one is my favorite. The smokiness is subtle and lets the other flavors and aroma shine through. Right up my alley. One to try and enjoy.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Smoked Porter,89
147,90,Exner83,2.96,"The best part's the appearance - it's beautiful. The consistency and mouth-feel are also top-notch per the style, but this one's got me pretty overwhelmed by a mad flavorlanche.  If Stone gave us Arrogant Bastard Ale, this one must be Pissed-Off Porter. Talk about a dark, smoky, estertastic bully slapping my girly mouth. I can't imagine drinking more than one.  I'm in no way objecting to the quality of this brew, though. The ingredients are there, the brewing's there - it's just a pumped up version of the style that's not my thing.

But the taste, that's where I picked up on the smokiness. The initial taste reminded me of some fine smoked bacon. Which, I will admit is a strange flavor to associate with beer, but it's one I like. I noticed a roasted malt flavor as the beer sat on my tongue. Easy drinking, and not very filling.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Smoked Porter,89
147,90,hwwty4,3.58,"Thanks to whoever gave me this beer. Stone isn't available in Missouri, so I know I revieved it in a trade. Unfortunatly I don't remember who sent it to me.  Poured this into my Val Dieu chalice. Poured a jet-black, very similar to Stones IRS but just a little less oily. Unfortunately this beer didn't pour much of head, mostly I think, because it was much cooler than it should have been. While it was pretty cold, the lacing lasted all the way down. ""Amazingly rich, dark and delicious yet this is our least understood beer."" This is off of the back of the bottle. Unfortunately, I have to disagree. While, I do agree with the dark and delicious part, I can't figure out while people wouldn't understand this beer. The only thing I don't get is why they would call this a ""Smoked Porter"". I couldn't find any smoke in this beer. The aroma is dark chocolate, a bit of coffee and apples. The taste follows suit with bitter, baker's chocolate and java. Still, there is absolutely no smoke involved in its flavor. I think the reason I like this beer is the lack of smoke flavoring. Really this beer tastes more like a thin double stout then a Smoked Porter. The mouthfeel is full; it is much thicker than most porters. I find this beer really drinkable. It's tasty and smooth but the one thing its not is Smoked. I think I would review this beer much higher if they would have left off the Smoked moniker.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Smoked Porter,89
147,90,brewandbbq,4.04,"Vintage 2004  Pours dark brown, almost black and opaque. Mahogany edging with a crimson hue. A humble half-inch head of beige retreated quickly to a partial coverage skim coat and a few dots of lacework.  Aromatics are surprisingly vineous. Bitter chocolate, red wine, scorched caramel bits, some dark fruit, and a smidge of smoldering embers. A hint of vanilla rounds out the bunch.  Thin mouthfeel. Slightly creamy with low carbonation.  Dark chocolate, deep roasted malts, espresso grounds and mild smoke on the pallet. All are quite balanced and the overall character is subdued and sessionesque. Finishes with some lingering caramel drizzeled dark malts.  While the four years in the cellar has brought a complexity to the nose, the body and pallet has faded.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Smoked Porter,89
147,90,Drewcifer,4.28,"Pours a very dark brown, bordering on black, with a slight reddish hue to it. Monstrous foamy off-white head, sticks around a while, good lacing.  Aroma is of roasted malts, the slightest hint of coffee, but not much else.  Flavor of mostly roasted malts, a little bit of cocoa, a little bit of coffee. Fairly mild cops, but they're definitely present. Well balanced.  Quite smooth, on the heavy side of medium, lower carbonation.  Overall, a very drinkable brew, a very good example of an American Porter. I was slightly disappointed in the overall lack of smokyness - if you're going to call it smoked porter, you damn well better have some smokyness about it - but that was set off by the all-around good qualities of the brew. Possibly my favorite American Porter so far.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Smoked Porter,89
147,90,AKBelgianBeast,3.71,"This is probably my least favorite stone brew. Pours a promising thick black with good off white head. Nose is strong, but I find not enough roasted malt, and very little smoke. Taste is ok, alot of that signature stone flavor, some very little roast, and very subtle smoke. hop bite on the finish is ok, maybe a bit strong for the style. Mouthfeel is pretty thin, and too dry. Drinkability is good. Overall this is an ok beer. Defenitely funky for a porter and quite soft for a smoked offering. I realize they intended for a subtle smoke, but it is the porter brew itself I find a bit off. a decent beer, but one I probably won't buy again. I love stone, their in my top ten breweries in the US, but i think they could have done better with this one.

Aroma of dark roasted malts, perhaps some chocolate, and the merest hint of smoke...  A plethora of tastes from this one... Earthy hops. Sweet chocolate malts, slight presence of coffee, some vanilla, and then the finish of wood smoke that is not overdone and is really nice...As this warmed, the dark fruit aspect mentioned on the bottle definitely took the stage. This reminds me a lot of their RIS, just not as creamy and rich. Very delicious...  This paired wonderfully with the Chicken Rotel the wifey cooked tonight... Went perfectly with the spicy jalapenos...  Highly recommended porter...",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Smoked Porter,89

Beer pours black with a two and a half finger head of tan foam that doesn't die for a good ten minutes. No viability, I can't see the strippers, erm.. the management through the beer.  Smell- Very little as this is served far too cold. Some hop and malt. Light smoke, nearly none. As it warms, still very little malt. Perhaps this has been sitting on the handle too long?  Taste- This is a porter for sure. Thick roasty mouthfeel with a big hop balance. Smokiness is subdued and nearly not present, but porter characteristics still persist. Not too terribly impressive though.  Mouthfeel- Strangely light mouthfeel with ample hop bitterness. Medium bodied and well carbonated.  Drinkability- When chugging, smoke actually shows up!

The mouthfeel is creamy and light.  It is a heavy beer, but it's really light in finish.  This is another solid offering by Stone. Not too much smoke, just enough to give a great layer of flavor.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Smoked Porter,89
147,90,tobyandgina,4.03,"The Smoked Porter head was average, light brown and lasting. Color was dark amber, reddish-brown. Body was pretty clear.  Aroma: Average to heavy malt presence with a toasted chocolate cereal. Some hops thrown in there. Some yeastiness, smoke and charcoal.  On the palate, there was medium body, creamy texture and soft carbonation.  The flavor tended to have an average duration, moderately sweet and moderately acidic.  Great on the list of Smoked Porters. Cheers!",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Smoked Porter,89
147,90,aquaderek,4.42,"Poured this beer from the bottle into my tasting glass....Dark, good 1.5"" head that dissipates to .5"" after a couple of minutes. The nose is initially you get the smokiness of the beer and deeper in you get the classic porter notes of mocha and fruit cake. If I were to mention smoked salmon, mocha, and fruit cake to someone, they would probably say yuck, but it really works in this beer. Pretty well balanced tasted, with a nice smoky and bitter type finish. The mouthfeel is big and creamy, very good. The drinkability is pretty good as the alcohol content isn't too strong.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Smoked Porter,89
147,90,Darien,3.9,"A-Nice dark, dark amber color when put up to a light, a little darker than other Porters I think, minimal head and lacing.  S-Subtle smoke aroma with sometype of fruitiness in there.  T-The taste didnt blow my mind or anything, about what I expected, you can taste the smokiness but its not overpowering, and maybe its just me but the alcohol seems to be more prevelant than I would like.  M-Thick and creamy  D-Easily a good drinkable beer, goes down pretty smooth and the palate is not overpowered by the smoke.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Smoked Porter,89
147,90,BretSikkink,3.95,"Pours an appropriately inky black. Head is strangely light colored for the style, a sort of mauve, and there's a lot of it. Good stick, but the cap doesn't retain terribly well.  Aroma and flavor of appropriate gravity; mainly sticking with roasted character and emphasizing the charred malt. There's less of it on the nose, but what's there is very pleasant.  The flavor is nicely fleshed out, but somehow just slightly thin, or lacking in something or another. Bitterness is just fine, finish is a little bit acrid, but you run that risk with a smoker.  Overall, a very standard smoked porter, above average for an American Porter. As usual with Stone, delightfully made and spot-on for style.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Smoked Porter,89
147,90,PhageLab,4,"I was pleased to find this on tap at the Tap House in Hampton, as it is one of the few ""regular"" Stone offerings I've never tried, along with the Levitation. Served in a standard pint glass.  A - Dark coloration, low bit of froth, decent retention, laced rather well.  S - Malty aroma, sweet and smokey.  T - Well they really did smoke this porter, it has some significant smoke characteristics that are damn tasty. Very well rounded, sweet dark malts with the signature bite of Stone hop content.  M - Medium body, low carbonation, smooth going down with a hoppy dry finish.  D - Pretty good overall, definitely more sessionable than most of Stone's offerings, and that's not a bad thing. Balanced and tasty brew, one that I will revisit and recommend.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Smoked Porter,89
147,90,baos,4.6,"On tap in pint glass.  A: Dark dark brown with 2 finger head and awesome lacing.  S: Coffee hardwood charcoal. Piney hops.  T: The pine resin orange rind hops mixed with the malts give this beer a mellow espresso flavor. End nice and dry. This beer is really good.  M: Medium to full bodied.  D: Rather stout, but still very drinkable. I had this with fried and breaded cube steak mashed potatoes and Cajun corn. Went awesome with this Southern fare. Almost perfect beer! drink it!",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Smoked Porter,89
147,90,milesfan76,4.26,"22 oz. bottle with the usual Stone gargoyle and writing about the beer on the back.  A: Pours black, though not pitch black, it does let a bit of light through. Two-finger tannish head that sticks around and clings.  S: Not much going here except for the malts, and not carrying that strongly.  T: Nice. Smoked malts come through first, with a bit of chocolate, coffee, and hops mixed in.  M: Medium-bodied, carbonation just right.  D: Very drinkable- I kind of wish I'd kept the whole bomber instead of splitting it.  Overall an excellent porter from a brewery that has yet to disappoint.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Smoked Porter,89
147,90,Faulconerbrewing,3.51,"Appearance: It poured a very dark brownish/black color that some reddish tints when held up to the light. A nice dark tan head formed and left a lace of foam on the glass.  Smell: As soon as I poured it into the glass, I could smell the smoked malt. That pretty much drowned everything else out and that was all I could smell. I might have served this beer a little too cold which would mask some of the flavors. I'll have to revisit this one.  Taste: The smoked malt was the most prevelant and obvious flavor given the name of the beer. I though Stone did a good job of still have the ""regular"" malt flavor come through and mix with the smoked, but the smoked flavor overpowered anything else.  Mouthfeel: The carbonation was the first thing that I noticed. It was very smooth and didn't overpower like i was expecting after the first sip. It was gone as quick as it came in.  Drinkability: Overall, I think this is a good beer. Something I'll probably keep in my fridge, but possibly in small quantities. The smoked flavor started to bother me a little towards the end of the beer. I think I could enjoy one or two of these in a session and then have to move on. I started to think about an odd analogy for this...so here it is...but i warned you, it's odd. It's like when you meet this hot girl who smokes. The sex will probably be great, but she'll taste like an ashtray...I guess you have to take the good with the bad. Hey....at least you got laid!! :-)",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Smoked Porter,89
147,90,aromatorio,4.17,"Bottle purchased from La Jolla BevMo. Poured into the trusty ole Guinness shaker pint (someone buy me a tulip).  A: Looks black. Only when held directly up to light can you see subtle shades of ruby peering through the glass. Lovely big head foams up, sticks around for the duration as more than adequate lacing.  S: I am going to avoid the typical ""smokey smell"" diatribe. It does smell good though. A little vanilla, a lot of coffee, maybe some smooth caramel too.  T: A tangy bit more bittersweet than I anticipated. Sits well on the tongue however, and by the end is more smooth by half.  M: A little more carbonated/bubbly on the tongue than I would have preferred. Doesn't detract too much from an otherwise excellent porter though.  D: Could easily finish a bomber myself. *hic* Absurdly low ABV compared to some of the monsters I've had recently.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Smoked Porter,89

A - deep dark, nearly opaque, amber color with a thick foamy head that settles somewhat but is otherwise well retained; leaves a nice lacing also  S - smokey, chocolately grain scents dominate the aroma, almost no hops present, very clean  T - like the aroma, rich roasted and smoked grain character with chocolate and 'camp-fire' like notes; nearly no hops present, but finishes somewhat dry and nicely balanced  M - medium-light body with moderate carbonation  D - This is a really good smoked porter.

147,90,Jmamay22,4.15,"Pours with a coke colored head that retains well and leaves some occasional lacing. The beer itself move from a dark black approaching brown to a lighter caramel colored brown along the sides of my glass.  Smells of caramel, dark fruits and a well placed smokiness. The smoke doesn't overwhelm like a Rauchbier, but complements and blends in with the other tones.  Tastes of chocolate, which gives way to a drying smoky finish. It's difficult to say where the smoke flavor ends and the hops begin as they meld seamlessly in the aftertaste.  Mouthfeel comes off a little thin and watery. Somewhat lifeless compared to the beer itself. This a very drinkable and unique porter. After the initial glass new flavors and subtleties continue to emerge. The smoke flavor is not the centerpiece, but acts as a complement to a fine porter.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Smoked Porter,89
147,90,zymurgy4all,4.82,"This is a must try. I've only had a few smoked beers, and this one was one of the best so far. It was a dark color as expected from a porter, and a nice rich roasted and smoky flavor that was simply terrific. The flavor was incredible. You could eat this with cheese, sausage, smoked oysters, steak, and it will just compliment it perfectly. It has a nice smoke flavor that is not just a hint, and not overdone--it was perfectly in balance with the hops and alcohol. The mouthfeel was smooth. I liked this beer so much, I even bought a stone smoked porter glass. This is one I will eventually try and replicate as a homebrewer.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Smoked Porter,89
147,90,becktone,4.28,"Eye: Extremely dark brown in color, the highlights that I can see are a russet color, very brown, dark brown red. Head retention is great, it is tan in color and is also creamy in appearance. What can I say, this beer looks good.  Nose: Very potent aroma, right off the bat an astringent black malt and smokey aroma fill the nostrils. In addition to the smoked aroma there is also a very earthy smell to it, much like mulch.  Tongue: Smoke flavor is forefront, and then some chocolate in the back behind that. There is a bitter flavor that lingers on the front of the tongue, which is odd because the tip of the tongue usually picks up sweet flavors. Seems to me to be a hop taste, perhaps its here because the smokey flavor is domination the back sides of the tongue where bitterness is usually picked up. I also get some dark fruits in the taste, slightly behind the chocolate flavor. Also some caramel mingled in there...in the midst of the smokey character. Quite a complex beer, lots of flavor in here. HA usually stone hops the shit out of beer(which I happen to love), well when they have a style that does not lend itself well to hops they just do something else, ie the smoke character. This is an extreme beer, made for those who love extreme beer.  Mouthfeel and Drinkability: The beer has a full body, though in my opinion it could be a bit smoother. Higher levels of carbonation lend a rough character to this beer in terms of feel, maybe it would be better if those levels were lower? I can see it pairing much better with a silk pie were they lower, I mean two products both extremely smooth on the palate? it don't get much better than that. This is a beer that I think that I'd have to be in the mood for to buy again, I can really only see drinking on bomber, more than that and it might just be to overwhelming.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Smoked Porter,89

147,90,trentley87,4.13,"Poured from the 22 oz. bottle into a pint glass.  A: Very deep, almost black mahogany with a long lasting creamy tan head. Head was only about 1 finger thick but my friend dropped the bottle and loosened the cap a little so I lost some carbonation. Good lacing.  S: I am a little stuffy but smell is pleasant with smoky chocolate, coffee, and the slightest hint of black licorice.  T: Dark roasted bitterness. Coffee and chocolate flavors under a mask of smoke. Tastes more like a stout. Has a creamy sweetness that, when combined with the mouthfeel, reminds me of Left Hand Milk Stout for some reason. Very good.  M: Excellent. Fairly light-bodied without being watery and carbonation is perfect. Smooth and refreshing.  D: Very high for me. Offers the complex flavors of a good stout without being thick or overly filling. I love stouts in the winter but this is very satisfying and a nice change. I will purchase this beer again.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Smoked Porter,89

147,90,iconoklaztor,3.9,"Poured into Das Boot! This beer generated a massive head (probably because of Das Boot)! The head remains quite awhile. The color of the liquid is a nice rich, dark brown. The smell as you can imagine is a Smokey, woodsy nose. The taste is nice and Smokey as you might guess. It starts with a nice porter note then an onslaught of Smokey flavors hits the tip of the tongue. The mouthfeel is robust and dry. Its a nice drinkable beer but I could see it leaving many thirsty!

147,90,crashoveride,4.68,"I drank this beer at a brew pub in Easton, Pa called Which Brew. Since porters are what I drink, this beer was right up my alley. I never had this beer before and I must say the taste to me is very inviting, it was smooth to start with a slight bite at the finish. I enjoyed this beer with dessert and went very well with chocolate drizzled cheesecake. I liked the beer so much that I went and purchased it at my local beer distributor. It came in a case of 12- 22 0z. bottles which will last me one long weekend. The 22 0z. bottles is a lot of beer but the beer is so smooth it makes it easy to drink. I also recommend having this beer with a nice T-bone steak and some chocolate fondue for dessert.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Smoked Porter,89

Growler opened with a pop and a rush and left some specks of porter on my kitchen ceiling (guess it's fresh :) Poured the color of obsidian, followed by a luscious coffee colored two-fingered head that settled into a quarter-inch consistent layer of foam and ringlets. Lots and lots of lacing; just like drinking a coffee milkshake. Scent of hops, roasted malt and espresso, as well as a lingering smokiness in the nose. Nice mellow taste - unsweetened cocoa, coffee and malt with a slightly hoppy finish. Nice medium-bodied mouthfeel; not too much carbonation. Very sessionable porter.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Smoked Porter,89

Copped a 1pint, 6floz bomber from Total Wine and More in West Orange... one of my favorite brews from Stone... Pours an ebony hue with a dark, tan, frothy head that soon dissipated... aroma was not too apparent, although cocoa and espresso smells were noticeable... flavor is what it was all about with this one... rich, thick, roasted-malt, dark-chocolate taste with a nutty, latte like characteristic... good, solid mouthfeel with excellent drinkability make this a terrific sample and a pleasure to drink... went down very smooth without any bitterness detected... the relatively modest 5.9% ABV also helps with the overall drinkability... great stuff from Stone... Definitely recommended...",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Smoked Porter,89
147,90,svcbeerguy,4,"From a 22 oz bomber purchased at Mr. Bones in Greensburg.  Pours a near black with an off-white head that has decent retentions. Lacing appears along the the glass and lingers well.  Smell of roasted malts comes through immediately. coffee and some chocolate is also there. Hops give the beer a slight floral aroma. Smokiness is barely detectable through smell.  Tastes of dark coffee with a slightly bitter finish. There is just the right amount of hops in this one. The smoke flavor is not distracting as in other brews and compliments this version of porter very well.  Mouthfeel is excellent. Medium bodied with not too much carbonation. This brew clings to the palate just long enough to get the right amount of smokiness and malts.  At 5.9% abv, this is one of the more sessionable Stone offerings I have had. I could easily have a couple of these with no problems. This would be a good beer to pair with smoked meats and game. This is a natural choice for when I am in the mood for something other than a hop bomb.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Smoked Porter,89

Lacing was what I expected, as it stuck all the way down the glass.  S - Pretty average I must admit, caramel malts with not a much smokey as I expected. I had to double check the bottle to see if it was a smoked porter, but it was nicely balanced.  T/M - Malty up front with hints of floral hops as it finished. Not too heavy and a bit sweet initially. Smooth finish with nice carbonation, but kinda struck me as average...  D - Overall a very good porter, just not as smokey as I'd a liked.

147,90,CAMRAhardliner,4.25,"$4.69 at Premier Gourmet in Buffalo.  It pours near black with a few amber glints. The head is small and shortlived but leaves a decent amount of lace behind. The aroma is on the grainy side with some modest dark chocolate and black malt flavors. A subtle smokey feel ads a subtle complexity. The taste reveals dark Belgian chocolate with caramel and cookie dough mixed with a light citrusy hop character. The smoke flavor is light but always noticeable. It mingles with the hefty dark malt and roasted barley flavors, adding an intriguing layer of complexity. The mouthfeel is medium and softly carbonated. Light hop bitterness and a roasty, smokey feel last a while in the finish.  This is a great porter. While relatively light in body, it has loads of different flavors that make every sip novel. Try it if you like porters/stouts.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Smoked Porter,89
147,90,BeerImmediately,4.54,"Deep amber reddish hue surrounds the black color. Tan, somewhat creamy one-finger head, which quickly dissipated.  Absolutely wonderful smell - sweet caramel was the first thing I noticed, followed by black licorice, and as it warmed, noted the charred, smokey wood.  Definite coffee flavor - some hints of irish coffee, with a light smokey aftertaste and a little cherry bite as it warmed.  So smooth, with just the right amount of carbonation. Slight smokey aftertaste on the tongue.  This beer was incredibly drinkable.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Smoked Porter,89
147,90,goodmaml,3.98,"Stone's description of deep mahogany is pretty accurate. Short, but beautifully brown, medium density head. The nose is very pleasant, primarily a faint licorice smell, perhaps a hint of oak. Mouthfeel is not at all bad, but maybe just a touch watery. No one pervasive taste. Nice, muted malt sweetness balances with a similarly muted hop bitterness. It finishes dry and the bitterness persists. I don't get the chocolate or smoked character that is expected. Easy drinking at 5.9%. Everything combines for an outstanding session beer.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Smoked Porter,89
147,90,jeonseh,3.85,"Got this from a 22 oz bomber.  A- comes out essentially just as the bottle said it would and really a pretty porter. Dark, opaque black in the middle with a bit of cherry red highlights on the side and the bottom. A big old frothy, thick cream colored head that rests on top and leaves lacing down the glass. Rather nice to taste.  S - Rather fragrant; pick up notes of coffee mainly with a light hint of chocolate as well. Also, may sound odd but it actually reminds me of beef jerky's odor, which is probably imparted from the smokiness.  T- Can definitely taste some kind of wood smoked through this one as it hits the mouth. Also, kinda sweet as well; mostly molasses coming through and a hint of chocolate as well; also hints of blackberries I would say. Not as coffee tasting as it smells but the smokiness was really a nice attraction that I was not expecting. When I first put it to me lips, I was taken aback because I did not expect it to be as smoky as it was. Not much of an aftertaste really at all and think this has to do with the wateriness of the beer. The more I drink this, the more the water seems to dominate and temper the flavor.  M - Kinda watery in the mouth and little carbonation in this one. At the end there is a little bit of body coming through but on the whole thought this was rather thin. Wish it had some more ummph to it actually. This wateriness actually detracted from the taste in my opinion and stops this from being one amazing brew.  D - an accessible porter that is easy to drink a lot of. Have to like a smoky flavor to like this though would be my only thing. The thinness of the body makes it easy to drink and it is easy to find and not too expensive as it was 5 bucks, which is not too bad for the bomber. I think if it were thicker I would change from a beer that I would buy just to drink and session to one that I would pick to sip and enjoy while reading a book.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Smoked Porter,89

It smells primarily of vanilla and caramel. I was expecting it to smell astringent and smokey, but it did not. Not a bad thing.  T: it tastes really, really good. Roasted malts are in evidence, but Stone Smoked Porter thankfully avoids the usaul pitfalls of a porter by replacing the played-out coffee flavor with ripe dark berry tones. I'm surprised and a little disappointed by the lack of smokiness in this beer. There is a slight smoky finish, that tastes a little leathery, but it's fairly subdued. All the same, this is a very solid porter.  M: Mouthfeel is exceptionally creamy. Full-bodied and smooth.  D: Sure, I could enjoy a few of these.

147,90,AlephNull,4.18,"Yay! Stone just came to Delaware, so I get a chance to try a few after my initial brush with the Oaked Arrogant Bastard.  A: Pours from the 22oz bomber into my SA pint glass (Thanks BA and Sam!) with 3 fingers of thick, bubbly offwhite head. The body is a dark almost black brown but when held to the light, you can see it's not cloudy, just dark.  S: Unfortunatly, I think I might be coming down with a cold, because the scents are a little bit muted. What I get is a sweet slightly carmelly smoked malt scent with just a bit of floral hops for good measure.  T: Sweet smoked malts -- molasses in character, but not in sweetness come to the forefront at first. The finish is a bit sweeter but the smoke taste gets stronger at the end. The hops give it a slightly citrusy flavor and round this beer out quite well. While they're there, the coffee notes are very subtle and not nearly as strong as I expected.  M: A fairly light body -- this actually disappoints me a bit. No negative characters, but I like my porters to have a bit more body to them. Incredibly smooth with a light to moderate carbonation. Good, but not what was expected.  D: Well, I'd have to say this is a wonderfully drinkable beer.

This is not like the rauchbiere I expected. The smoke is a subtle addition, not the focus.  M: Mildly carbonated. Very good mouthfeel.  D: Absoulutely fantastic.

Keeps you company throughout the entire experience and leaves some serious lacing. Chocolate and caramel are evident on the nose, both burnt. Decidedly malty. A little on the weak side, especially at first. Taste is a robust combination of coffee, coal, cocoa, and caramel, which provides great alliteration. A little on the thin side, though still medium bodied and lightly carbonated. With such a low ABV and great taste, this makes for a great session beer.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Smoked Porter,89
147,90,dnichols,4.48,"I poured a 22 ounce capped bottle into a pint glass.  A: It poured a dense dark black body with a rich sticky abundant head that retained well and laced the side of the glass.  S: It had the distinct aroma of burnt malts, dark molasses and toasted brown sugar with hints of coffee. There is also the clear and consuming odor of smoke...it reminded me of when I first open a bag of hard timber charcoal.  T: There is an initial flavor of burnt sweet malts and molasses followed by bitter chocolate and coffee with a ever present taste of charcole. True to the style this brew stands tall and delivers a wonderful smoky porter that is a joy to consume.  M: It is medium bodied with moderate carbonation and a smoothness that makes each sip a joy from the tip of the tongue to the back of the throat. It has a nice clean finish that leaves a desire for the next sip.  D: The moderate body, balance of flavors and modest ABV make this a wonderful session brew.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Smoked Porter,89
147,90,RblWthACoz,3.88,"Mmmm. A nice and long lasting flow over the palate. The tones are even and it leaves a long taste in your mouth. I have saved trying a lot of the Stone productions in order to build up my palate, but I have to say that I am satisfied with this one beyond what I had expected. I have tried others with stronger flavors, so this wont be an all time favorite, but my opinion of it will always remain high.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Smoked Porter,89
147,90,ralree,3.91,"A: Deep black and opaque, nice tan foamy 2-finger head. Great head retention and great lacing. Beautiful.  S: String smoky and slightly skunky flavor. Sweet caramel malt, and fine flowering hops permeate well.  T: Strong smoky flavor with a good bitter hop flavor underneath. Malt isn't quite as sweet as I like it, making this beer a little bland. Dark chocolate and a little bit of coffee are also present.  M: Pretty oily, good carbonation, medium-heavy bodied, non-astringent. Not bad, but not great.  D: Drinks alright - it's pretty heavy.

Intriguing.  Moderate dark bread aroma with a light tinge of resin. I pull a bit of burlap frm it as well, but it fits. Many if these scents come through in the taste, but also add in there semi sweet chocolate and a distinct maltiness. I think it is officially my favorite porter, now.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Smoked Porter,89
147,90,penguinjive7,4.47,"This brew pours a dark, almost black color with a band of light tan head. Lacing retains somewhat but is not significant.  The smell is of smoke and semi-sweet chocolate.  The first taste to hit the tongue is the smokiness followed immediately by the nicely roasted malt. A hint of dark chocolate can be tasted as well. The finish is a very roasted flavor with a hint of charcoal. An excellent blend in the finish.  The carbonation is done very well and complements the brew's viscocity.  A fine tasting brew that all could drink all night. Extremely drinkable and proves to be yet another astounding offering from Stone.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Smoked Porter,89
147,90,younger35,4.45,"My buddy picked up a bomber of this tonight and we enjoyed it while he cooked dinner. Drank from my Squatters nonic pint glass.  Appearance- Pours a dark brown with light amber highlights around the edges. Beautiful one finger dark tan head that slowly recedes leaving a superb cap and collar for the duration of the beer. Plenty of thin splotchy lacing to go around. Smell- Nice smoky nose that is a bit more pronounced than the Alder in Alaskan Smoked Porter, peat perhaps? A bit of sweet milk chocolate and highly creamed coffee round out the nose beautifully. Taste- Lightly smoked body is very delicate and blends well with the semi bitter, semi sweet chocolate. Feint notes of coffee make an appearance but for the most part the smokiness is the center of attention. Nice warm roast is present from the malt with a hint of citrus. Finishes with a lingering smoke and the slightest of bitterness. Mouthfeel- Silky smooth with a medium body and perfect medium carbonation. Drinkability- I just ate about sixteen pounds of sweet chili hot wings and this thing is the perfect desert. The light smokiness with the chocolate background makes this a really good Smoked Porter. Its only a step behind the Alaskan Smoked Porter but the availability of this compared to ASP is fantastic. A solid, solid brew from Stone.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Smoked Porter,89
147,90,Iceman77,3.83,"Pours a very dark brown with an off-white, latte colored head. Good thickness on the head and hangs around a while before receding to a nice surface film and lacing around the edges. The name is in the smell and taste, up front you get the smoky malt aroma along with a hint of citrus and roasted nuts. In the taste you get more heavy malt flavor, along with chocolate and smidge of hop bitterness. Nice texture in the mouth, with the right amount of carbonation and a slight aftertaste of those smoky/roasted grains. Definitely the kind of porter you could have several of with ease.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Smoked Porter,89

T- Tastes of smoke and licorice, but not as smoky as some rauchbiers. Finishes with a decent dry, hop finish.  M- Nice full mouthfeel, full body, well carbonated.  D- More drinkable than many smoked beers, although I am a fan of rauchbier.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Smoked Porter,89
147,90,Thanby,4.42,"Pours an extremely dark amber, just a hair off of black. One finger of rocky tan head, some visible active carbonation. Nice sheet of clingy lace, even though the head dies to a ring.  Smells of smoky roasted malts and chocolate, a little orange, a little nutty.  Smokiness right up front. Oak (I think) roasted malt. Very mellow but flavorful. Slightly bitter smoky aftertaste.  Medium body, good amount of carbonation, just a hint of citrus. Chocolate permeates the whole flavor in a very subtle way. Easily drinkable, and very enjoyable. Simply a pleasure to drink.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Smoked Porter,89
147,90,bobbyc881,4.33,"Pours out dark brown, tan head. Red highlights. Thin carbonation. Aromas of chocolate, leather, smoke & slight burnt sugar.  Taste begins a touch sweet and quickly turns into a nice, round smoke flavor. Reminds me of cooking ribs on a summer afternoon. Not overpoweringly smoky, though. Finish ends dry, with lingering smoke flavors -- but not a I-just-smoked-a-cigarette taste.  Mouthfeel is moderately thick, creamy and leaves my tongue a bit sticky. Extremely drinkable. Smoke seems to be one of those flavors introduced into a beer that can go horribly wrong. Stone has struck a really nice balance here that enhances the beer. A solid brew -- surely not a novelty.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Smoked Porter,89

147,90,bunnyhustle,3.77,"I have to say this is only my second Smoked Porter and my first was Alaskan, this is definitly not as good but still a good offering. Pours the darkest brown I've seen, just shy of black. A small tan head formed but it didnt last long and no lacing either. Smell is of some sweets, some caramel, but mainly that of a smoked meat or fish. Taste is good. The taste is a complex blend of the actual smoke flavor, some malt hints, some of coffee, a bit of malt and small touch of bittering hops. It does have a slightly heavy mouthfeel and leaves behind a rather thick and almost oily aftertaste that I wasnt fond of. Overall an easily drinkable beer, light on the ABV and best at a warmer temp. A good offering from Stone.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Smoked Porter,89
147,90,Doomcifer,4,"Very dark pour, when held up to light it reveals mahogany hues. Nice off-white head that stays in it for the long haul. Great lacing, decorating the glass with each sip.

Notes of hops and a little spice, too. Very nice, sweet.  T - Tastes a little like a cherry smoked piece of beef. Heavy chocolate and malt flavors. Not too much alcohol--sweet. A little coffee flavor too. Quite complex.  M - A little thin, but not bad. Not as good as the smell and the taste.  D - I'm drinking the 1pint&6oz bottle, which is the perfect amount of this beer.

Aroma is sweet, toasty, bittersweet chocolate, milk, lactose, molasses and some kind of berries. tastes delightful in an easy going porter kind of way. Flavors match above but blend real well together then all into a roasty bitter finish which smooths out in waves. Feels smooth and easy but almost too delicate for the flavor. Body could be a little larger. Very easy to drink however. Goes down effortlessly.  Porter good.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Smoked Porter,89

Medium body with a lingering dryness.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Smoked Porter,89
147,90,LumpyGuitar,4.08,"I picked up one of the 1 pint 6fl oz. bottles from my local variety beer store, price was pretty decent.  Bottle looks cool, and it's nice that Stone has suggestions on the bottle of what to place it with.  I poured this into a stoneware mug as I had nothing else handy at the time, but the first thing I noticed was the color. Very dark, almost a mix between a brown and a red. Carbonation was about middle of the road and fairly clear. Head was tan, fairly foamy at first, but dissapated over a few minutes.  Smell was a tad bit smokey with a bit of earth and malt. Made my mouth water a bit.  Initial taste was sharp and although it smoothed a bit it retained a that bit of sharp flavor. I paired this with chicken wings and a meatball sub and it went great with the wings, not so much with the sub.  Mouthfeel was nice, felt a bit thick but not grainy.  Overall drinkability for me is a 4, this was a good beer and I'll definately buy some more, however, I'll remember to keep pairing this with wings and other grilled/baked meats.  If you've got a cook-out or something similiar coming up, even just a family barbecue, treat yourself and pick this up.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Smoked Porter,89

Chocolate, dark malts, caramel, and some smokiness on the nose, the type of beer you can't wait to drink after you get a wiff of it.  There was a higher acidity on the palate than I had assumed their would be, but that made it all the better as a food beer. This really rocked with my Braised Pork Shank. chocolate flavor, a little smokey, not nearly as smokey as I would have imagined, with a some light earthy hop flavors. Medium / fully body, chewy and round in the mouth, light carbonation.  Super drinkable beer and was an absolute delight with my meal!

147,90,altgeeky1,3.36,"22 oz bottle comes painted directly on the glass, which has to be a considerable expense compared to laminate or paper labels. Unusual in that respect, I had high expectations somewhere in the realm of Samuel Smith products.  Bottle opened at 58F, served in a standard pint glass. Very dark, almost opaque, and not a lot of pour head at first but settles down to a decent remainder head level.  Smells malty chocolate. I double checked the label, it did say smoked porter.. hmm. Expecting a smoked porter but found no such aroma, was disappointed in that regard. Not much aroma hops.  Tastes as it smells: chocolate malty porter, not too sweet or heavy, hops are there but not heavy, and lacking much in the way of smoke. I will add that the taste of this beer IS good. If this were my creation, I would have got some feedback before choosing the name before painting the bottles. [grin]. Not much body hops, or if they are there they take a back seat to the chocolate finish. Well balanced. Tastes better as it gets warmer ~60 to 65F.  Mouthfeel is great for the style, a well bodied beer that is not as filling as it looks.  Drinkability is excellent despite the small negatives. This would be a good gateway beer for someone trying darker sweeter beers, or as a session beer.

147,90,CortexBomb,3.38,"Jet black on the pour, huge off white head on top, impressive looking. The smell is rausch-like, clear smoked malty notes.  The flavour on this is lightly roasted, and chocolatey for a porter, with a vague smoky tone in the background. Not as much smoke as I was expecting, but all told it's a tasty porter, though without the smoke hint to add some zing it would not be above average.  The mouthfeel, decent. It's moderately full bodied. The drinkability, nothing particularly special. For a smoked beer it's easy to drink, but that's only because the smoke isn't overly aggressive here.  The bottom line: Don't buy one of these expecting Rausch Porter, because you'll be disappointed. Stone has crafted a fairly average porter, and then added a hint of smoke to it. The end result is drinkable, tasty, and probably would make a damn fine pairing with some BBQ ribs, but it's not going to blow you away.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Smoked Porter,89
147,90,aerozeppl,3.09,From 22oz bomber into a pint glass.  A: Standard porter. Tons of lack of light passing through. Fairly thin head without the typical mocha color you want to see  S: I was really looking for a smoked smell here but instead I got a lot of malt. There is a slight smoked smell but it is very faint for the style.  T: Again I was expecting more of a smoked taste but instead got a fairly generic porter.  M: Medium body. Something is off here with the carbonation. It is not a matter of too much or too little but that it just doesn't seem right. Really hard to explain this one.  D: For a porter it really is fairly drinkable. Ive been on a heavy beer kick as of late and this is probably the only one that is remotely sessionable.  $5 for the bomber.,Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Smoked Porter,89

If this was a beer from The Joe Schmo Brewing Company I would look at it differently, but's it's from Stone which usually stands for alot. I was expecting two things here, smoke and/ or porter. This beer does not deliver better than half on either point. It's weak smoke flavor attached to a weak porter flavor, with very little mouth feel (for me the test of a really good beer....that it does not taste watery going in). It's the first lawnmower smoked porter I've had. A good beer but not great as it should be.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Smoked Porter,89
147,90,tommy78,3.43,"Out of a bottle, the beer's appearance was very dark with minimal head. The aroma consisted of malts of the chocolate variety. I really couldn't smell a smoked aroma to the beer. The taste was surprisingly bland for a porter. I did not detect any smoked flavors. It did have a decent hop to it, but nothing out of the ordinary. As for the drinkability, given that is essentially vague, one could have three of these beers before realizing it was time to move on. In my opinion, the beer got better and better as I got deeper into the bottle. I wouldn't seek this beer out, but if it was offered to me, I would not turn it down.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Smoked Porter,89
147,90,BeerBelcher,3.3,"I thought this was a decent tasting beer and a good porter, but pretty marginal in its smoked component compared to other smoked porter's I've had (Alaskan) or rachbiers.  This beer poured a slightly thick black, with a pretty abundant off-white head. Aroma was pretty minimal, but offered up some nice chocolate malt (burned pizza crust) roastiness. Flavor was decently roasty, but not very smokey to my palate (although other folks I split the bottle with disagreed). Mouthfeel was unremarkable.  Not a bad beer, but I wasn't hugely impressed by it. Definitely recommended though.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Smoked Porter,89

Some smokiness is in there as well. Dark roasty hops with a little bit of a hint of smoked flavor. Full bodied with good carbonation, the dark malts linger for a while after each sip. Maybe a little bit of hop bitterness can be detected at the end.  I found this one to be only slightly above average. Of course, that doesn't mean it's a bad beer, it's just nothing special, plus a hint of smokiness. Just recommended.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Smoked Porter,89

M- Not as thick as I was expecting given the color. Just the right combination of bite to it to leave a pleasant feeling.

As I drink this, the only thing I can hear on the news is about the fires that are raging in San Diego, and I feel a horrible sense of irony at the realization that I am drinking the Smoked Porter. Ugghhh. I hope everyone is okay out there. I am keeping my fingers crossed for everyone at Stone.  Poured a bomber into a pint glass.  Appearance - Poured an almost opaque black - it is translucent around the edges of the glass. It produced a fairly quickly dissipating 1-finger off-white head.  Smell - Smoky. It also has notes of chocolate, coffee, American Spirit Perique tobacco, roasted nuts, toffee or burnt sugar. Very interesting smell.  Taste - Wow. This is really good. I can taste everything that was included in the scent: smoke, chocolate, coffee, tobacco, roasted nuts, toffee, and burnt sugar. Since I read the bottle, I can also pick up on the anise and dark fruit.  Mouthfeel - Thinner than it looks. The brew is light to medium bodied. Velvet smooth, and goes down really easy.  Drinkability - This beer is ridiculously drinkable. The flavor, low ABV, and mouthfeel combine to make this a really easy drinking beer.  This isn't my favorite offering from Stone, but it is still better than a lot of beers on the market. If they sold this in Texas, I would certainly pick it up again.

S- dark chocolate and dried fruit, fig, currant, tobacco, huge roasted malt, give it a swirl again and i get smoky roasted coffee bean, nuts, burnt caramel, cigar smoke and wood ash.  T- initially a smoky bitter burnt wood raisin-prune taste, then cocoa coffee dark malt, the dark fruit becomes tart making a nice intro for some earthy woodsy hops and burnt caramel backed up by another puff of cigar-ish smoke for a malty charcoal aftertaste.  * with determination, i found some black licorice flavors like the label suggested hidden behind the smoky malt. it was right in with the dark fruit, but it was more like a jagermeister anise herbal type taste, very delicate, and it goes great with the smoky cocoa tobacco.  MF- chewy in the mouth but velvety smooth goin down, medium carbonation tingles become creamy. sits rather light in the belly despite its seemingly thick texture.

S - Chocolate, raisins, hops and alcohol. The chocolatey malt aroma is most prevalent, mixing with notes of coffee and caramel. There are also some dark fruit aromas, figs and raisins, which meld nicely with the spicy hop notes.  T - The smoke comes in just as it hits the tongue. The roasty, smoked, slightly sour flavor dominates the palate. Hops appear in the middle, but don't overpower. The finish is smoke, charcoal, and tobacco that slowly merge into the essence of very dark chocolate.  M - Moderate body and carbonation (thinner than I expected, but I am not complaining as it helps the drinkability.  D - This beer is a feast of complex, dark flavors. The best aspect of this brew is the way the flavors merge in a long, drawn-out finish with a beautiful chocolate character.

Head fizzles down to a skim, with a ring around the edge of the glass.  Banana esters in the aroma, bready dark malt like a Doppelbock. No perceptible smokiness that I can smell.  Very malty flavor, very mild hint at smoke, with slight banana from the yeast coming through at the end. Mildly sweet with a mild astringency.

A pretty pronounced hop flavor but still takes a backseat to the maltiness of the brew. The feel is well bodied and smooth, finishes bitter. A good rich porter, with excellent chocolate flaovrs.

While my mission was to come back with a cross sample of fine Michigan beer, the Gargoyle caught my eye and I couldn't resist adding this to the haul.  Poured black in the glass, quite opaque actually. Tan head was a solid finger with moderate retention and good lacing. Smelled of biscotti, milk chocolate, toffee, almonds. I found the taste quite agreeable, mocha and chocoate predominant with mild bitterness in the finish. The mouthfeel is silky and smooth, well balanced with a light body.

147,90,Stoneman78,4.73,"It's funny to officially review a beer I have had many times before, Smoked Porter is one of Stone's core lineup (joining AB, IPA, and Pale Ale as the original year-round offerings). Here goes. . . A- Pours an opaque black with tinges of dark brown highlights, head is big, thick, foamy and tan, big thick lacing throughout... superb S- Aroma is dominated by a mix of chocolate and coffee malts, wonderfully balanced with a hint of good old Stone hops in the background, smoked hues abound along with some woody/cedar/roasty tones T- Initial taste is rich and creamy coffee-forward malts backed by some cocoa tones all dominated by that wonderful smoky presence, some dark fruits (fig, plum) come in soon followed by a slight bitter hoppiness which characterizes the short, sweet finish M- Fairly medium-bodied porter, very creamy mouthfeel and a perfect amount of carbonation D- Easy drinking porter at 6% with very well-masked alcohol presence, easily a session beer that is wonderfully delicious and complex. I am not a huge porter fan, but Stone Smoked Porter is simply the best of this category and one of the top beers I have ever reviewed, do not hesitate to have several bottles readily available for BBQ or meat-intensive dinners, and be sure to grab the special Porter with chipotle peppers whenever it is available at Stone. . .

First up is a quick little bite followed by a roasted malt middle. Slightly bitter chocolate notes in the finish along with some hints of burnt toast and hop tinges.  Mouth feel is quite good. A good robust porter but not over the top in its' chewiness. Very drinkable for the style but not on my list of sessionable porters despite it being a damn good straight up porter with a nice little twist.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Smoked Porter,89
147,90,Brad007,4.7,Pours a reddish brown color witha nice brown head. Aroma is nice and creamy with some subtle smokiness. Taste is nice and smoky with a good balance of malts as well. I can even detect some burnt coffee flavors towards the back of the throat. The aftertaste is dry and smoky as well. Very drinkable and would compliment certain foods well. I love this beer.,Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Smoked Porter,89
147,90,OKCNittany,4.01,"A: Near black body. Two finger tan head with very good retention and lacing.  S: Very smoky aroma, but little else comes through.  T: Chocolate and coffee flavors abound - along with the sense that this was brewed in a smokehouse.  M: Low to medium carbonation. Not quite full bodied. Pleasant lasting aftertaste.  D: Despite the strong flavor & substantial body, it's very drinkable - sessionable even (if only I'd have been smart enough to buy more).  Not my favorite porter, but a darn fine offering & one I'll be happy to go back to - on the rare occasion I can find it.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Smoked Porter,89
147,90,Trueant1,4.46,"Poured into my Anchor Liberty Ale glass.  Pours a classic 1.5 inch off wite head that is thick and billowing. Leaves a complete lacing on the side of the glass. How could this look any more classic?  Smells of alcohol and toasty malts. After that, a bisqut like smell. Some sweetness. Where is the ""smoke'?  AHhhh...I can taste the smoke...hence it's name. Bitter..very bitter for a porter. Yummy. Sweet light chocolate on the gulp. Alcohol and hop bitterness on the aftertaste.  Perfect amout of carbonation. Perfect creaminess. Smooth tasty porter. Sweet and bitter. I have had much THICKER porters...but this one works for me!  I love this brewery. I love this beer . I have had this one about 30 times before...This is my first rating of it.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Smoked Porter,89
147,90,ArrogantB,2.83,"On tap at the brewery after the tour. I have had this before but this one had more flavor. Dark black with a cocoa head. Smells smoky. This just tastes way too smoky for me, I wonder how they get the smoke flavor?? My cousin's exact words were :""You can't hide behind your IPA forever!"". Needless to say the Stone employees did not take a liking to us. I bet this would be better with the chipotle peppers or vanilla beans to temper that smokiness.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Smoked Porter,89
147,90,beerN3RD,3.76,"Got this on tap at the Yardhouse in San Diego, CA. Was served with a rootbeer like color and head. Head was a tan wheat color. Darker than most heads I've seen. The body of the beer is a pitch brown color with mahogany undertones. Smells were a nutty, yeasty brew, not bad, fits for this beer. Alcoholic notes as well. Taste was with nice campfire flavors burnt and roasted barley. Definately a dry one, like licking the ash off a burnt coal. Drinkability is fair on this one, nothing to write home about, but would definately order again.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Smoked Porter,89
147,90,cswhitehorse,3.88,The smoked porter comes in a dark bottle with no freshness date. It pours a hazy dark hue with very little foamy head. The smell is unique and has a nice roastiness and smoky hint to it. The flavor of the beer is nice and smooth and in the mouth is quite chewy. This is a bold and strong porter but well done.,Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Smoked Porter,89
147,90,Ungespundet,3.52,Thanks to Hotterthanhell for this bottle...This one is a great intro Bier for non-smokers...  Pours up a fine bubbled head that drops too quick back into the deep brown/blackisch elixir thats shows hints orange around the corners of the glass. The aroma features a nice mellow smoke aroma with roasted sweet malts in the background. The hops are nice and provide an earthy touch. I did find the smoke aroma to be a bit medicinal...  The hops are earthy and come as strong as the smoke in the flavor. The roast malts are sharp and matched well with chocolate malts. The dark malts do provide a lingering bitterness. This Bier for me is somewhat stout-like due to the roast..Definatley a Robust Porter if a to be called a Porter. The mouthfeel is silky smooth and nice. Nice try by this brewery and a nice intro Bier for non-smokers. I'll stick to the Bamberg Biers...  Zum Wohl,Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Smoked Porter,89
147,90,pwoods,3.5,"22oz. Bomber from Party Source poured into a pint glass.  A: 2finger+ Tan head. Good retention and lacing. Pours pitch black letting no light through.  S: Actually kinda citrusy. Some plum/fig notes. Nice and sweet smelling smoke. Reminds me of my smoker filled with hardwood chips soaked in cider.  T/M: BIG smokey malts! Hops are there but are mostly dominated by the smoke. Tasty but probably a little extreme for me. More dark fruits add a touch of sweetness. Body isn't nearly as heavy as I had thought it to be. Getting some slight sourness at the finish.  D: As I said before, it's probably a little too extreme yet for me but I can appreciate it for what it is. Would work good sipping during a winter movie night. This bomber will be enough. I'll try this again around jan. 2009 and see what I think then.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Smoked Porter,89
147,90,benito,2.98,"Stone's contribution to the world of extreme, or rather, offbeat porters is near-black in color with a creamy, off-white head. There are muted aromas of chocolate, cinnamon, and pepper. This is an extremely dry and bitter porter, with little malt sweetness to match the hop presence and dry, smokiness. The smoke flavors, though advertised as central, are really only second thoughts--complements to an otherwise typical robust porter. I could have handled more smoke, more sweetness, and more pronounced aromas all around.  I love the mouthfeel of this brew: it is dry, powerful, and heavy--something that really lives up to the 'robust' moniker. Unfortunately, the sacrifice for such a palate-challenging brew comes in drinkability. It's for sipping, remote from the industrial, quaffable origins of this style.  Overall, this is a tasty, spicy porter that is most notable for its rough-textured mouthfeel and lack of drinkability. If you want a really ""smoky"" porter, stick with something else (Left Hand's Smokejumper comes to mind).",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Smoked Porter,89
147,90,dfried,4,"Pretty black in color with some red, yellowish, and brown highlights, 1cm light coco colored head. Chocolaty aroma, charred grains with some underlying smokiness and jerky notes. The smokiness stays quite subdued upfront but lingers noteably in the aftertaste. An overall chocolaty porter, with some charred grain and coffee notes, which pairs well with the light smokiness and keeps it quite drinkable. Medium bodied, slightly dry sticky mouthfeel.  Overall: every smoked beer I have had has been super meaty, peaty, and almost jerky like, and this was way different than that. The smokiness stays in the background and just adds some complexity, I thought it was more porter than smoked porter. That said its pretty damn good, and way more drinkable than the other smoked beers I have had.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Smoked Porter,89
147,90,TheBierBand,4.3,"OK.... I am probably prejudiced.... because I've LOVED every Stone Brew I've tried.... but here goes:  I poured the 22 oz Bomber into a pint glass. It was a bit of a 'hard"" pour that resulted in a 2-1/2"" head of tan goodness. The beer is ebony in color.... no light shone through when held to the light.  The head diminished slowly and left behind lot's of clumpy lacing on the glass.  The smell was full of sweet caramel and dark chocolate.  The taste: mmmm.... goodness in a bottle... the first thing that hits me is the smokey taste... I can see why this is a SMOKED PORTER.... it tastes like a campfire thats been smoldering for a week! The dark chocolate pokes through as well as the expresso coffee. The finish is a bit fruity.... wow.... very complex!  Mouthfeel: nicely carbonated.... great mouth coating and aftertaste.  Drinkability: If I had more, I would drink more... but, alas.... the Bomber is gone.... Oh to live in San Diego.... I would have this alot! Highly recommended.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Smoked Porter,89
147,90,franksnbeans,4.15,"Pours almost black with a ruby hue. 3 fingers of light chocolate milk head with an aggressive pour that holds then dies to a ring. Smells of chocolate and a little caramel with a hint of smokiness. Tastes as it smells, subtle but delightful flavors and even an ever so slight hoppiness. Medium, creamy and smooth as silk in the mouth with a slight carbonation tickle. Drinks like a session beer and delightfully so.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Smoked Porter,89
147,90,atsprings,4.82,"Pours an almost opaque deep dark brown almost black with a frothy dark tan head that slowly diminishes to a thin layer and leaves decent lacing on the glass. The aroma was of smoked malt, burnt espresso and molasses. The taste is a wonderful blend of smoke, black malt, espresso, molasses, and a hint of dried fruits, wonderfully complex and not at all overbearing. The mouthfeel is a near perfect light medium bodied with low carbonation. This beer is the almost perfect accent to a chilly rainy evening.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Smoked Porter,89
147,90,Mdog,4,"Appearance: Dark brown, nice foamy head.  Smell: Sweet, smoky, maybe a little alcohol?  Taste: The initial tastes are of slightly smoky BBQ sauce, kind of hickory brown sugar. Later on, a little chocolate and coffee notes show up.  Drinkability: If it was available in MN I would probably have it fairly often. Reasonably priced and tasty.  I had this on a recent trip to Indiana. I have had this beer before, but didn't remember much about it. I was hoping for a little more smoked flavor but this was still a tasty brew.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Smoked Porter,89
147,90,beeritron,4.68,"This is a great beer. I hadn't had it in a long time, but decided to have a short affair with it tonight. Poured out of the bottle a deep chocolate color, erring on the side of a reddish, black appearance. It foamed up with a beautiful tan head that lingered around .5-1 inch for half of the quaff. The smell reminded me of fresh caramel followed by a hint of smokiness. The taste was definitely smoky with a taste of bitterness reminiscent of dark chocolate. This bitter sweet character was carried through to the end of the swallow which left the palate with a pleasant, bittersweet aftertaste that makes a man not want to brush at night. The drinkability is good, but after more than one of these, you may find yourself searching for something that doesn't make chest hair grow quite as fast.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Smoked Porter,89

147,90,Overlord,3.88,"Looks, and tastes, delicious.  Black, nice leathery head. Huge shots of espresso/coffee and chocolate round out a decidedly robust mouthfeel. Highly carbonated for a porter. Smell is (not a surprise) definitely robust coffee with bitter chocolate. One could hope for a bit more vanilla or fruit to round it out, but still excellent.  Very choice.  **this beer hasn't lived up to my original score after repeat tastings. Knocking it down just a tad. A bit one note for me, at this point.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Smoked Porter,89
147,90,sacrelicio,4.2,"This beer is fantastic. It pours black with ruby highlights showing when held to the light. Head is small, minimal lacing.

The taste is fantastically complex, with meaty smoke flavors, herbal bitter hoppiness, coffee, chocolate, cream, sharp cheeses, nuts, etc. Damn this gots the complexity goin on.

Pours black with ruby highlights and about two fingers worth of tan head that leaves behind gobs of lacing. Smells pleasantly roasty and lightly smoky with some chocolate. Tastes much like the smell; smokiness dominates while roasted malts and chocolate provide a solid backbone. The smokiness dominates initially but slowly yields to a roasty flavor that itself dominates by the finish. Good mouthfeel, medium body, moderate carbonation. Drinkability is good, I feel the smokiness builds and may be a bit overpowering after a few. This beer is a good, solid beer that I'd certainly recommend.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Smoked Porter,89
147,90,Floydster,3.78,"Pint from Naja's Place  Very dark with a small head for a porter, tastes better when it is not so cold  Nice bite to it after the swallow  Goes very good with desseet, similar to a stout, which surprised me, this is not case for most porters  Really want to try the brandy barrel aged if they ever have it at Stone again",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Smoked Porter,89
147,90,PittBeerGirl,4.38,"Split a 22 oz. bottle of this with my dad-we both liked it.  A- Deep brown body with thick, smooth and creamy dark tan head. Head has good retention and leaves behind plenty of lacing in the glass. Vibrant-bright red tone can be seen throughout the body when held up to the light.  S- Lots of chocolate malt, toffee, and some vanilla. Nothing overpowering and a nice balance between them.  T- Robust chocolate malt upfront with lots of toffee and hop flavor in the background. Lots of vanilla comes out for the finish along with plenty of chocolate malt and some bitter coffee taste. Both chocolate malt and a subtle vanilla sweetness linger.  D- Medium to low carbonation and medium weight body. Smooth and creamy. Near perfect for a porter.  D- This stuff is good. Probably my favorite porter. Has the big robust taste of a stout but the smooth drinkability of a porter. One I will definitely have again. Nice job by Stone.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Smoked Porter,89
147,90,Atlas1,3.85,"Time to check another one of the Stone creations off my list.  Poured from the bottle into a belgian snifter, the Smoked Porter is a dark brown color, with nice tan head that leaves minimal lace. It's deep brown in color, but does exhibit some shades of red and dark orange at the edges when held up to the light. Nice looking, but nothing exceptional. The aroma is rich and malty, but less smoky than I would have imagined given the beer's name. It's a nutty aroma with some smoke present, but not as pronounced as I thought it might be. Still, it's a nice porter nose. The taste is rich and nutty as well, with a bitter chocolate/coffee finish. The smoke really emerges in the aftertaste; even more so as the beer warms up to room temperature. It's a mild smokiness, but very evident, and very tasty. Smooth, silky mouthfeel keeps things moving along nicely.  This is an entirely drinkable porter. If the title of the beer scares you off, or if you're not a fan of smoked beers, don't worry - this is not as smoky as you might think. It's a mild smokiness, evened out by a firm malt presence and nutty/coffee/chocolate flavors. It's a good beer, all around.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Smoked Porter,89

147,90,macster,3.78,"Pours out an almost opaque dark brown, close to black color. Creates a thick, dense and creamy tan head with excellent retention and a bit of lacing.  Smokey aromas were somewhat muted and tame. Notes of charred oak, chocolate, coffee, dark roasted malts and vanilla come through.   Mouthfeel was moderately light and fluffy with a mild carbonation.   Taste profile was a bit more assertive than the aromas revealing more of the charred wood and smoke characteristics expected. A nice balance noted between the smokey tones and the chocolate/coffee flavors from the dark roasted malts along with just a touch of hops.  Finish seemed a touch astringent for a brief second or two, but if youre in the mood for a smoked dark ale this is a solid choice.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Smoked Porter,89

On to the beer:  I poured this into a hefeweizen glass and got a black figure inside the glass, with the color fading on the edges of the glass. My mom actually asked me if I needed a fork to consume this beer! Yes, it's a rich porter with esters, a touch of chocolate, roasted flavors, and charcoal smoke. It was lighter than I was expecting in the mouth, and firm. The smoke can sometimes become too monotone, driving down the drinkability a bit. Delicious stuff.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Smoked Porter,89
147,90,berserker256,3.23,"It poured into the glass the color of of coffee with a thick light tan head. I was expecting a bit more of a smell. I guess seeing that it's a smoked porter I was expecting a campfire or jerky aroma. I didn't really pick up any of that at all. The taste didn't hit me as smokey either. Just kind of an average to decent porter. I couldn't really detect chocolate, licorice, coffee, smoke, or any of that other crap the bottle had promised. Just a decent dark beer with a minute bitter aftertaste and low carbonation. Maybe it was sitting on the store shelf for a while or something. I've had a smoked bock before that reeked of smoke flavor in the past. I figured this beer would be similar. It wasn't even close.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Smoked Porter,89

Sticky lacing develops as beer is quaffed.  S: Not the type of nose I have come to expect from Stone offerings. Roasty aroma is surprisingly weak. Weak smoke aroma as well. Malt character is quite grainy. Some muted hop aroma.  T: Well balanced between lightly burnt/roasty and smokey sweet malt and good bittering hop flavor. It's a pretty strong flavor profile.  MF: Medium-light body - pretty light for a porter. Moderate carbonation. Slight warming and slightly astringent.  D/Overall Impression: Definitely an easy drinking sessionable porter.

The head disappeared quickly and there was no head to speak of. Did I mention stout-like darkness?  S: Smelled great, chocolate and coffee, just like I love.  T: I liked it, but not as strong as I thought. I loved the smoked taste. There was the heavy presence of chocolate and mild coffee, but I was surprised that it didn't have the alcohol that I expected from Stone. I loved the smokey aftertaste which made up for the lack of bite that I thought was going to be there.  M: I love the Stone beers and I usually associate them with ""strong"" beers, but this wasn't as heavy as their other beers. Not acidic, which I like, not to many alcohol tones.  D: I actually believe this could be a beer that I would have a few of at say,,,, a cookout, but the price tag is steep to be a session beer. I payed $4.99 for the 22 OZ, so at most I would have two in one sitting.  bottom line: Its better than average, great aftertaste, needs more alcohol/hop presence, but overall I enjoyed it despite the price.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Smoked Porter,89

Some chocolate and a slight smoky smell. I was also picking up a slight metallic smell that wasn't too pleasant.  First thing I notice with the taste is of an American drip style coffee. Some peatyness. Bitter chocolate, almost baker's, and a smoky finish.  Mouthfeel is great. Nice creaminess and a good moderate level of carbonation. A bomber was definitely easy to get down.

Smells hopped up and inviting however it doesnt nearly smell like i would expect for how dark it looks. Although the smell was mild, the taste is smoky and reminescant of burnt hops. Very tasty. It has a fairly thick mouthfeel and seems to be carbonated just the right amount, enough to give it a good consictency but not be distracting.

Lots of carbonation rising to the top to feed the foam.  S: Very strong chocolate malty aroma. The smokiness is not quite as strong as expected, but it is there.  T: Up front smokiness is lovely, followed quickly by a dark chocolate flavor. The two really play off each other, never letting one dominate the other.  M: Very creamy and smooth, leaves a nice sharp malt flavor on the tongue after. Chocolate hangs around the mouth afterwards.

For some reason, I've never had their smoked porter, so I was eager to check it out. Over all, it's a good brew, a little lighter than I thought it would be, but a good brew. The smoke flavor is very light, I think the first thing I noticed about it was the strong hop flavor for a porter. I guess Stone just can't resist hops.

The taste was the best part, because the smokiness wasn't overpowering. It was very subtle, which made this beer a nice addition to a meal.

Scent is vaguely smoky with a little malt sweetness. Not a ton going on but not bad.  Rich, malty porter with a wonderfully smoky/chocolaty interplay. Smoke flavor is controlled and not huge unlike the ridiculous (but amazing) Alaskan Smoked Porter.

147,90,PEBKAC,4.07,"Rib night... mmm mmm. :)  Pours black with just a tint. Obsidian in color really. A light Ovaltine colored head with not much to it.  Rich raisiny scent, cheap milk chocolate. Wait a sec, let me break out the Raisinets. Chomp chomp chomp. :D  Hmmm, strange combination of dusty coffee grinds pureed & mixed into a batch of sugar-free hot chocolate. Maybe a little vanilla hiding in the background, but mostly just the first two offerings with a pinch of salt. Reminds me of weekends at Grandma's house. Grandma is getting senile, so whenever she decided to make hot chocolate, she blanks out half way, & forgets to add any sugar. She doesn't even measure, she just drops the entire 3lb block into the kettle & starts watching novellas in the other room. :)  Back on topic, the porter has a cream soda mouthfeel, slightly drying. There's almost the illusion of it being uneven. You can't feel it, but it reminds me of mixing up Country Time lemonade & having little bits of powder float through your teeth. They melt on contact, but you swore they were there. Gives it a stronger body then I would have otherwise rated it.  Drinking a bomber is pretty easy whether you have food or not. The scent initially warns of a strong, heavy beer, but that is so not the case.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Smoked Porter,89
147,90,wagenvolks,4.42,"one pint sixer  Out comes a coffee-black body, opaque but with some amber creeping in along the sides. The head is decently thick for a stout, cola-colored, and leaves some nice lacing. Caramel & hops pervade the aroma, along with some amazing choco-coffee malts. Extrordinarily well balanced, plus some grainy oats and barley too.  This beer is tasty. Smoke eludes the aroma, but pulls through on the flavor, especially as it warms. A hoppy pine note pairs well with mocha malts and a biscuity grain presence. Mouthfeel has a surprisingly hoppy bitterness. I was anticipating a coffee bite, but it works for here despite the style. A bit thin bodied, though. Overall, its an amazingly strong offer from Stone--as expected. For only $3.50 at Bode's in Abiquiu, New Mexico, it fits the bill. Pick one up.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Smoked Porter,89
147,90,scott,4.38,"V.07 Dark pour with amber highlights complimented by the attractive full head of tight bubbles that have some hang time. Well carbonated. Bread/smoke/molasses for aromatics, that transfer to the tongue. Creamy, full-bodied & rich with almost a green apple lurking in the background that finishes quite clean. An easy drinker that you pull & gulp. I appreciate the subtle complexities that keep revealing a very well structured (not overly robust, not too smoked) offering. Highly recommended.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Smoked Porter,89
147,90,letsgopens,3.9,"Deep dark brown, nearly black with a thick tan head that hold very well and a bit of lace. Plenty of small rising bubbles.  The aroma is malty and smoky with earthy hints of coffee and chocolate. Pleasing and well pronounced.  Flavors include a rich smokiness with notes of Dutch Cocoa and a mild sweetness: molasses, brown sugar. Robust, deep, and oak-like. The unique smokiness is reminiscent of mescal (I have no idea why).  The mouthfeel is rich and smooth but not thick in texture. The finish has a tightly carbonated cleanness. This porter has a relatively low abv of roughly 6% but the drinkability suffers do to the fact that the characteristic smokiness becomes a bit monotonous before the bottle is gone.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Smoked Porter,89
147,90,TurdFurgison,4.03,"Stone is always dependable. I first tried this on tap, and remembered the smell as being more smoky. But now that I'm drinking from the bottle, there's not so much. The aroma is more chocolate and roast malt, with some smoke flavor only showing up with the aftertaste. The appearance is really good too, dark black with mahogany edges, milk chocolate colored frothy head. Nice beer, nice brewery.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Smoked Porter,89
147,90,dickieb,3.68,"Poors a real dark brown, with a finger and a 1/2 of toffee head. Smells of toffy and smoked malts. The taste is a bit light for me, i kinda expected a bigger flavor, a nice smokey taste sticks out in the end. no offensive taste, so still pretty good. Due to the light flavor this is pretty drinkable. Not the best stone beer or porter i have had, but still worth a try",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Smoked Porter,89
147,90,Backer2004,3.68,"Thanks to Kevin for letting me try this out at the Carolina Brewmasters annual Memorial Day BBQ. Enjoyed with some incredible pulled pork that complemented this style.  Tan head and much darker color than regular porters. Chocolate and caramel malt smells. So far so good. Howver, the flavor was too astringent and burnt for my tastebuds. Too difficult to finish a bottle of this. Will try in colder climate conditions.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Smoked Porter,89

S- Malty aroma, balanced by some roasted grains, smoked meat, peat, alcohol, faint hops, and a hint of sweetness.  T- Slightly sweet and malty, but more on the side of dark roasted grains and peat, with a very slightly hoppy finish.  M- Medium high carbonation with a smooth, medium body and a fairly dry finish.  D- Due to the fairly balanced taste, this is quite drinkable. Delicious, even.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Smoked Porter,89
147,90,walshclimb,4.42,"Pours rich dark brown to black with thin tan head that leaves a light lace. The head eventually dissipates almost entirely. Smells of roasted/smoked malts with a hint of coffee. Initially smokey malt flavor is nicely balanced with hop bitterness and a medium-lived slightly bitter aftertaste. Full-bodied, smooth, and slightly creamy with slightly alcoholic finish and good carbonation. This is a very tasty beer, and I will definitely buy it again.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Smoked Porter,89
147,90,Kendo,4.08,"A: Poured into a pint glass. Body is dark brown, real close to black, with a 1/2 inch chocolate milk-colored head that settled pretty quickly, leaving occasional lacing on the way down.  S: Roasted malt, some faint smells of chocolate and just a hint of charcoal or maybe burnt coffee.  T: All malt-type flavors up front: roasted malt, chocolate, charcoal and some coffee. It finishes with a fairly dry, coffee-like bitterness. It becomes even more chocolatey and sweet as it warms.  M: Appropriately carbonated for the style (i.e., a little bit less carbonated than your average beer), with a slightly heavier than medium body. Pretty creamy and smooth.  D: Good. Went down pretty easily as I was grilling sausage and peppers and onions. As a result, I only had about 10 oz left to pair with dinner.  Notes: This one sat in my cellar for awhile. Can't say just how long exactly (I need to do a better job with my inventory control system), but I'm guessing it may have been a year or even longer. I may get a fresher one soon just for comparison's sake, but this seems to have held up pretty well.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Smoked Porter,89
147,90,HoustonTX,3.73,"Very dark brown with a nice frothy off-white color head.  Smells of sweet dark malt with a touch of roastiness and plenty of pleasant smoke.  Mid-bodied, with a creamy and elegant mouthfeel. Almost light for a Porter. Very neutral beer in terms of sweet and bitter. A very mild roasty sweetness provides the upfront layering of the beer. Soon the mild sweetness fades, and provides a much stronger smoke flavor. Distinct and covers the whole palate in a drench of rich smokiness. Finishes with a mouth coating sticky disintegrating smoke note.  Lick your chops good. Another solid offering from Stone. I think this would pair excellently with many types of food, especially barbecue.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Smoked Porter,89
147,90,ChainGangGuy,4.22,"Appearance: Dark brown body with a light tan-colored, creamy head.  Smell: What's in that aroma... let's call it ""excitement""! Lightly sweetened cocoa and coffee amidst the rich, smokey overtones.  Taste: More of that semi-sweet chocolate and coffee from the nose, and, of course, the smoke, but also just a hint of citrus on the finish. Though the flavors run a bit thin at times, its still pretty pleasant.  Mouthfeel: Medium-bodied. Mild carbonation. Slighty creamy.  Drinkability: Reasonably smoked, it gives you just enough of that smoke you want without ever becoming overpowering or life-threatening.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Smoked Porter,89
147,90,mobud,3.83,"poured into pint glass from bomber.  A- Dark as night. Nice foamy head; oatmeal in color.  S- Slight hop, but more to the smoke side.  T- Good balance. The smoke malt taste is to the front with aslight hop underpinning.  M- More to the heavy side. Smoke taste remains in the aftertaste. Not alot of bitter burn feel that most smoked porter have.  D- This beer was good to try, but I will not go crazy seeking it out. Like all Stone beers, it is alittle different than the style that you are trying. I would like to try this beer ontap to give it another shot.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Smoked Porter,89
147,90,wcudwight,4.3,"Thanks to Enola for sharing. Pours an ebony color and shows dark brown around the edges. 1/2"" mocha colored head recedes to a lace that wraps around the glass. Aroma is of smoke, charcoal and pipe tobacco. This beer has a heavier dark chocolate and roasted coffee flavor. The smoke kind of lingers in the background but plays it's role well. Full bodied, slick and smooth as silk mouthfeel. I normally can't drink a bomber by myself in one sitting. I could easily finish a bomber of this. Another awsome beer from Stone.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Smoked Porter,89
147,90,Enola,3.65,"Received this via trade, not sure whom now. Possibly Solomon420.  The beer is a nice deep ruby color with a good sized head. The smell is smoke and there is a slight bit more hoppiness that typical of the style. The smokiness is not as evident as others of the style I have. There is also a hint of chocolate malt. The mouthfeel is good but there is just a slight chemical like aftertaste. Overall, a rich beer that is a nice treat.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Smoked Porter,89
147,90,Bitterbill,3.88,"Purchased from Wilbur's Liquors in Ft Collins  This pours from 22oz bottle(room temp) a very dark brown with reddish hues. There's a huge billowy offwhite head of foam that shrinks down to a solid layer and stays for the entire session.  The smell I'm getting is chocolate and roasted malt .  The taste on first sip is very chocolaty with good roasted malt flavour and a touch of coffee. Initially, I thought it was going to lean towards the sweet side but the roasted malt bitterness gives it a good dry taste.  Further sips in and I can taste *some* smoke but it's lightly done and it really meshes well with the other flavours and makes it quite smooth and quite drinkable.  The body is medium, the carbonation is on the light side and the finish, for me, ends on a somewhat semi sweet note. Very nice.  Bottom line: This is quite different from Alaskan Brewery's interpretation of a Smoked Porter, which is much more vigorously smokeie, but it's also quite good. I recommend it!",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Smoked Porter,89
147,90,MICAMD,3.73,"A- Pours a very dark black/ deep red. A foamy off white head forms and takes a while to settle. Kind of reminds me of a thick soda head.  S- Cinnamon, some sweet malt, a little smokiness. Slightly meaty.  T- Smokey, meaty, molasses. Sweet. A little different for a porter.  M- The carbonation level is perfect in this. Not too cloying but a little too sweet for my tastes.  D- A worthwhile beer from Stone. Interesting. It must be the smoky character, but I kept imagining myself using this as a marinade for some steaks.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Smoked Porter,89

The smell is of sweet dark bread and mild smoky grains.  The taste is mildly smoky, quite pleasant, rich and sweet. Nice notes of chocolate dark bread and some plum.  The mouthfeel is nice smooth with a mild carbonation, very nice for the style. The body is fuller then most porters.

147,90,edskirk3,3.39,"I had this on tap two weeks ago and loved it. When I saw a bottle of Stone Smoked Porter the other day I of course had to bring it home.  The familiar Stone bomber, to be enjoyed by 02/27/07. It is now 05/04/07. I'm sure it's still good...  I'm decanting into a faceted mug. It pours a little like syrup and is just this side of opaque. There's a few ruby highlights in there. Delicious-looking beige head. Nice and creamy. Has a little staying power. Aroma of coffee and cocoa powder. Let the imbibing begin...  Comes off a tad bitter, actually. As in coffee bitterness. Maybe I should pay attention to those freshness dates. It's not undrinkable, just... disappointing.  The coffee bitterness comes in right at tongue contact and lingers for a good while. I'm not picking up any smokiness. The roasted malts have become borderline astringent at this point. The mouthfeel, however, is still holding up. Full, creamy, sticky. Nourishing, in the same way as a Snickers bar. The back of the bottle suggests pairing with a peanut butter and jelly sandwich. I would totally do that if I had some peanut butter on hand, even with this less-than-fresh bottle.  I've come to have high expectations for Stone, and even if this one is post-dated, it's still good.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Smoked Porter,89

Starts chocolately, with lots of roasty coffee like flavors and finishes smokey. Mild spicy hop flavors are apparent on the sides of the tongue but are well hidden by the bolder flavors mentioned above. There is some mild tartness that lingers on the tongue for a while.  Medium bodied with a silky smooth mouthfeel. Light-medium carbonation tickles the tongue.  Overall a very tasty and drinkable porter. Could spend a Fall evening with a couple bottles of this.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Smoked Porter,89
147,90,tempest,3.91,"Definitely a step away from other porters, I might have even mistaken this for a stout, but taste is really what matters right? Not some silly style guideline. The beer was a bit heavy, but not syrupy like some big stouts, and tasted of dark cocoa, a bit of espresso, and smoke. The bitter bite was a perfect pair for my spicey turkey sandwich and the remaining beer after I finished my meal was a nice dessert.

147,90,allengarvin,4.35,"Dark brown color, topped with a tan head. Good roasted malt nose, though with only a faint smokiness. Nice flavor! Rich smoke dominates the taste, together with thick roasty malt and some hints of dark chocolate. Bitterness is on the low side of moderate, but the smokiness balances out any residual sweetness. Big, chewy mouthfeel.  Excellent smoked beer. Thanks to morris729 for supplying this.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Smoked Porter,89
147,90,geexploitation,3.98,"Pours a very deep brown, black in the middle, with an espresso foam head that sticks around quite nicely. The aroma is rich in a dark way, with notes of smoke mixing with chocolate and crystal malts. On the palate, smooth sweet malts first off, with restrained smokiness in the background. Well-rounded, earthy bitterness comes through at the mid-palate and mingles with bitter roasted malts and that smoky aspect; those elements compose the long, dry finish. Mouthfeel is a touch more thin than it could be, and quite rough moving over the mouth. Overall, this is a fine smoked porter, but it's missing that extra gear. Still very good.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Smoked Porter,89
147,90,FightingEntropy,4.5,"At first this beer seems a little light for a Smoked Porter or for being Stone, but it's more subtle than that. A thick brown-biege head floats for a while over top of a brown but not quite black body with ruby highlights. The nose has a sharp spicy hop, not fruit but lots of malt mingled. Definately lighter than a stout but still a almost chew, underattenuated mouthfeel--sweet and grainy. Chococlate and black licorice in the taste, sweet malt through, and then, hey, isn't this supposed to be a SMOKED porter, and there it is as the glass pulls away, the smoke wafts up through your mouth and nose. Light, clean, but assertive all at the same time and not overwhelming in any way. One of the best blended smoked tastes ever in a beer. Let it warm up a bit and then drink fast. Best part was in the middle between cold and a long sitting warm.  BA Reflection: Looking at other reviews, I seem to be on the high end compared to everyone else. I love Stone and that's part of it. I think they just fit who I am. But beyond that this is a beer to be appreciated for the subtle character of the smoke. It's not a rauchbier and it's not over the top, especially by Stone's standards, and I think some see that as a weakness. When I first had this beer five years ago, I rated it even higher--in part because I was younger in my tasting and it's a really nice, complex beer that's not overwhelming or an extreme beer. On draft at RFD, it was also open and accented it's strength. Love this beer and will drink more whenever I get a chance.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Smoked Porter,89
147,90,jbsteiny,3.99,"My first Stone porter -- on tap at Flatbush Farm. Dark brown, creamy head, didn't stick around. I'm sure if it were from a bottle, it'd be more persistant. Smells like a rauschbier. Malty, smoky, even peaty like a scotch. Wow! Burnt toffee, coffee, and baker's chocolate for sure. Tastes smoother than I expected, and remarkably little hops for the Stoners. Goes down smooth, but I think it's a bit too smoky to be a real session beer. Something I'd get on its own, or to mix it up, but I can't see putting back three or four of these. That said, it is seriously delicious if you like smoke and roasted malt.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Smoked Porter,89
147,90,bradford,3.05,"Tasted on 4/22/07 Appearance: A very dark Porter. Nice color interpretation of this mild style Smell: A different approach. Smokey malts give this a burnt smell, not at all unpleasant. Taste: I have given this a few tastes now, this being my third bottle. I always approach it with an open mind hoping for something different, but alas, I am again slightly dissapointed. Mouthfeel: Watery, bland, dissapointing Drinkability: I know a lot of people love this beer, and porter is a classic style that I usually enjoy, but this beer just doesn't do it for me. I respect Stone a lot, they are one of my all time favorite breweries, I guess I am just not a fan of this beer.

Head thins out evenly left some yummy lacing.  Smell - nice balance of several pleasant aromas, none overpowering the others. I appreciated the faint smokiness, it brought back some good memories.  Taste - Slight bitterness, smoky chocolate. Quality barley and hops in there.  Mouthfeel - Smooth, medium body.  Drinkability - Easy drinking, I can keep this one going all day long.  It's claim was correct. Chocolates brought out the sweetness of the beer and subdued the slight bitterness. The smokiness made my mouth water even more with some barbecued country ribs.

The appearance is strait black with some ruby edging, with a robust tan head. The smell is fairly mellow suprisingly. The taste was also mellow, but a good mellow, not like a ridiculously overkill stout. I was lovin' it already as a re-introduction to the dark side hehe. I remembered it was smoked all the sudden and there it was in my mouth, a perfect level of being smoked. Good job to Stone on that (when do they do a bad job?) The head stuck around the whole bomber-full and the mouthfeel was damn heavy. I could feasibily drink two of these as bombers, but I think I'd be over the roasty-ness by then...very nice though, I'm liking the porter better than the stout!",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Smoked Porter,89

It barely had a head and it quickly went away. After reading other reviews that describe a large, sustaining head I have to wonder about the freshness of my bottle. But since it has no date on it I can't tell. The aroma is very subtle. It was sweet malty with just hints of smoke and the darker malts. Again may have been freshness issue. The taste was nice and solid but not as great as I'd expected. Overall a good tasty beer but I will definitely need to try again to see if better with a fresher one.

The taste is smoky coffee and deep roasted malts. It's a very smooth taste with very little bitterness at the end. The smoky taste hangs around and is quite pleasant. Mouthfeel is medium tending towards thick and, as I said, very smooth. Drinkability is good, not a high alcohol beer and hides what there is.

Mouthfeel - I'd say it's medium to full-bodied. It's very easy to drink, but at the same time it is a big beer. Fills the mouth, yet there seems to be very little carbonation.

The taste is awesome - smoke, dark chocolate, and a nice dry black licorice-y finish. Mouthfeel is rich and creamy with a nice carbonated bite. Wow, this is easy to drink.

Smell: Dark chocolate and coffee are the main features. But, it definitely has a toasted nut and smoky smell. It's not quite as smoky as I was expecting from the name. Finally, it has a nice malty smell at the tail end.  Taste: It does have a nice smoky taste. Much more apparent here than when smelling it. Chocolate and coffee flavors are strong and blended very nicely. It also has a good malty taste to it.  Mouthfeel/Drinkability: It's medium bodied and extremely smooth. Its relatively low ABV lends well to its drinkability. Overall, this is a very good and underappreciated porter in my opinion. By far Stone's most underappreciated brew.

147,90,SkeeterHawk,3.77,"Appearance: Pours very still with only a small layer of bubbles across the top of the beer. The bubbles were tan and large while they lasted and fell within 30 seconds back into the beer. The beer is too dark to see through at all, and even the corner of the glass only shows a slight garnet when held directly to the light.  Aroma: I get mostly toasty notes and a faint roast. I don't get any smoke in the aroma. As the beer warms up, the smoke aromatics start their ascent and make it more complex.  Taste: There is a little more smoke in the flavor than I got in the aroma. If this beer didn't have the ""smoke"" label on it, I would almost think that this was a phenolic contamination in the early stages. There is a bit of roast here, but the toasty notes are the main component. This is a pretty mild Porter, and especially for Stone. There is no alcohol noticeable and only a little bit of hops. The beer comes across as being pretty refreshing and the finish is balanced. I don't get any alcohol in this beer at all, so it hides the 5.9% well.  Opinion: Well, this is really a pretty good beer. It is pretty amazing to me how drinkable it is because I normally have a bit of a hard time drinking Stone's beers because they are so brutally bittered with high Alpha hops. This one is reserved, and lets the malt run the show...pretty much. All in all, I was a bit surprised at how mild it is, but it remains really drinkable. The smoke is an enhancement and not a showcase so that makes it all the better in my opinion. I would drink this beer again.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Smoked Porter,89

Soft tan head pours two fingers thick and dissipates into a micro bubble ring that clings to the edges of the glass. Thin lacing.  S: Roasted coffee. Chocolate. Caramel. Bread. Soft smoke.  T: Roasted coffe and dark chocolate start hings off in the right diection. Thin clean hop presence. Roasted caramel malts are folloewd by the taste of wet earth. This brew finishes with a robust bitterness and a soft smoked peat moss flavor.  M: Rich and creamy. Full body. Minimal carbonation. Robust and dry.  D: I have been attracted to the smoke element in beer as of late and especially in the porters. An incredibly balanced porter that has a soft smoke finish that leaves you wanting more with each taste. Recommend.,Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Smoked Porter,89
147,90,jletts,4.35,"Poured black with a creamy kaki head. Smelled of smoke, some peat, cocoa, hints of burnt caramel. Not a strong nose, but a nice mix of aromas. Tasted very smokey up front with notes of wood, peat, and raisin. Very smooth and smokey on the palate and easy to drink more than one. This was a smooth porter that would probably go well with smoked meats and creamy cheeses. Campfire-smoked sausage and gouda may be a good pairing.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Smoked Porter,89
147,90,bradybeer,4.5,"Pours a dark brown with a thck creamy tan head. Light to medium carbonation with hops and smoke coming through. Smell is of hops and a whiff of smoke everytime your nose nears the brew. Taste is at once smokey, a little bitter, with notes of cocoa. Your mouth fills with a chewy smokey medium body feel with every sip. Drinkability? Oh my, while not a session beer-I could have several of these as the taste is near perfect for me",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Smoked Porter,89
147,90,objectivemonkey,4.28,"Into a St Bernardous tulip glass, pours a deep bitch black, maybe a little ruby around the edges, light tan head starts about a half inch and shrinks quickly but comes back with a stiff swirl, strings of lacing cast about here and there. Aroma has loads of dark malts, chocolates are pronounced, some dark caramels, a bit of a bitter streak, smoke is elusive, everything is pretty nice, if understated. Taste is more of the same, and elusive smoke plays nicely here. Also understated is the sweet but dark caramel malt, chocolates dancing lightly. It don't remember subtlety being Stone's thing, but they play it brilliantly here. The mouth is very smooth, body is great, everything is working just right here. All I can say for this one is, its a very good beer, and I enjoyed it thoroughly.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Smoked Porter,89
147,90,sleazo,4.05,On tap at porters pub. My reeward for handing in paper number 2. Pours a deep dark dark brown. Bordering on black. A decent sized head with proper lace. Smell is of roasted malt. Subtle smoke lingers in the nose. Alderwood maybe? Taste is nice roasted malts. Like a nice piece of toast with some subtle smoke in the aftertaste. I can't quite pinpoint the exact smoky flavour but this a nice porter. The hops are a presence as well. You can tell this is a west coast porter. Mouthfeel is excellent. Perfect for the style. Slightly chewy yet not thick at all. I could drink a bunch of these.,Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Smoked Porter,89

Nose: Mild roasty malts, cream, dark chocolate, and an earthy and green hop scent way down deep.  Taste: Very roasty, oaked and oatie malt flavor with a smoked undercurrent and a very subtle earthy and leafy hop flavor underneath.  Feel: Medium body, not very big for the stlye, feels rather thin, light and crisp overall for the style.  DA: Surprisingly un-impressed with this one on-tap. Good stuff, but was well under my expextations for this brew on-tap. Easy enough to drink though.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Smoked Porter,89
147,90,kkosmoski,4.08,"Bomber into a Duvel tulip:  A - Jet black in color with a big, pillowy, light brown head, which has very good retention and stick. S - Most obvious is the smoke, also some toasty grains and sweetness. T - Malt steals the show to start - smokey and bready out of the gate, followed by some caramel sweetness and American style hop flavor. Finish is all smoke. M - Medium bodied with a good amount of carbonation - not overdone. Creamy and smooth. D - I like what the smoke does for this beer. It adds another demension that keeps me wanting another sip.

147,90,jslot38,4.25,"Managed all 22oz in pbr1985 jumbo mug, so money.  Appearance: Poured with a good amount of head and a brief cascading effect. Looked so good in that big mug after a day out at the pitch. (A victorious day I may add)  Smell: Chocolate, smoked malts in the background, touch of coffee grinds.  Taste: Oh yes, a big porter indeed. Chocolate, and smoked malts all the way. Lovely. Just a few earth ridden hops and a roasted coffee grinds (french roast?) in the background.  Mouthfeel: Top notch. Chewy, perfect amount of carbonation. Stone hit the nail on the head in this catagory.  Drinkability: 22oz, bring it on, I look those gargoyles in the face and laugh at them.

147,90,mithrascruor,4.03,"22 oz. bottle poured into a mug.  Appearance: Pours a dark black color with a very slight reddish-brown tint. Dark tan head is nice; becomes a film that leaves some lacing near the top of the glass.  Smell: Has a light smokey mesquite aroma, but balanced nicely against a light, sweet floral aroma.  Taste: Initial flavor of roasted malts becomes supplemented with a combination of smokeyness and a slight floral taste. Has a smokey bitterness in the aftertaste. Nicely balanced and with a good level of complexity.  Mouthfeel: Smooth, medium- to heavy-bodied, and with a light carbonation.  Drinkability: Feels a bit stronger (alcohol-wise) than it really is, so take it a bit slower than you might otherwise do. I think it's quite drinkable -- nothing is out of line and it keeps my interest.  Possibly my favorite beer from Stone. It it well-balanced and doesn't try to go over-the-top.

147,90,pumarocks,3.9,"I picked a bomber of this up at World Market in Western Hills over in Cincinnati. Right off the bat I noticed a smokey and chocolately aroma. It pours a nice head and the color is black/blood red. The taste is heavenly. I have always been a fan of stout but not so much porter. This has changed my mind. It is very smooth and surprisingly refreshing. This brew will certainly accompany my bbq this summer. Well done Stone Brewing Company, well done.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Smoked Porter,89
147,90,crwills,4.03,"Great looking beer! A deep, dark read -- nearly black -- with ruby highlights. Small off-white head accents it.  Aroma is rauchbier-like: burnt wood, barbecue mesquite, dark burnt chocolate and... bacon!  The roasted malts really show up in the flavour. Good hop backbone as well, with a smoky finish and bitter, dry aftertaste that morphs into sweet candy sugar over time. As it warms, additional flavours (milk chcolate, sweet toffee, banana) start to show up. Smooth, creamy mouthfeel.  Fantastic beer!",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Smoked Porter,89
147,90,kpantz,3.68,"Executive Summary: Love 'em or hate 'em, Stone has a balanced lineup - pale and dark, traditional and eccentric. I think they excel at most of what they do, and the Smoked Porter is an example of a solid brew. Not a standout, but they don't all need to be (a la Dogfish Head - don't worry, Sam & Co...you're still one of my favorites). Classic roasted malt flavors and a smooth texture make this a very nice porter.  Appearance: Pours a clean, deep brown/black with ruby accents. Head is coffee ice cream that reduces to a film fairly quickly.  Smell: Roasted malts, a faint hint of the smoke. A little sweeter-smelling than I had expected. I also get a faint whiff of alcohol, which surprises me given the relatively low ABV.  Taste: The sweet, then roasted, then nearly burnt character of the malt is first, accented by the (not in your face) smoky flavor and followed by a crisp hop bitterness. If I didn't know this was a smoked porter, I might not have singled the flavor out. No evidence of alcohol in the flavor.  Mouthfeel: Fairly dead-on for a porter. I've said this many times - the mouthfeel is perhaps my favorite porter attribute, because I love me some deep, dark malt, but don't always want the girth that goes with the impy stouts.  Drinkability: This, like many of my favorite porters, scores high on my drinkability scale for three reasons: great roasted flavor, light body and low acohol.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Smoked Porter,89
147,90,Bookseeb,4.18,"I've had one bad experience with a smoked porter ( can't remember what or when), but ever since I've avoided anything smoked until I finally tried this porter. Apperance of dark chocolate with a thick head. Aroma of smoke, sweet coffee and roasted malts. If I were to pour a packet of hot cocoa mix into coffee and add a dash of smoke, this is the taste I percieved. Medium in body, overall not what I expected from this porter, where expectation was low, final outcome was quite exellent.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Smoked Porter,89
147,90,GbVDave,3.56,Poured from a 22oz bottlee into a 20oz imperial pint.  A: Dark black with a thick tan head. Excellent retention with gobs of lace.  S: Couldn't get much more out of it than roasted malt with a faint whiff of smoke.  T: Roasted malt beginning with a bitter hop finish. The smoke took on an odd mediciney cough drop flavor that I didn't care for. It got better as it came up to temp.  M: Thin and prickly. It got slightly thicker around 60º.  D: Unbalanced towards the bitter. Decent drinkability but I found it to be less satisfying than I had hoped.,Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Smoked Porter,89

Appearance: Pours a vary dark garnet with a nice head that retains reasonably well and leaves scattered lacing around the pint  Smell: The predominate aroma is dark chocolate and the smoke comes through with a slightly minty aspect  Taste: Starts out with a dark chocolate and smoked flavor that builds in minty complexity; after the swallow, some earthy bitterness creeps in and joins that minty smoke flavor to provide a nicely balanced finish  Mouthfeel: Medium to full bodied (just right for a porter) with moderate carbonation  Drinkability: I was a little concerned about the age on this bottle given the ABV but it drank wonderfully",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Smoked Porter,89
147,90,Damian,3.51,"Drank on-tap at Deep Ellum, Allston, MA  Poured a deep brown/black with a two-finger, bubbly, cocoa-colored head that slowly faded to a thick ring of lace. Large, irregular-shaped patches of lacing coated the glass.  Aroma was was quite subtle at first but became somewhat more noticeable as the beer warmed. Dark malts, bittersweet chocolate and coffee beans came through in the nose.  Taste was rather mild and tame. The beer was somewhat sharp up front (I believe this was due to the alcohol) before the roasted malts, bitter espresso and hints of dark chocolate became apparent. By mid-palate the hops kicked in and lasted well into the finish, where they became quite strong. The lingering aftertaste consisted of a mix of roasted malts and a moderate smokiness.  Mouthfeel was rather thin (yet creamy) and the body was fairly light for the style.  I expected more in general from this beer (more intensity, more complexity and more body). Overall, this was a disappointment.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Smoked Porter,89

Taste - Smoky taste was prominent, but suprisingly mild mannered. I was not sure what to expect from this beer and was pleasantly suprised. Overall nutty/smoky with a mild hoppiness. Mouthfeel - Nice carbonation, medium bodied. Overall - Suprisingly good, at least from my perspective.

147,90,goochpunch,4.45,"Pours out a black body with caramel to ruby-tinged hues on the outsides of the glass. Head is khaki colored, full of pits, and about 1/2"". Leaves some here and there lacing. Nose has some apple and berry fruitiness, toffee, caramel, molasses, mild chocolate, and a faint smoke background. Flavor is mostly chocolate, fruity esters, citrus hops (but not so much that it overpowers the truly porter characteristics), and caramel. Finish has a touch of smoke and mellow roasted malt astringency. Mouthfeel is moderate with a slightly biting carbonation. Has a nice mouth-coating quality to it. This is a great session porter, aside from the higher abv. This is hard to put down.  If this were available in Texas, I'd be all over it on a regular basis. Just as the bottle states, this goes great with some blackberry preserves.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Smoked Porter,89

Highly recommended.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Smoked Porter,89
147,90,BeerNinja007,4.18,"22oz bomber poured into my beer mug, paired with the left-over mashed garlic redskin potatoes I'm snacking on. I've been drinking mostly stouts lately, and this seems like a welcome change to something a little lighter (though not too light!).  This pours incredibly dark, even for a porter, with only a slight red/mahogany color shining through around the edges of the glass. Big head 5 fingers high (yes I had to use both hands) consisting of very small fine bubbles that give a smooth even surface, tan in color. Is now starting to condense in to larger bubbles  Aroma is of dark caramel and molasses sweetness, smoked malt, a hint of piney hops. Taste is pleasantly smoky without being overbearing. The same sweetness is present as is the hops, with but with dark chocolate overtones. At this point the pineyness of the hops appears to have really woken up and is now much more apparent in the smell.  Mouthfeel is incredibly smooth and pleasantly slick, this goes down reeealy easily. Carbonation level is good and alcohol is not apparent. It is taking a bit of restraint on my part to savor this instead of chugging it.  In my opinion this is damn near the perfect porter. Will definately be getting more.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Smoked Porter,89
147,90,Golden2wenty1,4.35,"Thanks to expatsteve for bringing me some Stone back from out East.  Pour: smokey black with garnet highlights, not quite opaque to the light with a finger of creamy tan foam that fades to a ring.  Nose: metallic, appleskins, smoked jerky, charred malt, wisps of booze, caramel malts add body.  Taste: not as smoked as I would have guessed from an extreme brewer like Stone but still noticeable. Rich, charred malts with sweet caramel body dominate with notes of beef jerky, wood, appleskins and surprisingly noticeable but not distracting booze in the finish and a cocoa/coffee coating on the tongue.  Feel: creamy, rich, but far from chewy...smooth.  Drinkability/Overall: a tasty porter with a smokey richness adding depth and character.

Smell - A sweet chocolate and coffee flavor, a bit of alcohol.  Taste - Definitely lives up to the name with a smoky flavor that is clearly apparent. Almost to the point of being like the charred edges of ribs on the grill. A moderate hop bitterness at the end of the drink that lingers for a while. Some dark chocolate is in the mix as well.  Mouthfeel - Slightly syrupy, a thicker porter that really feels hearty.  Drinkability - A highly drinkable porter. Very classic flavors with a bit of a twist with the smoke and hops.

Mocha head color. Pretty.  Smells hoppy. Some malt, maybe coffee. Not as deep as I like a Porter.  Coffee, chocolate, and sweet. Little hoppy finish. No ABV to taste. Fairly sweet for style.  Sits well, smooth carbonation. No bite, prolly a factor of ABV. Smooth medium finish, some staying power.  Drinkability is good. I personally dont enjoy the level of sweetness, but it is respectable. I would prefer more ABV, and maybe something fuller with more personality.

Very smooth, and fun to drink.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Smoked Porter,89
147,90,jhollick,3.93,"Pours quite dark with red and brown tones throughout. Very clingy lacing and a nice tan head.  The hops hit the nose first; notes of cocoa, roasted malts, caramel, and a touch of alcohol follow. This beer is divine in the mouth. So smooth and thick, with just enoug heft to hold it up. The smoke flavoring is surprisingly subtle...more so than I remember. Sever types of hops blend nicely, with none adding a great deal of bitterness. Much of the sweetness comes from the chocolate malts. Stickiness remains in the mouth long after the swallow, and the hop bite flares up as well.  There are certainly more drinkable porters out there. This is more of an occasion beer. Overall, this is a stellar effort from Stone. For a moderately aggressive smoked porter, the balance is remarkable. The smoke adds to the beer in a subtle but meaningful way. This could make a great pairing with meats and cheeses. Stone Smoked Porter is officially on my radar as one of the top American porters.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Smoked Porter,89
147,90,theWrkncacnter,3.61,"Poured from a 22oz bottle. I bought this in Oregon and took it back with me to Florida because they don't distribute Stone brews in my area. I'm a huge fan of Arrogant Bastard, so I thought I'd pick this up to give it a try. It pours with a 2 finger head that quickly goes away and leaves some moderate lacing. Appearance is a dark dark amber, very close to being black, the way a Porter should look. Not too much on the nose, or maybe my sense of smell is just dead tonight, but I can't really smell anything notable. Taste: aww yes, this is a good porter. Lots of rich bitter chocolate and coffee flavors with a nice smokey after taste, a little bit of sweetness there too once it's left to linger on your tongue. I've had other beers with ""Smoke"" in the title and the smokieness often overwhelmed the rest of the tastes, not the case with this beer. This one feels a little acidic as far as mouthfeel, and it's not as smooth as I hoped, but certainly not anything that's going to keep me from enjoying it, but it doesn't go down as easily as I hoped, but that's probably good because it'll keep me from drinking the one bottle I have too quickly.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Smoked Porter,89
147,90,LvilleIPA,3.96,"Poured out of a 22oz bomber into a St. Bernardus glass.  A - Very dark, almost black. I see no light coming through this one. Has a decent sized tan head on top.  S - I smell nothing. Maybe a hint of smokiness, but nothing really all that noticable.  T - Wow. This stuff is fantastic. Tastes basically like a ""big"" porter. I don't really detect huge amounts of ""smokiness"" (similar to the smell), but it's a big flavor with coffee and some bitter chocolate flavor. There seems to be some hops at the end of the sip to balance out all of the malts.  M - I'd say it's medium to full-bodied. It's very easy to drink, but at the same time it is a big beer. Fills the mouth, yet there seems to be very little carbonation.  I'd give this second place in the porter department only to Sam Smith's Taddy Porter. Though it may be different in style, it is still extremely well done and absolutely worth seeking out if you're into porters.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Smoked Porter,89

I thought the smell was a bit lacking though, I expected more smokiness to come through. This beer has wonderful flavors: dark chocolate, burnt coffee, plenty of roasted malts, and a slight smokiness...which once again I was preparing myself for more of a pronouced smoke flavor but still do enjoy it. This has a pretty good mouthfeel with just the right amount of carbonation. This beer is very drinkable and would love to pair it with food.

Taste is bang on- roasty sweetness with just the right amount of smoke. The smoke is not overpowering at all. Appropriate carbonation for the style and very drinkable. Hop presence is quite muted, at least for by Stone standards. This must be their least hopped style. A great porter in my mind.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Smoked Porter,89

Light berry fruityness plays well with the rest of the characters in this beer. Slight moments of butterscotch linger on the palate toward the end. Finishes quite roasted and bitter.  M: Medium body with a fizzy mouthfeel.  D: This is a good and balanced smoked porter.

S: Lots of smoke, nearly to the point of being a rauchbier. Notes of brown sugar, sweet malts and a mild wood and earth note round things off perfectly. Absolutely wonderful aroma.  T: Dominant sweet smokey notes with a roasted malt backbone. Rich grain character fills in the voids. Hints of sweet husk and molasses weave through the mildly complex brew. Exemplary.  M: Low and behold, there's where the carbonation was hiding. Bubbly rich and velvety on the tongue, this one goes down amazingly smooth and friendly.  D: Wow. This is a winner. I may have found my new companion for the fall/winter months. Highly recommended. A world-class example of what a good smoked porter (or any smoked beer) should be.  Notes: This particular sample was aged for at least 3 months in my cellar, and who knows how long it was brewed before I got to it. I would imagine that it would only be just as good in a fresher form. Hell, it's probably damn good aged too.

Smell is slightly subtle, dark malt, light smokiness, i agree with the previous descriptions of a salty smokey character, there is also a toffee, coffee and light hop aroma. As this warms up the total aroma is multiplied in double. The taste is round with a nice bitter coffee flavor. Toward the finish this makes my tongue and mouth begin to water and after that a nice blend of subtle toffee, coffee bitterness. I honestly feel this would be excellent with barbecue just like mentioned on the bottle. I mean I can imagine this being great with quite a lot of food.

Nose is salty smoke and coffee about equally. Tasty and intimidating.  Taste brings the smoke up front only to be eclipsed in the finsh by healthy but not overpowering coffe flavors. The finish is a melange with a renewed emphasis on smoky wood and roasted tones. Truly a one of a kind taste. Mouthfeel is slight but lets the taste steer the boat, which is wise.  Maybe a bit too much smoke for me to down a sixer but definitely an original, eclectic masterpiece from one of the world's finest breweries.

The head is nice and stiff and leaves nice lacing and stays throughout the entire drinking.  Aroma is not really smoky. Mostly chocolate and coffee. Slight smokiness but minimal at best and only detectable as the beer is nearly room temp. Maybe I was expecting that smokiness like a campfire or smoked sausage. Aroma is basically typical of a porter. Nice dark chocolate and burnt coffee.  Not a lot of smoke in the taste either. Mostly a bitter chocolate. Some very nice bitterness follows, not sure if that is from smoked or toasted malts or hops. Very chocolatey at the end and some ""paper on fire"" flavors. Very dry as well. A nice taster.  Could be sessionable, especially at this time of year. I like this but the smoked quality is pretty much non existent. So, a bit misleading, but a very nice porter.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Smoked Porter,89
147,90,PhiloPsych,3.86,"I really like porters and stouts. But unlike most Stone brews, I have to say this one is not the best in its class. It is a solid offering from Stone, but, in my opinion, nothing really special. It pours a big, dark tan, bubbly head. The color is black coffee. The head is not long lasting, but leaves a creamy lacing all the way down the glass. Surprisingly there isn't much aroma to speak of. Maybe I served it too cold? The mouthfeel is lighter than I like for a porter or stout. Flavor is roasty, smokey, almost burnt up front, hollow in the middle, and finishes with a bit of a sour kick. The stouts I prefer (e.g., Pizza Port's Old Viscosity and AleSmith's Speedway) have more alcohol than this, too. This beer is somewhat comparable to Guinness. Though I do prefer it to Guinness. It is not as creamy as Guinness--in fact the carbonation is a bit much for a porter, I think. The flavor is better and more complex than Guinness in my opinion. Overall a very decent beer, but not my favorite porter and certainly not my favorite from Stone.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Smoked Porter,89
147,90,schusterbauer,3.96,"a -- quite dark, almost black, with ruby highlights apparent as the light passes through; HUGE majestic head that lessens but never disappears, leaving massive amounts of lacing  s -- nothing out of the ordinary; a nice blend of roasted malts, coffee, charcoal  t -- extremely well balanced. the roasted malts and charcoal flavors dominate, giving way to hints of coffee, chocolate, smoke, and hops. actually, there seem to be a ton of hops in this beer, and surprisingly enough, they blend wonderfully with the other flavors. as for the smoked aspect, i really wish it stood out more. it is detectable, and for better or worse, it does stick with the ultra-balanced nature of the flavor profile. personally, i was hoping to find the smoked flavors more in the foreground. after swallowing, you could almost think that the flavors left in your mouth are from a cup of coffee, as opposed to a beer.  m -- maybe the highlight of this beer for me. silky smooth, quite thick, and a level of carbonation that is refreshing but not intrusive. the mouthfeel definitely verges upon stout territory. in fact, there are many quality stouts that could take a lesson here.  d/overall -- coming in a bomber, and being a bit more potent than the average porter, this might not be something that you drink multiples of at one time. i drank this on a night when i was already tired, and i wasn't aware of the ABV, and it put me right to sleep (pleasantly, i might add). that said, this is a highly enjoyable beer, and i will definitely make this a regular.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Smoked Porter,89
147,90,jmalex,4.22,"My first review is a favorite style of mine from a favorite brewery of mine. But this will be the first time I've had this particular beer.  Appearance: From a 22 oz. bomber, poured an opaque coffee black with a small but lingering off-white head. Large patch of lace remains several minutes after pouring.  Smell: Deep and rich. Malty with indications of chocolate and caramel. Slight tones of dark fruits.  Taste: Very nice! Thick and creamy. The initial taste is wonderfully malty with just the right bitterness to match. The smoky flavor shines through, but is not too obtrusive. A pleasant sweetness lingers but leaves no unpleasantness.  Mouthfeel: Makes the beer in my opinion. So smooth! Thick viscosity that coats as it goes down.  Drinkability: Fantastic. Instantly one of my favorite porters.  Overall an amazing beer. Smoked beers are not typically my thing but this beer pretty much does it how I'd like. Stone certainly did not disappoint with this one. I'll definitely be buying this again.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Smoked Porter,89
147,90,BMoney575,4.3,"Had a bottle of this last night, and it inspired me to write my first review.  Pours with a surprising thickness, head lingers for awhile with good lacing.  Most apparent aroma is of chocolate, with roasted malt and coffee coming through later.  Taste is very good, with the chocolate up front and a smooth coffee finish.  Mouthfeel is absolutely great, as I find this beer to be thicker than most other porters I've had. One of the high points.  Drinkability is good, a bomber is just about the right size.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Smoked Porter,89
147,90,bgraney,4.08,"Black as midnight on a moonless night. Bubbly slight-tan/off white head, dissolved around the edges first leaving a sculpture in the center. Roasted malt/chocolate aroma, mild, with plum hints in the background. Almost as chocolaty tasting as a Rogue Chocolate Stout. This beer is screaming for a piece of cake to go with it. Rich and full on the tongue, leaving the malt&choclate behind as a coating. Great after taste. Very drinkable for the style. The flavors are long lasting but not overpowering.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Smoked Porter,89
147,90,bigone4,3.82,Pours a dark black pitch color very tough to see any light penetrating this beer. Some subtle ruby hues peek thru around the edges when back lit. Nice fluffy tanish off-white head with decent retention. Smells of roasted malt and some mild alcohol hints. Smells like a big malted porter. I was rather disappointed by the lack of smoky flavor. I was looking for more of a smoked and roasted mouth feel. There are hints of the roasted malt and mild hints of smoke but not to the extent I would have liked. Very full bodied with a nice mild touch of hop in the aftertaste. There certainly is a decent mix of flavors throughout the whole brew. Subtle hint of chocolate. Well not everyone will agree on some things but this one was a bit disappointing for me. All there other offerings have been quite delectable but to each there own. Maybe I will give this one another go later this month. It is tasty and drinkable and matches well with pretty much any food. Pumpkin pie and some Thanksgiving treats were my paired foods. Decent porter but not my favorite.,Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Smoked Porter,89

Pours out a syrupy, jet black with a HUGE, creamy tan head. Light red highlights in the bottom, love the thick foam.  Sweet, maple syrup aroma with roasted malts and some chocolate notes. Hints of coffee and cream. Full, dry nose.  Excellent malt profile in the taste, both sweet and toasted without the burnt/bitterness that would usually follow suit. Café au lait lingers strong on the tongue. Roasted, full flavor with a very mild/weak hop profile. Strong bittersweet chocolate, but not overpowering.  Creamy and smooth, medium bodied. This brew does not succumb to too much water or carbonation. Well-brewed and solid, thoroughly enjoyed this one.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Smoked Porter,89
147,90,theopholis,4.43,"I resisted trying this beer for months, due to the ""smoke"" in it's name. Big mistake on my part.  Appearance- Deep, very dark redish burgandy. Apears black unless you hold it up to a bright light. Nice light brown head that keeps growing for several seconds after you quit pouring, but quickly disappears.  Aroma- not overpowering. Nothing that jumps right out atyou. A fairly complex mixture of malty sweetness, roaste and hint of smoke.  Taste- Unlike certain lite beers that merely claim they ""taste great"", this one really does. It's the best mass-produced porter I've ever had. A strong roasted grain-coffee taste up front with notes of chocolate and a hint smoke. This is a beer you will taste from the 1st touch of your lips to the very back of your throat. After your done, try licking the inside of your mouth 10 minutes later. Yea....you can still taste it. Glorious!!  Mouthfeel- Full-bodied, chewy. Just the tiniest bit oily.

147,90,RJLarse,3.84,"I picked up a bomber of Stone Smoked Porter at a specialty shop to taste and review. I poured this beer in to a pit tumbler.  Pours a deep dark walnut brown, and is clear, but nearly opaque. There re red hues when the glass is held up to the light. A think frothy beige head forms, and is fairly resilient. the brew looks like a chocolate shake from the top.  The smell is pretty average for a porter. There are some malt and little roasted grain aroma. I was expecting more smoke fragrance.  The taste is good. Semi-sweet dark chocolate, coffee and a little smoky charcoal flavor.  Mouthfeel is smooth, full-bodied and creamy.  This is a very drinkable porter. It's not as dry and smokey as I thought it would be. I think is a good, but fairly typical, porter. I would have it again for sure.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Smoked Porter,89
147,90,ClockworkOrange,4.36,"Poured from a bomber a rich deep redish brown with an inch of foamy tan head. I'm getting scents of dark chocolate and caramel malt followed by a nearby campfire. Tastes of chocolate and coffee, mild smoke and well balanced with malt. Finishes slightly bitter as the smoke lingers on. One of my all time favorite porters. Very satisfying offering from Stone. I can see myself enjoying a few of these on a chilly fall camping trip to compliment some smokey, grilled meats cooked over the campfire.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Smoked Porter,89
147,90,wingman14,4.8,"Pours an inky black with a thin mocha head. When you hold it to the light it has red hues. The smell is great and well balanced. It is driven by the smoke, but sweet, maybe chocolaty notes. The taste is just as good, well balanced, starts smoky and sweet with a strong porter finish. The aftertaste sticks with the smoke theme but is also strong with malts. The mouthfeel is great, a good balance of flavor, carbonation, and body. I could drink these all night long.

Smells of dry chocolate with a slight sourness that plays off the chocolate with a subtle hint of ash. Theres also a bit of corn syrup in the background.  Tastes of sweet dark barley with a hint of cocoa and a dry woody campfire. Theres also a slight lime here. In the finish, the campfire fades from lively woody smoke to ash.  The mouthfeel is light to medium bodied with a thick mouth of little bubbles that feels slightly dry.  Not bad at all.

The bartender had me dip my finger into the head to show me how rich and creamy it is. Very nice. Nice lacing as well. The beer smells of smoked wood, coffee, and some dark chocolate. It's like they captured a campfire in the aroma. Impressive.  Stone Smoked Porter tastes as good as it smells. The smokey, woodchips-esque flavor reveals itself first, with coffee and chocolate nodes playing second fiddle. There was also a slight bitterness at the end. As the beer warmed up, there was a distinct pine flavor that was certainly welcomed. Mouthfeel was full and dry.  This is an incredibly drinkable beer, even though it's quite heavy. Despite it being almost 70 degrees in New York yesterday, having one of these puts you in the perfect mood to bring on winter.

It pours well and comes out a nice deep dark redish black.  The smell intially is a little too subtle but letting it breath reveals malty aromas with a bit of smoked wood and some wonderful hops.  Truth is I was a little disappointed in the seeming lack of smoked flavor. I have had some other smoked brews that lend more towards tasting the wood. However, the beer was increadibly fresh and the hoppy finish was perfectly bitter sweet.  The mouth feel was light with out too much carbonation and the beer goes down well. Perhaps a bit a on the heavy side but during a cold winter day I could certainly drink a couple of these. Try it out. Another good beer from Stone for sure.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Smoked Porter,89

147,90,joe1510,4.35,22oz. Bomber  Opened with a pfffttt...Poured in my pint glass a viscous black. Very dark. Some dark ruby tinting when held up to the light. A half inch tan head sits on top but fades fairly quickly to an even top coat. Lacing sticks as my glass is tilted but slowly slides back into the abyss that is the body of this beer.  The smell is filled with roasted malt goodness. Along with chocolate and a tiny bit of burnt grain. There is just a slight touch of smoke up front but to tell you the truth I don't think I'd be able to pick it up if I didn't know it was there. As it warms I can pick up the smoke more and more.  The taste is very close to perfect. Starts with a small burnt grain taste quickly taken over by the roasted malts and chocolate. I can't really taste the hops but they're in there. There is a nice bitterness from what tastes like a combonation of hops and darkly roasted malt. The smokiness is there faintly in the back throughout the drink. Very nicely done and balanced.  Mouthfeel is viscous but you could tell this from the pour. It's thick in my mouth but not coyingly so. Silky smooth but somehow a little chewy/gritty. I know that doesn't sound right but that's how it is. I really like the feel especially on a cold night like tonight.  For a smoked porter the drinkability is outstanding. The lower alcohol helps as to not be too big of a beer to drink a lot of.  Stone's Smoked Porter is one of my new favorite cold weather beers. I've always liked smoked porters but so far this is at the top of my list. Excellent example. Warms me up nicely. A must try.  Slainte!,Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Smoked Porter,89

Taste was upfront moderate roasted bitterness and coffee with some sweet chocolate and burnt sugar tones and light piney hoppiness followed by a blend of strong smokiness, moderate sweet chocolate and cola, light piney hops bitterness on a long finish that reminds me of rootbeer or cola. Mouthfeel was medium bodied, creamy and silky, lively carbonated, and moderately astringent.

Decent lacing that slowly disappears after it sticks to the glass. A very deep garnet hue when held directly to the light and deep brown when held away from God's touch.  Smell- Not realy smokey for a ""smoked"" porter. More like a normal roasted malt profile you'd find in any other porter. Isn't waht I expected from a Stone product.  Taste- Coffee grounds to start with some more burnt like malts in the middle. The hops hit closer to the finish. Just a little general bitterness giving it a good baker's chocolate feel. The finish is a dark malt and toffee roasted over a campfire ending. Not too smooth.  Mouthfeel- A little thick, but does bring an overall pleasing sense to the tongue.

Aromas of light smoke, sweet chocolate, and grape jelly rise. Modest smoke flavors meld with some bittersweet chocolate and a nice hop driven bitterness in the finish. The smoke fades into the background behind the chocolate notes while the finish lingers with a hoppy smokiness. Bittersweet to semi-sweet chocolate fills the medium body. Active carbonation adds a slight sandpaper feel. Easily drinkable, and I would like to see the smoked bumped up.

Roastiness makes it a tad astringent in the middle with some burnt flavors. Coffee and a subtle smokiness on the finish. Sweetness lingers throughout the brew and is joined by a medium bitterness at the end. Complex and delicious!  M- Smooth and creamy, carbonation is fairly low but just right for this beer.

147,90,loving44,4.25,"poured dark black with brown/ruby highlights. Quick rising head that faded into a large rocky ""moon surface"" look. At this point the beer reminds me of a glass of Coke (not a great thing IMO). After a light a whirl in my pint glass the head gets nice and creamy (much better!).  The nose is of weak chocolate, light smoke, dark ripe fruits.  Taste: chocolate hit me right away followed my a pleasant roasty smoke element, not an overpowering aspect at all. The smoke compliments the rest the malt in this beer instead of being too ""in your face"". The beer finishes with a coffee-like bitter bite followed by a tingly hop caress. This is a very good beer, especially around this time of year. The flavors seem to come with the season.  Mouthfeel is rich and full - especially a it warms. The carbonation is thick and prickly at first but fades a bit to give the beer more of a creamy texture. This porter is very similar in mouthfeel to many dry stouts I have enjoyed.  This beer is very drinkable, and pairs well with my kind of food; meat. Lots of flavors going on that keep you coming back. This has to be one of my favorite Stone releases and I'm sure glad it's available year-round.  If you haven't tried this one, give one a try soon.

147,90,ccrida,3.12,"Poured from a slightly chilled 22 oz. bottle into a Ename chalice, the Smoked Porter was midnight black with a thin tan head which left only slight lace. This was my first smoked beer, and although I have heard good things, I was a bit skeptical. Furthermore, I should say that I'm generally not a big fan of Porters. The aroma was extremely sweet, with flavors of caramel and malt but no smoke, and was not very appealing to me. The taste however was much more balanced and a pleasant surprise. It was a bit sweet, but not nearly as much as the aroma would lead you to believe. There was a definite smoky taste, that if anything was more subtle then overwhelming. The main story here was the richness of the malt, which the smoke did a fine job of balancing out, making this porter much more enjoyable to me then they normally are. However, there was a fairly strong alcohol taste for only 5.9% ABV. The mouthfeel was rich and a bit syrupy from all the malt, but the balance provided by the smoke made this a drinkable porter worth checking out.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Smoked Porter,89

147,90,czechsaaz,3.56,"Very roasty malt aroma that is pretty much like a regular porter. I don't get a lot of smoke in the nose. I get a little bit of spicey hop and lots of roasted malt. Some fruity fermentation esters too.  Very dark with red highlights when held up to bright light. Nice frothy and lasting tan head with lots of lacing.  Very malty and a little sweet. Not a lot of roast malt flavor that I would expect out of a porter. There's some, but it's got so much base malt sweetness that it seems lacking. The smoke component definitely comes through in the aftertaste. Hop bitterness is very restrained and there is little hop flavor. Basically, I find myself wanting either more roast malt, like a robust porter, or more smoke flavor. This is a malt dominant flavor profile.  Medium full bodied with very good carbonation.  I really do like this beer and I will drink it again. But I want more character in a smoked beer and in a porter.

Smell: I found the hops overpowered most of the nose, but there were the classic porter aromas of the roasted malts.  Taste: The only thing that made this beer interesting enough to score above average was the hoppiness. Otherwise, it's kinda lacking dimension and boldness.  Mouthfeel: The smokiness is inconsistent and the bitterness is largely derived from the hops with less of a sense of roasted malts.

Smoke is up front on the palate, but the finish is all chocolate malt. Interesting, because I would have expected smoke to show up more in the finish/aftertaste than chocolate flavors. Enough hops to balance, but their flavor doesn't come through. With it finishing on a chocolate note instead of smoke, it's easy to forget this is a smoked beer.

Nose: Burnt malts, dark rich chocolate, coffee, and dark fruit mostly plum. The plum smell seems to take control as the beer warms to room temp.  Taste Dark chocolate and coffee combined with burnt malts lead to a wonderful mild hop bittering smokey dry aftertaste. Yummy stuff.  Mouthfeel is slick and full. Dead on.  An extremely drinkable porter. The complex flavors meld together wonderfully.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Smoked Porter,89
147,90,EPseja,3.91,"Served from a 22oz. bomber in an Imperial Pint Glass at just below cellar temperature.  A - Pours a clear, deep mahogany brown. Head rises to a full two inches and stops... still... lasting... Creamy and pillowy on top, medium bubbled on the bottom. Finally it starts to reside and the lacing sticks in sheets like whole milk to the side of the glass. Beautiful.  S - Deeply roasted caramel malts. Some wet newspaper. Mild vanilla sweetness. Not very complex in the nose.  T - Roasted malt profile in the front, laced with hints of smoldering, charred campfire wood. Smooth and mellow in the middle as the caramel sweetness comes to the fore. Finish is surprisingly hoppy, bitter like strong coffee and quite dry, leaving you wanting more.  M - Oddly watery on the intake, and expanding as it rolls across the tongue. Just reaches the chewy/dense realm before the swallow, which is filling and bold.  D - Another delicious offering from Stone. A highly sessionable porter that's got body and character that will keep it interesting all night long. Well done!",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Smoked Porter,89
147,90,HossMcGraw,3.58,"This was a fine beer indeed, although it wasn't as big or as bad as I was expecting from Stone. Poured a thick black slag of a beer with a large tan head and great lacing. A real beauty.  The aroma consists of molasses, black licorice, rye bread, and a subtle smokiness. Flavor is quite hoppy as one would expect from Stone, with a foundation of rich caramel and dark fruit. A smoked chocolate dryness hangs around for a nice long finish.  The mouthfeel is a bit dull due to lack of carbonation or thickness, and drinkability is kind of low due to the dark, smoky charateristics, and the dryness. In all fairness, it is still quite warm outside and I may just not be in the mood for this on such a warm night. At any rate, this just tastes very similar to Rogue Shakespeare but without the nuance.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Smoked Porter,89

S: Aroma is a roasted, chocolately nose, no hint of smoke.  T: The taste is smokey up front and gives way to a chocolatey, roasted flavor. The smoke pops back up in the finish and lingers.  M: Smoking the malts for a porter is interesting and that flavor pops up at interesting times throughout the drink.  D: I am not a huge fan of smoked beers, but this one is alright (but nowhere near my favorite stone brews).",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Smoked Porter,89
147,90,eballard,4.07,This beer pours a dark deep brown color with a dark cream colored head. The smell is very much like roasted coffee. This beer is full and rich with a smoky roasted taste. Flavors of coffee and chocolate blended with the roasted malts bring out a lot of taste in the beer. The beer is heavy and deep with a nice strong after taste. This is a great porter if you like your porters strong. I also love it as a marinade for stakes. It has a great taste and adds a great flavor to the meat. Just make sure you save some for drinking.,Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Smoked Porter,89
147,90,BillyB,4.14,"Smoked porter is one of the most interesting and unique beer styles around as far as I'm concerned.  This one is excellent. Dark brown to black color with a slight foamy tan head.  Salty smoky aromas are so strong I could just sit and smell the beer without drinking it. One of the most interesting aromas of any beer I've tried.  Smooth, salty, smoky taste mixed with caramel, toffee and traditional porter tastes.  Very drinkable. I'd try it with smoked salmon or salty fish; anchovies or some sardines.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Smoked Porter,89

When it got set down in front of me, I thought it was a stout. Super black color, with a perfect head on it.  Beer has a very robust malty backbone, with that perfect balance of smoke and deep dark roasted flavors. Often I try smoked beers that go overboard with ths smoking... not here. The balance is excellent. There is also enough hops there to make me happy, but they certainly are secondary.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Smoked Porter,89

I had this one while chilling in my tent in RMNP during a rain storm one afternoon.  Really nice looking brew. Nearly opaque but with some brown fringes. Lots of tan head, thick lacing. Light aroma though. Sweet milk chocolate exclusively. The taste is a step in the right direction though. Light smokiness initially then bittersweet chocolate. Slight sweetness in the middle. Finish has a nice roasted bitterness. A touch of earthy hops. Okay mouthfeel. A bit thin, coats well and the flavor lingers though. Good drinkability overall. A nice beer with some nice smokiness and a good overall flavor. Goes down easy.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Smoked Porter,89

The taste, true to it's namesake, is smokey, with rich malt characteristics, but with noticeable hop contributions. Balance is good, and leads way to some coffee/chocolate tastes in the middle, with eventual smokiness returning.  Smooth and very drinkable.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Smoked Porter,89
147,90,Dizzy,3.55,"Pours dark brown, tan head. Smell is malts, fruit , a little hops and a little smoke. Taste is carmel, a little roastiness with a smoky background; balanced with hop bitterness.

147,90,mjc410,3.17,"Poured into a La Moneuse tulip lazily, the beer still manages to raise a mighty, creamy, big bubbled head, the color of creamed coffee. It settles after a few minutes, leaving nice lacing. The body is almost opaque, but ruby peeks through a bit.  Smell is light, sugary, and only mildly roasty. Not too much here.  Taste is light, creamy, and mildly roasty. Very enjoyable. Mildly bitter. Would benefit from a good bit more smoke and chocolate flacors.  Very light, even while knowing its ABV. Still, makes it quite drinkable. A nice beer for sessions, although on the strong side.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Smoked Porter,89
147,90,dherling,4.2,"Don't expect a rauchbier here, it has a subtle smokyness that compliments the toffee maltiness of this porter.

My first review, how exciting.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Smoked Porter,89
147,90,gotbeer,4.3,"The appearance of this one is dark with a nice head that retains well.  The smell has hints of smoke and toffee.  The taste is great. There are hops of course (it's Stone) and a very light hint of smoke. Chocolate and toffee round out the malts. This one is surprising good on a hot summer night.  The mouthfeel is satisfying and the drinkability is excellent. This is an all season porter for sure, and one fo the best examples of it's kind.  This may not be Stone's most popular brew, but it's one of it's best. Highly reccomended.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Smoked Porter,89

147,90,Liquids,4.48,"My first experience with Stone, and I'm not much of an over the top Northwwestern hop kind of guy, but I have to try it at least once with a chance to get hands on some...espcially this one as I love porters and smoke flavored beers.  Pours a rubied deep brown that is impressive in it's thick creamy foamed head of a light molases color, and it holds for a while. Smells of sweet malts, very light alcohol underneath, with hops smelling grassy and gentle in a british way, but also blended with that northwestern american hops aroma. A subtle dopple like sweetness in the aroma as well. This smells like a lot is going on in a good way, and it's already not what I was expecting. Expecting a hop bomb of an ultra smoky porter... Here goes...tastes mostly brown actually; the smoke it faint and in the finish. Charred malt peaks through past the smoke and there is only a little bit of that to add complexity but not offend. The taste is classic dark brown/light porter with a few twists to give it complexity. It's balanced in hops actually. More comprable to jinx than I expected! Mainly just a note darker and a tad less smoky. I can see this as a porter, but it seems to have a lot in common with a medium bodied brown ale apart from the color. I like both browns and porters, and so it was more of a surprise expecting a near-stout kind of porter. A tasty, english style, balanced-flavored brew! Mouthfeel is medium with not intrusive carbonation ,in a really good way; very solid, which contributes to being one of the most excellent, easy drinking, sessionable beers I've had in a long time, and the 22oz split with a friend went down far quicker and more easily than I imagined! Drink this!",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Smoked Porter,89
147,90,neenerzig,4.33,"Poured out of a bomber into a pint glass/tumbler. This beer is the very first offering from Stone that I ever tried. I didn't like it at all the first time I tried it, liked it only slightly better the second time I had it, but loved it the third time I had it once my palate had developed some. This beer pours a very dark brown color with some deep amber red highlights when held up to the light. The tan head is a good 3/4 inches thick when poured and settles to a good surface layer coating maybe 1/4 inch thick with very good retention and excellent lacing. A whiff fills the nostrils with deep, roasted malty aromas of coffee and chocolate with hints of caramel and some dark fruit-maybe some plum or perhaps a slight hint of cherry. Tastes sweet and also a little bitter at the same time with hints of coffee, chocolate, fruits such as plums, and of course some malt. The flavors are rounded out by a fairly subtle but definite hop presence. The flavors are quite well balanced indeed. This beer has a full bodied, crisp, frothy and almost creamy mouthfeel with moderate carbonation. Drinkability is excellent. A very good representation of this style indeed. A winner!

147,90,EvilKeith,3.97,"Pours from the bottle a very dark brown, in the glass it could be black. The head begins as two fingers of creamy camel colored froth, falls to a cap with thick and sticky lace. The smoke is more subtle than expected. The primary scents are dark fruits, faint choclate, charcoal, and light smokiness. As it warms caramel comes to prevalence. Taste is chocolate, a bit of coffee bean with an underlying smoky sweetness. Well balanced with a dry bitter hop finish. Medium bodied. Moderately active carbonation. Crisp mouthfeel. It was enjoyable, as a porter. I found the smoke to be a little understated.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Smoked Porter,89

Maybe smoke with lots of malts, and light hops?  Taste- Smokey aftertaste with a light bitterness to it but not much. Malty, dont know what flavor that Im tasting (after reading others reviews on BA it made sense and I tasted it that its a light coffee taste). Can taste the smokiness though especially when it warms up comes out pretty strong and in aftertaste. Not to hoppy I believe. Theres a light bitterness to it probably from the hops coming through. Flavors come out more when it warms.  Mouthfeel- Medium body with light carbonation but it is there as a light bite at first.  Drinkabilty- Wish I could tell what the taste is (found out it is probably coffee), tastes familiar. Its better the more I drank. This did make me want to try more porters.

147,90,EPICAC,4.22,"I purchased this a few days ago at Downtown Wine & Spirits. I chilled this in the fridge and served it in my NERAX pint glass.  Appearance: Pours an opaque black with garnet tints around the edges. A fluffy beige head tops the beer, eventually fading to a quarter-inch layer, persisting and then disappearing altogether.  Smell: Dark fruit, coffee, dark chocolate and a nice smokiness.  Taste: Fruity sweetness and mild tartness upfront. A roasted coffee bitterness in the finish gives way to a nice smoky flavor that lingers in the aftertaste.  Mouthfeel: Tingly carbonation, with a smooth and thick rich texture.  Drinkability: Easy to drink and flavorful, though it may be a little strong for some.  Overall: This is an excellent flavorful porter.

S - Roasted, smokey malts covering a fruity sweetness. A bit of coffee and leather in there too.  T - Nice. Again, roasted malts dominate this one, but there is also a very apparent bitterness that I wasn't expecting from the smell. I'm not sure initially if this is caused by hops, but either way, I like it a lot. Behind all of this is the sweetness at the finish.  M - A bit thin, in my opinion, for a complex beer like this.

Smooth mocha aftertaste.  Rich, slick mouthfeel. Definitely porterish, not as chewey as a stout, but thick enough.

Scattered streaks of lacing are left around the glass. Smell is of some sweet, smokey peat, and beef jerky notes, along with caramel, cocoa powder, vanilla, and raisins. Perhaps a touch of anise buried in the background. Pretty complex. Taste is of the same aromas with a lip smacking sweet malt that confuses the tastebuds at first but makes for a plausable and complex brew.

147,90,instrumentality,4.05,"I filled a pint glass to the rim with this intriguing beverage and found myself staring at a nearly pitch black, completely opaque liquid topped off with 1 1/2 fingers of tan head that settled to a what looked like a raw silver dollar pancake - a thin coating with a few large scattered bubbles of carbonation.  I took a whiff and was immediately reminded of burnt coffee beans and not much else.  The taste was more or less the same, but still somehow refreshing. I've tasted a lot of stouts lately that tasted like coffee, but this one, being a porter, was lighter and went down more smoothly.  The mouthfeel was one of the easiest I've experienced in a dark beer; just enough carbonation, minimal alcohol burn, and only the slightest hint of black coffee bitterness left behind to coat my tongue.  I'm not a huge fan of porters, as I've generally thought of them as watered down stouts without a whole lot of complexity, but objectively speaking, this was a pretty tasty beer, and easy to drink despite the fact that I normally find myself having to slow down when that coffee bean taste hits me.  I don't have enough of a basis of comparison (it's been years since I had my last porter) to understand the ""smoked"" distinction, but maybe it's the difference between tasting like coffee beans and tasting like *burnt* coffee beans. Regardless, whatever it is, I'm happy I tried this one.  I'd be interested in seeing if they ever put the chipotle version of this beer in bottles. I tried it at the San Diego Real Ale Fest last weekend, and it was an interesting variation on this one--not quite as refreshing, but definitely more interesting.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Smoked Porter,89

However, later it seemed to give off an almost liquorice smell. It wasn't bad, now keep this in mind that I am a person who hates liquorice.  T: Had a sweet roasted malt taste too it that was very nice. Also it came with a slight backing of an alcohol taste that was slightly noticable. Who knew Stones could make a beer that wasn't hops heavy? However, to further my belief that Stones is one of my personal favorite breweries, they got this smoked porter just right.  M: Medium body that was very pleasant. Like that taste had a slight Alcohol warming to the mouthfeel.  D: Very drinkable.

Many splatters of lace too.  Smells are coffee, toffee and plenty of roasting to the malts. Nice nutty buoyancy also. I can only describe the overall aroma as ""upbeat"" as opposed to the heavier smells of some porters and stouts.  Very English vibe in the flavor, despite the smoke which makes me think more of German rauchbiers, of course. Good balance happening: smoky malts, malty smoke, hoppy bitterness, chocolate richness, toffee-like and lactic sweetness. In a word: yum. A little on the watery side, in terms of texture, would've benefited from a milkier, creamier body. But still okay.

Head is a lovely off-white with tan tinges, tight bubbles, a little lacing.  S - nice, complex aroma. Malty roastiness, chocolate, toasted nuts. Almost smells like toasting graham cracker cookies. Wonderful hint of smoke in the back, but not extremely powerful. Maybe a slight earthy hop aroma in there, but malt is up front here. Nice to see that from a Stone brew.  T - rich, smooth maltiness. Chocolate flavors, malt sweetness, roasted coffee, balanced out by a tart bitterness at the end. Hints of green apple/acetaldehyde, roasted nuts, slight smokiness. Not a ton of hop flavor, maybe some English earthy/flower.  M - medium to thick bodied, bordering on the size of a small stout. Extremely rich and smooth beer, almost tastes like oats were used in this to get that smooth, oily consistency. Carbonation appears low to moderate.  D - flavorwise, I wouldn't mind having this beer everyday, it's that tasty. To me, this is what a strong porter should taste like.

The head that formed is fairly thick and creamy, tan coloured and leaves plenty of lacing. Can't do much better than that.  The smell is full of roasted malt, giving a coffee bean and bitter chocolate impression. Smoke is in there, but faintly. Overall a good porter smell.  The beer presents a fairly traditional porter range of flavours. Coffee and chocolate flavours that run from semi sweet to slightly bitter as they cross the tongue. Hops are relatively subdued, but there is enough to create balance. Smoke appears in the aftertaste and is not overdone. There is a slight downer though, as faint staleness lingers on the tip of the tongue, only showing up after swallowing. The stale flavour reminds me of tap water that has sat out for a while. This isn't a major complaint though, it just takes away slightly from the overall effect.  Mouthfeel is bang on. If every porter felt like this one I'd never be disappointed. Carbonation is quiet and there is enough body here to make it feel chewy. Fills the mouth and is comfortable over the tongue.  Top notch beer, without a doubt. The one little slip in the taste is the only thing that I would change if I could.

Smell  The first scents up front are mainly roasted malt and coffee. There is a bit of smoke as well with hints of bitter chocolate. These aromas definitely make me want to drink this beer.  Taste  Now I know why this is called Smoke Porter. Although it was not a present in the smell, the smokiness of this beer is quite obvious when sipped. There are subtle chocolate and coffee flavors hidden away nicely just to compliment the smokiness. Roasted malts are there too with a nice bitterness. Somewhere in there I get sweetness...perhaps from caramel malts. Bitter and burnt feelings are left on the palate after this beer is swallowed.  Mouthfeel  This beer is a touch tingly on the tongue which takes away from the overall effect. The body is good though as it has a nice delicate creaminess.  Drinkability  Very good. The beer is easy to drink for me. It is robust but my glass emptied fast.  Glad I had a chance to try this. It is a very good beer and if I can get my hands on it again I will.

T: Tastes smoky, like how stuff BBQ'd with mesquite charcoal. Slight bitter aftertaste. Also some dark chocolate flavors. M: Medium to heavy bodied. D: Smell was nice, however the taste didn't do much for me really. Never been a fan of dark chocolate and there were a lot of the same flavors in this beer as are in dark chocolate. I've had better porters, but overall not too bad, something different than the norm.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Smoked Porter,89
147,90,orfeu,4.35,"Bloody brown with a thick but fizzy tan foam cap. Aromas of chocolate and black malts; some earthy/floral hops make a showing as well. Toasted cocoa and chocolate cake batter up front in the taste with an earthy compost-like hop flavor following. Sharp mineral twinge at the finish. Smoke flavor does not emerge until late in the aftertaste. On a second sip, however, it seems that a foretaste of the smoke is detectable in between the sweetness of the cocoa-inspired malts and the bitter hops. Okay, no, as the beer warms, the smoked flavor really does emerge, but not too strongly -- it permeates most of the sip, but only in a gentle, ""Hey, I'm a smoked porter, remember?"" sort of way. Medium body and silky mouthfeel overall. Without a doubt, one of the top American porters. Matched nicely with smoked gouda on pumpernickel. ""Enjoy by 1 05 05."" Whoops. Held up pretty damn well for sitting on a shelf for a year past its drink-by date.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Smoked Porter,89
147,90,ernie,4.4,"Tried it on a train. Yes, Santa Fe Railroad, travelling from San Diego to LA. Everyone who's planning to hit this railroad must take into consideration that chouce of beers is simply wonderful. Well, I loved it - strong and potent, with smoky aroma, coffeish taste and great black color. I agree that the taste could be even greater, but on a hot sunny day it was already larger-than-life. Recommended!",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Smoked Porter,89
147,90,leedorham,3.88,"The beer pours a coffee black with a strong head that dissipates quickly with no lacing. I can definitely smell the ""Smoked"" part of the aroma but not much complexity besides that.  I like the taste but could do with a bit more of it. It tends to fade pretty quickly into the background. There is very little bitterness which fits the overall character of the beer. It goes down very easily. I feel like mixed nuts would go very well with this beer but have none on hand. Bandon cheddar will have to do.  Overall this is a very easy, tasty, uncomplicated beer to drink. Complexity would probably take away from it. Well done.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Smoked Porter,89
147,90,petemorris,4.35,"A truly excellent porter, one that will at least cause me to pause before automatically reaching for Anchor's. The aroma immediately said ""Stone"", with a sweet spicy (mango chutney?) melody harmoniously laid on top of a classic roasted-coffee porter background, and a strong hint of smoke. It pours beautifully dark and clear, with a nice creamy head which subsides quickly into a drinkable thin film. Even though served quite warm, the flavor and mouthfeel didn't quite live up to what my eyes and nose had promised--I prefer porters that pack just a little bit more sweet, roasted maltiness--but it was still quite good, with the smoke flavor again perfectly balanced. And it all finished very clean, making this one very drinkable porter.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Smoked Porter,89
147,90,jwc215,4.13,"Poured black in the center with ruby highlights around the edges. There was a fairly thin, but well-retained foamy white head. The smell was of smoky roasted coffee with a burnt charcoal aroma. The taste was of charcoal, roasted black coffee and a touch of chocolate. It was medium to full-flavored (almost rich - not quite there.) The aftertaste was smoky and burnt - almost gritty, while still being smooth. It does hit its goal of being a porter that is good for a barbecue or as a dessert. And, of course, the bottle is cool! This is a very good beer! IMO, it's not the best offering from Stone, but certainly a good, slightly different (but in a good way) porter, and worth the price!",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Smoked Porter,89
147,90,sagito327,4.37,"Finally tried this beast for graduation. Poured into a glass forming a thick, 1 1/2-2 inch head. Appearance was black, red around the sides. Head dissipates within a minute or two, leaving very little lacing. Smells of smoke, raisin, coffee and hops. Tastes very ""hoppy"", but nice. Goes down smoothly, though it is a very ""thin"" beer as far as dark beers go. The light feel allows it to go down smooth, and it is very satisfying. One of the better porters I have had, but I still think that if you like a full flavored dark beer, a stout is the way to go.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Smoked Porter,89
147,90,edmundfitzoil,4.08,"Stone Smoked Porter served up into a standard pint glass from a 22 oz. brown bomber bottle. I'll admit, I'm a little tired this evening, but American Porters are one of my favorite styles - Edmund Fitzgerald being the namesake that influenced my BA tag - so this should hopefully be a treat prior to lying down and returning to work in lesson than twelve hours from now.  The beer poured a seemingly pitch black, but proved to have a purplish red tinge when held up in the direction of the lamp across the room. The beer started with a wonderful finger and half of head that reduced to a quarter inch of tan head that retained throughout the drinking of the beer. This bad boy proved to be a mouthfull of porter goodness: a viscous, thick mouthfeel lacking much of a smoked flavor but included the complex maltiness I look for coming from this style: dark chocolate hints along with burnt malts and a nice dry hopped finish - expected from a Stone product. The texture is decadent creaminess without being overly so.  Give me a few more of these, and I would love to see it on tap sometime. Stone's Smoked Porter is an excellent beer to enjoy as it warms, and even though the weather today proved to be hotter than I would have chosen, this beer still proves to be refreshing.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Smoked Porter,89
147,90,TheBungyo,3.81,"Pour is big and black with an inch thick tan head. Very easy on the eys. What I can smell of the nose is good, but too faint. I get smoke and raisins. Taste is espresso-like with a glimpse of sweetness that makes me think of raisins. It doesn't feel all that defined. The smoke is inconsistent. One minute you taste it, the next sip, you don't. Mouth is wonderful, as creamy as you could hope. Carbonation is light and dances over the tongue. Not nearnly as good as Alaskan Smoked Porter, but still, I could certainly have a couple glasses.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Smoked Porter,89
147,90,SilentSabre,4.82,"Absolutely amazing!!! This is everything I was hoping it would be and more!!. Black liquid with a khaki coloured, creamy head. Tiny carbonation bubbles cling to the side of my glass. Looked magnificent. The smell was incredible!! I have had a handful of things before with smoke in the title, only to be terribly disappointed to discover no smoke in either the smell or the taste. This had plenty of smoke, however, but just enough. I also got a little bit of a bready smell and some chocolate hiding in the back. Positively one of the best smelling beers I have had in a long time. The taste matched the smell with a nice ""meaty"" malt right up front and plenty of smoke. A small amount of caramel and burnt coffee make appearances toward the finish. Mouthfeel is very smooth with a fantastic level of carbonation. This beer is just amazing. I am thoroughly impressed, and sadened that this is not available in Ga.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Smoked Porter,89
147,90,JayTheFinn,3.8,"Nice and dark. Not quite stout dark, but close. Thick, fizzy, carbonated head. Roasty, smokey smell that tastes the same. Very rich malty flavor.

147,90,stcules,4.02,"Dark and porter appearance, with dark ruby reflexes. A lot of light brown foam. Very good smell, cocoa, coffee (less) and obviously smoked. Very pleasant. The taste is very good too, with roasted notes, cooa, and a good smokiness that rises up behind. Resolute. Some sweetness (just a hint), quickly covered by the rest. Interesting. Behind, some bitterness, not hop-like, more from burned and roasted. And again cocoa. Same in the aftertaste (cocoa, smoked), and a noticeable bitterness, quite long, with rhubarb hints.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Smoked Porter,89
147,90,scottoale,4,"Out of the 22oz.brown bomber pours a blackish-brown heft of a porter. Light brown bubbling, foamy head rises up, then eventually subsides to some nice, sticky lacing.  Smokey oak malt up front with chocolate and coffee coming through and blending in a mildly sweet manner...ahh. After it warms a bit, faint aroma of the hops sneek through, as well as some alcohol.  Initially dark malt, which is smoky and faintly sweet, fill the mouth. It becomes coffee and chocolaty rich in flavor till the smokyness comes back in, with a nice bitter hop, to finish it off. A sturdy, well balanced porter with a complexity all it's own, smoky to boot.  Full bodied with a smooth, lofty mouthfeel and a pleasant ABV make this a Porter lover's ""must try"". It's unique and goes down smoothly...cheers!",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Smoked Porter,89

The smell is bold, roasty, smokey and malty.  The taste is just a blast of flavor to the taste buds with all the flavors the smell gave away. Supurb mouthfeel due to the creamy head retention, one-of-a-kind. This is maybe the most drinkable porter out there with Bell's.

The smell has dark chocolate and a very smoky hickory wood aroma with a hint of alcohol getting through. I really enjoy the taste. The smokiness reminds me of Laphroig scotch, like you are drinking smoked peat moss but this is dipped in dark chocolate.

Smoky, chocolate, and coffee aromas come through witha touch of spicy hoppiness at teh end of each scent. The taste is very, very, very good. The sweet taste of chocolate, with hints of coffee, then followed by the smoky flavor that finishes each taste.

T- Nice balance of malt smoke and hops make this a good tasting porter, but I would like to have more smoke taste noticable.  M- Very smooth and creamy feeling, like eating a bar of dark chocolate.

147,90,jhammerly,3.23,"Pours a very dark brown with a nice cocoa-like head. A sweet smelling beer that tends to be too sweet, and a bit of roastiness that is expected in this type of beer. I didn't detect much smokiness, which I was looking forward to. There was also a lack of smoke in the flavor as well. Some light bitterness and roasted malt was present. Mouthfeel was medium, but not much. I could maybe settle for 12 ounces instead of 22. The bomber was a bit much. I was disappointed by the lack of smoke flavor and the sweetness. But all in all, it is still a good beer in smaller doses. Probably my least favorite from Stone.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Smoked Porter,89
147,90,Knuckles,3.4,"I always feel like Flavor Flav whenever I review a beer from Stone, as I continually want to shout, ""Don't believe the hype!"" Now, mind you, I'm not opposed to Stone and the things they brew, I'm just not a card-carrying member of the ""Stone = Great Beer"" club. I'm a Doubting Knuckles, or some damn thing. What I continually find is that they brew some very decent beers, but try as I might, I just don't love them (although I will admit to liking the RIS, and want to cellar a bottle at some point). The Smoked Porter is yet another one of those beers that I wanted to like, but ultimately found lacking.  It suffers greatly, in my opinion, from the fact that most beer drinkers are going to compare it to the Alaskan Smoked Porter. And if they do, they will be sorely disappointed. This beer is a much more traditional porter in terms of color, ABV, and flavor profile than the AK.  Appearance: Held up to the light, this beer is a gorgeous, deep ruby (note to self: come up with a different color than 'ruby'. You use it to goddam much.), and pours with the always popular espresso creme head. I get about three fingers of foam, that linger for about ten minutes or so, and then slowly fade away. My only real complaint with the beer is that it is filtered. Don't axe me why, but I do love the look of an unfiltered porter. It makes me feel so Victorian.  Smell: The nose is actually the only place I get any hint of smoke, and it is very, very pleasant. Starts off with a deep, malty nose, and then finishes up smoky. Very nice.  Taste: As a smoked porter (and actually, as a porter), this one really drops the ball in my opinion. I was actually a little surprised by it, as it was a fairly one-note beer. The peat smoke that is supposed to be prominent was almost non-existent in this bottle, and contrary to it's 5.9% ABV, it had an incredibly malty palate. Once it warmed up it got a little smokier, but not nearly enough for me.  Mouthfeel: Again, somewhat in contrast to the maltiness of the beer itself, it was rather thin in mouthfeel. I wanted it to be a little richer in texture to balance out the flavors, and it just wasn't.  Drinkability: Honest, I really want to find a Stone beer that I like so I can write really nice things about it, if only to give the impression that I'm not a blanket Stone hata. But the sad truth is (so far, anyway), that for my palate, their beers lack balance. That lack of balance seriously affects the drinkability in my opinion, and this beer is no exception to that rule. It is not a bad beer by any stretch of the imagination, but not one that I will probably seek out again.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Smoked Porter,89
147,90,TastyTaste,4.35,"On-Tap at dba New York City. The best smoked beer I have ever had the opportunity of trying. Very dark brown body, medium tan head.

147,90,Ego,3.95,"music: King's X - Ear Candy  bomber for $3.99, now available in nj (and there was much rejoicing...)  served at perfect cellar temp (the one thing good about having a complete basement in states like NJ I tell ya..)  eyes... nearly opaque which is frankly surprising considering it didn't pour as dark as it now resides in the glass, one finger of darkish tan head quickly recedes to the rim of the chalice. good lacing with a thin film sticking to the glass like popsicle sticks to elmers glue... solid looking overall.  nose... a nice mellow smokiness, more like smokey coffee than smoked meat, chocolate covered caramel. it certainly smells better than a baboon's ass, or a three assed monkey's asses, that's for sure... almost smells like a cold cup of good coffee you left out the night before. Nothing overpowering just a lovely blend of aroma typical of the style. Not too sweet in the least and not too roasty either.  taste etc... like a lot of american porters this one tends to be a bit too thin for me personally to warrant a super high mouthfeel score (taste is a completely different issue). The carbonation is very good, bordering on too much but it doesn't bother these lips. On tap this is much more velvety... which of course would make this a world killer if every bottle tasted like that...  There is a more dominant hops prescence (not in a STONE beer? no... ?... kidding, obviously) in the flavor with the smoke only at the very backend after the bitters clear the dishes. The hop profile is almost the same as their other offerings, it tempts you to think ""too much hops for the style"" and then you settle into it just fine (well, if you like da hops).  verdict? very tasty, and the price is right. For a porter though I might go somewhere else... and also if I really want more smoke flavor I would definitely go somewhere else. But like most stone products this is plain solidly made in all the categories that count... personally it doesn't ""wow"" me however, although I enjoy it quite alot.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Smoked Porter,89

S - Smoky ont he nose at first with some chocolate underneath the roasty smells.  T - Very smoky on the first sip. In fact a HUGE smokiness, reminds me of the smell of a charcoal grill, or even a plank heated on the grill for barbecueing. Some malty flavors, like a chocolatey caramel kick but all have a great smoked taste to them. Even has just the right touch of piney hop bitterness. Lots of complexity here and done just right.  M - A nice feel in the mouth though a tiny bit light for this much flavor. Still pretty nice overall.  D - The smokiness and sheer complexity of all the flavors melding in this one makes you want more. Would also pair with many types of food, be it smoky grilled meats all the way to sweet deserts.

When holding the glass up to the light, you could barely see through it, but there was a slight red color that did come through.  The aroma was great very malty with a slight smokey scent that helped distinguish this from other porters.  The taste of this beer was great, a little hop flavor and nice malty taste that made a perfect balance. The after taste was very nice with a slight hoppyness.

The slight taste of hops helps to balance everything and make for an awesome porter taste. I always try hard to find the smokiness in a beer that has ""smoke"" in the title, but this one had it without ""looking"" hard for it.  Mouthfeel: This is a big porter with a big smooth body. The smoothness is quite silky and definitely incredible.  Drinkability: One is plenty, this porter is too big to attempt a session but you can enjoy this beer for a while, mine lasted just as long a three or four lighter bodied beers would have.

A good head that quickly hides to the edge of the glass. Left good lacing though.  I suggest letting the beer sit and warm a bit. Helps out the smell and taste. Has a rich and robust smell with good malt presence. A good smokiness that mixes with some of the roasted and black malts. Not much on hops.  The taste is thick and a bit bready. A strong malt presence with the smoky flavor becoming more noticeable. This doesn't completely hide some of the roasted flavors, which are a bit harsh and astringent. A good mix between the two, but the smoked malt having more notice. The finish is smooth with a very small hot bitterness to it. A somewhat woody afterglow.

Doesn't hold for very long but laces the glass nicely.  Smells of coffee with cream with some smoke in the background.  Tastes similar, though the smokiness becomes more pronounced. Along with it come nice sweet coffee tastes and a thick creamy mouthfeel. Drinkability is only limited somewhat by the smoke flavor, which I find to be a tiny bit artificial in flavor. It tastes good, but after a pint, I've had enough.  Definitely among the upper rung of smoked porters, though perhaps not the pinnacle.

Loads of burnt malts and earthy hops, but the roastiness takes over through the finish, even slightly acrid. Fairly dry. Body is a bit thin for my tastes, carbonation medium. Fairly drinkable, but would be more so with a little less sharp roasted malts. A pretty good porter, but i was hoping for more smoke (a lot more smoke).

147,90,beermanbrian,4.09,"Black color, tan head. Almost no head retention and no lacing at all, I expected a little better on both points. Smell of roasted coffee, black licorice, smoked wood (of course), plums and cherries. The smoky flavor takes over the taste up front but then a coffeeness fills out the finish. This is probably due to the bitter hop bite at the end. Mouthfeel is pretty full as would be expected. Fills all the expectations for a porter with the added smoke flavors as a bonus. An all around solid beer that I could see going back to when I'm in the mood for a porter.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Smoked Porter,89
147,90,DogFood11,4.08,"Huge frothy sticky head, spider web lacing, SOS pad may be required. Meaty deep dark brown to black, mild carbonation.  Guess what? yep, its smokey in the nose. Not the charred burnt wood type but more of a salmon smoke house. Quality wood, no gas to speak of just bitter wood flavor. They brewed this perfectly, it still retains all of the porter qualities you would expect. Easily consumed, fairly light on the palate, all things considered. In true stone fashion it kicks up the hop profile. Hell Yeah! this is one fine brew and worthy of its praise.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Smoked Porter,89
147,90,bignick,4.2,"This is a very nice beer. It is full-bodied and full-flavored, but it is not over-the-top. The coffee roastiness is the dominant taste, but I also taste chocolate and (call me crazy) sublte fig. There is also a very mild smokiness to go along with it. This is a very drinable beer, and I am sure that it goes well with many meals.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Smoked Porter,89
147,90,Phyl21ca,3.33,"Bottle: Poured a medium-black color porter with a medium size foamy head with average retention. Aroma of slightly bitter hops with some very subtle smoke in there. Taste is also slightly bitter with a very subtle touch of smoke. I was honestly expecting a more smoky character because of the name of the beer. Also, I was expecting a hoppier porter based on previous tasting of Stone beers. A bit of letdown really.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Smoked Porter,89
147,90,BEERchitect,4.15,"A fantastic beer to revisit over and over again. This beer displays a beautiful blend of delicacy, flavor, and boldness that is always opportunistic but non-boastful.  The beer holds true to the look of better Porters. Very dark brown with deep mohogany highlights. Moderate carbonation delivers a more aggresive head than expected but then settles into a 1/2"" foamstand that lasts the session while leaving tons of lacing behind.  Interspersed aromas of cocoa, coffee, smoke, and caramelized malts take turns hitting the nose, giving different signals each time my nose comes close.  Flavors favor the Porter-like chocolate-coffee blend while settling onto a steadfast caramelly malt foundation. The smoke character never seems to attach to the taste, rather giving much of its character through the olfactories and the exhale sensation (beautifully woven into the beer). Light fruits of fig, date, and raison give some credence to the esters, but largely go unnoticed. Clean yeasty flavors give an undescript malt flavor that's difficult to describe.  The texture is full, rich, and round; though in a Porter kind of way. Bittered from a blend of hops and roasted grains acheive a nice balance without overdoing it (good restraint for Stone). Not heavy, thick or overbearing, this beer can be consumed quickly- maybe too quickly. But at a moderate alcohol, the head or inhebreation of the beer is quite digestable and tollerable.  This is a beautiful beer that does everything that is asked of a Porter, but then with the proper companionship of a campfire. A bit more fruitiness could have helped with the depth and complexity of the beer. I'd like to see this beer imperialized.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Smoked Porter,89
147,90,johnniemarg,3.8,"22 oz bomber poured into a pint glass.  Poured a deep, but not quite opaque, brown. A little red around the edges when the light hits it. Half inch light brown head dissipates quickly but leaves a frothy film on the top.  Lightly roasted malt (and a lot of it) aroma hits me first. Some chocolate and brown sugar. I can't make out the smoke in the aroma at first, but after I'm half way through the first pint the smoke starts to really stand out.  Roasted malt and coffee flavors at first. The smoke wasn't too apparent at first but comes out more as the beer warms. Not too sweet, not too bitter. But the smoke is never quite strong enough for me.  Medium body with a silky creaminess.  This is a good beer but far from my favorite from Stone.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Smoked Porter,89
147,90,ghostwalker,4.13,"Dark brown body, nearly opaque, deep ruby highlights. Light off-white/tan head, fairly large, subsides quickly. Not much lacing to speak of.  Nose is smoked malt, not too intense.  Flavor is rich and robust. Plenty of smokiness to go around. A festival of maltiness as well. Sweet and smoky, an interesting combination.  Mouthfeel is medium, fairly high carbonation. Not thick or chewy.  Drinkability seems OK at first. As I progress thru the bomber, I find myself drinking it faster. It is such a sweet and interesting flavor that I keep wanting to sample it, even taking small sips. I like it a lot. It's no Ruination, but it is still very good nonetheless.  Another great brew from Stone, not a clinker in the lot.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Smoked Porter,89

147,90,GreenWBush,3.89,"First off, if you think this is particuarly smoky try any (and every, they're great) beer from this brewery: Aecht.  Anyways, the appearance is a particularly dark brown ruby: some amounts of clarity. This defied expectation, as every other 'dark' stone beer is light-enveloping. Absurb amount of cling.  Nose is much creamier than I had envisioned. Bittersweet porter aromas, brown-ale maltiness, mild smoke blends right into the gooey fold.  More often than not I can't stand middle of the road porters. Clearly, Stone brews nothing middle of the road...Hoppy without being annoying or out-of-place. Muted astringency/metallic flavors I associate with style.  Finish is full, rich, albeit not particularly smoky at all. Great lingering harmonius finish. Just the bee's knees for a low ABV beer...sessionable.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Smoked Porter,89
147,90,supernaut,4.1,"Smoke Smoke and more Smoke.  A friend of mine who likes this style had commented that he had thought this offering from Stone lacked the necessary smokiness required to be a true ""Smoked"" Porter. He's Crazy.  Pours out a deep deep brow with a moderate head that laces the glass nicely. One whiff of this stuff and my stomach began to growl.  The first tastes that pop through are that of a mild ""breakfast blend"" style coffee, malt, even a toffee like sweetness, followed immediately by a dominant smokiness. Even perhaps a bit of peat pops through. Not unlike some similar tones picked up from my favorite Scotch. Very good.  Perhaps due to all the big beers I've been exploring lately, this guy comes across as incredibly drinkable and smooth. The finish is a bit on the dry side, but merely encourages another follow-up swig. The smokiness is very pleasant, and makes me wonder what my comrade was thinking.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Smoked Porter,89
147,90,TheManiacalOne,4.37,"22oz. bottle poured into a pint glass.  A: Pours a very dark brown, almost black with a thin beige head and leaves a good lace on the glass.  S: Heavy roasted coffee and chocolate smell with the smokiness that gives the beer its name. The malt comes through as well. Very nice!  T: The smoked flavor is what dominates in the taste with a mild bitterness, both of which stay in the after-taste. You also get a bit of dark chocolate in it. Not too sweet as some Porters can be.  M: Smooth, medium carbonation with a medium/heavy body and a little more crisp than most Porters that I’ve had. The fact that it’s not as sweet as most Porters lends to less of a syrupy & sticky feel that other beers of this style tend to leave behind.  D: It’s very easy to drink since it’s not too sweet, not too bitter and not very over-powering. However it is a bit filling, which is expected in the style. Overall this was a very good beer. Stone Brewing Co. does not disappoint. The beer represents the style well, while maintaining the brewery’s signature.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Smoked Porter,89
147,90,lpayette,4.17,"Pours a near black with a small off-white head.  Smells amazing. Cappucino, smoke, sweet chocolate, coffee, caramel. Getting hungry from the smell.

Exceptionally smooth and drinkable.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Smoked Porter,89
147,90,GreatPondBrewer,3.73,"Poured a drank dark brown without light showing through any part of the glass. There was a delectable cafe au lait head that receded into a slick across the top of the beer with some large bubbles sticking to the side of the glass. The smell held very little smoke in it. It was much more full of robust chocolate notes with a hint of alcohol tickling the back of the nose. Just a tad sweet smokiness as I breathed deeply. The taste was the same with much more bitter chocolate notes without much smoke to push through. It was very full bodied and a wonderful porter, but not smokey enough for the style. Enjoy!",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Smoked Porter,89
147,90,RoBotGod,4.11,"Has a great first impression. Pours thick and very sticky. Very dark brown and black in body but the nose doesnt pick up a whole lot. The lace is very soapy and thick. Great all around porter taste, leaves a very clean taste behind. The smoke didnt jump out at me right away but has built up towards the end. Excellent malt affect helps the beer go down smooth. Even though some look at it as a waste, it s great beer to cook with. I used this on ribs and it was stellar!",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Smoked Porter,89

Im pulling some smoky/roasted characters out of the nose, but nothing overpowering.  T: Not bad, but nothing realy dominating the flavor. Somewhat Roasted with some bitterness in there. Its almost like the flavors are hiding like when you drink a beer too cold, but this baby was pulled up from the cellar at 55 degrees so that cant be the problem here.  M: Thinner than I'd like.  Overall not the best porter I've had, but this is my first smoked porter and I'm curious to try others.

Black colored brew, with brown highlights as you raised it to the light, with a limited tan head. Nice rings of lacing.  Chocolate and dark cherry aroma. No real smokiness evident.  A very robust porter all full of chocolate, molasses and slightly overcooked caramel. Very creamy with some dried fruits evident as it warmed. Took a half point off, since it was called ""smoked"" porter, and I really didn't detect any smoked flavors coming off..  Medium bodied, leaving a sugary goodness in your mouth as it goes down smooth and creamy. Well worth several, if they were even distributed around these parts.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Smoked Porter,89
147,90,timtheenchanta,3.86,Pitch black with a decent sized head and thick sticky lacing. Nice heavy coffee and roasted malt smell. Slight smell of smoke but not nearly as much as I expected. Heavenly sweet taste with plenty of coffee and roasted malt. I'm disappointed in the lack of smoke flavor. Where is it? Wonderfully smooth mouthfeel. This feels good but misses a little on the smoked flavor. Disappointing in that respect but still great. Try this one but I don't know that I'll go out of my way to get it again.

A beautiful head of beige colored foam forms on top, with great lacing.  Aroma is chocolate and caramel candy, with a detectable level of smokiness. The smoke adds a nice touch. Fruity, with notes of dark cherries, dark raisins, and prunes. Smokiness increases as it warms.  Flavor is chocolate, dark molasses, and light smoke. The smoke character is a very nice touch to this beer. It's fairly sweet, with notes of cherries, raisins and plums. Aftertaste is long, sweet, and delicious.  Mouthfeel is smooth and creamy, with low to medium carbonation. There is a certain level of oiliness on the tongue. Finish is sweet and luscious.  This is a really delicious beer. The smoke is just enough to be noticed, and everything else is great. It's also a pretty beer.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Smoked Porter,89

Smell is roasted barley, a slight smoke aroma, some chocolate, and maybe even a bit of fig. There's a nice bitter hoppy aroma blended with some coffee notes as well.  The flavor is about what you'd hope for from this one...a rich, roasty smoke flavor coupled with a solid coffee bitterness and a dark chocolate taste. The hops are there, but somewhat overshadowed by the smoke.  Overall: Another tasty brew from Stone, definitely a yummy porter.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Smoked Porter,89

A decent sized head, evern taking the glass situation into consideration. Then turning to lace.  Definite smoke in the aroma, though not the bowl you over variety. Malts are there in the background.  A very balanced porter. The smoke is maybe subtle plus a half notch. Malts and some hoppiness contribute nicely.

More smokyness, a hint of bitterness rounds it out. Mouthfeel is a tad watery and thin but otherwise creamy, not very bubbly. Very very drinkable- an easy beer to have several of and not even realize it. Just tasty and lovely. Another fabulous brew from Stone.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Smoked Porter,89

What roasty character there is to me taste's like it's coming from the smoked malt rather than the typical black patent. A hint of sweetness and molassas. A slight drying bitterness finishes it up. I would have enjoyed more smoke in here...there could also be some better blending between the flavors....the bitterness isn't quite conected.  mouthfeel: it's nice, a bit watery but not overtly so.  drinkability: a bomber is enough, but nice to spend some time sipping this down.

I felt like I was out at a bonfire, inhaling the smoke then taking a sip of a nice rich porter.  Mouthfeel- Heavy and sticky, slightly cakey.

It builds a nice chocolatey head that subsides slowly and is very clingy to the glass. Aroma is very quite. Smokey sweet maltness and coffee bitterness.  Bitterness and sweetness are nicely balanced as you taste this beer. Caramel and coffee notes are obvious. Smokiness is not. I took this beer out of the fridge and it was too cold when I took a first few sips. Now that it had a chance to warm up a bit I find that I enjoy it a lot more. This one definitely should be served on a warmer side.  Even though I usually prefer in-your-face, strong smokey flavor of a rauchbier, I still enjoy this porter very much. Its light to medium body makes it very drinkable, and its balance makes mouthfeel high.

Good spicyness bringing up the rear of the smell.  Taste: The beer is nice and dry. Slight tones of chocolate and carmel peek there heads up. Lightly smoked at the end.

Poured out of the great looking bottle a dark black color. small bubbly head becomes creamy and smooth-looking. the whole thing looks fantastic. Odor is slightly smoky, but more like roasted malts. Also some wet oak log smell and molasses. Taste was smoky as all hell at first and then a hard malt bitterness and hints of chocolate. simple but great. i likey.

There must have been some residue in my glass because it vanished pretty quickly. The head was completely gone at some point during the half hour I spent drinking this beer.  The nose hit me as soon as I opened the bottle. Chocolate and smoke with a touch of sweet. The smoke was almost like a good single malt scotch.  The first sip was amazing. The complexities of malt and chocolate and smoke and coffee hit you all at once and then somehow they order themselves. The taste is complex and wonderful and thoroughly enjoyable. It only gets better as it warms up.  Mouthfeel is thick and chewy. This beer has substance. Hard to believe it is made with malt, barley, water, and yeast only. How come the Macros can't do this with all the ingredients they use?  I only rated the drinkability down on this because I don't think I could drink more than one every once in a while, but when I am in the mood for a smoked porter, I will reach for this one first.

The flavor features a fairly rich smokey character with a slightly fruity peat quality. The complex flavor also includes a bit of burnt caramel, some roasted coffee bitterness, and unsweetened bakers chocolate. While Im sure its in there, any hop bite in this beer is mostly eclipsed by the bitterness of the various burnt flavors. The mouthfeel is a bit thinner than I would have expected (I was anticipating thick, almost oily) though the subtle carbonation is right on target.  Not bad at all, one of the better smoked porters Ive run into, although its not like there are million of them out there.

Appearance: When poured into my Samuel Smith pint glass, it was black in color with ruby highlights all throughout the beer. I got just a small head of tan colored foam that dissipated fast, but did leave some rings and lace in my pint glass.  Smell: When I first popped the cap, I got a strong aroma of hops. When I poured it and after it settled, the hops aroma had faded into roasted malt, sweet caramel, and dark chocolate. Nice!  Taste: Bitter! Not bitter in a bad way, but in a good way. After all of that bitterness, there was plenty of dark roasted malts, dark chocolate, and some roasted coffee beans. After all of that, I thought I noticed some pine in there as well too.  Mouthfeel: All I can say it was thick with a strong bitter aftertaste that lingers on for a while.  Drinkability: I didn't notice much smokiness in this, but I don't care.

Nice color, and pours a thin light tan head of tiny bubbles that burst and fall to a thin covering after a few moments. I'd hoped for better head retention, but I'm somewhat biased toward any dark beer. Lacing is very minimal, slippery at best.  Smell is rich and flavorful; I can smell it from where it sits on the desk, tempting me for my first sip. Deep, lusty notes of coffee, chocolate, and smoky cinnamon! Fantastic!  That first sip is surprisingly smooth and light; I'm something of a porter newbie, and with that dark color and chocolatey smell I expect something thick and chewy, but to my surprise the carbonation, almost absent in the way the beer looks and forms its head, fizzes heartily to life on my tongue and swirls the crisp, light liquid around.  The first few seconds are almost tasteless as the carbonation comes to life, but when it fades away the true smoky nature of this brew is quite evident. Depending on your breathing, there are extremely distinct notes of chocolate and espresso, and sometimes an overpowering (to me) smokiness, especially as it warms - you can taste the oaky campfire smoke. Balanced okay - I'm rating the taste a 4 - I am certain now that smoked porter isn't my style, but if it's your style, you'll like it.  Drinkability is okay due to the light nature of this brew. Alcohol started to get boozy and intrusive as the beer warmed, leaving me feeling a bit queasy on the final sips, which wasn't helped by the rather overpowering taste of smoke.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Smoked Porter,89
147,90,bennetj17,4.2,"The smoked porter looks very dark black/brown with minimal head that forms a ring after a short while. The smell is mostly sweet, with a hint of chocolate, no smokiness to speak of. The taste is sweet, with a coffee accent, robust and toasty. Not overly smoky though, as the name would suggest. Its only mildly bitter at first, but give it some time. It feels thick on the tongue, smooth, and has a dryness to it. Good carbonation. Well balanced, it is a fine porter, but I feel the smokiness is too subtle for it to be named a Smoked Porter...",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Smoked Porter,89
147,90,yelterdow,4.47,"Served in an imperial pint glass at above fridge temperature.  Appearance- Dark brown, almost black with ruby hues at the very bottom of my glass. The head is surreal, displaying a generous three fingers of depth. Off-white (almost tan) and persistent, it laces nicely all the way down.  Smell- Huge chocolate and coffee notes, with a fantastic smokiness as an all-encompassing backdrop. Tremendous and deep, this simply rocks.  Taste- A rich, chocolatey malt character explodes on the palate, then gives way to a dark roasted coffee presentation. In the finish, we have a powerful hop bitterness that whips the sides and back of the tongue relentlessly... it lingers on and on for several minutes. That is my one and only complaint.  Mouthfeel/Drinkability- Very easy, foamy consistency that showcases the chocolate and coffee notes rather than get in the way of them. This porter is aggressive yet very well balanced, daring and memorable. For that, I give Stone's brewers a highly earned salute.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Smoked Porter,89
147,90,sockeye101,3.95,"Interesting beer, this one. Nice super dark color with only hints of deep red glinting through when held up to the light, head ws nice and lacing was excellent. Aroma was very pleasing giving off roasted coffee, chocolate, malts and an earthy nutty tone, very complex. The taste is initially coffee and chocolate with malts then a hoppy bitterness followed by a smooth smoky flavor and a trailing bitterness at the end. I've never experieced smokiness in a beer before, but it's not bad. Overall a good drink....",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Smoked Porter,89
147,90,masikon,4.23,"Pours nearly black, ruby highlights appear when held up to a light source. Head was high and profound, receding with much lacing looking wonderful in the glass. Nose was burnt in essence, as one would expect it was very earthy, mellow, and malty with hints of cocoa powder more than chocolate. Taste was surprisingly subtle for a Stone beer, usually they are more in the ""knock your socks of syle"" but this one's greatness lies in the subtle suggestions of cocoa and earthy wood with a distinct spiciness in the finish. Smoking is not overwhelming but adds a unique flavor component which makes the beer more interesting than most. Mouthfeel is medium, goes down smoothly... big enough that after two, I would probably be pretty full but that is generally true to the style. overall another great beer from Stone, more subtle than most of their offerings yet just as profound.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Smoked Porter,89
147,90,malty,4.5,"Pours a dark, dark brown with ruby edges. Fluffy & loose 1"" khaki colored head. Thick, beautiful lacing.  Scent is billowing over with milk chocolate, milk chocolate & milk chocolate. Vanilla & dark roasted malts a fastened-in quite nicely. Everything about this bouquet screams sweet & creamy.  All the scents mentioned above follow through in the flavor very accurately. A beautifully balanced hop presence counterweighs the chocolate & roasted malt flavors beautifully. There's also a splendid bitterness the hops provide that give it a full spectrum tasting experience; Creamy, sweet, dry & somewhat bitter. There is a sneaky smoky flavor that commingles with the hops making it camouflaged. I'd be hard pressed to think this was a smoked porter if it wasn't stated on the bottle.  Mouthfeel is delectable. How many times have I used the adjective 'creamy'? Well, I'll use it again for the mouthfeel. Carbonation is comprised of larger feeling bubbles and is on the tamer side of kinetic. A somewhat dry finish makes the long lingering roasted malts fade rather poetically.  Drinkability is top-notch. I'm going to finish the rest of this bomber sitting fireside in my living room right now.  Overall a stellar porter which I regret not having tried much sooner. This beer has everything for me. This is a creamy (there's that adjective again!) version of an Edmund Fitzgerald and then some - utterly fantastic!",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Smoked Porter,89
147,90,Phatz,4.23,"This beer pours black with a slight red glow around the edges. Nice 3 finger head, ivory in color, that lasted for a while. Smell had an interesting orange tangy smell that faded into the malts. mildly sweet. Pleasantly malty. Overall it is a mild hidden aroma. I would have liked to see it a bit more robust (but its American not English) and it was decent. The aroma did improved as the beer warmed. It was not noticeably smoked but a good American Porter. Taste is somewhat simple; not overly complex. Malty, sweet like soda (syrup-thin, not thick like a stout). A bit of bitter hoppyness at the end and in the aftertaste; just enough to make the sides of your tongue curl up a bit. The taste did not give away many hints that it was smoked. I only got a little hint of smoked in the aftertaste (and honestly, in a burp  which I probably shouldnt say). Since it is not a terribly interesting flavor (good though), its a good choice for when beer is not the only thing on your palate, with your dinner or desert etc. Mouthfeel is smooth and light, crispy and refreshing. Drinkability. It is a good flavor but not overly interesting. I think it goes down easy, low ABV; all attributes that make it a good social setting beer, for when your not paying as much attention to idolizing interesting beers. This was pretty sessionable though IMO.  Hope this is helpful. Cheers!",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Smoked Porter,89

Nice mocha head that just leaves islands in the brew, but great lacing.  Smell is dark chocolate and French roast coffee with a shot of espresso. Hops are somewhere in the very back of the smell, and it's kind of all filtered through some roasty smokiness.  Well hopped for a porter, which I like, but I think it's kind of under-smoked, if anything. In a blind taste test if I had to choose, I wouldn't say this was a smoked porter. The smoke just kind of lingers in the back of everything, and it's nice, but still, not really a presence.  Mouthfeel is a little thin, but still pretty good. Good carbonation.  After a pint of this at a pub, I probably wouldn't order another. It's good, but I'd want to try something new.  If I'm in a smoked porter mood, for awhile I'll stick to Brooklyn's.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Smoked Porter,89
147,90,barknee,3.91,"Pours dark mahogany with an initial mocha colored head, settling to a slick. Nose is not particularly smoky... more of a roasted element to it. Taste is very malty, well-roasted chicory flavors, chocolate and hops pushing their way throughout the mix. Actually this brew is quite bitter courtesy of mass-hopping. Medium in body, this brew has good weight to it and a persistent flavor profile. For a porter it is very concentrated and robust... chock-full of all things good and necessary in a brew of this style. The mouthfeel is lightly syrupy and slightly tannic, no doubt from the generous hopping of the brew. A very good though not monumental porter that the masses are sure to enjoy. (Are you sure it's only 5.9%.. ;-)",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Smoked Porter,89
147,90,Derek,3.98,"A: Ruby-black, plenty of tan head, only a little retention, but some nice lacing.  S: Dark chocolate malt, slightly fruity (like British yeast).  T: Predominantly dark chocolate. Slightly bready, some raisin, dark caramel sweetness beats the roasty bitterness into submission. Very well balanced (bittersweet). Only a hint of smoke in the aftertaste.  M: Moderate to full body, moderate carbonation.  D: As it warms, the boldness steps forward. It's a big brew with plenty of flavour. The 650 mL bomber is plenty.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Smoked Porter,89

A beautiful, deep rudy ruby umber, rich color, with a splotched, firm 1/4"" head of mocha hued foam that disappated quickly, but not immediatelty, a ghost slick of foam remaining on the surface & laced stubbornly on the glass edge. Nose is odd - sharp, burnt sugar bittersweet, a little edgy, maybe a wisp of smoke, not what I was expecting.  Its smoky nature is noticable on the tongue, especially the more it warms. A little peaty, hints of baking chocolate, bitter & crisp, yet somewhat level & flat. The bitterness (again, more like baking chocolate than hops) is on the pallete & throat as you swallow. Surprisingly, there is a very crisp, clean, dare I say a whisper of mint as an echo of an aftertaste.  This is an odd call. I love porters, but this one has me a bit confused, I would certainly drink it again, but would probably be more likely to take a chance on another porter.

Very dark, almost onyx black, but some hits of red with shown to light. ¾ inch head that looks like the coffee froth atop a well made espresso. The head settles as it should, particularly in the middle but leaves delicate lacing. Bidder sweet aroma with some charcoal notes. Starts with a sweet malt flavor, transitions into burnt brown sugar caramel flavor, and finishes smoky and dry. Slightly alcoholic. Soft yet big and a little bit chewy, a little bit sticky. Nice biter aftertaste and dry palate, alcoholic notes in the flavor do not compromise the drinkability.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Smoked Porter,89

Poured into an imperial pint glass, formed 1"" brown head above the clear, dark brown brew, with reddish highlights. Head lasts nicely, with delicate sticky lacing. Aroma is sweet, a bit boozy, with wisps of smoke here and again. Taste is vinous and sweet as well, with the smoke there, but shouted down by the syrupiness and alcohol notes. However, looking past the fact that I'd want more smoke, this was still a beer with a smooth mouthfeel, and good drinkability.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Smoked Porter,89
147,90,Jacobier10,3.23,"Brought this bottle back with me from San Diego. Mmmmm fresh Stone beer.  Dark brown pour with a small tan head. The head disappates rather fast, no lacing either. Surprisingly mild aroma. There's some roasted malts there, I just need to stick my nose into the mug to find them. Good taste, the malts taste more burnt than anything here. Some smokiness is noticable but it doesn't really strike me as a ""smoked"" beer. Mouthfeel is dry and doesn't amaze me.  Overall, I wasn't amazed with this beer. It's decent, but there's better available from Stone. I kind of wish I drank half of this and used the other half in a pot of chili. Mmmmm now THAT would have been delicious.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Smoked Porter,89

The taste is great with a robust character that ends with a crisp, dry aftertaste flavored by fruits.

More flavors and aromas become apparent as the beer warms adding new dimensions to the beer.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Smoked Porter,89

I would love to have this again sometime.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Smoked Porter,89

I suppose trying the Vertical first off the bat set the bar pretty high, as I had high hopes for the smoked porter. I enjoyed the porter - it just didnt quite live up to expectations.  There was really more of an oak taste than a smoked taste to this beer. But I'm fine with that. Very smooth and not all that heavy in the mouthfeel. Not overpoweringly rich, which is also a good thing.  I dunno... I just hoped for something a little more complex or ""deeper"" overall. This was still a great porter, but only slightly above the other better smoked porters I've had. It didn't blow away the competition like I thought it would.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Smoked Porter,89
147,90,goschool,4.32,"Smoked beers are not everyone's cup of tea. I quite enjoy a good smoked porter or smoked lager, but drinking an Aecht Sclenkerla Marzen was probably my worst craft beer experience. This Stone Smoked Porter is of the less overt family of rauchbiers.  The pour is ultra-dark mahogany. The head is tan and sticks around until the end. Roasted malts and enough, but not too much, smoke make up the welcoming nose. The taste isn't too far off. Malts- roasty with mild coffee and chocolate flavors dominate up front leaving the smokiness for the finish.  This stuff is remarkably smooth. The smoked flavor keeps it interesting, but it lowers drinkability ever so slightly. I don't think I could drink more than a bomber in a night and it's not something I'm going to crave all the time, but it sure can hit the spot",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Smoked Porter,89

If I were to rate it just by its porter characteristics (creamy body, subtle roastiness, beautiful coffee, chocolate, hops interplay) it would be over a 4 overall. However, the smoke quality, as subtle as it is, really spoiled it for me. I like smoked beers, and can appreciate using it as an ""element"" rather than the dominating factor, but the smoke in this beer tasted more like ash. This is still a GOOD beer and its very close to GREAT, but that final failing it very frustrating indeed!",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Smoked Porter,89

Honestly there's so much going on with the flavor that I really don't know where to start, however, if you like porters...you'll love this.  The mouthfeel is actually pretty light, with a moderate ammount of noticable carbonation. The aftertaste is the only place i really get any ""smoke"" from this brew and it manifests itself in the strange cola/charcoal aftertaste.  For a dark beer this is very drinkable, would go great with food prepared on the grill.  Hopefully Stone will either step up the distro, or another friend will make a trip to Cali.

The flavor, fortunately, is much improved over the smell, with a big smoked flavor, as promised by the title.

The beer pours to a nearly opaque black color with a thin off-white head. Leaves a decent lacing. Looks good.  Smells even better. For some reason that smokiness is hitting the spot. If only it weren't 1:30 AM and I hadn't just gotten off of work recently, I'd be eating some hand-smoked meat alongside this brew. Very robust. Nothing but malt and smoke in the nose... no hops, that is.  The taste only has a light bit of smoke, and the finish leaves a bit of an aftertaste like a campfire smells. I would think that sounds disgusting, however, I've grown very remniscient of that smell... oh, the wondrous parties I have thrown 'round the campfire down where the prairie meets the lake at my parents' acreage in the middle-of-nowhere Iowa when I was still in highschool and too young to drink, much less drink good beer (when I wasn't raiding my parents' beer stash, that is). This beer has a very mild campfire taste compared to other smoked porters I've had, however. There is still some chocolatey sweetness shining through, along with that musty-yet-delicious porter taste.  The mouthfeel is thin and smooth. The finish is quite wet and leaves some nice residual sugars which meld well with the smokiness. This is a good drinkable porter, but I think a single bomber is all I could ask for.

Dark brown, but not opaque, with a hefty brown head on there. Nice and bubbly. Smell and taste are loaded with complex chocolaty coffee notes and a nice smoke character that really separates this beer from others in the style. Really nice. Definately much hoppier than I expected as well, with a really killer bitterness not usually found in porters.

The smell is that of coffee and a mild smoky scent. Certainly not as strong of a a smoke scent as the O'Fallon (which is almost like a BBQ), but it's certainly noticable.  Flavor is super-smooth. Smoky is a little less pronounced that I'd like, but it's still certainly there and it adds a lot of depth.  I split a 22oz bottle of this but I could've easily handled the entire bottle myself.

The hop aroma is very apparant. It tastes more smokey than the aroma led me to believe. Coffee is also very noticable. It has a sweet caramel like taste to it also, but it is subtle. This beer leaves a smokey taste on the palate. It is slightly aggressive in flavor, I think due to the smoke. It is a little over carbonated.

Besides all that, I do enjoy your dark stuff, although their Barley Wine is pretty good as is their IPA....anyway...  I was pleased as I poured out this beautifully dark porter into my 20oz. glass. As usual the bottle talks about being worthy and trying new things, so since I already love their other stuff, I figured this would be a good go.  The head came up nice, and dissapated after a few minutes. The beer is dark, I'm talking black here. None of this Alaskan summer dark, I'm talking middle of the rain forrest, midnight and there's a panther out to get you dark.  Smelling the brew you can smell the hops that they use. Stone? Hops? No!! Ha.. Anyway. Yeah it's a hoppy brew, but all their stuff is, so that wasn't much of a surprise. Smells a little sweet too.  Obviously the first flavor that comes through it the smoke from the malt. It's pleasing and not overbrearing. It feels so good going down too. It's high in alcohol but not anything to worry about. It's thick and like velvet in your mouth. Slight carbonation helps bring out undertones of wood.  The aftertaste is quite smokey, but I suppose that's expected. I'm not a big one for the smoke flavor but this is a good brew. It's tasty, but I am glad that I split the 22 or I would have been on the floor with a smokey taste in my mouth. Not a good way to wake up :)",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Smoked Porter,89
147,90,Pegasus,4.3,"Appearance: Clear dark red amber color, with a moderate tan head, which retains well, excellent lacing.  Aroma: Deep toasted malt aroma, with prominent earth and smoke notes, sweet caramel, and quite understated hops.  Taste: Strong roasted malt at the open, caramel sweetness follows to midpoint of the taste. Later in the taste, an alcohol note appears, as well as bitter chocolate, smoke and earth flavors. The taste closes with a mild lingering bitterness.  Mouth feel: Smooth and dry, with soft carbonation, the body seemed thin for the style.  Drinkability/notes: Overall, quite excellent, would be very pleasing on a cold, dark, windy day.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Smoked Porter,89
147,90,charlatan,3.56,"Pours from 22oz bottle with generous head a decent proportion of which seems to be in for the long haul. This has a delightful peat colour.  The nose has a strong smoky smell. If I was generous I'd say chocolate malt is to the fore. If not I'd start moaning about coffee. As it is I'm sitting on the fence....so far.  And after tasting it I'm still sitting on the fence. Delightful creamy, chocolate malt start gives way to a coffee flavour with a hint of hoppy bitterness which renders it palatable. In case you hadn't guessed I'm not a big fan of the northwest's other liquid passion.  The carbonation is great, and coupled with the creaminess it makes for a great feel. I would be in love with this beer, but for my disagreement with most of the planet on the coffee thing.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Smoked Porter,89
147,90,blackie,4,"Forms a tan head. Black color lightening to a very dark shade around the edges.  Smells smoky, but not overwhelmingly so, alot like a regular porter. Lots of dark malts. Hints of sweet dark sugars, coffee, chocolate. The smoke is well balanced with the other characteristics of the beer.  Carbonation is a little less than average. Mouthfeel is on the thin side, but not bad.  Taste is of dark roasted malt with some hop bitterness. Hints of coffee and dark unsweet chocolate also present. Finishes with a lingering bitterness.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Smoked Porter,89
147,90,baiser,4,"Pours a dark, opaque, black body with a creamy tan head, good retention. Smokey, lots of coffee and chocolate in the nose.

147,90,rhoadsrage,4.42,( Served in an American pint glass)  A-This beer pours a dense black body with a nice tan head that holds in the glass.  S-Very nice smoky grain aroma with some deep roasted barley smell and almost a chocolate hint with it.  T- This has a great roasted barley flavor with some good depth of malts and a nice spicy hop finish that has a hint of smokiness with it. The finish hops have hint of tangy almost pineapple resin flavor but it is very faint.  M-This has a pretty creamy mouthfeel but no alcohol heat or astringency.  D-This beer is a spot-on-porter very solid on its own but the nice gentle smoke shows its present. The smoke is not overpowering and really compliments the deep roasted grain. Next time I'm in the distributing area I must stock up.,Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Smoked Porter,89
147,90,AlexJ,3.97,"Pours out like liquid black hole, impenetrably dark, with crimson highlights and a billowy tan head. Head retention is moderate with plenty of artisitic lacing.  The nose has bittersweet dark chocolate and espress notes mellowed by sweet campfire smoke. Well balanced nose with smoky nuances.  The flavor is roasty chocolate and coffee up front, with peated malt and beech-like smoke. Initially bittersweet, then mellowed by dark caramel and smoky highlights. Very balanced and smooth.  The body is mediumish, could use a little more. A full, smooth and creamy mouthfeel makes up for the lack of body. Slick and tongue coating. Makes me wish I had some good hardwood smoked ribs to go with this.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Smoked Porter,89
147,90,mushroomcloud,4.55,"I finally bought this on-line. It is not available in SA and I got frustrated reading and hearing so many good things about it. The beer poured out a deep dark brown with a little ruby tint when held up to the light. A 1"" tan head rolled away quickly and left little lacing. Beautiful beer. The smell at first was all about the roasted malt. Some coffee and earth aromas were prevalent. When I let the beer warm up I began to get the smoky smell out of it, maybe smoked meat or a light bacon. Very nice! The taste was love at first sip!!! This beer is outstanding. Wonderful roasted, earthy, coffee flavors followed by a NICE smooth chocolaty touch. The porter seems very lightly hopped to me, there is a nice bitter finish that hangs around for a long time. The mouthfeel was incredible. Smooth and velvety, it don't get no better than this!!! I would enjoy this on a very regular basis if it was available to me. This is a bad mofo!!!

147,90,ommegangpbr,4,"Tasty, smooth, smokey (toasted malts I suppose), with a signature hops bite that one has come to expect from the good people at Stone.

It's solid stuff.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Smoked Porter,89
147,90,TongoRad,4.01,"Ultimately a beer like this should be judged on how well the smoke character is incorporated into the base beer, and what sort of character that base beer has. On both of those counts this is definitely a fine beer.  The smoke presence is mild but definitely there. This is definitely conceived as a beer that one could do a session with- the smokiness never reaches an overbearing quality.  The base porter is also quite good and well balanced. Nothing is permitted to overpower the delicate smoke presence- neither the roasted malt, hops, caramel, yeast signature, etc, are overtly powerful. Therein lies a certain limiting aspect of this beer- intensity is sacrificed for drinkability. It's still freakin' good, though- put me down for a couple of bombers...",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Smoked Porter,89
147,90,Vancer,4.45,"Holy Smoly, my first Stone, and my first smoked brew. A great start, the stone black pour produced a superb head  one that laced the pint glass all the way down. A chocolate malt aroma transcends over into the taste, along with coffee, light charcoal, burnt toast and the infamous smoky peat finish that gives you a small kick in the sack. Although thick and chewy, the light carbonation makes for a good session brew, or a one bottle afternoon  as long as youre in the shade.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Smoked Porter,89
147,90,HardTarget,4.38,"Bottle Inspection: Standard Stone Philosophical musings, but no useful information like abv, date, etc.  Aroma: Smoke is at a great level, mild but definitely noticeable, and blends well with a firm dark malt base with some of the burnt porter characteristics.  Appearance: Ruby amber glass with surprisingly nice clarity. The rocky tan head held deep into the glass and laced nicely.  Flavor: Malt is a bit sweet and the hops are juicy and citric. Not enough of the burnt characteristics to really nail porter. The smoke adds a wonderful depth with hints of tobacco, leather, and chocolate.  Mouthfeel: Medium body, creamy texture, low carbonation and just a touch astringent.  Overall Impression: Very enjoyable drink. A great spring/fall sit on the back porch with a cigar or some fish kind of drink. I had to work hard to sip and not just turn it up and DRINK it. Great drinkability, Ill have to work on a way to get some more out here in Texas. Well done Stone!",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Smoked Porter,89
147,90,gimmehead,3.58,"Pours an inky black with a big frothy mocha colored head, lots of lacing. I was a little disappointed by the aroma. The expected smokiness is present, but very subdued. Instead of an assault on my olfactory receptors it was almost as if I had to sort of seek the aroma out. There was an acrid bitterness with a little sweetness underneath, and maybe a little black licorice. Tasted of bitter smoked malts, again not much intensity, and an acrid charcoal bitterness, that is not at all unpleasant. Just a hint of sweetness that I can't lay my finger on. Underwhelming. Medium to thick mouthfeel with just the right amount of carbonation. This is a mild beer in every regard, something that seems out of tune with the rest of Sone brews. This is the first Stone beer that I haven't been impressed with. In fact, this is pretty unimpressive IMO.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Smoked Porter,89
147,90,karengarys,4.5,"...so I was looking for an imperial stout at my local store... The store was out... Hmm... I never tried the stoned smoked porter, what the heck.  WOW!!!!  I'm drinking this too fast to review! ...And my my my, this has become a favorite of mine....  It pours dark brown almost black from the 22oz bomber, leaving some carmel colored foam. It dissipates, leaving a ring which laces on the glass quite a bit. Small foamy islands float about the top.  it smells nice and roasty and malty and smokey with lots of sweet something. Molassis? ...not sure, but it smells yummy.  Taste is very nice and rich. Nice and malty and smokey and robust. It has a complex sweetness that just hits the spot.  Mouthfeel is creamy. The robust sweet taste plays into some coarseness at the beginning of the drink, which turns into a velvet blanket. It is really good!  Needless to say this has a very rich, robust body. The finish is a sweet dissipation in fizz, followed by a slight bitter whap. Unfortunately there is a slight aftertaste, but the next sip takes care of that.  I recommend trying this if you are into rich dark beers, or want to experiment with a fine porter with a smokey twist. If you like to stick with the macro brewerie's light varietes - beware - this will smack your senses silly with rich wonderful flavors.  Also note - if you find it in a store, and are considering it - BUY ONE! They are hard to come by. yes, $5 can be considered a lot to lay down for one big beer, but it is a very worthwhile purchase for both your enjoyment and for the support it provides to our fine American hand crafted breweries.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Smoked Porter,89
147,90,hungryghost,4.27,"Pours a very dark brown, with a nice head that floats for a bit. Lacing is light but evident. Smells roasty, smokey, toasted and malty. The aroma is not as heavy as the taste, i still think it gives a good idea of what is to come. Serious smoke flavor, coffees, chocolate and roasted malts. Occasionally i get a bittering but it does not seem like a hop flavor. Nice light amount of carbonation helps make for a smooth beer. Not too heavy/thick in the mouth. This is a very drinkable brew. I had my second glass with some smoked gouda. Yumm!",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Smoked Porter,89
147,90,JackStraw22,4.06,"Appearance: nearly pitch black body, slighty translucent near the bottom of the glass. Nice head of tan foam with great retention and some good lacing to boot.  Smell: Lots of chocolate, buttery and a little bit yeasty/earthy. Not a lot of smoked aroma.  Taste/Feel: This really has a bite to it. The smokey taste is upfront, but really manifests itself at the end. The smokey character has an almost metallic quality to it, which is a little dissapointing. Edit: now that it's warmed up, that metallic taste has dissapeard and turned into a warm smokey flavor. The residule smokey flavor that lingers is very nice. Some slight bitterness, but nothing big. Full mouthfeel, a little sticky.  Drinkability: Great, though coming in the larger bottle size, one is plenty.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Smoked Porter,89
147,90,DrJay,3.9,"Clear, very dark brown, nearly opaque, with very nice deep ruby highlights. Light brown head of fine, dense bubbles that show excellent stickage to the glass with very good retention. Malty, roasty aroma with a little bit of smokiness. Very light american hop aroma as well. Malty flavour up front with plenty of roasted and chocolate to start, moderate sweetness. Bitter smokiness appears at the midpoint and carries through to the finish. Light bitterness from the hops, balance is more between the malt and charcoal smoke, which hit a nice balance towards the end and carries through to a long, drying finish. Medium body and medium-light carbonation. Fairly smooth, creamy texture. I really appreciate that the smoke aroma and flavour feel like a balanced part of the beer rather than just an afterthought that was dumped in at the last minute, but admittedly smoke in a beer is not really my thing.  22 oz. brown bomber, no apparent best before or freshness date.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Smoked Porter,89

The Stone barleywine label and Gargoyle stand out in gold to nearly match tan web of lace on the opposite side of the Rastal crystal sniffer.  Not giving up much in aromatics other than malt. Saving back a little in the 22 oz bomber, I will later return to the nose.  Sweet malt arrives followed by caramel, chocolate and coffee - then lightly bitter black lightly smoked malt. Mouthfeel is medium and creamy with correct carbonation for the porter style. Hops and light smoke diffuse in the ""goodbye"" of a pleasant aftertaste.  Second pour the warming aroma is chocolate, caramel with ""soft peat"" smokiness.

147,90,unklesyd,3.9,"When I cracked this one open, I was sitting on my back porch. Someone had just lit up a BBQ, by coincidence, which seemed appropriate in accompanying this brew.  Poured well and sat in a Guinness glass with a creamy chocofoam-cream head a nice opalescent off-black.  The smoked malt was present in the nose, though subtle.  Surprisingly fresh hop profile for a porter. Tonic notes on the tounge that complemented the subtle dominant of the smoky notes of the malt in the aroma.  Just slightly thin, not overly, and appropriate for the style. More alcohol heat in the throat than expected for a brew of this ABV.  A good brew, but for as blended it was in flavor, I felt just-slightly-uncomfortably full after the bomber, so marks off for drinkability.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Smoked Porter,89
147,90,Wonka,4.2,"1 Pt. 6 Fl. Oz. From a 12-beer Stone sampler I enjoyed the gargoyle and product breakdown on the glass.  Appearance - deep, dark red with little permeability in the core; impressive and lasting cream-colored head; great lace  Smell - chocolate malt with a nice smoky tone  Taste - chocolate,smoke and hops intertwine; more hoppy than most porters I have sampled, especially in the close and aftertaste; smoke shows most late and lingers to the aftertaste along with dark chocolate; pleasant balance  Mouthfeel - more full than most porters I have experienced, especially in the front and close  Drinkability - smoke and hops in the close pull back the revisit process  Overall, SSP was one that pushed the boundaries of the porters that typically cross my palate. SSP is a more exciting sensory experience.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Smoked Porter,89
147,90,shirfan,4.12,"Dark, dark ruby, only the edges of the glass allowed light to penetrate.  A rich, malty aroma lurks under hearty smokehouse notes.  Fairly thick-bodied with a strong herbal astringency and hints of old fireplace ash. On the dry side. A little baker's chocolate and mild leafy hops in the finish.  Not especially smoky compared to some German imports, but interesting all the same.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Smoked Porter,89

No djinn issue forth. No gargoyles. Just a deathly black liquid that oozed into my goblet. Up from the stygian abyss arose a tan cream which frothed and bubbled incessantly, screaming into my conciousne...  Awww geezus, this sort of discourse happens every time I drink a stone brew. I have to stop that.  The aroma is very rich, comparative to a cheesecake. There is a whif of smoke and very little hop aroma. Some roasted malts similar to coffee hits me.  The taste is very full and complex. Lots of roasty and smoked malts with some hop bitterness. The mouthfeel is the best. This is such a heavy brew and not for the faint of heart. I love it.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Smoked Porter,89
147,90,dauss,4.7,"Presentation: Standard 22oz. silkscreened brown bomber. Gargoyle on the front and a funny blurb about porters on the back.  Appearance: Just a shade from pitch black. Very large fluffy tan head that ""egg cartons"" as it falls. Excellent retention and tons of lacing.  Aroma: At first all I got was this lucious sweet chocolatey coffee and roasty porter. Another close whiff and there was the smoke. I can't tell what kind of smoke, but it was very subtle in the background and not overpowering. Smells amazing.  Taste: Very silky smooth. Larght carbonation in the taste. Very thick and very full bodied. Sweet, rich, chocolately, light coffee flavor. Hop bitterness and flavor comes out in the middle of the taste and leaves a sweet light bitterness. Smokey and roasty finish.  Notes: Wow, just wow. Absolutely wonderful porter. I don't know why they said its smoked, because you can't really notice it unless your paying a lot of attention. I love the hopiness in the beer. Loads of hop flavor and a bitterness that matches perfectly with the massive malt backbone. Very subtle smoke, unlike the smoked porter that Alaskan Brewing has. Nonetheless, I would buy a case of this stuff in a heartbeat.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Smoked Porter,89
147,90,beercollector,3.91,"This looks like a stout very dark, opaque with a lighter head than I would expect.  Very good malt and light smoke smell.  The taste is much lighter than my favorite Alaskan Smoked but very drinkable. It has a smooth creamy texture that lingers quite a while. It has a toasty taste with the smoke coming on late.

147,90,uncleozzy,3.86,"Thick, tan head quickly subsides to about 1/4"" of foam that leaves a moderate amount of lacing on the glass. The beer is dark, almost black, but shows through ruby-red when held up to the light.  This beer started off almost refrigerator-cold, and the initial aroma was almost non-existent. As it warmed, the smell remained subtle, but hinted toward chocolate and espresso. I'd almost say that the aroma (delicate) was wildly inconsistent with the flavor (very, very big).  At first taste, while still quite cold, I was absolutely blown away by the sweetness. With strong chocolate and cherry flavors, I would almost characterize this beer as tasting like Dr. Pepper or Cherry Coke when cold. As it warmed, flavors shifted more toward the chocolate and dark coffee end. Hop flavor was more prominent as it warmed up, and throughout, the mouthfeel was smooth and thick.  Throughout the tasting, whether cold or warmer, the beer retained a strong smoky flavor that shared the powerful finish with a wallop of hop bitterness. This beer sticks with you long after the sip, bitter as all get-out.  Overall, a well-balanced, solid beer, whose initial over-sweetness was tempered first by the smokey flavor and then by the hops. A long, bitter finish, though, hurt the drinkability: I would never consider this a ""session"" beer.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Smoked Porter,89
147,90,blitheringidiot,4.18,"Another props deserving big ole double deuce browner bottle with sci-fi meets classy painted logo and novela story about dark beers on the back. Into me pilsner like a black ruby gem quality with a clear yet dark appearance. Zero carbonation pour with no bubbles escaping under a taunt khaki 1/8"" head cap coating, leaving a spider web lattice lace down the glass. Second pour erupted a huge rock solid tan spumescent head cap.  Medium scents of roasted malts and toasted burnt black wheat bread.  First swigs: Roasted malts and dry cocoa chocolate milk powder flavors start off the swiggin'. Spice wafer flavors and slight orange peel finish off the flavors. Grainy dusty and mixed nuts notes on the tongue. Dry short-lived slightly smokey aftertaste. Some hop balance creeps out after a search. As warmed, some coffee and cream tastes overtake the flavor.  Medium bodied believe it or not, but creamy feel. Adequate carbonation. Hidden completely is a 5.9% ABV that limits the drinkability, but overall enjoyable and well done.  Last swigs: Hickory bacon hints blend into a toffee porter. Too often smoked porters are aggressive but a middle of the road style is quite respectable.

As much as these guys brag... more hops doesn't always mean better fellas.  Pours a very nice and dark brown, pretty much black, with amber tones around the sides of the glass. A thick and fluffy light tan accompany with good retention, also lots of sticky lace. Nose is smooth, malty even, wafts of smoke and just a little hop character as well. Taste is just a little bitter, more hops than in most porters. Lots of slick malt, smoke and dry, black coffee flavor, tons of roast. Finish is smooth, no alcohol detected. Mouthfeel is medium and quite clean.  Not a bad porter at all, pretty good really in many ways, a good amount of complexity, definatly worth a taste.

Definitely not the most exciting part of this brew. Very light notes of coffee and smoke.  Nice complex taste. Toasty malts, thick and toasted and very bitter. Salty, thick feel. But very sweet, corn syrup-like sweetness that seemed too much to me. Smokiness arrives in the mouth and continues in the after, blended with bitterness and metal. After doesn't seem totally balanced, with a quick injection of weedy hops amongst the smokey bitter. Slightly chewy.

Taste also smooth lightly roasted malt some caramel mingle with smokey flavors for a nice tasting treat just plain good, nothing extraordinary just a good poter. Finish is linger hops mixed with smoke and some roasted coffeee flavors.

An inch of tan head billows and slowly subsides to a tight 1/4"" of foam. Great retention. Quite appealing.  Smell: There is a nice sweet malt smell to this, some nice chocolate notes and a dull smokehouse scent. Again, nice.  Taste: The primary flavors in this smoked porter are not all that different from a standard porter. Definitely chocolate, some cherry, strong espresso towards the end. Then, in the aftertaste and more in the beer itself as it warms comes the smoked flavor. It's slightly acrid, adds a sharp quality, and really tastes of smoke. Put this with some smoked gouda and you found a match made in heaven.  Mouthfeel/Drinkability: This is very good, it has a nice light body without the flavor being too much. Nice carbonation keeps it smooth, and this is immensely drinkable. The only thing that might start to bother is the smoked taste. One bomber and I was still ready for more, but some may be put off by the smokiness. I think this is excellent. Still waiting to try the Alaskan, however.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Smoked Porter,89

A deep dark black with a thick two-finger tan and beige head that lasted atop the sample for its duration and left ample lacing as well.  A very nice smell. Similiar to BBC coffee house porter. Aromas of coffee, chocolate, mocha, carmel, and coffee.  Each frangrance of the smell backed up by a facet of the taste and well balanced to boot. Strong black coffee up front and softer delicate chocolate, caramel, and toffee in the background but enough to make themselves known.  Heavy on the palate with almost no carbonation to speak of.  Very easy to drink but very filling. Had another sample from the pitcher and that was the perfect amount for me in one sitting.

147,90,NEhophead,4.18,"Creamy brown head that really holds until the last sip. Semi-ringed and spotted lacing throughout the pint. Deep opaque black in color.  Milk chocolate, toffee, peat smoked malt, and roasted coffee beans. A very good variety of aromatics going on here, but they're just a bit too reserved.  Coffee, toffee, chocolate, a drop of vanilla, and a rather reserved smokiness. The flavors are very well balanaced with one another besides the smokey quality, which was very mild for a 'smoked' porter IMO. Very rich and creamy leading to a moderate bitterness. Finishes with a chocolate and coffee aftertaste.  A shade below full bodied. Creamy and smooth on the palate.  A very solid brew that begs to be drank again. Good balance among flavor components and quite drinkable. The only knock on this one, is that if you're expecting a very smokey porter you'll be a little let down. Once you get past this though, it's still a wonderfully flavorful porter.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Smoked Porter,89

147,90,Fish113d,3.98,"Served refrigerated from a 22 oz. bomber into a pint glass.  Mohogany in color with ruby highlights, the head sits 1 inches on top of the surface, a milky, tan head that dissipates very slowly, but lots of head clings to the glass. Brown roasted malts enter my sinuses, as well as a bit of smoke and caramel. Not overly complex in aroma, but nice. Taking the first sip, a sweet caramel flavor jumps out at me along with a bit of smoke flavor. By the swallow, the smoke takes over the body of the flavor, and leaves a huge smoke aftertaste in my mouth. Again, not overly complex, but comes through with what it promises in style. A little sweet up front, and smokey and a little bitter on the finish due to the smoke and the little bit of hops I taste. Carbonation is rather high and a little strong in my opinion, but the milky quality of the head seems to come through making this a much smoother swallow; nice and creamy! Overall, I enjoy everything Stone distributes that I can get my hands on, and this is just one more example in a style (smoke beer) that I am not as crazy about.

Creamy, 1/8-inch head of ultra-tight bubbles and one huge crater in the middle that eventually settles to a specter-like quality. Deep, dark black hue. Dark chocolate, light smoke, malt top on nose with a plum backing. Pretty smooth malt character on mouth with a black patent fining and a trailing, subtle smokiness that in no way overpowers the offering. Very drinkable for a smoked ale; could possibly have a couple of these and still not nuke the palate.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Smoked Porter,89
147,90,dgallina,3.71,"Pours black with garnet highlights and a chunky tan head that recedes into a thick blanket of foam and sticky lacing. Smells of sweet roasted coffee and chocolate malts on a vaguely spicy base. Flavor starts with evenly toasted sweet malts. Slowly develops more rounded roasted and slightly smoked qualities Finishes with a lasting and nicely drying burnt toast bitterness. Mouthfeel is slightly prickly from the carbonation; smooth and creamy, if perhaps a touch light.  A relatively light and refreshing, but not superlative porter. Aroma and flavor are restrained overall, but the finish is *very* well executed. Would make a nice session porter.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Smoked Porter,89
147,90,GClarkage,3.9,"02/06/05- Purchased at Beverages and More in Colma, CA  Presentation- 22oz bottle shared with BA mates at my Super Bowl party yesterday. Divided into Duvel glasses. No expiration date listed.  Appearance- Nice semi-black pour with a yellow-grayish head and good lacing.  Smell- Smells sweeter than I expected and the smoke is not noticable to me in the smell. Smells more like a imperial stout to me.  Taste- First off, I usually despise smoked beers. The only reason I got this is that I know Stone makes great beers and I know BA buddy Spinlock like smoked beers. So, I figured, what the hell. I only have to drink a portion of it. Much creamier than I expected for a less than 6% brew. Has a nice chocolate and roasted malt flavor. Then the smoke hits in the back of the mouth and aftertaste. Not too bad! I'll have to give it to Stone. I can actually tolerate this and even enjoy it a bit. I'm not going to buy another, but it was pretty good considering.  Mouthfeel- As I said before, very creamy and also low-medium carbonation level.  Drinkability- Yeah, not bad at all. I would definitely suggest this one to smoke lovers. It has enough taste going on with the smoke to make it feel like your not sucking down liquid charcoal or burnt bacon like other smoke beers I have had. About the same as AK Smoked Porter. I'll have to try that one again and rate it.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Smoked Porter,89
147,90,IceAce,4.03,"Deliberately poured with three fingers of desert sand colored foam, this baby looks beautiful residing in a footed Belgian tulip glass. When held to the brightest of light, the color is a resounding quality mahogany with perfect clarity. Lacing comes in over the 85th percentile...beautiful!  The nose needed a little coaxing...but it decanted at 43°, more than a tad low for both the style and pedigree. As a more appropriate temperature was achieved, what emerged was a chocolate profile with a roasted malty depth.  The initial taste reveals a most wonderful dryness which begins with a tongue-dance performed by the just-right level of carbonation. Deep roasted grains then take over providing a wonderful depth and creamy mouthfeel only to be outdone by the finish of light smoke, hop bite, and slow malty fade.  I'd love the opportunity to sample this complimented with salami or sausage incorporated into lasagna or pizza.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Smoked Porter,89
147,90,stirgy,4.5,"Poured a very dark brown, nearly black color. Looked like liquid molasses, topped by a layer of creamy tan foam. The aroma has soft dark toffee notes with some sweet brown sugar. The taste is bitter with touches of roasted smoke. The smoke in this beer is really subdued and pleasant unlike the morning after campfire I was expecting. Creamy and roasted body which is generally smooth and solid. An assertive porter with some nice subtle enhancements. Very enjoyable.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Smoked Porter,89
147,90,gbontrag,4.38,"57.5F. Dark, dark - pinot? It's got that beautiful odd, burnt sienna color from smokey malts as I pour. It cascades (!!!), a big bonus. Froth sits on top like a toasted marshmallow. It's resting in the mug dark with a pinot glow. Smells like a dark, sweet cigar. Ummm. Raspberries crushed with the burnt end of a fire poking stick made out of the tip of a Christmas tree. Chew on some pine sap, nibble on some rosemary, and nosh on some organic spinach. Finishes with herbal minerals, hence the spinach. It's got a silky mouthfeel to it, and - marshmallowy. Dang, that's good. It makes me want to grill an assinine-ly huge ribeye, and serve it with a side of pintos, and smokey New Mexican red chile.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Smoked Porter,89
147,90,JoeyHotrod,4.5,"My first Stone Ale and well worth the wait it's taken to try one.  Apperarance: Black with a very full and very lingering head. If looks could kill, this beer would be on death row right about now.  smell: Chocolate first and foremost. There is also just the slightest hint of smoke to be found.  taste: Again I'm getting chocolate above anything else, but the coffee undertones are still there in force and the smoky aspect.... not too strong not too faint, just about perfect.  Mouthfeel: Very creamy and the smoke seems to be more noticable than in the taste alone or the smell. Still not overpowering by any means, but more assertive and ready to scare off all those ""yellow fizzy"" beer drinkers.  drinkability: Could see myself very easily having a couple bombers back to back of this majestic brew. Can only speak for myself, but it lives up to any hype it's been given and then some.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Smoked Porter,89
147,90,Wolfsdenbrew,4.5,"Pours witha large tan head that dissipates slowly, leaving a ton of lacing. A beautiful dark brown with a ruby tint, slight bit of chill haze.  Nice hop bouquet, lots of roasted malts, coffee, chocolate and a bit of smoke.  Tastes of roasted and chocolate malts, lots of piney hops, big hop profile, smokey undertones, and finishes with a nice bitter hoppiness.  Good carbonation and medium to heavy body.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Smoked Porter,89
147,90,MuddyFeet,4.38,"Still working my way through my Christmas gifts. This beers is so dark, no light could penetrate it. I was bored so held a flashlight behind the pint glass and (mostly due to the glare around the edge's of the glass) swear no light made it through. A thinlayer of head eventually forms on the top of the beer and incredibly sticky lace clung to the edges of the glass. The aroma is of a fire that had you wake up to the next morning and all you smell is the wet charred wood. The flavor is of charred malts and charred wood. Almost as if I licked the inside of a wodd-burning kettle. So good. IT wafts uo the back of the nose. There are also very deep notes of dark chocolate wrapped into the beer. It would make a great tasting beer, but if you're working through a variety of beers, make sure it is toward the end because you will not be able to taste much afterwards.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Smoked Porter,89
147,90,kmpitz2,4.03,"The beer pours a deep brown, almost black with a ring of head over top of the beer. The nose is only slightly smokey, and mostly chocolate. The flavor has a bit more smokey flavor than the nose would tell, but still the chocolate and roasted tones dominate. The feel is moderate. I would like to have a little thicker or creamier bit to it. I like it, but this is no Alaskan Smoked Porter.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Smoked Porter,89
147,90,BeerFink,4.6,"Cracking open a deuce reveals a velvety smooth black brew with a frothy light khaki colored head. Hints of garnet when held to the light. Nice sticky lacing. Aroma is full roasted grain, with no shortage of coffee and chocolate. Hints of molasses and other dark things are also present. This wonderful flavor comes on smooth as silk, dripping with fat malts. Roasted grain presence steadily increases, till the flavor is chock full of it. Hints of bitter chocolate and truck stop coffee float around, seeking attention. The smoke I was looking for comes in towards the end and really stands out in the finish, leaving a semi-dry roasted flavor. Smoked malts really add a fine touch to this robust brew. Mouthfeel is pretty full for a porter, which is good - it helps to back up this bold flavor. Hella drinkable, not too heavy or alcoholic, but that smokiness is just so damn enticing. Thanks Stone for giving us one hell of a session porter.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Smoked Porter,89
147,90,beersarang,4.07,"Appearance: Upon pouring there is a generous and creamy head. This beer also leaves wonderful lace along the glass. Tone is extremely dark brown with a tan head. Shines wonderfully in the light.  Smell: The aroma has malty roasted notes, superb.  Taste: Strong upfront malty coffee and chocolate notes. Beautifully done. Alcohol character is present, but does not dominate. Final flavor is fruity.  Mouthfeel: Just right, not too light or heavy. Makes for a very smooth beer with carbonation that tingles just enough.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Smoked Porter,89
147,90,mhowell,3.71,"Poured a very dark, almost black, brown, with an hint of translucency ( I could see the shadow of my fingers on the other side of the glass). I picked up a slight smoky aroma from the bottle. The creamy tan head stayed a 1/4 inch thick till the bitter end. And that's my only negative. As smooth and creamy as this beer looks, and feels in the mouth, I was taken by surprise by the bitter bite. Not a complaint, just unexpected. Now that I am expecting it, I will enjoy this beer.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Smoked Porter,89
147,90,canucklehead,4.22,I expected more of a smoked flavour much like Alaskan but this really a big Porter with smoky undertones. The beer is black like a moonless night with a tan head. The nose is pure malt with a peaty tang. The first sip is smooth and chocolatey with lots of body. A huge beer considering the relatively low alcohol( by Stone's standards). I started to sip this beer to enjoy the nuances inherent in its finish.,Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Smoked Porter,89
147,90,MrNuggets,3.7,"This is one dark porter! A big tan creamy head tops my glass and holds strong. Coco on the nose. Hey what do you know, I smell some smoke as well. Taste is smooth with a slight coffee flavor along with that coco from the nose. Then it gets bitter, not hop bitterness but smoke bitterness which I like. This transition is kinda rough, taking away from mouthfeel and drinkability.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Smoked Porter,89
147,90,TheLiterati,4.03,"What a pleasant surprise! Stones Smoked Porter pours a dark, rich brown with a creamy caramel-tan head. The color is so deep that its nearly opaque.  The aroma is pleasing and downright comforting  a subtle smokiness hints at a cozy night in front of a roaring fire, which is exactly how I enjoyed mine.  The taste is complex without being fussy, and has a pleasing toasted malt flavor thats not too sweet, with a nicely hopped finish. Rather than assault the palate, the smoke flavor is subtle but present in every sip, just as the aroma wafts from the glass. Mouthfeel is creamy smooth, with just enough effervescence to keep it interesting as the brew warms.  Took the Bros. advice and chose this porter to go along with a real down-home meal. Not only did it stand up well to southern-styled favorite of fried chicken, greens and cornbread, but the smoky flavor made for a nice finish to a simple yet flavorful meal.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Smoked Porter,89
147,90,santoslhalper,4.5,"Comes in a 22 oz. bomber, with a nice little paragraph about the gargoyle. Pours a very deep brown with just the tiniest hints of red poking through. A nice chocolate head tops it off with some very pretty lacing. Smells incredibly chocolately, with just a little hint at espresso. Tastes almost like a stout, only more chocolate. Nice coffee bean notes. A fabulous tasting brew to say the least. Nice and chewy in the mouth, with a suprising amount of hops rounding it off. The aftertaste stays for hours. A very drinkable beer, especially since t's only 5.9% ABV. A great brew indeed. My first shot at a Stone offering. Now on to the Arrogant Bastard...",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Smoked Porter,89
147,90,mattcrill,4.03,"Appearance: Pours very ""imperial""-like. Black and with a nice pillowy tan head. Looks great in my brandy snifter.  Smell: Chocolate and espresso. But definitely more towards the chocolate end of things. Not hugely over powering but nice.  Taste: The taste reminds me of baker's chocolate. There is some bitterness up front (I'm assuming that's the ""smoke"" flavor they are going for...which I would agree is present), some chocolate throughout the middle, and just a touch of sweetness (more along the lines of a latte..so it's sweet but definitely not overdone) to finish. There is a definite ""smoke"" aftertaste that clings to my tongue. A pretty complex brew overall.  Mouthfeel: Medium-bodied and slick. I would expect a little more creaminess for a porter. But I liked it.  Drinkability and overall: A cool rendition of a porter. I really enjoy my porters and although I've had better, this is a good one to try.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Smoked Porter,89
147,90,GeoffFromSJ,4.45,"This was an exceptional smoked beer. Let me say that the smoke taste is more on the subtle side. It is the session smoked porter, so to speak. And it is exceptional.  It came with no head, but that could be due to how it was poured. You can pick up a little of the smoke in the smell, but not too much. The taste is wonderful. A great porter taste with a little bit of smoke underneath. I don't know whether it deserves a 5 or not, but it is borderline. Good carbonation. It has very good mouthfeel, and the carbonation slightly tickles the tongue without being too much.  So very drinkable. I'm very glad I could get a hold of it.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Smoked Porter,89
147,90,bigchris1313,4.12,"Appearance: Dark brown yet not quite black. Somewhere around Coca-Cola.  Smell: Plenty of coffee aromas and some chocolate.  Taste: Unlike the Imperial Russian Stout, this brew yells out ""Coffee!"" to me. I also sense some hoppy flavor and a good bit of chocolate, yet the main power of this brew is the coffee.  Mouthfeel: As a porter should feel: not as thick as a stout, but still plenty thick.  Drinkability: It's great for hopheads like me to find a brew like this to break up my hop-craving ways. In the middle of a night of drinking, or towards the end, I will break out a bomber of this to totally jarr my palate. It's always a delightful switch.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Smoked Porter,89
147,90,orbitalr0x,4.17,"Pours from the bomber a deep black with a small tan head forming. Hints of red try to peek out of the edges when help up to the light. The smell is roasty with chocolatey tones wafting in. Some hops and smoky notes are present as well. Quite unique.  The first sip hits upfront with a some nice roasted barley and chocolate tones. Creamy flavors are present along with quite a noticeable smoke flavor on the back of the palate. This is one of the most interesting porters I have yet to try. The smoky taste lingers in my mouth after each sip.  Mouthfeel is good and right on for the style. Medium bodied with good carbonation. Drinkability on this one is good, however I can't see myself having many. The smoky flavor doesn't really do it for me. However, it is easy to drink and is totally worth a try.

147,90,Hibernator,4.13,"I had this out of a 22 oz brown bottle and served in a pint glass. Typical sweet looking bottle with Stone logo on front.  Appearance is a dark black. No light is getting through this beer. Looks like a stout. Off brown head on top. Beautiful sticky lacings cling to the sides of the pint glass.  This porter smells creamy. Aroma smells like a dairy creamer.  This is a robust and tasty porter. Sweet and creamy with a rich, roasted malt flavor. This is certainly a smokey quality to each sip that works perfectly with the sweetness.  Another Stone classic. I have yet to be let down by this brewery. Very enjoyable and tasty.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Smoked Porter,89
147,90,steinlifter,4.4,"this beer poured a deep amber almost black, good head, and retention. smell was fruity and malty, taste was a pleasant mix of malt, fruity notes,a bit of chocolate, very smooth. subtle smokiness.

147,90,OhioBulldog,4.4,"Pours a very deep brown, almost opaque, with about an inch of tan head. Head receded to some nice lacing around my glass. Aroma is of roasted malts and sweeter notes of chocolate, caramel, and coffee. Also maybe some fruits. Wonderful bouquet, made me very anxious to take my first gulp. The taste is very big, and huge flavors of roasted malt, chocolate, coffee, and a well-balanced kick of hops and smoke in the end. Mouthfeel is very rich and smooth I enjoyed this bottle entirely to the end but the heaviness and being paired with my supper would make it hard to drink a whole lot more.  Stone did a great job here to create a big porter, Great, will buy again",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Smoked Porter,89
147,90,BrewMaster,4.33,"Pours with a rich and thick head about 2 inches on top. It cascades bubbles for a good minute then becomes nice and stiff. Color is an incredibly dark amber/brown.  The aroma is potent. I didn't even need to stick my nose in the glass to get the first wiff. Aroma is malty, chocolate and coffee in nature with alcohol and citrus blooms.  It tastes just like it smells. Burnt malty taste with hints of port wine flavor in a creamy base. Tails off at the end to a softer flavor. As it warms from fridge temp more complex flavors emerge but I just don't know the appropriate description for them.  Mouthfeel is very nice. Lots of bubbles cascading over the tongue but it does not have the sharp carbonation feel of a soda. Very gentle.  As far as drinkability goes, I can drink this beer all night. It's a great porter to use to introduce the style to someone who is unfamiliar with great brews and the porter style.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Smoked Porter,89
147,90,francisweizen,4.5,"From recently discovered notes: Dark chocolate brown, with scarlet edges when held up to the light. The head is thick and khaki coloured, it lasts for a while and leaves some decent lacing on my Arrogant Bastard pint glass. The aroma is of chocolate and caramel malts, roasted malts, starbucks coffee, and a bit of smoke. The taste is malty up front with some lovely chocolate and coffee notes in the middle. The smoke is subtle compared to other smoke beers, but it is very enjoyable as well. The mouthfeel is very creamy and s-m-o-o-t-h and the drinkability is good as well. Another awesome, but subdued, stone brew!",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Smoked Porter,89
147,90,granger10,3.76,"This beer poured a deep dark brownish black. I could see light through the glass but I had to hold it up to light. That's how a porter should be right? The head expanded to a large volume then declined after some time. Lots of lacing. The nose is mostly chocolate and some roasted malt flavor but not all that I was hoping it would be. The flavor on this beer was really thick and malty. Very roasted in the body with a mocha bitter combination on top. Never sweet but quite malty. Hops are more apparent in the finish and slightly bitter in the end. There is a smoky undertone to this beer but I wish it would have been stronger. Does age lessen the smokiness of a beer? This is probably the 2003 so maybe the smoke flavor diminished. All in all this is a really, really good porter but I just wanted a stronger element of smokiness in there.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Smoked Porter,89
147,90,BadBadger,4.05,"A very nice smoked porter. This beer pours a nice dark color. There was a rather small head. The smell was of nice roasted malts.

147,90,rugger,3.53,"For a Stone beer it was not what I was expecting, however for a porter it was very good, however it was really nothing special. It was overall to style, but the smoke flavor was lacking and I just expected more from a beer made by Stone. I would definately recommend this to a porter lover, however I would not suggest this to a person that just liked beer. I enjoy the flag porter, or Samuel Smith's porter more, even if they are different types of porters. Good job to Stone, but again not a big outlandish beer that I would expect from Stone.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Smoked Porter,89
147,90,wyllder,4.25,"Reviewed this off tap previously.  Pours a deep black/brown, letting very little light through.  First taste on the palate is a blend of coffee, chocolate and a subdued smokiness that leaves a thick lingering aftertaste.  Smoke flavor is less pronounced in the bottle than off-tap. Overall the bottled version seems a bit tamer than its tap brother.  Actually a bit easier to drink from the bottle, though. Ultimately, I'd rather have the tap version!  Still highly recommended.  Wyll-",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Smoked Porter,89
147,90,WetCoaster,3.93,"Appearance: Pours a deep, clear cola ruby brown. Finger thick rocky tan (almost brown) head with endless retention. Very thick lacing. Fairly active carbonation. About as pretty a porter as you're likely to run across.  Smell: Ka-boom! Immediate heavy malt scent of chocolate, coffee liquor, yeasty raisin bread, a bit of burnt sugar, with hints of dark fruit.  Taste/Mouthfeel: Smooth chocolaty malt, with hints of dark fruits. Smoke comes through in the finish, tight, dry but not overwhelming--there's a nice balance. Smoke lingers long into the aftertaste. The mouthfeel is a hefty light-to-medium, smooth and coating, with a refreshing zap of carbonation bringing up the rear.  Drinkability: Taste? Great. 5.9% ABV? Not too bad. Still, it's a bit too much to drink more than one or two--palette killer.  This is about a big, bad porter. It's not the most complex brew in the world, nor is it a ""smoke"" beer per se, but what's there works. There's a fine line between this and stout, but if like your porters burly, this will not disappoint. Good stuff.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Smoked Porter,89
147,90,WesWes,4.03,"The beer pours a deep dark black color with a thick frothy tan head that slowly fades. The aroma is good. It has a nice dark malt scent that boasts of chocolate, crystal, and black barley. It is a bit dry and devoid of hops. The taste is good. It has a fine malt palate and a dry smoked malt finish. It is rich, yet smooth. There are a lot of black malts in this one. The mouthfeel is fine. It is a full bodied beer with adequate carbonation. This is a good drinking porter.

147,90,meathookjones,4.15,22oz brown bomber. This poured a deep black that let a little bit of light through and a decent sized tan head that quickly faded down to a collar. Smokiness can defiantly be detected in the smell but it is not overpowering as coffee and roasted malts also come through quite well. The taste is a quite balanced with the smokiness being subtle and a sweet malt flavor coming to the front of this. It has a slight bittersweet finish that is quite pleasant. Mouthfeel is light medium with good carbonation. A good all around beer that is not your average porter. Another good brew by stone.,Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Smoked Porter,89
147,90,GCBrewingCo,3.71,"The beer arrived at the table a black amber with clear ruby highlights and an everlasting head that coated...no...painted the glass with Belgian Lace.  The aroma was only slightly smoky with more of a banana and fruity aroma. Mostly caramel in the background.  The flavor also was only slightly smoky with the same banana fruitiness and a caramel coffee and chocolate flavor. There was also present a slight malty sweetness that was well balanced by the darker malts.  The finish was dry with chocolate and then coffee well into the aftertaste. The body was medium.  I got much more coffee from this beer than smoke. Very nice beer, but if I had not known it was supposed to be a smoked beer I would have just thought it was a well crafted porter.  Pint at the Taproom at Ghent.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Smoked Porter,89
147,90,BuckeyeNation,4.38,"Mahogany brown with strong ruby highlights. Light is visible on the opposite side of the glass which is somewhat surprising. Given Stone's perchant for big beers I figured that this porter would be darker than it is. The head is chocolate nougat brown, looks pretty sturdy, is pitting like crazy on top and deposits copious amounts of lace as it slowly descends. As is usual for these guys, an excellent look.  The aroma is dark malty and is more chocolatey than anything else. Strangely enough, I don't appreciate any smoke in the nose. It's a little hoppy too, but very little. Excellent beer. The flavor is a wonderful amalgam of heavily roasted malt, chocolate, dark caramel, hops, coffee and smoke in roughly that order. The hops lend more bitterness than they do actual hop flavor, but this is not a bitter beer.  The smoke is more subdued than I'd like. If you're going to call this beer a smoked porter, then make it smoky. Interestingly enough, the body is much more substantial than the appearance would suggest. This baby is full and creamy; dextriny even. It's a very nice body that helps carry the flavor across the palate and keep it there.  Smoked Porter isn't the best porter that I've ever had, but it's damn close. I knew that Stone wouldn't let me down. If you have easy access to this fine beer, then consider yourself extremely fortunate.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Smoked Porter,89
147,90,lackenhauser,4.33,"Poured a deep deep ruby black color-theres just a trace of light peeking thru. Crammed the whole bomber bottle into one glass and it has a huge,white,creamy head atop it. Chocolate/roasty flavor dominates-a slight trace of smoke in the backround-builds as you get more into the beer. Mellow hop bitterness. Very full mouthfeel-the smokiness sneaks thru in the velvety finish of the beer.

147,90,beertaster13,3.38,"I love Stone offerings as much as the next guy but the smoked porter did not do my tastebuds justice. It is a good beer but from Stone you expect incredible with a capital I. Pours a ruby dark color with a creamy head that grows to an astonishing level. The smell is of roasted malts and mocha roast, smokiness. Taste is where it fell off the charts, hint of mocha and cream but not as full bodies as I would have liked, lighter than expected. Feels light in the mouth, un appealing. Drinkable for a nice meal but not that dessert beer I hoped for that is a meal of its own.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Smoked Porter,89

Only complaint is that the carbonation is off somehow.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Smoked Porter,89

The pour is very nice, with a nice creamy head ( I almost thought it was a bad bottle because the first pour had a huge head). The Smoke flavor is faint. Lingering in the background, covered up by the roasty burnt malt flavor. There isn't much to the aroma, but what is there, is smoky. I just don't pick it up in the flavor. It's a solid porter, but I just don't find it all that great as a smoked beer.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Smoked Porter,89
147,90,shapudding,4.47,"Pours a beautifully dark chocolate brown, almost blackish. The head was gone almost instantly and left only a slight beige ring. Just enough carbination. Great aroma, nice and smokey. The flavor is a great blending of the wonderful smokiness, roasted malts, chocolate, coffee, a nice toastiness. You are left with alot of flavor in your mouth after each sip... yummmy. Such a nice and smooth mouthfeel, but not at all heavy, nicely drinkable. I have always liked the smoked and am a big fan of Stone, and have been looking forward to trying this one. Once again they haven't let me down.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Smoked Porter,89

I can't really call this a porter, it isn't sweet enough. It IS however a good Stout.  Mouthfeel is good.  Smoky and chard it is, but this is a good stout. NOT A PORTER!",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Smoked Porter,89
147,90,rajendra82,3.9,"When poured from the 22 oz. bomber, with the signature Stone Gargoyle, into a Pilsner glass, the beer displays an inch tall off-white rocky head that diminishes to a small line of bubbles, leaving a fair bit of lacing. The body is ruby brown in color, and is much clearer than almost any other porter that I have come across. The smoked malt clearly imparts a burnt roasty aroma to the beer. The hop aroma is light and faintly grassy. The taste is refreshingly acidic (lemons mostly), and bitter-sweet chocolate with almonds, with a smoky grain flavor constantly lingering in the background. There is also a hint of cracked peppercorn in the aftertaste. The body is light on the palette, with a creamy smooth texture enhanced by the soft carbonation. The finish is chalky and bone dry, leaving you craving the next sip. The beer is amazingly drinkable, and would make a good companion on a hot summer day. Stylistically, this is not quite a classic porter, but Stone is not known for their strict adherence to such things. I say more power to them.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Smoked Porter,89
147,90,proc,4.3,"Yet, another excellent offering from the fine folks at Stone. I picked this bottle up during the ""Michigan BA's Invade Toledo"" gig. Pours out to a jet black in the glass with a decent-sized head. Aroma is that of dark chocolate and coffee. The taste is excellent, with a wonderfully smooth roasted malt taste that finishes with a swallow that beckons you to sip again. Drinkable and easily a session porter.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Smoked Porter,89
147,90,andyo,4.03,"Nice 22oz. bottle. i am always intrigued by the Stone Brewing Company bottles. I've had this beer on a few previous occasions, most recently on a visit to my dear friend Shane, as he had a bomber of this and a bomber of Rogue Shakesphere Stout awaiting my arrival after 10 long hours of driving from Virginia Beach to Columbus Ohio. To say this beer holds fond memories for me is quite the understatement.  Purchased this from my local Farm Fresh store for $3.89. This beer poured a beautiful black/ruby color, and created a stunning 2 finger grey/tan head that pillowed above my glass. This head slowly settled as I drank, yet continued to leave a sticky lace along the sides of my glass all the way down. Beautiful.  This beer had a nice skokey smell (duh!) with hints of caramel, and a faint whiff of alcohol.  This beer had a mighty nice taste to it. Everytime I taste this beer, it has something slightly different to offer from past tasting experiences. On this occasion, the taste really hit me in the back of my mouth. Very bitter, tastes of roasted malts, very round upon my tongue, full flavors of coffee, slightly nutty, and some tastes of alcohol. This beer left a HUGE aftertaste in my mouth. I found this porter to be very smooth, somewhat complex, and very nice to drink. Count me in for at least one of these, but certainly not a beer I could drink all night long (well...maybe. This is subject to change!)",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Smoked Porter,89
147,90,Southernbrew,4.2,"Pours dark brown with a very small, tan head.  Very light smokiness in the nose along with a roasted chocolatiness present.  Medium body with a nice carbonation feel to it. Moderate roasted flavors come through with an ever present if not overpowering smokiness. Flavors stay very even the whole way through and leave a pleasant roasted aftertaste with the slightest smokiness remaining.  Very interesting beer. One of the ""biggest"" porters to cross my palate and my first smoked beer. I'm inspired to try more, very nice.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Smoked Porter,89
147,90,Afterburner,4.45,"Appearance: Thick, dark, opaque, with foamy beige head that leaves some nice lacing.  Smell: Faint smoky character that I probably wouldn't have been able to identify if I weren't familiar with the aroma. Also some coffee-ish, caramel-ish notes.  Taste: Initial burst of malt sweetness, followed by a smoky toffee flavor. The smoke is mild, but definitely present. It's a sweetish smoke flavor, provided by peat-smoked barley according to their website. The finish is mildly bitter with some chocolate notes and a bread-like character.  Mouthfeel: Silky, but not viscous. Moderate levels of small-bead carbonation give it texture and keep things interesting.  Drinkability: This is a wonderfully balanced beer of exceptional flavor. I don't remember the smoke character being this noticable the last time I had one, but that was in a smoky bar (The Brickskeller) after I'd had a few other beers. It's verra nice.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Smoked Porter,89
147,90,FormatKid,4.05,"I picked up a 22oz bomber of this from Riverside Beverage in Chattanooga. Stone is one of my favorite breweries so Im pretty confident I will enjoy this one. Its been sitting in the fridge for a couple weeks and I finally have the opportunity to sit down and enjoy it.  Pours out a deep, dark garnet color. A BIG rugged, lumpy head rolls up in an off-white shade. The head is oatmeal like in its consistency. The beer appears opaque but you can see light through it rather well. Lacing sticks in chunky, lumpy web like patterns down the entire length of the glass.  The smell is a little more subtle than I was expecting from a brewery that usually goes so big. Smooth sweet malts are dominant and remind me of bitter chocolate and possibly a creamed coffee. Thin strands of bitterness are apparent on the nose as well.  Oh yeah, taste is spot on. Mouthfeel is creamy and wonderful, yet goes down refreshingly. Smoky roastiness is present, but again..not quite as prevelant as Id expected. Tones of semi-sweet cocoa are richly present in the middle. Finish is sweet, with a teasing hop zing around the back and edges of my tongue. Not what I would characterize as dry, Id consider it quenching in fact.  Another super-solid offering from Stone. This is definitely one of my favorite porters Ive tried.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Smoked Porter,89
147,90,Stimack,3.93,"Had this brew on tap at Mahars the other night. Brew poured to almost black color with a nice head that stuck around for about half of the brew and then broke down to pretty good lacing. The aromas of this brew where of caramel, chocolate, charcoal and of course a sweet smokiness. Excellent aroma coming from this brew. The taste was very much in line with the aroma, but the roasted malt flavor was prevalent. Also could notice a bit if a hop hit but is was difficult to track that one down. Nice think brew that I think would be incredible during the colder months but was happy to give it a try with it being close to 80 out! Over all a great brew and would track this one down again!",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Smoked Porter,89
147,90,Lupe,4.43,"Very dark, almost black in color with some deep red highlights. Creamy tan head that stays and leaves nice lacing. Sweet aroma with chocolate, caramel, and a hint of roasted malt. Rich flavor, once again with chocolate, coffee, caramel, and roasted malt. Some toasted grain also peeks through along with a hint of smokiness. Hop flavor is light, herbal when noticed. Lingering roasted flavor. Medium-full in body, creamy, and smooth. After having this beer, I know what they mean by saying chewy. Highly drinkable. Not as smokey as I imagined, but excellent regardless. A terrific porter.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Smoked Porter,89
147,90,david23,4.55,"Once again Stone has the head that won't quit. Beautiful lacing all the way to the end.Has a smokey charcoal aroma with a hint of peat. Carbonation is just perfect and such a smooth feel on the tongue. Here's where it gets interesting. Shared this with two friends and they just kept going back and forth on the flavors that kept coming through. Roasted, toasted barley, hops comes to the palate for a brief visit only to be replaced with perhaps a caramel but I think chocolate. Stone just keeps our minds working with the combinations of flavors in all of their brews. Definely one of the best Porters I've ever had. If you missed this one, you're missing the boat!!!",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Smoked Porter,89
147,90,Rastacouere,3.65,"Dark brown hue with a thin, quickly absent tan head. The smoke isn't so subtle to me, it's actually pretty well developped. Very sweet though with lots of crystal? malt making up honey and maple flavors. Subdued hops profile that gain Stone a bit of respect from me. Chocolatey sweet, just very malty altogether and finely balanced once the grassy green hops finally kick in, but it's no standout in my books and is actually a bit watery in the finish. I can definitely see where the brewers are from when they claim this to be their less understood beer though.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Smoked Porter,89
147,90,Morris729,4.38,"Pours black ruby in color with a thick and creamy tan head that billows out of the top of the glass with no spillage. Nose is roasted coffee beans and dark caramel along with some fainter aromas of smoked grains. Fairly full in body with a somewhat heavy and chewy texture and a very smooth level of carbonation. Taste begins with some sweet malts and milk chocolate followed by flavors of fresh brewed coffee and some earthy notes with touches of smoky charcoal and peat with only a mild trace of bitter hops towards the finish. The smoky and peaty notes remain in the aftertaste, becoming more pronounced as the beer warms. Another winner from Stone. Purchased from Liquid Solutions.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Smoked Porter,89
147,90,oggg,4,"The beer was presented to me in a tall pilsener glass at Fleming's Steak House in San Diego. It was a solid black with brown tints at the edges. The head was poured small, but it was light and creamy and left a strong lace. The aroma was of chocolate and roasted goodies. Tiny bit of hop aroma. Not a whole lot of smoke. The taste was full of chocolate and sweet roasted grains. Astringency was low. Mild hop flavor barely balanced the chocolate sweetness. Smokiness was restrained. Not dry. I ordered a filet mignon and I don't think they went too well together, go figure. Anyways, this porter is medium bodied and very smooth. I had this a few months ago in the bottle and it was terribly astringent. This tap version was very nice.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Smoked Porter,89
147,90,coasterfreak75,4.16,"The beer poured dark chocolate brown, bordering on black. It poured a good foamy one and one half inch head that slowly dissapated and left a slight creamy lace on top that stuck to the glass throughout the entire drink. The smell was semi-sweet with a fair amount of spicy undertones. Just a slight hint of coffee. It started out with a sweet cream taste with just the right mix of a coffee taste. The middle was laced with a spice that I just can't put my finger on. The finish was just slightly bitter with a slight kick of smoke. All and all a great beer that would be great to share with friends over a heated conversation about nothing, or with a fine dinner, or just sitting back and relaxing after a long day at work.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Smoked Porter,89
147,90,CRJMellor,4,"Pours a deep dark maroon, almost black. Small thin head forms and disappears, no real lace. Aroma of cocoa, coffee bean, chocolate, pine, minor citrus notes and an earthy mineral note. Flavors of chocolate, coffee, butterscotch, moderate liquid smoke and some pine sap and citurs bitterness were noted. Mouthfeel jumps to an espresso bitterness right away . Midway thorugh a scotch malt hit is detected that then switches to a heavily roasted, smoked finish. Drinkability is relatively high, love to try this one with some spicy BBQ'ed ribs",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Smoked Porter,89
147,90,taez555,4.03,"This beer poured a dark black body with a creamy dark tan head.  The nose was a dark lush chocolate. Touches of caramel, malt and a soft, very faint, meat/smoke smell.  The taste was light to medium bodied. Dark mild but bitter roasted barley. Soft chocolate. A nice firm bitterness from start to finish. A touch of hops A slight woody/bark flavor. A very very mild smoke flavor. The smoke is present but simple and perfectly complimenting the dark malt.  Overall a really nice porter. Tasty, smooth and creamy but not as thick as a stout.

147,90,bditty187,4.13,"Largely black in hue with shinny ruby highlight around the edge of the glass once held to the light. The brunette head reached two fingers in height and the retention was nearly flawless. It took a long while before it faded noticeably. The subsequent lacing was massive. It was a beautiful sight. The nose was quite unexpected. Where was the smoke? I mean I could detect the American hops the second I started pouring it and once I took a sniff a good amount of roast chocolate malts and coffee hints were detectable. But where is the smoke? Frankly it just smells like a big Porter. Thats not really a bad thing but the label is misleading thus far. The palate is tasty; I think I found what is meant by smoke, I detected a burnt flavor. Unexpected. Disappointing. Still, tasty. I guess this is the difference between a Smoked Beer and a Rauchbier. Back to the palate, the big roasted flavors dominate but allow room for a reserved bite of hops. This is a well-rounded Porter that is very easy to drink. I am digging the fact that the alcohol content so modest. This is the first Stone beer that does not reign down pure anger in the form of hops! Still, Im digging it. I mean the drinkability is sensational. I want more! The mouthfeel is pleasant, the carbonation seems a bit small and the body is medium-full, still I found it a touch slick but this is hardly a big negative. All I can say is this is a delicious Porter with a straight-ahead tastiness that is hard to rebuff. I bet this could be paired with an array of BBQ and grilled food. I bought my 22-ounce bottle in Loveland. My advice to you, buy some but dont expect a Rachbier like I did!",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Smoked Porter,89
147,90,Gavage,4.58,"Pours a black color with a tan head that's about 1/2"" thick. The head receded to the surface rather quickly, but that stuck around a while. Some lacing developed too. The aroma is of coffee and burnt wood. The flavor has coffee, molasses, licorice, pepper, and a hint of burnt chocolate. The smokiness is just right, not overpowering and it adds to the flavor.  The mouthfeel is smooth with a slight dry aftertaste. The smokiness and coffee tones last long on the tongue after swallowing. This is one of the better smoked brews I have ever sampled.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Smoked Porter,89
147,90,ViveLaChouffe,4.45,"Pours pitch black with a thick tan head. I love a really dark porter! Smell is dominated by the smoke. Chocolate and bitter burnt malt. Nice!  Taste does not live up to the smell. Lots of chocolate flavor and lots of dark malt. Lightly nutty and bitter coffee flavors. Strong licorice flavors as well. There is some light smoke throughout but nothing like the smell or like other smoked beers I have had. however, it is still a really complex and tasty beer. Smoky aftertaste and full-bodied. Damn drinkable. I can't think of another time that a beer has disappointed me so much but still delivered things I wasn't even looking for. Excellent!",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Smoked Porter,89
147,90,watermelonman,3.87,"This is one dark porter. It smells a little plain, but the taste is full-bodied and definitely smokey. The head and lace were somewhat subdued, as expected. It's got a bit of a black licorice taste, too.  It was more bitter and less smooth than what I typically look for in a porter, but it's definitely good.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Smoked Porter,89
147,90,Foxman,4,"it pours a deep, almost totally opaque brown, flashing ruby at the edges where light stands a better chance of passion through. A finger full of light brown head pillows like mousse and retains nicely. Clingy whirls of lacing meander on the glass.  A rather mild smokey peat aroma is most notable at first, but almost as apparent is a chocolate character and coffee notes. Hops begin by acting shyly, but come out of their shell as the glass warms, allowing them to flower more noticeably. The earthy sweetness of dark roasted malt provides the end game, along with a mild coffee bitterness.  Upon tasting, the dusky malt takes the lead, imparting a roasted grain backbone to the mix, but the genuine smokey character duels capably. An edgy dark coffee bitterness cruises in, then steps aside to allow a pairing of an oily hops resonance and an earthy, almost leathery richness to work toward the end. The finish gives up the return of the gentle bitterness. The smoke component is a mellow partner rather than an assertive stage-hog, and that works well here.  Medium bodied, the flavor elements are strident enough to cling tightly, which is good because this beer flows ably, rather than coat the palate. A dry hops tingle glows at the finish.  This is my first Stone offering (I'm saving my DB,) and I wasn't sure what to expect, but it's all good. The eponymous smoke never overwhelms, but rather adds a fun aspect to a good porter. It's never over the top and delivers good flavor along with something a bit different. Goes to show you, add a flavor to what starts as a good beer, and it has a chance to be a winner. It drinks easily and freely, which is obviously a good quality. No, I'm not wowed, but I'm pleased, and if Stone gets nothing but better from here on for me, then life is surely fine.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Smoked Porter,89
147,90,ngandhi,4.19,"When cold, this is one of the most delicious porters I've ever had. Once it rises to room temperature, the unctuous, nutty hop resins come together brillantly with the fruity malt and yeast and this is one of the most delicious porters I've ever had. But I'm missing the smoke here.  This isn't rauchbier style smoke; the focus is definetly on crafting an overall remarkable porter that happens to have smoked malt. However, I found there to be more noticeable smokiness in the 6th Anniversary (listed on BA as a Baltic porter). Stone Smoked Porter is not so much smoked as it is Islay malt peaty. But I guess Peaty Porter sounds kinda wussy on a bottle  The malt profile is coffee and unsweetened, raw, pure cocoa. The hop oils lend a walnut/hazelnut profile to this brew that I've found to run common in the Stone beers -- most noticeable in Arrogant Bastard. The finish is packed with a powerful black patent-like bitterness that must come from the smoke (I assume there's no patent in here because it's called a porter). Again the coffee, the hazelnut, and fruity, Bell's-like yeast. This is a full breakfast.  I was running the review through my head as I drank it fresh out of the fridge and I debated giving this a perfect score because it was so well-balanced, especially for a smoked beer. By bottle's end, I think this balance hurts the beer. The smoke profile is indistinguishable and the hop volatility begins to clash with what is, at first, a pleasant medium-bodied beer. It grows thin.  But this beer's got balls. It takes a chance. And this level of criticism is only due to something that has tried for perfection and achieved only greatness instead.  Relax, relax. ng",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Smoked Porter,89

Head was just slightly off-white and fell down to a thick webbing of foam along the top of the beer. Smell is dark chocolate, thick gooey dark chocolate, roasted malt, and just a hint of subdued smokiness. Taste leads off with a smooth hop bitterness that has a citrus/earthy tone, then takes you into roasted malt land. The dark chocolate tones reign supreme, and the finish adds just a touch of smoke. Mouthfeel is very nice, but perhaps a bit too much in the astringent drying feeling left at the very end. Not bad, though.

Topped by a huge beige head that eventually recedes to a smallish layer of foam. Faint wisps of lacing are left on the glass.  Smell: Hearty aroma of chocolate malts. The smoke is not very apparent on the nose, but it's slightly detectable. The smoke smell is vaguely reminiscent of what your clothes smell like a few days after sitting around a campfire.  Taste: Sweet taste of chocolate malt with some velvety ash- and smoke-esque flavors casting their umbras on the aftertaste. Quite bittersweet and dark.  Mouthfeel: Smooth and medium in body. Thick and hearty.  Drinkability: The smoke is only hinted at in this beer. It certainly doesn't whack you in the face with it like Rogue's Smoke Ale or an authentic rauchbier (both of which I lerved). This would better be described as a porter with some smoky overtones.

Inital dry cocoa powder and coffee taste. The brew then finishes with a sharp hop/smoke bite. The mouth is thick initally with a dry back of the tongue finish.

It is a rich dark brown and with a vigorous pour, the head looks like a malted milk shake.  Smell is milk chocolate, malt, coffee. Nothing over powering and nicely integrated. Smooth.  It tasted like an alcoholic version of a chocolate milk shake. Not some frou-frou ""chocolate liquer,"" and downright good.  Mouthfeel was medium thick. I knew I was drinking a substantial beer!

This pours a deep dark brown liquid with ruby tones. The head is a nice tan color, and it stayed for a little while. It left some nice lace on the sides of the glass. Smells of roasted grain, with a slight smoky, oak aroma. Tastes kind of a slight chocolatey thing. The smoke hits at the end, but it doesn't really hit, it just kind of taps you on the shoulder. Hello my friend. Felt a little thin, but definitely not the end of the world. Even though this is a smoke beer, it is very drinkable. Not an overpowering smoke effect, just a pleasant, subtle flavor.

Aroma is typical porter, plus a nice, roasty, smoky element--a pattern that also holds true in the flavor. I'm really a fan of the thick, smoky taste that comes to kick your taste buds and then leaves to let them recover. I'm thoroughly impressed by how potent yet unoppressive this beer is.

Enormous roasted flavors in the nose: dark chocolate, roasted coffee, and some campfire aromas are dominate. Some westcoast hops seem to be wafting in the background. Mouthfeel is full bodied, rich and creamy, yet has a mild spicy hop twang. Nicely carbonated. Taste is dark chocolate and roasted coffee, as might be expected, but you can easily sense some hop character. Campfire smokiness is present throughout, but is understated. Some dark fruits try to emerge as it nears room temperature, but get knocked back by the bittering hops. This is a very well crafted brew, but is a bit too heavy in character for my preference in a Porter. This one seems a lot closer to a Stout than a Porter.

Smell is slightly mild for such a strong beer; but its predominantly smoked peat.  That thought is continued through the taste. Initially I sensed some greeness, but the longer I take, the better tastes. There are some sweet flavors that mingle with the otherwise dry and peaty dominance, and they do help. For a Stone brew, I'm somewhat startled by the lack of bitterness, but the hop selection seems to compliment the beer very well. It helps dry the palate with the smoke, and whispers in your ear ""take another sip.""",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Smoked Porter,89

It quickly dissapted leaving a small lace and a very thin layer of bubbles in the pattern of leapord spots. That was cool.  The smell was of roasted malts, very stout like.  The taste was very good. Not what I am used to in a porter. It was sweet but had a smoked taste, hence the style. A little bit of hops were present in the taste but they were in the background.  The mouthfeel left something to be desired. It was a little thin, the carbonation help make the mouthfeel more complex.  The drinkability in this beer is low.

A dark chocolate color with a beautiful head that leaft an unbelievable lacing started the experience. The aroma was what it said...smoky...coffee-bean like with a hint of tartness to come. Taste was extremely well-rounded with a creamy mouthfeel that was medium bodied. The smoky coffee flavors were there, but so was an excellent slightly bitter aftertaste.

Very slight smoke character in the rear of the aroma. In fact, the smokiness of the beer takes a backseat throughout the experience....it's almost an afterthought. And, in one sense, that's a refreshing change from smoked beers that are plainly overdone. The beer has a rich, thick mouthfeel...mouth-coating with a somewhat astringent and dry finish.

If there is a better way to spend my winters, I havn't had it yet. This beer was as smooth as it gets.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Smoked Porter,89
147,90,Beaver13,3.17,"The Smoked Porter poured a dark black with a semi-creamy tan head that dissipated rather quickly. Suprisingly, there was not much of an aroma to this beer just a slight malt smell. I wasn't very impressed with the taste either. It had a very bitter, hoppy finish for a porter. As it warmed a roasted malty start became more pronounced. I was expecting a lot from this beer and was pretty disappointed. It wasn't bad, but it was nowhere near what I though it would be. I didn't notice any smokiness in the nose or taste either.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Smoked Porter,89
147,90,rkhaze,3.7,"Poured black with chestnut edges. Nice creamy tan head. Good lace. Aromas of roasted malt, chocolate and a subtle sweet smokiness. Taste of charred malt, chocolate and a tangy hard wood smokiness. The smoke comes through a lot more in the flavor than the smell. The smoke and a hop bitterness lingered on the palate a little longer than I liked. Almost seemed to need a slightly sweet element to balance it out. Good mouthfeel if not a little thin. The sharp aftertaste hurt the drinkability for me.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Smoked Porter,89
147,90,mschofield,4.2,"Deep dark red-brown, with a tan head that laces well. Smoky and roasted aroma hits your nose as soon as you pour. Hits all the dark tastes coffee, chocolate, raisin, and roasted malt, but lying under them all is a smokyness. These are balanced by a good amount of hops. A lighter feel than I expected, on the light side of medium. I bet it would go great with smoked meats (such as pulled pork). Very drinkable, more subdued that I'd expect when the words Stone and Smoked are involved.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Smoked Porter,89
147,90,tfinn,4.07,"this beer simply smells wonderful. I had to smell it even before I poured my first glass from the bottle. light head dissapeared after the first few sips. it's a suitably dark dark red / brown porter color.  did I mention it smells really good? there's a subtle almost carmelized undertone that hearkens to roasted food which strikes me as very tasty.  initial flavor is somewhat tangy ""hoppy wood"" which fades quickly after swallowing to yield hints of malt. the hops return and the tail continues a low light hoppy ride off to a dry finish on the sides of my tongue.  mouthfeel improves as it warms up, but is still a tad on the light side for me. (I &lt;3 malt.)  overall a very good beer, worth seeking out for the smell alone.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Smoked Porter,89
147,90,JMH_,4.28,"my second stone brew. they're easily 2 for 2 thusfar. pours a dark dark brown to near black with a nice creamy tan head that leaves a nice stickiness on the glass. the smell and taste are of smoke, coffee, chocolate and malt. the smell has some other sweet qualities to it and the taste falls in the order listed above, with a finish that goes back to the coffee flavour for a nice dry finish. this is an easy drinking brew that is most complex than most, if not all, of the porters that i have sampled. the relatively low alcohol content makes this a nice choice for a different type of session brew if you are looking for one.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Smoked Porter,89
147,90,oberon,4.12,"Pours a deep brown with some ruby tint to it with a light but creamy looking almond colored head,the aroma is very nice I think the light smoky hints along with the chocolate almost makes a fudge brownie aroma is it just me?Taste is very earthy with a raw peanut flavor with the smokiness coming in late that lingers definant resiny hop flavor intermingaled in there as well.A pretty complex beer very worthy of its high marks in my humble opinion.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Smoked Porter,89
147,90,crookedhalo,3.97,"Rich dark brown color almost opaque; nice tan to light brown head. Faint smokiness amidst all the qualities of a quality porter; roastiness, maltiness and all the stereotypical dark ale qualitites (coffee, chocolate, dark fruit, etc...) Personally, I've tasted better porters, but the subtle smoke presence in this beer rounds it out and makes it quite enjoyable. I feel Stone has done a remarkable job with this beer. Of course, it's no Schlenkerla as far as smoked beers go, but you know it's not trying to be that kind of a smoked beer. Sometimes less is better, and if this beer was more aggressively smoked, I'm not so sure I'd like it as much. It's found a certain kind of chi. Right up there with Anchor Porter as a quality west coast porter.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Smoked Porter,89
147,90,nomad,3.62,"Poured a deep brown color, with a head that was quick to pile up and quick to bubble down, and showing better lacing than I expected. Smell was roasty, with scents of nuts and mild coffee, dark chocolate, and some smoke. Taste was at first roasty, chocolatey, with a great porter body of flavor. It seemed have just enough lick of hops, but it came through with a sizable salty and, what comes close to, green and oily hops in the long finish. This is what soured my opinion of the beer.  A little too much hop bitterness for me, this beer was surprisingly flavorful for a thin body - in fact, a thin session mouthfeel but covered in some carbonation. Well done just not my taste for a porter.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Smoked Porter,89
147,90,Gueuzedude,4.18,"Pours black with a persistant light brown head. Aroma is first of roast malt, followed by smoke which comes to dominate the aroma, though it is not overwhelming. The taste is malty, with roasted notes, and then the smoke injects itself. The smoke is the dominant flavor, though it is not as strong as some other examples. Very well balanced for a Stone beer :-)",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Smoked Porter,89
147,90,winomark,3.5,"Appearance: Nice dark brown hue with a small, frosty white head.  Aroma: Smoky malt and hops. Coffee and mocha also present.  Taste: Smoke and coffee throughout, with a hoppy dryness in the finish.  Mouthfeel: Coating, but dry. Coffee and chocolate give it good body.  Drinkability: Stronger than most porters I have had, but still a great interpretation. Will try again when I can.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Smoked Porter,89
147,90,gueuzeonhigh,4.33,"At first, I thought this porter was created with one of the specialty techniques involving smoke as in the style of the German smoke beers like Rauchenfels Steinbrau . Thus upon first tasting this beer I was in a quandary over it having anything to do with smoke at all. After some research I found the smoke came from the peat smoke roasted malt.  The beer poured with a dark brown color- not quite black like a stout might be, but a deep rich substantial ""brown"". The pour formed a nice foamy tan head.  As for flavor-- its a tasty porter-- a little light in the malt flavor signature department especially given the peat smoked malt and overall lighter flavor profile compared to other fave porters such as Ipswich . Stone Smoke Porter has a much heartier start to finish than Anchor Brewings porter. Generally it has all the profile and character of an excellent heavier bodied beer. In my opinion, it has the proper color, hearty balance of hops and malt, nice mouthfeel and a lingering finish. Although I cant detect anything special about the malt notes. Maybe Im expecting something out of the ordinary because of the so-called peat smoked malt. Nevertheless-- I like! I like!",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Smoked Porter,89
147,90,Mark,4.1,"Black as night, tannish head lasted and left nice rings of lace. Slightly smoky smell wafted up from the glass. Nice subtle roastiness and smoked character I found was just right. Good solid mouthfeel, highly drinkable. A very nice porter and one I would seek out again. Go Stone!",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Smoked Porter,89
147,90,beerinator,4.22,"Appearance: Dark brown beer, with splotches of red where the light hits it. Dark tan head with great retention.  Aroma: Deeply stonish aroma. Smells like an arrogant bastard roasted in a fire. The malt presence is bursting forth with wild abandon.  Taste: Smokyness hits the middle of the tongue. Bitterness lingers through the flavor. Tingly smokyness accentuated by the hop presence. Malt is not too overpowering, and the smoke level seems right. Mouthfeel is nice, like most of the Stone beers I've had.  Notes: Good beer in small doses. Smokyness mostly balanced by the malt sweetness. If you like smoky beers, don't pass this one by.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Smoked Porter,89
147,90,TinusTime,4,"pours a fairly opaque black with a nice khaki head that dissapears quickly. smell is of burnt coffe, toffee, woodsmoke and chocolate. Flavour was more subtle than i thought it would be. Starts of with a sweetness and finishes with a bit of a hop bite. Not alot of smoke on the palate however. I dont think i would have pegged this a smoke beer if i had not have known. the mouthfeel is silky smooth and the beer is nice and light on the carbonation. Drinkablity- this would go great with any grilled meats. I could definately see it with nice rich stew esp if the stew had a bit of bacon in it. Not a session beer but definately one you could savour during a meal",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Smoked Porter,89
147,90,Stopper,3.7,"Pours a hefty, creamy light brown head atop a very dark body with burnt orange highlights. The aroma is of a sweet base malt, with touches of a blend of smoke and bitter chocolate malts. The body is smooth and a bit lighter than I expected, and the hops bitterness is apparent almost immediately, as the balance is definitely toward the bitter side. The finish is so dominated by a gigantic citrusy hop bite that the smoke and dark roasted malt are difficult to pick out, though they do come through a bit as the hop fades a touch after a long and heavy presence.  This is my first taste of a Stone beer, and after built up expectations from all the hype I've heard, I am sorry to say I'm a bit disappointed. They managed to take a beer that should have multiple levels of interest and effectively squelch most of it with an oppressive hoppiness. That said, perhaps my expectations were just too high -- it's a good beer, and if I'm really looking for a load of hops, I'll look here again. But, in my opinion, for a smoked porter, this is far from well-balanced. The other bottle I bought will live in the cellar for a while, and perhaps the flavors will be perfectly balanced and blended after the hops have some time to fade.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Smoked Porter,89
147,90,AaronRed,4.58,"What an ubelievable beer. Poured into clear pint glass, the richness of this brew is aparent immediately. Nice tan lace cascades down the glass until the end. You can smell the dark malt and smokiness, but it is not overwhelming nor distracting. I could not get over the taste. Rich and deep, all I can say it is the essence of what a porter should taste like. Chewy and fulfilling, it is certianly one of my favorite porters.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Smoked Porter,89
147,90,woemad,4.77,"Having tried Alaskan Smoked Porter a little while back, I wanted to try another smoked porter and compare the two. This is possibly the most subtle beer I have ever had. It pours a dark black, with a moderate tan head and average lacing. The smell is that of most good porters - roasted malt, notes of black coffee - but with a beguiling smokiness hovering in the background. This smokiness sets the mood without dominating it. The taste is again a study in smoky restraint. The coffeeish, roasted malt taste is filled out and accentuated by the smoke flavor, which adds a rich, silkiness to the proceedings. The mouthfeel is rich and creamy, like any good porter. This is a wonderful beer, and I deeply regret having purchased only one. Whereas Alaskan Smoked Porter bursts forth when you drink it, like a big alderwood swat team busting down your door, this smoked porter shakes your hand and puts its arm over your shoulder",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Smoked Porter,89
147,90,beerguy101,4.26,"Deep Black Color, medium head. Aroma is smoky and malty. Roasted malt flavor, slightly sweet, chocolate and coffee, slightly smoky. Hops balance the roasted malts well. This is a nice porter, yet the slight touch of smoky adds an extra touch of flavor. Taste is very smooth. The smokiness is subdued and may not please a lot of drinkers. All in all a very nicely done beer. Subtly sometimes works better than a sledgehammer. Stone beers are usually over the top, this one is subtle. Mouthfeel is full and round. Finish is clean and smooth. Aftertaste is slightly sweet. Etched/painted beer bottle.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Smoked Porter,89
147,90,rabidawg,4.72,"Appearance: Pure opaque black with a grayish-tan head. Light carbonation and sticky, irregular lacing.  Smell: Reminds me of a canvas tent that carries aroma of last year's campfire with it, a nice, earthy mustiness accompanied by the smell of a bed of coals wet by fresh rain. There's nothing falsified about this smokiness, no liquid smoke notes to be found. Breathing deeply a crisp hoppiness is found. But overall this brew smells old . . . old and wise.  Taste: Smooth as can be. The slightly oily liquid glides into my mouth, filling every corner possible. There's no assault and no shock, just a perfectly balanced gem. Very round. I swear I've never had a beer make my mouth water like this one. Slightly sweet, dark malts up front, with a slight prickling on the tongue from the combination of alcohol and carbonation. Finishes sweet and then dry, with a combination of fresh hops and more wonderful, understated woodsmoke.   Notes: Excellent beer. It may not be the smokiest, but it surely impressed me. TRY THIS BEER!",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Smoked Porter,89
147,90,Stubbie1,4.1,"This brew pours a dark almost black color with a slight hint of ruby. There is a fair sized tan head at the top and it gives away to a very thin sticky lace. The aroma is a mixture of roasted malt, brunt coffee, and a slight sweet scent. The flavor is mellow but very satisfying and is a direct copy of the aroma. There is a bit of a dry after taste (hops?) that hangs around and more of the smoke (burnt coffee) finish. Another very nice brew from Stone. I could sit down and enjoy another one BUT I only have one and some bitch named Isabel is hanging around off the coast.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Smoked Porter,89
147,90,byrd,4.42,"This was my first brew from the Stone Brewing Co and I was quite impressed. Pours very dark, almost black with ruby highlights. Nice tan head that is quite fluffy for a moment, becomes rocky for a short while, and finally gives way to a nice thick, sticky lace that holds on to the sides of the glass. Aroma is of roasty, caramel malts and a slight hop influence. The mouthfeel is first smooth, sweet caramel malt with slight undertones of chocolate. Then the strong roasty flavor hits the pallete and follows through to a mildly bitter, slightly dry finish. A roasty burnt flavor lingers afterwards. Medium body with moderate to light carbonation. Great mellow brew thats doesnt try to knock your socks off, but does anyway. A very solid, drinkable brew that I really enjoy. I was quite sad to hit the bottom of the 22oz bottle. I cant wait to pick this one up again!",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Smoked Porter,89
147,90,Hefe,4.43,"Sampled on 8/23/03 from 22 oz. bomber.  Appearance: Deep and dark with red and amber at the edges. Tan head that fades to some nice lacing.  Smell: The smoke is evident here, although subtle. Chocolate, tobacco, coffe, all underpinned by a caramel/malt sweetness.  Taste: Mocha, malt, cassis, a hint of toffee and smoky hoppiness on the finish.  Mouthfeel: Like a silk sheet this one was, minimal carbonation and a fantastic roundness in the mouth.  Drinkability: I worked through that bomber in no time, and started to look for another that unfortunately wasn't there. Must remember more than one next time.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Smoked Porter,89

There was the hint of raosted malts in the after taste, and smoke was theree, just not the way I expected. The dominant flavor had to be the bitterness from the hops. Reminded me of arrogant bastard that way. The creamy ness come in full effect after the bittnerness. I wish they would sacrifice the bitterness for more of the roasted flavor, but it is still a good beer. enjoy!",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Smoked Porter,89
147,90,BeerManDan,3.45,"I was really dissapointed with this porter from Stone. While it poured black in color and had some tan foam, the flavor was not what I expected. The smell of roasted malts were very appearent along with the hint of smoke. But, the flavor was not what I was exspecting from stone. The flavor lacked depth. The roasted malts and smoke flavor just wasn't powerful enough. It was just an average porter. I could taste the bitterness, but the flavor was lacking in every aspect of this porter.  This has made two of there latest beers that I have really been dissapoint with. The 7th anniversay and now their porter.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Smoked Porter,89
147,90,RoyalT,4.5,"Appearance  Very dark, almost black, with a gorgeous foamy volcanic head that held onto the inside glass.  Smell  Big flavor of burnt malt, molasses, and huge brown sugar. Theres also some budding bread in there and probably a lot of other things but its tough to get through the malt aroma. Certainly all the standard dark flavors (as mentioned) along with coffee, cocoa powder, banana, and other dark fruits.  Taste  The smoky flavor is more at the finish. Up front theres the huge flavors presented at the nose. The malt dominates but everything else is there as promised. The studious taster will also find hops for balance  I would also like to point out a fantastic trick. I enjoy the aroma of chocolate the most as youd find with cocoa power (chocolate and sugar kind of) but the taste I like best like chocolate chips (Nestle, for instance). The chocolate in this one comes out as powder in the nose and semi-sweet eating chocolate in the flavor. Well done.  Mouthfeel  Little carbonation in accordance with the style. This one is smooth, smooth, smooth.  Drinkability  I sucked this down while in the kitchen making tacos. It goes great with anything, including Mexican food, steak, chicken, or Cheerios.  Comments Not only is this a terrific brew, but it hit my personal preferences right on target. Awesome!  Update: The 2004 is wound a bit tighter than the 03. The heavy flavors are bigger and the lighter fruits and sugars are faint. This is a terrific candidate for cellaring.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Smoked Porter,89
147,90,Scooter77,4.6,"This beer kicks all forms of major ass, Im speechless! It pours a deep black color, theres not a single bit of light passing through this one. Its topped of by a thick and creamy tan head that dissipates moderately, leaving a thick, sticky film on the sides of the glass. Every time I smell the sweet aroma I detect a different scent. The major aromas are roasted malts, coffee, dark chocolate, and caramel with just a hint of butterscotch. There is a great balance of charred oak smokiness intermixed with the sweet aromas. The taste matches the aroma perfectly; ever aroma that I detected is represented very well on the palate. There is a nice coffee-like aftertaste that lingers around for a while. This is a beautifully well-balanced, full bodies brew. I could see myself drinking this beer all night long. Its absolutely wonderful.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Smoked Porter,89
147,90,Winter,4.63,"Pours near black in color with traces of very dark copper hues near the bottom where light eeks through. Tan head leaves traces of itself in thick sheets down the side of the glass. Sweet aroma consists of chocolate, coffee, rich malt and a touch of charred wood. Full-bodied, yet smooth mouthfeel. Flavors of sweet malt and chocolate introduce themselves up front. A hop bitterness makes its appearance midway through as it tosses a new flavor element into the mix. The unmistakable smokey flavor hits also in the middle, which is utilized perfectly throughout and lingers long after the dry finish. The smoked flavor is more intense as the porter warms.  Flavors are better, as the label suggests, if this porter isn't served right out of the fridge. Just a good overall beer, especially if your a porter fan. Smokiness adds an interesting twist that's not overdone either.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Smoked Porter,89
147,90,Boilermaker88,4.33,"Served on tap at Heroe's Bar & Grill in La Verne, CA  Beautiful near-black color with dark ruby tint at the edges. Thin, sticky tan/brown head that left sheets of lace behind.  Smell: chocolate and coffee aroma, similar to a mocha java, and a nice smokiness.  Taste: again, that mocha java thing. Also some caramel that gives it a pleasing sweetness. Great smokey flavor that is quite enticing. Nice mild hops kick in the finish to balance things out.  Feel: nice full-bodied, smooth, velvety texture.  This rather surprising offering by Stone is my favorite. Not at all what I expected, it exceeded all my preconceived ideas about how Stone would brew this style. SSP has a superb blending of tastes without the almost over the top aggressiveness characterizing other Stone beers. Reasonable % ABV and mellow nature make this so very quaffable. A real treat and my new Monday Night Football beer.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Smoked Porter,89

Strong aromas were sweet, smoked (duh) malts, and No. MN peat bog. Taste was dominated by smoky roasty malts. I was reminded of beef jerky. Despite the obvious smokiness, this beer was wonderfully balanced by a bitter finisth. Huge mouthfeel. I would buy this by the case.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Smoked Porter,89

147,90,Rumrunner,4.06,22oz. bottle  A bit different from other porters I have tried. It is somewhat like a stout to me. Still very good though.  Inviting dense brown color with a light brown head. Lacing is ample. The scent is light chocolate with a roasted smokiness. Some light toffee and bread waft through as well.  The flavors are all roast and smoke. There is a dark bread quality and some tart molassas like flavor. Also a toffee quality. There is some hoppiness but nothing to be alarmed about. It has a full bodied flavor.  It is very crisp and refreshing. Despite its dark color it is not heavy and drinks very easily. I do not drink porters on a regular basis but this one seems to differ from the few other porters that I have had. It tastes like a porter but it still has a stout quality to it in some ways. Anyway a very nice and enjoyable drink.,Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Smoked Porter,89

Lovely dark shade, very dark...you can pick up some reddish/brown when held to the light. Very nice head when poured, plus it left lots of lovely lacing through-out the glass. Light smokey aroma.  Nice chewey, medium bodied beer. This is one of their more balanced beers in my opinion, and it shows, the malt and hops blend well together, neither overshadowing the other. There's some roasted flavor present in the malt as well. It leaves a smooth smokey aftertaste that is pleasurable.  Pretty good brew. Not as smokey as some German smoke beers, so might be a way to introduce this flavor to someone. pat",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Smoked Porter,89

Heavy molasses rolls across the tongue and the finish leaves some bitter coffee and raisin. A bit of smokey tingle in the aftertaste. Brown sugar and toffee come out as the glass warms.

Deep dark brown or black color depending on your perspective of things. Fluffy, tan head. Full of soft hop bubbles that make you wonder how they do that. The smoke aroma was not the direct punch in the nose I expected. Instead, it was smooth, somewhat sublte, and very well placed. The smoke smell didn't dominate the traditional porter aromas of bitter roasted coffee. Taste was much the same. Smokiness was no where near dominate and let the subtle good porter flavors show through. Hints of creamy chocolate show through, or am I dreaming ? Wow what a tremendous beer. No where near as smoky as those August Schlenka Rauchbeers. Full bodied, very much inline with what you would expect from a porter.

However to call it a smoked porter, I expect more from it than what I got. Nice roasted malt in the beginning...dark roasted coffe beans...finishes with a clean VERY slight bitter off smokey flavor. Creamy mouthfeel. Overall a decent porter. As a smoked porter it left a lot to be desired in the taste section. It lured me in with the aroma of smoke but left me hanging.

Taste is quite exceptional, excellently done of smooth sweet chocolate up front, tones of roastyness settle in quickly of smoked black malts. Rich, luscious, and a super interior hop bitterness of mild abode that picks up in the finish with some more roasty smokeyness and hoppy, earthed bitterness and slight dryness of coffee and twinged chocolate late. Good full feel, solid creamyness all through and an excellent lingering finish of slight smoke, what a shock; not. The drinkability on this is amazing - smooth, rich, creamy, and easy.

Lots of flavors to go round with a plum fruitiness, some bitter espresso (even though the back label denies it), mild smoke flavor, and a seductive hoppiness that could keep me coming back to this fine beverage again and again. A friend, who sadly wasn't worthy of the Arrogant Bastard, deemed the Smoked Porter ""One of the best beers I've ever had"". Did someone say Stone?",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Smoked Porter,89
147,90,kbub6f,4.47,"Bought from the fridges at Gaslamp Liquor in San Diego, seven hours in my carryon, a couple of months in the fridge.  The medium-sized, light tan head is active, dense. The beer is black with garnet highlights. Lacing is thin and sticky. Smoky chocolate nose: nice! Some toffee in there, with a little sweetened milk gone bad (but in a good way). The front has smoky chocolate and a little grapey fruitiness (?). And hops. Lotsa hops. The tangy, thick middle gives up a bitter chocolate finish with some coffee zing. Very hoppy. Smoke and bitter hoppiness in the aftertaste.  Wow. This is very good. I wasn't expecting it to be so hoppy, but of course I should have. I think the smoke and the hops work well together. This beer has enough big tastes that the smoke comes off pretty subtle. Awesome.  (I can't believe I used the word 'subtle' in a Stone review).",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Smoked Porter,89
147,90,jreitman,4,"In traditional stone fashion, this is a big beer done a little differently than everyone elses. Overall impression is of their 6th Anniversary Porter with some smoke thrown in to add complexity. Poured a dark brown with red highlights and a creamy light brown head. Bitterness was a little surprising to find, but once you get over the shock, it starts to make sense in the beer. Sweet malt gives way to slightly more than a hint of smoke. Nice medium body.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Smoked Porter,89
147,90,marburg,3.7,"This one puzzled me a bit. I'd never had it nor read anything about it, so I wasn't really expecting something quite so stout-like. It was very, very dark, and the head was remarkably tight -- almost nitro-tight -- and dark tan as well. I thought I was looking at more of a stout. The aromas were nice, though I was hoping for just a tiny bit more of a ""smoky"" aroma. Definitely chocolate and sweet sensations, though. Very full-bodied with some big chocolate flavors. I really enjoyed it and thought it was exceptionally drinkable -- but I wanted intensity, passion, and, goddammit, smoke! Really, it just didn't live up to what I thought a smoked porter from Stone could be -- maybe a bit more lively and with a little more variety in flavors? (Like, you know, actual smoke?)",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Smoked Porter,89
147,90,TheDM,4.08,Very nice aroma that is pleasant to the nose. It has a typical very dark brown color with a small head that quickly disappears. I found my self taking 3 or four tastes before I even got a feeling for this Porter. It was a very mild taste that escaped me for a few moments. It had almost no before or after taste. Very smooth and lacking any bitterness. I find myself liking the Porters more and more. This brew is pushing me over the edge in that direction. Can I have some more please?,Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Smoked Porter,89
147,90,xgrigorix,4.27,"Dark brown, almost black with ruby highlights around the edges, and a rocky tan cocoa powder like head. Raisins and a sublte smokiness in the nose.

147,90,Shiredave,4.18,"Dark, ruby brown color, dense, tan head sustains itself leaving creepy trails of lace. Aroma is subdued, baking black bread, coffee and hints of last nights campfire. Buttery smooth w/ flavors of licorice, caramel and burnt chocolate. Penetrating, slightly harsh finish of hot hops and dark grains leaving a long, dry aftertaste. Excellent robust Porter.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Smoked Porter,89
147,90,Mitchster,3.71,"Slightly cloudy dark brown in color with burgandy accents, forming a decent-sized light-tan head atop fine bubbles with good retention and lacing. Carbonation is mild to moderate. The mouthfeel is at first sharp, then somewhat smooth, and finishing sharp again. I want a little more body, as it finishes somewhat thin. Medium body. Aroma of lightly roasted malts, lightly roasted coffee, a piquant earthiness and distant sweet molasses, all under an umbrella of distant campfire smoke and smoky herbs. The smoke is very light. Taste begins with ""mild for Stone, yet assertive for style"" citric hops with a subtle bite of smoke, subtle green grass, and notes of dark coffee and juniper in the finish which seems to increase as the moderately intense herbal hops begin to fade. As the brew warms, it takes on an acrid cheese character and the juniper becomes more assertive. Alcohol and off flavors are imperceptable. The aftertaste is of lightly smoked herbs.  A decent porter overall, but a little at odds with itself. With a little more malt, and a little more smoke it would live up to the high expectations these guys place upon themselves.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Smoked Porter,89
147,90,kmo1030,4.27,"good looking, very dark rootbeer look to it, almost black. this is one of the best smelling beers i've ever smelled. it smells very sweet and strongly floral, a pleasure to smell. this porter has a good chocolatey flavor to start, but after a few more sips, the smokey malts come through. the after taste is nice, leaving a very woody and smokey flavor, i feel like i should be exhaling smoke after drinking this. nice thick rich mouthfeel. very enjoyable for a type i don't usually drink.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Smoked Porter,89
147,90,philipt,3.92,"This is a very dark ruby beer, closer to black than red on a color sectrum. Decent sized light tan head, although somewhat smaller than expected, and leaves minimal lacing. The aroma consistes mainly of roasted malt with a subtle light burnt/smoke smell. The taste follows the aroma: roasted malt, more chocolate in the flavor than aroma, and finishes with a hint of smoked malt. A balancing hop bitterness is detected in the finish as well. The body is slighly thin for the accompanying taste. A good, solid, and drinkable beer.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Smoked Porter,89
147,90,beergeek279,4.3,"Served on sample at the Penn Festival. The color was dark brown, nearly black. The smell was of a coffeeish malt. The taste was sweet, caramelish, with only a slight hint of smokiness. The mouthfeel was heavy. I would drink several of these at once.  Although not quite as overboard as some of Stone's other brews, this is a good, quality porter, and a good example of a fairly rare beer.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Smoked Porter,89
147,90,aaronh,4.23,"Dark mahogany beer topped by a tan, long-lasting head. Mild, sweet malt aroma with a touch of hops. A very subtle smoky note as well. The taste is sweet and smoky, like a good southern barbeque sauce. Malt really makes its presence known, and the hops finsh it out with a nice bitterness on the finish. The aftertatse has a lingering smokiness to it. The mouthfeel is smooth and enjoyable. The drinkability of this really can't be beat. I'm amazed at the balanced, smooth character of this beer. This is truly a treat. A bomber may not be enough of this one. Pick up a case for your next cookout.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Smoked Porter,89
147,90,dwarbi,4.32,"This is a very good looking porter. Very dark, with a nice head and very good lacing. The aroma is mostly of burnt wood. It has a very nice taste. The taste is dominated by burnt toffe. Mildly bitter aftertaste. A very drinkable and typically tasty Stone brew.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Smoked Porter,89
147,90,jeffboo,4.36,"I like this one! A very flavorful offering from our friends at Stone.  Very striking black with red highlights and topped by a heavy tan head. From a sitting position the smoke is evident. As I get closer I can smell dark chocolate,sweet raisins/plums, and a light campfire smoke. It has a very drinkable medium body holding a solid sweet malt start, a rich chocolate malt middle, and a roasted malt/smokey finish. There are hops in the flavor profile, just enough to add some bitter complexity to balance the sweet malt flavors.  A very good example of a difficult brew, not too sweet or smokey. It would work well with smoked/grilled food.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Smoked Porter,89
147,90,elmocoso,4,"It took a little warming to get adequate smell out of this beer, but the wait was worth it. Subtle smoky aroma with a roasted maltyness grabbing most of the attention.  It was a dark black with reds showing through when held to the light.  Tan head that recedes to a decent collar with great lacing.  Whoa! The smoke hits you in the mouth and lingers very pleasantly in the mouth.  A little carb bite on the tongue and good mouthfeel. A solid beer!",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Smoked Porter,89
147,90,jcalabre,4.1,"Originally sampled on 29 December 2001. This rich porter has elements of smoke, chocolate & coffee in it. It is definitely a sipping beer. Sit back in your easy chair and spend some time with this beauty. Be sure to have it at cellar temperature, Not ice cold!!",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Smoked Porter,89
147,90,Thrasher,3.91,"Impenetrably dark with spiderweb lacing. Chocolate and smoke aroma. The malts are huge, and the smoke is very light but it's tough to keep smoke from dominating a big slice of the flavor. I am also getting a lot of hop bitterness and dryness. Hardly any sweetness from the malts carries through, and the juicy hops leave it bitter and appetizing. A serious beer, and a good one at that.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Smoked Porter,89
147,90,Jon,4.15,"Stone's Smoked Porter pours a deep, dark brown with a thick, frothy head that retains well. Smell is big on roasted malt and, appropriately, smokiness. Taste is quite smoky, with a minor emphasis on hops, too. Mouthfeel is quite smooth and drinkability ranks high. A very good smoked porter and another solid effort from the folks in North County San Diego.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Smoked Porter,89
147,90,Elemental,4.7,Damn good beer. The best smoked porter I have tasted to date. Great dark brown color with a thick head. Nice hop flavor and aroma. A slightly sweet taste with a smoked flavor (as expected) that leaves a great aftertaste in your mouth. Smooth as it goes down. Overall a great beer.,Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Smoked Porter,89

Well as with all Stone brews I have had so far this beer looks absolutlly great..deep mahogany brown beer..with some garnet accents when held to the light and on top a huge frothy tan head..great stuff. Wow the aroma of this beer blew my mind..this is great stuff..roasted deep dark chocolate malts mixed with some great black coffee..and with a luxurious smokey smell below. The taste is just as I described the aroma except I get that wondeful Stone creamieness..fantastic stuff. Wonderful and smooth on the palate..with some great aftertatse. A most drinkable porter indeed..I did not think I would like this ""smoked"" beer..but its just great.

147,90,beerluvr,4.49,"Pours a deep tan head over a clear dark brown liquid, ruby highlights. Light wisps of smokiness mingle with roasted malt makes for a quite appetizing nose. A basketful of flavors follows: light chocolate, coffee, roasted grain bitterness and a good amount of hoppiness, then some latent smokiness appears with an undercurrent of butteriness. Finishes with a bitter note...the smoke flavor accompanies, not dominates this super quaffable Porter. All blends together in perfect harmony.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Smoked Porter,89
147,90,BierReise,4.35,Nice beautiful chocolate color with tan head that lingers and laces the glass. Smell is smoky with chocolate notes.

147,90,Running4beer,4.35,"22oz bomber. A buddy of mine came back from out west and gave this to me. This was good. It was a good smoked porter, definetly easy to drink. I had spoken to a few people about smoked porters before and some said that they aren't the tastiest and can be quite harsh, well this is not harsh and it is very tasty.  Pours out a dark brown with a medium tan head that hold its place for the entire sitting. Smoky aroma, the aroma that you get while sitting outside and the fire pit is going, smoke, roasted malts, smoke, roasted malts, smoke and roasted malts and a slight coffee. The taste had some chocolate and a little coffee, roasted malts and a smoked aftertaste but not overwhelming at all was hardly noticeable. This was a good tasting beer, drinkability was very smooth. I could sit in front of a fire and drink this throughout the night. Very good balance of flavors and no strong bitterness or aftertaste. This one's smoking",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Smoked Porter,89
147,90,MJR,4,"Appearance: Pours a deep, dark brown with a hint of red. No light gets in or out, as it's almost completely opaque. A dark tan head forms a finger thick and retains as a small cap.  Smell: Rich and malty, with a smokey undercurrent. A touch of coffee is hidden deep in the muck...  Taste: I was suprised by how relaxed this beer was. I was expecting a full taste-bud assault, but no... It's very smooth and rich, with a nice maltiness. Suggestions of coffee and chocolate are hidden in the dark fluid. The smokiness is quite restrained and minimal. There's a steady, but small, stream of sweetness that flows from the first sip to the last drop. Not much hop presence at all, just a ghost-like trail of bitterness that is easy to miss.  Mouthfeel: Medium in body with a 'just right' mouthfeel. The alcohol is extraordinarily well hidden. Finishes smooth...  Drinkability: Good stuff. The smoke hangs in the background, playing back-up to the malt flavor, instead of taking over and ruining it. Another solid ale from Stone.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Smoked Porter,89
147,90,cretemixer,3.58,"Pours the deepest brown with garnet hues noticable when held up to the light. An ivory toned head fades fast to a cling-ring in no time. Smoky bitter chocolate malt aroma with hints of tobacco. Smooth & malty with bitter chocolate flavors. The smoky aroma isn't as strong in the flavor profile. A solid porter, but not outstanding. Finishes dry. Medium to full body with pleasant carbonation. Surprisingly average offering from Stone. Still a fine beer, but Stone has set the bar high and spoiled us so.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Smoked Porter,89
147,90,jward,4.6,"A dark brown/black body supports a medium-sized foamy tan head. The nose presents a rich chocolate aroma, with notes of sugary plum, especially as the glass is raised to the mouth. The flavor begins with roasted malt, working in tandem with a mild sourness, and a hint of hoppy bitterness. But it is in the finish that this beer really shows its stuff, with contrasting elements of fruit (grape, perhaps?) and an understated smokiness that's just perfect. With a smooth and agreeable mouthfeel, and relatively moderate levels of alcohol, this is a highly drinkable brew. A great beer.  The blurb on the back of the bottle suggests that this is Stone's ""least understood"" beer. Maybe so. In my judgment, it's better than some of their more acclaimed beers.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Smoked Porter,89
147,90,ElGuapo,4.17,"A thick deep dark brown pour with a large covering of tan foam that will stick around and leave trails of lace all over the glass. Aromas of coffee, chocolate, dark malts, and a hint of smokiness hit the nose. A quite wonderful aroma.  This beer is very rich and full bodied. It is incredibly smooth and creamy. Chocolate, coffee, and roasted malts lead the way in the flavoring of this powerhouse porter. There is just enough smokiness to make it live up to its name. It is easy to drink, and impossible to pass by.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Smoked Porter,89
147,90,IrishRedRock,4.25,"22 oz. brown bottle, and a really cool one at that because that's all Stone does with their bottles. Flowed from the bottle like oil, nice and dark and thick. Very deep brown, almost black, with a well-retaining tan head. The aromas are quite sensual. Dark malts blend well with the scent of black coffee, hops, and burnt toast.  The mouthfeel is thick, slick, and oily. Almost like chewing on something. Roasted bitter flavors arise from the start, with a big malty middle following that, with flavors of chocolate and coffee. Just a touch of hops are present to balance things out, and it did leave a bit of a smoky aftertaste. Definitely a damn good porter.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Smoked Porter,89
147,90,irishmoss,4.33,"At the first pour I was impressed with the deep brown color of the porter. Almost like burnt caramel, but not to dark like a stout. It remains translucent when held up to the light and the head is a nice rich tan color that leaves a clingy web down the sides of the glass. The aroma has a chocolatey coffee appeal to it, as does the flavor. This is a brew that has a body with substance, and it remains a remarkably smooth drink. I can easily see myself drinking this all night.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Smoked Porter,89
147,90,Dmann,4.8,"Yet another great brew from the people at Stone, who have yet to let me down and are now my all time favorite brewery. This one poures a very dark brown, almost black with a small head that leaves decent lace around the glass. The smell reminded me of the Arrogant Bastard Ale but with a hint of smoke, chocolate and coffee added to it. The taste is right on: little bit of hop bite at the beginning, then the smoked flavor comes in along with a hint of malt and chocolate, and finishes with a crisp coffee flavor. This one would go great with some bar-b-q'd burgurs....awesome brew!",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Smoked Porter,89
147,90,AtLagerHeads,4.32,"Well, Stone's is batting a 1000 with me so far. This is another very good brew that pleases all the way through. Very dark brown to black look with a somewhat smallish tan head, but a good degree of lacing left behind to remind you of what was. The taste is a very nice blend of smokey and roasted grains that give a sense of chocolate and coffe, but without overpowering the senses. This is another of the Stone's brews that gives good body in the mouthfeel, but which finishes with enough crispness as to not be wimpy creamy. Again I say, more, please.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Smoked Porter,89
147,90,dmarch,4.32,"As a fan of Rauchbiers, I pretty much knew that I would enjoy this. The smokey flavor seems very appropriate for a porter.

This beer really makes me wish that Stone was more available in PA.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Smoked Porter,89
147,90,Denali,4.13,"On tap at the Blind Tiger in New York City.  Appearance: Jet black with frothy tan head that laced like mad.  Smell: Chocolate malt and toffee aromas.  Taste: Starts off with a surprising hops flavor. Follows with strong bitter chocolate malt taste. Coffee aftertaste.  Mouthfeel: Thick with light carbonation.  Drinkability: Very easy drinking.  Comments: I was surprised and disappointed that I could not detect any smoky characteristics, but I enjoyed this nevertheless.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Smoked Porter,89
147,90,Jason,4.03,"On tap at the Sunset Cantina.  Thick webby lacing riding off the tawny brown colour. Estery smoky aroma and malty nose.

Good stuff on tap and one of the better porters on tap I have had, bring it on.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Smoked Porter,89
147,90,TXHops,3.63,"Stone Smoked Porter pours a brilliant, deep black color with a thick, brown head of uneven foamgood lacing. A pungent, burnt fruit aroma fills my nose, suggesting carbonized food more than smoke. Theres a touch of the slightly astringent, slightly solvent-like smell that seems to accompany all smoke beerssmelling like plastic burning on a campfire.  The flavor is meaty and roasted, with a slightly rich, boldness that belies the gravity. A taste shockingly similar to roasted peanuts complete with salt, fills my mouth on the swallow. The smokiness seems to be more evident in the tail than in the mouth, with a suggestion of the darkened, outer skin that surrounds a smoked beef brisket. The final taste, if the beer is allowed to rest a while between sips, is that of deep, musty, wet earth. Of course, I havent eaten much moist, black earth, but I know what it smells like, so I can extrapolate a little. The salty, solvent-like astringency never really disappears, but neither does the underlying roasty porter base, nor the bitterness of the hops.  I like this smoked porterit tastes more like meat than other smoked beers Ive tried and the peanut flavor was kinda fun, not to mention unusually compelling.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Smoked Porter,89
147,90,BeerResearcher,4.12,"The unusual tar tinted dark brown color requires careful examination. The full smoky (not overly so) malt is the star of the show. The fairly high hops with light a metallic and somewhat grapefruity bitterness deserve some attention as well. Lightly sweet with a dry edged body. A hint of dark chocolate and coffee offer contrasting flavors to offset both the malt sweetness and hop bitterness. A smoky edge is more apparent in the aroma than in flavor. A light hop floral bouquet and sweet malt give way to a comforting smokiness. The beige/tan head dissipates at its own slow pace then lingers as fine lace. Flavors merge, blend and congenially mingle together. Well Done!",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Smoked Porter,89
147,90,Darkale,4.38,"Wonderful, dark, ponderous brew. Pours thick and heavy. You can see the head coming up through the thick beer, roiling, getting lighter, and forming a thick, munchy tan head that looks so beautiful against the black liquid. A gorgeous beer; one of the prettiest I've ever poured. Sweet malty aroma.  I ought to know by now that porters are not heavy beers, necessarily, but still I am surprised by the deftness of the taste. Sweet, but not thick or syrupy. Nice hint of smoke, nice deep layer of chocolate. Nice and complex, with different flavors dancing around your tongue, from the slightly bitter to the cocoa-sweet.  Head is long-lasting, clings to the glass like it's afraid it might drown.  All of Stone's beers make me grin like a fool. I just sit there, sipping, marveling in the complexity. Then I see how much is left in that big brown bottle and grin and grin and grin. But, unlike the other Stone beers, this one won't knock you on your butt. An excellent quiet evening beer.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Smoked Porter,89
147,90,WVbeergeek,4.1,"Huge 22oz. bomber, pours with an very dark ruby almost opaque black in color, with a moccha toned nicely constructed head. The aroma is mainly of darker roasts with a background of a smokey screen in the aroma. The flavor is has mild cocoa notes along with roasted barley all wrapped up in a wonderful rauch style smoked. Leaves a nice dryness on the tongue, I am guessing this beer goes really well with a nice juicy steak. Very good porter, if just getting into rauchbier this is a nice one to start with, very mild smoke taste and aroma. All together very well done, everything is tied together to form a complete full flavor. A medium to light bodied porter, this beer definitely turns the tongue into a desert, very dry mouthfeel. All in all very drinkable smoked porter, but even with my love for Stone this is a dinner beer for me. Not a beer for chilling at the bar and drinking one right after another, but a very enjoyable experience none the less.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Smoked Porter,89

Dark tan head with excellent lacing.  Smell: That smell of campfire smoke in your clothes. Or a summer barbecue with friends. Not an overpowering smoky smell...just enough to let you know it's there.  Taste: Mostly a bitter dark chocolate flavor with a fair amount of smoky flavor. Towards the end there was a modest amount of bitterness.  Mouthfeel: Large. Very full-bodied and crisp.  Drinkability: I'm not a fan of smoke-flavored beers. However, this was not a bad beer to drink. I let it warm quite a bit from the first to last taste and it certainly got better towards the end. The smoke flavor is not overpowering and really complements the other flavors.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Smoked Porter,89
147,90,Riggo,4.13,"Color is opaque black. A hard pour delivered a fluffly, creamy, chocolate-colored head, malty and delicious. An immediate scent of bubblegum in the nose, followed by roasted grains, sour, sweet malt, and cigarette/campfire smoke. The flavor is oakey, sour, and more fruity and less espresso-like than a stout (appropriate for the porter style?) As it warms, an oatmeal malty sweetness appears. Mouthfeel is silky and smooth. A very well-balanced brew with a dry, smokey, and coffeeish lingering finish.  An excellent, balanced porter from Stone, not as ""in-your-face"" as some other Stone brews, which is fine by me.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Smoked Porter,89

I am so excited to try this, Seeming I just brewed a smoked porter my self. Hops fill the nose along with burnt amber aroma. The first sip brings a nice smoky flavor to the palate, which is very, very nice. Hops fill the rest of the palate with a coffee malt flavor. This is a very good beer, A clean finish is very nice because the smoked flavor is not stuck in your mouth for a long time. This is another exceptional beer by Stone.  Cheers",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Smoked Porter,89
147,90,NeroFiddled,4.3,"Very dark brown in color, almost black, but with clear ruby and mahogany highlights visible at the base of the glass. It's frothy tan head holds quite well. It keeps a creamy collar and thin surface covering throughout the glass, and leaves good lace as well. The nose is quite enticing, with a chocolate and caramel base that's enhanced by a soft peat-smokiness. The smoke is just enough to add to, and enhance, the aroma of the beer. The body is medium/full, creamy, and velvety smooth in the mouth. The flavor, much like the aroma and mouthfeel, is quite smooth and round. This beer is exceptionally well balanced in all regards. It's softly sweet with a combination of milk chocolate and caramel, a light touch of smoke, a supportive bitterness and some background hop flavors. It finishes with a lingering roastiness, mild smokiness, and dull bitterness followed by some light, grassy hop flavor. Although the subtle smoke gets lost in the flavor over the course of the glass, it remains in the nose. Very nicely done, and highly drinkable with just enough smoke to give it a little bit of complexity and keep it interesting throughout one or two. Except for it's strength, this would make a very nice session beer. Highly recommended.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Smoked Porter,89
147,90,avylover,3.93,"(MY first review on BA) - I'm not a huge porter/stout fan, but I like this beer enough to give it another try. Pours almost solid black with a nice tan head. A bit thin for a porter, but this adds a bit to the drinkability. Mild alcohol bite at first, but disappears after about three sips. Not a whole lot of complex tastes going on here, a bit of coffee taste. Nice hoppy bitterness going down. Basically a hoppy, not-so-thick porter. As good a porter as i've tried.  A year and half later, with a year and a half more beer knowledge: Expected this to be a bit more thick, with maybe a little more ""Smoke"" to speak of. No doubt the tamest of the Stone brews i've tried, this is still a good porter. Good malted milk flavors to add to the above review.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Smoked Porter,89

Maybe the most delicate of Stone's brews I've tried. Or is it watery? It manages to pull together flavors of burning wood, whole cinnamon, cocoa, vanilla, prunes and spice. Really enjoyable actually.  Try with Moderato's smoked leg of lamb (done in a Texas smoker)",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Smoked Porter,89
147,90,zerk,4.17,"Black with a touch of amber, if you hold it up to the light, and a thin but persistent head. Aroma of chocolate, a touch of coffee, and a light touch of smoke. The flavor begins with coffee and a bit of chocolate... with some spicy and slightly bitter hops blending in. The smoke flavor complements the beer very well, but in no way overpowers it. Mouthfeel is very smooth and creamy, with a medium body and low carbonation. A very well done beer.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Smoked Porter,89
147,90,RBorsato,4.06,"Dark brown, mohogany (ruby red highlights) with a low brown head and light lace. Light smoky and chocolate aroma with rough roasty alcohol tones. Chocolate malt flavor dominates with a light smokiness. Medium bodied with a slightly rough bitter finish.  [22 oz. bottle for $3.99]",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Smoked Porter,89
147,90,QXSTER1,4.1,"After trying some of Stone's other offerings I expected an over the top, smoky, thick porter on the imperial side. What I found was a very nice, medium bodied, roasty porter that was tasty and very drinkable. To me the smokiness was negligible, but this didn't detract from it's merits as a decent brew, in fact it was one of the better porters around, just not quite what I expected. A nicely balanced beer with plenty of bittersweet chocolate and coffee and a subtle hop bite in the finish. Another fine Stone brew.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Smoked Porter,89
147,90,johnrobe,4.29,"Perhaps I have a predilection for smoky things. Sam Adam's Scotch Ale was my favorite of their offerings and I lamented its demise. My favorite scotch whiskies come from Islay. I love to barbecue with mesquite or hickory chips. Hell, the name of my alma mater's mascot is Smokey. So with that I have to say, this is one tasty brew. Anyone who likes porters or smoked beers should give it a try.  It pours black in the glass with a tan head that dissipates midway through consumption. There's a lot going on in the aroma: fruity esters...plum preserves and raisins, as well as light molasses, chocolate, a touch of sourness and just a whisp of smoke. Very balanced taste. Dark malt (yet without that deep roasted bitterness..spot on for a porter) and sweeter malt with enough hops to keep the sweetness in check. The mouthfeel is lush and medium-bodied. A subtle smokiness comes through in the finish and sticks around on your palate, very nicely done.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Smoked Porter,89
147,90,mickstepp,3.81,"I'm not an experienced drinker of smoked Porters so I have little basis for comparison. I like the look of the beer. Nice and dark with a decent head. The aroma was subtle and I tried to pick up the smokiness but really couldn't. Mostly it smelled like a pale ale just not as hoppy and citrusy.The beer has a nice velvety mouthfeel but was a lot crisper than I thought it would be. I expected either chocolatey or bitter or both. I was a little disappointed in the amount of smoke in the taste (after all this was my first experience with a smoked beer). It was there but very faint and in the background. I should say that I'm a huge Stone fan so I hold their beers up to a very, very high standard. This beer was good but not as rich and smokey as I would have liked. I drank it cold (right out of the 'fridge) and perhaps too cold. I think I'll try it again when the weather gets brutally cold and I'll let the beer warm up to closer to room temperature",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Smoked Porter,89
147,90,purplehops,3.88,This porter pours a deep rich black with garnet highlights. The head is a light carmel color with lots of staying power. The aroma is malty with notes of smoke and dried fruit. The taste starts smooth with plenty of malt flavor and finishes with a smokey bite and an aftertaste of hop spiciness and smoke. The mouthfeel is quite velvety and smooth. A very enjoyable porter. The smokiness is balanced with the sweetness of the malt quite well. Personally I wish there was a little more umph (sp?) to it. I feel like I have been teased in that it left me expecting more than I got. None the less this is a very nice porter. Has potential to be a great porter.,Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Smoked Porter,89
147,90,CharlesRiver,4.17,"Very dark, almost black in color with a 1/4 inch tan head. Robust and full bodied but not over powering. The smoke is well balanced with the rest of the beer. There are hints of chocolate in the beginning that give way to the smoke flavor. Redbones has this on tap and I can't wait!",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Smoked Porter,89
147,90,PhantomVodoo,4.37,"Pours dark brown to black and somewhat opaque. Brownish head. Aroma is of smoke and roasted malts. Taste is of chocolate and coffee and of course smoke. The smoked malts really give this beer character and a unique flavor. Fairly heavy for a porter. IMO, Stone's is a little heavier and maybe a little sweeter than the Alaskan Smoked Porter. Personally, I prefer the Alaskan slightly over the Stone, but take your pick, they are both exceptional beers. I'm beginning to hold Stone Brewing in very high regard.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Smoked Porter,89
147,90,Kwak,3.8,"Head: Soft and creamy lots of flavor. Body: A muddy dark look nice brown color with a rube tint. Taste: Sweet Smokey bitter a little malt and small chocolate coffee, with a nice warming finish.  Very complex brew with a great taste!",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Smoked Porter,89
147,90,Jarod,4.5,"It poured into the glass a very dark brown/red in color. The head was a creamy light chocolate in color and very thick. And the lace seemed to last to the end of the glass. The aroma is deep malt, lightly smoked, caramel, and even a hint of coffee and elements of chocolate. The taste is of a sweet malt, caramel hints of coffee/chocolate and smoke. It is nicely hopped, and I really enjoyed the smoke qualities in this beer.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Smoked Porter,89
147,90,Longstaff,4.43,"This marvelous creation looks black as night and even if you hold it up to the light, you can barely see the outline of the lightbulb with some reddish highlights. First sip starts out with a slickness coupled withfaint chocolate flavors that turns into roasted coffee like flavor in the middle. The lingering aftertaste is very dry and roasted. After my first swallow, I was wondering where the smoke flavor was, then about 10 seconds later it kicks in and is very nice - not overpowering at all. After each swallow the flavors just seem to last in your mouth forever.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Smoked Porter,89
147,90,TheLongBeachBum,4.25,"Another Stone Beer - Smoked Porter this time. I am seriously falling in love with the silk-printed trademark 'Gargoyled' brown glass Stone Bombers, they truly represent the wholesome, in yer face character of Stones Beers. I love Brewers that take fewer prisoners than the Japanese when it comes to Brewing. Look up Black Body in Physics text books, and where it once waxed lyrical about Plancks Curves and an Emissivity of 1.0 - it now just says Stone Smoked Porter. Huh - and I respected Sir William Herschel at school (I bet he drank wine)!!? A rudely opaque beer that pours with little carbonation. A lovely brown head formed, but it had as much resolve as the Republican Guard  and soon retreated and disappeared under scrutiny. A Chocolately introduction that even Marianne Faithful would be proud of. This leads to a roasted coffee middle, and a superb lingering bitter finish. The smoked dimension enters unannounced at the end, akin to trying to stand up after and hour or two in an Amsterdam Café. Mouthfeel is good (no more Marianne Faithfull comments as I will get ejected), and this contributes to a smooth drinking Porter with no sweetness whatsoever, quite contrary to some UK Porters I have tried. But I dont care  I love this beer, and have just adopted it. Stone appear to be able to turn their hand to any style with a tenacity that is highly respected by this one Limey. Another great beer, when will I have a bad one from Stone I wonder??? Hmm., better pack Two Bottles of this in tomorrows lunchbox.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Smoked Porter,89
147,90,jtw5877,4.3,"This is everything I look for in a porter, elements of chocolate, caramel, coffee, and a nice smoked malt taste. It pours a nice deep brown with nice amount of head. Smooth rich taste leaves me wishing I had another.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Smoked Porter,89
147,90,Gusler,4.7,"As deep as garnet gets, before we call it brown, the head is ""Chocolate"", frothy, long lasting; the lace clings in thick sheets till the very bottom of the glass. Nose is deep malt, lightly smoked, sweet, caramel, and even a hint of coffee. Front is sweet malt, the top is medium to full, the finish is of course ""Smokey"", nicely hopped, light to moderate carbonation, dry, and a nice long lasting bitter after taste. Call me a ""Stone-o-phile"", but I like the over the top hops, high ABV, big malts and that robustness, only found in a few brewers beers, such as ""Alesmith"".",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Smoked Porter,89
147,90,sinistersteve,3.85,"The beer pours a deep dark color with a thick head. I was a bit disappointed with lack of smoke in the aroma. Being a Stone brew, I expected to be overwhelmed with a smokey aroma that would bring back memories of camping. With the lack in aroma, it is made up for in taste. You can taste the smoke, but it doesn't overwhelm you. This is probably the worst Stone brew I've had, but that doesn't make this a bad beer. I wouldn't have any problems buying this beer again. I just expected more out of this beer coming from a great brewer like Stone.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Smoked Porter,89
147,90,hyuga,4.77,"Almost completely opaque. Light brown head composed of tiny bubbles that stays pretty well. Quite a bit in the nose, lots of smoked peaty malt, chocolate, and caramel backed by leafy hops. As for the taste, the expected smoked grain. This is most apparent with retro-olfaction, but is definitely a big presence throughout. Lots of roasted grain and dark chocolate, very bittersweet up front. Leafy and slightly rind-like hops come out more in the back, but are subtle and balance perfectly with the malt. Very slight fruitiness, plum-like. Perfectly smooth and creamy mouthfeel. I'm a big fan of smoked beers, and this one is amazing. I am very impressed, I love this beer. I bow to the great gargoyle.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Smoked Porter,89
147,90,mzwolinski,4.35,"Very nice robust porter. Pours almost completely opaque, even backlit, though ominous, blood-red highlights are perceptible. Thin, creamy head persists throughout the 22 oz drink.  The aroma, true to style, smells of roasted coffee and perhaps charcoal.  Taste is slightly chocolately, though roasted grain dominates. Slight smokey flavor from their pete-smoked malt is detectable throughout.  Very full-bodied ale, with a slightly sweet finish. This is a very drinkable brew -- it was difficult for me to wait for the beer to warm up a bit, but well worth it! Tastes best when just slightly cool.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Smoked Porter,89
147,90,Brent,3.03,"Up to now, I've liked every Stone beer I've had the chance to try. This was almost true for the Smoked Porter, but it is the defining character, the smoke, that turned me off. Beautiful to behold in the glass. The nose was a surprising sweet, thin chocolate. Up front, a very nice robust porter. Then the smoke flavor emerged at the end, and I found it to be a disconcerting stale bar-smoke like flavor, rather than a peat or wood smoke. Had this been a straight porter, I think I would have loved it.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Smoked Porter,89
147,90,Dogbrick,4.38,"Another great beer from Stone. This one is not as edgy as Arrogant Bastard but still unique. Very dark color with a thin and lasting beige head. The aroma is smokey of course. Medium body, and the smoked flavor was not overpowering and complemented the malt perfectly. Slight bitter chocolate in the aftertaste. Well done.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Smoked Porter,89
147,90,marc77,4.27,"Virtually black in hue, w/ deep garnet aorund the rim when held to light. Persistant beige head leaves loose lace. Chocolate malt, carob, butterscotch, dark caramel and smooth black patent comprise the aroma, while smokey peated malt is surprisingly subdued. Quite appetizing aromawise. The malt profile is very smooth & lacks any black patent sharpness, allowing mellow chocolate and dark caramel malt to provide a flavorful base sweetness. Hop bitterness, although secondary, counters this sweetness well, lending an overall cleanly bittersweet chocolate profile. The use of peated malt is conservative but adequate enough to add a pleasant smokey undertone. Moderately bodied, w/ a dextrinous and enjoyable mouthfeel. Finishes very clean, w/ chocolate flavors abruptly ending but light peat smoke briefly lingering. This is a tasty, well balanced and highly drinkable porter-- It's perhaps the most subtle brew by Stone I've had. Agreeably mellow.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Smoked Porter,89
147,90,Murph,4.47,"Pours almost as black as black can be, only the barest hints of light getting around the edge. The brew has a nice brown head on it to start but once that fades there is no lace at all and no more head. Huge roasted coffee, chocolate, and smoke aromas dominate. Starts off like a straight up porter with some nice bitter coffee and roasted malt flavors before fading into a bittersweet dark chocolate taste. The porter taste fades and the beer appears to be done but then a huge smoked quality comes in and slaps you in the face. Smooth and creamy, this is one seriously drinkable beer. Damn these guys know what they are doing. A big thanks to Greg and Co. for making these beers.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Smoked Porter,89
147,90,cokes,4.12,"Throws a glass of near black liquid. When held to light, it is realized that it the darkest shade of ruby possible. Crystal clear too. Light brown head settles out quickly. Delicious nose of chocolate, charcoal and faint wood smoke. A faint fruity sweetness resides here as well. Taste is heavy on the rich dark maltiness associated with porters. Lots of expresso and dark chocolate tones with some malty sweetness. Smoke plays a backup role. It comes in towards the finsh and mingles with the hops to turn this one pleasingly bitter with charcoal dominating the aftertaste. Comparing this to other (good) smoked beers I have tried, the smoke flavor does not seem quite as integrated. Almost seems like an afterthought and at times seems sort of stale. Not a major complaint, as it is still pretty tasty. Body is medium. Solid foundation, but does not necessarily dazzle the mouth. I do like this beer quite a bit, but it pales in comparison to the Alaskan Smoked Porter....but then again, few beers reach those heights in my eyes.  Good stuff, Bighuge. Thanks alot!",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Smoked Porter,89
147,90,sponberg,4,"The aroma has an ironlike smokiness to it, with hints of citrusy hop. Dark dark brown.  The flavors in some order (changes sip to sip) - citrus hop; an oiliness similar to that found in an oatmeal stout; smoky maltiness; chocolatey maltiness; roasted coffee maltiness. Take the late, lamented Big Indian Porter, subtract some of the malt, add in hops & smoke, and you have this beer. This is NOT a bad thing at all. The finish is very nice - a little sweet, with some smoky-roasty-dry malt overtones.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Smoked Porter,89
147,90,mickeymac,3.93,"It's close to black with a surprisinlgly strong tan head. Even after it warmed, it gave off only a slight smell, with the smoke just barely detectable. The smoke flavor is also subtle with lots of nice roasty malt swimming around. Drinking it is a bit like chewing on a little bit of black patent and chocolate malt.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Smoked Porter,89
147,90,aracauna,3.9,"It's a cross between the smell of your clothes the morning after you stayed up late staring into the campfire and stale cigarette smoke. That's the dominate aspect of the character, or at least the middle anyway. The beginning is more a good porter, warm and malty without crossing into stout territory. The ending is bitter hops with the lingering stale smoke. Actually, given the almost pitch black color and tan head of this beer, I'm surprised the malt doesn't play a stronger role in the flavor of this beer. This would be excellent with grilled pork or some of the smokier barbeque I've had.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Smoked Porter,89
147,90,Bierman9,4.03,"This is the first smoked-style bier I've had in a while other than Schlenkerla... Quite good! Opaque, dark brown color, with a smooth tan head, and attractive lacework. Nose was smoky, malty and dry; reminiscent of Schlenkerla. Body was a degree or 2 less than medium, but mouthfeel was good otherwise. Good malt backbone, and the smokiness is not subtle, but just strong enough. Some other roasty-porter notes come through, and it finishes well on the dry side. All the Stones biers I've tried to date are quite good! Zum Wohl!!  overall: 4.1 appearance: 4.5 | smell: 4 | taste: 4 | mouthfeel: 4 | drinkability: 4  261",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Smoked Porter,89
147,90,ZAP,4.38,Huge rocky head...great soft smoked aroma..very very dark burgandy...sweet on the buds with a smokey accent..not overbearing smokiness though(about right)..a bit sweet/syrupy mouthfeel...almost some java tones..very good but in the the same league as Alaskan Brewings' Smoked Porter.,Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Smoked Porter,89
147,90,Wildman,3.7,"The beer has a nice dark color to it when you pour, plus a nicely colored head to accent it. The smell is rather interesting, since I usually don't drink smokey beers. It is lighter than other porters. The taste is good and interesting do to the smoky aspect of it. Worth a try.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Smoked Porter,89
147,90,Bighuge,4.3,Dark ruby witha beautiful thick head that has good retention. Smoked salmon and jerky on the nose. Medium body. Slick mouthfeel. Light smoked jerky on the palate. Chocolate and coffee tones also present. Some good roasty tones too. I like this one. The only better smoked porter I've had is from Alaskan.,Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Smoked Porter,89
147,90,beernut7,3.25,"Fairly light bodied porter. Lightly smoked flavor with little other distinctive character. Not the best, but one of the more drinkable smokers on a quantity basis.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Smoked Porter,89
147,90,jonnylieberman,4,"As with all Stone beers, the Smoked Porter is top shelf. However, it is not really smoked enough for my taste. A smoked porter is a weird idea anyway, because you are already using so many burnt grains. Rogue makes a smoked beer that really tastes smoky. Very yummy. This one, a good porter, but not smoky enough.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Smoked Porter,89
